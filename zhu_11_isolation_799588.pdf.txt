Abstract
Background: Bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAV-3) belongs to the Mastadenovirus genus of the family Adenoviridae
and is involved in respiratory and enteric infections of calves. The isolation of BAV-3 has not been reported prior to
this study in China. In 2009, there were many cases in cattle showing similar clinical signs to BAV-3 infection and a
virus strain, showing cytopathic effect in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, was isolated from a bovine nasal swab
collected from feedlot cattle in Heilongjiang Province, China. The isolate was confirmed as a bovine adenovirus
type 3 by PCR and immunofluorescence assay, and named as HLJ0955. So far only the complete genome
sequence of prototype of BAV-3 WBR-1 strain has been reported. In order to further characterize the Chinese
isolate HLJ0955, the complete genome sequence of HLJ0955 was determined.
Results: The size of the genome of the Chinese isolate HLJ0955 is 34,132 nucleotides in length with a G+C content of
53.6%. The coding sequences for gene regions of HLJ0955 isolate were similar to the prototype of BAV-3 WBR-1 strain,
with 80.0-98.6% nucleotide and 87.5-98.8% amino acid identities. The genome of HLJ0955 strain contains 16 regions
and four deletions in inverted terminal repeats, E1B region and E4 region, respectively. The complete genome and DNA
binding protein gene based phylogenetic analysis with other adenoviruses were performed and the results showed
that HLJ0955 isolate belonged to BAV-3 and clustered within the Mastadenovirus genus of the family Adenoviridae.
Conclusions: This is the first study to report the isolation and molecular characterization of BAV-3 from cattle in
China. The phylogenetic analysis performed in this study supported the use of the DNA binding protein gene of
adenovirus as an appropriate subgenomic target for the classification of different genuses of the family
Adenoviridae on the molecular basis. Meanwhile, a large-scale pathogen and serological epidemiological
investigations for BVA-3 infection might be carried out in cattle in China. This report will be a good beginning for
further studies on BAV-3 in China.

Introduction
Bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAV-3) belongs to the Mastadenovirus genus of the family Adenoviridae and is involved
in respiratory and enteric infections of calves [1]. Bovine
adenoviruses (BAVs) cause a variety of clinical signs

including conjunctivitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and polyarthritis [2,3]. BAVs are classified into ten serotypes [4]. The
serotypes of BAV-1, -2, -3, -9 and -10 belong to Mastadenovirus genus, and the serotypes of BAV-4, -5, -6, -7, and
-8 belong to Atadenovirus genus http://www.ictvdb.org.
These ten serotypes are also divided into two groups on
the basis of the differences in their biological and serological distinctiveness [4,5]. The members of subgroup 1
bovine adenoviruses (BAV-1, -2, -3, and -9) grow well in
established bovine cell lines and contain common complement-fixing antigens, which cross-react with the members

of other mastadenoviruses in the complement fixation
tests. However, the members of subgroup 2 (BAV-4, -5,
-6, -7, -8, and -10) do not cross-react with any other mammalian adenovirus in the complement fixation test and can
be propagated exclusively in low-passage cultures of calf
testicular or thyroid cells [6,7].
BAV-3, a member of subgroup 1, is considered one of
the important respiratory tract pathogens of cattle, particularly newborn calves [8]. Clinical signs include pyrexia, respiratory distress, and nasal and conjunctival
discharges. BAV-3 was firstly isolated by Darbyshire and
coworkers in Britain [9]. Like other adenoviruses, BAV3 is a nonenveloped icosahedral particle of 75-80 nm in
diameter and has a double-stranded linear genomic
DNA [10]. The E1, E3, and E4 regions and its complete
genome sequence of BAV-3 have been described
[6,11,12]. Serologic surveys indicated widespread distribution of BAV throughout the world. The detection,
isolation or serological evidence of BAV-3 has not been
reported in China. However, there were many cases in
cattle showing similar clinical signs to BAV-3 infection
in China in 2009. Then we made an attempt to isolate
the virus with nasal swabs from cattle in Heilongjiang
Province, China, and isolated a virus strain using
Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell cultures from
bovine nasal swabs. The virus isolate was further characterized for some biological properties, partial and the
complete genome sequencing for the isolate and phylogenetic analysis.

The immunofluorescence staining of the MDBK cells
inoculated with isolate HLJ0955 and control MDBK
cells with BAV-3 specific polyclonal antibody was also
done. The immunofluorescence was detected in the
cytoplasm of MDBK cells after inoculation with isolate
HLJ0955, but there was no immunofluorescence in control MDBK cells (data not shown). All of these results
demonstrated that the isolate HLJ0955 was BAV-3.
Morphological determination of strain HLJ0955 using
electric microscopy

Typical virions of approximately 75 nm in diameter
were observed in negative-stain preparations of MDBK
cells inoculated with the isolate HLJ0955 (Figure 1).
Full-length sequencing of newly isolated HLJ0955 strain

The complete genome sequence for HLJ0955 was determined. The entire DBP gene sequence in E2A region and
the complete genome sequence of HLJ0955 analyzed in
this work were deposited in GenBank under following
accession number: JN381195. The complete genome of
isolate HLJ0955 is 34,132 nucleotides (nt) in length,
which is 314 bases shorter than the previously identified
BAV-3 strain WBR-1 genome (34,446 nt). The sequence
of the Chinese BAV-3 isolate HLJ0955 has a G+C

Results
BAV-3 isolation and confirmation

Nasal swabs collected from a group of feedlot cattle with
acute respiratory disease were inoculated into cultures of
MDBK cells, and the third passage of one specimen
caused obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) in MDBK cells.
Compared with normal control MDBK cells, the MDBK
cells inoculated with the specimen rounded up and cytoplasmic bridges formed after an incubation period of five
days (data not shown). The CPE caused by the specimen
was similar to that caused by a BAV-3 isolate FSO-213
[13]. The virus isolate was designated as HLJ0955.
Viral genomic DNA was extracted from the culture
supernatant inoculated with isolate HLJ0955 and amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the specific primers E2Afwd and E2Aseq1 for BAV-3. Fragment consistent with the expected size of 644 bp (base pair) was
obtained from the amplification of isolate HLJ0955 (data
not shown), which caused typical CPE in MDBK cells. The
amplified product was purified, cloned and sequenced.
Blast search revealed that the sequence of the amplified
fragment was related to BAV-3 with 95% nucleotide
identity.

content of 53.6%, which is similar to the G+C content of
the prototype of BAV-3 WBR-1 strain (54.0%). The
region, name, coding sequence (CDS) and length of
genes of Chinese BAV-3 HLJ0955 strain were summarized in Table 1. To further characterize the molecular
structure of the HLJ0955 genome and to determine how
it is related to the prototype of BAV-3 WBR-1 strain, we
compared the nucleotide and putative amino acid
sequences of BAV-3 HLJ0955 strain with those of BAV-3
WBR-1 strain retrieved from GenBank (Table 1). The
full-length nucleotide homology between HLJ0955 and
WBR-1 strains was 70.2%. The CDS for gene regions of
HLJ0955 isolate were similar to the prototype of BAV-3
WBR-1 strain, with 80.0-98.6% nucleotide and 87.598.8% amino acid identities (Table 1).

Adenovirus subtyping using DBP gene

A phylogenetic tree constructed with the full-length genomes of different adenoviruses showed that HLJ0955
strain clustered with BAV-3 WBR-1 strain with 100%
bootstrap value and also clustered within Mastadenovirus
genus with some adenoviruses with 100% bootstrap value
(Figure 2A). The other adenoviruses contained in phylogenetic tree created from the full-length genome data
clustered within four different genuses of Adenoviridae
family, namely Mastadenovirus, Aviadenovirus, Atadenovirus and Siadenovirus genuses, respectively and their
branching patterns were in agreement with presently
accepted classification of four different genuses of the
family Adenoviridae. Meanwhile, a phylogenetic analysis
was performed with the entire coding sequence of DBP

Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome was created using the complete genome sequence of the HLJ0955 isolate in
this work, and 14 BAVs and adenovirus reference strains from other animals or human beings retrieved from GenBank (A, the
complete genome). Phylogenetic analysis of the DBP gene was created using the nucleotide sequences of the Chinese BAV-3 isolate HLJ0955
in this work, and 22 BAVs and adenovirus reference strains from other animals or human beings retrieved from GenBank (B, DBP gene). The
phylogenetic tree was prepared using the Neighbor-Joining method and bootstrap testing. Numbers over branches indicate the percentage of

gene in E2A region (Figure 2B). The analysis showed that
HLJ0955 strain clustered with BAV-3 WBR-1 strain with
100% bootstrap value and also clustered within Mastadenovirus genus with some adenoviruses with 100% bootstrap value. The other adenoviruses contained in
phylogenetic tree created from the DBP gene nucleotide
data clustered within four different genuses of Adenoviridae family and their branching patterns were also in
agreement with presently accepted classification of four
different genuses of the family Adenoviridae. These analysis results showed that the phylogenetic tree created
from the DBP gene nucleotide data was in agreement
with the phylogenetic tree created from the complete
genome sequence.

Discussion
A virus strain, showing cytopathic effect in MDBK cells,
was isolated from a bovine nasal swab collected from
feedlot cattle in Heilongjiang Province, China in 2009.
The isolate was confirmed as a bovine adenovirus type 3
by PCR and immunofluorescence assay, and named as
HLJ0955. As well, typical virions were observed in negative-stain preparations of MDBK cells inoculated with
the isolate HLJ0955 (Figure 1). To date, only the complete genome sequence of prototype of BAV-3 WBR-1
strain has been reported. In order to further analyze the
Chinese BAV-3 isolate HLJ0955, the complete genome
sequence for HLJ0955 was determined. Compared with
the prototype of BAV-3 WBR-1 strain, the genome of
BAV-3 HLJ0955 strain contains 16 regions and four
deletions in inverted terminal repeats (ITR), E1B region
and E4 region, respectively. The ITR of isolate HLJ0955
is 85 nt in length, which is 110 bases shorter than the
previously identified BAV-3 strain WBR-1 ITR (195 nt).
A 46 bp deletion occurs in ITR from the left end of the
HLJ0955 genome, which is corresponding to the nt 132
to 182 from the left end of the WBR-1 genome. As well,
another 85 bp deletion also occurs in ITR from the left
end of the HLJ0955 genome, which is corresponding to
the nt 34282 to 34366 from the left end of the WBR-1
genome. Whether or not the deletions in ITR of
HLJ0955 affect virus replication need further investigations. Interestingly, a 72 bp internal deletion in the left
inverted terminal repeat of the bovine adenovirus type 3
mutant BAV3c29 was also found and did not affect
virus replication [14]. A 35 bp deletion occurs in E1B
region, which is corresponding to the nt 1370 to 1404
from the left end of the WBR-1 genome. The deletion
in E1B region did not affect the coding region of E1B
product of HLJ0955. The last 145 bp deletion immediately in E4 open reading frame (ORF) 1 region, which is
corresponding to the nt 33471 to 33615 from the left
end of the WBR-1 genome. Compared with the prototype of BAV-3 WBR-1 strain, the deleted nucleotides of

Page 5 of 8

BAV-3 HLJ0955 strain are totally 311 bp. The deletion
in E4 ORF1 region caused minor changes of the ORF1
product of HLJ0955. The E4 region of BAV-3 lies near
the right end of the genome (nt 30932c to 33950c) and
consists of five ORFs [6]. The proteins encoded by the
E4 region are involved at several levels of regulation of
cellular and viral gene expression, viral DNA replication,
late viral assembly, E2 expression, and adeno-associated
virus helper function [15-18]. It has been suggested that
individual ORFs of the BAV-3 E4 can be deleted and
are nonessential for viral replication [19]. But the deletion of HLJ0955 strain in E4 region did not result in any
deletion of five ORF products of HLJ0955 strain.
To better understand the genetic relationships and
evolution of HLJ0955 strain with other adenoviruses,
phylogenetic analysis were performed with the fulllength genomes and entire coding sequence of DBP
gene in E2A region of different adenoviruses. The analysis showed that HLJ0955 strain clustered with BAV-3
WBR-1 strain with 100% bootstrap value and also clustered within Mastadenovirus genus with some adenoviruses with 100% bootstrap value (Figure 2A and 2B).
The other adenoviruses contained in phylogenetic tree
clustered within four different genuses of Adenoviridae
family and their branching patterns were in agreement
with presently accepted classification of four different
genuses of the family Adenoviridae. These results indicated that the phylogenetic tree created from subgenomic data of the DBP gene nucleotide sequences was
in agreement with the phylogenetic tree created from
the complete genome sequences. As well, phylogenetic
reconstruction with DBP gene nucleotide data of human
adenovirus also provided meaningful inferences in molecular characterization of human adenoviruses [20]. The
determinations of phylogenetic relationships by comparisons of sequence data play a major role in the classification of viruses within a particular genus in addition to
serological tests [6]. The phylogenetic analysis results
presented in this study supported the use of the DBP
gene of adenovirus as an appropriate subgenomic target
for the classification of different genuses of the family
Adenoviridae on the molecular basis. These results may
provide insight into the molecular properties of
HLJ0955 strain and open a new way to further studies.
The isolation of BAV-3 has not been reported prior to
this study in China. An important factor with bovine
adenovirus isolation is that a fairly large number of
serial blind passages of the material is often necessary
before a characteristic CPE begins to develop [13]. We
have collected numerous nasal swabs from feedlot cattle
with acute respiratory disease and finally succeeded to
isolate the HLJ0955 strain in 2009. Bovine respiratory
disease complex (BRDC) is a major problem for cattle
and it continues to cause serious economic losses for

Zhu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:557
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/557

the global cattle industry. The causes of BRDC are multiple and complex, but the three factors of stress, viral
infection and bacterial infection are almost always
involved in cases of severe disease. From Autumn in
2008 on, it was reported that a few herds of calves
showed acute respiratory disease after a long distance
transportation for sales in China. The sick calves were
treated with antibiotics, but recovered very slowly and
some of them died. Then viral agents were suspected
for involvement in the calf pneumonia and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 and bovine viral diarrhea virus
were detected [21,22]. However, the viral agents
involved in BRDC still need further investigations in
China. This is the first report about the detection and
isolation of BAV-3 in China. On the basis of this work,
a broad pathogen epidemiological investigation of BAV3 might be carried out and serological methods would
be established for detecting antibodies against BAV-3 in
China. Vaccine for BAV-3 might be developed using the
new isolate HLJ0955 of BAV-3. All of these efforts
would greatly improve the investigations on BRDC in
China. On the other hand, recombinant BAV-3 is being
developed as a live vector for animal vaccination and for
human gene therapy [12,23]. Therefore the BAV-3 strain
HLJ0955 might be developed as an appropriate expression vector.

Conclusions
This is the first study to report the isolation and molecular characterization of BAV-3 from cattle in China.
The phylogenetic analysis performed in this study supported the use of the DNA binding protein gene of adenovirus as an appropriate subgenomic target for the
classification of different genuses of the family Adenoviridae on the molecular basis. Meanwhile, a large-scale
pathogen and serological epidemiological investigations
for BVA-3 infection might be carried out in cattle in
China. This report will be a good beginning for further
studies on BAV-3 in China.
Materials and methods
Preparation of samples and virus isolation

Nasal swabs from feedlot cattle with acute respiratory
disease were collected from Heilongjiang Province,
China in 2009. The swabs were centrifuged for 5 min at
800 × g and the supernatant fluids were used for virus
isolation. MDBK cells were grown in minimum essential
medium (MEM, GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat
inactivated fetal bovine serum (BIOCHROM AG, German). The supernatants of nasal swabs (100 μl) were
inoculated into each well of MDBK cells cultured in 24well cell culture plates and incubated for 1 h at 37°C.
Then the inoculations were discarded and 500 μl MEM

Page 6 of 8

supplemented with 4% heat inactivated fetal bovine
serum were added. The cell cultures were frozen and
thawed three times and passaged three to five times at
seven days interval. Harvest the cell cultures by freezing
and thawing them for three times when CPE appeared
in monolayer of MDBK cells. Then the isolates were
further identified.
PCR detection and nucleotide sequence analysis

Oligonucleotide primers for BAV-3 detection and identification were designed from the DNA binding protein (DBP)
gene sequence in E2A region of BAV-3 strain WBR-1
(GenBank accession number AF030154). The sequence of
two pairs of primers, designed E2Afwd and E2Aseq1, was
located in E2A region of BAV-3. The primers E2Afwd (5’GAG ATG GAT GTG AAC AGC GA-3’) and E2Aseq1
(5’-ACA TTC TGA TGC TGG TAC TG-3’) amplified an
approximately 644 bp product from the BAV-3 DNA.
Viral genomic DNA was extracted from 500 μl of
infected culture supernatant containing 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K (AMRESCO, USA) and 0.5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, which was incubated at 37°C for two hours. The
digested solution was extracted once with phenol and
twice with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The
extracted DNA was precipitated by the addition of two
volumes of absolute ethanol, recovered by centrifugation,
and dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4) and 1 mM EDTA). The dissolved DNA was
used as a template for PCR. The amplification of viral
DNA by PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.4), 50 mM KCl, 3 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTP, 200 pmol of each primer E2Afwd
and E2Aseq1, 10 μl extracted DNA and 2.5 U EX Taq
DNA polymerase (Takara). The reaction was heated in a
thermocycle for 3 min at 93°C and then submitted to 30
cycles of amplification. The conditions of amplification
were 45 s at 95°C, 50 s at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C. The
final extension step was done at 72°C for 10 min.
The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis
in 1.5% agarose gel in Tris-acetate EDTA buffer and the
expected band was excised and recovered from the agarose gel using the Watson gel extraction kit (Watson,
China). The purified PCR product was ligated into the
pGEM-T vector (Promega) using T/A cloning, and the
competent Escherichia coli strain DH5a was transformed with the ligation products following the manufacturer’s instruction. The positive colonies (three of
each sample), screened by blue-white color reaction on
X-gal containing plates, were sequenced with the M13+
and M13- sequencing primers. DNA sequencing was
performed on an ABI automated A373 sequencer.
Sequences were identified using the BLAST search program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi.

Electron microscope observation

MDBK cells infected with the virus isolate were harvested by freezing and thawing for three times. One ml
of the harvested cell cultures was centrifuged for 5 min
at 800 × g. The supernatant was transferred into a new
eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,400 ×
g. Then make negative-stain preparations for transmission electron microscope observation. The observed virions were photographed and analyzed.
Identification of the isolate by immunofluorescent assay

MDBK cell monolayer grown on 96-well cell culture
plates was fixed in 80% chilled acetone for 20 min about
36 h after virus inoculation. After washing out excess
unbound reagent with phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
the fixed cells were incubated with anti-BAV-3 polyclonal antibody conjugated to FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) (VMRD Inc., USA) at 37°C for 30 min in a
humid chamber. After washing with PBS, the cells were
examined by fluorescence microscope.
Sequence analysis of the complete genome for HLJ0955
isolate and phylogenetic analysis

To further characterize the Chinese isolate HLJ0955,
the complete genome sequence for isolate HLJ0955
was determined. Forty-two primer sets were designed
to amplify overlapping regions of the complete BAV-3
strain HLJ0955 genome. The amplified fragments were
harvested and sequenced as described for the E2A
region. The complete HLJ0955 genome sequence was
compiled from overlapping sequences of the HLJ0955
amplicons. Comparative analysis with the BAV-3 strain
WBR-1 genome sequence from GenBank was used to
identify coding regions, and putative amino acid
sequences were created following BLASTX search routines. Nucleotide and putative amino acid sequence
alignments were created using the computer program
DNAStar (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI) with BAV-3
strain WBR-1 sequence retrieved from GenBank
(Table 1).
Phylogenetic reconstructions for genetic analysis of the
Chinese isolate HLJ0955 were compiled using the complete genome sequence for the isolate HLJ0955 and
entire nucleotide coding sequence of DBP gene in E2A
region (nucleotide 21284c-22582c of BAV-3 strain WBR1 genome). Additional sequences from representative isolates of previously identified BAVs and adenoviruses
from other animals or human beings were included into
phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences were aligned
using the Clustal W program. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA
version 4.0 [24]. Bootstrap values were calculated on
1000 replicates of the alignment.
