Abstract
Background: In recent years, model based approaches such as maximum likelihood have become
the methods of choice for constructing phylogenies. A number of authors have shown the
importance of using adequate substitution models in order to produce accurate phylogenies. In the
past, many empirical models of amino acid substitution have been derived using a variety of different
methods and protein datasets. These matrices are normally used as surrogates, rather than deriving
the maximum likelihood model from the dataset being examined. With few exceptions, selection
between alternative matrices has been carried out in an ad hoc manner.
Results: We start by highlighting the potential dangers of arbitrarily choosing protein models by
demonstrating an empirical example where a single alignment can produce two topologically
different and strongly supported phylogenies using two different arbitrarily-chosen amino acid
substitution models. We demonstrate that in simple simulations, statistical methods of model
selection are indeed robust and likely to be useful for protein model selection. We have
investigated patterns of amino acid substitution among homologous sequences from the three
Domains of life and our results show that no single amino acid matrix is optimal for any of the
datasets. Perhaps most interestingly, we demonstrate that for two large datasets derived from the
proteobacteria and archaea, one of the most favored models in both datasets is a model that was
originally derived from retroviral Pol proteins.
Conclusion: This demonstrates that choosing protein models based on their source or method
of construction may not be appropriate.

Background
For a number of years phylogenetic construction has been

considered to be a problem of statistical inference. One of
the most popular methods of inferring phylogenetic rela-

tionships is maximum likelihood (ML). It has often been
considered that one of the advantages of ML over parsimony based methods is that it allows for the use of different models of evolution depending on the dataset being
examined. Therefore knowing the process of evolution
and being able to construct realistic models of evolution
is the foundation for being able to infer accurate phylogenetic relationships among species. Currently one of the
major challenges in phylogenetics is to accurately model
the process of nucleotide or amino acid substitution and
to choose among our set of models in order to infer accurate phylogenies. Felsenstein [1] was the first to show in
simulations that overly simplistic models that underestimate multiple substitutions can result in inconsistency
during phylogeny estimation in certain situations
(referred to as the 'Felsenstein zone'). Further simulation
studies have shown that even when using ML analysis,
underestimation of nucleotide substitutions (as assumed
by simpler models) leads to long-branch attraction and
inconsistency in the Felsenstein zone [2,3]. These results
have also been duplicated in real datasets where the use of
inadequate models can lead to long-branch attraction
[4,5]. However it was also shown in simulations that violations of the model can also favour the true tree in certain
situations (often referred to as the 'Farris zone' or 'inverseFelsenstein zone') [6,7]. It was later shown in simulations
and real data that this can only happen in a very limited
number of cases and in general using overly simplistic
models should be avoided [3,7,8]. One fact that is most
certainly true is that the accurate estimation of node support is strongly affected by the use of simplistic models in
simulated and real datsets [9,10]. It is clear that unless we
can be totally sure that a dataset fits into one of the categories mentioned above, then the use of overly simplistic
(or incorrect) substitution models can negatively bias our
phylogenies.

matrix with large datasets and the risk of overfitting the
matrix parameters when analysing small datasets has
meant that most phylogeny programs rely on empirical
models of protein evolution. Dayhoff et al. [12] were the
first to develop a general model of amino acid substitution using the limited amount of sequence data available
at the time. Since then, several additional models have
been developed from other datasets and using different
techniques, such as maximum parsimony and maximum
likelihood [13-22].

Almost all models of amino acid replacement assume that
all amino acids sites evolve independently according to
the same Markov process. It is assumed that the Markov
process is stationary and homogeneous, so that all rates of
substitution are constant across time. Each of the protein
substitution models consists of a 20 × 20 instantaneous
rate matrix which includes the set of original amino acid
frequencies (πi) obtained from the dataset that was used
to generate the model. The (πi) values represent the equilibrium or stationary frequencies of the 20 amino acids
and the matrices are often modified to include the set of
observed frequencies in the dataset being examined. Models that take into account the observed amino acid frequencies are often denoted by the '+F' suffix [11]. If we
assume that the substitution process is reversible then the
number of free parameters is reduced to from 399 to 189.
However due the computational burden imposed by optimising all 189 free parameters of the instantaneous rate

Until now many phylogenetic analyses of multiple datasets from a fixed set of taxa have assumed a single substitution model for all sets of homologs (e.g. [31-33]). We
argue that if it is assumed that a single amino acid matrix
is the best-fit matrix for all genes in a dataset, then there is
the possibility that the method may encounter situations
like the one mentioned previously and produce suboptimal phylogenies. We have performed experiments using
real datasets in order to determine if it is correct to build
phylogenies from different genes using the same amino
acid matrix. This issue has never been examined before
and our results show a large differences in best-fit protein
models within all of the datasets analysed. The results presented in this paper raise the question of whether we
should be performing full protein model selection analyses prior to any amino acid phylogeny estimation.

There has been a great deal of research into various techniques for performing model selection on nucleotide data
[23]. In the past, three measures have been used to select
the best-fit substitution model. The hierarchical likelihood ratio test (hLRT) consists of a tree hierarchy where
the best-fit model is selected by performing a number of
pairwise likelihood ratio tests and navigating the tree to
arrive at the final model [24]. However the hLRT is only
suitable for models which can be defined as subsets of
each other, therefore is generally only applied to nucleotide model selection. For example, the F81 model [25] is
a subset of the HKY model [26] with the transition and
transversion rates set to be equal. As the different amino
acid matrices do not have any free parameters, it is not
possible to define a similar tree hierarchy as with nucleotide models. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) [27]
and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [28] belong to a
different class of model selection measures that compare
all of the models simultaneously according to some measure of fitness. Although these measures have been used for
many years in nucleotide model selection, only recently
have programs such as MODELGENERATOR [29] and
Prottest [30] been specifically developed to perform statistical analyses of the complete set of available amino acid
substitution models.

Results
To investigate the potentially harmful effects of a non-statistical approach to choosing protein models, we built two
phylogenies with two arbitrarily selected protein models
using a single gene family alignment consisting of 7 taxa
(3580 characters in length) taken from the dataset of
Philip et al. [34]. Figure 1 shows how it is possible to

obtain two different tree topologies both with equally
high bootstrap support by arbitrarily choosing the protein
substitution model. In situations like this, the high bootstrap support values of both trees might indicate that
either one of these alternate trees is optimal. However,
bootstrap values can be misleading (as bootstrapping is
performed using the same model that was used to con-

struct the phylogeny) and cannot be used to infer information about the suitability of the substitution model [9].
Therefore without detailed prior knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships or first determining the best-fit
model from the set of available models, it is difficult to
determine the optimal ML tree.

the model of amino acid substitution is suspected to follow a particular matrix (due to the source of the data) in
order to test the accuracy of the selection method. We then
examined the extent of amino acid matrix variation
among three large sets of orthologs from each of the
Domains of Life.

The likelihood is calculated as the probability of obtaining the data (multiple sequence alignment) given the
model of evolution (substitution model and phylogeny).
Ideally we would prefer to use the true tree when performing our model selection as this would remove any conflicting signals from an incorrect base tree. However on
real datasets the true tree is unknown so we must use
some approximation of the true tree for the model selection procedure in order to estimate the model parameters
[35]. In the following sections, we provide the results of
simulations to investigate the effects of using varying base
trees, alignments lengths, among-site rate variation
(ASRV) parameters, and amino acid frequencies in amino
acid alignments on the selection of protein models. For all
of the simulations, we used the same 20 taxon clocklike
tree (see Figure 2) used by Posada and Crandall [36] to
generate our simulated alignments. We also took a
number of previously published real datasets for which

Base tree sensitivity
The results of the simulations using different base trees
(true, random, and NJ-JTT tree) for the model selection
procedure are presented in Table 1. The most important
observation from the table is that the recovery rates are
significantly reduced for almost all models when a random tree is used compared to either the true tree or the NJ
tree. However there is one notable exception to this where
many of the +I+G alignments display slightly higher
recovery rates with a random tree than with either the true
tree or NJ tree. Further analysis of our results (not shown)
shows that this appears to be due to the fact that when a
random tree is used, the model selection procedure tends
to generally favour over-parameterised models which is
consistent with the findings of a previous study on nucleotide sequences [37]. There is very little difference
between using the true tree and an NJ tree which confirms
previous findings for nucleotides that a relatively good

tree is sufficient for estimating accurate model parameters
[35,38,39]. It is also very interesting to note that the correct amino acid matrix was selected in almost every case
(data not shown) regardless of the base tree, indicating
that the only area of uncertainty in these simulations is
the correct choice of ASRV.
We next examined the difference in the models selected
using the likelihood values from the quick NJ-JTT base
tree and those of fully optimised ML phylogenies produced using all of the individual models (see methods).

There is very little difference (<10%) between the model
selection accuracy when model selection was carried out
using a full ML tree search using each available model and
the models selected by the quicker NJ-JTT method (see
Table 2). For the proteobacteria dataset, the NJ-JTT model
selection procedure differed to the full ML analysis selections in fewer than 7% of cases, with most of the different
selections being due to selecting the same amino acid rate
matrix and different ASRV parameters. The NJ-JTT model
selection procedure and ML analysis achieved closer to
full agreement in the archaea dataset, where the model

predictions given by the two procedures differed in fewer
than 5% of cases. There was a similar pattern with the vertebrate dataset where the NJ-JTT model selection procedure differed in fewer than 9% of cases compared to the
full ML analysis procedure. Table 2 shows that in the
majority of cases where different models were selected,
the same amino acid matrix was selected with the difference being due to different selections of optimal ASRV
parameters.
Sequence length
One of the factors that is believed to affect the results of
the nucleotide model selection is sequence length [36].
We wanted to investigate what effect (if any) sequence
length would have on amino acid model selection by performing the model selection procedure on varying length
alignments. Table 3 shows the recovery rates of each of the
three measures (AIC1, AIC2, and BIC) for the three different alignment lengths (100, 500, and 1000 characters). As
expected, the rates for the longer sequences are increased
compared to the shorter sequences. One noticeable feature with the 100 character dataset is that the number of
times the correct model was selected when a +I+G ASRV
was present was significantly reduced for all matrices. Fur-

ther examination of the results shows that this is almost
always due to the model selection procedure picking the
+G version of the model. This is due to the fact that the
difference in likelihoods between the +I+G and +G models is quite small at short sequence lengths and not significant enough for the measures to prefer the more
parameterised +I+G models. In these cases, we have
observed that the α parameter of the gamma distribution
is generally estimated to be less than 0.2 in order to
accommodate the invariable sites. When the sequence
length is increased to 1000 characters, the difference
between the likelihoods of the +G and +I+G models
increases and is enough for the model selection measures
to prefer the +I+G models. As the BIC takes into account
sample size (sequence length), it is not affected to the
same extent by this phenomenon (see Table 3). Again the
correct amino acid substitution matrix was selected in
almost every case regardless of sequence length (data not
shown).
Among-site rate variation parameters
ASRV parameters can vary greatly in real datasets therefore
it is important to investigate if the model selection procedure is affected in any way by varying ASRV's. Table 4

shows the results of the simulations where the gamma
shape parameter was varied. The most noticeable trend in
the table is the reduction in recovery rates of the +G simulations with higher values of α. A closer examination of
the results shows that this is due to the model selection
measures incorrectly selecting the +I+G ASRV where the
true ASRV is +G. It is quite noticeable that the BIC is the
least affected measure as it associates a much higher cost
for adding more parameters to the model than either of
the AIC metrics. Therefore we attribute this reduction in
accuracy to be a property of the AIC. This phenomenon is
also matched by better results in the +I+G simulations as
the values of α are increased. This increase in accuracy is
consistent with our earlier result (the gamma parameter
being significantly reduced in order to incorporate invariable sites at the short sequence length) meaning that at
high values of α, such as 1.0 or 2.0, the separate invariable
sites parameter is explicitly required by the model to
account for the proportion of invariable sites. Just like in
the previous tables, the correct amino acid matrix was
selected in almost every case.
Amino acid frequency perturbation
Each of the protein substitution models consists of an
instantaneous rate matrix (Q) which includes a set of original amino acid frequencies (πi) obtained from the dataset
that was used to generate the model. If we use the
observed amino acid frequency parameters of the dataset
being examined (denoted by the '+F' suffix) instead, then
we include 19 extra free parameters when evaluating each
model. We were interested in investigating what effect the
change in amino acid frequency proportions would have
on the model selection procedure and whether the corresponding '+F' versions of the models would be selected.
We would expect our model selection procedure to be
robust enough to select the corresponding amino acid
matrix despite the variation in amino acid frequencies.
Table 5 shows that when the original model amino acid

frequencies were randomly perturbed, there was a definite
trend among all of the model selection measures to select
the corresponding '+F' version of the particular model
over the original models. The recovery rates are extremely
high across all categories with only a few exceptions.
When amino acid frequencies deviate from the default
amino acid frequencies of a particular model, there is a
trend towards the '+F' version of the same model.
Expected model selections
Some of the amino acid substitution matrices were developed specifically for use with certain types of datasets. For
example, the MtREV [15] and MtMam [16] models were
developed from different mitochondrial datasets. The
RtREV matrix was developed specifically for use with retroviral and reverse transcriptase datasets [19]. Indeed the
RtREV authors presented a study showing how the RtREV
matrix consistently produced higher likelihoods than
other matrices such as JTT and WAG for specific datasets.
Consequently it is expected that these matrices will perform quite well during model selection when applied to
datasets of similar origin to the original datasets used to
develop these models. The results of the model selection
procedure for a number of datasets where the substitution
process is known are outlined in Table 6. We have provided a column that describes the expected amino acid
matrix (based on previously published information on
each of the alignments). It is clear that there is a noticeable
bias in each of the datasets towards some form of the
expected amino acid matrix.
Model variation among multi-gene datasets
Figure 3 shows that for the 2135 proteobacteria orthologs
the WAG matrix was selected for approximately 46% of
the genes, the RtREV matrix was optimal for the second
largest proportion (21%), and a large number of other
models best described the other 33% of the genes. The
vertebrate dataset (Figure 4) displays a different pattern to

the bacterial dataset with the JTT matrix making up 57%
of the best-fit models and the WAG matrix making up a
much smaller proportion (19%) of models. The most
dominant substitution matrix in the archaea dataset (Figure 5) is the RtREV matrix (33%) with the WAG (29%)
matrix close behind with the rest of the genes fitting a
selection of other models. It is interesting to note the
default scoring model used by ClustalW (Blosum62) to
align the sequences did not feature very often in the set of
optimal matrices. This suggests that the scoring model
used for the alignment procedure does not bias the selection of the optimal substitution matrix. A global examination of the figures shows that no single model emerges
from the rankings as the overall best overall model for any
of the datasets.

Model selection and tree accuracy
Table 7 shows that when we generated simulated alignments with one particular model and then built phylogenies using each of the other available models, the
Robinson-Foulds (RF) distances [40] were either equal or
worse than when we built phylogenies using the same
model that was used to generate the alignments. These
results show that in simulations the choice of protein
model has a definite effect the topology of the inferred
tree.

In real datasets, the true tree is unknown and therefore it
is impossible to know with certainty if we have found the
true tree. One possible indication as to whether the choice
of model is improving the inferred phylogenies might be
to take a large dataset of orthologs and measure the level

model and then phylogenies were built using all of the other available models. Each entry is the average scaled Robinson-Foulds (RF)
distance [40] over the trees inferred using the alternative models. This test was repeated 10 times for each model and the values in

of congruence among the inferred trees. It would be
expected that the congruence among the trees would
increase as the optimal models are used to build the trees.
We took our proteobacteria dataset (2135 orthologs) and
built phylogenies using fixed amino acid matrices and
also built phylogenies using the optimal protein model
for each alignment. Table 8 shows that for the proteobacteria dataset when the optimal models were used to infer
the trees, the median RF distance was lower than using a
fixed model in the majority of cases.

Discussion
We have studied the influence of various factors on protein model selection. Our simulations have confirmed
previous work showing that the model selection procedure performs quite accurately using an approximate tree
for model selection. One of the most interesting results
that we have shown using real datasets is that less than 9%
of the time was a different matrix selected using a full ML
analysis than those selected using a quick NJ-JTT method.
This further strengthens the recent results presented by
Sullivan et al. [38] showing that successive-approximation
methodologies to phylogeny estimation does not suffer

from any significant loss in accuracy. Our simulations
have also shown that protein model selection is not as
sensitive as nucleotide model selection to sequence length
differences. Recovery rates remain relatively constant over
different sequence lengths with the only exception to this
being at short sequence lengths when the difference in
likelihood values can result in an overly-simplistic model
being selected (+G instead of +I+G). We have also shown
that when amino acid frequencies deviate from the
default amino acid frequencies of each model, there is a

clear trend towards the '+F' version of each model. This
phenomenon was also observed in the results of the real
dataset analysis presented in Table 5 with many of the real
datasets being best described by '+F' versions of the
expected models. One constant trend across all of the simulations we have performed is that the correct amino acid
matrix is selected by both measures close to 100% of the
time regardless of factors such as base tree accuracy,
sequence length, ASRV variances, or amino acid frequencies.

It should be emphasized that many of the current set of
models of amino acid or nucleotide substitution make
many unrealistic assumptions such as reversibility, amino
acid composition stationarity, and homogeneous substitution rates. However much work is currently taking place
to develop methods to loosen many of these restrictions
[41-43]. While the focus of this work has been to demonstrate the usefulness of performing protein model selection, it must be stated that model selection measures can
only provide information on which of the given set of
models best-fits the data and cannot give any indication
of how close a particular model is to reality.

We have highlighted an example where two highly-supported and topologically different phylogenies were produced from the same alignment using two arbitrarily
selected amino acid substitution matrices (see Fig. 1). The
likelihood values of the two trees are -30722 for the
MtREV tree and -28996 for the WAG tree with the
extremely high bootstrap support values providing evidence that the observed trees are not due to a stochastic
error (e.g. the treesearch getting stuck in a local optima).
To further rule out any source of stochastic error, the corresponding likelihoods for the MtREV tree with the WAG
matrix is -29288 and -30959 for the WAG tree with the

MtREV matrix, thereby confirming that both matrices
favor different tree topologies. A tree constructed using
the optimal model for this alignment (RtREV+I+G+F)
agrees with the WAG tree. At first glance, our particular
example may seem slightly unrealistic as we have used a
mitochondrial model to construct a tree from nuclear
genes. However, as we have shown, one of the best models for proteobacterial and archaeal genes is frequently
(22% and 33% of the time respectively) a model that was
derived from retroviral Pol proteins. Therefore, ad hoc
model selection, even when using arguments about the
origin of the model (nuclear versus organelle, or some
such) are still ad hoc arguments. The maximum likelihood
principle suggests the use of the best of the available models and in some cases, the best performing model can be
surprising.
The results of our cross-domain substitution model analysis are interesting as there are noticeable differences in
the groups of models selected by each dataset with no single matrix emerging as the best for any of the datasets. The
large diversity of amino acid matrices cannot come as a
great surprise as it would seem intuitively unreasonable to
assume that a very large group of independently evolving
gene families from a fixed taxon set followed an identical
amino acid substitution pattern. Perhaps one of the most
significant findings is that the RtREV matrix [19] features
so prominently in both the proteobacteria and archaea
datasets. The WAG matrix [18], for instance was derived
from a globular protein dataset and was shown to produce
higher likelihood values in general, compared with the
JTT matrix for the dataset from which it was derived. This
seemed to indicate that choosing a matrix based upon the
method or the data used to derive the matrix might be a
good idea. However, our finding that for so many alignments from cellular life, the best matrix was derived from

viral sequences is surprising and the consequence is that
ad hoc arguments for choice of matrix may not reasonable.

Conclusion
In this study, we have analysed the ability of the AIC and
the BIC to select the appropriate evolutionary model in
cases where the model is known. We have shown that
both methods are suitable for this purpose. We have also
shown that none of the currently available models is universally preferred for all alignments and that there is considerable variation in the substitution process across
protein families. What we have not attempted to show is
that for any given alignment the selected model is the
actual model that gave rise to the observed data. However,
on the basis of our results we can speculate on the appropriateness of the models. Considering that a viral model is
one of the most preferred models for these cellular
sequences, perhaps none of the models are really capturing the data. The models are homogeneous across the tree
and this is likely to be a simplification. Therefore, even
though we have produced a robust method of model
selection, it is likely that the models themselves need to be
improved.

Methods
The AIC is a popular model selection measure that
attempts to strike a balance between the goodness-of-fit
and complexity of a model. The AIC is calculated by
AIC1 = -2 ln Li + 2Ni,

(1)

where Ni is the number of free parameters in model i and
Li is the likelihood value of model i. Posada and Crandall
[36] presented evidence to show that the more empirically
tuned AIC2 can sometimes be more accurate at determining the correct nucleotide substitution model. It is calculated by replacing the 2Ni term with 5Ni thus further

penalising models of greater complexity. The BIC is
another model selection measure and is equivalent to
selecting the model with the maximum posterior probability and is calculated from
BIC = -2 ln Li + Ni ln n,

(2)

where n is the sample size (sequence length). The AIC and
BIC select the best model by choosing the model with the
minimum criterion value. The main difference between
the three measures is that the AIC2 and BIC tend to select
simpler models than the AIC1 because they penalise the
addition of further model parameters more than the AIC1
[44]. If the models that rank highest for a given dataset all
include a certain ASRV parameter, then the AIC and BIC
will essentially become an ordering with respect to the
likelihood values.
We have recently developed a protein model selection
program called MODELGENERATOR [29]. It initially
constructs a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree using an arbitrary
model (default is Jukes-Cantor [45] for nucleotides and
JTT [14] for proteins) in order to get an initial base tree for
comparison of models. For each model examined, the
branch lengths of the tree and model parameters are optimised independently using the PAL library [46]. The program supports 10 amino acid matrices and 14 nucleotide
models with either a proportion of invariable sites (+I),
gamma shape ASRV (+G), combined invariable and
gamma distribution (+I+G), and for amino acids the
observed amino acid frequencies (+F). When all matrix
and ASRV permutations are considered, a total of 56
nucleotide and 80 protein models can be derived. In the
following subsections, we outline how we investigated the
effects of various properties of amino acid alignments on
the three non-nested model selection measures (AIC1,
AIC2, BIC) when applied to protein model selection. For
all of the simulations, we used the same 20 taxon clocklike tree used by Posada and Crandall [36] and the program Seq-Gen vl.3.2 [47] to generate all simulated protein
alignments. The presence or absence of a molecular clock
in the base tree has been shown to have a negligible effect
on the model selection procedure [36]. For all of the simulated and real data tests performed below, MODELGENERATOR was not constrained a priori and the full set of 80
protein models was examined during every execution.
Base tree sensitivity
In order to compare the sensitivity of protein model selection to the accuracy of the base tree, we generated 2400
individual alignments of 500 characters in length using
each of the protein models available in Seq-Gen (100
alignments per model) fixing the proportion of invariable
sites at 0.2 and the α parameter of the gamma distribution
to 0.5 where appropriate and then performed model

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/29

selection using three different base trees – the true tree, an
NJ-JTT tree, and a randomly generated tree.
To further investigate the effect of using a distance-based
tree for comparison rather than the fully optimised ML
tree of each model, we obtained three real datasets from
each of the Domains of life. The first dataset consists of
2135 gene families obtained from 25 complete proteobacteria genomes. The homologs were identified by performing all-against-all blast searches [48] of the 25 fully
completed genomes with an e-value cutoff of 10-7. The
sequences were aligned using ClustalW 1.81 [49] with the
parameters unchanged from their default settings. The
alignments were manually edited to remove badly aligned
areas and large gapped areas. The second dataset consisted
of amino acid sequences of 16 archaeal genomes retrieved
from the COGENT database [50] and one (Haloarcula
marismortui) from the NCBI. We identified gene families
where all members of the family were capable of identifying all other members of the family during database
searches (with an e-value cutoff of 10-7). Each of these
families consisted of between 4 and 16 taxa and were
aligned using ClustalW 1.81 using the default settings
[49]. The final dataset is a previously published set of 118
vertebrate gene families which included representatives of
all the major vertebrate groups obtained from the HOVERGEN database [51] with each alignment consisting of
between 4 and 58 taxa [52]. For each dataset, we took a
subset of 100 alignments and used Phyml [53] to construct fully optimised ML phylogenies with each of the
available protein models and recorded the final likelihood of each individual phylogeny. We limited the ML
analysis to 100 randomly-chosen alignments from each
dataset due to excessive execution times for the full ML
analyses. We took the final likelihood values produced by
Phyml and determined the best-fit model and then compared the selected models with those produced by the NJJTT model selection procedure.
Sequence length
We generated 100 replicate alignments of each of the protein models available in Seq-Gen consisting of 100, 500,
and 1000 characters in length. For these tests, we fixed the
proportion of invariable sites at 0.2 and the α parameter
of the gamma distribution to 0.5 where appropriate. We
performed model estimation using MODELGENERATOR
and recorded the model selected by each of the available
tests (AIC1, AIC2, BIC).
Rate-distribution parameters
In order to investigate the possible effect of varying ASRV
parameters, we generated a number of different simulated

eter of the gamma ASRV between 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 (corresponding to high, medium, and low rate heterogeneity).
Amino acid frequency perturbation
In order to create these simulated '+F' alignments, we took
the original amino acid frequencies of each model and
randomly perturbed each of the individual amino acid
frequencies by up to 10% change from its original value in
each model (ensuring that the summation of the new set
of frequencies remained 1.0) and then used Seq-Gen to
generate an alignment using the new set of amino acid frequencies according to the substitution process of the individual model (see algorithm in Figure 6). We generated a
total of 2400 alignments of each of the protein models
available in Seq-Gen (100 alignments per model) consisting of 500 characters in length in this way so that each
individual alignment has a unique set of amino acid frequencies. This analysis more accurately simulates real
datasets where the amino acid frequency proportions may
differ significantly from the corresponding best-fit
model's amino acid frequencies.
Expected model selection
We obtained the two primate mitochondrial datasets that
are included as example datasets in Paml 3.14 [54],
namely the files mtCDNApri.aa and mtCDNAape.nuc
(translated the nucleotide sequences to amino acids). We
also obtained the amino acid sequences of a recent study
examining congruence among mammalian mitochondrial and nuclear genes [55]. We downloaded a copy of

the complete test dataset used in the creation and testing
of the RtREV matrix [19]. We also obtained a Pol alignment from the 2003 HIV and SIV alignments database
[56] and performed model selection on all of the
sequences mentioned.
Model variation among empirical datasets
For this test, we used the full set of sequences from the
three real datasets of the each Domain of life (as described
above). We performed model prediction for each alignment in the datasets in order to assess the extent of model
differences within the gene families.
Model selection and tree accuracy
To test for the effect of ad hoc model selection on tree accuracy, we performed an analysis on both simulated and real
data. In the simulated analysis, we generated alignments
of 500 characters in length using all of the amino acid
matrices and rate distributions setting the proportion of
invariable sites to 0.3 and the α parameter of the gamma
distribution to 0.5 where appropriate. The base tree in Figure 2 was used to generate all alignments. We then analysed each alignment using all of the possible models
except the one used to generate the alignment. We
repeated this test 10 times for each model and computed
the average scaled RF distance [40] from all the inferred
trees to the true tree for each model. We then build phylogenies using the same model as was used to generate
each alignment and reported the RF distance to the true
tree also.

In an attempt to analyse the effect of ad hoc model selection on tree accuracy on real data, we took the proteobacteria dataset (2135 orthologs) and built phylogenies by
using each of the available models as a fixed model for the
entire dataset. We recorded the median and average of the
all-against-all RF distances of the trees using Clann v3.0.3
[57]. For all possible pairs of trees, Clann prunes the taxa
of the trees so that only the common taxa are left and then
computes the scaled RF distance.
