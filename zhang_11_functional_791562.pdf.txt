Abstract
Background: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionary conserved adaptive reaction for increasing
cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions. X-box-binding protein-1 (Xbp1) is a key
transcription factor of UPR that activates genes involved in protein folding, secretion, and degradation to restore ER
function. The UPR induced by ER stress was extensively studied in diseases linked to protein misfolding and
aggregations. However, in the porcine system, genes in the UPR pathway were not investigated. In this study, we
isolated and characterized the porcine Xbp1 (pXbp1) gene in ER stress using porcine embryonic fibroblast (PEF)
cells and porcine organs. ER stress was induced by the treatment of tunicamycin and cell viability was investigated
by the MTT assay. For cloning and analyzing the expression pattern of pXbp1, RT-PCR analysis and Western blot
were used. Knock-down of pXbp1 was performed by the siRNA-mediated gene silencing.
Results: We found that the pXbp1 mRNA was the subject of the IRE1a-mediated unconventional splicing by ER
stress. Knock-down of pXbp1 enhanced ER stress-mediated cell death in PEF cells. In adult organs, pXbp1 mRNA
and protein were expressed and the spliced forms were detected.
Conclusions: It was first found that the UPR mechanisms and the function of pXbp1 in the porcine system. These
results indicate that pXbp1 plays an important role during the ER stress response like other animal systems and
open a new opportunity for examining the UPR pathway in the porcine model system.

Background
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential cellular compartment for protein synthesis and maturation [1]. The
perturbation of ER functions such as disruption of Ca++
homeostasis, inhibition of protein glycosylation or disulfide bond formation, hypoxia, and bacteria infections
results in the accumulation of unfolded or mis-folded
proteins in ER lumen. To reduce the excessive misfolded protein loading, cells trigger unfolded protein
response (UPR) including the transient attenuation of
protein translation, the degradation of mis-folded proteins, and the induction of molecular chaperones and
protein folding enzymes [1]. In severe ER stress, UPR

results in cell death through the activation of apoptotic
pathways [2].
Three distinct UPR signaling pathways exist in mammalian cells that include ER transmembrane inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK),
and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pwthways
[3]. The evolutionary conserved IRE1 in the UPR pathway plays as a Ser/Thr protein kinase and endoribonuclease [4,5]. Upon the activation of IRE1a by ER stress,
the endonuclease domain of IRE1 splices the XBP1
mRNA and removes 26 base pairs from the full-length
XBP1 mRNA by the unconventional splicing. This event
results in the conversion of the premature unspliced
XBP1 protein (XBP1u, 267 amino acids) to the spliced
XBP1 protein (XBP1s, 371 amino acids) by the frame
shift. XBP1s induces a subset of UPR target genes
related to protein quality control, ER translocation, glycosylation, and ER/Golgi biogenesis [1,6].

UPR has been intensively studied in various model
systems including mice and human cell lines. However,
the UPR pathway and its components have not yet been
elucidated in the porcine model system. Pigs are an
important resource in biomedical research because they
are more similar to humans than the rodent model
[7,8]. Therefore, pigs have wide implications for studying human diseases such as diabetes obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases [9-11]. In addition,
transgenic pigs are used as the bioreactor for the production of various growth hormones used in human
medicine [12]. Organs from cloned pigs produced by
the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can be used in
xenotransplantation [13-15].
In this study, we report the function of pXbp1, the
porcine ortholog of the human Xbp1, in ER stress. The
unconventional splicing of pXbp1 mRNA is evolutionary
conserved. In the RNA interference-mediated pXbp1
knock-down, we found that the pXbp1 participated in
ER stress-mediated cell death through the regulation of
the target gene expression. We also detected the spliced
pXbp1S mRNA and protein in adult organs of pigs.

Results
Tunicamycin induces UPR in PEF cells

Tunicamycin (TM), which inhibits N-linked glycosylation in newly synthesized polypeptide, induces ER stress
[16]. We tested whether the treatment of TM triggers
ER stress-induced cell death in porcine embryonic fibroblast (PEF) cells. When cells were treated with TM for
24 h, we detected the morphological changes and the
reduction of cell numbers (Figure 1A). The effect of TM
on ER stress-mediated cell death was also detected by
the morphological changes of apoptotic nuclei and the
activity of caspase-3 (Additional file 1, Fig. S1). In addition, the cell viability was significantly decreased from
12 h in TM treated cells. The cell death was time and
dose-dependent (Figure 1B).
To access whether ER stress response is activated in
PEF cells by the TM treatment, we measured the
expression levels of a ER stress marker BiP [17] and the
activation of three major ER stress sensors IRE1a,
PERK, and ATF6 with the Western blot analysis. BiP
protein expression was significantly up-regulated from 3
h (Figure 1C). IRE1a and ATF6 were activated from 3 h
and PERK was activated from 6 h after TM treatment
(Figure 1D). These results indicate that ER stress
induces unfolded protein response in PEF cells.
Cloning and sequence analysis of porcine Xbp1

We focused on the IRE1a-Xbp1 pathway of UPR in this
study and cloned the porcine Xbp1 gene (GenBank accession number FJ213449.1) as described in Materials and
Methods. Porcine Xbp1 mRNA has two open reading

Page 2 of 11

frames (ORF) composed of 792 bp and 1137 bp which are
alternatively produced by the IRE1a-mediated unconventional splicing (Figure 2A). Notably, 26 nucleotide
sequences, splicing sites by IRE1a, within Xbp1 ORF and
its flanking sequence are identical with those of the human
Xbp1 sequences. When the secondary structures of pXbp1
sequence around the IRE1a cleavage sites were predicted
using CentroidFOLD [18], the consensus cleavage sites
were located in the loop-portion (Figure 2B and 2C). The
amino acid sequences of the pXBP1 protein show significant homology with hXBP1 including the conserved basic
leucine zipper (bZIP) region. The amino acid similarity was
89% between pXBP1 and hXBP1 (Figure 2D). Phylogenetic
tree of XBP1 sequences from various organisms was generated using the neighbor-joining method. The phylogenetic
tree showed that the pXBP1 is a closer match to the
human XBP1 (Accession No. NM_005080, 85% amino acid
identity) rather than that of a rat (Accession No. JC4857,
83% amino acid identity) or a mouse (Accession No.
NP_038870, 80% amino acid identity) (Figure 2E).
Unconventional splicing of the porcine Xbp1

To elucidate whether IRE1a-mediated splicing of pXbp1
mRNA was triggered by ER stress like a human Xbp1
mRNA, PEF cells were treated with TM and performed
the RT-PCR analysis. The spliced form of pXbp1 product
(pXbp1S) was detected in the TM treated cells from 3 h.
The spliced pXbp1 mRNA level was significantly
increased during ER stress (Figure 3A). In the Western
blot analysis, the expression level of the activated pXbp1
protein (Xbp1S) significantly up-regulated by the TM
treatment from 3 h which is consistent with the RT-PCR
analysis (Figure 3B). These results indicate that pXbp1
mRNA is processed upon ER stress and can be used as a
major marker for UPR response in the porcine system.
Nuclear localization of pXbp1 and ERAI vector system in
PEF cells

XBP1 belongs to a bZIP transcription factor. When cells
are challenged with ER stress, activated XBP1 enters into
the nucleus for activating its target genes [19]. When we
tested the localization of XBP1 in the TM treated PEF
cells by the immunostaining, pXBP1 was predominantly
localized in the nucleus after 6 h (Figure 4A).
Recently Iwawaki et al [20] reported the ER stressactivated indicator (ERAI) vector system for monitoring
ER stress with the green fluorescence protein (GFP). In
the ERAI plasmid, human Xbp-1-Venus fusion construct
contains the partial sequence of the human XBP1 and a
GFP variant (Venus) sequence. Upon ER stress, 26
nucleotides of human Xbp1 are spliced out and the
XBP1-Venus fusion protein is produced. To test
whether ERAI works as an indicator for ER stress in the
porcine system, we checked the GFP signal in the ERAI

control siRNA transfected cells (Additional file 2, Fig.
S2). In addition, we performed the Western blot analysis
using the Xbp-1 antibody in pXbp-1 knock-down PEF
cells. Active and inactive Xbp-1 proteins were significantly decreased in pXbp1 knock-down cells compared
with the control siRNA transfected cells (Additional file
3, Fig. S3). pXbp1 knock-down cells displayed decreased
cell viability compared with the control siRNA transfected cells (Figure 5A). To further support the role of
pXbp1 in survival during ER stress, we compared the
number of apoptotic cells in the control siRNA and
pXbp1 siRNA transfected PEF cells by the TUNEL staining. In pXbp1 knock-down cells, TUNEL positive cells
increased about 10-fold compared with the control
(Additional file 4, Fig. S4). These results indicate that
the knock-down of pXbp1 is more sensitive to ER
stress-induced apoptosis, which is consistent with the
published data in human myeloma cells [21].
Xbp1 activates its UPR target genes for maintaining the
ER function and suppressing ER stress-induced cell
death. The inhibition of Xbp1 activity by the dominant
negative Xbp1 or knock-down Xbp1 markedly reduces
the expression of Xbp1 dependent UPR target genes [6].
Thus, we investigated the expression of pXbp1 target
genes during ER stress response. The knock-down
pXbp1 significantly reduced the expression of ERdj4 and
p58IPK both in the normal condition and TM treated
PEF cells (Figure 5B). In addition, well-known UPR target genes, including BiP, CHOP, and GRP94, were also
significantly induced by TM treated PEF cells, but
reduced in the pXbp1 knock-down PEF cells (Figure
5B). These results suggest that pXbp1 dependent target
gene expression might be required for maintaining cell
viability in PEF cells under the ER stress condition.
Porcine XBP1 as a UPR marker in the porcine system

Porcine Xbp1 plays a role in ER stress-mediated cell
death

Finally, we assessed the unconventional splicing pattern of
pXbp1 as a UPR marker in the porcine system. Xbp1 is
essential for development of liver and exocrine organs like
the pancreas or salivary gland and holds a crucial role in
immune systems and metabolic regulations [22-24]. To
investigate expression of pXbp1 in adult porcine organs,
we performed the RT-PCR and Western blot analysis with
adult organs. Unspliced and spliced pXBP1 mRNA and
protein was expressed in liver, spleen, intestine, kidney,
and ovary (Figure 6A, B). In the absence of exogenously
induced ER stress, the unconventional splicing of pXbp1
takes place in adult tissues. These results support that
pXbp1 can be used for monitoring ER stress response and
as a specific UPR marker in the porcine system.

To investigate whether pXbp1 is involved in ER stress
induced cell death, knock-down experiments were performed with pXbp1 siRNA. pXbp1 knock-down cells
expressed only 20% of pXbp1 mRNA compared with the

Discussion
The porcine model system is important to study human
diseases because it shares similarities with humans in

transfected PEF cells after TM treatment. We found that
20.5% of total cells showed GFP signal in the TM treated ERAI-PEF cells, not in TM non-treated ERAI-PEF
cells (Figure 4B, arrows). This observation was consistent with the results of the Western blot analysis. The
band of the XBP-1-venus fusion protein (45 kDa) was
very strong under ER stress (Figure 4C). These results
suggest that the ERAI system can be used for monitoring the activation of UPR in the porcine system.

similar organ sizes, anatomy, and physiology [10]. Comparative genomic analysis showed that porcine genomic
sequences are more similar to those of the human than to
the genomic sequences of the mouse [25]. The UPR pathway is valuable for cellular homeostasis and animal development. Therefore, investigating the UPR pathway and
monitoring ER stress in the model system is important to
the study of pathogenic mechanisms that cause human diseases [1,3,26].

The results of this study show the UPR pathway in
porcine system. As well as IRE1a-Xbp1 pathway, two
ER transmembrane proteins, PERK and ATF6a, play
important roles in the mammalian UPR. Upon UPR
induction, ATF6a is released by BiP and exported to
the Golgi, where it is cleaved by S1P proteases [5,27].
Cleaved ATF6a acts as a transcriptional activator that
can increase the expression of ER chaperones and Xbp1
[5]. In this study, we found that three UPR components

(IRE1a, PERK, and ATF6a) are activated by ER stress in
porcine cells (Figure 1D and 1E). Among these three
UPR sensors, IRE1a-Xbp1 pathway plays a central role in
ER stress response by the transcriptional regulation of
genes involved in ER function. The amino acid sequence
comparison and the phylogenetic analysis showed that
pXbp1 has a high similarity to human Xbp1. In addition,
the consensus sequence (CAGCAC/G) in Xbp1 mRNA of
IRE1a target site is conserved between pigs and human
(Figure 2). These results suggest that the IRE1a-Xbp1
pathway is evolutionary conserved in mammals.

Conventional splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome for removing an intron within a primary transcript [28]. In contrast, Xbp1 pre-mRNA is cleaved by
IRE1a endonuclease-mediated unconventional splicing and this process is independent of the spliceosome [5,29]. Unconventional splicing of Xbp1 mRNA
leads to the production of an active transcription factor and induction of adaptive genes in the mammalian
UPR. We showed that pXbp1 was also cleaved by
unconventional splicing during ER stress response
(Figure 3). Spliced pXbp1 mRNA was detected in the
TM treated cells from 3 h and gradually increased
until 9 h. In contrast, the protein level of active
pXbp1s peaked within 3 h and slightly decreased
from 6 h. During ER stress response, activated PERK
pathway attenuates global protein translation by phosphorylating the eIF2a [30]. We also detected that
active PERK increased from 6 h in the TM treated
cells (Figure 1D, E). Therefore, the translation of
spliced and active Xbp1 mRNA may be attenuated by
the PERK-eIF2a pathway.
In this study, we revealed that pXbp1 suppression is
involved ER-mediated cell death through the regulation
of target gene expression, such as ERdj4, p58IPK, and
BiP. In addition, the ER stress-induced expression of
CHOP, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor, was also
reduced in the pXbp1 knockdown cell (Figure 5). The
CHOP promoter contains ER stress response element
(ERSE) and amino-acid-regulatory element (AARE). All
three UPR transcription factors, ATF4, ATF6 and XBP1,
can bind these promoter regions and regulate the transcription of CHOP [31]. The expression of CHOP is
reduced in Xbp1 knockout MEF cell line [6] and in
pXbp1 knock-down porcine cells (Figure 5). These
results indicate that pXbp-1 may be involved in the regulation of CHOP expression. However, PERK-ATF4 and
ATF6a are known as dominant regulators for the
CHOP expression rather than XBP1 [32,33] and all
three UPR pathways are required for the maximal
induction of CHOP [34].
Studies in the mouse model show that the IRE1aXBP1 pathway is essential for the liver and heart development and the function of secretion in pancreatic
exocrine and plasma cells [22-24,35]. The embryonic
fibroblasts from XBP1-deficient mouse show defects in
adipogenesis [36]. We have investigated expression of
the inactive and active isoforms of pXBP1 in various
porcine tissues. While unspliced pXbp1 was expressed
in all examined tissues, spliced pXbp1 was strongly
expressed in liver and kidney (Figure 6A). Furthermore, active pXbp1s protein was detected in all examined tissues except heart (Figure 6B). This result
indicates that pXbp1 plays a role in porcine tissues like
other animals.

Conclusion
In this study, we show that unconventional splicing of
pXbp1 mRNA is evolutionary conserved and pXbp1 is
involved in ER-stress mediated apoptosis. In the adult
porcine organs, spliced pXbp1 was expressed. These
results suggest that pXbp1 can be used to monitor physiological and pathological ER stress in the porcine
model system.

Methods

To isolate porcine Xbp1, we searched the GenBank EST
database with the BLAST (tblastn) program using the
human XBP1 (GenBank accession number NM_005080)
as the query sequence. LVRM100070G04, a Sus scrofa
mRNA clone expressed in liver (GenBank accession
number AK233029.1), showed high homology with the
human XBP1 mRNA sequence. Oligonucleotide primers
(pXBP1-F1, pXBP1-R1) were designed to clone the complete sequence of porcine Xbp1 mRNA (Figure 2A;
Additional file 5, Table S1). PCR reaction was prepared
with porcine cDNA generated from PEF cells, 1 pM of
each primer, and 1X AccuPower® PCR premix (Bioneer,
Daejeon, Korea). PCR Amplification was performed with
30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and 72°C
for 2 min using GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied

Before transfection, cells were plated at 50% confluency in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 5%
fetal bovine serum without antibiotics and incubated overnight. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine™
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as directed by
the manufacturer. Transfection efficiencies were checked
by the fluorescent-labeled control siRNA. The final concentration of the siRNA was 100nM. After 24 h incubation
with siRNA, RT-PCR and cell viability assay were
performed.

PEF cells were cultured on a gelatin-coated coverslip of
up to 40% confluence. Cells were fixed in PBS contained
4% (w/v) formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature
(RT) and washed in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST).
After the incubation for 30 min in PBS containing 1%
Triton X-100, the samples were blocked in PBST with
2% BSA for 1 h at RT, and incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C

times, and mounted on Poly-prepslide glass (Sigma
Aldrish, MO, USA) with a mounting media containing
DAPI (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA). Samples were observed with a Karl Zeiss
Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope equipped with
an Apotome apparatus. Images were captured digitally
using different filter sets and merged using AxioVision
(v4.5) and Adobe Photoshop software (v7.0).

All experiments were repeated at least three times and
the data was presented as the mean and error bar (± S.
E.M.). The statistical significance was tested by Microsoft Excel-based application for the student t-test statistical analysis. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to be
significant.
