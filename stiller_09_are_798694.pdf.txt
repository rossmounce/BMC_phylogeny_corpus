Abstract
Background: How photosynthetic organelles, or plastids, were acquired by diverse eukaryotes is
among the most hotly debated topics in broad scale eukaryotic evolution. The history of plastid
endosymbioses commonly is interpreted under the "chromalveolate" hypothesis, which requires
numerous plastid losses from certain heterotrophic groups that now are entirely aplastidic. In this
context, discoveries of putatively algal genes in plastid-lacking protists have been cited as evidence
of gene transfer from a photosynthetic endosymbiont that subsequently was lost completely. Here
we examine this evidence, as it pertains to the chromalveolate hypothesis, through genome-level
statistical analyses of similarity scores from queries with two diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum
and Thalassiosira pseudonana, and two aplastidic sister taxa, Phytophthora ramorum and P. sojae.
Results: Contingency tests of specific predictions of the chromalveolate model find no evidence
for an unusual red algal contribution to Phytophthora genomes, nor that putative cyanobacterial
sequences that are present entered these genomes through a red algal endosymbiosis. Examination
of genes unrelated to plastid function provide extraordinarily significant support for both of these
predictions in diatoms, the control group where a red endosymbiosis is known to have occurred,
but none of that support is present in genes specifically conserved between diatoms and
oomycetes. In addition, we uncovered a strong association between overall sequence similarities
among taxa and relative sizes of genomic data sets in numbers of genes.
Conclusion: Signal from "algal" genes in oomycete genomes is inconsistent with the
chromalveolate hypothesis, and better explained by alternative models of sequence and genome
evolution. Combined with the numerous sources of intragenomic phylogenetic conflict
characterized previously, our results underscore the potential to be mislead by a posteriori
interpretations of variable phylogenetic signals contained in complex genome-level data. They argue
strongly for explicit testing of the different a priori assumptions inherent in competing evolutionary
hypotheses.

Background
Completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes represent
large and complex data sets, and phylogenomic investigations generally uncover numerous conflicts among individual gene phylogenies [1,2]. When a given gene
produces a phylogeny with strong support for an alternative relationship to what generally is accepted, it is viewed
as a likely candidate for horizontal (or lateral) gene transfer (HGT) [3]. Multiple genes from a given genome supporting the same discrepant relationship are interpreted as
evidence of correlated HGT, stemming from an historical
endosymbiosis in the organism's ancestors [4-6].
Genomes of all photosynthetic eukaryotes contain
numerous sequences acquired via HGT from cyanbacterial ancestors of plastids. Interpreting cases of endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) and endosymbiotic gene
replacement ("EGR" - when the endosymbiont's gene
replaces a previously existing homolog) can be relatively
straightforward in organisms like green plants and red
algae that harbor "primary plastids" (the endosymbiont
was a cyanobacterium). Some algal groups, however, are
products of secondary or higher-order endosymbioses,
meaning they adopted a eukaryotic endosymbiont along
with its pre-existing plastid. In these cases, the host
genome acquires not only cyanobacterial genes via EGT
and EGR, but also eukaryotic sequences from the nucleus
of the endosymbiont [7].
Large-scale impacts from EGT and EGR have important
implications for understanding eukaryotic relationships
and, in particular, whether and how plastids have moved
among major lineages [7-9]. For example, they could provide evidence of a transient endosymbiosis in taxa for
which there is no current cytological indication of an
active or vestigial plastid. Consequently, a number of
efforts have been made to look for evidence of EGT/EGR
from a photosynthetic endosymbiont that could have
been lost from parasitic and heterotrophic relatives of various algal groups [10-12].
The completed genomes of the oomycetes Phytophthora
ramorum and P. sojae were found to contain multiple
genes that imply phylogenetic affiliations with red algae
and cyanobacteria [13]. The presence of these genes has
been interpreted widely as support for the chromalveolate
model [7,8,12,13], which argues that algal groups (ochrophytes, cryptophytes, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, apicomplexans) with red algal-derived plastids trace to a
common photosynthetic ancestor [14]. During the establishment of this endosymbiont and its transition to a fully
integrated organelle, the host cell nucleus would have
accumulated some unknown fraction of red algal and
cyanobacterial genes via EGT and EGR. The model further
stipulates that this "red" plastid subsequently was inher-

ited by genealogical descent, meaning that extant, aplastidic relatives of these algae must have lost the organelle
along the way. Thus, the presence of "algal" genes in Phytophthora genomes is cited as key evidence that non-photosynthetic heterokonts (stramenopiles) once harbored
the same plastid now present in their close relatives, the
ochrophytes (e.g. diatoms and brown algae).
"Algal" genes also have been found in several other aplastidic members of the "Chromalveolata" and, likewise
interpreted as potential support for this broader model of
plastid and organismal evolution [5,11,12]. Such a posteriori results from genome-level data mining are difficult to
interpret, however, because they do not address whether
the amount of aberrant phylogenetic signal found is significantly greater than expected from null or alternative
models. Persistently discordant gene phylogenies have a
number of possible explanations; they are consistent with
directional phylogenetic artifacts [15-17], horizontal gene
transfers associated with feeding preferences or other symbiotic associations [8,18], and alternative models of endosymbiotic plastid transfer [19-21]. Therefore, it is critical
to test whether algal genes in aplastidic protists explicitly
support a given evolutionary model such as the Chromalveolata. It is particularly important that tests be structured to include appropriate controls that demonstrate
observed phylogenetic affinities are not simply an
expected outcome from intragenomic co-variation in treebuilding signal.
In genome-level surveys, comparisons of raw similarity
scores are the most sensitive method for detecting cases of
gene transfer [22], and provide rapid, quantitative and
reproducible data for identifying and ranking HGT candidates [23]. To improve selectivity, individual genes
extracted by genome-wide BLAST surveys and/or automated phylogenetic pipelines, generally are examined
more thoroughly using broader sampling and modelbased phylogenetic approaches [8,24]. These more rigorous phylogenetic treatments remain computationally
intractable on gene-by-gene basis, particularly across four
large eukaryotic genomes as we investigate here (see
below). Moreover, it is unclear how the relative strengths
of cumulative phylogenetic signals favoring competing
hypothesis would be assessed statistically. Because of
these limitations, most comparative genomic investigations [25], including a number with important phylogenomic implications [26-28], have been based on
recognized correlations between similarities in blast
scores and phylogenetic signal [29]. This well-demonstrated relationship is an explicit assumption of automated pipelines used to identify likely HGT/EGT
candidates from whole genomes for more detailed phylogenetic analyses [8,22,30]. Therefore, we analyzed the relative strength of support for top blastp hits to designated

eukaryotic groups as a statistical proxy for aggregate phylogenetic signal. We also employed clear positive controls
that validate the use of this methodology.
We identified three explicit assumptions of the chromalveolate model that can be tested directly, to determine
whether they are supported over null or alternative
hypotheses (Figure 1A). These are, 1) if putative cyanobacterial genes in oomycete genomes are to be considered evidence of a red algal endosymbiosis (given that most
already resided in the nuclear genome of the engulfed rhodophyte), then, as a group, they should show greater affinity to red algal genomes than do genes with stronger
similarities to other bacterial groups; 2) the signal from
red algal genes should be proportionally stronger in
oomycete genomes than signal from control eukaryotic
taxa thought to be unrelated to heterkonts, either phylogenetically or through endosymbiosis, and 3) because of
the relative antiquity of the presumed chromalveolate
endosymbiosis and associated EGT/EGR, signal from red
algal genes specifically unrelated to plastid function
should be shared between oomycetes and diatoms. To
determine whether putative "red algal" and "cyanobacterial" genes in Phytophthora genomes provide support for
the chromalveolate model, we applied statistical tests of
these clear a priori expectations to comparative results
against defined control groups.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/484

tion that these correlations reflect sampling artefacts and
controlled for them in all direct tests of the chromalveolate hypothesis. First, we chose as our control the aplastidic eukaryotic group (Amoebozoa) with the data set
closest in size and most similar to red algae with respect to
shape of similarity score distributions (see below). Second, we designed all contingency analyses to account for
differences in database sizes. Finally, and most significantly, we used a positive control to demonstrate that a
red algal signal is detectable in non-plastid-related genes
when a known endosymbiosis has occurred, despite the
small sizes and unusual characteristics of the available
rhodophyte genomes.
Do cyanobacterial genes in oomycetes support the
chromalveolate model?
Fisher exact tests of the distribution of first hits to bacterial
groups queried with Phytophthora genes suggest that
cyanobacteria have made a somewhat greater than
expected contribution to oomycete genomes (Table 1). In
four of the six comparisons there are relatively more hits
to cyanobacterial genomes than to control groups,
although no differences are significant when thresholds
are adjusted for multiple tests [31]. By comparison, Fisher
exact tests of top hits to bacterial groups by sequences
from the two diatom genomes yield a highly significant
prevalence of cyanobacterial signal in five of six cases
(Table 2).

Results and Discussion
Controlling for small size and unusual evolutionary rates of
available red algal genomes
We queried a large database of eukaryotic and bacterial
genomes with genes from two species of Phytophthora, and
from two diatoms as positive controls for effects from the
known red algal endosymbiosis in ochrophytes. Our initial analyses of overall similarities from BLASTP searches,
querying with oomycete genomes, did not suggest support for the chromalveolate model. Although there are
expectedly large numbers of top hits to phylogenetically
related diatom genomes (P. ramorum: 1493/P. sojae:
1391), there were even more to animals (1549/1510) and
green plants (2861/3135). Conversely, among all eukaryotic groups, the fewest number of top hits were to red algal
genes (93/77); this was even fewer than to three of four
bacterial groups.

These raw measures of similarity also revealed a conspicuous trend in the data. There was a positive association
between the number of top BLASTP hits to a given group
and the total number of genes present in the data set queried; that is, the more total genes present in the group
searched, the greater the number of first hits returned.
Because they could bias statistical comparisons, particularly given the relatively small size of the red algal test
group (Additional file 1), we operated under the assump-

These results do not specifically address the efficacy of the
chromalveolate model. The cumulative signal from diatom genomes reflects many genes related to plastid function that would have been lost from oomycete genomes
along with the putative chromalveolate plastid. Moreover,
even a strong signal from cyanobacterial genes has alternative possible explanations, such as prey biases in phagotrophic ancestors; therefore, we performed additional
contingency tests on a more explicit prediction of the
Chromalveolata.
According to the chromalveolate model, cyanobacterial
genes that were not still retained in the plastid genome at
the time of the secondary endosymbiosis (presumably the
large majority had been lost from the plastid by that
point) were passed to heterokonts through the red algal
nucleus; note that genes still encoded in plastid genomes
are not included in our analyses. We note that, based on
this proposed history, it is unclear that putative cyanobacterial genes in oomycetes should be cited as evidence for
chromalveolates at all; however, given sequence co-variation and the unusual nature of red genomes available, it
appears reasonable that some genes transferred through
the red nucleus now more closely resemble their cyanobacterial homologs. Nevertheless, if genes with a putative
cyanobacterial ancestry are to be taken as evidence of the

Figure tests of the chromalveolate versus ochrophyte-specific models
Specific 1
Specific tests of the chromalveolate versus ochrophyte-specific models. A. The chromalveolate model assumes the
plastid present in modern ochrophytes was adopted as a red algal endosymbiont in the distant ancestor of all chromalveolate
taxa, meaning this plastid was lost from oomycetes after they diverged from ochrophytes. Thus, the model (H1: yellow box and
arrows) makes explicit and testable predictions. In contrast, an ochrophyte-specific origin of the diatom plastid (H2: orange box
and arrow) makes alternative predictions. B. Fisher exact tests for excess gene signal in heterokont genomes from red algae
versus the amoebozoan control. When adjusted for genome size, there are proportionally more first hits to red algae than to
amoebozoans in P. ramorum but not in P. sojae. Both diatom genomes display highly significant excess signal from red algal
genes. C. The same tests on only those genes present in all eukaryotic groups, showing the strong red signal in diatoms is not
simply from plastid-related genes. D. Same tests (on genes present in all eukaryotic groups) on second hits when the first hit is
to the sister heterokont. There is no indication of an excess red algal signal in either oomycete genome. More significantly, the
extraordinary signal for a red contribution to the diatom genomes disappears in gene specifically conserved between oomycetes and diatoms. Significant results after adjustments for multiple tests in B-D are shown in blue bold text.

Chromalveolata, they generally should be more similar to
red algal sequences than are genes from bacterial control
groups. We compared the number of oomycete genes with
first hits to each group that had red algae as the second hit,
against those with "other than red algae" as the second hit.
This also provided a correction for differences in total first
hits associated with relative database size.
Contrary to a priori expectations of the chromalveolate
model, cyanobacterial genes in oomycetes show no trend
toward a greater affinity with red algae. In half of the comparisons, first hits to control groups show greater than
expected proportions of red algal second hits, and in no
case do differences approach statistical significance (Table
2). In contrast, putative cyanobacterial genes in diatom
genomes show a dramatic proportional affinity to red
algae against all control groups, and differences are significant in five of six cases (Table 2). The sixth case (Phaeodactylum genome, cyanobacteria versus firmicutes) favors
a cyanobacterial-rhodophyte association at P = 0.014;
however, this falls below experiment-wise significance
after adjustment for multiple tests. Although a comparably strong signal is not expected in Phytophthora, which
would have lost cyanobacterial genes related to photosynthetic function, there is no indication that cyanobacterial
genes that were retained in oomycetes arrived via a red
algal endosymbiosis. Thus, even if test results on total first
hits (Table 1) are taken as evidence that there are more
cyanobacterial genes in Phytophthora genomes than
expected from a null model of sequence co-variation, the
data are consistent with alternative evolutionary explanations rather than a chromalveolate origin [18,32].
Red algal signal in heterokont genomes
To strengthen the correlation between BLASTP score and
phylogenetic signal, we analyzed top hits to each eukaryotic group for which the next closest group had either a
5% or 10% weaker alignment score. As with the overall
regressions on top hits (see below) of oomycete genes,
those with potentially the strongest phylogenetic support
were highly associated with size of data sets. Although hits
to diatoms again deviate significantly from this trend, suggesting greater phylogenetic signal than predicted by the
regression model, red algal sequences actually had lower
than expected affinity (Table 3). Fisher exact tests, comparing first hits with proportionally strong similarity
scores against total first hits, indicate that red algal
sequences are no more represented in Phytophthora
genomes than are those of the pre-assigned control group.
To the contrary, in three of four comparisons there are
proportionally more hits to amoebozoan than to red algal
genes (Table 4). These results show that a red algal signal
in the Phytophthora genomes does not deviate from the
expectation from intragenomic co-variation from causes
other than EGT under a "chromalveolate" model.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/484

Does the lack of cyanobacterial and red signals reflect loss
of plastid-related genes?
To provide the most objective analysis of comparative signals in blastp hits to red algae relative to controls, we
applied specific tests of the Chromalveolata using only
those genes with significant hits to all six major eukaryotic
taxa (see Additional file 1) included in the study. As much
as possible, this minimizes biases from differential gene
loss from small red algal genomes, as well as variation
among genomes in individual or parallel cases of HGT
from bacteria. It also removes potentially convergent or
parallel signals associated with major metabolic processes
that are differentially present among groups; for example,
genes associated with flagella-based movement. Finally,
and most importantly, it factors out those genes specifically related to plastid-function, which should not be
found collectively in animal, fungal and amoebozoan
genomes.

Because the chromalveolate model predicts that most red
algal genes already were present in the genome of the
common ancestor of oomycetes and diatoms (Figure 1A),
as an initial test for shared signal we performed analyses
of second hits to each group when the known heterokont
sister group is the first hit. Regressions of these hits on the
size of database (Figure 2A) were highly significant, with
R2 values of nearly 1.0, and with no indication of a red
algal deviation from the trend for Phythophthora genomes.
Moreover, even the tendency for red algal hits to deviate
positively from expected values in diatoms (Table 5, Additional file 2), all but disappears in genes specifically conserved between diatoms and oomycetes (Figure 2A). To
investigate whether the lost red signal from diatoms could
be hidden in genes not strongly conserved between diatoms and oomycetes, but nevertheless present in both
taxa, we performed further analyses on diatoms genes
with significant hits to all eukaryotic groups, but with
oomycetes removed from the regressions. In this case, the
positive deviation of red algal genes in diatom genomes
once again becomes evident, although not significant in
analyses of residuals (how much measured values deviate
from those predicted by the regression) (Figure 2B, Table
5). Thus, in direct contrast to expectations from the chromalveolate model, the clearly detectable signal in diatoms
from non-plastid-related genes of red algal origin is specifically absent from Phytophthora genomes.
We performed additional and more explicit analyses of
the relative signals from red algal genes in heterokont
genomes, and whether they are shared between diatoms
and oomycetes. Fisher exact tests on each group yielded
mixed results for oomycetes. There is a significantly
greater than expected proportion of first hits to red genes
for the P. ramorum genome, once relative sizes of data sets
are taken into account (Figure 1B). In contrast, there is no

significant difference in hits to red algal versus control
sequences for P. sojae.
As expected, the overall contributions of red algal genes to
both diatom genomes are highly significant (Figure 1B).
Because this remarkably significant signal in diatoms
includes plastid-related genes, we performed additional
Fisher exact tests on only those genes present in all eukaryotic groups (including animals, fungi and amoebozoans),
effectively eliminating sequences associated with plastid
function. There was a slight increase in detectable red algal

signal in oomycete genomes, relative to total first hits,
although it remained insignificant for P. sojae when
adjusted for multiple tests (Figure 1C). Despite removal of
plastid-related genes, however, the relative strength of red
algal versus control signal in our positive control, diatom
genomes, remained highly significant (Figure 1C).
To test whether red algal signals are shared between diatom and oomycete genomes, we repeated Fisher exact
tests on those genes present in all eukaryotes that have top
hits to the sister heterokont groups, and have either a red

algal or control sequence as the second hit (Figure 1D).
Remarkably, not only did the weak prevalence of hits to
red algae disappear from the P. ramorum genome, so did
all evidence for the extraordinarily significant impact of
red algal sequences on diatom genomes. Diatom P values
went from effectively 0.0 in comparisons of first hits to
non-plastid-related genes, to effectively 1.0 when
restricted to genes with clear similarity to oomycete
homologs. Thus, virtually none of the pervasive signal in
diatoms from the known red algal endosymbiosis is

present in oomycete genomes and, most significantly, any
red signal identified in either group is not shared between
the two. This result is at odds with the most explicit prediction of the chromalveolate model (Figure 1A).
Assessing the chromalveolate hypothesis
Our analyses give no indication that putative "algal genes"
in oomycetes are remnants of the same rhodophytederived secondary plastid present in modern day ochrophytes. Quite the opposite, our results contradict specific

predictions of the chromalveolate model. For example,
although there is a weak tendency for Phytophthora
genomes to yield a greater number of first hits to cyanobacterial genes than to two of three bacterial controls,
there is no suggestion that this signal is associated with a
red algal endosymbiosis (Tables 4, 5).

Overall, there is no indication of any disproportionate
contribution to Phytophthora genomes from a red algal
endosymbiont, despite the highly significant signal in diatoms where endosymbiosis is known to have occurred.
Moreover, the extraordinarily strong signal in diatoms is
completely absent from genes specifically conserved in
Phytophthora, and this difference clearly is not due to loss
of plastid-related genes from oomycetes. Thus, even if
putative cyanobacterial genes are taken as evidence of a
concerted signal from historical HGT, they are better considered in light of alternative hypotheses to chromalveolates; for example, Doolittle's "you are what you eat"
scenario [18], or the more ancient primary endosymbiosis
proposed by Nozaki and colleagues [32,34].

One potential complication of our analyses of cyanobacterial signal is the use of proteobacteria as a control group,
given that the mitochondrion is believed to be derived
from an α-proteobacterium-like ancestor [33]. This could
result in a larger than expected number of first hits compared to other bacterial groups, including cyanobacteria.
With respect to our specific results, however, we do not
believe this is a significant concern. First, most mitochondria-derived proteobacterial genes present in oomycete
nuclear genomes would have arrived via relatively ancient
EGT, certainly before the divergence of oomycetes and
ochrophytes. Thus, such genes conserved enough to identify homology by BLAST score should, as a rule, produce
closer hits to a eukaryotic nuclear genome, the heterokont
sister taxon in particular, than to anciently diverged proteobacterial genes. More importantly, in our explicit tests
of the chromalveolate model, wherein rhodophytederived mitochondria-related genes would represent the
most relevant complication, there is no evidence that
mitochondrial EGT has biased proteobacterial signal relative to other bacterial control groups (Table 2).

Although pair-wise relationships between various "chromalveolate" constituent taxa have received support in
some investigations, mostly in analyses of plastid-based
characters, no evidence has been reported that supports
the model as whole [7]. Moreover, plastid-related data
suggesting relationships among select chromalveolate
taxa are at least equally consistent with hypotheses of tertiary or serial endosymbioses [20,21,35,36]. In fact,
despite a general consensus in plastid-based phylogenies,
computational problems associated with investigations of
complex and ancient evolution still leave open the possibility that red algal-derived plastids are not a monophyletic group [37], and that some plastidic
chromalveolate taxa harbored green algae-derived plastids

ancestrally [38,39]. It is important to note, however, that
a monophyletic relationship among red-derived plastids,
even if demonstrated unequivocally, supports only a common initial secondary origin, not their subsequent linear
descent through the breadth of diversity comprising the
Chromalveolata [21,35,36].
On the other hand, there is substantial evidence from
sequence-based phylogenies that chromalveolate host
cells do not represent a natural group [40-44], this despite
potential impacts from EGT and EGR that should tend to
draw them together in phylogenetic reconstructions even
if they are unrelated [7,36]. Instead, photosynthetic chromalveolates are broken up by a number of heterotrophic
groups, requiring numerous and complete plastid losses.
There is a dearth of empirical data supporting such wholesale plastid loss in general [45], or for a photosynthetic
history for most aplastidic chromalveolate taxa [7,36]. It
is in this context that discovery of "algal" genes in heterotrophic or parasitic protists has taken on great importance
as evidence of a lost secondary plastid. Our results argue
strongly against such a preemptive interpretation in any
aplastidic taxon.
Although our results provide rigorous statistical evidence
against a chromalveolate model of plastid evolution,
additional research is required to reject the Chromalveolata outright. It is particularly problematic that only the
highly reduced and unusual red algal genomes currently
available were used for complete genome-level analyses. It
is also true, however, that investigations uncovering putative "algal genes" in aplastidic protists employ comparable genomic resources. In fact, we specifically targeted the
same red data set used in the report by Tyler and colleagues [13], which has been cited extensively in support
of the Chromalveolata. Thus, if unusual sequence evolution in available red genomes is deemed to make them
unreliable for our statistical analyses, they also should be
viewed as unreliable for inferring individual cases of EGT/
EGR. In fact, unlike a posteriori interpretations of individ-

ual gene phylogenies, we employed a priori positive controls. They clearly show these unusual red genomes are
sufficiently "normal" to demonstrate a highly significant
contribution to diatom genomes, specifically in non-plastid-related genes. Thus, it is likely that gene content in
oomycetes, rather than the peculiar nature of red
genomes, is responsible for our results.
Overall, similarity signals from putative "algal" genes in
oomycetes are more consistent with evolutionary co-variation that is unrelated to EGT or, if evidence of correlated
HGT, they favor an alternative hypothesis to the Chromalveolata. In fact, given the general lack of support for chromalveolates as a natural group, even if we had found
evidence for a plastid in the common ancestor of diatoms
and oomycetes, it would not justify extending that result
back to the ancestor of all "chromalveolate" taxa. In this
case, however, we found no evidence for red EGT, even in
the nearest available heterotrophic relatives of ochrophyte
algae. This argues directly against the chromalveolate
interpretation of plastid evolution.
Association between genome similarity and size of data set
Our initial plan to compare red algal signal in heterokont
genomes to multiple heterotrophic control groups (animals, fungi, amoebozoans) encountered a serious complication. With blastp results from all four heterokont
genomes examined, both linear and quadratic regression
models for number of first hits against size of targeted
data set (total number of genes) were significant, and with
very high values of R2 (Table 5, Additional file 2).

Analyses of residuals demonstrate that, for BLASTP querying with each Phytophthora genome, only hits to diatom
genomes deviate significantly (>2 σ) from the predicted
number of top hits based solely on an association with
total gene number (Table 5). The large positive deviation
for diatoms is consistent with their close phylogenetic
relationship to oomycetes; however, for no other group
does the deviation approach significance. This suggests

Regressions showing red algal signal in diatoms is not shared with oomycetes. A. Regressions on second hits for
genes that are present in all eukaryotic groups (therefore, unrelated to plastid function), where the top hit is to the sister heterokont group (e.g. hit to oomycetes when diatoms are query sequences). The query genome in each case is shown in the
upper right corner of the plot. Broken lines represent quadratic and solid lines linear regressions with adjacent R2 values
shown. In genes most similar between the heterokont sister groups, there is no apparent phylogenetic signal from red algae in
either oomycete or diatom genomes; that is, hits to reds do not deviate positively from the value predicted by the regression
model. B. Conversely, with oomycetes removed from the analysis, a regression on top hits versus group size clearly shows a
positive signal for red algal genes. This same pattern was found in regressions on top hits against group size for all groups
present (Additional file 2, Table 5). Contrary to predictions of the chromalveolate hypothesis, these comparative analyses indicate that the clearly detectable red algal signal in diatom genomes is not present in genes specifically shared with oomycetes.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:484

that, 1) different evolutionary trajectories of oomycetes
and diatoms have not erased phylogenetic similarity in
many orthologous genes, and 2) artifacts related to database size tend to swamp cumulative signal from phylogenetic relatedness, as measured by overall sequence
similarity, except at relatively close evolutionary distances.
The association between BLAST similarity and database
size is demonstrated even more clearly when respective
heterokont sister groups are removed from the regression.
This results in highly significant correlations with R2 values greater than 0.94 for all four genomes (Table 5, Additional file 2). Initially, we hypothesized that this trend
could simply reflect greater gene loss from groups with
fewer and smaller available genomes. As noted above,
however, calculated regressions on genes returning significant hits to all six eukaryotic groups also were highly significant. Therefore, variation in gene loss cannot account
for our results. This was true even with sequences retaining enough phylogenetic signal so that a sister heterokont
genome produced the first hit (Figure 2A). In fact, rather
than providing at least some correction for possible bias
from gene loss, significance of the correlation and R2 values actually increased substantially.
This strong correlation was not fully overcome by signal
from EGT, even when a known endosymbiosis has
occurred. For queries with diatom genes, regressions of
first hits on database size were not significant when all
groups were included in the analyses (Table 5). In analyses of residuals, the known sister group (oomycetes) deviates significantly from expected values for all four
heterokont genomes. Unlike analyses of oomycetes, however, red algal genes also deviate in a positive direction in
diatom genomes, although not significantly. With oomycetes removed, regressions on diatoms became highly significant but the relative magnitude of positive deviation
of red algae also increased substantially, albeit not significantly at >2 σ, (Table 5; Figure 1). These data suggest that
combined phylogenetic signal from oomycete and red
algal genes is responsible for the absence of a significant
correlation in full analyses of first hits querying with diatom genomes (Table 5).
More unexpected was the result that biases related to the
number of genes from each group extend beyond counts
of total or first hits. There also is a clear trend in the distribution of hits to each respective target group. The larger
the size of the subject data set, the more hits are skewed in
the direction of greater similarity to the query gene (Figure
3). The only group to deviate from this trend is the heterokont sister taxon (see insets on Figure 3). Perhaps most
intriguing, with respect to potential effects on a posteriori
hypotheses development, the shapes of the distributions
of ranked hits to green plants (largest data set) and ani-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/484

mals (second largest) are similar to those recovered from
heterokont sister genomes of known evolutionary affinity.
That is, the patterns from these divergent and unrelated
taxa effectively reproduce similarity distributions that
result from a close phylogenetic relationship, potentially
based only on the relatively large sizes of the genome
databases sampled. The distribution shape for fungi, the
next largest data set, also is skewed toward greater proportional similarity relative to red algae and amoebozoans.
This is why we used only amoebozoans as a control group
in Fisher exact tests of the chromalveolate model, to
reduce collective biases related to database size as much as
possible.
Broader considerations of a posteriori evidence of
endosymbiotic gene transfer
Our results indicate that caution should be exercised
when interpreting the presence of genes consistent with
EGT, especially as database sizes for particularly well-studied taxa continue to grow disproportionately. In light of
the large number of highly similar hits to each of our designated groups, it is likely that a number of hypothetical a
posteriori scenarios of gene transfer could be inferred from
these genomes. For example, biased similarity distributions in potentially phylogenetically informative genes
(Table 3, Figure 3) undoubtedly could be used to generate
strong a posteriori evidence of concerted HGT for groups
like green plants and animals; both have large numbers of
sequences showing disproportionately strong similarities
to heterokont homologs. There is no basis to conclude
that detailed phylogenetic analyses of all candidate genes,
as typically carried out when searching for individual
examples of EGT [12], would distinguish between biasrelated artefacts and bona fide examples of HGT.

Anecdotally, we had no trouble finding trees that strongly
support a phylogenetic association between oomycete
genes and sequences from each of the major groups in our
investigation. More significantly, Maruyama and colleagues [46] recently performed genome-level screens of
various protists, using a BLAST plus phylogenetic analysis
pipeline, and found a comparable number of "algal"
genes in the heterolobosean amoeba Naeglaria and choanoflagellate Monosiga as in oomycetes. Although the
results from Naeglaria could be explained by a more
ancient primary endosymbiosis [32], no current model of
plastid evolution predicts EGT into Monosiga, a member
of the opisthokonts. This study demonstrates that direct
phylogenetic evidence for EGT in oomycetes is comparable to that found in taxa that are, effectively, aplastidic
"controls" under the assumptions of the chromalveolate
model. This adds strong support to our argument that preassigned and careful controls are necessary to verify support for correlated HGT or EGT over alternative explanations of persistent phylogenetic incongruence.

defined groups appear in rank order of database size from left to right. The exception is the sister heterokont group, which is

Conclusion
Whole genomes comprise large, complex data sets, with
apparent phylogenetic conflicts among sequences stemming from a variety of known and unknown factors [2];
horizontal gene transfer is only one of them. The strong
associations we uncovered, between trends in sequence
similarity and number of genes queried, suggest that covariation in genome size adds yet another factor to be considered in phylogenomic analyses. For all these reasons,
gene candidates for EGT retrieved from genome-level surveys of aplastidic taxa should not simply indicate a strong
phylogenetic affinity to one or another algal group. They
also should be subjected to tests against null and alternative hypotheses, each with different and specific a priori
expectations, before they are interpreted as evidence for
any particular model of EGT. In the specific case of Phy-

tophthora genomes, our results indicate null or alternative
models are favored over the chromalveolate hypothesis.
Co-variation in genome size is one of a number of recognized sources of directional and stochastic bias that can
produce strong artefacts in phylogenomic investigations
[2,15,47]. This uncharacterized sequence co-variation
provides a fertile hunting ground for individual or handfuls of cases that support one or another evolutionary scenario, even if an alternative hypothesis is favored by
comparable or total evidence. Given the ever-increasing
amount and complexity of data available for phylogenomic investigations, it appears prudent to begin to move
away from a posteriori data interpretations, and toward
direct tests of explicit predictions from standing and
future evolutionary hypothesis.

Methods
Database creation and sequence similarity searches
To investigate signal from algal sequences in Phytophthora
genomes, two protein sequence databases were created.
BLASTP searches were performed using predicted protein
sequences of P. sojae and P. ramorum as queries against a
database comprising a range of eukaryotic and bacterial
genomes (DB1, see below). Because of the existence of a
red algal derived plastid in ochrophytes, we also queried a
second database (DB2) using protein sequences of diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Searches with diatom sequences served as a positive
control, to determine the strength of signal when a red
endosymbiosis is known to have occurred. Because our
focus was on the identification of the most similar
sequences and reliable homologs from the databases, a
stringent cutoff E-value 1e-20 was used in all searches.

Predicted protein sequence data for P. sojae and P. ramorum were downloaded from the genome sequencing
projects of the two species at the Joint Genome Institute.
All other sequences were obtained from NCBI genome
database and corresponding genome sequencing projects.
These databases cover genomes sampled in Tyler et al.
[13] and additional sequences from several other eukaryotic and bacterial groups. Specifically, the first database
(DB1) includes predicted protein sequences from fungi
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Magnaporthe grisea, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus fumigatus, and
Ustilago maydis), animals + Choanozoa (Monosiga brevicollis, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster,
and Caenorhabditis elegans), diatoms (T. pseudonana and P.
tricornutum), red algae (Cyanidioschyzon merolae, Guillardia
theta nucleomorph), green plants (Ostreococcus tauri,
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Physcomitrella patens, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa), amoebozoa (Dictyostelium
discoideum, Entamoeba histolytica), cyanobacteria (Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501, Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Gloeobacter violaceus

oceani ATCC 19707, Photobacterium profundum SS9, Ralstonia eutropha H16, Rhodobacter sphaeroides ATCC 17029,
and Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170). The second protein sequence database (DB2) was identical to DB1 except
that diatom sequences (T. pseudonana and P. tricornutum)
were replaced by those of the two Phytophthora species.
Data processing and computation
To perform computational sorting of BLASTP data, first
we developed a C++ program to parse the BLAST output
files and extract the relevant information for each given
statistical analysis. We then created a database using
MySQL to store the information and performed various
further computations, including data sorting and counting, using PHP and MySQL. Our implementation platform was Windows XP/Dev C++4.9.9.2/Apache Web
Server 2.2/MySQL 5.0/PHP5.2.5.

The C++ program we developed used the genome-wide
BLASTP output file as input, and generated two new output files. The first output file stored information about the
top hits in the following format:
Input sequence/similar sequence found/hit#/similar
sequence/group ID/group name/genome/score/e-value,
where "similar sequence found" indicates whether a
sequence above the threshold value was returned for the
each given gene from the heterokont genome used to
query target groups. The "group" refers to each of the ten
designated target taxa described above (also see Additional file 1). Group information, such as ID, group name,
and genome were placed in a separate file so that any
changes made to the group information file had no effect
on the computational program. This permitted multiple
alternative runs using the same basic sorting algorithm.
The second output file stored more detailed information
about first hits, second hits, etc. in the following example
format:
Group ID/group name/input sequence/hit #1 genome/hit
#1 e-value/hit #2 group ID/hit #2 group name/hit #2 evalue/hit #1 score/hit #1 similar sequence/hit #2 score.
We used these programs to sort four datasets created from
BLASTP searches. Each dataset generated two output files
as described above. Based on these two output files, we
created a database with 11 tables to store all the information. Additional PHP scripts were developed to perform
counting and sorting of this output database as discussed
in our results.

Statistical analyses
Our initial BLASTP query using the P. ramorum genome
yielded a clearly observable association between the
number of top hits retrieved from target groups and the
size of their databases (in number of sequences present).
To investigate this further, we performed linear and quadratic regressions in SPSS (version 16.0) with forced zero
intercepts. The number of BLASTP hits returned was
regressed on the number of genes in each group's database
in separate queries with each heterokont genome. These
analyses were performed using different taxonomic
groups and genes as follows: with all groups present, with
the sister heterokont removed, on only genes present in
all eukaryotic genomes, for genes present in all eukaryotes
where the top hit had a 5% or 10% higher bit score than
the second hit, and on genes present in all eukaryotic
genomes for which the sister heterokont produced the top
hit. To identify taxa that deviate significantly from the
observed relationship, residuals were calculated and
expressed as standard deviations from the mean residual
value. Because we had no prior expectation for the
observed correlations, and quadratic regressions generally
yielded slightly higher R2 values and equal or greater significance levels, analyses of residuals were performed
based on quadratic models.

Contingency analyses (Fisher exact tests) were carried out
using on-line software [48] to test specific predictions of
the chromalveolate model. In each case variables were
chosen to best correct for potential biases caused by associations between numbers of BLAST hits and relative databases sizes. Tests were as follows. 1) Hits to cyanobacteria
should show greater affinity to red algal genomes than do
hits to bacterial control groups. Variables were the top hits
to cyanobacteria or to members of each control group,
when red algae was the second group hit, versus number
of top hits when other than red algae was the second
group hit. 2) There should be more first hits to red algae
than to eukaryotic control groups with no phylogenetic or
endosymbiotic relationship to heterokonts. To correct for
association biases, amoebozoans were chosen as the specific control group because they were closest to red algae
in both total number of genes in the database and the
ranked distributions of hits (Figure 3). Variables were
total first hits to each of the two databases versus total hits
that were not first. This analysis was repeated using only
those genes present in all eukaryotic groups, to factor out
genes specifically related to plastid-function in diatoms
and would, therefore, likely have been lost from oomycetes (were they secondarily aplastidic). 3) To test the prediction that a red algal signal should be shared between
oomycetes and diatoms, variables were second hits to
both red algae and amoebozoans when first hits were to
the other heterokont group, versus second hits when the
first hit was to other than the sister heterokont. One-tailed
P values are reported based on expectations of the chro-
