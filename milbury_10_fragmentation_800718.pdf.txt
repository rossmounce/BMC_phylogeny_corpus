Fragmentation of the large subunit ribosomal
RNA gene in oyster mitochondrial genomes
Coren A Milbury1,3*, Jung C Lee2, Jamie J Cannone2, Patrick M Gaffney1, Robin R Gutell2

Abstract
Background: Discontinuous genes have been observed in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic nuclei, mitochondria
and chloroplasts. Gene discontinuity occurs in multiple forms: the two most frequent forms result from introns that
are spliced out of the RNA and the resulting exons are spliced together to form a single transcript, and
fragmented gene transcripts that are not covalently attached post-transcriptionally. Within the past few years,
fragmented ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes have been discovered in bilateral metazoan mitochondria, all within a
group of related oysters.
Results: In this study, we have characterized this fragmentation with comparative analysis and experimentation.
We present secondary structures, modeled using comparative sequence analysis of the discontinuous
mitochondrial large subunit rRNA genes of the cupped oysters C. virginica, C. gigas, and C. hongkongensis.
Comparative structure models for the large subunit rRNA in each of the three oyster species are generally similar
to those for other bilateral metazoans. We also used RT-PCR and analyzed ESTs to determine if the two fragmented
LSU rRNAs are spliced together. The two segments are transcribed separately, and not spliced together although
they still form functional rRNAs and ribosomes.
Conclusions: Although many examples of discontinuous ribosomal genes have been documented in bacteria and
archaea, as well as the nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria of eukaryotes, oysters are some of the first
characterized examples of fragmented bilateral animal mitochondrial rRNA genes. The secondary structures of the
oyster LSU rRNA fragments have been predicted on the basis of previous comparative metazoan mitochondrial
LSU rRNA structure models.

Background
The translation of mRNA into functional proteins
occurs within the two subunits of the ribosome. These
subunits are typically 30S and 50S (to form the 70S
ribosome) in prokaryotes and chloroplasts, 40S and 60S
(to form the 80S ribosome) in nuclear encoded eukaryotic ribosomes, and subunit sizes vary considerably in
mitochondria.
The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) typically contains a
single RNA and exhibits a range of sizes; ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) are 16S in prokaryotes and chloroplasts
[1], 18S in the eukaryotic nuclear genome [1], and varies
from 9S [2] to over 18S in mitochondrial genomes [3].
The RNA in the small ribosomal subunit (30S or 40S) is

also called 16S-like rRNA and more typically SSU
rRNA. The large ribosomal subunit (LSU) usually contains two or three primary RNAs. Prokaryotic and chloroplast LSUs usually possess a 23S rRNA [1], eukaryotic
nuclear genomes contain 25-28S and 5.8S rRNAs [1],
and in mitochondria, rRNAs range from 12S to >26S
[2,4]. This RNA in the large ribosomal subunit (50S or
60S) is also called 23S-like rRNA and more typically
LSU rRNA. The majority of the mitochondrial ribosomes, including animals, do not contain a 5S rRNA in
their LSU; the exceptions are plants [5], protists including some red, green, and brown algae [6-15], and more
recently an amoeboid protist, Acanthamoeba castellanii
[16] that contain an RNA with the major characteristics
of 5S rRNAs. The functional ribosome with the 30S/40S
and 50S/60S subunits contain at least 50 ribosomal proteins (rProteins) [1]. Although phylogenetic variation in
size, sequence, and structure of rRNAs is extensive [17],

specific regions of the rRNA are conserved in all known
organisms. Several of the conserved regions of the SSU
and LSU rRNA assemble to form the catalytic core
within the center of the ribosome [18].
Typically, 5S, 16S and 16S-like, and 23S and 23S-like
rRNAs are each encoded from a continuous rRNA gene;
however, the rRNA genes infrequently have non-rRNA
nucleotide sequences inserted. The two primary types of
interrupted rRNA genes are the result of: 1) introns and
2) fragmentation. Introns, the nucleotides within the
rRNA gene that do not code for rRNA, are removed
during transcript processing, followed by exon splicing
or re-ligating, the parts of the rRNA gene that codes for
the rRNA [19]. At least 3000 introns have been identified in rRNA [17,20]. Discontinuous and fragmented
rRNAs can be encoded by at least two noncontiguous
regions of the genome that when combined code for a
full length rRNA. However, unlike introns, the fragments of the rRNA are not covalently reconnected.
Thus, the rRNA in the ribosome is split into at least
two fragments.
While the majority of the introns in rRNA occur
within highly conserved regions of the rRNA gene,
fragmentation occurs in regions of high variability
[17,20]. In three dimensional space the introns occur
on the interface side of the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits that have a high percentage of very conserved
nucleotides while the regions with large insertions and
deletions generally occur on the back side of each of
the two subunits where the majority of the large insertions occur in organisms that span the entire tree of
life [20].
Two modes of gene organization have been observed
for the discontinuous rRNA genes. The first maintains
the order of the rRNA sequence in the rRNA gene and
the intervening nucleotides in the gene are removed
after they are transcribed. The regions that are excised
are called internal transcribed spacers (ITS) in eukaryotes, and intervening sequences (IVS) in prokaryotes.
Although most rRNAs are coded by a contiguous gene,
many examples of discontinuous coding within the
rRNA have been documented. Within some closely
related bacteria of the same genus, one species (or
strain) may have an insertion and discontinuous coding
at a specific location in the rRNA structure (e.g. Campylobacter jejuni [21]) while another species in the same
genus does not have an insertion at the same location in
the LSU rRNA and has a single continuous 23S rRNA
(e.g. Campylobacter coli [22]). Many other examples of
discontinuity that maintains the genetic order of the
functional rRNA have been identified in eukaryotes and
have been reviewed in Gray and Schnare [23,24].
The second type of discontinuous genes occurs less
frequently. Here the rRNA-encoding regions are

Page 2 of 17

separated by tRNA- or protein-encoding genes rather
than introns. In a few cases, the functional order of
rRNA fragments has been rearranged in addition to the
insertion of non-rRNA gene fragments. For example,
gene fragmentation and rearrangement have been
observed in the SSU and/or LSU rRNAs in the mitochondrial genomes of the fungus Haloraphidium curvatum [25], as well as ciliates Tetrahymena pyriformis and
Paramecium aurelia [26,27]. Extensive ribosomal fragmentation and rearrangement have also been observed
in rRNA genes in the mitochondrial genomes of chlorophycean and prasionophycean green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [28], C. eugametos [29], and inferred in
other Chlamydomonas species [30] and other green
algae mitochondria based on isolation of rRNA fragments [31], such as Chlorogonium elongatum [32] and
Pedinomonas minor [7]. The most extensive fragment
rearrangement of the rRNA gene occurs in protistan
apicomplexans (such as Theileria parva [33] and Plasmodium falciparum [34-36]) and dinoflagellates [37-39]
(such as Oxyrrhis marina [40] and Alexandrium catenella [41]).
While fragmented and rearranged ribosomal RNA
genes have been observed in bacteria and eukaryotic
nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial RNA genes, the
first discontinuous ribosomal RNA gene in a bilateral
metazoan mitochondrial genome was reported in 2005 Crassostrea virginica [1] and subsequently found in two
other strains of Crassostrea, C. gigas [42] and C. hongkongensis [43,44] The first discontinuous rRNA gene in
a non-bilateral metazoan Placozoan, Trichoplax adhaerens was reported in 2006 [45] followed by the identification of three additional discontinuous rRNAs in the
same Placozoan phylogenetic group [46].
The characterization and modeling of the secondary
structures of the fragmented LSU rRNA genes is essential to determine its location in the rRNA’s higher-order
structure, gain an understanding of how these gene fragments associate to form functional rRNAs and ribosomes, and relate the conserved and variable regions
with the high resolution crystal structures and the functional components of the ribosomal RNA in protein
synthesis. This fragmentation is also important as it
could help us understand the rearrangements within an
organism’s genome.
Using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR), and analysis of EST sequences, we demonstrate that the two LSU rRNA fragments predicted with
comparative analysis are not spliced together post-transcriptionally in Crassostrea virginica. The secondary
structure of these fragmented ribosomal LSU RNA
genes in the cupped oysters Crassostrea virginica, C.
gigas, and C. hongkongensis, have been modeled and are
described herein.

Results and discussion
RT-PCR analysis of Crassostrea virginica

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) were individually extracted from adductor muscle of the oyster Crassostrea virginica. Reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed on the C. virginica RNA
to generate complementary DNA (cDNA). PCR amplification was performed to amplify portions of the 5’ half
and 3’ halves of the LSU rRNA genes from both the
DNA and cDNA templates. The anticipated amplicons
were produced for both portions of the LSU rRNA (233
bp amplicon and 434 bp amplicon) from both the DNA
and the cDNA template (Table 1, Figure 1). However, a
~773 bp region could not be amplified from the cDNA
template using primers located in the 5’ and 3’ portions
of the LSU rRNA gene. Amplification was simultaneously performed in the bay scallop Argopecten irradians, a related mollusk with a full length, contiguous
LSU gene [47] with regions of conservation where primers were situated (GenBank: DQ665851). As apparent
in Figure 1, the 748 bp region of the LSU rRNA gene
was successfully amplified in the genomic DNA and
cDNA of Arogopecten irradians; this region could not
be amplified in Crassostrea virginica genomic DNA or
cDNA. The lack of amplification with the third primer
set indicates that C. virginica mRNA is not post-transcriptionally modified by splicing to generate a fulllength LSU rRNA, nor is there a functional full-length
LSU gene elsewhere in the genomic DNA of C.
virginica.
Secondary Structure Analysis of the Large Subunit rRNA

The LSU rRNA gene in each of the three respective
cupped oyster mitochondrial genomes is split into two
fragments separated by a large number of nucleotides
(9958-9960 nts in C. virginica, 6662-6663 nts in C.
gigas, and 11999 nts in C. hongkongensis); this phenomenon has not been previously characterized in any bilateral metazoan mitochondrial genome.
No introns were identified by screening the non-coding regions of the C. virginica mitochondrial genome

Page 3 of 17

using Rfam [48] and tools and data available at the
Comparative RNA Website (CRW) [17]. Additional
evidence that the two fragments of the LSU rRNA are
not ligated into a single rRNA molecule are: (1) several
complete protein genes (needed by the mitochondria for
its function) are located between the two segments of
the gene and have been observed in other mitochondrial
genomes; (2) fragmentation in the oyster LSU rRNA
gene occurs in highly variable region of the RNA, while
introns, and the ligation of gene fragments, always occur
(with a few minor exceptions) in highly conserved
regions of the rRNA) [20]; and (3) the existence of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs), not determined experimentally herein, revealed that the two fragments of the
LSU rRNA were not ligated into a single RNA. We used
these ESTs to infer the transcripts and gene boundaries.
The 5’ fragment of the C. virginica LSU rRNA is
inferred to extend from the nucleotide immediately
downstream from trnD (nt 8250, which is the extreme
5’ position observed in the transcript data), to nucleotide
position 8997, the site of polyadenylation in the majority
of transcripts. The 3’ fragment of the LSU rRNA gene
in C. virginica is located from nt 1712 to nt 2430. The
5’ boundary of this segment is based on two observations from transcript sequences: 1) nt 1712 is the 5’
most position in ESTs matching the 3’ portion of the
LSU rRNA gene, and 2) nt 1711 is the polyadenylation
site for transcripts containing the upstream cytochrome
oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. The right boundary is
inferred from the observation that transcripts containing
the 3’ portion of the LSU rRNA gene are polyadenylated
after position 2430. In C. virginica [GenBank:
AY905542], eleven tRNA genes, and nine protein coding
genes separate the 5’ and 3’ halves of the LSU rRNA
gene [42].
In C. gigas [GenBank: AF177226], the inferred location
of 5’ fragment of the LSU rRNA gene is between
nucleotides 5103 and 5703. Though we can not rule out
overlapping gene-boundaries, the inferred start boundary of this fragment is at the first nucleotide following
trnQ; nt 5117 represents the 5’-most position found in

transcripts containing the LSU rRNA 5’ section. The
right boundary of this fragment is inferred by transcript
polyadenylation at nt 5703/5704. The 3’ fragment of the
LSU rRNA gene is located between nucleotides 17265
and 17977 (slightly different from that annotated in
[GenBank: AF177226 (17116..18224)]). The left boundary is based on the observation that cox1 transcripts in
C. gigas extend to nt 17264, their polyadenylation site;
the right boundary represents the polyadenylation site in
transcripts containing the 3’ portion of the LSU rRNA
gene. Twelve tRNA genes, one SSU rRNA gene, nine
protein coding genes, and the major non-coding region
separate the 5’ and 3’ halves of the LSU rRNA gene [42].
In the C. hongkongensis mitochondrial genome by J.
Ren and colleagues [44] [GenBank: EU672834], the 5’
fragment of the LSU rRNA gene is located between
nucleotides 7780 and 8384. The boundary of this fragment begins just downstream of trnQ. The mtDNA

sequence by Yu et al. [43] [GenBank: EU266073] is
incomplete and does not contain the C. hongkongensis 5’
fragment of the LSU rRNA gene sequence. The 3’ fragment of the LSU rRNA gene is located between nucleotides 1761 and 2472 [GenBank: EU672834] according to
Ren et al. [44], and similarly located at nucleotides
1764-2475 [GenBank: EU266073] by Yu et al. [43]; the
two sequences [GenBank: EU672834 and EU266073] are
100% identical and 712 bp in length. Thirteen tRNA
genes, one SSU rRNA gene, nine protein coding genes,
and the major non-coding region separate the 5’ and 3’
halves of the LSU rRNA gene [44].
The 5’ and 3’ halves of the fragmented oyster LSU
rRNA contain predicted secondary structural elements
that are present in organisms spanning the entire tree of
life [17,49-51], features characteristic of bilateral animal
mitochondrial LSU rRNAs and features specific to molluscan LSU rRNA. Figures 2, 3, and 4 present the LSU

rRNA secondary structures for C. virginica, C. gigas, and
C. hongkongensis, respectively, and sequence similarities
and characteristics are presented in Tables 2 and 3.
In contrast to the 5’ half of the molluscan LSU rRNA
and other LSU rRNAs from organisms that span the
tree of life, the 3’ segment is more conserved among the
molluscan rRNAs studied here and the 3’ half of all LSU
rRNA. The general conservation of the 5’ and 3’ halves
of the molluscan LSU rRNA and all LSU rRNAs is consistent with the experimental studies that have associated more function to the 3’ half than the 5’ half.
Although the oysters are closely related, interspecific
sequence variation of the rRNAs is apparent (Table 2).
The 5’ half of the LSU rRNA is much more variable
than the 3’ half. The 3’ LSU rRNA fragments in the
three cupped oyster species have high nucleotide identity. C. gigas and C. hongkongensis are ~96% identical,
while C. virginica exhibits a slightly lower similarity with
C. gigas (82%) and C. hongkongensis (83%). Consistent
with larger phylogenetic analyses, the 5’ fragments exhibit much lower similarities between the species than
that observed in the 3’ fragments. The C. virginica 5’
fragment is only 65% identical with C. gigas. Yu et al.
[43] do not report the 5’ rRNA fragment, however it is
included in GenBank: EU672834 by Ren et al. [44]. The
C. hongkongensis 5’ fragment is 64% identical with that
of C. virginica and 89% identical with C. gigas.
Consistent with other studies on molluscan rRNA
genes [51], the A+T content is higher in the 5’ versus 3’
fragments (Table 3). The A+T content in the 5’ LSU

rRNA fragment is 66% in C. virginica, 69% in C. gigas,
and 68% in C. hongkongensis; however, the A+T content
in the 3’ fragments of C. virginica and C. gigas is 61%
and 62% in C. hongkongensis. The observed sequence
similarities and phylogenetically consistent A+T content
[51] between fragmented and continuous LSU rRNA
genes implies that the same selective pressure is actively
maintaining the functionality of the genes. Thus, it is
unlikely that these fragments represent ancestral remnants or degenerate genes.
While the LSU rRNA domains present in all three
oyster species reveal significant conservation with other
metazoan mitochondria, there are distinct differences
apparent when compared to rRNA structures of bacteria, archaea, and nuclear-encoded eukaryotes. Lydeard
et al. [51] presented a detailed phylogenetic analysis of
molluscan mitochondrial LSU rRNA secondary structures for a chiton, two bivalves, six gastropods, and a
cephalopod. Mollusks generally exhibit all six of the
typical LSU rRNA structural domains including three
characteristic helical features that are critical in inferring
the phylogeny of mollusks. The three characteristic helical features considered in molluscan phylogeny are present in Domains II, III, and V and are highlighted in
Figure 2 as features a, b, and c, respectively.
Combining thorough analysis of these features, in
addition to identifying fragmentation of mitochondrial
LSU fragmentation in other molluscan bivalves may
allow for a more accurate determination of phylogenetic
relationships. A recent evaluation of the 3’ half of the
LSU rRNA secondary structure in the family Pectinidae
(Mollusca: Bivalvia) revealed high levels of conservation
in the secondary structure [52] with limited taxa differentiation. However, incorporation of fragmentation analysis within and between family level analyses may
demonstrate a more acute phylogenetic representation
of molluscan bivalves.
The currently discussed fragmentation is characteristic
of just one branch of molluscan phylogeny, thus it is a
general characteristic at this time and difficult to determine the diagnostic significance regarding phylogenetic
relationships. However, as more molluscan mitochondrial genomes are investigated, and additional unique
characteristics in the rRNA structure are discovered,
such as this fragmentation and the features discussed
above [51], it may become possible to specifically determine taxonomic branches. It may also become possible
to differentiate the branch of the Mollusca based upon
patterns of fragmentation. Additional molluscan mtDNA
genomic sequences are necessary to determine the phylogenetic significance of these structural features
(including the fragmentation).
The fragmentation of the LSU rRNA occurs between
the 3’ end of structural domain II and the 5’ start of

Milbury et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:485
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/485

domain IV. Domain III is completely deleted; for comparison, domain III is composed of approximately 360
nucleotides in the bacterium E. coli. While its variation
is limited in size and structure in the bacteria, archaea,
and eukaryotes [17], fragmentation has been observed in
different locations in domain III in a few eukaryotic
nuclear-encoded rRNAs (for example, in the insect Apis
mellifera [53]), and a few protists (such as Euglena gracilis [54]), and Trypanosoma brucei (X14553) [17]).
Domain III is significantly truncated in size in bilateral
animal mitochondria. Vertebrates typically maintain part
of domain III, while some invertebrates such as C. elegans lack all, or nearly all, of domain III [17,55].
The peptide exit tunnel (PET) for growing proteins
during protein synthesis in the 50S ribosomal subunit
has been studied previously [56,57], which maps to the
five domains of the LSU rRNA (Figure 5; red and green
nucleotide positions are the regions associated with
PET) and transverses through the 50S crystal structure
(Haloarcular marismortui, PDB ID 1JJ2) [58]. The PET
starts near the middle of this subunit at the peptidyl
transferase center (PTC) and extends to the lower back
of the 50S ribosomal subunit. The regions in domains
II, IV, and V (red nucleotides) of the H. marismortui
LSU rRNA associated with PET are present in all of the
LSU rRNAs that span the tree of life while the regions
in domains I and III (green nucleotides) are not present
in the LSU rRNAs in the three Crassostrea mitochondrial genomes. In particular, domain III - immediately 3’
to the end of the 5’ LSU rRNA fragment and 5’ to the
start of the 3’ LSU rRNA fragment - maps to the end of
PET at the lower back of the H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit (Figure 6; regions shown in purple). Thus
the fragmentation of the oyster mitochondrial LSU
rRNA occurs at one of the regions associated with PET
that is deleted in these oyster LSU rRNAs. Interestingly,
the deleted domains I and III in a cryo-EM structure of
a mammalian mitochondrial ribosome were not replaced
with ribosomal proteins nor with other portions of LSU
rRNA [59]. Consequently, the absence of domains I and
III (green and purple in Figure 6, respectively) shortens
the exit tunnel by 25 Å compared to the bacterial PET
of ~88 Å, suggesting that a growing peptide will be
prematurely exposed to solvent as indicated by the cryoEM structure. Currently it is not obvious why the fragmentation in the oyster LSU rRNAs occurs at the site
directly involved in the formation of PET.
Nearly all of the other identified fragmentations of the
rRNA genes contain a set of base pairings that form a
helix that connects the two (or more) fragments of
rRNA. Although no helix that is conserved in the three
Crassostrea connect the two oyster LSU rRNA fragments, many tertiary interactions connect all regions of
the LSU rRNA with one another in the high resolution

proteins interact with the rRNA and with one another
to stabilize the network of interactions that provide the
overall stability and dynamic behavior of the ribosome
during protein synthesis. Thus the fragmentation in the
rRNA, especially in a highly variable region, should not
affect the structure nor the function of the ribosome
since many organisms as noted in the introduction are
fragmented and are functional.
Though several models have been developed, the evolutionary pathways responsible for fragmentation of
mitochondrial ribosomal genes remain unknown. Several
hypotheses have been developed for each organism in
which fragmentation has been observed. For example,
within just Chlamydomonads, it has been proposed that
gene fragmentation has occurred by a bacterial-like
transposition [28,61], recombination [28,29,62], horizontal transfer [63], acquisition and scrambling of processing sites [29], or it could be that the primordial
ribosome was actually a noncovalent network of small
RNA molecules [23,28]. As there are similarities in the
degree of variability and regions that are excised,
Schnare et al. [64] suggest that an ancestral ability to
excise spacers within regions of variability may have
been evolutionarily maintained within ciliates such as T.
pyriformis. The evolutionary pathway that lead to oyster
mtDNA LSU rRNA fragmentation is difficult to determine at this time due to the small number of fragmentations in the metazoans.
Discontinuous mitochondrial rRNA genes are rare in
metazoans. Beyond the fragmented rRNA in oysters, the
only other documented example of a fragmented mitochondrial rRNA is in the non-bilateral Trichoplax adhaerens and three other Placozoans [45,46,65] the simplest
known free-living animal. For comparison with the
oysters, we have generated secondary structures for these
four Placozoan LSU rRNAs. We present one secondary
structure here (Figure 7) and the remaining three are on
the Comparative RNA Website). The LSU rRNAs from
the Placozoans contain many of the structural elements
present in Bacteria that are however absent in the bilateral animal LSU rRNAs. This contrasts with the bilateral
animal mitochondrial LSU rRNAs which are highly truncated in comparison with the nuclear-encoded LSU
rRNAs of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes.
While the fragmentation and large truncation of the
oyster mitochondrial LSU rRNA (that have been studied
herein) occur between positions 1275-1650 (domains III

and IV), all four Placozoan LSU rRNAs are fragmented
after position 1013 (Escherichia coli numbering). This
region of the rRNA is variable, consistent with a split in
the rRNA without subsequent ligation. One of the Placozoan LSU rRNA structures (BZ10101) also had an
insertion after position 1787, a region that is conserved
in rRNAs that span the entire tree of life (including the

mitochondria and chloroplast). This insertion was identified earlier [65] as a group II intron. Our analysis
reveals that this intron appears to be in B subgroup of
the group II introns. Two other introns occur after
1787. Both are mitochondrial, both are also group IIB,
one is a green algae, Pedinomonas minor (AF116775)
and the second is a brown algae, Pylaiella littoralis

(Z48620). A third insertion in some of the Placozoan
LSU rRNAs occurs after position 2586, which is in the
peptidyl transferase loop, one of the most conserved
regions in the rRNA. This intron, also identified previously [65] as a group II intron, also appears to be in
the B subgroup. This is the first occurrence of an intron
that we are aware of at this position. However many
introns occur in the peptidyl transferase site, including
at positions 2584 and 2585 http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.
edu/SAE/2C/rRNA_Introns/table1.php?show=condensed&from_gene = 23S[17,20].
The bilateral animals have on average about 16 kbp in
their mitochondria. Their genomes are very compact,
coding for approximately 37 genes that are in general
truncated in size in comparison with Bacteria, Archaea,
Eukaryotic nuclear-encoded and chloroplast, and with a
minimal number of nucleotides not coding for protein
or RNA between genes [66]. While the Cnidaria,
Demospongiae, and Hexactinellida non-bilateral genomes are just slightly larger than the bilateral genomes
(16 kbp - 25.6 kbp), the Placozoa non-bilateral genomes
range from approximately 32 kbp - 43 kbp [66]. The
Placozoan and a few of the other non-bilateral animals
have multiple introns in their cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 protein-coding genes, while none of the bilateral animal genomes
have introns [46]. Phylogenetic analysis of the non-bilateral and bilateral Metazoan place the non-bilateral
organisms on one branch and the bilateral on a separate
major branch of the phylogenetic tree [46,67,68].
Although introns and trans-splicing have been observed
in the Placozoan mitochondria, that have the largest animal mitochondrial genomes, we were not surprised that
none were found (as discussed earlier) in the oyster genomes as their genome is typical in size and content with
the other bilateral animal mitochondrial genomes.
Previous analysis of molluscan phylogeny has identified three particular mitochondrial LSU rRNA structural
features that provide a phylogenetic signal [51]. The presence and/or absence of stem-loop structures within the
LSU rRNA, as well length variation, previously resulted
in a phylogenetic re-structuring of the molluscan taxa.
Of the eleven mollusks (and Drosophila melanogaster)
evaluated by Lydeard et al. [51], none of them exhibit
the same characteristics as observed in the oysters and
the fragmentation is unique. The phylogenic segregation
from the predicted molluscan taxonomy warrant further
examination and the fragmentation of the LSU rRNA
gene in the oysters should be considered in future evaluation of molluscan phylogeny.

Conclusions
Although many examples of discontinuous ribosomal
genes have been documented in bacteria and archaea, as

Page 13 of 17

well as the nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria of
eukaryotes, oysters are the first characterized examples
of fragmented bilateral animal mitochondrial rRNA
genes. This study presents the secondary structure models of the discontinuous ribosomal RNA genes in the
three cupped oyster (Crassostrea) mitochondrial genomes. Comparative structure models for the large subunit rRNA in each of the three oyster species are
generally similar to those for other bilateral metazoans.
While modeling the rRNA structure of the oyster, we
determined that several of the rRNA secondary structure regions associated with the exit tunnel (identified in
the high-resolution crystal structure of Haloarcular
marismortui, PDB # 1JJ2) were in fact absent in the
oyster mitochondrial LSU rRNA secondary structure.
The biological and structural significance of this observation is not readily apparent.
To date the only other examples of discontinuous
mitochondrial rRNA genes in Metazoans have been
documented in Placozoans, which are considered to be
the most primitive animals. We have generated comparative secondary structure models for several Placozoans LSU rRNAs (available at our supplemental site
http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu/SIM/4A/Fragmented_Mollusk/. While the fragmentation in the oyster and
Placozoan mitochondrial LSU rRNA occurs in highly
variable regions, consistent with other rRNA fragmentations, the specific location of the fragmentation is different between the species. Additionally, some Placozoans
contain at least one group II intron. For the oysters
involved in our studies, DNA sequence signatures, secondary structure analysis, RT-PCR experimentation,
analysis of EST databases, and the absence of intron
sequence and structural features all strongly suggest that
these oyster mitochondrial rRNA fragments associate
noncovalently to form a functional ribosome.

Methods
Reverse-transcriptase analysis

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) were individually extracted from adductor muscle of the oyster Crassostrea virginica and the bay scallop Argopecten irradians using the RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen) and the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen),
respectively, per manufacturer’s instructions. Reversetranscriptase (RT)-PCR was performed on the C. virginica and A. irradians RNA to generate complementary
DNA (cDNA), using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA
kit (Applied BioSystems Inc).
PCR amplification was performed to amplify portions
of the 5’ half and 3’ halves of the LSU rRNA genes from
both the DNA and cDNA templates. Three amplicons
were investigated: 1) a 233 bp portion of the 5’ half of
the LSU rRNA gene, 2) and 434 bp portion of the 3’

Milbury et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:485
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/485

half of the rRNA LSU gene, and 3) a 748-773 bp amplicon that spans from the 5’ portion into the 3’ portion of
the rRNA LSU gene. Primers for each of the three
regions PCR amplicons are presented in Table 1. The
third set of primers, though located in regions of conservation, are degenerate in order to amplify both C. virginica and A. irradians (GenBank: DQ665851). If the 5’
and 3’ fragments of the rRNA LSU are indeed splice
post-transcriptionally, a ~773 bp amplicon will be
amplified in the cDNA template of the oyster though
not from its associated DNA template. The amplification of a 748 bp region of the fully contiguous LSU
rRNA gene in A. irradians [47] in both genomic DNA
and cDNA, serves as a positive control for the PCR
reaction.
PCR was performed on an Eppendorf MasterCycler EP
thermocycler using annealing temperatures defined in
Table 1. The GoTaq polymerase system was employed
with the following reagent conditions: 1X manufacturer
supplied Flexi-PCR buffer (Promega Corporation), 1.5
mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM primers, 5 U/μl
GoTaq® DNA polymerase (Promega Corporation).
Approximately 50 ng of genomic DNA or 100 ng of
cDNA template were incorporated in each reaction.
PCR amplicons were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis (with ethidium bromide staining). Final amplicons were Sanger sequenced to ensure amplification of
the target region from both the DNA and cDNA
template.
Secondary Structure Modeling

The C. virginica mitochondrial genome [GenBank:
AY905542][42] and that of C. gigas [GenBank:
AF177226] were used to facilitate gene annotation and
to generate putative secondary structures for each of the
ribosomal genes. The recently published C. hongkongensis mitochondrial genomes from Yu et al. [43] [GenBank: EU266073] and Ren et al. [44] [GenBank:
EU672834] were compared, particularly in regard to the
rRNA gene content. EST collections for C. virginica and
C. gigas, which contain numerous mitochondrial transcripts, were used to infer gene boundaries. EST databases were managed using SEQtools 8.1 [69]http://www.
seqtools.dk.
The Comparative RNA Website and Rfam were
employed to screen the mtDNA genome of the oyster
for introns. Rfam [48] utilizes a nucleotide database
(RFAMSEQ) of structural RNA sequences (including
non-coding RNA genes and cis-regulatory RNA elements) to identify particular families of RNAs. Regions
of the C. virginica mitochondrial genome denoted as
non-coding regions were screened for introns that
might mediate the splicing of the discontinuous LSU
rRNA gene.

Page 14 of 17

Secondary structure models were determined for the
mitochondrial LSU rRNA genes of C. virginica, C. gigas,
and C. hongkongensis using comparative structure models
for LSU rRNAs from organisms that span the entire tree
of life including animal mitochondrial rRNAs [17]. The
prediction of several RNAs’ secondary structure with comparative analysis is based on a very simple but profound
concept. Each of the different types of RNA - e.g. tRNA, 5
S, SSU, and LSU rRNA form a similar secondary and
three-dimensional structure, although the underlying primary structure, or sequence, can be significantly different.
Transfer RNA was the first molecule analyzed with
this method once the first few tRNA sequences were
determined in the early 1960’s [70-74]. At the onset of
these studies, a small number of sequences (e.g. tRNA)
were inspected for similar helices that are present in the
same region of the rRNA. The classic cloverleaf structure for the tRNA was determined to be that structure
common to a growing number of tRNA sequences. The
tRNA crystal structures [75,76] verified this cloverleaf
secondary structure that was predicted with comparative
methods.
This success with tRNA encouraged the use of comparative methods to predict other RNA secondary structures. The comparative structure for 5S rRNA was
determined by Fox and Woese [77,78]. The prediction
of the 16S and 23S rRNA secondary structures models
with comparative analysis started after the first few bacterial sequences were determined in the early 1980’s
[79,80]. All of these early comparative studies on these
RNA (and others not mentioned) were performed with
a visual analysis of the RNA sequences for common
structure. However, as the number of sequences
increased, and larger sequences (e.g. 16S and 23S rRNA)
were studied, these sequences were aligned for maximum sequence identity. Base pairs were predicted for
those columns in an alignment that have similar patterns of variation, more commonly called covariation. In
parallel, a series of computational methods were developed to identify and quantify the significance and purity
of these covariations [17,18,81,82]. Initially we developed
a simple number pattern method [18], followed by more
sophisticated chi-square based methods [83] and mutual
information [81,84] Many other comparative methods
have been developed. A partial list is in Gardner and
Giegerich [85]. Hidden Markov Models have also been
used to predict RNA structure [86,87]. Other quantitative methods have been developed in the Gutell lab
[17,82]. The determination of the proper alignment and
secondary structure occur in parallel. Sequences in the
alignment can be realigned once a common structural
element is identified for a set of sequences that do not
have sufficient sequence identity. Here these sequences
are then aligned to maintain similarity in structure.

While an analysis of sequences from organisms that
spanned the entire tree of life revealed parts of the
rRNA that are conserved in primary and secondary
structure, this analysis also revealed sequences and secondary structural elements that are only common to a
subset of RNAs under study. These patterns of the variation and conservation in the rRNA are characteristic
of an organism or group of organisms’ location on the
phylogenetic tree. The determination of the common
secondary structure proceeds in stages. Each secondary
structure model is considered a hypothesis that is tested
with each new sequence. As the number and diversity in
the sequences increases, the structure models are modified. Some previously proposed base pairings are
removed when both positions of a predicted base pair
do not have a similar pattern of variation while new
base pairs are predicted relative to the increase in the
number and variation in sequences when analyzed with
improved, more sensitive covariation algorithms. Every
secondary structure model is not determined de novo;
instead every new secondary structure we model with
comparative analysis is derived from the previously proposed secondary structures that are the most similar in
sequence. Thus, as this determination of secondary
structures proceeds from the root of the tree to the
outer branches, the newly determined secondary structure has less and less variation from the template structure it is derived from. The Comparative RNA
Website (CRW) [17], http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu
contains more than 1000 rRNA secondary structure diagrams. More secondary structure diagrams are continually determined to increase the sampling of organisms
that span the entire tree of life, thus capturing more of
the variations that are usually diagnostic of a group of
related organisms. Molluscan rRNA structures determined previous [51] were used to derive the comparative structure models of the oyster mitochondrial
rRNAs. Additional details for the methods and predicted
structure models are available at the CRW http://www.
rna.ccbb.utexas.edu/, http://www.rna.ccbb.utexas.edu/
