Abstract
Background: Current protein clustering methods rely on either sequence or functional
similarities between proteins, thereby limiting inferences to one of these areas.
Results: Here we report a new approach, named CLAN, which clusters proteins according to
both annotation and sequence similarity. This approach is extremely fast, clustering the complete
SwissProt database within minutes. It is also accurate, recovering consistent protein families
agreeing on average in more than 97% with sequence-based protein families from Pfam.
Discrepancies between sequence- and annotation-based clusters were scrutinized and the reasons
reported. We demonstrate examples for each of these cases, and thoroughly discuss an example
of a propagated error in SwissProt: a vacuolar ATPase subunit M9.2 erroneously annotated as
vacuolar ATP synthase subunit H. CLAN algorithm is available from the authors and the CLAN
database is accessible at http://maine.ebi.ac.uk:8000/cgi-bin/clan/ClanSearch.pl
Conclusions: CLAN creates refined function-and-sequence specific protein families that can be
used for identification and annotation of unknown family members. It also allows easy identification
of erroneous annotations by spotting inconsistencies between similarities on annotation and
sequence levels.

Background
To achieve high quality of annotation, curators are using
direct evidence from additional experiments or infer functional roles by sequence similarity to experimentally characterized genes or proteins. However, erroneous
annotations generated at early stages may propagate to
new homologous sequences, ultimately leading to erroneous annotation of entire families. The number of database
errors is known to grow with time, as the number of
entries and errors tend to accumulate. A recent analysis
suggested that as databases grow annotation errors may
propagate at an exponential rate [1].

One of the most accurate and consistently annotated databases is SwissProt [2] – a manually curated protein
sequence database which strives to provide a high level of
annotations such as the description of the function of a
protein, its domain structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc. All entries in SwissProt are annotated
by experts, thus reducing the amount of errors expected
from fully automatic methods.
This impressive collection of textual information provides
excellent opportunities for natural language processing in
computational biology. Text mining of the free text in biomedical literature is well established (see [3] for a recent
review). These methods use standard techniques such as

the TF-IDF method, which considers background frequency of terms and the frequency of terms in the documents of interest. However, protein annotations are
conceptually different from the free text of biomedical
articles and abstracts upon which these methods are
applied.
While articles normally contain thousands of words and
abstracts contain a few hundred, annotations are limited
to a few key terms, averaging 7 and rarely exceeding 20
words. Research articles are always unique, whereas
orthologous proteins often have identical annotations.
On the other hand, differences in annotations may or may
not signal difference in function, depending on the context. For example, the addition of the word "precursor" to
the annotation does not imply functional variation. Also,
multiple occurrence of a term in an article or an abstract
signals its higher relevance to the subject. In contrast, presence of a term in a protein annotation normally signals
presence of a function, and its repetition is meaningless.
All these differences require the development of a different method for clustering protein annotations.
This work describes a method called CLAN specially
developed to assess the consistency of annotations. CLAN
allows the rapid comparison of protein annotations, finding all proteins that are considered to have the same (or a
closely related) function, according to the functional
descriptions of the corresponding database entries. To
group pairwise hits between these proteins, clustering of
connected components was used, and sequence similarity
within the clusters was considered. Using CLAN, an exemplar error was identified in the annotation of the M9.2
(M9.7) subunit of a vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase).

Results
General statistics
We used CLAN [see Methods] to cluster SwissProt entries
based on annotation strings. We experimented with score
cut-offs [see Figure 1 and Methods for derivation of
scores] between 10-2 and 10-6. Depending on the threshold, the output contained between 2,070,221 (for e ≤ 106) and 3,980,763 (e ≤ 10-2) pairwise annotation similarities. The output of CLAN was subjected to clustering of
connected components, resulting in 43,416 (e ≤ 10-2) up
to 47,344 (e ≤ 10-4) clusters, including singletons. When a
lower score threshold was used, the number of clusters in
the output decreased, as more proteins were excluded
from any clusters (see below).

A sample of few hundred of the annotation clusters was
examined manually to assess whether they contained proteins annotated as functionally unrelated. At the low score
cut-offs, we failed to find any such examples, thus suggesting a high degree of specificity. Also, hypothetical proteins

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/24

were correctly not grouped together, which reflects their
singularity in the protein function space. However, at
these cut-off values, proteins annotated with a single word
(i.e. Plastocyanin) failed to pass the threshold of meaningful annotation. This effect is due to the fact that no single term has a sufficiently low frequency to provide an
score below the threshold. In total, 29,845 entries were
not even defined as singletons (these include both characterized and hypothetical proteins) as their annotation
strings are non-descriptive, resulting in high scores above
the threshold.
On the other hand, at the highest score threshold the
method succeeds in clustering together many single-word
annotations. However, this increase in sensitivity is counter-balanced by a decrease in specificity. At the score of 102, the biggest cluster contains proteins annotated as
"Hypothetical X kDa protein in Y intergenic region",
where X is the calculated protein molecular weight and Y
is the genomic location. These proteins are most probably
unrelated, perform different functions or may not be
expressed at all, and thus should not be clustered together.
In fact, this cluster is eliminated at score cut-off of 10-3.
Comparison to Pfam database
To estimate how well annotation clusters correspond to
the sequence-based protein families, we compared the
CLAN clusters (e ≤ 10-2) to the Pfam-A database [4]. This
database is a curated semi-automatic collection of protein
domains, defined by experts as sharing sequence (and
usually functional) similarity. To perform a meaningful
comparison, we used only CLAN clusters containing more
than 3 members. We found that on average 91% of CLAN
cluster members belong to a single Pfam family.

However, the reverse relationship does not hold: only
51% of Pfam entries correspond to a single CLAN cluster,
on average. This suggests that annotation-based clusters
are about twice as small and contain only parts of
sequence-based families. This is partially due to inconsistent annotation of protein families discussed below. On
the other hand, it also reflects multifunctionality and
diversification of some protein families. For example, a
single Malate and Lactate dehydrogenase (MDH/LDH)
family from Pfam is divided by CLAN to distinct annotation families, thus providing a finer distinction between
family members that can be used for more accurate annotation of functional specificity [5].
As many of the CLAN clusters which correspond to several
Pfam families contain multi-subunit complexes or multidomain proteins, a rigorous domain detection procedure
is expected to drastically improve this result. For the
results of the combination of CLAN annotation clusters

with sequence-based clustering, see the section describing
the CLAN database.
Though SwissProt annotation is not independent from
Pfam assignments and often depend on them, a few clusters were found that did not correspond to Pfam families.
Thus, CLAN system might facilitate identification and
rapid incorporation of new families to curated protein
family databases such as Pfam.

teins. For this, we compared protein sequences within
annotation clusters using BlastP program [6]. Overall, we
found very consistent sequence similarity relationships
within annotation clusters. The proteins participating in
the annotation clusters usually formed tight protein families, with all (or most) proteins sharing detectable
sequence similarity to the other cluster members. This pattern is expected, since protein annotation is usually based
upon sequence similarity. We considered this pattern to
be typical and examined any deviations from it.

Analysis of individual clusters
We aimed to determine whether similarity of the annotation corresponds to the sequence similarity of the pro-

Analysis of sequence similarity within annotation-based
families identified the following exceptions to the consistent similarity patterns between all family members.
1. Fragments of proteins. The fragments often fail to produce significant Blast scores, thus appearing as singletons
on the similarity graph.
2. Taxa – specific forms of enzymes that form separate
protein families, such as Bacterial and Archaeal adenylate
kinases, forming distinctive sequence-based families.
3. Non-orthologous gene displacements, such as malate
dehydrogenases.
4. Protein complexes. Annotation – derived families often
included multiple chains/subunits of protein complexes,
such as Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunits
A, C, D and E.
5. False positives of CLAN. The only case found so far
involves the 'hypothetical protein' cluster, appearing at
the permissive score cut-off 0.01 (see previous section).
6. SwissProt annotation errors.
Fragments
SwissProt contains 7,232 entries annotated as "fragment".
These are normally short fragments of larger protein molecules. An extreme example is LUXE_VIBFI (3 residues
only), a fragment of Long-chain-fatty-acid-luciferin-component ligase. The complete sequence from a related
Vibrio species documented in SwissProt (LUXE_VIBHA)
contains 378 residues. There are at least 71 entries annotated as "fragment", whose sequences are less then 10 residues long. As their sequence often contains a subset from
full-length close homologs, the information from these
fragments is often redundant. Also, these short fragments
fail to produce significant scores in any sequence similarity search procedure, and thus are usually irrelevant for
sequence search engines. Moreover, fragments often create noise in sequence alignments and HMM analyses creating pseudo-conserved domains, and pseudo-gaps. In
summary, we question the value of the presence of short
protein fragments in a manually curated database, aiming
for maximum precision rather then maximum coverage.
Taxa-specific forms of enzymes
In some taxa, proteins performing identical functions
might diverge to a point where they are defined as separate sequence-based families, sharing marginal similarity.
One such example is the bacterial and archaeal adenylate
kinases. Though similar at the 3-dimensional level [7], the
sequences of members of these families diverged beyond

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/24

recognition by BlastP, and are thus considered as separate
families.
Non-orthologous gene displacements
Enzymes belonging to different structural families may
perform identical cellular function. In this case, annotation does not provide enough information about the type
of the family a particular enzyme belongs to. One such
case is represented by glucokinases, which belong to different families but perform identical function. For example, GNTK_BACSU and GNTK_ECOLI are both
glucokinases and are annotated as such, were thus clustered together by CLAN but are unrelated to each other
[8].
Protein complexes
Subunits in protein complexes often have almost identical
annotation. For example, Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunits A, C, D, and E differ only in the
chain identifier. The annotation of the subunits is somewhat misleading, as subunits A, B and C form one form of
a rather ubiquitous complex [9], and subunits D and E
form an alternative archaeal-specific complex [10]. Each
of the chains forms a tight sequence-similarity based family, with no similarity detected between chains. Entries
describing chains A, C, D and E appear in a single CLAN
cluster. Interestingly, a few organisms have the entire
complexes annotated in SwissProt (Table 1), although in
many cases the documentation of these protein complexes is incomplete. The CLAN approach can help to
identify the organisms where the chains remain to be
identified, while the phylogenetic pattern of the complex
may serve as an additional evidence for further
annotation.
Annotation errors
Finally, CLAN can serve as a powerful tool to identify
annotation errors. Overall, we found SwissProt annotations very consistent and robust. Most of the annotationbased sets resulted in tight sequence-based similarity clusters. A few cases where no similarity was found between a
protein and the rest of the cluster were normally due to
the limits in sensitivity by BlastP, and the homology was
clear when multiple alignments, profile- or HMM-based
search methods were used. Nevertheless, there are cases
where annotation is problematic. Below, we discuss in
detail an example of inconsistency found in the annotation of a cluster containing vacuolar H-ATPase.
False annotation example: Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit
M9.2
When analyzing the output of CLAN with score threshold
10-6, we found an interesting example of a propagated
error. The protein VAOH_CAEEL (Q20591) from
Caenorhabditis elegans has been annotated as "Probable

vacuolar ATP synthase subunit H (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase
H subunit) (Vacuolar proton pump H subunit)". This protein is clustered by CLAN with other vacuolar ATP
synthase subunits. However, BlastP alignment failed to
produce evidence of similarity between this protein and
other members of the cluster annotated as vacuolar ATP
synthase subunit H. Also, this protein is much shorter
then other members of the annotation cluster, comprising
only of 96 residues, while other members of the cluster
have more then 400 residues. In fact, C. elegans was
reported to contain another two V-ATPase H subunits,
with length of 451 and 470 residues that share substantial
sequence similarity with other members of the family.
Multiple alignments of the family suggested that
VA0H_CAEEL is a distant protein not related to the rest of
the family. The SwissProt entry does not contain a link to
a published work. A PSI-Blast search against the NCBI NR
database allowed to identify other members of the family.
The family was first described in the literature as "M9.2 VATPase subunit" in bovine [11]. Interestingly, an appropriate sequence entry exists in SwissProt with an adequate
reference (VA0H_BOVIN). However, this protein is
named in SwissProt as "vacuolar ATP synthase subunit
H", and the name V-ATPase M9.2 subunit is suggested as
a synonym. Another SwissProt entry (VA0H_HUMAN)
contains a human homolog, with identical annotation.
Interestingly, the bovine and human proteins were unified into a separate annotation cluster at score 10-6, which
was unified with other members of "vacuolar ATP synthase subunit" cluster at lower score cut-offs.
The M9.2 V-ATPase subunits were identified in mammals
[11,12], insects [11,13] and C. elegans [11]. The alternative names included "M9.7" or subunit 'e' in insects
[14,15] and ATP6H in dog [12]. A potential homolog was
identified in the plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (gi
26986112) [16]. Using PSI-BLAST searches we have identified homologs in several other species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Anopheles gambiae and a few paralogs in

Drosophila melanogaster. The multiple alignment of these
proteins is provided as supplementary data.
The M9.2 protein was suggested to be a homolog [11] of
yeast Vma21p protein (VM21_YEAST). The Vma21p protein is required for assembly of the V-ATPase, but is not
found in the mature complex [17]. The orthology of the
two proteins was suggested based on the weak sequence
identity, association with V-ATPase complex, and a similar hydrophobicity profile [11]. However, the doubts concerning orthology of the two proteins were already
expressed [14]. While Vma21p is localized in endoplasmic reticulum and is not a part of the mature V-ATPase
[17], M9.2 is a subunit of mature V-ATPase located in the
vacuolar membrane [11]. In addition, the topology of the
yeast protein seems to be inverse to that of the mammalian and insect proteins: glycosylation at the C-terminus
of the M. sexta protein indicates that the C-terminus is
exposed to the extracellular surface, whereas the C-terminus of Vma21p appears to be localized on the cytosolic
side of the membrane [14]. To identify any similarity
between these two protein families, we used sequenceversus-sequence (BlastP), sequence to profile (PSI-BLAST)
[6], and profile-profile (LAMA) [18] search methods. Each
of these methods failed to detect any significant similarity
between the two families. Our sequence analysis suggests
that the initial reports of such homology between these
families were not substantial, and the reported marginal
similarity between the two sequences was due to the
extent of hydrophobic regions in the two protein families.
In summary, while the exact function of the M9.2 subunit
of V-ATPase is still not known, it has a turbulent history of
misinterpretation. It was confused with V-ATPase H chain
in SwissProt, it was misaligned with yeast Vmi21p protein, it has several names in different organisms of which
the name 'subunit e' is most confusing, as there is already
a 'subunit E' in the complex. The current study used (i)
CLAN to detect the discrepancies for protein annotation
in SwissProt and (ii) sensitive sequence searches in order

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:24

to demonstrate the independent status of this protein
family.
The error in the annotation of M9.2 subunit of V-ATPase
was reported to the SwissProt developers, and is likely to
be corrected at the time of publication of this work.
False negative example
Another form of annotation error results in a false negative case for CLAN. It occurs when a protein clearly
belongs to a certain family but is not annotated as such.
This event can be detected when several CLAN families
map to a single sequence similarity-based family. One
example is SUCD_BACSU, annotated as " Succinyl-CoA
synthetase alpha chain (EC 6.2.1.5) (SCS-alpha)". This
protein belongs to the SUCD family of proteins, and
should cluster with its other members. However, its annotation contains synonyms " (Vegetative protein 239)
(VEG239)", which makes this protein virtually unique in
annotation space. Another well-known example is the initial characterization of some general stress proteins in bacteria, later shown to be ribosomal proteins (e.g. S1, L25)
[19] – the initial annotations have not been modified.
This type of assignments are usually based on genetics
experiments and do not reflect the precise biochemical
function of these proteins. In fact, there are multiple
examples of proteins having unique or phenotype-based
identifiers in their names, whereas it is clear that these
proteins belong to larger protein families of known biochemical function. In our opinion, these proteins are
examples of conflicting annotation with other family
members and their annotations should be amended.

The clan database
Based on the results described above, we designed a database using the CLAN output with score threshold of 10-2.
The CLAN database contains two levels of clustering. The
first level contains clusters based on comparison of protein annotations, as described in the Methods section. To
ensure completeness and reliability of the results, any protein annotated as 'fragment' was excluded from further
processing. The second level in the database is generated
by applying sequence-similarity-based grouping to each
of the clusters obtained in the first stage. All members
within annotation clusters are aligned using BlastP. The
output of BlastP is subjected to various clustering procedures. In order to distinguish between the annotationbased clusters of the first database level, and the sequencebased sub-clusters of the second level, we call these 'clusters' and 'sub-clusters' accordingly. When referring to both
these categories simultaneously, we use the notation
(sub)clusters.
To estimate the contribution from the second level of clustering, we repeated the comparison to Pfam database,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/24

using sub-clusters instead of clusters. We found that on
average 97% of CLAN sub-clusters members belong to a
single Pfam family, (compared to the 91% for clusters).
The gain in selectivity was accompanied by gain in sensitivity, and 66% of Pfam family members corresponded to
a single sub-cluster (compared to 51% for clusters). Compared to annotation-based clustering alone, the dramatic
increase in the sensitivity reflects the fact that in the second level of clustering, non-homologous sequences are
removed and form separate sub-clusters.
The CLAN database has a web-based interactive interface,
located at http://maine.ebi.ac.uk:8000/cgi-bin/clan/Clan
Search.pl. To facilitate database navigation, we introduced
(sub)cluster names, computed as a minimal consensus
string for all (sub)cluster members. The MySQL-based
storage of data allows fast searches based on sequence or
cluster name, SwissProt accession or cluster identifier. The
sequence similarity within clusters can be examined visually using the BioLayout software [20]. To facilitate the
annotation of protein complexes, phylogenetic distribution of clusters between sub-clusters (such as Table 1) can
be automatically generated upon the user's request. For all
sub-clusters full-length multiple alignments are pre-computed with the ClustalW program [21], and the alignments can be viewed via an interactive Java interface.

Discussion
We have presented CLAN, a rapid and powerful method
to build consistent annotation-based families, and
assessed the consistency of annotation in protein databases. We have also presented the CLAN database, as a
collection of protein families grouped by function. We
believe that these tools can be used to improve the quality
of database curation and assist annotation of newly
sequenced proteins.
The double-step clustering presented here has resulted in
the creation of a reliable database of protein families, with
include proteins similar on both annotation and
sequence levels. One of the potential uses of this database
is an accurate assignment of function to newly sequenced
proteins by protein – to – profile alignments or HMMs.
Our method has the potential to distinguish between subtle changes that might reflect diversification of protein
function. For example, homologous Malate and Lactate
dehydrogenases are found in different (sub)clusters,
allowing their characterization as separate protein families. As most protein family databases group proteins by
homology, as opposed to function, to the best of our
knowledge, our approach is unique in its ability to build
protein sequence families distinguishing between functions. In the future, other such comparisons could include
other structural classifications such as CATH [22] or

TRIBEs [23] and functional classifications such as EC or
GO [24].

We used SwissProt release of Feb 13, 2003 that contained
121,744 protein sequences. We aimed to find the similarity between the database entries solely based on the annotation and without any reference to sequence similarity.
The annotation corpus considered here consisted of
description line (protein name) and synonyms from the
SwissProt database. We interchangeably use the term
'function' or 'annotation' to denote the contents of this
corpus, implying the use of the corresponding annotation
strings from the database.
Definition of distance measure between annotation fields
To obtain a distance measure, we first calculated the frequency φ of each word as the number of database entries
containing the word N divided by the total number of
entries in the database D (Equation 1). The word frequencies served as weights, because the words describing specific functions (such as "plastocyanin") occur less
frequently than non-specific words (such as "protein").

We aimed to devise a scoring scheme that would produce
highly significant scores for proteins with related function, while being able to distinguish between proteins
with different functions. The score for the common terms
p between protein functions may be computed as the
product of frequencies of n terms shared between the two
annotations (Equation 2).
i =n

p = ∏ φi
i =1

However, sharing only part of the total number of significant words is insufficient: proteins may use similar substrates for different reactions, or perform similar chemical
reactions on different substrates. There may be three proteins with annotations AB, BC, and CD respectively, and
clustering by similarity only could lead to clustering
together AB and CD. For example, "lactate dehydrogenase" should be differentiated from "lactate permease" or
"alcohol dehydrogenase".
To achieve this distinction, we computed the difference
between the two annotations, as above, for the case of the
similarity measure. The score for the unique terms q is the
product of frequencies of m terms unique to any of the
two annotations (Equation 3).

Finally, the distance e between the two annotations is
defined as the fraction between the score for common
terms p and the score for unique terms q for the two annotation strings (Equation 4). We refer to this scoring function as 'score' throughout the manuscript.

An example of calculation of the score is shown on Figure

Implementation
The procedure calculating pairwise distances between protein annotations described above was implemented in a
perl program. Its sole input consists of SwissProt identifiers and annotation lines, and the output contains pairs of
proteins with the score of annotation similarity lower
than a given threshold. Compared to sequence-similarity
clustering, this procedure is very rapid: an all-against-all
comparison of SwissProt database containing 121,744
entries took about 26 minutes on a single processor of a
Sun-Fire-480R server with 2 GB of RAM.

The result of the pairwise comparisons between protein
annotations were then subjected to clustering of connected components. The protein sequences of the clusters
obtained were subsequently analyzed with the BlastP program [6] and the results of similarities were clustered
using GeneRage algorithm [25]. The results were visualized using the BioLayout software [20] (and Goldovsky,
Cases et al., submitted). To evaluate the ability of CLAN to
detect genuine protein families on the basis of annotation
alone, the output (e ≤ 10-2) was compared to the Pfam-A
database release 9.0 [4]. For each CLAN cluster with more
then 3 entries, we have identified the corresponding Pfam
entry (if available), and counted the fraction of CLAN
entries found in the same Pfam cluster. The reverse comparison was computed in a similar manner.
