Abstract
Background: Microsporidia, parasitic fungi-related eukaryotes infecting many cell types in a wide
range of animals (including humans), represent a serious health threat in immunocompromised
patients. The 2.9 Mb genome of the microsporidium Encephalitozoon cuniculi is the smallest known
of any eukaryote. Eukaryotic protein kinases are a large superfamily of enzymes with crucial roles
in most cellular processes, and therefore represent potential drug targets. We report here an
exhaustive analysis of the E. cuniculi genomic database aimed at identifying and classifying all protein
kinases of this organism with reference to the kinomes of two highly-divergent yeast species,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
Results: A database search with a multi-level protein kinase family hidden Markov model library
led to the identification of 29 conventional protein kinase sequences in the E. cuniculi genome, as
well as 3 genes encoding atypical protein kinases. The microsporidian kinome presents striking
differences from those of other eukaryotes, and this minimal kinome underscores the importance
of conserved protein kinases involved in essential cellular processes. ~30% of its kinases are
predicted to regulate cell cycle progression while another ~28% have no identifiable homologues
in model eukaryotes and are likely to reflect parasitic adaptations. E. cuniculi lacks MAP kinase
cascades and almost all protein kinases that are involved in stress responses, ion homeostasis and
nutrient signalling in the model fungi S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, including AMPactivated protein
kinase (Snf1), previously thought to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes. A detailed database search and
phylogenetic analysis of the kinomes of the two model fungi showed that the degree of homology
between their kinomes of ~85% is much higher than that previously reported.
Conclusion: The E. cuniculi kinome is by far the smallest eukaryotic kinome characterised to date.
The difficulty in assigning clear homology relationships for nine out of the twenty-nine
microsporidian conventional protein kinases despite its compact genome reflects the phylogenetic

distance between microsporidia and other eukaryotes. Indeed, the E. cuniculi genome presents a
high proportion of genes in which evolution has been accelerated by up to four-fold. There are no
orthologues of the protein kinases that constitute MAP kinase pathways and many other protein
kinases with roles in nutrient signalling are absent from the E. cuniculi kinome. However,
orthologous kinases can nonetheless be identified that correspond to members of the yeast
kinomes with roles in some of the most fundamental cellular processes. For example, E. cuniculi has
clear orthologues of virtually all the major conserved protein kinases that regulate the core cell
cycle machinery (Aurora, Polo, DDK, CDK and Chk1). A comprehensive comparison of the
homology relationships between the budding and fission yeast kinomes indicates that, despite an
estimated 800 million years of independent evolution, the two model fungi share ~85% of their
protein kinases. This will facilitate the annotation of many of the as yet uncharacterised fission yeast
kinases, and also those of novel fungal genomes.

Background
The microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a small
spore-forming unicellular eukaryote leading an obligate
intracellular parasitic lifestyle [1]. Inside a parasitophorous vacuole, the life cycle comprises three major phases:
invasion with a polar tube system, proliferation with
binary fission (merogony), and spore differentiation.
Mitosis is of the closed type and dense structures called
'spindle pole bodies' resemble those of yeast. Chitin, a
major polysaccharide of the fungal cell wall, is present in
the inner part of the microsporidian spore wall. Trehalose,
a disaccharide frequently found in fungi, has also been
detected in microsporidia. The parasite's infections have
medical importance since its hosts include various mammals, including humans, where it is known to cause digestive and clinical syndromes affecting the nervous system
in HIV-infected or cyclosporine-treated patients [1].
The small and compact 2.9 Mb genome of E. cuniculi has
recently been sequenced and characterised [2,3]. It split
into 11 linear chromosomes harbouring 1,997 proteincoding sequences in a tightly clustered configuration. This
degree of compaction has been achieved partly by reducing rDNA sequences as well as many protein-coding genes
and intergenic regions [3]. E. cuniculi is therefore a microbial eukaryote that is highly-adapted to its parasitic lifestyle, and its genome sequence provides an opportunity
for cataloguing the proteins that constitute its signal transduction networks. This understanding should shed light
into the molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity and,
from a wider perspective, on the minimal protein kinasebased signal transduction requirements of a eukaryotic
intracellular parasite.
Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a central role in
most cellular processes (in eukaryotic cells ~30% of proteins carry phosphate groups, [4,5]). Deregulation of protein phosphorylation is at the origin of several
pathologies (e.g. cancers and neurodegenerative diseases)
and protein kinases are now considered promising drug

targets [see e.g. [6,7]]. Indeed, the first kinase inhibitors to
be developed as drugs have recently been made available
on the market [8,9].
The currently accepted classification of protein kinases
splits the protein kinase superfamily into 'conventional'
protein kinases (ePKs) and 'atypical' protein kinases
(aPKs). ePKs are the largest group and have been sub-classified into 8 families by examining sequence similarity
between catalytic domains, the presence of accessory
domains, and by considering modes of regulation
[10,11]. The 8 ePK families are: the AGC family (including
cyclic-nucleotide and calcium-phospholipid-dependent
kinases, ribosomal S6-phosphorylating kinases, Gproteincoupled kinases, and all close relatives of these groups);
the CAMKs (calmodulin-regulated kinases); the CK1 family (casein kinase 1, and close relatives); the CMGC family
(including cyclin-dependent kinases, mitogen-activated
protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinases [GSK3], and
CDK-like kinases [CKLs]); the RGC family (receptor guanylate cyclase, which are similar in domain sequence to
tyrosine kinases); the STE family (including many kinases
functioning in MAP kinase cascades); the TK family (tyrosine kinases); and the TKL family (tyrosine kinase-like
kinases). A ninth group, called the 'Other' group, consists
of a mixed collection of kinases that could not be classified easily into the previous ePK families. The aPKs are a
small set of protein kinases that do not share clear
sequence similarity with ePKs but have been shown experimentally to have protein kinase activity [11], and comprise the following bona fide families [12]: Alpha
(exemplified by myosin heavy chain kinase of Dictyostelium discoideum); PIKK (phosphatidyl inositol 3' kinaserelated kinases); PDHK (pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinases); and RIO ('right open reading frame' as it was one
of two adjacent genes that were found to be transcribed
divergently from the same intergenic region [13]).
Protein kinases controlling the proliferation and development of parasitic eukaryotes represent attractive drug tarPage 2 of 21

gets, because (i) they are likely to be essential to parasite
multiplication and/or development; and (ii) these
enzymes display structural and functional divergence
when compared to their mammalian counterparts, suggesting that specific inhibition can be achieved [14-16].
Furthermore, the importance of protein kinases in most
crucial cellular processes makes them interesting subjects
of fundamental investigations into the cell biology of parasitic eukaryotes. The availability of the entire genome
sequences of several parasites permits the study of their
protein kinase complements (their 'kinomes'). Hence,
two recent studies [17,18] reported the characterisation of
the kinomes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium-falciparum, showing that this organism possesses 85 (or 99,
depending on the criteria used in the two studies) conventional protein kinases. A more recent and comparative
study of the kinomes of all Apicomplexa species whose
genome sequence is available has found the number of
proteins kinases for the P. falciparum kinome to be 87ePKs
and 3aPKs (Miranda-Saavedra, D. et al, manuscript submitted). The published kinomes of the Trypanosomatid
species Leishmaniamajor, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi indicate that these parasites harbour between
176 (T. brucei) and 199 (L. major) kinases, most of which
are orthologous across the three Trypanosomatid species
[19]. These kinomes compare to kinomes of 478, 115 and
106 conventional protein kinases in human, fission yeast
and budding yeast, respectively [11,20,21]. Here, we
present an analysis of the kinome of E. cuniculi, and show
that this organism has the smallest characterised kinome
of all eukaryotes examined to date.

Results and discussion
The kinome of E. cuniculi
The 1,997 predicted peptides of E. cuniculi were scanned
with a multi-level HMM library of the kinase catalytic
domain. This library is especially sensitive for retrieving
kinase catalytic domain sequences from databases and, at
the same time, does an automatic classification of kinases
into families [12]. The application of the HMM library
retrieved 32 protein kinases in E. cuniculi (Table 1), two of
which lacked critical residues that confer catalytic activity
and which may therefore be pseudokinases [22]. The
HMM library has also been shown to be selective enough
to classify some kinases of the 'Other' group of S. cerevisiae
into the main ePK families [12]. Among the ePKs, E.
cuniculi was found to harbour 4 kinases of the AGC family, 5 CAMKs, 2 CK1s, 12 CMGCs, 1 TKL, and 5 kinases
which, by complete clustering analysis with the kinomes
of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (see below), were found to
belong to the 'Other' group. E. cuniculi was also found to
encode 3 atypical protein kinases (aPKs): 2 of the PIKK
family and one of the RIO family. No kinases of the ePK
families RGC, TK, or FIKK (a family identified in P. falci-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/309

parum and apparently specific to Apicomplexa), or of the
aPK families Alpha or PDHK, were found.
The largest protein kinase family in E. cuniculi was thus
found to be the CMGC, most members of which are
involved in the control of cell proliferation. The CMGC is
also the largest family in Trypanosomatids [19], in P. falciparum [17], and in other Apicomplexa (Miranda-Saavedra, D. et al., submitted). Interestingly, no kinases of the
STE or NIMA families were found, explaining the lack of
success in amplifying microsporidian MAPK homologues
by PCR (Thellier and Doerig, unpublished). It has been
noted that P. falciparum also lacks canonical 3-component
MAPKKK-MAKK-MAPK cascades [17]. The three Trypanosomatid species L. major, T. brucei and T. cruzi are known
to possess kinases of the Ste7, Ste11, and Ste20 subfamilies [19]. Their kinomes are ~2.5 times larger than
that of P. falciparum, suggesting that MAP kinase cascades
might have an ancestral origin, and which might have
been lost in streamlined kinomes such as those of E.
cuniculi or the malaria parasite.
TKLs have previously been found in Metazoa, Apicomplexan parasites, Entamoeba histolytica, and the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. These findings, together
with the observation that the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and Phanerochaetechrysosporium contain putative TKLs,
suggests that TKLs have been lost secondarily from most
fungal lineages [12]. Therefore, the finding of a putative
TKL in E. cuniculi is not too surprising. The sole member
of the TKL family in the microsporidian kinome represents the only instance of a protein kinase family found in
E. cuniculi that is not represented in either S. cerevisiae or
S. pombe (Table 1).
The kinomes of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe and their
homology relationships with the E. cuniculi kinome
The kinome of S. cerevisiae was the first to be described
[21], followed by those of several higher eukaryotic organisms published by the same group and now available
through KinBase [23]. The budding yeast kinome consists
of 115 conventional protein kinase (ePK) and 9 atypical
protein kinase (aPK) sequences. It has previously been
noted that among the aPKs, there is evidence for protein
phosphorylation activity only for members of the PIKK,
PDHK, RIO, and Alpha families [12]. The kinome of S.
pombe was described recently [20] as part of a study that
incorporated the systematic deletion of each of the fission
yeast kinases and analysis of the mutant phenotype.
Bimbó et al. [20] identified 106 ePKs by interrogating
public databases for sequences that had been annotated as
kinases, but the aPKs were not considered. Computational analysis suggested that fission yeast contains no
tyrosine kinases [20]. Thirty-one ePKs were considered as
likely to have a 'tyrosine kinase signature' (although the

identity of this signature was not indicated) and 67/106
(63.2%) ePKs were found to have direct homologues in S.
cerevisiae as defined by mutual best-hit analysis. Deletion
analysis of ePK genes indicated that 17/106 ePKs (16%)
are essential for cell viability. Of the remaining 89 ePKs,
deletion phenotypes were assessed under various stress
conditions. 46% of these non-essential ePKs of fission
yeast were found to exhibit hypersensitivity to at least one
of the 17 stress factors tested, allowing the functional
grouping of fission yeast ePKs into 4 major signalling
pathways according to the nature of the stress.
We have carried out an independent database search for
ePKs and aPKs in S. pombe and have identified 3 additional ePKs, one of which is the fission yeast homologue
of S. cerevisiae Bud32p (SPAP27G11.07: Table 2). Thus,
the kinome of S. pombe was found to consist of 109 ePKs
and 8 aPKs (Table 2). Both the kinomes of S. cerevisiae and
S. pombe lack kinases of the families RGC, TK, and Alpha.
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that 91/109 (83.5%) of
ePKs of fission yeast share a homologue in S. cerevisiae;

likewise 96/115 (83.5%) of ePKs of S. cerevisiae have a
homologue in S. pombe. With the inclusion of aPKs (i.e.
considering the two complete kinomes) 100/117 (85.5%)
of S. pombe kinases have homologues in S. cerevisiae
(Table 3). The same was found to be true for 104/124
(83.9%) of S. cerevisiae kinases. Therefore, the degree of
homology between the kinomes of the two fungi is ~20%
greater than previously reported [20]. Part of the improvement is because the multilevel HMM library produces an
automatic classification of protein kinases into families.
The advantage of doing family-family comparisons, and
the subsequent generation of multiple alignments and
phylogenetic analysis for each family, is that proteins that
are closer sequence-wise make better alignments. Since a
phylogenetic tree is only as good as the underlying alignment, splitting the kinases into families prior to generating phylogenies is a more powerful method for
comparing entire kinomes. Since our analysis shows that
there are up to 16 instances of potentially redundant paralogous ePK pairs in fission yeast (Table 3) it is likely that
the proportion that are essential has been underestimated

if paralogue pairs that can complement each other's function are included, and the real value is probably over 20%.
Similar considerations in budding yeast also suggest that
over 20% of protein kinase activities are essential for vegetative growth.
The establishment of homology relationships between
the kinomes of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (Table 3),
together with additional information extracted from the
Saccharomyces Genome Database [24,25] and Pombase
[26], sets a powerful scene for cross-annotating the
kinomes of these model organisms and, by extension, of
other fungal kinomes that will be characterised in the near
future (Table 3). Homology relationships between the
kinomes of S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and E. cuniculi will be
discussed below on a family-by-family basis.
AGC family
E. cuniculi was found to harbour four AGC kinases (a family which includes cyclic-nucleotide and calcium-phospholipid-dependent
kinases,
ribosomal
S6phosphorylating kinases, G protein-coupled kinases, and
all close relatives of these groups), three of which have
orthologues in the yeasts (Table 3, Fig. 1, Additional file
1). The previously characterised CAD25584.1 [27] is the
microsporidian homologue of yeast PKA (encoded by S.
cerevisiae TPK1-3) while CAD25568.1 is the homologue of
the yeast Ipl1p/Ark1 Aurora kinases. PKA is universally
found in eukaryotic cells and in both S. cerevisiae and S.
pombe it is involved in nutrient sensing and signalling,
sporulation and cellular stress responses [28-30].
Although
this
putative
microsporidian
PKA
(CAD25584.1) is somewhat diverged from its yeast orthologues (Fig. 1), the identification of two PKA regulatory
subunit homologues (CAD24891.1 and CAD25013.1) is
consistent with the presence of PKA in E. cuniculi [27].
PKA has an essential function in budding yeast for vegetative growth [31] and is required in fission yeast for spore

germination in response to glucose, but not for vegetative
growth itself [20,28]. A major role of the S. cerevisiae
Aurora kinase Ipl1p is to drive chromosome biorientation
on the mitotic spindle by promoting detachment of kinetochores from microtubules when both sister chromatids
are attached to microtubules from the same spindle pole
[32,33]. The presence of an orthologue in E. cuniculi
(CAD25568.1) and its binding partner Sli15
(CAD26983.1) suggests that this vital role is likely to be
conserved in all eukaryotes, although Ipl1p, Ark1 and
their mammalian homologues have additional cell cycle
roles to play [34-37] that may also be important in the
microsporidian.
Of the two remaining orphan E. cuniculi kinases in this
group, one is predicted to be inactive (CAD25776.1; Table
1) while the second (CAD25005.1) clusters with yeast
Cbk1p/Orb6 and Dbf2p/Dbf20p/Sid2 (Fig. 1). These
yeast kinases are all essential (DBF2 and DBF20 are redundant and the gene knockouts show synthetic lethality in
budding yeast:[38]) and share with CAD25005.1 a protein kinase C terminal domain (PF00433) that follows the
protein kinase domain itself. Dbf2p and Dbf20p function
in the budding yeast mitotic exit network (MEN) while fission yeast Sid2 is part of the analogous septation initiation network (SIN) in fission yeast [39,40]. However,
since the Cdc15p/Cdc7 kinases that also function as
essential components of these pathways are not present in
E. cuniculi (see below), it is more likely that CAD25005.1
is functionally related to Cbk1p/Orb6. If E. cuniculi does
lack a MEN/SIN pathway this may reflect a reduced need
to coordinate cytokinesis with nuclear division, perhaps
because the relative timing of these events is sufficient to
ensure high fidelity division without specific mechanisms
to coordinate them. In budding yeast the MEN is also critical for promoting inactivation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activity (CDK) through release of the Cdc14p
phosphatase from the nucleolus, but this role is not con-

served in fission yeast [41] and so may also not be vital in
E. cuniculi. In budding yeast, Cbk1 is required for regulating cellular morphogenesis and the expression of genes
involved in cell separation [42] and in fission yeast it may
have an analogous role in coordinating morphogenesis
and cell division [43]. These roles may therefore be highly
conserved if CAD25005.1 is genuinely functionally
related to these yeast kinases. However, CAD25005.1 also
has a phorbol ester/diacylglycerol-binding C1 domain
(PF00130) that is shared with yeast protein kinase Cs,
although they are located at the opposite end of the
polypeptide to their position in, for example, budding

yeast Pkc1p, and there is no C2 domain (PF00168). Thus
perhaps the most likely scenario is that CAD25005.1 represents a somewhat divergent PKC that, like its yeast counterparts, may be activated by Rho GTPases [44-47]. In
budding yeast, Pkc1p is involved in promoting cell wall
integrity [see [48]], an essential role that it shares with its
fission yeast homologues [45].
Regarding the remaining AGC kinases present only in the
two yeasts, almost all show direct homology relationships
except for budding yeast YKL171W and fission yeast's
ppk31 and ppk33, which appear to be lineage-specific

(Table 3). Where the function of the conserved kinases is
known, it frequently concerns nutrient signalling or cell
integrity, functions that may be less important for an obligate intracellular parasite such as E. cuniculi. The PDK1
homologues are essential in both yeasts [20,49,50],
although the AKT homologues that should function
downstream of the PDK1 homologues are essential only
for vegetative growth in budding yeast [20]. Finally, since
E. cuniculi lacks a homologue of the spindle checkpoint
kinases Bub1p/Bub1 it is likely that this checkpoint mechanism is absent from the microsporidian. Although the
spindle checkpoint is important in higher eukaryotes
because of its role in the timing of mitotic events [see e.g.
[51,52]], it is non-essential in yeast under normal circumstances and is apparently dispensable in E. cuniculi.
CAMK family
Of the five CAMKs (calmodulin-regulated kinases) of E.
cuniculi, only three could be shown to be homologues of
yeast CAMKs, while the two other microsporidian CAMKs
did not cluster with characterised fungal kinases within
the same family ('semi-orphan'). CAD26208.1 is related

to Chk1p/Chk1, while CAD26242.1 and CAD26452.1 are
both related to Kin1p/Kin2p of budding yeast and Kin1/
Ppk25 of fission yeast (Table 3, Fig. 2, Additional file 2).
Given that budding yeast cells lacking both KIN1 and
KIN2 are viable [53], finding two homologues of these
kinases in E. cuniculi is surprising. In fission yeast, loss of
just one of the two isoforms (Kin1p) produced a significant morphological defect [54], so perhaps simultaneous
deletion of both isoforms will reveal a more critical role
for this group of kinases in fission yeast. It also remains
possible that a third budding yeast CAMK may function
redundantly with Kin1p and Kin2p. Budding yeast Kin1p
and Kin2p are the homologues of C. elegans Par-1 [55], a
protein kinase essential for the establishment of anteriorposterior polarity in the one-cell embryo and generally
involved in the intracellular organisation cues in various
biological systems. In E. cuniculi, the symmetric differentiation of the spore exhibits an evident anterio-posterior
polarity and the Par-1 orthologue may have a role to play
in this process. In fission yeast, loss of Kin1 causes
monopolar growth because cells fail to activate polarized
growth at their new end (termed NETO for new end take-

off: [55]). In S. cerevisiae, polarised growth takes the form
of asymmetric growth of the bud and localized fusion of
secretory vesicles at the bud tip in G1 cells until later in the
cell cycle, when re-polarisation to the bud neck occurs.
This is regulated both by changes in the actin cytoskeleton
and in the distribution of the secretory landmark protein
Sec3p, a component of the Exocyst complex [56]. It is
therefore interesting that Kin1p and Kin2p interact with
multiple components of the exocytic machinery and may
regulate the fusion of secretory vesicles with the cell surface [57]. Thus taken together, these considerations point
to a potential role of the E. cuniculi homologues in polarized secretion.
The E. cuniculi CAMK CAD26208.1 is the orthologue of
Chk1 kinase in the yeasts (Table 3, Fig. 2). Although nonessential in both yeast species, this kinase nonetheless
plays a central role in the DNA damage response, delaying
mitosis to allow time for DNA repair to occur and stimulating the expression of DNA damage repair functions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/309

[58]. In fact, in evolutionary terms Chk1 is considered the
most ancient of the major cell cycle control kinases [59],
which functions in a pathway downstream of a PIKK family member that is part of the damage sensing machinery
[58]. The presence of a Mec1p/Tel1p-related PIKK kinase
in E. cuniculi is therefore consistent with the presence of a
Chk1 orthologue. Rad53p and Cds1 (orthologues of
human Chk2 kinase) are also implicated in this checkpoint pathway, and are involved in stabilising stalled replication origins [60,61]. However, the relative importance
of the Chk1 and Rad53p/Cds1/Chk2 arms for the
response to DNA damage and stalled replication forks differs in different systems. Whereas Cds1 and Rad53 are dispensable in fission yeast, Rad53p and Mec1p are essential
in budding yeast because of an additional role in regulating dNTP levels [62,63]. Thus the single Chk1-related
kinase in E. cuniculi may play roles in both the replication
and repair aspects of this pathway.

Perhaps the biggest surprise within this family of kinases
is the apparent absence of an AMPK homologue (Snf1p in
budding yeast), an enzyme previously thought to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes. All Apicomplexan genomes (Plasmodium ssp. falciparum, berghei, chabaudi and yoelii,
Cryptosporidium ssp. hominis and parvum, Theileria ssp.
annulata and parva, and Toxoplasma gondii) contain one
AMPK orthologue (Miranda-Saavedra, D., et al., manuscript submitted), and E. cuniculi is therefore the first
eukaryote to be described that lacks AMPK. AMPK has
been termed the "fuel gauge of the cell", responding to the
AMP/ATP ratio and downregulating ATP-consuming
processes and upregulating ATP-generating processes in
response to changing cellular energy balance [64]. In budding yeast, Snf1p has not been formally shown to be AMP
regulated, but is critical for derepression of genes required
for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources once glucose (and hence fermentative generation of ATP) has been
exhausted [65]. In contrast, nothing is known about
AMPK in fission yeast although it has two apparent orthologues. Consistent with the lack of an identifiable AMPK,
E. cuniculi also lacks homologues of the protein kinases
that are required to activate Snf1p (Tos3p, Pak1p and
Elm1p, Table 3, [66]). Given that E. cuniculi has a limited
ability to generate its own ATP and that it recruits host
mitochondria close to its plasma membrane, it is likely
that it imports host ATP using the four distinct ATP/ADP
translocases that it encodes [2,67]. It may therefore have
little capacity for controlling its energy balance except
through ATP/ADP exchange with the host cell, and therefore effectively rely on regulation of host cell metabolism
by the host cell's AMPK to ensure its own energy supply.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/309

ascribed a wide range of functions [75] including vesicular
trafficking, regulation of gene expression and DNA repair
in yeast. One critical role in both yeast species is as part of
a mechanism for ensuring monopolar attachment of sister
kinetochores in meiosis I, a phenomenon that is essential
for ensuring correct disjunction of maternal and paternal
homologues [76]. However, since E. cuniculi is not
thought to undergo meiosis, this role is unlikely to be
important. Budding yeast Hrr25p is also an antagonist of
calcineurin signalling by regulating the nuclear localisation and hence activity of the NFAT family transcription
factor Crz1p [77]. This is a conserved Ca2+-signalling
pathway that, amongst other processes, is involved in Tcell activation in mammals, although in S. cerevisiae it
responds to a variety of environmental stresses that lead to
elevated intracellular Ca2+, such as high salt and alkaline
pH. Further work will be required to determine whether
either of these two critical roles are the focus of the E.
cuniculi CK1 homologues.

Budding yeast and fission yeast possess 11 and 6 lineagespecific CAMKs (i.e. with no identifiable orthologues in
the other species: Table 3). The CAMKs not represented in
E. cuniculi include budding yeast's Psk1p and Psk2p
(FUN31 and YOL045W) (involved in nutrient sensing
and metabolic regulation: [66]), Hrk1p (YOR267C) and
Ptk2p (involved in plasma membrane ATPase regulation:
[68]); Kcc4p/Gin4p/Hsl1p/Cdr1/Cdr2 (cell cycle regulators through phosphorylation of Swe1p/Wee1: [69,70]).

CMGC family
The CMGCs (cyclin-dependent kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinases [GSK3],
and CDK-like kinases [CKLs]) are the largest family of
kinases in the E. cuniculi genome and 8/12 microsporidian CMGCs can be assigned homology to a number of
yeast CMGCs that play essential roles (Table 3, Fig. 4,
Additional file 4). CAD26498.1 and CAD25731.1 are the
microsporidian homologues of budding yeast Cdc7p,
which has two paralogues in S. pombe, one of which
(Hsk1) is also essential. These kinases are DDKs (Dbf4dependent kinases), so called because they are activated
by binding to a regulatory subunit (Dbf4p in S. cerevisiae),
and they play a fundamental role in the activation of
licensed replication origins [78]. The other characterised
microsporidian CMGCs are homologues of essential cyclin-dependent
kinases
such
as
Cdc28p/Cdc2
(CAD26495.1) and Kin28p/Crk1p (CAD25174.1), the
homologue of yeast casein kinase II (CAD26671.1), the
homologue of the dual-specificity kinase Yak1p
(CAD25928.1), and the homologue of yeast TTK (Mps1p/
Mph1: CAD25082.1).

CK1 family
The two microsporidian CK1s (casein kinase 1 and close
relatives) cluster with the fungal homologues of Hrr25p
(Table 3, Fig. 3, Additional file 3), and lack the C-terminal
palmitoylation signal required for plasma membrane
localization found in the three budding yeast Yck CK1
kinases [71,72]. Budding yeast Hrr25p is essential, as is
the presence of at least one of the two redundant Yck1p
and Yck2p isoforms [73]. Although the S. pombe Hhp1
and Hhp2 appear to be co-evolution paralogues of yeast
Hhr25p, cells lacking both genes are viable [74]. CK1s in
general and S. cerevisiae's Hrr25 in particular have been

Of the cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdc28p/Cdc2 have
clearly established fundamental roles in cell division,
while the other yeast CDKs are involved in transcriptional
regulation through modulating the phosphorylation state
of the RNA pol II C-terminal domain (Ctk1p, Kin28p for
example: see [29]). Thus although E. cuniculi does not
show the full range of CDKs found in the yeasts, it nonetheless has homologues corresponding to both these
classes, indicating that the roles of CDKs as cell cycle and
RNA pol II regulators are presumably fundamental. Furthermore, at least two of the semi-orphan CMGC kinases
(CAD26039.1 and CAD26328.1) may also belong to the

CDK group, although we have not classified them as such
because they show considerable divergence from any of
the conserved fungal CDKs. In common with many protein kinases, several CDKs require activatory phosphorylation on their Tloop threonine, which is carried out in
budding yeast by Cak1p [79]. In metazoans, this role is
carried out by Cyclin H-Cdk7 rather than by a single subunit Cak1p homologue. Both systems are present in fission yeast, although the Cak1p orthologue (Csk1)
appears to be responsible for activating the Cdk7 orthologue (Crk1, also termed Mcs6), which is the direct CDK
activator in vivo [80]. Since we have found an E. cuniculi
orthologue of fission yeast Crk1 (CAD25174.1, Table 3),
it is therefore likely that this Cdk7-related kinase is
responsible for direct phosphorylation of its other CDKs
and that there is no Cak1p-related kinase.
Both yeasts have a TTK member, which is known to play
roles both in spindle pole duplication and in the spindle
checkpoint response that monitors attachment of chro-

mosomes to the mitotic spindle [81]. The spindle pole
duplication role is conserved in mammals [82] although
apparently not in fission yeast [83], and it is this function
that makes MPS1 essential in S. cerevisiae. Since E. cuniculi
lacks a Bub1p homologue (see above), another key kinase
in the checkpoint pathway, it is likely that the microsporidian TTK (CAD25082.1) is involved primarily in
spindle pole duplication.
Yeast Yak1p is a member of the conserved DYRK sub-family that is represented in fission yeast by the as yet uncharacterized Ppk15 (Table 3). Budding yeast Yap1p is
involved in glucose signalling [84] and is associated with
growth inhibition, functioning in an antagonistic manner
either downstream of or in parallel with the PKA pathway
[85,86]. The presence of a DYRK member in E. cuniculi is
therefore consistent with the presence of a PKA orthologue and suggests that the functional relationship
between PKA and DYRK has been conserved in the microsporidian.

Casein kinase II is a multifunctional enzyme with roles in
processes as diverse as cell cycle progression, cell polarity
and ion homeostasis [87,88]. The presence of an E.
cuniculi orthologue (CAD26671.1) underlines the fundamental importance of this group of kinases and is consistent with the identification of a Casein Kinase II regulatory
subunit (CAD25839.1).
Comparing the two model yeasts, most members of the
CMGC family show orthologous relationships and there
are few apparently lineage-specific 'semiorphans' (Table
3). Members of this family that are found in the yeasts but
not the microsporidian include the MAP kinases
(involved in stress-activated signal transduction pathways
and mating: [89-92]), members of the RCK sub-group
(involved in yeast meiotic regulation: [93,94]) and GSK3,
which in budding yeast is involved in meiotic induction
and in heat stress tolerance [95].
STE family
All the STE kinases (a family including many kinases functioning in MAP kinase cascades) of S. cerevisiae and S.

pombe were found to share homology relationships (Table
3, Fig. 5, Additional file 5), but no kinases of the STE family were found in E. cuniculi. The presence of putative
MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK modules in the kinomes of the
three Trypanosomatid species [19] suggests that these are
likely to have been lost in a number of reduced kinomes
such as those of P. falciparum [17], other Apicomplexa
(Miranda-Saavedra, D. et al, submitted) and E. cuniculi.
However, a number of key STE family members function
in pathways distinct from MAP kinase pathways in the
yeasts, for example Cdc15p/Cdc7 (discussed above),
which forms part of the MEN/SIN late mitotic network.
Some STE20 family members, such as budding yeast
Ste20p itself, function upstream of MAP kinase pathways
[89]. However, not all of their roles are mediated in this
way and so it seems that these other roles are not required
in E. cuniculi. Several of the STE kinases are Rho GTPaseactivated kinases (for example budding yeast Cla4p, Kic1p
and Ste20p), characterised by a PB domain that binds the
p21 GTPase and sometimes a PH domain upstream of this
[96].

Other protein kinases (OPKs)
This group is constituted by ePKs that cannot be classified
confidently into any of the main ePK families. The multilevel HMM library has been used to classify some of the
'Other' kinases of S. cerevisiae into the main ePK families
by comparison with syntenic homologous genes of the
related fungus Ashbya gossypii [12]. However, some of the
'Other' kinases of S. cerevisiae are likely to constitute yeastspecific families in their own right, and whose identity
will emerge upon examination of a larger number of fungal kinomes. Of the 5 microsporidian kinases included in
the 'Other' group, only 3 could be mapped to homologous proteins in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (Table 3, Fig. 6,
Additional file 6). CAD25400.1 is the homologue of
Bud32, which we have also now shown to be present in
fission yeast. Although named for its apparent role in S.
cerevisiae bud site selection [97], more recent studies have
identified Bud32p kinase as a component of a conserved
protein complex with important roles in transcription and

telomere maintenance [98,99], and it is likely that these
roles explain its presence in E. cuniculi.
CAD24933.1 is the orthologue of the essential polo kinase
(Cdc5p and Plo1 in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, respectively), a conserved cell cycle regulatory kinase with many
important roles in centrosome and spindle function, sister
chromatid cohesion, kinetochore function and mitotic
exit [100]. A key feature of Polo kinases is the presence of
tandem Polo Box sequences (Pfam PF00659) in the C-terminal nonkinase domain, which like 14-3-3 proteins are
a phosphopeptide binding domain that target the kinase
to substrates phosphorylated by other kinases [100].
Although the E. cuniculi kinase lacks these characteristic Cterminal Polo boxes in a Pfam domain search, manual
inspection of the C-terminal region provides evidence for
two degenerate Polo box sequences, confirming the identity of this kinase as a Polo homologue.

Unrooted

The third readily-assignable E. cuniculi kinase in the
'Other' group is an orthologue of budding yeast Swe1p
and fission yeast Wee1 and Mik1 (Table 3). These kinases
are negative regulators of the Cdc28p/Cdc2 CDK kinases
that regulate the time of entry into mitosis [101-104]. This
is an essential and critical role in fission yeast, where loss
of both paralogous kinases causes catastrophic premature
mitotic entry, whereas in budding yeast the effects of
Swe1p are more subtle and cells can manage without it, at
least under normal circumstances.
Protein kinases in the 'Other' group that are shared by the
two model yeasts but that are not conserved in the microsporidian include Gcn2p (involved in amino acid sensing:
[105]), Ire1p (required for the unfolded protein response:
[106]), the Ark1p-related kinases required for regulating
cortical actin function and endocytosis [107] and Vps15p
(required for targeting proteins to the vacuole: [108]), and
their fission yeast orthologues.

Atypical protein kinases
Only aPKs of the PIKK (phosphatidyl inositol 3' kinaserelated kinases) and RIO ('right open reading frame') families were identified in the E. cuniculi genome, and putative homology could be assigned in all three cases.
CAD25142.1 and CAD25955.1 are related to budding
yeast Tel1p and are likely to be involved in telomere
maintenance and the DNA damage checkpoint response
as discussed above. The TOR group of PIKK members are
involved in nutrient sensing pathways and are not represented in the microsporidian [109]. A homologue of
Tra1p, apparently conserved between the two yeast species, was also not evident despite its essential role as a core
component of the SAGA and NuA4 histone acetyl transferase complexes in budding yeast that are important for
transcriptional activation, particularly involving acidic
activators [110,111]. It is not clear how E. cuniculi can dispense with such a function, although many (but not all)
of the components of the yeast SAGA and NuA4 com-

Page 15 of 21

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:309

plexes are not essential for viability (see [25]). The Rio
kinases are required for 20S prerRNA processing
[112,113], a role which is apparently conserved in E.
cuniculi. Finally, E. cuniculi lacks a pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase, an enzyme that downregulates PDH
activity by phosphorylation of the E1 subunit [114]. The
status of PDH in E. cuniculi is currently somewhat equivocal, since the microsporidian has two E1 subunit homologues but no evident E2 or E3 component [115], and the
E2 component is critical for regulating PDH kinase activity [116]. Thus without a complete PDH complex there is
probably no need for a PDH kinase. With the exception of
one of its two PDH kinases, budding yeast aPKs all show
clear orthologous relationships to their fission yeast counterparts.
Protein kinase accessory domains
Only 2 ePKs belonging to the AGC family were found to
contain readily identifiable domains in addition to the
kinase catalytic domain. These are the protein kinase Cterminal domain (PF00433) and the protein kinase C phorbol ester/diacylglycerolbinding domain (PF00130). The
microsporidian PKA (CAD25584.1) presents the domain
architecture NH3 +-kinase-PF00433-CO2 -. The protein
kinase C-terminal domain is found in a variety of proteins
with different functions and dependencies, and so per se it
is not useful for assigning putative function. The AGC
kinase CAD25005.1 presents the domain organisation
NH3 +kinasePF00433PF00130-CO2 -.
Protein kinase-regulating proteins
Only two cyclins were found in the E. cuniculi genome
(CAD26331.1 [Q8SRF2] and CAD27077.1 [Q8STR3]).
One instance of the regulatory subunit of Casein Kinase II
was also found (CAD25839.1 [Q8SR24]), plus two regulatory subunits of PKA (CAD24891.1 and CAD25013.1).

Conclusion
The 2.9 Mb genome of the microsporidian E. cuniculi is
the smallest known for any eukaryote. A massive gene loss
in the fungal clade, with additional elimination in E.
cuniculi, has been inferred from the reconstruction of parsimonious evolutionary scenarios using either a subset of
KOGs or "eukaryotic orthologous groups" [117] or the
complete collection [118]. The common ancestor of E.
cuniculi and two yeast species is predicted to contain 3,048
KOGs, and the branch leading to the microsporidian
would be characterised by 586 gene gains and up to 1,969
gene losses. The E. cuniculi proteome appears as a package
of compact proteins containing a significant proportion
of orthologues with simplified domain organisation or
with a high frequency of intragenic deletions [118]. From
the analysis of the protein size distributions derived from
sequenced genomes, it can be suggested that the lengthening of proteins in eukaryotes (non-parasitic species)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/309

allows for more complex regulation networks. Thus, protein shortening in E. cuniculi may reflect reduced proteinprotein interactions as a result of various gene losses
linked to the intracellular parasitic nature [2]. The kinome
of E. cuniculi, consisting of only 32 protein kinases (29
ePKs and 3 aPKs), is a good illustration of this hypothesis.
The microsporidian kinome is approximately one fourth
the size of the kinomes of S. cerevisiae (115 ePKs and 9
aPKs) and S. pombe (109 ePKs and 8 aPKs). The E. cuniculi
kinome has underscored the importance of a number of
protein kinases that are involved in essential cellular processes and likely to be essential to all eukaryotes. Therefore,
the microsporidian presents an opportunity for evaluating
the basic aspects of the most fundamental cellular mechanisms as mediated by protein kinases. The E. cuniculi
kinome includes what might be considered as a core set of
protein kinases required for performing the cell division
cycle: a Cdc28p/Cdc2 cyclin-dependent kinases to regulate progression through different cell cycle stages, its negative regulator (Swe1p/Wee1 orthologue), a DDK to
trigger initiation of DNA replication, a polo kinase an
Aurora kinase to orchestrate various aspects of cell division, a TTK for spindle pole duplication and homologues
of Te1lp and Chk1p for regulation in response to DNA
damage and/or stalled replication forks. A second CDK
might also function as a CDK-activating kinase, and the
Bud32p orthologue may be needed for telomere maintenance. Kinases involved specifically and fundamentally in
cell cycle regulation may therefore represent ~30% of the
E. cuniculi kinome, and orthologues of all the critical activities appear to be present with the exception of those that
form part of the fungal MEN/SIN pathways.
In contrast, E. cuniculi appears to lack almost all of the
protein kinases involved in stress responses, ion homeostasis and nutrient signalling. Although it has orthologues
of PKA and DYRK, there is a complete lack of MAP kinase
pathways and many other kinases involved in these signalling routes. Most notable by their absence are TOR and
AMPK, and E. cuniculi may be the first eukaryote in which
neither of these conserved functions is found. These striking differences with other eukaryotes presumably relate to
its specialised, intracellular, lifestyle as an obligate parasite. Within its parasitophorous vacuole, it can rely on the
host cell to provide nutrients, ATP and an osmotically stabilized environment that must be relatively unchanging
compared to that of the free-living yeasts. Since E. cuniculi
is not thought to undergo meiosis, the absence of orthologues to the yeast meiotic kinases is also hardly surprising.
9/32 (28.1%) of the microsporidian kinases are considered as 'semi-orphan' in our analysis, not showing clear
orthologous relationships to any of the yeast kinases. This

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:309

emphasizes the rapid evolution of some genes in E.
cuniculi and these kinases may be involved in functions
related to the parasitic lifestyle of the organism, for example the decision to initiate spore development (which is
likely not to be nutrient-regulated as in yeasts), or regulation of the polar tube that is used for cell invasion [115].
In contrast, perhaps the most striking aspect of the comparison between the kinomes of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe
is the extent to which orthologous relationships are clear:
only ~15% of kinases in each yeast could not be assigned
such relationships despite at least 800 million years of
divergent evolution [119]. We hope that the comparison
between the kinomes of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe will
stimulate research into many of the as yet uncharacterised
fission yeast kinases.

with default parameters. Transmembrane helices were
predicted with TMHMM 2.0 [127,128]. Protein kinaseregulating subunits were identified with the Pfam HMMs
(Pfam_fs versions) PF01214 (regulatory subunit of Casein
Kinase II), PF00134 and PF02984 (cyclins), PF02197
(PKA regulatory subunit) and PF03941 (Sli15p).

Methods
Identification and classification of E. cuniculi protein
kinases
The set of predicted peptides of E. cuniculi was downloaded via the Sequence Retrieval System [120]. The set of
5003 predicted peptides of S. pombe was downloaded
from the S. pombe Genome Project [121]. The retrieval of
protein kinases and their automatic classification into
protein kinase families was done by scanning the predicted peptides with a multi-level hidden Markov model
library of the protein kinase superfamily run under
HMMER v.2.1.1 [122,123]). This HMM library has been
developed to identify and sub-classify protein kinase catalytic domains into one of the accepted conventional
(ePK) and atypical (aPK) protein kinase families. The
library has been shown to have a misclassification rate of
zero on the family level and for the annotated kinomes of
H. sapiens, M. musculus, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, P. falciparum, and D. discoideum [12].
Phylogenetic analysis
Following the generation of multiple alignments for the
kinase catalytic domains of each kinase family of E.
cuniculi, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe, these were inspected
and curated for large insertions and misaligned regions.
The final curated alignments were of a length of no less
than 220 amino acids, in agreement with the size of the
kinase catalytic domain (~250 amino acids). SplitsTree
[124] was used to generate the phylogenetic trees with the
JTT matrix and the Neighbour-Joining algorithm. The
bootstrap values reported here are based on 1000 replicates. Family-specific dendrograms derived from complete linkage clustering of kinase catalytic domains were
eventually built to assist in the phylogenetic analysis.
