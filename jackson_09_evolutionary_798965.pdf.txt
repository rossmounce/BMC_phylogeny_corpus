Abstract
Background: Rhs genes are prominent features of bacterial genomes that have previously been
implicated in genomic rearrangements in E. coli. By comparing rhs repertoires across the
Enterobacteriaceae, this study provides a robust explanation of rhs diversification and evolution,
and a mechanistic model of how rhs diversity is gained and lost.
Results: Rhs genes are ubiquitous and comprise six structurally distinct lineages within the
Enterobacteriaceae. There is considerable intergenomic variation in rhs repertoire; for instance, in
Salmonella enterica, rhs are restricted to mobile elements, while in Escherichia coli one rhs lineage has
diversified through transposition as older lineages have been deleted. Overall, comparative
genomics reveals frequent, independent gene gains and losses, as well as occasional lateral gene
transfer, in different genera. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Rhs 'core' domains and variable Ctermini are evolutionarily decoupled, and propose that rhs diversity is driven by homologous
recombination with circular intermediates. Existing C-termini are displaced by laterally acquired
alternatives, creating long arrays of dissociated 'tips' that characterize the appearance of rhs loci.
Conclusion: Rhs repertoires are highly dynamic among Enterobacterial genomes, due to repeated
gene gains and losses. In contrast, the primary structures of Rhs genes are evolutionarily conserved,
indicating that rhs sequence diversity is driven, not by rapid mutation, but by the relatively slow
evolution of novel core/tip combinations. Hence, we predict that a large pool of dissociated rhs Cterminal tips exists episomally and these are potentially transmitted across taxonomic boundaries.

Background
Enterobacterial genomes are far from stable entities
undergoing a constant process of gene acquisition and
loss [1]. Genome flux can have a profound effect on the
particular organism and in many instances is associated
with adaptation to different niches and may eventually

come to define different isolates, pathotypes or even species [2]. Genome flux can occur by Lateral Gene Transfer
(LGT) though processes such as natural transformation,
bacteriophage mediated transduction and conjugation [36]. In addition, the expansion of different gene families
through gene duplication can introduce functional varia-

tion into a population, especially where DNA transfer is
restricted. This can act to increase gene dosage or may
increase repertoire of genes encoding variable but functionally related proteins within a genome such as the Pmp
proteins from Chlamydophila abortus [7] and the Lpl tandem gene arrays in Staphylococcus aureus [8]. Hence, gene
gain, gene loss through deletions, genomic rearrangements and the accumulation of point mutations all have
important roles in genome flux and have been linked to
host adaptation [9-13]
When comparing the architecture of enterobacterial
genomes it is clear that they consist of a conserved core
inter-dispersed with variable functions that comprise the
accessory genome [14]. Studies of E. coli have shown that
the genomes carry between 4, 238 - 5,589 CDSs (K12 and
CFT073; [15]) of which as few as 2,344 CDSs are present
in all isolates. Moreover, it is estimated that the E. coli pan
genome is open and likely to encompass more than
13,000 CDSs [16]. For bacteria living in complex environments it may be assumed that there would be a pressure
to continually expand the metabolic and functional flexibility and therefore the genome size. However, there are
several factors that are thought to limit genome expansion
including the underlying mutation rate, population size
and recombination frequency. LGT is also an important
factor in preventing the loss of functions that are only
weakly beneficial and are normally transferred by vertical
inheritance. Consequently LGT within and between species may restore gene function that was previously lost in
the recipient, but retained in the donor. Looking at the
functions that are represented in the accessory genome of
most free-living bacteria the largest single class of genes
encode phage or phage-related proteins. In addition there
are genes which have been associated with lifestyle or disease outcome, including the LEE pathogenicity island [17]
or the high pathogenicity island [18], which are widely
distributed amongst the enteric bacteria and whose functions have been intensively studied. However there are
other genes that are commonly found within accessory
regions in enterobacteria but which are poorly understood; these include the subject of this study, rearrangement hot-spot, or rhs elements.
Rhs elements were first described in Escherichia coli K-12 in
1984 using a genetic screen to detect specific amplification of the glyS gene. The genetic screen was performed
under conditions which selected for the duplication of the
glyS gene following a recA-dependent unequal cross-over
event between rhs elements rhsA and rhsB. This explains
the rhs nomenclature which is derived from these initial
descriptions showing that rhs elements frequently acted as
re-arrangement hot spots in E. coli under certain selective
conditions [19]. Subsequent work by Charles W. Hill and
colleagues identified 5 rhs elements in E. coli K-12 (rhsA-

E) as well as additional elements in other members of the
ECOR collection [20,21]. Studies looking at the E. coli rhs
elements showed that they fell into three subfamilies
rhsABCF, rhsDE and rhsGH [21]. These comparisons also
revealed that rhs loci as defined by Hill and co-workers
include a gene composed of an N-terminal G+C rich conserved core region, encoding ~1200 amino acids, and a Cterminal A+T rich region that is highly divergent and was
denoted the core-extension (130-177 amino acids). The
core protein carries multiple tandemly repeated copies of
a YD-repeat domain associated with carbohydrate binding [22,23]. Other genes have also been associated with
rhs loci including vgr and hcp genes now known to be associated with Type VI secretion systems [24,25]. However
the function of these proteins is unknown and the conditions under which they are expressed have also been difficult to define.
Our knowledge of the distribution of rhs elements was initially restricted to E. coli although related elements have
now been reported in a wide range of organisms including
other enterics such as Salmonella and Yersinia as well as
pseudomonads and Actinobacillus [26]. A recent paper
identified substantial rhs genetic polymorphism among
strains of a single pathogen (E. coli 0157:H7) and discussed the use of rhs genes for molecular systematic [27].
This suggests that rhs gene repertoires may be highly
dynamic, but the true scale of rhs diversity, their ubiquity
in enteric genomes and their structural and evolutionary
dynamics remain unexplored. Here we present a detailed
analysis of rhs elements in the Enterobacteriaceae, which
has three objectives: i) to reveal the scale of rhs diversity
across enteric bacteria and provide an evolutionary systematic classification; ii) to compare and contrast the rhs
repertoires between strains, species and genera to characterise the evolutionary dynamics of rhs diversification;
and iii) provide a mechanistic model of how rhs diversity
is gained and lost by bacterial genomes. In achieving these
objectives, we discount any role for rhs elements in chromosomal rearrangement, we show that hcp and vgr are not
present in all rhs and by studying rhs phylogeny and evolution, we propose a novel mechanism for diversification
of these genes through C-terminal displacement.

Results
Rhs loci are not constituents of specialized 'accessory
elements'
From analysis of hundreds of completed bacterial genome
sequences, there are many examples of large chromosomal rearrangement mediated via bacteriophage, IS elements and rRNA operons [14,28,29]. However, there is
not one single published report of chromosomal rearrangement mediated via rhs elements and hence it is clear
that these loci are not 'rearrangement hot spots' as originally defined by Hill and co-workers [26]. This lack of

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:584

support for a function of these genetic elements in chromosomal rearrangements illustrates the artefactual nature
of the original phenotype in which these loci were discovered and provokes a need to assess what the function of
these 'elements' are in bacterial cells; moving away from
considering rhs elements as cis-acting 'DNA elements' or
'accessory elements' as they are widely annotated, to actually consider them as simple genes that encode a large
protein, defined by Hill and co-workers as the Rhs 'core'
protein [21]. Hence, when we refer to rhs we will use the
term rhs gene and not rhs element to reinforce that fact
that we consider these essentially to be a normal protein
encoding genes.
The canonical primary structure of Rhs proteins
From our comprehensive sample of enterobacterial rhs
genes, we have redefined the primary protein structure
originally described by Hill [21,26], given that the family
comprises greater structural variety than previously appreciated. Figure 1 shows that each Rhs protein consists of
four distinct domains: i) a 'clade-specific' N-terminal
domain (365-695 amino acids) that is conserved within,
but not between, subfamilies of rhs; ii) a 'core domain'
(776-888 amino acids) that is flanked by conserved
motifs. The core varies greatly across all Rhs proteins, but
can be aligned due to the conserved secondary structure
and, in particular, the series of G residues (often followed
by R) found at intervals of 9-11 amino acids, recognised
previously by Hill [21]; iii) a very conserved 61 amino
acid motif, ending in DPXG-(18)-DPXG and shared by all
Rhs proteins, which defines the 3' boundary of the core
domain; and iv) an apparently variable C-terminal 'tip' of
between 21 and 168 amino acids, which is non-homologous between subfamilies, indeed, often entirely different
within subfamilies, individual species and loci. Our sam-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/584

ple also confirms that rhs genes are often found immediately downstream of a vgrS locus, although this is not true
in E. coli (see below). Like Hill, we observe that rhs genes
are generally followed by a GC-poor downstream region
containing additional, fragmentary rhs core and tip
sequences. The dynamics of these 'dissociated' tips are
analyzed below, after first addressing the global diversity
and evolutionary history of rhs core sequences.
Phylogenetic systematics
Our data sample comprised 67 completed and largely
published enterobacterial genome sequences, representing 13 different genera and 33 species; in total, 81 rhs gene
sequences were compared, 6 of which were partial. The rhs
gene complements of each species are shown in Table 1
and range from 6 or 7 genes in some E. coli strains to no
rhs genes at all in Sodalis glossinidius and Klebsiella spp.
Overall, the total rhs complement is highly variable, even
within genera, suggesting that rhs genes can be gained and
lost easily. Multiple alignment of translated nucleotide
sequences was possible within the redefined core domain
(i.e., N- and C-terminal domains were not used), producing an 1167 character (3501 bp) data set with numerous
gaps.

Phylogenetic analysis produced a robust and reliable estimate under various conditions. The ML phylogram for
nucleotide sequences is shown in Figure 2; this topology
was also recovered from Bayesian analysis of nucleotide
sequences, as well as analysis of amino acid sequences
(not shown). All trees support six clades (labelled I to VI)
with robust bootstrap values (> 95), reflecting distinct primary structures belonging to each clade. This cladistic pattern corresponds with the highly distinct N-terminal
sequences (which were not used in phylogenetic estima-

Note: An asterisk * signifies that a given genome sequence was used in the global phylogenetic analysis (see Methods).

tion), providing independent validation of the relationships. We confirmed that the phylogeny was not affected
by base composition or codon usage bias; rhs from the
same clade but different genomes had dissimilar base
composition and codon usage scores, while rhs from different clades but the same genomes, for instance rhs from
Yersinia spp., had similar codon usage scores (data not
shown).
Of the six clades, I and VI are limited in taxonomic distribution. Clade I is primarily associated with E. coli/Shigella
spp. in which it has been substantially expanded through
gene duplication. It is also found in C. rodentium, S. bongori, and some strains of S. enterica. Clade VI is restricted
to Yersinia spp. Clades II-IV are widespread; each has representatives in genomes from across the Enterobacteriaceae, indicating that they were present in the common
ancestor. However, the distribution is also punctate, i.e.,
although widespread, Clades II-IV are not universal. Thus,
gene loss, and perhaps recovery, has occurred frequently
as the Enterobacteriaceae have diversified. Having established the global diversity of all rhs genes, we focussed our
analysis on two particularly well sampled taxa (Salmonella
enterica and the E. coli/Shigella complex) to understand
what regulates rhs diversity on a local scale, i.e., among
strains.
Rhs loci in Salmonella enterica
From the global analysis of Table 1 and Figure 2, it is clear
that most S. enterica strains possess a single rhs gene,
belonging to either Clade II or III. More rarely, S. enterica
rhs repertoire includes a Clade I gene (specifically strains
Agona and Gallinarum). In the phylogeny, these genes fall
definitely outside the bulk of E. coli Class I genes, suggesting that they are true orthologs and not the result of LGT.
Occasionally, as with Paratyphi A and Arizonae strains,
gene loss has entirely removed all rhs genes. A closer
examination of S. enterica, described in Table 2, shows
that both taxon and position define rhs repertoire. All rhs
loci are found on the mobile genetic elements SPI6 and
ROD9, the former being the most common. The SPI6
locus always contains a Clade II or III rhs, the exception
being strain Typhimurium, which has both Clade II and
III genes arranged in tandem. The ROD9 locus contains a
Clade I rhs and is found only in Agona and Gallinarum

strains, although these strains display evidence of deleted
rhs genes at the SPI6 locus in addition. In contrast to S.
enterica, S. bongori does not conform to these rules; it possesses two rhs genes that are Clade I- and V-types respectively; and these loci are not found on mobile elements.
Instead, the unrelated Clade I- and V genes are each
closely related to counterparts in C. rodentium and C. youngae, strongly indicating that they have been acquired
through LGT from Citrobacter, or some third party.
Rhs loci in Escherichia coli
The situation in Salmonella contrasts starkly with that in E.
coli and Shigella. Instead of a single rhs gene housed within
a mobile element, there are multiple rhs loci distributed
throughout the genome. We saw in the global analysis
that these loci largely belong to Clade I. In the phylogeny,
E. coli Clade I genes have short branch lengths and are
monophyletic, i.e., they are more related to each other
than anything else. These close relationships show that
diversification has been relatively recent; indeed, strainspecific loci and ubiquitous variation in repertoire among
strains suggest that rhs expansion in E. coli is an on-going
process. However, Clade I rhs exist in S. enterica and C.
rodentium, showing that the clade predates E. coli,
although it probably does not predate the Enterobacteriaceae since it is not represented widely. E. fergusonii,
which is a true congener of E. coli, lacks Clade I rhs but has
Clade III. Given that Salmonella possesses Clades I-III, this
indicates that the ancestral Escherichia had a more diverse
repertoire than E. coli. In summary, the E. coli rhs repertoire represents a contraction of ancestral state, coupled
with a substantial and species-specific evolutionary
expansion of Clade I rhs.

In total, there are 11 unique rhs loci among the 20 strains
included here, which are defined in Table 3 by their conserved flanking genes and superimposed on the K12
genome in Figure 3a. Obviously, not all strains possess
genes at all positions, although some (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 6 and
10) are better attended than others. Most positions contain Clade I rhs, but position 4 contains a Clade IV rhs, (as
noted in the global analysis) and position 2 contains a
Clade II gene that is specific to Sh. flexneri. The two rhs
genes of Sh. flexneri are an anomaly: the first is Clade IItype and found uniquely at position 2, the second is Clade

III-type and found at position 5 (which hosts Clade I rhs
in all other strains). Hence, Sh. flexneri seems to have a S.
enterica-like repertoire in an E. coli-like setting; the phylogeny corroborates this, since both genes cluster tightly with
their S. enterica homologs. This indicates that Sh. flexneri

has replaced its ancestral (E. coli-like) rhs through LGT
from S. enterica.
In Figure 3a, rhs repertoires are mapped onto a phylogeny
of E. coli/Shigella strains, with E. albertii as an outgroup.

An asterisk * signifies that the SPI6 locus is represented by a pseudogene or gene relic.

Several features emerge from this analysis: i) one group of
pathogenic strains (below the heavy line) lack the evolutionary expansion of Clade I rhs and, furthermore, have
only vestiges of positions 1 and 6 (showing that these
have been deactivated); ii) gene loss has also affected
other strains creating widespread genomic variation, even
between related strains, for instance among K12, HS and
ATCC8739; iii) position 8 occurs in an evolutionary labile
region and is only conserved in Sh. boydii CDC and
ATCC8739, which is anomalous since these strains are not
closely related. It suggests that one or other strain has
acquired the locus through LGT; and iv) E. albertii possesses complete genes at positions 1 and 5, as well as a
relic at position 6, indicating that these loci are oldest, predating the origin of E. coli. Hence, we have an evolutionary hypothesis of the Clade I rhs expansion. The ancestral
E. coli had rhs at positions 1, 5 and 6, which have become
non-functional in some strains. Position 3 and positions
10 and 11 evolved after the split with the pathogenic

strains, through duplication of position 6 and 5 respectively; the remaining loci evolved uniquely in the K12/
HS/ATCC8739 lineage (position 9); Sh. flexneri (position
2) and ATCC8739 (positions 7 and 8).
Having looked in detail at the phylogenetic distribution
of Clade I rhs loci among strains, we estimated a phylogenetic network to examine the relationships among rhs
gene sequences, but now including their variable C-termini. The results are presented in Figure 3b and show that
the independent gene presence/absence and nucleotide
sequence data generally agree. Most importantly perhaps,
the network shows that sequences cluster by genomic
position, rather than by taxon or randomly. This indicates
that recombination between cores at different Clade I loci
is infrequent (if any) and, from a pragmatic view, all genes
at a given position can be considered orthologous when
comparing E. coli strains. The relationships between these
clusters corroborate the diversification scenario inferred

from Figure 3a; rhs from positions 1 and 6 are most divergent, consistent with their origin being the earliest of all.
The rhs genes at position 6 appear in two positions within
the network: most sequences cluster with rhs from position 3, but sequences from strains K12, SE11 and Sh. sonnei cluster with rhs at position 1. Interestingly, both types
are found at position 6 in E. coli SE11 and Sh. sonnei.
Finally, although clade I rhs core sequences cluster by
genomic position, the network shows that rhs at different
positions can share a common pool of variable C-terminal 'tips'. Rhs core sequences at positions 5, 9-11 are
almost identical, as seen from the tight clustering at the
right-hand end of Figure 3b, and are distinguished mainly
by the non-homologous tips attached to otherwise invariant core sequences. It can be seen that the same tip can be
attached to rhs genes at different clade I loci, for instance,
between positions 9 and 10, or 10 and 5. When we inspect
the C-terminal tips for all clade I rhs in E. coli (see Additional File 1), it is clear that tips can be shared even
between rhs genes with quite dissimilar core sequences,
for instance between positions 3 and 9-11. Conversely, a
given position can harbour several different tips across all
strains. Altogether, a survey of the associated C-terminal
tips in clade I rhs suggests that tips can be exchanged
between loci, and the total diversity of tips is very large.
We sought to find further evidence for this among the dissociated tips found downstream of core sequences.
Displacement of C-terminal tips
As detailed above the core regions of rhs genes are followed by an apparently exchangeable tip, giving the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/584

impression of hypervariability. This predicts that there
must be a large pool of alternative tips available for
exchange. Using the clade II rhs locus (SMA1610) in Serratia marcescens strain Db11 as a model, Figure 4 shows
how the region encoding the core displays a significantly
higher G+C content than that encoding the C-terminal tip
(67.7% compared with 46.4%; Wang et al. 1998). In
many instances this low G+C trough extends beyond the
rhs gene and, in the case of Se. marcescens, > 7 kb downstream. In Se. marcescens this region includes three rhs
gene fragments (SMA1612, SMA1614 and SMA1616) all
consisting of a partial core of varying lengths, a full core
repeat and recognisable C-terminal tip. Thus far these
fragments have been annotated and published as relics of
rhs genes that have been lost by deletion over time
[14,30]. When the core regions of the Se. marcescens rhs
gene fragments were compared to the core regions of all
the rhs genes within its genome they were found to be
almost identical to the core region of the rhs gene located
immediately upstream (91.6% amino acid identity),
appearing as a series of large direct repeats of varying
length. In contrast, the rhs fragments each carry an entirely
dissimilar C-terminal tip. This combination of invariant
core sequences and non-homologous tips within a given
locus is consistent with the analysis of clade I rhs tips in E.
coli above. Only one of the Se. marcescens rhs fragments
(SMA1612) possesses an appropriate translational start
site suggesting that they are likely to be functionally silent.
Consistent with this, two of the Se. marcescens rhs gene
fragments (including SMA1612) have further degenerated
carrying frameshift mutations and/or premature stop
codons (Figure 4).

E. coli clade I loci are unusual in that dissociated tips are
generally absent downstream. However, the sole clade IV
locus (position 4) in E. coli does conform to the pattern
described in Figure 4. Therefore, we compared both associated and dissociated tips across seven E. coli strains possessing a clade IV rhs, which are illustrated in Figure 5.
Since we have multiple isolates of the same species sharing the same locus we can add a temporal dimension to
the static observations made in Se. marcescens. In this
instance it is evident that once-attached C-terminal tips
have been displaced by the insertion of new tips onto the
rhs gene because we see a shared, (and presumably ancestral), tip (shaded green) displaced by two different tips
independently. As with Se. marcescens, when comparing
associated and dissociated sequences for each E. coli
strain, although the C-terminal tips were distinct within a
locus, the core regions were always identical. Hence, the
apparent variability of C-termini in rhs seems to be generated by the insertion of exogenous sequences, resulting in
the displacement of the incumbent tip, which then
becomes 'dissociated'. Since the process is slow enough
for us to observe orthologous tip types across different E.
coli strains, variability is clearly not generated by rapid
sequence divergence; the alternative is that a very large
pool of tips has evolved over a long period, in fact, that
the tips are well conserved. In support of this, we found
that the 'blue' tip in Figure 5 (ECSE_0631) was highly
related (74% amino acid identity) to a dissociated tip in
Er. carotovora (ECA4293). This tip is also located downstream of a clade IV rhs gene (ECA4278).

To confirm the general pattern that C-terminal tips are not
recently evolved and hypervariable, we compared each
associated C-terminal tip from every rhs gene in our dataset with the UNIPROT database. This showed that many
clade II-V tips have very good matches (70-95% amino
acid identity, data not shown) to intact and fragmentary
rhs in other Enterobacteriaceae, and indeed, in other
eubacterial families besides. Where the affinity of the tip
could be determined, the core sequences of the query and
matched tips belonged to the same clade. C-terminal
sequences from clade I and VI rhs did not have widespread
matches, consistent with the restricted taxonomic distribution of their core sequences (see Figure 2). In summary,
our data show that a large pool of structurally conserved
C-terminal domains are exchanged between rhs genes,
through a process of insertion and displacement, but that
exchange is limited to members of the same clade.

Discussion
Our understanding of the rhs gene family has been hampered by a very incomplete knowledge of global sequence
diversity, due in part to the characterisation of rhs in E. coli
K12, which, as should now be clear, has a relatively meagre and unrepresentative rhs repertoire. In fact, rhs genes
are much more diverse than previously appreciated and
comprise six structurally and phylogenetically distinct lineages within the Enterobacteriaceae. The taxonomic distribution of these distinct rhs types is punctate, reflecting
frequent and independent gene gains and losses in different genera, as well as occasional LGT. When we look

closer within particular species, inter-strain variation
exposes some of the mechanisms responsible. In S. enterica, rhs are restricted to mobile elements and are limited to
a single functional copy through differential deletion. In
E. coli, there has been a major expansion in Clade I rhs
through transposition to novel loci, and loss of other
clades relative to other Escherichia spp. Comparison of Cterminal tips and dissociated fragments shows that while
C-termini vary greatly within a locus, each distinct
sequence is conserved in related strains, indeed in other
species and genera. Hence, we must conclude that they are
structurally conserved rather than hypervariable, that is,
C-terminal variability is facilitated by dynamic substitution from a theoretically large pool of structurally diverse,
(but evolutionarily old), C-terminal sequences rather
than rapid divergence of static sequences under selection.
These auxiliary C-termini are not all resident on the same
chromosome and so must exist episomally and, since
related strains can often have the same arrangement of
dissociated rhs fragments, displacement of one C-terminus by another proceeds relatively slowly.
The structural features of rhs loci, the combination of conserved and variable domains coinciding with distinct GC
signatures and the tandem repetition of gene fragments
downstream of an intact gene copy, have analogues in
other organisms. In Neisseria meningitidis, the mafB genes
occupy three distinct loci and each is arranged in this way;
a full-length gene copy is followed by C-terminal fragments of variable length and low GC-content, but flanked
by conserved domains [31,32]. Comparative genomics
indicates that a given C-terminal tip can be associated
with a complete maf gene in some strains, and found
unattached downstream in others, mirroring the evidence
presented here for rhs [32]. There is no evidence that rhs
and mafB are homologous, and so their structurally analogy may reflect a convergence enforced by common
mechanistic constraints.
The structure of rhs genes and their downstream silent tips
has superficial similarities with gene variation mechanisms in several unrelated bacterial pathogens including
the pilus antigenic variation system seen in Neisseria gonorrhoeae [33-35], the haemagglutinin in Mycoplasma synoviae [36], and antigenic variation in Borrelia [37-39]. In
these systems variation is introduced into the expressed
gene by recombination between itself and one of a
number of silent copies of that gene located either downstream or elsewhere in the genome. All gene copies are
composed of constant and variable regions where the latter show little conservation but are flanked by conserved
sequences that facilitate recombination. As stated above,
Rhs genes are not hypervariable and are not truly analogous to systems of antigenic variation, but recombination
may be similarly employed to introduce structural varia-

bility. Our observation of C-terminal displacement is also
superficially reminiscent of the 'terminal reassortment'
process that might create novel type III secretion systems
through the generation of sequence mosaics [40]. However, this is presented as a largely unregulated process of
highly promiscuous recombination between unrelated
genes, while our observations suggest a process tightly regulated by structural homology and, consequently, with
much less scope for introducing novelty.
In proposing a mechanism for how within-genome rhs
sequence variability is generated, we need to explain the
principal observation that rhs fragments consisting of core
domain sequence and variable C-termini are found dissociated downstream of intact genes, often in long strings.
Our essential contention is that this reflects previous displacement events by 'incoming' tips, but we also need to
explain why the core fragments are of variable length and
why tips at a given locus only ever contain core sequences
of the same clade, (i.e., why are there inherent phylogenetic limits on what can insert). We propose a model that
requires two independent recombination events, which is
described in Figure 6. First, there is homologous recombination between the conserved core sequence within a dissociated tip and either the core region of the rhs gene or
that of another unattached tip. This would result in the
production of a small episomal circle carrying a conserved
core region that is attached to a variable C-terminal tip
and any intervening genes. The length of the core fragment would depend on where the recombination breakpoint occurred. Second, after transfer to another bacterial
isolate, homologous recombination would be required
between the chromosomal rhs core and identical
sequences located on the episomal circle carrying the
unattached tip. The phylogenetic limits of displacement
would indicate that very high identity is required between
core domain sequences to permit recombination. This
second cross-over event involving a circular intermediate
is required to explain how an attached tip can be displaced by a new tip without deleting or entirely replacing
the old tip, but simply shunting it to a silent position
downstream of the intact rhs gene.
All circumstantial evidence supports existing tips being
repeatedly replaced by non-homologous alternatives, yet
there is little evidence that these new tips originate from
other locations in the same genome. This means that new
sequences must be acquired from other bacteria with
related rhs elements; or alternative tips could be carried
into the genome as cargo on other mobile genetic elements. The former would require that the episomal circle

could be transferred between bacteria. This could occur by
generalised transduction or natural transformation. Precedents for such a stable circular intermediate come from

A hypothetical model of C-terminal tip displacement
A hypothetical model of C-terminal tip displacement. Homologous recombination between the conserved core
sequence within the downstream unattached tip and either the core region of the rhs gene or that of another unattached tip.
This event would result in the production of a recombination proficient episomal circle carrying a conserved core region, of
varying lengths, which is attached to a variable C-terminal tip and any intervening genes. After transfer to a second bacterial
isolate homologous recombination would be required between the highly conserved core regions on the chromosomal rhs
gene and identical sequences located on the episomal circle carrying the unattached tip. This second single cross-over event of
a circular intermediate is required to explain how an attached tip can be displaced by a new tip without deleting or entirely
replacing the old tip, but simply shunting it to a silent position downstream of the intact rhs gene.

both integron-mediated gene exchange [41], which
requires an integrase that is not known to co-occur with
Rhs, and from the pilus antigenic variation system in Neisseria, in which recombination between pilE and the silent
pilS genes does not involve a site-specific integrase but
instead utilises the host RecA machinery [42]. Episomal
circles carrying pilin tips are sufficiently stable to be used
to naturally transform Neisseria [35]. With regard to the
introduction of new tip by LGT, we have provided evidence that rhs genes and alternative tips are frequently carried on genomic islands, such as SPI-6 and ROD9 in
Salmonella. However, these alternative tips would still
need to form stable closed circles to be able to insert at
related rhs loci.

This study has shown that the rhs gene family is ancient
and a core component of Enterobacterial genomes, and
their structural diversity suggests that they have multiple
roles. While C-terminal displacement engenders structural flexibility, which is itself ancient, rhs do not show
any hypervariability that might indicate they were interacting with host immune systems; indeed, we have shown
that pathogenic E. coli generally lack rhs present in commensal strains. While the biological function of Rhs proteins is still rather unclear, the presence of the repeated
motif that is found in other surface proteins like the wallassociated protein WapA from Bacillus subtilis [43] and the
teneurin family of proteins [23,44,45] suggest a cell surface-associated binding function.

A small number of recent studies have provided potential
clues to the functions of Rhs proteins in E. coli, although
none offer conclusive evidence for function. The most
recent and detailed study of RhsA was during an analysis
of the mechanism of secretion of group 2 capsular antigens in E. coli [46]. RhsA was identified as a likely component of a large hetero-oligomeric capsule biosynthesis/
export complex, based on crosslinking to the KpsD protein in vivo. In an rhsA mutant, levels of the group 2 capsule were reduced in E. coli and the KpsD and KpsE
proteins were no longer localised at the poles of the cells,
suggesting a direction function of RhsA in the assembly
and/or functioning of the capsular export pathway.
Another study presented evidence that an rhsA mutant of
E. coli O26:H- has a significant colonisation defect in
calves compared to the wild-type strains suggesting an
important role for RhsA in vivo [47]. Finally, a study examining the response of E. coli to the biocide polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) reported the increased
expression of a number of rhs genes in E. coli after exposure to PHMB [48]. Despite this rather disparate data, it is
clear that the functions of Rhs protein are at the cell surface or cell envelope and their molecular function may
well include a role in carbohydrate binding of some form.
However, the role of the alternative tip structures and the
functional consequences of tip replacement are yet to be
elucidated.

Conclusion
In this study we have shown that, rather than being 'accessory elements' of some kind facilitating rearrangements of
bacterial chromosomes, rhs genes are an ancient family
comprising six distinct lineages in enteric bacteria, most of
which predate the origin of the Enterobactericeae itself.
Although this venerable heritage suggests that rhs genes
are a fundamental core component of enterobacterial
genomes, we find that they can be gained and lost frequently and over short periods of evolutionary time,
resulting in a high turnover. Individual species may very
often lack rhs entirely, but few genera possess neither rhs
genes nor evidence of recent loss. The dynamic nature of
rhs copy number is matched by local variation in the structure of loci. We propose that the long strings of rhs genes
and gene fragments that have been observed are created
by sequential insertion events, whereby existing C-terminal tips are displaced with non-homologous alternatives.
Since all attached and dissociated core fragments belong
to the same rhs clade, as defined systematically, we can
state that displacement is fundamentally limited by the
phylogenetic distance of subject and donor sequences.
This and other circumstantial evidence causes us to propose a two-stage mechanism in which homologous
recombination excises and inserts C-terminal tips
attached to core fragments, via a proposed circular inter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/584

mediate. Should this be so, it will be interesting to consider how such a circular intermediate might be generated
in the first instance. Our observation that both attached
and dissociated tip sequences are evolutionarily conserved demonstrates that the system of C-terminal displacement is not recent, and that novel rhs structures are
created through recombination of conserved sequences,
rather than rapid mutation or hypervaribility. Accordingly, we hypothesize that a large reservoir of dissociated
rhs tips exists episomally, (since it is evidently not present
on the chromosome), and shared by multiple strains, perhaps even species, at a population level.

Methods
Data collection
We assembled a comprehensive sample of rhs genes from
published or draft released Enterobacterial genome
sequences, listed in Table 1. This sample was sufficient to
answer global questions about rhs diversity, (i.e., concerned with very long periods of time): variation in gene
repertoire between and within genera, and the relative
contribution of differential gene loss and lateral transfer
to the evolution of rhs repertoire. And also to answer specific questions concerned with evolutionary dynamics
over shorter time periods: rhs turnover within bacterial
species and the genomic origins of novel rhs loci. Only
completed genomes were used to better ensure that conclusions regarding gene loss could not be undermined by
missing data. Rhs genes were identified from genome
sequences (irrespective of the quality of annotation) in
two ways. First, all known rhs genes were placed in a
sequence file against which genome sequences were compared using tBLASTn. Any novel sequences were then
added to the file. Second, where possible, a genome was
compared with a related sequence using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT; [49]) to check known rhs (or VgrS)
positions for rhs genes or gene relics. Dissociated C-terminal tips were generally identified in the downstream
regions of rhs loci by the presence of a hyperconserved
region, identical to that found in the upstream rhs copy.
The boundries of the dissociated tip could be defined by
an associated peak in GC content and a region of
sequence homology with the rhs core.
Multiple sequence alignment
All sequence alignment was carried out on translated
nucleotide sequences, which were then back-translated
for downstream analysis; this ensured that codon structure was maintained. Initial automated alignments using
ClustalW [50] showed that N-terminal domains did not
align across all rhs, although they did align within clusters
(subsequently shown to be clades). C-terminal domains
also did not align, even among otherwise well related
sequences. Thus, N- and C-terminal regions were removed
from the alignment. The remaining 'core' sequence was

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:584

manually aligned beginning at the 3' end where a hyperconserved region can be found. Working in a 5' direction
from this point of unambiguous alignment, orientation of
the rhs sequences was dependent on conserved cysteine
residues that occur at regular intervals, as noted previously
[21]. It was assumed that these reflect an underlying secondary structure that is conserved and allows the
sequences to be aligned on a positional basis. Much of the
sequence between conserved residues is very divergent
and not obviously homologous.
Global phylogenetic analysis
We first carried out a phylogenetic analysis of global rhs
diversity across the Enterobacteriaceae. The objective was
to provide a systematic description of total rhs diversity
and so gain an insight into variability in rhs repertoire
between genera. To do this, we removed some congeneric
sequences that, if left in, would result in over-sampling of
particular lineages, e.g., E. coli. Since different E. coli
strains are effectively representing the same lineage in a
broad-scale analysis, removing these 36 sequences did not
affect the outcome. Phylogenetic trees were estimated for
a 81 sequence data set representing 11 genera using both
maximum likelihood (ML) and bayesian inference (BI)
methods. ML trees estimated in PHYML [51,52]; optimal
model selected using Modeltest [53] for nucleotides and
ProtTest [54] for proteins, with rate heterogeneity estimated from the data. All other options were default. 500
non-parametric bootstraps were applied for robustness
measures. BI trees were estimated in MrBayes [55,56]
using the 'gammarates' option. 2 parallel chains were run
for 10,000,000 generations, sampling every 1,000 generations. The first 1,000 generations were discarded as a
'burn-in'. The Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF) in
MrBayes approached 1 in all cases, indicating that these
conditions were adequate to ensure a stationary distribution of all parameters.
Comparative rhs repertoire in E. coli/Shigella spp
After looking at the global diversity of rhs sequences, we
focused on the relationships among rhs genes within wellsampled genera: E. coli, S. enterica and Yersinia. The objective was to observe rhs turnover, and C-terminal tip
dynamics, on a shorter timescale and in the context of disease phenotype, to get a better idea of the relative importance of gene gain and loss (differential assortment) vs.
genetic transfer. To do this we carried out comparative
genomic analyses on 14 S. enterica strains, noting their rhs
repertoires in terms of clade (according to the global analysis) and genomic position. We also recorded the rhs repertoires of E. coli/Shigella species, supplementing the 7
taxa included in the global analysis with a further 13
genome sequences (a total of 60 rhs). Such was the profusion of rhs in E. coli genomes that we decided to formally
define rhs loci by their genomic position, relative to the
K12 genome sequence. While comparing each E. coli or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/584

Shigella sequence to K12, we recorded the presence,
absence or partiality of rhs at every position where an rhs
had been observed in E. coli, and defining new positions
when a gene had not been seen before. Positions were
defined by their flanking loci, such that rhs genes in different E. coli strains can be directly compared and, in future,
novel rhs can be integrated into the nomenclature.
We mapped the clade I rhs repertoires of our E. coli strains
on to their ML phylogeny, which was estimated (as
described above) from a concatenated nucleotide
sequence of all seven standard MLST loci, each extracted
from their genome sequences. This demonstrated the pattern of gene gain and loss that follows from variation in
rhs repertoire. At this point, we discarded the non-clade I
rhs (positions 2 and 4) from our analyses because all
informative variation between strains concerned the
remaining 9 clade I positions, and all pertinent information on the clade II and IV-type rhs in E. coli had been previously revealed by the global analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis of rhs in E. coli/Shigella spp
To better understand the microevolutionary dynamics
regulating clade I rhs evolution at this intraspecific scale,
we built a phylogenetic network for the E. coli and Shigella
sequences using the Neighbour-Net algorithm in Splitstree v4.0 [57]. This approach has the advantage of presenting a consensus of all possible relationships among
sequences, highlighting those 'splits' that are inherently
ambiguous, rather than minimizing ambiguity as a phylogenetic tree would do. As subsequent analysis showed,
for recombinant sequences with mixed evolutionary histories, this representation is more realistic. As described
above, the variable C-terminal tips were removed from
the data set when estimating phylogenetic trees because
they could not be aligned. This was possible because
enough variation was present in the core sequences to
resolve the phylogeny. However, in this data set of clade I
rhs sequences we compared genes from closely related
strains and the C-terminus was often the only feature that
distinguished one gene from another. Therefore, the variable C-terminal tips were used in estimating the phylogenetic network to both resolve very closely related
sequences, and to demonstrate the presence of homologous tips at different loci of the same genome, or nonhomologous tips at corresponding loci in different
genomes.
