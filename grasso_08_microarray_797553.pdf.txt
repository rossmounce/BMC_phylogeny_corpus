Abstract
Background: Anthozoan cnidarians are amongst the simplest animals at the tissue level of
organization, but are surprisingly complex and vertebrate-like in terms of gene repertoire. As
major components of tropical reef ecosystems, the stony corals are anthozoans of particular
ecological significance. To better understand the molecular bases of both cnidarian development in
general and coral-specific processes such as skeletogenesis and symbiont acquisition, microarray
analysis was carried out through the period of early development – when skeletogenesis is initiated,
and symbionts are first acquired.
Results: Of 5081 unique peptide coding genes, 1084 were differentially expressed (P ≤ 0.05) in
comparisons between four different stages of coral development, spanning key developmental
transitions. Genes of likely relevance to the processes of settlement, metamorphosis, calcification
and interaction with symbionts were characterised further and their spatial expression patterns
investigated using whole-mount in situ hybridization.
Conclusion: This study is the first large-scale investigation of developmental gene expression for
any cnidarian, and has provided candidate genes for key roles in many aspects of coral biology,
including calcification, metamorphosis and symbiont uptake. One surprising finding is that some of
these genes have clear counterparts in higher animals but are not present in the closely-related sea
anemone Nematostella. Secondly, coral-specific processes (i.e. traits which distinguish corals from
their close relatives) may be analogous to similar processes in distantly related organisms. This first
large-scale application of microarray analysis demonstrates the potential of this approach for
investigating many aspects of coral biology, including the effects of stress and disease.

Background
Cnidarians are the simplest animals at the tissue level of
organization, and are of particular importance in terms of
understanding the evolution of metazoan genomes and
developmental mechanisms. Members of the basal cnidarian Class Anthozoa, which includes the sea anemone
Nematostella and the coral Acropora, have proved to be surprisingly complex and vertebrate-like in terms of gene repertoire [1-3], and are therefore of particular interest.
Scleractinian corals are also of fundamental ecological significance in tropical and sub-tropical shallow marine
environments as the most important components of coral
reefs. Surprisingly, both the general molecular principles
of cnidarian development and many aspects of the functional biology of corals are only poorly understood.
Whole genome sequences are now available for both the
textbook cnidarian Hydra magnipapillata and the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis. However, corals are distinguished from Nematostella and other cnidarians by the
presence of an extensive skeleton composed of calcium
carbonate in the form of aragonite. The ability to carry out
calcification on a reef-building scale is enabled by the
obligate symbiosis between scleractinians and photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium.
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) projects carried out on
Acropora millepora and Nematostella vectensis have provided
insights into the evolution of animal genomes [2,3]. The
latter publication, based on ca 5800 unigenes from the
coral Acropora and 10,500 unigenes from the sea anemone
Nematostella, revealed the surprisingly rich genetic repertoire of these morphologically simple animals. The
genomes of anthozoan cnidarians encode not only
homologs of numerous genes known from higher animals (including many that had been assumed to be 'vertebrate-specific'), but also a significant number of genes not
known from any other animals ('non-metazoan' genes;
[3]). This picture of genetic complexity has been augmented by the recently completed whole genome
sequence (WGS) of Nematostella vectensis [1], for which
approximately 165,000 ESTs are now available. Similar
resources exist for Hydra magnipapillata [4,5] although the
much larger genome size of this organism has consequences for the completeness of the assembly. Both of
these other cnidarians not only lack a calcified skeleton,
but also do not enter symbioses. Entry into a symbiosis
can have profound effects on gene expression patterns,
with changes to immune function, and to many metabolic functions including CO2 cycling, nutrient cycling,
metabolite transfer and reactive oxygen quenching [6,7].
The phylogenetic position of Nematostella makes this a
particularly useful comparator because both Nematostella
and Acropora are classified into the anthozoan subclass
Hexacorallia (Zoantharia).

Information and resources relevant to microarray studies
on corals have recently been summarised [8]. Few precedents exist for the approach used here; the most directly
relevant previous study is an array experiment comparing
symbiotic and aposymbiotic sea anemones [9]. To gain
insights into the molecular bases of coral development,
including nematocyst formation, metamorphosis, and the
processes of symbiont uptake and calcification, developmental microarray experiments were carried out using
12000 spot cDNA arrays representing 5081 Acropora millepora unigenes which, based on the EST sequence, are predicted to give rise to a bona fide protein. Four stages of
coral development were compared, spanning the major
transitions of gastrulation and metamorphosis (Figure 1).
These comparisons, which constitute the most comprehensive analysis of the development of any cnidarian to
date, provide insights into the overall dynamics of the
transcriptome during development as well as candidate
genes for roles in metamorphosis, calcification and sym-

Scanning electron micrographs of developmental
stages in the Acropora millepora lifecycle. At spawning
egg-sperm bundles are released by the colony and float to
the surface, where they break up into individual eggs and
sperm. Upon release and fertilization of the egg, cell division
first produces a spherical bundle of cells which then flattens
to form a cellular bilayer called the prawnchip (PC). Following gastrulation the spherical gastrula elongates to a pear
shape as cilia develop. Further elongation produces a motile
presettlement planula larvae (PL), possessing a highly differentiated endo- and ectoderm and an oral pore. Upon receipt
of an appropriate cue, the larva settles and metamorphoses,
forming the primary polyp (PO). Following calcification, symbiont uptake, and growth and branching, the adult colony is
formed (A). The stages labelled with yellow letters represent
those from which RNA was extracted, labelled and hybridized to the slides. Stages circled in red are those from which
ESTs were spotted onto the slides.

biont uptake. Spatial expression patterns were determined
for many of the candidate genes identified in the array
experiments. Comparisons with Nematostella, Hydra and
other animals imply that nominally coral specific processes are executed by both conserved and novel (taxonspecific) genes, and suggest some intriguing parallels with
other systems.

unique genes, but these accounted for only 12% of cluster
I (Figure 2C). Conversely, cluster VI contained the highest
proportion (59%) of 'core' genes, which are defined as
genes represented in animals and other kingdoms (Figure
2C). The proportion of Acropora unigenes matching only
to other cnidarians was relatively constant across clusters,
cluster VI (7%; 14 unigenes) being somewhat below the
9–11.5% range of the other clusters (data not shown).

Results
The identification and composition of synexpression
clusters
Of the 5081 unigenes giving rise to predicted peptides that
are represented on the arrays, a total of 1084 unigenes
(2462 spots) were found to be up- or down-regulated (P
= < 0.05) between any two consecutive stages. The microarray results were validated by virtual northern blots. The
results for eight arbitrarily chosen clones are shown in
Additional File 1; in each case the observed expression
pattern corresponds with the microarray results.

Cluster analysis identified six major synexpression clusters (Figure 2A) which map onto the major stages of coral
development (Figure 2B). Three of these clusters (CII, CIII
and CIV) are of most interest from the perspective of
coral-specific biology. Candidates for roles in nematocyst
development, receipt of settlement cues and the implementation of metamorphosis may be represented in cluster II (genes up-regulated in planula) or cluster III (genes
up-regulated in planula and primary polyp). Similarly,
genes involved in the early stages of calcification are predicted to occur in cluster IV (genes up-regulated in primary polyp) and cluster III (genes up-regulated in planula
and primary polyp). These same two clusters (CIII and
CIV) may also provide candidates for roles in the establishment of symbiosis. Two other synexpression clusters
(CI and CVI) are of more general developmental interest.
The largest, cluster I (genes down-regulated after embryogenesis), consists of 567 unigenes whose transcript levels
decreased after gastrulation and remained low (Figure
2A). Cluster V (genes up-regulated in adult) consists of
only 43 unigenes. The small size of this cluster may be due
to the absence of adult material amongst the cDNAs spotted on the array and therefore presumably reflects only a
small proportion of the total number of genes that are upregulated in adult coral.
Functional breakdown data for the genes in these clusters
are summarised in Table 1. Overall, approximately 15%
of the differentially expressed genes are coral specific (no
match to database sequences at < 1 × e-5), but the relative
proportion of these nominally taxon-specific genes varies
widely between the synexpression clusters. Clusters II
(genes up-regulated in planula) and IV (genes up-regulated in primary polyp) contained the highest proportions
(23.5% and 26%; 26 and 20 unigenes respectively) of

Approximately 10% of cluster I (genes down-regulated
after embryogenesis) consists of genes in functional category AIII, genes involved in cell replication [10], probably
reflecting the extent to which cell proliferation dominates
early embryogenesis. 29.1% of cluster VI (genes up-regulated after embryogenesis) were classified into functional
category AV: protein synthesis cofactors, tRNA synthetase,
and ribosomal proteins, whereas all other clusters contained very few genes in this category. 27.2% of cluster III
(genes up-regulated in planula and primary polyp) were
classified into AVI: Intermediary synthesis and catabolism
enzymes; this is significantly more than in any other cluster.
Planula larvae are primarily dependent upon stored lipid,
whereas the energy requirements of adult corals are often
largely met by photosynthetic products exported from
their dinoflagellate symbionts. These physiological
changes are reflected by shifts in the coral transcriptome.
For example, lipases are highly represented amongst the
planula ESTs, but strongly down-regulated thereafter. Also
of note are dramatic differences in representation of genes
in category BII (intracellular signalling) between cluster I
(10.5%) and cluster II (0.9%), and in genes in category
BIII (extracellular matrix and cell adhesion) between cluster I (0.9%) and cluster II (14.4%). These shifts, and the
sharp spike in expression of ECM and cell adhesion genes,
are associated with the transition from an undifferentiated
proliferative stage and the emergence of differentiated cell
types.
Lectins related to sea cucumber CEL-III are strongly
expressed during metamorphosis in Acropora
Whilst our understanding of metamorphoses in marine
invertebrates is very incomplete, in several cases key molecules implicated in the underlying processes have been
identified, and these include lectins [11,12]. Studies of
coral settlement and metamorphosis have indicated that
the inductive morphogenetic cue is exogenous/environmental and, whilst the exact structure of the metamorphosis
inducing
morphogen
remains
elusive,
lipopolysaccharides are prime candidates [13] suggesting
that cell surface recognition by coral larvae may be mediated by lectins. Lectins are therefore of particular interest
as candidates for roles in settlement and metamorphosis
as well as in other developmental processes including the

Figure 1. Clusters I-VI consist of genes with their highest expression in the prawnchip, presettlement, presettlement and postsettlement, post-settlement, adult, and post-gastrulation stages, as diagrammed in (B). Presettlement orientation is oral to the
left, postsettlement orientation is oral pointing out of the plane of the page. (C) Pie charts classifying the genes in each cluster
into unique genes (blue-unique to Acropora), core genes (purple-matching a database entry in non-Metazoa, Radiata and Bilateria) and other (light yellow- any combination of any two of non-Metazoa, Radiata or Bilateria). Note that whilst 1084 unigenes
were differentially expressed, the total number of unigenes in clusters is 1161. This is because 70 unigenes fall into two or
more clusters, possibly due to the existence of splice variants for some unigenes.

uptake of Symbiodinium (see below). Indeed, a mannosebinding lectin has recently been described from A. millepora which binds both bacteria and Symbiodinium and
may therefore have roles in both immunity and symbiosis
[14]
A search for genes encoding lectin domains in clusters II,
III and IV identified six unigenes, two of which, A036-E7
and A049-E7, have significant overall similarity to a
haemolytic lectin from sea cucumber. They lack clear
Nematostella (or Hydra) counterparts, but a homologous
gene is present in the Caribbean coral, Acropora palmata
[15]. The two A. millepora proteins are 82.1% identical to
one another (Figure 3A), and 50.4% and 48% identical to
Cucumaria echinata CEL-III [16] respectively. These were
amongst the most highly represented of the differentially
expressed unigenes (A036-E7 was represented by 13 ESTs
and A049-E7 by 4) and, based on their expression patterns, they are candidates for roles in metamorphosis. In
situ hybridization (Figure 3B, C) revealed that both A036E7 and A049-E7 are expressed in a subpopulation of ectodermal cells in the oral half of the larva (Figure 3B1-2; C12). In the post-settlement primary polyp they are exclusively expressed orally on the side that is exposed to the
environment, the other, non-expressing side being against
the substratum (Figure 3B3-4; C3-4). C. echinata CEL-III
functions as an oligomer, apparently causing osmotic rupture of cell membranes after attachment to membranebound sugars [16,17], and their high sequence similarity
suggests similar roles for the two Acropora proteins in cell
recognition and lysis for tissue remodelling during metamorphosis. Alternatively, expression on the exposed surface of the polyp is also consistent with a role in selfdefence, and could indicate a function in lysis of invading
microorganisms by a similar mechanism, as suggested by
Kouzuma et al [17].
Other lectins in nematocyst differentiation
Three of the four remaining lectin domain containing proteins (A044-C2, A032-H1, and A043-H7) share an unusual structure, as they are each predicted by InterProScan
[18] to contain an N-terminal signal peptide (for transport to the ER and secretion or organelle targeting), a central collagen domain, and a C-terminal galactose binding
lectin domain (Figure 4). Blast searching showed that all
three were most similar to Nematostella proteins, and
structural comparisons indicate that these Nematostella
and Acropora proteins, although resembling the mini-collagens known from Hydra [19], are thus far known only
from anthozoan cnidarians. Canonical mini-collagens
[19,20] are components of the walls of cnidarian nematocysts, and are defined by the presence of approximately
fourteen Gly-X-Y repeats flanked by proline-rich and Cysrepeat regions. The Acropora molecules described here,
together with Nematostella mini-collagen-like proteins, are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/540

distinct in also containing lectin domains; there are no
Hydra proteins which contain both of these domains.
Both A044-C2 and A032-H1 have uninterrupted minicollagen repeats, and for these, whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a common expression pattern, transcripts
first appearing in scattered ectodermal cells which are
more abundant toward the oral end of the planula and
then becoming limited to the oral side of the post-settlement polyp (Figure 4A, B). Nematocysts are first apparent
in the early planula larva (Additional File 2) and sections
of embedded whole mount in situ preparations reveal
expression in presumed cnidoblasts (Additional File 3),
but also in other cells without the characteristic cnidoblast
morphology. Whether these cells are developmental
stages of cnidoblasts, or an entirely different class of cell,
remains to be established. However, in the third of these
related proteins, A043-H7, the minicollagen repeat is
interrupted, and a completely different expression pattern
is observed (see below).
Whereas the five proteins discussed above all contain
galactose-binding lectin domains, the last of these six differentially expressed proteins (A043-D8) contains a C
type lectin domain. Moreover, whilst a signal peptide is
present, A043-D8 does not contain a mini-collagen
domain. As in the case of A044-C2 and A032-H1, expression of A043-D8 appears in scattered ectodermal cells as
the planula is developing (Figure 4C), although the distribution of these cells appears to differ somewhat from
those shown in Figures 4A and 4B. Histological sections
fail to reveal any evidence of expression in obvious cnidoblasts.
A potential mediator of symbiont uptake
Acropora species acquire symbionts directly from the environment and although uptake in the wild has only been
observed a few days after settlement [21], larvae of Acropora [22,23] and a number of other coral species [24,25]
are competent to take up symbionts. However, the exact
time and mode of uptake remain to be established. Lectin/
polysaccharide signalling is used in many systems as a
mechanism for symbiotic recognition [26], and has been
implicated in the establishment of symbiosis in various
marine invertebrates (e.g[27]). In the octocoral Sinularia
lochmodes a lectin is involved in the conversion of Symbiodinium from a motile to the non-motile form required for
symbiosis [28,29]. Also, masking cell surface glycoproteins with lectins decreases the rate of Symbiodinium infection of the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella [30] and
enzymatic digestion of cell surface glycans prevents Symbiodinium recognition and the establishment of symbiosis
in the coral Fungia scutaria [31]. Although Smith [32] has
argued otherwise, these more recent experiments point to
a possible role for lectins in symbiont recognition/uptake
in corals.

distinct from the galactose-binding domains in the other three proteins, hence it is represented in a different colour.

The one differentially regulated coral protein containing a
lectin domain and with an expression pattern consistent
with a role in symbiont uptake is A043-H7, introduced in
the previous section as a mini-collagen-like protein.
Unlike those in the proteins with similar domain architecture (A044-C2 and A032-H1), the mini-collagen domain
of A043-H7 is interrupted, (which may have structural
consequences) and the gene's expression pattern is completely different. The expression pattern of A043-H7
immediately prior to settlement (Figure 4D) is consistent
with a role in symbiont uptake since, in contrast to many
other cnidarians, the endoderm of the Acropora planula is
tightly packed with yolk cells and frequently is hollow
only immediately adjacent to the oral pore. As the endoderm is the most common route of cnidarian infection
(see Discussion), the endodermal region immediately
adjacent to the oral pore (i.e. the zone of A043-H7 expression) is a probable site of symbiont infection in the case
of Acropora larvae. Confocal microscopy was recently used
to demonstrate the binding of an A millepora mannosebinding lectin, which was not among our ESTs, to Symbiodinium, but its localization within the coral remains
unknown [14].
Conserved and novel genes with roles in calcification
The molecular basis of calcification in corals is not well
understood; the process involves the deposition of calcium carbonate in an area defined by an organic matrix
[33] and is initiated immediately after settlement and
prior to metamorphosis [34]. Initially a flattened plate is
laid down, upon which are deposited radiating vertical
walls corresponding to the septa which give the polyp its
six-fold symmetry. Initial calcification can, and in the case
of Acropora millepora does, happen in the absence of Symbiodinium, but the massive calcification of larger colonies
is dependent on the photosynthetic symbiont through
interacting cycles of respiration, photosynthesis and calcification. Although many animal phyla include calcifying
representatives, few components of the calcification
machinery appear to be conserved between different lineages. For example, in the scleractinian Galaxea fascicularis,
one of the most prevalent protein components of the calcifying organic matrix is galaxin [35], which appears to be
unique to corals. One exception to this heterogeneity is
the alpha type carbonic anhydrase family, which has been
implicated in CaCO3 deposition from sponges to vertebrates [36]. Most animals have multiple carbonic anhydrases; distinct subfamilies are recognised [37,38] each of
which is widely distributed phylogenetically, but in addition some calcifying animals have atypical carbonic anhydrases that may represent lineage specific adaptations to
facilitate CaCO3 deposition. For example, nacrein – a soluble organic matrix protein in the nacreous layer of pearl
oysters – contains a carbonic anhydrase domain that is
split by a Gly-X-Asn repeat domain [39] which may have

a regulatory role [40]. In a directly relevant example, Tambutte et al. [38] have recently demonstrated that active carbonic anhydrase is present in the organic matrix of
Tubastrea aurea and plays a direct role in the calcification
process. In another recent paper Moya et al [41] have
cloned, sequenced and immunolocalized a previously
undescribed CA from the coral Stylophora pistillata. It is
localized in the calicoblast ectoderm, from which it is
secreted, and has a CA catalytic function. In terms of
understanding the bases of skeleton deposition, carbonic
anhydrases are therefore of particular interest.
Two carbonic anhydrase genes, C007-E7 and A030-E11
(cluster III) are up-regulated in the planula larva and postsettlement stages, and in situ hybridization shows that the
expression of each gene is spatially restricted at those
stages of development. C007-E7 is expressed most
strongly in a restricted area at the aboral end of the metamorphosing larva and primary polyp (Figure 5A1, A2).
The expression of this gene in a disc at the aboral end is
consistent with a role in calcification as this is the site
where the process is initiated [34,42-44]. In the slightly
older polyp the expression in the aboral disc decreases to
a circumferential ring (Figure 5A3), and still later (Figure
5A4), this ring is maintained, and expression commences
in the tentacles. This expression pattern in the basal plate
is consistent with involvement of carbonic anhydrase
C007-E7 in the onset of calcification, but indicates that
this carbonic anhydrase is not involved in the phase of
calcification during which the adult structures are formed.
The second carbonic anhydrase, A030-E11, was expressed
in the oral half of the metamorphosing larva (Figure 5B1)
and the entire ectoderm of the primary polyp, except the
aboral disc (Figure 5B2) and the oral pore (data not
shown). In older polyps this carbonic anhydrase is
expressed in the septa, where calcification is occurring to
form adult structures (Figure 5B4).
Expression analysis reveals that some "unique" coral
genes have spatial expression patterns strikingly like that
of carbonic anhydrase C007-E7, i.e. consistent with roles
in the initiation of calcification. Figure 5C1 and 5D1 show
genes with expression at the aboral end of the metamorphosing larva and in the basal plate of the metamorphosing larva, respectively. However, differences are apparent
slightly later – C012-D9 expression becomes restricted to
an aboral ring, and then appears to be switched off (Figure
5C3, C4). Whilst B036-D5 expression also appears to be
down-regulated in the basal plate, transcripts can be visualised in the mesenteries (Figure 5D4) at a stage when
C012-D9 transcripts are undetectable. Neither of these
genes encodes known domains or could be functionally
classified (using BlastP, Phi-Blast and InterPro Scan).

C007-E7, C012-D9 and B036-D5 have expression patterns consistent with involvement in early calcification as they are expressed in the aboral end of metamorphosing larvae (A1, C1, D1)
and the basal disc of early postsettlement polyps (A2, C2, D2), whilst A020-E11 (B) has an expression pattern consistent with
a role in later calcification, as it is expressed in the septa (B4) of the oldest polyp, where the formation of calcified adult structures occurs.

However, their expression patterns are consistent with
roles in early calcification.
A synexpression cluster of coral-specific genes
As indicated above, the proportion of unique genes was
highest in synexpression clusters II ('planula') and IV
('primary polyp'). To investigate their possible roles, in
situ expression patterns were determined for many of
these coral-specific genes. Many gave specific expression
patterns, some of which are consistent with roles in processes such as calcification, as previously discussed. In
other cases, although groups of "unknown" genes appear
to be expressed in the same cells, it is more difficult to
interpret the likely biological significance of the patterns.
One example of this phenomenon is provided by three
'planula' cluster unigenes (A044-A9, C008-B2 and C014E10) with no clear hits to genes in other organisms; the
corresponding proteins are each predicted to contain a
signal peptide, and C014-E10 contains a SEA domain (an
extracellular domain involved in carbohydrate binding).
In situ analysis showed that in the planula, the three transcripts are co-localised in a subpopulation of ectodermal
cells that is concentrated orally. The post-settlement
expression patterns of these three genes were also very
similar, transcripts in each case being localised in scattered ectodermal cells of the polyp (Figure 6A–C). The
apparent co-localisation and co-expression of these unrelated but unique unigenes suggests that they may function
in a common process or signaling pathway. The size of the
synexpression group to which these three genes belong is
unknown, but such gene clusters are of great interest, since
they may represent coral-specific pathways or functions.
Unfortunately, such genes also present great analytical difficulties; since their lack of clear homologs limits the inference of function from structure and the molecular tools
required to test function are not yet available in corals,
although progress is being made in that direction with
other cnidarians [45-47].

Discussion and conclusion
Validation of the approach and methodology
Virtual northern blots for eight genes were consistent with
the microarray results, thus confirming them. In addition,
and consistent with the microarray results being accurate,
several mini-collagen-like proteins were upregulated in
the planula. Mini-collagens have thus far only been
described from nematocysts, cnidarian-specific structures
which first appear at the planula stage in A. millepora
(Additional Files 2, 3).
Taxonomic and functional breakdown of the genes
The composition of the EST set used in these microarray
experiments has previously been considered specifically
with respect to the complement of developmental signalling pathway components [2,3], but this paper is the first

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/540

to examine broad scale changes in gene expression during
development for any cnidarian. The use of different criteria and thresholds, and the ever-changing baseline provided by the databases, complicates making direct
comparisons with other developmental studies. For example, although a recent paper on developmental gene
expression in the ascidian, Molgula [48] addressed many
of the same questions, it focussed specifically on highly
expressed genes (i.e. only those accounting for more than
0.2% of the total number of ESTs) so it is not possible to
interpret apparent differences, such as in the percentage of
unique genes. In terms of developmental changes, it is
particularly noteworthy that the percentage of "core"
genes (59%; i.e. those genes shared with members of
other kingdoms as well as other animals) is highest in
cluster VI and that the percentage of unique genes (12%)
is lowest in cluster I. Presumably these figures reflect shifts
from common cellular pathways during very early development to greater cellular and molecular diversification
later. As in many other animals, the early development of
Acropora appears to involve many stored maternal
mRNAs. The composition of the maternal mRNA pool is
complex, consisting principally of low abundance transcripts including those involved with cell division, RNA
metabolism, and regulation of gene transcription (L
McFarlane, unpublished). Among genes of particular
interest, H2A.Z and H1, histones with roles in priming
chromatin for developmental gene expression [49] in a
variety of other systems, are highly represented in the
prawn chip ESTs and strongly down regulated thereafter,
as are cyclins A and B3. In Drosophila and Xenopus, maternal cyclin transcript levels are initially very high and then
decrease dramatically after the onset of gastrulation [5052]. Acropora may therefore follow this pattern of abundant maternal cyclin transcripts that drive very rapid cell
proliferation early in embryogenesis, followed by lower
transcript levels with the onset of slower developmentally
regulated cell cycles. Cell cycle transcripts such as cyclin A
and B were also abundant among the cleaving embryo
ESTs of Molgula tectiformis [48] and in pre-gastrulation
stages of Xenopus [53] and Drosophila [54].
Lectin domain proteins are potentially involved in diverse
processes
There are a number of precedents for the involvement of
lectin-containing proteins in metamorphosis. Lectins are
differentially expressed at metamorphosis in two ascidians, Herdmania curvata [55] and Boltenia villosa [11,12]. In
Boltenia, four lectins and two key lectin pathway genes are
up-regulated in the larva or the newly settled adult [11].
The lectin induced complement pathway, which is initiated by a mannose-binding lectin, is important in Boltenia
for the recognition of those bacteria which induce metamorphosis and tissue remodeling [12]. It is possible that
the lectins up-regulated at metamorphosis in Acropora

established by microarray these three genes share common expression patterns and thus form a temporo-spatial synexpression group.

Orientation in presettlement and postsettlement larvae is oral upward. Lack of
expression in the prawnchip is followed by expression in a subset of ectodermal cells concentrated at the oral end of the presettlement larvae and postsettlement polyps. Their synexpression both temporally and spatially, suggest that they may be a
novel group of genes interacting with one another.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:540

have an analogous role in activating tissue remodelling.
Consistent with this idea, a possible complement effector,
the perforin domain protein apextrin, is expressed in a
strikingly similar pattern to those of the CELIII lectins during metamorphosis in Acropora [56].
Lectin domain-containing proteins also potentially function in the recognition of symbionts by corals. Lectin/
polysaccharide signalling is used in many systems as a
mechanism for symbiont recognition, the most widely
known example being the recognition of sugars on the
surface of nitrogen-fixing bacteria by the lectins of their
host legume during the establishment of their symbiosis.
Symbiodinium in scleractinian corals reside in the endoderm, and two mechanisms of entry have been described
in those corals that acquire them from the environment.
The first is directly into the endoderm via the oral pore
after it is formed 3–5 days post fertilization in association
with feeding, as was demonstrated in the coral Fungia scutaria [25] and the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima [57].
The second, also demonstrated in Fungia [24], is that they
can enter via the epithelium pre- or post-gastrulation.
Those which have entered by the ectoderm are then
shunted to the endoderm where they are retained [24].
Elegant studies in the latter half of the last century
described the cell biology of symbiont uptake and retention, for example [58], and it has recently been established that members of the Rab family of proteins are
involved in determining whether symbionts are digested
or retained [59-61]. Symbiodinium are not transmitted
through the eggs of A. millepora, and while planulae can be
infected [23] this may only occur after the oral pore has
opened shortly before settlement ([22] and AH Baird, pers
comm.) although the timing and mode of symbiont
uptake remain to be firmly established. The limited available field observations indicate that infection normally
does not occur until a few days after settlement in A. millepora [21]. These observations point to the endoderm as
the likeliest point of Symbiodinium uptake, but do not rule
out a possible role for the ectoderm. There is clear evidence from a number of cnidarian species of selective
maintenance of the most "appropriate" clade of symbiont, while conclusions on specificity of uptake and its
possible mechanisms are equivocal, perhaps due to interspecific variabity. Nevertheless, there is evidence that
lectins function in symbiont recognition, as previously
summarised, and these molecules therefore remain obvious candidates for roles in symbiont uptake and maintenance by Acropora.
Genes involved in calcification
Two alpha type carbonic anhydrases are expressed in patterns that are consistent with roles in calcification. However, these genes are not restricted to heavily calcifying
cnidarians, as both have probable orthologs in sea anem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/540

ones and other cnidarians. This is perhaps not surprising,
as carbonic anhydrases are involved in pH and CO2/bicarbonate homeostasis in all organisms, and the ability to
deposit some form of calcified exoskeleton is taxonomically widespread among cnidarians. For example, polyps
of the hydrozoan Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus secrete a
mat of calcium carbonate, in the form of aragonite, on
their substrate [62]. Two membrane-associated carbonic
anhydrases have been described from planulae of the
coral Fungia scutaria, but they are short and missing amino
acids thought to be necessary for CA activity, although the
authors hypothesize that they could play a role in the
onset of calcification at the time of settlement [63]. The
first Acropora carbonic anhydrase, C007-E7, matches most
strongly to vertebrate IV/XV-type carbonic anhydrases,
and consistent with this, is predicted to be GPI anchored.
C007-E7 has likely orthologs in both Nematostella and
Hydra. The second carbonic anhydrase, A30-E11, is a I/IItype carbonic anhydrase and is likely to be the Acropora
ortholog of a protein identified in the sea anemone,
Anthopleura elegantissima (29.8% identity and 43.1% similarity) as a "symbiosis gene" – it is strongly up-regulated
when this facultatively symbiotic anemone takes up endosymbionts [64]. However, clear counterparts of this soluble cytosolic type carbonic anhydrase are present in both
Nematostella and Hydra magnipapillata, neither of which
harbours symbionts. Whereas the two carbonic anhydrase
genes are not restricted to calcifying cnidarians, a number
of other coral genes with similar expression patterns have
no apparent sea anemone or Hydra homologs. One possible scenario is that many of the genes involved in calcium
processing will have a widespread distribution while
some of those involved in secreting the organic matrix
may be more specific, as in the case of galaxin. It will be
particularly interesting to see whether different gene repertoires play a significant part in the determining the dramatic differences in colony morphology that are
characteristic of the various corals or whether this is due
mainly to deploying the same genes in different ways.
"Coral-specific" processes as variations on known themes
One conclusion that follows from the work presented
above is that many of the molecules involved in "coralspecific" processes such as metamorphosis and calcification are not coral specific – genes whose expression patterns imply key roles in implementing metamorphosis,
such as the lectins A036-E7 and A049-E7 and apextrin
[56] have homologs in other animals even though they
are not present in Nematostella. Both of the carbonic anhydrases implicated in calcification also have clear counterparts in non-calcifying cnidarians. A second conclusion is
that processes central to coral biology, such as symbiont
recognition, may have analogous biochemical bases in
phylogenetically distant systems. Lectins function in symbiont recognition in the legume-Rhizobium system; this

Page 13 of 18

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:540

analogy may be useful in understanding how specificity
might be achieved in the coral/dinoflagellate symbiosis
and in exploring the roles of the candidate molecules
identified here. As in ascidians, metamorphosis in Acropora involves activation of an innate immune response, as
both lectins and the perforin domain protein apextrin are
strongly and specifically expressed at this time. Inevitably,
other genes implicated in coral-specific processes appear
at this stage to be taxon-restricted, but it is unclear to what
extent this simply reflects the limited number and range of
animals for which whole genome data are yet available.
Genes that are today considered "coral-specific" may actually be more widely distributed; the number of genes considered vertebrate-specific shrinks with the publication of
each additional animal whole genome sequence. Moreover, genes with no clear homologs may simply be old
genes that have evolved beyond recognition.
One promising approach arises from the prediction that
genes involved in "coral-specific" processes such as symbiont recognition are under positive selection. With the
imminent availability of large EST datasets for several corals, a combination of in silico and in situ approaches
should identify these genes and build on the pioneering
study reported here.

array slides. Phage suspension was used as template by
adding 4 ul to the PCR mix. TempliPhi was used as a template by dipping a pin into the TempliPhi reaction and
then into the PCR mix. PCR was carried out in 96-well
plates (ABGene) under the following conditions: 94°C
for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min, for 30–35
cycles. PCR products were purified using 96 well Multiscreen plates (Millipore).
Microarrays were generated by spotting the amplified
cDNA onto GAPSII slides using a Biorad Chipwriter Pro,
and then fixed by UV light exposure (150 mJ) followed by
baking at 80°C for 3 hours. All cDNA clones represented
on the arrays were sequenced from the 5' direction using
standard Sanger (ABI Big Dye) sequencing technology.
EST analyses
After data filtering, ESTs were clustered using CAP3 [66].
The coding potential of the resulting unigenes was analysed using ESTScan [67]. 5081 were predicted to give rise
to bonafide proteins, using the criterion of a coding
potential of 25 or greater. The EST contigs which had predicted peptides were used to search the Uniprot database
using BlastX [68] with a threshold of e = 1 × 10-5 in order
to functionally classify the predicted proteins according to
the scheme in [10].

Methods
Microarray description
The microarrays used in this experiment consisted of
13,392 spots derived from 12,240 cDNA clones (1,152
clones are represented more than once) and 432 spots
representing positive and negative controls. The cDNA
clones spotted onto the array were randomly selected
from cDNA libraries that had been constructed in Lambda
ZAP (Stratagene), and include 3456 clones from the
prawnchip developmental stage, 4608 clones from the
planula larva stage [65], and 4128 clones from the primary polyp. All of the material used for making the libraries came from Nelly Bay, Magnetic Island, Queensland,
Australia (19°08'S 146°50'E).

All cDNAs spotted onto the slides were derived from
cDNA libraries of the appropriate developmental stages.
They were isolated by TempliPhi (GE Life Sciences) on
excised clones except for 2,000 postsettlement polyp
clones which were PCR amplified directly from individual
phage suspensions and 3,012 planula larva cDNAs which
were isolated previously [2]
Generation and spotting of cDNAs
PCR (1× HotMaster Taq Reaction buffer, 0.25 mM each
dNTP, 25 pmoles of each of M13 Forward and M13
Reverse primer, 1.25 units of HotMaster Taq Polymerase
(Eppendorf) spiked with Pfu (Promega) in a 25 ul reaction) was used to generate DNA for spotting onto micro-

Experimental design
To assay for changes in gene expression during Acropora
development, mRNA was isolated from four different
developmental stages: the pre-gastrula "prawn chip" stage
(8 hpf), the planula larva stage (83 hpf), the post-settlement primary polyp (130 hpf) and the adult colony. The
rationale for selecting these stages is that they span key
developmental events including the establishment of tissue layers and body axes at gastrulation, the transduction
of settlement cues, settlement and metamorphosis, and
the initiation of calcification and uptake of symbionts.
Prawn chips, planula larvae and primary polyps were the
offspring of colonies collected from Nelly Bay, Magnetic
Island (19°08'S 146°50'E). Adult tissue was obtained
from a colony in the same bay. Pools of approximately
1000 embryos were made to create each biological replicate [69]. Total RNA was extracted from these for each of
our stage specific 'targets'. Tissue from a single colony was
used in the case of adult RNA extraction. The entire experiment was replicated on different days using separate collections of material thus giving two biological replicates.
Within each biological replicate, each developmental
stage was compared with every other twice; once in each
dye orientation. Thus, there are two biological and two
technical replicates for each comparison (Figure 7). Since
there are six possible comparisons with this design the
entire experiment used 24 slides – 12 for each biological
replicate.

Page 14 of 18

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:540

cDNA for probing arrays was produced from unamplified
total RNA which was extracted using TRI Reagent
(Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The quality was assessed using denaturing gel electrophoresis using standard methods [70]. For each hybridized sample, total RNA (80 ug) was reverse transcribed,
labelled and hybridised using standard protocols [71].
Data analysis and verification
Slides were scanned using a GenePix 4200A scanner, and
data extracted using Spot [72]. All further analyses were
carried out using the limma package [73] for the R system
[74]. Print-tip loess normalisation [75] was performed on
each slide. Quantile normalisation was applied to mean
log-intensities in order to make the distributions essentially the same across arrays.

The methodology used for statistical analysis is described
in Smyth [76]. The prior probability of differential expression, for each pair of comparisons between stages, was
taken as 0.1. The Benjamini and Hochberg method [77]
was used to adjust the sequence-wise p-values, so that a
choice of sequences for which the adjusted p-value is at
most 0.05 identifies a set of differentially expressed genes
in which 5% may be falsely identified as differentially
expressed (see Additional File 4 for more detail). Array
data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number GSE11251).

stage used in this experiment was directly compared to all
others. Each arrow represents four hybridizations; two in
one dye orientation (Cy3–Cy5) and two in the other (Cy5–
Cy3), hence 24 slides were used in total. Further details are
given in Materials and Methods.

Results were also verified using M vs A plots, where M =
the log ratio of the spot fluorescence intensity values and
A = the log of the average spot fluorescence intensity. An
example is given in Additional File 5. Spots for which no
fluorescence was expected, including salmon sperm DNA,
empty vector and primers, plotted near the origin of the
MA plot, as expected. Negative controls for differential
expression (i.e. spots expected to show hybridization but
no differential expression), had an M value of or near to
zero, but ranged in fluorescence intensity, also in accordance with expectations. Differentially expressed positive
controls (i.e, spots expected to show both hybridization
and differential expression between presettlement and
postsettlement on the basis of virtual northern results)
were positioned on either side of an M value of zero with
a range of fluorescence intensities.
Cluster analysis was used to search for clusters of expression profiles in the data. K-means clustering was used to
split the genes into 6 groups of differential expression profiles. Clustering was carried out using Cluster 3.0 [78] and
the results viewed with Java TreeView [79]. Unigenes with
protein coding potential > 25 and p-value < 0.05 in the
test for differential expression between temporally
sequential developmental stages were removed prior to
cluster analysis.
Results for the microarray experiments were verified using
"virtual northern blots" which were made using the Clontech SMART cDNA Synthesis Kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions using RNA from the same stages
used in the microarray experiment. DNA used to probe
the blots was generated by PCR (see section 2.5.4 PCR and
spotting of cDNAs), purified using the Qiagen PCR Purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions,
and radiolabelled with 32P-dATP using the Prime-A-Gene
Labeling System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was conducted according to standard protocols [70] and visualized by exposure
to a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) cassette overnight. Digital images were viewed with Quantity One software.
Low-throughput sequencing
In order to obtain the entire open reading frame, some
unigenes selected for in situ hybridization required further sequencing. This was done either as described for EST
sequencing or using 300 ng of plasmid as template. Raw
data were viewed and edited with Chromas Lite and
sequences were aligned with LaserGene (DNASTAR).
cDNA sequences for genes characterized by in situ hybridization have been deposited in GenBank under accession
numbers EU863776–EU863788.
