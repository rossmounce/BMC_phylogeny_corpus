Amerindian nations in extant homopatric
Brazilian populations

Abstract
Background: Brazilian Amerindians have experienced a drastic population decrease in the past 500 years. Indeed,
many native groups from eastern Brazil have vanished. However, their mitochondrial mtDNA haplotypes, still persist
in Brazilians, at least 50 million of whom carry Amerindian mitochondrial lineages. Our objective was to test
whether, by analyzing extant rural populations from regions anciently occupied by specific Amerindian groups, we
could identify potentially authentic mitochondrial lineages, a strategy we have named ‘homopatric targeting’.
Results: We studied 173 individuals from Queixadinha, a small village located in a territory previously occupied by
the now extinct Botocudo Amerindian nation. Pedigree analysis revealed 74 unrelated matrilineages, which were
screened for Amerindian mtDNA lineages by restriction fragment length polymorphism. A cosmopolitan control
group was composed of 100 individuals from surrounding cities. All Amerindian lineages identified had their
hypervariable segment HVSI sequenced, yielding 13 Amerindian haplotypes in Queixadinha, nine of which were
not present in available databanks or in the literature. Among these haplotypes, there was a significant excess of
haplogroup C (70%) and absence of haplogroup A lineages, which were the most common in the control group.
The novelty of the haplotypes and the excess of the C haplogroup suggested that we might indeed have
identified Botocudo lineages. To validate our strategy, we studied teeth extracted from 14 ancient skulls of
Botocudo Amerindians from the collection of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. We recovered mtDNA
sequences from all the teeth, identifying only six different haplotypes (a low haplotypic diversity of 0.8352 ±
0.0617), one of which was present among the lineages observed in the extant individuals studied.
Conclusions: These findings validate the technique of homopatric targeting as a useful new strategy to study the
peopling and colonization of the New World, especially when direct analysis of genetic material is not possible.

Background
When Europeans arrived in Brazil in 1500, they found
more than two million Amerindians [1], many of them
inhabiting the eastern part of the country. Five hundred
years later, in the 2000 Brazilian census, there remained
only 734 thousand Amerindians in Brazil, almost all of
them living in the northern (Amazon region) and the western states. We know almost nothing about the genetic
makeup of the once numerous Amerindian populations

that lived in the eastern part of Brazil. Even the historical
evidence that we have is meager, and limited to imperfect
reports written by European scientific expeditions who
came to Brazil early in the 19th century [2].
One of the best known eastern Brazilian Amerindian
nations was the Botocudos, a hunting-gatherer group
that is mentioned in Darwin’s The Descent of Man. The
names this tribe used themselves were ‘Gren’ or ‘Kren’;
the name ‘Botocudos’ (by which they are generally
referred) was given to them by the Portuguese because
they inserted into their lower lips and earlobes wooden
disks similar to the corks of wine casks (botoques) used
in Portugal. The Botocudos belonged to the Macro-Je
linguistic group, and inhabited adjacent regions in the

states of Minas Gerais, Bahia and Espírito Santo, in
southeast Brazil [3]. We do not have information
on whether they were linguistically, culturally and
genetically homogeneous, or if all they shared were the
physical appearances, the ornaments and their huntergatherer lifestyle.
In 1808, the Portuguese royal court moved to Brazil,
fleeing from the Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian
Peninsula. Soon afterwards, Prince Regent João, acting
on reports about the Botocudo savagery and their refusal to subject to European rule, declared war on their
nation, a policy that eventually led to their virtual
extinction [4]. Nowadays, their only descendants are a
very small group (<500 individuals) of Krenak Indians,
who are considerably admixed with other Indian
groups [3].
In 2000, Alves-Silva et al. [5] reported that approximately one-third of the mitochondrial mtDNA lineages
of self-identified ‘white’ cosmopolitan Brazilians had
Amerindian origin. Because the population of Brazil is
approximately 190 million inhabitants, a naive extrapolation would lead us to expect the existence of roughly
60 million Brazilians carrying Amerindian mtDNA. If it
were possible to study this DNA and ascertain the
Amerindian group from which those individuals originated, it might also be possible to reconstitute the
mtDNA haplotype profile of many extinct original native
populations.
We reasoned that the chances of success would be
much improved if we studied extant populations that
have always lived in small regions once inhabited by
specific Amerindian nations. We have called this strategy ‘homopatric targeting’, a neologism made up of the
Greek roots ομοιος (homos) meaning ‘the same’ and
πaτrίδa (patrida) meaning ‘fatherland’.
In this paper, we present the results of this technique
applied to the rural population of Queixadinha which is
located in the northeast part of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil, in what is known as the homeland until
the first part of the 19th century of the now virtually
extinct Botocudo nation of Amerindians [3,4]. This
study led to the identification of some mtDNA haplotypes that had not hitherto been described in any other
human population studied, and these are candidate
Botocudo haplotypes.
The presence of skeletons classified as Botocudos
stored in the anthropological collection of the National
Museum in Rio de Janeiro provided us with the material
to investigate the validity of our approach. We studied
teeth extracted from 14 ancient Botocudo skulls, identifying one haplotype that was present among the lineages
observed in the extant individuals studied. Thus, homopatric targeting emerges as a useful new phylogeographical strategy to study the peopling and colonization of

the New World, especially when direct analysis of
genetic material is not possible.

Results
Study of the variability of haplotypes and lineages of
Amerindian mtDNA from populations of Minas Gerais

The population studied comprised 173 individuals from
the rural community of Queixadinha (termed QUEIX
hereafter) in the Vale do Jequitinhonha region of the
state of Minas Gerais in Brazil, occupied before the 19th
Century by the Botocudo Amerindian nation. Threegeneration pedigrees were obtained, and individuals who
belonged to the same maternal lineages were removed
from the study. Thus, of the original 173 samples, we
included 74 matrilineally unrelated individuals in the
study. We investigated their mitochondrial ancestry by
standard restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) for haplogroups A, B, C, D, × and M, as
described previously [6-10]. In total, 20 probable
Ameridian matrilineal lineages were identified (27.0%),
classified as follows: 14 of haplogroup C (70.0%), four of
haplogroup B (20.0%) and two of haplogroup D (10.0%)
(Table 1). No matrilineage belonged to haplogroup A or
M, or to any Amerindian × lineage.
Likewise, of the 100 cosmopolitan unrelated samples
from northeastern Minas Gerais (MGNE), we identified
24 (24%) as belonging to Amerindian haplogroups: nine
of haplogroup A (37.5%), seven of haplogroup B (29.2%)
and four each of haplogroups C and D (16.7% each)
(data not shown). Again, no matrilineage belonged to
haplogroup M or Amerindian X.
The frequencies of 27.0% of Amerindian lineages in
the rural population (QUEIX) and 24.0% in the cosmopolitan population (MGNE) are commensurate with the
findings of Alves-Silva et al. [5] in Brazilians. However,
the discrepancy in the relative haplogroup frequencies
was puzzling. In QUEIX, the prevalence of haplogroup
C was high (70.0%), whereas haplogroup A was absent.
By contrast, in MGNE, haplogroup A was predominant
(37.5%), whereas haplogroup C was present in a more
modest proportion (16.7%), in general concordance with
our previous results for the whole of Brazil [5]. The difference in haplogroup distribution between these two
regions was highly significant (c2 = 15.8; P < 0.001).
In the 20 mtDNA HVSI sequences obtained from the
QUEIX samples, we identified 13 different haplotypes,
the sequence of which (318 bp from 16045 to 16362) is
shown in Table 1.
The B, C and D founding haplogroups [8,11] were all
present in this study, being represented by haplotypes
MG11, MG27 and MG37. For all samples of haplogroup
C, we performed sequencing of the hypervariable segment (HVS)II, and confirmed the presence of the other
polymorphisms characteristic of this haplogroup [12].

The haplotype diversity of the Amerindian QUEIX
samples was 0.9263 ± 0.0431, lower than that of the
cosmopolitan Amerindian lineages in MGNE, which
was 0.9746 ± 0.020, similar to that of the Amerindian
lineages of the white population of Brazil (0.9780 ±
0.0083) [5]. Additionally, we used mtDNA HVSI haplotype frequencies to perform an exact test of population differentiation comparing the QUEIX sample and
the control MGNE sample with data previously
obtained for the north, northeast and south regions of
Brazil (BR-SE) or for the southeast of Brazil (BRSE)
[5]. The results showed that the MGNE, BR-SE and
BRSE samples did not differ significantly from each
other, but that QUEIX differed from all three, and
this difference was highly significant (see Additional
file 1).

Phylogeographic and comparative study of Amerindian
lineages

We could not find any instance of haplogroup B
lineages MG18, MG22, MG 23 or MG24 in available
databases or in the literature (see Additional files 2 and
3). One interesting mutation is the transition T®C in
position 16178, found in all these four B lineages. As far
as we could find, this mutation has only been previously
identified in two other individuals, both from urban
contemporaneous populations in the south and southeast of Brazil [5]. This transition might conceivably be
considered a marker for the identification of Amerindian
lineages of extinct populations from Brazil. From the
lineages of haplogroup B, we selected MG18 and MG24
for minisequencing. Similarly, we could not find any
previous description of haplogroup D lineage MG39 (see

Gonçalves et al. Investigative Genetics 2010, 1:13
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/1/1/13

Additional files 2 and 3). This haplotype presents a
transition in position 16278 that has not yet been
described in any other native population analyzed to
date, but we also found it in two sequences of the D
haplogroup in the control cosmopolitan MGNE sample
(data not shown). We selected the haplotype MG39 for
minisequencing.
Of the haplotypes identified in the QUEIX sample,
70% belonged to haplogroup C. The modal haplotype
was MG33, found in five individuals, which we did not
find in any databases or in the literature, and is possibly
typical of the region (see Additional files 2 and 3). It is
characterized by transitions in nucleotides 16166, 16224,
16260 and 16356, associated with the known markers of
haplogroup C (16223, 16298, 16325 and 16327). Thus,
haplotype MG33 was submitted for further phylogenetic
analysis via minisequencing.
Haplotypes MG30, MG31 and MG34 were also not
encountered in any database or in the literature after
extensive searches, as described in Methods (See Additional files 2 and 3). Of special interest in this group
was haplotype MG30, which was found in three individuals from Queixadinha. With the exception of the transition at position 16051, which is common in several
native American populations [13-15] and was present in
another haplotype (MG31), the other transitions (16217
and 16287) that characterize MG30 have not yet been
identified in any other native American population, and
so were selected for minisequencing. Another haplotype
of interest submitted for minisequencing was MG34,
which was exclusive to the QUEIX sample and was distanced from the founding haplotype by three transitions
(at positions 16205, 16311 and 16327) and one transversion (16113), none of which has been described previously in the literature.

Page 4 of 11

Additional file 4). Mutations at 15487 and 14318
demonstrated that MG30, MG33 and MG34 belonged
to haplogroup C, and the presence in all of them of
HSVI 16325C (Table 1) specified the presence of
Amerindian haplogroup C1.
Results on mtDNA extracted from old samples of teeth
thought to be Botocudo

We analysed teeth extracted from 14 skulls in the collection of the Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro,
which are thought to be remains of Botocudo Amerindians (Table 2). By sequencing two smaller overlapping
fragments of HVSI, we obtained sequences 318 bp in
length (extending from nucleotides 16045 to 16362 of
the Cambridge Reference Sequence [19]) in both directions from mtDNA isolated from these teeth. Twelve
of the HVSI samples contained transitions that are
characteristic of Native American C haplogroup (16223
C®T, 16298 T®C, 16325T®C and 16327 C®T)
[8,20]. The other two haplotypes contained substitutions at nucleotides 16189 T®C and 16217 T®C and
were therefore initially classified as haplogroup B
[8,20]. These two samples belonging to haplotype B
will be described in detail in a forthcoming publication
(V.F. Gonçalves, F.C. Parra, H. Gonçalves-Dornelas, C.
Rodrigues-Carvalho, H.P. Silva and Sergio D.J. Pena, in
preparation). Notably, we did not find among the teeth

Because the two hypervariable segments (HVSI and

for confirmation of the Amerindian origin of the samples selected as possible genetic signatures for the
extinct indigenous populations previously inhabiting
the region. Studies on complete mtDNA sequences
have allowed the identification of polymorphisms present at coding regions that can differentiate between
the ancestral Asiatic haplogroups and the Amerindian
descendents [12,16,17]. The minisequencing approach
[18] allowed the allocation of MG18 and MG24 to
Amerindian haplotypes B2 and MG39 to Amerindian
D1, by determining the presence of polymorphisms at
positions 11177, 3547, 4977, 6473 and 9950 from haplogroup B2 and 2092 from haplogroup D1 (See

any instance of the two other major Native American
haplogroups, A and D.
The 14 HVSI sequences recovered from the ancient
teeth code for six haplotypes defined by 15 different
polymorphic sites. Gene diversity was calculated as only
0.8352 ± 0.0617 (even lower than the QUEIX samples),
and nucleotide diversity was estimated at 0.014687 ±
0.008591.
A haplotype network of the sequences found in the
QUEIX and the Botocudo teeth samples is shown in
Figure 1. Our most significant finding was that the
HVSI sequence Bot04, found in four individuals, was
identical to MG31 (Table 1). We could not find any

Page 5 of 11

description of this haplotype in the literature, even after
extensive searches.
The founding haplotype of the Native American haplogroup C was present in three skulls, being coded as
Bot01 (Figure 1). This haplotype is widespread in Native
American populations [21,22], and was also found in
two individuals in our cosmopolitan MGNE control
sample (data not shown).
The HVSI sequence of Bot02 haplotype (found in a
single skull) is characterized by the transition in
nt16129 (G®A) in addition to the aforementioned specific markers for haplogroup C. This lineage is shared
with individuals of other South American populations,

or in the literature are shown in blue, and haplotypes shared with other groups are shown in green. Haplotypes MG27 and MG29 (white) were

such as the Guahibo from Venezuela [23], and the Marajó, Trombetas and Santarém from the Brazilian Amazon region [24] and Chile [25].
Haplotype Bot03 (Table 1) was seen in four individuals (two from the Mutum area in the state of Espirito
Santo, and the other two from Minas Gerais, one from
the valley of the Mucuri river and the other from the
Doce river valley). We could not find any description of
this haplotype or of Bot04 (mentioned above) in the literature, even after extensive searches (see Methods).

Discussion
The Brazilian population is the product of genetic
admixture between three ancestral groups: native Amerindians, European colonizers and African slaves. We
have previously demonstrated that the vast majority of
the chromosome Y lineages found in the contemporaneous Brazilian population, independent of their geographical region, is of European origin (98%) [26]. By
contrast, mtDNA throughout Brazil has a much more
uniform distribution of geographical origin, with European lineages making up 39%, Amerindian 33% and
African 28%, and presents regional differences that correlate with the history of colonization for each region
[5]. Together, these results reveal a sexually asymmetrical pattern of reproduction, with the male contribution
being mostly European and the maternal contribution
being mainly Amerindian and African.
Extrapolating from this to the current population of
Brazil, which is approximately 190 million inhabitants,
we would expect the existence of roughly 60 million
Brazilians carrying Amerindian mtDNA. If we could
study this DNA and ascertain the Amerindian group
from which the individuals originated, it might be possible to reconstitute the mtDNA haplotype profile of
many extinct original native populations. Our strategy,
which we propose to call homopatric targeting, is to
concentrate the searches in extant populations that have
always lived in small regions once inhabited by specific
Amerindian nations. In this way, we could explore the
mtDNA lineages of population groups that no longer
exist.
The Botocudos present interesting anthropometric
craniometric characteristics that distinguish them from
the vast majority of other Amerindians, and suggest that
they might conceivably be related to the Paleoindians
from the Lagoa Santa region in Brazil [27]. We studied
DNA samples from the population of Queixadinha, a
rural community in the Jequitinhonha valley (QUEIX)
and used as controls 100 DNA samples from residents
in cities that were also in the northeastern region of
Minas Gerais (MGNE), an area that included the valleys
of the Jequitinhonha, Mucuri and Doce Rivers and data
from cosmopolitan centers of Brazil [5].

We found 13 different Amerindian mtDNA haplotypes in samples from Queixadinha, nine of which
could not be found in available databases or in the literature after extensive searches (see Methods; see
Additional files 2 and 3). We believe that they are
most likely of Botocudo origin, based on two reasons.
First, the local population is largely indigenous to the
geographical region; it is an arid and poor area,
attracting practically no migrants. The continuous low
population size and reproductive isolation are reflected
in a lower rate of mtDNA haplotype diversity compared with the cosmopolitan population of surrounding cities. Second, the only Amerindian inhabitants in
the region were the Botocudos, who were sufficiently
ferocious to keep all other groups at bay.
At first sight, we might expect that haplotypes MG30
and MG33, respectively found in three and five apparently
non-matrilineally related individuals of Queixadinha,
might be especially frequent among the Botocudos.
Nevertheless, because of genetic drift, there is no compelling reason to believe that present-day haplotype frequencies reflect the ancient relative abundance of these
haplotypes. Of course, the Botocudo origin for the identified Amerindian mtDNA haplotypes in our homopatric
targeting is only inferred, not proven. However, it constitutes a concrete hypothesis that we could test by
analyses of mtDNA extracted from ancient remains of presumed Botocudo skulls in the Museu Nacional do Rio de
Janeiro.
We sequenced the HVSI of DNA extracted from
ancient teeth of 14 Botocudo skulls, and obtained six
different mtDNA haplotypes. Of these six haplotypes,
four were classified as Amerindian haplogroup C.
Although these are small numbers, they suggest that
Botocudos indeed had an excess of Amerindian haplogroup C lineages, possibly as a consequence of several
founder effects and/or narrow bottlenecks occurring in
the past of this population of hunter-gatherers. This scenario is also supported by the low genetic diversity
(0.835) found in Botocudos. Likewise, we suggest that
the absence of Amerindian haplogroup A in both the
Queixadinha and the Botocudo samples is related, probably also because of genetic drift. By contrast, the
absence of Amerindian D lineages in the Botocudo sample gene pool was not unexpected, because this haplogroup represents only 10% of the Amerindian
matrilineages in QUEIX.
The analysis of the distribution of the ancient Botocudos HVSI haplotypes among 5,133 Amerindian haplotypes (beyond the public mtDNA sequences databases)
showed that, except for one individual from Zona da
Mata, the Bot04 haplotype is exclusively present in the
QUEIX population. This result is sufficient to validate
our ‘homopatric targeting’ strategy.

In conclusion, our success in using the present-day
population to retrieve the genetic lineages of peoples
who are now extinct opens up an important pathway
towards the reconstitution of our history, especially in
cases in which direct analysis of the specific genetic
material has become impossible.

Methods
Consent was obtained from all participants, and all
DNA analyses were performed anonymously. The study
was approved by the local ethics committees of all the
institutions involved in sample collection.
Extant populations

The population studied has been described previously
[28], and included 173 individuals from the rural community of Queixadinha (17.12° S; 41.42° W) in the Vale
do Jequitinhonha region of the state of Minas Gerais in
Brazil, occupied before the 19th Century by the Botocudo Amerindian nation. Three-generation pedigrees
were obtained, and individuals who belonged to the
same maternal lineages were removed from the study.
Thus, 74 matrilineally unrelated individuals remained
for further study of their mitochondrial ancestry. As
controls, we analyzed DNA samples from 100 unrelated
cosmopolitan individuals living in cities in the same
macrogeographic region in the northeastern part of the
state of Minas Gerais, obtained from paternity casework.
RFLP analysis and selection of Amerindian mtDNA
candidates

Five amplified segments in the mtDNA coding region
were analyzed by RFLP tests to type haplogroup-specific
sites as follows: haplogroup A, + 663, HaeIII; haplogroup C, -13259, HincII; haplogroup D, -5176, AluI
and haplogroup X, -1715, DdeI. Haplogroup B was identified using the 9 bp polymorphic deletion (region V,
between COII and tRNALys). All PCR amplifications and
digestions were carried out according to previously
described protocols [5].
mtDNA control region amplification and sequencing

The nucleotide sequences of the HVSI and II of the
control region of the mitochondrial DNA were determined for all individuals who had been typed as belonging to the Amerindian haplogroups A, B, C, D and X,
and for those that possibly belonged to haplogroup M.
The method used was direct sequencing from PCR products; both strands of each sample were sequenced and
analyzed separately. Subsequently, the sequences were
compared with the reference sequence of human mitochondrial DNA [19,29], and the mutations (or polymorphisms) characteristic of each lineage and each
individual were identified.

Page 7 of 11

The initial amplifications via PCR were performed
using two pairs of specific primers (Table 3) The PCR
assays were as previously described [5].
Two sequencing methods were used, using two different sequencers. For the reactions using the Automated
laser fluorescence sequencer (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), amplified segments were purified (Wizard™PCR
Preps Kit; Promega BioSciences. Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
and around 300-400 ng of sample were used in the
sequencing reactions, with a commercial fluorescence
label kit (use of the Thermo Sequenase™Primer Cycle
Sequencing Kit with 7-deaza-dGTP; Amersham Life
Sciences, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). In sequencing reactions, fluorescein-labeled primers were use
(Table 3).
For sequencing reactions performed on the automatic
capillary sequencer (MegaBACE 1000; GE Healthcare,
USA), around 40 to 50 ng of PCR product were mixed
with 10 μM of primer (MiL15996 for direct sequencing
of the HVSI and MiL16401 for the reverse, with the
M13-universal and M13 reverse primers for the direct
and reverse strands of HVSII) and 4 μl of reagent from
a (DYEnamic™E dye terminator kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), thus making a total volume of 10 μl. The
mixture underwent PCR, and the sequencing products
were purified.
Filtering of artificial mutations generated in the
sequencing process

To avoid the presence of phantom mutations generated artificially in the sequencing process, which might
cause erroneous evolutionary interpretations, we followed the strategies described by Bandelt et al. [30]. In
addition, the direct and reverse strands of all the
sequences were analyzed separately, and all the mutations encountered were carefully certified. The
sequence files generated were analyzed together with
the respective chromatograms.
mtDNA minisequencing

Based on the results obtained from the phylogenetic
analyses of the Amerindian sequences, some haplotypes
were selected as possible genetic signatures of indigenous populations of the region. To verify the presence of
recently described polymorphisms encountered in the
coding region of mtDNA that can better distinguish
between Asian and Amerindian haplogroups [12,16,17],
we developed a minisequencing protocol [18]. Thus, we
were able to avoid the need for complete sequencing of
the mtDNAs, which would have resulted in an excessively high cost for the project.
In total, 13 polymorphisms were analyzed: three from
haplogroup A, six from B, two from C and two from D,
(see Additional file 4). The primers used in the

minisequencing for the regions of interest were as
described by Rieder et al. [31], and the average size of
the products was 800 bp. The primers for the minisequencing were designed adjacent to the polymorphic
sites, and tails of varying sizes were added, based on the
M13 sequence of the plasmid pUC18. It was thus possible to separate the 13 PCR products in a single reaction
in the ALF automated sequencer.
DNA extraction from the ancient samples

For the analysis, 14 teeth were extracted from skulls
classified as presumed Botocudo Indians (kindly provided by the Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil; Table 2). All the samples were dated to
the 19th century. Unfortunately, the classification was
primarily geographical, and although improbable, we
cannot rule out the possibility that individuals belonging
to another Amerindian group were wrongly included in
this one.
The surfaces of the teeth were cleaned by soaking in
6% sodium hypochlorite for 15 minutes, then rinsed in
double-distilled, ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated water. Each
tooth was ground with a mortar and pestle until a finegrained powder was obtained. Samples (500 mg) of the
powder were transferred into sterile 15 ml tubes, and
the DNA was extracted as described previously [32].
Briefly, the powder was incubated in 10 ml 0.45 M
EDTA and 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K (pH 8.0) in a rotary
oven in the dark at room temperature for 24 hours.
Remnant tissue was removed by centrifugation
(3,000 rpm, 1200 × g) and the supernatant transferred
into 40 ml binding buffer (5 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris) in a 50 ml sterile tube,
and incubated with 100 μl silica suspension (pH
adjusted to 4.0 by adding 37% w/v HCl) for 3 hours in a
rotary oven in the dark at room temperature. The silica
was collected by centrifugation (3,000 rpm) and washed

once with 1 ml binding buffer. The buffer-silica suspension was transferred into a fresh 1.5 ml tube, separated
by centrifugation (13,500 rpm) and washed twice with
washing buffer (50% v/v ethanol, 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH8.0). DNA was eluted into
two tubes, each containing 50 μl Tris-EDTA buffer (pH
8.0) at room temperature. The eluates were separated
into aliquots and stored at -20°C. A negative extraction
control to which no tooth powder was added accompanied each sample extraction (mock extraction).
PCR and sequencing of the ancient samples

The mtDNA analyses were performed by DNA sequencing of HVSI of the control region and specific sites on
the coding region (RFLP) of mtDNA. For these analyses,
two primer pairs were designed to amplify overlapping
fragments that divided the region in two smaller amplicons: fragment 1 (nucleotides 15989 to16251) and fragment 2 (16190 to 16410). For some samples, it was
necessary to divide fragment 2 into two smaller amplicons (16190 to16322 and 16268 to 16410) (See Additional file 5 for primer sequence).
PCR conditions were the same for all reactions. A
sample (3 μl) of the aliquot containing the ancient DNA
(not quantified) was amplified in 20 μl reaction volume
containing 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.3 μM of each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 and 2 U Taq DNA polymerase
(Taq Platinum, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.4 and 50 mM KCl). The
cycling parameters were: initial denaturation at 94°C for
4 min, followed by 44 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C
for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds, with a final
extension step at 72°C for 10 minutes. To confirm amplification, the PCR products (3 μl) were separated in 6%
polyacrylamide gels (PAGE), stained with silver salts and
precipitated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)8000.

Gonçalves et al. Investigative Genetics 2010, 1:13
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/1/1/13

Sequencing reactions were performed on each strand,
using the same primers as for PCR amplification. The
sequencing reaction products were cleaned up and then
run on an automated sequencer (MegaBace 1000; GE
Healthcare), using the same conditions as described
above for the modern samples. Sequencing was performed in both directions (forward and reverse). The
sequence files generated were analyzed together with
the respective chromatograms using Bioedit v.7.0.9 software. (BioEdit, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To monitor for the
possible presence of phantom mutations generated artificially in the sequencing process, we followed the strategies described by Bandelt et al. [30].
Four primer pairs (see Additional file 6) for shorter
amplicons were designed for RFLP analysis of the four
Amerindian haplogroup-specific sites at coding region of
the mtDNA (haplogroup A: + 663, Haelll; haplogroup B,
9 bp deletion (COII/tRNALys); haplogroup C, + 13262,
Alul and haplogroup D, - 5176, Alul. The PCR conditions
were as described above. The PCR amplification product,
(3 μl) was digested for 2 hours at 37°C with 1 U of
the appropriated restriction enzyme. The digestion products were separated in 6% PAGE gels, which were
stained with silver for identification of the presence or
absence of the restriction sites that characterize haplogroups A, C or D and of the 9 bp deletion that defines
haplogroup B.
Contamination prevention

The extractions of ancient DNA and the PCR assays
were performed in a physically separated laboratory, in
which no work with amplified DNA had ever been performed previously. The bench was irradiated with UV
lamps (254 nm) for 30 minutes before all experiments,
and cleaned with a high concentration of sodium hypochlorite. All apparel (gloves, face masks, caps and
laboratory coats) were disposable. Laboratory equipment
(pipettes, tubes, filter tips, centrifuges) were sterilized by
a long exposure to UV (254 nm). All metallic material
and laboratory glassware were sterilized in an oven at
200°C for at least 6 hours. Preparation of ground tooth
powder was performed in a separated room from the
buffer preparation, DNA extraction procedure and PCR
assays. To detect possible contamination by exogenous
modern DNA, extraction and amplification blanks were
used as negative controls, and all personnel involved,
either directly or indirectly in the work were genetically
typed (HVSI) and their profiles compared with the
results obtained from the ancient teeth samples.
Mitochondrial sequence analyses

We manually compared our sequences with 5,133 HVSI
mtDNA sequences from North, Central and South
America (see Additional file 2).We also compared our

Page 9 of 11

sequences with others available only in selected public
DNA sequence databases (EMPOP http://empop.
org, Ambase http://www.lghm.ufpa.br/ambase, mtDB
http://www.genpat.uu.se/mtDB/, mitosearch http://www.
mitosearch.org, hvrbase++ http://www.hvrbase.org), and
with the FBI mtDNA population database http://www2.
fbi.gov/hq/lab/fsc/backissu/april2002/miller1.htm. Our
database search results were up to date as of July 2010.
To compare and understand the relationship between
the sequences found in both Queixadinha and Botocudo
populations, we also performed a median-joining network analysis using the software Network 4.502 [33].
Data analysis

The program CLUMP [34] was used to perform the c2
tests. The Raymond and Rousset test of population differentiation and estimates of haplotype and nucleotide
diversity were calculated with the program Arlequin version 2.000 [35].
