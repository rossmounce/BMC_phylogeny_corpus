Abstract
Background: Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) causes typhoid fever, which remains an important public health issue in many
developing countries. Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, is an area of high incidence and the pediatric population
appears to be at high risk of exposure and infection.
Methods: We recently defined the population structure of S. Typhi, using new sequencing technologies to identify
nearly 2,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can be used as unequivocal phylogenetic markers. Here we
have used the GoldenGate (Illumina) platform to simultaneously type 1,500 of these SNPs in 62 S. Typhi isolates causing
severe typhoid in children admitted to Patan Hospital in Kathmandu.
Results: Eight distinct S. Typhi haplotypes were identified during the 20-month study period, with 68% of isolates
belonging to a subclone of the previously defined H58 S. Typhi. This subclone was closely associated with resistance to
nalidixic acid, with all isolates from this group demonstrating a resistant phenotype and harbouring the same
resistance-associated SNP in GyrA (Phe83). A secondary clone, comprising 19% of isolates, was observed only during
the second half of the study.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the utility of SNP typing for monitoring bacterial populations over a defined
period in a single endemic setting. We provide evidence for genotype introduction and define a nalidixic acid resistant
subclone of S. Typhi, which appears to be the dominant cause of severe pediatric typhoid in Kathmandu during the
study period.
Background
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is the bacterial agent of typhoid fever. S. Typhi is atypical with
respect to the majority of Salmonella serotypes as it does
not have the ability to interact with multiple hosts and is
restricted solely to infecting humans [1]. S. Typhi has
adapted to the human-restricted niche via a number of
genetic mechanisms, including the acquisition of virulence factors and a series of gene inactivation events [24]. The inability of S. Typhi to interact with other hosts
appears to have resulted in the organism becoming genet-

ically isolated and dependant on asymptomatic carriage
for long-term survival in the human population [5-7].
Typhoid fever remains an important public health issue
in many developing countries and predominates in areas
with poor sanitation, which aids its transmission and persistence in the human population [1,8,9]. In countries
where typhoid is endemic, the adolescent fraction of the
population is considered to be at risk [10]. However a
recent study in Kathmandu, Nepal demonstrated that
natural immunity to S. Typhi increased with age, suggesting that the typhoid burden among young children may
have been underestimated [11]. We estimate that the
prevalence of typhoid fever in some parts of Kathmandu,
Nepal is amongst the highest in South Asia [8,12]. A ten
year study was recently reported [13], in which 9,124

invasive Salmonella isolates were recovered from 12,252
positive blood cultures taken at Patan Hospital in Kathmandu in 1993-2002. The majority of isolates were confirmed as S. Typhi. During this retrospective study the
overall rate of enteric fever more than doubled between
2001 and 2003, when compared to the three previous
years [13]. Multiple drug resistance was not deemed a significant problem in Kathmandu during 1993-2003. However in Kathmandu, as in other parts of Asia, reduced
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones increased during this
time [14]. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antimicrobials and include ciprofloxacin, one of the currently
recommended and highly effective antimicrobials for the
treatment of enteric fever in endemic regions [15]. Resistance to nalidixic acid is a marker for reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, and mutations which induce
initial nalidixic acid resistance often precede the evolution of fluoroquinolone resistance [16]. Fluoroquinolones
target bacterial topoisomerases, in particular the DNA
gyrase protein (GyrA) and inhibit DNA replication. A
single nucleotide mutation at either codon 83 or 87 of the
gene encoding the GyrA protein (gyrA) confers resistance
to nalidixic acid in S. Typhi [17].
The detection of phylogenetically informative genetic
variation is pivotal for the study of pathogen populations
circulating in a given area and over time. Many techniques are routinely used to achieve differentiation
between bacterial pathogens. However, not all methods
provide phylogenetic and genotypic information offering
a high degree of specificity, reproducibility and sensitivity. Arguably, only systems that allow a direct comparison
of specific nucleotide sequences, such as multi-locus
sequence typing (MLST) or single nucleotide polymorphism typing (SNP typing) permit accurate differentiation of a bacterial population [18,19].
Defining the circulating population is particularly challenging for studies of S. Typhi, as this organism is monophyletic and sequence diversity is limited [20]. The
generation of a rooted phylogenetic tree based upon rare
SNPs has permitted a greater understanding and definition of the global population of S. Typhi, and provided a
potential method for tracking the pathogen in an
endemic setting [21]. By assaying SNPs using a highthroughput Sequenom platform, we were previously able
to identify several genetically distinct S. Typhi haplotypes
circulating in an urban area of Jakarta, Indonesia [22].
More recently, we used high-throughput sequencing
technologies to discover nearly 2,000 SNPs within the S.
Typhi population, providing additional loci for SNP typing of clinical isolates [5]. Importantly, the study detected
relatively few examples of other forms of genetic variation
such as insertions and deletions (<30 in total), which
could potentially be used as markers for studying S. Typhi
populations [5].

In the present study, we have developed a custom SNP
array for S. Typhi using the GoldenGate platform (Illumina). The array includes 1,500 of the SNPs identified
previously in the S. Typhi genome [5], providing greater
discriminatory power than any previous study of S. Typhi
and as high as any bacterial SNP typing assay reported to
date [23]. As such the array allows the discrimination of
distinct bacterial clones co-circulating in a local area,
which may be associated with drug resistance or disease
severity. Here we have used the array to differentiate subclones of S. Typhi causing severe typhoid in children aged
2 months - 12 years, admitted to Patan Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, between April 2005 and December 2006
[24].

Methods
Study design and sample collection

The study design was as described previously [24].
Briefly, samples were isolated at Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. Patan Hospital is one of only two large
hospitals in Kathmandu Valley that accepts pediatric
referrals and has pediatric inpatients. All children aged 2
months - 12 years admitted to the pediatric ward at Patan
Hospital from April 2005 to December 2006 with fever
(temperature >38°C) and/or suspected septicaemia were
considered for entry into the study. Admission to hospital
in this case implies severe disease, considered too ill to be
treated as outpatients and requiring treatment with IV
antibiotics. For the final six months of the study, a number of patients attending the outpatient clinic were also
enrolled for examination. These patients had less severe
symptoms, requiring oral administration of antibiotics
only.
Demographic and clinical data were collected by local
clinical research officers after informed consent was
obtained and then were entered into a standardized database. Exclusion criteria were the absence of blood culture
specimens collected at admission, hospitalization for any
illness within the previous 10 days, and presentation with
recurrent wheezing or acute gastroenteritis alone [24].
Invasive Salmonella (S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A) were
the most common bacterial isolates from the study of
children with suspected septicaemia. In total, S. Typhi
was recovered from 62 blood cultures from children with
suspected septicaemia, of which 46 were treated as inpatients and 16 as outpatients. Ethics approval for this study
was obtained from Oxford Tropical Research Ethics
Committee (OXTREC 032-06) and the Nepal Health
Research Council.
Bacterial isolation and identification

Blood culture specimens were obtained from all eligible
children by either hospital staff or staff involved in the
study. Blood specimens of 1-3 ml were collected from all

Holt et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/144

children before antibiotic administration, whenever possible. The majority of blood culture specimens were collected into commercially prepared Soybean-Casein
Digest Broth with Resin blood culture bottles (BACTEC
Peds Plus/F; Becton Dickinson), and all were processed
manually. Blood culture bottles were incubated at 35°C
and were inspected twice daily for turbidity. All samples
had sub-culturing performed, irrespective of turbidity, at
12-24 h and on day seven of incubation. Identification of
Salmonella isolates were confirmed using API-20E strips
(bioMerieux, France) and serotyping was performed
using standard Salmonella serotyping methodology
(Murex, United Kingdom).
Antimicrobial resistance testing

The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic
acid and ceftriaxone were determined by standard disk
diffusion methodology. Zone size interpretation was
measured according Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute guidelines [25].
Nucleic acid isolation

A suspension of an overnight culture of S. Typhi was prepared in 1 ml of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and centrifuged at 16,000 × g rcf in a microfuge for two minutes.
Cells were re-suspended in 600 μl of Nuclei Lysis Buffer
and DNA was extracted as recommended by the manufacturers guidelines (Wizard genomic DNA extraction
kit) (Promega, USA). DNA was re-suspended in 100 μl of
rehydration solution and incubated at 65°C for one hour.
The DNA was stored at 4°C until required for typing.
S. Typhi SNP typing

DNA samples were quantified using the Quant-IT kit
(Qiagen, USA) and concentrations adjusted to 10 ng/μl
using nuclease-free water (Ambicon, USA). DNA samples
were assayed using custom oligo pools using the GoldenGate (Illumina) protocol. DNA samples were arrayed randomly in a 96-well plate, along with one blank (water)
well and control samples (DNA from sequenced Typhi
isolates described in [5]). The array design and genotype
identification was performed as previously described
[26]. The array included targets for over 2,000 loci in the
Typhi chromosome and an IncHI1 drug resistance plasmid [5], and two S. Paratyphi A-specific SNPs to facilitate
identification of mis-serotyped isolates. Sequences surrounding each known SNP were submitted to Illumina
for preliminary design in two pools. SNPs within 60 bp
cannot be included in the same oligo pool, and SNPs
within 10 bp cannot be assayed at all using this method,
due to interference with specific primer binding. SNPs
with SNP score >0.4 were included in the final assays,
comprising two primer pools (200 SNPs were included on
both arrays for quality control purposes). Briefly, signals

Page 3 of 9

from the GoldenGate assay were analyzed using Illuminus-P as previously described [26,27]. The final analyzed
dataset provided high quality allele data for 1,485 chromosomal SNPs and eight plasmid SNPs [26,28]. The full
list of SNP loci and alleles used in the analysis is given in
additional file 1: SNP table. Owing to the proximity of the
SNPs in the gyrA gene, these were detected by use of a
Luminex xMAP system [29,30].
Analysis of SNP data

SNP alleles at 1,485 chromosomal loci, identified from
GoldenGate signals using Illuminus-P [26,27], were concatenated to give a single haplotype string for each strain.
The alignment of these haplotype strings was used as
input for phylogenetic analysis. Initially, the alignment
was analyzed using ModelTest which suggested a general
time reversible (GTR) model provided the most appropriate phylogenetic model for this data. RAxML was used to
fit 1,000 bootstrapped tree topologies and optimize
branch lengths using a GTR model [31,32]. SNP typing
provides genetic information only at the specific assayed
loci; in this case these loci were mostly determined by
whole genome comparison of 19 S. Typhi strains as
described in [5]. Thus, fitting a tree to this data is analogous to fitting each novel S. Typhi isolate into the phylogenetic structure defined previously [5], and the resulting
branch lengths reflect genetic divergence only at the
assayed SNP loci (Figure 1).
Statistical analysis

Rates of female sex and in-patient status were compared
between haplotype groups using pairwise Pearson Chisquare tests. The distributions of patient and clinical variables for patients infected with S. Typhi H58-G and other
haplotypes were compared using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All statistical analysis was performed
using the R package for statistical computing http://
www.r-project.org.

Results
Distribution of S. Typhi haplotypes detected

A total of 62 S. Typhi isolates were available for analysis.
Of these, 46 came from children admitted to Patan Hospital (severe typhoid requiring inpatient treatment with
IV antibiotics) and 16 from children treated as outpatients (less severe typhoid requiring oral administration
of antibiotics). The haplotypes detected among these isolates are indicated in Figure 1 and summarised in Table 1.
The majority of isolates (70%) were of the H58 haplotype
(Figure 1). Haplotype H42, genetically distant from H58
was also common (19% of isolates), while the remaining
isolates were from distinct haplotypes (Figure 1a).
The GoldenGate assay utilized in this study included 44
SNP loci known to be variable amongst the H58 group,

view of the H58 group in (A). The root of the H58 clonal group is shown
in grey; the dashed line represents the link to the remainder of the S.
Typhi phylogenetic tree. The division between lineage I and lineage II
is indicated using grey vs white background. Leaves of the tree correspond to previously sequenced S. Typih isolates; 8(04)N (Vietnam,
2004), E03-9804 (Nepal, 2003), E02-2759 (India, 2002), ISP-03-07467
(Morocco, 2003), ISP-04-06979 (Central Africa, 2004), AG3 (Vietnam,
2004) and 150(98)S (Vietnam, 1998).

these specific SNPs included 39 that were identified during genome sequencing and five loci previously identified
in H58-derived haplotypes (see additional file 1: SNP
table) [5,21]. These individual SNP loci allow further differentiation of the currently common H58 haplotype and
permit a higher degree of sensitivity and resolution. The
additional H58 specific SNPs sub-divide the H58 popula-

tion into two main lineages, I and II, which can be subdivided further into strain-specific sub-lineages (Figure
1b, SNPs defining these lineages are shown in additional
file 2: H58 tree and SNPs). Of the 43 H58 isolates that
were identified in this study, 41 were indistinguishable at
all 44 intra-H58 loci. The shared haplotype of these
strains, referred to hereafter as H58-G, lay in sub-lineage
II, and shares recent common ancestry with sequenced
strains 8(04)N, E03-9804 and E02-2759 from Vietnam,
Nepal and India, respectively [5]. This common ancestry
is potential evidence for location-specific development of
H58 lineage II S. Typhi in typhoid-endemic regions of
South Asia.
A single H58 isolate, NPL872, shared a similar haplotype to the 41 identical strains but also harboured an
additional SNP that had been previously detected in
strain 150(98)S from H58 lineage I (TreB-Asp135, S.
Typhi CT18 coordinate 4,653,894) (Figure 1b). This could
be the result of recombination between different subtypes within the H58 population. However, due to the
limited recombination in the S. Typhi gene pool,
homoplasy seems a more likely explanation, whereby the
same mutation has arisen independently in different lineages. A second H58 isolate, NPL959, lay in lineage I and
unlike the H58-G group of strains appears to share recent
common ancestry with previously sequenced strains
AG3, 150(98)S, ISP-03-07467 and ISP-04-06979 from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Morocco and Central Africa, respectively (Figure 1b).
The second most common haplotype was shared by 12
isolates, forming a subgroup of the previously defined
H42 haplotype, referred to hereafter as H42-A. All strains
belonging to the H42-A group were identical at all SNP
loci tested. The remaining isolates include four strains
belonging to the H50 haplotype (H50-A), and three singletons each belonging to a unique haplotype (Figure 1a).
S. Typhi haplotype is not associated with age, sex or disease
severity

It is currently unknown if the variation among S. Typhi
haplotypes or lineages drives observable differences in
transmission or clinical presentation of disease syndrome. In this study we found no significant association
between S. Typhi haplotype and patient age, sex, treatment as an inpatient or disease severity measures for
inpatients (Table 1). Haplotype was not associated with
inpatient (severe disease requiring hospital admission
and IV antibiotics) vs outpatient status. For children
admitted as inpatients, S. Typhi haplotype was not associated with fever temperature at admission or duration of
hospital stay (Table 1). The mean age of children infected
with S. Typhi of the H58-G haplotype was slightly higher
than among those infected with other haplotypes (5.0
years vs 4.4 or 3.0 years for other haplotypes, Table 1), as

shown in Figure 2. However the difference in age distributions was not significant (two-sample KolmogorovSmirnov test) and is most likely an artefact driven by the
high frequency of H58-G strains in this study. During the
period of the study, infections in older children were generally less common and thus the chance to observe older
children infected with other haplotypes was reduced
compared to the more abundant H58-G strains. There
does however appear to be a higher level of haplotype
diversity among children under four years of age (Figure
2).
Antimicrobial Resistance

All S. Typhi isolates were tested for resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and nalidixic acid at the time of
initial isolation. All isolates were susceptible to the former six drugs, while only the 42 isolates of H58 lineage II

(including NPL872) were resistant to nalidixic acid (Table
2).
Multidrug resistant (MDR) S. Typhi (resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole) has been
reported previously in Nepal and is usually associated
with the presence of a large IncHI1 plasmid [9,33,34]. All
oligos in the GoldenGate assay targeting IncHI1 plasmid
SNPs failed to generate fluorescent signals in Nepalese
isolates, while generating signals for control isolates that
contain IncHI1 MDR plasmids (CT18, E03-9804, ISP-0307467 and ISP-04-06979 [5]). This is consistent with the
lack of resistance phenotypes among our Nepalese isolates and indicates that the IncHI1 resistance plasmids
common to S. Typhi were absent from the those responsible for typhoid in Kathmandu children during the period
of our study.
Nalidixic acid resistance was restricted only to the H58G group and closely related isolate NPL872, with all 42
isolates demonstrating resistance using the disc diffusion
method (Table 1). All H58 isolates were tested for six
known gyrA mutations: Pro83, Phe83, Tyr83, Asn87,
Tyr87 and Gly87 [21]. All H58-G isolates and NPL872,
each of which displayed nalidixic acid resistance, harboured the Phe83 mutation but were wildtype at codon
87 (Table 2). The lone H58 lineage I isolate NPL959 was
nalidixic acid sensitive and carried wild type alleles at
codons 83 and 87 in the gyrA gene (Table 2).

Typhi infection in temperate regions peaks during the
warmest and wettest time of the year [35]. However the
incidence of typhoid infections requiring hospitalization
was evenly distributed throughout the study period
(mean 2.5 cases per month). During the final six months
of the study, S. Typhi isolates from pediatric outpatients
were also collected. The majority of these cases occurred
in August, the middle of the wet season (see Figure 3).

Typhi haplotypes, including H42-A and H50-A, D) seasonality of rainfall,
taken from the nearest weather station (Kathmandu Tribhuvan International airport). Bars = inpatient cases; Stars = outpatient cases; inpatient cases were only included in last six months of study period,
distinguished by the dashed line.

Thus, there may be a general increase in the incidence of
typhoid fever among children during the wet season, but
this was not associated with an increase in severe typhoid
cases requiring hospitalization, which remained constant
throughout the year.
Notably, the temporal pattern of infection differed
among S. Typhi haplotypes (Figure 3). Hospitalization of
patients infected with H58-G S. Typhi occurred at a constant rate during the course of the study (mean 1.4 cases
per month, Figure 3). However H42-A S. Typhi was not
identified until the second half of the study (Figure 3c,
blue), after which point this haplotype was detected
among inpatients at a mean rate of 0.8 cases per month.
Hospitalizations due to infection with other S. Typhi haplotypes occurred throughout the study, at a mean rate of
0.33 cases per month. The distribution of haplotypes
among isolates collected from outpatients during the last
six months of the study is shown in Figure 3b and 3c. The
distribution of haplotypes was similar for inpatients and
outpatients, as indicated in Table 1.

Discussion
S. Typhi is a monomorphic bacterium which is spread
solely in human populations: it is recently evolved and
genetically isolated and thus sequence diversity within
this bacterial population is highly limited [5,20,21]. To
distinguish and identify commonality between strains, an
assay is required that can identify a limited number of
nucleotide changes on a genome wide scale. Here, we
describe the first high-throughput SNP-based typing
study of S. Typhi strains circulating in Kathmandu, Nepal.
The development of the GoldenGate assay, assessing
1,500 single nucleotide base changes around the genome,
permits a degree of sensitivity and specificity that has
never previously been achieved in a monomorphic bacterial population, and also allows true phylogenetic comparisons. Our findings from this initial investigation
using a whole genome interrogation of S. Typhi shows a
limited number of clones circulating in a local population, with one predominating.
Typhoid fever is an ongoing public health issue in some
countries in Southern Asia and Nepal (especially Kathmandu) is known to have a high burden [8,12,13]. Studying the structure of the local population of S. Typhi is

Holt et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/144

particularly important given the recent increase in strains
which are resistant to nalidixic acid and have reduced
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones [36,37]. Such strains
prolong fluoroquinolone treatment regimes; even more
alarming are recent reports of fully fluoroquinolone resistant S. Typhi [38,39]. Recent genomic studies have provided a greater understanding of the organisms that cause
enteric fever (S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A) [3,40] and
comparative studies within the S. Typhi population have
identified variant loci that facilitate more informative
molecular typing of the organism [5,21]. The SNP typing
approach presented here is reproducible, robust and able
to provide phylogenetic information with which to identify clonal expansion or replacement.
The present study design does however pose some limitations, which affect interpretation of the resulting data.
The study was not population-based, rather it represents
a tiny snapshot of all the typhoid cases in the community,
focusing on children with severe typhoid aged twelve
years and under. There was asymmetrical sample collecting over the period of surveillance, whereby outpatient
samples were included only for the final six months of the
study. In particular, it should be noted that the majority of
isolates studied (46) were from severe typhoid cases with
a history of fever for a mean duration of nine days prior to
admission to hospital, requiring hospitalization for a
mean length of seven days and treatment with IV antibiotics. The majority of typhoid cases are treated at outpatient centres, local health care centres or at home after
purchase of antimicrobials, which are widely available
and subject to uncontrolled use. Thus the samples analysed here may not be representative of the whole of S.
Typhi infections occurring in the human population in
Kathmandu.
In a previous descriptive study of 408 typhoid patients
in the same setting, the median age of infection was 17
years, suggesting that childhood typhoid in Kathmandu is
a relatively small fraction of the total disease burden
[8,12]. In the present study we found no association
between age and haplotype; however further investigation is required to study the haplotype distribution in the
broader population of typhoid fever patients in Kathmandu. There was however greater haplotype diversity
among children under four years of age (Figure 2). This
coincides with lower levels of natural immunity previously observed in this age group, which might result in
susceptibility to a broader range of haplotypes compared
to older children who have increased immunity and may
be susceptible to a narrower range of more virulent haplotypes [11]. However a larger study of typhoid patients
will be required to confirm this hypothesis.
Understanding the distribution of strains over a longer
period may help to define transmission patterns and the
distribution of circulating haplotypes of S. Typhi in this

location. A prospective study of severe typhoid infections
may also aid understanding of disease severity related to
bacterial genotype. The observation that specific genotypes cause severe disease has been made using Pulsed
Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) but not confirmed by
means of newer sequence based typing [41].
Despite the limitations of this work there are some
valuable observations from the findings. Firstly, the S.
Typhi H58 haplotype was the principal strain detected
within the study population; this is also the case in Vietnam and other endemic locations [21]. This finding is
consistent with the hypothesis that the H58 strain is a
dominant clone that spreads easily within and between
human populations and has become efficiently maintained within those populations. Furthermore, the highly
dominant H58 clone has been associated with nalidixic
acid resistance, due to resistance-conferring mutations in
the gyrA gene [21]. Our data validates this observation, as
all H58 lineage II isolates carried gyrA-Phe83 mutations
and these were the only isolates demonstrating nalidixic
acid resistance. This could be indicative of positive selection and dissemination of a single nalidixic acid resistant
H58 clone at high frequency in Kathmandu. The continuing use of fluoroquinolones, possibly at sub-optimal
doses within the community, may continue to aid the
ongoing selection of these organisms.
Patients with typhoid caused by organisms belonging to
the H58 group were seen at a constant rate throughout
the duration of the study. Strain types additional to H58
were also evident, but less common and included H50-A
and H42-A. Of particular interest is the detection of the
H42-A haplotype, the second most common type, only in
the second half of the study period. There are several possible explanations for this. There may be fluctuation in
environmental factors that differentially affect transmission of certain strain types, thus some genotypes may
only appear (and then presumably disappear) transiently.
This may be as simple as stochastic variation in the relative frequencies of Typhi strains within local water
sources, or strain-specific variation in survival under different environmental conditions including fluctuations in
temperature or osmolarity. It is also possible that the
H42-A genotype was introduced into the study population from an exogenous source during the course of the
study. The infection source in these patients is unknown,
so we were not able to determine any additional links
between these cases besides their timing. Long-term carriage of invasive Salmonella is known to be relatively
common in this setting [6], and it could be that all the
H42-A cases were infected from the same source or had
been in contact with a carrier shedding this organism.
Long-term epidemiological studies incorporating genotyping will be needed in order to investigate the issue of
strain introduction and/or transient infection cycles.

Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate the circulation of multiple S.
Typhi strains in Nepalese children during a two-year
period, and in particular the dominance of a single clone
associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. The novel SNP-based methodology used represents
an important tool in molecular epidemiological studies
and as our understanding of the biology and diffusion of
the organism increases it will permit the long-term monitoring of strains circulating in specific locations with high
transmission of S. Typhi.
