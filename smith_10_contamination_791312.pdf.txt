Contamination of clinical specimens with MLVencoding nucleic acids: implications for XMRV
and other candidate human retroviruses
Robert A Smith

Abstract
Efforts to assess the prevalence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in patients with prostate
cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome have relied heavily on PCR-based testing of clinical samples and have yielded
widely divergent findings. This week in Retrovirology, reports from four independent research groups illustrate the
extreme care needed to exclude DNA or RNA contamination in PCR analyses of XMRV. In addition, phylogenetic
evidence suggesting that previously-published XMRV sequences originated from a commonly-used prostate
carcinoma cell line (22Rv1) is presented. These findings raise important questions regarding the provenance of
XMRV and its potential connection to human disease.
Introduction
Reports of a newly-discovered gammaretrovirus (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus; XMRV) in
patients diagnosed with prostate cancer [1,2] and chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) [3] have attracted the attention
of investigators throughout the retroviral research community. XMRV was initially identified in prostate tumor
samples from individuals harboring a specific polymorphism in RNASEL, a gene important for interferonmediated antiviral defense [1]. Studies describing the
receptor usage and integration site preference of the
virus were soon followed by a second report of XMRV
infection in an unrelated cohort of prostate cancer
patients [2]. Although an association between XMRV and
the aforementioned RNASEL polymorphism was not
found [2], the idea that defects in innate immunity might
be linked to XMRV infection prompted others to look
for the virus in patients with CFS [3]. Remarkably, PCR
assays identified XMRV DNA in peripheral blood samples from 68 of 101 CFS patients and 8 of 218 healthy
controls. These and other findings provided compelling
evidence that XMRV is the first known example of an
exogenous human gammaretrovirus.
In contrast, subsequent efforts to assess the prevalence
of XMRV in patients with CFS and prostate cancer have

reached widely disparate conclusions [[4]; see also reference [5] for review]. The underlying factors responsible
for this discord are unclear; but from the beginning,
researchers have repeatedly voiced concerns that at least
some accounts of PCR-positive results are attributable
to the inadvertent contamination of human specimens
or reagents with mouse DNA. These concerns were
revisited following a recent report by Lo et al. that
described the existence of sequences closely related to
polytropic and modified-polytropic murine leukemia
viruses (MLVs)–but not XMRV–in blood samples from
CFS patients [6]. Such skepticism is justified by previous
examples of alleged human retroviruses that later turned
out to be laboratory artifacts [7].

Evidence for contamination of human samples
With this history in mind, four independent studies
published this week in Retrovirology reinforce the need
to take extreme precautions in excluding mouse DNA
contamination. Robinson et al. [8] performed a PCR
analysis of 437 prostate tissue specimens from patients
in the United Kingdom (UK), Thailand and Korea using
primers that targeted the 5’-leader region of XMRV gag.
Initial PCR results showed that 14 of 292 samples from
the UK contained XMRV or MLV-related sequences.
However, 78 of the UK samples, including all 14
XMRV/MLV-positive specimens, contained amplifiable
levels of LTR sequences from intercisternal A-type

particles (IAPs), a class of endogenous retroelements
found in the mouse genome. Similarly, Oakes and colleagues [9] identified 2 of 112 blood samples from CFS
patients and 17 of 36 samples from healthy controls
that were PCR-positive for XMRV gag-leader DNA, but
later found that all of the XMRV-positive specimens
contained amplifiable levels of mouse mitochondrial or
IAP sequences. These data strongly suggest that the
XMRV sequences recovered by Robinson [8] and Oakes
[9] originated from mouse DNA that contaminated the
study samples prior to PCR.

Evidence for contamination of PCR reagents
A third report by Sato et al. [10] describes the detection
of MLV-encoding nucleic acids in PCR reagents
obtained from a commercial supplier (Invitrogen). Analyses of individual components from the PCR kit (SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum® Taq
High Fidelity) suggest that the mixture of reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase supplied by the
manufacturer was contaminated with MLV RNA. This
contamination likely originated from a monoclonal antibody preparation used in the polymerase mixture to
facilitate hot-start PCR.
Further details of the contamination found by Robinson [8], Oakes [9] and Sato [10] were obtained by
DNA sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified products.
All three studies identified sequences that that were
closely related to endogenous MLV. In particular,
Oakes and coworkers obtained a broad array of polytropic, modified-polytropic and xenotropic MLV-like
sequences [9], a result strikingly similar to the findings
of Lo et al. in their analysis of CFS patient samples
[6]. Both Oakes and Robinson also identified subsets of
amplicons that encoded a 24-nt gag-leader deletion
previously thought to be specific for XMRV (see
below). Collectively, these data show the ease with
which contamination can lead to false-positive MLV/
XMRV signals.
Phylogenetic support for contamination in
previous studies of XMRV
Finally, Hué and colleagues [11] present multiple lines
of evidence suggesting that contamination has occurred
repeatedly in previous studies of XMRV. The authors
begin by showing that the 24-nt gag-leader deletion is
not unique to XMRV; PCR primers targeting the deletion readily amplified endogenous MLV sequences from
12 different inbred and wild-derived mouse strains commonly used in laboratory experiments, as well as MLV
sequences present in 5 of 411 human tumor cell lines.
The latter result is consistent with previous reports of
xenotropic MLV contamination in human cell cultures
[[11] and references therein].

Next, Hué et al. PCR-amplified, cloned and sequenced
XMRV gag, pol and env segments from 22Rv1 prostate
carcinoma cells, an immortalized line known to harbor
multiple integrated copies of the virus. Remarkably, the
22Rv1 sequences displayed average pairwise genetic distances that equaled or exceeded those of previouslypublished XMRV sequences from prostate cancer [1]
and CSF patients [3], despite the fact that these patients
were from epidemiologically unlinked cohorts. In addition, phylogenetic analyses of the 22Rv1 and patientderived XMRV sequences strongly suggest that the
patient sequences obtained to date [1,3] originated from
one or more XMRV proviruses present in the 22Rv1
cell line [11].

Conclusions
The reports discussed above [8-11] collectively identify
three potential sources of contamination in PCR-based
studies of XMRV: (i) MLV-encoding nucleic acids present in commercial PCR reagents, (ii) trace amounts of
mouse genomic DNA in human blood and tissue samples, and (iii) DNA or RNA from human tumor cell
lines infected with XMRV or other closely-related gammaretroviruses. PCR testing for IAP sequences [8,9]
should prove useful in further studies of XMRV, as well
as other candidate human retroviruses, in which the
confounding effects of mouse DNA contamination must
be minimized. However, the findings of Hué et al.
clearly show that contamination cannot be assessed by
PCR testing for mouse DNA alone, since several human
cell lines harbor xenotropic MLVs that are closely
related to XMRV [11]. Additional findings from the Hué
study suggest that previously-published XMRV
sequences [1,3] were derived from copies of the virus
present in 22Rv1 cells, which likely acquired XMRV
during xenografting of the tumor cells in athymic mice
[[11] and references therein]. Collectively, these results
cast serious doubts on the PCR evidence used to support claims of MLV-related viruses in prostate cancer
and CFS patients. Future assessments of the prevalence
of XMRV should include more rigorous PCR and phylogenetic tests to exclude the possibility of contamination.
