Abstract
Background: Bacterial plant pathogens belonging to the Xanthomonas genus are tightly adapted to their host
plants and are not known to colonise other environments. The host range of each strain is usually restricted to a
few host plant species. Bacterial strains responsible for the same type of symptoms on the same host range cluster
in a pathovar. The phyllosphere is a highly stressful environment, but it provides a selective habitat and a source of
substrates for these bacteria. Xanthomonads colonise host phylloplane before entering leaf tissues and engaging in
an invasive pathogenic phase. Hence, these bacteria are likely to have evolved strategies to adapt to life in this
environment. We hypothesised that determinants responsible for bacterial host adaptation are expressed starting
from the establishment of chemotactic attraction and adhesion on host tissue.
Results: We established the distribution of 70 genes coding sensors and adhesins in a large collection of
xanthomonad strains. These 173 strains belong to different pathovars of Xanthomonas spp and display different
host ranges. Candidate genes are involved in chemotactic attraction (25 genes), chemical environment sensing (35
genes), and adhesion (10 genes). Our study revealed that candidate gene repertoires comprised core and variable
gene suites that likely have distinct roles in host adaptation. Most pathovars were characterized by unique
repertoires of candidate genes, highlighting a correspondence between pathovar clustering and repertoires of
sensors and adhesins. To further challenge our hypothesis, we tested for molecular signatures of selection on
candidate genes extracted from sequenced genomes of strains belonging to different pathovars. We found strong
evidence of adaptive divergence acting on most candidate genes.
Conclusions: These data provide insight into the potential role played by sensors and adhesins in the adaptation
of xanthomonads to their host plants. The correspondence between repertoires of sensor and adhesin genes and
pathovars and the rapid evolution of sensors and adhesins shows that, for plant pathogenic xanthomonads, events
leading to host specificity may occur as early as chemotactic attraction by host and adhesion to tissues.

Background
Deciphering how bacteria adapt to their hosts helps
explain how they spread. Host specificity can be established by determining the genes coding virulence factors
that are not conserved among strains, which differ in
their host range [1]. Virulence-associated genes are
expressed during initial host colonisation, multiplication,
development of symptoms, and dispersal. Sarkar and

colleagues [1] and Hajri and associates [2] demonstrated
that canonical virulence factors such as type III effectors
(T3Es) play a critical role in host specificity. T3Es, however, are injected into plant host cells once bacteria
have already penetrated into host tissues [3]. Thus,
phases preceding infection could also be involved in
host specificity and therefore be under selective
pressures.
For bacteria to adapt specifically to their hosts, they
sense favourable environmental stimuli and then they
move toward favourable conditions [4,5]. Bacteria have
evolved receptors and sensors in their cell walls to
detect chemical and environmental signals such as the
presence of chemoattractants, chemorepellents, and

oxygen. They thereby integrate information on their biotic and abiotic environment [6]. Studies on Rhizobia
revealed the importance of sensors in the perception of
specific host signals early during symbiotic interaction
with legumes [7,8]. Similarly, Agrobacterium tumefaciens
and Ralstonia solanacearum specifically detect various
components from root exudates that attract them
toward their hosts [9,10].
Environmental signals are mainly detected by Methylaccepting Chemotaxis Proteins (MCPs) and Sensors of
Two-Component Regulatory System (STCRS). MCPs
are the principal components of the chemotaxis system
[4]. Detection of signals by these transmembrane chemoreceptors directs cell locomotion by regulating the
histidine kinase CheA, which in turn communicates the
information to the flagellar motor by phosphorylating
its cognate response regulator CheY [4,5]. Changes in
the direction or the speed of flagellar rotation modify
swimming behaviour, resulting in movement towards
higher gradients of attractants and away from high concentrations of repellents [11,12]. In Escherichia coli,
chemotaxis proteins cluster in membrane-associated
patches [13,14]. Interactions within patches contribute
to the notable features of this signalling system: high
sensitivity, wide dynamic range, signal integration,
memory, and adaptation [15]. Besides MCPs, bacteria
sense their nutritional environment through TonBDependent Transporters (TBDTs) [16]. A large proportion of TBDT genes are related to plant scavenging and
carbohydrate utilisation. TBDTs are over-represented in
various bacteria interacting with plants such as Xanthomonas spp. [17].
Adhesion to a surface is a prerequisite for aggregation
in a biofilm, which enhances the resistance of bacteria
to various biotic and abiotic stresses, favours the coordination of adapted responses to environmental changes,
and allows multiplication [18,19]. Sensing and adhesion
mechanisms are interconnected since biofilm formation
is regulated by a chemosensory system [20]. The adhesion step involves surface structures in a broad group of
fimbrial and nonfimbrial adhesins. The fimbrial proteins
include type IV pili (Tfp), which are polymeric assemblies of the protein pilin [21,22]. The nonfimbrial adhesins belong to the autotransporter family (e.g. XadA and
YadA proteins) [23,24] and to the two-partner secretion
system (e.g. FhaB and YapH proteins) [25].
Each plant pathogenic bacterium belonging to the
Xanthomonas genus is able to colonise a restricted variety of plant hosts and microniches. Xanthomonas are
exclusively plant-associated bacteria, mainly phyllosphere colonisers, and are not encountered in other
environments [26]. Globally, they infect a huge range of
economically important plants such as rice, banana,
citrus, bean, tomato, pepper, sugarcane, and wheat [26].

The large host range of the genus strikingly contrasts
with the typically narrow host range of individual strains
restricted to one or several species of a botanical family
[27]. Besides their very homogeneous phenotype,
xanthomonads differ mainly by their host specificity.
This is illustrated in the pathovar subspecific division,
which clusters bacterial strains causing similar symptoms on a same host range [28]. A few pathovars are
represented by polyphyletic genetic lineages i.e. pv. phaseoli [29] and pv. dieffenbachiae [30]. The two lineages
of the latter pathovar are pathogenic on different hosts
(Anturium and Dieffenbachia) and hence may be considered as separate pathovars [30].
The 12 available Xanthomonas genomes http://www.
genomesonline.org/ revealed a huge number of genes
encoding chemotactic sensors, systems sensing the
nutritional environment of the cell (MCPs, TBDTs and
STCRS), and attachment structures [17,31,32]. This
large number reflects a high degree of adaptability and
the presence of mechanisms and structures involved in
the exploration of the bacterial environment and adaptive colonisation. This led us to hypothesize that determinants responsible for bacterial host specificity are
expressed starting from the establishment of chemotactic attraction by host tissues and adhesion on phylloplane. Thus, characterizing repertoires of genes
encoding sensors and adhesins will provide information
about the interaction and the adaptation of bacteria to
their host plants. Here we characterized the distribution
of genes encoding MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesins
in a large collection of strains belonging to different
pathovars in several species of Xanthomonas. We also
tested for molecular signatures of selective pressures on
candidate genes. Two types of outcomes were expected:
(i) strong purifying selection acting on genes involved in
recognition of common structures of plant tissues and
(ii) adaptive divergence on genes coding for sensors and
adhesins used for colonisation of specific niches. We
identified a large variety of repertoires generally fitting
with the pathovar clustering. Adaptive divergence was
found to affect most candidate genes. These findings
provide insight on the evolutionary importance of chemotactic attraction and adhesion in the host specificity
of plant pathogenic bacteria.

Results
Identification and selection of genes

Based on data mining, we identified genes involved in
bacterial attraction, sensing, and adhesion to host. We
extracted sequences of genes from four complete genome sequences (X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (Xav)
strain 85-10, X. axonopodis pv. citri (Xac) strain 306, X.
campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) strain ATCC33913, and
X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strain KACC10331). These

four bacteria have different host ranges and are phylogenetically distant. First, a list containing 320 genes
involved in sensing, chemotaxis, motility, and adhesion
was established using BLAST analysis. This list includes
30 genes encoding MCPs, 17 genes encoding chemotactic protein, 34 genes encoding flagellar components, 31
genes involved in Tfp biogenesis, 10 genes encoding
nonfimbrial adhesins, 115 genes encoding TBDTs, and
83 genes encoding STCRS (See additional file 1: Table
A1 for the complete list of genes involved in sensing
and adhesion in xanthomonads). Second, for selection
detection analyses, we selected genes that were ubiquitous in the four genomes, for which polymorphism was
observed and that encodes proteins acting upstream in
regulation cascades. Hence, we selected 70 candidate
genes: 28 genes encoding TBDTs, 7 genes encoding
STCRS, 25 genes encoding MCPs, 2 genes encoding Tfp
sensors, 1 gene encoding Tfp assembly ATPase, and 7
genes encoding adhesins.
Characterization of repertoires of MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs,
and adhesins

We investigated the distribution of the 70 selected genes
in 173 strains belonging to different lineages in Xanthomonas spp. by PCR (See additional file 2: Table A2 for
the list of bacterial strains). Three independent PCR
reactions with two different sets of primers and three
DNA batches were used to monitor the presence of
genes in the strain collection. A gene was considered
absent when no signal was obtained. But with this
approach, one cannot rule out that some genes that we
considered as potentially absent may have undergone
several point mutations in the primer regions, which
could result in divergence sufficient to prevent amplification through several PCRs. Every PCR result on the
DNA of X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli GL fuscans strain
CFBP4834 was confirmed by BLAST analysis on the
draft genome sequence of this strain (our unpublished
data). No discrepancies were observed for this strain in
any of the 70 candidate genes.
MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesin repertoires contained three categories of genes based on their presence/absence (Figure 1): first, ubiquitous genes showing
a broad distribution among strains (e.g. XCV1940,
detected in all strains, and pilS, detected in most
strains); second, genes displaying a variable distribution
since they were not detected in several strains (e.g.
XCV1954 and XCV2103); third, genes found in only
one species (e.g. XAC3768 and xadA2, detected only in
X. axonopodis, and XCC0324 and XCC0276, found only
in X. campestris).
Most bacterial lineages in Xanthomonas spp. displayed
unique repertoires of MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesins (Figure 1). Our results showed that 28 of the 34

Page 3 of 12

pathovars and genetic lineages of Xanthomonas spp. had
distinct repertoires. In contrast, different pathovars may
display the same repertoire, as do pathovars alfalfae and
ricini, pathovars allii and citrumelo, and pathovars vignicola and genetic lineage GL2 of pathovar phaseoli. A
large variability in the number of genes constituting
repertoires was observed among pathovars with X. oryzae strains harbouring the smallest repertoires, whereas
strains of X. axonopodis pv. citri displayed the largest
repertoires.
Repertoires of MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesins
were almost identical within pathovars alfalfae, begoniae, malvacearum, manihotis, musacearum, and oryzae.
Regarding pathovar anacardii, strains isolated from
Mangifera indica (CFBP2913 and CFBP2914) displayed
repertoires that differed by three genes (XAC3050,
XCV3187 and fhaB) from the repertoires of the strains
isolated from Anacardium occidentale (CFBP7240,
CFBP7241, CFBP7242 and CFBP7243). The diversity
observed among repertoires in pathovar allii could not
be associated with either the genetic diversity or the
known host of isolation [33] (See additional file 2: Table
A2 for the list of host of isolation of each bacterial
strain).
Based on the presence/absence matrix, clustering of
strains from different pathovars could be linked in some
cases to the host plant (Figure 2). Strains that were
grouped were of the pathovar vignicola, which infect
Vigna unguiculata and V. sinensis, and strains of GL2 of
pathovar phaseoli, which infect Phaseolus vulgaris. The
hosts of isolation of these strains belong to the same
botanical family (Fabaceae) and are closely related [34].
Also clustered together were strains phylogenetically distant [30] and belonging to different species (CFBP5823
of X. axonopodis pv. vasculorum and CFBP5830,
CFBP5831, and CFBP1215 of X. vasicola pv. vasculorum) but isolated from the same host, Saccharum officinarum (Figure 2).
Positive selection acting on X. axonopodis and X.
campestris genes encoding MCPs and adhesins

The McDonald-Kreitman (MK) tests for adaptive divergence done on 24 candidate genes (MCPs, adhesins, and
Tfp sensors) and four housekeeping genes from three
sequenced strains of X. axonopodis and three of X. campestris revealed that 13 of the 24 candidate genes
showed robust signatures of adaptive divergence
(Figure 3 and see additional file 3: Table A3 for the
results of the MK tests). The four housekeeping genes
did not display any signal of positive selection after Bonferroni correction. Significant signatures of adaptation
were found in the divergence between X. axonopodis
and X. campestris sequences on 11 genes (7 MCPs, 2
adhesins, and 2 Tfp sensors) of the 24 for which analysis

Figure 1 Distribution of genes involved in sensing and adhesion among lineages of Xanthomonas spp. Black and white squares
represent the presence and the absence, respectively, of the corresponding gene in at least 80% of strains of a pathovar or a genetic lineage.
Grey squares indicate that the presence of the gene is variable among strains of the lineage. Thirty one repertoire types were identified on the
basis of the presence-absence of genes under study. At least three independent PCR reactions were performed to ascertain the presence/
absence of each gene. X. a.: X. axonopodis; X. v.: X. vasicola; X. c.: X. campestris and X. o.: X. oryzae.

was possible. Using XocBLS256 as an outgroup showed
that diversifying selection preferentially affected the X.
axonopodis clade.
Positive selection was also tested using the branch-site
model implemented in PAML within X. axonopodis on
candidate genes already tested with the MK test. The
branch-site model allows detecting selection at a few
codons (sites) on a specific lineage (branch). Strains of
different pathovars in X. axonopodis (strains Xav85-10,
Xac306 and XapCFBP4834) occupy distinct habitats,
exploit distinct niches, and cause different diseases on
different host-plants (Lycopersicon esculentum and Capsicum sp., Citrus sp. and Phaseolus vulgaris, respectively). We hypothesised that these strains representing
different pathovars would have undergone selection differently for correspondingly distinct adaptations. For
each gene, three tests were applied, each considering a
different foreground branch corresponding to each of
the three pathovars. Results revealed that sets of genes
under positive selection in Xav85-10, Xac306, and
XapCFBP4834 were distinct. Indeed in the case of
pathovar vesicatoria (Xav85-10), the set of genes under
selection included XCV1940 and XCV1942. Regarding
pathovar citri (Xac306), the set included XCV1702,
XCV1945, and xadA1. Finally, in pathovar phaseoli
(XapCFBP4834), positive selection was detected on

genes XCV1945 and XCV1951. Interestingly, XCV1945
was found to be under positive selection on both pathovars citri and phaseoli. However, Bayes Empirical Bayes
(BEB), which estimates the probabilities of each site on
the foreground branch evolving under positive selection,
identified different sites either in Xac306 or
XapCFBP4834 (Table 1). For each gene, from 1 to 10
sites were found under selection. Sixteen of the 22 sites
under selection were in conserved domains in the proteins (Table 1 and Figure 4).

Discussion
The early phases of host-colonisation are crucial for
pathogenic bacteria [35]. However, little is known
about the importance of early phases in determining
host-specificity for plant pathogenic bacteria. Emphasis
has been put on later phases of infection, as illustrated
by the demonstration of the role of T3Es in host-specificity [1,2,36]. Host-recognition can be considered the
first instance of host-pathogen interaction allowing
bacteria to colonise. The importance of chemotaxis in
plant-bacteria interactions has been clearly documented in some cases. For example the chemotactic
mutant Ralstonia solanacearum is unable to colonise
its host when inoculated into the soil, whereas it
remains fully pathogenic when infiltrated inside plant

Figure 3 MK test results for adaptive divergence on genes
involved in sensing and adhesion. Genes were extracted from
sequenced genomes of three strains of X. axonopodis (Xav85-10,
Xac306, and XapCFBP4838) and three strains of X. campestris
(XccATCC33913, Xcc8004, and XccB100). The ratios of replacement
and synonymous changes within a species were compared with the
ratios of replacement and synonymous changes fixed between the
species. Pooled refers to MK test done using both species, X.
axonopodis and X. campestris. Using X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 as
an outgroup served to ascertain which species has been affected by
positive selection. A sequential Bonferroni correction for multiple
tests was applied. Black squares correspond to high p values (p <
0.0034) and indicate robust evidence of positive selection before
and after correction. Grey triangles indicate signals of positive
selection, which are not considered after sequential Bonferroni
correction: dark-grey and light grey triangles indicate p values
ranging from 0.0034 to 0.01 and from 0.01 to 0.05, respectively.
White squares correspond to non-significant p values (p > 0.05) and
indicate no signal of positive selection. A non-available result (n.a)
means that the orthologous sequences were lacking on the
genome sequence. Lack of polymorphism did not allow test
computation (n.c).

tissues [10]. Thus evolutionary processes of host-specificity would also be driven by selective forces at the
very first steps of host-colonisation. Our data show
evidence of such adaptive processes for numerous
genes involved in chemotactic attraction, environment
sensing, and adhesion to surfaces. These mechanisms
precede the infection of a plant by xanthomonads. The
mechanisms facilitating plant penetration and thus
allowing infection are chemotaxis, aerotaxis, and fast
multiplication inside host tissue, which relies on
adhesion.
According to MK-tests results, many candidate genes
undergo positive selection during bacterial colonisation
on plant tissue. Of the 24 genes common among repertoires of the studied pathovars (vesicatoria, citri, and

phaseoli) of X. axonopodis and X. campestris pv. campestris, nearly half are subject to positive selection. This
proportion is almost equal among the two gene families
(MCPs and adhesins). The McDonald-Kreitman procedure tests for adaptive divergence between two species.
The test is known to be robust to non-equilibrium
demography [37,38] and to recombination [39]. Using a
small sample size would reduce the power of the test.
The lack of power to detect selection would increase the
risk of false negatives. Thus our results are conservative
and can not be interpreted as false positive. Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker [40] showed that about 50% of
amino-acid substitutions surveyed in the enteric bacterial genomes were subject to adaptive evolution. Thus
both recognition and adhesion should be considered as
selective steps for bacterial colonisation. To our knowledge this is the first report of positive selection acting
on MCPs in plant-pathogenic bacterium. Our results are
consistent with those of Chen et al. [41] and Petersen
et al. [42] showing that positive selection acts on genes

encoding surface structures of E. coli cell. These genes
encode regulators of LPS O-antigen chain length, putative adhesins that affect biofilm formation, ferrichromeiron receptors, two outer membrane porins, and more
[41,42]. In xanthomonads, the extracellular appendage
of the Hrp pilus evolved under the constraint of positive
selection likely to avoid recognition by plant defense
surveillance systems [43].
Most sites that were found under selection in candidate genes by PAML analysis were located in conserved
domains predicted to play a role in perception for
MCPs and in adhesion for XadA1. Indeed, the Tar
domain of chemoreceptors directly binds to aspartate
and related amino acids [44]. The Hep-Hag motif is
found in the passenger domain of adhesins [45]. This
domain is known to contribute to the binding activity of
invasins/agglutinins [23]. This result is another argument in favour of selection pressures acting on these

genes in link with the ecological behaviour of the
strains. Detection of positive selection using the branchsites model implemented in PAML has some power limitations especially if only three sequences are used. Our
results, however, should be considered conservative as
they reduced the number of false positives.
Many bacteria assemble multifunctional proteic structures on their surfaces that serve for adhesion. This feature might be an adaptation to different environmental
conditions and, in the case of pathogenic bacteria, to
different hosts or host tissues [46]. In fact, adhesins are
involved in various processes leading to host colonisation and transmission to seed by plant-pathogenic bacteria. For example, Tfp serves remarkably diverse
functions, including twitching motility, cell to cell adhesion, and thus microcolony and biofilm formation [21].
Tfp is an important virulence factor for vascular and
non vascular plant pathogens [47,48]. Moreover,

Mhedbi-Hajri et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:67
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/67

Darsonval and colleagues [48] showed that PilA is
involved not only in adhesion but also in transmission
to seed, and the mutation of pilA in strain CFBP4834 of
X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli GL fuscans leads to lower
pathogenicity on bean (P. vulgaris). Additionally, YapH,
an hemagglutinin, is required for adhesion to seed,
leaves, and abiotic surfaces.
An interesting consequence of strong differential
selection pressures by host is a specialisation at some
early steps (i.e. chemotactic attraction) of host colonisation by xanthomonads. Character displacement at early
stage of host colonisation should make infection more
efficient by preventing competition for habitat between
strains [49,50]. In fact, xanthomonads are known to be
phenotypically very homogeneous except in pathogenicity. Lack of selective pressures in host colonisation
would lead to colonisation by a wide range of incompatible strains. Colonisation of specialized pathovars would
therefore be less successful. Indeed, resource allocation
would be redirected in favour of competition detrimental to pathogenicity. Finally, such host-isolation could
act as an ecological isolating barrier to limit recombination between differentially adapted pathogenic strains.
As in eukaryotic organisms, ecological differences in
bacteria are known to promote speciation [51]. Indeed,
habitat sharing would allow recombination between
strains that belong to different pathovars and that consequently produce strains that may reveal genetic
incompatibilities.
This comparative analysis of repertoires of MCPs,
STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesins provides useful insight
into bacterial behaviour. First, the number of MCPs and
more generally sensors is higher in Xanthomonas strains
than in E. coli and Salmonella [52]. E. coli and Salmonella have only five MCPs whereas strains Xav85-10,
Xac306, and XccATCC339313 have about 20 MCPs;
strain XooKACC10331 has only about 10 MCPs. The
large numbers (14 in Xav85-10, 10 in Xac306, 8 in
XccATCC339313, and 7 in XooKACC10331) of MCPs
and other sensors repeated in tandem are unusual in
bacteria, suggesting a prominent role in the life style of
Xanthomonas [17,31,32]. Second, repertoires of MCPs,
STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesins differed among the majority of pathovars and genetic lineages belonging to the
tested Xanthomonas spp. and displaying different host
range. Repertoires of genes coding sensors and adhesins
comprised core and variable gene suites. Some genes
under study were not intra-specifically conserved and
hence belong to the accessory genome. Repertoires of
genes involved in attraction and adhesion may evolve by
gene gain or loss, probably after duplication events. In
the case of Drosophila, the size of repertoires of genes
encoding olfactory and gustatory receptors varies
through gene duplication, pseudogenization, and gene

Page 8 of 12

loss. The changes among species of Drosophila show
that these receptors have changed during species divergence, and their evolution might reflect species’ adaptation to their chemical environment [53]. Similarly, in
xanthomonads, the variable set of sensors and adhesins
may be involved in the recognition of specific components allowing strain adaptation to a particular set of
hosts. Moreover, we identified signals of adaptive divergence have been identified on such genes of the variable
set.
This study showed that among the same genus,
Xanthomonas, the majority of pathovars and genetic
lineages belonging to different species (X. axonopodis, X.
campestris, X. vasicola, and X. oryzae) displayed different and unique repertoires of MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs,
and adhesins while they displayed different host range.
Note that the distribution of sensor and adhesin genes
does not necessarily correlate with strain phylogeny.
Indeed, bacteria as phylogenetically distant as X. axonopodis pv. vasculorum and X. vasicola. pv. vasculorum
[30] share a common repertoire of sensor and adhesin
genes (Figure 2) and a common host: sugarcane. This
case illustrates the sharing of a common ecological
niche (symptomatic host) by two phylogenetically distant bacteria.
Our results suggest that adaptation to host involves
pathoadaptation but also asymptomatic colonisation
steps. Indeed, several pathovars and genetic lineages
shared the same repertoires whereas they are known to
infect different crops. This means that they could share
the same asymptomatic host range but develop symptoms on a restricted number of different host plants.
This is the case for the pathovar vignicola and the
genetic lineage GL2 of pathovar phaseoli. X. axonopodis
pv. phaseoli GL2 and pv. vignicola strains may detect
similar plant-originated molecules potentially conserved
among their host plants. This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli GL2 and vignicola both infect legumes. X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli
GL2 infects Phaseolus spp. and X. vignicola infects
Vigna unguiculata; these legumes belong to the Milletioid clade and are phylogenetically closely related [33].
Interestingly, cross inoculations would provide insight
on the ecological behaviours of these two pathogens
(survival, colonisation and chemotaxis responses). The
four genetic lineages (fuscans, GL1, GL2, GL3) of pathovar phaseoli, which all share a common host (P. vulgaris), present distinct repertoires of MCPs, STCRS,
TBDTs, and adhesins. Genetic lineage fuscans, GL2, and
GL3 are phylogenetically closely related and belong to
rep-PCR group 9.6 whereas GL1 is distant and belongs
to rep-PCR group 9.4 [2,30,54]. These four distinct
genetic lineages have different T3E repertoires but clustered together on the dendrogram constructed on the

Mhedbi-Hajri et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:67
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/67

matrix of presence/absence of T3Es genes, supporting
the hypothesis of an adaptive pathological convergence
on bean [2]. Our results suggest that, upstream of the
invasive pathological stage, the four genetic lineages
have different ecological behaviours. Colonisation does
not necessarily lead to infection and then may not be
under the same adaptive processes as host infection. We
can speculate that each lineage of X. axonopodis pv.
phaseoli can be found on different asymptomatic hosts.
Overall, our findings indicate that plant pathogenic
bacteria belonging to different pathovars have evolved
different set of genes allowing them to specifically detect
favourable hosts on which they can settle. These results
support a recent theory termed inverse-gene-for-gene in
which infectiousness is determined by pathogen recognition of hosts signals and/or receptors [55]. This theory
is an alternative to the gene-for-gene model in which
the pathogen is recognized by the host., Here, in agreement with this theory we show that many pathogen
genes involved in host recognition evolved under adaptive divergence. Such a selective pressure on genes
encoding for recognition of specific hosts strongly
accounts for coevolutionary dynamics where pathogens
are always adapting their sensors in response to hosts
changes in exudates and surface structures.
Plant pathogenic xanthomonads are associated with
aerial parts of plants. They are not usually encountered
in other environments. Plant pathogenic pseudomonads
colonise non-host habitats such as snow or water [56].
Our attempts to isolate xanthomonads from such environments were, however, unsuccessful (our unpublished
data). Saprophytic survival of xanthomonads in soil is
very poor. Apart from their primary host, many xanthomonads can survive for long periods in association with
weeds that grow naturally in crops. It is not yet known
which weeds are susceptible to colonisation by each
plant pathogenic xanthomonad. We refer in our study
to the main crop contaminated by each pathovar, which
certainly represents the major opportunity for bacterial
multiplication.

Conclusions
This study showed that the majority of the tested pathovars belonging to different species of Xanthomonas (X.
axonopodis, X. campestris, X. vasicola, and X. oryzae)
displayed unique repertoires of genes coding proteins
involved in sensing (MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs) and adhesion. Our data show evidence of adaptive processes for
numerous genes involved in chemotactic attraction,
environment sensing, and adhesion to surfaces. Most
sites that were found under selection in candidate genes
were located in conserved domains predicted to play a
role in perception or in adhesion. Xanthomonads are
plant-associated bacteria and are not known to

Page 9 of 12

efficiently colonise other environments. Hence, we argue
that the gene evolution we observed may reflect pathovar adaptation to the host-plant environment.
The molecular variation of genes involved in host
recognition and adhesion to host tissues clearly shows
adaptation begins at the very first steps of host colonisation. We suggest that such adaptive divergence at early
phases of host colonisation would act as an ecological
isolating barrier to promote speciation. However, such a
process could have appeared after isolation by genes
involved in infection, like T3Es. In this case, adaptation
would be a consequence rather than a cause. Despite
their high evolutionary relevance, the respective roles of
host recognition and host infection in promoting ecological reproductive barriers remain to be elucidated.

Methods
The xanthomonad strains used in this study were
named following the nomenclature proposed by Vauterin et al. [27,57] and are presented in Additional file
2. Genes encoding MCPs, STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesinrelated genes were selected from sequenced genomes of
Xav85-10, Xac306, XccATCC33913, and XooKACC10331 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. These genes
were identified according to their function-based assignment in the NCBI website to cell motily (COG N), signal transduction mechanisms (COG T), and inorganic
ion transport and metabolism (COG P) classes and
according to Thieme et al. [32] for fimbrial and nonfimbrial adhesin genes. Using Blastx analysis with default
parameters [58], we identified orthologous genes (more
than 80% identity on more than 80% of the length of
the sequence) in each of the four reference genomes.
Hence, a list containing 320 genes involved in sensing,
chemotaxis, motility, and adhesion was established (See
Additional file 1: Table A1). This list was refined by
analysing the functional-domain composition of the
genes. We selected genes encoding MCPs containing
periplasmic domains (e.g TAR, PRK09793, PAS and
HAMP domains). Regarding genes encoding TBDTs and
STCRS, we selected receptor and sensor parts, respectively, based on the gene description and gave priority
to genes identified in only one of the four sequenced
strains. We discarded genes that encoded cytoplasmic
proteins such as chemotactic proteins (CheA-Z) and
genes encoding flagellar components characterised by a
very low polymorphism of presence or absence and
sequence conservation.
Primer design was based on the alignment of orthologous sequences collected from the four genomes in conserved fragments, taking care to avoid amplification of
other genes that share domains with the target. Then,
sets of primers were validated both by in silico specific
gene amplifications (Amplify software version 3.1.4) and

Mhedbi-Hajri et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:67
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/67

by specific gene amplification using PCR with genomic
DNA extracted from the four sequenced genomes previously mentioned. PCR reactions were prepared as
described previously [2]). To characterise repertoires,
PCRs were performed using one set of extracted genomic
DNA (1 ng) and two sets of boiled bacterial cells (3 × 108
cfu ml-1) per strain. Preliminary dot blot hybridisations
were done to validate PCR results. We designed probes
for specific (XCC0324) and variable (XCV2103 and
XAC1816) genes. Hybridisations were performed as
described previously [2] on extracted DNA (250 ng) from
reference strains. Positive signals were obtained for all
strains, in contradiction with the results expected based
on bioinformatic analysis of presence/absence on the
sequenced-genomes from the same strains. These discrepancies can be explained by the structure of these modular genes, which share motifs in functional domains (e.g.
HAMP, hemagglutinin, or autotransporter domains) and
consequently have many sequence similarities. As dot
blot could not be used to confirm the absence of signal
we designed, whenever possible, another set of primers
for each non-ubiquitous gene. Generally, two sets of primers were used for each gene on three batches of DNA
(See Additional file 4: Table A4 for the sequences of primers). Finally, a fourth set for result validation was
obtained using the draft genome sequence of X. axonopodis pv. phaseoli GL fuscans strain CFBP4834 (our unpublished data). Every PCR result on the DNA of this strain
was confirmed by BLAST analysis [56].
Based on the presence/absence matrix of MCPs,
STCRS, TBDTs, and adhesin genes obtained by PCRs
for each of the 173 strains of Xanthomonas sp., we constructed a dendrogram using Euclidean distance and
Neighbour-Joining method, which was visualised using
PAST version 1.90 software [59].
Tests for positive selection were performed on orthologous sequences collected from the genome sequences of
Xav85-10, Xac306 and XapCFBP4834, XccATCC33913,
Xcc8004 and XccB100, and XocBLS256. Twenty four candidate genes, including 19 MCPs genes and 5 adhesinrelated genes, were analysed together with 4 housekeeping genes. The nucleotide sequences were aligned using
ClustalW [60] according to the translated amino-acid
alignment in order to keep the codon structure of the
coding sequences. Adjustments on multiple alignments
were manually performed using BIOEDIT version 7.0.9.0
program [61]. Annotation of domains was performed by
using the Conserved Domain Database available [62] in
NCBI web site. The DNASP software package [63] was
used to perform several tests for positive selection using
the MK test [64]. The MK test is a simple method to
contrast the patterns of within-species polymorphism
and between-species divergence at synonymous and nonsynonymous (replacement) sites in the encoding region

Page 10 of 12

of a gene. The MK test evaluates whether an excess of
replacement mutations versus synonymous mutations
had been fixed between the two species compared with
replacement and synonymous polymorphisms within
each species. A significant ratio of fixed replacement to
fixed synonymous mutations leads to rejecting the neutral mutation hypothesis and indicates adaptive fixation
of selectively advantageous mutations. Three MK test
conditions were applied (i) to detect adaptive divergence
signals between two species (X. axonopodis vs X. campestris) and (ii) to ascertain which species has been affected
by positive selection by assigning the fixed replacement
changes to X. axonopodis and/or X. campestris using X.
oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) strain BLS256 as outgroup
strain. The significance of MK results was established by
the Fisher exact test. Bonferroni correction for multiple
tests [65] was hand-computed and applied on MK test
results. Testing for positive selection acting at a specific
locus on a particular pathovar (i.e. branch) was performed using the branch-site model A of Yang and Nielsen [66] implemented in the CODEML program of the
PAML package (version 3.14) [66,67]. Testing was performed on each gene previously analysed for adaptive
divergence. Three sequenced-genome strains of different
pathovars in X. axonopodis (pvs. vesicatoria, citri, and
phaseoli) were used. For each gene, three tests were done
by labelling one branch as foreground at a time. Model
selection was performed using likelihood ratio test. In
contrast to other methods of selection detection, the
Branch-site model allows for small numbers of taxa.
