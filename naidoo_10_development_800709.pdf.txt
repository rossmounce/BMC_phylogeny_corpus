Abstract
Background: The ability of the Y chromosome to retain a record of its evolution has seen it become an essential
tool of molecular anthropology. In the last few years, however, it has also found use in forensic genetics, providing
information on the geographic origin of individuals. This has been aided by the development of efficient screening
methods and an increased knowledge of geographic distribution. In this study, we describe the development of
single base extension assays used to resolve 61 Y chromosome haplogroups, mainly within haplogroups A, B and
E, found in Africa.
Results: Seven multiplex assays, which incorporated 60 Y chromosome markers, were developed. These resolved Y
chromosomes to 61 terminal branches of the major African haplogroups A, B and E, while also including a few
Eurasian haplogroups found occasionally in African males. Following its validation, the assays were used to screen
683 individuals from Southern Africa, including south eastern Bantu speakers (BAN), Khoe-San (KS) and South
African Whites (SAW). Of the 61 haplogroups that the assays collectively resolved, 26 were found in the 683
samples. While haplogroup sharing was common between the BAN and KS, the frequencies of these haplogroups
varied appreciably. Both groups showed low levels of assimilation of Eurasian haplogroups and only two
individuals in the SAW clearly had Y chromosomes of African ancestry.
Conclusions: The use of these single base extension assays in screening increased haplogroup resolution and
sampling throughput, while saving time and DNA. Their use, together with the screening of short tandem repeat
markers would considerably improve resolution, thus refining the geographic ancestry of individuals.

Background
The Y chromosome has demonstrated its utility, for a
number of years, in shedding light on human history
and identifying population affinities. Given that human
genome variation evolves over time due to several factors - among them mutation, genetic drift, migration
and selection - the genome has retained some of the
record of these historical and evolutionary events. This
record is more easily read from the Y chromosome due
to the lack of recombination along most of its length
and a strict paternal mode of transmission. Consequently, the Y chromosome has become a marker of the

male contribution to the shaping of human populations
and their histories.
A standard nomenclature established by the Y Chromosome Consortium [1] resolved the global pattern of
Y chromosome variation into 18 major haplogroups that
were classified using capital letters A through to R. This
has recently been revised by Karafet et al. [2] to a Y
chromosome haplogroup phylogeny that contains 311
branches delineated by approximately 600 markers
(primarily bi-allelic) and includes an additional two haplogroups (S and T), increasing the major haplogroup
number to 20. The frequency and distribution of these
haplogroups shows good concordance with the geographic distribution of populations. This, together with
high levels of population differentiation, [3] have added

value to the Y chromosome as a tool for reconstructing
the history and migrations of humans over time.
While Y chromosome short tandem repeats (STRs)
are now used routinely in forensic analysis [4], the use
of bi-allelic markers - mainly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - which designate Y chromosome
haplogroups, is advancing steadily due to their ability to
provide information on the geographic origin of individuals. Their use, however, is hindered by the paucity of
simple screening methods and insufficient knowledge of
their global distribution. However, this has improved in
recent years [5]
A number of assays for the rapid screening of Y chromosome haplogroups have been developed [6-9]. These
were targeted primarily at resolving the major haplogroups found in European populations. While these
studies have included in their assays a few SNPs to
resolve the major Y chromosome haplogroups commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa, they do not contain
the markers needed to resolve the majority of terminal
branches of the Y chromosome phylogeny that exist
among African populations.
In the present study, we report on the development of
single base extension (SBE) assays used to refine the
resolution of Y chromosome haplogroups commonly
found in Africa, having also incorporated a few SNPs to
delineate the common non-African Y chromosomes following a hierarchical screening process. SBE, due to its
convenience and relative affordability, is now used in
many genetic and forensic applications. Following the
validation of the assays, we applied these methods in
order to resolve the Y chromosome haplogroups in 683
male subjects, primarily from southern Africa. Haplogroup frequencies for the populations analysed were
then calculated.

Results and discussion
SNP selection and screening strategy

Seven multiplex SBE assays, which incorporated 60 Y
chromosome markers described in the YCC Phylogeny
2003 [10], were developed which resolved 61 Y chromosome haplogroups. The first multiplex, YSNP1, consisted
of the markers SRY10831, M168, M89, M201, M69,
M170, M172, M9, M207, M198 and M343 (Figure 1a).
YSNP1 resolved Y chromosomes into either the African
haplogroups (A, B or E) or Eurasian haplogroups found
occasionally in African males [unpublished restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data]. Note: the
marker, SRY10831, initially resolves haplogroup BR,
while its reversion is used to define haplogroup R1a.
Any sample found to harbour the ancestral state at all
markers within YSNP1 was screened using the multiplex
assay, Hg-A. This multiplex consisted of the markers,
M91, M31, M14, M114, P28, M28, M51, M13, M171

Page 2 of 11

and M118 (Figure 1b) and was used to resolve the subclades of haplogroup A. Samples found to be derived at
SRY10831, but ancestral at all other markers within
YSNP1, were screened using the multiplex assay, Hg-B.
This multiplex consisted of M60, M146, M182, M150,
M152, M108, M43 and M112 (Figure 1c) and resolved
the sub-clades of haplogroup B. Those samples with the
derived allele at M112 were screened further, using the
multiplex assay, Hg-B2b, which contained the markers
P6, M115, M30, P7, P8 and M211 (Figure 1d), providing
resolution of haplogroup B2b samples to the terminal
branches of the phylogeny. While M108 recurs in haplogroup B2b resolving haplogroup B2b3a, its presence in
the Hg-B multiplex assay should be sufficient to resolve
both its occurrences in haplogroup B, thus negating the
need to include it in the Hg-B2b assay.
Those samples found to be derived at SRY10831 and
M168, while remaining ancestral at all other markers
within YSNP1, could be assigned to haplogroups C, D
or E. These samples were then screened using the Hg-E
multiplex assay, which consisted of M40, M33, M44,
M75, M41, M85, P2, M2 and M35 (Figure 1e). Samples
found to be derived for M2 or M35 would fall into
haplogroups E1b1a or E1b1b1, respectively. E1b1a Y
chromosomes were further resolved using the assay, HgE1b1a; a multiplex comprised of the markers M58,
M116, M149, M154, M155, M10 and M191 (Figure 1f).
Those Y chromosomes assigned to haplogroup E1b1b1
were screened further using the multiplex assay, HgE1b1b1, which consisted of the markers M78, M148,
M81, M107, M165, M123, M34, M136 and M281 (Figure 1g). When a sample was found to be ancestral for
the M40 polymorphism, it was screened for the mutations that defined haplogroups C (M130) and D (M174)
separately. This hierarchical screening approach facilitated the resolution of the relevant haplogroup in an
individual after one, two, or at most, three reactions,
depending on the haplogroup present.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) optimization

While PCR primer concentrations were initially 0.02 μM
- 0.04 μM, these were increased or decreased incrementally in order to obtain a relatively equal amplification of
amplicons in the multiplex PCR (see Table 1). The marker P28, in the Hg-A assay, initially experienced low
amplification after multiplexing. This was rectified by
increasing the final concentration of the P28 PCR primers to 0.2 μM, and decreasing the buffer concentration
to 0.8×. The annealing temperature was also optimized
in order to ensure maximum product yield and to minimize the formation of spurious products. A spurious
amplification product was found to occur in the HgE1b1b1 assay which was eliminated by increasing the
annealing temperature to 61°C.

Again, a single amplicon was used for these SNPs, but in different assays.

SBE optimization

The SBE primers designed for the seven SBE assays,
ranging from 25 to 80 bases in length, were designed to
differ by four to five bases within each assay (see Table
2). This was not always reflected in the electropherogram, with a lack of uniform separation in most of the
assays. This resulted in a few extension products (for
example, M85 and P2 in Hg-E, M168 and M89 in HgYSNP1) co-migrating (see Figure 1). Fortunately, this
did not interfere with the interpretation of results. The
estimated lengths of extension products in the electropherogram (based on mobility) differed from the
designed lengths, on average by four bases. This difference was ascribed to the migration rate of the primer
(which was influenced by its actual length), possible secondary structure [11], mobility of the dye attached [12]
and the use of POP-7® polymer. This was especially
apparent for the M91 primer, a 25-base primer which
sized, on average, 11 bases larger. Despite these observations, profiles generated by all the assays were usually
easily interpreted.
While the generation of aspecific peaks did occur occasionally, this was usually due to insufficient purification
of the PCR products resulting in the incorporation of
the PCR primers or deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates
(dNTPs) into the SBE reaction. The presence of one
permanent aspecific peak did occur, however, in the HgB2b assay (a red peak between the P8 and M211 peaks).
This peak seemed to be linked to the P7 primer, perhaps due to a problem during its synthesis, and was
usually more visible when overall peak height was
decreased.

In order to intensify peak heights, the number of
cycles in the SBE reaction program was increased from
25 to 35. While overall peak height improved, variability
of peak heights within some assays was unavoidable,
despite the adjustment of relative SBE primer concentrations. This was possibly influenced by the efficiency of
interaction between SBE primers and template
sequences.
Validation of SBE assays

The seven SBE assays were validated using samples
whose haplogroup status was previously determined. A
total of 683 samples were then screened. Additionally,
sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of
alleles for 15 mutations not screened for before the use
of these SBE assays. These included M14, M114, M152,
P6, P7, P8, M33, M44, M85, M58, M154, M34, M201,
M198 and M343.
The marker M91, in the Hg-A assay, is a homopolymer length variant associated with a single base deletion
in a poly-T tract [13]. While the use of SBE in the
screening of homopolymer variants is not common, the
detection of the M91 mutation using the SBE method
was successful. This was reaffirmed phylogenetically
[14,15] by the presence of this mutation exclusively in
samples belonging to subclades of haplogroup A.
The validation process resulted in the redesign of just
two SBE primers, P28 and M35. The initial P28 SBE primer did not pick up the mutation, probably due to nonspecific primer binding, while the initial M35 primer
resulted in an extremely low peak height when the
mutation was present. This was possibly due to the

preferential amplification of the ancestral allele, or a
lower efficiency of binding by the original SBE primer.
Finally, in haplogroups B2b4* and B2b4b, P7 showed
the presence of two different extension products, displaying both the ancestral and derived states, simultaneously. This also occurred in haplogroup B2b4a, with
P8, additionally, exhibiting the same property. The presence of both states was confirmed when sequencing
was performed. Thus, it is likely that all samples in haplogroups B2b4*, B2b4a and B2b4b will display two peaks
at the relevant markers. This was, probably, a consequence of these markers being located within paralogous
sequence variants [16]. It should be noted that such
mutations are more susceptible to back-mutation
through gene conversion, as it was with P25 [17]. For
this reason, more stable markers that resolve these subclades of B2b4 would be preferable.
Haplogroup assignment using SBE assays

The sample of 683 males screened using the seven SBE
assays was assigned to 26 of the 61 haplogroups that the
assays collectively resolved (see Table 3 and Figure 2).
The subclades of haplogroup A were found most commonly in the KS, at a frequency of 44.3%. Haplogroup
A3b1 was the commonest (28.4%) and was also found to
be present in the BAN at low levels (5.0%). The haplogroups A2*, A2a and A2b were found to be unique to
the KS at frequencies of 2.7%, 4.4% and 8.7%, respectively. Haplogroup B was present at moderate frequencies
in both the KS and the BAN. Its subclades, however, displayed differing distributions, with haplogroup B2a1a
occurring at a substantially higher frequency in the BAN
(16.0%) than in the KS (0.5%). The situation was reversed
with regard to haplogroup B2b, with its subclades

together constituting 10.9% of KS individuals, as compared to 0.3% in the BAN. Haplogroup E was the most
common haplogroup in the BAN group (78.1%), with its
subclades E1b1a* and E1b1a7 occurring at frequencies of
34.1% and 25.9%, respectively. While both these haplogroups occurred in the KS at 13.1% and 7.7%, respectively, the most frequent E subclade amongst the KS was
E1b1b1* (15.8%). Haplogroups E2* and E2b1 were found
at much higher frequencies (10.2% versus 1.6%) in the
BAN compared with the KS. The haplogroups shared
between the BAN and KS, described above, showed
extremely significant differences in frequency between
the two groups (Fisher’s exact test: P < 0.0001; for haplogroup E2: P = 0.0001). Both the KS and the BAN
showed low levels (3.3% and 0.6%, respectively) of assimilation of the Eurasian Y chromosome haplogroups I, K*
(x R), R1a1, and R1b.
Y chromosomes in the SAW sample were resolved into
macro-haplogroup F (89.2%) of which haplogroup R
(58.0%) and haplogroup I (17.8%) together accounted
for 75.8%. Haplogroup E comprised the rest of the SAW
at 10.8%, with its subclade E1b1b1a found at a frequency of 7.6%. These low to moderate levels of E1b1b1
illustrate the spread of the haplogroup and its subclades
into southern Europe and the Middle East, where they
are often found. Only two SAW samples, however,
clearly belonged to African haplogroups (E1a1 and
E1b1a*).
The haplogroup distributions and their relative frequencies in the BAN and the KS were consistent with
previous studies which included these populations
[18-20], while those of the SAW were found to correlate
strongly with the Western European populations from
which the majority are derived [21].

Included in the frequencies of haplogroups F* and K* are those lineages not included in the SBE assays, but typed using PCR or RFLP assays, namely P12F2 and
M70.

Conclusions
Seven SBE assays containing 60 SNP markers were
designed, which allowed for the rapid assignment of
samples to Y chromosome haplogroups, more especially those belonging to the major African haplogroups A, B and E. The assays were designed based
on markers found in the YCC phylogeny 2003 [10].
Since then many more markers have been discovered
that have further resolved the phylogeny [2]. If
needed, these new markers could be incorporated
into the current SBE assays, thereby increasing resolution. The use of the current SBE assays in screening
Y chromosomes, however, has still resulted in
increased haplogroup resolution and sample throughput, and at the same time was quicker and made use
of less DNA.
Based on the abovementioned haplogroup frequencies, the KS and the BAN populations are discernable
from each other with the KS exhibiting significantly

higher frequencies of haplogroups A2, A3b1, B2b and
E1b1b1. However, the BAN are identifiable by the
strong presence of haplogroups B1a1a, E1b1a and E2.
The SAW were appreciably different from both the KS
and BAN. There were, however, considerable levels of
admixture between the populations (especially the KS
and BAN) due to their history of interaction. Consequently, while the elucidation of Y chromosome haplogroups is useful in African populations for both
anthropological and forensic purposes, their use
together with Y chromosome STR screening would
considerably improve resolution and thus refine an
individual’s geographic ancestry.

Methods
DNA samples

DNA samples from 683 individuals with diverse ethnic
backgrounds were analysed in the present study. All
DNA samples were collected with the subjects’ informed

consent, and this research was approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committee (Medical) at the University
of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (Protocol No.
M050906). The sample included 383 south eastern
Bantu speakers (BAN), 183 Khoe-San (KS) and 157
South African Whites (SAW).
DNA extraction

DNA from EDTA-blood was extracted using the saltingout method described by Miller et al. [22] and the Gentra Puregene Buccal Cell Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was
used to extract DNA from buccal swabs according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was quantified
using the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (LabVIEW®, Coleman Technologies Inc, FL, USA) and
diluted to 10 ng/μL using double distilled water.

Roche from Metabion (Martinsried, Germany), diluted
to 100 μM and frozen.
PCR primer lengths ranged from 20 to 27 mers and
GC percentage varied between 30% and 60%. Amplicons
were designed to differ slightly in size in order to distinguish them following agarose gel electrophoresis to
check the success of the PCR. In total, 53 pairs of PCR
primers were designed encompassing all 60 SNPs (see
Table 1). Fewer pairs of primers were needed, as some
SNPs were co-amplified on the same amplicons (M13
and M14; M40 and M41; M58 and M155; M123 and
M281; M81 and M154; M85, M148 and M149).
Poly-C or Poly-GACT tails of differing lengths were
added to the 5’ end of most SBE primers (Table 2), so
as to differentiate between them during capillary electrophoresis. SBE primer lengths ranged from 25 to 80 mers,
and differed in size from each other by 4-5 mers.

Primer design

The sequences of the regions encompassing the polymorphisms were taken from GenBank. The PCR and
SBE primers were designed using Primer3 software [23],
before aligning them to human genomic sequences
using the National Center for Biotechnology Information basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) in order
to confirm template specificity. The screening software,
AutoDimer [24] was used to check for primer-dimer
and hairpin loop formation. High-performance liquid
chromatography-purified primers were purchased via

Multiplex PCRs

Primer design was verified by performing simplex PCR,
using a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems,
CA, USA), for each of the primer pairs. Thereafter, the
multiplex PCRs were optimized to work with DNA at a
concentration of 10 ng/μl (see Table 4), and were catalysed
using FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Relative primer concentrations were adjusted in
order to obtain balanced amplification of amplicons within
each multiplex. The thermal cycler programmes were as

30 s, 54°C (for YSNP1), 55°C (for Hg-A, Hg-B, Hg-B2b,
Hg-E and Hg-E1b1a) or 61°C (for Hg-E1b1b1) for 30 s,
extending at 72°C for 30 s and a final extension of 72°C
for 10 min. Following the optimization procedures, all
multiplex PCRs produced the required amplification products at adequate yields. This was confirmed by running 5
μL of multiplex PCR product on a 2% Metaphore® agarose
gel (Cambrex, NJ, USA).
Multiplex SBE

Excess PCR primers and dNTPs were eliminated from
the PCR product mixture, following amplification, using
an enzymatic purification method. One unit of Exonuclease I (Exo I) and 0.5 units of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) were added to 5 μL of amplification
product and the resultant mixture incubated for 1 h at
37°C, followed by 15 min at 75°C.
The multiplex SBE reactions were performed in a final
volume of 5 μL, comprised of 1.5 μL purified amplification
product, 1.5 μL of double distilled water, 1 μL of SNaPshot
Multiplex Ready Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1
μL of SBE primer mix, specific to the assay being conducted (see Table 2 for final primer concentrations). The
thermal cycler programme was as follows: 96°C for 10 s,
50°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s for 35 cycles.
Following the SBE reaction, excess dideoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) were removed through the
addition of 0.5 U of SAP to the 5 μL SBE product. The

mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C, followed by 15
min at 75°C.
Capillary electrophoresis

Following post-extension treatment, 2 μL of SBE product was mixed with 0.5 μL of the internal size standard, GS120LIZ (Applied Biosystems) and 7.5 μL Hi-Di
formamide (Applied Biosystems). This was then run on
a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The
SNaPshot protocol was originally optimized for use with
POP-4 polymer; modifications recommended by Applied
Biosystems were incorporated for use of the POP-7
polymer (Applied Biosystems Manual P/N: 4367258).
The resultant electropherograms (Figure 1) were analysed using GeneMapperID v3.2 software (Applied
Biosystems).
Assay validations

Some of the markers used in the SBE assays were validated using a set of control samples, previously screened
using RFLP assays. Those markers for which samples of
known haplogroup were unavailable were sequenced in
order to confirm the presence of the polymorphism.
After the screening of the 683 samples, Fisher’s exact
tests were performed using GraphPad InStat version
3.10 32 bit for Windows (GraphPad Software, CA, USA,
http://www.graphpad.com), in order to test significance
of differences in haplogroup frequency between the
BAN and KS.
