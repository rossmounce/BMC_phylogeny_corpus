Abstract
Background: All the reports on insect small RNAs come from holometabolous insects whose
genome sequence data are available. Therefore, study of hemimetabolous insect small RNAs could
provide more insights into evolution and function of small RNAs in insects. The locust is an
important, economically harmful hemimetabolous insect. Its phase changes, as a phenotypic
plasticity, result from differential gene expression potentially regulated at both the posttranscriptional level, mediated by small RNAs, and the transcriptional level.
Results: Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we characterize the small RNA transcriptome
in the locust. We identified 50 conserved microRNA families by similarity searching against
miRBase, and a maximum of 185 potential locust-specific microRNA family candidates were
identified using our newly developed method independent of locust genome sequence. We also
demonstrate conservation of microRNA*, and evolutionary analysis of locust microRNAs indicates
that the generation of miRNAs in locusts is concentrated along three phylogenetic tree branches:
bilaterians, coelomates, and insects. Our study identified thousands of endogenous small interfering
RNAs, some of which were of transposon origin, and also detected many Piwi-interacting RNAlike small RNAs. Comparison of small RNA expression patterns of the two phases showed that
longer small RNAs were expressed more abundantly in the solitary phase and that each category
of small RNAs exhibited different expression profiles between the two phases.
Conclusions: The abundance of small RNAs in the locust might indicate a long evolutionary
history of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, and differential expression of small
RNAs between the two phases might further disclose the molecular mechanism of phase changes.

Background

Regulation of gene expression can occur at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In recent years, the discovery of numerous small RNAs has increased interest in
post-transcriptional gene expression regulation during devel-

opment and other biological processes. Small RNAs include
several kinds of short non-coding RNAs, such as microRNA
(miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), and Piwi-associated RNA (piRNA), which all regulate gene expression at the
post-transcriptional level. Typically, miRNAs are approxi-

mately 22 nucleotide small-RNA sequences [1] that play key
roles in many diverse biological processes, including development, viral defense, metabolism, and apoptosis [2-5]. The
'seed' region, located at miRNA nucleotides 2-8 [6], is the
most important sequence for interaction with mRNA targets.
There are two other important non-coding RNAs: endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA) and piRNA. Endo-siRNA is
derived from double-stranded RNA to guide RNA interference. Much of the research on endo-siRNAs has been done in
plants [7], but recently endo-siRNAs derived from transposons and mRNAs in flies have also been identified [8].
These findings indicate that endo-siRNAs may play a broader
role in all organisms. A new class of small RNAs, piRNA, was
discovered two years ago. piRNAs, 23-30 nucleotides in
length, interact with PIWI proteins and repress the expression of selfish genetic elements, such as transposons, in the
germ line [9,10].
Insects comprise the largest group of metazoans, and previous studies have shown that small RNAs are involved in a significant number of biological processes in them [11]. Many
small RNAs have been identified in insects whose whole
genome sequences are available, including the fruit fly, bee,
mosquito, and silkworm. These insects are all holometabolous, meaning that they go through the complete four stages
of metamorphism. Another important group of insects are
hemimetabolous insects, which undergo an incomplete metamorphism, bypassing the pupa stage. In this group of
insects, no research on small RNAs has been carried out.
Studies on small RNAs in very different groups of insects are
important for understanding the evolution of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, and gaining specific information from the hemimetabolous group represents a unique
opportunity to examine species with an analogous, but modified, developmental process. Combined with the holometabolous group, the study of small RNAs in the hemimetabolous
group, including several ancient orders of insects, could aid in
understanding the whole picture of evolution and function of
small RNAs in insects.
The migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) is a typical hemimetabolous insect within the family Acrididae and is a worldwide, highly prevalent agricultural pest causing hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of damage every year. The locust has
also been used in research as a model organism for the study
of developmental, physiological, immune, and neural pathways, as well as others [12]. Additionally, as compared to the
fruit fly, the locust is a far more primitive insect, making it an
excellent model for studying evolution.
A great deal of work has been carried out specifically on the
ability of the locust to change phases from solitary to gregarious (in the latter phase, locusts form swarms that cause devastation of crops). Phase transition, as a phenotypic plasticity
in response to population density changes, is one of the most
interesting behavioral phenomena of the locust, and is linked

with changes in morphology, behavior, reproduction, endocrine balance, and disease resistance, all of which include
many changes at the molecular level that are potentially
involved in both transcriptional [13] and post-transcriptional
regulation of gene expression. Given that small RNAs are
known to be a key component in post-transcriptional gene
expression regulation in a variety of organisms, information
on the presence and activities of small RNAs in the locust
would be particularly useful. The locust, however, currently
lacks any substantial genome sequence data. Thus, the available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [13,14] provide the only
basis for small RNA annotation. It is possible to identify the
precursors of miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs via alignment
to ESTs [15,16]. The identification and comparison of small
RNAs in the gregarious and solitary phases can aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying their different biological processes, especially phase transition. Furthermore,
differences in small RNAs between the two phases might provide clues about how to control locust plagues throughout the
world by designing artificial siRNAs, thus saving a huge
number of crops every year.
For this study, because there is no whole genomic information available, we utilized the new high-throughput sequencing method (Illumina Genome Analyzer), instead of
computational approaches, to characterize locust small
RNAs, and developed a new method to predict locust-specific
miRNAs. We further compared the small RNA characteristics
and expression patterns between the gregarious and solitary
phases.

Results
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs
To survey small RNAs in the locust, we used Illumina
sequencing technology on libraries of small RNAs from the
gregarious and solitary phases [GEO:GSE12640]. We
obtained 1,566,242 reads from the gregarious library and
1,949,248 reads from the solitary library after discarding the
empty adapters. Generally, length distribution of small RNAs
in two phase libraries is different (Figure 1a; also see the section 'Different expression profiles of small RNAs in the two
phases' below). After discarding low-quality sequences,
sequences shorter than 18 nucleotides, and single-read
sequences, 895,554 and 1,377,859 reads, for the gregarious
and solitary phases, respectively, remained for analysis. After
comparing the small RNA sequences with the locust EST
database [13,14] as well as the Drosophila melanogaster
rRNA, tRNA and snoRNA database [17], sequences that came
from these types of RNAs (Figure 1b) were removed. The
remaining sequences were clustered based on sequence similarity because related sequences probably came from the
same precursor as cleavage by RNase III enzymes was imprecise. We determined that the sequence with the dominant
number of reads in a cluster was likely to be the real sequence

due to its relatively high expression level, and these sequence
clusters were further analyzed.

Conserved microRNAs
We identified 55 miRNA sequences, belonging to 50 families
(Table S1 in Additional data file 3), in the migratory locust by
BLAST against the miRBase v11.0 [18]. Most of the 50 miRNA
families share the same 'seed' regions (the 5' region important
for target recognition) [6] in the locust and other insects.
However, locust miR-10 and miR-79 (lmi-miR-10 and lmimiR-79) have very different 5' ends, thus changing their 'seed'
region, compared with miR-10 and miR-79 of the other four
insect species studied. For locust miR-79, the mature
sequence has an additional adenosine at the 5' end (Figure S1
in Additional data file 3), similar to that of the Caenorhabditis elegans miR-79 (cel-miR-79). Although in most cases the
key 'seed' site of the miRNA is nucleotides 2-8 [6,19], the 8mer seed site of D. melanogaster miR-79 (dme-miR-79) has
been validated as being at nucleotides 1-8 [6], which is the
same as locust miR-79 nucleotides 2-9. This indicates that the
additional adenosine at the 5' end of lmi-miR-79 possibly
does not lead to different targets in the locust and fly.
For lmi-miR-10, much like lmi-miR-79, the mature sequence
in the locust has an additional nucleotide at the 5' end, in this
case a uridine (Figure S1 in Additional data file 3), which is
the same as the miR-10 of non-insect organisms. Previous
studies have demonstrated that miR-10 in both species that
do and do not have an extra U have similar targets [20].
Although lmi-miR-79 and lmi-miR-10 of the locust have an
extra nucleotide at the 5' end compared to those of the fruit
fly, they still have the same 'seed' sequences, which may
potentially regulate similar targets.

Conservation of miRNA*
Although mature miRNA and miRNA* (the miRNA:miRNA*
duplex) are complementary, their base-pairing is imperfect in
the presence of compensatory substitutions (for example, CG to U-G), and the miRNA* is generally less stable than the
mature miRNA [21]. Analysis of miRNA and miRNA* species
in the miRNA database [18] indicated that miRNA* is less
conserved than miRNA (data not shown). However, we found
the homologs of several D. melanogaster miRNA* (miR-iab4, miR-8, miR-9a, miR-10, miR-210, miR-276, miR-281, and
miR-307; Table S2 in Additional data file 3) in the locust
library, indicating conservation of these miRNAs* between
the locust and the fruit fly.
To test whether the locust miRNA* and their corresponding
mature miRNA sequences came from the same precursors,
we used a PCR-based method to confirm the relationship
between the miRNA and its miRNA*. If the miRNA and its
miRNA* came from the same precursor, we should be able to
amplify 55-70 bp fragments from the genomic DNA. As
expected, we amplified 55-70 bp products from all the miRNAs with the exception of mir-iab-4 (Figure 2a), and the

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R6

Wei et al. R6.4

sequences of the PCR products confirmed the matches
between miRNAs* and mature miRNAs (Table S2 in Additional data file 3). We could not amplify the expected products
of mir-iab-4, although we repeatedly performed the PCR
experiments; the two sequences probably do not comprise the
canonical miRNA precursor in the locust.
We used the sequences of the amplified products of the conserved miRNA precursors to predict their secondary structure using mfold [22,23], and all seven sequences could be
properly folded into the typical hairpin structure (Figure 2c),
again indicating that the miRNA pairs came from the same
precursor and could properly fold into the pre-miRNA-like
hairpin for further processing. Taken together, these data
indicate that, in addition to conservation of mature miRNAs,
some of the locust miRNA* are also highly conserved in different lineages (Figure 2b). That the miRNA* are conserved
across several lineages indicates a possible role of miRNA* in
regulating gene expression, which was previously reported in
flies [24].
Since the locust and fruit fly separated about 350 million
years ago [25], it is striking that the 22-nucleotide miRNA*
has little sequence divergence between the two species. Moreover, in the case of lmi-mir-10, a greater number of reads
(two-fold more abundant) was generated by the star form.
For lmi-mir-8 and lmi-mir-276, thousands of their star reads
were presented in the library (Figure S2 in Additional data file
3). These findings also implicated a functional role of
miRNA* in regulating gene expression.

Identification of locust-specific miRNA families
In an attempt to discover locust-specific miRNA families, we
integrated the data from the locust small RNA libraries we
created with those of the locust EST database [13,14]. This,
however, did not provide any significant findings (see Materials and methods), likely because of the low coverage of the
locust EST database. Given that no methods were available to
identify locust lineage-specific miRNA families in the absence
of locust genomic information [26,27], we developed a new
method that is based on high-throughput sequencing but
does not require the presence of whole genome sequence data
(see Materials and methods).
We obtained 185 miRNA duplex-like pairs (Figure 3a; Table
S3 in Additional data file 3 shows the sequences with the
dominant reads, potential miRNA candidates, in the pairs). If
these pairs were true miRNA duplexes, 55-70 bp fragments
should be amplified from the locust genomic DNA using
primers designed according to the duplexes. To test the validity of our method to identify species-specific miRNAs, we
amplified corresponding fragments from locust genomic
DNA for 24 of our predicted candidate duplexes. Using this
method we obtained amplified fragments of expected length
from 13 out of the 24 candidates (Figure 3b and Table 1), indicating that about half of the predicted candidates may be

miRNAs make up a larger proportion of the locust small RNA
libraries (Figure 1b), indicating that miRNAs are the main
kind of small RNAs involved in gene expression regulation in
the locust. However, our libraries are made up of a mixture of
different tissue samples at different developmental stages, so
it is possible that the proportion of miRNAs to other small
RNAs could vary in different tissues or developmental stages.
Some of the miRNAs we identified had more than one thousand reads, while others had fewer than ten (Figure S2 in
Additional data file 3). Reads of the most abundant miRNAs
are about 10,000-fold higher than those of the scarce miRNAs. Such extreme variation can provide some basic insight
into the function of these miRNAs. The most abundant
miRNA is mir-1, which had approximately 163,143 reads in
the gregarious library and 135,794 in the solitary library. As a
muscle-specific miRNA [28], mir-1 is the most abundant
given its broad range of expression in different developmental stages and the high proportion of muscle tissues in the
locust. As with mir-1, the miRNAs that have more reads
should be expressed during most developmental stages, while
those having fewer reads, such as mir-210 and lmi-novel-01
(Figure S2 in Additional data file 3), should be expressed in a
much narrower range. It is likely that the expression of those
exiguous miRNAs is developmentally related.
As miRNA abundance is linked to the extent of conservation
[16,20], conserved miRNAs in the locust comprise more than
80% of the total miRNA reads we examined. The locust-specific miRNAs were expressed at a significantly lower level
than those in conserved families (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p
< 1.0 × 10-6).

Target prediction of miRNAs
In animals, although miRNAs have been shown to repress the
expression of their targets by binding to sequences in the 3'
untranslated region (UTR) in most cases [29,30], both computational and experimental evidence show the existence of
miRNA-binding sites in protein coding regions [31-34]. To
identify potential targets of locust miRNAs, we searched unigene sequences from locust ESTs using miRanda 3.1 [35]
because there is no 3' UTR database available (see Materials
and methods). We found 8,212 unigenes targeted by 157 miRNAs (50 conserved miRNAs plus 7 conserved miRNA* plus
the most abundant 100 locust-specific miRNA candidates
predicted). All miRNAs have more than one predicted target,
and some of the miRNAs even have more than 200 (Figure
4a). Similarly, some unigenes have more than one miRNA
target site (Figure 4a). On average, every miRNA targets 147.5
unigenes and, conversely, every unigene is targeted by 2.8
miRNAs. We think that the higher the score given by
miRanda, the more reliable the predicted results. The highest
score for predicted targets was for LM00689, which is a
potential target of lmi-miR-1 (Figure 4b). LM00689 is similar
to the ciboulot gene of fruit fly, which encodes an actin binding protein and plays a major role in axonal growth during
Drosophila brain metamorphosis [36].
We also found that some unigenes that had significant differences at the expression level between the gregarious and solitary phases were targeted by miRNAs. Although these genes
may be regulated at the transcriptional level, it is possible that
miRNAs play roles in regulating their expression. For example, microarray results in our lab show that the locust
homolog of the Drosophila gene pale has significant differences in its expression levels between the two phases (Z Ma et
al., unpublished). We found that the 3' UTR sequence of

locust pale contains a target site of lmi-miR-133 (we got the 3'

cDNA ends (RACE); see Materials and methods; Figure 4c).
We also found that in addition to the locust, 12 Drosophila
species also have conserved target sites of miR-133 in the 3'
UTR sequences of the pale gene [17,20,32] (Figure 4c), indicating the strong possibility of miR-133 regulating the expression of pale at the post-transcriptional level. Therefore, miR133 may contribute to the different expression of pale
between the gregarious and solitary phases (see Discussion).

The phylogenetic evolution of miRNAs
We sorted the 50 conserved families identified in the locust
into 4 groups based on their phylogenetic distribution (Figure
5a). Four families (let-7, mir-1, mir-34, and mir-124) are
present in insects, vertebrates, and nematodes; 17 families are
present in insects and vertebrates, but not nematodes; 6 families are restricted to invertebrates (insects and nematodes);
and the remaining 23 families are insect-specific.

Categorization of conserved miRNAs indicates that the innovation of miRNAs in the locust is concentrated along three
branches of the phylogenetic tree leading to bilaterians, coelomates, and insects. Different conserved miRNAs in the
locust have different ages. Some of them are from ancient
families (for example, mir-1) and some appear to be much
younger (for example, insect-specific miRNA families). Such
age differences indicate that there is an ongoing process of
miRNA evolution and it is possible that the insect lineage
gave birth to the insect-specific miRNAs. Previous work in
Drosophila has also indicated that the birth and death of

miRNA families is a common phenomenon in insect evolution [37].
Although the 50 miRNA families in the locust are highly conserved throughout widely divergent animal taxa, there are lineage-specific sequence substitutions in most of these families
that are present in both vertebrates and insects. Based on
their characteristic sequences in different lineages, we
divided these families into five categories (Table 2); in doing
this we disregarded the deletion of nucleotides at the end of
the miRNAs due to the inability to always accurately predict

Phylogenetic evolution of locust conserved miRNA families. (a) Phylogenetic distribution of 50 conserved miRNA families of the locust. A plus (+) symbol
indicates this miRNA family is found in the species named on the left, and a minus (-) symbol means it is absent in that species. A red plus symbol means
this miRNA family can not be found in any database, but was found by our search in the corresponding species genome. (b) An example of clade-specific
conserved miRNAs based on sequence substitutions. The red nucleotides indicate the positions that are the same among vertebrates but different from
insects, which are shown in green. Vertebrates and insects can be easily separated according to sequence differences in their miR-190, showing the
different sequence features of conserved miRNAs in different clades. The asterisks indicate the conserved sites among these species. (c) Two conserved
miRNA families whose sequences are unique in the locust (lmi). The red nucleotide shows the locust-specific position that is different from any other

the termini of mature miRNAs. If a miRNA family had more
than one of its members in certain species, we chose the member most similar to those in other species for use in categorizing because it may be an ancient member of the family.
Families in category I have identical sequences in all observed
species. Category II includes those families with small differences between invertebrates and vertebrates. Category III is
made up of miRNA families that have identical sequences in
all but one of the observed species. Category IV contains miRNAs with multiple variances in different lineages. Category V
contains only one miRNA family (mir-1), which is identical in
worms and vertebrates but not in insects.

We found that 26,519 reads matched the sense strand of ESTs
and 11,596 reads matched the antisense strand [13,14] in the
gregarious and solitary phase libraries. We classified the
small RNAs matching the antisense strand as candidate endosiRNAs (see Materials and methods; Additional data file 1).
The proportion of endo-siRNAs in the small RNA libraries of
locust is much lower than that of miRNAs (Figure 1b). However, because of incomplete mRNA sequence information in
the locust EST database, the actual number of endo-siRNAs is
likely to be higher. To gain greater understanding of the features of locust endo-siRNAs, we carried out additional analysis of these RNAs. Endo-siRNA length showed a major peak
at 22 nucleotides, the same as miRNAs (Figure 6a); however,
these small RNAs did not have a tendency to begin with
uracil, a common feature of miRNA (data not shown). This
provided additional evidence that these 22-nucleotide small
RNAs were endo-siRNAs rather than miRNAs. In addition to
the major peak at 22 nucleotides, there was also a minor peak
at 27-28 nucleotides in endo-siRNAs. For small RNAs coming
from sense strands of ESTs, in addition to a main peak at 22
nucleotides, there were also peaks at 27 nucleotides and 28
nucleotides (Figure 6b). An example of ESTs, aligned with
small RNA reads that match the sense and antisense strands,

Endogenous siRNAs

Despite the short sequences of mature miRNAs, the major
clades are well separated due to substitutions in categories II
to IV (Figure 5b), indicating that these miRNAs may have
clade-specific functions. Scanning miRNA families in these
categories, we identified two families, mir-8 and mir-375, by
which the locust can be separated from other species (Figure
5c). Substitutions in mature miRNAs may lead to changes of
targets, so it is likely that locust mir-8 and mir-375 have different modes of gene regulation in the locust.

is shown (Figure 6c). Also shown in the endo-siRNA
sequences is the high variation at the 5' end of endo-siRNA
clusters and their differences from the miRNA 5' ends (Figures 3a and 6c), again indicating their having a different role
in gene silencing from miRNAs.

Small RNAs derived from transposons
About 20% (8,353 reads) of the small RNAs with a perfect
match with ESTs were derived from transposons. Previous
research has shown that transposons can generate two kinds
of small RNAs: endo-siRNA and piRNA [8], which are 22-23
and 23-29 nucleotides long, respectively. Therefore, the
shorter sequences derived from transposons may be endosiRNAs and the longer may be piRNAs (Additional data file
2).
There are a variety of transposons that could generate small
RNAs regardless of whether they are siRNAs or piRNAs (Figure S3 in Additional data file 3), which may indicate the presence of a broad range of small RNAs for silencing these selfish
genetic elements. Analysis of the transposons we observed
indicated that long interspersed elements (LINEs) were the
dominant class producing small RNAs (approximately 60% of
the transposon-derived small RNAs). CR1 and RTE-BovB are
the dominant subtypes generating small RNAs (approximately 34% of the transposon-derived small RNAs). As more
transposon sequence information in the locust becomes available, we expect there will be additional transposon-derived
small RNAs identified, which will give greater understanding
of the impact of these elements on genome evolution of the
locust and related species.

data file 3). Interestingly, although the 26-27-mer small
RNAs did commonly start with uracil, there was no obvious
preference for an adenine at position 10 (Figure S4c in Additional data file 3). Thus, while their other features do indicate
their being some form of functional small RNA, these 26- and
27-U RNAs are some other kind of small RNA rather than
piRNAs. However, the 28- and 29-U RNAs have a preference
for an adenine at position 10 (Figure S4c in Additional data
file 3); thus, they may be piRNA-like small RNAs.

Different expression profiles of small RNAs in the two
phases
Small RNAs in the gregarious library were enriched for
lengths of 22-23 nucleotides, a typical length for animal miRNAs, and those in the solitary library were enriched for
lengths of 26-29 nucleotides and 22-23 nucleotides (Figure
1a). For small RNAs shorter than 22 nucleotides, the gregarious locust has a higher expression level than the solitary
locust, while for those longer than 22 nucleotides, the opposite is the case. In addition to the different length distributions of the small RNAs, the proportions of each type of small
RNA in the libraries between the two phases were different
(Figure 1b). The proportion of miRNAs in the gregarious
phase is nearly two times as much as that in the solitary
phase; however, endo-siRNAs and piRNA-like small RNAs
make up a larger proportion in the solitary phase compared
with those in the gregarious phase. There are more unannotated small RNAs in the solitary phase, indicating their potential functions, although we could not annotate them. In
summary, the small RNA transcriptomes of the two phases
show big differences in their length distribution and composition.

Classification of the rest of the small RNAs
The rest of the sequences in the locust small RNA libraries
remained unannotated. Most of the unannotated sequences
in the gregarious library were 22 and 23 nucleotides long and
commonly began with uracil (Figure S4a in Additional data
file 3). We expected that these were miRNAs missed in our
search process, and thus suspected that these 22- and 23-mer
RNAs included additional locust-specific miRNAs. In order to
identify the potential miRNA candidates in the remaining 22and 23-nucleotide sequences, we analyzed their 5' ends to
determine whether they were similar in features to the
miRNA 5' terminus (Figure 3a; see Materials and methods).
Our data showed that 10,161 reads (1,025 clusters, 1,275
unique sequences) had a standard miRNA-like 5' end and,
therefore, probably were miRNAs (Table S4 in Additional
data file 3).
There were also longer small RNAs (26-29 nucleotides) that
generally began with uracil, especially in the solitary library
(Figure S4b in Additional data file 3). Their features indicated
that these 26-29-mer small RNAs might be of the piRNA class
of small RNAs. Therefore, we analyzed the sequences of these
small RNAs to look for the presence of an adenine at position
10, a common feature of piRNAs [9] (Figure S4c in Additional

We converted the reads of each kind of small RNA into reads
per million (rpm) in order to make a comparison between the
gregarious and solitary small RNA libraries. Almost each kind
of small RNA, including miRNAs, endo-siRNAs, and piRNAlike small RNAs, had some differences in expression level
between the two phases. Seventeen conserved and 84 predicted locust-specific miRNAs differed by ≥ 1.5-fold between
the two phases. Four examples of conserved miRNAs (mir276, mir-125, mir-1, and let-7) in the gregarious phase were
shown to be expressed 1.94-fold, 1.87-fold, 1.5-fold, and 1.5fold as much as in the solitary phase, respectively (Figure 7a).
Also, some locust-specific miRNAs had a 1.5-24-fold difference in abundance between the two phases (Figure 7b).
Compared with those in the gregarious library, there are more
abundant endo-siRNAs and piRNA-like small RNAs in the
solitary library (Figure 6a; Tables S5 and S6 in Additional
data file 3). For the endo-siRNAs shared in both libraries,
only 3 in the gregarious phase were expressed at least 1.5times as much as they were in the solitary phase. However, 26
endo-siRNAs in the solitary phase were expressed 1.67-54fold as much as they were in the gregarious phase. Moreover,
there are 86 solitary phase-specific siRNAs (≥ 5 reads), while

there are only 6 gregarious phase-specific ones. We also
observed that endo-siRNAs came from 2,307 unigenes of the
ESTs, 319 of which generated siRNAs in both phases. However, 325 unigenes generated siRNAs only in the gregarious
phase, and 1,663 only in the solitary phase. For piRNA-like
small RNAs, the situation is similar to that of endo-siRNAs; 8
piRNA-like small RNAs differed more than 1.5-fold in abundance between the gregarious and solitary libraries, and only
one of them was more abundant in the gregarious locust.
There were no gregarious phase-specific piRNA-like small
RNAs (≥ 5 reads), compared with 36 solitary phase-specific
ones.
There were huge differences between the two phases in the
expression levels of these unannotated sequences. Similar to
those of all small RNAs, the expression levels of most of the
longer (26-29 nucleotide) small RNAs in the solitary phase
were much higher than in the gregarious phase (Figure 7c;
Figure S4 in Additional data file 3), indicating a potential role
of these 26-29 nucleotide small RNAs in the phase changes of
locust.

Discussion
Evolution of conserved miRNAs
Nearly one-third of miRNAs from D. melanogaster in miRBase 11.0 [18] are conserved in the locust, indicating the bulk
of miRNAs in the locust are composed of conserved and lineage-specific RNAs. Although some miRNAs are conserved in
a wide range of species, our study shows that there are some
species-specific nucleotide substitutions in the flanking
regions of the 'seed' sequences in most of the conserved families. For example, the miR-190 sequences in the vertebrates
we examined are the same (Figure 5b), but a different miR190 sequence is found, and shared, in the insect species analyzed. In other words, the same miRNA family of closely
related species can be clustered separately from that of other
closely related species.
Focusing on these conserved substitutions, separate from the
'seed' sequence [6], it is apparent that some highly conserved
miRNA families can also be regarded as 'species-specific'
(Figure 5). The 'seed' sequence is important for mRNA target
recognition, but it alone is not sufficient for miRNA-target
interaction. Given such conserved substitutions, it is possible
that these are present in parts of the mature miRNAs that are
also involved in target recognition. Such findings provide a
clue that miRNA target recognition may be a complex process.
We propose that these conserved regions of sequence substitutions could be classified into different functional groups,
which we call as A, B...and so on. The 'seed' plus region A, for
example, may lead the miRNA to interact with target A,
whereas 'seed' plus region B would lead to an alternative target repression, and so on (Figure 8). According to this model,

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R6

Wei et al. R6.13

we propose that nucleotide substitutions in conserved miRNAs would lead to the generation of new functions for corresponding miRNAs without changing their original functions.
From an evolutionary view, using different modes of the same
miRNAs to regulate the expression of multiple genes would
be advantageous as it is both more economical and safer than
producing completely new miRNAs, which would most likely
cause more harm than good at a high cost upon their emergence [37]. In much the same way, protein evolution often
occurs through changes in specific domains that become conserved during evolution as new functions arise with these
domain changes. This hypothesis also explains why such
sequence substitutions in the miRNA would be maintained in
even distantly related species.

Conservation of miRNA*
Previous studies have often ignored the function of miRNA*
because these sequences are usually regarded as important
primarily for maintaining the miRNA precursor secondary
structure [1,24]. However, our research showed high
sequence similarity for miRNA* between the locust and fruit
fly (Figure 2) even though these two species diverged 350 million years ago [25]. This indicates that miRNA* may also play
a functional role in some biological processes. A recent study
[24] also indicated this may be the case, as they found
miRNA* conservation among 12 sequenced Drosophilids.
These 12 Drosophilids, however, were evolutionarily closely
related. The findings in our study between the long separated
locust and fruit fly provide even stronger support for a biologically functional role of miRNA* beyond maintenance of precursor secondary structure. Overall, with regards to miRNA*
conservation, our findings indicate that organisms regulate

Locust, fruit fly and human have the same targets if only the 'seed'
sequence is used for target recognition. If the 'seed' and region A work
together, mir-8 can regulate different targets in insects and human. If the
'seed' and region B work together, mir-8 in these three species can
regulate species-specific targets. hsa-miR-200b belongs to the family of
mir-8.

mRNA expression in an economic way, using both miRNAs
and miRNA*s.

Reliability of the method to identify locust-specific
miRNAs
We identified non-conserved miRNA families in the locust
due to the application of a new method we developed based
on the biogenesis features of miRNAs [16,20,38], which is
independent of available genome sequence data. To estimate
the validity of the predicted miRNA candidates, we used a
PCR-based method to determine their locations in the locust
genome on the basis of the secondary structure features of
their precursors. We were able to validate 13 of our chosen 24
predicted miRNAs by our PCR-based method and determined that their sequences in conjunction with their flanking
sequences in the genome could be folded into perfect miRNAlike hairpin structures. These results provide strong support
for the reliability of our method to predict species-specific
miRNAs. Although 11 of the chosen predicted miRNAs did not
provide positive results, we felt that this was likely due to the
low quality of primers we used, as we could only refer to short
sequences during primer design. Given these limitations, we
estimated that our false positive prediction rate would actually be lower than 40%. Overall, the principles we adopted in
this study were stringent, especially in our allowance for mismatches (only four) between the predicted miRNA duplexlike pairs. In reality, some canonical miRNAs have more than
four mismatches with their star sequences [18]. So if less
stringent mismatch criteria were used, it is likely that more
miRNAs could be found (data not shown). This, however,
would also be accompanied with a higher false positive rate
due to allowed base-paring of random, rather than true,
miRNA sequences. Thus, in this study, to minimize the false
positive rate, we chose to use the more stringent mismatch
limits when we searched for miRNA duplex-like pairs in the
library.
In addition to the PCR-based method of validation, we also
assessed the reliability of our miRNA prediction method by
using Drosophila miRNA data (see Methods in Additional
data file 3). The findings here provide additional support for
the feasibility and reliability of our method. We believe that
more than 100 of our predicted locust-specific miRNAs would
be canonical.
Although the principle of our method, based on features of
miRNA biogenesis, coincides with that of miRDeep [39], our
method is more effective for finding miRNA duplex-like pairs
when there is little available genome sequence information.
Therefore, our method could be used to identify miRNAs in a
wider variety of organisms, particularly those without whole
genome sequence data. Additionally, we have also provided a
simple experimental method to validate the reliability of the
results predicted by our computational method. Combining
our computational approaches with experimental methods,
novel and non-conserved miRNAs can be identified from any

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R6

Wei et al. R6.14

species regardless of the absence of their genome sequence
data. Being able to identify more novel miRNAs in a greater
number of species even in the absence of genome sequence
data will be invaluable in improving our understanding of the
evolution and function of miRNAs.

Target prediction of miRNAs
It is difficult to predict miRNA targets in animals because the
detailed mechanism of interaction between miRNA and its
target transcripts is not clear, although several bioinformatic
tools have been developed, such as miRanda. None of the
available computational methods can predict miRNA targets
accurately and they all give results with higher false positive
rates [20,32,35]. Moreover, most miRNAs target 3' UTR
sequences of mRNAs in animals, so it is more difficult to predict targets of locust miRNAs without a complete 3' UTR
database. Alternatively, we chose to use a locust EST database
to predict the targets of its miRNAs. Although it is possible to
find some canonical targets of miRNAs, using the EST database will lead to higher false positive rates compared with 3'
UTR database when predicting targets using bioinformatic
tools. Combining the two factors above, although we predicted several targets of locust miRNAs using miRanda, it is
very likely that there are some false positives.
We found that some mRNAs expressed differently between
the two phases of the locust were potential targets of miRNAs.
Because gene expression can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, we believe it is
possible that post-transcriptional gene expression regulation
contributes to differential expression of genes between the
two phases of the locust, such as the locust pale gene, a potential target of lmi-miR-133 (Figure 4c). However, validation of
the relationship between miRNAs and mRNA transcripts
expressed differentially between the two phases needs more
experimental evidence.

The scope of small RNAs in the locust
High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs showed that
there were a large number of small RNAs in the locust transcriptome (Figure 1). Our results indicate that there are fewer
miRNAs in insects than in mammals; this is likely because
there was an expansion in the number of miRNAs at the
advent of vertebrates and mammals [40]. We did find evidence for the existence of several different kinds of small
RNAs in the locust, although the proportion of endo-siRNAs
and piRNA-like small RNAs identified in the locust was small.
We expect that more endo-siRNAs and piRNAs will be identified with an increase in available locust genome and transcriptome data.
A global survey of small RNAs in the locust would contribute
additional information to understanding the function and
evolution of small RNAs in insects. The analysis of the characteristics and expression of small RNAs in the locust
enhances the knowledge of gene expression regulation on

Genome Biology 2009,

non-model and hemimetabolous insects at the post-transcriptional level and enables comparison of long-term evolutionary history between the homo- and hemimetabolous
insects.
The locust has already been used in a variety of ways as a good
model for understanding the mechanisms of the immune system and neural pathways [12,13], in both of which small RNA
gene regulation systems might be involved [5,11]. Moreover,
many of the small RNAs of the locust, a typical hemimetabolous insect, likely have important functions in complex developmental processes.

Small RNAs involved in phase changes
Significant differences in small RNA expression levels
between the gregarious and the solitary phases indicate their
potential functions in phase transition of the locust. The two
phases of the locust share the same genome but exhibit different gene expression profiles and phenotypes, suggesting different regulation of gene expression [13]. Comparison
between the coding genes of the two phases at the expression
level has been done and many interesting genes have been
found to be involved in phase changes of the locust [13,41].
Also, our study shows that the expression patterns of noncoding RNAs differ between the gregarious and the solitary
phases, suggesting that phenotypic differences between the
two phases are epigenetic changes but not derived from
genomic differences.
We found 17 conserved miRNAs to have different expression
levels between the gregarious and solitary phases. These miRNAs may be involved in gene expression regulation at the
post-transcriptional level during phase transition. Especially,
we are most interested in 5 of the 17 miRNAs that are
expressed differentially in the two phases. mir-276 has the
biggest expression difference between the two phases (Figure
7a), although there has been no reports about its function.
Such a difference might imply its functional role in the phase
transition of the locust. let-7 and mir-125 regulate metamorphic processes in C. elegans and Drosophila [42,43]. Phase
changes in locusts can only happen before they have become
adults; solitary locusts can only swarm during the larval
stages and no once they have reached the adult stage. Since
the two miRNAs (let-7 and mir-125) and the phenomena of
phase changes are both linked with metamorphic processes,
we think that the two miRNAs and the phenotype of phase
changes may be related. mir-1 and mir-315 also have different
expression levels (data on mir-315 expression levels is not
shown). mir-1 is a muscle-specific miRNA [28], and mir-315
is a potent activator of Wingless signaling in Drosophila [44].
Because it is related to the thorax muscle and the wing, we
think that the difference in flying ability between gregarious
and solitary locusts may be regulated by mir-1 and mir-315.
Based on our analysis of the small RNA expression levels in
gregarious and solitary locusts, we believe that some small

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R6

Wei et al. R6.15

RNAs that regulate the expression of protein coding genes in
the two phases must be involved in the process of phase
changes. It is possible that we could provide insight into the
phase changes and find new approaches to control the locust
plagues throughout the world by small RNAs.

Conclusion

High-throughput sequencing provides a good chance for us to
study small RNAs in the locust, which is an important worldwide pest. This study led to the discovery of a large number of
small RNAs in the locust, including miRNAs, endo-siRNAs
and piRNA-like small RNAs. Importantly, we have identified
185 potential locust-specific miRNA candidates using the
method we developed, although there is no locust genome
sequence available. Our method makes it possible to discover
more miRNA families in a broader range of species whose
genome sequences have not been sequenced. We further
show the evolutionary path of miRNAs in the locust, indicating the potential evolutionary mechanism of miRNAs. The
function of small RNAs in phase changes of the locust is disclosed in our study. We found significant differences in the
expression of small RNAs between the two phases of the
locust and target prediction shows that some genes expressed
differentially in the two phases are targets of miRNAs, which
gives us clues to further discover the mechanisms of phase
change in locusts.

Materials and methods
Preparation of total RNA
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) from mixed-stage (including embryos,
every instar larvae and adults) Locusta migratoria that we
fed in our lab. We collected 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13
and 14-15 day-old embryos cultured at 30°C in clean sand
with relative humidity. For the larvae, we collected the whole
body except the midgut and pooled them to ensure every
instar was present in the sample. We chose to collect adults at
eclosion, sexual maturation, post-spawning, and elderly
stages separately and then pooled them together. Total RNA
was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. We
examined the quality of RNA using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

Small RNA library construction and high-throughput
sequencing
RNA fragments 14-30 bases long were isolated from total
RNA by Novex 15% TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen). Then, a 5'
adaptor (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was ligated to purified small RNAs followed by purification of ligation products
on Novex 15% TBE-Urea gel. The 5' ligation products were
then ligated to a 3' adaptor (Illumina) and products with 5'
and 3' adaptors were purified from Novex 10% TBE-Urea gel
(Invitrogen). Subsequently, these ligation products were
reverse transcribed followed by PCR amplification. The

amplification products were excised from 6% TBE-Urea gel
(Invitrogen). The purified DNA fragments were used for clustering and sequencing by Illumina Genome Analyzer at the
Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen.

Discovery of conserved locust miRNA families
We discarded bad reads that were the result of incorrect
sequencing or were the reads of adaptor contamination that
were not ligated to any other sequences. We clustered the
remaining reads based on sequence similarity and the dominant reads were analyzed as follows: the reads were analyzed
by BLAST against EST database [13] and FlyBase [17] to discard rRNA, tRNA and snRNA. Subsequently, the remaining
sequences were analyzed by BLAST search against miRBase
v11.0 [18]. Sequences in our libraries with identical or related
(four or fewer nucleotide substitutions) sequences from D.
melanogaster or other insects (mosquito, silkworm, and honeybee) were identified as conserved miRNAs.

Discovery of non-conserved locust miRNA families
We first looked at the high-throughput sequencing data of
small RNAs in other species, including C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and Arabidopsis [16,20,38], and found that star
sequences of most miRNAs were also present in the small
RNA libraries, and that the miRNA-miRNA* duplexes exhibited 1 or 2 nucleotide 3' overhangs, a characteristic of RNase
III enzyme cleavage (Figure 3a). The 5' end sequences of
miRNA clusters showed obvious consistency compared with
other small RNAs and degradation fragments (Figure 3a).
Thus, if a sequence in the locust small RNA libraries is a
canonical miRNA, its star sequence should be identified
based on imperfect base-pairing and a 1-2 nucleotide 3' overhang when paired with its complementary mature miRNA.
Based on the biogenesis features of miRNA (Figure 3a), we
developed a perl script to search for possible candidate
miRNA-miRNA* duplexes, which satisfied the following criteria: they were selected primarily by base-pairing, allowing
for G:U pairing, which is common in the miRNA precursors;
they could contain up to four mismatches; they could have a
maximum size of 4 nucleotides for a bulge in the candidate
miRNA sequence; they had to have a 1-2 nucleotide 3' overhang [45,46]; the dominant strand had to have five or more
reads in the library because miRNAs with a low expression
level were likely to have no star form in the library; the length
of the dominant strand had to be between 18 and 24 nuceotides long; the 5' ends in more than 80% of the reads of those
sequences in the cluster of the dominant sequence of the pairs
had to be consistent with each other. After these criteria were
met, we then used mfold to evaluate the ability of the identified pairs to form a hairpin structure [22,23], where their free
energy of folding (ΔG) was an important standard for use in
determining the stability of RNA secondary structure.
In order to satisfy the requirement of input sequences analyzed by mfold, we joined the two sequences in each candidate

Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R6

Wei et al. R6.16

pair using a standard hairpin-forming linker sequence (GCGGGGACGC). Those pairs that met the following conditions
were analyzed further: the pairs had a free energy less than or
equal to -21 kcal/mol (in cases where there was more than one
partner for a sequence, the pair with the lowest free energy
was selected as the true one); the pairs had no bulge bigger
than 6 nucleotides and multiple loops. The way of determining the best parameters and of testing this method is
described in the Methods in Additional data file 3.

Amplification of the miRNA precursors from locust
genomic DNA
We extracted genomic DNA from the fifth instar locust using
a Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)
according to the manufacture's protocol. We designed primers for 8 conserved miRNAs and 24 candidate miRNAmiRNA* pairs we predicted based on a dependence of the
sequences of the mature miRNA and miRNA* species using
Primer Premier 5.0. (Premier Biosoft International, Palo
Alto, CA, USA) Because mature miRNA may come from either
arm of the precursor, we designed two pairs of primers for
each duplex. Corresponding fragments were amplified by
PCR and the length of amplification products was examined
on 2.5% agarose gels. Fragments between 55 and 70 nucleotides in length were subcloned into pMD18-T vector
(Takara, Dalian, Liaoning, China) for sequencing analyses.

Discovery of endo-siRNAs and piRNA-like small RNAs
using ESTs
The 23-29 nucleotide long RNAs matching ESTs annotated as
transposons were considered as piRNA-like small RNAs.
Those small RNAs that perfectly matched EST antisense
strands were considered as candidate endo-siRNAs if they
were not from annotated transposons. Moreover, we also
searched the ESTs for miRNA precursors. Although there
were some sequences that perfectly matched EST sense
strands, no typical hairpin structure of these ESTs could be
identified using mfold. Rather than folding the entire EST
sequence, regions of 70 nucleotides, 100 nucleotides and 150
nucleotides on either side of the small RNA sequences were
folded.

Prediction of miRNA targets
Unigene sequences from the EST database of the locust
[13,14] were chosen to predict the miRNA targets without distinguishing the 3' UTR from the protein coding region.
miRanda v3.1 [35] was selected as the prediction tool. A
miRanda score greater than 150 was used to select unigene
targets.

3' RACE of the locust pale gene
The 3' UTR sequence of the locust pale gene was obtained by
3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a SMART
RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Takara, Dalian,
Liaoning, China) with the primer GCGACCTGGACAACTGCAACCACCTCAT according to the manufacturer's protocol.
