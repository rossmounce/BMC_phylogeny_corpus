Abstract
Background: The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) is a degenerate 35 amino acid motif that occurs
in multiple tandem copies in members of a recently recognized eukaryotic gene family. Most
analyzed eukaryotic genomes contain only a small number of PPR genes, but in plants the family is
greatly expanded. The factors that underlie the expansion of this gene family in plants are not as
yet understood.
Results: We show that the location of PPR genes is highly variable in comparisons between
orthologous, closely related, and otherwise co-linear chromosomal regions of the Brassica rapa or
radish and Arabidopsis thaliana. This observation also pertains to paralogous duplicated segments of
the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa. In addition, we show that PPR genes that seem
closely linearly aligned in these comparisons are not generally found to be closely related to one
another at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level. We observe a relatively high level of nonsynonomous vs synonomous changes among a group tandemly repeated radish PPR genes,
suggesting that these, and possibly other PPR genes, are subject to diversifying selection. We also
show that a duplicated region of the Arabidopsis genome possesses a relatively high density of PPR
genes showing high similarity to restorers of fertility of cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) systems of
petunia, radish and rice. The PPR genes in these regions, together with the restorer genes, are
more highly similar to one another, in sequence as well as in structure, than to other PPR genes,
even within the same sub-family.
Conclusion: Our results suggest are consistent with a model in which at least some PPR genes
undergo a "birth and death" process that involves transposition to unrelated chromosomal sites.
PPR genes hold certain features in common with disease resistance genes (R genes), and their
"nomadic" character suggests that their evolutionary expansion in plants may have involved novel
molecular processes and selective pressures.

Background
The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) peptide motif, first
described by Small and Peeters [1], is a degenerate 35
amino acid sequence, closely related to the 34 amino acid
tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif. TPRs occur as tandem repeats in a widespread protein family of both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. PPRs also occur in multiple
tandem repeats, but have thus far been found to be exclusively eukaryotic in their distribution. On the basis of the
solved structure of a TPR domain [2] as well as modelling
approaches [1], each PPR domain is though to be configured as two distinct anti-parallel alpha-helices, helices A
and B. In PPR proteins, tandem repeats of these alpha-helical pairs are predicted to form a superhelix that encloses
a central spiral groove with a positively charged ligandbinding surface [1]. PPR proteins are known to mediate
specific RNA processing events including RNA editing [3],
transcript processing [4], and translation initiation [5],
and are thus thought to be capable of specific binding to
both protein and RNA molecules.
Although all sequenced eukaryotic genomes have been
found to encode PPR proteins, the numbers of PPR genes
in both animal and fungal genomes is relatively small. In
plants, however, the size of this gene family is greatly
expanded. In Arabidopsis thaliana there are 441 identified
PPR genes and more than 655 PPR proteins have been
predicted to occur in the rice genome [6].
Analysis of the PPR gene content of the Arabidopsis
genome by Lurin et al. [6] elucidated several categories
and subcategories of PPR genes. The largest category
encodes proteins that are composed of tandem repeats of
the "classical" 35 amino acid PPR motif initially described
by Small and Peeters [1], and now referred to as the P-type
repeat. Lurin et al. [6] were able to differentiate three additional PPR-related motifs found in PPR-encoding genes.
Two of these motifs, S and L1, are tandemly arrayed with
the classical P-type motif in a repeated P-L1-S (PLS) pattern, with the third motif, L2, replacing L1 in the last
repeat pattern at the C-terminal end of the protein. Their
analyses also showed that the PLS subfamily of PPRencoding genes is unique to plants and not found in other
systems. Four subgroups of PPR proteins from the PLS
subfamily differ in the structure of their C-terminal
domains. Although two of the subgroups, E and E+, are
highly degenerate in their C-terminal sequences, the DYW
subgroup shows some conservation of amino acid residues. It has been suggested that this C-terminal domain
may function as a catalytic domain for these PPR proteins
[6]. One PPR gene belonging to the PLS subfamily is
Emb175, a gene essential for plant embryogenesis.
EMB175, like many PPR proteins, is targeted to the plastid
[7].

Another major group of plant-specific PPR genes are the
restorer of fertility (Rf) genes. These nuclear-encoded
genes act to suppress male sterility associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), a phenomenon related to
the expression of mitochondrially-encoded sterility-associated genes. Rf genes identified thus far in petunia, rice
and radish belong to the P subfamily of PPR genes [8-10].
Expansion of the complement of PPR genes within plant
genomes may have occurred through gene duplication. In
Arabidopsis, ancient large-scale genome duplication events
have resulted in multiplication of loci and regions of synteny, where gene number and location are conserved as
paralogous copies. Gene duplication can also arise from
tandem and segmental gene duplication, creating clusters
of identical genes that diverge over time [11,12]. With the
exception of one location on chromosome 1, no clustering of PPR genes has been reported for Arabidopsis [6].
However, tandem clusters of PPR genes have been
observed in petunia [8] radish [10] and rice [9,13,14].
The synteny observed in duplicated genomic regions
within a genome or between orthologous copies in related
genomes can be exploited in gene mapping. However, disruptions of synteny can occur due to gene loss, rearrangement, acquisition or duplication. The source of these
structural changes can be due to tandem and segmental
duplication, as discussed above, but could also be attributed to aberrant homologous recombination, selection,
or changes introduced by transposition events.
The radish restorer of fertility, Rfo, is found in a cluster of
PPR genes at a genomic site where no corresponding PPR
gene is found in the syntenic region of Arabidopsis [10].
We report here that other PPR genes display a characteristic lack of synteny in comparisons of both orthologous
and paralogous plant genomic regions. We show that
while non-PPR genes are largely co-linear in arrangement
and identical in orientation between different related
regions, PPR genes are rarely maintained in the same position or orientation when two related regions are compared. We show that PPR gene family members share
characteristics with plant disease resistance genes (R
genes); in particular we present evidence that at least some
PPR genes, as per R genes, are subject to diversifying selection, i.e. an evolutionary process that selects for, rather
than against, mutations that lead to amino acid replacements in the encoded proteins. Such diversifying selection
processes may also act to multiply and distribute copies of
the genes. Our results also suggest that the Birth-andDeath process initially described for immunoglobulin
genes [15], and adapted by Michelmore and Meyers [16]
for R genes, may apply as well to the duplication and
divergence of PPR genes.

Results
Locations of PPR genes are highly variable between colinear regions of Arabidopsis and Brassica or Raphanus
genomes
We have sequenced Brassica genomic regions in an effort
to identify and characterize the fertility restorer gene Rfp
of Brassica napus. The sequences were isolated from
Brassica rapa genomic DNA introgressed with Rfp. One
such region, represented by cosmid clone P2, contained
four predicted protein-coding genes, one of which could
potentially specify a protein with nine PPR domains.
Comparison with the Arabidopsis genome sequences
revealed a related region on chromosome one, spanning
five predicted genes, At1g13020 through At1g13060 (Figure 1). Three of these genes, At1g13020, At1g13030 and
At1g13060 are co-linear in arrangement and identical in
orientation with their Brassica rapa genome counterparts,
indicating that synteny is preserved between these chromosomal regions of the two species. A high degree of
sequence similarity/identity (47–76%/47–78%) is
observed between the proteins encoded by these Arabidopsis genes and their Brassica rapa counterparts. As is commonly observed in genomic comparisons between
Arabidopsis and Brassica, one of the Arabidopsis genes,
At1g13050, has no apparent counterpart in the Brassica
rapa sequence [17-19]. Most segments of the Arabidopsis
genome are represented at multiple sites in Brassica
genomes, and the resulting high level of genetic redundancy in Brassica may lead to the loss of coding sequences
at one or more such sites.

The syntenic region of the Arabidopsis genome also contains a predicted gene (At1g13040) that could potentially
specify a protein with six PPR domains. In contrast with
At1g13020, At1g13030 and At1g13060, this protein, has
little similarity with PPR protein encoded by the PPR gene
in the co-linear Brassica rapa region (26% identity [I], 46%
similarity [+]). Moreover, its location, between
At1g13030 and At1g13050, is different from that of the
Brassica rapa PPR gene, which is positioned between
orthologs of At1g13020 and At1g13030; its transcriptional orientation, with respect to the co-linear genes of
the region, also differs. Interestingly, this Brassica PPR protein does show a high degree of sequence similarity with
Arabidopsis PPR genes present at distinct sites on chromosome one. In particular, it possesses 69% identity and
81% similarity with the protein encoded by At1g12300, a
PPR gene located in a cluster of such genes near the 4.3
megabase (Mb) mark of chromosome one. Thus, we
observe a preservation of synteny for most genes between
these Arabidopsis and Brassica genomic regions but an
apparent lack of synteny for the PPR genes. This suggests
that the function and order of the non-PPR genes in the
region has been conserved during the evolution of the
Brassicaceae, but that one, and possibly both of the PPR

genes in these two related chromosome regions has
descended from a progenitor located at a distinct, nonsyntenic chromosomal site.
The lack of synteny with respect to related PPR genes was
evident in additional comparisons of Brassica rapa and
Arabidopsis genomic sequences. Two cosmids, P2-9 and
IJC2, containing Brassica rapa DNA sequences encoding
PPR domains were sequenced. P2-9 and IJC2 are paralogous regions that show high structural similarity to one
another (Figure 2). P2-9 contains eight predicted protein
coding genes and IJC2 contains nine. In both cases, two of
the genes encode PPR domains (P2-9-1, P2-9-3, IJC2-2
and IJC2-4). These PPR gene sequences are 80–90% similar with areas of higher similarity within exons. Between
the two Brassica rapa sequences, gene order and direction
of transcription is conserved between the two cosmids
except in the region surrounding PPR genes.

Figure 2 genes in two regions of Brassica napus and the syntenic segment of the Arabidopsis genome
Predicted
Predicted genes in two regions of Brassica napus and the syntenic segment of the Arabidopsis genome. Proteincoding sequences in the Brassica genome fragments P2-9 and IJC2 (as predicted by Genscan). For clarity, Brassica predicted
genes are numbered. Protein-coding sequences in the Arabidopsis genome reflect the Munich Information Centre for Protein
Sequences (MIPS) annotation. The direction of arrows indicates the direction of transcription/translation. Pairs of connecting
lines indicate orthologous coding sequences between Arabidopsis and Brassica; darker pairs of lines connect orthologous PPR
encoding sequences and other important sequences. Shading between connecting lines is added for emphasis and clarity. Darkfilled arrows indicate PPR encoding sequences. Brassica sequences shown are limited by the size of fragment sequenced, thus
genes that are outside these sequences are not available.

IJC2 and P2-9 both show extensive similarity to a region
of Arabidopsis chromosome I spanning the nine genes
flanked by At1g12760 and At1g12820 (Figure 2); one of
these Arabidopsis genes, At1g12775, encodes a PPR
domain protein. The nucleotide sequence identity
between the Arabidopsis and Brassica coding sequences in
this region is 85–90%. Gene order is maintained between
Arabidopsis and the two Brassica rapa sequences, with a few
exceptions. No counterpart of At1g12790, and only a portion of At1g12800, are found in the Brassica cosmids.
The Brassica rapa gene P2-9-3 is similar in both sequence
and orientation to the Arabidopsis PPR gene At1g12775.
P2-9-1 is a duplication of the 3' end of P2-9-3. In addition,
P2-9-1 and P2-9-2 are represented in IJC2 as IJC2-4 and
IJC2-3, respectively, and are inverted in orientation with
respect to their P2-9 counterparts. It is likely that after the
genomic duplication leading to the formation of these
paralogous regions, a local rearrangement occurred. This
rearrangement may have excised the P2-9-1/P2-9-2//IJC24/IJC2-3 fragment and reinserted it into the genome,
knocking out the 3' end of IJC2-2 and replacing it with the
inverted fragment. This may have occurred through the
homologous recombination of P2-9-1 and the 3' end of
P2-9-3//IJC2-2.

The Brassica rapa PPR-encoding open reading frame
(ORF) P2-9-1 is found in a genomic region that corresponds to sequences flanking At1g12760; no PPR
domain-encoding regions occur in this location in the
Arabidopsis sequence. As explained above, the duplication
of the Brassica rapa ortholog of At1g12775, P2-9-3, likely
resulted in the presence of multiple PPR sequences. The
positioning of P2-9-1 to the left of the At1g12760
ortholog P2-9-2 suggests that a genome rearrangement
occurred at this location after the split between Arabidopsis
and Brassica which resulted in the movement of
At1g12760/P2-9-2 sequences. Thus, as in other genomic
comparisons, PPR encoding regions in P2-9, IJC2 and the
corresponding Arabidopsis chromosome I segment are
more highly rearranged than flanking regions encoding
other types of proteins, perhaps as a direct result of the
movement of PPR genes.
The segment of the radish (Raphanus sativum) genome
encoding the Rfo restorer gene has been shown to possess
extensive co-linearity with the Arabidopsis genome [10].
One of the radish genes close to this region, g1, encodes a
protein with PPR motifs (Figure 3). The syntenic non-PPR
encoding genes of Arabidopsis and radish in this region
show a high degree of amino acid sequence identity/sim-

ilarity (63–88%I/67–92%+). Radish g1, however, does
not show synteny with Arabidopsis, and is located on the
opposite side of g2/At1g63310 from its Arabidopsis counterparts At1g63320, At1g63330 and At1g63400 with
which it is most closely linearly aligned. Although g1
shares similarity to these three PPR genes (35–40%I/55–
60%+), it is more similar to Rfo (67%I/75%+) than to any
Arabidopsis gene. Other highly related matches to g1
include the restorers of fertility Rf1 in rice (32%I/55%+)
and Rf-1 in petunia (36%I/57%+). A difference in
sequence exists between radish and Arabidopsis in this
region; a stretch of DNA flanked by PPR genes, and also
by three flavin-containing monooxygenase-related genes,
is present in Arabidopsis but absent in radish (Figure 3). It
is possible that a duplication of this fragment present elsewhere in the radish genome rendered the sequences it
contains redundant, allowing for excision of this nonessential DNA. The presence of PPR genes flanking the
monooxygenase genes may be of significance in the excision of this region from radish, although the mechanism
responsible for this change remains unknown at present.
Variation in PPR gene location between two paralogous
gene regions on chromosome I of Arabidopsis
Several restorer genes from various plant species have thus
far shown homology to a cluster of PPR genes found in the
Arabidopsis thaliana genome [6]. This particular set of PPR
genes is the largest grouping in the Arabidopsis genome of
highly homologous PPR genes. This genome segment is
located at about the 23 Mb mark of chromosome 1 and
includes loci At1g62260 through At1g63630, encompassing 18 PPR genes and pseudogenes [6]. Rfp, the restorer of
fertility for polima CMS of Brassica napus, has been
mapped to a genomic region that is syntenic to a portion
of the Arabidopsis genome located near the 4.3 Mb coordinate of chromosome 1 [20].

Previous studies of whole genome internal duplications of
the Arabidopsis genome have not noted any homology
between the 23 Mb and 4.3 Mb regions [21,22]. However,
when the Arabidopsis genome regions surrounding the 4.3
and 23 Mb coordinates are closely examined, it becomes
evident that there is a group of genes that are conserved
between these two segments (Figure 4). Recently, this
duplication was noted on the website of The Institute for
Genomic Research (TIGR) [23]. In the 23.370–23.440 Mb
region, there are 18 genes identified by the Munich Information Centre for Protein Sequences (MIPS), comprising
four PPR genes, one gene encoding a hypothetical protein
and 13 other genes. In the 4.285–4.365 Mb region there
are 19 genes, including three PPR genes, two genes encoding hypothetical proteins and a transposase-encoding
gene. The two regions share eight predicted coding
sequences displaying significant sequence similarity; 50%
of the non-PPR encoding genes in the 4.3 Mb region pos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/130

sess a paralogous counterpart in the 23 Mb region. In the
23Mb region 57% of non-PPR encoding genes share a paralogous counterpart in the 4.3 Mb region (Tables 1, 2).
Seven of the eight conserved genes are maintained in the
same order and transcriptional direction between the two
fragments.
It has already been shown by Lurin et al. [6] that PPR-containing genes of the Arabidopsis genome can be categorized by their structure and sequence similarity to each
other, including their C-terminal domains. The group of
PPR genes of the 23 Mb region are included in the P subfamily of PPR proteins and are highly similar to those in
the 4.3 Mb region (Table 2). The overall similarity among
the restorer genes and these two groups of Arabidopsis
PPR genes is evident in the linear alignment of the proteins encoded by various restorer genes and representatives of the 23 and 4.3 Mb regions PPRs (Figure 5,
additional file 1). In comparisons based on this alignment, the 4.3 Mb region PPR genes At1g12620 and
At1g12775 are 82% identical (I) and 90% similar (+) at
the amino acid level, whereas they are each only about
58% identical and 74% similar to the PPR gene
At1g12700. Within the 23 Mb region PPR proteins
At1g63070, At1g63080, At1g63130 and At1g63150 are
68–78% identical and 78–88% similar. The outlying PPR
gene, At1g63230, could theoretically encode a protein
which is less similar to other PPR proteins in the 23 Mb
group (52%I/67%+); however, it has been annotated as
false by Lurin et al. [6] due to the lack of a "plausible initiation codon". The divergent nonfunctional sequence
may have arisen from the loss of a start codon, leading
subsequently to lower similarity to related PPR sequences.
The overall degree of similarity between between the
restorer genes and the related Arabidopsis P subfamily PPR
genes of the 23 and 4.3 Mb regions is 49%I/66%+, a much
higher percentage than between restorers and unrelated P
and PLS subfamily PPR genes. This evidence taken
together indicates that PPR-encoding restorer genes originate from the same subset of P subfamily PPR genes; no
PPR-encoding restorer genes have yet been shown to originate from any other subtype of PPR gene.
The close affinity between PPRs encoded in the two Arabidopsis regions with respect to other Arabidopsis PPRs,
including those of the PLS subfamily PPR proteins (ie. E,
E+, PLS and DYW subgroups) is also evident in the tree
diagram of Figure 6. When At1g12700 (4.3 Mb cluster) is
compared with At1g63130 (23 Mb cluster) they are 52%
identical and 69% similar. When At1g12700 is compared
to PPR proteins from these other subgroups they are only
23% identical and 42% similar. Strikingly, when
At1g12700 is compared to other PPR genes of the P subfamily found outside the 23 Mb cluster their proteins are

only about 25% identical and 48% similar, a percentage
that is not significantly different from the comparison to
other PLS subfamily genes. Thus, the PPR proteins found
in the duplicated regions of 4.3 Mb and 23 Mb of chromosome 1 are more similar to each other than they are to
other PPR proteins, even within the same structural subfamily as described by Lurin et al. [6]. The subcellular targeting of PPR genes, however, seems to be independent of

subfamily or subgroup of PPR protein (Table 3). It should
be noted however, that comparisons of widely diverged
repeat family proteins can be problematic [24]. Thus,
while the tree in Figure 6 supports the contention that the
23 and 4.3 Mb PPRs are more similar to one another than
to other Arabidopsis PPRs, no other inference regarding the
relationships among the compared proteins should be
inferred from this diagram.

As can be seen in Figure 4, the order of genes, and their

encoding genes. PPR genes, however, appear to be distributed randomly throughout the two regions. Comparisons

PPR gene. As this alignment shows, the repeat structure among these genes is conserved from sequence to sequence, even
between different species. The asterisk (*) indicates a sequence insertion present only in Rfo.

credence to the hypothesis that PPR genes act as sequencespecific binding proteins, requiring changes in their own
sequence to match the sequences they will bind.

PPR genes in the radish Rfo region have been subject to
diversifying selection
Clustering of PPR genes, such as that seen in the 23 Mb
region of chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis is a phenomenon
also found associated with disease resistance genes (R
genes). R genes are subject to diversifying selection that
acts on them in a manner that causes duplication and
sequence divergence of genes, thus promoting the creation of new or different genes to combat new pathogens
[25]. Brown et al. [10] have shown that the PPR-encoding
restorer gene for Ogura CMS, Rfo, forms a mini-cluster of
PPR genes in radish with the genes g24 and g27. These
three PPR genes are subject to diversifying selection with
a rate of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution (Ka)
greater than that of synonymous nucleotide substitution
(Ks, Table 4). Conversely, other non-PPR encoding genes
of the same region are under the influence of purifying
selection with a greater rate of synonymous nucleotide
substitution (Table 4). This suggests that PPR genes are
under pressure to alter their sequences, thus creating
changes that will diversify the population of PPR genes as
a whole. This differs from other genes which have a tendency to select against mutation and thus to conserve the
sequence of functional proteins. This evidence may lend

Discussion
Pentatricopeptide repeats (PPR) are structural motifs
encoded by a large number of genes in plants and other
organisms, although the PPR gene family is greatly
expanded in plants. It was hypothesized that this could be
due to novel functions served by PPR proteins in plants
that are not required in other organisms, or that PPR proteins replace functions performed by other genes in other
organisms [6]. Recent evidence shows that PPR proteins
can function in chloroplast RNA editing via post-transcriptional conversion of cytosines to uracil [3], supporting the first hypothesis.
Restoration of male fertility is a plant-specific function
encoded by PPR genes. Several recently identified restorers
of male fertility in plants encode PPRs that are related to
each other at the amino acid level. Rf1 of petunia [8], Rf1 from rice [9], and Rfo from radish [10] are restorers of
fertility encoding pentatricopeptide repeat proteins that
share approximately 50% amino acid similarity to one
another. Since the PPR-encoding restorer genes discovered thus far share sequence similarity, and arise in related
gene regions (as is the case with Rfo from radish [26]), it
seems reasonable to speculate that these genes have arisen

Figure 6 found region between PPR proteins of the

Phylogenetic relationship between PPR proteins of
the 4.3 and 23 Megabase region of Arabidopsis chromosome 1 and PPR genes found elsewhere in the
Arabidopsis genome. The seven PPR proteins at the right
hand side of this unrooted tree are all members of the P subfamily of PPR proteins and belong to the 4.3 or 23 megabase
clusters of PPR genes. The other ten PPR proteins are a representative random sampling of PPR proteins of all 5 subfamilies and subgroups (P, E, E+, PLS, DYW, as defined by
Lurin et al., 2004) from chromosome 1 and another chromosome of Arabidopsis chosen at random. PPR proteins of the
4.3 and 23 megabase regions are more closely related to
each other than they are to other P-subfamily genes or other
PPR genes from other sub-groups, and form a distinct branch
away from these PPR proteins.

from a small number, perhaps even a single, progenitor
PPR gene or genes. It is possible that sequences similar to
a restorer gene progenitor are located in the 23 Mb region
of chromosome I, and that a progenitor of one these genes
may have functioned as a restorer gene at some point in
the evolutionary past.
We have found that through comparisons of closely
related orthologous sequences as well as comparisons of
paralogous regions within the Arabidopsis and Brassica

genomes, the locations of genes encoding PPR domain
proteins are highly variable relative to the locations of
other types of genes. A consideration of the most abundant type of plant disease resistance genes (R genes), NBSLRR genes, may be useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying PPR gene diversity and evolution. PPR
genes and NBS-LRR type R genes share several features in
common. Both types of genes encode proteins with a variable number of repetitive motifs, leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs) in the case of NBS-LRR type R genes. In both cases,
a single dominant gene determines the phenotype, and, in
addition, it is the sequence variability within the repeats
that lends specificity of action [10,16,27,28]. Finally, the
genomic positions of many R genes are not conserved in
otherwise syntenic regions of grass genomes [29], similar
to the variability in genomic location of PPR genes shown
here.
The evolution and diversity of plant disease resistance
genes is a result of tandem and segmental gene duplication, recombination, mutation and natural selection [30].
Two sources of gene duplication include local chromosomal rearrangement and large scale genomic duplications [31]; this is consistent with the conserved synteny
model of gene evolution that states that these two mechanisms are the cause of gene distribution and long-distance
(ectopic) duplication of genes [25]. However, most gene
duplications are within restricted local chromosomal segments. These local events are the most recent duplications
and are most evident when they interrupt the colinearity
of gene order in duplicated chromosomal fragments [25].
A nonconservative mechanism (i.e. a local change of location) would explain the lack of conservation of synteny
we observe for PPR genes within closely related genomic
segments. Lurin et al. [6] suggest that one or more bursts
reverse transposition and reintegration could account for
the wide distribution of PPR genes among chromosomes,
as well as the paucity of introns in these genes. Our data
suggest that if retrotransposition underlies transience in
location observed among PPR genes, such events occur

relatively frequently. Moreover, our findings suggest that
following such a transposition event, the original gene
copy would be quickly be lost, as we find no evidence for
such remnants of PPR genes in comparisons in regions
where a PPR gene exists in one, but not other related
genomic regions. It is possible that the "nomadic" character of PPR genes reflects as yet unrecognised mechanism of
gene duplication and transposition, and results in deviations in synteny in orthologous and paralogous comparisons.
Paralogous PPR genes such as those found in the syntenic
Arabidopsis 4.3 and 23 Mb regions are likely the result of
genomic duplications. Such duplicated regions are
thought to diverge because they are physically too distant
from one another for to allow for intergenic exchange
[12]. Instead, sequence variability and changes in copy
number within such regions likely results from interallelic
recombination and diversifying selection [12]. Over time,
tandem gene duplication can occur as is seen in the radish
Rfo region. Interestingly, this tandem duplication is not
evident in Arabidopsis PPR gene distribution. PPR genes
are for the most part found as singlets with PPR gene subgroup members evenly distributed in the Arabidopsis
genome amongst the five chromosomes, whereas R genes
are found more often in clusters of related genes [32]. This
may be a result of the large diversifying selective pressure
exerted on disease resistance loci as plants are continually
adapting to new plant pathogens [25].
Previous studies showed only one defined cluster of PPR
genes in Arabidopsis thaliana; it is the cluster related to
restorer genes of rice, petunia and radish [6]. It is possible
that this clustering indicates diversifying selection acting
on PPR genes from that region as a result of plants adapting to newly emerging sterility inducing genes. The diversifying selective pressure exerted on the mini-cluster of
PPR genes at the radish Rfo locus is one example of this
effect acting on PPR genes and not on other genes of the
same region. Again, the PPR genes of the Rfo region are
out of synteny with the PPR genes of Arabidopsis, while the
non-PPR encoding gene locations are conserved. Diversifying selection may partly explain why non-PPR genes are
not apt to fall out of synteny with their paralogous partners. If diversifying selection is not acting on a gene then
any changes in the sequence are less likely to lead to
changes in gene structure, location or in the amino acid
sequence of the encoded protein; synonymous substitution would outweigh nonsynonymous substitution and
there would be little selection for sequence location
changes [27,33].
Mitochondrially-encoded CMS genes, as well as associated nuclear restorer genes, arise naturally in plant populations. It has been suggested that the spread of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/130

maternally-inherited male sterility in a hermaphroditic
plant populations may be advantageous, since female
individuals would not need to invest resources into the
production of pollen [34]. If the frequency of such a gene
were to become sufficiently high, it would create selective
pressure for the evolution of a corresponding nuclear
restorer gene. This scenario has been termed an "intragenomic arms race" [35]. It is possible that such selective
pressure is responsible for the diversification of at least a
portion of the PPR genes in a particular plant genome,
such as that in the Rfo region of radish. Moreover, the
maintenance of CMS genes within the mitochondrial
genome would provide selective pressure for the maintenance of corresponding restorers in the nuclear genome.
The eventual loss of the CMS gene from the mitochondria
would allow loss of the restorer gene from the nucleus.
This scenario provides one mechanism for the "Birth-andDeath" of plant PPR genes.
The presence of so-called false PPR genes [6] also follows
the Birth-and-Death model adopted by Michelmore and
Meyers [16] for R genes, which indicates that following
gene duplication due to diversifying selection some members have become redundant; mutations which cause
frameshifts or premature stop codons in the coding
sequences of these genes have had their function disabled.
It has been noted that PPR genes contain, on average,
many fewer introns than other Arabidopsis genes, thus
increasing the likelihood that mutations will affect coding
regions [6].

Conclusion
We show here that PPR genes, at least those in the P subfamily, possess a novel, "nomadic" character in that their
positions are highly variable in otherwise co-linear segments of closely related genomes. This suggests that they
may be undergoing a "Birth-and-Death" process that
would involve either non-conservative transposition or
conservative transposition followed by rapid loss of the
non-transposed copy of the gene. They resemble, in several respects, another versatile gene family of plants, disease resistance genes. The common features exhibited by
both types of genes are consistent with the view that PPR
genes may, like R genes function as proteins with malleable binding capacities that can undergo rapid alterations
in response to changing selective pressures. Since it
appears that most PPR genes in plants function by binding to one or a small number of specific target organelle
transcripts, it is possible that changes in organelle
genomes drive PPR gene evolution and thus the evolution
of this gene family in plants likely reflects the co-evolution
of nuclear and organelle genomes. This work suggests that
evolution of PPR genes in plants may involve novel
molecular mechanisms and illustrates one additional feature of this interesting and enigmatic gene family.

Methods

Authors' contributions

Brassica rapa cosmid clones
The Rfp gene has been mapped to a region of the Brassica
napus genome syntenic with Arabidopsis genome sequence
surrounding the 4.3 Mb coordinate on chromosome 1
[20]. Primers for the amplification of gene sequences in
this region were designed using the online software
Primer3 [36]. These primers were used to amplify the corresponding sequences from Brassica napus cv. Westar total
DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
annealing temperatures varying depending on the degree
of homology between primers and their corresponding
Brassica sequence.

RG selected clones, performed sequence assembly and
annotation, performed the alignment analysis, calculated
the Ka and Ks values, and created a draft of the manuscript. GGB conceived of and supervised the work and participated in the drafting and editing of the manuscript.

The amplified sequences were labelled with digoxygenin
according the manufacturer's (Roche Diagnostics, Laval,
Quebec) instructions and hybridised to colony lifts of a
genomic library derived from a B. rapa Rfp containing
doubled haploid individual, as described [20].
Sequence analysis
Sequencing and sequence assembly was performed by
DNALandmarks (St-Jean-sur-Richelieu) [10] and Genome
Quebec (Montreal) using the Applied Biosystems 3730XL
DNA analyzer for capillary sequencing and the Phred/
Phrap programs for some of the sequence assembly. Additional sequences obtained via shotgun sequencing were
assembled using CodonCode Aligner v.1.3.4 [37].
Sequences were analysed using ORF finder [38] to detect
ORFs, Genscan [39] to detect promotor regions, introns/
exons and polyA signals, and Augustus to detect ORFs,
intons and exons [40]. Blast and Blast2Sequences [41]
were used for data mining from nucleotide and protein
databases and for aligning pairs of sequences. Tree building was performed with TreeTop [42] using the Blosum62
matrix and phylip tree building software. Multiple
sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW
online [43]. Protein comparisons were based on the ClustalW aligments whenever possible. The output was shaded
using Boxshade online [44]. Subcellular targeting predictions were made using online programs Mitoprot [45] and
Predotar [46]. The sequences of clones P2, P2-9 and IJC2
have been deposited in GenBank and are listed under
accession numbers EF584011, EF584012 and EF584013
respectively.

Criteria for choosing pairs of duplicated genes included
online annotation mapping [47,48] and BLAST sequence
alignment of the entire CDS and protein sequences with a
cutoff expect value of 1e-20 and bit score of >100.
Arabidopsis annotation is as per the Munich Information
Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) [49]. In some cases,
prediction of PPR domains was made using TPRpred [50].
