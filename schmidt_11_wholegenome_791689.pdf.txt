Whole-genome phylogenies of the family
Bacillaceae and expansion of the sigma factor
gene family in the Bacillus cereus species-group
Timothy R Schmidt, Edgar J Scott II and David W Dyer*

Abstract
Background: The Bacillus cereus sensu lato group consists of six species (B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. mycoides, B.
pseudomycoides, B. thuringiensis, and B. weihenstephanensis). While classical microbial taxonomy proposed these
organisms as distinct species, newer molecular phylogenies and comparative genome sequencing suggests that
these organisms should be classified as a single species (thus, we will refer to these organisms collectively as the
Bc species-group). How do we account for the underlying similarity of these phenotypically diverse microbes? It
has been established for some time that the most rapidly evolving and evolutionarily flexible portions of the
bacterial genome are regulatory sequences and transcriptional networks. Other studies have suggested that the
sigma factor gene family of these organisms has diverged and expanded significantly relative to their ancestors;
sigma factors are those portions of the bacterial transcriptional apparatus that control RNA polymerase recognition
for promoter selection. Thus, examining sigma factor divergence in these organisms would concurrently examine
both regulatory sequences and transcriptional networks important for divergence. We began this examination by
comparison to the sigma factor gene set of B. subtilis.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the Bc species-group utilizing 157 single-copy genes of the family Bacillaceae
suggests that several taxonomic revisions of the genus Bacillus should be considered. Within the Bc species-group
there is little indication that the currently recognized species form related sub-groupings, suggesting that they are
members of the same species. The sigma factor gene family encoded by the Bc species-group appears to be the
result of a dynamic gene-duplication and gene-loss process that in previous analyses underestimated the true
heterogeneity of the sigma factor content in the Bc species-group.
Conclusions: Expansion of the sigma factor gene family appears to have preferentially occurred within the
extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor genes, while the primary alternative (PA) sigma factor genes are, in
general, highly conserved with those found in B. subtilis. Divergence of the sigma-controlled transcriptional
regulons among various members of the Bc species-group likely has a major role in explaining the diversity of
phenotypic characteristics seen in members of the Bc species-group.

Background
The genus Bacillus consists of a heterogeneous group of
Gram-positive heterotrophic aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacilli with the ability to form environmentally
resistant, metabolically inert spores [1]. These soil-borne
organisms are ubiquitous throughout the world, and
occupy surprisingly diverse environments [2,3]. Within
this large genus, the B. cereus sensu lato group consists

of six species [B. anthracis (Ba), B. cereus (Bc), B.
mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, B. thuringiensis (Bt), and
B. weihenstephanensis], based on classical microbial taxonomy [4]. However, newer molecular phylogenies and
comparative genome sequencing suggests that these
organisms should be classified as a single species [5].
On the surface, this conclusion seems difficult to reconcile with the varied biological characteristics of these
organisms. Some Bc strains are thermophiles [6], while
B. weihenstephanensis is psychrophilic [7]. By contrast,
many members of this group are mesophiles, and can be

found in a variety of locales including soil, on plant surfaces and in the mammalian gastrointestinal microflora
[8]. Some members of this group appear to be nonpathogenic, while others cause diverse diseases including
gastroenteritis, food poisoning [8], endophthalmitis [9],
tissue abscesses [10,11], and anthrax [2]. Bt strains have
the capacity to cause disease in insects [12,13] and possibly nematodes [14-16], while some evidence suggests
that Bc strains are part of the normal insect gut flora
[8,17]. Nevertheless, whole genome comparisons
between these organisms reveal a surprising similarity in
gene content, and Han et al. [18] have concluded “that
differential regulation [of gene content] modulates virulence rather than simple acquisition of virulence factor
genes”, a conclusion confirmed by other studies [19].
Consequently, we will refer to these organisms as the Bc
species-group, to reflect the extremely close phylogenetic relationships between these organisms.
How do we account for the underlying genomic similarity of these phenotypically diverse microbes? It has
been established for some time that the most rapidly
evolving and evolutionarily flexible portions of the bacterial genome are regulatory sequences and transcriptional networks [20-22]. Thus, it is no surprise that
major differences between Bc species-group organisms
reside in the regulation of gene expression rather than
gene content. A prime example of this divergence is the
PlcR-PapR quorum-sensing operon, present in all Bc
species-group organisms, but harboring point mutations
that differentiate group members from one another
[23,24]. The papR locus encodes a quorum-sensing signal (a secreted peptide) that is internalized and binds to
PlcR, a transcriptional activator that controls gene
expression and is important for Bc virulence. There are
four distinct phylogenetic groups of the PapR peptide,
each with point mutations that result in a unique
quorum-sensing ‘pherotype’ [23]. The PlcR sensor in
each pherotype has co-evolved to exclusively bind only
its cognate PapR peptide, and each PlcR pherotype is
consequently ‘blind’ to the quorum sensing signals
secreted by other Bc pherotypes. Ba strains (and a low
percentage of Bc strains) [24] have taken PlcR-PapR
divergence a step further. These organisms carry a
unique nonsense mutation in PlcR that inactivates the
quorum-sensing function entirely. Since PlcR and the
global virulence regulator AtxA on the virulence plasmid pXO1 appear to antagonize one another [24], PlcR
inactivation after Ba acquired pXO1 appears necessary
for full virulence of Ba.
This is not to say that horizontal gene transfer and
genome reduction have not been important in remodeling genomes within the Bc species-group. For instance,
the virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2 in Ba appear to
have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer [25], and

Page 2 of 16

represent 52% of the unique coding capacity found in
the Ba genome. Although these genes have a significant
impact on the Ba pathogenic phenotype, this plasmid
gene content comprises only 176 genes, representing a
small fraction of the total coding capacity of the Ba genome. Genome reduction has played a modest role in
divergence of the Bc species-group [26], likely being
responsible for the reduced genome size of Bc NVH39198. However, genome reduction is probably more
important for speciation events; e.g., the M. leprae genome is fully 26% smaller than that of M. tuberculosis,
and carries over 1100 pseudogenes with functional
orthologs in M. tuberculosis. GR has essentially eliminated 50% of the coding capacity of the M. leprae genome [27]. Thus, subtler genome alterations within the
Bc species-group, such as gene duplication, divergence
and point mutations probably have contributed as much
or more than horizontal gene transfer and genome
reduction to the unique niche adaptations of individuals
within the Bc species-group.
Anderson et al. [28] first noted that the genomes of
Bc species-group organisms appeared to harbor an overabundance of sigma factors, compared to B. subtilis
strain 168. Bacterial sigma factors bind RNA polymerase
and allow the holoenzyme to recognize promoter
sequences 5’ to the site of initiation of transcription
[29]. Typically, bacteria encode several different sigma
factors, each of which is responsible for controlling a
suite of genes by activating transcription at a unique set
of sigma factor specific promoter sequences. Sigma factors generally belong to two primary categories, the
sigma54 and the sigma70 families [29]. The sigma54 proteins encoded by the Bc species-group are very highly
conserved, and ubiquitously present as a single copy
gene. Therefore, a phylogenetic analysis of these proteins in the Bc species-group was not particularly revealing (data not shown). We consequently focused further
efforts on the sigma70 proteins. Sigma70 proteins can be
further differentiated into primary alternative (PA)
sigma factors and extracytoplasmic function sigma factors (ECF) [30]. In general, PA sigma factors control
expression of many housekeeping functions of the cell
(e.g., B. subtilis SigA), and allow the organism to
respond to specific environmental stimuli such as heatshock (e.g., SigB) [31,32]; in B. subtilis, several PA sigma
factors are integral to the sporulation developmental
pathway [33,34]. ECF sigma factors typically activate
gene expression in response to extracellular signals such
as the availability of specific iron sources [35,36] and
commonly are essential for disease pathogenesis [37-39].
The activity of a PA or (more commonly) an ECF sigma
is often controlled by an anti-sigma factor that renders
the sigma factor in a state unable to bind RNA polymerase. Activation of the sigma factor for RNA polymerase

Schmidt et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:430

binding and transcription initiation is triggered by a signal (ligand binding, covalent modification or proteolysis)
that inactivates the anti-sigma factor [40].
Thus, sigma factors activate transcription in response
to environmental or developmental signals, and selectively activate transcription by recognizing different consensus promoter sequences to tailor gene expression to
those signals [41]. This suggested to us that many of the
phenotypic differences between members of the Bc species-group organisms might be a consequence of the
sigma factor gene expansion [28], accompanied by divergence among the sigma factor regulons of these organisms. Consequently, we began to explore the phylogeny
of the sigma factors found in various Bc species-group
members, by comparison to the experimentally wellunderstood model organism B. subtilis. To place these
studies in context, we began by constructing a phylogeny of the Bacillaceae using whole-genome single copy
genes. This phylogeny suggested that the current taxonomic affiliation of many members of the Bacillaceae
should be reconsidered. Using this phylogeny as a basis,
we then examined the phylogenetic relationships of the
sigma factors encoded by members of the Bc speciesgroup. We find that the overabundance of sigma factors
encoded by the Bc species-group organisms is specifically in the ECF sigma factors, rather than in the sigma
factor group as a whole. The sigma factor gene family
encoded by the Bc species-group is the end-product of a
dynamic gene-duplication and gene-loss process that
has, until now, underestimated the true heterogeneity of
ECF sigma factor content in the Bc species-group.
Further, the sigma factor content carried by any given
member of the Bc species-group suggests that both
shared and unique gene expression patterns have
evolved during the divergence of this group of organisms from a common ancestor.

Results and Discussion
Whole-genome single copy-gene phylogeny of the
family Bacillaceae
Phylogenetic analysis of 157 single copy genes (Additional file 1) of 41 Bacillaceae genomes (Table 1), using
Paenibacillus and Brevibacillus as outgroups, indicate
that there are five main lineages and suggest four modifications to the taxonomy of the family (Figure 1). The
initial divergence within the Bacillaceae was between
Exiguobacterium, an aerobic, asporogenous, and irregularly shaped Gram-positive bacterium recently linked to
bacteraemia [42], and the bulk of the family. Subsequent
to this, B. halodurans, B. clausii, B. selenitireducens, and
B. pseudofirmus (the B. halodurans group) diverged
from the rest of the family, followed by the divergence
of Oceanobacillus and Lysinibacillus. Within the
remaining Bacillus genera, there is a multichotomous

Page 3 of 16

split between the B. subtilis group (including B. subtilis,
B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, and B. pumilus),
the Bc species-group, B. megaterium, and a group that
includes strains of Geobacillus and Anoxybacillus (G.
kaustophilus, G. thermodenitrificans, Geobacillus WCH70, and Anoxybacillus flavithermus). Although results
from the maximum likelihood analysis indicate a lack of
resolution between these four groups, the inclusion of
Geobacillus and Anoxybacillus within Bacillus has
strong support (particularly relative to the B. halodurans
group). This indicates that Oceanobacillus, Lysinibacillus, Geobacillus, and Anoxybacillus are more closely
related to some Bacillus spp. than are members of the
B. halodurans group, and that, if one wishes the taxonomy of the group to reflect evolutionary history, should
be subsumed within Bacillus.
These relationships are significantly different than
those deduced by most other strategies, until recently.
The family Bacillaceae, including the genus Bacillus, is
a heterogeneous collection of gram-positive rod-shaped
bacteria within the Firmicutes and includes both freeliving and pathogenic species with a world-wide distribution. Their heterogeneity is reflected in a highly
variable GC content ranging between 33 and 78% G
+C. To date, the most commonly utilized phylogenetic
strategy for examining these phylogenetic relationships
has utilized rDNA sequences. Xu and Cote [43], for
example, identified 10 groups within Bacillaceae on
the basis of 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer
sequences. Seven of those groups included members of
the genus Bacillus. The ribosomal database project
(RDB) [44] currently includes 13,359 sequences for
members of Bacillaceae (as of 10/01/2010). However,
recent study of relationships of members of Bacillus
has begun to look beyond 16S rDNA sequences and
has benefitted from the many whole-genome sequences
becoming available. For example, Alcaraz et al. [45]
examined twenty Bacillus genomes and, utilizing a
core-genome conceptual data analysis, determined the
phylogeny of known Bacillus spp. included in their
study and identified four main lineages. Although their
study employed different outgroups, methods, and genomes sampled, their conclusions were similar to ours
and consistent with the idea that the taxonomic affiliation of these organisms needs to be reconsidered, in
the light of whole-genome analyses. This is not to suggest that phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rDNA
sequence should be supplanted by whole genome analyses, due to the obvious practical limitations of requiring the entire genome sequence of an isolate prior to
phylogenetic analysis. However, whole genome phylogenetic methods such as that presented here, and by
other groups such as Alcaraz et al. [45] indicate that
the resolution of 16S phylogenies should be viewed

with caution. Our results also are consistent with the
conclusions of Tourasse et al. [46], who have recently
described an extremely robust analysis of this group of
organisms using a combination of MSLT, AFLP and
MLEE genotyping. Again, these methodologies have
the advantage of not requiring whole genome sequence
for analysis. Nevertheless, the comprehensive nature of
using whole genome sequences for phylogenetic

comparisons is attractive due to the power of the technique, when the data is available.
Within the Bc species-group (Figure 2), Bc subsp. cytotoxis NVH 391-98 is the most distantly related of the Bc

that excludes B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis. While

that Bc subsp. cytotoxis and perhaps B. weihenstephanensis may warrant specific recognition, other organisms
within the Bc species-group do not. For example, the
three Bt strains did not group together. Bt Konkukian is
most closely related to Ba, while the other two Bt
strains are more distantly related. The closest relative of
Bt Al Hakam is Bc 03BB102, while Bt strain BMB171 is
mostly nearly related to Bc strain ATCC14579. Preliminary results for two other Bt strains, kurstaki

T03a001 and HD1, also fall within this region of the
phylogeny (data not shown). Ba strains form a monophyletic lineage and could be a sub-species of Bc. While
subsuming Ba and Bt within Bc may be problematic,
there are definitively Bc strains (e.g. Bc AH820) that are
significantly more closely related to Ba or Bt than they
are to other strains of Bc. Thus, our phylogenetic assessment is consistent with other recent suggestions that the
Bc group exhibits sufficiently high genetic similarity that

Expansion of the sigma factor gene family in the Bc
species-group of the Bacillaceae
Initial dataset containing the Bc species-group sigma
factors

Iterative BLAST searches initiated from 18 B. subtilis
sigma factors initially identified 515 potential sigma factors within the 20 strains of Bc species-group genomes
(see Additional file 2). A total of 16 genes identified in
the iterative BLAST searches were excluded from the
final analysis due to either their short length (in some
cases producing non-overlapping genes when aligned
with all other sigma factor homologs), and/or lack of
evidence from the Multiple Expectation Maximization
for Motif Elicitation (MEME) analysis warranting their
inclusion as a sigma factor (see below). TBLASTN
searches to the nucleotide sequences of the Bc speciesgroup identified 3 additional non-annotated sigma factors that are orthologs of BSU13450 (SigI - present in
the BCAH187 B. cereus genome), and BAS5102 and

BAS1035 (both present in the B. thuringiensis AlHakam genome), respectively.
The seven most informative motifs from MEME analysis proved useful in segregating functional sigma factors from sequences that bore superficial similarity to
sigma factors (false positives), and allowed us to differentiate PA sigma factors from ECF sigma factors (Tables
2 and 3, also see Additional file 3 for the complete
MEME results). Comparing these MEME motifs to previously identified regions of sequence conservation
among sigma factors [50] also was informative. Motifs 1
and 5, which are located near or slightly to the N-terminal side of the -35 and -10 promoter binding sites
(sigma factor regions 4 and 2), respectively, were present

the well-documented differences in size between ECF
and PA sigma factors, these data suggest that the principle functional difference between the two is directly
associated with the binding of the protein to DNA
recognition sites.
Sigma factor genes in the Bacillaceae

Taken as a whole, the number of PA sigma factor genes
found within the genomes of the Bacillaceae was
roughly independent of the genome sizes of these organisms (Figure 3). By contrast, the numbers of ECF sigma
factor genes found in the Bacillaceae increased in direct
proportion to genome size. Thus, the overabundance of
sigma factor genes earlier observed in the Bc speciesgroup organisms [28] resulted from a preferential
expansion in the ECF sigma factors, compared to the
PA sigma factor genes. This might indicate that members of the Bc species-group have evolved a more
sophisticated ability to sense and respond transcriptionally to extracellular signals, compared to other members
of the Bacillaceae with smaller genomes and a relative
paucity of ECF sigma factor genes. Alternatively, this
may indicate that other regulatory regimes (e.g., twocomponent regulators) are preferentially used by members of the Bacillaceae with smaller genomes, for coordinating transcription with extracellular signals. Further
work is necessary to differentiate between these
possibilities.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Bc species-group sigma factors

Within the Bc species-group, phylogenetic analysis of
the sigma factors of the Bc species-group identified 41
paralogous sigma factor genes in these organisms
(Tables 4, 5, and 6, Additional files 2 and 4). Any one

genome contained at most 27 sigma factor genes, hinting at an extensive history of gene duplication and loss
in these lineages. Of these 41 genes, 14 were PA sigma
factors and 27 were ECF sigma factors. Four of the PA
sigma factors genes and 21 ECF sigma factor genes were
unique to the Bc species-group, indicating that the
majority of sigma factor gene expansion within the Bc
species-group is concentrated on the ECF sigma factor
genes, as noted above. By comparison, 18 sigma factor
genes were found for B. subtilis, 10 of which were PA
sigma factors. The Bc species-group harbors 9 PA sigma
factors that are orthologous to the more extensively studied sigma factors of B. subtilis and appear to be the
most evolutionarily conserved. (Six of these PA sigma
factors appear to be very highly conserved as they were

present in all Bacillus species examined). At least one of
these PA sigma factors, BAS0093, the ortholog of the B.
subtilis SigH locus, is evolutionarily conserved amongst
many of the Firmicutes [51]. Further, the location of
these conserved PA sigma factors within their respective
genomes was syntenic between genomes. Indeed, finding
a PA sigma factor that was not present in all members
of the Bc species-group was rare (Figure 4). One B. subtilis PA sigma factor, BSU16470 (SigD), lacked an orthologous sequence in all members of the Bc species-group.
A second PA sigma factor, BSU12560 (Xpf), was uniformly found in all Ba strains but only in one other Bc
strain (Bc ZK) and in B. weiheinstephanensis. Two
(BAS0928 and BAS3231) were absent in Bc subsp. cytotoxis. In rare cases (e.g. plasmid-borne pE33L466_0212
of Bc ZK, with similarity to the SigA genes of B. clausii
and B. halodurans), a few PAs appear to be the result of

horizontal gene transfer from organisms outside of the
Bc species-group. However these are the only data that
we found indicative of horizontal transfer, suggesting
indirectly that horizontal gene transfer has not been a
significant contributor to sigma factor evolution in these
organisms.
The pattern of ECF sigma factor distribution was decidedly different and more complex. Of the 7 ECF sigma
factors found in B. subtilis, 6 were not present in the Bc
species-group. Thus, the divergence of the Bc speciesgroup from B. subtilis resulted in a relatively stable set
of PA sigma factor genes shared by both, with a regimen
of gene expansion that resulted in additional ECF sigma
factors encoded in the genomes of the Bc species-group.
Interestingly, our analyses suggest that this pattern of
expansion of ECF sigma factor genes within a given
lineage may independently occur in another lineage of

Bacillales. Our initial screen of sigma factors identified
52 sigma factors encoded in Brevibacillus brevis [52]. Of
these 52 genes, 41 are ECF sigma factors. The B. brevis
ECF sigma factor gene family may therefore represent
an independent and dramatic expansion, comparing
whole-genome phylogenetic analysis (see above) and the
absence of sequence similarity of the B. brevis ECF
sigma factors to those of the Bc species-group (data not
shown).
In contrast to the relative conservation of the PA sigma
factors, the patterns of gene duplication/loss among paralogous ECF sigma factors of the Bc species-group were
difficult to deduce (Figure 5). No clear syntenic pattern
was observed when comparing the location of these ECFs
in the various genomes. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis
(phylogenetic relationships of the 499 Bc species-group
sigma factors can be found in Additional file 4) indicates
some support for relationships between four groups of Bc
species-group ECF sigma factors, including: 1) BAS0964
and BAS2600 (supported in 70 NJ bootstrap replicates),
2) a grouping of three paralogs including BAS2758 and
BcerKBAB4-5577, followed by BAS1966 (supported in 90
and 93 NJ replicates, respectively), 3) BAS2285 and
BAS0613 (supported in 83 NJ bootstrap replicates, and 4)
BAS2545 and BcerKBAB4-3133 (supported in 100 NJ
replicates). However, evidence of more recent common
ancestry between any pair of sigma factor paralogs is the
exception rather than the rule. The remaining 18 Bc species-group ECF sigma factor genes are of indeterminate
relation to one another, and the preponderance of evidence seems to point to an active period of ECF sigma
factor duplications in the ancestors of the Bc speciesgroup. However, the evolutionary origin of many of the
ECF sigma factors in the Bc species-group is difficult to
discern, as the phylogenetic placement of these genes
was more complex than for PA sigma factors. While it
was relatively unusual to find PA sigma factors that were
only encoded in some genomes, the pattern of ECF
sigma factor genes harbored by some but not all Bc species-group organisms was complex (compare Figures 4
and 5).

Conclusions
The preponderance of evidence presented here and elsewhere is that the ECF sigma factors of the Bc species-

Figure 4 Phylogenetic distribution of PA sigma factors in the Bc species-group. Sigma factors genes found in fewer than all of the
genomes listed in Table 1, mapped on a Bc species-group cladeogram similar to that shown in Figure 2. The five Ba strains in Table 1 have a

group have common ancestry with one another and they
are the product of gene duplications, although at this
time the bulk of that evidence is raw sequence similarity. Our hypothesis is that many of the ancestors of
these genes regulated a larger sub-set of genes than
their descendents do presently. Following duplication,
each cognate descendent sigma factor was then free to
specialize (fine-tune) for a smaller subset of genes and
for a more specialized role, and in the process of evolving into this specialized niche these genes then become
critically important in the survival of descendent generations and are retained in their respective genomes. This
subfunctionalization [53] of gene regulation also is
potentially reinforced by duplication and/or

specialization of the genes which they regulate, which
are likewise free from constraints that arise from being
co-regulated with a larger set of genes. Interestingly, this
suggests that, although our ability to discern relationships among paralogous ECF sigma factors at this time
is, at best, murky, in the future these relationships may
be deduced from genes that each sigma factor is found
to regulate.

Methods
Whole-genome single copy-gene phylogeny

Our initial aim was to determine the sigma factor content of the ancestral Bc species-group genome and then
to determine the changes that had subsequently

occurred during divergence of these genomes. However,
the genus Bacillus has undergone numerous and complex recent taxonomic revisions and been the subject of
discordant phylogenetic results [1,43], making any definitive definition of the genus a potential complication.
Consequently, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of the
Bacillaceae that was independent of earlier efforts, but
relied solely on whole genome sequences to discern
relationships. Our efforts focused on the family Bacillaceae as defined by the ribosomal 16S rDNA sequences
contained in the Ribosomal Database Project Release 10
[44], to direct our sampling of whole-genome data
(Table 1) available at NCBI. This yielded a total dataset
of 41 genomes. We purposely excluded draft genome
sequences from this analysis to ensure that the absence
of a given sigma factor was not an artifact of the incomplete sequence available for that organism. Two close
relatives of the Bacillaceae, Paenibacillus and Brevibacillus, from the closely related family Paenibacillaceae,
were used as outgroups for the purpose of rooting. We
then performed phylogenetic analyses on the larger

Bacillaceae to identify the closest relatives to the Bc species-group.
Determination of a gene’s orthology is the most
important complicating factor in identifying phylogenetic relationships derived from whole genome data. We
avoided this problem by restricting our analysis to single-copy genes, for which determination of orthology
versus paralogy is not needed [54]. Aligned amino acid
sequences were used because the extent of divergence of
the genes examined made alignments of DNA sequences
unreliable in many cases. Single-copy genes were identified using BLAST searches of each annotated proteincoding gene of one genome to all other genomes listed
in Table 1. Results of the BLAST were parsed to identify
instances where a gene’s BLAST result produced a hit
for one and only one of each genome in the analysis.
Qualifying genes (Additional file 1) were extracted from
the dataset and aligned with ClustalW [55] and put into
a concatenated cumulative dataset for phylogenetic analysis with PHYLIP [56]. Phylogenetic analysis of this
data set with the Proml progam of PHYLIP utilized the

maximum-likelihood algorithm and 100 bootstrap
replicates.
Identification of sigma factor genes and MEME analysis

Genes encoding prospective sigma factors of the Bc
species-group were identified with an iterative automated BLAST search of amino acid sequences, using
as an initial reference the annotated sigma factors of B.
subtilis, the most studied of Bacillus genomes. The B.
subtilis proteins were initially compared by BLAST to
the predicted protein coding sequences of the Bc species-group. Proteins identified in this analysis were
iteratively compared by BLAST against the Bc speciesgroup until no additional prospective sigma factors
were found. This process, while minimizing the possibility of false negative results (missed sigma factors),
inevitably resulted in the inclusion of sequences that,
although bearing superficial similarity to a known
sigma factor, were likely not functional sigma factors
(false positives). Consequently, this analysis was supplemented with MEME [57]] analysis using the zoops
setting. The zoops setting does not require the presence of a motif since it is unlikely for these genes to
have repeated motifs. All other MEME settings used
the default parameters. We searched for up to 10
motifs, 7 of which proved informative for identifying
these sigma factors, and differentiating between PA
and ECF sigma factors (Tables 3 and 4 and Additional
file 3). MEME motifs were utilized to segregate genes
that most likely encoded functional sigma factors from
those that were not. An additional benefit of the
MEME analysis is that it provided independent evidence in addition to that of the BLAST analyses to
segregate sigma 70 PA sigma factors from ECF sigma
factors. This gene identification process also was vulnerable to variation in annotations between the published genomes, which could result in the omission of
sigma factors that were not present in the original
annotations. Thus, we used TBLASTN searches of the
identified sigma factors against the complete nucleotide sequences of all genomes, which were consequently examined to see if any such cryptic nonannotated sigma factors were present in members of
the Bc species-group. The presence/absence data
reported here was updated to reflect these gaps in the
publicly-available annotations. Lastly, sigma factor proteins identified in these analyses were aligned using
ClustalW and phylogenetic relations among them were
examined using the neighbor-joining algorithm of
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA)
[58]. Other algorithms (such as maximum-likelihood)
were computationally infeasible due to the large size of
the data set (499 genes).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Single-copy genes used in the phylogenetic
analysis of the Bacillaceae. Annotations for each of the single-copy
gene are from the Paenibacillus genome as submitted to Genbank, one
of the outgroups included in the analysis.
Additional file 2: Sigma factor genes identified in this study. Locus
tags for genes found in each genome follow the locus tag identifier or
sigma factor identifier for each ortholog.
Additional file 3: Results of MEME analysis of the sigma factor
genes identified in iterative BLAST searches. MEME results for 10
motifs (nmotifs = 10) are shown, 7 of which follow phylogenetic patterns
that differentiate PA from ECF sigma factors (Tables 2 and 3).
Additional file 4: Results of phylogenetic analysis of the sigma
factors identified in Additional file 2. Phylogenetic analysis utilized the
neighbor-joining algorithm of MEGA (see text).
