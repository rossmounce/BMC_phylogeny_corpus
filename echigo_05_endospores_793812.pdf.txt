Abstract
Background: Generally, extremophiles have been deemed to survive in the extreme environments to which they had
adapted to grow. Recently many extremophiles have been isolated from places where they are not expected to grow.
Alkaliphilic microorganisms have been isolated from acidic soil samples with pH 4.0, and thermophiles have been isolated
from samples of low temperature. Numerous moderately halophilic microorganisms, defined as those that grow
optimally in media containing 0.5–2.5 Molar (3–15%) NaCl, and halotolerant microorganisms that are able to grow in
media without added NaCl and in the presence of high NaCl have been isolated from saline environments such as
salterns, salt lakes and sea sands. It has tacitly been believed that habitats of halophiles able to grow in media containing
more than 20% (3.4 M) are restricted to saline environments, and no reports have been published on the isolation of
halophiles from ordinary garden soil samples.
Results: We demonstrated that many halophilic bacteria that are able to grow in the presence of 20% NaCl are
inhabiting in non-saline environments such as ordinary garden soils, yards, fields and roadways in an area surrounding
Tokyo, Japan. Analyses of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of 176 isolates suggested that they were halophiles belonging
to genera of the family Bacillaceae, Bacillus (11 isolates), Filobacillus (19 isolates), Gracilibacillus (6 isolates), Halobacillus (102
isolates), Lentibacillus (1 isolate), Paraliobacillus (5 isolates) and Virgibacillus (17 isolates). Sequences of 15 isolates showed
similarities less than 92%, suggesting that they may represent novel taxa within the family Bacillaceae.
Conclusion: The numbers of total bacteria of inland soil samples were in a range from 1.4 × 107/g to 1.1 × 106/g. One
tenth of the total bacteria was occupied by endospore-forming bacteria. Only very few of the endospore-forming
bacteria, roughly 1 out of 20,000, are halophilic bacteria. Most of the halophilic bacteria were surviving as endospores in
the soil samples, in a range of less than 1 to about 500/g soil. Samples collected from seashore in a city confronting Tokyo
Bay gave the total numbers of bacteria and endospores roughly 1000 time smaller than those of inland soil samples.
Numbers of halophilic bacteria per gram, however, were almost the same as those of inland soil samples. A possible
source of the halophilic endospore originating from Asian dust storms is discussed.

Background
Extremophiles are microorganisms adapted to grow in
conditions such as extreme pH, temperature, salinity and
absence of oxygen [1]. The representatives are acidophiles
(Thiobacillus ferroxidans), alkaliphiles (Bacillus alcalophilus), hyperthermophiles (Thermoproteus tenax), extreme
halophiles (Halobacterium salinarum) and methanogens
(Methanobacterium formicicum). In general, it has been
believed that they survive in the extreme environments to
which they had adapted to grow. Many extremophiles,
however, have been isolated from places where they are
not expected to grow. Alkaliphilic microorganisms were
isolated from acidic soil samples with pH 4.0 as well as
from neutral and alkaline soil [2]. Thermophiles have
been isolated from environments of high temperature and
also from samples of lower temperature such as soil, food,
animal's excrement and seawater [3]. For example, Bacillus
stearothermophilus (now Geobacillus stearothermophilus) and
Clostridium thermoautotrophicus (now Moorella thermoautotrophica) were isolated from ordinary soil. Strictly anaerobic bacteria such as methanogens, sulfate-reducers, and
homoacetogens were isolated from rice paddies during
dry fallow period, arable soils, and even from desert soils
[4,5]. Thus, the notion that isolation of an organism from
a given environment does not mean that the organism is
growing in that environments, but just surviving is now
generally accepted.
Halophilic microorganisms are adapted to conditions of
high salinity and require a certain concentration of NaCl
for their optimum growth [6,7]. They have been isolated
from various saline environments such as salt lakes (eg.
the Dead Sea, the Great Salt Lake), salterns, solar salts and
subsurface salt formation. Extremely halophilic microorganisms require high concentration of NaCl for their
growth, with optimum concentrations of 2.5–5.2 M (15–
30%). Haloarcula vallismortis and Haloterrigena turkmenica
for example, have been isolated from salt pool of Death
Valley, California, and saline soil of Turkmenia, respectively [8,9]. Moderate halophiles are defined as those that
grow optimally in media containing 0.5–2.5 M (3–15%)
NaCl, such as Halomonas maura isolated from a saltern in
Morocco, and Marinococcus halophilus isolated from sea
sands [10,11]. Halotolerant microorganisms possess the
ability to grow in media without added NaCl and also in
the presence of high concentrations of NaCl. For example,
Halobacillus salinus isolated from a salt lake in Korea is
able to grow without added salt and in media containing
up to 23% NaCl [12].
Are halophiles inhabiting non-saline environments such
as garden soil, yards and field? Bacillus clarkii, B. agaradhaerens and B. pseudofirmus are examples of halotolerant
bacteria isolated from soil samples that were shown to be
tolerant up to 16% or 17% NaCl [13]. It has, however,

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/8

been tacitly believed that habitats of halophiles able to
grow in media containing higher concentrations, let's say
20% (3.4 M), are restricted to saline environments
[14,15], and no reports have been published on the isolation of microorganisms able to grow at 20% or higher
NaCl concentrations from ordinary, non-saline soil samples. In 1980 Onishi et al. [14] surveyed extensively the
occurrence of halophilic bacteria in more or less saline
samples collected in Japan. They adopted enrichment culture in a medium containing 4 M (23.4%) NaCl, a customary concentration for the cultivation of Halobacterium
spp. They isolated 168 strains finally, but no enrichment
was obtained from one third of 287 samples of sea sands
and seaweeds collected on seashore. They did not include
ordinary garden soil samples. It should be pointed out
that a non-pigmented haloarchaeon strain 172P1 (designated later as Natrialba asiatica [16]) was isolated during
their survey from dry beach sands with granular salts
attached.
In this study, we defined "halophilic bacteria", for convenience, as microorganisms that form colonies on agar
plates of a complex medium with 20% added NaCl, and
demonstrated that halophilic bacteria are inhabiting in
non-saline environments such as ordinary garden soils,
yards, fields and roadways in an area surrounding Tokyo,
Japan. Phylogenetic analyses of the isolates suggested that
they were halophiles belonging to genera of the family
Bacillaceae.

Results
Isolation of halophilic bacteria from soil samples
Soil samples (0.5 g each) taken from 360 places were
spread on agar plates containing 20% NaCl, with pH
adjusted to 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 respectively. The pH of the soil
samples ranged between 5.0 and 6.0. After incubation of
plates for 3 weeks at 37°C, colony formations were
observed in 132 soil samples (red circles in Fig. 1), at least
on one of the three agar plates. Numbers of colonies per
plate ranged from 1 on 51 plates to 40 on 1 plate. The sum
of colonies amounted to 49 from the medium of pH 9.0,
534 from the pH 7.0 medium, and 61 from the medium
of pH 5.0. By inspecting each plate, representative colonies were picked up and transferred to fresh plates and
purified by plating out of serial dilutions. A few isolates
gradually failed to form colonies on fresh plates. When
colonies failed to grow on fresh 20% NaCl plates, concentration of NaCl was decreased to 15 or 10%. It was
observed that 26 strains failed to grow in the presence of
20% NaCl. According to our definition of the present
paper, these strains are not 'halophilic bacteria', but these
strains were included in the further characterization (see
discussion).

Anaerobic halophiles
Five soil samples which gave considerable numbers of colonies on the aerobic cultures were spread on agar plates
(pH 7.0) and incubated in anaerobic jar for 3 weeks. No
colonies were observed at all, while 30 to 40 colonies
appeared from the same soil samples incubated
aerobically.
Growth range of NaCl concentration and pH in liquid
media
Of the 27 strains isolated on the alkaline medium, 21
strains did not grow in media without NaCl, and all
except one (strain No. 31) showed optimal growth at alkaline pH, 8.5–9.5 in the presence of 10% NaCl. On the
other hand, about 78% (116/149 strains) of the strains
isolated on neutral and acidic media were shown to be
able to grow without added NaCl, and all strains showed
optimal growth at pH 6.5–7.5 (Table 1).

Figure 1

Collection sites of the 360 soil samples. Red circles; colonies were detected from at least one of the three plates of
different pH, black circles; colonies were not detected. A
white double circle indicates Tokyo Station, and a white circle indicates Narita Airport.

Altogether, 176 strains were divided into 3 groups. Strains
of group I and group II may be classified as moderately
halophilic bacteria, according to the classification proposed by Kushner et al. [6].
Group I (54 isolates) showed optimal growth between 1.7
and 2.6 M NaCl, and no growth in the absence of added
NaCl.
Group II (62 isolates) showed optimal growth between
0.9 and 1.7 M NaCl, and growth in the absence of added
NaCl.

Finally, 176 strains were obtained (Table 1): 27 strains
from 23 samples on alkaline medium (pH 9.0), 139
strains from 120 samples on neutral medium (pH 7.0),
and 10 strains from 9 samples on acidic medium (pH
5.0). Endospores were observed by microscope after spore
staining [17]. These strains have been kept at 5°C on agar
plates of 10% NaCl.
On the other hand, from 228 soil samples (black circles in
Fig. 1), about two thirds of the 360 samples collected, no
colonies appeared on any plates of the three different pH
values. There was no distinct bias in the distribution of
black and red circles. In order to estimate if those soil samples contain indeed no microorganisms able to grow at
20% NaCl, two soil samples were randomly picked up,
and 0.5 g each was spread on to 10 agar plates of pH 7.0.
The colony numbers per plate ranged from 0 on 3 plates
to 5 in 1 plate, amounting to 14 in sample 1. From
another sample the numbers were from 0 on 3 plates to 4
on 1 plate, amounting to 14 colonies. These data may suggest that halophilic bacteria able to grow at 20% NaCl
inhabit any soil samples, at least at a frequency of 1 c.f.u.
(colony forming unit)/g soil, in the area we investigated.

Group III (60 isolates) showed optimal growth between 0
and 0.9 M NaCl, and growth in the absence of added
NaCl.
Tentative identification of the isolates by partial 16S rRNA
gene sequences
Sequences of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA genes were
determined (about 500 nucleotides), and the 176 strains
were tentatively identified by comparing to sequences
deposited in databases (Table 1). Summaries of tentative
identifications are given in Table 2.
Isolates from the alkaline medium
Ten out of 27 strains showed more than 98% sequence
similarities to Bacillus haloalkaliphilus. It was noteworthy
that these isolates differed considerably in the range of
NaCl for growth; from 0.9–1.7 M to 1.7–4.3 M. Two isolates possessed 97.2 and 94.0% similarities to Filobacillus
milosensis, and one isolate was most closely related to Gracilibacillus halotolerans (96.1% similarities). Fourteen
other isolates had less than 92% sequence similarities to
any deposited sequences. Eight isolates showed 86.9–
88.0% similarities to 'Bacillus nitritophilus', and one isolate

Strains No. 1–31 isolated on alkaline medium (pH 9.0), strains No. 51–203 isolated on neutral medium (pH 7.0) and strains No. 211–220 isolated
on acidic medium (pH 5.0). Abbreviations of prefectures: C, Chiba; G, Gunma; I, Ibaraki; K, Kanagawa; S, Saitama; T, Tokyo; Tg, Tochigi.
Abbreviations of pigmentation:–, None; B, Brown; P, Pink; Y, Yellow. Abbreviations of generic names: B., Bacillus; F., Filobacillus; G., Gracilibacillus; H.,
Halobacillus; L., Lentibacillus; P., Paraliobacillus; Pc., Planococcus; V., Virgibacillus.

87.3% similarity to 'Planococcus psychrotoleratus' but these
species have not been validly published. Similarities of
complete sequences of the 14 isolates (data not shown)
were less than 92%, thus they may represent novel taxa.
Out of these 14 isolates, 5 strains were pigmented brown
and 2 isolates were yellow.
Isolates from the neutral medium
Sixty six out of 139 strains showed more than 95%
sequence similarities to Halobacillus litoralis: 28 isolates
possessed more than 98% similarities to Halobacillus

isolates more than 95% similarities to Paraliobacillus

to Halobacillus karajensis (94.8%), Virgibacillus carmonensis
(93.5%) and Lentibacillus salicampi (100%), respectively.
One isolate had less than 89% similarities to any
deposited sequences. In the strains from the neutral
medium, 29 strains pigmented yellow, and 5 strains were
pigmented pink.
Isolates from the acidic medium
Sequences of 6 out of 10 strains were most similar to that
of Halobacillus litoralis, with more than 94% sequence similarities. Four other strains were most similar to Virgibacillus necropolis (94.5%), Virgibacillus halodenitrificans
(100%), Halobacillus trueperi (97.5%) and Bacillus megaterium (100%).
Ratios of halophilic bacteria to total bacteria
The numbers of total bacteria (c.f.u. on plates with no
NaCl) and halophilic bacteria were determined in six
inland soil samples; three samples had 30–40 colonies on

the 20% NaCl agar plates (pH 7.0), and three samples had
just 1 colony on the same medium. As shown in Table 1,
the number of c.f.u. on the plates ranged from 340 ×
1,000 to 28 × 1,000, thus the total bacteria of inland soil
samples were in a range from 1.4 × 107/g (340,000 × 20 ×
2) to 1.1 × 106/g (28,000 × 20 × 2). Roughly speaking, one
tenth of the total bacteria were occupied by endosporeforming bacteria, and only very few of the endosporeforming bacteria, roughly 1 out of 20,000 or more cells,
are halophilic bacteria. Table 3(A) also suggests that most,
if not all, of halophilic bacteria are surviving as
endospores in the soil samples, in a range of less than 1 to
about 500/g soil.
In a separate experiment, 0.5 g of a soil sample was suspended in 2 ml of sterile 10% NaCl, and heated at 80°C.
After incubation for 0, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, three 0.1 ml
aliquots were taken, spread on 20% NaCl agar medium
(pH 7.0), and incubated for 2 weeks. Data in Table 4
clearly indicated that numbers of c.f.u. (halophilic bacteria) showed little decrease upon heating for 60 min, indicating again that the most of halophilic bacteria were
surviving as endospores in soil.
Halophilic bacteria in outdoor accumulations?
Outdoor accumulations (dust, fine sands etc.) were collected from places like roofs of buildings, veranda, cars,
and barks of trees, where heavy rainfall would wash away
the previous ones. Numbers of bacterial cells and
endospores present ranged from 0.8 × 106 to 7.6 × 106/g
and from 89 × 103 to 812 × 103/g, respectively. No
colonies, however, were observed on any 20% NaCl plates
(pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0) from 0.5 g samples, even after 8
weeks incubation. Repeated incubations of outdoor accumulations collected 2 weeks after rainfall gave no colonies
at all.

NaCl contents of samples
Analyses of Cl content of soil samples suggested that NaCl
contents of soil samples taken from near seashore were as
high as 15–20 mg NaCl/g, whereas the 360 inland soil
samples contained less than 1 mg NaCl/g.

Halophilic bacteria in seashore soil (sands)
Six samples were collected from three spots of seashore in
Tateyama of Chiba prefecture, a city confronting Tokyo
Bay (Fig. 1). Samples were suspended, heated at 80°C,
and subjected to colony counting. Table 3(B) showed
clearly that the total numbers of bacteria and endospores
were roughly 1000 time smaller than those of inland soil
samples. Numbers of halophilic bacteria, however, were
almost the same as those of inland soil samples.

Haloarchaea in soil samples?
The agar plate with 20% NaCl used in this study was based
on the medium No. 168 recommended by JCM (Japan
Collection of Microorganisms) for the cultivation of
haloarchaea. All of the pink to brown colonies that might
be haloarchaea were picked up, but they all belonged of
the family Bacillaceae. To ascertain that haloarchaea are
not present in the soil samples, at least to the limit of
detection, soil samples were spread on agar plates of 20%
NaCl, pH 7.0 and 9.0, supplemented with 30 µg/ml ampicillin. Generally, numbers of colonies decreased to less
than one tenth of those obtained on plates without ampicillin. From five soil samples out of 107 samples tested,
four colonies were obtained on plates of pH 7.0, and 12
colonies on those of pH 9.0. No colony appeared from
seven samples from seashore at Tateyama. The colonies
were transferred to liquid media containing ampicillin,
and 10 strains that grew were subjected DNA extraction
and PCR amplification using both bacterial and archaeal
16S rRNA gene primer sets. All of them yielded amplification bands only with bacterial primers, suggesting they
were not haloarchaea but halophilic bacteria harboring
plasmids with β-lactamase genes.

Discussion
Definition of "moderate halophiles", "extreme halophiles" and "halotolerant" has long been given by Larsen
[18] and Kushner & Kamekura [6]. In this paper, we
defined "halophilic bacteria", for convenience, as microorganisms able to form colonies on agar plates containing
20% (3.4 M) added NaCl. Strictly speaking, there existed
moderate halophiles that were not able to grow in the
presence of 20% NaCl.
Is the distribution of halophilic Bacteria and Archaea
restricted?
Since halophilic bacteria have been recognized to live in
the Dead Sea [18], numerous halophilic and halotolerant
microorganisms, both aerobic and anaerobic, both Bacteria and Archaea, have been isolated from saline environments. Thanks to the enthusiastic devotion of A. Oren on
halophilic microorganisms [7], we know that halophilic
Bacteria are not restricted to the class Bacilli (Bacillus sensu
lato) but distributed through classes of Cyanobacteria, α-,
β-, γ-, and δ-proteobacteria, Clostridia, Actinobacteria,
Flavobacteria, etc. Although Oren defined the "halophilic" as tolerance to 10% (100 g/L) NaCl in his book
[7], some of the halophilic microorganisms are able to
grow in the presence of 20% NaCl. We also know that all

The soil sample used was 84-10 (Toride, I).

microorganisms that were intentionally isolated as halophiles are inhabitants of saline environments. On the
other hand, some bacteria isolated from soil are able to
tolerate high NaCl concentrations. For example, Bacillus
clarkii, B. agaradhaerens, and B. pseudofirmus are tolerant
up to 16% or 17% NaCl [13]. To the best knowledge of
the authors of this paper, no reports have been published
on the isolation of microorganisms able to grow at 20%
or higher NaCl concentrations from ordinary non-saline
soil samples. It has tacitly been believed that habitats of
halophiles able to grow in media containing more than
20% are restricted to saline environments [14,15].

Halophilic bacteria are isolated from soil samples
In the present study, we have demonstrated that halophilic bacteria that are able to grow in the presence of 20%
NaCl are inhabiting almost everywhere in non-saline
environments such as ordinary garden soils, yards, fields
and roadways in an area surrounding Tokyo. We isolated
176 strains, and analysis of partial sequences of their 16S
rRNA genes showed that some of them possessed similarities higher than 94.8% with those of Bacillus haloalkaliphilus [20], Filobacillus milosensis [21], Gracilibacillus
halotolerans [22], Halobacillus karajensis [23], Halobacillus
litoralis [24], Halobacillus trueperi [24], Lentibacillus salicampi [25], Paraliobacillus ryukyuensis [26], Virgibacillus halodenitrificans [27], Virgibacillus marismortui [28] and
Virgibacillus picturae [29]. Most of the strains of these species have been isolated from saline environments, and
were reported to be halophilic, capable of growth at 20%
NaCl. All strains of species of the genera of the family
Bacillacea were endospore formers, except Bacillus saliphilus [30]. Sequences of 15 isolates (14 isolates from
alkaline medium, and one isolated from neutral medium)
showed similarities less than 92% to any deposited
sequences, thus they may represent novel taxa within the
family Bacillaceae. For unknown reason(s), cells of some
colonies on the initial isolation plates failed to grow when
transferred to fresh plates, but grew on plates with lower
NaCl concentrations. Some growth factors present in soil
might be responsible for this phenomenon [31].

A large number of halophilic bacteria of group I (no grow
without added NaCl) were shown to be alkaliphilic, and
most of the group II and III, which grew without added
NaCl, were neutrophilic. The haloalkaliphiles, halophilic
and alkaliphilic bacteria [2], have been found mainly in
extremely alkaline and saline environments, which were
distributed in the Rift Valley lakes of East Africa, soda
lakes of the United States and Inner Mongolia of China,
etc.
Quite interesting is the fact that none of the isolates of
halophilic bacteria showed similarities with any halophilic microorganisms of the classes mentioned above
other than the endospore-forming Bacillus sensu lato.
There remains a possibility, however, that colonies of
halophilic bacteria other than Bacilli on agar plates
unfortunately escaped from being picked up for purification. Another possibility is that those halophilic bacteria
lost the ability to form colonies on the particular agar
plates we used during repeated transfers in the purification procedures, or that they simply did not form colonies
because of unsuitableness of the composition of agar
plates to them.
Are the halophilic Bacilli indigenous to soil?
Spore-formers of the family Bacillaceae were easily isolated
from a number of environments by suspending a sample
in water and heating at 80°C for 10 to 30 min, even from
environments unrelated to their growth requirements. For
example, a thermophile Geobacillus stearothermophilus was
isolated from ordinary soil, and many of the alkaliphilic
Bacillus species have been isolated from soils that were
not particularly alkaline [32]. Now we know that roughly
one tenth of the culturable total bacteria present in ordinary soil were endospore-forming bacteria, only very few
of them were halophilic bacteria, and most of the halophilic bacteria were surviving as endospores. Also, the
exact distribution of so called "soil microorganisms" of
each taxon may fluctuate depending on the soil and also
on season, number of cells of alkaliphiles and methanogens have been shown to be an order of 104 to 105/g of
neutral soil [2,4]. The numbers of endospores of the halophilic bacteria ranged from less than 1 to 500/g in our
experiments. A question is "Are the endospores of halophilic bacteria indigenous to soil, and if not, where did
they come from?" Here we remember that (i) NaCl contents of soil samples taken from near seashore contained
as high as 15–20 mg NaCl/g, whereas the 360 inland soil
samples contained less than 1 mg NaCl/g, and that (ii)
numbers of endospores of halophilic bacteria were almost
the same in the inland soil samples and the seashore sand
samples. These facts strongly suggest that the endospores
of halophilic bacteria are neither from the sea nor from
minute highly saline niche produced by evaporation of
seawater on seashore. Then, where are they from?

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/8

Bacteria in Asian Dust?
Although we have no confirming data at present, we may
speculate that the halophilic bacteria have been transported by westerlies either as vegetative cells or as
endospores from the indigenous highly saline environments, such as salt lakes in Inner Mongolia or salterns
confronting Yellow Sea or East Sea (Japan Sea) in Korea.
In fact, several novel genera and species have been isolated from these areas recently. It has been realized that
Aeolian dust (mineral dust) and sand storms are plaguing
North-East Asia [33]. The storms originate in the arid
inland parts of China and Mongolia and blow across the
Korean peninsula and Japan. It is believed that cold air
masses from Siberia whip deserts and soils eastward after
the dry continental winter. The dusts kicked up into the jet
stream are carried by the prevailing westerlies across
mainland Asia, over the Sea of Japan and Pacific Ocean
and reach into the main land United States in just five
days. It is demonstrated that the dusts reach even to
Hawaii, which is over 6,000 km away [34,35]. China's
sand storms are referred to as Huangsha in China, "Asian
dust" or Whangsa in Korea, and "Yellow sand" or Kosa
event in Japan. The authors of this study believe that
bacteria, at least their endospores, thriving in salt lakes,
soda lakes, and the surrounding saline soils in the arid
region have been kept carried to Japan for thousands of
years together with the mineral dusts. A long-distance
transport of fungal spores by winds across the English
Channel was demonstrated by Hirst et al. [36]

Cells of non-endospore-forming halophilic bacteria and
halophilic archaea (see below) thriving in the saline environments would be flown to Japan by westerlies together
with the endospores, but they would die sooner or later
after they arrive at soil, at least because of the hypotonic
conditions caused by rainfall.
How long have they thrived in soil?
If the above speculation is correct, the next question is "At
what density are there the endospores of halophilic bacteria in the yellow sand and how long do they survive in
soil?" The fact that dusts accumulated for several days after
the last rainfall gave no colonies on 20% NaCl agar plates
suggests that frequencies of the presence of endospores of
halophilic bacteria transported by the westerlies are very
low, and 40 colonies that appeared on the agar plate are
the result of precipitation of the endospores for a very
long time span. Endospores are known to be able to survive for quite a long time, at least several decades, or even
thousands of years. There is a famous case that a
endospore of bacteria closely related to extant Bacillus
sphaericus was revived and cultured from the abdominal
contents of extinct bees preserved for 25 to 40 million
years in buried Dominican amber [37]. An even more
spectacular claim was made that a bacteria closely related

Saline Systems 2005, 1:8

to Virgibacillus marismortui was isolated from fluid inclusions in rock salt crystals of Permian age, over 250 million
years old [38]. Although there is no well-documented data
on the longevity of endospores in the soil, we may expect
they can survive at least for decades.
Halophilic strains of the class Bacilli from non-saline
environments
Recently, several moderately halophilic bacteria, representing novel species of the genus Halobacillus (97.1 to
98.4% similarities to Halobacillus litoralis in the 16S rRNA
gene sequences) were isolated by enrichment culture in a
medium containing 20% NaCl from damaged medieval
wall paintings and building materials in Austria [39]. To
the best knowledge of authors of this paper, this is the
only exception of the isolation of halophilic bacteria from
non-saline environments. Virgibacillus carmonensis, V.
necropolis and V. picturae isolated from samples of biofilm
formation on the mural paintings in Spain [28] are moderately halophilic with optimal growth at NaCl concentration of 5 to 10%, but it is not clear if they are able to grow
at 20% NaCl.

Conclusion
An answer to a question "Are the endospores of halophilic
bacteria indigenous to soil, and if not, where did they
come from?" will be that the endospores of halophilic
bacteria are NOT indigenous to soil, and they are neither
from sea nor from minute highly saline niche produced
by evaporation of seawater on seashore. We may speculate
that the endospores of halophilic bacteria detected in this
study were the results of precipitation in long-term, for
years at least, from atmosphere that have been transported
by westerlies from the indigenous highly saline environments, such as salt lakes in Inner Mongolia or salterns in
Korea.

Methods
Samples of soils, accumulations on roofs etc., and seashore
sands
A total of 360 soil samples were collected in an area (103
km by 126 km) surrounding Tokyo, Japan (Tokyo,
Saitama-, Chiba-, Kanagawa- and Ibaraki- prefecture) (Fig.
1). Each soil sample was taken from surfaces such as gardens, fields, yards and roadways, which was separated
each other by at least 1 km. There exist no highly saline
environments in this region such as salterns and salt lakes.
On the other hands, 6 accumulation samples were taken
from roof of a car, roofs of three buildings, and veranda of
two rooms of building in the campus of Toyo University
or nearby cities. Several samples were also taken from seashore of Tateyama, a city southern part of Chiba-prefecture confronting Tokyo-Bay (Fig. 1). Each soil sample was
collected into 50 ml sterile FALCON tubes (Becton Dick-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/8

inson) with sterile spatula, and kept at room temperature
until use.
Agar media for the isolation of halophilic bacterial and
archaeal strains
A complex growth medium contained the following
ingredients (per liter). 5.0 g casamino acids (Difco), 5.0 g
yeast extract (Difco), 1.0 g sodium glutamate·H2O, 3.0 g
trisodium citrate·2H2O, 2.0 g KCl, 0.2 g MgSO4·7H2O,
36 mg FeCl2·4H2O, 200 g (3.4 M) NaCl and 20 g Bactoagar (Difco), pH 7.2. After autoclaving, pH was adjusted
to 5.0, 7.0 or 9.0 by adding pre-calculated amounts of
diluted sterile H2SO4 or Na2CO3 solutions. Soil samples
(0.5 g each) were placed directly on the three agar plates
of different pH, spread with spatula, and incubated at
37°C for 3 weeks in plastic bags to prevent desiccation.
Colonies were picked up, transferred to fresh agar plates of
the same pH, and pure cultures were obtained by plating
serial dilutions and repeated transfers on agar plates of the
same medium. In some experiments, the agar plates of pH
7.0 and 9.0 were supplemented with 30 µg/ml ampicillin
for the selective isolation of haloarchaeal strains.
Determination of growth range
Growth was determined by inoculating pre-cultures of
purified strains into 30 ml test tubes each containing 3 ml
liquid media with varying NaCl concentrations (0, 0.9,
1.7, 2.6, 3.4, 4.3 and 5.2 M, pH 7 or 9) and pH (5.0, 5.5,
6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5 and 10.0, in the presence of 1.7 M NaCl) and shaken at 37°C with 120 rpm.
Growth was monitored by taking 0.1 ml culture broth
periodically and measuring absorbance at 660 nm.
Measurements of numbers of total bacterial cells,
halophilic bacteria, and endospore-forming bacteria
For the estimation of the numbers of colony forming unit
and halophilic bacteria present in the soil samples, 0.5 g
samples were suspended in 2 ml of distilled water or sterile 10% NaCl solution, diluted serially with the same solution, and 0.1 ml each was spread on agar plates without
added NaCl or of 20% NaCl, respectively, pH 7.0, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 weeks. Separate experiments on 9 soil samples have shown that increasing
concentrations of NaCl of agar plates for colony counting
(0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%) just decreased the number of c.f.u.
The numbers of total endospore-forming bacteria were
determined after heat treatment of the soil suspension at
80°C for 60 min, followed by dilution and spreading on
the plates without added NaCl. Heat resistance of
endospores is known to differ in different strains of Bacillaceae and depends on the NaCl concentration during
heating [40,41].

Spore-staining
Endospore formations of the isolates were examined with
a phase-contrast microscope (×1,000) or after spore-staining according to the method of Wirtz-Conklin [17].
Anaerobic growth
For the detection of anaerobic halophilic bacteria, 5 soil
samples were spread on the agar plates as described above,
and incubated at 37°C in an anaerobic jar using a
deoxygenation reagent, Anaero Pauch Anaero, and
Anaero Pack Rectangular Jar (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical
Co., Inc., Tokyo).
Phylogenetic analysis
Total DNAs were extracted by the method of Cline et al.
[42]. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR and
directly sequenced by using the ABI PRISM® BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems)
with the following forward and reverse primers for Bacteria: 5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' (positions 8–27
according to Escherichia coli numbering) and 5'-GACTACCAGGGTATCTAATC-3' (positions 805–786) on the ABI
PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). In
some experiments, the complete 16S rRNA genes were
amplified by PCR with the forward primer and a reverse
primer: 5'-GGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3' (positions
1510–1492). Archaeal primer sets were 5'-ATTCCGGTTGATCCTGCCGG-3' (positions 6–25 according to E. coli
numbering) and 5'-AGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCAG-3'
(positions 1540–1521). The closest known relatives of the
sequenced organisms were determined by sequence database searches. These sequences and those of known
related strains retrieved from the DNA Data Bank of Japan
[43-45] were aligned using the CLUSTAL W Multiple
Sequence Alignment Program [46]. The phylogenetic tree
was reconstructed by the neighbour-joining method [47]
and was evaluated by bootstrap sampling [48].

Estimation of NaCl contents, pH, and water content of soil
samples
Ten grams of each soil sample was suspended in 100 ml
of distilled water, shaken for 1 h, and supernatants were
obtained by centrifugation. NaCl content in soil samples
was calculated by determining Cl content of the soil
extract by the method of Mohr [49]. The pH of the soil
extract was determined with a pH meter. Water content
was determined by measuring the decrease of weight after
heating 1 g soil sample at 120°C for 1, 2 and 3 hours.
