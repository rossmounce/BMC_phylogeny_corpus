Split-based computation of majority-rule
supertrees
Anne Kupczok1,2

Abstract
Background: Supertree methods combine overlapping input trees into a larger supertree. Here, I consider splitbased supertree methods that first extract the split information of the input trees and subsequently combine this
split information into a phylogeny. Well known split-based supertree methods are matrix representation with
parsimony and matrix representation with compatibility. Combining input trees on the same taxon set, as in the
consensus setting, is a well-studied task and it is thus desirable to generalize consensus methods to supertree
methods.
Results: Here, three variants of majority-rule (MR) supertrees that generalize majority-rule consensus trees are
investigated. I provide simple formulas for computing the respective score for bifurcating input- and supertrees.
These score computations, together with a heuristic tree search minmizing the scores, were implemented in the
python program PluMiST (Plus- and Minus SuperTrees) available from http://www.cibiv.at/software/plumist. The
different MR methods were tested by simulation and on real data sets. The search heuristic was successful in
combining compatible input trees. When combining incompatible input trees, especially one variant, MR(-)
supertrees, performed well.
Conclusions: The presented framework allows for an efficient score computation of three majority-rule supertree
variants and input trees. I combined the score computation with a heuristic search over the supertree space. The
implementation was tested by simulation and on real data sets and showed promising results. Especially the MR(-)
variant seems to be a reasonable score for supertree reconstruction. Generalizing these computations to
multifurcating trees is an open problem, which may be tackled using this framework.

Background
Supertree methods amalgamate trees containing information from different, but overlapping, relationships
into a larger supertree (e.g., [1]). The input trees need
not have the same taxon sets, but the supertree contains
all of the taxa present in at least one of the input trees.
With this property, supertrees are applied to combine
information present in different gene trees to infer relationships about larger sets of taxa (e.g., [2-6]).
Supertree methods can be distinguished by the elementary relationships they extract from the gene trees.
These relationships can be splits (e.g., [7-9]), rooted triplets (e.g., [10-12]) or quartets (e.g., [13,14]). Here, I

focus on split-based supertree methods. A split is a
bipartition of the taxa and a split of a tree corresponds
to an edge in the tree that divides these two sets. Splits
are compatible if they can occur together in a tree.
Otherwise they are incompatible. A subsplit of a supertree split is generated by deleting some taxa from the
taxon set. Thus an input tree split may be subsplit of a
supertree split. The definition of compatibility can also
be applied to splits on overlapping taxon sets, then the
splits are first reduced to the common taxa and subsequently tested for compatibility.
It is natural for split-based supertree methods to first
extract the splits from the input trees and code them
into a matrix representation (see e.g., the splits from G
in Table 1). The most widely applied supertree method
is matrix representation with parsimony (MRP, [7,8]). In
this approach, the matrix representation is interpreted
as a binary alignment and the supertree is the most

parsimonious tree given the alignment. Matrix representation with compatibility (MRC, [9,15]) searches for the
supertree maximizing the number of input splits that
are a subsplit of a supertree split. MRC can also be
understood as the compatibility method [16] applied to
the binary alignment.
The task of summarizing trees on the same taxon set,
the so called consensus setting, is well studied (e.g.,
[17,18]). Supertree methods can be understood as generalizations of consensus methods, that is, when applying
a supertree algorithm in the consensus setting, the result
should then be equivalent to the consensus. One popular consensus method is the majority-rule (MR) consensus, which produces a consensus tree that contains all
splits present in at least half of the input trees. The MR
consensus tree is a median tree under the RobinsonFoulds distance, in that, it is the tree with the smallest
sum of the Robinson-Foulds distances to the input trees
[19]. The Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance of two trees is
the number of splits occurring in each of the trees, but
are not found in the other [20].
Study of the consensus setting may also lead to
important insights for supertree methods. Obviously, if
a supertree method does not fulfill a property in the
consensus setting, the property does not hold in general. For example, Wilkinson et al. [21] studied Pareto
properties. They show that most supertree methods,
including MRC and MRP, are Pareto on splits, i.e. the
supertree contains a split if it is contained in all input
trees. Methods are not co-Pareto on splits, if the
supertree contains splits not supported by any input
tree. E.g. MRC is co-Pareto on splits, but MRP is not.
Some supertree methods show a bias in tree shape
[22]. MRP shows a bias towards unbalanced shapes

which is caused by the asymmetry of the underlying
distance [23].
MRC and MRP can also be seen as median methods
based on an asymmetric distance. The underlying distances are asymmetric since they only evaluate the fit of
the input trees on the supertree and not vice versa.
MRC is a median tree under the asymmetric RF distance, that is, the number of splits that are in the input
tree but not in the pruned supertree. Thus, it generalizes the asymmetric median consensus [24,22]. Analogously, MRP can be interpreted as a median method
based on the asymmetric parsimony distance.
Due to the asymmetric distances, MRC and MRP may
favor relationships contradicting a majority of the input
trees [25]. Cotton and Wilkinson [26] define majority-rule
supertree methods as supertree methods generalizing the
MR consensus. Different variants of MR supertrees exist
and have been investigated. The main division among variants is between MR(-) and MR(+). The first evaluates distances between the pruned supertree and each input tree,
while the second evaluates distances between the supertree
and extended input trees. Here, extension refers to a
method that adds missing taxa onto the input trees. Since
this extension can be defined in multiple ways, multiple
variants of MR(+) supertrees exist [26,27]. MR(+)s supertrees, a variant of MR(+) supertrees, can be solved exactly
with an integer linear programming formulation [28]. MR
(-) supertrees are closely related to RF supertrees [29]
since both evaluate the RF distances between the pruned
supertree and the input trees. Conceptually, there is a
large difference between RF supertrees and MR supertrees.
The aim of the first is to find at least one bifurcating tree
of optimal score [29]. The approach of the latter, in contrast, is to find all trees of optimal score and to summarize
them using the strict consensus method into a potentially
multifurcating supertree. This also allows for labelling the
MR supertree with values of support in the gene trees. By
definition, finding all trees of optimal score also includes
searching over multifurcating trees. Here a first attempt to
solve the problem is performed that only searches for
bifurcating trees of optimal score. From now on, I will also
call these bifurcating trees of optimal score supertrees,
since they contain all taxa from the input trees. They
should not be confused with the MR supertrees that are
obtained after the consensus step and can thus be multifurcating (see next section).
To date, there is only one study comparing the properties of different MR supertree variants [27] and I am
not aware of any study on the performance of different
MR supertree variants. The aim of this paper is to suggest a general framework for the distance computations
underlying the MR supertree methods, to present an
implementation evaluating different distance variants,
and to compare these by simulation.

Results and Discussion

Score computation

I present the computation of majority-rule (MR) supertrees based on bifurcating and unrooted input- and
supertrees. These trees contain only nodes with either
one adjacent edge (the terminal nodes labeled with a
taxon and the adjacent edge is a terminal edge) or with
three adjacent edges (the inner nodes; non-terminal
edges are also called inner edges). If an inner node of a
tree has more than three adjacent edges, the tree is multifurcating. Note that bifurcating trees of n taxa have n 3 inner edges and, in comparison, multifurcating trees
of n taxa have fewer edges.
The Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is only defined for
trees labeled with the same taxa. There are two main
ways to compute the RF distance between a supertree
and an input tree when the input tree may contain only
a subset of the taxa [26]:

1. Prune the supertree to the set of taxa in the input
tree and compare the resulting tree to the input
tree. This distance is called d -.
2. Graft the remaining taxa in all possible ways onto
the input tree, compute all distances, and take the
minimal distance. There are different variants of
grafting taxa onto input trees [27]. Here, two methods are investigated: (1) d+ extends an input tree to
all bifurcating trees by placing additional taxa onto
edges only and by resolving multifurcations in the
input trees; (2) d+ extends an input tree to bifurcatg
ing and multifurcating trees by placing taxa onto
edges or nodes, but does not resolve multifurcations
present in the input tree.
Example distance computations are shown in Figure 1.
The algorithm to compute the distances proceeds as
follows. The matrix representation is a binary coding
of the splits in the input- and supertree (Table 1).
Next, a relationship matrix is computed from this
matrix representation. For each (input split, supertree
split) pair, the relationship matrix has three possible
entries: subsplit; compatible but no subsplit; or
incompatible. The relationship matrix of the example
trees is given in Table 1. From this matrix, it is easy
to see, whether the i-th input split is incompatible to
at least one supertree split, then a binary variable ci is
set to 1. Analogously, a binary variable b j is set to 1,
if the j-th supertree split is incompatible to any input
split. For a bifurcating input tree G and supertree S ,
with nG and n taxa, respectively, the distance computations can then be simplified as follows (see methods
section):

The sum over the distances of all input trees G ∈ P is
called the score of a supertree with the respective supertree method, i.e., the score of S with MR(-) is

also applies to multifurcating input trees (see methods
section).
Here, d + and d+ differ only by the way the taxa are
g
placed because of the restriction to bifurcating input
trees. When computing d+, taxa can only be placed onto
edges, and when computing d+ taxa can be placed onto
g
edges or nodes. Note that MR(+) does not generalize
majority-rule consensus but rather another consensus
method called majority-rule(+) consensus [28,18]. Here,
I deal only with bifurcating input trees. It is easy to see
that MR(+) supertrees also generalize MR consensus in
this case: For bifurcating input trees on the same taxon
set, MR(+) cannot place missing taxa or resolve multifurcations and thus MR(+) directly minimizes the RF
distance to the input trees. Therefore the distinction
between majority-rule consensus and majority-rule(+)
consensus is only important for non-bifurcating input
trees.
Although these respective consensus methods behave
differently in the general case [27], they are equivalent

Kupczok BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:205
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/205

for bifurcating input trees, and I will treat all three
methods, MR(-), MR(+)g, and MR(+) as supertree methods generalizing MR consensus for the remainder of the
paper.
Heuristic algorithm

A heuristic search is necessary to finds upertrees with
the minimal score. The three scores and a heuristic to
search for supertrees with the minimal score were
implemented in the python program PluMiST (Plus and
Minus SuperTrees, available from http://www.cibiv.at/
software/plumist). The program takes bifurcating trees
as input in the case of MR(+) and MR(+)g, and arbitrary
trees in the case of MR(-). The algorithm to compute a
MR supertree proceeds in the following steps (see methods for details):
1. Generation of the starting tree (the starting tree
may also be provided by the user).
2. Supertree computation by minimizing the respective score functions on bifurcating supertrees. A
heuristic tree search using the rearrangement operations TDR (taxa-deletion-reinsertion) and NNI
(nearest-neighbor interchange) is carried out.
3. Strict consensus tree computation of the best
scoring supertrees. The strict consensus contains the
splits present in all supertrees.
4. Contracted consensus tree computation by deletion of splits that are contradicted by ≥ 50% of the
input trees.
The resulting tree, i.e., the contracted consensus tree,
is the MR supertree of the respective MR method. The
last step contracts splits that violate the MR consensus
property. Since the MR consensus tree only contains
splits occurring in > 50% of the trees, it cannot contain
splits contradicting ≥ 50% of the input trees. Note that
this step would be redundant if the tree search was over
multifurcating trees. I will also present results without
the last step of the algorithm. The respective supertree
methods are denoted MR. That means, the MR supertree is the strict consensus tree. The MR methods are
not generalizations of the majority-rule consensus.
Testing

Several simulations were conducted to assess the performance of PluMiST. The methods were also compared
to MRP using PAUP* [30] with the following options:
maximal 1,000,000 trees in memory, 10 replications, and
TBR branch swapping.
Simulation with compatible input trees

This setting is similar to the setting used in [15]. However, I use different model trees generated under a Yule
model [31] and subsequently prune a fraction of taxa
randomly from ten input trees. If the pruning step

Page 4 of 13

deleted the same taxon from each input tree, the data
set was discarded and a new data set was generated
instead. Thus each taxon had to be present in at least
one input tree. I use the following parameter settings:
The number of taxa is 32 or 64, and the fraction of
deleted taxa in each input tree is 25% or 50%. 100 replicates are performed for each of the four possible
combinations.
An MR method is successful if a score of 0 is found
and the resulting strict consensus tree contains only
splits present in the true tree. Note that this definition
of success differs from the one in [15]. In their case, the
method is successful only if the true tree was the only
supertree. However, I think that a method should not
return only one best scoring tree if some nodes cannot
be resolved. Multiple trees with a score of 0 are clearly
an indication that some nodes cannot be resolved. In
the simulations, there was no check for sufficient overlap between the input trees. Different measures for this
criterion exist (e.g., [32,33]). If there is not sufficient
overlap, then the supertree cannot be expected to be
reconstructed without ambiguity and this should be
reflected by multiple supertrees.
With this criterion of success, all three MR methods
and MRP were successful in all cases and under all
parameter settings. Furthermore, in each simulation, all
three MR methods returned the same number of trees.
PAUP* may return more trees since it also returns unresolved trees if they have the same parsimony length.
However, in all cases, where PAUP* returned more
trees, the strict consensus tree (i.e., the supertree) was
the same as for PluMiST. With a deletion probability
of 0.25, more than one optimal tree is found only three
and two times with 32 and 64 taxa, respectively. In
these cases the resulting supertree had one split missing.
With a deletion probability of 0.5, substantially more
optimal trees were found which resulted in more multifurcating trees (Figure 2). On average, trees with n = 32
contain 24.9 inner splits (instead of 29 for a bifurcating
tree) and with n = 64, there are 53.9 inner splits (instead
of 61).
Simulation with incompatible input trees

I use the same model trees and input trees as in the
previous section. However, the input trees were modified such that each internal edge undergoes a nearestneighbor interchange (NNI [34]) with probability pnni
and stays the same with probability 1-p nni . The two
alternative NNIs are equally likely. The results for n =
32 and p nni of 0.1 and 0.2, respectively, are shown in
Figure 3.
Since MRP usually performed well in these simulations, its average distance is used as a baseline and I
report to what amount the MR methods exceed it. The
results for MR(-) are generally comparable to the results

for MRP. The difference in the mean distances is less
than 0.8% for MR( - ) and less than 0.5% for MR(-) and
all simulations with n = 32. In contrast, for the most difficult simulation (Figure 3d), the mean distances for MR
(+)g and MR(+)g exceed the ones for MRP by 1% and
0.8%, respectively, and the mean distances for MR(+)
and MR(+) exceed the mean distance for MRP by 3.2%
each. The methods show differences when only the
number of missing splits is considered: The average
number of missing splits for MR(-), MR( - ), MR(+)g,
and MR(+)g increases the average for MRP by less then
0.7% each. In contrast, MR(+) and MR(+) miss up to
1.8% more of the true splits.
MR(-) rarely finds more incorrect splits than MRP.
MR(-) and MR( - ) do not find more incorrect splits on
average for pnni = 0.1, and 0.1% more for pnni = 0.2. In
contrast, MR(+)g and MR(+)g find up to 1.9% more
incorrect splits, while MR(+) and MR(+) find up to 0.8%
more incorrect splits.
Sequence simulation

PluMiST was also incorporated into a supertree simulation pipeline [35]. Two simulation settings were carried out: a small simulation with 25 taxa, 10 input trees,
and on average 37.5% of the taxa deleted and a large
simulation with 69 taxa, 254 input trees, and on average
84.2% of the taxa deleted. Here I present the results for
the simplest setting where the true gene trees are subtrees of the species tree and the simulation parameters
are the same for all genes. Input trees were generated

distances are normalized by dividing by the maximal distances, that
is, 2n - 6 for the RF distance and n - 3 for the other two distances.

by maximum likelihood reconstruction from simulated
alignments. 500 simulated data sets were evaluated for
the small simulation and 200 for the large simulation.
In contrast to the previous simulations, I conducted
ten independent replicates for all MR supertree

computations and combined trees with the best score
over all runs into the final supertree. However, these
results were very similar compared to taking one run
only (data not shown). Thus, I conclude that the combined search heuristic of TDR and NNI is a sufficient
exploration of the tree space in these simulations and
report and discuss the results for one run only.
The results for the small simulation (Figure 4a) are
similar to the results from the previous section: MR(-)
has a slightly higher distance than MRP: 10.9% compared to 10.8%; MR(+)g and MR(+) have higher distances of 11.5% and 12%, respectively. The differences
between the MR methods are more pronounced in the
large simulation (Figure 4b). Here, MR(-) (average distance of 5.1%) clearly outperforms MR(+)g (10.2%) and
MR(+) (15.8%). In both simulations, the MR -versions of
the MR methods resulted in the same trees.
Furthermore, MR(-) clearly improves another MRC
implementation (Clann version 3.0.2 [36] with the sfit
criterion, SPR search, nsteps = 3, maxswaps =
1000000, 1 repetition). In the large simulation, MR(-)
also outperforms MRP (6.5%). Both the percentage of
missing splits (7.1% with MR(-) compared to 8.6% with
MRP) and of incorrect splits (3% compared to 4.3%)
improves.
There are two main reasons why different methods
might reconstruct different trees: the scoring function
and the search heuristic. To evaluate whether the difference in the scoring functions can explain the distance
differences observed for the large simulation (Figure 4b),
the trees of all four methods, MRP, MR(-), MR(+)g, and
MR(+) were scored with the other objective functions. If
a method found multiple trees, all trees were scored and
the minimum was taken. In > 90% of the cases the MR
(+) supertree had a smaller MR(+) score than any other
supertree, and this also holds for MR(+)g. MRP and MR
(-) supertrees also usually have a smaller parsimony
lengths and MR(-) scores, respectively, than the MR(+)g
and MR(+) trees (> 99% of the cases). In 31% of the
cases the parsimony lengths of the MRP and MR(-)
supertree were equal and in 31.5% the MR(-) scores of
both methods were equal. It was never observed that

Page 6 of 13

another method found a lower parsimony or MR(-)
score than the respective supertree methods. However,
for MR(+), at least one method resulted in a better MR
(+) score in 6.5% of the cases. In 0.5% of the cases, one
MR(+) supertree had a better MR(+)g score than the
MR(+)g supertree.
To summarize, supertrees from different methods
usually vary in their scores when evaluated with one
objective function (MRP, MR(-), MR(+)g, or MR(+)).
The search heuristics implemented in PAUP* and PluMiST usually find better scores for the respective objective functions compared to the supertrees found with
the other methods.
Evaluation of real data sets

The program was also applied to real data sets and
compared with MRP using PAUP*. First, two data sets
also used in Bansal et al. [29] were analyzed (available
from [37]). The seabirds data set [38] contains rooted
trees, thus an outgroup taxon was added to the trees.
The mammals data set contains “semi-rooted” trees
[39], i.e., not all trees are rooted and an outgroup taxon
is already present in some of the input trees. Some trees
were discarded from the mammal data set since they
contain no inner splits and thus no information for MR
supertrees or MRP. Since both data sets contain some
multifurcating input trees, only MR(-) was evalutated.
The results are summarized in Table 2. The high
number of optimal trees for the seabirds data set had
already been reported [38]. This slows down the last
part of the PluMiST algorithm, because equally scoring
trees are explored by NNI. The RF supertree method
[29] finds a score of 61, but only 4 trees of the optimal
score for this data set. This score also corresponds to
the optimal MR(-) score of 23, but PluMiST finds 1538
optimal trees. The runtime of RF supertrees is substantially lower than the runtime of PluMiST or PAUP* for
two reasons. First, efficient heuristics use the root information, and second, the search does not continue to
find multiple optimal trees.
The mammal data set has different optima depending
on whether the MRP or the MR(-) criterion is used
(Table 2). The full data set could not be analyzed with

Figure 4 Results with sequence simulation. The mean of the data is displayed by “+”.

RF supertrees since not all trees are rooted. Lastly, a
microbial data set containing 61 taxa and 1117 genes
was analyzed [40]. Bootstrap resampling of the gene
trees and computing MRC using Clann had resulted in
a highly multifurcating majority-rule consensus tree
[40]. The data set consists of bifurcating unrooted trees
and I applied it to the three majority-rule supertree
methods and to MRP. All supertrees are completely or
nearly completely resolved (Figure 5). There are clear
differences in the scores of the optimal trees when evaluated with other scoring functions (Table 3). None of
the trees matches a recent reference phylogeny completely (Figure 5e, Figure 1 in [41]). All of the nine groupings marked by different colors in Figure 5 are present
in the MR(-) and in the MRP tree. Both of the MR(+)
variants nest the Betaproteobacteria inside the Gammaproteobacteria. The branching order of these groupings
also shows some deviations from the reference tree.
First, most of the groupings with only one member in
the data set are not correctly placed in any tree: Aquifex
aeolicus is never a sister of the Epsilonproteobacteria,
Chlorobium tepidum is never a sister of the Chlamydiae,
the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis is never a sister of the
Actinobacteria, and Deinococcus radiodurans is never
basal. Because of these problems, the information about
groupings with one member only are ignored in the following points. Second, the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria form a clade in all trees, but the
Epsilonproteobacteria are not their sister group. In the
MR(-) and MR(+) tree, the Epsilonproteobacteria form a
clade with the Chlamydiae and in the MR(+)g tree, they
form a clade with the Chlamydiae and the Tenericutes.
In the MRP tree, they are basal to a clade of Chlamydiae and the other Proteobacteria. Third, in both the
MR(-) and the MRP tree, the Firmicutes do not cluster
with the Actinobacteria but with the Tenericutes. Only
in the MRP tree, the clade of Tenericutes, Firmicutes
and Actinobacteria is basel to the other Bacteria. In the
MR(-) tree, the clade of Epsilonproteobacteria and Chlamydiae is basal and in the MR(+)g tree a clade of these

two and the Tenericutes is basal. The MR(+) tree has
more differences; even the Archaea are not
monophyletic.
Taken together there are serious problems in the data
set, when groups have only one member. The fewest
contradictions to the reference tree are present in the
MRP tree followed by the MR(-) tree. Note that the
deep branching of the bacterial phylogeny and the
meaningfulness of a search for a tree like pattern in
Bacteria is hotly debated (e.g., [42-45]). Here, the microbial data set is presented as an example how different
methods resolve conflict among the input trees and not
as a statement about the “true” bacterial phylogeny.

Conclusions
I present a new framework for the computation of the
distances underlying majority-rule supertrees. The basis
of this framework is the relationship matrix that stores
the possible relationships between an input tree split
and a supertree split: subsplit, compatibility, or incompatibility. The distance computations for MR(-), MR(+)
g, and MR(+) are presented for bifurcating input- and
supertrees. The distance computation of MR(-) also
applies to multifurcating input trees.
These distance computations are implemented in the
python program PluMiST. The program was tested in
a simulation study with different settings, in particular
with compatible and incompatible input trees. With
compatible input trees, all MR methods find a score of
0 and the same supertree as MRP and I thus conclude
that all methods search the tree space successfully. With
incompatible input trees, the results for MR(-) are best,
especially when both missing and incorrect splits are
taken into account. MR(+)g might miss less splits than
MR(-), however it also finds more incorrect splits.
Reconstructing incorrect splits which give rise to false
conclusions is obviously a more serious problem compared to the exclusion of some splits.
The RF distance to the true tree is often decreased by
including splits contradicted by a majority of the input

trees (i.e., skipping the last step of the algorithm, denoted
by MR). This holds particularly when only a few taxa are
deleted and the input trees are highly incongruent (25% of
the taxa deleted and pnni = 0.2). While the MR methods
are not a generalization of MR consensus anymore, they
may still be useful supertree methods. Given that MR( - )
is equivalent to MRC for bifurcating supertrees, PluMiST
can then also be used as a heuristic for MRC.

input trees, trees of different sizes and different amounts

of missing data and sequence simulation, MR(-) performed very well. It outperformed the MRC implementation in Clann and also MRP for the large data set.
Those differences can be traced back to the differences
in the objective functions in PAUP* and PluMiST. The
trees found with the respective objective function
usually have better scores compared to the supertrees
found with other methods.
This is also observed when analyzing biological data sets.
Of the three data sets analyzed, two contain multifurcating
input trees, and therefore only MR(-) was compared to
MRP and to RF supertrees. For one data set with rooted
input trees the score of MR(-) was equivalent to the score
to RF supertrees, but MR(-) finds more optimal trees. The
microbial data set contains bifurcating trees and was analyzed with all three majority-rule supertree methods. The
MR(-) tree recovered more relationships present in the
reference tree compared to the MR(+) variants.
In conclusion, the objective function of MR(-) performs best among the MR supertree methods studied

Kupczok BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:205

here. Note that this objective function is also justified in
the likelihood setting [46]. The MR(+) supertree methods add taxa to the input trees and apply a consensus.
At first view, this approach seems to be a natural
method for dealing with the supertree problem. However, phylogenetic signal may be confounded by properties of the complex tree space [47].
The problem of distance computations in the general
case of multifurcating trees is still open but I suppose
that formulas for these cases can be constructed based
on the relationship matrix. The generalization of these
computations to multifurcating supertrees is an important task. The proof for majority-rule consensus trees
[19] only holds for multifurcating consensus trees and
was the motivation for majority-rule supertrees [26].
Note that another variant of MR(+), MR(+)s supertrees,
can be computed via the span and the consensus step
and thus also includes multifurcating trees [28].
The current implementation of MR(-) in PluMiST is
similar to the RF supertree method. The approach of
Bansal et al. [29] is, however, to find at least one tree of
the optimal score and not to search for equal scoring
trees. This latter property is needed for MR supertrees.
This, in addition to the heuristics for rooted trees,
makes the RF supertree method fast. In contrast, the
advantage of MR(-) is that input trees can be unrooted
and that the area around the optimum is searched for
equally scoring trees.
Furthermore, PluMiST and the theory presented here
comprises a general framework for MR supertrees. The
relationships between the distance functions underlying
these methods will hopefully help in understanding the
similarities and differences of the methods. Simulations
show that MR(-) usually performs very well, in particular in comparison with the established MRP method
and is thus recommended for majority-rule supertree
reconstruction.

Methods
Phylogenetic Background

A (phylogenetic) tree is a leaf-labeled tree and is thus
identified by its leaf set X and its edge set (for details
and terminology see also [48]). The leaves are usually
called taxa. Terminal edges connect a leaf with an inner
node and inner edges connect two inner nodes. I present the computation for unrooted trees. This computation can easily be applied to rooted trees by treating the
root as an additional taxon. In unrooted trees there is
no node of degree two.
If an edge of a phylogenetic tree is deleted, the tree
decomposes into two connected components. Thus, the
taxon set is then partitioned into two sets (X1 and X2),
one for each component. Such a bipartition is called a
split and is denoted by X1|X2. Since each edge in a tree

Page 9 of 13

corresponds to a split, a tree on taxon set X is identified
by the corresponding split set (see example in Figure 1,
note that the taxon sets in a split can be shortly written
as a string of concatenated taxa).
Two splits are called compatible if there is a phylogenetic
tree containing both splits. This holds for two splits X1|X2
and Y1 |Y2 if at least one of the following taxon sets is
empty: X1 ∩ Y1, X1 ∩ Y2, X2 ∩ Y1 or X2 ∩ Y2. Note that
terminal splits are compatible to any other split. An
unrooted phylogenetic tree of n taxa contains at most n - 3
inner splits. If it contains exactly n - 3 inner splits, all inner
nodes have degree three, and the tree is called bifurcating,
or multifurcating otherwise. An inner node of degree three
is a taxon tripartition and can be written as X1|X2|X3.
A tree T1 displays a tree T2 if it contains all splits of
T2, i.e., T2 ⊆ T1. The Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance of
two trees is defined as the symmetric difference of the
split sets [20]: RF(T1, T2) = | T1\T2 | + | T2\T1|. Note
that if both trees are bifurcating, then both set sizes are
equal and RF is an even number.
A supertree S for a set of input trees P is a tree that
contains exactly the taxa occurring in at least one input
XG. Thus in general XG ⊆ XS. The
tree, i.e. XS =
G∈P

following abbreviations are used: n = |XS | and nG = |XG |.
The splits in G are called partial if XG ⊂ XS. In contrast,
the splits in S are called plenary. A partial split
g ∈ G (g = Y1 |Y2 ) is a subsplit of a plenary split
s ∈ S (s = Z1 |Z2 ) if one of the following conditions
holds: (Y1 ⊆ Z1 and Y2 ⊆ Z2) or (Y1 ⊆ Z2 and Y2 ⊆ Z1).
For example, the split ABC|F is a subsplit of the split
ABC|DEF. Two splits on different taxon sets will be
called compatible if they are compatible on the set of
taxa occurring in both trees and incompatible otherwise.
S |XG is the restriction of tree S to taxon set XG, i.e.,
S |XG = {A ∩ XG |B ∩ XG : A|B ∈ S and A ∩ XG = ∅, B ∩ XG = ∅}.
Consensus methods

Consensus methods combine input trees on the same
taxon set. There are many consensus methods available
[17], some of which are based on the split sets of the
input trees:
Strict consensus The strict consensus contains all
G.
splits present in all input trees, i.e., T =
G∈P

Majority-rule consensus The majority-rule (MR)
consensus contains all splits present in more than half
of the input trees.
Distance computations for MR supertrees

The majority-rule supertree methods were defined to
minimize a particular score [26,27]:

As for majority-rule consensus trees, the majority-rule
supertree is the strict consensus of all potentially multifurcating trees that minimize the distance. Here, the
tree search is restricted to bifurcating trees. In the following I show, that for bifurcating input- and supertrees
the distance computations can be simplified. Therefore
assume that S is already modified as follows: If there is
an inner split X1 |X2 ∈ S with Xi ⊆ XS \XG and there is
no split Y1 |Y2 ∈ S with Xi ⊂ Yj ⊆ XS \XG, then replace
the subtree spanned by the the taxa in Xi by a dummy
taxon (i, j Î {1, 2}). For d- this modification will make
no difference, since the dummy taxon is deleted again.
For d + and d+ only this dummy taxon needs to be
g
placed in G. Afterwards it could be expanded again
without any cost. This modification ensures that in the
optimal G ∈ G each taxon was added to an edge
already existing in G (analogous for G g). The modified
example tree is shown in Figure 6.
A matrix representation is a binary coding of the
splits, an example is shown in Table 4. Furthermore, the
relationship
matrix
of
dimension
(2nG − 3) × (n + nG − 3) is used, which indicates for
each pair of input-and supertree splits, whether they are
subsplit; compatible but no subsplit; or incompatible.
Only inner splits and trivial splits for XG are included
(see Table 4). Note that for bifurcating trees there cannot be a split compatible to all other splits in the relationship matrix. Thus each line and row, respectively,
must contain either at least one s or at least one i.

d− (S , G ) = RF(G , S ) = |G \S | + |S \G | = 2 × |G \S |.
Since both trees are bifurcating, each g ∈ G must be
either identical or incompatible to a split in S . Thus
|G \S | measures the number of splits in G that are
incompatible to a split in S . Each g ∈ G that is incompatible to a split in S , is also incompatible to a split in
S , since incompatibility can only be caused by the taxa
in XG. Thus |G \S | is the number of splits in G that are
incompatible to a split in S . ■
Note The formula easily generalizes to multifurcating
input trees: Assume that G has m multifurcations, i.e.,
nG − m − 3 inner branches. Then d - = 2C + m, there
are C splits in G that conflict with S , C splits in S that
conflict with G, and in addition m splits in S that are
missing in G. Since m is constant for all supertrees, the
objective function is equivalent to the one for bifurcating input trees.
Note, that C can be easily computed from the rela-

tionship matrix since C =

Theorem 2 Given a bifurcating supertree S and a
bifurcating input tree G. Then d+ = B + C, where B is the
g
number of splits in S that are incompatible to at least
one split in G and C is the number of splits in G that
are incompatible to at least one split in S .
Proof Both inequalities are shown. The idea of the
proof is to show that C = |G \S | and B = |S \G | for one
G ∈ G g. Since B ≥ C, |S \G | ≥ |G \S |, this is accomplished by potentially introducing multifurcations when
placing taxa onto G.
B + C ≤ d+ For all G ∈ G g : C ≤ |G \S | and
g
B ≤ |S \G |. Thus this inequality holds for all G .
d+ ≤ B + C Need to construct a G ∈ G g with
g
|S \G | + |G \S | ≤ B + C.
First, S = S |XG , RF(S , G ) = 2C. It is shown now that
the taxa in XS \XG can be placed onto S and G and thus
increase the distance by not more than B - C. Therefore,
d+ ≤ 2C + B − C = B + C. n T = n - n G taxa have to be
g
placed onto G to get G . There will be ngood “good” taxa
that are placed onto edges without introducing an
increase in the distance; and n bad “bad” taxa that are
placed onto nodes and will increase the distance by one;
nT = ngood + nbad.
Each supertree split can only be a supersplit of at most
one input split. If it is a supersplit of an input split, it is
compatible to all others. An input split may be a subsplit
of different supertree splits. If it is a subsplit of > 1 supertree split, each additional supertree split gives information
about the placement of one taxon. e.g., the input split A|B
may be a subsplit of the supertree splits AX|B and A| XB
(A and B are taxon sets, X is a taxon). Then X is a “good”
taxon and placed on the edge between A and B without

procedure is B − C. B and C represent the respective number of columns and rows in the relationship matrix that
have a subsplit entry.
In each row and column of the matrix, there must be
either at least one subsplit entry (s) or at least one

incompatibility entry (i). Thus C + C = 2nG − 3 and

nT − (B − C) = n − nG − (n + nG − 3 − B) + 2nG − 3 − C = B − C.

These B - C bad taxa can be placed on a node increasing d+ by one. In detail, the two splits in S that are adjag
cent to the terminal split of the bad taxon will be
incompatible with at least one split in G. As a result the
bad taxon can be placed on any of the nodes adjacent
to a conflicting split in G. The resulting distance is not
larger than 2C + (B - C) = B + C. ■

1 (taxon E). g 3 is a subsplit of both s1 and s5 , thus A’
can be placed on the terminal edge leading to C without
conflict. s2 and s3 are adjacent to the terminal split of E.
They are conflicting with g1 and thus E can be placed
either on the node D|F|CGH or on the node C|DF |GH.

Theorem 3 Given a bifurcating supertree S and a bifurcating input tree G. Then d+ = 2B, where B is the number

Proof The proof is a modification of the proof for
Theorem 2. The “good” taxa are placed in the same way
and the bad taxa are placed onto any split corresponding
to a conflicting split in G. The resulting distance is then
2C + 2(B - C) = 2B. ■
Heuristic algorithm
Starting tree

The tree search starts with a step-wise addition tree. A
random taxa order is processed the following way: The

quartet toplogy for the first four taxa is determined by
the topolgy most frequent among the input trees. The
remaining n - 4 taxa are inserted step by step to the
partially reconstructed tree. For each of the remaining
taxa, the informative input trees are determined. These
trees contain the considered taxon and at least 3 of the
taxa already inserted. Afterwards, the best insertion
point of the terminal branch labeled with the taxon is
determined: If the objective function is d-, then the sum
of d- is computed for each insertion point. This is done
by pruning the supertrees and the input trees to the
common taxon sets. If the objective function is d+, for
each split in the supertree the number of input trees it
contradicts is determined. The insertion point minimizes the sum of the split contradictions. This method
does not ensure d+ since taxa are missing in both trees.
If the objective function is d+, both types of insertion
g
strategies are carried out alternatingly, i.e., for each
insertion only one of the strategies is used. In all cases
ties are resolved randomly.
Optimization step

The tree search allows for two rearrangement operations: Taxa-deletion-reinsertion (TDR) and nearestneighbor interchange (NNI). Given a tree, TDR deletes
a given fraction of the taxa randomly (by default 0.25).
Afterwards, a random taxon order of the deleted taxa is
determined and the taxa are reinserted via the step-wise
addition strategy. An NNI operation takes a split of a
tree and generates the two alternative splits that could
replace it. If replacing the split with one of these splits
would result in a supertree with a lower score, the split
is replaced. Alternative best trees are also returned.
The tree search proceeds in two stages: The first
exploration stage lasts at most l2 iterations, where l is
the number of inner splits in a supertree and an iteration is an NNI or a TDR operation. First, all splits of
the starting tree are optimized by NNI until there is no
further improvement. Next, the tree space is explored
by TDR. After one TDR operation, all splits of the new
tree are optimized by NNI again. It may happen that a

TDR operation generates a tree that it found before or
that yield no improvement with NNI. Then this tree is
√
discarded and a new tree is generated with TDR. If l
2
trees were discarded consecutively or l iterations
passed, the broadening stage starts. At this point, all
optimal trees that have not been analyzed before, are
optimized by NNI. This mainly ensures that all trees in
the optimal region are found.
In the end, all optimal trees are summarized by a
strict consensus and splits that are contradicted by ≥
50% of the input trees are deleted. In these trees, the
internal nodes are labeled with support values similar to
those of majority-rule consensus trees. Each inner node
is labeled with x/y, where x is the number of input trees
not contradicting the corresponding split and y is the
number of input trees where a nontrivial split supports
the corresponding split. Thus, y is the number of input
trees that support the node and x - y is the number of
input trees that are irrelevant for that node with the
definitions of support and irrelevance used in [49].
