Abstract
Background: Conger eel galectins, congerin I (ConI) and congerin II (ConII), show the different molecular
characteristics resulting from accelerating evolution. We recently reconstructed a probable ancestral form of
congerins, Con-anc. It showed properties similar to those of ConII in terms of thermostability and carbohydrate
recognition specificity, although it shares a higher sequence similarity with ConI than ConII.
Results: In this study, we have focused on the different amino acid residues between Con-anc and ConI, and have
performed the protein engineering of Con-anc through site-directed mutagenesis, followed by the molecular
evolution analysis of the mutants. This approach revealed the functional importance of loop structures of
congerins: (1) N- and C-terminal and loop 5 regions that are involved in conferring a high thermostability to ConI;
(2) loops 3, 5, and 6 that are responsible for stronger binding of ConI to most sugars; and (3) loops 5 and 6, and
Thr38 residue in loop 3 contribute the specificity of ConI toward lacto-N-fucopentaose-containing sugars.
Conclusions: Thus, this methodology, with tracing of the molecular evolution using ancestral mutants, is a
powerful tool for the analysis of not only the molecular evolutionary process, but also the structural elements of a
protein responsible for its various functions.

Background
Molecular evolution refers to the evolutionary process at
the macromolecular level, such as at the DNA, RNA,
and protein levels. It encompasses the reconstruction of
the evolutionary history of organisms and macromolecules (i.e., molecular phylogeny) on the basis of the
sequence data of nucleic acids and proteins. The primary event in molecular evolution is a mutational
change in genes that may be caused by the substitution
or insertion/deletion of a nucleotide, recombination,
etc.; otherwise, in general, DNA sequences are copied
exactly during the process of chromosome replication.
Subsequently, they spread in a population by genetic
drift and/or natural selection, and eventually get established in a species [1,2]. Thus, the evolutionary history
over a period of multibillion years has its basis in the
DNA. To understand the molecular evolution of proteins in nature, we usually refer to the relationships and

rates of changes in the sequence data inferred from proteins identified so far. More recent advances in bioinformatics and structural biology, besides recombinant
protein expression techniques, have enabled us to analyze the molecular evolution of proteins more directly,
explore the evolutionary strategies of natural proteins,
and generate novel tailor-made proteins.
Galectins are defined as proteins having at least one
characteristic carbohydrate-recognition domain with Ca2
+
-independent affinity for b-galactoside, and they share
certain conserved sequence elements [3]. To date, 15
galectins have been identified in mammals. They are
involved in many biological phenomena, including cell
adhesion, differentiation, morphogenesis, innate immunity, apoptosis, and metastasis of malignant cells [4-8].
Furthermore, the members of the galectin family have
been isolated from a large variety of metazoan phyla,
from invertebrates such as nematodes, insects, and
sponges to vertebrates such as fish and chicken, as well
as mammals [9,10]. On the basis of their structures,

galectins are classified into three types: proto-, chimera-,
and tandem repeat-type galectins [11].
Conger eel (Conger myriaster) contains two proto-type
galectins, namely, congerin I (ConI) and congerin II
(ConII) in the skin mucus [12,13]. ConI and ConII consist of 136 and 135 amino acid residues, respectively,
and both contain acetylated N-termini [13,14]. However,
they have no cysteine residue that is related to oxidizing
inactivation found in some galectins of higher vertebrates. Congerins are considered to participate in the
host defense against infectious agents, such as bacteria
and parasites. For example, ConI and ConII mainly exist
in the frontier organs and tissues that delineate the
body from the outer environment, such as the epidermal
club cells of the skin, wall of the oral cavity, pharynx,
esophagus, and gills; in addition, they also exhibit agglutination activity against the marine pathogen, Vibrio
anguillarum [12,15,16]. Moreover, it was recently
reported that congerins can exert opsonic effects and
can reach the intestinal lumen without enzymatic digestion [17,18].
The molecular evolutionary and X-ray crystallography
analyses of ConI and ConII revealed that they have
evolved in an accelerating manner, resulting in the
emergence of new structures, including the strand-swap
structure and a unique carbohydrate-binding site; this in
turn resulted in a unique carbohydrate-binding ability
[15,19-22]. We recently reconstructed a probable ancestral form of congerin (Con-anc) and found that it
showed properties similar to those of ConII in terms of
thermostability and carbohydrate-recognition specificity,
except for a2,3-sialyl galactose, although Con-anc was
observed to share a higher sequence similarity with
ConI than ConII [23]. This indicates that only the 31
different amino acid residues between ConI and Conanc are involved in conferring the characteristics of
ConI, which are acquired during its adaptive molecular
evolution from Con-anc. To identify the determinants of
selection pressures in the evolutionary process and the
structural elements associated with the unique carbohydrate-binding activities of ConI, in the present study, we
focused on the different amino acid residues between
Con-anc and ConI, and conducted a dissection analysis
using the chimera mutants of Con-anc and ConI, tracing its evolutionary history to ConI.

Results and Discussion
Design and preparation of the chimeric mutants of Conanc and ConI

As the N- and C-terminal regions located at the intersubunit interface of the congerins and L5 region
involved in the formation of the lactose-binding site are
different for ConI and Con-anc (Figure 1A), first, the
N-and C-termini and the L5 regions of Con-anc were

Page 2 of 14

mutagenized. Thus, the following 3 Con-anc mutants
were prepared: (1) Con-anc-N/C, in which the N- and
C-termini were substituted with the corresponding residues of ConI; (2) Con-anc-L5, in which the L5 region
was substituted with the corresponding sequence of
ConI; and (3) Con-anc-N/C/L5, which had mutations of
both Con-anc-N/C and Con-anc-L5 (Figure 1B). As the
binding ability of Con-anc-N/C/L5 was only 30%-40% of
that of ConI (described later), the other structural elements responsible for the strong binding activity of
ConI, namely, L6 and L3 (Thr38), located at the carbohydrate-binding cleft, were also investigated (Figure 1A).
Thus, the Con-anc mutants, in which the L6 and L3
regions were substituted with the corresponding
sequences of ConI, i.e., Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6, Con-ancN/C/L5/L3, and Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6/L3 (Figure 1B),
were prepared, and their carbohydrate-binding activities
were determined by frontal affinity chromatography
(FAC). To analyze the molecular evolutionary relationship among the ancestral mutants and ConI, the phylogenetic tree including the chimera mutants between
Con-anc and ConI was constructed (Figure 2). The tree
branched out from the node of each mutant with zero
distance, suggesting that the chimera mutants are
hypothetical ancestral mutants of ConI on molecular
evolution.
Thermostability of Con-anc and mutants

Figure 3 shows the thermostabilities of ConI, ConII,
and Con-anc and its mutants. Interestingly, all mutants,
i.e., Con-anc-N/C, Con-anc-L5, and Con-anc-N/C/L5,
possessed higher thermostabilities than Con-anc; Conanc-N/C/L5, in particular, showed a high stability, comparable with that of ConI. The half-activity retention
temperature (T m )–the temperature at which 50%
hemagglutination activity was retained after 30 min of
incubation–of Con-anc and ConII were 44 and 46°C,
respectively. On the other hand, Con-anc-N/C and Conanc-L5 showed a ~2°C higher Tm value (48°C) than that
of Con-anc, and Con-anc-N/C/L5 showed a 6°C higher
Tm value (52°C) than that of Con-anc, but were comparable with that of ConI. These results indicate that the
N- and C-terminal regions along with the L5 region of
ConI are involved in conferring high thermostability,
although the N- and C-terminal regions are located at
the inter-subunit interface and are involved in the
strand-swap structure of ConI. Substitutions of amino
acid residues at the N- and C-termini, namely, E5Q,
K12T, A118F, N120P, and F132L, may stabilize the
strand-swap structure, making it comparable with that
of ConI. The strand swapping (or domain swapping) is a
motivity of quaternary structure formation in protein
evolution; a protein becomes multimeric by donating a
part (b strand) of the molecule to a cognate molecule

and the number of inter-subunit hydrogen bonds,
resulting the enhancement of its dimeric stability and its
cross-linking activity [19]. Thus, the N- and C-terminal
regions contribute to the dimeric stability associated
with the hemagglutinating activity, although it is not
clear whether Con-anc adopts the strand-swap conformation or not. Meanwhile, substitution of the L5 region
of Con-anc with the corresponding sequence of ConI
conferred a more hydrophilic property to L5, as demonstrated by the hydropathy values of the L5 regions of
Con-anc (LNSMVNS) and ConI (MNSTLKGDN), which
were estimated to be 1.3 and -10.6, respectively [24]. In
general, the hydrophilic residues on the surface of proteins are believed to increase thermostability [25-27].

and then accepting the corresponding portion from the
cognate. The strand-swap in ConI is a variation of
domain swapping, because the conformation of the
swapped strands is changed from anti-parallel (in Con
II) to parallel (in Con I). The strand-swap structure in
ConI increases the inter-subunit contact surface area

The carbohydrate-binding specificities and activities of
ConI, ConII, and Con-anc and its mutants, namely, Conanc-N/C, Con-anc-L5, Con-anc-N/C/L5, Con-anc-N/C/
L5/L6, Con-anc-N/C/L5/L3, and Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6/L3,
all of which were determined by FAC, are summarized in
Table 1. In the previous report [23], we demonstrated
that the sugar-binding specificity of Con-anc-L5 was
similar to that of ConII, except for the specific oligosaccharides including lacto-N-biosyl (Galb1-3GlcNAc) or
lacto-N-neobiosyl (Galb1-4GlcNAc) moieties, especially,
lacto-N-fucopentaose-II (LNFP-II, Lewis a (Lea)) (#44),
lacto-N-difucohexaose (LNDFH, Leb) (#46), and A-heptasaccharide (#48). However, in the present work, we have
demonstrated increased carbohydrate-binding activity of

Ratios of Ka (1/Kd) values of congerins and their mutants to those of Con-anc and ConI were calculated. PA sugar numbers are provided in Additional File 3:
Supplemental Figure S1.

Con-anc-N/C/L5 with respect to almost all sugars, when
compared with those of Con-anc. Although the binding
affinity of Con-anc-N/C to sugars decreased, the N- and
C-terminal regions of ConI was found to increase the
binding activity together with the introduction of
the L5 sequence of ConI. Therefore, in terms of carbohydrate-binding activity, L5 should be the predominant
structural element for high binding activity, and the Nand C-terminal regions may play an auxiliary role in carbohydrate binding by increasing the structural stability or
slightly altering the structure. Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6 showed
higher affinity toward almost all sugars than Con-anc-N/
C/L5 (Table 1). Interestingly, the specific binding activity
of Con-anc mutants, namely, Con-anc-L5, Con-ancN/C/
L5, and Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6, were greatly increased
against LNFP-II (#44), LNFP-III (#45), LNDFH (#46), and
A-heptasaccharide (#48), all of which contained fucosylGlcNAc, by 20- to 30-fold when compared with the affinity of Con-anc, and by 3- to 7-fold when compared with
that of ConI (Figure 4). These results suggest that the L5
and L6 regions of ConI may be involved in the high binding affinity to fucosyl-GlcNAc-containing sugars such
as LNFP-II (#44), LNFP-III (#45), LNDFH (#46), and
A-heptasaccharide (#48). On the other hand, the activity

of Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6/L3 was reduced by approximately
30-50% of that of Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6 against these carbohydrates (Figure 4), although Con-anc-N/C/L5/L3
showed almost the same binding activity as Con-anc-N/C/
L5 (data not shown). These results suggest that Thr38/
Met38 residues in L3 cooperate with L6 to modulate the
carbohydrate binding specificity.
Furthermore, the structural comparison of sugars, for
which each mutant was either recognized specifically or
not, showed that Con-anc-N/C/L5 and Con-anc-N/C/
L5/L6 increased the recognizing specificity to an a1,4fucosylated N-acetyl glucosamine (Lewis A, Lea) but not
a1,3-fucosylated N-acetyl glucosamine (Lewis X, Le x)
(Table 2). This indicates that ConI has evolved via accelerated evolution under significant selection pressure to
acquire the binding activity to specific carbohydrates
including a1,4-fucosylated N-acetyl glucosamine. It is
known that the fucosylation occurs throughout nature
and is concerned with the cell-cell interaction and cell
migration in the physiological and pathological processes ranging from fertilisation and development
through to pathological events and cell death [28,29]. In
pathogenic bacterium, the fucosylated oligosaccharides
have been found in Helicobacter pylori, which is a

human pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium causing
gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma. Fucosylated antigens, Lex and Ley , expressed on lipopolysaccharide of
the microorganism play an important role in the infection, mimic host cell surface glycoconjugates and induce
autoantibodies. Recently, fucose-specific lectins, F-type
lectins, have been isolated from the serum from several
fishes such as Anguilla japonica [30], Anguilla anguilla
[31], Morone saxatilis [32], Sparus aurata [33], and
Dicentrarchus labrax [34]. They have been proposed to
play a role as molecular recognition factors in innate
immunity. In the case for conger eel, F-type lectins have
not yet been identified although C-type lectin and galectins have been isolated from serum and skin mucus
[35,13,14]. These observations permit us to speculate
that ConI may function as a surrogate of F-type lectin
besides the function as galectin in conger eel.
On the other hand, ConII showed a binding affinity to
a2,3-sialyl galactose-containing sugars such as GM3
[NeuAc] (N-acetylneuraminic acid), GM3 [NeuGc]
(N-glycolylneuraminic acid), and GD1a as described in a
previous report [23], and ConI simply could not bind to
GM3 and GD1a. Although Con-anc mutants, namely,
Con-anc-N/C, Con-anc-L5, and Con-anc-N/C/L5, also
showed binding affinities to a2,3-sialyl galactose-containing sugars–GM3 (NeuAc) (#29), GM3 (NeuGc)
(#30), and GD1a (#33)–with very low interactions when
compared with ConII, Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6 and Conanc-N/C/L5/L6/L3 lost their binding activities against
GM3 (NeuAc) (#29), GM3 (NeuGc) (#30), and GD1a
(#33), indicating that the L5 and L6 structures of ConII
contribute to the recognition of a2,3-sialyl galactose

Page 8 of 14

(Figure 5). The SPR analysis of Con-anc mutants using
the GM3-immobilized sensor chip confirmed their binding affinity to a2,3-sialyl galactose-containing sugars
(Table 3). Con-anc-N/C and Con-anc showed similar
GM3-binding activity (Kd = 4.9 × 10-5 and 6.8 × 10-5 M,
respectively). On the other hand, Con-anc-L5 showed
decreased affinity to GM3 (K d = 2.6 × 10 -4 M), and
Con-anc-N/C/L5 showed negligible affinity to GM3
(Kd = 1.0 × 10-2 M). These observations indicate that
the L5 and L6 regions of ConI are responsible for the
strong binding affinities to a1,4-fucosylated N-acetyl
glucosamine in exchange for the binding affinities to
a2,3-sialyl galactose.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation

L3 and L6 regions do not directly interact with the bound
sugar in the crystal structure of ConI, although the
mutants of these loops demonstrated significant alterations in the sugar-binding activity. To investigate the
roles of these loops in sugar recognition, a 4-ns MD
simulation of the dimeric ConI-lactose complex was performed. Cooperative behaviors within and between the
loops and sugar-binding residues were evaluated as the
correlation coefficients of the hydrogen bond formation
rates during the simulation. As a result, high correlations
within and between L3 and L5 were detected (Figure 6).
Furthermore, the hydrogen bonds between L3 and L5
revealed a correlation with the bonds connecting Arg28
and Arg47 to lactose. On the other hand, L6 cooperated
with L4 through the inter-loop connections mediated by
L2, because L2-L6 and L2-L4 hydrogen bonds were
highly correlated (Figure 6). This cooperation of loops,

Apoptotic activities of Con-anc mutants

Figure 7 showed the dose-dependent cytotoxic effects of
ConI, ConII, and Con-anc and its mutants on apoptotic
activities for Jurkat cells. ConI showed a stronger apoptosis-inducing activity than ConII, similar to their carbohydrate-binding activities as described in the previous
study, we found that ConI and ConII could strongly
induce apoptosis in the human T-cell lines and Jurkat
cells, and that their apoptotic activities are induced via
lectin-carbohydrate interactions [36]. In the present
study, the cytotoxic activities of Con-anc mutants
were assayed using the Jurkat cells to evaluate the correlations between the apoptotic activities and carbohydrate-binding specificities of Con-anc and its mutants,
in addition to the present-day congerins, ConI and
ConII. The apoptotic activities of Con-anc and its
mutants were positively correlated with their agglutinating activities, suggesting that Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6 and
Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6/L3, whose carbohydrate-binding
activities were almost the same (50-100%) as that of
ConI, could produce apoptosis-inducing activities comparable with those of ConI. On the other hand, Conanc, which had similar sugar-binding activity as that of
ConII, showed a lower apoptosis-inducing activity than
ConII (Figure 7).
Numerous galectins have been indicated as the functional molecules that control the fate of a cell
[5,7,8,37,38]. In particular, there are many reports indicating galectins as apoptosis-inducing factors, e.g., galectin-1 [37], galectin-2 [39], galectin-3 (exogenous) [40],
galectin-8 [41,42], and galectin-9 [43]. It is known that
galectin-1-induced apoptosis requires its binding to the
glycoproteins, including CD7, CD43, and CD45, on the
surface of the T-cells [44-46]. These glycoproteins have
some O-linked and/or N-linked glycans, and are modified by some glycosyltransferases via alteration of their
susceptibility to galectin-1-induced apoptosis [47,48]. In
addition, congerins also bind to CD7, CD43, and CD45.
Neuraminidase-treated Jurkat cells were 3- and 5-fold
more susceptible to ConI and ConII, respectively, than
the non-treated Jurkat cells (unpublished data), indicating that the carbohydrate structure on the T-cell surface
is important for the induction of apoptosis by congerins.
Evolutionary process of congerins from ancestral gene

L6-L2-L4, showed a negative correlation with the lactosebinding hydrogen bonds, Lac-R28 and Lac-R47. These
observations implied that the L6-L2-L4 and L3-L5 networks of the loops might have an antagonistic effect on
sugar binding. As L4 and L5 were directly involved in
sugar binding, these results suggested that the structural
compatibility between loops L3-L5 and L6-L2-L4 might
affect the sugar-binding activity, as observed in the Conanc mutants.

At the gene duplication event, the ancestral congerin
Con-anc showed comparable thermostability and similar
carbohydrate-binding specificities, with those of ConII,
except for a2,3-sialyl galactose-containing sugars such as
GM3 and GD1a. Thus, the gene encoding ConII has
evolved in an accelerated manner from the ancestral
gene to acquire the ability specific to pathogenic marine
bacteria via the recognition of a2,3-sialyl galactose
[20,23]. On the other hand, ConI has evolved from the

ConI, 0.098; ConII, 0.27; Con-anc, 1.2; Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6, 0.12; and Con-anc-N/C/L5/L6/L3, 0.11.

ancestral congerin Con-anc to increase the binding activity against various sugars by modifying the N- and C-termini and L5, L6, and L3 regions. Particularly, modifying
the L5 and L6 regions of Con-anc to ConI showed strong
binding specificities against a1,4-fucosylated N-acetyl
glucosamine. These findings emphasize that the carbohydrate-binding ability and the specificities of galectins can
be controlled by modifying the loop structures.
In general, the rational designing of protein is a conventional and useful method to study the structurefunction relationship of the protein with the partial
molecular evolutionary information such as sequence
alignments. However, it is difficult to predict and determine the effects of various mutations if several amino
acids synergistically act as structural factors and exert
multiple effects. In the present study, tracing analysis of
molecular evolution of galectins by using ancestral gene
and its mutated forms has enabled the more direct
investigation of the structure-function relationship of
proteins. In fact, we have elucidated the correlations
between the molecular evolution (or amino acid substitutions) and functional diversification of ConI (Figure 8),
which have revealed the detailed structural elements
responsible for ligand specificity to LNFP-II, LNFP-III,
LNDFH, and A-heptasaccharide (#44, #45, #46, and
#48), respectively.

Conclusions
The tracing analysis of molecular evolution, a protein
engineering approach employing the reconstruction of
probable ancestral forms based on phylogenetic trees
and their mutants, is a powerful approach that not only
reveals the molecular evolution process and determinants of selection pressures, but also helps to study the
structure-function relationships of proteins.
Methods
Design and preparation of chimera mutants of Con-anc
and ConI

The Con-anc mutants described in this study are summarized in Figure 1 and Additional File 1: Supplemental
Table S1. These mutants were constructed by inverted
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with
some modifications [49], using PrimeSTAR HS DNA
polymerase (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan) containing 2 ng of
template DNA, 200 μM of each dNTP, and 0.3 μM of
each primer. The pTV-Con-anc [23] and mutated pTVCon-anc plasmids were used as templates, and oligonucleotide primers containing unique restriction enzyme
and mutation sites were used for PCR (Additional File
2: Table S2). The reaction mixtures were cycled
30 times, with each cycle running at 98°C for 10 s, 55°C
for 15 s, and 72°C for 3 min 30 s. The mutagenized

Figure 8 Evolutionary pathway of ConI. Each step in the pathway represents one functional evolutionary process. *A subset of sugars includes
LNFP-II, LNDFH, and A-heptasaccharide (#44, #46, and #48, respectively).

PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, using Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System
(Promega, USA), and subsequently digested with a
unique restriction enzyme. The DNA fragment was selfligated and then transformed into competent Escherichia
coli JM109. The nucleotide sequences of the mutant
plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant Con-anc mutants were prepared by a method previously reported for Con-anc [23]. In brief, each mutant
was purified by affinity chromatography on an HCl-treated Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare, UK), followed
by anion-exchange chromatography on a 5-ml HiTrap
Q column (GE Healthcare). The purity of each mutant
was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The phylogenetic
tree of galectins including the chimera mutants between
Con-anc and ConI was constructed by the maximum
likelihood (ML) method in the PAML software package
[50] using their amino acid sequences. Sequences data
of galectins were retrieved from SwissProt databases.
The entry codes for amino acid sequences are, respectively: ConI, leg1_conmy (p26788); ConII, leg2_conmy
(q9yic2); BTG1 bovine galectin-1, leg1_bovin (p11116);
HSG1 human galectin-1, leg1_human (p09382);

HSG2 human galectin-2, leg2_humen (p05162); XLG1
Xenopus galectin-1, q98ud4.
Thermostability measurements

Thermostabilities of Con-anc mutants were assessed by
their residual hemagglutination activities using 2% rabbit
erythrocytes plated on 96-well microtiter plates after
incubation for 30 min at various temperatures ranging
from 38 to 62°C in 50-mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5),
followed by cooling on ice. The experiment was performed in duplicate, and separately repeated three times.
Carbohydrate-binding properties

The carbohydrate-binding specificities and activities of
Con-anc mutants were determined by frontal affinity
chromatography (FAC) [51-53] in the same manner as
that adopted for Con-anc [23]. The structures of the
34 kinds of pyridylaminated (PA) oligosaccharides
used in FAC analysis are shown in Additional File 3:
Supplemental Figure S1. In the SPR analysis, lyso-GM3
(Takara Bio Inc.) was immobilized on the sensor chip
CM5 (GE Healthcare) via amino group, using carbodiimide chemistry, according to the manufacturer’s
manual.

Molecular dynamics simulation

The coordinates of the ConI-lactose complex were
retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1c1l),
and the dimer structure was constructed on the basis of
the biological unit matrix. Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation was performed for 4 ns using the SANDER
module of AMBER 9 program suite. The AMBER03 force
field [54] and GLYCAM 04 parameter set were used for
the protein molecules and lactose, respectively. The system
was solvated with TIP3P water molecules. To maintain the
overall electrostatic neutrality conditions, Na+ ions were
added to the simulated systems. The initial unfavorable
atomic contacts were removed by energy minimization
with 1500 steps. The simulation was then started at 5 K,
with the initial velocities adopted from a Maxwellian distribution, followed by heating from 5 to 300 K over 50 ps.
Subsequently, a 100-ps equilibration was performed at 300
K. Electrostatic interactions were calculated without distance cutoff by using the particle-mesh Ewald method
[55]. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain the
bond lengths with hydrogen atoms [56]. The MD trajectories were analyzed using the PTRAJ module of AMBER.
The correlation coefficients of cooperative hydrogen-bond
formation were evaluated to detect the relationships
between the loops (L2, L3, L4, L5, and L6) and sugar-binding sites (Arg28 and Arg47). The first 3-ns trajectory was
divided into 200-ps (20 steps) bins, and the formation
rates within the time-bins were calculated for each hydrogen bond that showed a 10-90% overall formation rate,
excluding the transiently or permanently formed ones.
The formation rate is the fraction of the snapshot structures that have the objective hydrogen bond in the total
structures within the time-bin. The correlation coefficients
for the pairs of hydrogen bonds were evaluated from the
arrays of the formation rates. The correlation coefficient
can be defined as
r xy  ( x i   x  i )(y i   y  i ) / {( x i   x  i ) 2 (y i   y  i ) 2}1/2 ,

where, xi and yi are the formation rates of the hydrogen bonds x and y within the time bin i, respectively.
The coefficients were averaged within and between the
loops or sugar-binding residues.
Cell culture and in vitro cell assays of Con-anc and its
mutants

The cytotoxic activities of Con-anc and its mutants
were assessed by using Jurkat cells [57,58] as the target
cells. The Jurkat cells were maintained in a RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution at 37°C in 5%
CO 2 atmosphere. The Jurkat cells were grown in
96-well microtiter plates for the assay. Three-fold serial
dilutions of Con-anc or its mutants were added to the

Page 12 of 14

confluent cells. After culturing for 24 h at 37°C in 5%
CO2 atmosphere, the cell viability was evaluated using
the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Dojindo, Japan),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, the chromophores of WST-1 were measured
by absorbance at 450 nm. The assay was performed in
triplicate, and confirmed separately three times to
assess the reproducibility.
