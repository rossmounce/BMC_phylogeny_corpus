Abstract
Background: In the event of biocrimes or infectious disease outbreaks, high-resolution genetic characterization for
identifying the agent and attributing it to a specific source can be crucial for an effective response. Until recently,
in-depth genetic characterization required expensive and time-consuming Sanger sequencing of a few strains,
followed by genotyping of a small number of marker loci in a panel of isolates at or by gel-based approaches such
as pulsed field gel electrophoresis, which by necessity ignores most of the genome. Next-generation, massively
parallel sequencing (MPS) technology (specifically the Applied Biosystems sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation
and detection (SOLiD™) system) is a powerful investigative tool for rapid, cost-effective and parallel microbial
whole-genome characterization.
Results: To demonstrate the utility of MPS for whole-genome typing of monomorphic pathogens, four Bacillus
anthracis and four Yersinia pestis strains were sequenced in parallel. Reads were aligned to complete reference
genomes, and genomic variations were identified. Resequencing of the B. anthracis Ames ancestor strain detected
no false-positive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and mapping of reads to the Sterne strain correctly
identified 98% of the 133 SNPs that are not clustered or associated with repeats. Three geographically distinct B.
anthracis strains from the A branch lineage were found to have between 352 and 471 SNPs each, relative to the
Ames genome, and one strain harbored a genomic amplification. Sequencing of four Y. pestis strains from the
Orientalis lineage identified between 20 and 54 SNPs per strain relative to the CO92 genome, with the single
Bolivian isolate having approximately twice as many SNPs as the three more closely related North American strains.
Coverage plotting also revealed a common deletion in two strains and an amplification in the Bolivian strain that
appear to be due to insertion element-mediated recombination events. Most private SNPs (that is, a, variant found
in only one strain in this set) selected for validation by Sanger sequencing were confirmed, although rare falsepositive SNPs were associated with variable nucleotide tandem repeats.
Conclusions: The high-throughput, multiplexing capability, and accuracy of this system make it suitable for rapid
whole-genome typing of microbial pathogens during a forensic or epidemiological investigation. By interrogating
nearly every base of the genome, rare polymorphisms can be reliably discovered, thus facilitating high-resolution
strain tracking and strengthening forensic attribution.

Background
Microbial forensics is a discipline with an epidemiological foundation focused on the characterization, analysis
and interpretation of evidence derived from a disease
outbreak to identify it as a criminal event (a biocrime,
an inadvertent release or a hoax) and distinguish it from
a natural disease outbreak (reviewed by Budowle et al.
[1], Cummings and Relman [2]). Microbial forensic
investigations seek to obtain information regarding the
identification or source of the evidentiary material with
the ultimate goals of identifying those responsible for
the crime (that is, attribution), excluding innocent or
unlikely sources, and reconstructing the events of a
case. In this sense, a search for commonalities and clustering to identify the source of infection is similar to the
standard epidemiologic methods used to investigate outbreaks of infectious diseases. Microbial forensic findings
can be supportive for criminal prosecution or for actions
that might be taken as a result of national policy
decisions.
As an example of the use of genetic evidence, we briefly
describe the aspects of the anthrax letter attack of 2001
(for further details see Amerithrax Investigation documents [3]). Emergence of several anthrax cases and the
discovery of letters carrying Bacillus anthracis spores in
the offices of several media outlets and the US Senate
created an immediate need to obtain forensic evidence
that could assist in identifying the source of the B.
anthracis and ultimately the perpetrator(s) of this act.
Genetic evidence was pursued to eliminate potential candidate sources of the B. anthracis spores, but identifying
informative individualizing genetic markers was and is a
challenge. At the time of the bioterrorist event, Sanger
shotgun sequencing was the best approach for identification of genetic markers for attribution purposes. Because
Sanger shotgun sequencing is costly and labor-intensive,
only the genomes of a few (at most) selected reference
samples and the evidence sample were sequenced [4-6].
Comparative genomics methods were then used to search
for polymorphisms that could distinguish the samples to
some degree, with the intention of designing targeted
assays (for example, PCR or TaqMan® assays) with which
to screen the repository of collected candidate laboratory
samples. Unfortunately, no such polymorphisms were
initially discovered by this approach.
Culturing of the anthrax evidence eventually revealed
that several variants with different colony morphologies
were present as a mixture [3]. When these phenotypic
variants were purified and characterized by shotgun
sequencing, each was found to harbor a unique genetic
variation. Real-time PCR assays targeting four variants
in the anthrax evidence (designated A1, A3, D and E)
were designed and used to screen the sample repository.

Samples found to contain the same array of variants
were considered to be more closely related to the
evidence.
The strategy undertaken in response to the 2001
anthrax attacks suffered from several technical shortcomings. Results could not be obtained expeditiously,
making impractical a rapid response during exigent circumstances, during which the threat of continued attack
persisted [7]. Because of cloning and sequencing artifacts, and limited depth of coverage, many initial putative polymorphisms had to be verified by PCR and
direct sequencing, which required additional time, cost
and labor, and eliminated most of the initially identified
‘polymorphisms’. Finally, by screening the approximately
1,000-sample B. anthracis investigation repository for a
limited set of polymorphisms, which were identified by
sequencing of a few selected isolates, most of the genome for most strains was simply not assayed, thus
potentially missing information that might uniquely
identify the source.
MPS technologies introduced in the past few years
enable the generation of over 50 GB (and counting) of
sequence data from a single instrument run, an example
being the sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and
detection (SOLiD™) system from Applied Biosystems.
This level of throughput makes feasible the sequencing
of multiple bacterial genomes in a short period of time
(approximately 1 week) and at a relatively low cost
(< US$10,000 per sequencing run and much less on a
per bacterial genome basis; reviewed in [8,9]). Before the
introduction of this technology, time and cost constraints limited whole-genome sequencing to a small
number of strains or isolates to identify potentially
informative genetic markers. Characterization of additional strains, because of limited throughput and prohibitive costs, required screening a small selection of the
polymorphic loci discovered by the initial comparison of
the few complete reference genomes. Although this was
the only viable approach for screening genetic variation
between strains and isolates, there were two major limitations. The selected genetic marker sites may not be
informative for the investigative question(s) and most of
the genomes of the samples were underinterrogated,
thus any other individualizing markers that may reside
in the genome would go undetected. It is now feasible
to sequence the entire genome of any culturable strain
of interest rapidly and accurately for a reasonable cost
using the current technology. The greatest level of resolution for strains is achieved by interrogating every base
of the genome rather than restricting the search to
selected loci.
When a closely related reference genome is available,
an accurate consensus sequence can be derived by

Cummings et al. Investigative Genetics 2010, 1:5

mapping fragment or mate-paired reads to a reference
[9]. Referenced assembly has the advantage of leveraging
the property of two-base encoding in SOLiD™ system
data. Interrogating each base twice and requiring two
adjacent colorspace differences significantly reduces
error rates in detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, the depth of coverage yields a
greater accuracy for variant identification. We applied
these methods to two bacterial species, B. anthracis and
Y. pestis, to determine the possibility of sensitive and
accurate detection of SNPs in closely related microbial
genomes, analyzed in parallel.

Results
Validation of library barcoding

To facilitate the analysis of several strains on a single
flow cell, genomes were indexed by ligating a unique
six-base barcode to each library. The barcodes were
sequenced during the SOLiD™ system run, then for each
fragment read, the corresponding strain was assigned by
matching to the known barcode sequences. Single mismatches in the barcode sequence were tolerated. Fidelity
of the barcoding process was estimated after read mapping by identifying 27 unique SNPs in one Y. pestis
strain with at least 25× coverage and then counting the
number of reads overlapping the SNP that perfectly
matched the reference genome or the other three Y. pestis genomes sequenced in this run. At these 27 positions, 2,274 reads matched the consensus (that is, the
non-reference allele), whereas only 6 reads matched the
reference allele, suggesting that they could be derived
from one of the other three Y. pestis genomes in the
experiment. Normalized for library representation, the
maximum estimated rate of ‘bleed-through’ between
libraries was 0.076%.
B. anthracis resequencing

Four B. anthracis strains were chosen for sequencing on
the SOLiD™ system: A2012, a culture of the Ames
ancestor strain from which the published genome
sequence is available, and three related, previously unsequenced strains from the branch A lineage (A0032,
A0324 and A0377) [10-12]. For each strain, fragment
libraries were constructed. The four B. anthracis
libraries were run on a single flow cell together with
four Y. pestis libraries (see below), such that each library
occupied approximately one-eighth of a flow cell.
Between 4 million and 26 million reads of 35 bp were
obtained for each B. anthracis strain, with the difference
in number of reads most likely being due to inaccurate
quantification of genomic DNA or individual library
preparations. When aligned to the Ames ancestor reference chromosome, median read depth ranged from 16
for A0324 to 93 for A0032 (Table 1, Figure 1). Median

coverage of the two virulence plasmids suggested mean
copy numbers of 1.8 to 3.1 for pXO1 and 1.5 to 1.8 for
pXO2 per chromosome. Fewer than 100,000 reference
bases were not covered by a uniquely matching read,
with most of these bases being found in repetitive or
multi-copy genomic sequence (for example, rRNA loci).
Alignment of reads to the Ames ancestor genome
facilitated the detection of SNPs in each of the four
B. anthracis strains (Table 2. See Additional File 1).
Only a single nucleotide ambiguity, but no clear SNP,
was identified for sample A2012, which has been verified
as 100% identical to the Ames ancestor [4], yielding a
false-positive rate of approximately 1 in 5 million (without sampling error correction), if the ambiguity is considered to be a SNP call.
The other three B. anthracis strains each had between
352 and 471 unambiguous SNPs on the chromosome
and two plasmids, with no more than 13 ambiguities, 4
of which were the result of misalignment of reads from
an imperfect repeat sequence. As expected, the number
of SNPs distinguishing any two strains was proportional
to previous variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) predictions of evolutionary distance [10,13], with the most
divergent strain (A0377) having the greatest number of
variations. Ten private SNPs (that is, a, variant in only
one strain in this set) were arbitrarily selected from each
of the three non-Ames ancestor strains for validation by
PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Because
these SNPs were found in only one strain, they had a
higher probability of being due to sequencing error than
did SNPs common to more than one strain. All 30 of
these SNPs were verified as true polymorphisms (data
not shown).
To further assess false-negative and false-positive
rates, the A2012 (the Ames ancestor) reads were aligned
to the B. anthracis Sterne complete genome sequence.
Results of SNP calling were compared with a “goldstandard” set of 150 SNPs, derived from comparative
analysis of the two complete genomes as previously
determined by Sanger sequencing [12]. The SNP detection software is able to identify heterozygous alleles,
which is appropriate for diploid organisms, but because
heterozygous alleles are not present in haploid organisms, heterozygous SNPs (ambiguous base calls) were
not considered to be SNP calls for the purpose of this
analysis. The SOLiD™ system analysis correctly identified 130 of the 150 SNPs (Table 3). Of the 20 SNPs
that were not called, 17 were localized to two clusters
that precluded alignment of reads to the reference.
Thirteen of the false-negative SNPs are found in a
stretch of 40 bp in the GBAA_2450 gene (Figure 2,
top). Because only three colorspace mismatches were
allowed in the read alignment step, this density of SNPs
effectively precludes read mapping, so it is not possible

to call SNPs. This region also contains small gaps that
further prohibit matching of reads. The other cluster of
false-negative SNPs (four SNPs in a 10 bp stretch)
occurred in a 27 bp near-perfect direct repeat in the
GBAA_1572 gene, encoding a penicillin-binding protein
(Figure 2, bottom). Low unique-read mapping coverage
in this region is due to the high density of SNPs and to
the three perfect repeat copies to the upstream of the
SNPs. The SNPs are also adjacent to a two-repeat unit
insertion in the Ames ancestor genome relative to
Sterne.

Eight putative false-positive SNPs (that is, not found
in the gold-standard set) were called. Four of these were
attributable to deletion of one or more direct repeat
units from the Ames ancestor genome relative to Sterne
[Ames ancestor open reading frame (ORF) IDs
GBAA_0397, GBAA_2345, GBAA_4978, GBAA_5604]
(Figure 3). Another false-positive SNP was in a transposase ORF (GBAA_5455) that is present in three nearly
identical copies in each genome.
In addition to SNP variants, coverage depth plots indicated a putative amplification on the A0377

non-unique 35-mers in the chromosome: no reads can map uniquely to these sequences. The arrow in the A0377 plot indicates the amplified
genomic region depicted in detail in Figure 4. The V-shaped profile of the coverage plot is due to the fact that replicating bacteria initiate a
second round of chromosomal replication before the completion of the ongoing round, resulting in higher copy number at the origin of
replication (at the ends of the plot) and lower copy number at the terminus (center of the plot).

chromosome in the region between the rrnC and rrnD
loci (Figure 4). Two TaqMan® assays inside the putative
amplification and two flanking the region were designed.
Quantitative real-time PCR assays on genomic DNA
from A0377 vs. A2012 (Ames ancestor) indicated that
the region was present at a copy number 1.6-fold to 1.7fold higher than the rest of the chromosome, suggesting
that it is present in multiple copies, at least in a fraction
of the culture from which the genomic DNA preparation was obtained (Figure 4, inset).
Y. pestis resequencing

A similar resequencing approach was taken for discovery of polymorphisms in Y. pestis strains. Fragment
libraries of four Y. pestis strains (three North American
and one Bolivian strain, all from the 1.ORI lineage) were
sequenced, each on one-eighth of a SOLiD™ system flow
cell, together with four B. anthracis strains (see above).
Y. pestis reads were mapped against the published reference genome (chromosome and three plasmids) of
another Y. pestis North American Orientalis strain,
CO92. Between 25 million and 36 million reads of
35 bp were mapped for each strain, with median chromosomal read depth ranging from 129 for 90A-4021 to
176 for 97A-7970 (Table 4, Figure 5). Median coverage

of the plasmids pMT1 and pCD1 suggested mean copy
numbers of 1 to 2 per chromosome, whereas the copy
number of the pPCP1 plasmid ranged from 10 to 17 per
chromosome. Fewer than 320,000 reference bases were
not covered by a uniquely matching read, with most of
these bases being found in repetitive or multi-copy
genomic sequence (for example, rRNA loci and high
copy number insertion elements).
Alignment of reads to the CO92 genome facilitated
the detection of SNPs in each of the four Y. pestis
strains, with between 20 and 54 unambiguous chromosomal SNPs, and at most 9 ambiguities found (Table 5;
Additional File 2). Ten putative SNPs found in all four
strains were previously found to be errors in the
reported reference sequence (DMW and PK, see Additional File 3) and were therefore omitted from the list of
SNPs reported here. Up to ten private SNPs were
selected from each of the four Y. pestis strains for validation by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Of
these 22 SNPs, 19 were validated. Two of the SNP calls
were found to be associated with the loss of a direct
near-perfect repeat copy from a VNTR locus (16 or 18
bp; Figure 6), whereas only one private SNP appeared to
be a genuine false-positive call.
Alignment of reads to the reference genome identified a
shared deletion in 97A-7970 and La Paz, encompassing
YPO1902 to YPO1967 of the CO92 genome, which is
commonly found in Y. pestis strains propagated in the
laboratory (Figure 7) [14-17]. PCR across the putative
deletion breakpoint followed by Sanger sequencing verified
the deletion and confirmed that it is the result of recombination between flanking IS100 elements (data not shown).
Read coverage depth also revealed an apparent copy
number increase in La Paz encompassing CO92 ORFs
YPO4048 to YPO4090 (Figure 8). TaqMan® quantitative
PCR assays targeting this region indicated that the
region is present at a copy number four-fold higher
than that of the flanking chromosomal region (Figure 8,
inset). Using PCR primers immediately internal to the
putative breakpoint and facing out of the region amplified a product containing an IS1661 element, suggesting
that the amplification is due to direct duplication
mediated by recombination between flanking IS1661 elements (data not shown). The amplified region of the
genome harbors the gene encoding MdfA, a multidrug
translocase, suggesting that La Paz (or at least the isolate used in this study) could have increased antibiotic
resistance relative to other Y. pestis strains.

Discussion
B. anthracis is a clonal pathogen that emerged from a
B. cereus relative. The genetic differences related to this
emergence include at least one important chromosomal
mutation (plcR) and the acquisition of two virulence

plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, which transformed a soilliving opportunistic pathogen into one capable of catastrophic disease in mammals. The great success of this
new pathogen in its new niche has eliminated recombination, as evidenced by whole-genome SNP analysis
[12]. Whole-genome SNP discovery was guided by an
unbiased genotyping analysis of a large strain collection

[10,18] and then followed by extensive SNP genotyping
[12,19]. This has established one of the most accurate
phylogenetic reconstructions of any bacterial species
[18]. SNP genotypes are now the gold standard in B.
anthracis subtyping, and their power is only limited by
the genotyping technology. The future is clearly the performance of whole-genome genotyping with a focus on

the SNPs. A whole-genome approach eliminates discovery bias, assays for thousands of known SNPs, and discovers novel SNPs that will be strain-specific [13]. In
the case of a bioterrorism event, strain-specific identifiers provide a valuable tool for tracking a biocrime

(inclusion) and eliminating (exclusion) natural disease
events from the investigative process. As in human forensic investigations, the exclusionary power is tremendously important, and its value in an investigation
should not be underestimated.

Y. pestis is a very young species that probably arose
during the past 20,000 years [20]. As a result, there has
been very little time for genetic mutations that can be
used as genetic markers to accumulate within this species as a whole. For example, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of globally diverse strains found no
variation at six loci [21]. This is especially the case for

some of the molecular groups within Y. pestis. The best
example of this is the 1.ORI group, which experienced a
global expansion when it was spread from coastal
regions in China to Africa, Europe, North America,
South America and Australia during the third plague
pandemic [22]. Despite its global distribution, the 1.ORI
group is nearly monomorphic, because of the historical
bottleneck that occurred in China. In addition, specific
populations that are the result of this global expansion
of the 1.ORI group, such as North American and South
American populations, are even more monomorphic, as
they may be the result of a single introduction event
[23]. Previous whole-genome comparisons using Sanger
sequences indicated that phylogenetically informative
SNPs can be identified in multiple strains from these
very recent populations, such as North American Y. pestis [24,25]. Our results demonstrate that MPS can also
be used to identify these types of differences but much
more rapidly and cheaply than by Sanger sequencing.
We have demonstrated the rapid and accurate simultaneous resequencing of eight bacterial genomes in a
single flow cell run of a MPS instrument. The accuracy
conferred by two-base encoding and emulsion PCR and
the high depth of coverage obtained from the SOLiD™
system allowed most SNPs to be easily distinguished
between closely related strains of B. anthracis and
Y. pestis. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using massively parallel sequencing technology

to perform whole-genome strain typing to obtain accurate results while scanning the whole-genome of several
strains simultaneously. Similar analyses, using Solexa or
454 sequencing, of Escherichia coli clones derived from
a long-term evolution experiment [26], Francisella tularensis clinical isolates [27], or Salmonella Typhi clinical
isolates [28] further highlight the ability of MPS to identify essentially all genetic differences between closely
related strains.
Of the rare SNP calling errors encountered in this
study, many are associated with repeat sequences. Falsepositive SNP calls are often localized to repeat regions
or multicopy sequences in the genome. When sequences

are identical, unique mapping of reads derived from
them is not possible and false-positive SNPs are not
called. However, when the sequences differ only by a
small number of bases, reads derived from one copy
may incorrectly map to a different copy, and this can
result in false-positive SNP calls. This phenomenon
accounts for the majority of the false-positive SNPs
detected in this study. Although these false-positive
SNPs are technically errors, they often do lead to the
identification of indel polymorphisms (for example,
VNTRs) that could be valuable loci for discriminating
strains or isolates. Repeats can also impair detection of
real SNPs (that is, false-negatives), as was observed in

the mapping of A2012 (Ames ancestor) reads to the
B. anthracis Sterne genome.
Fragment libraries are well suited to the detection of
SNPs in very closely related genomes, such as the
B. anthracis or Y. pestis strains analyzed here. They can
be constructed from a small amount of genomic DNA
and are amenable to barcoding for greater throughput.
However, fragment libraries are not as well suited as
mate-pair libraries for detection of genomic rearrangements or identification of polymorphisms in non-unique
regions of the genome. By allowing otherwise unmappable reads to be unambiguously anchored to a unique
region of the genome, mate-pairs facilitate indel detection and result in higher sensitivity for detection of clustered SNPs. Furthermore, long-distance linkage between
paired reads allows de novo assembly, which may reveal
sequences not present in the reference genome, and
inference of large chromosomal rearrangements. The
use of mate-pair libraries in this study could have eliminated errors caused by incorrect mapping of reads to
multiple copies of a nearly identical sequence at different locations in the genome. Mate-pair libraries, however, are unlikely to eliminate errors in tandem repeat
sequences unless the repeat units are large and the size
of the ‘insert’ between the two reads is very tightly constrained. Preparation of mate-pair libraries is more complicated and requires more starting material, and
barcoding of mate-pair libraries is not currently possible
on the SOLiD™ system, so when speed and throughput
are important and a very closely related reference genome is available, fragment libraries may be preferable.
The choice of whether to use fragment or mate-pair

libraries should be guided by the types of polymorphisms to be detected, and the expected degree of relatedness between the strains of interest and their respective
reference sequences.
Well-defined reference samples are crucial for comparative genomics studies and assay development, but it
is well known that genome sequences deposited in public databases contain errors. For example, in this study,
Y. pestis reads were mapped against the published genomic sequence of strain CO92. Ten putative SNPs that
were common to all four test strains had been previously identified by directed resequencing as errors in
the CO92 sequence (DMW and PK, unpublished data,
Additional File 3) and therefore could be filtered from
the list of polymorphisms. Without this prior knowledge, a researcher would come to the wrong conclusion
regarding the degree of variation and what constitutes
an informative marker. Given the high throughput and
accuracy of the SOLiD™ system, it may be beneficial,
particularly for biosafety and biosecurity programs, to
re-analyze selected reference genomes, so that highquality, error-corrected reference standards can be
publicly available.
The morphological variants found in the evidence
from the 2001 anthrax attacks were present as minority
components in the mixture, with much lower prevalence
than the wild type, making them potentially difficult to
detect. MPS could also be applied to this scenario to
rapidly and effectively type these low-level variants and
substantially reduce the false-negative rate due to stochastic sampling. Consider the situation where each of
the variable loci can be amplified by PCR, yielding an

Cummings et al. Investigative Genetics 2010, 1:5
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/1/1/5

amplicon of approximately 200 bp in length. The combined length for a four-variant positive sample would be
800 bp. Sequencing of these amplicons on the SOLiD™
system would yield a theoretical coverage depth of
approximately 12.5 million, assuming throughput of 10
GB per fragment run. By multiplexing amplicons from
256 specimens, coverage would still be approximately
50,000 times, which is estimated to be sufficient for
detection of variants present at fewer than 1 in 10,000
in a mixed sample. It may also be possible to identify
minority variants, albeit with lower sensitivity, by
directly sequencing mixed genomic DNA samples, as
recently demonstrated for E. coli [29] and Salmonella
Typhi [30].
In this study, eight genomic DNA samples were analyzed on a single SOLiD™ system flow cell using barcoding to allow multiplexing of samples. Consumables for
this experiment had a list price of less than US$8,000,
so the reagent cost per genome was less than US$1,000.
Using 208 million mapped reads with 35 bp read length,
the average coverage obtained in this study was approximately 100-fold. Conservatively assuming that it is possible to get accurate SNP calls with 50-fold coverage
([31], data not shown), the number of strains that can
be analyzed in parallel can be doubled to 16. Furthermore, with the current SOLiD™ 3.0 system specifications, it is possible to obtain 300 million mapped reads
of 50 bases or approximately twice the coverage
obtained here. Thus, it is technically possible to
sequence at least 32 strains simultaneously on a single
flow cell for approximately US$250 per genome in consumable costs. The efforts required by a skilled team to
obtain DNA samples, construct libraries, analyze data
and validate results constitute a significant expense that
does not scale as readily as instrument reagents, so
further multiplexing of samples will require the development of improved automation protocols and analytical
tools.

Conclusions
These results demonstrate that in the event of another
bioterrorism case or public health concern, whole-genome sequences of several isolates could be obtained
with high accuracy within a matter of days, particularly
for viable, culturable specimens. Because of the lower
cost, that is, as much as 250 times less than was possible
during the initial anthrax investigation, combined with
the high coverage (10-100 times greater than shotgun
sequencing) and lower error (> 99.9999% accuracy),
large repositories could be completely sequenced. With
dedicated efficient software for alignment and annotation, and recognition of refractory sequencing results at
nominal parts of the genome, sequencing of whole genomes can now be used as a diagnostic and analytical

tool for forensic and epidemiologic investigations, rather
than just as a research tool.

Methods
Bacterial strains

The B. anthracis isolates used in this study consisted of
four unique strains. The first, A0032, is an isolate from
Changping, China, which falls in the A.Br.008/009 can
SNP group [19]. The second, A0324, is a strain originating from Slovakia, and is also of the A.Br.008/009 can
SNP group, which was described by Okinaka et al. [32]
as having a unique plasmid SNP in common with only a
few other strains from this particular region. The next
isolate, A0377, originates from Haiti and is consistent
with the A.Br.WNA lineage; it falls within the large (236
isolates) subclade node that is located third from the
terminal node, based on the sequenced strain described
by Kenefic et al. [33]. The final strain, A2012, was isolated from the first fatality victim, Robert Stevens, during the 2001 letter attacks. This is the Ames strain that
was used in these attacks and was identified as this
strain via multilocus VNTR analysis 8 genotyping [10].
Four Yersinia pestis strains were examined in this
study: 92A-4261, 90A-4021, 97A-7970 and La Paz.
Strain 92A-4261 was isolated from a flea pool collected
in Plumas County, California in August 1992. Strain
90A-4021 was isolated in Siskiyou County, California in
July 1990 from a chipmunk. Strain 97A-7070 was isolated from a flea pool collected in San Bernardino
County, California in July 1997. The La Paz strain was
isolated from a human in 1969 in La Paz, Bolivia. All
four of these strains are assigned to the 1.ORI group,
which spread around the world during the third plague
pandemic in the 1800 s and 1900 s [20].
Genomic DNA preparation

Genomic DNA was prepared as follows (all DNA isolation reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.,
St. Louis, MO, USA unless otherwise stated). Lawn cultures from single colonies of each isolate were prepared
by streaking onto plates of Trypticase Soy AGar with
5% sheep blood (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA,
USA) followed by 20 hours of incubation at 37°C for B.
anthracis or 48 hours of incubation at 28°C for Y. pestis.
Cells were harvested and suspended in 11 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). The cell suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen for ~2 min and
then thawed in a water bath at 65°C. This freeze-thaw
step was repeated twice, giving for a total of three
cycles. To each extraction lysate, 225 μl of 20% sodium
dodecyl sulfate and 45 μl of proteinase K 20 mg/ml
were added, and mixed gently for 5 min. This step was
followed by a 2 hour incubation at 55°C. Next, 2.5 ml of
5 M NaCl were added and the mixture was mixed by

Cummings et al. Investigative Genetics 2010, 1:5
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/1/1/5

rocking for 5 min. To the suspension, 1.4 ml of 10% (w/
v) hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in
0.7 M NaCl were added, and mixed thoroughly by inversion followed by a 10 minute incubation at 65°C. After
incubation, 12 ml chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1)
were added, and the solution gently mixed by inversion
for 10 min followed by a centrifugation step for 10 minutes at 4°C at 3,220 g. The upper aqueous phase was
then collected and again extracted with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. After the final centrifugation step, the
upper aqueous phase was collected and isopropanol (0.6
v/v) was added for DNA precipitation overnight at -20°
C. The precipitated DNA was then pelleted at 4°C and
3,220 g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was removed,
and 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added to wash the DNA
pellet. The DNA was then re-pelleted at 4°C at 3,220 g
for 10 minutes, the was supernatant removed, and the
pellet briefly dried and resuspended in 500 μl of TE
buffer.
Genomic DNA extracts were quantified using a commercial kit for double stranded DNA (PicoGreen®; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Sample fluorescence
was then measured using a fluorometer (Gemini XPS;
Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
SOLiD™ system sequencing

Barcoded fragment libraries were constructed for each
of the B. anthracis and Y. pestis strains as follows.
Genomic DNA (1.5 to 2 μg) was sheared, end-repaired
(End-It; Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA)
and ligated to barcoded sequencing adapters. Construct
fragments of 175 to 200 bp in size were selected and
purified from a 6% PAGE gel. Resulting libraries were
nick-translated and amplified using 11 to 17 cycles of
PCR, before purification and quantification (2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios, and templated
beads were generated by emulsion PCR before deposition onto a single SOLiD™ system flow cell. Sequencing
was carried out to 35 base pairs using SOLiD™ 3 chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Data analysis

Alignment of SOLiD™ system reads to B. anthracis
Ames ancestor (Refseq accessions NC_007530.2,
NC_007322.2 and NC_007323.3), B. anthracis Sterne
(Refseq accession NC_005945.1) or Y. pestis CO92
(Refseq accessions NC_003143.1, NC_003131.1,
NC_003132.1 and NC_003134.1), was performed using
the SOLiD™ System Analysis Pipeline Tool http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/corona/, allowing a maximum of three colorspace mismatches per read (the core

Page 12 of 14

alignment program within this pipeline is mapreads).
SNPs were called using either diBayes http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/dibayes/ or the SOLiD™ System
Analysis Pipeline Tool. Heterozygous SNPs reported by
the software were interpreted as ambiguous, as bacteria
are haploid. SNP identification between the B. anthracis
Ames ancestor and Sterne finished chromosome
sequences was performed using the MUMmer suite
[34]. The genome alignment in the GBAA_1572 region
of B. anthracis was manually edited to obtain the proper
alignment of 27 bp repeat units (see Figure 2B). Further
investigation of putative false-positive SNPs also led to
the confirmation of four SNPs that were not called by
MUMmer because of their localization within repeat
sequences.
Sanger sequencing

Up to 10 private SNPs were selected from each of the
three previously unsequenced strains. Flanking PCR primers were designed 250 to 300 nucleotides to either
side of each SNP and used for PCR amplification followed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing (BigDye® Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit) on a DNA analyzer
(3730x1 Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
SNPs were validated by the alignment of Sanger contigs
to the Ames ancestor genomic sequence and SNP detection using MUMmer [34].
Quantitative real-time PCR

Four TaqMan® assays were designed for each putative
copy number variation locus: two within the amplified
region and one flanking each end of the amplified
region. MGB probes were labeled with 6-FAM (see
Additional File 4). Real-time amplification was performed using TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix and
a real-time PCR system (Model 7500; Applied Biosystems). Reactions were run in triplicate on strains with
and without the copy number variation, and fold-change
values were calculated using the ΔΔCt method [35].
