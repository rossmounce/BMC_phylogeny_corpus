A new classification of the long-horned caddisflies
(Trichoptera: Leptoceridae) based on molecular data
Tobias Malm1,2*, Kjell Arne Johanson1

Abstract
Background: Leptoceridae are among the three largest families of Trichoptera (caddisflies). The current
classification is founded on a phylogenetic work from the 1980’s, based on morphological characters from adult
males, i.e. wing venation, tibial spur formula and genital morphology. In order to get a new opinion about the
relationships within the family, we undertook a molecular study of the family based on sequences from five genes,
mitochondrial COI and the four nuclear genes CAD, EF-1a, IDH and POL.
Results: The resulting phylogenetic hypotheses are more or less congruent with the morphologically based
classification, with most genera and tribes recovered as monophyletic, but with some major differences. For
monophyly of the two subfamilies Triplectidinae and Leptocerinae, one tribe of each was removed and elevated to
subfamily status; however monophyly of some genera and tribes is in question. All clades except Leptocerinae,
were stable across different analysis methods.
Conclusions: We elevate the tribes Grumichellini and Leptorussini to subfamily status, Grumichellinae and
Leptorussinae, respectively. We also propose the synonymies of Ptochoecetis with Oecetis and Condocerus with
Hudsonema.

Background
Being one of the three largest Trichoptera families, the
long-horned caddisflies, Leptoceridae Leach, have
received great interest since they were first described. In
1815, Leach [1] described the group as a tribe, Leptocerides, into which he included several Phryganea Linnaeus
species from Systema Naturae [2]. Before the twentieth
century the family included the now recognised individual families Beraeidae Wallengren, Calamoceratidae
Ulmer, Molannidae Wallengren and Odontoceridae
Wallengren [3]. Taxonomic work on this family has
until now resulted in about 1,800 described species
classified into 46 extant genera within two recognized
subfamilies, Leptocerinae Leach and Triplectidinae
Ulmer. The latest generic addition, Osflintia Calor &
Holzenthal, was recently described [4]. Representatives
of Leptocerinae can be found worldwide, while species
of Triplectidinae occur mainly in the Australasian and
Neotropical regions.

The first major systematic arrangements of the family
were made in the early 20th century. Ulmer [5] divided
the genera into the two subfamilies, which he later
revised [6] (Table 1A). Almost simultaneously, Silfvenius
[7] had brought into use three tribes within Leptoceridae: Leptocerini Leach (incl. Leptocerus Leach), Mystacidini Burmeister (incl. Erotesis McLachlan, Mystacides
Berthold and Triaenodes McLachlan) and Oecetini Silfvenius (incl. Oecetis McLachlan). In his revision of the
Triplectidinae, Mosely [8] added 6 genera to the subfamily: Atanatolica Mosely, Atriplectides Mosely, Hudsonema Mosely, Loticana Mosely, Notalina Mosely and
Triplectidina Mosely. Loticana was later synonymised
with Symphitoneuria Ulmer and Atriplectides was placed
in Odontoceridae [9], the latter genus was separated as a
distinct family, Atriplectididae by Neboiss [10]. The
tribe Athripsodini Morse & Wallace was erected for the
genera Athripsodes Billberg and Ceraclea Stephens [11].
A natural classification of Leptoceridae was advocated
by Morse [12] who arranged most of the known genera
into tribal groups (Table 1B) based on proposed morphological synapomorphies, and also presented a
hypothesis of the evolution within the family (Figure 1).

uncertain position is presently maintained [3]. De Moor
[18] described a larva from South Africa that is still unassociated with adults, but placed in Leptoceridae. It was
regarded as a possible member of the Triplectidinae even
though the morphological phylogeny did not place it in
either of the subfamilies. A later analysis of the Leptocerinae, with more character data, included this larva but without explanation [19].
The Leptoceridae (represented by 12 species in 10
genera) were recovered as monophyletic in phylogenies
presented by Kjer et al. [20,21] and Holzenthal et al.
[22] based on a combination of molecular and morphological data. No phylogenetic patterns within the family
were assumed or discussed.
Characteristics of Leptoceridae

In that phylogeny, the relationships were unresolved
among the three tribes of Triplectidinae: Grumichellini
Morse, Hudsonemini Morse and Triplectidini Ulmer.
Leptocerinae were in turn divided into eight tribes (with
the exception of a few genera): Leptorussini Morse,
Athripsodini, Nectopsychini Morse, Leptocerini, Triaenodini Morse, Oecetini, Setodini Morse and Mystacidini.
This phylogenetic hypothesis represents the backbone of
the current Leptoceridae classification (Table 1C).
Holzenthal [13] erected a new tribe within the Leptocerinae for the neotropical genus Achoropsyche Holzenthal.
Holzenthal [13,14] stated that it represents the sister
group to the Triaenodini-Mystacidini clade in Morse’s
(1981) phylogeny (Figure 1). The Triplectidinae were
revised by Morse & Holzenthal [15], with the genera
hierarchically ordered by synapomorphies in a tree; in
contrast to Morse’s work [12], the genus Triplexa
Mosely was transferred to Grumichellini from Hudsonemini. The authors were not able to resolve the relationships among the Triplectidini genera Lectrides Mosely,
Symphitoneuria, Symphitoneurina Schmid, Triplectides
Kolenati and Triplectidina, and considered them as
unresolved within Triplectides s.l., questioning the
monophyly of Triplectides without the inclusion of the
other mentioned genera.
The latest addition of Leptoceridae tribes was the
description of Blyzophilini Andersen, Kjærandsen & Morse
for Blyzophilus Andersen & Kjaerandsen, a monotypic
genus from Ghana [16]. Following the phylogeny of Morse
[12], the tribe was placed in a trichotomy with Leptocerini
and the remaining Leptocerinae. In his revision of the
tribes Leptocerini and Setodini, Schmid [17] demonstrated
that Setodes Rambur is paraphyletic, including the genera
Hemileptocerus Ulmer, Trichosetodes Ulmer and Sericodes
Schmid. The Indian genus Nietnerella Kimmins was
described within Leptoceridae, but having morphological
affinities to both Odontoceridae and Calamoceratidae. This

Adult members of the family (Figure 2) are recognised
by having unusually long antennae, hence the common-name “long-horned caddisflies”. The absences of
ocelli and pre-apical mid-tibial spurs in combination
with the presence of two bands of setiferous punctures
along the dorsal side of the mesoscutum, instead of
setal warts, are also characteristics of the family. The
forewings are relatively narrow, while the hind wings
may be narrow or broad, and in many genera within
Leptocerinae and Grumichellini the forewings are variously spotted [3,6,23].
Larvae are recognised by their long antennae, long
hind legs and the presence of at least two setae on the
metasternum. The larval cases are built from a variety
of materials, e.g. sand grains, plant fragments, twigs or
silk. They are usually tubular, but flattened cases are not
uncommon, and some cases are spiral (Leptecho helicotheca Scott). The larvae are mainly detritivorous
shredders and periphyton scrapers, and some are predators. The larvae of certain Ceraclea species are reported
to feed on freshwater sponges [24-27].
The pupae are slender, with long antennae wound up
around abdomen, and without distal modification of the
mandibles [28].
Subfamily Triplectidinae

Three synapomorphies for this subfamily were suggested
by Morse [12] and Morse & Holzenthal [15]: absence of
the primitive phallic parameres, reduction of the phallicata, and presence of a large tooth on each pupal mandible. The tibial spur formula ranges from 0,0,0 (in
Amazonatolica Holzenthal & Oliviera Pes [29]) to 2,2,4.
It was previously stated that the Australian species Westriplectes albanus (Mosely) has two pre-apical mid-tibial
spurs, making the spur formula 2,4,4. This was pointed
out as erroneous by Neboiss [30], but the information is
still used as a character for separating Triplectidinae
from Leptocerinae, e.g. in Morse & Holzenthal [15] and
Yang & Morse [23].

Subfamily Leptocerinae

Proposed synapomorphies for Leptocerinae are absence
of the third fork in the hind wings (as undivided M1+2),
the absence of hind wing crossvein s, and the absence of
mid-tibial pre-apical spurs [12]. The first two characters
are also present in members of Grumichellini [29,31,32]
and the latter character was discussed previously.
Methods background

The taxonomy of the family has mainly been based on
adult morphology, mostly of males, and the classification
in use today is predominantly based on that of Morse
[12]. The most commonly used characters for generic
and species delimitation are the tibial spur formula,
wing venation and genital morphology. No molecular
analyses of the family have previously been undertaken,
except one study within the Grumichellini [31]. The use
of molecular data for recovering phylogenetic hypotheses is rapidly becoming a common practice in taxonomy and systematics, and for Trichoptera such data
have been used on levels ranging from the entire order
[20-22], to families [33-36], subfamilies [37], genera
[31,38-40] and single species [41,42].
To examine the robustness of the traditional Leptoceridae classification, we present a first molecular-based
phylogenentic hypothesis of the family. The analyses are
based on sequences from five different genes; comprising the mitochondrial Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
(COI) and the four nuclear markers Cadherin-like gene
(CAD), Elongation factor-1a (Ef-1a), RNA polymerase
II (POL) and Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), with the
latter successfully used for resolving phylogenies within
Lepidoptera [43] but not for Trichoptera. In light of
these results, we propose some changes to the current
classification within the family, including the elevation
of two tribes to subfamily status and the synonymisation
of two genera with two other genera.

Methods
Taxon sampling

Out of the 47 described extant genera of Leptoceridae, we
collected, extracted and sequenced representatives of 35
genera (Additional file 1), including an undescribed genus
from Madagascar. The data comprise representatives from
all recognised tribes as well as some genera of uncertain
tribal placement (e.g. Brachysetodes Schmid and Poecilopsyche Schmid). In most cases, at least two species from
each genus and in the case of monotypic genera two specimens from each species were included. Two widespread
genera (Oecetis and Triplectides) were more extensively
represented in the analysis to add as much genetic variation as possible. The outgroups were chosen based on previously published phylogenetic hypotheses, e.g. Kjer et al.
[21] and Holzenthal et al. [3,22], and include all closely

related and some more distantly related families. Vouchers
are stored in alcohol at the Swedish Museum of Natural
History (NHRS).
DNA extraction & sequencing

Laboratory procedures follow those outlined in Johanson
& Malm [35] for the fragments of the four genes: COI,
EF-1a, CAD and POL. PCR reactions for the IDH fragments were performed with the primer pair deg27F-ino
GGW GAY GAR ATG ACI AGR ATH ATH TGG and
degR-ino TTY TTR CAI GCC CAI ACR AAI CCI CC,
both modified after Wahlberg & Wheat [43], using the
same protocol as the other genes, except with an
annealing temperature of 52°C. Sequencing was accomplished using the same primer pairs as in PCR.
Sequence analyses

The sequences of the IDH gene included a 15 bp length
variable region, due to insertions/deletions of amino
acids (basepair triplets), and were aligned using the
L-INS-i method in the software MAFFT [44]. The
sequences from each of the other genes were length
invariable with disregard to missing bases in the beginning and in the end. These fragments were easily
aligned using ClustalW [45] in the BioEdit Sequence
Alignment Editor [46].
The sequence data were analysed using both maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI). Analyses were performed of the separate genes as well as of
combined datasets, analysed with and without exclusion
of genes and of taxa lacking sequence data for more
than one gene fragment (i.e. voucher DB2 and DO5)
(datasets are available on request from TM).
The MP analyses were performed in TNT 1.1 [47]
using 4,000 replicates of the ‘xmult’ search coupled with
one ‘drift’ and one ‘ratchet’ search, followed by an additional ‘ratchet’ search and a final branch swapping. Multiple trees were collapsed to a strict consensus tree by
the nelsen algorithm. To measure MP support a Jackknife analysis of each data set was performed with 4,000
replicates, each with 10 pseudo-replicates.
The BI analyses were carried out using MrBayes 3.1
[48] on Bioportal http://www.bioportal.uio.no. All analyses were run for 60,000,000 generations and sampled
every 3,000 generations. The first 5,000 (out of 20,000)
trees of each analysis were discarded as burn-in after
visual inspection in Tracer v4.1 [49]. The Bayesian analyses of the single genes as well as the concatenated data
set were performed in two separate ways: one with each
gene fragment treated as one partition and one with each
codon position of each gene sequence treated as one partition. For each of these partitions, the best nucleotide
substitution models were determined using MrModeltest
2.2 [50] under the AKAIKE criterion. The models thus

Malm and Johanson BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/10

invoked in the analyses were for all partitions GTR + I +
G, except EF-1a codon position 2 (F81 + I + G) and POL
codon position 2 (HKY + I). The parameters of character
state frequencies, substitution rates, proportion of invariable sites, and gamma shape were unlinked across the
different partitions for all analyses.
For discussions about clade support, we regarded
clades supported by both MP and BI analyses as more
strongly corroborated than those supported by only one
analysis method.
For conservative interpretation of the molecular phylogeny, equally large samples of trees (exclusive of burnin) were extracted from the posterior distributions of
analyses run under different parameter settings (i.e. previously explained partition settings) and subjected to
majority rule consensus calculation. This composite posterior distribution of trees allows for the most commonly existing groups from the variety of posterior
distributions to be presented in the final phylogeny, irrespective of presence in one or more single analysis trees.
This may result in less resolution than the single analysis posterior phylogenies, but the resulting groups could
be interpreted as more stable.

Leptoceridae. The four monophyletic clades (1) Leptorussa, (2) Grumichellini, (3) Leptocerinae (excluding Leptorussa) and (4) Triplectidinae (excluding Grumichellini)
were consistently recovered, except in the POL analyses
where Poecilopsyche was recovered within Triplectidinae.
The monophyly of Grumichellini was recovered as
(Grumichella Müller,(Atanatolica,(Triplexa, Gracilipsodes Sykora))) in the separate EF-1a and IDH analyses,
as (Atanatolica,(Grumichella,(Triplexa, Gracilipsodes)))
in the CAD and POL analyses, and for COI as ((Grumichella, Atanatolica),(Triplexa, Gracilipsodes)).
In all analyses, except those of the COI sequences, the
subfamily Triplectidinae (excluding Grumichellini) was
divided into Hudsonemini and Triplectidini. In the analysis based on the COI sequences the subfamily was
monophyletic (with exclusion of Grumichellini), but
with an internal basal collapse. Condocerus paludosus
Neboiss was consistently found as sistergroup to Hudsonema flaminii Navás, within Hudsonema, which in the
separate analyses of IDH, COI and CAD also included
Notalina. Symphitoneuria and Triplectidina were recovered as polyphyletic in all single gene analyses and Triplectides was recovered as polyphyletic in the COI
analysis.
Monophyly of Leptocerinae (excluding Leptorussa)
was supported in all separate analyses, but with no
major congruencies in internal topology among them.
Some clades within Leptocerinae were however more
stable, e.g. a monophyletic Oecetini with Oecetis including Ptochoecetis Ulmer; a monophyletic Triaenodini; a
group consisting of Setodes flagellatus Gibbs basally of
Mystacidini + Setodini; Athripsodini s.str. with Ceraclea
and Athripsodes + Homilia lardeuxi Gibon. The new
Madagascaran genus was found as sister taxon to Blyzophilus in the COI and CAD analyses. Poecilopsyche
forms the sister group to Brachysetodes in the COI analyses, to Athripsodes in the EF-1a analyses and to Notalina in the POL analyses. All genera except those
mentioned above were recovered as monophyletic in all
single gene analyses.
The MP analyses of the separate genes (not shown)
produced trees generally congruent with the trees from
the BI analyses, finding the same four basal groups, but
generally the consensus trees were less resolved. Poecilopsyche was recovered within Leptocerinae in the POL
analysis, in contrast to the placement in the BI POL
analyses.

The analyses using BI of the single gene datasets (not

recovered as monophyletic in all but the IDH and POL
genes. Both genes placed Leptorussa Mosely outside of

The phylogenies derived from the BI analyses of the genepartitioned data set (5 partitions) and the gene-codon partitioned data set (15 partitions), did not differ except in
arrangement within the Leptocerinae, as indicated by the
weak posterior probabilities in the composite majority rule

consensus tree in Figure 3. The Leptoceridae was recovered as monophyletic and supported by both MP and BI
analyses. Leptoceridae diverges into two clades: (1) Leptorussa + Triplectidinae (excluding Grumichellini) and (2)
Grumichellini + Leptocerinae (excluding Leptorussa). The
former clade is weakly supported by MP but with high
posterior probability values, presumably reflected by the
differences in the placements of Leptorussa among the
genes, but the latter is better supported by both methods.
The subfamily Triplectidinae (excluding Grumichellini)
consists of the two monophyletic tribes Hudsonemini and
Triplectidini. Within the tribe Hudsonemini, Notalina
forms a sistergroup to the well supported Hudsonema,
including Condocerus paludosus. The Triplectidini is
divided into a group containing Triplectidina (polyphyletic), Lectrides and two New Caledonian Symphitoneuria
species; and one group consisting of two Tasmanian and
Indonesian Symphitoneuria species as sistergroup to a
monophyletic Triplectides. The tribe Grumichellini is, with
support from both analysis methods, recovered as sistergroup to the subfamily Leptocerinae (excluding Leptorussa) and shows a well supported branching pattern of
(Grumichella, (Atanatolica, (Triplexa, Gracilipsodes).
The monophyly of Leptocerinae (excluding Leptorussa) (Figure 3) is well supported, but with many internal clades weakly supported. The clade (Leptocerus,
(Setodes flagellatus, (Mystacidini, Setodini))) forms the
sistergroup to a weakly supported group containing the
remaining Leptocerinae. The monophyly of Leptocerus is
strongly supported and of Mystacidini + Setodini well
supported. Monophyly of Setodes is not supported as it
includes Trichosetodes as well as excludes S. flagellatus.
Among the remaining Leptocerinae the new genus
groups together with Blyzophilus, though not very well
supported. These two form a weakly supported clade
together with Parasetodes McLachlan, Achoropsyche,
Nectopsyche Müller and Leptocerina. The clade comprising Athripsodini s.str.: Ceraclea + Athripsodes (including
Homilia lardeuxi), is weakly supported as sistergroup to
the remaining Leptocerinae. The weakly supported Poecilopsyche and Brachysetodes clade splits from a clade
containing the two well-supported tribes Triaenodini,
including (Adicella McLachlan, (Erotesis, Triaenodes)),
and Oecetini, with Oecetis including Ptochoecetis.
Analyses using BI of data sets with and without the
exclusion of taxa missing more than one sequence (DB2
Genus novum and DO5 Poecilopsyche vidura Schmid)
coupled with the exclusion/inclusion of the mitochondrial COI, yielded phylogenies consistent with previously
described analyses within Triplectidinae, Grumichellini
and Leptorussini, but differing greatly topologically
within the subfamily Leptocerinae (Figure 4). Blyzophilus
is either found in the clade consisting of Nectopsyche,
Parasetodes and Achoropsyche (Figure 4A) or as sister to

Page 8 of 17

Leptocerus (Figure 4C). With the COI sequences
excluded, the Leptocerini-Mystacidini-Setodini clade is
recovered next to Triaenodini. Subsequent analyses without Blyzophilus, to eliminate the most topologically
unstable taxon, place the Leptocerini-Mystacidini-Setodini clade next to Triaenodini (Figure 4D), or as sister to
Triaenodini + Oecetini (Figure 4C).
The combination of 30,000 trees from each BI analysis
of four different combined nuclear datasets (gene and
codon partitioning, with and without mitochondrial
COI), in a composite majority rule consensus of 120,000
trees (Figure 5), yielded a highly similar phylogeny to
that of all taxa and all genes (see Figure 3), except
within Leptocerinae. For this composite consensus analysis, three taxa were excluded a priori: DB2 Genus
novum and DO5 Poecilopsyche vidura, both lacking
sequence data for more than one gene fragment, as well
as FT4 Blyzophilus dorsohamatus Andersen & Kjaerandsen, which proved to be the most topologically unstable
taxon in previous analyses. In this analysis, within Leptocerinae, Nectopsyche is recovered as sistergroup to all
other leptocerines, followed by a clade comprising Parasetodes, Leptocerina and Achoropsyche. Athripsodini
s.str. is the sistergroup to the remaining leptocerines,
where Brachysetodes is recovered as sister clade to
(Oecetini, (Triaenodini, (Leptocerini, (Setodes flagellatus,
(Mystacidini, Setodini))))). None of the basal branching
events within Leptocerinae are strongly supported, as in
the previous analyses.
The MP analysis (not shown) of the full combined
data sets shows highly similar topologies as that given
by the BI analyses, but with minor differences within
Leptocerinae.

Discussion
The results of these phylogenetic analyses (Figures 5, 6
and 7) corroborate earlier hypotheses of infra-Leptoceridae relationships based on morphological characters [6,12,15], but differ in some interesting and
important aspects. The Leptoceridae apparently form
a stable monophyletic group, even though a few single
gene trees disagree (i.e. trees based on either IDH or
POL BI and MP analyses). Even with the conservative
approach used herein, of summarising data from more
than one alternative run, we consistently recover the
same four basal groups within the family: Leptorussini,
Grumichellini, Triplectidini (excluding Grumicellini;
hereafter Triplectidinae s.str.) and Leptocerinae
(excluding Leptorussa; hereafter Leptocerinae s.str.).
Leptorussa (Leptorussini) forms the sister group to the
Triplectidinae in all combined data trees. In some single
gene trees, though, the position of the genus was placed
outside Leptoceridae. Both these placements somewhat
corroborates an earlier hypothesis of the genus as being

very primitive within Leptoceridae [12]. This position is
also corroborated by morphologiy, including the presence of the preapical hind-tibial spurs (Figure 6) and
an apical fork 3 in the female forewing. The genitalia
are unlike those of the Triplectidinae s.tr (Figure 6), e.g.
with a spinelike phallus and very long superior appendages that are almost completely fused with tergum IX.
The Leptorussa also lack the typical Triplectidinae characters of an enlarged anal region of the hind wings, as
well as fork 3 in the male hind wing. Following these
results, the tribe Leptorussini is elevated to form a
monotypic subfamily Leptorussinae Morse, 1981.
The Grumichellini is recovered as monophyletic and
distinct from the other Leptoceridae subfamilies. Usually
it is recovered as sistergroup to Leptocerinae, however,
in the CAD BI and MP gene trees it is found as the sistergroup to Triplectidinae s.str. + Leptorussa. The placement of Grumichellini as the sistergroup to the
Leptocerinae is supported by shared morphological
character states, e.g. a reduced tibial spur formula, 0,0,0
- 2,2,2, and the absence of the discoidal cell in the hind
wings (except in Triplexa) (Figures 6 and 7). The genitalia resemble those of Triplectidinae, e.g. lacking phallic
parameres (present in Leptocerinae), which may be a
plesiomorphic trait (Figure 6). Holzenthal [26] listed 13
synapomorphies for Grumichellini larvae, of which
many are not seen elsewhere in Leptoceridae. Grumichellini is elevated to subfamily Grumichellinae Morse,
1981, based on these results.
The Triplectidinae s.str. is consistently recovered as
monophyletic, except for an aberrant placement of Poecilopsyche in the POL BI trees. The subfamily is divided
into two tribes: Hudsonemini (Hudsonema, Notalina
and Condocerus) and Triplectidini (Notoperata Neboiss,
Symphitoneuria, Triplectides, Triplectidina and Lectrides). The species in Hudsonemini all lack harpagones
and the basoventral lobe on the inferior appendages in
the genitalia (Figure 6), and have unmodified wings
(Figure 6) compared to in Triplectidini, which is characterised by having harpagones and basoventral lobes in
the genitalia (Figure 6), and with modified R-M-Cu of
the male forewings (but unmodified in Notoperata)
(Figure 6). Condocerus paludosus (the type species of
the genus) is always found in close conjunction with
Hudsonema flaminii within Hudsonema. The only major
difference between the two genera is the absence or presence of the crossvein s in the hind wings (Figure 6),
and Condocerus is therefore considered being a junior
synonym of Hudsonema, relative to these results. Both
Symphitoneuria and Triplectidina are recovered as polyphyletic and in need of further taxonomic attention.
The placement of the Tasmanian and Indonesian Symphitoneuria (S. opposita Walker and S. sabaensis Andersen & Huisman) next to Triplectides is interesting with

Page 14 of 17

regard to the wing venation within the tribe, as Symphitoneuria, Lectrides and Triplectidina all share similar
strong modifications of the male forewing venation, which
is much less pronounced in Triplectides (Figure 6).
Triplectidina should be merged with Lectrides and the
New Caledonian Symphitoneuria for easiest emendation,
but more species of the group, with representatives from
Westriplectes Neboiss and Symphitoneurina, are needed
before final conclusions can be made. Thought of as being
non-monophyletic by Morse & Holzenthal [15], Triplectides forms a monophyletic clade in all analyses, except in
some of the single gene trees (i.e. the COI BI and MP analyses and the codon position partitioned CAD BI analysis).
Leptocerinae s.str. is recovered as monophyletic,
except for the aberrant placement of Poecilopsyche in
the POL BI analyses, but usually with weak internal
resolution. The various analyses and datasets give
entirely different hypotheses of the major branching pattern within the subfamily. Some groups are, however,
consistently recovered in this subfamily: the group consisting of Ceraclea, Athripsodes and Homilia (hereafter
Athripsodini s.str.); Oecetini consisting of Oecetis and
Ptochoecetis; Triaenodini consisting of Triaenodes, Adicella and Erotesis; and the group with Setodini (Setodes,
Sericodes and Trichosetodes) and Mystacidini (Mystacides and Tagalopsyche Banks). All these groups appear
stable and their monophylies are supported by morphological character states.
The most robust phylogeny of this subfamily is given
in Figures 5, 6 and 7, for which three taxa were
excluded before analysis due to lack of sequence data
(i.e. DB2 Genus novum sp. and DO5 Poecilopsyche) or
instability in placement between different analyses (i.e.
FT4 Blyzophilus), both possibly inducing erroneous phylogenies. In this phylogeny Nectopsyche is found as the
sistergroup to all other taxa in the subfamily, but without close relation to Parasetodes; the other genus
included in tribe Nectopsychini, based on the reduction
of the stems of the radial sector and M in the hind
wings. Parasetodes seems more affiliated with Achoropsyche (alone in the Achoropsychini) and Leptocerina
(member of the Athripsodini), but the position of Nectopsyche among these taxa in some analyses may indicate a closer relationship between all those four genera.
Some of the analyses including Blyzophilus and the new
genus place those two genera close together with this
group as well (Figures 3 and 4). Athripsodini is not a
monophyletic group according to these analyses, and
should only be used as Athripsodini s.str. (Ceraclea,
Athripsodes and Homilia). Homilia lardeuxi is found
inside of Athripsodes, leading to the conclusion that this
species (and perhaps other Homilia species) belong
there. The generic difference between Homilia and
Athripsodes has been the absence of one of the foretibial

Malm and Johanson BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/10

spurs (1,2,2 from 2,2,2) (Figure 7), a trait that may have
evolved within Athripsodes, but more species of both
genera are needed to clarify the status of Homilia. Brachysetodes and Poecilopsyche are, as hypothesised by
Morse [12] (Figure 1), not closely related to any particular tribe but form a clade basal to the “higher Leptocerinae”, sharing the feature of having narrow hind wings
(Figure 7). In our phylogenetic hypothesis, the group of
“higher Leptocerinae” corresponds well with Morse’s
[12] opinion (Figures 1 and 7), except in the placement
of the two tribes Leptocerini and Oecetini. The Oecetini
clade correctly includes Oecetis and Ptochoecetis, differentiated by the absence of a fork on the M vein in the
hind wing of the latter (Figure 7). Ptochoecetis africana
(type species of the genus) is recovered deeply inside
Oecetis, leading to the conclusion that Ptochoecetis is a
junior synonym of Oecetis. Ptochoecetis africana is
highly similar to certain Oecetis species in the genitalia
(e.g. O. bicuspida) (Figure 7). The tribe Oecetini is
recovered as sistergroup to the (Triaenodini, (Leptocerini,(Setodes flagellatus,(Mystacidini, Setodini)))) clade,
which species share the character state of a posteriorly
extended sternum IX (Figure 7). In our phylogeny,
Triaenodini follows the current classification with Adicella as the sister genus to Erotesis and Triaenodes. The
tribe Leptocerini is recovered as sister to Setodini and
Mystacidini, but in some of the analyses (Figure 4C)
Leptocerini is more closely related to Blyzophilus than
to Setodini and Mystacidini, as hypothesised by Andersen et.al. [16]. The tribe Mystacidini, including Tagalopsyche and Mystacides, is strongly supported as being
monophyletic and forming the sistergroup to Setodini.
A number of species of those two genera share with the
Setodini the reduction of the stem of the radial sector
(stem of R2-5) in the hind wings (Figure 7). The interesting placement of Setodes flagellatus, a very non’Setodes-like’ species, and the inclusion of Trichosetodes
sisyphos Malicky & Prommi within Setodes, indicate
some uncertainty in the status of these genera. By these
results, a new genus should be erected for Setodes flagellatus, and Trichosetodes should be synonymised with
Setodes, the latter solution already indicated by Schmid
[17]. But, in order to conclude anything about the stability and phylogenetic position of these taxa with certainty, more species of the genera (as well as type
species) and of the affiliated genus Hemileptocerus must
be included in the analysis.
Regarding the morphological characters most commonly used for identification and systematic placement
of species within Leptoceridae, i.e. tibial spur formula,
wing venation and male genitalia, Figures 6 and 7 show
that these characters systems are overall consistent
within the various tribes and also between tribes, but that
apomorphic changes often occur. The number of tibial

Page 15 of 17

spurs characterises the basal split within Leptoceridae,
with the Leptorussini + Triplectidinae having a pair of
pre-apical hind-tibial spurs (reduced in some higher triplectidines) that are lacking in Grumichellini and Leptocerinae. The spur numbers are also fairly consistent
within subfamilies and tribes, but often with reductions
in number among the higher clades. Thus, not too much
weight should be given to singular reductions in spur
numbers as generic characters, as they can evolve within
generic lineages, i.e. shown for Gracilipsodes by Malm &
Johanson [31] and as may be the case with Homilia
within Athripsodes. For wing characters, according to
these findings, is the lack of crossvein s in the hind wing
not a synapomorphy for Leptocerinae as earlier proposed,
but a common character state within the family. The
crossvein is present only in Triplectidinae and Triplexa
(Grumichellini). Wing characters are often highly informative on family and genus level, but singular modifications in wing venation such as reductions of apical forks
and reductions in spur number may not be enough to
warrant generic status as they may be apomorphic adaptations within an existing genus (i.e. Ptochoecetis). Many
genitalic characters are hard to track through the entire
tree and are usually most applicable on tribus to species
level, but some characters may be reliable at deeper
levels, i.e. the harpagones within Triplectidinae for separating Hudsonemini from Triplectidini.

Conclusions
This work strongly supports the monophyly of most of
the previously classified groups within the family based
on morphology, and most of the morphological characters discussed herein correspond well with our molecular-based phylogenies. But as stated previously, too
much weight should not be laid on singular spurious
modifications - whether in wing or body characters when describing new higher taxa.
Our molecular-based phylogenetic hypotheses are
robust at the subfamily level as well as the tribal level
within Triplectidinae, but some questions remain unresolved. The utility of yet another gene for resolving the
infra-familiar relationships of Leptocerinae would probably give less impact than better taxon sampling, since
most of the genes show the same intra-relationships.
The inclusion of Nietnerella in future analyses will
answer the question whether or not to include that
genus in the family. The importance of including specimens of the genera Symphitoneurina and Westriplectes
in order to make final conclusions about the relationships within Triplectidini cannot be understated. Representatives of Osflintia and Amazonatolica may resolve
the phylogeny of the Grumichellini. Most important,
though, would a better taxon sampling within Leptocerinae allow more robust hypotheses about tribal and

Malm and Johanson BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/10

generic relationships to be made. Great advances would
probably be made by including specimens of the missing
genera Amphoropsyche Holzenthal, Axiocerina Ross,
Hemileptocerus, Leptecho Barnard, Leptoceriella Schmid,
Neoathripsodes Holzenthal and Russobex StClair. But
even so, this work improves our understanding of the
phylogeny and evolution within the Leptoceridae and its
subgroups, and builds a new platform for further studies
of the family.
