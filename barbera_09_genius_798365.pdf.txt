Abstract
Background: Grid technology is the computing model which allows users to share a wide pletora
of distributed computational resources regardless of their geographical location. Up to now, the
high security policy requested in order to access distributed computing resources has been a rather
big limiting factor when trying to broaden the usage of Grids into a wide community of users. Grid
security is indeed based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) of X.509 certificates and the
procedure to get and manage those certificates is unfortunately not straightforward. A first step to
make Grids more appealing for new users has recently been achieved with the adoption of robot
certificates.
Methods: Robot certificates have recently been introduced to perform automated tasks on Grids
on behalf of users. They are extremely useful for instance to automate grid service monitoring, data
processing production, distributed data collection systems. Basically these certificates can be used
to identify a person responsible for an unattended service or process acting as client and/or server.
Robot certificates can be installed on a smart card and used behind a portal by everyone interested
in running the related applications in a Grid environment using a user-friendly graphic interface. In
this work, the GENIUS Grid Portal, powered by EnginFrame, has been extended in order to
support the new authentication based on the adoption of these robot certificates.
Results: The work carried out and reported in this manuscript is particularly relevant for all users
who are not familiar with personal digital certificates and the technical aspects of the Grid Security
Infrastructure (GSI). The valuable benefits introduced by robot certificates in e-Science can so be

extended to users belonging to several scientific domains, providing an asset in raising Grid
awareness to a wide number of potential users.
Conclusion: The adoption of Grid portals extended with robot certificates, can really contribute
to creating transparent access to computational resources of Grid Infrastructures, enhancing the
spread of this new paradigm in researchers' working life to address new global scientific challenges.
The evaluated solution can of course be extended to other portals, applications and scientific
communities.

Background
In the last few years the needs of many researchers have
become more and more demanding. Recent progresses in
several scientific domains and the new challenges scientists have to face, have made it essential to devise platforms able to ensure appropriate support to complex
multi-discipline research activities. Modern scientists
need to access distributed computational and storage
resources and start collaborative work in order to address
common problems. Grid technology, based on open
standards protocols, is the technology which permits an
efficient sharing and management of a wide range of heterogeneous computational resources such us: supercomputers, storage systems, data resources and instruments,
regardless of their geographical location. "A computational
grid is a hardware and software infrastructure that provides
dependable, consistent, pervasive and inexpensive access to
high-end computational capabilities" [1]. The massive potential of Grid technology is becoming indispensable for
many scientific and industrial applications belonging to
different domains such as: Astronomy, Computational
Chemistry, Earth Science, Financial Simulation, High
Energy Physics and Biomedicine. In the life science
domain for example, today, technology has brought biological information to grow at an impressive rate. The
huge computational resources provided by Grid technology are particularly necessary, for example, in searching
the human genome or to carry out simulations of molecular dynamics for the study of new drugs. Researchers in
the field of the Earth science need to manipulate a lot of
data in order to create complex models to predict weather
forecasts, river floods and earthquakes. The paradigm
introduced by this new technology is conceptually not
unlike electrical grids. In an electrical grid, wall outlets
allow users to link to an infrastructure of resources that
generate, distribute, and bill for electricity. When a user
connects to the electrical grid, he doesn't need to know
from where the power comes from. Grid computing uses
middleware (a virtual layer which allows the user to run his
application in a specific grid resource in a transparent
way) to coordinate disparate IT resources across a network, allowing them to function as a virtual whole. In
order to allow scientists to perform new challenging
researchers expediting the production of scientific results,
e-Infrastructure tools and services need to become features

of researchers' everyday working life. In other words, they
should just see the grid as a seamless extension of their
own workstation for what concerns both job execution/
monitoring and data access/management. What a generic
non-expert user would like to do is just to access the grid
services in a transparent way from everywhere using one
of the different electronic devices such us: desktop, laptop,
PDA, last generation of mobile phone, etc.), as he does
with the World Wide Web (figure 1).
Unfortunately the scenario we have today is a bit different.
Due to the ongoing evolution of this technology so far no
standard is available and there's an initial gap scientists
need to overcome before to start up. Moreover each Grid
user needs to subscribe for a personal X.509 certificate,
adhere to a specific VO and obtain an account on one of
the trusted UI (User Interface) for the project where he is
involved. All these steps may have caused fear and confusion amongst researchers and caused the running away of
potential new users. The Italian INFN [2] and the Italian
web technology company NICE [3] Srl, at the beginning
of 2002, started to develop the GENIUS [4,5] Grid Portal
in order to provide transparent access to the Grid for the
end-users. Thanks to this work, today researchers coming

from different scientific domains can access the Grid to
run their own applications using a conventional web
interface. All the complexity of the underlying gLite grid
middleware [6] will be hidden to the end-user by the portal. In this manuscript we are going to introduce the new
feature designed in this portal in order to support robot
certificates.

Methods
Robot certificate
Starting from the 28th of Feb. 2008 the Italian INFN CA
(Certification Authority) [7] modified its CP/CPS (Certification Policy and Certification Practice Statement of a Certification Authority) to permit users to apply for robot
certificates which now are officially recognized as a standard by the IGTF (International Grid Trust Federation) [8].
UK and Netherlands CAs are already issuing robot certificates. The exploitation of these certificates by other CAs in
the next few years is warmly foreseen. These new certificates have been introduced to permit users, who are not
familiar with deal personal certificates and belonging to a
VO, to experience the Grid paradigm for research activity
reducing the initial barriers. The robot certificate (also
known as portal certificate), associated with a specific
application that the user wants to share with the Grid
community, can be installed in a smart card and used with
a portal by anyone who is interested in running this application in a Grid environment using an user-friendly interface. For security reasons, in order to reduce the risks of
having the portal certificate compromised, the INFN CA
decided to issue these new certificates on the Aladdin eToken smart card [9]. Each smart card can support several
robot certificates: one for each application we want to
share with other users of the same VO. An user's PIN is
prompted every time the certificate stored on the smart
card is read to generate a proxy. The proxy is a term used to
describe a certificate that is derived from, and signed by, a
normal X.509 Public Key Certificate. It is used to grant
access within a PKI based authentication system. Use of a
proxy credential is a common technique used in security
systems to allow entity A to grant to another entity B the
right for B to be authorized with others as if it were A. In
other words, entity B is acting as a proxy on behalf of
entity A.

Once the robot certificate is safely stored on the eToken
smart card, the mkproxy shell script developed at
NIKHEF [10] can be used to generate grid proxies reading
the certificate directly from it. This script requires some
special programs and libraries, which need to be installed
before attempting to use it. Starting from a single robot
certificate installed on a Aladdin eToken PRO, a user can
generate a plain grid proxy by issuing the command as
shown in figure 2.

Figure 2
Creation of a plain proxy
Creation of a plain proxy. Generation of a user proxy
using the mkproxy script.

In this example a plain proxy is signed by the robot certificate stored on the eToken with the given label
Robot:MrBayes. Once the plain grid proxy is generated, it
is possible to add the VOMS (Virtual Organization Management Service) [11] extensions by issuing the command
voms-proxy-init using the noregen option as
shown in figure 3.
With the mkproxy script a proxy certificate is generated
for the user. This proxy is used to access Grid and run
applications. In this work we have extended the architecture of the portal by adding the functionality introduced
by this script. As the proxy certificate has been created the
user can start to access the Grid. Since the beginning, the
adoption of a personal certificate to access Grid resources
has represented a limiting factor for the real spreading of
this paradigm. Many researchers would be interested in
using Grid as a tool to resolve problems and speed up the
creation of scientific results, but the basis of the PKI risks
to discourage many of them. The benefits introduced by
robot certificates in Life Science are far reaching because

they can contribute to make transparent the access in Grid
of biologists interested to run some specific applications.
In the next sub-sections the architecture of the GENIUS
Grid Portal, powered by EnginFrame, will be presented
and the work carried out to extend its framework to support these new certificates will be described in detail.
The GENIUS Architecture
GENIUS portal, based on EnginFrame framework, has an
architecture as shown in figure 4:

• The client side (top left in the figure) represented by a
user's workstation running a web browser. Thanks to
recent modern client side technologies, many kinds of
devices can be used in addition to usual notebooks or
workstations, like palmtops or new generation of mobile
phones;
• the protocols (top right in the figure): the users can use
different protocols to access the presentation engine over
services, the exposed gateways are available for portlets,
web services and RSS; at the present, these protocols can
be used by third party clients and not vice versa, accessing
the virtualized services;
• the server side (right in the figure): a UI machine
(equipped with the LCG/gLite middleware services able to
submit jobs and manage data on the Grid) which runs the
Apache Web Server, the Java/XML portal framework EnginFrame [12], developed by NICE Srl, and GENIUS itself.
The server block is composed by:
‫ ؠ‬the presentation engine for the rendering of layouts
and XSL/XML streams, based on leading WEB stand-

ards, provides access to underlying services via https,
including html, soap and RSS; also the XML virtualization layer provides a set of XML processing functions
that simplify the management of information coming
from plug-in extensions;
‫ ؠ‬the layer for the Authentication and ACL (Access
Control List) management, a core component, with
many options to restrict the views of services to different profiles of users, influencing the behaviour of
other services;
‫ ؠ‬the Data Management and Virtualization layer provides an abstraction of access to remote data and
sources and support for a complete data life-cycle;
• The Application kits (left centre side): make the abstraction layer that hides the business logic of specific end-user
applications, on the right hand side (right centre side)
other transversal services that allow the VOMS Proxy
authentication by user X509 certificate, the access to X11
interactive application using VNC [13] over SSL in secure
way, and Monitoring; the Applications are developed by
plug-in extensions, and GENIUS code itself is developed
like a plug-in to the EnginFrame core;
• The remote resources (bottom right in the figure): the
Grid, computational resources and distributed data;
Briefly, thanks to the Agent-Server design of the EnginFrame core, the EF Server manages the end user browsing
by providing web pages via https, talks to the EF Agent,
expects XML response from the Agent; on the other side,
the EF Agent translates requests from the EF Server into
actions on the computing resources, (i.e. on the gLite User
Interface), with the right credentials and correct user-id on
the machine, and translates the response from the UI into
XML. Using the EnginFrame services the user can interact
with files on the UI and, from there, the user can send jobs
to the Grid and manage the data of the given Virtual
Organization the user belongs to. The use of the web interface eliminates any problem connected to the need of a
particular Operating System and/or middle-ware running
on the client, and to the locations themselves of the client
and the server: the user can interact with the grid from everywhere and with "everything". Making use EnginFrame
capability of services virtualization, GENIUS is transparently compliant with latest versions of the LCG [14]/gLite
middle-ware, and can be easily installed on a variety of
Linux flavours, ranging from RedHat 9 to Scientific Linux,
both 32 and 64 bits platforms. The multi-layered architecture of EnginFrame greatly simplifies the development of
Web Portals exposing computing services that can run on
a broad range of different computational Grid systems. In
the last few years the architecture of the portal has been

successfully customized to run applications of different
scientific domains such as: Life Science, Humanities, Earth
Science, Astro-Particle Physics, HEP. Due to its modularity
architecture of the EnginFrame framework it is considered
a Grid gateway.
Accessing the Grid using a robot certificate and the
GENIUS Grid Portal
The Service Definition Files (SDF™) are the core of the
EnginFrame framework. Basically they are simple highlevel XML files which describe how to link the existing
command-line world to users' Web interface. Each SDF
must have an .xml extension and, in order to be processed,
must be included in the DOC_ROOT of the Web Server.
Behind the Web Server, data is managed through the
Spooler abstraction. A Spooler is a dedicated zone in the
file system. It's used for hosting files provided by users
(e.g., input files) or generated by other services (e.g., output or temporary files).

In this work one of these SDF has been modified to enable
the features introduced by these new certificates with the
portal and generate proxy certificates from the robot one.
If no robot certificates are available on the server, the normal authentication based on a Java applet which request
a personal user's certificate will be performed. The generation of the proxy certificate starting from a robot one is
performed in a transparent way for the end-user. Thanks
to this work the new scenario depicted in the figure 5 is
now possible.
If the smart card is available on the server, an automatic
service, deployed in the portal, will drive the user to create
a temporary proxy before running the application con-

nected with the robot certificate in Grid. Hereafter follows
the action invoked from the portal to generate the proxy
using the robot certificate.
After proxy creation, the user is automatically redirected to
the home page of the application connected with the certificate. Any other attempt to access unauthorized services
will be blocked by the portal. Any request submitted by
the user via the portal will be performed in the Grid in a
transparent way according to the workflow described in
figure 6. All the complexity of the underlying middleware
is completely hidden by the portal. When the results
about the computations are available, the user can retrieve
them using a conventional web browser.
Users Tracking System (UTS)
Since with this approach the access to a Grid infrastructure
is opened to a wide basin of users (just a simple account
on the server where the portal runs is needed), in order to
enhance the security and monitor the payload produced
by users who access the Grid using the portal certificate,
an UTS has been designed and deployed in the GENIUS
architecture. Based on an underlying MySQL database and
on PHP, JavaScript and XML code, the system registers the
user's payload generated in Grids by the robot certificate.
So far the system has been instructed to catch the following events: opening/closing of user' session and job submission instances. All the accounting data collected by
UTS can be examined only by the administrator. Several
ad-hoc services, with a restricted policy, have been
designed in the portal so as to allow the administrator to
interact with the UTS using a web interface only. With the
introduction of this additional features it is possible to
monitor, in each moment, who is working and what they
doing on the grid resources. Figure 7 shows an example of
accounting data collected by the system.

tein, and even arbitrary hereditary discrete characters.
Another peculiarity of the application is that it allows the
usage of mixed models, such as using different models for
different parts of each biosequence with the possibility to
share parameters among the different models.

Four different system views to inspect the accounting data
produced in Grid by a robot certificate are available:
• a "global view" which allows the administrator to
retrieve a complete dump of all the information registered in the database;
• a "session view" which reports only information
about all the sessions started and closed by the users;
• an "application view" which reports information
about the application submission;
• an "advanced query" which allows administrator to
perform some advanced queries by putting a specific
"where" clause in the dedicated text area.

Results
The GENIUS Grid portal that transparently supports robot
certificates has been successfully used by non-grid users,
involved in the context of the LIBI Italian Laboratory for
Bioinformatics [15] to run a bioinformatics application
on a Grid Infrastructure. In this section some details about
the application and its workflow which has been set up in
order to run this application on the EGEE [16] Grid Infrastructure are shown. The application MrBayes (Ronquist
and Huelsenbeck 2003) [17] produces a Bayesian phylogenetic inference among different aligned biosequences.
The inference allows identifying the distribution of the
most likely genetic relationship among the set of chosen
biosequences and at the same time the best set of values
for the parameters of the postulated model of evolution of
the biosequences. MrBayes has a great richness of model
of evolution for DNA (both as nucleotide and codon),
RNA (model for evolution of doublet of nucleotide to
model the secondary structure of an RNA molecule), pro-

The program uses a Metropolis-Coupled Monte Carlo
Markov Chain (MCMCMC) to perform the Markovian
integration necessary to solve numerically the Bayesian
equation. The MCMCMC approach allowed the development of a parallel version of the algorithm (Altekar et al.
2004) [18]. The result of the numerical integration is a
sample from the posterior distribution allowing interesting development for future grid implementation. In fact
different samples of the posterior distribution could be
merged together to increase reliability of the results and to
check for the convergence of the algorithm. But it should
be noted that the program is not perfectly scalable given
that for moderately complex problems the time necessary
to reach stationary, and to produce useful sampling, is not
so small compared to the maximum time allowed in each
single CPU of EGEE.
The input required is a single text file, nexus formatted
(Maddison et al. 1997) [19], subdivided in a data block
and MrBayes block in which the models and the parameter of Markovian integration are defined. The output is
composed of three kinds of large files (typically of several
hundreds of mega base each) that describe, respectively,
the posterior distribution of numerical and topological
parameters, and several diagnostic measures related to the
mixing of Markov chains and the converging of the algorithm as whole.
The client side of the application submission workflow
(figure 8) is represented by a user's workstation running a
web browser. The server side is represented by a gLite UI
machine, equipped with the latest gLite middleware services to submit jobs and manage data on Grid, the Apache
Web Server, the Java/XML portal framework EnginFrame
developed by NICE Srl and the GENIUS Grid Portal itself.
After the user has logged in, a proxy certificate is requested
by the portal in order to access the distributed resources of
a Grid Infrastructure according to the GSI [20] standard. If
the Aladdin eToken PRO 32 Kb with he robot certificate is
available in the server, it will be used by the portal to generate the needed proxy for the user before granting access
to the Infrastructure. This operation is completely transparent for the end-user. In a few minutes the robot certificate stored on the usb token is read to generate the proxy
certificate. Once the proxy certificate has been successfully
created, the user is automatically redirected to the home
page of the application. Thanks to the services developed
with the portal the user can provide input settings for the
application before submitting its parallel version in Grid.

MRBAYES: A simple bioinformatics use's case

figure depicts the application workflow which has been set
up to permit bioinformatics to run Bayesian Phylogenetic
Inference on a large scale.

Moreover, in order to improve the reliability of the application workflow and deal with possible job failures a JST
(Job Submission Tool) [21], developed by INFN Bari, has
also been introduced into the architecture. This tool has
been adopted for the submission of large number of jobs
in an almost unattended way. It is based on the concept of
"task" to be executed. The entire problem is first subdivided into elementary tasks: then all the tasks are inserted
into a DB server. In the submission phase all the jobs are
identical, in fact when the job is submitted it does not
know which task has to be executed. Only when the job
lands and starts executing on a WN does it request the central DB a task to execute. Information on the execution of
each task is logged in the central DB. Only if all steps are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S21

correctly executed by the job, is the status of that particular
task on the central DB updated to "Done". In this way the
central DB provides a monitoring of the task execution
and no manual intervention is required to manage the
resubmission of the failed tasks: tasks which are found in
a "running" state after a given time interval, are considered failed and automatically reassigned to new jobs. The
tool is also able to provide the monitoring of any kind of
debugging information that could be useful to understand
how the jobs are going. The Database schema used to
monitor jobs on the grid allows the definition of the
information to be reported at run-time in a completely
dynamic way, as it is based on the concept of "Variable"
and "Value". The tool has been used with success for the
submission of the order of hundreds of thousands of jobs
to the Grid required by specific applications and can also
be used for exploiting all the computational resources
available on the Grid. Figure 9 shows the monitoring and
the visualization system developed for the bioinformatics
application.

Conclusion
The present work aims at reporting the work performed by
the Italian INFN in order to adopt robot certificates in eScience. This work demonstrates how it's possible to
access and exploit the massive potential of grid technology without worrying about the complexity of the GSI
authentication. The benefits introduced by this work are
far-reaching for several user communities and applications. The valuable results depicted in this work can be
easily extended to other scientific domains and different
applications. The GENIUS Grid Portal and its features is
the official portal of the GILDA t-Infrastructure [22] for
Grid dissemination and training set up. It is managed by
INFN in the context of the EGEE Projects, but some other
regional Grid projects such as Trigrid [23] and PI2S2 [24]
are adopting the GENIUS portal with success, porting on
the web interface many applications running on their
infrastructure, being such a powerful gateway to the grid
resources with the required security. The solution evaluated and described in this manuscript is not of course
restricted to the GENIUS Grid Portal and can be easily
extended to other portals.
