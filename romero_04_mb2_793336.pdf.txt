Abstract
Background: Identification and characterization of novel Plasmodium gene families is necessary for
developing new anti-malarial therapeutics. The products of the Plasmodium falciparum gene, MB2,
were shown previously to have a stage-specific pattern of subcellular localization and proteolytic
processing.
Results: Genes homologous to MB2 were identified in five additional parasite species, P. knowlesi,
P. gallinaceum, P. berghei, P. yoelii, and P. chabaudi. Sequence comparisons among the MB2 gene
products reveal amino acid conservation of structural features, including putative S1 and GTPbinding domains, and putative signal peptides and nuclear localization signals.
Conclusions: The combination of domains is unique to this gene family and indicates that MB2
genes comprise a novel family and therefore may be a good target for drug development.

Background
Malaria causes 300–500 million clinical cases and more
than one million deaths world-wide each year [1]. Efforts
to reduce disease that rely on chemotherapeutics and
insecticides are undermined by an increase in drug and
insecticide resistance. Development of new control mechanisms is facilitated by an understanding of basic Plasmodium biology, and the identification of unique and
vulnerable properties that can be exploited by therapeutics, vaccines or other control strategies. However, in spite
of more than a century of malaria research, much is still
unknown about the biology of Plasmodium parasites due
in large part to the extraordinary complexity of their life
cycles. These parasites are able to infect vertebrate and

invertebrate hosts, survive in intracellular and extracellular environments, invade multiple types of cells, and
evade the immune responses of both hosts. At each stage
of the life cycle, new sets or combinations of proteins are
expressed, therefore the biology of the parasite is continually changing. The uniqueness and complexity of this parasite is underscored by the revelation that approximately
two-thirds of the P. falciparum open reading frames
(ORFs) predicted from the recently completed genome
sequence do not match proteins in existing databases [2].
This finding presents a unique opportunity to identify and
characterize novel Plasmodium proteins that may be
exploited for therapeutic benefits.

The P. falciparum gene, MB2, is a single copy gene on chromosome five, and is expressed as a single mRNA species in
blood-stage parasites [3]. The conceptual translation
product is 1610 amino acids (aa) in length and has a predicted mass of 187 kDa. The gene product was divided
into three domains based on primary sequence properties:
an amino-terminal basic domain (B), a central acidic
domain (A), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (G) with
high sequence similarity to GTP-binding domains of
prokaryotic IF-2. The MB2 gene product is expressed in
sporozoites, asexual blood stages (ABS) and gametocytes,
however, it displays a pattern of stage-dependent cellular
localization and apparent proteolytic processing throughout the parasite life cycle.
Genes homologous to the P. falciparum MB2 (PfMB2)
have been identified in five Plasmodium species. Alignment of the conceptual translation products of all MB2
genes reveals a distinctive primary amino acid structure
characterizing this gene family. Four conserved sequences
of amino acids conceivably important for function define
this structure. Two of the four sequences share homology
to known functional domains: 1) an S1 domain found in
RNA-binding proteins is located in the amino-terminal B
domain; and 2) the previously-mentioned putative GTPbinding domain located in the carboxyl-terminus. Two
additional sequences in the A domain have no known
similarities or functional correlations with any known
proteins in existing databases. In addition to these conserved sequences, three types of predicted signaling motifs
are present in all MB2 gene products identified. These
include signal peptides, nuclear localization sequences
(NLSs) and putative cell-surface retention signals (CRSs).

Results
Distribution of MB2 gene in apicomplexa
Primary characterizations of MB2 genes were carried out
by heterologous screening of libraries and database
searches of Plasmodium species and other apicomplexa
(Babesia bovis, Eimeria tenella, Theileria annulata, T. parva,
Cryptosporidium parvum and Toxoplasma gondii). Corresponding genes with open reading frames (ORFs) were
found only in the malaria parasites.
Determination of ORFs in the MB2 gene family
The PfMB2 B domain (aa 1 to 489) was used to search the
Sanger Institute Pathogen Sequencing Unit P. knowlesi
database. A >20 kilobase (kb) genomic contig,
c000500602, was identified (Table 1). A 4128 bp ORF (nt
12317 to 16447) within this contig was designated
PkMB2 based on similarity to PfMB2 and the other MB2
homologous genes. The predicted translation product is
1376 aa in length.

Seven contiguous cDNA and genomic DNA fragments
identified by library screening and gene amplification
techniques were assembled to construct the PgMB2 contig. (Table 1). A genomic clone spans 4011 bases of the
4638 bp ORF and ~450 bp of the 3'-end were determined
by amplification from genomic DNA, therefore, only
~200 bases were from cDNA sequence alone and not confirmed from genomic DNA. The contig incorporates more
than 5600 bp and includes 5'- and 3'-end non-coding
sequences. The complete PgMB2 ORF encodes a predicted
translation product 1546 aa in length.

Five genomic shotgun sequences were identified by BLAST
search [4] of the Sanger Institute Pathogen Sequencing
Unit P. berghei (ANKA strain) database using sequences
derived from conserved regions of the B and G domains of
MB2 ORFs (Table 1). In addition, a genomic contig, accession no. AZ2527175, was identified from the PlasmoDB
database. These six contigs represent the first 1350 bp and
final 987 bp of the PbMB2 ORF. Primers derived from
these regions (PbMB2-1 and PbMB2-2, Table 2) were used
to amplify the internal missing sequence from P. berghei
genomic DNA. The complete ORF of PbMB2 consists of
3972 nucleotides and the predicted translation product
spans 1324 aa. A region (nt 33 to 49) in the 5'-end of this
gene contains 15 (thymine) residues interrupted by a guanine (nt 36) and a cytosine (nt 41) and results in a predicted translation initiation codon 60 nts upstream of the
predicted translation initiation codons of PyMB2 and
PcMB2.
A 10 kb genomic contig, MALPY00946, identified by Stefan Kappe (Seattle Biomedical Research Institute) from a
BLAST search of the PlasmoDB database, contains
sequences from the P. yoelii MB2 gene (Table 1). 3352 bp
of this contig (accession no. AABL01000943) represent a
partial ORF with similarity to PfMB2 extending to the 3'end of the gene. The complete 5'-end sequence was
obtained with gene amplification techniques using a
cDNA library and genomic DNA as templates. The complete PyMB2 ORF consists of 4140 nucleotides and
encodes a predicted protein 1380 aa in length. There is a
region in the 5'-end (nt -26 to -12, where +1 is the first
nucleotide in the translation initiation codon) that con-

tains a long stretch of thymine (T) bases (15 or 16 Ts).
Removal of one thymine (15 Ts) results in a truncation of
the 5'-end. Therefore, to confirm the number of bases in
this poly-T tract (15 Ts), an independent gene amplification reaction was performed with Pfx polymerase and the
resulting product was sequenced.
A total of 22 genomic shotgun sequences identified from
BLAST searches of the P. chabaudi database were used to
construct three non-overlapping contigs representing
regions of PcMB2 (Table 1). The sequences of the missing
regions were determined by gene amplification from a P.
chabaudi cDNA library using primers (PcMB2-1, PcMB2-2,
PcMB2-3 and PcMB2-4, Table 2) derived from the three
contigs. There is a poly-T tract in the 5'-end of the gene (nt
-26 to -12). The numbers of thymine bases (14 Ts interrupted by one cytosine (nt-22)) were re-confirmed by
independent gene amplification with Pfx polymerase and
sequencing. The complete PcMB2 ORF consists of 3921
nucleotides, which are translated into 1307 aa.
Conserved regions
Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the various
MB2 gene products reveals four conserved domains (Figure 1). While the ordering of the domains is conserved,
the overall amino acid identity calculated by the Clustal
method among the predicted products is low, only 38–
44%, except among rodent parasites, which are much
higher (72–79%) (Table 3). This higher level of identity is
consistent with phylogenetic analyses inferred from previous Plasmodium sequence comparisons [5,6].

from several proteins including a human ribosomal S1

prokaryotic stress proteins containing S1 domains.
Alignment of the MB2 S1 domain with other known S1
domains reveals amino acid sequence conservation at several of the highly conserved residues (four of six) reported
for known S1 domains [10] (Figure 3). Furthermore, secondary structure predictions of the putative MB2 S1
domain performed by PSIpred [11] and PROF predictions
[12] predicted a βββαββ structure, similar to that solved
for the E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase [10].
Two of the four conserved domains were identified in
regions corresponding to the central A domain of PfMB2

and these were designated A1 and A2 (Figure 4). These
domains have an average of 61% and 49% identity with
PfMB2, respectively. Neither region generated significant
similarity results when GenBank, EMBL, and PlasmoDB
databases were searched.
The G domain, previously identified as having similarity
to the GTP-binding domain of prokaryotic IF-2 [3], was
conserved highly among the homologous gene products
(an average of 65% identity with the sequences encoded
by PfMB2). Dever et al. [13] identified three motifs,
GXXXXGK, DXXG, and NKXD, each separated by 40–80
aa, that are conserved among different classes of GTPbinding proteins. All three motifs are present in the MB2
gene products (Figure 5). The first and second motifs are
involved in interactions with the phosphate portion of the

GTP molecule [13]. The sequences in MB2 proteins,
GHINHGK and DTPG, respectively, adhere strictly to
these motifs and are conserved absolutely among MB2
gene products. The last motif is involved in nucleotide
specificity and the MB2 gene products vary from the consensus sequence. In all MB2 gene products, the consensus
asparagine (N) is replaced by a threonine (T) (TKXD; with
the X being valine (V), methionine (M) or T [rodent
genes]). Replacement of the polar residue, asparagine (N),
with a different polar residue, tyrosine (Y), or a basic residue, lysine (K), abolished the GTP-binding activity of
ras21 mutant protein [14]. It is unknown what effect, if
any, the threonine replacement observed in MB2 gene
products has on nucleotide binding or specificity. Other
putative P. falciparum G domains have the conserved
NKXD motif (Figure 6) suggesting that this divergence
from the third motif is not a feature of Plasmodium GTPbinding proteins in general, rather that it may be a definitive characteristic of MB2 gene products.

The conservation of the G domain among the MB2 gene
family and the similarities to elongation factors could
indicate that these parasite products are functional analogues of the translation factors. However, P. falciparum
has a number of genes whose products are characterized
as elongation factors and none of these have S1 domains
(Figure 6).
Predicted signal sequences
Signal peptide predictions by SignalP [15], PSORT and
PSORT II [16] computer programs for all five homologous
gene products produced similar, conflicting results as
reported for PfMB2 [3]. SignalP predicted signal peptides
and cleavage sites (Figure 2) while PSORT and PSORT II
gave low scores, predicting no cleavage sites for all MB2
gene products, except PyMB2 (PSORT II). Putative transmembrane domains were identified by the SMART computer program [8,9] in only two MB2 translation
products, PgMB2 and PbMB2, and placed at aa 5–24 in
PgMB2 and aa 20–42 in PbMB2, overlapping the

Page 9 of 13

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:83

predicted signal peptides. However, using the TMpred
program [17], transmembrane domains were identified in
all six MB2 gene products in regions overlapping the signal peptides. As was proposed for PfMB2 [3], it is possible
that the MB2 gene products are attached to the surface of
sporozoites by an uncleavable signal anchor. The PyMB2
and PcMB2 signal sequences are truncated due to a frame
shift caused by a deletion of a thymine residue in a poly(T) tract. Without this deletion the amino-terminal
sequences are highly conserved among the rodent parasite
signal sequences.
PSORT II and PROSITE programs predicted multiple
nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in B and A domains for
all proposed translation products. The occurrence of multiple NLSs in a protein is not unusual, and it is thought
that weak NLSs may be additive or synergistic [18]. All
ORFs encode predicted NLSs in the same two regions of
their central domains (Figure 4).
Cell surface retention sequences (CRS) are polybasic
domains implicated in membrane localization [19,20].
They appear to be homologous to NLSs and may function
as such when appropriate. There is evidence that adjacent
sequences may be important in targeting a protein to the
plasma membrane or nucleus such that the context of
polybasic motifs may determine their function. All translation products have potential CRS similar to that
described for PfMB2 [3].
Examination of the amino acid composition of the
homologous gene products reveals that PkMB2 and
PgMB2 encode regions with a predicted negative charge
preceding the G domain, but these regions are shorter
(322 and 254 aa, respectively) than the 496 aa A domain
encoded by PfMB2. The rodent malaria MB2 gene products each have much shorter acidic domains of approximately 80–130 aa immediately preceding the G domain.
Therefore, the N-terminal basic and central acidic
domains assigned to PfMB2, based on amino acid
composition, are not conserved in structure or size, but an
acidic domain immediately preceding the G domain is
present in all MB2 gene products. This domain, however,
varies widely in size and composition among MB2 gene
products.
Repeat sequences in MB2 gene products
Imperfect, tandemly-repeated sequences are encoded in
the non-conserved regions of three MB2 genes: PfMB2,
PgMB2 and PyMB2. In addition to the repeated sequence
described by [3], an additional repeat region was identified in the G domain of PfMB2, from aa 1315 to 1338
(Figure 5). This six-residue sequence, N, M, T, R, D, D, is
repeated four times. A highly-charged, imperfect repeat is
encoded in the central domain of PgMB2 (Figure 4). This

V/I, D, K, K, E, K, D, is repeated eleven times with a fiveresidue non-repeat occurring between the second and
third motifs. PyMB2 encodes a five-residue motif, P, N, S/
C, E, N/S, that is tandemly repeated nine times in the
central domain (Figure 4) and a six-residue motif, E, N, G,
E, N/G, D, repeated four times in the G domain (Figure 5).

Discussion
Alignment of MB2 conceptual translation products from
the six Plasmodium species reveals a conservation of overall structure that in the absence of other similar genes
allows us to conclude that these are orthologous members
of a gene family. Of four conserved regions, two have similarity to known protein domains, specifically the putative
S1 domain and GTP-binding domain (G domain). The S1
domain was identified first in the E. coli ribosomal S1
protein [10]. This protein consists of six copies of an ~70
aa motif, and has an essential role in facilitating translation initiation by interacting with the ribosome and
mRNA. S1 domains were subsequently found in a variety
of proteins including eukaryotic initiation of translation
factor 2 alpha, eIF2α, bacterial and chloroplast translation
initiation factor-1, IF-1, a bacterial exonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, PNPase, and RNA-helicases [10].
Common themes among these proteins are associations
with RNA and ribosomes, and an involvement in initiation of translation and mRNA turnover. S1 domains also
have been found in DNA-binding proteins including a
human S1-like protein that demonstrates preferential
DNA-binding in vitro [21].
Structural analysis of a representative S1 domain from E.
coli PNPase revealed a five-stranded antiparallel β-barrel
[10]. This structure belongs to an ancient superfamily of
RNA-binding proteins called OB fold proteins. Members
of this DNA and RNA-binding protein family feature coldshock domains (CSD) found in bacterial cold-shock
proteins, eukaryotic Y-box proteins, and S1 domains.
From cellular localization studies of PfMB2 products, we
know that the putative S1 domain of MB2 is localized in
the nucleus in asexual blood stages of this parasite [3]. If
this domain is a functional nucleic acid-binding domain,
a role for MB2 in the nucleus could include binding DNA
to regulate gene expression in a stage-specific way, perhaps as a transcription factor. Two lines of evidence indicate that gene regulatory components of Plasmodium,
including promoters and transcription factors, are unique
to these organisms. 1) Plasmodium promoters do not
function in transfection experiments in mammalian cells
[22]; and 2) SV40 and other viral promoters that are active
in eukaryotes fail to drive gene expression in P. falciparum
[22,23]. Furthermore, with the exception of a TATA-box
binding protein, no transcription factors have yet been
cloned [22,23]. Therefore, if MB2 is a transcription factor,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/83

the unique structure of this gene is not surprising. Alternatively, if MB2 binds mRNA, it could be involved in the
post-transcriptional regulation of pre-mRNA in the
nucleus of ABSs.

purpose of the repeat regions in MB2 gene products is
unknown, but their presence support the hypothesis that
homologous proteins are on the surface of some stage of
the parasite and exposed to the immune system.

The MB2 G domains are most similar to the family of
GTP-binding domains involved in protein synthesis, specifically those of prokaryotic IF-2 and elongation factors.
Initiation of translation factors, IF-2, are essential for initiation of protein synthesis. They recruit the initiator tRNA
and conduct it as Met-tRNAf . eIF2.GTP ternary complex.
Eukaryotic IF-2 is composed of three polypeptide chains
complexed throughout the initiation cycle (reviewed in
[24]). Elongation factors containing this domain promote
GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the A site
of ribosomes and catalyze the translocation of synthesized protein from A to P sites.

Conclusions

The S1 and G domains identified in predicted MB2 gene
products are commonly found in proteins involved in the
protein synthesis pathway, and this could be an indication that this is the pathway in which MB2 is involved.
However, word search of the Pubmed and ProDom
databases for "S1 and GTP-binding" yielded no proteins
that contain both of these domains. Furthermore, as we
have shown, the P. falciparum genome contains other
genes that are better fits in terms of amino acid conservation for the roles in protein synthesis. It is interesting that
both of these domains are found in two separate proteins
subunits of the initiation factor, eIF2 [4,24].

In this post-genomics era, comparative genomics between
different species of malaria parasites is now a possibility.
Consequent to this will be the rapid discovery of homologues of less well-conserved genes. Identification of
homologous genes enables researchers to identify functional domains that may not be obvious in the analysis of
single genes. As 60% of predicted P. falciparum genes identified in the genome sequencing project do not match
existing database sequences [2], the importance of utilizing this method of comparative genomics to derive
functional clues about these novel genes is evident. This
large number of novel genes presents a unique opportunity to identify and characterize proteins that can be targeted by anti-malarial therapeutic agents, vaccines and
other methods of controls [28,29].

With the exception of MB2 gene products from rodent
species, the intervening sequences of amino acids between
the conserved domains are not similar. These regions may
be divergent due to a lack of selective pressure acting on
them to maintain similarity. This suggests these domains
are not important for function, but rather may have a
structural role that is not strictly sequence-dependent.
Alternatively, this divergence may reflect the potential dissimilarity of ligands in the respective hosts [25]. However,
the putative antigenic regions of the P. falciparum MB2 B
region [3] are not conserved in the homologous genes at
the primary sequence level. Also, there are no repeat
domains in the B regions of the homologous genes.
The non-conserved regions of P. falciparum, P. gallinaceum
and P. yoelii contain repeated amino acid motifs. Many
malarial antigens, including CS, TRAP, and merozoite surface antigens (MSA), contain short, tandemly repeated
motifs [26]. Much of the antibody response to malaria
parasites is directed towards these repeat regions. Repeat
regions in surface proteins of several different parasites,
which elicit ineffective T-cell-independent antibody
responses, have been hypothesized to divert immuneresponses away from more critical epitopes [26,27]. The

We have identified six orthologous MB2 genes and comparisons of the conceptual translation products of these
genes have highlighted domains that may be important
for function, specifically two domains found in proteins
involved in protein synthesis. Furthermore, analysis of
predicted protein characteristics suggests that localization
signals are conserved. Therefore, the structural characteristics that define the MB2 gene family consist of the capacity
to encode four conserved domains, including a S1 and
putative GTP-binding domain, a signal sequence and one
or more NLSs.

Methods
Identification of MB2 genes
Computer-assisted alignment of the amino acid sequence
in the predicted PfMB2 G-domain with other IF-2 G
domains revealed three conserved sequence motifs found
in known GTP-binding proteins [13]. Two of these motifs,
GHINHGK and DTPGHEAF, were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers, PgMB2-1 and PgMB2-2
(Table 2), that were used to amplify a product from a P.
gallinaceum genomic DNA (strain 8A, gift of Ken Vernick,
University of Minnesota). The resulting 165 base-pair
(bp) gene fragment was used to amplify an 118 bp
homologous probe using the specific primers, PgMB2-3
and PgMB2-4 (Table 2), to screen a number of P. gallinaceum libraries. A near full-length PgMB2 gene sequence
was compiled using information derived from seven
clones isolated from three libraries: a genomic library (gift
of David Kaslow, Vical, San Diego), a salivary gland sporozoite cDNA library and an oocyst sporozoite cDNA
library. The latter two libraries were made from parasites
isolated from infected mosquitoes (D. Fidock, B.

Beerntsen, and A.A. James, unpublished). Missing 3'-end
sequence was obtained by inverse gene amplification
techniques using P. gallinaceum genomic DNA (gift of
Joseph Vinetz, University of California, San Diego)
digested with the TaqI restriction enzyme and the genespecific primers, PgMB2-5 and PgMB2-6 (Table 2) derived
from the known sequence. The sequence of this amplification product was confirmed by independent gene
amplification with a high-fidelity polymerase, Pfx (Invitrogen) and the gene specific primers, PgMB2-7 and
PgMB2-8 (Table 2).
A partial ORF with homology to P. falciparum MB2 was
identified from the P. yoelii genome sequence project
(Table 1). The complete sequence of the ORF was determined by amplifying a product from a P. yoelii blood stage
cDNA library (strain 17X, ATCC: MR4) using a primer,
PyMB2-1 (Table 2), derived from the original genomic
contig (Table 1), and an anchored vector primer, T7.
Inverse gene amplification was performed using P. yoelii
genomic DNA (gift of Andy Waters, Leiden University
Medical Center), digested with TaqI and amplified using
the specific primers, PyMB2-2 and PyMB2-3 (Table 2), or
digested with Mbo I and amplified using specific primers,
PyMB2-3 and PyMB2-4 (Table 2). All primers were
derived from the known sequence.
Full-length or partial MB2 ORFs from P. knowlesi, P.
berghei and P. chabaudi were identified in the PlasmoDB
http://www.plasmodb.org or Sanger Institute Pathogen
Sequencing Unit http://www.sanger.ac.uk databases by
searching with conserved regions of MB2 identified by
amino acid alignments of PfMB2, PgMB2, and PyMB2
(Table 1). Missing nucleotide sequences for PbMB2 were
amplified from P. berghei genomic DNA (gift of Andy
Waters, Leiden University Medical Center) using primers,
PbMB2-1 and PbMB2-2 (Table 2), derived from the
retrieved sequences. The missing segments of PcMB2 were
isolated by gene amplification from a P. chabaudi cDNA
library (ATCC: MR4) using the specific primers, PcMB2-1
and PcMB2-2, or PcMB2-3 and PcMB2-4 (Table 2),
derived from the three separate contigs (Table 1).
When the high fidelity DNA polymerase, Pfx, was used for
gene amplification, two or three clones from one product
were sequenced. When Taq polymerase was used, three
products amplified independently were sequenced.
Amplification conditions for reactions using Taq
polymerase were 94° for 5 min, followed by 30–35 cycles
of 94° for 30–60s, 50–60° for 30–60s, and 72° for 1–2
min. Amplifications for reactions using Pfx polymerase
were 94° for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94° for 15s,
45–61°C for 30s, 60–72°C for 60s.
