Abstract
Background: In plant mitochondria, the post-transcriptional RNA editing process converts C to
U at a number of specific sites of the mRNA sequence and usually restores phylogenetically
conserved codons and the encoded amino acid residues. Sites undergoing RNA editing evolve at a
higher rate than sites not modified by the process. As a result, editing sites strongly affect the
evolution of plant mitochondrial genomes, representing an important source of sequence variability
and potentially informative characters.
To date no clear and convincing evidence has established whether or not editing sites really affect
the topology of reconstructed phylogenetic trees. For this reason, we investigated here the effect
of RNA editing on the tree building process of twenty different plant mitochondrial gene sequences
and by means of computer simulations.
Results: Based on our simulation study we suggest that the editing ‘noise’ in tree topology
inference is mainly manifested at the cDNA level. In particular, editing sites tend to confuse tree
topologies when artificial genomic and cDNA sequences are generated shorter than 500 bp and
with an editing percentage higher than 5.0%. Similar results have been also obtained with genuine
plant mitochondrial genes. In this latter instance, indeed, the topology incongruence increases
when the editing percentage goes up from about 3.0 to 14.0%. However, when the average gene
length is higher than 1,000 bp (rps3, matR and atp1) no differences in the comparison between
inferred genomic and cDNA topologies could be detected.
Conclusions: Our findings by the here reported in silico and in vivo computer simulation system
seem to strongly suggest that editing sites contribute in the generation of misleading phylogenetic
trees if the analyzed mitochondrial gene sequence is highly edited (higher than 3.0%) and reduced
in length (shorter than 500 bp).
In the current lack of direct experimental evidence the results presented here encourage, thus, the
use of genomic mitochondrial rather than cDNA sequences for reconstructing phylogenetic events
in land plants.

Background
The term RNA editing was coined for the first time almost
20 years ago to describe the specific posttranscriptional
transformation of the genetic message in the kinetoplast,
the specialized mitochondrion of trypanosomes[1]. Since
its initial discovery, RNA editing has been found to
involve many apparently unrelated biochemically processes and to occur in a variety of eukaryotes, including animals, plants, some unicellular organisms and, in viruses
as well (for a recent comprehensive review see[2] and references therein).
RNA editing specifically alters the nucleotide sequence of
an RNA transcript, making it different from that of the
DNA template. Therefore, the discovery of this process
challenged the long-accepted dogma of a colinear genetic
information flow.
On the basis of nucleotide by nucleotide sequence colinearity between the edited transcript and the DNA template,
the RNA editing systems have been categorized into two
major types [2].
In the ‘insertion/deletion’ editing type, nucleotide residues are added to and/or taken away from the gene-specified sequence. These insertions or deletions have been
found mainly in mitochondria of the parasite Trypanosoma[1] and of the slime mold Physarum [3].
In the second RNA editing type, termed ‘substitution’ editing, the sequence of the edited transcript and its gene are
colinear, but not identical. Different cases of simple base
substitution such as the deamination reaction in which a
cytosine (C) or an adenosine (A) is converted to an uridine (U) and an inosine (I) have been described in a wide
range of species [2]. If such base changes occur in the coding region of mRNAs, the amino acid specificity, unpredictable from genomic codons, can be altered resulting in
the synthesis of polypeptides more evolutionarily conserved and functionally competent.
In land plant mitochondria, mRNA editing is extensive in
terms of both the range of transcripts affected and the density of editing per transcript. For instance, in mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana the rps4 gene requires 15 C to
U transitions at the mRNA level to express a functional S4
polypeptide, while 8 editing events occur in the cox3 transcripts [4]. By contrast, in the Magnolia mitochondria 28
and 22 edits have been found in the rps4 and cox3 transcripts, respectively [5,6]. This restoration of evolutionarily conserved amino acids, as well as the creation of
translation initiation codon by conversion of ACG into
standard AUG start codons, has been interpreted as a
strong support for the functional significance of the plant
organellar RNA editing [7].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S2/S14

Mitochondrial genomes of land plants have an exceptionally low rate of substitutions compared with the counterpart of most other eukaryotes [8]. In reference to this
scenario, editing sites might strongly affect the evolution
of plant mtDNAs, representing an important source of
sequence variability and potentially informative characters.
Previous comparative analyses on different mitochondrial
genes across angiosperms revealed that, at genomic “editable sites”, C to T transitions are more frequent than any
other potential substitution [9,10]. A similar evolutionary
dynamic has also been confirmed for the cox1 gene in
gymnosperms [11]. Furthermore, these editing positions
display at the mtDNA level characteristic nucleotide patterns composed almost exclusively of pyrimidines. Consequently, the editing sites of plant mitochondrial genes
might represent a significant source of phylogenetic
incongruence.
As emphasized by Hiesel et al. [12] cDNA rather than
genomic DNA sequences of plant mitochondrial genes,
should be preferred in phylogenetic analysis especially
because the translation of the genomic DNA is not perfectly colinear with the corresponding sequence of the
functional protein. Bowe and dePamphilis [13], according to their results on the evolution of plant mitochondrial cox genes affirmed, instead, that genomic sequences
undergoing RNA editing are appropriate to be included in
phylogenetic inferences, because the editing process operates at the transcriptional level and, thus, should not affect
the historical information stored in the DNA sequences.
Although the debate about the effect of RNA editing on
phylogenetics is still ongoing as set forth earlier by Pesole
et al. [9] and most recently by Szmidt et al. [11], no extensive study has been done up to now to test how much the
RNA editing (C to U) actually affects the topology of the
reconstructed phylogenetic trees.
In order to test the performance of the mitochondrial
mRNA editing sites in phylogenetic inference, a controlled
in silico environment in which the accuracy of tree reconstruction was checked on artificially generated multiple
alignments has been set up.
Finally, the results of simulation data have been contrasted with those from twenty different multiple alignments of plant mitochondrial genes.

Methods
Simulation of plant mitochondrial genomic-like and
cDNA-like sequences
The evolution of plant mitochondrial genomic-like
sequences under increasing percentages of RNA editing
was performed by the EdiPy program appropriately

designed and written in Python programming language
and executed on a Linux cluster (see Appendix A in Additional file 1) [14].
EdiPy program [15] takes as input a rooted phylogenetic
tree with branch lengths expressed as mean number of
substitutions per site, and a text file containing both the
positions to be simulated in an editable fashion and the
corresponding nucleotide equilibrium frequencies. The
total number of editable sites per data set is calculated
using a fixed percentage in the range from 1.0 to 10.0%.
Nucleotides subjected to RNA editing at the DNA level are
supposed to follow the Tamura and Nei (TrN) model
[16]. Remaining positions, defined as background sites,
were in parallel simulated according to one of the following evolutionary models: Jukes-Cantor (JC) [17] or Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) [18]. The high evolutionary rate
for editing sites was set up according to previous results by
Shields and Wolfe [10].
When HKY substitution models was selected, a transition/
transversion rate ratio of 3 was assumed (corresponding
to the mean value estimated by maximum likelihood
from different plant mitochondrial genes analyzed in this
work). In addition, the following equilibrium nucleotide
frequencies were used: gA=gC=gG=gT=0.25 for the JC
model, and gA=0.30, gC=0.20, gG=0.20, gT=0.30 for the
HKY model.
EdiPy program was also employed to generate cDNA-like
data sets by in silico transcription of the corresponding
genomic-like sequences. During the transcription, EdiPy
assumes that the C-to-T edit would work randomly taking
into account the species-specificity and, thus, processed
paralogs due to reverse transcription and reinsertion into
the mitochondrial genome [14]. In our opinion, the
assumption that all C's labelled as editable at genomic
level would be replaced by U's in the mRNA might, in
effect, be too restrictive or conservative and valid only for
genes belonging to closely related plant species.
Automated analysis of simulated data sets
Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were estimated from several mitochondrial genes belonging to various land plants
(including data from Bowe and dePamphilis [13]) using
PHYML program [19] under the general time reversible
model (GTR) [20]. The corresponding average branch
lengths were, then, employed to generate three different
topologies of 12, 18 and 24 taxa using the stochastic speciation process described by Kuhner and Felsenstein [21].
Because this generating process makes trees molecularclock-like, every branch length of each tree was multiplied
by a gamma distributed factor, following the methodology of Guindon and Gascuel [22] (see Appendix B for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S2/S14

details about topologies and the relative branch lengths in
Additional file 1).
Each set of genomic and cDNA sequences was simulated
100 times and each replicate was submitted to PHYML
program to estimate the ML phylogenetic tree under the
HKY model of evolution [18,19]. Differences between
inferred and ‘true’ trees were quantified by the topological
distance using the Treedist program of the PHYLIP package [23]. The accuracy values of tree reconstruction were
calculated for each data set as the proportion of correctly
inferred topologies over the total number of detected
trees. The general scheme of the methodology is shown in
Figure 1.

Retrieving and analyzing real plant mitochondrial genes
Sequences of plant mitochondrial genes and their corresponding cDNAs, with editing sites experimentally determined via direct cDNA sequencing, were downloaded
from our specialized RNA editing database, REDIdb
[24,25]. Each set of genomic and cDNA sequences was
successively aligned using the ClustalW program with the
default parameters and, manually adjusted, when necessary [26]. From a total of 42 collected plant mitochondrial
protein-coding genes, any alignment that had less than 7
sequences was removed from the analyzed data sets. In
this way, 20 alignments were kept for the purpose of the
present work (more details are in the Additional file 1).

For each gene and cDNA alignment the editing percentage, the total number of variable sites and the corresponding evolutionary model, by AIC criterion [27,28], was
obtained. The PHYML program was, then, used to reconstruct ML genomic and cDNA phylogenetic trees according to the detected models of nucleotide substitution [19].
The comparison between genomic and cDNA inferred
trees was made by topological distance using the Treedist
program [23]. This distance is currently defined as twice
the number of interior branches at which sequence partition is different between the two trees compared. Yet, it is
closely related to the number of internal branches and,
thus, to the number of the analyzed sequences.
In order to compare results among all plant mitochondrial genes under study, a new simple measure was introduced. If maxDt was the maximum value of the
topological distance and Dt was the truly detected topological distance, the ratioDt was then defined as:

ratioDt =

Dt
maxDt

This ratio ranges from 0 to 1, depending on how much the
inferred genomic and cDNA phylogenetic trees are topologically different. It approaches to 0 for identical trees
and increases as the match worsens.

Results
Effect of editing at the genomic level
Given that the editing machinery acts directly on mRNAs,
the information essential to direct the editing activity
must be present at the mitochondrial genomic level [2].
For this reason, we investigated the effect of editing on
phylogenetic inference at the genomic level, simulating
around 200,000 sequences for approximately 140 million
of nucleotides.

Five different sequence data sets of 200, 300, 500, 800 and
1,000 base pairs (bp) were generated along a tree of 12

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S2/S14

taxa with percentages of editing sites ranging from 1.0 to
10.0% (see Appendix B for topology and relative branch
lengths in Additional file 1). Background sites evolved
under the JC model [17], whereas editing sites were simulated according to the TrN model of nucleotide substitution [16].
Table 1 summarize results of our in silico analyses (see
‘Genomic’ line), where the accuracy is shown as the probability of obtaining the correct tree.
As expected, the presence of editing sites decreased the
accuracy of reconstructed phylogenetic trees. In particular,
the effect of editing sites was pronounced in the 200 and
300 bp data sets, even when only 1% of positions was subjected to RNA editing, that is, when only two nucleotides
out of 200 were evolving in an editable fashion. However,
in all cases examined the accuracy of the tree reconstruction was not less than 0.7, indicating that the presence of
editing sites at the genomic level was not dramatically relevant at least for 7 out of 10 inferred trees.
When sequences were longer than 800 bp, the potential
phylogenetic incongruence due to editing was hardly
noticeable. Accuracy values close to 1 were, indeed, always

found for alignments of 800 and 1,000 bp even when a
high percentage of editing sites was simulated.
In a more realistic simulation, five additional data sets of
200, 300, 500, 800 and 1,000 bp were generated under
the HKY evolutionary model [18]. As shown in Table 2
(see ‘Genomic’ line), the effect of fast evolving editing
sites at genomic level did not significantly affect the tree
reconstruction at least for sequences longer than 500 bp.
Moreover, accuracy values were always higher than 0.80
even when genomic-like sequences were less than 500 bp
and the editing percentage higher than 5.0%.
As clearly shown in Tables 1 and 2 (see ‘Genomic’ lines),
the simulations performed under the more complex evolutionary model, HKY [18], rather than JC [17] gave the
highest tree accuracy values. Moreover, the presence of
editing sites at genomic level slightly affected the tree
inference process when the number of simulated characters per data set decreased from 1,000 to 200 bp.
In Tables 3 and 4 (see ‘Genomic’ lines) are shown the
results for the case of 1,000 bp data sets generated along
18 and 24 taxa trees under both JC and HKY evolutionary
models (see Appendix B for topologies and relative
branch lengths in Additional file 1). As previously

observed in Tables 1 and 2 for alignments 800 and 1,000
bp long, the phylogenetic reconstruction was hardly
affected even when the complexity of evolutionary models increased from JC to HKY (Tables 3, 4 and 5; Pχ21<
0.05). Furthermore, similar results were observed when
data sets longer than 1,000 bp were simulated along the
18 taxa tree and according to the simpler JC model [17]
(Table 5; see ‘Genomic’ line).
Differences between genomic and cDNA sequences
As shown in Table 1 (see ‘Genomic’ and ‘cDNA’ lines) for
the case of alignments generated along the 12 taxa tree
and under the JC model [17], accuracy values from
genomic and cDNA inferred trees were roughly the same
for sequences longer than 800 bp. On the contrary, the
effect of RNA editing on tree reconstruction became relevant when the percentage of editing sites was higher than
5.0% and alignments were shorter than 500 bp (Table 1).
Unlike results from artificial genomic data sets, the accuracy of trees deduced by cDNA sequences could also
assume values below 0.6 (Table 1).

When artificial alignments were generated according to
the HKY evolutionary models [18] slight differences
between genomic and cDNA accuracy values could be
recovered, especially for data sets longer than 500 bp
(Table 2; see ‘Genomic’ and ‘cDNA’ lines). However, significant accuracy reduction for the cDNA inferred trees
was found in data sets of 200 and 300 bp, but only for
editing percentages higher than 5.0% (Table 2).
Interestingly, as reported in Tables 3 and 4 (see ‘Genomic’
and ‘cDNA’ lines), a major effect of RNA editing on phylogenetic inference process was established when cDNA

obtained from trees deduced by genomic-like sequences.
RNA editing on real plant mitochondrial genes
Genomic and cDNA sequences of 42 different plant mitochondrial genes have been retrieved from our specialised
RNA editing database, REDIdb [24]. Since in many cases,
the number of available sequences was very small, we
excluded from our study any plant mitochondrial gene
with less than 7 sequences in the corresponding multiple
alignment. Only a total of 20 genes (Table 6) were found
to conform to this condition and were retained for the
analysis. As shown in Table 6, 5 mitochondrial genes are
longer than 1,000 bp (atp1, matR, rps3, nad5, cob), whereas
4 genes are shorter than 500 bp (rps12, rps13, nad3, atp9).
The most edited gene is the nad3 with 14% of its coding
region altered by C to T post-transcriptional conversions.
In contrast, the mitochondrial atp1 gene is the least edited,
with only 0.85% alterations.

Furthermore, for each genomic and cDNA multiple alignment the best model of nucleotide substitution has been
detected by the AIC criterion [27,28]. In 14 out of 20 cases
shown in Table 6, genomic DNA sequences followed the
same evolutionary model identified for cDNA sequences.
Genomic and cDNA inferred trees have been compared by
topological distance. In addition, since our multiple
alignments have a variable number of sequences per gene
and, thus, a different maximum value of topological distance, we chose to define the ratioDt as main measure to
compare DNA and cDNA deduced trees. This ratio is easily calculated from the observed topological distance
divided by the maximum value that it could assume. In
this way, a ratioDt of 0 is expected for completely identical
inferred genomic and cDNA topologies, whereas a ratioDt
equal to 1 is expected for trees in which the match is radically lost (Figure 2).
According to the ratioDt, the maximum number of differences between deduced genomic and cDNA trees was
observed for nad9 gene.
In general, as shown in Table 6, the ratioDt increased
when the editing percentage went up from about 3.0 to
14.0%. In particular, when the average gene length was
higher than 1,000 bp (rps3, matR and atp1) no differences
could be detected in the comparison between inferred
genomic and cDNA topologies. On the contrary, genes
shorter than 1,000 bp showed heterogeneous ratioDt values depending on the editing percentages and the total
number of variable characters.

The editing percentage is calculated for each multiple alignment as the proportion of site patterns containing at least one editing event over the
total number of site patterns.

Surprisingly, we detected ratioDt values greater than 0 for
the mitochondrial genes nad5 and cob, in which the mean
sequence length was higher than 1,000 bp and the editing
percentage was 1.9 and 3.7%, respectively.
Finally, while comparing the number of variable sites for
each gene and the corresponding cDNA, it became evident
that in general genomic sequences generate a higher phylogenetic signal than their transcripts. Nonetheless, in
none of the investigated cases the increased genomic phylogenetic signal was statistically significant (Pχ21> 0.05).

Discussion
Phylogenetic incongruence and editing simulation
RNA editing in plant mitochondria remodels mitochondrial precursor mRNAs via specific C to U conversions
[2,29]. As a consequence, the genetic information in the
transcript may differ from that one of the gene [29] leading to conflicting phylogenetic tree topologies. Although
there are several reasons to account for the phylogenetic
incongruence caused by the RNA editing process, three of
them should at least be invoked.

The first and foremost among these is that plant mitochondrial sites subjected to RNA editing might negatively
alter and affect sequence nucleotide stationarity because
they are exclusively constituted of pyrimidines [30]. This
might be especially true when editing sites within the

same gene are heterogeneously distributed across different land plants or in instances of massive RNA editing
reduction. As an explanatory example, the mitochondrial
cox3 gene in Magnolia requires 22 edits to yield a functional protein product, whereas only 13 and 10 editing
events have been observed in the same gene of wheat and
olive tree mitochondria, respectively [5,31].
Second, editing sites tend to have a more accelerated evolutionary rate than sites not subjected to RNA editing as
demonstrated by the comparison of the substitution
number per site in different land plant mitochondrial
sequences [10]. Therefore, mitochondrial genomic and
cDNA sequences exhibit different evolutionary dynamics.
[9]. Third, over great evolutionary distances, editing sites
might conceivably become saturated for multiple
changes, given the rapid turnover of pyrimidines [10].
Nonetheless, the edited plant mitochondrial sequences
are currently used in phylogenetics to provide insights
into relationships at all levels in the green plant hierarchy
of life [32-35]. The question remains, thus, as to how
much the presence of editing sites will affect phylogenetic
analysis of mitochondrial sequences and which sequences
should be used, genomic or cDNA?
According to Hiesel et al. [12] cDNA sequences should be
used in phylogenetics of land plants, because they are

sequenced from mRNA and predict the true protein
sequence. Unfortunately, Hiesel et al. [12] did not show
trees deduced from genomic DNA sequences, omitting a
discussion about the effect of editing on phylogenetic
analysis.
By contrast, Bowe and dePamphilis [13] as well as Szmidt
et al. [11], argued that genomic DNA sequences are at least
as useful as cDNA sequences for reconstructing phylogenetic events. The editing effect was qualitatively evaluated
comparing deduced mitochondrial genomic and cDNA
trees [11,13].
A major question to be considered is the potentially misleading choice of which data set, genomic or cDNA, has to
be used in phylogenetic analysis if plant mitochondrial
genomic and cDNA trees are not similar. It became difficult, indeed, to judge which tree, genomic or cDNA, is

closer to the correct one when it is not possible to establish with confidence the true phylogenetic relationships
between homologous sequences.
Currently numerical simulations are employed for studying the accuracy of different molecular biological processes under idealized conditions, which are especially
useful to exhaustively explore the effect of multiple
parameters affecting the performance of methods of phylogenetic inference [36]. In particular, the simulation of
plant mitochondrial genes subjected to RNA editing
allows us to establish either the editing effect on tree
reconstruction is more extensive at the genomic than the
cDNA level or the number of topological differences
between deduced genomic and cDNA trees.
The basic assumption of our simulation is that sites subjected to RNA editing evolve differently than the remain-

ing sites, defined as background, evolving specifically
according to the TrN nucleotide substitution model [16]
(see the Methods section).
Following our experimental design, the ‘noise’ introduced
by a growing percentage of editing sites should be evident
in terms of reduction of topological accuracy. The variability range for the percentage values of editing sites was
fixed from 1.0 to 10.0% because these values are roughly
the same detected for real plant mitochondrial genes (see
Table 6). Moreover, percentage values higher than 10.0%
might not mimic real plant mitochondrial editing patterns and, thus, substantially alter the nucleotide composition per sequence.
Our results show that when background sites are generated under the simpler JC evolutionary model [17], the
editing bias at genomic level is more evident for short and
highly edited sequence data sets (Table 1). Nonetheless, a
slight reduction of tree accuracy is also manifest when
background sites are simulated according to a more complex substitution model as the HKY [18] (Table 2). This
finding is not surprising given that the tree reconstruction
is performed under the ML criterion using the more complicated HKY model that takes into account variable
nucleotide frequencies and different rates for transitions
and transversions. In all cases, including also simulations
along the 18 and 24 taxa trees, the accuracy of tree reconstruction at genomic level is comparable with that one
obtained in previous simulation studies performed to
evaluate the ability of different methods in phylogenetic
tree inference [37,38] (Tables 3, 4 and 5). However, in
function of the number of simulated editing sites, a minimal decrease of efficiency in tree reconstruction is often
found, indicating that the editing ‘noise’ is generally
present and associated with high editing percentages, even
though it is not so relevant at genomic level. It is likely
that editing ‘noise’ is partially due to the reduction of the
character-state space at level of editing sites. It has been
clearly demonstrated that a relatively little increase in
character-state space can provide enormous benefits for
the accuracy of phylogenetic inference [39].
On the other hand, simulation results for data sets lacking
editing sites clearly indicate that the elimination of edits
lead to tree topologies close to those inferred by genomiclike data sets (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).
However, it should be noted that our simulations greatly
rely on the model tree topology used to generate the
sequence data. Since only few randomly generated topologies have been used, our observations may be limited to
topologies of the same type. Furthermore, the complexity
of the actual nucleotide substitution pattern poses the
problem of the model choice. Even sophisticated models

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S2/S14

tend to oversimplify the real evolutionary patterns. Therefore, given the limiting nature of the numerical simulations, our results represent only the simplest expectation
of the RNA editing effect on tree reconstruction.
Comparison between artificial and real data sets
In contrast with previously published studies by Bowe
and dePamphilis [13], Pesole et al. [9] and Szmidt et al.
[11], in which only a limited number of characters and
taxa was investigated to verify the effect of editing on phylogenetic reconstruction, here 20 different plant mitochondrial genes have been analyzed.

As shown in Table 6, when the model describing the process of nucleotide substitutions for genomic and cDNA
sequences is valuated separately, in 14 out of 20 genes,
genomic and cDNA sequences followed the same evolutionary model, suggesting that most likely the number of
editing events per gene is not adequate to improve significantly the likelihood scores and, thus, to affect the choice
of the best-fit evolutionary model [28].
Differently to the previous works of Bowe and dePamphilis [13] and Szmidt et al. [11], the phylogenetic bias due
to RNA editing sites has been quantitatively valuated comparing ML genomic and cDNA inferred trees by means of
the ratioDt. In a large number of plant mitochondrial
genes analysed here the ratioDt assumes higher values
when the percentage of editing sites increases (Table 6). If
we consider that genomic and cDNA sequences diverge
only by editing sites, conflicting tree topologies are most
likely due exclusively to the presence of RNA editing sites
(Figure 2). On the other hand, bearing in our mind that
the aim of our work was to quantify the conflict between
genomic and cDNA inferred topologies, any discussion
about the systematic correctness of each deduced tree has
been here deliberately omitted. Moreover, it should be
mentioned that our inferred trees, technically called genetrees, represents only the evolutionary relationships
among genomic or cDNA sequences of each specific gene
that, thus, might not be completely comparable with specie-trees (Figure 2).
As predicted by our in silico analyses (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and
5), when mitochondrial gene sequences are shorter than
or around 500 bp the ratioDt values range from 0.18 to
0.54, indicating from moderate to serious corruption of
tree reconstruction. In contrast, when analyzed gene
sequences are longer than 800 bp (atp1, matR, rps3 and
atp6) the ratioDt is close to 0, indicating a perfect accord
between genomic and cDNA inferred trees. Only in few
examples where the number of sequences per gene is
more than 14, as cox2, nad3 and atp9, the ratioDt assumes
the highest values ranging from 0.5 to 0.54 (Figure 2).

Although computer simulation model let us predict a
potential effect of editing on the topology of many plant
mitochondrial genes, misleading predictions might still
be experienced. Indeed, artificial sequences are generated
under simplified conditions and even when more complex models of evolution are invoked it is difficult to perfectly describe the real biological world. Other factors
such as site rate variation and interdependence among
sites should be taken into account [40,41]. For example,
5′- sequences adjacent to the editing sites might be
required for RNA editing [42].
Misleading results could also emerge during the process of
tree reconstruction, because the efficiency of ML methods
of tree building depends also on the number of characters
and taxa analyzed and on the number of variable sites
[38]. In effect, when total site variability was not sufficient
to reconstruct phylogenies, as for nad5, cob and nad9
genes, the behaviour of editing sites might not be easily
predictable by simulation.
Above all Bowe and dePamphilis emphasized [13] that
processed paralogs, i.e. sequences due to reverse transcription and reinsertion into either the mitochondrial or
nuclear genome as edited cDNA, critically affect the tree
building process.
If processed paralogs become inserted into the mitochondrial genome, they certainly generate variability in the
total number of editing sites per gene, a phenomenon also
well known as species-specificity of RNA editing. In the
latter event, the phylogenetic editing ‘noise’ can be
straightforwardly evaluated by either the in silico or the in
vitro approach according to the methodology described in
the Methods section of this paper.
If processed paralogs become instead inserted into the
nuclear genome they evolve in accordance with nuclear
sequences, that is much faster than plant chloroplast and
mitochondrial sequences [43]. Either way paralogs may
really cause a critical phylogenetic incongruence [13].

Conclusions
Studying the correlated rates of synonymous site evolution across plant genomes, Eyre-Walker and Gaut [44]
wrote “RNA editing is a potential complication in the
analysis of plant mitochondrial and chloroplast genes….
caution must be taken to ensure that … all edited sites are
excluded from an analysis.”
In light of this statement and agreement with our results
from simulated and genuine mitochondrial data sets, we
conclude that:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S2/S14

• The editing ‘noise’ in the tree inference is mainly manifested at the cDNA level.
• Editing sites can contribute in generating misleading
phylogenetic trees if the analyzed mitochondrial gene
sequence is highly edited (higher than 3.0%) and reduced
in length (shorter than 500 bp).
Although the removal of editing sites can contribute to
reduce confusing the tree inferences when the plant mitochondrial genomic and cDNA sequences are combined
[13], to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence up
to now that mitochondrial DNA sequences are misleading
in phylogenetic analyses. Therefore, our findings favour
the conclusion that mitochondrial genomic rather than
cDNA sequences should be used for reconstructing phylogenetic events in land plants.
