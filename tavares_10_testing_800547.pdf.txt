Testing the recent theories for the origin of the
hermaphrodite flower by comparison of the
transcriptomes of gymnosperms and
angiosperms

Abstract
Background: Different theories for the origin of the angiosperm hermaphrodite flower make different predictions
concerning the overlap between the genes expressed in the male and female cones of gymnosperms and the
genes expressed in the hermaphrodite flower of angiosperms. The Mostly Male (MM) theory predicts that, of genes
expressed primarily in male versus female gymnosperm cones, an excess of male orthologs will be expressed in
flowers, excluding ovules, while Out Of Male (OOM) and Out Of Female (OOF) theories predict no such excess.
Results: In this paper, we tested these predictions by comparing the transcriptomes of three gymnosperms
(Ginkgo biloba, Welwitschia mirabilis and Zamia fisheri) and two angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa),
using EST data. We found that the proportion of orthologous genes expressed in the reproductive organs of the
gymnosperms and in the angiosperms flower is significantly higher than the proportion of orthologous genes
expressed in the reproductive organs of the gymnosperms and in the angiosperms vegetative tissues, which
shows that the approach is correct. However, we detected no significant differences between the proportion of
gymnosperm orthologous genes expressed in the male cone and in the angiosperms flower and the proportion of
gymnosperm orthologous genes expressed in the female cone and in the angiosperms flower.
Conclusions: These results do not support the MM theory prediction of an excess of male gymnosperm genes
expressed in the hermaphrodite flower of the angiosperms and seem to support the OOM/OOF theories. However,
other explanations can be given for the 1:1 ratio that we found. More abundant and more specific (namely carpel
and ovule) expression data should be produced in order to further test these theories.

Background
In spite of the great and ever growing amount of morphological and molecular data accumulating from paleobotany, phylogenetics and evo-devo analysis, the origin of
the angiosperms hermaphrodite flower is still the “abominable mistery” Charles Darwin referred to, in a letter
written to the British botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker,
150 years ago [1-3].
Many theories have been proposed to explain angiosperm origins, differing on the features proposed for the

ancestor of the flower and on the evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to the “modern” hermaphrodite structure. The most recent ones have the advantage that they
can be tested using molecular data from extant plants,
namely gymnosperms and angiosperms [4]. One of
these recent hypotheses, the “Mostly Male Theory”, suggests that the angiosperms flower derives from the male
reproductive structures of the ancestor, on which ectopic ovules (normally located on the female axis) have
developed. The male unit would thus become bisexual
and later some microsporophylls (modified leaves bearing the male structures producing microspores) would
have enclosed the ovules, giving rise to the angiosperms
carpel [5]. Alternatively, the Out Of Male and the Out
of Female theories propose that homeotic changes in

gene expression would have given rise to a perianth-less
flower-like structure (a flower where the reproductive
structures are not protected, for instance by petals or
sepals) with male reproductive units in the basal region
and female reproductive units in the apical region [6,4].
These theories make different predictions concerning
the overlap between the genes expressed in the male
and female cones of gymnosperms and the genes
expressed in the hermaphrodite flower of angiosperms.
Since it states that the ancestral flower derived from a
mainly male axis (on which only the ovules would be
female) the Mostly Male (MM) Theory predicts an
excess of orthologs of gymnosperm male genes
expressed in the angiosperms flower. In other words, of
the genes expressed in the hermaphrodite flower, “more
should have close homologs (or orthologs, if gene trees
are sufficiently resolved to demonstrate orthology) active
in male gymnosperm reproductive structures rather
than in female structures » [5]. On the other hand, proposing a “mixed” structure, half male half female, as the
flower ancestor, the Out Of Male (OOM) and the Out
Of Female (OOF) theories predict no excess of gymnosperm male (or female) cone genes expressed in the
angiosperm flower [7].
The Floral Genome Project [8] has generated abundant sequence collections of several gymnosperm and
angiosperm species. Large EST datasets, capturing thousands of sequences of genes expressed during flower
development in each species, have been accumulated.
Using both data from the FGP and from the Arabidopsis [9] and rice genome projects [10,11], we tested these
predictions by comparing the transcriptomes of three
gymnosperms (Ginkgo biloba, Welwitschia mirabilis and
Zamia fisheri) and two angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa). We chose Arabidopsis and rice
for the abundance of EST data and because their complete genome is sequenced, which ensures that the
“right” angiosperm ortholog is found for each gymnosperm gene. We used all gymnosperm species for which
we had enough EST data from male and female cones’
libraries. This is unfortunately not the case for Pinus
taeda, from which not such libraries exist, despite the
total of more than 300 000 EST sequences available from
this species.

Expression data

We used total of 1 526 133 EST from Arabidopsis thaliana, 1 220 876 EST from Oryza sativa, 10 129 EST
from Welwitschia mirabilis, 8 252 EST from Zamia
fischeri and 6 250 EST from Ginkgo biloba (dbEST
release 080108 GenBank, NCBI). EST libraries obtained
from mRNA extractions of the same organs, types of
libraries, developmental stages and physiological conditions (called here expression categories) were grouped,
according to the annotations provided by the NCBI
(library.report). We generated complete expression data
for the 66 710 rice cDNA and for the 38 963 Arabidopsis cDNA, using all the ESTs from a total of 317 rice
libraries (grouped in 51 expression categories) and 181
Arabidopsis libraries (39 expression categories). In order
to perform our tests, we then selected the expression
data from flowers and inflorescences (angiosperms),
male and female (early developmental stages) cones
(gymnosperms) and vegetative tissues (leaves and pools
of vegetative organs). Table 1 summarizes the information of the EST numbers and libraries used in these
comparisons.
Expression data within each species was obtained by
linking the EST to the cDNA (or unigenes) of the species. This was made by blastn between the cDNA (unigenes) sequences (query) and the EST sequences (bank).
A threshold alignment score of E-10 was used to filter
the results, and only the alignments of at least 100 bp
and with a minimum of 95% of identity between the
sequences were retained. Multiple hits of the same EST
to one cDNA sequence were discarded (only the best
was retained) and whenever the same EST aligned with
different cDNA, we kept only the hits having a score of
at least 90% of the score of the best hit. One “good” hit
(respecting the criteria described above) with an EST
was sufficient for a gene to be considered expressed in
the organ corresponding to the EST library. No quantitative analysis of the expression level was performed,
only the presence/absence of each gene in the different
EST libraries was considered.
Orthology

The orthology between the angiosperm and gymnosperm genes was established by the best reciprocal hit
method. This means that a blast is performed between
the two species genes using each species both as the
query and as the subject for the alignments. The best

hit for each query sequence is retained, the results of
the two (reciprocal) blast are compared, and only the
pairs of sequences corresponding to a best hit in both
blast are retained as pairs of orthologs.
Blast was performed between the peptide sequences
mentioned above for Arabidopsis and rice and either
peptide (Ginkgo biloba) or nucleotide (all three gymnosperms) sequences of the gymnosperms. The peptide
sequences of G.biloba were obtained applying a polypeptide prediction pipeline, prot4EST [13] to the unigene
sequences. For this species, orthology with Arabidopsis
and rice was established by reciprocal best hit using
both blastp between the peptide sequences of the two
species or blastx and tblastn between the peptide
sequences of Arabidopsis and rice and the nucleotide
sequences of G.biloba. As the results were very similar,
orthologs between the other two gymnosperms and Arabidopsis and rice were determined by reciprocal best hit
using blastx and tblastn between the peptide sequences
of Arabidopsis and rice and the nucleotide sequences of
the gymnosperms (i.e. no peptide sequence predictions
were used for the gymnosperms). All blast results were
filtered with an E-10 threshold for the alignment score.
Biological tests

The test of the gene expression predictions of the theories for the origin of the hermaphrodite flower was
done by comparing the number of genes expressed both
in the male cone of the gymnosperms and in the angiosperm flower with the number of genes expressed both
in the female cone of the gymnosperms and in the
angiosperm flower. It is thus a male/female comparison.
We did not compare the absolute number of genes, this

value has instead been “normalized” by the number of
genes expressed in each cone (and thus eliminating the
influence of the size of the EST library) or, more precisely, by the number of genes expressed in each cone
for which we were able to find an ortholog in the
angiosperm species.
A consequence of the relative small size of the gymnosperm EST libraries is that we most certainly do not
detect all the genes actually expressed in each tissue.
This means that we may not use this type of data to
detect tissue specific genes (any false negative in a tissue
expression set would produce a false positive in another
tissue specific expression set). We thus made the analysis using the total set of genes expressed in each male
or female cone of the gymnosperms, independently of
its expression in the other, female or male, cone.
In order to evaluate the suitability of the expression
EST data for this kind of test, we made other comparisons, which worked as a control of the main analysis.
One strong hypothesis that legitimates Frohlich’s and
Parker’s predictions [5] is that differences in the tissue
identity (which, in this case, is used as an indicator of
the tissue origin) can be evaluated at a transcriptomics
level by comparing proportions of expressed genes. If
this is true, we should expect, for instance, the proportion of genes expressed in common in the reproductive
organs of a gymnosperm and the flower of an angiosperm to be greater than the proportion of genes
expressed in common in the reproductive organs of a
gymnosperm and the vegetative organs of an angiosperm. We tested this by comparing the proportion of
genes having an angiosperm ortholog and being
expressed in each gymnosperm male and female cones

and in a reproductive organ of the angiosperms with the
proportion of genes having an angiosperm ortholog and
being expressed in each gymnosperm male and female
cones and in a vegetative organ of the angiosperms.
Two kinds of pools of reproductive organs (flower and
flower and inflorescences) and of vegetative organs
(leaves and pools of vegetative organs) were used in the
analysis. We did this for the three gymnosperms and
the two angiosperms, making a total of 36 “control”
comparisons.
Statistical analysis

The statistical evaluation of the expression ratios was
made by 1) estimating the confidence interval (CI) of
the proportion of the gymnosperm genes (with an
angiosperm ortholog) expressed in a gymnosperm
organ, from which the angiosperm orthologs are
expressed in an angiosperm organ. The choice of using
a CI estimation of a frequency instead of the frequency
itself was made because the total n (number of orthologs found between the two species that are expressed
in a gymnosperm organ) is not the same for the different proportions calculated; 2) calculating the ratio
between two of these CI (for instance, between the CI
of the expression in a gymnosperm male cone and an
angiosperm flower versus the CI of the expression in a
gymnosperm female cone and an angiosperm flower, for
the main test of the analysis). This was done by dividing
the lower limit of one CI (ex CI A) by the upper limit
of the other (CI B) and, inversely, by dividing the upper
limit of the CI A by the lower limit of CI B. We thus
obtained a CI for the ratio (CI A/B = ]minA/maxB;
maxA/minB[) and then calculated the mean value of
this CI; 3) testing the null hypothesis of this ratio being
equal to 1 (the p-values were calculated). These analyses
were performed with R [14].

Results
Table 2 shows the number of unigenes of each gymnosperm that are expressed in each gymnosperm EST

library, and the fraction of those for which an angiosperm ortholog could be found. The number of genes
expressed in a gymnosperm organ (male or female) for
which the angiosperm ortholog is detected in the
angiosperms flower EST libraries is also shown.
Problem with the Zamia fisheri male bank

The number of angiosperm orthologs found among the
Zamia fisheri male expressed unigenes was abnormally
low, especially for Arabidopsis (10%, i.e. approximately 4
times less than the proportion found for the female
expressed genes). Most of the unigenes for which no
angiosperm ortholog was found either had no similarity
with any GenBank sequence or corresponded to transposable elements sequences. The number of genes with
an ortholog detected in the angiosperms flower libraries
was, as a consequence, also very low, which probably
explains the “atypical” results found for the Z. fisheri
male expressed genes comparisons.
The results of the male/female comparisons and of the
main control tests are shown in table 3.
Control test

All the reproductive/vegetative comparisons showed a
significant excess of genes expressed in common in the
male or female cones of a gymnosperm and in the
flower of an angiosperm, compared to the genes
expressed in common in the male or female cones of a
gymnosperm and in the vegetative organs (leaves or
pools of vegetative organs) of the angiosperms. The
ratios varied from 1.2 (Z. fisheri male expressed genes,
but see previous section) to 4.9 (G. biloba male
expressed genes) times more genes in common between
the reproductive organs of the two species than between
the reproductive organs of one species and the vegetative organs of the other. This excess was found for the
comparisons of the three gymnosperms with the two
angiosperms and using both the angiosperm flower EST
libraries alone (data not shown) or a pool of angiosperm
flower and inflorescence EST libraries (shown on the

libraries or the angiosperm vegetative organs pool EST
libraries. All the p-values are highly significant (from E10 to E-130), except the ones of the Zamia fisheri male
comparisons (but see previous section).
Test of the theories of the origin of the flower

None of the gymnosperm male/female comparisons
showed the excess of gymnosperm male cone genes
expressed in the angiosperm flower predicted by the
Mostly Male Theory for the origin of the flower. Except
for the Zamia fisheri comparisons, where a significant
excess of female cone expressed genes was detected
among the genes expressed in the Arabidopsis or rice
flower (but see first section of the Results), all the male/
female ratios were not significantly different from 1
(ratios from 0.97 to 1.09; p-values > 0.15). The results
were very similar, for each gymnosperm, when using
Arabidopsis or rice as the angiosperm species.

Discussion
Our results indicate equivalent proportions of gymnosperm male and female organs genes expressed in the
angiosperm hermaphrodite flower. This 1:1 ratio is not
in agreement with the Mostly Male Theory prediction
of an excess of male gymnosperm genes expressed in
the flower of the angiosperms. We can think of different
explanations for this non-detection of differences
between male and female genes.

A first explanation would be that the OOM/OOF
theories are correct. This would be in agreement with
the expression studies by Vásquez-Lobo and collaborators [15] on gymnosperm LEAFY-like genes that aimed
to further test an important observation for the MM
theory: of the two LEAFY-like genes in gymnosperms,
only one paralog was kept in angiosperms, and this
paralog seemed to have a male-specific expression pattern [1]. These analysis do not find male vs. female-specific expression for the two LEAFY-paralogs in several
gymnosperm species, and thus do not support distinctive functions of the two LEAFY-like genes in specifying
male and female reproductive organs, which is compatible with the OOM/OOF theories but not with the MM
one. However, it should be emphasized that while the
MM theory predicts a significant difference between the
proportions of the two types of expressed genes (which
we were able to test and not able to find) the corresponding predictions of the OOM and OOF theories,
i.e. a “significant equivalence” of the proportions of
expressed genes, may not be strictly tested. In other
words, our work does not falsify the OOM/OOF theories, but it is not able to verify them.
The absence of differences may also mean that expression divergence between gymnosperms and angiosperms
is too great to allow these kind of comparisons. Whole
genome duplications in the angiosperm lineage, in particular, could contribute to this expression divergence
because of neo or subfunctionalisation of gene duplicates orthologous to male or female gymnosperm single
genes. Nonetheless, our control experiment revealed
that the proportion of orthologous genes expressed in
the reproductive organs (both male and female) of the
gymnosperms and in the angiosperms flower is significantly higher than the proportion of orthologous genes
expressed in the reproductive organs of the gymnosperms and in the angiosperms vegetative tissues. This
was found for all the species and libraries tested, and is
not what we expect only by chance. The results of the
control experiment thus seem to indicate that lack
of signal in the data is not the right explanation for the
1:1 ratio.
One last possible explanation would be that female
and male ancestral characteristics of the angiosperm
flower may not be measured by the number of genes
expressed in common with female and male tissues of
the ancestor, but that differences between sexes are due
to only a few genes or are quantitative, i.e. due to the
level of expression of the (eventually the same) genes.
The fact that this might be a real obstacle to the analysis
is suggested by the relatively widespread capacity of stamen tissues to undergo feminization. The ectopic production of ovules, stigmatic tissues or valve-type tissues
by stamens, or even their complete transformation into

Tavares et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:240
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/240

carpels (called pistillody) as is the case in some papaya
genotypes [16], indicate that somatic tissues of the stamen can switch developmental programs locally and
relatively late in development [17-19]. The genetic control of the process is not well understood, but work in
wheat has showed that pistillody is caused in this species by alterations to the class-B MADS-box gene
expression pattern in given lines following cytoplasmic
substitution through recurrent backcrossing [20]. The
fact that in the early diversification of the angiosperms
stamen evolution has been viewed as more labile or
changing more rapidly [21], further indicates that malefemale structures may share a large set of common gene
networks. An alternative explanation for the male/
female shared expression patterns would concern genes
expressed in the ovules. The prediction of the MM theory specifically excludes ovule-expressed gymnosperm
(female) genes. It could be that enough ovule expressed
genes have been retained (or redeployed) in the angiosperm flower to mask any differences among genes not
derived from ovules.
Distinction between these alternative explanations
would need quantitative expression data. The available
EST data, comprising normalized libraries and libraries
of relatively small size, do not allow us to make quantitative comparisons. Microarrays could provide such
information - unfortunately such data are not available
for gymnosperm reproductive structures.
Another interesting analysis would be to concentrate
on the typical angiosperm flower feature, the organ for
which the different theories propose a different origin the carpel. For the MM theory, the carpel tissue has a
male origin (except for the ovules), while the OOM and
OOF theories propose an ancestral female identity for
all the female tissues in the hermaphrodite angiosperm
flower. We have used affymetrix microarray data from
Arabidopsis http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/, including
expression data from the carpel, and performed the
same kind of comparisons between male and female
(the main test) and reproductive and vegetative (the
control experiment) gymnosperm genes (EST were used
for the expression data of gymnosperms) expressed in
the angiosperm flower. No coherent ratios of reproductive expression over vegetative expression were obtained
in the control experiment, i.e. no excess of gymnosperm
reproductive tissues genes over vegetative tissues genes
was found to be expressed in the angiosperm flower.
This means that we cannot trust the male/female
expression ratios observed. Mixing EST and microarray
expression data, with different thresholds of detection, is
probably preventing the detection of any eventual significant signal.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have tested the MM theory prediction
of gene expression comparison between gymnosperms
and angiosperms reproductive structures using all the
adequate data available up to now. Our results do not
support the MM theory prediction, but further analysis,
using quantitative and more detailed expression data
(namely ovule and carpel angiosperm expressed genes
and eventually male and female specific gymnosperm
expressed genes) are needed to determine if the MM
theory is, or is not, the correct explanation for the origin
of the hermaphrodite flower.
