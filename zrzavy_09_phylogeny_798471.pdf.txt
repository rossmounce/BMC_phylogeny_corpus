Abstract
Background: Annelida is one of the major protostome phyla, whose deep phylogeny is very poorly
understood. Recent molecular phylogenies show that Annelida may include groups once considered
separate phyla (Pogonophora, Echiurida, and Sipunculida) and that Clitellata are derived polychaetes. SThe
"total-evidence" analyses combining morphological and molecular characters have been published for a few
annelid taxa. No attempt has yet been made to analyse simultaneously morphological and molecular
information concerning the Annelida as a whole.
Results: Phylogenetic relationships within Annelida were analysed on the basis of 93 morphological
characters and sequences of six genes (18S, 28S, and 16S rRNA, EF1α, H3, COI), altogether, 87 terminals
of all annelid "families" and 3,903 informative characters, by Bayesian and maximum-parsimony methods.
The analysis of the combined dataset yields the following scheme of relationships: Phyllodocida and
Eunicida are monophyletic groups, together probably forming monophyletic Aciculata (incl. Orbiniidae and
Parergodrilidae that form a sister group of the Eunicida). The traditional "Scolecida" and "Canalipalpata"
are both polyphyletic, forming instead two clades: one including Cirratuliformia and the "sabelloid-spionoid
clade" (incl. Sternaspis, Sabellidae-Serpulidae, Sabellariidae, Spionida s.str.), the other ("terebelloidcapitelloid clade") including Terebelliformia, Arenicolidae-Maldanidae, and Capitellidae-Echiurida. The
Clitellata and "clitellate-like polychaetes" (Aeolosomatidae, Potamodrilidae, Hrabeiella) form a
monophyletic group. The position of the remaining annelid groups is uncertain – the most problematic
taxa are the Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae clade, the Amphinomida-Aberranta clade, Apistobranchus,
Chaetopteridae, Myzostomida, the Sipunculida-Dinophilidae clade, and the "core Archiannelida" (=
Protodrilidae, Nerillidae, Polygordiidae, Saccocirridae).
Conclusion: The combined ("total-evidence") phylogenetic analysis provides a modified view of annelid
evolution, with several higher-level taxa, i.e. Phyllodocida, Eunicida, orbinioid-parergodrilid clade (OPC),
Cirratuliformia, sabelloid-spionoid clade (SSC), terebelloid-capitelloid clade (TCC), and
"Clitellatomorpha". Two unorthodox clades, the "core Archiannelida" and Sipunculida-Dinophilidae, are
proposed. Although the deep-level evolutionary relationships of Annelida remain poorly understood, we
propose the monophyly of the Aciculata, sister-group relationships between the Eunicida and OPC,
between the Cirratuliformia and SSC, and possibly also between the "Clitellatomorpha" and OweniidaePogonophora clades.

Background
Annelida, the segmented worms (over 16,500 species
described), are distributed worldwide from the deepest
marine sediments to freshwater and soil habitats.
Throughout most of the 20th century they were split into
three or four major groups, Polychaeta, Myzostomida,
Oligochaeta and Hirudinea. It is now widely recognized
that Oligochaeta and Hirudinea form a clade that is
referred to as Clitellata (where leeches are only a derived
subgroup of oligochaetes [1-3]). Several interstitial groups
were classified as the "Archiannelida", another annelid
group; however, they are now generally regarded as secondarily simplified, possibly progenetic polychaetes
[4,5]. Several more groups have been hypothesized to
belong into the Annelida [6], and there is a growing consensus that the Echiurida, Pogonophora (incl. Vestimentifera), and Sipunculida are actually modified annelids [79].
A cladistic analysis of Annelida, based on morphological
characters, has resulted in a new classification [10,11],
with three major clades of the Polychaeta: Scolecida, Aciculata (= Amphinomida + Eunicida + Phyllodocida), and
Canalipalpata (= Terebellida + Spionida + Sabellida [incl.
Pogonophora]). However, several annelid groups were
left outside this classification. They include Clitellata, the
freshwater and/or terrestrial "clitellate-like" worms (Parergodrilidae, Hrabeiella, and Aphanoneura [= Aeolosomatidae + Potamodrilus]), some "archiannelids" (Protodrilida
and Polygordiidae, both only tentatively regarded as aberrant canalipalpatans), and Psammodrilidae.
From a molecular perspective, the sequence datasets
assembled to date have usually been marked by limited
numbers of both taxa and characters. Almost all annelid
families are now represented by the nuclear small-subunit
ribosomal RNA genes ("18S" hereinafter); unfortunately,
even 18S studies using the densest taxon sampling [12-14]
were unable to recover a monophyletic Annelida or its
major subclades. Even if several genes are concatenated to
reconstruct annelid phylogeny in recent papers, none of
the morphology-based higher taxa (Polychaeta, Scolecida,
Aciculata, Canalipalpata) were recovered [15-17]. Recent
papers by Struck et al. [7,8] provided the first molecular
trees with several resolved higher taxa of the Annelida.
They included Aciculata (excl. Amphinomida), Phyllodocida (incl. Orbiniidae), Terebelliformia, Sabellida-Spionida, Cirratuliformia, and Amphinomida.
Synthesis of molecular and morphological data from
extant and potentially also extinct taxa remains the strongest test of phylogenetic hypotheses and the best summary
of the common signal in the diverse data available for
phylogenetics [18]. The "total-evidence" analyses have
been published for a few annelid taxa, viz., Clitellata [2],
Terebelliformia [19], most Canalipalpata [20], Aphroditi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/189

formia [21], and most Aciculata [22]. So far, no attempt
has been made to analyse simultaneously morphological
and molecular information on the Annelida as a whole.
In this paper we present the first comprehensive analysis
of higher-level phylogenetic relationships in Annelida
based on combined morphological and molecular (four
nuclear, two mitochondrial genes) data. The purpose is to
identify stable and ustable nodes of the combined annelid
tree, to make up reliable phylogenetic hypothesis on
Annelida, and thus test the morphology-based classification.

Results
The congruence of data partitions
The combined data matrix included 87 terminals and
3,903 cladistically informative characters (93 morphology
[= MOR]; 630 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I [= COI];
604 elongation factor-1α [= EF1α]; 132 histone H3; 763
18S ribosomal RNA; 274 16S ribosomal RNA; 1,407 28S
ribosomal RNA). Out of 339,561 data matrix cells (= character states), 6% were polymorphic and 30% were missing
(unknown or inapplicable). Distribution of the ambiguous character states is highly uneven, as four terminals
(Histriobdellidae, Sphaerodoridae, Aberranta, Parapodrilus) are represented by two data partitions only (MOR
+ 18S).

Evaluation of the relative quality of data partitions and
their performance in the combined maximum-parsimony
analysis indicated that the MOR dataset was highly influential in the simultaneous analyses of all data partitions
(Figure 1). The partitioned Bremer support (PBS) values
in the combined dataset, limited to the 28 composite terminals that were represented by all seven data partitions
(one tree, length 18,195, CI 0.35, RI 0.24; Figure 1),
revealed that despite the significant incongruence of the
morphological and molecular data partitions, the former
contributed positively to Bremer support values of (= supported) 15 clades (60%) and is negative for (= contradicted) two clades (8%) only: one within Terebelliformia,
the other concerning position of the Orbiniidae within
Aciculata. The molecular partitions analysed together are
in conflict with two clades as well, both concerning the
placement of the Amphinomidae as a sister group of the
Eunicida. The molecular partitions are, however, by no
means homogeneous. The PBS analysis showed that four
data partitions contributed positively to the combinedtree topology (MOR: ΣPBS = 100; 28S: 322; EF1a: 232;
16S: 100), while the other three molecular partitions
(COI, H3, 18S) are in conflict with the combined tree.
Bayesian (BI) tree
In the combined BI tree, the basal relationships were not
fully resolved. However, there were several well-supported
(pp > 0.90) clades (Figure 2): (i) the "sabelloid-spionoid

Maximum-parsimony (MP) trees
In the unweighted (uMP) analysis (one tree, length
42,492, CI 0.20, RI 0.25), monophyletic Aciculata were
nested within paraphyletic "Canalipalpata" (Figure 3). A
few taxa seemed to be misplaced due to long-branch artifacts (e.g. Serpulidae far from the Sabellidae, Pectinariidae
outside the Terebelliformia, and Tomopteridae outside
the Phyllodocida); moreover, there was an obviously artifactual "basal" clade including "archiannelids", myzostomids, and several long-branch aciculatans and
canalipalpatans.

probabilities and very short basal branches). The "Aciculata" included Phyllodocida, Eunicida, and OPC. The

The weighted (wMP, "slow-fast") tree (one tree, weighted
length 129,822, CI 0.25, RI 0.27; Figure 4) was nearly
identical with the BI tree (both included two major sister
superclades, one mostly aciculatan, the other mostly
canalipalpatan). They differed predominantly only in
position of the Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae clade, "core
archiannelids", Dinophilidae-Sipunculida clade, Apistobranchus, and Tomopteridae.
Taxon-exclusion tests
The preliminary results suggested that ingroup and outgroup taxon selection affected internal relationships. To
highlight topological problems in placement of the most
"problematic" taxa (Myzostomida, Opheliidae, Scalibregmatidae, Fauveliopsidae, Serpulidae, Magelona, Oweniidae, Chaetopteridae, Pectinariidae, Apistobranchus,
Polygordiidae, Saccocirridae, Protodrilidae, Protodriloides,
Nerillidae, Histriobdellidae, Dinophilidae, Sipunculida,
Hesionidae, Paralacydoniidae, Nepthyidae, Pilargidae,
Tomopteridae, Aberranta, Amphinomida; see Methods for
selection criteria), several experimental analyses were performed.

In the taxon-exclusion tests, after removing the "problematic" species/clades, the unrooted "backbone trees" were
almost identical irrespective of the used methods (uMP
and BI). Both included either monophyletic or paraphyletic (which naturally cannot be distinguished in an
unrooted tree) "Aciculata" and "Canalipalpata", and differed only in the specific position of the Pogonophora"Clitellatomorpha" clade within the "Canalipalpata" (Figure 5, 6). The important "problematica" grouped consistently as follows: Oweniidae as a sister group of the
Pogonophora; Fauveliopsidae, Magelona, and OpheliidaeScalibregmatidae within the Cirratuliformia-SSC clade;

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:189

Apistobranchus as a sister group of OPC; and AberrantaAmphinomida next to (or within) the Phyllodocida. The
other "problematic species" were placed at more or less
conflicting positions in BI and uMP tests (see below). The
ougroups tended to be placed within the "Canalipalpata",
close to the Pogonophora and/or "Clitellatomorpha".

Discussion
The present analysis points out instability of some basal
nodes within the annelid tree. However, most analyses,
irrespective of the used methods and parameter sets, converge to a highly compatible set of actually (or, in the
unrooted trees, potentially) monophyletic taxa. They are
(i) Eunicida-OPC; (ii) Phyllodocida; (iii) SSC; (iv) Cirratuliformia; (v) TCC; (vi) "Clitellatomorpha"; and (vii)
Pogonophora (Figure 2, 4, 5 &6). Several morphologybased taxa like "Scolecida" (= Orbiniidae-Questa, Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae, Arenicolidae-Maldanidae, Capitellidae),
"Terebellida"
(=
Terebelliformia
and
Cirratuliformia), and "Spionida" (= Spionida s.str.,
Magelona, Chaetopteridae, Apistobranchus) [10,11] are definitely polyphyletic.
The most problematic issue is the tree root position. The
all-taxa analyses (that included mollusc and brachiopod
outgroups) supported that the root is situated between
chaetopterids, magelonids, and/or oweniids and the rest
of the Annelida (Figure 2, 3 &4). The experimental analyses (Figures 5, 6) suggested that the non-annelid outgroups were placed next to the Oweniidae, Pogonophora,
and/or "Clitellatomorpha".
Phyllodocida, Eunicida, and the orbinioid-parergodrilid
clade (OPC)
The Phyllodocida (excl. Myzostomida) is consistently a
monophyletic group in all analyses, except for "basal"
placement of the long-branch Tomopteridae in some MP
trees. In all analyses, there is a strongly supported clade
including monophyletic Eunicida (less dinophilids and
sometimes also histriobdellids) and OPC, corroborated
by presence of the lateral/dorsal cirrus organs and larval
akrotrochs. However, the position of the lumbrinerids
could be more basal, as they appeared as a sister group of
the whole Eunicida-Phyllodocida in some purely molecular trees [7,8,23]. The placement of the orbiniids among
the aciculatans provides a strong phylogenetic support for
the hypothesis that their aciculae are homologous with
those of the Euncida and Phyllodocida [24]. The sistergroup relationship between Parergodrilidae and Orbiniidae-Questa is strongly supported by all analyses [8,24];
both groups share gonoducts with a distal glandular part
[25]. No closer orbiniid-spionidan relationships [26]
have been recovered by the present analyses. Also Apistobranchus consistently grouped with OPC in the taxonexclusion analyses. It is, therefore, possible that also the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/189

Apistobranchus acicula-like chaetae [24] might be actually
true aciculae.
"Terebelloid-capitelloid clade" (TCC)
One of the most stable clade covers Terebelliformia,
Capitellidae-Echiurida and Arenicolidae-Maldanidae.
This clade is weakly supported morphologically, by the
specific chaetal arrangement and by the presence of a
gular membrane. The placement of the terebelliformians
close to a generally palpless group provides a phylogenetic
support for the hypothesis that terebelliformian "buccal
tentacles" are not homologous with the true polychaete
palps [27]. Although classified as a separate phylum until
recently, there is a growing consensus that Echiurida is a
subgroup of the Annelida [28], as they exhibit segmentation traits during ontogeny. The explicit hypotheses about
their specific position were published only by molecular
phylogeneticists who discovered close relationships of the
Echiurida to the Capitellidae [7-9,13-16]. Also the Opheliidae and Scalibregmatidae group either within TCC
(present MP, [7,8,15]), or as an isolated clade (present
BI). However, in absence of all other problematic annelids, the Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae clade nests close to
the SSC.
"Sabelloid-spionoid clade" (SSC) and Cirratuliformia
In all trees, Sabellidae, Spionida s.str. (= Spionidae + Trochochaeta + Poecilochaetus), and Sabellariidae form a clade
[8]. The chaetal arrangement in Sabellariidae has recently
been dismissed as homologous to the sabellid-serpulid
chaetal inversion pattern, and therefore provides no support for a sister-group relationship of sabellids and sabellariids with exclusion of the Spionida s.str. [29].
Fauveliopsidae, Sternaspis, Cossuridae and Paraonidae are
consistently placed next to the SSC and/or Cirratuliformia
[[7,17,20,30]; cf. [8]]. The monophyly of the "Terebellida" (joining Cirratuliformia and Terebelliformia [10,11])
has never been found in the molecular and combined
trees.
"Clitellatomorpha"
Phylogenetic position of the Clitellata and most "clitellate-like" annelids is stable and quite surprising in the
present analyses: they always form a clade, further split
into Clitellata and the Hrabeiella-Aphanoneura subclade.
This clade is supported by hermaphroditism, direct development, loss of parapodia, presence of the unbranched
type of ciliary ocelli, metanephridial mantle cell, possibly
also by the dorsal pharynx, and by primarily freshwater/
soil habitats [3] (though many of these characters are
absent or unknown either in Aphanoneura or in
Hrabeiella). The intra-clitellate position of the Aphanoneura was not supported by reliable morphological synapomorphies [[31,32]; cf. [33]], and exclusion of
aphanoneurans from the Clitellata was also indicated by

most previous molecular analyses [8,14,31,34-37]. The
recent molecular analyses, on the contrary, seem to corroborate close relationships between Clitellata and (some
of) the "clitellate-like polychaetes" [7,8,16,31,37,38]. The
close relationships of the Clitellata to some eunicidans or
dinophilids [15,16], or to TCC [7,8] have never been
found in the present analyses.
Pogonophora and "basal Canalipalpata"
In the present analyses, the Pogonophora (= Siboglinidae)
is closely related to the "Clitellatomorpha" or, in absence
of the latter group, Pogonophora alone groups as a sister
group of SSC. Three groups of the traditional Canalipalpata, namely, Oweniidae, Magelona, and Chaetopteridae,
were usually placed among the most basal annelids, or
even outside the Annelida, in the present all-species analyses [7-9,15,17]. The taxon-exclusion analyses suggested
that magelonids and oweniids might in fact be attracted
strongly towards the remote annelid outgroups. In
absence of all other "problematic" annelids, Oweniidae
alone grouped consistently with the Pogonophora (supported predominantly by the intraepidermal nerve cord
[7,20]), and Magelona either with the Paraonidae (uMP)
or as a sister group of the Cirratuliformia-SSC superclade
(BI). On the contrary, basal placement of the Chaetopteridae cannot be excluded [9].
Amphinomida and Aberranta
In the most present analyses, Aberranta is a sister group of
the Amphinomida, and the whole clade is one of the
basalmost annelid branches, far from the other Aciculata
[7,8,15]. However, in the taxon-exclusion tests, the Aberranta-Amphinomida clade (weakly supported by median
prostomial antennae and parapodial branchiae) is placed
as a sister group of the Phyllodocida (BI) or even within it
(uMP). It is then possible that the Aberranta-Amphinomida clade is, in fact, one of subgroups of the monophyletic
Aciculata [10,11], misplaced in most molecular trees (due
to their strong attraction towards the outgroups?). Therefore, it seems rather premature to regard Amphinomida as
a basal group, "based on the tetraneurous organization of
the nervous system" [7]; moreover, the presence of several
peripheral longitudinal nerves is not limited to the
amphinomids [27].
"Core archiannelids" (Nerillidae, Polygordiidae,
Protodrilidae, Protodriloides)
Monophyly of the "Archiannelida" has been rejected by
all modern authors [4], whereas the monophyly of Protodrilida (= Saccocirridae + Protodrilidae + Protodriloidides)
as well as its spionidan affinities has been proposed
recently [4]. The polygordiids were regarded as relatives of
protodrilidans or of opheliids [39], or as the canalipalpatans of uncertain position [11]. Surprisingly, the molecular trees tend to include a clade covering most of the
traditional "archiannelids" [8]. In the present all-taxa BI

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/189

tree, there is a well-supported basal annelid clade including Nerillidae-Protodrilidae and Polygordiidae-Saccocirridae. Although Nerillidae were considered aciculatans of
uncertain position [11,22], closer relationships of the
Nerillidae with any Aciculata have never been retrieved in
the present analyses. In conclusion, it is an interesting
working hypothesis that the "Archiannelida" (less
Dinophilidae and possibly also Protodriloides) might form
a clade [8], either basal, or close to the SSC [4,11,40-43].
Sipunculida and Dinophilidae
The Sipunculida have been considered a separate phylum
by most authors [6]. Although they as adults do not
exhibit any signs of segmentation, sipunculids show transitional stages of segmentation during development of
their ventral nerve cord [44,45]. Analyses of the mitochondrial genomes [46-51] as well as phylogenomics [9]
suggest that the sipunculids are an annelid ingroup. The
unique correspondence of podocyte lining the metanephridia appears to join Sipunculida with the Sabellida
and Terebelliformia [33]. The pharyngeal apparatus in the
sipunculid pelagosphere larvae is similar to that found in
the Cirratuliformia [52]. In the present trees, the sipunculids have always been found as an annelid ingroup, often
close to the Dinophilidae. No closer relationships
between sipunculids and terebelliformians, sabellidans,
oweniids or chaetopterids [7,15,33] were recovered here.
The enigmatic Dinophilidae were never found to be
closely related to the Dorvilleidae (or Eunicida), i.e. in the
placement expected by the morphologists [10,42,43].
Even Parapodrilus, one of the presumably dinophilidrelated, "progenetic" dorvilleids [42], groups consistently
with other dorvilleids within the Eunicida and shows no
affinities to the Dinophilidae [25,35]. In the taxon-exclusion analyses, both Dinophilidae and Sipunculida group
within the Cirratuliformia (uMP), or they are a sister
group of the Pogonophora-"Clitellatomorpha" superclade (BI). In conclusion, close affinities between Dinophilidae and Sipunculida (supported by the shared loss of
chaetae, parapodia, circulatory system, and palps) appear
as a possible working hypothesis [8], but the precise position of this clade remains uncertain.
Myzostomida
Relationships of the Myzostomida, traditionally regarded
as aberrant polychaetes, probably phyllodocidans
[6,10,11], are uncertain. They may be either basal protostomes [53] or platyzoan relatives [54,55]. Their highly
aberrant sequences (the longest branch in the present BI
tree) and uncertain homology of many morphological
characters do not allow to deduce their relationships precisely. Nevertheless, the numerous annelid-like traits of
the Myzostomida [56-58] still could corroborate some
polychaete-myzostomid proximity. Recently, Bleidorn et
al. [48,49] re-examined this issue by analysis of four
nuclear genes and a mitochondrial genome and showed
Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:189

myzostomids are likely part of the annelid radiation. On
the contrary, in the comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of the Metazoa [9], Myzostomida are placed within the
Platyzoa [cf. [49]]. In the present analyses, the myzostomids seem to belong into the Annelida (possibly into the
Aciculata, as suggested by the taxon-exclusion tests). However, the taxon sampling in this paper does not provide a
suitable test for alternative hypotheses due to lack of most
of the possible non-annelid relatives of the Myzostomida
(Gnathifera, Cycliophora, Platyhelminthes [9,53-55]).

Conclusion
The combined ("total-evidence") phylogenetic analysis
provides a modified view of annelid evolution. Several
higher-level annelid taxa are suggested by our analyses,
i.e. Phyllodocida, Eunicida, the orbinioid-parergodrilid
clade, Cirratuliformia, sabelloid-spionoid clade, terebelloid-capitellid clade (incl. Echiurida), and "Clitellatomorpha". Although the deep-level evolutionary relationships
of Annelida remain poorly understood, we propose sistergroup relationships between the Phyllodocida-AberrantaAmphinomida and Eunicida-OPC clades, between the
Cirratuliformia and SSC, and possibly also between the
"Clitellatomorpha" and Oweniidae-Pogonophora clades.
Two unorthodox clades, "core Archiannelida" and
Dinophilidae-Sipunculida, are proposed here.

Methods
Taxonomy, datasets, and data combination
The present analysis was performed to include all available "families" of the Polychaeta, plus representatives of
the Clitellata, Echiurida, Pogonophora, Myzostomida,
Sipunculida, Mollusca, and Brachiopoda (as a rooting
outgroup). All but a few annelid nominal "families" were
included; the exceptions were enigmatic annelid (?) genera Lobatocerebrum, Diurodrilus [5], and Jennaria, "mesozoan" Orthonectida (annelid affinities of which were
proposed occasionally [59]), Hartmaniellidae (Eunicida),
and several, mostly pelagic or parasitic subgroups of the
Phyllodocida, for which no molecular data were available
at time.

The morphological dataset (MOR) included 93 characters
[see Additional Files 1 and 2]. The gene sequences were
obtained from GenBank. The dataset included six genes,
both protein-coding (EF1α, histone H3, COI) and ribosomal (18S, 28S, and 16S), and both nuclear (18S, 28S,
EF1α, H3) and mitochondrial (16S, COI) [see Additional
File 3]. The protein-coding sequences were translated to
amino acids and then aligned with CLUSTAL W under
default settings for gap costs (gap opening penalty 10.00;
gap extension penalty 0.20). The alignment of sequences
for ribosomal RNA genes was conducted in the on-line
version of MAFFT v6 in the E-INS-i mode [60]. Ambigu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/189

ous positions were excluded by using Gblocks [61]. The
saturated positions were not excluded [8].
The combined datasets were completed by introducing
question marks for the absent data partitions. To minimize the number of missing entries in the dataset, composite terminals were constructed with individual
partitions from different species of a higher taxon, usually
a nominal "family" [see Additional File 4].
Phylogenetic analyses
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was conducted with a
Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
[62] as implemented in MrBayes v3.1.2 [63]. MrModelTest v2.2 [64], a simplified version of ModelTest 3.06
[65], and PAUP* v4.0b10 [66] were used to estimate
GTR+Ã substitution model as the best-fitting for all
molecular character sets (based on both AIC and hLRT criteria). Morphological characters were treated with the
standard discrete model assuming gamma-shaped rate
variation and variable coding bias. Model parameters
were unlinked across partitions. Two independent runs of
combined analysis with 10 Markov chains each were conducted for 10,000,000 generations with a sample frequency of 100 (heating 0.1). The first 61,000 trees from
each run were discarded as burn-in; convergence between
the two runs was estimated using diagnostics criteria produced by the "sump" command in MrBayes (PSRF [TL] =
1.001). The remaining 78,000 trees were used for reconstruction of a 50% majority-rule consensus tree. Testing
the influence of burnin value on the consensual tree
revealed a high stability of the tree topology within the
whole investigated range (burn-in 61,000 to 90,000).

The maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis was applied to
MOR, molecular, and combined data matrices (NONA
version 2.0 [67]: heuristics, option "hold10000 mult*100
hold/100", unconstrained search strategy with TBR
branch swapping). Bremer indices of branch support and
bootstrap support values were calculated by NONA
(options "bsupport10000" and "mult*100 hold/10" with
1,000 replications, respectively).
In addition, two "experimental" MP analyses (both in
NONA: option "hold10000 mult*100 hold/100", unconstrained search strategy with TBR branch swapping) were
performed.
(1) The modified "slow-fast" method [68] was used to
remove characters (both morphological and molecular)
that were supposedly responsible for stochastic information noise. New datasets were constructed, in which only
characters with no observed variability within one of the
11 clades (that were present in both all-taxa BI and MP

trees) were included. The analysed clades included Cirratuliformia (5 spp.), SSC (6), "Clitellatomorpha" (7), TCC
(10), Phyllodocida (19), Eunicida (6), Pogonophora (4),
Amphinomida (2), Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae (2),
Sipunculida (2), and Mollusca (3). All reduced datasets
were then concatenated to a new, weighted dataset, in
which each original character received a weight from 11 to
zero. Moreover, all characters with more than 80% of
ambiguous (unknown, inapplicable, or polymorphic)
character states were excluded. The final weighted dataset
included 17,268 informative "characters" (601 morphological and 16,667 molecular).

(2) To test preliminary results suggesting that ingroup and
outgroup taxon selection affected internal relationships,
we ran several taxon-exclusion analyses. The "problematic" species/clades (Myzostomida, Opheliidae, Scalibregmatidae,
Fauveliopsidae,
Serpulidae,
Magelona,
Oweniidae, Chaetopteridae, Pectinariidae, Apistobranchus,
Polygordiidae, Saccocirridae, Protodrilidae, Protodriloides,
Nerillidae, Histriobdellidae, Dinophilidae, Sipunculida,
Hesionidae, Paralacydoniidae, Nepthyidae, Pilargidae,
Tomopteridae, Aberranta, Amphinomida) were identified
as follows: (i) their position was highly unstable in comparison of the all-taxa uMP, wMP and BI trees; and/or (ii)
their presence/absence caused important topological
changes; and/or (iii) they were consistenly placed basally
or even outside the Annelida in both MP and BI trees.
Topological effects of including/removing the species
identified as "problematic" were tested by constructing an
unrooted "backbone tree" to which individual "problematic" species were appended in one-by-one manner.
