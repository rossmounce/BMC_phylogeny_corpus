Abstract
Background: The function and structure of protein translocons at the outer and inner envelope
membrane of chloroplasts (Toc and Tic complexes, respectively) are a subject of intensive
research. One of the proteins that have been ascribed to the Tic complex is Tic62. This protein
was proposed as a redox sensor protein and may possibly act as a regulator during the
translocation process. Tic62 is a bimodular protein that comprises an N-terminal module,
responsible for binding to pyridine nucleotides, and a C-terminal module which serves as a docking
site for ferredoxin-NAD(P)-oxido-reductase (FNR). This work focuses on evolutionary analysis of
the Tic62-NAD(P)-related protein family, derived from the comparison of all available sequences,
and discusses the structure of Tic62.
Results: Whereas the N-terminal module of Tic62 is highly conserved among all oxyphototrophs,
the C-terminal region (FNR-binding module) is only found in vascular plants. Phylogenetic analyses
classify four Tic62-NAD(P)-related protein subfamilies in land plants, closely related to members
from cyanobacteria and green sulphur bacteria. Although most of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related
eukaryotic proteins are localized in the chloroplast, one subgroup consists of proteins without a
predicted transit peptide. The N-terminal module of Tic62 contains the structurally conserved
Rossman fold and probably belongs to the extended family of short-chain dehydrogenasesreductases. Key residues involved in NADP-binding and residues that may attach the protein to the
inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts or to the Tic complex are proposed.
Conclusion: The Tic62-NAD(P)-related proteins are of ancient origin since they are not only
found in cyanobacteria but also in green sulphur bacteria. The FNR-binding module at the Cterminal region of the Tic62 proteins is probably a recent acquisition in vascular plants, with no
sequence similarity to any other known motifs. The presence of the FNR-binding domain in
vascular plants might be essential for the function of the protein as a Tic component and/or for its
regulation.

Background
Chloroplasts, together with mitochondria, are the major
energy producers in all eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. The endosymbiotic theory proposes a prokaryotic

origin for plastids and mitochondria. During the endosymbiotic process a host cell engulfed distinct ancestral
bacteria. Part of the genomes of these endosymbiotic bacteria have been kept and, as a result, plastids and mito-

chondria are the only organelles in the cell containing
their own genome. However, while the chloroplast
genome is composed of about 120 genes, its proteome is
estimated to consist of about 3000 proteins [1]. The development of highly specific organellar transport mechanisms was thus the response to the necessity for reimporting the gene products and to guarantee an optimal
communication between cells and organelles.
The general import pathway in chloroplasts involves the
cooperation of two heteroligomeric complexes in the
outer and inner envelope of chloroplasts, namely the Toc
complex–composed of Toc159, Toc75, Toc64, Toc34 and
Toc12 subunits–and the Tic complex–made up of Tic110,
Tic62, Tic55, Tic40, Tic32, Tic22 and Tic20 subunits–
respectively [2]. For a proper import activity, several chaperones in the cytosol (Hsp90 and cHsp70), intermembrane space (isHsp70) and stroma (ClpC and Cpn60) are
functionally coordinated during different stages of the
transport process [3-5].
Unlike the different protein transport systems in thylakoids, the protein import machinery in the outer/inner
envelope membrane of chloroplasts does not show obvious homology to any bacterial secretion system [6]. This
is hardly surprising since the bacterial systems were
required for thylakoids and therefore a new transport
machinery had to be developed in the host cell to maintain the specificity for chloroplast communication. However, sequence analyses indicated that certain components
of the translocons in chloroplasts are of bacterial origin.
Besides, there is a parallelism in the chaperone system
required in some transport stages [6]. The translocation
channel in the outer envelope membrane, Toc75, is
related to outer membrane proteins involved in the transport or integration of proteins in Gram-negative bacteria
[7,8]. Tic20, which is discussed to constitute part of the
protein-conducting channel, shares sequence similarities
to bacterial amino acid transporters [9]. Other subunits
might have been recruited and adapted as they show
homology to bacterial proteins not related to transport
processes. Tic22, which is thought to mediate the interaction of the Toc and Tic complexes during import, has
cyanobacterial counterparts with unknown function and
is proposed to be localized in the thylakoid lumen [10].
Some cyanobacterial proteins contain cofactor-binding
motifs similar to those found in Tic62, Tic55 and Tic32.
Tic55 contains a Rieske iron-sulphur centre and a mononuclear iron-binding site [11], and Tic62 and Tic32 each
have a NAD(P)-binding motif [12,13]. No prokaryotic
counterparts have been detected by direct sequence comparison for the other subunits that compose the translocons, which may indicate that they have evolved from the
proteome of the ancestral host to fulfil specific functions
demanded after the development of plastids and to ensure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/43

the specificity of the transport process in the outer/inner
envelope membranes of chloroplasts.
Genome-wide analyses had shown that some subunits of
the translocons (Toc75, Toc159, Toc34, Tic20) are
encoded by more than one gene in Arabidopsis thaliana
[14,15]. Experimental data derived from analyses of the
isoforms of the Toc complex revealed that the different
members associate with structurally and developmentally
distinct import complexes. Four homologues compose
the Toc75 family in Arabidopsis thaliana (atToc75-I,
atToc75-III, atToc75-IV and atToc75-V). The gene encoding the functional orthologue of Toc75 from Pisum sativum, atToc75-III, is essential for the viability of plants
from the embryonic stage. This is not the case for atToc75IV, which could play a role during growth in the dark. It
seems that atToc75-I is in fact a pseudogene [16]. The
function and relation with the Toc machinery of atToc75V is still a matter of intensive study. In the case of Toc34
and Toc159 families, two (atToc33 and atToc34) and four
(atToc159, atToc132, atToc120 and atToc90) isoforms are
identified in the Arabidopsis genome, respectively.
Whereas atToc33 associates preferably with atToc159,
atToc34 does with atToc132/atToc120 and this association is likely related to the import of photosynthetic and
non-photosynthetic precursors, respectively [17,18]. Four
homologues are identified for Tic20 in Arabidopsis and
only two of them contain a predicted transit peptide.
However, the function and subcellular localization of the
two Tic20 homologues with non-predicted transit peptide
are still unknown [14].
In spite of the wealth of information about the Toc complex, less is known about phylogenetic relationships of
the Tic complex subunits. Here we take a closer look at the
structure, function and evolution of one component of
the Tic complex, Tic62. The N-terminal module of Tic62
has a conserved NAD(P)-binding site and its C-terminal
region was found to interact with ferredoxin-NAD(P)oxido-reductase (FNR) [12]. Homology searches and phylogenetic analyses show that the N-terminal domain is
highly conserved among all oxyphototrophs and green
sulphur bacteria. However, the C-terminal region (FNRbinding domain) is only found in vascular plants. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that there are four groups of
Tic62-NAD(P)-related proteins in land plants. The first
group is orthologous to the reported Tic62 from pea [12].
The physiological roles of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related proteins in the cell remain to be shown.

Results and discussion
Tic62, a protein of 62 kDa that is part of the Tic complex,
has been proposed to function as a sensor protein whose
possible role is to regulate protein import into chloroplasts by sensing and reacting to the redox state of the

Figure sequence alignment of the C-terminal domain of the Tic62 protein family from vascular plants
Multiple1
Multiple sequence alignment of the C-terminal domain of the Tic62 protein family from vascular plants. The
multiple sequence alignment shows the FNR-binding domain in vascular plants (residues 387–534 in psTic62). Three repetitive
motifs, S-P-Y-x (2)-Y-x-D/E-L-K-P (2)-S/T/A-S/T-P-S/T-P, involved in the binding of FNR [12] are highly conserved within the
family. A fourth repetition found just in Arabidopsis sequence is marked in a box. The pea (PISSA), Arabidopsis thaliana (ARATH)
and Oryza sativa (ORYSA) sequences were retrieved from GenBank. The sequences from tomato (LYCES), Glycine max
(GLYMA), Medicago truncatula (MEDTR) and Triticum aestivum (TRIAE) were identified in dbEST and retrieved from plantGDB.
The representation of the alignment is the standard from the ClustalX program [43].

organelle. So far the only Tic62 protein studied is that
from Pisum sativum [12]. This protein was found to have
two functional modules: the N-terminus was shown to
bind pyridine nucleotides and the C-terminal region
interacts with FNR. The FNR-binding module consists of a
repetitive, highly conserved KPPSSP motif. One or two
transmembrane helices were proposed for the pea
sequence and both the N- and the C-terminus seem to face
the stroma [12].
Excluding the transit peptide, psTic62 consists of 470 residues. The blast search against the protein databases with
psTic62 [Swiss-Prot:Q8SKU2] as a template resulted in
several sequences from which just two correspond to the
full-length form of the mature psTic62: one from Arabidopsis thaliana [GenBank:NP_188519] and another from
Oryza sativa [GenBank:ABG65881]. All the other hits,
which showed recognizable sequence similarity to the Nterminal NAD(P)-binding domain of Tic62, lack the Cterminal module (residues 387–534) responsible for the
FNR binding and represent a short version of the Tic62
protein. A search of the FNR-binding motif over dbEST
revealed its presence exclusively in vascular plant organisms (e.g., Lycopersicon esculentum, Medicago truncatula,
Triticum aestivum, Glycine max, Lotus japonica) (Figure 1).
Interestingly, all the proteins homologous to the NAD(P)binding part of Tic62 were from photosynthetic organisms (green plants, oxyphotobacteria, and green sulphur
bacteria). A multiple sequence alignment of these pro-

teins is shown in Figure 2. A phylogenetic tree was built
based on the alignment (Figure 3). Both the multiple
alignment and the phylogenetic tree indicate that the
Tic62-NAD(P)-related protein family is made up of four
well-supported clusters (support values of 100/95, 100/
68, 100/100 and 100/100, Figure 3) that have been
divided into six groups. These groups are schematically
represented in Figure 4 and are described below. The four
plant subfamilies are classified according to the GenBank
accession number of the Arabidopsis protein found within
each group (the locus_tag of the Arabidopsis gene is shown
in parenthesis).
(i) Group I: NP_188519 (At3g18890). This subfamily
contains the original Tic62 sequence from pea and makes
up the Tic62 family, even though not all the members of
this family have a molecular weight of 62 kDa and the
association with the Tic machinery remains to be shown
(see below). It is composed of proteins from chloroplastcontaining organisms of land plants and red algae. So far
no sequence of this subfamily was found in green algae
(Ostreococcus or Chlamydomonas), in the diatom Thalassiosira or in any oxyphotobacteria. Because a final
annotation of the green algae genomes is still in progress,
a final confirmation of the absence of the protein of group
I in green algae is pending. This group is characterized by
the motif E-R-P/A-T-D-X-Ar-K/G-E-T-H (residues 350–
371 in Figure 2), where Ar represents an aromatic residue.
Surprisingly, only the sequences from vascular plants
within this group show the full-length version of the Tic62

Multiple sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related protein family. A multiple
sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain (residues 87–334 in psTic62) of representative members of each of the six
groups of Tic62-NAD(P)-related sequences was performed with ClustalX. Above the alignment the site of the GxxGxxG motif
and the known secondary structure of the NP_568098 sequence from Arabidopsis [PDB:1XQ6] are displayed. α-helices and βstrands are represented by cylinders and arrows, respectively. The positions of the residues involved in the binding of NADP
are marked with a triangle, and the identities of the residues from the crystal structure are indicated. The conserved residues
between 1XQ6 and psTic62 are underlined. The sequence motifs that distinguish each group are shown in a box (see Results
and Discussion). In the alignment the sequences are indicated with an abbreviation of the name of the organism followed by its

protein and contain the FNR-binding motif at the C-terminus. A minor distinction between Tic62 from Arabidopsis and the other full-length sequences is the number
of four or three repetitive modules, respectively (Figure 1).
Exhaustive searches for the FNR-interacting repeat in the
Physcomitrella patens genome revealed no hits to these
regions. 3'RACE PCRs of the detected Physcomitrella
Tic62 gene were performed to determine its C-terminal
sequence. It resulted exclusively in the short form of the
gene, giving a stop codon in position 259. Additionally,

immunodecoration with the pea Tic62 antibody, raised
against the C-terminal part of the protein (residues 412–
534), showed no signal in Physcomitrella chloroplasts
(data not shown). Finally, an insertion of 6–15 residues
(positions 148–168 in the alignment, Figure 2) is found
in vascular plants and red algae. The search of this motif
in the Physcomitrella genome resulted in no hits. The
overall identity of the sequences composing this subfamily is 40%. All of them contain a transit peptide for targeting the protein to chloroplasts, and they might be

Presence of Tic62-NAD(P)-related proteins in cyanobacteria, algae, land plants and green sulphur bacteria
Presence of Tic62-NAD(P)-related proteins in cyanobacteria, algae, land plants and green sulphur bacteria.
Tic62 is a bimodular protein (Nt and Ct modules for NAD(P) and FNR binding, respectively) with a transient transit peptide
(TP) for importing into chloroplasts. The presence of the modules and/or the transit peptide is indicated for the Tic62NAD(P)-related proteins. A question mark indicates that the complete genome is not available and: a the absence of the protein cannot be assured; b the existence of a transit peptide is not known. cProteins corresponding to group IV are only found in
unicellular and filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria and not in others such as Gloeobacter violaceus, Prochlorococcus marinus
or Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (see text). The accession numbers in the corresponding database (indicated in brackets) for the
proteins found in this figure are the following: Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBank), NP_188519 (group I), NP_565789 (group II),
NP_568098/NP_565868 (group IV, without/with transit peptide), NP_194881 (group V); Physcomitrella patens (PhyscoDB), contig 2031 (group I), contig 5715 (group II), contig1791/contig9865 (group IV, without/with transit peptide), BQ040198 (group
V); Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (ChlamyDB), 193756 (group II), 118820 (group IV), 123134 (group V); Galdieria sulphuraria (The
Galdieria sulphuraria Genome Project), hter25g11 (group I), A436F01 (group IV); Nostoc sp. PCC7120 (GenBank), ZP_00112007

localized at the inner envelope membrane as it was previously reported for the pea sequence [12], though the FNRbinding domain could modulate the subcellular localization of the protein by the interaction with FNR and/or
other proteins.
(ii) Group II: NP_565789 (At2g34460). The members of
this subfamily are homologous to the short version of the
Tic62 protein from vascular plants. This subfamily is composed of proteins from the green algae Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, and both non-vascular and vascular plants
(Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis, respectively). Surprisingly,
there is no sign of the presence of members of this group
in red algae genomes (Galdieria, Porphyra or Cyanidioschyzon). This group is closely related to group I and the
phylogenetic tree is highly consistent in splitting up these
two groups (Figure 3). The green plant sequences of this
group are characterized by the motif L-V-N-G-A-A-p-G-Qx(2)-N-P-A-Y, where p represents a polar residue (range
282–296 in Figure 2). The proteins from green plants contain an N-terminal extension, which is predicted to act as

a transit peptide to target the proteins to chloroplasts.
Recently, the Arabidopsis protein has been identified in a
proteomic analysis of isolated plastoglobules [19].
(iii) Group III. This cyanobacterial subfamily is composed
of proteins from a variety of organisms such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the small-genome cyanobacteria
Prochlorococcus marinus (MIT9313, SS120 and MED4) or
the heterocystous cyanobacteria Nostoc sp. This group
comes together with groups I and II in a well-supported
cluster (support values 100/95) and the phylogenetic trees
were highly consistent in outgrouping the sequence from
Gloeobacter violaceus (Figure 3), a cyanobacterial member
of an early branching lineage [20]. Due to the annotation
in the databases of the Synechocystis sequence from this
family (NP_441422, sll1218) as ycf39 gene product, a
connection between Tic62 and ycf39 was previously proposed [12]. However, it can be traced that the original
ycf39 gene product is not related to sll1218 but to slr0399
in Synechocystis [GenBank:NP_441851] [12]. Both cyanobacterial proteins share 26% identity and 42% similarity.

Page 6 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:43

The ycf39 gene product (slr0399) was found to act as a
chaperone for quinone binding [21]. This cyanobacterial
protein is similar to the NP_195251Arabidopsis sequence
that is not a Tic62-NAD(P)-related protein. Therefore, it
can be argued that a connection between Tic62 and ycf39
may be an artefact originated by a non-reliable annotation
in the protein database.
(iv) Group IV, NP_194881 (At4g31530). This group is
made up of proteins from green plants and, interestingly,
only unicellular and filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria. The members of this family also represent short versions of the Tic62 protein. So far no sequences from red
algae were found. This group is characterized by the motif
G-P-Y-T-S-Y-D-L-N-T-L-L-K/Q-A-T/K-A/S/T (range 353–
377 in Figure 2). The land plant sequences contain a predicted chloroplast transit peptide and proteomics studies
have localized the protein from Arabidopsis in chloroplasts
[22]. The lack of homologous sequences in other cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis or Prochlorococcus may be in
accordance with a previously reported work, which
showed that Nostoc proteins have higher similarity to Arabidopsis nuclear-encoded proteins than proteins from
Prochlorococcus or Synechocystis [23].
(v) Group V, NP_568098 (At5g02240). This family consists of proteins exclusively from eukaryotic phototrophs,
which show homology to the short version of Tic62. The
sequences of the land plant members of this group are
characterized by the motif T-S-A-V-P-K-M-K-P-G-F-D-P-S/
T-K-G-G-R-P-E-F-h, where h represents a hydrophobic residue (range 206–227 in Figure 2). Two different subgroups of sequences within this subfamily in land plants
were identified, which are differentiated by the presence
of a predicted transit peptide. This may suggest a dual
localization in the cell for the members of this group. The
first subgroup comprises land plant proteins without a
predicted transit peptide. These proteins are [GenBank:NP_568098] (At5g02240), [GenBank:AAK73149]
(Os03g60740) and [PhyscoDB:contig1791] from Arabidopsis, rice and Physcomitrella, respectively. The second
subgroup is composed of sequences that contain a predicted transit peptide for chloroplasts: [GenBank:NP_565868] (At2g37660), [GenBank:ABF99604]
(Os05g01970) and [PhyscoDB:contig9865] from Arabidopsis, rice and Physcomitrella, respectively. At2g37660 has
been found in chloroplasts by proteomics analyses [22].
In spite of a possible difference in localization, the two
subgroups are highly similar (e.g., 79% identity between
NP_568098 and NP_565868 in Arabidopsis) which suggests a similar function in the cell. Only incomplete
sequences were found in the algae genomes analysed
(Chlamydomonas and Galdieria) and, therefore, no further
conclusions can be made for these organisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/43

The structure of the NP_568098Arabidopsis protein bound
to NADP has been recently solved at 1.8 Å resolution by
X-ray crystallography [PDB:1XQ6]. The residues involved
in the binding to the cofactor are marked with a triangle
in the multiple sequence alignment (Figure 2).
(vi) Group VI. The last group to be mentioned corresponds to proteins of green sulphur bacteria (Figure 2 and
Figure 4). Two subgroups are recognized, which likely
originated from a gene duplication event (Figure 3). The
similarity search using psTic62 as a template retrieved
sequences from green sulphur bacteria with homology to
the short version of Tic62. These are anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria that contain a type-I (Fe-S) reaction
centre. A reverse blast search, using the green sulphur
Tic62-related sequences, did not retrieve any sequences
from oxyphotosynthetic organisms different from the
groups mentioned above. Although very different organisms, the genome comparison between green sulphur bacteria and oxyphotosynthetic organisms showed that many
components of photosynthesis and energy metabolism
are highly similar. Green sulphur bacteria, cyanobacteria
and eukaryotic phototrophs are the only organisms that
synthesize chlorophyll a and also directly reduce pyridine
nucleotides[24].
The presence of so many proteins in chloroplasts related
to the NAD(P)-binding domain of Tic62 deserves a
detailed study. The function of the N-terminal module
seems important for the viability of the photosynthetic
organisms since the gene has been conserved in all the
genomes. All the proteins are predicted to bind pyridine
nucleotides and are referred here as Tic62-NAD(P)-related
family due to the similarity to the NAD(P)-binding
domain of psTic62. The Tic62-NAD(P)-related family is of
ancient origin, as proteins were not only found in ancient
cyanobacteria (Gloeobacter violaceus) but also in green sulphur bacteria. This might propose that a Tic62-NAD(P)related protein was already present in the ancestor who
evolved to green sulphur bacteria and cyanobacteria. The
presence of two genes in Nostoc punctiforme (groups III and
IV) might suggest that a gene duplication event occurred
prior to the evolution of cyanobacteria (Figure 3). Some
cyanobacterial organisms could have lost one of the
genes, which could explain its absence in Gloeobacter,
Prochlorococcus and Synechocystis in group IV. Two highly
supported groups (I and II) together with group III comprise a big cluster of sequences and groups I and II are possibly derived from group III which contains the majority
of the cyanobacterial proteins. A four-cluster likelihoodmapping analysis (cluster a = group I+II, cluster b = group
III, cluster c = group IV, cluster d = group V or cluster a =
group I, cluster b = group II, cluster c = group IV, cluster d
= group V) showed that branching order (a, b)–(c, d) was
favoured in more than 90% of 10,000 puzzling, and dem-

onstrated that group V is closely related to group IV. The
presence of paralogues in land plants of group V could be
due to a gene duplication event within the eukaryotic
organism.
Most of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related proteins in higher
plants are found in chloroplasts, but only the specific
localization of psTic62 (group I) at the inner envelope
membrane of chloroplasts and NP_565789 (At2g24460,
group II) in plastoglobules have been shown experimentally [12,19]. It would be worth investigating the subcellular localization of the other members of the family and,
especially, to analyse the possible dual localization of the
proteins belonging to group V. The lack of a transit peptide had also been described in two homologues that
compose the Tic20 family in Arabidopsis [14]. A possible
localization outside plastids could be another example of
a protein of cyanobacterial origin that has been redirected
to a compartment different from plastids [23]. However,
the targeting information to chloroplasts could be different from the canonical transit peptide [22,25,26] and a
localization of such proteins in chloroplasts cannot be
excluded. The presence of members of the family at the
inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts, involved in the
import process, and in plastoglobules, structures that act
as a functional metabolic link between the inner envelope
and thylakoid membranes, points to an important role of
the protein family in metabolism.
The resolution of the structure of a protein is a major step
in understanding the function. Since the similarity among
sequences in the Tic62-NAD(P)-related family is sufficiently high, the knowledge of the structure of one member of Tic62-related family permits to draw general
conclusions about the structure of other members. The
crystallized NP_568098 protein shows the typical
NADPH-Rossman fold. Figure 2 also represents the secondary structure of the crystallized NP_568098 protein.
Clearly, most of the insertions and deletions of the proteins in this family correspond to loops in the crystal
structure and most of the motifs related to α- and β-conformations are highly conserved. Therefore, the NADPHRossman fold is also expected for the core structure of all
members of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related family, with differences mainly in the loop regions. The glycine-motif in the
coenzyme-binding region is fully conserved in the whole
family (GxxGxxG, range 111–116 in Figure 2) and it may
be related to the extended short-chain dehydrogenasereductase superfamily [27]. The highly conserved aspartic
acid residue required for stabilization of the adeninebinding pocket is found in the loop between β3 and α3,
except for group VI [28]. However, large differences are
expected in the regions of the β5 and β6 strands. In the
crystal structure, these two β-strands form an antiparallel
β-sheet, which connect a long loop (Figure 2; see below).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/43

The differences in this region among the subfamilies
could be correlated to the specific function of each subfamily. Since the protein was crystallized in the presence
of NADP, the residues involved in the binding to the
cofactor were identified (G11, S13, G14, R15, T16, R38,
G55, D56, I57, L76, T77, S78, A79, V80, Q103, V131,
G132, S133, K155, A174, G175, G176, L177, R205; for
underlined residues see below). These residues are
marked in Figure 2. From the multiple sequence alignment it can be concluded that many residues that bind to
NADP are highly conserved within the family (9 out of
22). Specifically, the conservation of the residues (or their
physicochemical properties) involved in the NADP binding is high in members of group I (14 out of 22). These
residues are underlined above and they could represent
the residues implicated in the NADP binding of Tic62.
Mutagenesis studies are necessary to establish the role of
these residues clearly.
The mode of interaction of Tic62 with the membrane/Tic
complex is unknown. Previous experiments showed that
likely hydrophobic contacts mediate the binding to the
membrane/Tic complex, as most of the protein remains
within the membrane upon alkaline and urea treatments
[12]. TMHMM [29] and PredictProtein [30] algorithms do
not predict any transmembrane helices in group I. Moreover, protease digestion experiments showed that psTic62
is protected in inner envelope vesicles that, together with
the hydrophilic profile of Tic62, suggest that the protein
faces the stroma while attached to the membrane/Tic
complex. Based on the identity (27% identity; 41% similarity) between atTic62 (NP_188519) and NP_568098
[PDB:1XQ6], a homology model procedure was followed
to construct a model for the NADP-binding domain of the
Tic62 protein (residues 78–331 in atTic62; see additional
file 1: PDB coordinates for the atTic62 model). Figure 5a
shows the sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain
of the atTic62 protein and the template based on the multiple sequence alignment of the Tic62-NAD(P)-related
family (Figure 2). The key residues involved in the pyridine ring binding are shown in red. The predicted secondary structure of atTic62 is compared with the known
secondary structure of the template. As can be seen, most
of the conformational elements are conserved in both
sequences. Slight differences are the presence of β5 and β6
strands in the template (as mentioned above), and two
smalls α-helices predicted between β2 and β3 strands in
atTic62. A model was built based on this alignment and it
was structurally evaluated with WHATCHECK. The corresponding values were good: Ramachandran plot, -2.215;
backbone conformation, -3.761; chi-1/chi-2 rotamer normality, -1.150; bond lengths, 0.716; bond angles, 1.439.
Only the values for the backbone conformation were
poor, but this is probably due to gaps in the alignment
and located in loop regions of the template (Figure 5a). In

fact, the structural analysis obtained by the VERIFY3D
program assigns positive values all over the structure,
except in the regions LQNTDEGT and FPAAILNLFWGVLC
in atTic62 (minimum value of -0.16) that support the previous proposal. The energetic parameter of the model was
E = -4082.780 kJ·mol-1. In Figure 5b, a view of the proposed structural model for at Tic62 (blue) superimposed
to the template (green) is despicted. The NADP ligand is
shown in red and the residues involved in the binding are
underlined in Figure 5a. It can be seen that the β5 and β6
elements connect a long loop that is missing in atTic62
(Figure 5a and 5b). Interestingly, a large number of hydrophobic residues is concentrated in this region in atTic62
(Figure 5c, marked in orange). The model presented here
for atTic62 suggests that the hydrophobic region (residues
180–184 and 217–233 in atTic62 sequence in Figure 5c,
which correspond to residues 247–251 and 291–310 in
the alignment shown in Figure 2) might be responsible for
attaching the protein to the inner envelope membrane of
chloroplasts or to the Tic complex, and this region would
establish differences in the localisation within cells
between the two groups of proteins (template and
model). By this way, Tic62 would be attached to the mem-

brane, without spanning it, exposing the two functional
modules to the stromal side. The hydrophilic profile and
the large number of conserved proline residues at the Cterminal domain make it a better candidate for proteinprotein interactions rather than for insertion into the
membrane [31]. These interactions might also contribute
to the binding of Tic62 to the membrane/Tic complex.
Focusing on group I, one of the questions to be answered
is whether or not all members of this group are Tic components. Although they might share a common dehydrogenase activity at the N-terminus, the origin of the FNRbinding module at the C-terminus in vascular plants
remains unknown and different functions might be
expected among the different organisms. No similar
sequences to the C-terminus of psTic62 were found in the
databases with significant homology, which could indicate that either the FNR-binding module was lost during
evolution and only kept in vascular plants, or (more probably) the FNR-binding module was recently acquired by
vascular plants. The high similarity of the NADP-binding
domain of the Physcomitrella sequence in group I with
psTic62 (68% identity) suggests that the short version of

Tic62 in Physcomitrella, together with Tic110/Tic55/Tic40/
Tic32/Tic22/Tic20 [32], might be a constituent of the Tic
complex. The same might be true for Cyanidioschyzon
merolae. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that the
concurrence of both N-t and C-t domains, or even the
FNR-binding domain alone, were compulsory to settle a
protein as a Tic component. Further studies are necessary
to establish the mode of interaction of Tic62 with the Tic
complex in vascular plants and to elucidate the localization and function of members of group I in non-vascular
plants.
Still the question remains of the presence and function of
FNR at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts. In
chloroplasts, this protein is found either soluble in the
stroma in a non-functional state or attached to the thylakoids, where the protein is involved in the last stage of the
electron transport process in photosynthesis. FNR is a
ubiquitous flavoenzyme whose function is not exclusively
confined to photosynthesis [33] and, recently, the protein
has also been found to be localized at the inner envelope
membrane of chloroplasts [12]. When attached to the thylakoids, a reductase-binding protein (BP) mediates the
binding to the membrane [34]. In line with this, one possibility could be that FNR is attached to the inner envelope membrane via the FNR-binding motif of Tic62. This
interaction in vascular plants could be affected by the
activity of Tic62 that could specifically regulate the–yet
unknown–functional state of FNR in the inner envelope
membrane of chloroplasts. The opposite effect cannot be
excluded, and the binding of FNR could regulate the activity of Tic62, and therefore the transport machinery. This
regulation upon binding could depend on the redox state
of chloroplasts and might involve NADP(H)/NAD(H) or
a low potential electron donor and another substrate not
yet identified [33]. On the other hand, a possible electron
transfer process between FNR and Tic62 cannot be
excluded although the capacity of Tic62 as electron acceptor/donor has not yet been proven. It is likely that the
FNR-binding domain is important for some kind of metabolic regulation just in vascular plants, which needs further studies.

Conclusion
The reported results show that the N-terminal module of
Tic62 (NAD(P)-binding domain) is highly conserved
among all oxyphototrophs. The Tic62-NAD(P)-related
sequences are of ancient origin, since the protein was not
only found in cyanobacteria but also in green-sulfur bacteria. This protein family would belong to the extended
family of short-chain dehydrogenases-reductases and
likely contains the structurally conserved Rossman fold.
On the other hand, the C-terminal module in Tic62 (FNRbinding domain) is only found in vascular plants. This
domain is enriched in proline amino acids and it would

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/43

be important for protein-protein interactions that might
regulate the function of Tic62 protein. Tic62 proteins in
vascular plants would be attached to the inner envelope
membrane of chloroplasts, without spanning it, exposing
both C-terminal and N-terminal domains to the stroma.
Further studies are necessary to establish the mode of
interaction of Tic62 with the Tic complex in vascular
plants and to elucidate the localization and function of
related members in non-vascular plants

Methods
A sequence homology search (tblastn/blastp) was performed using the Tic62 protein sequence from pea
(psTic62) as a template (e-value < 10-9). The following
biological databases were considered: the non-redundant
GenBank database (nr) [35]; the public available Physcomitrella patens EST database, PhyscoDB [36]; the
genomic database containing the so far sequenced Physcomitrella patens genome (access due to collaboration with
Prof. Ralf Reski, University of Freiburg); the annotated
genome of the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae [37]; the
annotated genome of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, ChlamyDB [38]; the genome database for plants,
plantGDB [39]. Also the following databases were considered: the red algae Porphyra yezoensis [40] and Galdieria sulphuraria [41] databases; the chlorophyta Ostreococcus
lucimarinus database [42]; the EST GenBank database
(dbEST) [35]. All the retrieved sequences were aligned
with the ClustalX program [43], visually inspected and
manually corrected. The prediction of the subcellular
localization of the proteins was performed with TargetP
[44], ChloroP [45] and Predotar [46] programmes.
ProtTest v1.3 [47] was used to estimate the best model of
amino acid evolution for phylogeny. The WAG+I+Γ
model was chosen using either AIC or BIC as statistical
frameworks. Phylogenetic trees were generated on the
basis of the maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
analysis using PhyML v2.4.4 [48] and MrBayes v3.1.2 [49]
programmes. For ML analysis, four Gamma-distributed
sites were considered, and the parameters were estimated
from the data. Non-parametric bootstrap values were calculated for ML analyses (100 replicates) to assess the significance of the resulting tree. Bayesian analysis was
performed under the same model. Four chains were run
for one million generations with sampling every 100 generations. Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated
from the majority rule consensus of the tree sampled after
the initial burn-in period corresponding to 2,500 generations. Four-cluster likelihood-mapping [50] implemented
in Tree-puzzle v5.2 [51] was performed with 10,000 randomly chosen quartets.
A 3D model for all non-hydrogen atoms was obtained for
the N-terminal domain of the mature Tic62 from Arabi-
