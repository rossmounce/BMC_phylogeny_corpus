Does body posture influence hand preference
in an ancestral primate model?

Abstract
Background: The origin of human handedness and its evolution in primates is presently under debate. Current
hypotheses suggest that body posture (postural origin hypothesis and bipedalism hypothesis) have an important
impact on the evolution of handedness in primates. To gain insight into the origin of manual lateralization in
primates, we studied gray mouse lemurs, suggested to represent the most ancestral primate condition. First, we
investigated hand preference in a simple food grasping task to explore the importance of hand usage in a natural
foraging situation. Second, we explored the influence of body posture by applying a forced food grasping task
with varying postural demands (sit, biped, cling, triped).
Results: The tested mouse lemur population did not prefer to use their hands alone to grasp for food items.
Instead, they preferred to pick them up using a mouth-hand combination or the mouth alone. If mouth usage was
inhibited, they showed an individual but no population level handedness for all four postural forced food grasping
tasks. Additionally, we found no influence of body posture on hand preference in gray mouse lemurs.
Conclusion: Our results do not support the current theories of primate handedness. Rather, they propose that
ecological adaptation indicated by postural habit and body size of a given species has an important impact on
hand preference in primates. Our findings suggest that small-bodied, quadrupedal primates, adapted to the fine
branch niche of dense forests, prefer mouth retrieval of food and are less manually lateralized than large-bodied
species which consume food in a more upright, and less stable body posture.

Background
In humans it is believed that handedness is related to
brain lateralization of language and other cognitive functions. Therefore, handedness has become a major interest in evolutionary research. Approximately 90% of the
human population are right-handed independent of culture [1,2]. Fossil records and recent findings in great
apes indicate that right-handedness evolved early in
human evolution [2,3]. However, to date, the evolution
of primate handedness, and thus, the origin of human
handedness, is still unclear. Recent studies of handedness in primates revealed that hand preference is influenced by a number of different factors including body
posture, sex, age, task difficulty, task complexity and
experience [4,5], making it difficult to reconstruct its
evolution.

To date, there are two major hypotheses related to the
influence of body posture. First, the postural origin
hypothesis by MacNeilage et al. [6] proposes that primate handedness patterns evolved with structural and
functional adaptations for feeding. As a first step in primate evolution, left-hand preference evolved for visually
guided reaching (unimanual predation), whereas the
right hand was used for postural support. This holds
especially true for arboreal prosimians and is supported
by the fact that most prosimian species exhibit a lefthand preference at population level [7]. As a second
step, with evolution of a more terrestrial life style, the
right hand was no longer necessary for postural support
and became specialized for object manipulation and
bimanual coordination in higher primates. Second, the
bipedalism theory proposes that the shift from a stable
quadrupedal to an unstable bipedal posture necessitated
higher balance control which is reflected in an increased
cerebral lateralization [8,9]. Thus, primates should show

a higher degree of manual lateralization in a bipedal
position than in a quadrupedal one.
In this study we will test the two hypotheses by investigating the effect of different body postures on hand
preference in an ancestral primate model while controlling for the level of difficulty. Several experimental studies have investigated the effect of posture on hand
preference during reaching in other non-human primates; food items were placed at different heights relative to the cage floor to obtain specific body postures.
However, most of these studies focused on the comparison of quadrupedal versus bipedal postures (e.g. [9-16]).
Ape studies showed a shift to a greater use of the
right hand in bipedal versus quadrupedal reaching for
chimpanzees, orang-utans and gorillas [13,14], whereas
the results from bonobos are contradictory. Hopkins
and colleagues [13] found that bonobos also showed a
stronger right-hand preference in bipedal than in quadrupedal postures, whereas Vleeschouwer and colleagues
[11] found an increase in left-hand preference when the
animals shifted from a seated to a bipedal via a quadrupedal posture. In a recent study Braccini and collegues
[15] used a unimanual tool-use task (subject had to
remove peanut butter out of a tube with a stick) to test
hand preference in three experimentally induced postures (seated, bipedal supported and unsupported). The
strength of hand preference increased from seated to
bipedal posture but the direction of hand preference
was not affected. In gibbons left-handedness has been
found in bipedal tasks, whereas no population level
handedness has been found for quadrupedal tasks [14].
In Old World monkeys a shift towards right-handedness with increasing upright body posture was reported
for rhesus macaques (bipedal versus quadrupedal: [9])
and Gray-cheeked mangabies (sat versus biped and
clung: [17]). Further, Campbell’s monkeys showed significant differences in the strength, but not the direction,
of hand preference between different postural tasks [18].
The strength was weaker for the triped (= quadrupedal)
task than for the biped, clung and sat tasks.
In New World monkeys a shift to right-hand preference in bipedal versus quadrupedal reaching tasks has
been noted for tufted capuchins [12,19,20]. In contrast,
in squirrel monkeys, King & Landau [16] observed a
trend to left-handedness for bipedal versus quadrupedal
reaching and a trend to right-handedness for vertical
clinging. For Callitrichinae no influence of body posture
on the direction of hand preference has been observed
[21-23]. An increase of the strength of laterality from
stable horizontal to unstable bipedal or clinging posture
has been reported for tufted capuchins [12], squirrel
monkeys [21,24] cotton-top tamarins [21] and common
marmosets [23,25,26].

For prosimians, a shift to left-hand preference and an
increase in the strength of hand preference for bimanual
versus quadrupedal tasks has been observed in Senegal
bushbabies [8,27]. Additionally, ruffed lemurs show a
shift to left hand preference for tasks of extreme postural adjustment versus free foraging tasks [28]. In contrast, no effects of postural adjustment on the strength
and direction of hand preference were found in
Garnett’s bush babies [29], South African lesser bushbabies and gray mouse lemurs [10].
All in all, primates show a tendency towards increasing the strength of hand preference from a stable reaching position (quadrupedal, sit) to an unstable reaching
position (bipedal, cling). Results for the direction of
hand preference are not so clear but indicate an evolutionary trend from left-handedness in prosimians to
right-handedness in great apes.
In this study we investigated hand preference of an
ancestral primate model, the gray mouse lemur [30]. The
mouse lemur is a suitable model for evolutionary
research because its phylogenetic position in Primates
provides the first insight into the evolutionary roots of
primate manual lateralization. In addition, its lissencephalic brain organization compared to anthropoid primates, makes it a useful model for neurobiological
research [31]. The gray mouse lemur is a small-bodied,
quadrupedal, arboreal, nocturnal primate species living in
the fine branch niche of the Malagasy forests [30]. First,
we investigated hand preference in a simple food grasping task (SGT), representing the natural foraging environment, to estimate the importance of hand usage
during natural foraging based on a large sample size. In a
previous study it was shown that gray mouse lemurs
seem to prefer to use their mouths to pick up raisins, but
this was based on a small sample size (N = 8; [32,33]).
Second, we compared hand preference for the first time
in prosimians using four forced food grasping tasks
(FGT) which varied in their postural demands/postural
stability (FGT-sit, FGT-biped, FGT-cling, FGT-triped). In
the FGT tasks a subject has to retrieve mealworms out of
a box reaching one hand through a grid which prevents
usage of the mouth. To date, handedness data for mouse
lemurs have only been available for a seated posture
[10,34,35] and for a small sample size for the biped posture (N = 8, [10]) indicating individual but no population
level handedness. Therefore, we tested hand preference
for the first time for the cling and triped postures and for
a large sample size for the biped posture. Third, we investigated whether the different postural demands vary in
their level of difficulty and whether this fact affects
the hand preference of gray mouse lemurs. Since the
assumed difficulty of the task itself, as perceived by
the human experimenter, may not match the difficulty

Scheumann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/52

experienced by the species tested [36], we used the percentage of successful hand grasps (= success rate) as an
objective measurement of the level of difficulty.
All in all, we investigated the following three questions: First, do mouse lemurs prefer to use their hands
to catch mealworms in a natural foraging situation? Second, does body posture have an influence on the direction and strength of hand preference? Third, does the
level of difficulty of the postural demand tasks have an
influence on the direction and strength of hand
preference?

Methods
Subjects

We tested 56 gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus,
24 males, 32 females) of our breeding colony, housed in
the animal facility of the Institute of Zoology, University
of Veterinary Medicine Hannover (for details on housing conditions see [37]). All subjects had been born in
captivity. Their ages ranged from 7 months to 9 years.
The experiments were licensed by the Bezirksregierung
Hannover, Germany (reference number: 509c-42502-03/
660) and complied with the Animal Care guidelines and
the applicable national law.
Experimental set-up

Each mouse lemur was tested alone in a test cage
[Ebecco stainless steel cage for marmosets, 80 cm × 87
cm × 50 cm] in a separate testing room. The cage was
equipped with two wooden bars and a nest box. For the
simple food grasping task (SGT) a food bowl (diameter:
10 cm) was placed into the test cage. For the forced
food grasping tasks (FGT) either a transparent box with
a small opening (1x4 cm) was attached to the outside of
the cage (FGT-sit, FGT-biped, FGT-cling) or a plastic

Page 3 of 10

box was placed below the grid ground (FGT-triped;
Figure 1). This prevented the animals from using their
mouth so that they were forced to grab with one hand
through the small openings between the bars. The subjects’ behavior was videotaped using a digital camcorder
[Sony DR-TRV 22E PAL or SONY Camcorder DCRSR75E, Nightshot]. The camera was connected to a
monitor outside the testing room where the experimenter sat and observed the subjects.
General Procedure

Each session was conducted at the beginning of the
activity period for each subject.
For each session a subject was removed from its home
cage, placed in a new nest box attached to the test cage
in the testing room. For each session 10 mobile (SGT)
or immobile mealworms (FGT) were placed in the food
bowl (SGT) or plastic box (FGT). Each subject was
tested for 15 minutes or until the subject had eaten all
food items. A session started as soon as the door to the
testing room had been closed to rule out any influence
of the experimenter. An experimental task consisted of
three sessions on three separate days. Thus, a subject
needed a minimum of three days (= three sessions) to
complete one experimental task. In cases where the subject retrieved less than 9 mealworms per session a
fourth session was conducted to increase the number of
grasping events.
Experimental tasks
Simple food grasping task (SGT)

In the SGT task, we collected data for familiar actions
belonging to the natural repertoire of the subjects. For
each session we scattered 10 living mealworms on the
bottom of a food bowl and the subjects were allowed to

Figure 1 Experimental set-up for the four postural tasks (FGT-sit, FGT-biped, FGT-cling and FGT-triped). A plastic shield was used to
standardize the position of the subject in front of the transparent box for the FGT-sit, FGT- biped and FGT-cling task.

pick up the food items either with their hands or with
their mouth or with a combination of both. This task
was performed by 37 gray mouse lemurs (15 males,
22 females; see Additional file 1: Movie SGT).
Forced food grasping tasks with variation in postural
demands (FGT)

To test for the effect of postural demands we conducted
four forced food grasping tasks: FGT-sit, FGT-biped,
FGT-cling, FGT-triped. In the FGT a subject had to use
one of its hands to grab immobile mealworms (mealworms had to be immobilized to prevent them from
crawling out of the transparent box) through a grid
(grid size: 1 × 1 cm) and a small opening (1 × 4 cm) in
a transparent box (FGT-sit, FGT-biped, FGT-cling), or
through a grid into a plastic box below the ground
(FGT-triped; Figure 1; see Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5:
Movie FGT-sit, Movie FGT-biped, Movie FGT-cling,
Movie FGT-triped). The grid prevented the animals
from using their mouth, forcing them to grab with one
hand inside it. To induce different postural demands the
transparent box was fixed at different heights to the
wooden bar/floor (Figure 1).
For the FGT-sit task the opening of the transparent
box was fixed at a distance of 1.5 cm from the wooden
bar. The subject could sit on its hind legs while manipulating the food items with both hands. This task was
performed by 54 gray mouse lemurs (23 males, 31
females; see Additional file 2: Movie FGT-sit). For this
task we included data from 44 subjects already published by Scheumann and Zimmermann [34] and Leliveld et al. [35] to increase the sample size. From these
data we included the first three sessions to keep the
number of sessions comparable throughout the study.
The 10 new subjects were born or available after the
previous two studies had finished.
For the FGT-biped task the opening of the transparent
box was fixed at a distance of 6.3 cm from the wooden
bar. The subject had to stand on its hind legs and
stretch its body while manipulating the food items with
both hands. This task was performed by 31 gray mouse
lemurs (13 males, 18 females; see Additional file 3:
Movie FGT-biped).
For the FGT-cling task the opening of the transparent
box was fixed on the grid of the cage. The transparent
box was positioned in such a way to prevent the subject
from coming into contact with the ground while taking
the food items. The subject had to cling onto the grid
while manipulating the food items. This task was performed by 31 gray mouse lemurs (13 males, 18 females;
see Additional file 4: Movie FGT-cling).
For the FGT-triped task, a plastic box was fixed below
the grid. Thus, when the subject picked up a food item,
both feet and one hand touched the ground while the
other hand grasped the mealworm. This task was

Page 4 of 10

performed by 29 gray mouse lemurs (12 males, 17
males; see Additional file 5: Movie FGT-triped).
For task comparison 27 gray mouse lemurs (11 males,
16 females) were used which performed all four postural
tasks.
Data and video analysis

When the experimental tasks had been videotaped using
the Sony DR-TRV 22E PAL, we digitized all videotapes
using InterVideo WinDVD creator 2. When experimental tasks had been recorded using Sony DCR-SR75E, the
existing digital files were transferred to an external hard
disk. We conducted a frame-by-frame analysis (25
frames/second) in Interact 3.1. (Mangold International
GmbH).
For the SGT task, we recorded whether the subject
used its mouth alone, its hand alone or a combination of
both. Mouth alone was defined as occurring when the
subject picked up the mealworm without using its hands.
The hands were either on the edge of the bowl or on the
bottom with no contact to the food item. Hand alone
was defined as occurring when the subject picked up the
mealworm without using its mouth. That means the subjects transferred the food item to the mouth after the
item was no longer in contact with the ground. A combination of hand and mouth was coded if the two other
behaviors were excluded, meaning subjects made a whole
body movement and lunged at the food item with mouth
and hands simultaneously. For the FGT tasks, we
recorded the hand (right or left) the subject used to
retrieve mealworms from the transparent box.
To measure the hand spontaneously chosen for a specific task (= hand preference), we analyzed the first grasp of
each grasping bout. A grasping bout started with the first
grasp of the subject and ended when it successfully
retrieved a mealworm. A hand was considered to be successful when it had picked up one or more mealworms
out of the box. A maximum of 10 grasping bouts (= 10
mealworms) could be analyzed per session. If the mouse
lemur retrieved one or more mealworms out of the box
successfully, it ate them before starting a new grasp.
Therefore, the first grasps of each grasping bouts can be
considered as independent from each other.
Statistical analysis

We calculated the handedness index (HI) for each subject according to the formula HI = (number right number left)/(number right + number left) [38]. The
outcome of this formula can range from -1 to 1, with
positive values reflecting right-hand bias and negative
values reflecting left-hand bias. We additionally used the
absolute HI (ABS-HI) value of each subject to compare
the strength of the lateralization irrespective of
direction.

Scheumann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:52

We tested whether subjects used one hand more often
than expected by chance using the Binominal test with
50% chance level. We defined animals as left- or righthanders or ambiguous: right-handers - subjects used
the right hand significantly more often than expected
by chance (positive handedness index), left-handers subjects used the left hand significantly more often than
expected by chance (negative handedness index), ambiguous - subjects did not use one hand significantly more
often than expected by chance.
According to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, our data
differed significantly from a normal distribution. For this
reason, we used nonparametric tests (two-tailed). To
explore whether a significant majority of the population
was lateralized, we used a Chi-Square test with the
number of left, right, and ambiguously handed individuals to test if this distribution differed significantly
from chance (25:25:50, [39]). To test if the population
showed a lateralization towards the right or the left
hand, a Binomial test was conducted to test whether significantly more subjects used the right hand than
expected by chance (50:50). Additionally, we performed
a one-sample t-test on the HI score to investigate handedness at population level as is commonly done in the
literature [4].
To explore sex differences we compared the HI and
ABS-HI of males and females using the Mann-WhitneyU test. To explore age effects we correlated the HI and
ABS-HI with the age of the subjects using a Spearman
correlation.
To investigate the effect of postural demands we compared the HI and ABS-HI between the four postural
tasks using the Friedman test. Further, we compared the
number of lateralized subjects between the four postural
tasks using the Cochran’s Q test. We used the Spearman
correlation to examine the relationship between the HI
and ABS-HI for the four postural tasks.
To evaluate the level of difficulty of the postural
demand tasks we calculated the percentage of successful
hand grasps by dividing the number of successful hand
grasps by the total number of hand grasps (= success
rate). A success rate of 100% means that the subject was
successful in all grasps. A success rate of 50% means
that the subject successfully retrieved a mealworm in
only half of all grasps.
All statistical tests were calculated using SPSS 17. We
considered a result significant if p ≤ 0.05.

4.4%; Friedman-test: c 2 = 60.33, df = 2, N = 37, p <
0.001, Figure 2). They used a hand-mouth combination
significantly more often than the mouth or hand alone
to grasp a mealworm (Wilcoxon-test: hand-mouth versus mouth alone: T = 11.25, n = 37, p < 0.001; handmouth versus hand alone: T = 0, n = 37, p < 0.001).
Further, they used the mouth significantly more than
the hand alone (Wilcoxon-test: mouth alone versus
hand alone: T = 5, n = 35, p < 0.001). Due to the limited sample size of grasping acts using one hand alone,
it was not possible to analyze the HI or ABS-HI for this
task. There were no significant differences in the usage
of the three grasping categories between sexes (MannWhitney-U≥116, Nm = 15, Nf = 22, p ≥ 0.129) and there
was also no correlation between age and the three
grasping categories (Spearman correlation: rs ≤ |0.188|,
N = 37, p ≥ 0.264).
Postural tasks

In the FGT-sit task, 42 of the subjects (N = 54; 77.8%;
Table 1) showed an individual hand preference by using
one hand significantly more often than the other
(Binominal test: p ≤ 0.05): 24 subjects were right-handed
and 18 subjects were left-handed. The number of lateralized subjects was significantly higher than expected by
chance (Chi-Square = 18, df = 2, N = 54, p < 0.001).
However, no population level hand preference was
found since the number of left- and right-handed subjects was not significantly different from chance (Binomial test: p = 0.441). Also, a one-sample t-test indicated
that the mean HI sit score per subject (meansit = 0.07,
SD = 0.78) did not differ significantly from chance level
(one-sample t-test: t = 0.694, df = 53, p = 0.491). There
was no significant difference in the HIsit and ABS-HIsit
between the sexes (Mann-Whitney-U≥323.5, Nm = 23,
Nf = 31, p ≥ 0.557) and also no correlation between age

|0.299|, N = 54, p ≥ 0.096).
In the FGT-biped task, 28 of the subjects (N = 31;
90.3%; Table 1) showed an individual hand preference by
using one hand significantly more often than the other
(Binominal test: p ≤ 0.05): 15 subjects were right-handed
and 13 subjects were left-handed. The number of lateralized subjects was significantly higher than expected by
chance (Chi-Square = 20.4, df = 2, N = 31, p < 0.001).
However, no population level hand preference was found
since the number of left- and right-handed subjects was
not different from chance (Binomial test: p = 0.851).
Also, a one-sample t-test indicated that the mean HIbiped
score per subject (meanbiped = -0.02, SD = 0.86) did not
differ significantly from chance (one-sample t-test: t =
-0.101, df = 30, p = 0.920). There was no significant difference in the HIbiped and ABS-HIbiped between the sexes
(Mann-Whitney-U≥76, Nm = 13, Nf = 18 p = 0.093) and
also no significant correlation between age and HIbiped
(Spearman correlation: rs = 0.141, N = 31, p = 0.449). In
contrast, there was a correlation between age and ABSHIbiped (Spearman correlation: rs = -0.408, N = 31, p =
0.023).
In the FGT-cling task, 25 of the subjects (N = 31;
80.7%; Table 1) showed an individual hand preference
by using one hand significantly more often than the
other (Binominal test: p ≤ 0.05): 9 subjects were righthanded and 16 subjects were left-handed. The number
of lateralized subjects was significantly higher than
expected by chance (Chi-Square = 14.81, df = 2, N = 31,
p ≤ 0.001). However, no population level hand preference was found since the number of left- and righthanded subjects was not different from chance (Binomial test: p = 0.230). Also, a one-sample t-test indicated
that the mean HI cling score per subject (mean cling =
-0.16, SD = 0.83) did not differ significantly from chance
(one-sample t-test: t = -1.062, df = 30, p = 0.297). There

was no significant difference in the HI cling and ABSHIcling between the sexes (Mann-Whitney-U≥79, Nm =
13, Nf = 18, p ≥ 0.110) and also no correlation between
age and HIcling and ABS-HIcling (Spearman correlation:
rs ≤ |0.171|, N = 31, p ≥ 0.357).
In the FGT-triped task, 24 of the subjects (N = 29;
82.8%; Table 1) showed an individual hand preference
by using one hand significantly more often than the
other (Binominal test: p ≤ 0.05): 8 subjects were righthanded and 16 subjects were left-handed. The number
of lateralized subjects was significantly higher than
expected by chance (Chi-Square = 16.9, df = 2, N = 29,
p < 0.001). However, no population level hand preference was found since the number of left- and righthanded subjects was not different from chance (Binomial test: p = 0.152). Also, a one-sample t-test indicated
that the mean HI triped score per subject (meantriped =
-0.21, SD = 0.74) did not differ significantly from chance
(t = -1.559, df = 28, p = 0.130). There was no significant
difference in the HItriped and ABS-HItriped between the
sexes (Mann-Whitney-U≥72, N m = 12, N f = 17, p ≥
0.183) and also no correlation between age and HItriped
and ABS-HItriped (Spearman correlation: rs ≤ |0.234|, N
= 29, p ≥ 0.220).
Comparison of postural tasks

We compared the HI and ABS-HI between the four postural tasks for the 27 subjects that participateding in all
four tasks, but found no significant differences (Friedmantest: c2≤5.6, df = 3, N = 27, p ≥ 0.133, Figure 3a). Also, the
number of lateralized versus non-lateralized subjects did
not differ significantly between the four postural tasks
(Cochran’s Q = 2.0, df = 3. N = 27, p = 0.572) suggesting
that posture did not influence the direction and strength
of hand preference.
Comparing the direction of hand preference 17 of 27
subjects showed a consistent hand preference for all

four postural tasks (10 left-handed; 7 right-handed; see
Additional file 6: Table HI). Only two subjects switched
the direction of hand preference from one task to
another task. Eight subjects showed a consistent hand
preference for at least two tasks and were ambiguous
for the remaining tasks (see Additional file 6: Table HI).
The HIs of the four postural tasks showed a significant strong positive correlation with one another (Spearman correlation: r s ≥ 0.786, N = 27, p < 0.001). The
analysis of the ABS-HI indicated significant positive correlations between biped and cling (Spearman correlation: rs = 0.678, N = 27, p < 0.001).
Level of difficulty of the postural tasks

To measure the level of difficulty of the postural tasks we
used the percentage of successful hand grasps (= success
rate). The success rate differed significantly between
tasks (Friedman-test: c 2 = 45.15, df = 3, N = 27, p <
0.001, Figure 3b). Pair wise comparisons showed that the
FGT-triped was significantly more difficult for the subjects than the other three postural tasks (Wilcoxon-test:
T ≤8.8, n = 27, p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Further,
the FGT-sit task was significantly more difficult than the
FGT-biped and FGT-cling task (Wilcoxon-test: sit versus
biped: T = 11.86, n = 26, p = 0.019; sit versus cling T =
8.4, n = 27, p < 0.001), whereas there was no significant
difference between the FGT-biped and FGT-cling task
(Wilcoxon-test: T = 13.22, n = 26, p = 0.151).

Discussion
We found that in the simple food grasping task (SGT)
mouse lemurs prefer to use combinations of mouth and
hand or the mouth alone to pick up mealworms over
using one hand alone. Nevertheless, if the use of the
mouth was prevented, mouse lemurs showed individual
hand preference, but no population level hand preference in all four postural tasks. We found no significant
differences in the direction and strength of hand preference between the four postural tasks. The majority of
subjects showed consistent hand preference in all postural tasks. Further, we found significant positive correlations for the direction of hand preference between the
postural tasks. Although hand preference did not differ
between the postural tasks, we found differences in their
level of difficulty, suggesting the following order: triped
> sit > cling = biped.
In the simple food grasping task, reflecting the natural
foraging environment, mouse lemurs prefer to use the
mouth in combination with the hands. Mouse lemurs
catch the mealworms with rapid strikes by stretching
out both hands to hold the mealworm and to pick it up
with the mouth. This finding agrees with previous findings in gray mouse lemurs, based on a smaller sample
size [32,33]. The preferred use of the mouth was also
shown in other primate species such as the dwarf
lemurs [32,33], greater galagos [32,33], marmosets [22]
and sifakas [40], whereas lesser galagos [32,33] and apes
[41] preferred to use a single hand to reach for food.
There are two potential explanations. First, differences
in grasping abilities based on anatomical differences
could be related to the usage of the mouth. Lemelin &
Jungers [42] found an inverse relationship between hand
morphology, reflecting different degrees of prehensility,
and body size. As body size increases there is a decrease
in phalangeal indices which probably results in different
grasping abilities. Microcebus murinus is characterized
by hands with longer fingers relative to the palm compared to larger, more frugivorous prosimians. Further,
while catching insects, small-bodied mouse lemurs have
to catch moving insects that are too large to handle
with only one hand. Therefore, the combined use of
mouth and hand makes them more successful in foraging. This is also supported by the high success rate of
98% in the SGT task compared to a low success rate
ranging from 37.5 to 60.9% in the FGT task where
mouth usage was prevented. Rogers [36] suggested that
the whole-hand snatch-grasping by prosimians did not
differ from the usage of paws by non-primate mammals.
She suggested that internal control for fine motoric
function only evolved in some primates. Further, Hopkins and colleagues [43,44] argued that the use of different grasping techniques due to anatomical differences

Scheumann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/52

between species, is an important factor in determining
hand preference. Second, the preferred usage of the
mouth could be affected by different feeding strategies.
Mouse lemurs feed not only on fruits and insects but
also on gum [45-47]. Gum feeding is especially prominent in the dry season. Mouse lemurs use their teeth to
scratch tree bark and lick the gum, a process which
does not require hand usage [46]. This is in agreement
with findings of Singer & Schwibbe [22]. They observed
that Callithrix, which feed on exudates, showed a strong
preference for the mouth to pick up food items. In contrast, lion tamarins, which are specialized in using
manipulation and extracting insects showed a preference
for hand usage in the same study.
Our findings of manual lateralization at an individual,
but not at a population level in mouse lemurs are in
agreement with previous findings for the FGT-sit
[10,34,35] and biped task [10] and are new for the triped
and cling task. Further, we did not find any influence of
body posture on the direction or strength of hand preference in gray mouse lemurs, supporting previous findings
in mouse lemurs for the comparison of the sit versus
biped task, based on a small sample size [10]. The postural origin theory [6] was not supported by our results.
This hypothesis is based on the assumption, that one
hand (the right- hand) is needed for postural support,
whereas the other hand (the left hand) is used for reaching. However, in the FGT-cling task, mouse lemurs were
also able to support their posture only with their feet,
whereas both hands were free and equally available for
food reaching. This could explain why mouse lemurs do
not establish a population bias or an increase in the
strength of hand preference for the FGT-cling task. In
addition, our results are not in agreement with the bipedalism theory which proposed an increase in the strength
of hand preference from a stable (FGT-sit, FGT-triped)
to an unstable posture (FGT-biped) [8,9]. We have to
mention that in the bipedal task subjects were not free
standing but showed postural support with one hand
while the other was picking up the food item. Therefore,
it could be argued that in a free-standing bipedal posture
the strength of hand preference could be increased.
Further, the results of the bipedal task could be affected
by the proportion of activities subjects spent in a bipedal
posture. Since mouse lemurs naturally spend less time in
bipedal postures it could be argued that manual laterality
is less influenced by this posture. However, the lack of
postural influence on hand preference was also observed
in Callitrichinae [22]. It could be assumed that in species
where posture has an influence on hand preferenc this
relies on different levels of difficulty induced by these
postures [36].
Although the grasping behaviour itself was similar
across all unimanual tasks, i.e. simple reaching for a

Page 8 of 10

food item during all postural tasks, we found significant
differences in the success rates between the tasks, indicating that body postures differ in their level of difficulty. However, the level of difficulty did not affect the
direction and strength of hand preferences. It was surprising that the triped task, which was similar to the
quadrupedal task in other studies, was the most difficult
task for the subjects. However, this could be explained
by methodological reasons rather than by body posture
alone. Since subjects did not use the hand to pick up
mealworms in a simple food grasping task that would
be equivalent to the quadrupedal task in other species,
we were forced to develop an apparatus which forced
the subjects to use their hands. In the FGT-sit, FGTbiped and FGT-cling task the box was placed in front of
the subjects, forcing them to use a horizontal movement
to pick up the mealworm. In the FGT-triped task the
box was placed below the subjects, forcing them to use
a vertical movement. Since it is assumed that mouse
lemurs lack fine motoric control of their hands, the different movement axis could result in different success
rates. The result that the sit task was more difficult than
the biped or cling task could be explained by the fact
that this was the first task animals were confronted
with. However, Leliveld et al. [35] showed that task
experience did not influence the HI or ABS-HI in gray
mouse lemurs. Interestingly, they showed a 98% success
in the simple food grasping task which also stressed the
advantage of using the mouth-hand combination and
the lower importance of the hand.
We found no influence of sex on the direction and
strength of hand preference. Further, we can not support the theory that the usage of the mouth decreases
with age or that the strength of hand preference
increases with age. For the FGT-biped task the strength
of manual laterality decreased with age. A speculative
hypothesis could be that younger individuals show more
temperament (i.e. more hasty and less concentrated)
than older subjects which could result in a stronger
degree of laterality [35,36,48,49].
Further, it could be argued that using other measurements favors different results [50-52]. Therefore, we
recalculated our results using other often published measurements such as the Z-score or hand performance.
However, we obtained similar results using the Z-score
or the Binomial test in the decision whether a subject
was ambiguous, right- or left-handed (only one subject
changed from ambiguous to right-handed for the sit
task). Hand preference (i.e. the hand spontaneously chosen for a specific task) used in this study is the most
commonly used measure for manual lateralization, but
several authors suggested that successful hand preference
(i.e. the hand which is more successful in completing a
specific task) gives a better indication of motor

Scheumann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/52

lateralization (e.g., [50,51]) and is less affected by repetitive use [51]. Therefore, we also calculated successful
hand preference and total hand preference (i.e. total
number of grasping events). However, we obtained similar results and the three measurements showed strong
correlations (Spearman correlation: sit: rs ≥ 0.916, N =
54, p < 0.001; biped: rs ≥ 0.922, N = 31, p < 0.001; cling:
rs ≥ 0.881, N = 31, p < 0.001; triped: rs ≥ 0.886, N = 29, p
< 0.001).
All in all, mouse lemurs prefer mouth-hand combinations or the mouth to retrieve food in a natural foraging
situation. In contrast to other prosimians, they show a lesser degree of manual laterality since no population level
handedness was observed in any of the four postural tasks.
This supports the hypothesis that the role of the mouth is
a critical factor for the development of manual lateral bias
[53]. Ward et al. [32] showed that there is a negative correlation between the percentage of mouth use and the
strength of lateral bias which means that when primate
species use their mouths more, they show fewer hand preferences. Olson et al. [14] found that gibbons and gorillas
which moved more often bipedal than orang-utans
showed stronger hand preferences. They proposed that
the degree of bipedality a species exhibits in the natural
environment is related to the strength of hand preference
and to the occurrence of population level handedness.
Therefore, it can be assumed that ecological adaptation
indicated by postural habit has an important impact on
the development of manual laterality.

Conclusion
To conclude, this study shows that in a natural foraging
situation gray mouse lemurs prefer to use their mouths
or a hand-mouth combination. Nevertheless, in a foraging task where mouth usage was prevented they show
individual hand preferences, but no population level
hand preference independent of task-specific body
posture. Our results support the hypothesis that smallbodied, quadrupedal primates with a horizontal orientation to the trunk prefer mouth retrieval of food and are
less manually lateralized than large-bodied species
which consume food in a more upright, and less stable,
body posture. Therefore, we hypothesize that ecological
adaptation indicated by the postural habit and body size
shaped the evolution of manual laterality.
