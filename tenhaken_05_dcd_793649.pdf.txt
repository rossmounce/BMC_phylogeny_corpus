Abstract
Background: Recognition of microbial pathogens by plants triggers the hypersensitive reaction, a
common form of programmed cell death in plants. These dying cells generate signals that activate
the plant immune system and alarm the neighboring cells as well as the whole plant to activate
defense responses to limit the spread of the pathogen. The molecular mechanisms behind the
hypersensitive reaction are largely unknown except for the recognition process of pathogens. We
delineate the NRP-gene in soybean, which is specifically induced during this programmed cell death
and contains a novel protein domain, which is commonly found in different plant proteins.
Results: The sequence analysis of the protein, encoded by the NRP-gene from soybean, led to the
identification of a novel domain, which we named DCD, because it is found in plant proteins
involved in development and cell death. The domain is shared by several proteins in the Arabidopsis
and the rice genomes, which otherwise show a different protein architecture. Biological studies
indicate a role of these proteins in phytohormone response, embryo development and
programmed cell by pathogens or ozone.
Conclusion: It is tempting to speculate, that the DCD domain mediates signaling in plant
development and programmed cell death and could thus be used to identify interacting proteins to
gain further molecular insights into these processes.

Background
Plants can recognize microbial pathogens by a specific
interaction system, which was historically named the
gene-for-gene interaction, because particular matching
genes must be present in the pathogen as well as in the
plant. A successful recognition triggers a hypersensitive
reaction of individual plant cells, which is a form of programmed cell death in plants. Though a dead cell on its
own might already stop the growth of biotrophic pathogens more importantly the cell death program by itself
generates unknown signals for neighboring cells. Thereby

the plant immune system is activated locally in some cell
layer around the original infection to prepare the plant
cells for the next microbial attack. Often this signal from
the first infection spreads throughout the whole plant and
turns on a long lasting broad pathogen resistance called
the systemic acquired resistance. Despite the enormous
efforts to dissect the machinery for the hypersensitive
reaction many details are still unknown except for the
early recognition of the microbial molecules.

Often the programmed cell death in plants requires the
signaling compound salicylic acid downstream of the recognition process to proceed beyond restrictions points in
the cell death program [1]. A conclusive role for salicylic
acid has not been worked out but it is likely to function in
signal amplification [2,3] and transcriptional activation of
genes are very likely [4,5].
We have isolated a gene from soybean which is strongly
induced during the hypersensitive reaction and serves as a
marker for programmed cell death in this system [6]. The
gene is not directly responsive to salicylic acid but transcription can be amplified in the presence of this signal
molecule. The gene encodes a protein consisting of two
domains. The N-terminal domain is extremely rich in the
amino acid asparagine (~25%) and was therefore called
N-rich protein (NRP) [6]. The exact biological function of
the NRP-gene remains to be elucidated.
Here we describe the analysis of a protein domain found
in the soybean NRP-protein and other plant proteins associated with development. The biological processes associated with these proteins lead us to name this novel
domain DCD for their role in development and cell death.

Results and discussion
Sequence analysis revealed a significantly conserved
region, hence novel domain DCD. The DCD domain is an
approximately 130 amino acid long stretch that contains
several mostly invariable motifs (Fig. 1). These include a
FGLP and a LFL motif at the N-terminus and a PAQV and
a PLxE motif towards the C-terminus of the domain. Several amino acids are positionally conserved in all members with a DCD domain indicating a critical role of these
residues in structure and function (Fig. 1). In particular
three cysteines are almost generally (red asterisks in Fig 1)
or subfamily specifically (green asterisks in Fig. 1) conserved, which putatively possess a metal binding feature.
The predicted secondary structure is mostly composed of
beta strands and confined by an alpha-helix at the N- and
at the C-terminus. Using the metaserver 3D-Jury [7] no
similarities to any other known structural folds could be
assigned. The modular nature of the DCD domain is supported by the presence in several protein families with different domain architecture (Fig. 2). The DCD domain is
only found in plant proteins but absent from bacteria,
fungi and animals. The two fully sequenced plant
genomes from rice and Arabidopsis contain 11 and 7 members with a DCD domain, respectively. At least four subgroups of proteins can be identified by phylogenetic
comparison of the DCD domain each having members in
the rice and in the Arabidopsis genome (Fig. 2). A similar
picture emerges from the analysis of plant EST-sequences,
which also cluster to the different subgroups (data not
shown). The four subgroups differ in the architecture

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/169

where the DCD domain is located within the protein (Fig.
2). Whereas in subgroup I the DCD domain is found in
the C-terminus of the protein, it is found more towards
the middle of the protein in subgroup II. The third (III)
subgroup is more variable; the proteins are mostly characterized by a DCD domain at the N-terminus and in one
case it is found subsequent to a ParB domain. The fourth
(IV) subgroup shares a DCD domain at the N-terminus
but contains several KELCH repeats at the C-terminal part
of the protein.
Whereas the majority of DCD domains (families II, III. IV)
contain a second conserved cysteine, directly following
the N-terminal one, family I possess a putative functional
substitute in the "central loop" of the domain (Fig. 1,
green asterisks on the top of the alignment).
We could only identify the DCD domain in a variety of
plants, using PSI-BLAST. The domain seems to be present
in ESTs from dicots (e.g. Arabidopsis), monocots (e.g. rice),
gymnosperm trees (e.g. pine), ferns, and mosses (e.g.
Physcomitrella). The available sequences from algae are
very limited, but the recently sequenced diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana [8] contains a distant member of this
domain in a hypothetical protein (Fig. 2). At least the
DCD domain is present from early in plant evolution
before the separation of diatoms and green algae, leading
to higher plants, occurred about 1 billion years ago.
For three of the proteins with a DCD domain, all clustering into group I, some biological data have been published. These proteins include the B2-protein from carrot,
which was found to be strongly and early induced during
the developmental shift from undifferentiated cell cultures to somatic embryogenesis [9]. Though the exact
function of the protein still has to be elucidated a role in
developmental processes is supported by the finding from
Arabidopsis transcript profiling with microarrays. Here the
DCD containing protein At2g32910 is only weakly
expressed throughout the whole life cycle of Arabidopsis
except during embryogenic development. A similar pattern is observed for the gene At5g01660, which has several
KELCH repeats next to the DCD domain. This gene is
most abundantly expressed in embryos but also in the
meristem of the shoot apex.
A second protein with a DCD domain was identified by
[10] in pea. Here the so called Gda1 gene is strongly
expressed in peas during the vegetative phase but rapidly
disappears after shifting the plants into the reproductive
phase. The transition is mediated by a change of the light
period from short to long days. Interestingly the GDA1
gene can be rapidly induced by the phytohormone gibberellic acid, a key player in the developmental change
from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in plants.

mediates the signaling in these processes and could thus
be used to identify interacting proteins to gain further
molecular insights into these processes.

A third protein with a DCD domain was isolated by [6].
This protein was named N-rich protein (NRP) because of
the extreme high content of asparagine (~25%) in the Nterminal half in front of the DCD domain. The NRP-gene
is rapidly induced during programmed cell death in soybean, caused by inoculation with avirulent bacteria. Isogenic bacteria, lacking a single Avr-gene are not recognized
by soybean cells and neither trigger programmed cell
death nor the induction of the NRP gene. The gene is
induced early in the cell death program well before the
cells lose control of their membrane integrity. Using Phytophthora as a fungal pathogen to inoculate soybean
plants, the same response was found as with bacteria,
indicating that the NRP-gene is responding to the cell
death program rather than to specific molecules from a
particular pathogen. The putative Arabidopsis ortholog
(At5g42050) is induced by several stress conditions
including ozone, osmotic and cold stress as indicated by
publicly available transcript profiling data (Genevestigator: https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/). Ozone treatment leads to small lesions with cell death similar to a
hypersensitive reaction caused by avirulent pathogens. A
similar set of genes is activated by both inducers of programmed cell death.

Methods

The DCD domain is quite well conserved on the amino
acid level throughout the plant kingdom. The domain is
present in proteins with different architectures. Some of
these proteins contain additional recognizable motifs,
like the KELCH repeats or the ParB domain. The latter
domain has been attributed to the partitioning of plasmids and chromosomes in bacteria and has a nuclease
activity [11].
KELCH motifs are typically composed of ~50 amino acid
long stretches which form a beta sheet [12]. They occur as
5 to 7 repeats that form a beta propeller tertiary structure.
KELCH motifs are widespread and have been identified in
viruses, plants, fungi and mammals. Most of the characterized KELCH motifs are interfaces for protein protein
interaction, often by interaction with proteins from the
cytoskeleton [13].

Using the protein sequence of Glycine max (gi|57898928)
as query for a PSI-Blast search [14] after one iteration we
retrieve homologs in several plant families with high significance (E-value > = 8*e-30). A conserved region of ~130
amino acids could be identified and the borders of the
shared region were defined according to the PSI-BLAST
pairwise alignments. Further PSI-BLAST searches with this
region converge within the first iteration. A multiple
sequence alignment was build using T-coffee and refined
manually; additional HMM searches [15] with profiles
based on this alignment of non redundant representatives
support the findings.
Phylogenetically distant sequences of diatom (Thalassiosira pseudonana), fern (Ceratopteris richardii) and moss
(Physcomitrella patens) derive from searches against
genome database and EST database, respectively.
Two different methods, Phd/PROF_sec [16] and Psipred
[17], were used to predict the secondary structure.
A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the non
redundant alignment of 29 sequences (including fragments and one translation (O49932) that likely contains
a frameshift at the C-terminus) in MEGA [18], calculated
with the neighbor-joining algorithm. Similar topologies
were obtained using other methods e.g minimum evolution (data not shown) and bootstrap values were calculated to test significance. The domain architecture is
predicted and displayed by the Simple Modular Architecture

Conclusion
The occurrence of the conserved DCD domain in plant
proteins of variable length and different architecture, but
present throughout the plant kingdom, suggests a role in
protein-protein interaction. Transcription profiling
reveals that the genes encoding a DCD domain are upregulated during plant development and programmed cell
death. It is tempting to speculate, that the DCD domain
