Abstract
Background: Genomic research tools such as microarrays are proving to be important resources to study
the complex regulation of genes that respond to environmental perturbations. A first generation cDNA
microarray was developed for the environmental indicator species Daphnia pulex, to identify genes whose
regulation is modulated following exposure to the metal stressor cadmium. Our experiments revealed
interesting changes in gene transcription that suggest their biological roles and their potentially
toxicological features in responding to this important environmental contaminant.
Results: Our microarray identified genes reported in the literature to be regulated in response to cadmium
exposure, suggested functional attributes for genes that share no sequence similarity to proteins in the
public databases, and pointed to genes that are likely members of expanded gene families in the Daphnia
genome. Genes identified on the microarray also were associated with cadmium induced phenotypes and
population-level outcomes that we experimentally determined. A subset of genes regulated in response
to cadmium exposure was independently validated using quantitative-realtime (Q-RT)-PCR. These
microarray studies led to the discovery of three genes coding for the metal detoxication protein
metallothionein (MT). The gene structures and predicted translated sequences of D. pulex MTs clearly
place them in this gene family. Yet, they share little homology with previously characterized MTs.
Conclusion: The genomic information obtained from this study represents an important first step in
characterizing microarray patterns that may be diagnostic to specific environmental contaminants and give
insights into their toxicological mechanisms, while also providing a practical tool for evolutionary,
ecological, and toxicological functional gene discovery studies. Advances in Daphnia genomics will enable
the further development of this species as a model organism for the environmental sciences.

Background
Recent advances in genomics and bioinformatics are revolutionizing the process of discovering genes whose regulation has important consequences to the fitness of
individuals [1,2]. These resources for genetic investigations include functional genomic tools that compare the
expression profiles of thousands of genes under different
conditions. Microarrays are proving to be a particularly
important modern resource for identifying genes in context of their complex regulation [3]. Until recently, the
application of microarrays has largely focused on studies
from a select set of organisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio,
Mus musculus) that constitute some of the most well characterized laboratory models in the life sciences. While
these model organisms are well suited for developmental,
cellular and molecular studies – contributing a staggering
amount of biological knowledge – it is difficult to relate
environmental controls of gene regulation of these organisms (phenotype) to higher-level (population) responses
because so little is known about their ecology. This chasm
presents a challenge for toxicological genomic applications, especially those related to environmental toxicology where the goal is often to identify population and
ecosystem-level responses in the context of environment
change. Thus, the aim of discovering genes that are
expressed as a function of ambient conditions (therefore,
anchoring potential genetic biomarkers to biological/ecological functions) requires applying functional genomic
approaches to keystone species with accessible natural
populations and tractable ecologies, such as the ubiquitous aquatic micro-crustacean Daphnia pulex.
Commonly known as water fleas, Daphnia are familiar
and ubiquitous inhabitants of ponds and lakes throughout the globe and have been the focus of study by limnologists for well over a century [4-6]. As a dominant
member of the planktonic community, Daphnia play a
central role in aquatic food webs, serving as the primary
grazers of algae, bacteria and protozoans, and as the primary forage for fish. As a result, Daphnia are long recognized as a sentinel/indicator species in freshwater
ecosystems and they are routinely used to determine the
toxicity of aqueous solutions and to gauge the quality of
inland waters [7]. Therefore, the gross-level responses of
Daphnia to a number of environmental pollutants are well
characterized [8], and these responses are referenced by
environmental protection agencies (e.g., United States
Environmental Protection Agency, Environment Canada,
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) to define regulatory limits [9], monitor the quality
of industrial and municipal effluents [10,11] and estimate
the risk of environmental toxins on natural environments.
For these reasons, the present study extends the "roadmap" for applications of DNA microarrays to studies of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/477

non-model organisms described by Gracey et al. [12] and
later by others (reviewed in [13,14]), by characterizing the
response of this critical aquatic indicator species to environmental stress. These investigations utilize D. pulex; a
freshwater crustacean species that is ubiquitous throughout North America [15], sensitive to metals and metal
mixtures [16], and supported by a major genome
sequencing project [17]. They also complement recent
efforts by others to develop a microarray platform for D.
magna [18]; [19]; [20].
We focus our present investigations on cadmium as a
model environmental stressor, but the technologies
described are pertinent to a much wider range of ecological and toxicological applications. Cadmium is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant [21]. It ranks eighth on
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [22]
list of the top 50 priority pollutants, is one of the most
common contaminants found in the U.S. EPA Superfund
sites [23], and is highly toxic to aquatic life. Cadmium is
extremely persistent in the environment and, as a result,
bioaccumulates within food webs [24]. In aquatic animals, cadmium is a potent calcium antagonist that disrupts calcium uptake and homeostasis [25-27]. Cadmium
also induces oxidative stress, resulting in lipid peroxidation, damage to membranes, impaired cellular functions,
and tissue damage [28]. It is a Class B metal that has ten
outer shell electrons in the d orbital and is highly reactive,
tending to preferentially form covalent bonds with
S>N>P>O [29,30]. Thus, complexation with anions controls exposure in the water column [31] and ultimately
toxicity in the animal [32]. Within many organisms, the
major ligands for cadmium are small metal binding proteins known as metallothionein (MT) [32,33].
The metallothioneins are a family of unusual and highly
conserved small cytosolic proteins, characterized by their
low molecular weight (i.e., 6000–7000 Daltons), lack of
secondary structure in the absence of metal ligands,
absence of histidine or aromatic residues, and high
cysteine content (typically 30–33% of the protein). The
MTs principally bind metals from groups 1B and 2B of the
Periodic Table of Elements (e.g., cadmium, copper, mercury, silver, zinc; [34,35]), and in so doing form two
metal-binding domains. The metal binding properties of
MT are conferred by the large number, spacing and metal
coordination of the cysteine residues within the protein. It
is generally recognized that the physiological functions of
MT are to regulate the intra-cellular concentrations of
essential metals such as copper and zinc; to activate and
deactivate zinc-regulated proteins; and to scavenge free
radicals [35,36]. However, MT can also confer protection
from metal poisoning by binding certain free metal ions
or undergoing exchange reactions with metals bound to
other ligands [35,37]. The synthesis of MT is also regu-

lated by metals with MT mRNA expression increasing in
response to elevated metals in tissues [38,39]. Because of
its high specificity and sensitivity for metal induction, MT
levels have been successfully used to diagnose copper,
zinc, and cadmium exposures in numerous studies ranging from temperate freshwater environments to tropical
marine systems [40]. While MTs have been characterized
in several Malacostraca crustacean species [41], with the
exception of partial cDNA sequences of two MTs from D.
magna [19] there is little sequence information available
for these genes and their regulatory regions in the Branchiopoda, such as Daphnia.
We report a series of studies designed to test whether the
exposure to sub-lethal chemical stressors results in identifiable changes in gene expression, exposing genes that
respond to these conditions and providing a means of
identifying potential biomarkers of response to specific
exposures. Here, we developed a cDNA microarray platform for D. pulex to investigate differences in generesponse profiles for this aquatic indicator species following environmental perturbation by cadmium. Expression
profiling successfully aided in the discovery of genes regulated in response to cadmium exposure, including the
important metal biomarker, MT. Gene-response profiling
provided mechanistic information that related to the
observed cadmium-induced phenotypes and populationlevel responses. Finally, we identified and characterized
the primary structure of the D. pulex MT sequences in context of their genomic architecture, translated sequence and
phylogenetic relationship to other crustacean MTs.

Results
Daphnia response to cadmium
To define sub-lethal exposure concentrations and better
characterize cadmium-exposed phenotypes, preliminary
experiments were conducted to determine the sensitivity
of D. pulex to cadmium. For these studies, acute (48-h)
toxicity tests were used to define median lethal (LC50)
and sub-lethal (LC01) effects concentrations. Mortality in
the control groups was less than 10% for all tests. The
LC50 and LC01 values given as mean ± 95% confidence
intervals were 74.6 (64.2 – 84.4) and 20.3 (9.7 – 30.1) μg/
L, respectively. Demographic (i.e., life-table) experiments

that included longer-term exposures (21-d) to lower cadmium concentrations (1 to 2.5 μg Cd/L) were conducted
to better define sub-lethal cadmium responses. Observed
effects included a decline in individual fitness parameters
of size and lipid content to ovary size index, and population-level endpoints of number of clutches, cumulative
reproductive rate, and per capita birth rate (Table 1).
These effects are highlighted by the two representative
micrographs of control and cadmium-treated animals
(Figure 1), which were taken at the end of the 21-d exposure period.
Microarray results
Microarrays were used to compare the gene-expression
profiles of D. pulex maintained under control conditions
with those exposed to 20 μg Cd/L for 48-h (i.e., sub-lethal
concentration, ~LC01; [GEO:GSE9746]). These utilized
RNA isolated from three independent and concurrently
replicated exposures of Daphnia to cadmium and control
conditions, applied to three replicate microarrays using a
standard control vs. treated design that included dye
swaps (for details see Methods). Gene expression log
ratios (M = log2 treated/control) across the three microarrays were determined as described in Methods and plotted
against log mean intensity values (A = 1/2log2 (treated *
control) as shown in Figure 2[42]. The M-values were distributed around zero, with print control elements that
contained no cDNA possessing the lowest intensity (or A
values). As expected, negative control elements, which
contained non-Daphnia cDNA also, had low A-values.
However, within these two groups (i.e., print control elements, negative control elements), gene expression (or Mvalues) was quite varied because of the considerable noise
observed with these low intensity values. Positive control
elements, which contained known D. pulex genes (cytochrome C, cytochrome B, actin, and ferritin) distributed
with other D. pulex elements on the MA plot.

Empirical Bayes statistics using a p-value cut-off of 0.05
revealed 99 elements (2.9% of the array) for which expression was increased following cadmium treatment and 30
elements (1.1% of the array) for which expression
decreased (Table 2, Figure 3). Of these elements, 95 were
sequenced from the 5'-end. These ESTs clustered into 42

assembled sequences. Sequence analysis and alignment
comparisons of these assembled sequences using the
Blastx program and an expectation-value cut-off of 1 × 103 and 33 matched amino acids [43] against the non-redundant protein sequence inventory at the NCBI identified 27
unique cDNAs with sequence similarities to known genes.
These included 22 up and five down-regulated genes. Fifteen assembled sequences were unidentifiable, sharing no
similarities to known genes. The difference between the
number of sequenced elements identified as cadmium
responsive (i.e., 95) and the total number of likely unique
cDNAs (i.e., 42) was due to redundancy on the microarray. Although many of the elements whose ESTs were clustered into assembled sequences shared similar expression
levels, in some cases their expression levels deviated by as
much as two-fold (Table 2). The observed differences
among clustered elements were even more pronounced
when all sequenced elements belonging to the set of differentially regulated genes (EST cluster) were included in
the analysis. The variation was not a function of differences in their intensity values, because deviations from
the mean value of A were negligible (data not shown).
Without further data, we were unable to verify whether

some assembled sequences were composed of alternatively spliced transcripts and/or recently duplicated loci
that differed in their responses to cadmium.
Functional attributes of responsive genes
The molecular functions and biological processes of
Daphnia genes responding to the cadmium treatment
were investigated based on the putative assignment of
Gene Ontology (GO) terms using Blast2GO [44]. Their
functions spanned a defined set of gene ontologies (Figure
4a). A total of 23 genes (i.e. EST clusters) were assigned 49
molecular functional terms from the third level of the GO.
The predominant terms included structural constituent of
the cuticle (16%) and ion binding (14%). Indeed, 14
genes were altogether annotated as binding proteins, of
which seven were annotated as metal ion binding (iron,
calcium), four as carbohydrate (also listed as protein or
chitin) binding proteins, three specifically as oxygen binding proteins (hemoglobins, also listed as tetrapyrrole
binding proteins), one protein binding and one nucleic

acid binding protein. This last gene (Singlet 469) is a transcriptional regulator whose best match to a Drosophila
protein is Similar to Deadpan (FlyBase ID: FBgn0032741).
Six genes also function as hydrolases (Figure 4a).
As well, a total of 17 genes were assigned 74 biological
process terms from the fourth level of the GO. The majority of the terms were for metabolic processes ascribed to
11 genes, which included cellular metabolism (14%), primary metabolism (14%), macromolecule metabolism
(11%), catabolism (7%), nitrogen compound metabolism (5%), biosynthesis (3%) and regulation of metabo-

lism (Figure 4b). Remarkably, a total of four genes were
attributed roles in chitin metabolism, including chitinases
and chitotriosidase. Another predominant biological
process was related to the localization of cellular components (establishment of localization, transport, protein
localization), which were ascribed to five genes. Three of
these sequences coded for genes involved in oxygen transport (hemoglobins). A ferritin gene was also differentially
regulated during the experiment, which binds iron and is
involved in iron regulation and storage [45,46] and was
ascribed the functions of cell and ion homeostasis.
Finally, the remaining differentially regulated genes with
annotations were likely involved in cell communication
(such as signal transduction), development, and physiological processes (such as defence response) that specify a
reaction to external stimuli, or stress.
Confirmation of microarray result
Following sequence analysis, expression levels of a subset
of genes identified as cadmium-responsive (Table 2) were
measured to validate microarray output. This included
three cadmium responsive genes (i.e., cuticle protein-2,
Contig 257; 2-domain haemoglobin protein subunit,
Contig 262; metallothionein, Contig 221) and one gene
for which expression was not altered (i.e., serine-threonine kinase, Contig 274). Expression levels were confirmed by Q-RT-PCR (Table 3) using aliquots subsampled from pools of RNA that were used for microarray
analysis (technical validation) and RNA collected from
repeated, independent biological exposures (biological
validation). In all instances, expression levels measured
by Q-RT-PCR agreed with microarray output (Figure 5)
both in terms of direction (M) and relative magnitude (A)
of the response.

Characterization of Daphnia metallothioneins
Given its utility as a biomarker, we further characterized
the putative D. pulex MT, which represents one of the first
MT sequences identified from a non-malacostracan crustacean species. A putative MT was identified by the microarray following the sequencing of probes whose
expression was up-regulated by cadmium exposure (Figure 6a). A sequence similarity search against the NCBI
protein database using Blastx revealed little similarity to

other MTs. The closest match at the time was directed to
MT from the giant keyhole limpet, Megathura crenulata (Evalue = 0.036), but this is well below 1 × 10-5 E-value considered to be significant [43]. However, the translated
sequence revealed a 59 amino acid protein of high
cysteine content (30.5%) that contained no aromatic
amino acids or histidine residues, unique features that are

hallmarks of MT. The 18 cysteine residues were arrayed in
characteristic Cys-xaa-yaa-Cys (1), Cys-x-Cys (6), and CysCys (2) motifs, establishing it as a class 1 MT (Fig. 5; [47]).
Nevertheless, the translated amino acid sequence was still
quite diverged from other crustacean MTs (~30% similarity), including differences in the common pattern
observed at the N terminus, P- [GD]-P-C-C-x(3,4)-C-x-C

[48]. Despite this lack of similarity, the number of
cysteine residues was identical to other crustacean MTs
and these showed a high degree of conservation when
aligned with sequences reported for other arthropods
(Table 4). Based on amino-acid alignments with characterized MTs, the D. pulex MT formed two coordinative
domains (α, C-terminus; β, N-terminus), hinging with the
proline residue at position 20 (Fig. 6a, Dpu Mtn1). It
should be noted that during the preparation of this manuscript, an MT gene transcript and translated amino acid
sequence was reported for another daphniid, D. magna
[19].
Following this preliminary identification of the MT gene,
further cDNA sequences were recognized from within a
growing D. pulex cDNA sequence database [49], which
was created as part of the annotation process for the Daphnia genome sequencing project (Colbourne et al., in
prep). Using tBlastx, a total of 9 assembled EST clusters
were discovered, representing transcripts from three
genomic loci. Using Blastn, the regions within genomic
sequence scaffolds were identified that matched the metallothionein cDNA sequences (Figure 6). The locus corresponding to the cDNA identified on the array, called Dpu
Mtn1 [GenBank:EU307302] (Fig 6a), consists of three
exons (86 bp, 90 bp, 168 bp) and two introns (107 bp, 76
bp). The 5' untranslated region (UTR, at least 64 bp) is
fully contained within the first exon, while the 3' untranslated region consisted of 103 bases. The region upstream
of the 5'UTR contains three putative regulatory elements
showing exact sequence similarity with the core consensus
sequence of metal responsive elements (TGCRCNCS,
where R is A or G and S is C or G; [50,51]). This flanking
region also contains a TATA box 20 bases upstream of the
putative transcriptional start site. Within the 5'UTR, the
area immediately upstream of the ATG codon agrees with
Kozack's rules of ribosome binding. The eukaryotic polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is found in the 3'UTR. The
second identified locus called Dpu Mtn2 [GenBank:EU307303] (Fig 6b) encodes a protein that consists

of 66 amino acids. Like the first locus, this gene is composed of three exons (70 bp, 99 bp, 223 bp) and two
introns (141 bp, 70 bp). Its 5'UTR is at least 42 bases and
contained within the first exon, while the 3'UTR consists
of 152 bases. The region upstream of the 5'UTR contains
a single putative metal responsive elements (-1151 bp).

Cysteine residues

Metal binding

aCysteine residues are bold for sites that are conserved in crustacean and insect genes (residues 3–10, 23, 24) and underlined when residues are
clade-specific. Assuming a correct alignment, residues 2, 12, 13, 17, 19 and 20 are conserved in all (or most) of the crustacean genes, whereas
residues 14 and 22 are conserved in the decapod genes. The residues 15, 16, 18 and 21 are exclusively found in the Daphnia genes (representing
branchiopods) and based on the limited sampling of insect genes (from two dipterans), residues 1 and 11 are excluded in the crustacean genes.
Domain partitions and metal bind residues (*) are based on experimental evidence from decapod proteins (Valls et al. [41]). ¥ Poynton et al. [19]

gene models. A) Dpu Mtn1 [GenBank:EU307302], B) Dpu
Mtn2 [GenBank:EU307303], and C) Dpu Mtn3 [GenBank:EU307304].

Finally, the third locus called Dpu Mtn3 [GenBank:EU307304] (Fig 6c) codes for a protein that consists
of 70 amino acids that is almost identical to the amino
acid sequence provided by Poynton et al. [19] for D. magna
(Table 4). The 5'UTR of Dpu Mtn3 is at least 66 bases in
length and the 3'UTR consists of 163 bases. Three putative
metal response elements are found upstream of the 5'UTR
(-164, -300, -374 bp). Unlike the other daphniid MTs, this
gene is composed of four exons (88 bp, 39 bp, 84 bp, 232
bp) and three introns (131 bp, 59 bp 62 bp).
Phylogenetic analysis of crustacean metallothioneins
The amino acid sequences of D. pulex MTs were aligned
and compared to 19 amino acid sequences from 13 other
crustaceans, including the recently identified D. magna
sequence, and two insects to determine the phylogeny of
the protein within Crustacea (Table 4). These comparisons were made difficult by the lack of sequence conservation among the arthropod MTs (12.7% similarity). The
greatest sequence divergence was found among the insect
genes obtained from fully sequenced genomes, which
averaged 72.3%. By contrast, the three D. pulex genes averaged 56.1% sequence divergence. This divergence was
measured from genes that were also identified from a well
characterized genome. Considering that the average divergence among the other entire crustacean MTs was only
27.4%, most of the characterized malacostracan genes

tree constructed from an amino acid alignment of the three
Daphnia pulex metallothionein proteins plus 18 sequences
from 11 selected insect and crustacean taxa using the E-INS-I
algorithm implemented by MAFFT [92]. Gaps within alignments were ignored in pairwise comparisons of the
sequences and the genetic distances were corrected by the
Poisson distribution model. The NCBI accession numbers
are listed beside each taxonomic gene designation. Percent
bootstrap support for nodes are shown, which are derived
from 1000 pseudo-replication of the data. The Daphnia
sequences were deposited at GenBank under the accession
numbers Dpu Mtn1 [GenBank:EU307302]; Dpu Mtn2 [GenBank:EU307303]; and Dpu Mtn3 [GenBank:EU307304].

were likely homologues or recent duplicates among their
representative genomes. Clearly, further genome-wide
investigations among the Crustacea will uncover paralogous loci that will broaden the phylogenetic account of
this protein family.
While little similarity was observed between primary
amino acid sequences, there was a great deal of conservation of the cysteine residues. The MTs contained an average of 30.4% cysteines; crustacean genes contained 3.5%
more cysteines than the representative insects. This conservation translates into structural homologies that coordinate the disulfides within the protein domains, which
are responsible for the molecules' unique metal binding
properties. From the amino acid alignment, 10 cysteine
residues were found to be largely preserved in both the
insect and crustacean genes (Table 4). Some exceptions
were observed. In particular, our alignment suggested that

Page 10 of 19

two of the three Daphnia genes lost the conserved residues
3–5. The two known copper-binding MTs also showed a
single cysteine instead of two at the C-terminus of the proteins. A second class of conserved residues was composed
of cysteines that are known to bind metals in malacostracans. Yet, these cysteines are generally absent in the
insects. Here, most of the Daphnia genes shared six of the
eight residues. However, they all lacked residues 14 and
22. The Daphnia MTs contained a third class of conserved
residues, whose four members are exclusive to this set of
proteins (Table 4). Finally, the insects' α-domains are substantially reduced relative to the Crustacea. As a result,
only two cysteine sites form the fourth class of residues,
which are largely missing from the aligned proteins of the
other taxa.
From this alignment, phylogenetic trees were constructed
by neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods.
The maximum likelihood tree was inferred from 77.6%
fully resolved and 5.9% partly resolved quartets. Although
this latter tree was not completely resolved (tree not
shown), the results from both methods were congruent
and showed three strongly supported monophyletic
groupings with support values at nodes > 95% (Figure 7).
The first group consisted of the cadmium-binding malacostracan MTs, including the presumed recent gene duplicates in the Callinectes and Scylla genomes. Both trees
failed to place all the crab genes above a common node at
the exclusion of the lobster and crayfish loci. In fact, a
weakly supported node united the Potamon and Panulirus
genes in the maximum likelihood tree (57%). The second
group consisted of the three Daphnia MTs stemming from
the base of the branch leading to the cadmium-binding
malacostracan genes. Although this monophyletic grouping was strongly supported, 31% of the maximum likelihood bipartitions united Dp Mtn1 with Mtn2 and placed
Dp Mtn3 at its base. The third group was composed of
three D. melanogaster MTs, which lacked the Drosophila
MtnA gene to form an intra-genomic clade, as seen in
Daphnia. The excluded gene was instead placed at an earlier branch point of the insect clade, which included two
intervening Anopheles genes (Figure 7). Finally, the copper-specific Callinectes MT was positioned at the root of
the insect clade, along with the Drosophila copper thionein
MtnA locus and the Anopheles Mtn1 gene. The relative
positions of these genes were unresolved on the maximum likelihood tree, whereas 59% of the bipartitions
supported the placement of the Anopheles Mtn2 gene at
the base of the group 3 Drosophila genes.

Discussion
In this paper we describe studies with newly developed D.
pulex cDNA microarrays investigating the expressed
mRNA responses of daphniids to the environmental stressor cadmium. Although microarrays have been success-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/477

fully used to identify patterns of genes responding to
metal exposure in organisms for which there is an abundant amount of sequence information [52,53], it is often
difficult to relate the identified genes to expressed phenotypes. These challenges exist in part because the environmental contributions to phenotype in most common
laboratory species are poorly understood. However, as
noted by Gracey et al., [12], abundant sequence data are
not a pre-requisite for gene-expression profiling. Thus,
one aim of the present study was to develop and apply
microarray technologies to the ecologically tractable
aquatic micro-crustacean, D. pulex. These studies revealed
patterns of gene response that provide insight into the
biological and potentially toxicological responses to this
important environmental contaminant. The data emphasize the potential of this approach as a tool for discovering
genes regulated by an environmental stressor, but in a species for which gene expression profiles can be interpreted
in context of individual and population-level effects.
Associations with cadmium induced phenotypes, identification of genes reported in the literature to be regulated
following cadmium exposure, and independent validations via Q-RT-PCR provided support for their utility in
this role. In addition, these studies led to the discovery D.
pulex MT mRNAs and gene sequences, providing an
important new biomarker for Daphnia studies, while also
extending the phylogeny of this class of genes. The successful identification of the metal binding protein, MT, is
highlighted, not only due to its critical biological functions, but also because the blind microarray approach
provided advantages over cloning methods that require
significant sequence similarity to isolate genes.
We identified the acute (48-h) and chronic (21-d)
responses of our D. pulex isolate to cadmium to better
define sub-lethal exposure concentrations and cadmiuminduced phenotypes. The present study is in agreement
with those of others [16,21] that indicate D. pulex is one
of the most acutely sensitive aquatic species to cadmium
[54]. Reported LC50 values are comparable to data published by others (i.e., range from 46 to 90 μg Cd/L; [16]).
As others have noted, chronic exposure of D. pulex to cadmium reduced individual fitness parameters, such as
length and lipid-ovary indices, and inhibited population
endpoints, such as number of clutches, cumulative reproduction, and per capita birth rate (Table 1; [55,56]). These
endpoints have been quantitatively linked to population
success [57].
For example, storage of lipids, vitellogenisis, and ecdysis
(i.e., molt) are physiologically and chronologically associated with reproductive success and survivorship [57]. Adipocytes are incorporated into the ovary during egg
development providing energy for reproduction. Parthenogenetic embryos are then transferred into the brood

chamber that is contained within the carapace for further
development and the process ends with newborn Daphnia
released into the water column during the molt. Also,
molt directly relates to growth, as Daphnia size is constrained by the carapace. Therefore, decreased length, lowered lipid-ovary indices, and fewer clutches comprised of
fewer offspring can be explained by impaired vitellogenisis and/or ecdysis. Cadmium has been reported by others
to inhibit ecdysis [58] and vitellogenisis [59,60] in
arthropods.
Cadmium may also decrease daphniid size by limiting
calcium intake. Calcium content is directly related to the
mass of the carapace and, subsequently size [61] and cadmium is known to impair calcium uptake and metabolism via substitution [62]. However, several studies have
shown that while the period of increased calcium flux during molt can result in increased cadmium uptake [63,64],
cadmium does not affect calcium accumulation or content [64]. Yet interestingly, our studies revealed two
cDNAs that responded to cadmium that represent putative calcium binding proteins (singlet 97 and contig 220),
suggesting that cadmium may affect calcium regulatory
pathways in more subtle ways that contribute to its overall
effects.
The present study is one of the first to apply microarray
technologies to D. pulex. These "blind arrays" identified
99 elements for which gene-expression was positively regulated and 30 elements that were negatively regulated by
cadmium. However, sequence analysis revealed that these
probes included several redundant features. When they
were assembled into EST contigs to isolate unique features, 30 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated genes were
identified (Table 2). Given the redundancy that existed on
the array and the 'blind' approach-employed, the observation of redundant, cadmium-regulated elements (e.g.,
cuticle protein) was reassuring. In addition, the number
of unique elements regulated following exposure to cadmium only represents a very small percentage (~2%) of
the estimated 1,550 unique elements on the array, which
is similar to other microarray studies involving sub-toxic
cadmium exposures (2%, [52]; 1%, [65]; 1–3%, [66] and
as suggested by Andrew et al.[52] is consistent with expectations for low, non-toxic exposures that tend to induce
specific pathways.
The D. pulex microarrays and their genomics database
have proven to be insightful experimental tools for identifying genes regulated by cadmium. Yet, relating the gene
sequence to putative gene function is made difficult by the
excessively large phylogenetic distances between Daphnia
and its closest relatives among the classical genomic
model systems. For example, the best model system to
Daphnia with extensive functional genomic information is

Drosophila, which last shared a common ancestor some
600 M years ago. There are also few ESTs that share
sequence conservation with proteins in public databases;
crustacean proteins represent only 0.1% of 6.9 million
records in the NCBI taxonomic database. Of the 42
unique cadmium-regulated genes identified, only three
were homologous to known Daphnia genes. Likewise,
almost 36% of the elements identified were ESTs showing
no sequence similarity with known proteins. Gracey et
al.[12] reported similar successes with 'blind' microarrays,
as approximately 40% of identified elements were unidentifiable ESTs. However, as these authors noted, novel
ESTs may represent untranslated regions of previously
identified genes or multiple distinct regions of unknown
genes. These possibilities cannot be dismissed; we estimate that 1/4 of the orphan genes are unknown because
of sequences not extending into recognizable functional
domains of the gene [67]. The remaining 27 elements regulated in response to cadmium exposure on the microarray were putatively identified by similarity with known
proteins.
The genes regulated in response to cadmium exposure
identified in these experiments provided several measures

Page 12 of 19

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:477

of the utility of this approach for gene discovery and its
reliability in identifying biologically sensible patterns of
gene regulation. For example, many of the genes responding to cadmium exposure were part of common physiological pathways (i.e., ecdysis, metal detoxication) and
few were indicative of general stress response (e.g., heat
shock proteins, heme-oxidase) or overt cellular toxicity
(e.g., housekeeping genes).
Ecdysteroid-responsive genes and other molt related
genes that included chitinases 1 and 2, chitotriosidase,
BcNCP 14.9, cuticle proteins 1 through 5, and singlet 251,
comprised the majority of genes regulated in response to
cadmium exposure (Figure 8, Table 2). This finding is critical given that altered expression of these genes, which are
associated with the exoskeleton, provides a direct mechanistic link with demographic endpoints and individual fitness parameters that indicated ecdysis (i.e., molt) is
impaired in Daphnia following cadmium exposure (Figure
1, Table 1). Deep sequencing of cDNA libraries constructed from RNA isolated from cadmium-exposed D.
pulex provided support of these findings (Colbourne JK,
personal communication). Cadmium derived libraries
were enriched with genes that were identified as structural
constituents of the cuticle. This observation suggests that
ecdysis and molt related regulatory pathways are generally
influenced by cadmium, which has been observed by others [63,64]. It is interesting that short-term exposures to
cadmium of the Daphnia used in the array experiment
provided patterns of response that were meaningful in
interpreting demographic experiments that involved
longer-term exposures to lower cadmium concentrations.
This observation raises the possibility that an approach
such as this could provide biomarkers that serve as early
indicators of chronic exposures, which is an area we are
currently exploring, but beyond the scope of the current
manuscript.
These experiments also identified altered expression-levels of genes known to be regulated by cadmium (Figure
8). These included the metal binding protein, MT, which
plays a central role in cadmium detoxication and is
known to be induced by cadmium [19,41,68]. In addition, the microarrays identified a gene responsible for oxygen transport and iron metabolism in Daphnia,
hemoglobin [69]. Expression of hemoglobin is known to
be induced by anoxia, limiting iron supplies, and cadmium [19,70,71]; unpublished results). As discussed
above, the arrays also identified structural components of
the cuticle and associated regulatory components (i.e.,
chitinase) and chitinase activity has been shown to positively correlate with cadmium concentrations in previous
studies [19,72]. Likewise, opsin was found to be regulated
in response to cadmium on the microarrays, and cadmium has been shown to interfere with photo-behavior in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/477

daphniids, which is a complex genetically linked trait
involving kairomone signalling, photoreceptor detection
(e.g., opsin, [73]), and negative phototaxis [74,75]. At the
cellular-level cadmium is known to induce oxidative stress
[28]. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), a phase II enzyme
that catalyses the conjugation of reduced glutathione with
electrophilic compounds, is an important antioxidant
defence enzyme that works to detoxify the products of oxidative stress [76]and was up-regulated on the array. GST
gene transcription [19] and enzyme activity [77] have
been shown by others to increase following exposure to
cadmium.
Metallothionein induction is the principal adaptive
response associated with organism survival during exposure to elevated cadmium concentrations [41,78]. The discovery of D. pulex MTs highlight the advantages of this
approach in identifying genes regulated by cadmium.
While the conservation of cysteine residues ensures thiolate cluster formation, metal binding and provides both
the structural and functional basis to identify these genes
as MTs, cloning methods such as hybridization or amplification using degenerate oligonucleotides were ineffective because of its lack of similarity with other known
crustacean MT sequences (Figure 6). The present study is
the first to provide genomic DNA sequence information
for a non-malacostracan crustacean, the first to report the
promoter region of any crustacean MT, and one of the few
to identify the metal-responsive element (MRE) consensus core sequence in any invertebrate. MREs were identified in the 5'flanking region of D. pulex MTs (Fig 6), Both
Dpu Mtn1 and Dpu Mtn3 contained MREs within 200 bp
of the transcriptional start site. The promoter region of the
sea urchin MT gene was found to contain two MREs residing within 300 bp of the start of transcription [79,80].
There was only genomic (primary) sequence provided for
one crustacean MT (i.e., green shore crab, Carcinus maenas) in the entire NCBI repository, but it lacked any flanking sequences (i.e., upstream and downstream regulatory
regions). Green shore crab MT has a structure common to
Dpu Mtn1 and Dpu Mtn2 with three exons separated by
two introns [81]. In fact, similar architectures have been
reported for the urchin, trout and several mammals. Also,
D. pulex have much smaller intronic regions (Figure 6),
likely a consequence of its compact genome size (~200
Mb). Although the architectures of these genes were similar to others, little sequence similarity was observed
within their coding sequence for any known MT.
The translated daphniid sequences (i.e. D. pulex; D.
magna, Poynton et al.[19]) also showed little similarity to
other MT genes (Table 4, Fig 7), including other crustaceans. This includes the N-terminal crustacean motif (P[GD]-P-C-C-x(3 or 4)-C-X-C;[41,48]. However, since
daphniid MTs represent the first MTs isolated from a non-

Page 13 of 19

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:477

malacostracan crustacean, the lack of phylogenetic representation in the NCBI repository could account for some
these differences. There was considerable similarity in
terms of number and distribution of cysteine residues. All
crustacean MTs sequenced to date are comprised of 18
cysteine residues with the exceptions of the copper MT
isolated from the green crab [41], D. magna MT [19] and
Dpu Mtn3 identified in this investigation that each contain 19 cysteines. The conservation of cysteine residues is
expected, given that they are responsible for a great deal of
the tertiary structure and metal-binding functions of the
protein [78]. In fact, Valls et al.[41] has suggested using
the binding properties (e.g., stoichiometry of metal- MT
species) to strengthen current classifications that are based
on phylogeny.
The current classification procedure for MTs [82] is based
on phylogenetic relationships rather than amino acid
composition and cysteine content. This nomenclature
protocol was established to better identify related functional properties in which MTs are divided into families
based on evolutionary conservation. In this classification
scheme, crustaceans constitute a single family, given the
name number three, which is comprised of three sub-families (crustacean one, c1; crustacean two, c2; crustacean,
c), where c1 and c2 genes each constitute monophyletic
clades. The third family termed, c, is reserved for crustacean MTs that are different from these others. Daphnia
pulex MTs do not align well with malacostracan type 1 or
type 2 MTs and thus, according to this nomenclature are
designated Dpu Mtn1, 3, c; Dpu Mtn2, 3, c; and Dpu
Mtn3, 3, c.

Conclusion
In summary, the development of D. pulex cDNA microarrays and associated sequence information has provided a useful first generation functional genomic tool
for examining biological responses of this key sentinel
species to environmental agents and other stressors.
Treatment of D. pulex with sub-toxic levels of cadmium
revealed a specific pattern of gene expression changes
that provide new insights into their biological and toxicological responses to this environmental contaminant.
Moreover, microarray responses to cadmium led to the
discovery of D. pulex MTs, whose gene structure and
cysteine content clearly place it in this gene family, but
whose sequence divergence reveals that classical cloning
and sequencing techniques based on similarity were
likely to fail. Further identification of D. pulex genes that
are responsive to various experimental treatments
through use of these genomics tools will provide new
and important insights into their biology. Advances in
Daphnia genomics will enable the further development
of this species as a model organism for a wide variety of
biological investigations.

Methods
Animals and cadmium exposure
Daphnia pulex (subclade arenata) used in this study were
obtained from isoclonal laboratory cultures of an isolate
collected from an ephemeral pond near the Pacific coast
in Oregon. This pond is found north of Florence on the
east side of highway 101 at milepost 201 in Douglas
County. Daphnia pulex subclade arenata is a member of
the Daphnia pulex complex [83] and our isolate is from the
same population as the strain whose genome has been
sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute as part of the
Daphnia Genomics Consortium initiative [84]. The Daphnia were housed in 3L borosilicate glass beakers (20 per
beaker) held inside an environmental chamber at a constant temperature (20 ± 1°C; [85]) and photoperiod (16:8
light-dark). Organisms were maintained in nanopure
water reconstituted to moderate hardness [86] and
renewed weekly. They were fed daily Ankistrodesmus falcatus at a rate of 75,000 cells/mL. Our pre-experimental procedure, described in Folt et al.[87], controlled for maternal
effects in acute toxicity tests, demographic experiments
and batch exposures. For these experiments, neonates (<
24 h old) were isolated from maintenance cultures one
generation prior to metal exposure. These organisms are
referred to as 'brood females', which were synchronized
with respect to time of maturity for producing neonates
for metal experiments.
Acute toxicity tests
Acute (48-h) toxicity tests were conducted with cadmium
according to recommendations given by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency with slight modifications [10]. Test solutions were prepared immediately prior
to use with culture media from stocks made with CdCl2
(analytical grade, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA)
dissolved in deionized water. Test concentrations nominally ranged from 1 to 150 μg Cd/L. Toxicity tests
employed a completely random design consisting of five
or six metal treatments and a control group arrayed in
two-fold serial dilutions. Ten neonates (< 24 h old) were
randomly placed into a 40 ml glass exposure chamber
containing 30 ml of test solution. Four replicate exposure
chambers were employed per treatment or control group.
Daphniids were not fed during tests. Mortality was
assessed for individuals in each container after 48-h exposure. An individual was labeled dead if it was unresponsive to gentle prodding with a pipette tip. These tests were
repeated and results combined to determine lethal concentrations (LC x values, where x equals a given percent
mortality) estimated from the probit transformed concentration-response curves.
Demographic experiments
Twenty-one day life-table experiments followed a completely randomized design as given in U.S. EPA [11]. A

single organism was randomly placed into a 120 ml exposure chamber. Ten replicate chambers were used per test
group. Treatment groups consisted of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.75,
2.5 μg Cd/L and controls. Test waters were renewed every
other day, at which point general water quality parameters
of temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and pH
were monitored. Water column metal concentrations
were measured at the beginning and end of each test. Mortality and reproduction were observed over the duration
of the test and endpoints included age to first reproduction, cumulative reproduction, neonates per adult, and
percent survival as per Chen and Folt [88]. Length measurements [89] and lipid ovary indices [57] were taken at
the end of the experiment using an Olympus BX40 microscope fitted with a digital camera (Hitachi KP-D50) driven
by Scion Image software (V. 1.63).
Batch exposure
The Daphnia used for microarray experiments and for validation tests by RT-PCR were exposed in repeated experiments in batches of 50 adult organisms plus their
offspring per 3.5-l exposure chamber. The offspring of
these animals were not discarded to increase biological
variability and increase opportunities for gene discovery.
Batch number was optimized to provide adequate sample
mass for molecular evaluation (e.g., 1 adult Daphnia
equals 1 μg of total RNA). Animals were introduced as
neonates (< 24-h old) and cultures were maintained until
they produced their third clutch (15-d). These experiments, which provided source material for microarray
experiments and validation tests, included short-term
(48-h) independently replicated (n = 3) exposures to nonlethal concentrations of cadmium (LC01, 20 μg Cd/L)
and control conditions.
Gene response profiles
Microarray construction
Working in the absence of abundant a priori DNA
sequence data for D. pulex, we constructed a 3,842 element microarrays using 3,602 PCR-amplified cDNA and
240 control probes. A detailed description of this microarray platform is archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression
Omnibus under the accession number [GEO:GPL6195],
series [GEO:GSE9746]. Briefly, cDNA for seeding the
amplifications were obtained by directly transferring into
the reactions 5 μl of cDNA bacterial transformants, which
were grown in 1.2 ml of 2X YT and 0.005% chloramphenicol in 96-deepwell plates for 24 hours at 37°C. The
arrayed cDNA clones were randomly picked from two
high-quality D. pulex cDNA libraries (Creator SMART,
Clontech). For details about the libraries and results from
quality assurance tests, see Colbourne et al.[67]. The
amplifications were conducted in 100 μl reactions containing 1× Taq buffer (Eppendorf), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/477

μM primers (Fwd. 5'-GTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTAG 3'
and Rev. 5'-AAACAGCTATGACCATGTTCAC 3'), 5 U Taq
(Eppendorf). The PCR cycling conditions involved a 3
minute initial denaturation step at 94°C followed by 35
cycles of 94°C, 54°C and 72°C each for 1 minute. The
products were purified using the Multiscreen-PCR 96-well
system (Millipore) on a Biomek FX liquid handling robot
(Beckman). Our pilot experiments for this section of our
workflow indicated that this purification system recovered 80–90% of the original sample and introduced no
impurities that interfered with immobilizing DNA onto
glass. The quality of PCR amplifications was visually
inspected by agarose-gel electrophoresis and their number
and size were recorded using Kodak's 440cf scanner and
1D imaging software (v.3.6). The sample concentrations
were determined by 96-well microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, SpectraMax 190) and adjusted to
50–200 ng/μl for printing. The PCR amplifications were
classified as having produced a single high yield product
(3,238; 91%), as failures (163 reactions; 5%), as having
produced more than one amplicon (102 reactions; 3%) or
as being weak (49 reactions; 1%). The DNA yields averaged 409.7 ng with a standard deviation of 210.8 ng.
Printing was achieved using an Omnigrid 100 robot (GeneMachines). The cDNA were spotted in tandem on GapsII
amino-silane slides (Corning) in 3× SSC and 1.5 M
Betaine buffer using Stealth Micro-Spotting Pins (Telechem) at 20°C and 65% humidity. The cDNA was fixed
to the microarray slides by baking at 85°C for 3 hours. To
achieve minimal signal to background ratios averaging
40–50 fluorescence units, the slides were post-processed
by washing in 5 × SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS at 55°C for
5 minutes, rinsing in water at room temperature for 2
minutes, denaturing the DNA in water at 95°C for 4 minutes, then rinsing in water at room temperature for 30 seconds. The slides were finally rinsed in isopropanol at 4°C
and dried by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 minutes before
being stored. Slides were printed in groups of 100 or 120,
where 95% of the slides were free of defects. Negative controls were included, designed to detect potential problems. To test for the cross-contamination of probes,
printing buffer containing no DNA was first deposited at
the beginning of each subarray. Printing buffer was also
printed following positive control DNA (coding cytochrome c, cytochrome b, actin and ferritin) at both the
beginning and end of the subarrays. To test for the effect
of template DNA during the hybridizations, the product
of intentionally failed PCR reactions with template DNA
but no primers were printed. Finally, amplified DNA from
Arabidopsis and lambda phage plus bacterial spiking controls (Ambion) was also included. Based on random
sequencing of 619 cDNAs probes, and post hoc sequencing of an additional 927 cDNA probes, gene-redundancy
on the array was calculated to be roughly 57%. Thus, there
were likely ~1,550 interrogated unique genes on the array.

Labeling and hybridization
Microarrays were used to discover genes that were differentially expressed following sub-lethal cadmium stress in
D. pulex. They utilized RNA isolated from three independent and concurrently replicated exposures of Daphnia to
cadmium and control conditions, applied to three replicate microarrays using a standard control vs. treated
design that included dye swaps. This design provided
three replicates of metal exposed and control D. pulex,
with the technical variability of hybridization kinetics
captured on each slide across duplicate probes.

Total RNA was isolated from Daphnia that were acutely
(48-h) exposed to 20 μg Cd/L (treated) and from their
genetic clones reared under standard (control) conditions
as given above for batch cultures. Animals were directly
placed in lysis buffer and RNA was extracted using
Qiashredder columns and RNeasy kits (Qiagen). DNA
contamination was removed by DNAse treatment
(Ambion) and RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry
(Nanodrop Technologies); and quality determined with a
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). For each sample, 10 μg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamer
primers using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and an overnight incubation, which included aminoallyl-dNTPs. Following reverse transcription and clean up (alkaline
hydrolysis and Qiaquick columns, Qiagen), cDNA samples were coupled to Alexa Fluor dyes (555, 647), using
amino-allyl labeling methods and alternating direction
with replicate arrays (i.e., dye-swap; [90]). The amounts of
dye incorporated cDNA were measured by spectrophotometer using the acceptability cutoffs of > 200 pmol of
dye incorporation and a nucleotide to dye molecule ratio
of > 50 [91]. The labeled samples were then pooled
according to treatment comparisons (e.g., control vs. Cd
treated), dried, and resuspended in hybridization buffer
(50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 20 μg SSDNA, and
20 μg of poly(A)-DNA). The hybridization solution (containing the dye labeled samples was placed on the microarray and hybridization was accomplished overnight at
42°C in a specially fitted hybridization chamber (Corning). Following hybridization, the glass slides were
washed successively in a low stringency solution (1× SSC,
0.2%SDS) at 42°C for four minutes, high stringency solution (0.1× SSC, 0.2%SDS) at room temperature for four
minutes, twice in 0.1× SSC for 2.5 minutes, and finally
they were dipped in water, dried and stored in the dark
until fluorescence was measured [91].

Gene Expression Analysis
The fluorescent signals were scanned and the array data
were extracted using GeneChip Scanner 3000 software
version 5.1 (Axon). The data were coupled to the array
template using the GeneChip Operating System (GCOS)
software, V. 1.4. For each microarray, LIMMA functions as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/477

defined in [92-94] were used to create unique, background subtracted, LOESS (i.e., locally weighted least
squares regression) normalized, log expression values,
which accounted for duplicate spots using gene-wise linear models fit to expression data. The LIMMA derived log
expression values were fit to a linear model based on treatment, which moderated the resulting t statistics using the
empirical Bayes method. Probes with a p-value ≤ 0.05
were deemed significant and selected for sequencing. A 5'
expressed sequence tag was generated for the majority of
the differentially expressed clones. These sequences were
analyzed and assigned putative gene function annotations
based on sequence similarity searches against NCBI protein and insect genome databases [67]. Analyses of the
functional grouping of genes based on Gene Ontology
(GO) assignments were performed using Blast2GO [44].
For those probes sharing common putative annotations,
we performed permutation tests to estimate the likelihood that random processes would place these highly represented annotations on our list of differentially expressed
cDNA and to establish p-values on certain annotations
(i.e., P values provided in Table 3).
Confirmation of genes regulated in response to cadmium exposure
Quantitative real-time (RT) PCR was used to validate
expression levels of four genes identified on the microarray; three genes were regulated following cadmium exposure (i.e., cuticle protein-2, Contig 257; 2-domain
haemoglobin protein subunit, Contig 262; metallothionein, Contig 221) and one gene for which expression was not altered (i.e., serine-threonine kinase, Contig
274). This validation test included a set of replicate RNA
from the microarrays plus six independent biological replicates. Primers and TaqMan probes were designed using
PRIMER EXPRESS, V (Applied Biosciences), which are
listed in Table 3. Reverse transcription was performed
with the Omniscript reverse transcription kit from Qiagen. Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed
for each sample using random primers (final concentration of 5 μM) for metallothionein and gene-specific primers for the other three genes (0.5 μM final concentration,
Table 3). Real-time PCR was performed following the Qiagen protocols on the Applied Biosystems 7700 machine
and included a standard curve in each run for each gene
amplified in that run. The standard curve consisted of
serial dilutions of the cDNA being amplified. Applied Biosystems Master Mix was used in each amplification, which
contained all PCR components necessary except the
cDNA, primers (900 nM each, final concentration) and
the Taqman probe (250 nM, final concentration). Taqman probes were FAM labeled and contained an MGB
quencher. Controls to test for DNA contamination were
always included, even though DNase digestion was performed on the RNA before reverse transcription. The
amplification steps consisted of the standard 40 cycles

Page 16 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:477

preceded by two minutes at 50°C and ten minutes at
95°C to activate the enzyme. Each cycle included 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minute at 60°C. For each sample, the
cycle at which amplification reached the exponential
phase was recorded as the Ct value. Final level of transcript for metallothionein was normalized using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer to directly measure the cDNA
level in each sample. The other genes were normalized to
the levels of serine threonine kinase, which was not differentially regulated.
Metallothionein characterization
cDNA and genomic sequence determination
Quality EST sequences were obtained from 1,529 cDNA
elements on the array. These were clustered, their open
reading frames were determined and they were annotated
based on sequence similarity searches against NCBI and
custom protein databases. Details on our methods and of
the results are presented elsewhere [67]. The sequences of
two elements on the microarray that respond to cadmium
stress revealed identical transcripts for a cysteine-rich protein resembling metallothionein. The translated gene
sequence was used to identify additional metallothionein-like loci within a sequence database derived
from 36 cDNA libraries used to support the ongoing D.
pulex genome sequencing project (Colbourne et al., in
prep). The program tBlastn [95] was used at a significance
cut-off value of e < 1 × 10-10 to search 36,342 sequence
assemblies (EST clusters). To determine whether the identified sequences were homologous or alternatively spliced
loci, these were subsequently matched to the latest D.
pulex genome sequence assembly by the Joint Genome
Institute using the Blastn tool on wFleaBase [96]. The
cDNA was aligned to genomic DNA sequences by the
Clustal method using MegAlign (DNASTAR, Inc.).
Phylogenetic analysis
Metallothionein protein sequences for 18 selected insect
and crustacean species were obtained from the NCBI database. The multiple cDNA alignment was produced by the
MAFFT version 5 program using the E-INS-i strategy [97].
The scoring matrix for the protein sequences was
Blosum62 and the alignment parameters included a gap
opening penalty of 3 and a gap extension penalty (offset
value) of 0.15. This protein alignment was then used to
calculate a genetic similarity matrix including all loci by
using MEGA version 3.1 [98] with a Poisson correction of
the distances and pairwise deletion of the alignment gaps.
A corresponding neighbor-joining tree was constructed
that included 1,000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates of the
data for assigning confidence to nodes. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was also constructed by quartet puzzling using the program Tree-Puzzle version 5.2 [99] with
10,000 puzzling steps and with the Dayhoff model of

amino acid substitution under uniform rates of molecular
evolution.
