Abstract
Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences present in the genomes
of most organisms. They have been extensively studied in animals, fungi, and plants, and have been
shown to have important functions in genome dynamics and species evolution. Recent genomic
data can now enlarge the identification and study of TEs to other branches of the eukaryotic tree
of life. Diatoms, which belong to the heterokont group, are unicellular eukaryotic algae responsible
for around 40% of marine primary productivity. The genomes of a centric diatom, Thalassiosira
pseudonana, and a pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, that likely diverged around 90 Mya,
have recently become available.
Results: In the present work, we establish that LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are the most
abundant TEs inhabiting these genomes, with a much higher presence in the P. tricornutum genome.
We show that the LTR-RTs found in diatoms form two new phylogenetic lineages that appear to
be diatom specific and are also found in environmental samples taken from different oceans.
Comparative expression analysis in P. tricornutum cells cultured under 16 different conditions
demonstrate high levels of transcriptional activity of LTR retrotransposons in response to nitrate
limitation and upon exposure to diatom-derived reactive aldehydes, which are known to induce
stress responses and cell death. Regulatory aspects of P. tricornutum retrotransposon transcription
also include the occurrence of nitrate limitation sensitive cis-regulatory components within LTR
elements and cytosine methylation dynamics. Differential insertion patterns in different P.
tricornutum accessions isolated from around the world infer the role of LTR-RTs in generating
intraspecific genetic variability.
Conclusion: Based on these findings we propose that LTR-RTs may have been important for
promoting genome rearrangements in diatoms.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic
sequences found within the genomes of most organisms.
Sequences derived from TEs represent a genomic fraction
of 3% in baker's yeast [1], ~20% in fruit fly [2-4], 45% in
human [5,6] and over 80% in maize [7,8]. They are
thought to be important contributors to genome evolution by inserting into genes or genetic regulatory elements, thereby disrupting gene function, altering levels of
gene expression, triggering chromosomal rearrangements,
and adding to or subtracting from the physical size of a
host genome [9]. TEs are classified into two groups based
on their mode of transposition: retrotransposons or Class
1 TEs which replicate through reverse transcription of an
mRNA intermediate, and DNA transposons or Class 2 TEs
that use a "cut and paste" mechanism.
A pervasive group of retrotransposons are those flanked
by long terminal repeats (LTRs), also typical of retroviruses to which they are related. The LTR direct sequence
repeats flank the internal region that encodes both structural and enzymatic proteins with homology to the GAG
and POL proteins of retroviruses. The gag gene encodes
structural proteins that form the virus-like particle (VLP),
inside which reverse transcription takes place. The pol
gene encodes several enzymatic functions, including a
protease (PR) that cleaves the POL polyprotein, a reverse
transcriptase (RT) that copies the retrotransposon RNA
into cDNA, a ribonuclease H domain (RH), and an integrase (IN) that integrates the cDNA into the genome. Two
main groups of LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are found
throughout eukaryotes, and are distinguished by the
organization of their pol genes and similarities among
their encoded RT proteins [10]. These groups are referred
to as Ty1/copia elements (Pseudoviridae) and Ty3/gypsy
elements (Metaviridae), which respectively display a PR,
IN, RT, RH and PR, RT, RH, IN gene organization.
The unicellular chlorophyll c-containing algal class Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) is among the most successful and
diversified groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes, with possibly over 100,000 extant species [11] widespread in all
kinds of humid and open water environments. The contribution of diatom photosynthesis to marine primary productivity has been estimated to be around 40% [12,13].
Diatoms have a peculiar genetic makeup because they are
likely to have emerged following a secondary endosymbiotic process between a photosynthetic eukaryote, most
probably red algal-like, and a heterotrophic eukaryote
[14]. They are traditionally divided into two orders: the
centric diatoms which are radially symmetrical and are
thought to have arisen around 180 Million years ago
(Mya), followed by the pennate diatoms around 90 Mya
which are bilaterally symmetrical. Genome sequences of
the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and the pen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/624

nate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum have recently
become available [15,16]. Because diatoms are single
celled organisms that typically reproduce mitotically, the
activity of LTR-RTs might have particularly profound
effects on genome evolution since any non-lethal retroelement insertion will be transmitted to subsequent generations.
In an analysis of the T. pseudonana genome, Armbrust and
collaborators identified several TEs [15]. In the current
work, we have identified additional TEs in both diatom
genomes and we show that LTR-RTs are the most abundant elements, particularly in P. tricornutum where they
have amplified enormously. Phylogenetic analysis of the
RT domain shows that diatom Ty1/copia-like elements
belong to different lineages, and that two of them are diatom specific. Examination of the CAMERA metagenomic
database reveals that these elements are also widespread
in different oceans. The potential ecological relevance of
these elements for driving genome and population evolution and heterogeneity has been assessed by examining
their expression in response to stress as well as their distribution in P. tricornutum accessions collected from different locations worldwide. We also examine whether or not
cis-regulatory elements within LTR sequences contain sufficient information for driving retrotransposon transcription in response to nitrate deprevation and if alterations
in cytosine methylation play a role in retrotransposon
expression.

Results
Expansion of LTR Retrotransposons in the P. tricornutum
genome
We first examined the TE content of diatom genomes. In
the T. pseudonana genome Armbrust and collaborators
identified some Ty1/copia and Ty3/gypsy-like elements, a
family of RTE-like non-LTR retrotransposons, Mutatorlike (here denoted as TpMuDR1) and Harbinger-like DNA
transposons, as well as some unknown unclassified
repeated sequences [15,17]. In the present work, we could
identify additional LTR-RT elements in the T. pseudonana
genome (Figure 1). We also identified numerous Ty1/
copia-like elements in the P. tricornutum genome as well as
an RTE-like element, two distinct families of Mutator-like
elements (one being closely related to TpMuDR1 elements), and two other different types of uncharacterized
transposase-containing elements (one being weakly
related to piggyBac transposons and for which we also
found a homolog in the T. pseudonana genome (see Materials and Methods). Ty3/gypsy-like elements were not
found in the P. tricornutum genome (Figure 1A).

To analyse the contribution of TEs to diatom genomes we
used the diatom TE DNA sequences to run the RepeatMasker program [18] on both genomes. In total, we found

that TEs contribute 1,665 kb (6.4%) of the P. tricornutum
genome and 590 kb (1.9%) of the T. pseudonana genome.
Of these, LTR-RTs are the most abundant in both genomes
and constitute 90% and 58% of the P. tricornutum and T.
pseudonana TE complement, respectively (Figure 1A and
1B). Harbinger elements also appear to represent a significant proportion in T. pseudonana. In total, the RepeatMasker output indicated that sequences deriving from LTRRTs make up 5.8% of the P. tricornutum genome [16] and
1.1% of the T. pseudonana genome [15] (Figure 1C). It
thus appears that Ty1/copia-like LTR-RTs have significantly expanded in the P. tricornutum genome.
Classification of LTR retrotransposon sequences
To further investigate the diatom LTR-RT elements, we
manually screened the P. tricornutum and T. pseudonana
nuclear genomes for the presence of putatively autonomous LTR-RTs (see Materials and Methods), and found a
total of 42 and 13 putative active elements in the final
unmasked assemblies of the P. tricornutum and T. pseudo-

nana nuclear genomes, respectively. Most of these have
greater than 95% identical LTR pairs and display only one
or no stop codon/frameshifts between the gag and pol
genes (Additional file 1 and Materials and Methods). All
the selected sequences from P. tricornutum and 11 from T.
pseudonana belonged to the Ty1/copia class with pol
domains ordered as expected (PR, IN, RT, RH), and the
two remaining sequences from T. pseudonana belonged to
the Ty3/gypsy class with pol domains also ordered in a typical fashion (PR, RT, RH, IN).
The 53 Ty1/copia-like elements identified in the P. tricornutum and T. pseudonana genomes were classified on the
basis of RT domain sequence similarity (see Materials and
Methods). Seven groups of Ty1/copia-like retroelements
were identified and denoted CoDi1 to CoDi7 (Ty1/Copialike elements from Diatoms) (Additional file 1, Figure 1).
While the CoDi1 to CoDi5 groups are quite homogeneous, the CoDi6 group consists of a set of diverse elements.
The CoDi7 group is composed of a single element from P.

tricornutum (PtC47). The CoDi1-2-3-7 groups are specific
to P. tricornutum whereas the CoDi4-5-6 groups are composed of elements found in both diatom genomes. It
appears that the CoDi2 and CoDi4 groups are major components of LTR-RT expansion in the P. tricornutum
genome (Figure 1D).
Phylogenetic analysis
We constructed a phylogenetic tree from a CLUSTALW
multiple alignment of the RT domains from the Ty1/copialike shown in Additional file 1 as well as reference
sequences for the Ty1 and Copia lineages (Tnt from
tobacco, copia from fruit fly, and Ty1 from budding yeast)
(Figure 2). We observed a distribution of sequences into
seven clusters corresponding to the groups defined previously (Additional file 1). The most homogeneous clusters
represent the groups CoDi1-2-3 composed of sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/624

present only in P. tricornutum. The PtC47 element representing the CoDi7 group appears distantly linked to the
CoDi1-2 groups. The lineage linking the CoDi1-2-3-4-7
groups was denoted CoDiI (Figure 2). Like CoDi4, the
CoDi5 group is composed of sequences from both the
centric and the pennate diatom and constitutes a separate
lineage we called CoDiII. Finally, the elements from the
CoDi6 group which includes elements from both
genomes cluster into a highly heterogeneous lineage
together with the marker elements Tnt and copia. In this
tree, we can therefore recognize a class of diatom Ty1/
copia-like elements most closely related to known elements from the Copia lineage as well as two diatom-specific lineages, CoDiI and CoDiII (Figure 2).
To better clarify the evolutionary relationships between
the LTR-RTs from diatoms and other retrotransposable

elements, we studied RT sequences from a representative
subset of elements from each CoDi group defined on the
basis of our previous analysis (Additional file 1 and Figure
2) and RT sequences that we identified from the pennate
diatoms Fragilariopsis cylindrus; Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata, and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. A phylogenetic representation of diatom RT domains with those belonging to
the major lineages of LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses (see Materials and Methods) showed that the heterogeneous CoDi6 group appears closest to the major Copia

lineage (Figure 3), which includes sequences from animals, plants, yeast, and heterokonts (diatoms), which
confirms the origin of the Copia lineage as deeply rooted
in eukaryotes. This tree also confirms the distant evolutionary relationships that link the elements from the
CoDiI lineage to the Ty1 and Copia lineages and the even
more distant relationships that link the CoDiII lineage to
these other elements. We also note that the RT sequences
from the other diatoms cluster in the CoDiI, CoDiII and
Copia lineages, and that the Ty3/gypsy-like elements from

T. pseudonana, P. multiseries and P. multistriata also segregate together in a diatom-specific cluster (Figure 3).
Expression of LTR retrotransposons in P. tricornutum
and T. pseudonana
To examine TE expression, the complete nucleotide
sequences of the full length elements from P. tricornutum
listed in Additional file 1 were searched in the diatom digital gene expression database (available at http://
www.biologie.ens.fr/diatomics/EST3/) [19] using BLAST.
This database comprises more than 200,000 ESTs from P.
tricornutum and T. pseudonana cells grown in a range of different conditions, many of which correspond to different
abiotic stresses. The global EST profile of each CoDi group
reveals a pattern of higher expression levels under some
stress conditions (Figure 4). In particular, we focused on
two P. tricornutum CoDi1 lineage elements that were
strongly induced under conditions of nitrate starvation
and following exposure to the toxic reactive aldehyde decadienal (DD) (Figure 4). These were denoted Blackbeard
(Bkb) and Surcouf (Scf), respectively, and the contribution
of CoDi3 and CoDi4 to the nitrate deplete and DD high
libraries are due exclusively to these elements. qRT-PCR
was subsequently used to confirm their upregulation in
response to nitrogen starvation and following exposure to
DD (Table 1).
Regulation of Blackbeard
In an effort to better understand Blackbeard expression in
response to nitrogen limitation, we examined its transcriptional and chromatin-level regulation. Because cisacting elements regulating LTR-RT expression are typically
found within LTRs [20,21], we generated a construct containing the Blackbeard LTR fused to the β-glucoronidase
(GUS) reporter gene. Although the Blackbeard LTR is only
163 bp, spectrophotometric GUS measurements on P. tricornutum lines transformed with this construct showed
that it was sufficient to activate transcription in response
to nitrate starvation (Figure 5A). This shows that the Blackbeard LTR alone contains sufficient cis-regulatory element
information to drive Blackbeard expression in response to
nitrate limitation.

Cytosine methylation is commonly found in the DNA
sequences of transposable elements (at least in genomes
in which methylation occurs) and is thought to be
involved in the heterochromatin formation and maintenance that controls TE mobility. TE mobilization has been
shown to be associated with DNA hypomethylation [2224], and hypomethylation has also been found to accompany active transposition in response to stress [25,26]. We
therefore assessed whether the Blackbeard element was
methylated using McrPCR. In this method, DNA is
digested with McrBC which cleaves DNA containing
methylcytosine. Consequently, PCR using McrBC-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/624

digested DNA as template leads to a decrease of amplification at methylated (cut) loci with respect to untreated
DNA. We first observed that all LTR-RTs tested were methylated in the P. tricornutum genome under normal growth
conditions (data not shown), demonstrating that DNA
methylation does occur in this diatom. We then compared McrPCR amplification levels using DNA extracted
from P. tricornutum cells grown in normal and nitrate limiting conditions. Figures 5B and 5C show that the induction of Blackbeard in response to nitrate limitation was
accompanied by a decrease in cytosine methylation, suggesting that chromatin remodeling occurs at the Blackbeard locus in response to nitrate limitation. Preliminary
results from bisulfite sequencing indicate that methylation at the Blackbeard locus occurs in a CpG context (data
not shown).
Insertion polymorphism between P. tricornutum
accessions
Although suggestive, the induction of Bkb expression by
nitrate limitation is not proof that it can actually drive
genome rearrangements by de novo insertion in the
genome. In order to better evaluate this possibility, we
assessed the distribution of Bkb elements in thirteen P. tricornutum accessions collected from different locations
worldwide by Sequence Specific Amplified Polymorphism (SSAP) [27] (see Materials and Methods). SSAP
amplifies the region between a PCR primer site near the
end of an element and an adjacent restriction site in the
flanking genomic DNA. This global analysis revealed clear
differences in Bkb insertion profiles in different accessions, demonstrating that it has been transposing in natural environments (Figure 6). We were able to confirm the
same phenomenon with two other elements, Scf and
PtC34 (data not shown). We subsequently cloned several
bands from the SSAP gel in order to determine some insertion sites in accessions other than the sequenced genotype
(Additional file 2). None of the sequences we obtained
were inserted inside genes, and most were inserted into
intergenic regions, sometimes very close to coding
sequences. For example, a PtC34 insertion found in Pt6-78 is located 82 bp upstream of the 5' UTR of the gene
encoding uroporphyrinogen-III synthase, which catalyses
the sixth step of heme biosynthesis. We also found several
sequences corresponding to Bkb and Scf inserted into
other TEs (Additional file 2).
Two distinct haplotypes at loci containing TEs
Analysis of sequencing reads around several TE insertion
sites revealed that many were inserted in just one of the
haplotypes and that the other haplotype was apparently
intact. As an example, the Blackbeard insertion is shown in
Figure 7A and Additional file 3. For this (and all other)
insertion events, we could verify by PCR that the allelic
specificity is conserved in all accessions in which they are

found (accessions Pt1, Pt2, Pt3, and Pt9 for Bkb), whereas
in the other accessions we could only detect the empty
locus (Figure 7). Because the oldest of these accessions
was collected more than one hundred years ago [27], we
can conclude that the Bkb insertion must have occurred
before this time.

TE-mediated recombination in the P. tricornutum
genome
To shed light on the potential impact of LTR-RTs on
genome dynamics, we analyzed some signatures of intraor inter-element recombination in the P. tricornutum and
T. pseudonana genomes [28]. Unequal intrastrand homologous recombination between LTRs of different elements
belonging to the same family is a typical example and can
result in a net loss of the DNA in between the elements

involved. Five examples of this were found in our study of
the P. tricornutum genome, all of which resulted in clearly
recognizable recombinant products in which apparently
intact elements with more than 99% identical LTRs lacked
the target-site duplication (TSD) (see Additional file 1)
and were therefore expected to be the product of homologous recombination between two family members. On

the other hand, we found no example of this kind in the
T. pseudonana genome.
We also noticed that the two elements constituting the
CoDi2.3 family, PtC25 (on chromosome 11) and PtC75
(on chromosome 31), both lacked a TSD (Additional file
1). Closer examination of these loci revealed evidence that
these two elements have been co-involved in a recombi-

nation event (Figure 8). Specifically, we found that the 5'
flanking region of PtC25 consists of a truncated CoDi5.3
element and that the 3' flanking sequence of PtC75 also
consists of a truncated CoDi5.3 which is the exact continuation of the PtC25-flanking entity but in addition contains a duplication of an ACAAG motif. The most
parsimonious explanation for this organization is that
either PtC25 or PtC75 inserted inside a CoDi5.3 element
and that this insertion generated duplication of the target
site (ACAAG). Subsequently, PtC25 and PtC75 engaged in
a recombination event that split the CoDi5.3 element into
the two halves found on chromosome 11 and 31.
Furthermore, these two genomic regions contain a group
of 5 orthologs of an unknown gene family (see Figure 8
and Additional file 4). The segment containing the two
copies located on chromosome 31 and their intergenic
region is located less than 1 kb downstream of the
CoDi5.3-like element and is highly similar (>97% identity) to the segment containing two of the copies located
on chromosome 11 and their intergenic region. The
Pt2_50888 gene in fact appears to be the product of
recombination between two distinct orthologs as its
beginning and downstream region is similar to the
Pt2_46949 locus and its end and upstream region appears
most similar to the Pt2_46950 and Pt2_50889 loci (Additional file 4). A >7 kb region between the Pt2_46950 locus
and the CoDi5.3 segment is also duplicated elsewhere in
the genome. These loci therefore provide compelling evidence for TE-mediated recombination events in the P. tricornutum genome.

A high diversity of RT domains from micro-planktonic
organisms
Very little or no data about RT sequences are available
from other eukaryotic clades that include planktonic
organisms of ecological importance such as dinoflagellates and coccolithophores. In order to investigate deeper
the diversity of LTR-RTs that can be found in planktonic
organisms, we used our diatom TE dataset to screen the
CAMERA metagenomic database http://camera.calit2.net/
, which contains sequences from environmental samples
collected during the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) and
Sargasso Sea surveys [29,30]. These sequences are derived
from micro-organisms that were trapped on filters of different sizes (0.1-0.8 μm, 0.22-0.8 μm, 0.8-3.0 μm, 3.020.0 μm) from the surface water of various parts of the
globe including Caribbean Sea, Eastern tropical Pacific,
Galapagos Islands, North American East coast, Polynesia
Archipelagos, and Sargasso Sea. The size of the database
for each filter and at each geographical position is indicated in Figure 9A.

We queried by BLAST our entire set of RT domains against
the CAMERA protein dataset and retrieved a total of 175

each filter size by its cognate sample size, we observed that
the larger the pore size of the filter, the more abundant is
the RT domain, with about 0.18 RT domains per Mb of
sequence from the 3.0-20.0 μm filters (Figure 9B). A total
of 115 of these sequences could be included unambiguously in our RT domain alignment and were used to build
a phylogenetic tree in which we also incorporated RT
sequences from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
and Ostreococcus tauri, the brown alga Aureococcus anophagefferens, and the RT domain from the PyRE10G element
found in the red alga Porphyra yezoensis [31] (Figure 10).
As expected, we observed an enormous diversity within
GOS sequences. It was found that GOS RT domains clustered with all the LTR-RT lineages described here, including the CoDiI and CoDiII lineages. However, RT domains
belonging to the Ty3/gypsy, Copia, and the recently iden-

tified red/aquatic species (RAS) lineage [32] are the most
abundant in the dataset analyzed. We also noticed that the
RAS-like lineage appears to be quite a diverse assemblage
(Figure 10). These RAS-like elements appear to be the
most abundant in the Sargasso Sea samples, especially
from the 0.22-0.8 μm filters (data not shown).

Discussion
In this work, we have identified seven groups of Ty1/copialike LTR-retrotransposons in diatom genomes. Four
groups (CoDi1-2-3 and CoDi7) were found only in the P.
tricornutum genome whereas elements belonging to the
CoDi4-5-6 groups were detected in both diatom genomes.
The presence of both classes suggests either that they were
present in the diatom common ancestor and that the
CoDi1-3 groups became extinct in the lineage leading to
the centric species T. pseudonana, or that representatives of
each group have been separately introduced horizontally
in pennate and centric diatoms. The topology of the tree

Schematic representation of the PtC25 and PtC75 recombinant loci. LTR-RT of the CoDi5.3 (orange) and CoDi2.3
(blue) groups are drawn with their LTRs (flanking arrows). Gene family 1 (green) and gene family 2 (purple) and other genes
(grey) are drawn as arrows. Gene family 1 is further distinguished by red and/or blue bar on top and similar colors indicate similar sequences (see Additional file 4). Black or grey boxes with identical numbers indicate similar intergenic regions. Grey parallelograms project large duplicated regions from chromosome to chromosome. The blue parallelogram indicates the high
similarity between the PtC25 and PtC75 elements. We indicate a 30 bp gap found in the CoDi5.3 segment flanking PtC75. We
also indicate that the PtC25-associated CoDi5.3 entity contains a 5' truncated LTR which starts precisely where the gap
described on chromosome 31 ends, further consolidating the historical link between these two loci. Bd 31.35 indicates a scaffold that could not be successfully mapped during P. tricornutum genome assembly.
presented in Figure 2 shows that CoDi3 and CoDi4 are
bootstrap-supported sister groups that share a common
ancestor after the separation from CoDi1 and CoDi2.
This, together with the fact that we could not detect traces
of diverged remnant copies from the CoDi1-3 groups in
the T. pseudonana genome by BLAST searches (data not
shown) favors the horizontal transfer hypothesis to
explain the presence of CoDi4 elements in the T. pseudonana genome.
Ty3/gypsy-like elements were found in the T. pseudonana
genome but not in the P. tricornutum genome. We also
identified RT sequences corresponding to Ty3/gypsy-like
elements from the pennate diatoms P. multiseries and P.
multistriata which clearly cluster with the GyDi elements

(Figure 3). Although the number of diatom species for
which data is available is low, this suggests that Ty3/gypsylike elements were likely present in the diatom common
ancestor, and that these elements have been lost in P. tricornutum.
Figure 10 shows the retrotransposon sequences found in
the CAMERA dataset. Although the vast majority of the
sequences derived from these environmental genomic
surveys are of bacterial and archaeal origin [30], the
authors counted 69 18S rRNA sequences in the analysis of
the Sargasso Sea data [29] and 98 in the GOS sequence
collection (Doug Rusch, personal communication). Thus,
some small eukaryotes were also present in these datasets.

tions containing the larger cells is consistent with higher
relative eukaryote/prokaryote abundance in these samples. The RT sequences studied display a huge diversity
including some clustering in the CoDiI and CoDiII lineages, which likely testifies for the presence of diatoms in
the samples. The other RT sequences may reflect the diversity of LTR retrotransposons populating the genomes of
diverse tiny marine eukaryotes such as green, red, or
brown algae, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, or euglenoids.
For example, the abundance of RAS-clustering sequences
in the Sargasso Sea fractions may be indicative of the presence of red algae, although analysis of these eukaryotic
fractions did not reveal a particular abundance of red
algae [33]. It will therefore be important to determine
which eukaryotic branch or branches the RAS-like
sequences collected come from. In addition to the CoDiI,
CodiII, and RAS sequences, other discrete clusters shown
in Figure 10 are exclusively composed of RT sequences
from the CAMERA database and are likely to represent RT
domains from organisms for which we have little or no
genomic knowledge.
The mutagenic potential of LTR retrotransposons [34] and
the effects of their accumulation [35] and recombination
[36] together suggest that active retrotransposons may be
major contributors to genome diversification. Accumulated data indicates that retrotransposons in plants [37],
animals and fungi respond to various forms of stress. It
has also been shown in natural wild barley populations
living on each side of a canyon that LTR retrotransposon
dynamics contribute to genome diversity in response to

sharp microclimatic divergence [38]. LTR-RTs are hence
thought to play a key role in long term adaptation of natural populations exposed to stress by generating genetic
diversity within populations. Evidence presented here
suggests that this may also be the case in diatoms. For
example, Blackbeard is one of the most highly expressed
genes in the EST library derived from P. tricornutum cells
grown under nitrate starvation and Surcouf is highly
expressed in response to DD treatment (Table 1, Figure 4).
If these expression levels correlate with completion of the
retrotransposition cycle, which ends with de novo insertions, then nitrate starvation, DD exposure, and perhaps
other environmental stressors could lead to an increase in
genetic diversity in P. tricornutum. LTR-RTs may therefore
be major drivers of genetic diversity in P. tricornutum populations. Although we have not been able to observe de
novo insertion of Bkb or Scf elements following stress, this
claim is supported by the different insertions that have
been observed in P. tricornutum accessions isolated from
different locations around the world (Figure 6).
The significance of these findings is strengthened by the
ecological relevance and common occurrence of stress in
marine environments. Nitrogen is the most widespread
limiting nutrient for marine phytoplankton [39], and
transitions between nitrate starved stratified waters and
nitrate replete upwelling conditions are a major influence
governing marine diatom population oscillations [40].
Conversely, diatom-derived unsaturated aldehydes can
regulate intercellular signalling, stress surveillance, and
defence against grazers [41-43]. Diatoms can sense these

Phylogenetic tree showing the relationships between the reverse transcriptase domains from the CAMERA
database, retroviruses, and LTR retrotransposons. The tree was constructed with the NJ method using the SplitsTree4
software [59]. The bootstrap values were calculated over 1,000 iterations and are indicated for two basal nodes. GOS
sequences are labeled by a two- letter code indicating their geographic provenance: Caribbean Sea (CA), Eastern Tropical
Pacific (ET), Galapagos Islands (GI), Indian Ocean (IO), North American East Coast (NA), Polynesia Archipelagos (PA), Sargasso Sea (SS); followed by a number indicating filter size: 0.1-0.8 (1), 0.22-0.8 (2), 0.8-3.0 (3), 3.0-20.0 (4). These labels appear

aldehydes accurately, whereby subthreshold levels serve
as an early-warning protective mechanism, and lethal
doses initiate a cascade leading to autocatalytic cell death.
Activation of Surcouf only after exposure to high levels of
aldehydes supports a threshold-dependent response in
which activation only occurs under acute stress conditions. Furthermore, the fact that significant aldehyde con-

centrations are only produced by nutrient-stressed and
wounded diatoms suggests a possible role in long term
adaptation to abiotic and biotic stress [44-47].

Conclusions
Sexual reproduction in P. tricornutum has never been documented. Here, we have seen that Blackbeard and Surcouf

Page 13 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:624

insertions occurred at least a century ago and that both (as
well as all other insertions tested; data not shown) have
remained in a heterozygous state until now, in accordance
with rare or absent meiotic cycles and only limited crossing overs between chromosome pairs in P. tricornutum.
The maintenance of LTR-RT insertions in a heterozygous
state in the P. tricornutum genome could increase the
genetic variability between haplotypes and hence enhance
adaptation capacity to changing environments. Furthermore, the observation that the Blackbeard element is
hypomethylated in response to nitrate starvation provides
a direct link between environmental stress and chromatin
remodeling in diatoms. Such phenomena can confer phenotypic plasticity to an individual species, especially if
they are heritable, and may be more useful for environmental adaptation than DNA-based modifications, which
are irreversible and more likely to lead to speciation and
therefore reproductive isolation. It is therefore possible
that epigenetic modifications, combined with TE-mediated genomic rearrangements, maintain population diversity in P. tricornutum, as opposed to sex-driven
chromosomal recombination. The potential capacity of
such processes to monitor and to respond rapidly to
changing environmental conditions may have contributed to the evolutionary and ecological success of diatoms
in contemporary oceans.

Methods
Identification of transposable elements
TE complements from the P. tricornutum http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/Phatr2/Phatr2.home.html and T.
pseudonana
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Thaps3/
Thaps3.home.html nuclear genomes were established by
BLAST search [48] using the Repbase library [49] or single
TE sequences, redundancy search and search for structural
features such as ORFs larger than 1000 amino acids
(which are characteristic of LTR-RT) and subsequent
BLAST comparison with GenBank. When necessary, full
length sequences were determined by examining multicopy alignment. We then searched for the presence of
LTRs upstream and downstream of the DNA sequence corresponding to the ORFs containing a polyprotein. LTR
size sometimes varied by a few nucleotides between pairs
and the length of the longest LTR is reported in Additional
file 1. The target site duplication was examined in the
genomic sequence directly flanking the LTRs. The DNA
sequences between LTR pairs were translated in order to
eventually identify another ORF (denoted ORF1 in Additional file 1) upstream of the ORF containing the polyprotein (ORF2). ORF2 and ORF1 were then submitted to
InterProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/. The
domain composition and order found in ORF2 was established by performing multiple alignments of the putatively active Ty1/copia-like elements from P. tricornutum
and T. pseudonana with Ty1 from yeast and Copia from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/624

fruit fly and of the putatively active Ty3/gypsy-like elements from T. pseudonana with Gypsy from fruit fly, and
Ty3 from yeast.
RT domains from P. multiseries, P. multistriata, F. cylindrus
[50], O. tauri, C. reinhardtii, A. anophagefferens as well as
from the GOS and Sargasso Sea metagenomic surveys
were found using the RT amino acid sequences from the
diatom LTR-RTs identified in this work and a set of RT
domains assembled by Gao and collaborators (including
elements from the Ty3/gypsy, Ty1/copia, DIRS, and BEL
groups) as digital probes in BLAST searches [48] directly
on the respective cDNA, genomic, and metagenomic databases.
Classification based on sequence similarity and structural
features
We included the Blackbeard element in our analysis
although it appears to be haplotype-specific and is absent
from the final assembly of the P. tricornutum genome (see
Results). The seven CoDi groups were divided into 26 distinct families on the basis of nucleotide pairwise distances. Further analysis of these elements revealed
common structural features that were highly similar
within multi-copy families (Additional file 1). Overall,
the full length diatom retroelement sequences measure
between 5182 bp (TpC22) and 8062 bp (PtC26). LTR
length varies from 153 bp to 844 bp in the CoDi4.4 and
CoDi3.2 families, respectively, and percent identity
between LTR pairs varies from 94% to 100%, meaning
that all the elements examined are likely to have inserted
relatively recently in their respective genomes. The LTR
TG/CA terminal inverted repeat is found in 23 out of 26
families and is missing only in CoDi3.2, CoDi4.2 and
CoDi4.3. In some cases, such as the CoDi2.2 family, the
terminal repeat is longer and contains up to 8 conserved
nucleotides. The duplicated target site or direct repeat
(DR) is quite heterogeneous within the groups although
the P. tricornutum elements from the CoDi5 group consistently differ in a few A/T insertions between duplicates (for
which the target site was found). Within the GAG-encoding region of these elements, InterProScan detected tandem CCHC zinc fingers in the elements belonging to the
CoDi6.2-6.3-6.4-6.5 families (this domain is commonly
found within this region of Ty1/copia-like elements).

The selected Ty3/gypsy-like elements from T. pseudonana
represent two rather closely related groups called GyDi1
and GyDi2 (Ty3/Gypsy from Diatoms). Structural features
of these elements are also shown in Additional file 1. We
submitted one element from each family to GenBank
(accession numbers are shown in Additional file 1).

Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments were performed with the CLUSTALW
program [51]. Genetic distances were calculated with the
Poisson correction method [52] for amino acid sequences
and phylogenetic trees were constructed with the Neighbor-Joining method [53]. These evolutionary analyses
were performed with the MEGA4 and SplitsTree4 platforms [54,55].

In addition to the RT sequences identified in this work,
phylogenetic trees presented in Figure 3 includes RT
domains from Ty1/Copia, Ty3/Gypsy, DIRS and BEL LTRRT lineages [56], as well as RT sequences from the Retroviridae human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV),
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), and moloney murine leukaemia virus (MmLV) and from the Caulimoviridae Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and Rice tungro bacilliform
virus (RtBV).
In addition to the sequences used in Figure 3 and 115 RT
sequences from the CAMERA metagenomic database
http://camera.calit2.net/, Figure 5 is built from a CLUSTALW alignment including also four RT sequences from
C. reinhardtii, two from the O. tauri, one RT sequence from
A. anophagefferens http://www.jgi.doe.gov/, and the RT
sequence of the PyRE10G element from P. yezoensis
(AB286055). For all phylogenetic analysis, the residues
used were a modification of those originally identified by
Toh et al. [57,58] in retroviral, human hepatitis B virus
(HBV), cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), and several retrotransposon sequences from Drosophila [10].
Cell culture and accessions
Axenic cultures of P. tricornutum Bohlin clone Pt1 8.6
(CCMP2561) were obtained from the culture collection
of the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of
Marine Phytoplankton, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, USA. Cultures were grown in f/2 medium [59]
made with 0.2-μm-filtered and autoclaved local seawater
supplemented with f/2 vitamins and inorganic nutrients
(filter sterilized and added after autoclaving). Cultures
were incubated at 18°C under cool white fluorescent
lights at approximately 75 μmol.m-2.s-1 constant light and
maintained in exponential phase in semi-continuous
batch cultures. Sterility was monitored by occasional inoculation into peptone-enriched media to check for bacterial growth [60].

In order to evaluate the effect of nitrate stress on Blackbeard mRNA levels, cells were transferred to media modified with 50 μM NO3- and maintained in exponential
phase in semi-continuous batch cultures. Samples were
collected after 24 hrs and after 2 weeks exposure to nitrogen limitation. In order to evaluate the effect of diatomderived reactive aldehydes on Surcouf transcript abun-

dance, 2 liters of exponential P. tricornutum culture was
treated with 2 μg/mL (2E,4EZ )-decadienal (DD) and control culture was treated with equivalent volume of methanol (DD solvent). Samples of 250 mL were collected in
the indicated time points (0, 2, 6, 30, 96 hr) after exposure
to DD treatment. (2E,4E/Z )-decadienal (DD) was
obtained from Acros Organics USA. DD was dissolved in
methanol, and concentrations were determined by measuring absorption at the lambda max for DD of 274 nm,
using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer. Diatom cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at
3,000 g, washed with 12 mL of PBS, aliquoted into 2 mL
Eppendorf tubes, and pelleted for 3 min at 10,000 g. Cell
pellets were frozen instantly in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80°C before proceeding with RNA extraction.
The original sampling location of the P. tricornutum accessions Pt1-10 have been recently described in [27]. We
recently obtained three additional P. tricornutum accessions that we included for our SSAP analysis. Pt11 and
Pt13 were sampled in 2008, respectively, in the Gulf of
Naples and the Gulf of Salerno, Italy. Pt12 was obtained
from the Roscoff culture collection.
SSAP
SSAP experiments were conducted as previously described
[61]. Genomic DNA (500 ng) was digested with MspI and
ligated to an MspI adaptor obtained by the annealing of
two primers (Adap-MspI-C: 5'-CGT TCT AGA CTC ATC-3'
and Adap-MspI-L: 5'-GAC GAT GAG TCT AGA A-3'). SSAP
amplification was done by using a non labeled adaptor
primer Msp1 (5'-GAT GAG TCT AGA ACG GC-3') and one
of the following 33P-labelled LTR primers (Bkb, Scf and
PtC34). Amplified products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and exposed after drying to
Kodak BioMax XAR films (Carestream Health Inc, Rochester). List of LTR primers: Bkb-Rev: 5'-ACG ATA ACC GAC
CAG AAT CG-3' Scf-Rev: 5'-CCC GAA AAA CAT TGC CTC
TA-3' PtC34-Rev: 5'-ATC GGA TCC AGG ACT TTG TG-3'
RNA purification and reverse transcription
mRNA levels of Blackbeard and Surcouf were analyzed
using q-RT-PCR from triplicate samples collected from
biological replicates of nitrate starved or DD-treated exponential grown cultures. Total RNA was extracted from
approximately 108 cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen)
and contaminating DNA was removed with TURBO
DNase via treatment (Ambion), both according to manufacturer's protocols. RNA was then reverse transcribed into
first strand cDNA with the SuperScript™ III First-Strand
Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using oligo-dT
primers. Gene transcription was measured using the Brilliant® SYBR® Green QPCR Core Reagent Kit and the Stratagene MX3000P QPCR machine (Stratagene). Primers used
for real-time PCR were Surcouf Fwd, 5'-CGA CCA CCG

Histone H4 and for TBP (TATA box binding protein)
which served as a housekeeping gene for normalizing
expression of the target gene [62]. For each treatment, we
evaluated each of the housekeeping genes and selected the
one that showed the least amount of variation across conditions.
GUS assay
The pLTRbkb-GUS-FcpA plasmid was constructed from
the FcpBp-GUS-FcpA vector [63] in which the FcpB promoter has been removed by KpnI/SalI digestion and
replaced by ligation with a PCR fragment corresponding
to Blackbeard LTR amplified using the Fwd 5'-CTT AGT
GGT ACC TAG AAA AAC CCC ACG TCA AGC-3' and Rev
5'-CTT AGT GTC GACGAT AAA CTA GAA AAC TGC AAC
GAT AAC-3' and digested with KpnI/SalI. The pLTRbkbGUS-FcpA vector was introduced into P. tricornutum by
microparticle bombardment using a Biolistic PDS-1000/
He Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
as described by Falciatore et al. [63].

For β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays, 7 colonies carrying the
pLTRbkb-GUS-FcpA construct were grown to mid-log
phase in media containing 50 or 882 μM NO3-. Two weeks
after cells were transferred to 50 μM NO3-, 20 ml cultures
were collected by centrifugation at 3,800 rpm for 15 min
at 4°C and resuspended in 120 μl freshly prepared GUS
extraction buffer (50 mM NaPO4 pH 7.0, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100), twice frozen in liquid
nitrogen and thawed at 37°C, and finally centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Soluble proteins were quantified with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. The fresh extracts
were used for spectrophotometric GUS assays performed
by incubating at least 10 μg of total protein extract with
the GUS enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl glucuronide
(PNPG) at a final concentration of 1 mM, in a total reaction volume of 1 ml. After a one hour incubation at 37°C,
the colorimetric reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 ml
2.5 M 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propandiol and the absorbance measured at 415 nm. The enzymatic GUS activity
was calculated on the base of the O.D. recorded and the
molar extinction coefficient of the GUS substrate p-nitrophenol. One unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme that
produces one nanomole of product in one minute at
37°C [64].

weeks. DNA and RNA were extracted from 20 mL of culture for each condition. After cDNA synthesis from RNA
samples (as described above) Blackbeard expression was
verified by semi-quantitative RT PCR using the primers
used for Q-PCR (see above) and primers amplifying the
H4 and RPS housekeeping genes as controls [62]. For
McrPCR, 1 μg of DNA from each sample was incubated
for 1 hour at 37°C with 20 units McrBC endonuclease
supplemented with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin
and 1 mM guanosine triphosphate. Negative controls
were obtained with the same experimental procedure but
replacing guanosine triphosphate with water. The enzyme
was subsequently inactivated by incubation at 65°C for
10 minutes. Digestion efficiency of the Blackbeard locus
was measured by semi-quantitative PCR using forward
genomic primer -AAT ATT GGT CTT CGG CAA CG-3' and
the Blackbeard-specific reverse primer 5'-GCT TCC GTC
AAA CAC TCA CA-3' and we used the primers amplifying
the H4 and RPS genes as controls (see above).
PCR haplotype/accession analysis
Polymerase chain reactions were performed using template DNA extracted from cultures of the ten different P.
tricornutum accessions (see previous). The primers used to
assess the presence of the two different haplotypes at the
Blackbeard locus in DNA extracts from the ten accessions
were the genomic Fwd 5'-AAT ATT GGT CTT CGG CAA
CG-3' paired with the genomic Rev 5'-TTT GAC CCT ATT
GGC TAC CG-3' or paired with the Blackbeard-specific Rev
5'-GCT TCC GTC AAA CAC TCA CA-3'. The primers used
to assess the presence of the two different haplotypes at
the Surcouf locus were the genomic Fwd 5'-TGT CTA TTG
ACA TTT TGG AAG GTG-3'paired with the genomic Rev
5'-AGA TTC ATC AAT GGA TCA TCT CTC-3' or paired
with the Surcouf-specific Rev 5'-GGG TAC CTG CTC CAT
ATG TAG GTT-3'. Additional primer sets were designed for
the other insertions analyzed.
