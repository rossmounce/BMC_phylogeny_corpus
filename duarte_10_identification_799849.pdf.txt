Abstract
Background: Although the overwhelming majority of genes found in angiosperms are members of gene families,
and both gene- and genome-duplication are pervasive forces in plant genomes, some genes are sufficiently
distinct from all other genes in a genome that they can be operationally defined as ‘single copy’. Using the gene
clustering algorithm MCL-tribe, we have identified a set of 959 single copy genes that are shared single copy
genes in the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera and Oryza sativa. To characterize
these genes, we have performed a number of analyses examining GO annotations, coding sequence length,
number of exons, number of domains, presence in distant lineages, such as Selaginella and Physcomitrella, and
phylogenetic analysis to estimate copy number in other seed plants and to demonstrate their phylogenetic utility.
We then provide examples of how these genes may be used in phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct organismal
history, both by using extant coverage in EST databases for seed plants and de novo amplification via RT-PCR in
the family Brassicaceae.
Results: There are 959 single copy nuclear genes shared in Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis and Oryza ["APVO SSC
genes"]. The majority of these genes are also present in the Selaginella and Physcomitrella genomes. Public EST sets
for 197 species suggest that most of these genes are present across a diverse collection of seed plants, and appear
to exist as single or very low copy genes, though exceptions are seen in recently polyploid taxa and in lineages
where there is significant evidence for a shared large-scale duplication event. Genes encoding proteins localized in
organelles are more commonly single copy than expected by chance, but the evolutionary forces responsible for
this bias are unknown.
Regardless of the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the large number of shared single copy genes in
diverse flowering plant lineages, these genes are valuable for phylogenetic and comparative analyses. Eighteen of
the APVO SSC single copy genes were amplified in the Brassicaceae using RT-PCR and directly sequenced. Alignments of these sequences provide improved resolution of Brassicaceae phylogeny compared to recent studies
using plastid and ITS sequences. An analysis of sequences from 13 APVO SSC genes from 69 species of seed plants,
derived mainly from public EST databases, yielded a phylogeny that was largely congruent with prior hypotheses
based on multiple plastid sequences. Whereas single gene phylogenies that rely on EST sequences have limited
bootstrap support as the result of limited sequence information, concatenated alignments result in phylogenetic
trees with strong bootstrap support for already established relationships. Overall, these single copy nuclear genes
are promising markers for phylogenetics, and contain a greater proportion of phylogenetically-informative sites
than commonly used protein-coding sequences from the plastid or mitochondrial genomes.

Conclusions: Putatively orthologous, shared single copy nuclear genes provide a vast source of new evidence for
plant phylogenetics, genome mapping, and other applications, as well as a substantial class of genes for which
functional characterization is needed. Preliminary evidence indicates that many of the shared single copy nuclear
genes identified in this study may be well suited as markers for addressing phylogenetic hypotheses at a variety of
taxonomic levels.

Background
Gene duplication as a pervasive force in the molecular
evolution of angiosperms

As a result of pervasive and recurring small-scale duplications (e.g. local, tandem, segmental) and whole genome duplications [1-3], which may be followed by
functional divergence, many nuclear genes in angiosperms are members of gene families and may exhibit
copy number variation. This complicates the identification of potentially orthologous nuclear genes that could
be used for applications such as molecular systematics
and mapping markers. However, there is a small subset
of genes that appear to persist in low copy numbers,
ranging from 1-4 copies per taxa [4-6]. In the extreme
case are genes that have resolved to single copy within a
few million years after duplication in many independent
lineages. There is evidence from Arabidopsis that genes
that become single copy following genome duplication
are more likely to return to single copy status after subsequent genome duplications [7]. This suggests that
there could be a small subset of single copy nuclear
genes that are single copy throughout much of angiosperm diversity.
However, dosage-insensitive products are also likely at
random to repeatedly return to single copy [8]. If a
small subset (< 15) of sequenced genomes is sampled
for shared single-copy genes, it is likely that a subset of
these genes would be merely shared by chance in single
copy by all the surveyed genomes. As would be predicted, dosage-insensitive gene categories more frequently exhibit copy number variation compared to
dosage-sensitive genes [9]. Thus, dosage-insensitive
genes may be shared by chance in single copy when
comparing a few plant genomes, but in general would
vary greatly in copy number throughout the plant kingdom. As the number of surveyed genomes increases, we
predict that the number of dosage-insensitive genes in
the shared single copy list will steadily decrease. Genes
that encode dosage-insensitive products should ideally
not be used as phylogenetic markers. Dosage-insensitive
genes, shared in single-copy, may be paralogs that
have randomly lost alternate copies since the shared
duplication, which are known to produce artifacts in
phylogenetic reconstruction, including inaccurate reconstructions of organismal history [10]. However, other
genes, which we would term conserved single copy

genes, that are truly shared in single copy (i.e. strict
orthologs) throughout seed plants are ideal nuclear phylogenetic markers. Conserved single copy genes have
previously never been characterized in a large scale, and
possible common mechanisms that repeatedly and convergently return these genes to single copy are still
unknown.
An ancient history of genome duplication in
plant genomes

Whole genome duplications have been inferred in all
angiosperm genomes sequenced to date. Analysis of the
Arabidopsis thaliana genome provides evidence based
on synteny for at least three whole genome duplications
[1,11-14]. Analysis of the Oryza sativa genome suggests
two genome duplications in the evolutionary history of
the genome, one close to the divergence of the Poaceae
and another older duplication [15,16]. The Populus trichocarpa genome shows evidence for three whole genome duplications [17]. The Vitis vinifera genome is
currently interpreted to show evidence of an ancient
hexaploidy event with no recent whole genome duplications [18]. These results, in addition to evidence from
analysis of ESTs in a number of species throughout the
angiosperm tree of life, suggests that polyploidy has
occurred in most if not all major extant angiosperm
lineages [1-3]. Evidence for frequent gene duplication is
also seen in the evolutionary history of numerous gene
families that have expanded during the diversification of
the angiosperms [19-22]. Gene families that retain duplicated genes can provide rich evidence about species
relationships. If the rate of gene duplication and loss is
modest relative to the rate of speciation, gene duplications should result in duplicate gene trees that are reciprocally monophyletic. Additionally, the position of a
gene duplication in a gene tree can itself be valuable
phylogenetic information. But obtaining sequences from
throughout multiple gene families for large numbers of
target species is costly as well as being experimentally
and analytically challenging. The prevalence of duplication in flowering plants means that orthologous loci
without retained duplicates in one or more flowering
plant lineages may be rare. Especially for phylogenetics,
it has been considered important to identify orthologous
sequences. Evidence from yeast indicates that phylogenies based on paralogous genes with asymmetric

Duarte et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/61

divergence are misrepresentations of the organismal
phylogeny [10]. Duplication has been well documented
to result in rate asymmetries in paralogs [10,23,24]. This
rate variation that can confound phylogenetic analysis
by introducing long branch attraction artifacts [10,25].
Although strict orthologs cannot be identified without
intensive study and identification of locus position,
co-orthologs that are single or low-copy may reduce
artifacts introduced by asymmetric divergence after
duplication [10] and can be easier to amplify and
sequence for phylogenetic studies than genes that are
members of gene families.
Previously identified single copy nuclear genes in
flowering plants

Relatively few single copy nuclear genes (in the context
of the entire genome) have been well studied in flowering plants. Shared single copy nuclear genes in flowering
plants are in the unique position of being the closest
semblance of strict orthologs in their genomes, and
therefore are of great interest. Given the amount of
duplication present in flowering plant genomes and
their evolutionary history, orthologous sequences that
are only separated by speciation events and have not
been duplicated since the most recent common ancestor
can be considered to be rare, and the number of genes
that can be considered orthologous decreases dramatically as we compare increasingly distant lineages. The
identification of orthologous sequences is especially relevant for molecular systematics, since the addition of
easily amplified and phylogenetically informative
sequences to current datasets allows for the independent
testing of phylogenetic hypotheses using as much data
as possible. A recent study using high-throughput techniques to identify orthologous sequences in animals
showed improved resolution of the animal tree of life
when putatively single copy nuclear genes were used to
determine the phylogeny and was able to test a variety
of different phylogenetic hypotheses [26].
There has been a significant amount of attention paid
towards the prospect of identifying single copy nuclear
genes in flowering plants, primarily for their potential
use as phylogenetic markers [4-6,27-32]. A number of
low copy nuclear genes have been previously identified
in flowering plants, including the phytochromes, ADH,
TPI, GAP3DH, LEAFY, ACCase, PGK, petD, GBSSI,
GPAT, ncpGS, GIGANTEA, GPA1, AGB1, PPR and
RBP2, primarily for their use as phylogenetic markers
[5,32-46]. Evidence from wheat indicates that duplicated
low-copy genomic regions, which may include low-copy
genes similar to those in the present study, are rapidly
eliminated following polyploidization [47]. In the rare
instances in which duplicated copies of single or low
copy genes are maintained over long evolutionary

Page 3 of 18

periods (tens of millions of years), paralogs show distinct
patterns of functional and/or expression divergence. For
example, over expression of LEAFY generally results in
early flowering [48,49] and cases in which LEAFY is present in duplicate (typically in recent polyploids), expression patterns are typically complementary, suggesting
that subfunctionalization may be necessary for the maintenance of both loci [50,51].
Current tools for phylogenetic analysis in angiosperms

Molecular systematics in flowering plants has been
dominated by the use of phylogenetic markers derived
from the plastid genome (e.g., rbcL, matK. ndhF, trnL-F)
or ribosomal DNA (18S, 26S, ITS, ETS). The predominant use of plastid and ribosomal DNA markers limits
the number of genes available phylogenetic analysis.
Typically only angiosperms with sequenced genomes are
included in taxon sets for large eukaryotic tree of life
datasets [52,53]. Although the majority of phylogenetic
markers used in angiosperms are from the plastid or
mitochondrial genomes, low copy nuclear genes have
been sought after as phylogenetic and mapping markers
[4,29,30,54]. The incorporation of nuclear markers to a
combined dataset including plastid and ribosomal DNA
markers should improve the robustness of phylogenetic
reconstructions at all taxonomic levels by increasing the
total number of informative characters (i.e. increasing
phylogenetic signal) [30]. For example, a combined analysis of multiple low-copy nuclear genes did provide an
improved and robust phylogeny that failed to fully
resolve using cpDNA and nrDNA sequence data [55].
Further, nuclear genes are necessary to detect hybridization, introgression events, and ancient allopolyploidization events [30,56]. Ribosomal DNA markers, which
undergo concerted evolution, are unreliable for reconstructing ancient allopolyploidization events [30]. However, both recent and ancient gene duplications have
complicated the identification of low-copy genes. Nonetheless, the nuclear genome is an important source of
genetic diversity that can be used to establish phylogenetic relationships between species, genera, families, and
deeper lineages, and resolve the timing of landmark
events such as the origin of angiosperms [57,58] and
origin of eukaryotes[52,59,60]. For instance, previous
studies indicate that intron sequences from nuclear
genes such as LFY, ACCase, PGK, petD, GBSSI, GPAT,
ncpGS and others are at least as useful as ITS or plastid
intron/spacer sequences in resolving family-level phylogenies and in many cases are more informative than ITS
and plastid intron or spacer sequences [34,42,43]. However, because of lineage-specific duplications, datasets
using protein-coding nuclear genes to resolve relationships across all angiosperms are limited (but see PHYC
[57,58]; Pires, unpublished data) and analyses of

Duarte et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/61

organellar and ribosomal markers are more typical.
Recently, whole plastid genome sequencing, has been
used to decipher the angiosperm tree of life [61,62].
Studies using genes that are members of gene families
are excellent for identifying duplication events that can
be used as synapomorphies and using the greatest
amount of data available, since the majority of genes in
the nuclear genome of flowering plants are members of
gene families [2,18,63-67]. However, there are several
technical limitations concerning the use of genes that
are members of larger gene families. In large informaticbased studies, it can be difficult to eliminate noise, identify closest co-orthologs and select appropriate models
of sequence evolution. In traditional PCR-based amplification of phylogenetic markers, the co-occurrence of
paralogs results in increased efforts to isolate and
sequence all available members of the gene family, with
increased time spent in amplification and cloning to
separate sequences from different members of the same
gene family. However, it is possible that members of
gene families can be used for phylogenetic purposes if
copy number is stable and orthology can be easily
assessed[32].
In this paper, we describe analyses of a set of shared
single copy nuclear genes identified in four sequenced
angiosperm genomes. The first analysis utilizes EST
contigs and sequences from the TIGR Plant Transcript
Assemblies to investigate the utility of 18 shared single
copy nuclear genes for deep phylogenetic analysis, as
well as to identify the occurrence and timing of lineagespecific duplications. This application of the shared single copy genes will provide information about whether
these genes are suitable for use as phylogenetic markers
and whether these genes have the ability to provide phylogenetically informative sequences. The second analysis
is a family-level phylogeny in the Brassicaceae based on
sequences for a set of shared single copy genes that
have been amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. The
mustard family (Brassicaceae, 338 genera, 3,700 species)
is an ideal system to test the utility of these shared single-copy nuclear genes for phylogenetic studies and to
test if these genes have repeatedly returned to a single
copy state following multiple whole genome duplication
and diploidization events. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome harbors signatures of at least three rounds of whole
genome duplication [1,11-14], and the “diploid” Brassica
species have undergone additional duplication events
[68,69]. A paleopolyploid event occurred approximately
40 mya near the origin of the family (the alpha event in
Arabidopsis, [70]), while the Arabidopsis beta event
occurred within the order Brassicales following the
divergence from papaya [8,71], and a more recent putative triplication event is shared within the tribe Brassiceae that occurred 7.9-14.6 mya [68-70].

Summary

In the face of local, tandem, segmental, and whole genome duplications, non-random gene loss may maintain
some genes in low copy number [7,65,72]. The number
of single copy genes shared among the four genomes
investigated here is higher than expected if one assumes
that all duplicate gene pairs are equally likely to lose
one copy following genome-wide duplication events
[72]. This observation could be explained by selection
for the retention of dosage-sensitive duplicates to maintain dosage balance following genome duplication in
which case the shared single copy genes may represent
a random subset of genes that are free to be lost following duplication. Alternatively, there may be selection to
conserve some genes as singletons in plant genomes. Of
course, these are not mutually exclusive hypotheses. In
either case, we predict that RT-PCR amplification of
multiple single copy nuclear genes will yield many single
copy genes with sufficient phylogenetic information to
resolve family-level phylogenies. At the same time,
researchers must remain aware of the impact that paralogous genes may have on phylogenetic inference.

Results
Shared single copy genes are numerous in angiosperm
genomes, as well as in other plant lineages

We first determined the number of single copy genes in
each of the four species with whole genome sequences:
Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis and Oryza, and found 4762 to
7542 genes (Figure 1 and Additional File 1). The numbers
of single copy genes shared between any two of the four
species were much smaller, from 1424 to 2796, particularly
when Populus was included. Single copy genes shared in
any three species or all four species decreased further, but
only slightly (Figure 1). This suggests that the entire
shared single copy genes list is not composed of a random
set of genes, with 959 genes shared between Arabidopsis,
Populus, Vitis and Oryza (APVO) as defined by the number of PlantTribes [63] at stringency 3.0 that contain a single member from each respective genome (Figure 1 and
Additional File 1). Examination of the TIGR Plant Transcript assemblies [73] indicates that these genes are also
present throughout angiosperms, although exact copy
number cannot be ascertained since EST assemblies are
not an accurate estimate of copy number. For example,
the average number of plant transcript assemblies per single copy PlantTribe for Arabidopsis and Oryza are 1.22
and 1.51, respectively (Additional file 2). Assemblies for
taxa with hundreds of thousands of ESTs very likely identify some allelic and splice-site variants (vs. true duplicates) as distinct transcripts.
We characterized duplication events in gene phylogenies
for eighteen shared single copy genes identified in the
sequenced genomes and with particularly good overlap in

sequence availability through the major angiosperm
groups. We found that duplicate copies (paralogs and coorthologs) were restricted to recent polyploidy lineages.
Lineage-specific paralogous and co-orthologous pairs
represented independent duplications in the Asteraceae,
Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Gossypium (Additional file 3).
Comparison of the set of shared single copy genes identified in this study to a set of single copy and low-copy
nuclear genes that have been commonly used for angiosperm phylogenetics [5,37-44,57,58] indicates that few previously-utilized phylogenetic markers (such as LFY) are
members of APVO shared single copy PlantTribes - i.e.
the set of previously used phylogenetic markers typically
belong to PlantTribes in which copy number varies among
the four genomes examined and/or these phylogenetic
markers are members of larger gene families.
When we consider the four angiosperm genomes
along with those of two additional land plants, Selaginella (a lycophyte, or early divergent vascular plant),
Physcomitrella (a moss, or non-vascular plant), there are
395 PlantTribes that include a single gene from each of
the six genomes. When copy number in Selaginella or

Physcomitrella is not restricted to one, there are 699
shared single-copy APVO PlantTribes that are present
in Selaginella and 558 shared single-copy APVO PlantTribes that are present in Physcomitrella. Even when
considering the distant algal species Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, 362 shared single-copy APVO PlantTribes
are present in Chlamydomonas with one or two copies.
When the TIGR Plant Transcript Assemblies are considered, which include a wide range of green algae and
terrestrial plants, 438 APVO PlantTribes have at least
one hit in a non-seed land plant species and 190 APVO
PlantTribes have at least one hit in a green algal (chlorophyte or charophyte) species (Table 1 and also additional file 4). Therefore, large subsets of the shared
single-copy PlantTribes might have been maintained in
diverse photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms for as many
as 1,000 million years.
Shared single copy genes have distinguishing
characteristics compared to the rest of the genome

To obtain clues of possible functions of the shared single copy genes, we analyzed their GO slim categories

genes present and distribution of count numbers for various taxonomic
groups. The eurosids include members from both Rosids I and II; core

monocots; basal angiosperms include members of the magnoliids as well as
Amborella trichopoda and Nuphar advena; gymnosperms includes conifers,
cycads, Ginkgo and Gnetales; Vascular plants include representatives from
ferns, mosses and hornwort; and green algae include members of both

(Figure 2). The APVO shared single copy genes are
overrepresented in the following GO slim categories:
chloroplast, mitochondria, plastid, other intracellular
components, other cytoplasmic components, other
enzyme activity, DNA or RNA metabolism, unknown
molecular function and unknown biological processes.
Shared single copy genes are significantly underrepresented in several GO categories: other membranes,

Page 6 of 18

unknown cytoplasmic components, nucleus, transporter
activity, nucleic acid binding, other molecular functions,
transcription factor activity, kinase activity, other biological processes, protein metabolism, transport, transcription, response to abiotic or biotic stimulus and signal
transduction. This corresponds with findings that
retained duplicates tend to encode proteins with known
functions such as subunits of macromolecular complexes (e.g. structural constituents of ribosomes), proteins with regulatory functions (e.g. transcription
factors), and highly-connected signaling components
especially those with opposing functions in networks
(e.g. kinase and phosphatase) [8,74-76]. These results
also mirror the result obtained by analysis of conserved
ortholog sets (COSII) identified in the euasterid clade
that indicate an association of single copy genes with
genes targeted to the chloroplast and mitochondria, as
well as genes associated with DNA and/or RNA metabolism [6].
Shared single copy genes from APVO PlantTribes
have more exons than other genes (p < 0.00001, 2-tailed
Student’s t-test with unequal variances). This result
holds when intronless, possibly retrotransposed genes
are excluded from the analysis. Another notable distinction of the APVO PlantTribes is the smaller number of
PFAM domains present in the shared single copy genes
relative to the other genes in the sequenced genomes
(p < 0.00001, 2-tailed Student’s t-test with unequal variances). However, there is no significant difference in
cDNA length (p = 0.998, 2-tailed Student’s t-test with
unequal variances). In summary, the shared single copy

Duarte et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:61

genes are structurally complex genes, with a greater
number of exons present in the coding sequence. However, they do not appear to be functionally complex, as
they have fewer recognized domains per gene than the
rest of the genome.
Shared single copy genes can be valuable phylogenetic
markers for plant families

For successful use of these shared single copy genes in
molecular systematics, it must be demonstrated that
they can be easily amplified and sequenced in a range of
taxa. In order to test this, we designed primers to
amplify 12 genes in the Brassicaceae. When cDNA templates were used with degenerate primers, single bands
of identical size were recovered across all of the taxa
that yielded amplicons (Table 2). Direct sequencing of
these loci yielded sequences with minor polymorphisms.
These polymorphisms could be allelic or from multiple
loci. In contrast, when genomic DNA was used as templates, 1 to 3 bands were recovered (Table 2). These
genomic bands varied in size both across and, when
more than one was detected, within the taxa. We amplified these 12 genes only for a subset of taxa to survey
copy number variation in the family. The sequences of
the RT-PCR amplification products were used for phylogenetic analysis. Sequence of a number of the genomic
bands revealed either additional genomic copies that
have pseudogenized, or completely unrelated sequence,
but only one expressed copy that corresponded to the
sequence from the RT-PCR derived sequence (results
not shown).
A combined and complete data-matrix containing
genes At2 g32520, At2 g13360, and At5 g23290 homologs for each of the twelve taxa yielded a single mostparsimonious tree with the exact predicted and previously
supported topology (Figure 3) [77-79] but with increased
bootstrap support at deeper nodes than previously published phylogenies. The tribe Brassiceae had a 100% bootstrap statistical support and a 100% bootstrap support
that the tribe is sister to the tribe Sisymbrieae. The Brassiceae + Sisymbrieae clade located within lineage II, had a
99% bootstrap support to the relative position to
the Camelinae tribe located within lineage I, and the lineage I and lineage II clade had a 100% bootstrap support
for a sister relationship to Chorisporeae (lineage III).
Shared single copy genes are valuable phylogenetic
markers across angiosperms

As mentioned briefly above, homologs of the shared single copy genes are well represented in the Plant Transcript Assemblies [73], which at the time of this analysis
include over 13 million plant ESTs from 233 species.
Given this rich resource of sequence information, we
examined in more detail the presence and distribution

Page 7 of 18

of homologs of shared single copy genes in this dataset.
We compare the EST data and Unigene numbers with
the known gene copy number from the Arabidopsis,
Populus, Vitis and Oryza genomic sequences, and found
that the numbers of Unigenes vary substantially from
gene copy numbers from the genome sequences - most
likely resulting from sequencing error, assembly errors,
number of ESTs, alternative splicing, allelism and other
such factors. Using a set of criteria (see Methods)
designed to maximize sequence coverage and quality for
each dataset, we used phylogenetics to help distinguish
between species-specific duplicates (which could result
from either technical error, alleles or an actual recent
duplication event) and shared duplication events that
could reveal if there are patterns of maintenance of
duplicate copies in particular lineages. Because this process requires extensive manual inspection of the alignments, a limited number (eighteen) of genes were
selected for the phylogenetic analysis. These eighteen
genes were selected because there were full-length EST
sequences available across the major lineages of
angiosperms.
We found that single gene phylogenies provide wellsupported resolution at the level of plant families (Table
3). Specifically, the large plant families Fabaceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, and Solanaceae, all of which are well
represented in the Plant Transcript Assemblies, are
strongly supported in the single gene phylogenies (Additional File 3). Shared duplications in a particular lineage
are also present in five of the individual gene phylogenies; these genes were excluded from the subsequent
concatenated alignment. Such shared duplications within
a lineage are associated with paleopolyploidy events that
occurred within particular lineages [1,3]. It should be
noted that even though many members of Poaceae are
well represented in the Plant Transcript Assemblies and
multiple sequences from a single species were typically
included in the single gene alignment, there were no
cases of shared duplications within this plant family multiple sequences from the same species were more
closely related to each other than to sequences from
other species (Additional File 3). Moreover, there are no
duplications that involve more than a single plant family
- evidence for duplications that occurred prior to diversification of the extant plant families is not present in
these datasets. This supports the idea that duplicates of
these genes do not persist over evolutionary time and
the presence of more than one gene copy within a taxon
is most likely the result of relatively recent duplication
events. If gene loss did not occur soon after duplication,
however, it is possible that the genes retained in different lineages are paralogous. This may result in well-supported conflict among gene trees. In our analyses,

angiosperm phylogeny, such as Acorus falling within
magnoliids instead of a basal position within monocots,
have poor bootstrap support (<70%).
In contrast to the individual gene phylogenies, phylogenetic trees based on a concatenated alignment of 13
of the shared single copy genes (Figure 4) show
improved resolution and are similar to recently reported
phylogenies [61,62,80,81] though there are significant
differences with the placement of individual species
between the MP and ML trees. Overall, the ML tree
shows improved resolution and increased bootstrap support compared to the MP tree (Table 3). The eurosids,
asterids, and monocots are all resolved as monophyletic
(Figure 4). All plant families with multiple species present in the datasets are resolved as monophyletic with
strong bootstrap support. In all cases in which multiple
members of a genus are included in the analysis, genera

are resolved as monophyletic with strong bootstrap support. Eurosids I and II are paraphyletic with the Sapindales (Eurosid II) sister to a clade containing the
Malpighiales (Eurosid I) with poor bootstrap support
(below 50% in MP and 53% in ML). Aside from the placement of the Malpighiales, the rest of the eurosid II
lineage is monophyletic. Vitales are basal to the eurosids
with poor bootstrap support (<50%). Euasterids I and II
are both monophyletic with strong bootstrap support.
The position of the caryophillid Beta is not stable, nesting within the eurosid II clade in the MP phylogeny
and sister to the Asterids in the ML phylogeny, with
below 50% bootstrap support for both placements.
Ranunculales are sister to all core eudicots with strong
support in the ML analysis and moderate support in the
MP analysis. Within the monocots, Acorus is basal, with
Zingiber sister to the Poaceae. Limited resolution at

Figure 3 Single copy nuclear genes improve phylogenetic resolution in the Brassicaceae. A single most-parsimonious tree was found
from combined analysis of complete data-matrix containing genes At2 g32520, At2 g13360, and At5 g23290 (L = 961, consistency index =
0.774, retention index = 0.529). Bootstrap values are shown above branches. Note that individual gene trees gave similar topologies. The
phylogeny is consistent with published phylogenies using more taxa and other molecular markers. Bootstrap values from Beilstein et al., 2006 are
shown below branches.

basal nodes, such as the affiliation of the core eudicots,
magnoliids and basal angiosperms, is expected to be the
result of the limited amount of sequence information
available for these lineages. Magnoliids are sister to the
eudicots, with poor bootstrap support, contrary to their
placement sister to the monocots + eudicots in whole
plastid genome datasets [61,62]. The ordering of
Amborella and Nuphar switches between the MP and
ML tree, with below 50% support for Amborella as the
basalmost angiosperm in the MP phylogeny and with
52% bootstrap support for Nuphar as the basalmost
angiosperm in the ML phylogeny. Gymnosperm relationships are un-informative given the rooting of the

tree with Picea sitchensis and the limited taxon sampling since there was not a sufficient coverage of the
target genes for members of the Zamiales, Ginkgoales
and Gnetales.

Discussion
There is a large number of shared single copy nuclear
genes in plant genomes

Because of pervasive gene duplication in the angiosperms, the observation of hundreds of shared single
copy nuclear genes in the sequenced genomes we have
examined raises interesting biological questions. It is
unlikely that any gene identified in this study is single

copy in every extant angiosperm, given the frequency of
gene duplication and the time required to resolve gene
duplication events. However based on the skewed distribution towards certain GO terms (e.g. plastid and mitochondrial functions) for this list of shared single copy
nuclear genes, the data suggests that the list may contain a set of single-copy genes that are not shared at
random (i.e. conserved single copy genes). This will be
discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. Overall,
this study provides hundreds of genes for which further
characterization and research could greatly improve our
understanding of the molecular evolution of genes in
flowering plants, the functional and evolutionary impact
of gene duplication, and provide new tools for plant
biologists, especially in the realm of molecular
systematics.
Shared single copy genes have different characteristics
than singletons

A previous study on singletons present in the Oryza and
Arabidopsis genomes [7], but not necessarily conserved
as singletons between the two genomes yielded results
that do not correspond to the findings presented in this
paper. The singletons presented in Chapman et al. [7]
are significantly shorter than genes with a duplicate.
However, our analysis of Arabidopsis genes indicates
that there is no significant difference in cDNA length

between shared single copy genes and all other genes.
To some degree, the difference in approach for identifying single copy genes may provide a clue as to the difference in results. Chapman et al. [7] identified single
copy genes (singletons) in individual genomes, whereas
the single copy genes in this study were identified by
requiring the gene to be single copy in four genomes as
an added criterion. This suggests that there may be significantly different molecular characteristics for shared
and non-shared singletons within an individual genome
as a result of differential molecular evolution of these
two subsets of single copy genes. It is possible that
some of the singletons identified by Chapman et al. [7]
are unique to their genome or lineage, or that the
homologous sequence in another genome has paralogs.
The only common characteristic between the shared
singletons and the non-shared singletons is a decreased
number of protein domains - however this could be the
result of poor characterization and annotation of genes
that are not members of large gene families. It is of note
that the functional overrepresentation of shared single
copy genes in slim GO categories is highly similar to
the results found by Wu et al [6] for clusters of singletons in the Asterids that were verified as single copy in
Arabidopsis, which they named conserved ortholog sets
(COSII). Therefore, there could be significant similarities
between genes that experience nonrandom gene loss

after duplication and genes that experience random
genes loss after duplication.
An increased average number of exons in shared single copy genes would be consistent with a hypothesis
that intron loss is facilitated by retrotransposition and
gene conversion in gene families [82], but this idea
remains speculative, and should be subjected to rigorous
testing. In the absence of paralogs, we hypothesize that
introns are more stable in shared single copy genes than
introns in genes that are members of gene families. This
aspect of intron evolution in shared single copy genes
could be very important for their utility in phylogenetic
studies, since intronic sequences can be a useful tool for
species identification and classification.
Evolution of shared single copy nuclear genes against a
background of polyploidy

The reduced number of single copy genes found when
Populus was included in the analysis can be attributed
to the relatively recent genome duplication in Populus

together with the slower rate of evolution in the woody
plant Populus relative to rice and Arabidopsis [83]. Substantial differences in the rates of molecular evolution in
different plant lineages observed by Smith and Donoghue could lead to differences in how long it takes for a
duplicated gene to return to single copy through either
through random or unknown nonrandom (selective)
processes. Some portion of this can be attributed to the
degeneration of one of the duplicates according to neutral evolution and population genetics parameters [84].
However, the conservation of many of these genes as
single copy throughout the angiosperms, as evidenced
by their representation and distribution in the broad
EST-based phylogenies from this study, suggests that
nonrandom processes could be involved in maintaining
their single copy status. For example, variance in copy
number may relate to variance in the strength of negative selection against more than one copy after duplication. It is also plausible that a number of these shared
single copy genes are only coincidently single copy in

Duarte et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/61

more than one genome, having returned to single copy
after duplication through genetic drift if there is selection to maintain most genes as duplicates following genome duplication [72]. Unfortunately, the small number
of sequenced genomes and incomplete functional characterization for a number of these genes does not allow
us to make a firm conclusion on which evolutionary
forces predominate in the evolution of these genes or
whether any given gene is single copy as the result of
random loss or selection. Ideally, functional characterization and population genetic studies of this class of
genes as well as more sequenced genomes will in the
future provide more evidence about the respective roles
of selection and drift on the evolution of these genes
after duplication.
The strong association between organellar (chloroplast
and mitochondria) targeted gene products and the
shared single copy genes identified in this study supports
a hypothesis that coordination of protein complexes
such as those involved in electron transport in both the
plastid and mitochondrion requires an evolutionarilystable copy number, since these nuclear-encoded proteins interact with organellar-encoded proteins. However
it is unclear how dosage in the nuclear genome (one
nucleus per cell) and dosage in the plastid genome
(many plastids per cell, each containing many plastid
genomes) is coordinated. This hypothesis extends the
gene balance hypothesis by invoking the specific complexity of protein complexes that include members from
both the nuclear genome and the organellar genomes
[85-88].
Although some of the genes identified in this study
may be present as single copy as the result of random
processes, additional data obtained from our phylogenetic analysis of EST sequences of a subset of these
genes from a wide range of angiosperms suggests that
the single copy status of some of these genes is non-random. Cases that are indicative of ancient duplication are
limited to clades for which ancient polyploidization
events have been hypothesized that coincide with the
duplication of single copy genes, such as the Asterids,
Fabaceae, and Gossypium (see Additional File 3). By
focusing on sequences obtained through transcriptome
sequencing or RT-PCR, we have focused on expressed
copies of these single copy genes. However, we hypothesize that in genomes with recent duplication events
there will be multiple loci present for any gene, including the shared single copy genes. It may take millions of
years for duplicated loci to resolve to a single locus however, silencing of duplicated loci such that only a
single locus is actively expressed is expected to occur
relatively quickly after duplication [47,89-91].
The expressed copy of At2 g32520 was aligned to
non-expressed genomic DNA copies for several taxa in

Page 12 of 18

the Brassicaceae that were cloned and sequenced. This
comparison revealed not only which genomic DNA
copy was expressed but also that the non-expressed
copies displayed evidence of pseudogenization by having
acquired numerous point mutations, insertions, and
deletions likely resulting in gene loss through sequence
degeneration. Many of the taxa are relatively recent
polyploids, and it is difficult to conclude if the few polymorphisms observed in some of the sequences from the
directly sequenced bands from RT-PCR are allelic or
from duplicate copies. However, this analysis did display
putative evidence for the loss of duplicate copies from
past duplication events, inferred from the presence of
multiple pseudogenized genomic loci.
These previous observations suggest that these ‘single
copy’ genes have convergently returned to a single copy
state following whole genome duplication events. The
individual gene trees show this pattern, as well as illustrating differences in the resolution of whole genome
duplication events. All of the inferred gene duplications
present in the individual gene trees are coincident with
whole genome duplications that have been demonstrated by either K s distributions of ESTs or syntenic
chromosomal blocks [1,3,15,16,69]. In lineages where
tandem or segmental duplication is inferred to be more
prevalent than whole genome duplications, such as the
monocots (specifically the Poaceae [16]), multiple
sequences from a single species are more closely related
to each other than sequences from a different species.
This indicates that if duplicates are actually present in a
genome (not detectable using ESTs), they are recent in
origin and did not originate during a shared duplication
event. Overall, these results suggests that typically genome-scale duplications are associated with maintenance
of more than one locus for this class of genes - however
more research is required to determine if this trend
extends to all shared single copy genes, since the phylogenetic analysis was limited to a small number of shared
single copy genes. However, it must be determined if
genes within this set are in fact dosage-sensitive (i.e.
conserved single copy genes that are under selection to
return to single-copy) or dosage-insensitive (i.e. returned
at random to single-copy) in order to understand
whether the gene balance hypothesis is applicable.
Shared single copy genes are a valuable new source of
phylogenetic information from the nuclear genome

This study emphasizes the utility and ease of using single copy APVO PlantTribes for phylogenetic studies.
The Brassicaceae has been recently divided into 25
tribes that are mostly grouped into four monophyletic
lineages [77,79]. The tribe Aethionemeae containing
Aethionema saxatile is the tribe sister to the remainder
of the family [77-79]. Lineage I contains eight tribes,

Duarte et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/61

including the tribe Camelineae with Arabidopsis thaliana and Olimarabidopsis pumila. Lineage II contains
four tribes, including the agronomically important tribe
Brassiceae with Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea, Brassica repanda, Moricandria arvensis, Schouwia thebaica,
and Erucastrum canariense. The tribe Brassiceae is
thought to have an ancient hexaploid event, while the
sister tribe Sisymbrieae represented by Sisymbrium irio
does not share this ancient polyploidy event [69]. Lineage III includes four primarily Asian tribes including the
tribe Chorisporeae and there are also tribes that have
not been assigned to any of these three lineages [77].
The combined and complete data matrix of three single
copy nuclear genes (At2 g32520, At2 g13360, and At5
g23290) yielded a single most-parsimonious tree with
strong bootstrap support that is consistent with published phylogenies using more taxa and other molecular
markers in the Brassicaceae [77-79]. Individual gene
trees gave similar topologies.
Although individual gene trees do not provide sufficient resolution for deep nodes across the seed plant phylogeny (Additional file 3), the combined data matrix of
thirteen single copy nuclear genes across 69 seed plants
yields a phylogenetic tree with good resolution, given the
overall size of the data matrix and the amount of overlap
in sequence between different taxa. In a general sense,
the resulting phylogeny from the combination of these
thirteen single copy genes agrees with recent results from
large datasets based on whole plastid genome sequences
[61,62]. It is expected that improved sampling at basal
nodes would improve the resolution of the resulting phylogeny, since current EST resources for these taxa are
considerably less than EST resources available for crop
species in the Poaceae and eurosids, for which coverage
is excellent. An important result from the EST-based
phylogenies is that these nuclear genes are a rich source
of phylogenetic information - they include a high percentage of variable and parsimony-informative characters,
and extended branch lengths at deeper nodes within the
trees (Table 3). Although the dataset presented in this
study is limited to small number of genes, the methodology presented of using shared single copy genes for phylogenetics using sequences from public databases could
be expanded to utilize all of the shared single copy
nuclear genes with automation of the alignment and
sequence selection methods.
Our focus on shared single copy genes reflects an
experimentally tractable and relatively conservative
approach to leveraging the phylogenetic information
present in large sequence datasets. The Tribe-based
approach we describe here could readily be extended to
identify and incorporate genes from stable lineages
within any gene family. For example, preliminary phylogenetic screening of stable tribes with 2, 3, 4, or more

Page 13 of 18

genes in a Tribe could be used to indentify putatively
orthologous sets of genes that are reciprocally monophyletic and repeatedly estimate the organismal
phylogeny.
We predict that in contrast to other studies which have
used alternative clustering methods and have incorporated
sequences for which paralogs are present, high-throughput
phylogenetics using shared single copy genes will exhibit a
stronger signal to noise ratio and minimize conflict within
the analysis. However, it remains to be tested how results
from high throughput phylogenetics utilizing only shared
single copy genes will compare to results that include
genes that are members of gene families. Such inclusion
will greatly expand the quantity of data that can be
included from genome and transcriptome sets. The continuing decline in the cost of high throughput “Next Generation” sequencing methods ensures that many more
large scale transcriptome datasets will become available in
the near future for these and other genome-enabled
approaches to plant phylogenetics.

Conclusions
The identification of shared single copy nuclear genes is
important for many reasons, given their unique status in
genomes full of paralogs. Even though their origin and
molecular evolution are of continuing interest, shared
single copy nuclear genes have a series of immediate,
valuable applications as mapping markers, quality control for genomic libraries, and phylogenetic markers. As
single copy loci, these genes can provide important
genomic landmarks for mapping of other genes or features in the genome, and can be used as control
sequences to identify the amount of coverage provided
by a given genomic or transcriptomic library. However,
their potentially greatest impact application is for molecular phylogenetics within the angiosperms, and perhaps
deeper, since most are found in a diverse set of angiosperm EST studies (Additional file 2) and approximately
half can be detected in the non-seed plant lineages
(Additional file 1).
Since most current molecular systematic studies in
angiosperms are based on plastid and non-coding nuclear
sequences, it is important to know whether protein-coding
nuclear genes provide complementary support to these
studies, or conflict. The complexity of gene families in
angiosperm genomes has deterred researchers from using
nuclear genes in phylogenetic reconstruction in angiosperms on a regular basis because of the difficulty of isolating all members of a gene family using laborious cloning
methods in each taxon to obtain accurate phylogenetic
reconstructions [4]. Given the dynamic evolutionary history of plant nuclear genes as a result of recombination,
gene conversion, duplication and endosymbiotic gene
transfer, it is not yet clear whether phylogenies based on

Duarte et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/61

nuclear-encoded proteins will be congruent with phylogenies based on plastid-encoded proteins. However, the
results from this study show no compelling evidence of a
conflict between phylogenies derived using plastid data
and the phylogenies presented. By comparing and combining data from single copy nuclear genes with plastid genes,
mitochondrial genes, and ribosomal DNA markers, we
will have a better understanding of the diversification of
flowering plants.
Shared single copy nuclear genes are an important tool
for understanding angiosperm phylogeny and are applicable across a wide range of taxonomic levels. Both coding
and intron sequences from these genes are phylogenetically informative and genes can be easily amplified and
sequenced using RT-PCR or PCR, or extracted from genomes or EST databases. It is now necessary to expand
our knowledge of these genes by sampling them in
diverse lineages in order to fully appreciate their phylogenetic utility.

Methods
Identification of shared single copy nuclear genes in
sequenced plant genomes

We identified shared single copy nuclear genes using a
high throughput comparative genomic approach, using
available data from the Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis and
Oryza genomes. The Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis and
Oryza proteomes (as described in [63]) were compared
against each other using “all by all” BLASTP [92]. Genes
were clustered into ‘tribes’, an approximation of gene
families, using TRIBE MCL [63,93,94] at medium (Inflation I = 3.0) stringency. This procedure uses the graphbased Markov clustering algorithm MCL, in which a
transformation of the symmetric matrix containing the
average pairwise -log10E-values is taken through a series
of matrix multiplication and inflation steps. The result
is an objective global classification of proteins from the
combined sample. Additional details and validation studies of the classification procedure are provided in
Enright et al, 2002, Enright et al. 2003, and Wall et al.
2007 [63,93,94]. Wall et al. provide two specific examples of the relationship between tribe stringency and the
hierarchical structure of tribes [63]. The focus of this
study - shared single copy genes - were identified as the
set of unique clusters emerging from the TRIBE MCL
classification that included exactly one gene from each
genome included in the analysis. The collection of tribes
with exactly one gene from Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis,
and Oryza are termed the APVO single copy (SC) tribes.
Identification of homologs of APVO shared single copy
nuclear genes in non-seed plants

To identify the presence of shared single copy genes in
non-seed plants, we used the PlantTribes database ([63];

Page 14 of 18

http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/tribe.html) to identify shared
single copy genes in Selaginella, Physcomitrella, Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis and Oryza. In addition, the presence of genes in the Physcomitrella, Selaginella and
Chlamydomonas genomes that are shared single copy
genes in Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis, and Oryza was also
identified. The PlantTribes database identifies clusters of
genes from sequenced genomes through TRIBEMCL
clustering of BLASTP searches against various combinations of plant genomes [63,93,94]. The presence of
shared single copy genes in other non-seed plant
lineages were detected by using top hits to TBLASTX of
all shared single copy Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis and
Oryza protein sequences against the Plant Transcript
Assemblies ([73]; http://plantta.tigr.org/).
Characterization of shared single copy nuclear genes
in Arabidopsis

To characterize broadly the shared single copy genes
shared between Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis and Oryza,
we analyzed the genes based on their attributes in Arabidopsis for the following characteristics: 1) slim Gene
Ontology (GO) categories for biological processes, molecular function, and cellular location; 2) cDNA length; 3)
number of exons; and 4) number of domains as compared to all other genes in the Arabidopsis genome. For
GO classifications we compared the APVO single copy
genes against all other genes using c 2 tests to detect
overrepresentation and underrepresentation of single
copy genes in the slim GO categories as compared to all
other genes, using a p-value cutoff value of 0.05,
adjusted using a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests
for each separate category within the GO classification
(cellular location, molecular function, biological process). Differences in coding sequence length, number of
exons, and number of domains between shared single
copy genes and all other genes were tested using a Student’s t-test and a p-value cutoff of 0.01.
EST-based angiosperm phylogeny using shared single
copy nuclear genes

In order to explore the phylogenetic utility of conserved
single copy nuclear genes, eighteen genes from the Arabidopsis and Oryza shared single copy PlantTribes with
good taxonomic sampling of full-length sequences
across the angiosperms were selected for further study
(Table 3). When available, cDNA clones from select
taxa (Acorus americanus, Amborella trichopoda, Cucumis sativus, Eschscholzia californica, Liriodendron tulipifera, Nuphar advena, Persea americana, Ribes
americanum, Saruma henryii, Vaccinium corymbosum,
Welwitschia mirabilis, Yucca filamentosa, Zamia vazquezii) were sequenced on both strands to obtain a
high-quality finished sequence for phylogenetic analysis.

Duarte et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/61

Internal primers were designed using MacVector
(Accelrys, San Diego, CA) when necessary. Additional
sequences for phylogenetic analysis were obtained from
the Plant Transcript Assemblies [73] by using TBLASTX
[95] to identify putative homologs using both the Arabidopsis and Oryza genes as query sequences.
Amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE
[96] and nucleotide alignments were created by forcing
the DNA sequence onto the protein alignment using
CLUSTALW [97]. Alignments were manually inspected
and adjusted. Sequences were eliminated from the alignments according to the following criteria: 1) the
sequence was from a non-seed plant such as a fern,
moss or an alga; 2) the sequence contained at least five
ambiguous bases (N); 3) the sequence had low sequence
similarity compared to the rest of the alignment; 4) 50
or more bp were missing from either the 5’ or 3’ end of
the alignment, anchored by the start codon at the 5’ end
and the stop codon at the 3’ end; 5) the sequence was
identical to another sequence (preference given to transcript assemblies over EST singletons); 6) the sequence
was from a hybrid for which close relatives were also
included in the alignment. Gaps shared between species
were included in the final alignments, whereas gaps that
occur only in a single sequence were removed. A concatenated alignment of 13 shared single copy nuclear
genes was constructed for 69 taxa using the following
criteria: 1) genes were included if the single gene phylogenies presented no evidence of shared duplication
events; 2) taxa were included if at least 6 of the gene
sequences were available for that taxon; 3) a single
sequence for each species was selected with preference
for plant transcript assemblies with the greatest amount
of coverage and the shortest branch length. Shared
duplication events and identical sequences were identified through the examination of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree and accompanying distance matrix that
was generated using Jukes-Cantor distance in PAUP
4.0b10 [98] applied to the nucleotide alignment for each
individual after non-seed plant sequences, truncated
sequences, low similarity sequences, and sequences with
more than 5 ambiguous bases were eliminated from the
alignment. Nucleotide alignments after all criteria were
applied were used to produce phylogenies using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML).
Nucleotide alignments can be found in Additional file 5.
Appropriate models of sequence evolution for ML analyses were determined using MODELTEST using
Aikake’s Information Criteria [99]. Maximum parsimony
searches and bootstrapping were completed using a
heuristic search in PAUP 4.0b10 [98] with 500 ratchet
iterations as implemented by PRAP [100] with ten random sequence addition replications and tree-bisectionreconnection (TBR) branch swapping. Maximum

Page 15 of 18

likelihood searches and bootstrapping were completed
in GARLI 0.951 using default settings for the genetic
algorithm [101]. 1000 MP and 100 ML bootstrapping
replicates using the same heuristic search parameters
and model of sequence evolution were performed for
each of the eighteen single copy PlantTribes examined,
as well as the concatenated alignment of thirteen genes.
Using shared single copy nuclear genes for phylogeny
in the Brassicaceae

Ten taxa were selected in Brassicaceae to span the
major lineages and to sample more intensively in the
tribe Brassiceae that is thought to have an additional
ancient polyploidy event. Five tribes were selected
because of their known relative relationships to one
another because the relationships between most of the
other tribes remain relatively unresolved. The family
Cleomaceae has been firmly established as the family
sister to Brassicaceae [70,102] and Medicago truncatula
(Fabaceae) was selected as an additional outgroup which
is positioned within the rosid clade.
Total RNA was extracted from approximately 250 mg
fresh young leaf tissue using the Invitrogen Homogenizer and the Micro- to Midi- Total RNA Purification System and then converted into cDNA using the Invitrogen
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RTPCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) following all
manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase chain reactions
(PCR) amplifications were performed using degenerate
primers designed by eye based on the EST alignments,
Eppendorf Triplemaster PCR system, and the Eppendorf
Mastercycler epgradient S thermocycler (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) and following Eppendorf’s high
fidelity PCR protocols using a 60-62°C primer annealing
temperature. Amplicons were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, purified using the Invitrogen Purelink PCR
Purification kit, and than direct sequenced at the Core
facility at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
The sequences (1594 characters with 320 Parsimony
informative) were automatically assembled using the
software SeqMan (DNA Star, Madison, Wisconsin),
aligned using Megalign (DNA Star), and further aligned
by eye using Se-Al v2.0a11 [103]. Alignments used for
this analysis are available (Additional file 6). Maximum
parsimony analyses of the alignments were conducted
using PAUP 4.0b10 [98]. The most parsimonious trees
were generated using the heuristic search algorithm,
equal weighted characters, gaps treated as missing data,
with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, 1000 random additions of the sampled taxa, and
10 trees saved per replicate and a strict consensus tree
was computed. Bootstrap analyses were performed with
a 1000 replicates, full heuristic search, TBR branch
swapping and simple sequence addition.
