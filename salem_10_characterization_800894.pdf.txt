Characterization of the rainbow trout
transcriptome using Sanger and
454-pyrosequencing approaches

Abstract
Background: Rainbow trout are important fish for aquaculture and recreational fisheries and serves as a model
species for research investigations associated with carcinogenesis, comparative immunology, toxicology and
evolutionary biology. However, to date there is no genome reference sequence to facilitate the development of
molecular technologies that utilize high-throughput characterizations of gene expression and genetic variation.
Alternatively, transcriptome sequencing is a rapid and efficient means for gene discovery and genetic marker
development. Although a large number (258,973) of EST sequences are publicly available, the nature of rainbow
trout duplicated genome hinders assembly and complicates annotation.
Results: High-throughput deep sequencing of the Swanson rainbow trout doubled-haploid transcriptome using
454-pyrosequencing technology yielded ~1.3 million reads with an average length of 344 bp, a total of 447 million
bases. De novo assembly of the sequences yielded 151,847 Tentative Consensus (TC) sequences (average length of
662 bp) and 224,391 singletons. A combination assembly of both the 454-pyrosequencing ESTs and the preexisting sequences resulted in 161,818 TCs (average length of 758 bp) and 261,071 singletons. Gene Ontology
analysis of the combination assembly showed high similarities to transcriptomes of other fish species with known
genome sequences.
Conclusion: The 454 library significantly increased the suite of ESTs available for rainbow trout, allowing improved
assembly and annotation of the transcriptome. Furthermore, the 454 sequencing enables functional genome
research in rainbow trout, providing a wealth of sequence data to serve as a reference transcriptome for future
studies including identification of paralogous sequences and/or allelic variation, digital gene expression and
proteomic research.

Background
Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are widely distributed fish species cultured in regions with cold and cool
water temperatures around the world. They are important food and sport fish and the most cultivated cold
freshwater fish in the US [1-3]. In addition, rainbow trout
is one of the most rigorously studied fishes in many
research areas including carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology and
nutrition. For over a century, rainbow trout has been
used as a model research species; more is known about

the biology of rainbow trout than any other fish species.
Rainbow trout is a member of the Salmonidae family.
During the last decade more than 26,000 scientific papers
have been published on salmonids. Rainbow trout can
also serve as a surrogate for research needed on other
economically important salmonid species such as Atlantic and Pacific salmon and char species [4]. This wealth
of knowledge and interest in rainbow trout has guided
increased attention to developing and using genomics
tools, as evidenced by the considerable accumulation of
genomic resources in recent years from several groups
around the world [5,6]. However, the rainbow trout genome sequence is not available yet, and this lack of information hinders the contemporary approaches to
identification/characterization of important genes and

genetic markers for aquaculture applications and biomedical research. Until the reference genome sequence
becomes available, transcriptome sequencing is a fast and
efficient means for gene discovery and genetic marker
development. Transcriptome sequencing enables functional genomics studies including global gene expression,
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery, quantitative trait loci analysis and genome scans of diversity [7].
Rainbow trout is a significant fish model in terms of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [8]. International largescale EST sequencing projects for rainbow trout have
generated large number of ESTs (258,973) that are publicly available through the Rainbow Trout Gene Index
database [8-10].
As a member of the family Salmonidae, rainbow trout
has descended from a tetraploid ancestor [11]. A whole
genome duplication event occurred 25-100 mya and the
genome is estimated to be 1/3 of the way toward rediploidization [11,12]. About 50% of protein-coding loci
examined in salmonid species show duplicate gene
expression [13]. The nature of duplicated rainbow
trout genome hinders assembly and complicates annotation of the EST sequences as well as identification of
SNPs [14]. Attempts to assemble and annotate the rainbow trout ESTs yielded 40,320 Tentative Consensus (TC)
sequences, 49,408 singletons and 26,861 UniGenes
[15,16]. Previous efforts aimed at SNP discovery for rainbow trout using ESTs were unsuccessful, mainly, due to
difficulties parsing allelic variation from the high frequency of duplicated genes [14]. To better characterize
the rainbow trout transcriptome and improve discovery
of allelic variations, a haploid transcriptome sequence is
needed. Doubled haploid clonal lines, fish that have two
identical copies of each chromosome, were established in
salmonids, using androgenesis and gynogenesis; whole
chromosome set manipulation techniques [17,18]. In
androgenesis, eggs are gamma-irradiated to destroy DNA
and then fertilized with untreated sperm. Then, a temperature or pressure shock is used to interrupt mitosis,
resulting in completely homozygous doubled haploid
fish. Similarly, in gynogenesis, sperm are treated with
ultraviolet radiation to induce development of untreated
eggs before the temperature or pressure shock treatment.
To create a clonal line, completely homozygous and identical doubled haploid, population, a single homozygous
fish is reproduced through a second generation of chromosome set manipulation [17,18].
Recently, 454-pyrosequencing has become relatively
rapid and cost-effective method for sequencing with
progressively increasing depth and coverage. Therefore,
it is a very suitable technique for de novo transcriptome
sequencing for non-model species such as rainbow trout
[7,19-21]. The objectives of this study were to: 1)

sequence and characterize the transcriptome of an individual from the Swanson doubled haploid rainbow trout
clonal line using 454-pyrosequencing to produce a transcriptome reference sequence for identification of gene
duplications, distinguishing true/false SNPs and future
genomic/transcriptomic sequencing; and 2) use the
454-pyrosequencing and the Sanger-based EST data to
characterize the rainbow trout transcriptome with
improved assembly and annotation for digital gene
expression and proteomic research in the future.

Results and Discussion
Sanger-based sequencing of the rainbow trout
transcriptome

In the last few years, large-scale EST sequencing projects
for rainbow trout have been undertaken in several
laboratories worldwide. Rise and coworkers reported
14,544 ESTs (mostly 3’-sequences) from 6 rainbow trout
cDNA libraries [10]. Govoroun and coworkers reported a
total of 96,472 ESTs sequenced from three normalized
and subtracted cDNA libraries including one highly complex pooled-tissue library from 14 different tissues [8].
A substantial number of ESTs were generated in our
labs, currently representing 47% of the total number of
available rainbow trout sequences (124,138 out of
258,973) (Rainbow Trout Gene Index database release
7.0) [9,15]. Over 87,000 of these ESTs were sequenced
from a normalized library constructed from mRNA
pooled from several tissues including; muscle, brain, gill,
spleen, liver, kidney and juvenile tissues [9,10]. The normalization and pooling strategies were used to increase
probability of identifying unique and diverse set transcripts. Clones were randomly picked and sequenced
until library sequencing is saturated; low probability of
discovering a new mRNA reached due to the redundancy
effect. Collectively, the international efforts of sequencing
the rainbow trout transcriptome have thus far generated
290,735 ESTs that are publicly available through the
GenBank [22]. Table 1 shows summary statistics of the
major rainbow trout EST projects listed in the Rainbow
Trout Gene Index database [9,15]. In this database, all
EST sequence data were integrated and assembled producing 90,019 total unique sequences [8-10]. A total of
209,565 ESTs (81%) were clustered in 40,320 TCs and
49,408 ESTs (19%) were singletons. There is an average
of 5.2 EST per TC (Rainbow Trout Gene Index database
release 7.0) [23]. Most of the sequences were derived
from 5’- or 3’-sequencing and thus are less likely to cover
coding regions, which hinders the EST annotations.
Table 2 shows summary statistics of the Sanger-based
ESTs assembly compared to the below-mentioned
de novo assembly of the 454-pyrosequencing and a combination assembly of both datasets.

454-Pyrosequencing of the rainbow trout transcriptome

A 454-pyrosequencing library was constructed from 14 tissues collected from a single immature male homozygous
doubled-haploid fish from the Swanson clonal line, the
same line used for BAC library construction (12). The 454
library was titrated in three one-sixteenth-plate regions to
determine the optimal bead library concentration. After
titration, the library was sequenced in two half-plate
regions of a PicoTiterPlate. Great wealth of sequence data
were obtained from the pyrosequencing runs, yielding six
times more sequence data than all the currently available
Sanger-based data. A total of 1,416,404 ESTs (average
length 344 bp) and 447 million bases were obtained from
454-pyrosequencing. The primary sequence data were
deposited in GenBank Short Read Archive (SRA) under
accession number SRA009276.8. Of these, 1,290,292 (91%)
passed quality standards (primer filtering; sequences that
contain homopolymers and shorter than 100 bp were filtered out).
Sequences that passed quality standards were clustered
and de novo assembled. A total of 1,065,901 reads were
integrated into 151,847 TCs leaving 224,391 singletons;
yielding a total of 376,238 unique sequences (Table 2).
The de novo assembly sequence data were deposited in
the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database
with the accession numbers EZ763335-EZ915181. The
percentage of the assembled 454-pyrosequencing sequence
reads was 83% compared to 81% of the Sanger-based EST
data. The average length of the 454-pyrosequencing TCs
was 662 bp, compared to 999 bp of the Sanger-based data.

Page 4 of 10

Distribution of 454-assembly showed a wide range of contig lengths with most contigs ranging between 300 and
900 bp (Figure 1). The number of contigs larger than
500 bp was 84,810 (56%). De novo assembly of pyrosequencing transcriptomic data from other non-model species yielded 25-88% ESTs assembled into contigs of
average length 197-233 bp [7,24,25]. Successful assembly
of rainbow trout pyrosequencing data into relatively long
contigs is apparently due to the length of the individual
reads and/or thorough coverage of the transcriptome.
The 454-pyrosequencing data were generated and
assembled from a doubled-haploid rainbow trout clonal line to address problems associated with the nature
of the rainbow trout duplicated genome that hinders
assembly and complicates annotation [11,14]. The
454-pyrosequencing data were assembled to serve as a
reference sequence for future studies to identify gene
duplications from allelic variations and to distinguish
true/false SNPs. Sequence data were de novo assembled
using the default parameters of the SeqMan NGen
software (see Materials and Methods for details).
The 454-pyrosequencing library identified large number
of new genes. A total of 282,357 gene transcripts were
identified by subtracting the Sanger-based sequences from
the 454-pyrosequencing sequence data. The subtraction
was done by using BLASTn with an e-value below 1e-10,
an alignment longer than 99 bp and 95% sequence identity
within the aligned region (data not shown).
A combination of both the 454-pyrosequencing ESTs
and the Sanger-based sequences offered the maximum

Figure 1 Average length distribution of assemblies and pyrosequencing reads of the rainbow trout ESTs. Average lengths of the
combination assembly contigs are more than those of the 454-pyrosequencing assembly over the 100-700 bp length range, indicating that
addition of the Sanger-based data improved assembly of the short 454-pyrosequenceing reads up to 700 bp. However, over the 700-2000 bp
length range, average contig lengths of the combination assembly are less than those of the 454-pyrosequencing assembly indicating that
contigs longer than 700 bp of the combination assembly were mainly derived from the 454-pyroseqeuncing data, possibly because most of the
454-pyrosequencing reads were 400-600 bp. Number of the 454-pyrosequencing reads is divided by 10 for scaling.

amount of genetic information available for rainbow
trout so far; 521 M bp, 1,380,311 ESTs and 422,889
unique sequences (Table 2). The combination assembly
sequence data are available at the NAGRP Aquaculture
Genome Projects [26]. With estimates of 2.4 to 3.0 ×
109 bp genome size of the rainbow trout and 1% of the
genome being mRNAs, the combined data provide an
estimated 19× depth of coverage of the rainbow trout
transcriptome [27,28]. The combination assembly
increased the number of TCs to 161,818 (average contig
length of 758 bp) leaving 261,071 singletons. A comparison of the percentage of the assembled reads in the
combination assembly (81%) to the 454-pyrosequencing
and the Sanger-based assemblies (83% and 81%, respectively) indicates that combining the two sequence data
did not improve the assembly percentage of each individual sequence dataset (Table 2).
Figure 1 shows contig length distribution of the two
assemblies compared to 454-pyrosequence average
read length distribution. The figure illustrates that over
100-700 bp length range, average contig lengths of the
combination assembly are more than that of the
454-pyrosequencing assembly, indicating that adding
the Sanger-based data improved assembly of the short
454-pyrosequences reads up to 700 bp. However, over
700-2000 bp length range, average contig lengths of
the combination assembly are less than that of the
454-pyrosequencing assembly indicating that contigs
longer than 700 bp of the combination assembly were
mainly derived from the 454-pyroseqeuncing data, possibly because most of the 454-pyrosequencing reads
were 400-600 bp. The relatively short read lengths of
the 454 pyrosequencing compared to Sanger sequencing is a major concern of the 454-pyrosequencing
[25,29]. The 454/GS-Titanium sequencing platform,
used in this study, has been used to address this issue
and lead to successful assembly of the 454 pyrosequencing data, which make this technology suitable for
de novo transcriptome sequencing of non-model species such as aquaculture species [7,30].
Functional annotation and Gene Ontology analyses

Functional annotation of transcripts of the combination
assembly was carried out by BLASTx search against the
NCBI non-redundant protein database using the Blast2GO suite [31]. BLAST result accessions were used to
retrieve associated gene names and Gene ontology (GO)
terms. Gene ontology is widely used to standardize
representation of genes across species and provides a
controlled vocabulary of terms for describing gene product [32]. Biological processes constituted the largest
class of GO assignment of the transcripts (17,694
counts, 39%), followed by cellular components (16,452,
36%) and molecular function (11,160, 25%). Level 2 GO

Page 5 of 10

assignments within the three categories are summarized
in Figure 2. Of the biological process categories, 25% of
the genes are associated with cellular processes and 25%
are related to regulation of biological process. Within
the molecular functional category, 46% are related to
protein binding followed by 32% catalytic activity. Of
the cellular components, 59% of the genes are related to
the cell and 24% were related to organelles.
A BLASTx top-hit species distribution of gene annotations showed highest homology to Zebrafish (Danio
rerio), followed by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and
Puffer fish (Tetraodon nigrovirdis) (Figure 3). In addition, the trout sequences had significant homologies to
four more fish species including Japanese pufferfish
(Takifugu rubripes), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax),
Northern pike (Esox lucius) and European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). These results indicate a high level of
phylogenetic conservation of the rainbow trout gene
content compared to these fish species. On the other
hand, the model fish species Medaka fish (Oryzias
latipes) and Stickleback fish (Gasterostreus aculeatus)
showed very low homology to the trout sequences. It is
worth mentioning that only 5.7% of the BLASTx tophits matched rainbow trout protein sequences. This may
be explained on the basis of the limited number of the
rainbow trout proteins (6,915) that are currently available in the NCBI database compared to other fish species with known genome sequences (141,396 proteins in
the case of Zebrafish) and suggests identification of
large number of new genes by the 454-pyrosequencing
library [22]. The results of BLASTx top-hit of fish species are provided in Additional file 1, Table S1.
Based on the BLASTx top-hit species distribution of
gene annotations, Zebrafish was chosen for a detailed
Gene Ontology comparison (Figure 4). Distribution profile and percentage of clustered 2nd level Gene Ontology
terms of the combination assembly showed high similarity to that of the Zebrafish suggesting an unbiased
representation of the combination assembly to the rainbow trout transcriptome. Similarities of the rainbow
trout and Zebrafish transcripts as indicated by distributions of clusters of different categories of the biological
processes, cellular components and molecular functional
implies that the combination assembly represents the
rainbow trout tissue complexity and that normalization
of the 454-pyrosequencing pooled-tissue library and the
Sanger-based sequences were effective in reducing
redundancy (Figure 4).

Conclusion
A hybrid approach of the high throughput 454-pyrosequencing together with the traditional Sanger-based
sequences was used to generate high-quality draft
assemblies of the rainbow trout transcriptome. The

454-pyrosequencing data were generated and assembled
from a Swanson doubled-haploid rainbow trout individual to address problems associated with the nature of
the rainbow trout duplicated genome; to serves as a
reference sequence for future studies to identify gene
duplications from allelic variations and to distinguish
true/false SNPs.
The 454-pyrosequencing yielded a great wealth of
sequence data. Assembly of the 454-pyrosequencing
data together with the Sanger-based EST sequencing
data provides 19× depth of coverage of the rainbow
trout transcriptome, allowing robust functional annotation and gene ontology designation of the rainbow
trout transcripts, and providing a reference sequence
for digital gene expression, proteomic studies and QTL
mapping.
While the released assembly sequences significantly
increased the suite of transcriptome sequences available
for rainbow trout that enables functional genome
research, next-generation sequence assemblies may

contain incorrectly assembled contigs, special attention
should be given to this fact.

Methods
Production of doubled haploid rainbow trout

The doubled haploid trout from the Swanson clonal line
were produced at Washington State University (WSU)
as described previously [17,18] Homozygous rainbow
trout were produced by androgenesis and by gynogenesis by blockage of the first cleavage [33]. Fish were
raised to sexual maturity in recirculating systems at
WSU. Clones of homozygous individuals were produced
by collecting sperm from homozygous males and doing
another cycle of androgenesis as described above, or by
stripping the eggs from homozygous androgenetically or
gynogenetically produced females and performing gynogenesis by retention of the second polar body [34]. The
eggs were incubated in Heath trays at 12°C until hatching, then transferred to re-circulating systems for grow
out.

Tissue collection and RNA isolation

Tissues were collected from a single immature (~2-yearold, ~250 g) male homozygous doubled-haploid fish
from the Swanson River clonal line [18]. Tissues were
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped on dry ice
from WSU to WVU then stored at -80°C until total
RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol™
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from 14 tissues including
white muscle, red muscle, testis, spleen, kidney, head
kidney, pituitary, stomach, brain, heart, intestine, gill,
skin and liver. Equal masses of total RNAs from various
tissues were pooled and used to construct the 454-pyrosequencing library.
454-cDNA Library construction

Library preparation and 454-pyrosequencing and sequence
assemblies were done at Roy J. Carver Biotechnology
Center (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) as
described before [35]. Briefly, messenger RNA was isolated
from total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA Mini kit
(Qiagen, CA). First and second strand cDNA were synthesized from 200 ng of mRNA using the SuperScript®
Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, CA)
with 100 μM random hexamer primers (Fermentas, USA).
Double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up with a QIAquick

Minelute PCR purification column (Qiagen, CA). Doublestranded DNA was nebulized with the nebulization kit
supplied with the GS Titanium Library Preparation kit
(Roche/454 Life Sciences, CT) following their recommendations (30 psi for 1 minute) and cleaned up with a QIAquick PCR minelute column and eluted in 50 ul EB.
Nebulized cDNA was blunt-ended (25 μl water, 10 μl 10×
T4 DNA Ligase buffer (NEB), 4 μl 10 mM dNTP mix, 5 μl
T4 DNA polymerase (3 U/μl) (NEB), 1 μl Klenow
polymerase (5 U/μl) (NEB), and 5 μl Polynucleotide kinase
(10 U/μl) (NEB) and cleaned up with a Qiaquick PCR
minelute column and eluted in 32 ul EB. A dA-overhang
was added at 3’ end of cDNA by adding the following to
the blunt-ended cDNA: 5 μl 10× buffer 2 (NEB), 10 μl
1 mM dATP and 3 μl Klenow exo-minus polymerase
(5 U/μl) (NEB). The reaction was incubated at 37°C for
30 minutes and then cleaned up with a QIAquick MiniElute column and eluted in 10 μl EB. The cDNA was adaptored with Titanium adaptors (Roche/454 Life Sciences,
CT) by adding 9 μl water, 25 μl 2× Rapid Ligase buffer
(Enzymatics, MA) 5 μl (50 μM) Titanium adapter A/B mix
and 1 μl T4 DNA Ligase (600 U/μl (Enzymatics, MA) and
incubated the ligation reaction at room temperature for
15 minutes. The reaction was cleaned up using a Qiaquick
MiniElute column (Qiagen), eluting the cDNA in 20 μl

EB. Adaptored cDNA was run on a E-GEL EX 2% agarose
(Invitrogen, CA) following the manufacturer instructions
and cDNAs in the size range of 400-800 bp were excised
from the gel and purified with a Qiagen’s Gel Extraction
kit and the cDNA was eluted in 30 μl EB. One μl of the
gel-purified cDNA was used as template for amplification
in 50 μl PCR reactions containing 10 μl 5× Phusion Buffer
HF (NEB), 25 μM Adapter A_For primer (5’CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGACGAGTGC
GT3’), 25 μM Adapter B_For primer (5’CCTATCCCCT
GTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGT3’), 3% DMSO, 10 mM
dNTPs and 1 U Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes/NEB,
USA). The PCR conditions were as follows: 98°C for 30
seconds, followed by 15 cycles with 98°C for 10 seconds,
68°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 30 seconds, with a final
extension of 72°C for 5 minute and cleaned up with a Qiaquick minelute PCR column.
Normalization of cDNA library

The cDNA library was normalized according to the protocol described in the Trimmer Direct Kit (Evrogen,
Russia). In brief, 300 ng of cDNA were incubated at
95°C for 5 minutes followed by incubation at 68°C for 4
hours in the hybridization buffer included in the kit (50
mM Hepes, pH7.5 and 0.5 M NaCl). After the incubation, the reaction was treated with ¼ units of duplex
specific nuclease (DSN). The normalized cDNA was
then amplified from 1 μl of DSN-treated cDNA by PCR
reactions (10 cycles) described above and gel purified
for the fragment size of 400-800 bp as described above.
454/GS-Titanium sequencing

After library construction, the samples were quantified
using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, CA) and average
fragment sizes were determined by analyzing 1 μl of the
samples on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent, CA) using a DNA
7500 chip. The library was diluted to 1 × 106molecules/
μl. emPCR was set up using Titanium emPCR kits
(Roche) at 0.25 copies of DNA molecules per bead (8.75
μl of 1 × 106 molecules/μl into 35 million beads). Processing was done per Roche protocols for the remaining
emPCR breaking, enrichment, and PTP loading steps.
Bioinformatics analysis

The sff sequence files were processed by using tools
from Roche [36] and in-house Java scripts. Sequences
that contain homopolymers (in which 60% over the
entire length of the read is represented by one nucleotide) and that are shorter than 100 bp were filtered out.
Modified sequence data were De novo assembled using
the software SeqMan NGen version 2.0 (trial version)
from DNAStar [37] at default parameters (Match size,
40 bp; minimum match percentage, 90%; mismatch
penalty, 25; gap penalty, 25). Similarly, a combination

assembly was done using both the 454-pyrosequencing
ESTs and the pre-existing Sanger sequences downloaded
from the rainbow trout gene index [15].
