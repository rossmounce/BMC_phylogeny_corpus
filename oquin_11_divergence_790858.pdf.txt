Abstract
Background: Divergence within cis-regulatory sequences may contribute to the adaptive evolution of gene
expression, but functional alleles in these regions are difficult to identify without abundant genomic resources.
Among African cichlid fishes, the differential expression of seven opsin genes has produced adaptive differences in
visual sensitivity. Quantitative genetic analysis suggests that cis-regulatory alleles near the SWS2-LWS opsins may
contribute to this variation. Here, we sequence BACs containing the opsin genes of two cichlids, Oreochromis
niloticus and Metriaclima zebra. We use phylogenetic footprinting and shadowing to examine divergence in
conserved non-coding elements, promoter sequences, and 3’-UTRs surrounding each opsin in search of candidate
cis-regulatory sequences that influence cichlid opsin expression.
Results: We identified 20 conserved non-coding elements surrounding the opsins of cichlids and other teleosts,
including one known enhancer and a retinal microRNA. Most conserved elements contained computationallypredicted binding sites that correspond to transcription factors that function in vertebrate opsin expression;
O. niloticus and M. zebra were significantly divergent in two of these. Similarly, we found a large number of
relevant transcription factor binding sites within each opsin’s proximal promoter, and identified five opsins that
were considerably divergent in both expression and the number of transcription factor binding sites shared
between O. niloticus and M. zebra. We also found several microRNA target sites within the 3’-UTR of each opsin,
including two 3’-UTRs that differ significantly between O. niloticus and M. zebra. Finally, we examined interspecific
divergence among 18 phenotypically diverse cichlids from Lake Malawi for one conserved non-coding element,
two 3’-UTRs, and five opsin proximal promoters. We found that all regions were highly conserved with some
evidence of CRX transcription factor binding site turnover. We also found three SNPs within two opsin promoters
and one non-coding element that had weak association with cichlid opsin expression.
Conclusions: This study is the first to systematically search the opsins of cichlids for putative cis-regulatory
sequences. Although many putative regulatory regions are highly conserved across a large number of
phenotypically diverse cichlids, we found at least nine divergent sequences that could contribute to opsin
expression differences in cis and stand out as candidates for future functional analyses.

Background
Adaptive phenotypic evolution may result either from
protein-coding mutations that modify the structure and
function of genes, or from regulatory mutations that
alter the timing, location, or expression of genes [1-3].
Although examples of protein-coding mutations that

contribute to phenotypic evolution are well known (e.g.,
[4-6]), examples of regulatory mutations that also affect
phenotypic adaptation are less well known, but no less
important (e.g., [7-9]). One class of regulatory mutations, cis-regulatory mutations, are found in close proximity to the genes they regulate and function by altering
the binding of transcription factors necessary for gene
expression. Cis-regulatory mutations exhibit several features that make them ideally suited for adaptive phenotypic evolution, including codominance [10] and
modularity [8]. These features make cis-regulatory

mutations efficient targets for natural selection [11] and
limit the negative consequences of pleiotropy that presumably affect many trans-regulatory and protein-coding mutations. Finally, since cis-regulatory mutations
may underlie many of the adaptive and disease phenotypes found in nature, identifying these alleles remains
an important goal of evolutionary genetics. However,
identifying cis-regulatory mutations can be challenging
without abundant functional genomic resources, since
the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) they affect
are small, lack strict conservation, and are found in difficult-to-annotate regions of the genome [2,3].
The location of cis-regulatory sequences can be nearto or far-from the genes they regulate. Promoter
sequences found directly upstream of genes can harbor
cis-regulatory alleles [12,13], as can enhancer or repressor elements located many kilobases away [14,15]. Cisregulatory sequences can even reside within the
untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes, where they alter
the binding of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate gene
expression following transcription [16,17]. But where
ever their location, two methods commonly used to
identify cis-regulatory sequences and alleles are phylogenetic footprinting and phylogenetic shadowing [18]. In
phylogenetic footprinting, one compares DNA surrounding some gene(s) of interest among numerous
divergent taxa in hopes of identifying non-coding
regions that are highly conserved. By the very nature of
their conservation, these conserved non-coding elements
(CNEs) stand out as candidate regulatory sequences,
since conservation is often used to indicate function.
Once candidate regulatory sequences have been identified via phylogenetic footprinting, the method used to
identify putative cis-regulatory alleles within them is differential phylogenetic footprinting, or phylogenetic shadowing [18,19]. In phylogenetic shadowing, one
compares putative regulatory sequences among closely
related taxa in hopes of identifying sequence polymorphisms correlated with the divergent expression of
some target gene(s). Following their application, functional genomic analyses are necessary to validate the
function of any candidate sequences or alleles identified
by the phylogenetic footprinting and shadowing methods; but even by themselves, both methods can provide
valuable insights into the location of potential cis-regulatory sequences and the transcription factors that bind
them.
The goal of this study is to identify candidate cis-regulatory sequences that control opsin gene expression in
African cichlid fishes. Opsins are a group of G proteincoupled receptors that confer sensitivity to light and
mediate color vision [20]. African cichlids comprise a
diverse clade of freshwater, teleost fish found throughout the lakes and rivers of Africa, including the three

Page 2 of 23

African Great Lakes, Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi, and
Victoria [21,22]. Cichlids from Lakes Tanganyika and
Malawi exhibit dramatic variation in their sensitivity to
colored light [23-25]. Species from these lakes exhibit
retinal sensitivities that are maximally sensitive to short,
middle, or long-wavelength spectra; in some cases, closely related species can differ in their maximal retinal
sensitivity by over 100 nm [25-27]. This striking variation makes the cichlid visual system one of the most
diverse vertebrate visual systems so far identified. Most
variation in cichlid color sensitivity is due to changes in
the regulation of their cone opsin genes [26,27]. Cichlids
have seven cone opsin genes used for color vision; these
opsins are SWS1 (ultraviolet-sensitive), SWS2B (violetsensitive), SWS2A (blue-sensitive), RH2B (blue-greensensitive), RH2A and RH2A (green-sensitive), and LWS
(red-sensitive) [28]. Additionally, these opsins are
located in three regions of the cichlid genome: SWS1 is
found on cichlid linkage group (LG) 17; RH2B, RH2A
and RH2A are found together in a tandem array on LG
5; and SWS2A, SWS2B, and LWS form a second tandem
array on LG 5 (Lee et al. 2005) (Figure 1). Among different cichlid species, these opsins are alternatively coexpressed in three predominant groups, or palettes, to
produce the three common visual pigment sets: SWS1RH2B-RH2A (short wavelength-sensitive), SWS2BRH2B-RH2A (middle wavelength-sensitive), and SWS2ARH2A-LWS (long wavelength-sensitive) [26]. Cichlids
exhibit several correlations between the expression of
their opsins and important ecological variables, including foraging preference and ambient light intensity
[26,27]. These correlations suggest that opsin gene
expression varies adaptively in cichlids, especially since
some expression-ecology correlations have evolved independently among cichlids in different lakes [27]. A
recent quantitative genetic analysis of opsin expression
in two Lake Malawi cichlids found a quantitative trait
locus (QTL) located near the opsin genes [29]. The
proximity of this QTL to the opsins suggests that mutations within one or more cis-regulatory sequences may
contribute to variation in cichlid opsin expression. But
like many non-model systems, few genomic resources
are currently available for cichlids, making it difficult to
identify potential cis-regulatory alleles and test their
association with opsin gene expression.
Here, we sequence and analyze bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) clones containing the opsin genes
of two African cichlid species, Oreochromis niloticus
[30] and Metriaclima zebra [31]. Oreochromis niloticus
(the Nile tilapia) is a riverine cichlid that expresses the
long wavelength-sensitive opsin palette as adults but
also expresses the other palettes as fry and juveniles
[32]. O. niloticus is an outgroup to the diverse haplochromine cichlids endemic to Lakes Tanganyika,

Malawi, and Victoria. Metriaclima zebra (the ‘classic’
Zebra cichlid) is one such haplochromine cichlid found
in Lake Malawi. M. zebra expresses the short wavelength-sensitive opsin palette as an adult and during all
developmental stages [32]. Both species last shared a
common ancestor ~ 18 MYA, whereas M. zebra
diverged from other phenotypically diverse Lake Malawi
cichlids less than 2 MYA [33]. After sequencing the
opsin-containing BAC clones from these species, we

used the resulting sequences for several analyses,
including:
(1) Annotation and comparison of the opsin-containing regions from the genome assemblies of several model teleosts. We perform phylogenetic
footprinting by comparing the opsin-containing
regions of O. niloticus and several model fish genomes. We use this comparison to locate conserved

non-coding elements (CNEs) that serve as candidate
cis-regulatory sequences for the opsins.
(2) Computational prediction of binding sites for 12
transcription factors important for vertebrate opsin
expression [34-41] (Table 1). We perform this search
in each CNE as well as within the proximal promoter of each opsin. We also perform an analogous
search for miRNA target sites within the 3’-UTR of
each opsin.
(3) Phylogenetic shadowing between O. niloticus and
M. zebra using the TFBS and miRNA target site
profiles found in each CNE, promoter, and 3’-UTR
sequence. In each region we compare the proportion
of divergent TFBS/miRNA target sites with the
amount expected given the over-all sequence divergence of the opsin BACs and introns (a measure of
neutral evolutionary divergence [42,43]). These comparisons are used to identify putative cis-regulatory
sequences that have undergone significant evolutionary divergence among African cichlids.
(4) Following phylogenetic shadowing, we resequence the most divergent regions in a panel of 18
phenotypically diverse cichlids from Lake Malawi.
We search these sequences for polymorphisms that
may indicate the presence of cis-regulatory alleles.
This final analysis allows us to determine whether
the divergent regions we identify between O. niloticus and M. zebra also contain polymorphisms correlated with opsin expression in the more closely
related cichlids of Lake Malawi.
We use the final results of this study to examine
which regulatory regions are most likely to contain
functional regulatory alleles that determine opsin
expression in African cichlids. We find that many non-

coding regions are highly conserved between O. niloticus
and M. zebra, as well as among the closely related
cichlids of Lake Malawi. However, we find at least two
CNEs, five proximal promoters, and two 3’-UTRs that
exhibit significant divergence in the number and type of
TFBS and miRNA targets found between O. niloticus
and M. zebra. We also identify at least three alleles that
are weakly associated with SWS2A, RH2B, and LWS
expression - three opsins that show strong differential
expression among cichlid species. These results suggest
that cis-regulatory sequences may contribute to opsin
expression differences among African cichlids, and provide numerous candidates for future functional studies.

Results and Discussion
BAC Sequencing and Analysis
BAC identification, sequencing, assembly, and comparison

Within the cichlid genome, the opsins are found in
three separate tandem arrays. SWS1 is found alone on
cichlid linkage group (LG) 17; SWS2A, SWS2B, and
LWS are found together in a tandem array on LG 5
[44]; and RH2B, RH2Aa, and RH2Ab are found in a second tandem array on LG 5 approximately 30 cM from
the SWS2-LWS array (KL Carleton, unpublished data)
[44]. We identified opsin-containing BAC clones for O.
niloticus by PCR screening [30] and for M. zebra by filter hybridization [31]. We then shotgun sequenced each
clone using ABI Sanger or 454 Life Sciences technology.
Clone IDs, estimated sizes, sequencing methods, assembly statistics, final contig length, and GenBank accession
numbers for resulting contigs are listed in Table 2. The
average read length for ABI-generated sequences was
~700 bp, while the average read length for 454-generated sequences was ~110 bp. For the O. niloticus SWS1containing clone, we used a combination of ABI and

454 sequences since the assemblies based on ABI-generated reads alone were poor. For all other clones, we
used additional Sanger reads to fill in the gaps and join
all contigs into their final BAC assemblies (Table 2).
Overall, the final assemblies of each clone based on ABI
and 454 technology joined an average of 85% of reads
into a single contig that was within 10 - 40 kb of the
estimated clone size (Table 2). All assemblies successfully covered the opsin-containing regions in O. niloticus
and M. zebra.
We aligned each BAC assembly from O. niloticus and
M. zebra and found them to be highly similar. The only
significant difference was a 6.1 kb insertion in the M.
zebra RH2-containing BAC, located between the
RH2Aa, and RH2Ab opsins (Additional file 1). This
insertion is likely a transposon. The average pairwise
Jukes-Cantor-corrected sequence divergence (Dxy) across
each BAC assembly was 8.4% (± 3.1% s.e.). This rate of
sequence divergence is consistent with comparisons of
other genes between these species, and it is one of the
first large-scale estimates of sequence divergence
between O. niloticus and M. zebra. We then subdivided
each BAC assembly into opsin protein-coding (CDS)
and intronic (INT) sequences. For O. niloticus and M.
zebra, the mean Dxy across all opsin CDS was 3.8% (±
0.3%), while the divergence across all INT was 9.5% (±
1.9%). (We excluded both the first intron as well as the
first and last six bases of each intron since these regions
may contain regulatory sequences and splice sites that
are more highly conserved than other intronic regions
[43]). Comparison of the average Dxy across all regions
reveals that the mean divergence of the functionally
important opsin CDS is significantly lower than D xy
across either the BACs or INT sequences (t-tests: CDS
vs. BAC, t8, 0.05 = 2.60, p = 0.032; CDS vs. INT, t27, 0.05
= 2.17, p = 0.039), but that Dxy between BAC and INT
sequences do not differ (t23, 0.05 = 0.08, p = 0.935). In
addition to evaluating which regions of each opsin-

containing BAC retain the highest conservation and are
most likely to be functional, these divergence estimates
also provide an important null hypothesis for our subsequent analyses using phylogenetic shadowing: in general,
we expect O. niloticus and M. zebra to share (e.g, exhibit orthology in) ~92% of their TFBS and miRNA target
sites, and exhibit divergence in ~8%. Divergence in
greater than 8% of the TFBS and miRNA target sites
identified may indicate significant cis-regulatory
sequence evolution in the regions examined.
BAC annotation and the opsin repertoire of teleost fishes

In order to perform phylogenetic footprinting across the
opsin arrays of cichlids, we first investigated the synteny
of each opsin array of O. niloticus relative to several
model fish species using PipMaker [45] and MultiPipMaker [46]. We found considerable synteny in the
opsin-containing regions among O. niloticus (tilapia),
Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback), Oryzias latipes
(medaka), Tetraodon nigroviridis (tetraodon), and Danio
rerio (zebrafish) (Figure 1; Additional file 2A). The clearest example of this synteny was the SWS2-LWS opsin
array. This array is flanked by the genes HCFC1 and
GNL3L and is essentially co-linear in all five fish genomes (Figure 1; see Additional file 3 for the position
and orientation of flanking genes). We found evidence
for a localized duplication of the SWS2 opsins in O.
latipes and O. niloticus, since both these species have
two adjacent SWS2 opsin genes (Additional file 4). Closely related Poeciliid fishes also possess adjacent SWS2
paralogs [47], suggesting that this duplication event
probably occurred at least 153 - 113 MYA at the base of
the Acanthopterygii [48,49].
In contrast to the SWS2-LWS array, we observed considerable variation in opsin gene content for the RH2
opsins. O. niloticus and M. zebra possess three RH2
genes while D. rerio has four [50,51], G. aculeatus has
two, and T. nigrovirdis has one functional RH2 opsin
and one RH2 pseudogene [52]. We therefore used

O’Quin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/120

phylogenetic analyses to investigate the orthology of the
RH2 and SWS2 genes among these fishes and found
that most RH2 duplications are species-specific [53]
(Additional File 4). Thus, synteny in the region containing the RH2 opsin array was lower than in the SWS2LWS array, but was still largely co-linear between O.
niloticus, G. aculeatus, and T. nigroviridis (Additional
file 2B). The genes SLC6A13-like and SYNPR flank the
RH2 opsins in these fishes (Figure 1; Additional file 3).
Synteny in the region surrounding the SWS1 opsin
was difficult to assess due to species-specific deletions
and poor genome assembly. The T. nigrovirdis genome
assembly lacks the SWS1 opsin altogether, and this
region is found within an unordered chromosome or
ultracontig in both the G. aculeatus and O. latipes genomes. For G. aculeatus, we found a small 92 kb region
containing the SWS1 opsin that was collinear with the
O. niloticus BAC sequence, but which contained one
large inversion. For O. latipes, we found an even smaller
60 kb region that was syntenic for only 11 kb surrounding the SWS1 opsin. Synteny with D. rerio was also generally low (Additional file 2C). Therefore, despite the
lack of SWS1 duplicates compared to the SWS2 or RH2
opsins, the SWS1 region is still poorly assembled in the
existing annotations of several teleost genomes, potentially complicating direct comparisons of synteny in this
region. In these species, the SWS1 opsin appears to be
flanked by the genes TNPO3 and CALUA (Figure 1;
Additional file 3).
Analysis of Conserved Non-Coding Elements (CNEs)
Phylogenetic footprinting to identify CNEs

We used MultiPipMaker [46] to highlight non-coding
elements surrounding each opsin gene array from O.
niloticus to D. rerio, representing nearly 300 MY of fish
evolution [49]. The resulting plots illustrate at least 20
conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) surrounding the
opsin gene arrays of O. niloticus and the other fish species examined (red bars in Figure 1). We also found six
regions of putatively high conservation that are largely
composed of repetitive sequence (green bars in Figure
1), which we did not analyze further. The conservation
of these CNEs over several million years of fish evolution suggests that they contain functionally important
regulatory modules necessary for gene expression.
At least one CNE we identified through phylogenetic
footprinting is orthologous to other vertebrate cis-regulatory sequences. CNE 7 (highlighted in Figure 1 and
located between the SWS2B and LWS opsins) consists
of two non-contiguous regions of high conservation in
pufferfish, stickleback, medaka, swordtails, and cichlids
[47] (Figure 1). The first region, CNE 7a, was also identified following a comparative analysis of opsin-containing BACs from swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri) [47].

Page 6 of 23

Through BLAST and mirbase [54], we found that CNE
7a is most similar to zebrafish miRNA dre-miR-726
(score 173.3, e-value = 0.006), and the same genomic
region from zebrafish is identical to this miRNA (Figure
2). Dre-miR-726 is expressed in the retina of larval and
adult zebrafish [55]. Since many miRNAs are transcribed
along with the genes they regulate, the proximity of
miR-726 to the SWS2 and LWS opsins suggests that it
could play a role in opsin regulation. The ~90 bp CNE
encoding mir-726 is conserved in numerous other taxa
as well, including additional fishes, frogs, and lizards
[47,56].
The second highly conserved region, CNE 7b, is positionally and structurally orthologous to the mammalian
LWS locus control region (LWS-LCR; Figure 2B)
[47,56,57]. This enhancer is located ~3.8 kb upstream of
the LWS opsin in O. niloticus and other vertebrates,
including humans. The LWS-LCR is hypothesized to
enhance LWS expression in eutherian mammals by
looping and binding to the LWS proximal promoter
[57-59]. Wang et al. [59] demonstrated that the human
ortholog of this sequence can function as an enhancer
of both LWS and MWS opsin expression in mice. Additionally, a recent study of LWS regulation in zebrafish
also identified a similar sequence at this position that
modulates LWS expression in that species, which they
named the LWS activating region (LAR) [60]. Comparison of the mammalian LWS-LCR, the zebrafish LAR,
and CNE 7b from cichlids and other teleosts reveals a
high degree of sequence similarity among these regions
(Figure 2B). In Figure 2B, we also highlight several conserved transcription factor binding sites common to
each sequence, including sites for CRX, THR, and AP-1
(Figure 2B; see also Table 1). Thus, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the phylogenetic footprinting
method for identifying functional cis-regulatory
sequences necessary for vertebrate opsin expression. It
is therefore possible that the remainder of the CNEs we
identify also encode cis-regulatory sequences necessary
for the correct spatial and developmental expression of
the opsins in cichlids.
We note that our present study focuses on small
regions of high conservation within a ~30 kb window of
non-coding sequence surrounding the opsin arrays, but
that cis-regulatory sequences may often reside tens or
hundreds of kilobases from the genes they regulate.
However, two recent analyses of general transcription
factor binding sites found that functional binding sites
generally cluster in regions 1 kb around the proximal
promoter of each gene [61,62]. This observation suggests that a focused study of conserved elements within
or near the opsins is a reasonable strategy for this initial
study. A FASTA file of all CNE sequences from O. niloticus and M. zebra is provided in Additional file 5.

TFBS search and phylogenetic shadowing of CNEs

We compared the 20 CNEs identified between O. niloticus and M. zebra and found many to be highly conserved; however, we found no identifiable orthologs
between O. niloticus and M. zebra for CNEs 6 or 19.
For the remaining CNEs, the average pairwise sequence
divergence between O. niloticus and M. zebra was 4.2%
(± 0.5%), which is significantly less than the mean Dxy
of introns (9.5%, t-test: t38, 0.05 = 2.99, p = 0.005). This
result suggests that the conserved non-coding regions
identified among O. niloticus and other fishes have
remained conserved among African cichlids as well.
We used the Transcription Element Search System
[63] to computationally search all orthologous CNEs for
binding sites corresponding to twelve transcription factors that have been associated with opsin expression in
fishes and other vertebrates including thyroid hormone
and retinoic acid receptors [34-37,39,41,64,65]. A complete list of these transcription factors and their associated opsins is presented in Table 1. We found
computationally-predicted binding sites for these functionally important transcription factors in all but one of
the CNEs surveyed (Table 3; see Additional file 6 for
detailed counts of all TFBS). Only CNE 10 lacked binding sites for any of the twelve transcription factors in
either species examined. Within the remaining
sequences we found binding sites for all twelve transcription factors except PNR and RXRg. After relaxing
our matching criteria, we still failed to find binding sites
for these two transcription factors (data not shown). In
both O. niloticus and M. zebra, binding sites for AP-1
and CRX were extremely abundant, although binding
sites for each of three retinoic acid receptors (RARs)
and THRb were also common (Additional file 6). We

found several CNEs with a high density of transcription
factor binding sites given the total sequence length surveyed - generally 9 TFBS or more (see Additional file 6).
For O. niloticus these high-density CNEs are CNEs 2, 3,
13, 15, 19, and 20, and for M. zebra these are CNEs 2,
8, 11, 13, 15, and 20. Due to their potential enrichment
for functional TFBSs relative to other CNEs, we believe
these eight CNEs represent the most likely candidates
for functional cis-regulators of opsin expression in
fishes.
Consistent with the high similarity of their sequences,
the results of our TFBS search differed very little
between O. niloticus and M. zebra. We used exact binomial tests to compare the proportion of shared and
divergent TFBSs observed between O. niloticus and M.
zebra to the null ratio of 92:8 (see above). Treating each
TFBS independently, we counted each non-orthologous
or divergent TFBS as a success, each orthologous or
shared TFBS as a failure, then tested the hypothesis that
the true probability of success (proportion of divergent
TFBS, P div) was > 8%. Of 17 testable CNEs, we found
that O. niloticus and M. zebra differed significantly from
this null expectation at four CNEs: CNEs 3, 4, 15, and
18 (Table 3). After Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons, however, only the results for CNE 3
remained significant (exact binomial test: divergent
TFBS = 7, total TFBS = 8, P div = 87.5%, p < 0.001).
Overall, these results did not change when we used the
mean divergence of introns from each CNE’s nearest
down-stream opsin as a null hypothesis, except that O.
niloticus and M. zebra also exhibited significant divergence at CNE 4 (divergent TFBS = 2, total TFBS = 2,
Pdiv = 100.0%, p = 0.001). Both CNE 3 and 4 are located
upstream of the SWS2A opsin. For CNE 3, O. niloticus

has 8 TFBS while M. zebra has only one; for CNE 4, M.
zebra has two while O. niloticus has none. These results
are consistent with what one might expect based on the
expression of these opsins in adults, since SWS2A is
highly expressed among O. niloticus adults, but is not
expressed in M. zebra [32]. Thus, we show that O. niloticus and M. zebra have diverged significantly in the

identity of their TFBS profiles for two putative cis-regulatory elements (CNEs 3 and 4), and differ in the presence/absence of two more (CNEs 6 and 19). Three of
these CNEs (3, 4, and 6) are found upstream of the
SWS2A opsin (Figure 1). These results offer the compelling possibility that at least some of the differences in
opsin expression observed between O. niloticus and M.

O’Quin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/120

zebra could be due to divergence in the TFBS profiles of
CNEs surrounding their opsins.
We acknowledge that our use of the overall proportion of divergent TFBS (Pdiv) to detect CNEs that have
undergone significant cis-regulatory divergence ignores
many nuances of TFBS evolution, such as the overall
number and kind of TFBS present in each CNE and
species. But because of the small number of TFBSs
found within each CNE (the average number of TFBSs
found in each CNE was 5.9), it is difficult to perform
robust tests of divergence in the number of binding
sites for individual transcription factors. Therefore, we
have summed all TFBSs into orthologous (shared) and
non-orthologous (divergent) groups in order to perform
phylogenetic shadowing between O. niloticus and M.
zebra. However, even within these broad categories, we
have only enough power that CNEs with P div > 25%
stand out as statistical outliers, and only those with Pdiv
> 80% remain significant after correction for multiple
comparisons. In the future we aim to perform more
nuanced, sequence-based tests of cis-regulatory divergence in cichlids. We present these tests for cis-regulatory divergence as a first step in this process.
Analysis of Proximal Promoter regions
Phylogenetic footprinting of opsin proximal promoters

The MultiPip plots shown in Figure 1 reveal 20 CNEs
upstream of the opsins, but also show several regions of
high conservation within the 5’ proximal promoter of
multiple opsins as well. In particular, SWS2A, SWS2B,
and LWS all exhibit regions of high conservation in the
first 1 kb of sequence upstream of their translation start
site (TSS). For the LWS opsin, this region of conservation spans nearly 0.7 kb of the proximal promoter in
multiple fish species, including G. aculeatus, O. latipes,
and T. nigroviridis (Figure 1B). RH2A and RH2A also
exhibit some small regions of high conservation just
upstream of their TSSs, which probably reflect the 5’UTR region. Additionally, the promoter upstream of
RH2B also contains some conserved regions of repetitive
sequence (Figure 1C). It is compelling that many of the
opsins exhibit strong conservation of sequences within 1
kb of their TSSs, which we use to define the proximal
promoter, because the true promoter regions for these
genes are unknown in cichlids. However, important cisregulatory sequences have been identified in close proximity to the opsin genes in other fish species. In particular, several CRX transcription factor binding sites found
within 500 bp of the SWS2 opsin regulate the expression
of this gene in D. rerio [41]. Therefore, the conservation
we observe upstream of the SWS2A, SWS2B, and LWS
opsins may indicate the presence of additional cis-regulatory sequences within the proximal promoters of these
genes as well. A FASTA file of all opsin and non-opsin

Page 9 of 23

promoter sequences (see below) from O. niloticus and
M. zebra is presented in Additional file 5.
TFBS search and phylogenetic shadowing of opsin proximal
promoters

The distribution and number of TFBSs found within the
proximal promoter region of each opsin was similar to
those found in the CNEs. Within each opsin’s proximal
promoter, we found that AP-1 and CRX binding sites
were nearly ubiquitous (Figure 3). Binding sites for
NFB, RARa, RARb, RXRb and THRb were also common, and we once again found no binding sites for PNR
and RXRg. The absence of binding sites for PNR and
RXRg in both the CNEs and promoters may rule-out
these factors as candidate trans-regulators of cichlid
opsin expression differences; however the lack of these
factors could also be due to biases in the way TESS
identifies binding sites. Interestingly, we found several
CRX binding sites directly upstream of the SWS2A and
SWS2B opsins (Figure 3). These binding sites could
potentially function as regulators of SWS2 opsin expression in cichlids as they do in zebrafish [41].
Pairwise sequence divergence in the proximal promoter regions was greater than for the other regions examined. The average Dxy of the proximal promoters was
10.2% (± 3.2%), which differed significantly from the
mean of CNEs (4.2%, t-test: t23, 0.05 = 2.48, p = 0.021),
but not the introns (9.5%, t-test: t 27, 0.05 = 0.14, p =
0.89). This result suggests that the opsin promoter
regions of cichlids may exhibit greater divergence in
putative cis-regulatory sequences than the CNEs. Indeed,
we found that O. niloticus and M. zebra exhibited significant divergence in their TFBS profiles for six of the
seven proximal promoters examined (Figure 3); however, following correction for multiple hypothesis testing, only five of these remained significant: SWS1,
SWS2A, RH2B, RH2A and RH2A (Figure 3; see also
Table 3). O. niloticus and M. zebra differ dramatically in
the expression of each of these genes [32], suggesting
that their divergent transcription factor profiles could
explain these differences. A comparison of which TFBS
differ between O. niloticus and M. zebra reveals a slight
over-representation of CRX sites in O. niloticus (17 vs.
7), and of THRa sites in M. zebra (4 vs. 0) (Figure 3).
Using phylogenetic shadowing, we identified five
cichlid opsins with promoter sequences that exhibit significant divergence in their binding site profiles for 12
transcription factors. We note, however, that by focusing
on only these TFBSs, we potentially miss many interesting patterns of divergence in transcription factors that
have not already been associated with vertebrate opsin
expression. A comprehensive search of all TFBSs identified by TESS could potentially pick up these missed patterns, but such a search would be extremely
cumbersome and subject to many false positives [66].

Figure 3 Transcription factor binding site diversity within opsin proximal promoters. A - G) Distribution of ten transcription factor binding
sites (TFBS) in the proximal promoters of each opsin in O. niloticus and M. zebra. TFBS labelled in blue are present in O. niloticus only, those in
red are present in M. zebra only, and those in black are found in both species. Sites labelled simply RAR correspond to all three retinoic acid
paralogs. The orientation of factors above or below the central reference line has no special meaning, although O. niloticus-only sites are
generally above the line, and M. zebra-only sites are below it. H) Comparison of the average number of binding sites for each transcription factor
in the proximal promoters of the opsins and seven randomly-selected, non-opsin genes in O. niloticus. On average, the opsins contain
significantly greater numbers of binding sites for these transcription factors compared to the non-opsin genes.

Because of their small size, TFBS motifs are likely to
appear throughout the genome frequently by chance,
and it is difficult to determine which are likely to be
functional based on sequence matches alone. Therefore,
we opted to focus on genes that are obvious candidates
for analysis.
We performed an additional analysis to determine the
relevance of these twelve candidate factors by comparing
the number of TFBSs found for each factor within the
proximal promoters of the opsins and seven randomly
chosen non-opsin genes. We hypothesized that if these
candidates are relevant to the control of opsin expression in cichlids, then we should find a significantly
greater number of TFBSs for each factor upstream of
the opsin genes compared to the non-opsin genes.
Indeed, we found that the opsins contain a greater number of binding sites for eight out of ten factors compared to the randomly-chosen non-opsin genes
(Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test: V = 50, p = 0.0124;
Figure 3H). The non-opsin promoters contained higher
mean numbers of TFBSs for AP-1 and THRa only. This
result suggests that the proximal promoters of the
opsins are significantly enriched for the binding sites of
transcription factors that influence vertebrate opsin
expression. This enrichment also suggests that polymorphisms in these regions could conceivably lead to
functional differences in transcription factor binding and
opsin expression. However, we note that we found no
significant correlation between distance matrices of the
opsins based on these TFBS profiles and their expression in developing O. niloticus (data not shown). This
additional result suggests that, although binding sites for
many of these candidate transcription factors may be
over-represented in the promoters of opsins, they do
not predict which opsins are co-expressed in African
cichlids.
The search parameters we have chosen aim to identify
TFBSs with high confidence while still accounting for
the observation that many transcription factors exhibit
degenerate binding of DNA motifs [67,68], and can bind
these motifs in an orientation-independent manner
[69,70]. We are currently performing a quantitative
genetic analysis of many markers located across the genome in order to identify other loci and transcription factors that may be associated with cichlid opsin
expression. This quantitative genetic analysis should
provide an unbiased search for additional transcription
factors that may influence cichlid opsin expression.
Analysis of opsin 3’-UTRs
Phylogenetic footprinting of opsin 3’-UTRs

In addition to mutations within conserved non-coding
elements and 5’ promoter regions, polymorphisms
within 3’-UTRs can also act as cis-regulatory alleles

Page 11 of 23

[16,17]. These polymorphisms affect gene expression by
altering the binding of miRNAs in a manner analogous
to how mutations within TFBS can alter gene expression, except that miRNAs inhibit gene expression posttranscriptionally. Our phylogenetic footprinting analysis
reveals that every opsin exhibits some conservation of
the 50 - 100 bp region found directly downstream of
the opsin coding sequences (Figure 1). Generally, this
conservation is strongest between O. niloticus, O.
latipes, and G. aculeatus, reflecting the close phylogenetic relationship among these species. For RH2A, the 3’
conserved region extends nearly 700 bp past the end of
the coding region. Initially, these results suggest that the
opsin 3’-UTRs of cichlids will be highly conserved,
reflecting the strong evolutionary constraint on UTR
sequence and function seen in both flies and humans
[16,71]. However, a recent survey of polymorphisms
affecting miRNA target sites in cichlids found that the
3’-UTR of some genes may in fact be under divergent
selection in African cichlids [72]. Therefore, we searched
the 3’-UTRs of the opsins for target sites corresponding
to known fish miRNAs.
Of the 30 known miRNA targets we searched for in
cichlids (see below), we found at least one target site in
each opsin 3’-UTR that was conserved among cichlids
and other teleosts (Table 4). Many of these conserved
sites are expressed within the retina of vertebrates and
play a role in retinal development [73-76]. For example,
dre-miR-217, dre-miR-181a, and dre-miR-23b are all
integral to the development and maintenance of the
zebrafish retina [77-79], while dre-miR-96 and dre-miR182a are sensory organ-specific [76]. Only one conserved site that was found in cichlids and other teleosts
differed between O. niloticus and M. zebra. A target for
dre-miR-722, found downstream of the LWS opsin in O.
niloticus and the pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), is missing in the orthologous 3’-UTR from M. zebra due to a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). However, the
two conserved target sites for dre-miR-722 and dremiR-728 are both found within the 3’-UTRs of several
Lake Victorian cichlids (data not shown). Like O. niloticus, Lake Victoria’s cichlids express the long wavelength
opsin palette as adults [80], possibly indicating that
these factors play a role in LWS expression. If we interpret evolutionary conservation as an indication of function, we believe the conserved sites listed in Table 4
represent those miRNA target sites that are most likely
to regulate opsin expression in African cichlids. The
sequences of all O. niloticus and M. zebra opsin 3’UTRs are available in Additional file 5.

* This site present in O. niloticus only

fish miRNAs [54]. In all, we identified 84 predicted target sites matching 30 known miRNAs from cichlids and
D. rerio (Additional file 7). Like the CNEs and promoter
regions analyzed earlier, all 3’-UTR sequences generally
exhibited high similarity between O. niloticus and M.
zebra. The average pairwise divergence (Dxy) for O. niloticus and M. zebra 3’-UTRs was 5.2% (± 1% s.e.). This
small level of divergence is very similar to the level
observed for opsin coding sequences, though it did not
differ from the average Dxy of introns (9.5%, t-test: t27,
0.05 = 1.33, p = 0.196). Consequently, the results of our
miRNA target search were once again very similar for
O. niloticus and M. zebra, especially for those sites conserved in other fishes as well (Additional file 7; Table 4,
see above). However, we still found that O. niloticus and
M. zebra differed significantly in the proportion of
divergent and shared miRNA target sites for the 3’UTRs of the RH2B and SWS2B opsins (exact binomial
tests: RH2B, divergent miRNA sites = 4, total miRNA
sites = 8, P div = 50.0%, p = 0.002; SWS2B, divergent
miRNA sites = 4, total miRNA sites = 5, Pdiv = 80.0%, p
< 0.001; see Table 3). These results did not change
when we altered the null hypothesis to reflect the divergence of each opsin’s intronic sequence (data not
shown). For RH2B, we found that M. zebra exhibited
four unique target sites for miRs-101, 144, 196, and
2184. For SWS2B, M. zebra had unique targets for miRNAs-194 and 23, while O. niloticus had targets for miRNAs -92 and 137. RH2B is strongly differentially
expressed in these two species, while SWS2B is only
expressed in some adults of O. niloticus [81]. Thus, we
not only identified at least 8 conserved–and perhaps
core–miRNA target sites in the 3’-UTR of each cichlid
opsin (Table 4), we also found that O. niloticus and M.
zebra are significantly divergent in at least two of these
regions (SWS2B and RH2B).
It is important to note that most miRNA target sites
we identified in the 3’-UTRs of the cichlid opsins correspond to miRNAs that are expressed in the vertebrate
retina (Additional file 7). Of sites corresponding to 30

different miRNAs, 22 (73%) correspond to miRNAs
expressed within the retinas of fish, mammals, or
amphibians (Additional file 7). Notably, however, we did
not find any miRNA target sites that correspond to
miR-726, the miRNA found upstream of the LWS opsin
and encoded by CNE 7a (see Figure 2). Further, many
of the conserved and non-conserved miRNA target sites
we identify also correspond to miRNAs associated with
retinal development (for example, dre-miRs 23, 92, 722,
and 194) [76,82,83], and miR-129 is also associated with
retinoblastoma in humans [84]. Given that O. niloticus
and M. zebra differ dramatically in their developmental
patterns of opsin gene expression, it is interesting to
speculate that these miRNAs could contribute to the
developmental differences in opsin expression observed
between these and other African cichlid species [32,85]
In the present study we have focused on miRNA target sites found within the 3’-UTR of the cichlid opsins,
but miRNA cleavage of messenger RNAs by binding to
sites within core messenger RNA sequences has also
been demonstrated in humans and plants [86,87]. It is
still not clear whether miRNAs regulate gene expression
more often by binding to the 3’-UTR or messenger
RNA sequence, although a review by Bartel [88] suggested that translational repression by binding to UTR
sequences is more prominent. Finally, we note also that
the cellular machinery cannot distinguish between functional and non-functional miRNA target sites based on
their evolutionary conservation in other species, as we
do here [88] (see Table 4). However, given that scans
for miRNA target sites can have a high rate of false
positives, evolutionary conservation is currently the best
way to avoid high error rates and to infer function. The
fact that we identified a high percentage of target sites
that correspond to miRNAs found within the vertebrate
eye suggests that many of these sites are not false-positives; therefore, it is plausible that they may actually
function to regulate opsin expression in cichlids. In the
future we will determine whether these and other miRNAs are actually expressed in the retinas of African

O’Quin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:120

cichlids. If so, then heterologous reporter assays could
be used to verify what role divergence in miRNA target
sites may play in the evolution of cichlid opsin expression [89,90].
Phylogenetic shadowing among the cichlids of Lake
Malawi
Resequencing and analysis of LWS-LCR, opsin promoters,
and 3’-UTRs

Two broad goals of this study have been to (1) identify
potential cis-regulatory sequences surrounding the opsin
gene arrays of African cichlids (phylogenetic footprinting), and (2) identify those sequences whose divergence
may explain patterns of differential opsin gene expression among African cichlids (phylogenetic shadowing).
For both goals we have relied on sequenced BAC clones
of Oreochromis niloticus and Metriaclima zebra–two
species that have BAC libraries available, but that also
differ dramatically in their evolutionary age (~18 MY
[33]) and adult and developmental patterns of opsin
expression [32]. Therefore, as a final goal, we wanted to
determine whether the candidate cis-regulatory sites we
identified via phylogenetic shadowing also vary among a
more closely related (~2 MY [33]) panel of 18 cichlid
species from Lake Malawi. Although much more closely
related to M. zebra than O. niloticus, adults of these
species exhibit the same opsin expression patterns as
adult and juvenile O. niloticus [23,24,26]. Our panel
included one individual from six species for each of the
three adult opsin expression palettes observed among
Lake Malawi’s cichlids (short-, middle-, and long-wavelength sensitive) (see Additional file 8 for a list of the
species used). The regions we re-sequenced included the
proximal promoters upstream of the SWS1, SWS2A,
SWS2B, RH2B, and LWS opsins (highlighted in blue in
Figure 1), the LWS-LCR (CNE 7), and the 3’-UTRs of
the SWS2B and LWS opsins. After sequencing, we
examined these regions for levels of interspecific polymorphism and performed a test of association for cisregulatory alleles.
Although the 18 Lake Malawi cichlid species we use
have been previously characterized with regard to opsin
gene expression, we confirmed these gene expression
results by measuring the expression of each opsin in all
species via RT-qPCR (see Additional File 8 for opsin
expression results). These expression results were highly
concordant with previous measurements [26]. Following
qPCR, we re-sequenced the entire 1 kb region upstream
of both the SWS1 and SWS2A opsins, 956 bp upstream
of the LWS opsin, 951 bp upstream of the RH2B opsin,
and 694 bp upstream of the SWS2B opsin. We also resequenced 900 bp surrounding the LWS-LCR (CNE 7)
and 450 bp downstream of the SWS2B and LWS opsins.
As expected given the young age of Lake Malawi

Page 13 of 23

cichlids, we found that all regions were highly conserved
among the species sampled. Overall, we identified fewer
than 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
insertion/deletions (indels) per region examined (Table
5). In each case, most SNPs were found in only one
individual. Other diversity statistics–including the total
number of segregating sites (S), total number of singletons (s), number of haplotypes (H), nucleotide diversity
(π), sequence conservation (C), and Tajima’s D (TD)–
also indicate low levels of polymorphism, despite our
use of alternate species and genera as sampling units
(see Additional file 8 for a list of all polymorphisms
found among the 18 species sampled). Nevertheless, following a sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity
(π) and minor allele frequency (MAF), we were able to
identify several peaks of relatively highπ and MAF
within each region (Figure 4). These peaks correspond
to SNPs and indels segregating at high frequency within
the species and genera sampled, and therefore represent
potential cis-regulatory alleles.
Several peaks of relatively high nucleotide diversity
and MAF correspond to polymorphisms within predicted CRX binding sites, but none correspond to any
other TFBS or miRNA target sites (Table 5). Specifically,
two peaks of π and MAF located -217 and -224 bp
upstream of the SWS2A translation start site (TSS) correspond to a single SNP and 8 bp indel that both disrupt putative CRX binding sites. The 8 bp indel located
at SWS2A-217 completely eliminates the CRX binding
site in several species (Additional file 8). We identified
at least three other polymorphisms upstream of the
SWS1 and RH2B opsins that also disrupt CRX binding
sites–each present in only a single species–but no polymorphisms that interrupt the binding sites of any other

candidate transcription factors. One peak of nucleotide
diversity at position 183 of CNE 7 (see Additional file 5
for this sequence) corresponds to a SNP within the
miRNA miR-726; however, this mutation does not occur
within the mature miRNA sequence. Finally, we found
only three polymorphisms total within the 3’-UTR of
both the SWS2B and LWS opsins (Figure 4; Additional
file 8), none of which interrupted predicted miRNA target sites. The polymorphism that segregates between O.
niloticus and M. zebra within the LWS 3’-UTR was
fixed in all Lake Malawi cichlid species (see Table 4).
Thus, few of the polymorphisms we identify in the

putative cis-regulatory sequences of the opsins are predicted to alter opsin expression among 18 Lake Malawi
cichlid species. However, since mutations within transcription factor binding sites have been shown to alter
gene expression [91], our results suggest that polymorphisms within CRX TFBSs could contribute to the
differential patterns of SWS2A expression observed
among Lake Malawi cichlids.
Association between polymorphisms and cichlid opsin
expression

To test this hypothesis, we performed allelic association
tests between these and other SNPs underlying peaks of

O’Quin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:120

nucleotide diversity and high MAF (see Figure 4) with
the expression of their nearest downstream opsin (Table
6). Three polymorphisms (SWS2A-217, RH2B-161, CNE
7-570) exhibited significant or marginally non-significant
associations with the expression of their downstream
opsins (Table 6); however only RH2B-161 is significant
following Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (t-tests: RH2B-161: t17, 0.05 = 3.447, p = 0.0036).
Despite this limitation, we believe these preliminary
results are compelling since all three polymorphisms
occur on the same linkage group (LG 5) believed to
contain a cis-regulatory element that modulates cichlid
opsin expression, and all three are associated with
opsins whose expression is significantly associated with
this QTL in African cichlids [29]. SWS2A-217 obliterates
a CRX binding site in numerous cichlids, and polymorphisms affecting CRX binding sites have been
shown to modulate SWS2 opsin expression in zebrafish
[41]. CNE 7-570 is found very near the LWS-LCR and
could potentially affect LCR binding. It is therefore possible that all three alleles acts as, or are linked to, cisregulatory elements that modulate opsin expression in
cichlids.
We acknowledge that the sample sizes we use for phylogenetic shadowing among Lake Malawi’s cichlids are
small and at best provide a weak test for cis-regulatory
alleles associated with opsin expression. Additionally, we
use cross species and genera comparisons for an analysis
that is generally based on individual variation within
populations. However, Lake Malawi cichlids are extremely similar at the genetic level and share many ancestral polymorphisms [92]. For this reason, genetic
analyses across cichlid species are analogous to within-

species polymorphism studies in other vertebrates, such
as chimps and humans [72,92]. Additionally, recent
work in cichlids has successfully used cross-species
comparisons to fine-map cis-regulatory alleles underlying pigmentation differences, so long as these differences have a common origin among the different
species sampled [93]. It is hard to predict which traits
will have a common origin among different African
cichlid species, as previous work [94] suggested that the
pigmentation trait mapped in Roberts et al. [93] had
evolved several times. Our recent work reconstructing
the evolution of opsin regulatory changes in cichlids
revealed that the three opsin expression palettes have
evolved repeatedly among cichlids in Lakes Tanganyika
and Malawi [27], but it is still unclear whether or not
the three palettes have a common origin among Lake
Malawi’s cichlids. But despite our small sample size, we
have found some evidence of binding site turnover in
CRX binding sites within the 5’ promoters of Lake
Malawi cichlids, but no evidence of turnover in other
candidates TFBS or miRNA target sites. Additionally,
we also identified three putative cis-regulatory polymorphisms associated with SWS2A, RH2B, and LWS
opsin expression. Although very preliminary, these
results offer compelling candidates for additional functional and association analyses between more closely
related cichlid populations and species.
The search for cis-regulatory sequences

Cis-regulatory sequences may reside many kilobases
away from the genes they regulate, as in the case of
enhancer or repressor elements; or they may be found
very near their genetic targets, as in the case of promoter elements and UTRs. Given this diversity, is it possible to predict which non-coding regions are most likely
to contain functional cis-regulatory alleles? If we accept
estimates of pairwise sequence divergence (Dxy) as indicative of those regions most likely to contain functional
opsin regulatory alleles, then our estimates of D xy
between O. niloticus and M. zebra suggest that the
proximal promoter regions are most likely to contain
cis-regulatory alleles that alter opsin expression (Figure
5A; see also Additional file 9 for a list of Dxy values for
every region examined). The opsin promoters exhibit
the highest levels of pairwise sequence divergence of all
coding and non-coding regions examined, and also contain more sequences with divergent TFBS profiles (Figure 3; Table 3), and putative regulatory alleles (Table 6).
However, this conclusion is undoubtedly influenced by
what could be a naive choice of promoter sequences
(the true functional opsin promoter regions have not yet
been identified in cichlids and may be more highly conserved), increased length of the promoter sequence relative to other regions analyzed (we analyzed 1 kb for

each promoter versus ~ 400 bp for each CNE and
UTR), and the increased power to detect significant
divergence from null expectations afforded by the large
number of TFBS found within the proximal promoters
(we found ~ 22 TFBS within each promoter versus ~ 6
TFBS/miRNA target sites within each CNE and UTR).
If the overall proportion of divergent TFBS/miRNA
target sites (Pdiv) is used to identify those non-coding
regions most likely to contain functional cis-regulatory
alleles, the proximal promoter regions still exhibit the
highest proportion of divergent regulatory regions,
although the advantage is only slight. Only about 55% of
TFBS are shared between O. niloticus and M. zebra promoters, while 45% are divergent (Figure 5B). In contrast,
the CNEs and 3’-UTRs exhibit lower (and very similar)
proportions of shared versus divergent TFBS/miRNA
target sites (~ 67% shared and ~ 33% divergent; Figure
5B). In this case, it is difficult to confidently conclude
that 5’ promoter regions are more likely to contain
functional alleles that regulate opsin expression,
although the data are suggestive. When both pairwise
divergence and the proportion divergent TFBS/miRNA
target sites are taken into account, we find that regions
that exhibit statistically significant divergence are not
necessarily those regions that exhibit greater pairwise
sequence divergence (Figure 5C). In fact, the regions
with the highest Pdiv also exhibit some of the lowest Dxy
values. This result suggests that the increased number
of statistically divergent promoter regions we observe is
not a function of sequence divergence, but rather
increased statistical power afforded by the greater length
of the sequences surveyed and the greater number of
TFBS found.
Additionally, our results show that the majority of the
non-coding regions examined exhibit P div values near
37%, with a median of 30% (Figure 5C). This observation suggests that the 8% divergence criterion we used
as null model for evolutionary divergence is likely too
low and also suggests that our power for many regions
was inadequate due to the small number of TFBS or
miRNA target sites identified (see above). But even
when a more liberal null divergence value of 30% is
used, our results largely remain consistent: O. niloticus
and M. zebra still exhibit significant divergence in their
TFBS and miRNA target profiles for CNEs 3 and 4
(located near the SWS2A opsin), the proximal promoters
for RH2B and SWS1, and the 3’-UTR for SWS2B (p <
0.05; see Table 3 for Pdiv values).
Finally, we note that many putative regulatory regions
identified in our opsin-containing BACS are highly conserved among many phenotypically diverse cichlid species from Lake Malawi, as well as between the ~18 MY
divergent Oreochromis niloticus and Metriaclima zebra.
This conservation suggests that trans-acting factors may

also play an important role in generating evolutionary
changes in cichlid opsin expression. For example, in
both yeast and humans, interspecific differences in gene
expression are primarily the result of trans-regulatory
factors [95,96]. And although cis-regulatory alleles contribute more to interspecific differences in gene expression among several Drosophila species, trans-acting
alleles generally contribute to these differences as well
[97]. Coding mutations within trans-acting transcription
factors can act in a modular fashion, thereby mitigating
negative pleiotropic effects [98], and these mutations
may still affect gene expression even when the sites they
bind remain conserved [99], as many of the TFBSs we
examine are. Also, in addition to the putative cis-regulatory factors associated with SWS2B, SWS2A, and RH2B
opsin expression in cichlids, Carleton et al. [29] also
identified one trans-acting locus in the same cross, as
well as another trans-acting locus in a separate cross.
These two loci, located on cichlid LGs 13 and 4, do not
occur in linkage with the cichlid opsins and explain a
higher portion of the variance in opsin expression than
the single cis-associated factor on LG 5 [29]. Whether
these sites represent transcription factors, miRNAs, or
other trans-acting binding sites is unknown, but several
good candidate genes are located in these regions.
Future work will aim to map and characterize these
putative trans-regulatory regions in a variety of cichlid
taxa.

Conclusions
Mutations within cis-regulatory regions are compelling
candidates for the adaptive evolution of gene expression
[3]. Here we generated and surveyed non-coding
sequences surrounding the opsin gene arrays of two
African cichlids, Oreochromis niloticus and Metriaclima
zebra. This study is the first to systematically survey the
cichlid opsins for putative cis-regulatory sequences, and
our results suggest that these regions could potentially
contribute to variation in cichlid opsin expression. The
results of our study reveal:
(1) The presence of numerous conserved non-coding
elements located up- and downstream of the opsins
that may function as regulators of cichlid opsin
expression, including a retinal miRNA and one
known opsin enhancer (LWS-LCR). African cichlids
were divergent in two of these (CNEs 3 and 4, both
located upstream of the SWS2A opsin).
(2) Significant divergence and enrichment of transcription factor binding sites within the proximal
promoter of five of the seven opsins (SWS1, SWS2A,
RH2B, RH2A, and RH2A).
(3) Numerous target sites for retinal and sensory
organ-specific miRNAs within the 3’-UTR of each

Page 17 of 23

opsin. African cichlids were divergent in two of their
opsin 3’-UTRs (SWS2B and RH2B).
(4) The presence of several candidate cis-regulatory
alleles located within the promoters of the RH2B
and SWS2A opsins, as well as one near the LWSLCR (CNE 7).
Future work will aim to further characterize these
candidate cis-regulatory sequences, as well as to identify
candidate trans-acting alleles. Given that spectral sensitivity and opsin expression in vertebrates can be influenced by coding mutations [26,80,100], trans-regulatory
mutations [29], cis-regulatory mutations [41], and possibly miRNAs as well, cichlids may represent an ideal system in which to examine how these various molecular
mechanisms interact to influence the evolution of visual
system diversity in vertebrates.

Methods
Sequencing and assembly of BAC clones

We isolated clones containing the opsin genes from BAC
libraries of two African cichlids, Oreochromis niloticus [30]
and Metriaclima zebra [31]. For O. niloticus, we used PCR
to screen pooled clones from the T3 and T4 libraries [30].
Primers used for these screens were: SWS1 (F: TACCTGCAGGCTGCCTTTAT; R: CTCGCATGGAGGCTAAGAAC), RH2A (F: GCAGACCCGATCTTCTTCAA; R:
AGCAGACGTGATTGTGATGG), and LWS (F:
TCCTGTGCTACCTTGCTGTG; R: ACAACGACCATCCTGGAGAC). We first chose 10 super-pools, each
covering 10% of the entire 35,000 pooled clones, and
screened them for opsin-positive plates. We then screened
row and column pools from the plates with positive results
to identify the exact clones containing the opsins. Fingerprinted contigs (FPCs) corresponding to the positive
clones were identified and all clones in the contig were
PCR tested for the opsins (see Additional file 10). Contig
geometries were confirmed by end sequencing the BACs,
designing primers, and PCR testing (Additional file 10).
Based on the resulting alignments, one clone for each
opsin array was selected for sequencing.
DNA from the selected clones was prepared using the
Qiagen® MaxiPrep Plasmid Purification kit following the
manufacturer’s protocols. The O. niloticus clones were
sent to the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) for ABI-Sanger
sequencing. Shotgun libraries were prepared and 4 ×
384-well plates were sequenced using ABI technology in
both forward and reverse directions. The resulting reads
were base-called and assembled with phred [101] and
phrap [102]. Additional reads for the SWS1-containing
clone were generated using 454 Life Sciences technology
[103]. We performed two different sequencing runs for
this clone, assembled them into contigs, and combined
them with the JGI ABI reads in Sequencher v4.9 (Gene

O’Quin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/120

Codes Corporation, Inc.). This resulted in several large
but non-overlapping contigs. To finish joining these
contigs we used BLAST [104] and Pipmaker [45] to
identify and align the largest contigs to orthologous
genomic regions from the genomes of other teleost fish
(for an example see Additional File 2). Based on these
alignments we designed PCR primers to sequence across
the gaps to join the contigs.
For M. zebra we screened high-density BAC array filters using filter hybridization [31]. This search utilized
PCR probes generated from M. zebra retinal cDNAs
that were labeled using the ECL Nucleic Acid Labelling
and Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). We
obtained three clones from these arrays and confirmed
that they contained the opsins via PCR as detailed
above. DNA for these clones was prepared using the
Qiagen® MaxiPrep kit following the manufacture’s protocols. BAC clones were sized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis following digestion with NotI. We then sent
the purified, sized samples to 454 Life Sciences (Branford, CT) for sequencing on the GS20. We performed
two sequencing runs on the SWS1 and LWS-containing
clones, but only one for the clone containing RH2A. All
runs utilized a quarter plate. Due to the length of the
454 reads, the resulting sequences formed more, but
smaller contigs relative to O. niloticus. To finish joining
these contigs we aligned the largest (> 5 kb) contigs to
the finished O. niloticus BAC sequences in Sequencher
v4.9 and once again designed PCR primers to sequence
across the gaps. We annotated the BAC sequences for
both O. niloticus and M. zebra using BLAST [104].
Finally, we performed a global alignment of each BAC
from O. niloticus and M. zebra in the program
wgVISTA [105]. We measured sequence similarity and
divergence across each BAC using the phylip program
dnadist, implemented in the Mobyle online bioinformatics server [106]. When measuring pairwise sequence
divergence (Dxy), we used the Jukes-Cantor nucleotide
model to correct for multiple hits. We repeated these
measurements for each of the CNEs, promoter regions,
and 3’-UTRs. We compared Dxy among each of these
regions and the entire BAC sequences using t-tests
implemented in the statistical software package R
v2.10.0 [107]. Prior to performing all tests, we transformed the D xy scores by log 10 in order to meet the
assumption of normality of errors.
Phylogenetic analyses

We generated phylogenies of the teleost RH2 and SWS2
opsins in order to identify orthologous opsins among
the focal fish genomes examined. We accessed all relevant opsin sequences from the genome assemblies listed
above via BLAT. We aligned both opsin data sets using
the E-INS-i strategy of the multiple alignment program

Page 18 of 23

MAFFT v6.0 [108] and then chose an appropriate
model of nucleotide substitution via the program jModelTest v0.1.1 [109]. This model was TIM3ef+G for
both the RH2 and SWS2 alignments. We then used this
model and the corresponding parameters estimated by
jModelTest to generate Neighbor-Joining trees for the
opsins with Maximum Likelihood-corrected distances.
For the RH2/SWS2 datasets, these parameters included
the nucleotide substitution rate matrix (A-C: 0.601/
0.617; A-G: 1.470/1.734; A-T: 1.00/1.00; C-G: 0.601/
0.617; C-T: 2.729/2.877; G-T: 0.599/0.155) and the
shape of the gamma distribution (0.507/0.577). We measured the nodal support of these trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates. We rooted both trees using the LWS-1
opsin of zebrafish.
Identification of conserved non-coding elements

We used phylogenetic footprinting [18] to identify putative cis-regulatory elements by searching for conserved
non-coding elements (CNEs) surrounding the opsin
gene arrays. To do this, we identified 100-300 kb
regions of orthology between the O. niloticus BAC
sequences and the genome assemblies of four teleost
fishes using BLAT and the UCSC genome browser. The
additional genomes were stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Broad Institute v1.0, February 2006), medaka
(Oryzias latipes, National Institute of Genetics and the
University of Tokyo v1.0, October 2005), pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis, Geoscope and Broad Institute v7,
February 2004), and zebrafish (Danio rerio, Trust Sanger
Institute zv8, December 2008). We then determined the
location of known opsin genes and examined synteny
across these regions via DOT plots generated in the
program PipMaker [45] (for an example see Additional
File 2). Regions of high synteny surrounding the opsins
were then identified using MultiPipMaker [46]. We
defined a CNE as any region ≥ 50 bp long that was conserved (> 60% sequence identity) between Oreochromis
niloticus and at least one other teleost species (Oryzias
latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and Tetraodon nigroviridis). In each case, we attempted to analyze as many
CNEs as possible, but acknowledge that some small
regions may have been missed.
Profiling of transcription factor binding sites and
Phylogenetic shadowing

We identified binding sites within each CNE as well as
the proximal promoters located approximately 1 kb
upstream of each opsin’s translation start site using the
Transcription Element Search System, TESS v6.0 [63].
We altered the default search parameters of TESS by
changing the minimum log-likelihood ratio score from
12 to 9. We then limited our search results to high
quality matches by accepting only those hits that met

O’Quin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/120

three criteria: (1) a log-likelihood (La) score ≥ 9.0, (2) a
ratio of the actual log-likelihood score to the maximum
possible log-likelihood (Lq) score ≥ 80%, and (3) a probability value for the log-likelihood score (L pv ) < 0.05.
Although TESS can potentially identify binding sites for
many different transcription factors, we were primarily
interested in those factors that have been shown to
influence opsin expression in fish and other vertebrates
(Table 1). Following the automated search in TESS, we
manually searched the lists for duplicate sites at each
position, and removed them prior to further analysis.
For phylogenetic shadowing, we analyzed the number
of shared and divergent transcription factor binding
sites found in each CNE and opsin proximal promoter
from O. niloticus and M. zebra. We counted the total
number of binding sites orthologous in both species, as
well as those that were found in only one species or the
other. We calculated the proportion of divergent TFBSs
(Pdiv) as (D/(D+S))*100, where D is the number of divergent TFBS and S is the number of shared sites. We
compared the observed proportion of divergent sites to
the null proportion suggested by the global sequence
similarity of the O. niloticus and M. zebra BACs (92%
versus 8%). We tested the independence between these
observed and expected proportions using exact binomial
tests [110] implemented in the R statistical software
package. To control the Type I error rate for each
region examined, we calculated Bonferroni-corrected pvalues for all tests in R. For phylogenetic shadowing
between O. niloticus and M. zebra, the corrected significance threshold was a = 0.05/31 = 0.0016.
Finally, we also compared the average number of
binding sites for each transcription factor between the
proximal promoters of the O. niloticus opsins and seven
randomly chosen, non-opsin genes from a draft assembly of the O. niloticus genome (available at http://www.
BouillaBase.org; accessed October 2010). These genes
were ACTG1, AMPD3, DHCR7, ENSGAC000000020282,
IGFALS, KCNJ9, and REEP1. Proximal promoters from
these randomly chosen sequences were identified based
on comparison of the O. niloticus genes with orthologous regions from the stickleback genome. Comparison
of the average number of binding sites across all opsins
and transcription factors was performed using a Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test computed in R.
Comparison of opsin expression and TF binding site
profiles

We evaluated the correlation between the transcription
factor binding sites in the proximal promoter of each
opsin and the expression of each opsin among developing O. niloticus fry using Mantel’s test of two distance
matrices. We generated Euclidean distance matrices of
the total number of binding sites for 12 transcription

Page 19 of 23

factors within the proximal promoter region of each
opsin as well as the percent of total opsin expression
from developing O. niloticus fry, reported in Carleton et
al. [32]. We calculated Mantel’s test using the ‘mantel.
randtest’ function from the R package ade4 [111].
Approximate p-values were calculated following 500
randomizations of each matrix. All transcription factor
numbers and expression values were standardized prior
to clustering. We also expanded this analysis to the
entire proximal promoter region after calculating a
sequence similarity matrix for the entire proximal promoter using the phylip program dnadist.
Profiling of microRNAs target sites

We searched the 3’-UTRs of each opsin for binding sites
matching the target seed of known miRNAs (miRNA)
via the SeedMatch algorithm previously used to identify
miRNA targets in cichlid UTRs [72]. This algorithm is
similar to the TargetScanS algorithm used in other studies to identify miRNA targets [112]. Briefly, non-redundant fish miRNA targets were obtained from miRBase
(http://www.mirbase.org[54]; accessed June 2010) and
supplemented with several miRNA target sequences
identified in cichlids [72]. We searched each opsin 3’UTR–defined as the ~500 bp region between the transcription end site and the polyadenylation site
(AATAAA)–for sequences matching the seeds of miRNAs from this non-redundant library. In order to
account for the high rate of false-positives generated by
simply searching for matching seed sites, we aligned the
3’-UTR of each cichlid opsin with those from G. aculeatus, O. latipes, T. nigrovirdis, the Japanese pufferfish
(Tetrapdon rubripes), and D. rerio in order to identify
sites that were conserved across multiple fish species.
For this purpose we defined the first 1 kb of sequence
downstream of these latter species’ opsins as the 3’-UTR
and aligned these to the cichlid sequences with MLagan
[113]. To account for errors in the alignment of orthologous 3’-UTRs, we counted as conserved the same
miRNA target site found within 50 bp of each other
across species. For cichlid opsins that lacked orthologs
in the other species, we used the nearest paralog (see
Additional file 4).
Resequencing of putative regulatory sequences in Lake
Malawi cichlids

We generated a panel of 18 Lake Malawi cichlids that
vary in opsin gene expression. In one individual per species, we sequenced approximately 1 kb of DNA
upstream of the translation start site for five opsins and
CNE 7, as well as 0.5 kb downstream of the SWS2B and
LWS opsins. We generated primers for these regions
based on the O. niloticus and M. zebra BAC assemblies.
The taxa sampled are listed in Additional file 11 along

O’Quin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:120
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/120

with their GenBank accession numbers; the primers
used to generate these sequences are listed in Additional
File 12. We measured opsin expression for each individual following the protocols described in Spady et al.
[28] and Hofmann et al. [26]. Described briefly, we dissected whole retinas from individual fish and extracted
whole RNA from them using Qiagen Qiashredder and
RNeasy RNA extraction kits (Valencia, CA). We quantified each RNA sample via spectral absorption, and then
reverse transcribed 0.5 μg using Superscript III (Invitrogen). We used previously developed Taqman primers
and probes to individually quantify the expression of
each opsin in these samples; however, as in our previous
studies [26,28], we quantified the expression of the two
RH2A paralogs jointly. Reaction efficiencies for each
opsin were standardized relative to an internal construct
developed especially for this purpose and described in
Spady et al. [28].
Following re-sequencing of the candidate cis-regulatory regions, we estimated polymorphism statistics for
the resulting sequences, and also performed a slidingwindow analysis of nucleotide diversity (π), in the program DnaSP v5 [114]. For the sliding-window analysis,
we ignored all gaps and specified a window length of 50
bp and a step size of 10 bp. Finally, we calculated the
statistical association between polymorphisms found in
CRX binding sites and other peaks of nucleotide diversity among the sampled taxa using linear regression in
the program gPLINK v1.07 [115]. For each test, we estimated the association of each locus with the expression
of its downstream opsin under an additive genetic
model, using membership in one of two major phylogenetic clades (mbuna and utaka; see Additional file 8) as
a covariate.
