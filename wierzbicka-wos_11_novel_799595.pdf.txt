Abstract
Background: b-D-Galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing b-D-galactose
residues in b-D-galactosides. Cold-active b-D-galactosidases have recently become a focus of attention of
researchers and dairy product manufactures owing to theirs ability to: (i) eliminate of lactose from refrigerated milk
for people afflicted with lactose intolerance, (ii) convert lactose to glucose and galactose which increase the
sweetness of milk and decreases its hydroscopicity, and (iii) eliminate lactose from dairy industry pollutants
associated with environmental problems. Moreover, in contrast to commercially available mesophilic b-Dgalactosidase from Kluyveromyces lactis the cold-active counterparts could make it possible both to reduce the risk
of mesophiles contamination and save energy during the industrial process connected with lactose hydrolysis.
Results: A genomic DNA library was constructed from soil bacterium Paracoccus sp. 32d. Through screening of the
genomic DNA library on LB agar plates supplemented with X-Gal, a novel gene encoding a cold-active b-Dgalactosidase was isolated. The in silico analysis of the enzyme amino acid sequence revealed that the b-Dgalactosidase Paracoccus sp. 32d is a novel member of Glycoside Hydrolase Family 2. However, owing to the lack
of a BGal_small_N domain, the domain characteristic for the LacZ enzymes of the GH2 family, it was decided to
call the enzyme under study ‘BgaL’. The bgaL gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli using the pBAD
Expression System. The purified recombinant BgaL consists of two identical subunits with a combined molecular
weight of about 160 kDa. The BgaL was optimally active at 40°C and pH 7.5. Moreover, BgaL was able to hydrolyze
both lactose and o-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside at 10°C with Km values of 2.94 and 1.17 mM and kcat values
43.23 and 71.81 s-1, respectively. One U of the recombinant BgaL would thus be capable hydrolyzing about 97% of
the lactose in 1 ml of milk in 24 h at 10°C.
Conclusions: A novel bgaL gene was isolated from Paracoccus sp. 32d encoded a novel cold-active b-Dgalactosidase. An E. coli expression system has enabled efficient production of soluble form of BgaL Paracoccus sp.
32d. The amino acid sequence analysis of the BgaL enzyme revealed notable differences in comparison to the
result of the amino acid sequences analysis of well-characterized cold-active b-D-galactosidases belonging to
Glycoside Hydrolase Family 2. Finally, the enzymatic properties of Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase shows its
potential for being applied to development of a new industrial biocatalyst for efficient lactose hydrolysis in milk.

Background
Cold-active enzymes found in cold-adapted organisms
thriving in Earth’s polar regions and other areas, where
the mean annual temperature is below 5°C, offer a
potential for the development of new industrial applications. Employing cold-active enzymes in the food industry reduces the risk of contamination by mesophilic
microorganisms, allowing inactivation of them at moderate temperatures and changes in the taste and nutritional values of the foodstuffs being produced to be
avoided [1].
Cold-active b-D-galactosidases primarily can be used
in dairy industry for the production of lactose free milk
for people afflicted with lactose intolerance. Besides
eliminating nutritional problem, the low temperature of
lactose hydrolysis in milk with an optimum temperature
at approximately 10°C offer some other important
advantages: (i) the lactose hydrolysis can run during
shipping and storage of milk that shortening the entire
production process (save energy), (ii) eliminating any
mesophilic microflora contamination, and (iii) allow the
formation of nonenzymatic browning products formed
at higher temperatures to be avoided. On the other
hand, there are also technological reasons for removing
of lactose from milk. The lactose hydrolysis in milk
decreases its hydroscopicity, as well as facilitating the
suppression of lactose crystallization in sweet condensed
milk and ice creams production processes. Furthermore,
the enzymatic hydrolysis can be used to remove lactose
from the whey generated in the cheese production process. The conversion of the lactose in whey to glucose
and galactose, which are more fermentable sugars than
lactose allow to reduces the water pollution related to
the dairy industry [2].
In addition, cold-active b-D-galactosidases can be also
used for the synthesis of oligosaccharides. Oligosaccharides are water soluble and mildly sweet in comparison
with the commonly used mono- and disaccharides.
Their relatively low sweetness is useful in food production where enhancement of other food flavors is desirable. Moreover, some oligosaccharides promote the
proliferation of bifidobacteria in the colon, thus suppressing the growth of undesirable bacteria [3].
An ideal cold-active b-D-galactosidase for treating
milk should work well at approximately 10°C; be highly
active at pH 6.7-6.8; not be inhibited by Na+ and Ca2+
ions or galactose and glucose, and be specific for lactose.
It is important to note that currently applied to lactose
hydrolysis, the mesophilic Kluyveromyces lactis b-Dgalactosidase (e.g. commercially available Lactozym Novo Nordisk) has a temperature optimum of approximately 50°C and displays poor activity below 20°C.
Therefore, in recent years, a great deal of effort has

Page 2 of 12

been invested in the isolation and characterization of
novel cold-active b-D-galactosidases from different
sources. These have mainly been bacterial enzymes isolated from Arthrobacter sp. B7 [4-6], Arthrobacter sp.
C2-2 [3], Arthrobacter sp. SB [7], Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus strain F2 [1,8], Arthrobacter sp. 32c [9],
Arthrobacter sp. 20B [2], Flavobacterium sp. 4214 [10]
Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b [11-13], Pseudoalteromonas
haloplanktis [14], Pseudoalteromonas sp. TAE 79b [15],
Rahnella aquatilis 14-1 [16], Planococcus sp. SOS
orange [17], Planococcus sp. L4 [18], and Carnobacterium piscicola strain BA [19]. In contrast the authors
have found only a few reports of cold-active b-D-galactosidases isolated from other sources: yeast Guehomyces
pullulans [20] and a soil metagenomic DNA library
[21]. Hitherto, most of the cold-active b-D-galactosidases previously reported showed optimum temperature
of activity at approximately 25-40°C, and only LacZ
Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus strain F2 revealed optimum temperature of activity at 10°C. Generally, the
most of above-mentioned cold-active b-D-galactosidases
reveal high efficiency of the lactose hydrolysis in milk at
low temperature, however, to the best of our knowledge,
none of them is used as industrial biocatalyst so far.
Our previous studies on cold-active b-D-galactosidases
isolated from Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b [11-13] and
Arthrobacter sp. 20B [2] revealed the factors that limit
their usefulness as biocatalysts for industrial lactose
hydrolysis in milk. These factors are, first, the insufficient efficiency of the production recombinant form of
the cold-active LacZ Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b b-Dgalactosidase in E. coli expression system [12]. Secondly,
the LacZ Arthrobacter sp. 20B [2] revealed the low stability of purified enzyme, that is the major disadvantage
of using this cold-active b-D-galactosidase as biocatalyst,
owing to the problems with providing the proper conditions for long storage of this enzyme.
The present study was conducted in order to carry out
the molecular and enzymatic characterization of the
cold-active recombinant b-D-galactosidase of Paracoccus
sp. 32d. What is especially important, the active form of
the recombinant enzyme was effectively produced by
means of the E. coli expression system and the purified
enzyme was stable and showed a high efficiency of lactose hydrolysis in milk. Moreover, to the best of the
author’s knowledge, this is the first report on characterization of b-D-galactosidase isolated from genus
Paracoccus.

Results
Characterization and identification of the strain 32d

Strain 32d was Gram-negative, aerobic, non motile and
rod-shaped. On LAS agar, this strain formed small,

Wierzbicka-Woś et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:108
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/108

round, smooth, dark orange colonies with a diameter of
1-2 mm. The optimal growth temperature was 20°C and
growth was very poor below 5°C and above 30°C. In
contrast to b-D-galactosidase activity, lipase/esterase,
amylase and protease activities were absent. Glucose,
galactose and lactose were utilized.
An alignment of the 16S rDNA gene sequence of the
isolate 32d (GenBank, accession number GU111730.1)
with the appropriate sequences available in the Ribosomal Database Project and the GenBank database,
demonstrated that the isolate 32d should be classified as
a Paracoccus sp. (Figure 1) and that its closest relative is
Paracoccus marcusii (99% identity, 97% query coverage).
Cloning the b-D-galactosidase gene from Paracoccus sp.
32d and analysis of its nucleotide sequence

The Paracoccus sp. 32d genomic DNA library was prepared in E. coli LMG194 and screened for the colonies
that exhibited b-D-galactosidase activity. Finally, two
positive transformants were selected as blue colonies on
plates containing X-Gal (a chromogenic substrate for bD-galactosidase). Both transformants were carrying the
same recombinant plasmid with a BglII/SalI-cleaved
genomic DNA fragment of nearly 5.5 kb. Subsequently,

one of these recombinant plasmids (pBAD/insb1) was
selected for further study. Sequence data from the
pBAD/insb1 insert revealed an open reading frame of
2,193 bp encoding protein, which shares an average
homology (63%) with a b-D-galactosidase from Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234 (NCBI Accession No.
ACP21732). The b-D-galactosidase encoded the ORF
under analysis contained 731 amino acids residues, giving a calculated molecular weight of 81,750.4 Da and a
theoretical pI of 5.28 (ProtParam; ExPASy Proteomics
Server).
The primary structure of Paracoccus sp. 32d b-Dgalactosidase

A computer analysis of the amino acid sequence
deduced for Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase, conducted using the InterProScan program http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/ showed that it consisted of a
carbohydrate-binding domain (1-151 aa residues), a
immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich/b-D-galactosidase/glucuronidase domain (153-243 aa residues), and a single
catalytic domain (245-528 aa residues). Moreover, this
comparison revealed the lack of Bgal_small_N domain
at the C-terminus of Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase, a domain characteristic of LacZ enzymes (Figure
2). On the basis of sequence comparisons carried out by
means of homology and hydrophobic cluster analysis
[22], the enzyme from Paracoccus sp. 32d was classified
into the Glycoside Hydrolase Family 2 which comprises
the well-characterized LacZ b-D-galactosidases, such as
E. coli LacZ b-D-galactosidase. However, the comparison of Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase sequence
with cold-active LacZ b-D-galactosidases and E. coli
LacZ enzyme sequences revealed a slight sequence
homology in the vicinity of the catalytic glutamic acid
residue present in the putative Acid/Base sites of LacZ
enzymes (Figure 3A). Moreover, the comparison failed
to find any homology with the consensus nucleophilic
region of the LacZ enzymes (Figure 3B).
Expression and purification of Paracoccus sp. 32d b-Dgalactosidase

The arabinose-inducible promoter of the pBAD-MycHis A plasmid was used for the expression of the Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase gene in E. coli
LMG194 cells. The highest enzyme production yields
were achieved by adding L-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2% w/v, at A600 0.5-0.55 and by further cultivation for 8 h at 30°C. The enzyme was purified by
using the two-step procedure, presented in Table 1. Following this procedure, the enzyme was ~96% pure (densitometric analysis; software ImageJ v 1.44I) as
determined by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4) and had an estimated apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa

mM, pH 7.3), respectively. The Paracoccus sp. 32d b-Dgalactosidase revealed significantly higher activity in the
sodium phosphate buffer than in the Tris-HCl buffer.
The relative activity of b-D-galactosidase in the TrisHCl buffer was only 57% of the maximum enzymatic
activity of BgaL in sodium phosphate buffer, respectively. Thus, we decided to characterize the enzymatic
properties of BgaL with using the sodium phosphate
buffer.
On the other hand the results presented in Table 1
reveal that the second purification step had a low efficiency. Moreover, the densitometric analysis of SDSPAGE gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue (Figure
4) revealed that the BgaL enzyme was ~93% pure after
the first purification step. Therefore, the one step purification procedure of BgaL is the rationale way to reduce
the cost of BgaL purification on large scale, important
for the production of the enzyme for industrial
applications.

corresponding to the expected molecular mass calculated from the BgaL amino acid sequence. The relative
molecular mass of recombinant BgaL, which was determined by gel filtration was 161 kDa suggesting that the
Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase is a dimer protein.
Finally, the purified enzyme was divided into two aliquots. One of the aliquots was dialyzed against a TrisHCl buffer (20 mM, pH 7.3) and then used for protein
crystallization experiments (data not shown).
What it is important to note is that, the activity of the
purified b-D-galactosidase was depended on the buffer
used to purify or store the enzyme. We compared the
enzymatic activity of BgaL against o-nitrophenyl-b-Dgalactopyranoside as a substrate in a sodium phosphate
buffer (20 mM, pH 7.3) and the Tris-HCl buffer (20

A study of the substrate specificity of purified Paracoccus sp. 32d enzyme was performed by comparing its
enzymatic activity against the o-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and a variety of p-nitrophenyl
(PNP)-b-glycoside substrates, respectively (Table 2). The
Paracoccus sp. 32d enzyme revealed enzymatic activities
specific to the b-D-galactosidase. The highest activity
was found with lactose analogs ONPG. The activity with
p-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside and p-nitrophenylb-D-fucopyranoside as substrates were only 62% and
39% of that found with ONPG, respectively.
The thermodependency of the Paracoccus sp. 32d bD-galactosidase activity was determined by assaying the
enzyme activity at various temperatures from 0 to 70°C
using ONPG as a substrate. The maximum activity
enzyme shows at a temperature of 40°C (Figure 5). After

2 h incubation, the enzyme was thermostable at 30°C
and below. However, the incubation at 50°C caused a
rapid decrease of activity after 15 min incubation (Figure
6).
The Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase revealed
maximum activity at pH 7.5 and demonstrated above
80% of the maximum activity at a range of pH 6.0-8.0
(Figure 7). The enzyme was stable at pH 6.0 and 7.0
(~90% of maximum activity) after 2 h incubation, but it
rapidly lost activity at pH 4.0 after 15 min incubation
(Figure 8).
As shown in Table 3 the activity of the enzyme
against ONPG as a substrate was slightly enhanced by K
+
ions and 2-mercaptoetanol and was unaffected by
EDTA. It was slightly inhibited by Mg 2+ ions, dithiothreitol and urea, respectively and was also partially
inhibited by Ca2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ ions and strongly
inhibited by oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG). The
strong inhibition effect of GSSG and the positive effect
of 2-mercaptoetanol on the BgaL activity suggest the
importance of Cys residues in this protein sequence.
The Cys residues are uninvolved in the general mechanism of catalysis by b-D-galactosidases of the LacZ family
[23]. However, the S-thiolation or oxidation of sulfhydryl group of some cysteine residues can lead to the
conformational changes of BgaL that decrease its activity. The enzyme activity was also inhibited by glucose
and galactose, the products of lactose hydrolysis. As
shown in Table 4 the enzyme activity inhibition
increases with increasing sugars concentrations and the
glucose is a stronger inhibitor than galactose. On the
other hand, 1 U of the enzyme was able to hydrolyze
about 97% and 91% of the lactose in 1 ml of milk at 10°
C in 24 h and 11 h, respectively (Figure 9).
A lyophilized enzyme was stable for at least a year
when it was stored desiccated at -20°C. The reconstituted enzyme (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH
7.3) was effective in hydrolysis of ONPG (95 ± 2% of

the starting enzymatic activity) or lactose (93 ± 2% of
the starting enzymatic activity) at 20°C.
A freshly purified enzyme was used to determine the
K m , k cat and k cat /K m values at 10, 20 and 30°C with
ONPG and lactose as substrates, respectively. As shown
in Table 5, the apparent Km values for lactose increase
at temperatures higher and lower than 20°C. As a result,
the enzyme’s efficiency (k cat /K m ratio) for lactose is
markedly affected at these temperatures, whereas this
ratio is about two or four times higher at 20°C. On the
other hand, the apparent Km values for ONPG are comparable at 10, 20 and 30°C, and adequate kcat/Km ratios
increase constantly with an increasing temperature.

Discussion
A novel b-D-galactosidase gene from Paracoccus sp. 32d
was cloned from a genomic DNA library by means of
functional screening on b-D-galactosidase indicator
plates. A BglII/SalI genomic DNA fragment bearing the
b-D-galactosidase gene was sequenced, and an ORF

encoding the b-D-galactosidase was found. Computer
analysis of the BgaL amino acid sequence established
that the Paracoccus sp. 32d enzyme belongs to Glycoside Hydrolase Family 2 (GH2). However, in contrast to
other cold adapted b-D-galactosidases belonging to the
GH2 family, the Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase
possesses an acid-base active site slight similar to that
typical of the LacZ family of b-D-galactosidase. However, it does not share the conserved nucleophilic site
involved in catalysis that is typically found in this family
of enzymes. Similar results for the same analysis were
described by Gutshall et al. [5] for cold-active b-Dgalactosidase, designated isozyme 12, and isolated from
psychrotrophic Arthrobacter strain B7. However, what is
important to note is that the sequence analysis of isozyme 12 revealed that this enzyme belongs to Glycoside
Hydrolase Family 42.

Moreover, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the
Paracoccus sp. 32d enzyme is the first dimeric coldactive b-D-galactosidase determined as belonging to the
GH2 family. Hitherto, the cold-active b-D-galactosidases
characterized and belonging to that family are tetrameric enzymes [2,3,7,11,14,15]. What is interesting to
note is that, in size the Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase subunit (~80 kDa) is clearly smaller than the subunit sizes typical of the LacZ family of cold-active b-Dgalactosidase, such as, for example, LacZ Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b (~115 kDa) [11] or LacZ Arthrobacter sp.
20B (~116 kDa) [2]. The difference in size is caused by
the lack of a BGal_small_N domain at the C-terminus
of Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase (Figure 2). The
BGal_small_N domain (pfam02929) is commonly found
in b-D-galactosidases (Conserved Domains Database,
NCBI). The catalytic and other domains typically found
in LacZ enzymes are present in BgaL enzyme (Figure 2).
The lack of the BGal_small_N domain make the Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase one of the smallest
cold-active b-D-galactosidases (161 kDa, homodimer) to
have been described to date. In comparison, the relative
low molecular mass of native cold-active b-D-galactosidases have been reported for isozyme 14 of Arthrobacter
sp. B7 (110 kDa, homodimer) [6], Planococcus sp. SOS
Orange (150 kDa, homodimer) [17] and Arthrobacter sp.
32c (195 kDa, homotrimer) [9]. On the other hand,

Hildebrand et al. [9] suggest that the low molecular
mass of native b-D-galactosidase is crucial to the effective extracellular production of heterologous protein in
yeast Pichia pastoris. Comparison of the authors’ previous results for the production of LacZ (~490 kDa,
homotetramer) Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b in E. coli
[12], with the analogous production efficiency of BgaL
revealed that the low molecular mass of Paracoccus sp.
32d b-D-galactosidase also seems to be crucial for the
effective production of this protein in E. coli cells.
ONPG is the preferred chromogenic substrate for
BgaL (Table 2). Of interest is the fact that the many of
the well-characterized cold-active b-D-galactosidases,
isolated from Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b [11], Arthrobacter sp. 20B [2], Arthrobacter sp. 32c [9], Carnobacterium piscicola BA (BgaB)* [19] and Arthrobacter sp.
B7 isozyme 12* [5] and isozyme 14* [6] preferred pnitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (PNPG) as a substrate (the asterisk means that the selected studies presented data only for p-Nitrophenyl (NP)-linked
substrates).
Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase has an optimum
temperature of approximately 40°C, and a low thermostability at over 30°C, and is active at a pH range of 6.08.0 with an optimum activity at 7.5. The comparable
enzymatic properties were encountered in the other
well-characterized cold-active b-D-galactosidases such as
LacZ Arthrobacter sp. C2-2 [3], Arthrobacter sp. B7 isozyme 15 [4], and LacZ Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b [11].
However, the enzymatic activity of the Paracoccus sp.
32d b-D-galactosidase at a temperature of 10°C is no
more than around 15% of its maximum activity at optimum temperature (Figure 5). This is the one of the lowest relative activities for b-D-galactosidase at 10°C, as
compared with the analogous enzymatic activities
reported at this temperature for cold-active b-D-galactosidases such as LacZ Arthrobacter sp. C2-2 (~20%) [3],
LacZ Pseudoalteromonas sp. TAE 79b (~40%) [15],
BgaB Carnobacterium piscicola BA (~25%) [19], LacZ
Arthrobacter sp. 20B (~70%) [2], LacZ Arthrobacter sp.
SB (~70%) [7], LacZ Arthrobacter sp. C2-2 (~25%) [3],
LacZ Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus strain F2 (~100%)
[8] and LacZ Pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b (~24%) [11].
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the lowest

enzymatic activity (~10% of its maximum activity at
optimum temperature) for cold-active b-D-galactosidase
at 10°C has been reported for the enzyme isolated from
Flavobacterium sp. 4214 [10].
The study of the kinetic properties of BgaL against an
ONPG and a lactose as substrates, revealed the different
trends of changes in the relevant kcat/Km and Km values
against these substrates at 10, 20 and 30°C, respectively
(Table 5). The markedly higher affinity of the lactose to
BgaL at 20°C (Km value) than at 10°C or 30°C indicate
the molecular adaptation of the enzyme to effective catalysis (kcat/Km value) of this native substrate at the optimal temperature of growth for Paracoccus sp. 32d. In
contrast, an enzymatic efficiency of BgaL against ONPG
(synthetic analogous of lactose) was increasing constantly with an increasing temperature.
Generally, the enzymatic properties for BgaL seem to
be somewhat removed from those of cold-active b-Dgalactosidase which are ideal for the removal of lactose
from milk where activity at refrigerated temperatures is
critical. One of the most notable features of the BgaL
enzyme is the inhibition of its hydrolytic activity by
galactose and glucose, and Ca2+ ions. What surprised
the authors, however, was the high efficiency finding as
regards the removal of lactose from milk by BgaL from
Paracoccus sp. 32d (Figure 9), that was comparable with
the analogous ones of cold-active b-D-galactosidases
previously characterized by us and our former co-workers from IBT at the Technical University of Lodz
[2,9,11,12,24]. It seems to be possible that the complex
physicochemical properties of milk could have a positive
effect on the enzymatic activity of Paracoccus sp. 32d bD-galactosidase. For example, this study found the significant differences between the enzymatic activity of
BgaL in the Tris-HCl buffer and the sodium phosphate
buffer, respectively. The enzymatic activity of BgaL
against ONPG as a substrate at the same pH and temperature was 47% higher in the sodium phosphate buffer
than in the Tris-HCl buffer, respectively.

Conclusions
This study presents the purification and characterization
of a new b-D-galactosidase from Paracoccus sp. 32d.
From the sequence analyses it is obvious that the BgaL

Wierzbicka-Woś et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:108
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/108

enzyme is a member of the Glycoside Hydrolase Family
2. However, the sequence analysis of the BgaL enzyme
reveal the lack of the BGal_small_N domain previously
found in other cold-active b-D-galactosidases belong to
GH2 family. Both the relatively low molecular weight of
the Paracoccus sp. 32d BgaL enzyme, the efficient production of its recombinant soluble and active form in E.
coli cells, and the efficient hydrolysis of lactose in milk
suggested that Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase
exhibits potential for the development of a new industrial cold-active biocatalyst.

Methods
Bacterial strains and cultivation conditions

The Paracoccus strain 32d from the Department of
Microbiology GUT (Gdansk, Poland) collection of Antarctic microorganisms was isolated from the soil
sampled in the neighborhood of the Henryk Arctowski
Polish Antarctic Station at King George Island (Southern Shetlands, 62°10’S, 58°28’W). Strain 32d was cultivated in a modified Luria-Bertani medium: LBS (10 g
peptone K, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g sea salt per 1 L,
pH 7.5) at 20°C.
E. coli LMG 194 (F_ΔlacX74 galE galK thi rpsL
ΔphoA (PvuII) Δara714 leu::Tn10) cells were used for
cloning and expression of the recombinant Paracoccus
sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase. What was important to note
is that due to the deletion of lac operon (ΔlacX74) the
E. coli LMG 194 is lacZ deficient strain. E. coli strain
was grown on LB medium (10 g peptone K, 5 g yeast
extract, and 10 g NaCl per 1 L, pH 7.5) or on LB medium solidified with bacteriological agar at 37°C (for cloning and expression experiments) and 30°C (for
expression experiments).
Characterization and identification of the strain 32d

Growth properties were determined in LAS broth (10 g
peptone K, 5 g yeast extract, 15 g bacteriological agar
and 10 g sea salt per 1 L, pH 7.5). The strain 32d was
tested by using minimal media containing 0.5% (w/v) of
the glucose, galactose and lactose as a sole carbon
source. The proteolytic, lipolytic and amylolytic activities
of the analyzed strain were examined at 20°C, on plates
holding nutrient agar, enriched with skimmed milk, tributyrin, and starch, respectively.
The genus of the strain 32d was assessed on the basis
of the 16S rDNA gene sequence, amplified by PCR technique with primers fD1 and rP2 [11]. The 16S rDNA
PCR product was sequenced using ABI 3730 xl/ABI
3700 sequencing technology (Genomed, Poland). The
16S rRNA gene sequence was compared with those
from the Ribosomal Database Project and the NCBI
database aligned using the MEGA 5.0 http://www.megasoftware.net/.

General DNA manipulations

Restriction enzymes were purchased from Fermentas
(Lithuania). The T4 DNA ligase was purchased from
Epicentre (USA). Restriction enzymes and other DNAmodifying enzymes were used in accordance with the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The reagents for PCR
were purchased from DNA-Gdańsk II (Poland). The kits
for genomic DNA isolation (Genomic Mini) and plasmid
DNA isolation (Plasmid Mini) were purchased from
A&A Biotechnology (Poland).
Genomic DNA library construction and b-D-galactosidase
gene identification

The chromosomal DNA from Paracoccus sp. 32d cells was
extracted using a Genomic Mini kit according to the protocol for gram-negative bacteria. The genomic DNA was
digested using the BglII and SalI endonucleases, and the
resultant DNA fragments were purified by isopropanol
precipitation protocol http://www.uccs.edu/~rmelamed/
Lab/General%20Procedures/EthanolPrecip.html. The purified DNA fragments were ligated with T4 DNA ligase into
the corresponding sites of pBAD/Myc-His A (Invitrogen,
USA). The ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli LMG
194 and clones were selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates
supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg ml-1), X-Gal (0.02
mg ml-1), and IPTG (0.1 mg ml-1). The ampicillin, IPTG
and X-Gal were purchased from Sigma (USA). The plates
were incubated at 30°C for 18 h and then transferred to
20°C. After 4 h of incubation at 20°C, the two recombinant
colonies, producing b-D-galactosidase turned blue. Plasmid DNA from the positive transformants (blue colonies)
was prepared using the Plasmid Mini kit (A&A Biotechnology, Poland). Samples with plasmid DNA were digested
with selected restriction enzymes (Fermentas, Lithuania)
to create restriction maps of the constructs under examination. DNA inserts sequencing was performed using ABI
3730 xl/ABI 3700 sequencing technology (Genomed,
Poland). Sequence similarity analyses were carried out
using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool program and
on the server at National Centre of Biotechnology, USA
http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast. Nucleotide and deduced
amino acids sequence analyses were performed with
VNTI advanced 10 (Invitrogen, USA). The ORFs search
was performed with the ORF Finder program http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html. The ORF corresponding
to the b-D-galactosidase was named the bgaL gene. BgaL
protein sequence analysis and classification was conducted
by means of the InterProScan software http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/interpro/.
Expression and purification of recombinant BgaL of
Paracoccus sp. 32d

The expression vector pBAD/Myc-His A (Invitrogen,
USA) was used for the expression of the bgaL gene of

Wierzbicka-Woś et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:108
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/108

Paracoccus strain 32d in E. coli strain LMG 194. The
bgaL gene was amplified using Forgal32d primer 5’AAATCATGAGGGTGACCCAGAAACTGAACCATGGC-3’ (containing the BspHI recognition site),
and Revgal32d primer 5’-AAATGTCGACCTAGCCGACGGTGACCGTGGCC-3’ (containing the SalI
recognition site). The parts of the primer sequences
given in boldface are complementary to the nucleotide
sequences of the Paracoccus sp. 32d bgaL gene, while
the recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases
are underlined and were designed to facilitate cloning.
The PCR fragment obtained was cloned into the NcoI
and SalI sites of pBAD/Myc-His A under the PBAD promoter, yielding pBAD/LacZ32d. The resultant recombinant plasmid was transformed into a competent cells of
E. coli strain LMG 194. The transformants were grown
in an LB medium (1 L) containing ampicillin (0.1 mg
ml-1), and shaken, at 37°C and 200 rpm, to an optical
density of 0.5-0.55 measured at 600 nm. The culture
was then supplemented with L-arabinose (0.2% w/v) to
induce the expression of the bgaL gene and grown for 8
h at 30°C. Next, the recombinant E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4600 × g for 15 min. The cell
pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of the A buffer (0.02 M
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, 0.1 M NaCl), and
then the cells were then disrupted by sonication, and
chilled on ice. The cell debris was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and then the
cell-free extract was applied onto Fractogel EMD DEAE
column (Merck, Germany) previously equilibrated with
the A buffer. An elution was carried out with a linear
NaCl gradient (0.05-0.6 M) in the A buffer, and with a
flow rate of 1 ml min-1. Afterwards, the purified b-Dgalactosidase-active fractions were combined and dialyzed to the A buffer and applied onto a Resource Q
column (Merck, Germany) previously equilibrated with
the A buffer. An elution was carried out with a linear
NaCl gradient (0.1-0.6 M) in the A buffer, and with a
flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Finally, the b-D-galactosidaseactive fractions, eluted within the a range of 0.3-0.35 M
NaCl, were combined and dialyzed to the C buffer (0.02
M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3).
Estimation of molecular weight

The purified enzyme was applied onto a Superdex 200
10/300 GL gel-filtration column (Amersham Bioscience)
pre-equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
150 mM NaCl (pH 7.0). Gel filtration was performed by
means of high-performance liquid chromatography, with
the same buffer as the eluent, and at a flow rate of 0.5
ml min-1, and the elution patterns were compared with
those of the standard proteins. The standard proteins
used were thyroglobulin (Mr = 669,000 Da), apoferritin
(M r = 440,000 Da), b-amylase (M r = 200,000 Da),

Page 10 of 12

alcohol dehydrogenase (Mr = 150,000 Da), bovine serum
albumin (Mr = 66,000 Da), and carbonic anhydrase (Mr
= 29,000 Da).
Protein determination

Protein concentration was determined in accordance
with Bradford [25] using BSA (bovine serum albumin)
as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out on slabs (10 ×
5.5 cm) of 12% polyacrylamide gel, in line with Laemmli’s method [26]. The samples were denatured for 10
min at 95°C in the presence of 10% SDS and 0.5% 2mercaptoethanol.
Enzyme characterization

The thermodependency of the enzyme activity was
determined by incubating 5 μl of the purified BgaL
enzyme (0.12 mg ml-1) in a 0.02 M sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.3, with 100 μl of ONPG (3 mM), for 2 min
at temperatures ranging from 0 to 70°C. Reactions
halted by the addition of 100 μl Na2CO3 (1 M) and then
hydrolysis of the o-nitrophenyl group was then detected
at 405 nm. The thermostability of the BgaL enzyme was
determined by incubating it at 20, 30, 40, and 50°C,
removing aliquots for up to 120 min. The enzyme activity was assayed at 20°C in the same manner as used for
the thermodependency of enzyme activity assays.
One unit (U) of the activity denoted 1 μmol of onitrophenol liberated from the substrate (ONPG) in 1
min and under the standard reaction conditions. (20
mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.3 and 20°C).
The optimum pH was determined by assaying activity
of the BgaL enzyme at a 10 mM Britton-Robinson buffer, with pH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0. Enzyme
activity was measured at 20°C and as described above.
The pH stability profiles for the enzyme activity of the
BgaL was determined by an initial incubation of the
enzyme for 2 h, at 20°C and in 10 mM Britton-Robinson
buffer solutions (pH 4.0-9.0), followed by determination
of the activity under conditions described above.
Requirements for metal ions (10 mM) and selected
reagents: 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM glutathione (oxidized form), 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
and 10 mM urea solutions, were determined under standard conditions.
The substrate specificity of BgaL enzyme was estimated using 12 chromogenic substrates: o-nitrophenylb-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), p-nitrophenyl-b-Dgalactopyranoside (PNPG), p-nitrophenyl-b-D-galacturonide, p-nitrophenyl-b-L-arabinopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-b-D-cellobioside,
p-nitrophenyl-b-Dmannopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucopyranoside,
p-nitrophenyl-a-D-galactopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-bD-fucopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-b-D-xylopyranoside,
and p-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucuronide each at a

Wierzbicka-Woś et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:108

concentration of 5 mM. Activity was measured at 20°C
and as described above.
The kinetic parameters of the freshly purified enzyme
were determined at 10, 20 and 30°C, and the reaction rate
with ONPG (1.0-5.0 mM) and lactose (1.0-5.0 mM) as
substrates was determined, respectively. The lactose concentration after enzymatic reaction was determined using
Liquick Cor-Glucose kit (Cormay) to measure the concentration of glucose released during lactose hydrolysis.
The efficiency of 1U of Paracoccus sp. 32d b-D-galactosidase, in the hydrolysis of the lactose in milk (10 ml)
at 10°C was monitored by means of HPLC analysis
using Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad), 5 mM
H 2 SO 4 as a mobile phase and Agilent 1200 Series
Refractive Index Detector. 1% solutions of glucose,
galactose and lactose were used as standards.
All experiments (above-mentioned) were done in
triplicate.
