Evidence for the existence of pathogenicity
determinants in the Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs)
of the Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) genome

The majority of BLV-infected animals are asymptomatic
carriers (AL) while about 30% develop a benign persistent lymphocytosis (PL). Fatal lymphosarcoma (LS)
occurs in 5% of infected animals. The genetic basis of
these diverse outcomes of BLV infection is still
unknown.
Viral LTRs constitute a genetic determinant of pathogenesis for other retroviruses. However, this possibility
has never been tested for BLV. Analyses to test correlation between clinical and genotypic traits across species
must be corrected by including the group phylogeny.
Otherwise, shared evolutionary history can jeopardize
statistical independence. Thus, the influence of BLV
LTR genetic variation on the clinical manifestation of
the disease was investigated by employing Cladistic and
Probabilistic, phylogenetic comparative methods.
With this purpose, the 5’ LTR region of 40 BLV proviruses from bovines with different clinical presentations
(AL, PL, LS) was sequenced. Seven polymorphic positions showing an apparent association with the clinical
presentation were identified. A provirus phylogeny was
obtained using env gene sequences from 28 of the 40
provirus studied in this work. Both Cladistic and Probabilistic comparative analyses based on the empirical
sequence alignment and the provirus phylogeny suggested that positions 41 and 56 might be correlated to
the clinical presentation. The probabilistic analysis
further indicated an association with the viral pathogenesis for positions 373, 450, 494 and 505, though the corresponding statistical supports were lower in
comparison to the supports obtained for positions 41

and 56. These observations indicate that the BLV LTRs
might contain pathogenicity determinants.
