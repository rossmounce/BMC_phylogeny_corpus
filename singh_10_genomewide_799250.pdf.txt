Genome-wide analysis of rice ClpB/HSP100, ClpC
and ClpD genes
Amanjot Singh, Upasana Singh, Dheeraj Mittal, Anil Grover*

Abstract
Background: ClpB-cyt/HSP100 protein acts as chaperone, mediating disaggregation of denatured proteins.
Previous studies have shown that ClpB-cyt/HSP100 gene belongs to the group class I Clp ATPase proteins and
ClpB-cyt/HSP100 transcript is regulated by heat stress and developmental cues.
Results: Nine ORFs were noted to constitute rice class I Clp ATPases in the following manner: 3 ClpB proteins
(ClpB-cyt, Os05g44340; ClpB-m, Os02g08490; ClpB-c, Os03g31300), 4 ClpC proteins (ClpC1, Os04g32560; ClpC2,
Os12g12580; ClpC3, Os11g16590; ClpC4, Os11g16770) and 2 ClpD proteins (ClpD1, Os02g32520; ClpD2,
Os04g33210). Using the respective signal sequences cloned upstream to GFP/CFP reporter proteins and transient
expression studies with onion epidermal cells, evidence is provided that rice ClpB-m and Clp-c proteins are indeed
localized to their respective cell locations mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively. Associated with their diverse
cell locations, domain structures of OsClpB-c, OsClpB-m and OsClpB-cyt proteins are noted to possess a high-level
conservation. OsClpB-cyt transcript is shown to be enriched at milk and dough stages of seed development. While
expression of OsClpB-m was significantly less as compared to its cytoplasmic and chloroplastic counterparts in
different tissues, this transcript showed highest heat-induced expression amongst the 3 ClpB proteins. OsClpC1 and
OsClpC2 are predicted to be chloroplast-localized as is the case with all known plant ClpC proteins. However, the
fact that OsClpC3 protein appears mitochondrial/chloroplastic with equal probability and OsClpC4 a plasma
membrane protein reflects functional diversity of this class. Different class I Clp ATPase transcripts were noted to be
cross-induced by a host of different abiotic stress conditions. Complementation assays of Δhsp104 mutant yeast
cells showed that OsClpB-cyt, OsClpB-m, OsClpC1 and OsClpD1 have significantly positive effects. Remarkably,
OsClpD1 gene imparted appreciably high level tolerance to the mutant yeast cells.
Conclusions: Rice class I Clp ATPase gene family is constituted of 9 members. Of these 9, only 3 belonging to
ClpB group are heat stress regulated. Distribution of ClpB proteins to different cell organelles indicates that their
functioning might be critical in different cell locations. From the complementation assays, OsClpD1 appears to be
more effective than OsClpB-cyt protein in rescuing the thermosensitive defect of the yeast ScΔhsp104 mutant cells.

Background
Heat stress threatens future prospects of increased grain
production in crops. Rice (Oryza sativa) is most important world food crop. The production of rice is getting
severely affected with increases in mean global temperature. According to estimates, yield of rice declines by
10% for every 1°C increase in growing period minimum
temperature in the dry season [1]. Processes like spikelet
fertility, grain quality and yield processes in rice are considered to be especially sensitive to heat stress [2]. For

breeding heat tolerant rice, it is important that molecular components that underlie the heat shock response in
this species are understood [3]. Microarray profiling
data have shown that heat stress response in maturing
tomato microspores involves heat shock proteins, ROS
scavengers, hormones and sugars [4]. Understandably,
the major molecular changes in rice plants as affected
by heat stress need to be worked out. This is especially
relevant since rice has emerged as a model plant species
of the group monocots due to its small genome size,
availability of large collection of full-length cDNAs (FLcDNAs) and for the fact that the whole genome of this
plant species is completely sequenced. This crop has

attracted a great deal of efforts for the elucidation of
gene functions; completion of genome sequencing in
rice has paved way for comprehensive functional characterization of genes, transcription factors, signaling components and promoters [5,6]. The completed rice
genome sequence has been used for the characterization
of a large number of gene families involved in diverse
processes and pathways. However, with almost 42000
genes [7], several of them unknown, there are ample
proteins still left to be characterized in this important
crop species. In recent years, comprehensive details on
heat shock regulated rice HSP20, HSP70, HSP90 and
HSF gene families have been reported [8-11]. HSP100 is
a major heat-regulated protein family in diverse organisms. Across the living systems, common features of
HSP100 chaperone action include transient interactions
with non-native protein species, in the prevention of
aggregation and promotion of correct folding and
assembly, or in unfolding for translocation or targeting
to proteases. Singla and Grover [12] showed that homologues of yeast HSP104 protein are expressed in heat
shocked rice seedlings. It was subsequently established
that apart from heat, rice HSP100 expression is developmentally-controlled as seeds and developing embryos of
rice show high constitutive levels of this protein [13,14].
HSP100 proteins belong to ClpB family [15-17]. Clp
ATPases maintain quality of cellular proteins by performing the function of molecular chaperones and
energy dependent proteases. Clp (Caseinolytic Protease)
system was first identified as a heat shock inducible,
multicomponent, ATP-dependent protease complex able
to hydrolyze casein [18,19]. Subsequent studies showed
that the Clp system can hydrolyze numerous other proteins and peptides in both aggregated and non-aggregated forms [20] Clp ATPases fall within the AAA +
superfamily of ATPases associated with a substantially
broader range of biological processes [21,22]. Class I
ATPases (ClpA, ClpB, ClpC, ClpD) have two ATP binding domains and class II Clp ATPases (ClpM, ClpN,
ClpX, ClpY) have one ATP binding domain [23]. Clp
proteins are localized in various cellular organelles in
plants [24]. Basically, Clp system members include three
non-homologous gene families: ClpABCXY, ClpP and
ClpQ. ClpACX members (but not ClpB) facilitate the
activity of ClpP and some, such as ClpA [25] and ClpX
[26], can function as independent chaperones in roles
analogous to those of DnaK and DnaJ proteins. In contrast, ClpP proteolytic subunit exhibits low levels of peptidolytic activity. Further, when ClpP is complexed with
ClpA, ClpC or ClpX, active holoenzymes which are able
to cleave denatured proteins are formed. ClpAP, ClpXP
and HslUV proteases are similar in design to the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome, with the ATPase subunits guarding the entrance to the proteolytic chamber [27,28]. Clp

Page 2 of 18

proteases in bacterial and eukaryotic systems have been
implicated in vital cellular processes such as sporulation,
DNA replication, protein turnover, stress tolerance and
acclimation and regulation of gene expression [29]. ClpB
is different from ClpA, ClpX and HslU as it does not
associate with peptidase subunits. The function of ClpB
is also distinct from that of other Clp ATPases: this protein is not involved in protein degradation [30], instead
it disaggregates and reactivates strongly aggregated proteins [31-33]. The aggregation reversing activity of ClpB
requires cooperation with the HSP70/HSP110 chaperone
machinery [34].
In Arabidopsis, ClpB proteins have been divided into 3
classes according to cytoplasmic, chloroplastic and mitochondrial isoforms. Cytoplasmic ClpB is constituted by
At1g74310, chloroplastic ClpB by At5g15450 and mitochondrial ClpB by At2g25140 [17]. Much of the work
on ClpB proteins has been carried out on AtClpB-cyt
isoform [35-38]. We isolated and sequenced rice ClpBcyt gene (GenBank accession no. AJ316025) and showed
that rice ClpB-cyt cDNA complements yeast hsp104
deletion and loss of thermotolerance trait in yeast [39].
Genetic analysis has shown that ClpB-cyt protein is
essential for heat tolerance in plants. Mutants of Zea
mays and A. thaliana plants under-expressing their
respective ClpB-cyt/HSP100 proteins are observed to
lack both basal as well as induced thermotolerance
[35-37]. Queitsch et al [38] produced transgenic A.
thaliana plants by modifying level of AtClpB-cyt/
HSP100 protein. Transgenic plants in the latter study
survived as high as 45°C (1 h) temperature stress as they
showed vigorous growth after the removal of stress.
Katiyar-Agarwal et al [40] over-expressed AtClpB-cyt/
HSP100 protein in rice plants. The transgenic rice lines
showed re-growth in the post-high temperature stress
recovery phase while the untransformed plants could
not recover to the similar extents. Keeler et al [41]
reported cloning of a chloroplastic HSP100/ClpB gene
from Phaseolus lunatus. The corresponding protein was
seen to be localized to chloroplast. The accumulation of
ClpB/HSP100 in this plant species was tightly correlated
with heat acclimation, suggesting that the chloroplastic
ClpB/HSP100 may be an important protein for acquiring thermotolerance. Chloroplastic ClpB from Lycopersicon esculentum has been shown to be important in
acquired thermotolerance [42]. Antisense suppression of
LeHSP100/ClpB in tomato plants made the plants more
heat sensitive. Lee et al [17] noted that Arabidopsis
knockout ClpB-p plants turn yellow on heat treatment.
ClpB-p mutant plants showed a distinct change in chloroplast morphology upon subjecting plants to high temperature stress: chloroplasts were irregular to roundish
in shape and were 21.5% of the size of normal chloroplasts. Lee et al [17] reported that At2g25140 (ClpB-m)

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/95

was localized to mitochondria based on experiments in
which transgenic Arabidopsis plants produced with signal peptide of At2g25140 fused with GFP showed
expression of the reporter gene in mitochondria. This
group further noted that the ClpB-m transcript was upregulated during heat shock and the level of induced
transcript for ClpB-m was lower as compared to
AtHSP100 and ClpB-p transcripts. ClpB-m knockout
Arabidopsis plants grew in comparable way to the wild
type plants both during induced and acquired
thermotolerance.
Plant ClpC proteins, which are the homolog of the E.
coli ClpA proteins, have been noted in chloroplast
stroma of several plant species [43-45]. ClpCs are considered to be highly conserved proteins among different
species [46]. ClpC of Bacillus subtilis has been found
not only to be involved in the removal of misfolded and
aggregated proteins but also controls through regulated
proteolysis, several key steps of development [47]. Two
nearly-identical ClpC isomers exist in Arabidopsis. ClpC
has been seen to be associated with ClpP in the stroma
[48,49] in an ATP dependent manner [50]. Sjogren et al
[51] reported that clpC1 mutant Arabidopsis plants display a retarded growth phenotype and leaves with a
homogeneous chlorotic appearance. This mutant also
exhibited fewer photosystem I and photosystem II complexes. ClpC in Synechococcus elongatus has been noted
to possess ATPase activity as well as function as a molecular chaperone without the need of additional chaperones or adaptor proteins [52]. It is suggested that ClpC
functions in part as a housekeeping chaperone in vivo,
protecting unfolded, newly synthesized (or recently
imported as in chloroplasts) polypeptides from aggregation. ClpD proteins differ from ClpCs by specific signature sequence and by its differential expression
characteristics [23,44]. ClpD in Arabidopsis has previously been referred to as ERD1 [44,53,54] and SAG15
[55]. Weaver et al [56] reported that the ERD1 protein
declines while its mRNA increases during senescence in
Arabidopsis.
It is hence clear that plant Clps are associated with
stress and developmental processes. The comprehensive
analysis of rice Clp ATPases with respect to their structural and functional aspects has not been addressed to
as yet. This study provides information on rice class I
Clp ATPases with respect to genomic organization, regulation, protein architecture and cellular functions.

Results
Genome complexity of rice class I Clp ATPase members

The protein sequence of rice ClpB/HSP100 (accession
number AJ316025) was noted to be same as the protein
encoded by the MSU locus Os05g44340. Os05g44340
was used as a query for identifying the other Clp

homologs at the MSU rice database. Nine ORFs
encoded by Os02g08490, Os02g19450, Os02g32520,
Os03g31300, Os04g32560, Os04g33210, Os11g16590,
Os11g16770 and Os12g12850 loci were noted to share
homology to Os05g44340 in this analysis (Table 1).
Search using HSP100 as a key word showed that
Os08g15230 is also one of the probable candidate genes
belonging to Clp ATPase family. However, alignment of
protein sequence of Os08g15230 with Os05g44340
showed that Os08g15230 does not contain most of the
domains which are typically present in Clp proteins
(except for the truncated ClpN domain). Therefore,
Os08g15230 is not included as Clp ATPase family member herein. Further, Os02g19450 locus encoding for a
mitochondrial 74kDa protein (HSP74) showed high
similarity to yeast HSP78 protein. Though Os02g19450
protein appeared to be the closest homologue of
Os05g44340 protein in terms of sequence similarity
(59%), Os02g19450 lacked the N-terminal domain which
other mitochondrial HSP78 proteins possess. Importantly, Os02g19450 locus appears not to be expressed in
rice based on microarray as well as Quantitative-PCR
(Q-PCR) analysis while the yeast HSP78 protein is
strongly expressed in response to high temperature
stress. We have therefore omitted Os02g19450 gene as
well from the class I Clp ATPase family in further discussion. Overall then, we assume that 9 ORFs (i.e.
Os02g08490, Os02g32520, Os03g31300, Os04g32560,
Os04g33210, Os05g44340, Os11g16590, Os11g16770
and Os12g12850; Table 1) constitute rice class I Clp
ATPases.
Phylogenetic relationship among plant class I Clp
ATPases

Phylogenetic analysis of rice class I Clp ATPases with
the corresponding Arabidopsis proteins (6 ORFs, details
shown in Additional file 1) enabled us to annotate and
classify the above 9 rice ORFs into ClpB, C and D
classes as follows: 3 ClpB proteins (designated as B1,
Os05g44340; B2, Os02g08490; B3, Os03g31300), 4 ClpC
proteins (C1, Os04g32560; C2, Os12g12580; C3,
Os11g16590; C4, Os1g16770) and 2 ClpD proteins (D1,
Os02g32520; D2, Os04g33210). The extent of identity of
these proteins with respect to Os05g44340 is as follows:
Os02g08490-54.8%, Os02g32520-28.3%, Os03g3130050.8%,
Os04g32560-40%,
Os04g33210-26.2%,
Os11g16590-40.9%,
Os11g16770-49.4%
and
Os12g12580-29.1%. Populus trichocarpa is the first tree
species whose genome has been sequenced. A BLASTP
search of Populus genome at http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Poptr1_1/ revealed that it has 8 homologs to rice
Os05g44340. Clp ATPases from Populus have been
named in this text as per the system described by
Waters et al [57] for LMW HSPs. Molecular details for
the 8 Populus Clp ATPases are shown in Additional file

1. Overall, we find that Populus genome contains 4 ClpB
(Pt101.7, Pt106.7, Pt108.5 and Pt98.7), 2 ClpC (Pt102.5
and Pt103.5) and 2 ClpD (Pt103.2 and Pt104.4) genes.
Arabidopsis-rice-Populus phylogenetic tree was constructed using amino acid sequences of 9 Clp ATPase
proteins from rice (sequences downloaded from MSU
rice database), 6 from Arabidopsis (sequences downloaded from MIPS database) and 8 from Populus
(sequences downloaded from http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html using ClustalX and visualized using Treeview (Figure 1). The tree divided all 23
proteins into 3 major clades corresponding to ClpB,
ClpC and ClpD proteins. ClpB clade was divided into 3
subclades according to cytoplasmic, chloroplastic and
mitochondrial isoforms. Cytoplasmic ClpB are
Os05g44340, At1g74310 and Pt101.72; chloroplastic
ClpB are Os03g31300, At5g15450, Pt106.69 and
Pt108.53 and mitochondrial ClpB are Os02g08490,
At2g25140 and Pt98.74. At the amino acid level,
Os02g08490 is 82.5% similar to At2g25140 which has
recently been reclassified from AtClpB4 to AtClpB-M
[17]. Os03g31300 showed high similarity (84%) with
At5g15450. Os05g44340 has a similarity of 83.4% with
At1g74310 at the amino acid level. ClpC clade contained
4 rice (Os04g32560, Os12g12850, Os11g16770 and
Os11g16590), 2 Arabidopsis (At3g48870 and At5g50920)
and 2 Populus (Pt102.5 and Pt103.51) members. At the
amino acid level, Os04g32560 (OsClpC1) shows homology of 82.3 and 87.5% with At3g48870 and At5g50920,
respectively. Os12g12850 (OsClpC2) shares 87.6% similarity with Os04g32560, the sequence being dissimilar
only in the region towards N-terminus which corresponds to the signal peptide. Os12g12850 shows 83%
and 86.5% identity at the amino acid levels with
At3g48870 and At5g50920, respectively. Pt102.5 and
Pt103.51 showed similarity in the range of 84-86% to
Os04g32560 and Os12g12850, suggesting that ClpC
ATPases are highly conserved across phyla. Os11g16770
and Os11g16590 also appear to be members of ClpC
clade. ClpD class included two proteins from rice
(Os02g32520 and Os04g33210), one from Arabidopsis

(At5g51070) and two from Populus (Pt103.2 and
Pt104.39). Os02g32520 has identity of 62.8% with
At5g51070 which was previously identified as ERD1
protein and later rechristened as AtClpD [17].
Os04g33210 shows 60% sequence identity to At5g51070
at the amino acid level. Pt103.2 and Pt104.39 showed
similarity ranging from 61-65% at the amino acid level
with their rice counterparts. Table 1 provides detailed
properties of rice class I Clp ATPase genes.
Genomic organization of rice class I Clp ATPase genes

Rice class I Clp ATPase genes appear to be distributed
in the genome (Table 1). There is no duplication event
seen in these genes, suggesting that these genes have
evolved independently from each other and there is no
transposition involved. However, the evolutionary patterns of organellar and cytoplasmic isoforms of various
class I Clp ATPases remain to be analyzed. Further,
there is not much similarity among these genes at the
level of distribution of exon and intron sequences: all
class I Clp ATPase genes contained introns and there
was no specific pattern in the arrangement of exons
and introns in their genomic loci (Additional file 2).
OsClpB-c has 15 exons and 14 introns which accounts
for the most in any Clp member in rice class I ATPase
gene family. OsClpB-cyt appears the smallest gene
among rice class I Clp ATPase genes with respect to
the genic region occupied. With respect to the proposed
ORF of OsClpC1 gene, a discrepancy was noted: KOME
database shows AK058510 to contain ORF of 1.107 kb
while MSU database predicts ORF of 2.757 kb. While
2.757 kb ORF seems to encode the complete protein
(918 amino acids; 101.8 kDa protein), there are no databank entries corresponding to 2.757 kb transcript of
this gene. KOME clone in fact contains the last 1.211
kb region of the 2.757 kb clone. In this study, full
length OsClpC1 was cloned from control unstressed
rice seedling tissues using RT-PCR. Since a band corresponding to ~ 2.7 kb on 1% agarose gel in this reaction
was noted (data not shown), it is thus indicated that
OsClpC1 ORF is ~ 2.7 kb under the conditions examined herein.

tree was created using ClustalX 1.83, based on the predicted amino acid sequences. The branch lengths are proportional to divergence, with
the scale of 0.1 representing 10% change.

Domain structure of class I OsClp ATPase proteins

SMART and PFAM database were analyzed for retrieving information on various domains present in rice class
I Clp ATPase proteins. In OsClpB-cyt, NBD1 and NBD2
span amino acids 209-398 and 607-710, respectively
(Figure 2A). OsClpB-cyt also contains a spacer region
which spans 494-553 amino acids; this spacer is characteristic of ClpB proteins. M-domain overlaps with spacer
signature II. The signal peptides were predicted using
Predotar and LOCTREE programs. Os02g08490 was
predicted to be mitochondrial (hence shown as OsClpBm), while Os03g31300 was predicted to be chloroplastic
(hence shown as OsClpB-c). Although OsClpB-cyt is
considered to be cytoplasmic, its amino acid sequence
analyzed at LOCTREE program predicts that this protein is nuclear-localized and contains a putative nuclear
localization signal (NLS) present from amino acid 476
to 483 (RKLKQREE). The architecture and the physical

position of various domains in ClpC and ClpD proteins
are shown in Figure 3. It is amply clear from this analysis that rice Clp C and D proteins belong to class I
ATPases, containing two NBDs (Figure 3B). All the class
I Clp ATPase proteins except OsClpC4 were seen to
contain two copies of ClpN domain (Additional file 3).
This domain present towards the N-termini is speculated to have a role in protein binding. ClpC2, C3, C4
and D2 proteins contained 35 amino acids long UVR
domain between the two NBDs. UVR domains have
been seen in proteins which have role in DNA recognition, repair and processing. The proteins containing
UVR domain are reportedly able to interact with each
other through this domain. OsClpC1 and OsClpC2 are
predicted to be chloroplast-localized. On the other
hand, ClpC3 is predicted to be mitochondrial/chloroplastic with equal probability and OsClpC4 is predicted
to be present in plasma membrane. All the ClpC

proteins identified to date in Arabidopsis and Populus
are localized in the chloroplast where they interact with
the chloroplastic protease ClpP.
Furthermore, 3-dimensional structures of OsClpBs
were predicted using I-TASSER [58]. Of the various
models suggested, structures which had a higher Cscore were taken (C-score considered to be a confidence
score for estimating the quality of predicted models by
I-TASSER). Importantly, OsClpB-c, OsClpB-m and
OsClpB-cyt showed almost similar structural arrangements as has been seen in case of A. thaliana ClpB
(Additional file 4). The coiled-coil linker formed the
central portion of the structures and the two NBDs

flanked it. The predicted binding sites also showed the
same pattern in the three ClpB isoforms (Additional file
5). From the structures proposed, it is suggested that
OsClpB-c, OsClpB-m and OsClpB-cyt proteins are
remarkably conserved with respect to their predicted
protein binding sites.
In E. coli, complex formation between ClpA and ClpX
with ClpP is mediated by a helix-loop-helix motif in
which the tip of the loop contains an essential IGF/L tripeptide [59]. In case of rice Clp ATPase proteins, it was
seen that except OsClpB-m, OsClpB-c and OsClpB-cyt
(ClpB members), all other Clp class I ATPase proteins
contain this tripeptide IGF/L motif (Figures 2,3). This

motif was in general present towards the C-terminus
except in case of OsClpC4 which had the tripeptide at
its N-terminus.
Expression of rice class I Clp ATPase genes

Microarray data at Genevestigator database (https://
www.genevestigator.ethz.ch/; [60]) were used for analyzing the transcript expression profiles of rice class I Clp
ATPases in different tissues/developmental stages (Figures 4 and 5). In different developmental stages, the
highest variation was found in expression of OsClpB-cyt:
this gene showed minimal expression during germination, seedling, heading and flowering stages but showed
high expression at milk and dough stages (Figure 4B).
On the other hand, there was a gradual increase in the

expression of OsClpB-c transcript from germination to
milk stage and the expression declined during dough
stage (Figure 4B). For expression of rice class I Clp
ATPase genes in response to stresses, microarray profiling was carried out for analyzing expression during cold
(5°C; 2 h and 4 h), heat (42°C; 10’ and 30’) and oxidative
stress (10 mM H 2 O 2 ; 1 h and 4 h) conditions. ClpB
genes showed a notably enhanced expression during
heat stress (Figure 4C). OsClpB-cyt showed enhanced
expression during oxidative stress also although the
magnitude of expression under oxidative stress was less
as compared to heat stress. OsClpB-c and OsClpB-m
showed almost identical response to the stresses (Figure
4C). Transcript expression for ClpB genes with Q-PCR

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/95

matched with microarray data. While all three ClpB
genes showed up-regulation under heat stress, the magnitude of the expression levels varied for the three genes
(Figure 4D). Low levels of OsClpB-m and OsClpB-c
transcripts were noted under unstressed conditions too.
OsClpB-cyt transcript was strictly induced in response
to heat stress (and to a lesser extent in response to oxidative stress; Figure 4D). The transcript abundance during heat shock was highest for OsClpB-m and lowest for
OsClpB-c among the three ClpB ATPase genes. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed distinct heat
shock inducibility in all three ClpB genes (Figure 4E).
OsClpB-cyt was mainly heat shock inducible. This transcript also showed a somewhat low expression in
response to cold stress. All three ClpB transcripts were
noted to be induced in response to exogenous ABA
application to a comparable extent in shoot and root tissues of rice seedlings (Figure 4F). Expression of OsClpBcyt was found to be much higher than other ClpB isoforms in dry seeds of rice, based on real-time PCR analysis (Figure 4G).
OsClpC4 appeared to be transcriptionally silent in
microarray at Genevestigator. OsClpC1 showed maximum expression among the various ClpC genes. Levels
of OsClpC1 transcript did not show much variation in
expression; these transcripts were minimally expressed
in endosperm. In general, there was almost similar
expression profiles of OsClpD1 and OsClpD2 genes
although there was variation in the magnitude of expression. OsClpD2 was seen to be expressed in anther and
ovary but not in seed tissues (Figure 5A, B). Heat and
oxidative stress inducibility was also relatively higher for
OsClpC2 and OsClpD1 genes (Figure 5C). In the other
Clp ATPases, only significant change marked was for
low temperature inducibility of OsClpD1 (Figure 5D).
Although microarray data showed that OsClpC2 was
heat stress regulated, we did not find the same in semiquantitative RT-PCR.
Localization of OsClpB-c and OsClpB-m proteins

In silico analyses shown in Table 1 predicted OsClpB-c
and OsClpB-m proteins to be present in chloroplasts
and mitochondria, respectively. To confirm their localizations, we designed two constructs namely AtClpB-mCFP-1881-OsClpB-m-GFP and AtClpB-c-CFP-1881OsClpB-c in this study. In AtClpB-m-CFP-1881OsClpB-m-GFP construct, 90 amino acid long signal
sequence (corresponding to 270 base pairs at the 5’ end
of ORF) from AtClpB-m were fused with CFP and used
as a positive control and signal sequence from OsClpBm in fusion with GFP expression as a test system;
expression was driven by using a bidirectional promoter
from a pair of rice protease inhibitor genes, for both the
reporter proteins. Similar strategy was employed in construction of AtClpB-c-CFP-1881-OsClpB-c plasmid. In

Page 8 of 18

this case, 84 amino acids long signal peptide (corresponding to 252 base pairs at the 5’ end of ORF) were
fused to CFP and used as a positive control. Both plasmids were shot separately for transient transformation
of onion epidermal cells. The fluorescence emitting
from GFP and CFP proteins in both the constructs colocalized (Figure 6). This suggests that OsClpB-m is
localized to the same sub-cellular compartment as does
the AtClpB-m. Likewise, OsClpB-c is localized to the
same sub-cellular compartment as does the AtClpB-c.
Complementation of S. cerevisiae Δhsp104 mutant by rice
class I Clp ATPase proteins

Deletion of hsp104 gene in yeast (ScΔhsp104) leads to
thermosensitivity as the mutant cells are not able to survive heat shock (Figure 7A; [39]). Possible effect of different rice class I Clp ATPases in complementation of
Δhsp104 mutant yeast cells was next analyzed. Different
class I Clp ATPases were cloned in pGV8 vector under
the control of GPD constitutive promoter to yield constructs pGV8-OsClpB-cyt, pGV8-OsClpB-c, pGV8OsClpB-m, pGV8-OsClpC1, pGV8-OsClpC2 and pGV8OsClpD1 (Figure 7B). Plasmid DNA containing different
class I Clp ATPases were linearized and transformed
into ScΔhsp104 cells and selected on a medium lacking
uracil to yield ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpB-cyt, ScΔhsp104pGV8-OsClpB-c,
ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpB-m,
ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpC1, ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpC2
and ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpD1 cell types. ScΔhsp104
cells transformed with AtHSP101 (ScΔhsp104AtHSP101) and ScHSP104 (ScΔhsp104-ScHSP104) were
used as positive control while ScΔhsp104 cells transformed with vector (ScΔhsp104-vector) were used as
negative control. Thermotolerance assay was carried out
by giving a pre-treatment of 60 min at 37°C and then
exposing cells to heat shock for 30 min at 50°C. Control
and heat stressed cells were dotted on YPAD plates to a
dilution of 10 -4 and kept at 28°C for 48 h and photographed (Figure 7B). We noted that positive control
ScΔhsp104-ScHSP104 grew better than ScΔhsp104 and
ScΔhsp104-vector yeast cells. Positive effect was also
seen in ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpB-cyt, ScΔhsp104-pGV8OsClpB-m, ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpC1 and ScΔhsp104pGV8-OsClpD1 cell types. Remarkably, ScΔhsp104pGV8-OsClpD1 cells grew even better than ScΔhsp104ScHSP104 cells.

c), 2 ClpC proteins (C1, At5g50920; C2, At3g48870) and
1 ClpD protein (At5g51070) [17]. From the comparative
details, it appears that 9 rice loci specify 3 ClpB (ClpBcyt, Os05g44340; ClpB-m, Os02g08490; ClpB-c,
Os03g31300), 4 ClpC (ClpC1, Os04g32560; ClpC2,
Os12g12580; ClpC3, Os11g16590; ClpC4, Os11g16770)
and 2 ClpD (ClpD1, Os02g32520; ClpD2, Os04g33210).
Phylogenetic analysis using rice, Populus and Arabidopsis sequences showed that class I Clp ATPase sequences
are significantly conserved. The tree showed three major
clades, one each corresponding to ClpB, ClpC and ClpD
proteins (Figure 1). ClpB proteins were further categorized into cytoplasmic, chloroplastic and mitochondrial
isoforms based on TargetP, Predotar, LOCTREE and
PSORT database. Cytoplasmic ClpB members included
OsClpB-cyt, At1g74310 and Pt101.72; chloroplastic ClpB
included OsClpB-c, At5g15450, Pt106.69 and Pt108.53
and mitochondrial ClpB included OsClpB-m, At2g25140
and Pt98.74. Although OsClpC3 and OsClpC4 are considered members of ClpC class, these proteins appear
somewhat different from OsClpC1 and OsClpC2

proteins. All ClpC proteins identified to date are localized to the chloroplast where they interact with the
chloroplastic protease ClpP. From the in silico analysis,
it appears that ClpC3 on the other hand may be chloroplast/mitochondria localized while ClpC4 is membrane
bound protein. Recently, AAA + ATPase chaperone
CoxD protein in Oligotropha carboxidovorans is found
to be present exclusively in cytoplasmic membrane [61].
A Clp ATPase in Glycine max has also been found to
be membrane associated [62]. High temperature causes
modifications in membrane functions, associated with
alteration of membrane fluidity. In plant cells, membrane-based processes such as photosynthesis and
respiration are especially important. Vigh et al [63] proposed that any alterations in the plasma membrane
microdomains are well suited for sensing stress and retailoring the expression of various classes of HSPs. The
chances of interaction of membrane-associated HSPs
with the proteins involved in signaling increases as these
molecules are also concentrated in the membrane rafts.
ClpC4 protein of rice may have such an implication.

Importantly, OsClpC2 contained 691 nucleotides long
intron in the 5’UTR and further harbored five upstream
ORFs (uORFs) in the 5’UTR. The role of these uORFs
in regulation, if any, needs to be worked out. Both
OsClpD1 and OsClpD2 genes towards their 5’ ends
showed a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain containing
protein (Os02g32530 and Os04g33220): MSU rice gene
model predicts that OsClpD1 and Os02g32530 gene pair
and OsClpD2 and Os04g33220 gene pair may give rise
to natural sense/antisense transcripts (NATs). Further
analysis of in vivo regulation of ClpD proteins may
reflect the significance of this observation. Domain analysis showed that OsClpB-cyt protein contains various
motifs which are typical of HSP100 proteins. Spacer signature II motif seen in OsClpB proteins was notably
absent from OsClpCs and OsClpDs (Figures 2, 3). Complex formation between ClpA and ClpX with ClpP is
reportedly mediated by a helix-loop-helix motif in which
the tip of the loop contains an essential IGF/L tripeptide
(P-element; [59]). Weibezahn et al [64] engineered a
ClpB variant termed BAP (ClpB-ClpP-loop; a variant
protein in which ClpP interacting site of ClpA has been
engineered into E. coli ClpB), which carried the P-element. Association of ClpP converted BAP from a refolding into a degrading disaggregase, demonstrating that
this engineering brings in threading of aggregated proteins into the proteolytic chamber of ClpP. When rice
class I Clp ATPase proteins were searched for the presence of IGF motif, it was seen that apart from OsClpBm, OsClpB-c and OsClpB-cyt, all other proteins contained IGF/L tripeptide motif (Figures 2, 3). This observation may have an implication for differential function
of ClpB as compared to other class I Clps. According to
Kim et al [59], IGF/L tripeptide consensus is generally
located between the sensor I and box VII motifs. However, OsClpC4 contained this motif towards the N-terminus. This may have some relation to the fact that
unlike all other Clps, OsClpC4 is the only rice Clp that
appears to be associated with the plasma membrane.
Cross-induction of HSP genes by diverse stresses is
known [11,13]. Zou et al [65] have recently shown that
the expression of nine different OsHSP genes was
affected differentially by heat, cold, salt, desiccation as
well as ABA. Hu et al [8] noted an extensive overlap of
transcript levels in rice HSFs and HSPs in response to
different stresses. Likewise, Mittal et al [9] noted crossinduction of HSF transcripts by diverse stresses in rice
seedlings. On the same line, ClpATPase genes showed
stress-related transcript expression. Agarwal et al [39]
reported that OsClpB-cyt/HSP100 transcript in rice
seedlings is induced strongly by heat and this transcript
remains unaffected in response to salt stress, water
stress, low temperature stress and ABA application. Hu
et al [8] noted that OsClpB-cyt was regulated by heat

Page 13 of 18

shock as well as drought. In this study, microarray analysis showed that OsClpB-cyt transcript was up-regulated
more than 5-folds both during heat stress as well as oxidative stress. OsClpB-cyt transcript was induced after
low temperature stress (Figure 4E). This study is the
first report for the cold induction of OsClpB-cyt, though
at low levels. Wu et al [66] reported that rice HSP100
promoter responds to desiccation stress. In the experimental conditions used in the current study (PEG treatment), we failed to note induction of OsClpB-cyt
transcript in response to desiccation stress. OsClpB-c
was up-regulated during heat stress by up to 5-folds and
during oxidative stress by up to 1.5 folds based on
microarray analysis (Figure 4C). Q-PCR data showed
that as with OsClpB-cyt, the relative abundance of
OsClpB-c transcripts was far more responsive during
heat stress as compared to oxidative stress. OsClpB-m
gene, like its counterpart gene in Arabidopsis, was found
to be heat and oxidative stress up-regulated (Figure 4).
Q-PCR data showed that transcript abundance of
OsClpB-m was highest during heat stress among the
three OsClpB genes. On the other hand, AtClpB-m
showed lowest transcript abundance among its different
ClpB isoforms [17]. In a study on transcriptional profiling of genes responsive to hormonal treatments in rice,
HSP100 transcript was found to be specifically induced
in response to ABA [67]. We observe that transcriptionally, OsClpB-m and OsClpB-c respond more to ABA
than OsClpB-cyt (Figure 4F).
OsClpC1 transcripts did not undergo any change
under stress conditions while OsClpC2 was seen to be
up-regulated (~ 3-4 folds) under heat, cold and oxidative stress conditions as seen in microarray experiment
although we did not find the same upregulation in
semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Figure 5C). No
amplicons were detected for OsClpC3 and OsClpC4 in
the semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. This may indicate that these loci may in fact be transcriptionally silent
under the conditions tested. However, in silico analysis
of publicly-available microarray database shows OsClpC3
expression in stem, culm and leaf tissues (Figure 5A).
Evidence for expression of OsClpC4 is yet awaited. Shen
et al [68] reported that OsClpD1 is induced by water
deficit and temperature stress in vegetative tissues. We
observed that this gene was up-regulated by different
stresses. In microarray data, OsClpD2 showed down-regulation during heat and oxidative stresses and a marginal up-regulation in cold stress (Figure 5C).
AtClpB-m and AtClpB-c have been shown to be localized to mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively [17].
We found that OsClpB-m is localized to the same location in the cell as AtClpB-m. Likewise, we noted that
OsClpB-c is localized to the same location as AtClpB-c.
We thus show that OsClpB-m and OsClpB-c are

Singh et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:95
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/95

localized to mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively
(Figure 6). It therefore, appears that these proteins may
have specific functions in cellular organelles.
Yeast expressing HSP104 are typically 100- to 1000fold more thermotolerant than yeast lacking HSP104,
thus demonstrating the critical requirement for this protein in cell survival during extreme heat stress [69]. Arabidopsis ClpB-Cyt/HSP101 has been shown to overcome
the temperature sensitivity of yeast Δhsp104 mutant
[38]. Similar observations were noted for the ClpB-Cyt/
HSP100 proteins from soybean [70] and rice [39]. This
fact prompted us to analyze ability of diverse class I Clp
genes in yeast mutant complementation assay. OsClpBcyt showed reasonably good complementation ability.
The capability of OsClpB-m appeared comparable to
OsClpB-cyt in conferring tolerance. Our observation
actually matches to an earlier experiment done with
yeast [71]. This group expressed yeast Hsp78 protein
which is mitochondrial isoform of the yeast cytoplasmic
Hsp104 protein, in the cytoplasm of the Hsp104 mutant
yeast cells. They noted that yeast Hsp78 protein complements the cytoplasmic Hsp104 yeast mutation. This
experiment indicates that the organellar and the cytoplasmic ClpBs may have some degree of redundancy in
their substrate recognition. Further, the target substrate
proteins of different Clps are not yet defined. In due
course when target proteins are established, it should be
possible to address the question of mitochondrial ClpB
complementing the cytoplasmic yeast hsp104 mutation
more deeply. A significant observation in this assay test
was the fact that OsClpD1 restores the mutation defect
of the ScΔhsp104 yeast cells to a significant extent;
ScΔhsp104-pGV8-OsClpD1 showed growth comparable
to that of the ScΔhsp104-ScHSP104 yeast cells. ClpD
expression in Arabidopsis has previously been seen to
be associated during senescence [56] but there is no
study that links expression of this gene to heat stress.
The detailed mechanism behind this role of OsClpD1
remains to be worked out. It should be relevant to analyze how OsClpD1 expression alters transcript profiling
in Δhsp104 mutant yeast cells. It should also be relevant
to generate transgenic plants with ectopically higher
ClpD1 protein and analyze their stress phenotype. Weibezahn et al [64] found that the development of thermotolerance in E. coli relies on the ClpB/KJE-mediated
reactivation of aggregated proteins, whereas the removal
of protein aggregates by degradation does not confer
thermotolerance. Similarly in yeast, Tessarz et al [72]
noted that the degradation of aggregated proteins results
in loss of thermotolerance. They reported that the
removal of aggregated proteins by HAP and ClpP is not
sufficient for yeast cells to survive a severe heat shock,
but survival demands on the reactivation of aggregated
proteins. It can thus be inferred that disaggregation and

Page 14 of 18

reactivation of proteins is essential for cell survival after
extreme heat stress, whereas the degradation of aggregated proteins is insufficient. It is possible that expression of OsClpD1 does this activity more efficiently than
other class I Clps and hence its expression results in
more thermotolerance than noted for other rice class I
Clp proteins. Finally, it needs to be mentioned that
although different Clp ATPases are noted to complement yeast hsp104 mutation in this study, it is possible
that variations in expression levels of rice Clps in yeast
which have not been determined, may also affect complementation efficiencies.
Finally, we wish to herein draw a comparable picture
of Arabidopsis and rice class I Clp ATPases. There are
some major differences in these two species for the
number of ClpB, ClpCs and ClpDs nuclear genes. While
Arabidopsis has 2 and 1 ClpC and ClpD members,
respectively, rice appears to contain 4 and 2 ClpC and
ClpD members, respectively. On the other hand, number of ClpB proteins appears same (3) in both rice and
Arabidopsis. Both in rice and Arabidopsis, one each of
ClpB type is present in cytoplasm, chloroplasts and
mitochondria. It should be relevant to extend the above
observations further to analyze what implications these
might have in regulating heat response in these two
contrasting plant species.

Methods
Growth conditions of rice and stress treatments

Rice [Oryza sativa L; cultivar Pusa Basmati (PB1), an
indica type] seeds were washed with mild detergent
and the detergent was removed by washing the seeds
thoroughly with running tap water. Seeds were subsequently rinsed with 70% ethanol at room temperature
for 45 s and washed with sterile distilled water 5-6
times to remove traces of ethanol. The seeds were
soaked overnight at RT in dark before placing on cotton bed in a tray for germination. Seedlings were
grown at 28 ± 2°C and 14 h light 10 h dark cycle
maintained in growth room (light intensity ~ 250
μmol m-2s-1, humidity ~ 40%). For temperature stress,
uniform-sized seedlings were transferred to beakers,
which contained distilled water at 42 ± 1°C for heat
stress (HS), at 5 ± 1°C for cold stress (CS), and 10
mM H2O2 at 28 ± 2°C for oxidative stress, and maintained at the requisite temperatures in BOD (for different time intervals as shown). For RT-PCR analysis,
rice seedlings were subjected to heat, cold, salt and
desiccation stresses. Salt stress was imposed by placing
seedlings in beakers containing cotton pads soaked
with NaCl solution, instead of distilled water. Roots
and shoots were harvested and frozen in liquid N 2
after desired durations of stress treatment. Desiccation
stress was implied to rice seedlings by keeping in 12%

PEG4000 as indicated. Subsequent to completion of
the stress intervals, tissues were harvested, frozen in
liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C.
Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, Q-PCR and
Microarray analysis

Total RNA was isolated from the control and stressed
tissues from PB1 as per the standard protocol [73]. For
semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, complementary DNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total
RNA primed with oligo (dT) primers using M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, Lithuania). RTPCR amplification parameters were optimized to analyze
individual target genes and gene specific primers were
used. b-actin was amplified as an internal control. QPCR and microarray analysis were carried out as
described earlier [9]. All primer details are provided in
Additional file 6. Raw microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) under the accession number GSE19983.
Sequence analysis

ClpB homologs in rice were identified by performing
BLAST search at the National Centre for Biotechnology
Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ and
MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project Database and
Resource http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/ using the
sequence of the ClpB-cyt/HSP100 (Os05g44340; Accession number AJ316025) as the query. The number and
position of exons and introns in different genes were
determined by comparison of the cDNAs with their corresponding genomic DNA sequences as well as by Spidey program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/spidey/. In
specific cases because of the lack of complete cDNA
information, the ORFs were used for this analysis. The
position of each gene on rice chromosomes was found
by BLASTN search in genomic sequence of rice chromosome pseudomolecules available at MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project Database and Resource
(Release 5). Multiple sequence alignments were done
using the Clustal X (version 1.83) program [74] and the
phylogenetic analysis was carried out by neighbor joining method [75]. The unrooted phylogenetic tree was
displayed using the Treeview program [76]. The DNA
and protein sequence analyses were performed using
DNASTAR software.
Cloning of signal peptides to confirm localization of
OsClpB-m and OsClpB-c and transient transformation of
onion epidermal cells

The sequences corresponding to signal peptides of
OsClpB-c and OsClpB-m were amplified using
AK069123 and AK287906 clones, respectively, as templates for PCR which were cloned upstream of GFP in
pCAMBIA1302. Subsequently, signal peptide-GFP
fusions along with NosT were amplified and cloned in

Page 15 of 18

pBCSK in BamHI and EcoRI sites and the plasmids
were named as pBCSK-OsClpB-c-GFP and pBCSKOsClpB-m-GFP. The signal peptides corresponding to
Arabidopsis ClpB-c and ClpB-m were PCR amplified
using Arabidopsis cDNA. The amplicons were cloned in
the vector pAVA574 [77] to generate a fusion with
CFP. Subsequently the signal peptide-CFP fusions were
amplified along with the 35 S terminator and cloned in
pBCSK-OsClpB-c-GFP or pBCSK-OsClpB-m-GFP vectors. The 1881 bp bidirectional promoter from a pair of
rice protease inhibitor genes [78], was introduced in
BamHI site. The plasmids so generated were named as
AtClpB-m-CFP-1881-OsClpB-m-GFP and AtClpB-cCFP-1881-OsClpB-c and were subsequently used for
transient assays in onion epidermal cells as described
previously [79] and analyzed for GFP and CFP expression using a Leica TCS SP5 inverted confocal
microscope.
Yeast transformation and thermotolerance assays of
recombinant yeast cells

Yeast transformation was carried out as described previously [39,79]. For thermotolerance of yeast cells, a secondary culture of yeast cells (initial OD 600 0.05) was
started and incubated (25°C, 200 rpm) till OD 600
reaches 0.15 (~ 3 h). OD 600 of the secondary culture
was also measured and if there was slight variation, it
was normalized. Aliquots of 200 μl of the yeast cells
from all the strains was made in MCTs which were
placed immediately in a water bath set at 50°C for 30
min. For the constructs in ScΔhsp104cells, cells were
given a heat pre-treatment at 37°C for 1 h. After stress,
MCTs were immediately plunged into ice. For spotting,
10 fold serial dilutions (till 10-4) of the cells were prepared in sterile water and 5 μl of each was dotted on
YPD-agar plates (YPD containing 1.8% w/v agar). The
plates were dried in the laminar flow and incubated at
30°C for 2 d.
