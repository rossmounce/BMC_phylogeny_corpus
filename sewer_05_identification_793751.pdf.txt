Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 21 to 23-nucleotide RNA molecules that regulate
protein-coding gene expression in plants and animals via the RNA interference pathway. Hundreds of them
have been identified in the last five years and very recent works indicate that their total number is still
larger. Therefore miRNAs gene discovery remains an important aspect of understanding this new and still
widely unknown regulation mechanism. Bioinformatics approaches have proved to be very useful toward
this goal by guiding the experimental investigations.
Results: In this work we describe our computational method for miRNA prediction and the results of its
application to the discovery of novel mammalian miRNAs. We focus on genomic regions around already
known miRNAs, in order to exploit the property that miRNAs are occasionally found in clusters. Starting
with the known human, mouse and rat miRNAs we analyze 20 kb of flanking genomic regions for the
presence of putative precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Each genome is analyzed separately, allowing us
to study the species-specific identity and genome organization of miRNA loci. We only use cross-species
comparisons to make conservative estimates of the number of novel miRNAs. Our ab initio method
predicts between fifty and hundred novel pre-miRNAs for each of the considered species. Around 30% of
these already have experimental support in a large set of cloned mammalian small RNAs. The validation
rate among predicted cases that are conserved in at least one other species is higher, about 60%, and many
of them have not been detected by prediction methods that used cross-species comparisons. A large
fraction of the experimentally confirmed predictions correspond to an imprinted locus residing on
chromosome 14 in human, 12 in mouse and 6 in rat. Our computational tool can be accessed on the
world-wide-web.
Conclusion: Our results show that the assumption that many miRNAs occur in clusters is fruitful for the
discovery of novel miRNAs. Additionally we show that although the overall miRNA content in the
observed clusters is very similar across the three considered species, the internal organization of the
clusters changes in evolution.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) form a recently-discovered family
of single-stranded RNA molecules of length approximatively 22 nucleotides that are present in all higher eukaryotes [1,2]. As shown by the growing number of specific
examples, they regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by binding to specific mRNA targets
whose translation is thereby inhibited [3]. Although some
details of miRNA biogenesis are still missing, a consensus
scenario has now emerged: primary miRNA (pri-miRNAs)
are transcribed generally by polymerase II [4], these transcripts are processed in the nucleus by the Drosha endonuclease [5] and exported as individual pre-miRNA stem
loops to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 [6]. In the cytoplasm, the mature forms are produced through the action
of the Dicer endonuclease [7]. It appears that a crucial feature throughout these processing steps is a stem loop secondary structure [8].
An upper bound on the number of miRNAs present in the
human genome was initially set by Lim et al. to a few hundred [9]. Recently however, this number has been re-evaluated by Berezikov et al. who argued that mammalian
genomes encode close to a thousand miRNAs [10]. Thus,
the debate about the number and identity of the miRNAs
in mammalian genomes is open, especially considering
that these estimates concern only miRNAs that are conserved between relatively distant species such as primates
and rodents and not miRNAs that are of a more recent
evolutionary origin.
The complete miRNA transcription units (pri-miRNA)
remain to be defined, although some studies have already
associated miRNAs with cDNAs sequences corresponding
presumably to pri-miRNAs that can be found in sequence
databases [11]. This and other studies (as well as our own
unpublished data) show that some miRNAs are transcribed as polycistronic transcripts which are several kb
long. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from a
recent study that revealed that miRNAs that are found
within 50 kb of each other on the same strand display correlated expression in microarray experiments [12]. Therefore the genomic regions around the loci of known
miRNAs appear particularly promising for discovering
additional miRNAs.
In the past few years several algorithms have been
designed for detecting (pre-)miRNAs, and they proved to
be extremely efficient in supporting experimental mature
miRNAs discovery [10,13-15]. Very generally, these methods identify specific secondary structures corresponding
to miRNA precursors in regions of the genome that are
conserved between species. Recent experiments have
uncovered, however, a number of miRNAs that do not
have close homologs in the sequenced genomes available

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/267

to date, such as for example the miRNAs encoded by the
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [16]. This finding emphasized
that it would be desirable to have a method able to predict
miRNAs in a single genome, without an absolute requirement for cross-species conservation. We developed such a
prediction method and we used it to discover miRNAs in
a number of members of the herpes virus family [17]. By
similarity with protein-coding gene prediction methods
that only scan genomic regions looking for signals characteristic to protein-coding genes and do not use external
transcripts or other genomes, we called our method ab initio.
Here we apply our method to search for novel miRNAs
that are in close proximity, and may be co-transcribed,
with already known miRNAs. As the set of known miRNAs we take the human, mouse and rat sequences from
the April 2005 release of the Rfam miRNA repository [18].
To evaluate the performance of the method, we use a
growing set of mammalian sequences that are cloned in
the Tuschl laboratory [19]. In the following we first
present the general ideas behind our pre-miRNA prediction method, then show the results of two validation tests
and finally move on to its application to the discovery of
potentially co-transcribed miRNAs in human, mouse and
rat.

Results
Overview of the pre-miRNA prediction method
The general idea of our approach to pre-miRNA prediction is to design a computational method that can be used
to better understand the constraints that define miRNA
precursors in relationship to their processing enzymes. We
start with the observation that one of the generic features
shared by all miRNA genes is the secondary structure
assumed by the transcript region surrounding the mature
miRNA. Indeed, mature miRNAs appear to reside inside
one arm (5' or 3') of a stem loop with good, though not
perfect, base pairing during the various steps of the biogenesis [1,2]. This stem loop structure is important for
miRNA precursor recognition by RNAase III enzymes Drosha [5] and Dicer [7] as well for the export of the miRNA
precursor from the nucleus [6]. The intermediates in this
processing pathway differ in the length of the sequence
surrounding the mature miRNA, implying that the stem
loop structure of the pre-miRNA persists independently of
the precise sequence context that varies from several kb for
the pri-miRNA transcripts to 50–70 nucleotides for the
relatively short pre-miRNA. We thus design our prediction
method to identify such "context-robust" (or shortly,
"robust") stem loops and then characterize their compositional and secondary structure properties in relationship
to those of known pre-miRNA as well as negative examples. Our approach consists in three steps:

describe the stem loops give us insight into the constraints
that appear to be most important for the recognition of
miRNA precursors by the processing enzymes.

Robust stem loops and pre-miRNA predictions
Robust stem loops and pre-miRNA predictions. The
upper panel shows a plot of the number of robust stem loops
versus the size of the genomic sequence they originate from.
The data come from the application of our method to viruses
[17] and, for the three at the extreme right-hand side, from
the present study (see Subsection "Identification of novel
clustered miRNAs"). The linear dependence is very clear and
corresponds to an average of 1.2 robust stem loop every kb.
The lower panel shows the relation between the number of
predicted pre-miRNAs (stem loops with positive SVM score)
and the expected number of pre-miRNAs, given by Equation
4. The linear dependence is also clear here, but the slope is
smaller than 1, which would have corresponded to a strict
equality between the two sets.

1. From the input sequence we first extract a set of
genomic regions that are predicted to exhibit the same
stem loop secondary structure, irrespectively of the size of
the larger transcript in which they are embedded. We call
these "robust" stem loops.
2. Each of the stem loops thus detected is assigned a score
that reflects its similarity to known cases of human premiRNAs. Since the precise structural features that contribute to miRNA precursor recognition by processing
enzymes are not known, we use a device from statistical
machine learning called "support vector machine" (SVM),
as follows. We describe any given stem loop in terms of
sequence and structure features. Then, using two training
sets consisting of known human miRNA precursor
sequences as positive examples and random subsequences from genomic regions, tRNA, rRNA and mRNA
genes as negative examples we build a model which
describes the relative contribution (weight) of each of the
features to the score assigned to any given stem loop. The
score measures the distance (in our feature space) from
the candidate stem loop to the hypersurface that best separates the positive from the negative examples. The
weights associated with the features that we used to

3. In order to guide experimental investigations, we
develop a probabilistic mathematical framework that enables us to estimate the pre-miRNA content of the input
genomic sequence from the scores assigned to all the stem
loops identified in this sequence. This framework that has
the advantage of not being dependent of the somehow
arbitrary score cut-off used to define the predicted miRNA
precursor stem loops.
Further details about each of these components are presented in the "Methods" section.
Validation of the method
Identification of viral miRNAs
We initially validated our method on a set of eight human
pathogenic viruses for which experimental investigations
were simultaneously undertaken [17]. We made 32 premiRNA predictions, out of which 13 were confirmed by
the cloning study, giving a confirmation rate of 41%. As
explained in the "Method" section, the first step of our
prediction method consists in extracting genomic regions
which are able to form robust stem loop structures. The
number of such regions grows linearly with the genome
size (Figure 1, upper panel). The number of predicted premiRNAs, however, is not merely a linearly function of the
genome size [17]. This property shows that the classifier
that we have developed captures specific features of premiRNAs that are not uniformly distributed across the
input genomic sequence. We have also developed a
method for estimating the expected number of pre-miRNAs in a given genomic sequence (see Equation 4 from
the "Methods" section). As shown in the lower panel of
Figure 1, the expected number of pre-miRNAs in a
genome is, as expected, strongly correlated with the
number of predicted pre-miRNAs (i.e. the number of stem
loops with a positive prediction score). At the same time
this statistics is more robust against small variations in the
value of the score threshold defining the predictions. An
additional advantage of using this estimation approach is
that it enables us to identify genomic regions that are
likely to give rise to miRNAs without having to pinpoint
their precise location. This is useful for directing experimental studies to promising genomes or genomic regions.
Recovering known miRNA in distantly-related species
It is perhaps not surprising that we can predict viral miRNAs, given that they are processed by the miRNA processing machinery of the human host, as are the miRNAs with
which we have trained our model. To test the ability of our
method to identify pre-miRNAs in distantly-related species, we applied it to the regions known to encode miRNA

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:267

loci in the invertebrate Caernorhabditis elegans. Of the 116
known miRNA precursors, we recover 50 (43%) as predictions. This results indicates that our prediction method
has a reasonable sensitivity for a wide range of genomes
from worms, to vertebrates to animal viruses.
Predictions: clustered miRNAs in human, mouse and rat
Identification of novel clustered miRNAs
miRNAs are often found in genomic clusters, some of
which are believed to be transcribed as a single transcript
(polycistronic pri-miRNA). A nice example is the cluster
of hsa-mir-17, whose elements reside within a 1 kb interval on human chromosome 13 and are indeed co-transcribed (cDNA Genbank accession number BC040320).
Motivated by the recent microarray study by Baskerville
and Bartel showing that correlated expression of miRNAs
can be shown up to the order of 50 kb of relative genomic
distance [12], we set to discover novel miRNAs in the
neighborhood of confirmed miRNAs from the Rfam database [18]. We adopt the following strategy. We first group
into clusters the known miRNAs from human/mouse/rat
Rfam6.0 that are closer than 10 kb from each other and
have the same transcription sense. We find that 105/111/
82 of the total 227/232/186 pre-miRNAs (i.e. 46%/48%/
44%) belong to a cluster of at least two elements. By adding these to the miRNAs that so far appear to be isolated,
we obtain a total of 162/161/138 clusters. We then extend
the genomic regions of all of these clusters by 10 kb on
each side and submit the resulting sequences to the prediction method. In total, we analyze 3.36/3.35/2.84 million nucleotides and we find that 224/192/208 of the
3829/3537/3034 candidate stems are classified as predicted pre-miRNA by our prediction method. After filtering out the known pre-miRNAs in these clusters, we
obtain a total of 89/66/105 predictions, given in the Additional files 1, 2, and 3.

In order to validate these predictions, we have searched a
large database of small RNAs from human, mouse and rat
that have been cloned in the Tuschl lab [19]. We consider
a prediction to be validated if one of the arms of the stem
loop matches perfectly a cloned small RNA that is not
known to be derived from a rRNA, tRNA, snRNA or
snoRNA. Additionally, although our predictions include
sequences coming from repeated regions, we discard cases
where the cloned small RNA has more than two perfect
mappings to the genome of the species it originates from.
We then find that 20/17/6 of the predictions have a match
from the same species, and these numbers raise to 22/20/
26 if matches from small RNAs from all three species are
allowed. This corresponds to confirmation rates between
25% and 30%, which are somewhat lower than the one
obtained with the earlier application of our method to
viruses (40%). The pre-miRNAs predicted in repetitive elements are partially responsible for these lower confirma-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/267

tion rates. The complete list of the confirmed predictions
together with the sequences of the cloned miRNAs are
given in the Additional files 4, 5, and 6.
The false negative rate of our prediction method, as determined from the cloning data, is 34%, a value which is
close to the false negative rate of 29% that we obtained for
our SVM training set, using a threshold score of 0. This
indicates that the prediction method behaves as expected.
For completeness, the false negative predictions are
shown in the Additional files 7, 8, and 9.
If we consider our results at the level of genomic clusters,
we find 5 novel clusters in human, 5 in mouse and 6 in
rat. By "novel clusters" we mean a set of precursor miRNAs
that contains, beside the confirmed predictions, known
cases that were not considered to be in clusters, i.e. which
did not have another known pre-miRNA with same transcription sense at distance smaller than 10 kb from its
genomic location. This corresponds to an increase of the
total number of clusters from 40/40/34 to 44/45/38 in
human/mouse/rat.
Phylogenetic conservation of the clustered miRNAs
Since cross-species conservation was not used in the process of generating our predictions, we can now go back and
ask the question of whether the predicted pre-miRNAs are
indeed conserved between human, mouse and rat. We
define the "conservation" relation between two given species at three progressive levels, corresponding to the three
columns labeled "Conservation" in the Additional files 1,
2, and 3. The first level requires that a homologous
sequence is found for a predicted miRNA precursor in
another genome (sequences alignment E-value given by
the WU-Blast program ≤ 10-5). The second level requires
that both the predicted precursor as well as the homologous sequence fold into simple (not branched) stem
loops. The third level requires that the two homologous
sequences are predicted to be miRNA precursors by a
method that uses cross-species conservation. For this purpose, we use the web interface to the MiRscan method
with the default parameters (threshold at score value 14)
[13].

As shown in the Additional files 1, 2, and 3, the predictions that are conserved across species are more likely to
be experimentally confirmed than the one that are not.
Indeed the confirmation rates are 1%, 22% and 49% for
predicted precursors with homologs in none, precisely
one and both species, respectively. We thus conclude that
the cross-species information strongly improves the specificity of the prediction method. If we now restrict ourselves to predictions that have experimental confirmation,
we find that for almost all of them (95%) a strong
sequence homology is equivalent to a conserved stem

loop structure. Additionally, we learn from the third conservation column that only 68% of the conserved and
confirmed miRNAs that we predict are also classified as
miRNA precursors by MiRscan.
In some cases we discovered miRNAs that are known in
some species, but were not reported in others. This is the
case of the rat homolog of mmu-mir-1, which corresponds to our predicted RP-79. The predicted precursor
has over 97% identity relative to the mouse precursor, and
the region corresponding to the mature miRNA is perfectly conserved. This miRNA has not been cloned in rat.
In other cases we discovered miRNAs that are conserved
across all three species but that are found in the neighborhood of a miRNA only known to exist in one of the species. This is the case of RP-97, which is close to rno-mir421. For this miRNA we found cloning and conservation
evidence in mouse and human as well. Note, however,
that we do not report here candidate pre-miRNAs that are
homologous to some of our predictions but that were not
part of our predicted set because in their species of origin
they are not found in the neighborhood of a known
miRNA.
Genomic locations of the miRNA clusters
Most of the confirmed predictions come from a relatively
small number of clusters. These are the following:

1. The orthologous loci located on chromosome 14 in
human, chromosome 12 in mouse and chromosome 6 in
rat, each of which is less than 200 kb in length. The
human locus has been shown to be imprinted [20]. Only
a few miRNAs from these loci have been deposited in
Rfam, although other studies have also published computational predictions matching them [10,20,21]. The finegrained structure of these loci has some species-specific
aspects, as illustrated by Figures 2 and 3. The figures show
all the validated miRNAs in these regions, including those
with suboptimal prediction scores from the Additional
files 7, 8, and 9. We find that some miRNAs that are
related in sequence, and have presumably arisen by duplication (such as the mir-368/mir-376-related sequences)
have different numbers of copies in rodents and human.
We also find rodent- (MP-33/RP-30, MP-34/RN-4, MP44/RP-49) and human-specific (HP-31) miRNAs, meaning that they do not have very close mature form
homologs in the other species. Yet in other cases the
human and mouse sequence have diverged slightly, as the
predicted miRNAs HP-30/MP-32 and HP-41/MP-41.
Because the mature forms of these miRNAs differ by a
deletion or a substitution, and because we only considered perfectly matching small RNAs from human as validation, only the human miRNA genes end up being
validated (see the Additional files 1 and 2). Finally, there
are cases of more complicated species-specific evolution-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/267

ary pattern. For example, mir-329 appears to have
diverged between human and mouse: at the syntenic location in human we find two identical copies of a miRNA
distantly-related to mmu-mir-329 (HP-33 and HP-34).
Furthermore, this cluster has a complex composition, containing other related sequences {hsa-mir-323, HP-33, HP34, HP-35, HN-6} whereas the corresponding mouse
cluster {mmu-mir-323, mmu-mir-329, MP-35, MN-7,
MP-37} additionally contains a rodent-specific sequence,
MN-7, which is not related to the other sequences in the
cluster. A similar situation can be found in the human
cluster {hsa-mir-368, HP-37, HN-7, hsa-mir-376a} which
corresponds to the mouse {mmu-mir-376a, mmu-mir376b, MP-38}.
2. Chromosome X also contains a substantial number of
novel miRNAs in all three species. They are spread over
the full chromosome and eventually form small clusters
with only a few elements. In the mir-17 cluster paralog on
chromosome X, whose evolution has been analyzed in
detail by Tanzer and Stadler [22], we found two additional miRNAs that are conserved in all three species. In
the order of genome location, the cluster then reads: mir106a, HN-14/MP-56/RP-100, mir-19b-2, mir-92-2, and
HP-85/MN-8/RP-99. Consistent with the evolutionary
scenario proposed by these authors we find that these
novel miRNAs are relatively close in sequence to other
miRNAs in the cluster. For instance the mature miRNA
sequence of MP-56 has only two mismatches with mmumir-17, mmu-mir-20 and mmu-mir-106a. We observe a
similar situation for another cluster on human chromosome X: hsa-mir-188, HN-11, HP-77, HN-12, and HN-13
(in transcription sense order). Whereas only HP-77 is a
confirmed prediction and possesses a close homolog in
mouse (MN-9), this cluster contains further three related
miRNAs that have negative scores but that have been confirmed experimentally.
3. Apart from the above mentioned miRNAs, we found a
few other cases of clustered, and potentially co-transcribed miRNAs: two in human (chromosomes 16 and
17), four in mouse (chromosomes 3, 10, 11 and Un-random) and three in rat (chromosomes 9, 10 and 18).
Comparison with other prediction methods
To evaluate the performance of our approach relatively to
other large-scale miRNA prediction methods, we perform
the following test. We take the (pre-)miRNA predictions
sets provided by the most extensive predictions studies in
the recent past [10,21,23]. Since these results have been
published at different times and some of the predictions
sets contain also known miRNAs, we set the Rfam6.0
release as the reference set of known miRNAs. The set of
miRNAs used to perform sensitivity/specificity tests contains those that have been introduced in the most recent

are conserved between human and mouse or human and
rat, our method has comparable performance to methods
that make predictions from conserved genomic regions.
Overall, we have somewhat higher sensitivity, at the
expense of somewhat lower specificity compared to the
methods of Berezikov et al. and Xie et al.. Interestingly,
each of four methods is able to predict some (pre-)miRNAs that are not predicted by any of the other ones.

Discussion
We have developed a computational method for ab initio
prediction of precursor miRNAs that we applied here to
the problem of identifying clustered, probably co-transcribed miRNAs. As explained in details in the "premiRNA prediction method" subsection and in the "Methods" section, our approach is based on a mechanistic
model for the action of enzymes like Drosha or Dicer, and
uses only the information contained in the input
sequence and secondary structure. In doing so we neglect

important aspects such as the fact that any stem loop that
we consider a candidate pre-miRNA has to be be transcribed and accessible to all the processing enzymes
responsible for ultimately producing a mature miRNA.
This aspect is, in part, responsible for a relatively high
number of false positives that we would obtain if we were
to run the prediction method on an entire mammalian
genome. But by applying the method to regions around
loci of already known miRNAs, we believe that we circumvent the issue of whether the genomic regions that we analyze are transcribed and are accessible to all the processing
enzymes. Our results (68 novel, experimentally confirmed cases for 260 predictions, or a 26% hit rate) show
that this assumption was justified. This is also indicated
by another recent study that identified 8 of our 68 predicted and confirmed miRNAs [23]. The given percentage
is a lower bound for the performance of our method on
these genomic regions, since it cannot be excluded that
some of the predicted pre-miRNAs are not detected or are
expressed in tissues or developmental stages other than
the ones that have been used in the experiments. Furthermore, we did not filter out from our predictions those that
fall inside repeat elements and may have higher likelihood of being false positives. Although this inclusion lead
to a lower hit rate, we have seen above that this allowed
us to discover a rich structure in the imprinted clusters.
Virtually all of precursors of the validated miRNAs have
some homolog (albeit somewhat different at the level of
the mature miRNA) in at least one other species, and a
number of factors may contribute to this effect.
1. We have focused our search on regions that are already
known to contain conserved miRNAs and, as can be
observed from out comparison of human and mouse loci,
miRNAs that are close to each other in the genome are frequently related in sequence.
2. We have used for validation data from all three species,
and we have considered a predicted pre-miRNA to be con-

firmed even in cases in which the supporting small RNA
cloning data came from another species.
3. Finally, the mouse and rat genomes are quite close to
each other and we therefore expect that almost all of the
mouse miRNAs have rat homologs, and vice versa.
Note however that 17 out of the 46 confirmed mouse and
rat miRNAs appear to be rodent-specific (i.e. 37%), and
one confirmed miRNA appears to be human specific (HP31). These miRNAs would be difficult to discover using
other methods either due to lack of cross-species conservation or because the genomes that are sharing the
miRNA are too close.
Although our "ab initio" approach to pre-miRNA discovery was initially designed and successfully applied to
detect species-specific miRNAs [17], we find that it retains
its value when applied to a situation where cross-species
conservation plays a important role. In fact, we were able
to discover conserved miRNAs that were missed by three
methods that use cross-species comparisons to make their
predictions [10,15,21]. Concretely, in the large imprinted
clusters from human chromosome 14, mouse chromosome 12 and rat chromosome 6, almost half (48%) of the
miRNAs that we predicted and were confirmed experimentally are novel (see the Additional files 1, 2, and 3).
It would be, of course, very instructive to understand what
factors contribute to the different results obtained by different prediction methods. Although this is not the topic
of our current study, we discuss some of these factors
below. Generally, all these approaches, including ours, are
based on a two-level strategy: first identify a relatively
small set of candidates and then examine these candidates
in detail to make predictions.
1. A fundamental difference between the first layer of our
method and any cross-species-based analysis is the fact
that we have tried to take into account mechanistic con-

siderations rather than evolutionary conservation or statistical properties. That is, by first identifying "robust"
stem loops (see "Methods") we not only pick up genomic
regions which are likely to form suitable RNA secondary
structure (which may be gotten using programs such as
RNALfold [24]), but we also take into account the fact that
the stem loop has to be present in the various stages of the
miRNA biogenesis. This implies a dependency of the stem
loop secondary structures that we identify on the flanking
genomic regions, which should not compete too strongly
for pairing with nucleotides within the miRNA precursor
and thereby destroying its secondary structure. This mechanism naturally gives a basis to the observation that the
functional RNAs, and in particular miRNA precursors,
have thermodynamically more stable structures than randomized sequences with the same (di-)nucleotide composition [25] (this property has been used to predict
precursor miRNAs [10], see next paragraph). The same
property, namely robustness of functional RNA secondary
structure elements with respect to varying sequence context, has been described in RNA viruses [26].
2. The second layer of the approach consists in scoring the
candidate regions. In our case, these regions are already
predicted to form stem loop secondary structures. Our
choice of implementing a support vector machine (SVM,
see "Methods") to distinguish between "good" and "bad"
precursor miRNA candidates has several advantages. First
it also includes information about what a miRNA precursor should not be, unlike the MiRscan scoring scheme
which is only based on positive examples. Additionally,
our procedure enables us to use the positive and negative
examples to compute the weights with which the various
features in our model should contribute to the score (see
Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5). This detailed description of the
sequence composition and structural features of the
miRNA precursors enables our classifier to perform better
than classifiers based simply on the thermodynamic sta-

bility of miRNA precursor stem loops [25]: on our training data, the SVM has at least 3-fold lower false positive
rate compared to a classifier based on the RANDfold algorithm for any given rate of false negative predictions (data
not shown). Additionally, the weights assigned by the
SVM for individual features give us a deeper understanding of miRNA processing than procedures that only use
statistics of secondary structure stability of pre-miRNAs
relative to randomized variants [10].
Adding our confirmed predictions (around 25 per species) to the already known miRNAs from Rfam6.0 (227/
232/188 for human/mouse/rat), we have reached the
upper bound on the number of miRNAs that was estimated by Lim et al. to be around 255 [13]. It is now
important to realize that this estimate was based on an
assumption of miRNA conservation over an evolutionary
distance up to the pufferfish fugu rubripes. The more recent
estimate of Berezikov et al., with less stringent assumptions about conservation lies in the range of about a thousand miRNAs [10]. From the present work we have
learned that these methods have missed some conserved
miRNAs. Moreover, some miRNAs are only represented in
closely-related species (such as mouse and rat) and there
are also families of closely related miRNAs that differ in
precise composition across species. All these considerations lead us to conclude that the miRNA discovery is still
not completed, and moreover, that hundreds of miRNAs
are yet awaiting experimental confirmation.
Although the hypothesis that miRNA loci tend to occur in
clusters which are probably co-transcribed has been useful
in the discovery of novel miRNAs, there are interesting
open questions about the expression of the co-transcribed
miRNAs. In particular, not all of the known examples of
co-transcribed miRNAs show strongly correlated expression patterns [27]. This indicates that yet unknown
processing factors lead to differential expression of the

sites.

Conclusion
We have developed a computational method to estimate
the pre-miRNA content and to predict the location of precursor miRNAs in genomic sequences. This method can
be used to guide experiments to find both miRNAs that
are evolutionarily conserved as well as species-specific
miRNAs such as those known now to exist in viruses. Here
we applied our method to the discovery of clustered,
probably co-transcribed, miRNAs in human, mouse and
rat. We have shown that our method successfully identifies evolutionarily conserved miRNAs that have been
missed by various other methods that are based on crossspecies comparisons. Most of the novel miRNAs that we
discovered reside in a conserved imprinted locus from
chromosome 14 in human, 12 in mouse and 6 in rat and
on chromosome X (in all species). In these regions we
found species-specific patterns of miRNA duplication and
diversification. The web interface to our prediction
method can be accessed on the world-wide-web [28].

Methods
Extraction of genomic regions with robust secondary
structures
We determine genomic regions with context-independent
stem loop secondary structures (shortly "robust" secondary structures) as follows. We move a window of length L
across the entire input RNA sequence in a stepwise manner, shifting by an amount ∆L at each step. For each window position we compute the minimal free-energy
secondary structure of the corresponding sequence using
the RNAfold program of the Vienna package [29]. We store
the nucleotide pairs of this structure into a table with all
the pairs that occurred in at least one structure, and at the
end, we determine the preservation rate ("robustness") r
for every nucleotide pair (i, j) in the table. This is defined
as:

r=

number of windows containing the nucleotide pair (i, j)
.
number of windows containing both nucleotides i and j

(1)

Choosing a minimal robustness value rmin, we reconstruct
the secondary structure elements (including stem loops)
that occur with rate r ≥ rmin using the following property
of the nearest-neighbor energy model used in the the secondary structure calculation [30]. Given two different
sequences containing both the subsequence corresponding to the interval [i - 1, j + 1], if the pair (i, j) is present in
the minimal free-energy structures of the two sequences,
then the secondary structure pairing pattern of the subsequence [i, j] is exactly the same for the two sequences.
Therefore, if a pair (i, j) appears with a robustness r in the
table, then all pairs in the table belonging to the common
minimal free energy structure of the subsequence [i + 1, j
- 1] in overlapping windows will appear with a robustness
of at least r. We use this property to reconstruct the secondary structure elements preserved with a minimal rate
of rmin. In our implementation we take rmin = 0.9, and keep
only the genomic regions where a single stem of at least 15
nucleotides is present in the robust secondary structure.
Finally, we fix the windowing parameters L and ∆L. L
should correspond to the length of known miRNA precursors, which can vary between hundreds and thousands of
nucleotides for the primary transcripts and between 50
and 70 nucleotides for pre-miRNAs. The constraint on ∆L
is set such as to allow us to collect sufficient data to make
a statistically meaningful estimation of structure robustness. To fulfill all these requirements while keeping the
calculation time within reasonable limits, we use two
combinations of (L,∆L) values, namely (500,25) and
(1000,50), and then take the intersection of the sets of
predicted regions with robust secondary structures.
Application of the above procedure to genomic regions of
20 kb around the Rfam6.0 miRNA loci [18] shows that
89%/88%/89% (203/205/166 out of 227/232/186) of
the known precursors of human/mouse/rat miRNAs overlap with a robust stem loop. This cross-check shows that
the secondary structure "robustness" criteria is very appro-

priate to make a first selection of candidate miRNA precursor stem loops.
Classification of stem loops using a support vector
machine
In order to construct a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for the candidate stem loops, we need a set positive
and a set of negative examples of miRNA precursors. As
positive examples, we use the complete set of human premiRNAs in the Rfam repository. As negative examples we
use random subsequences isolated from tRNA, rRNA and
mRNA genes. In cases where the input sequence was too
short to enable us to perform the robust stem identification as described above (e.g. in the case of the short tRNA
genes), we pad the input sequence with random sequence
using the mono-nucleotide frequencies of the input
sequence. To get a good sampling of the space of
sequences that the transcription and miRNA processing
machinery may encounter in the cell, we add to the set of
negative examples genomic regions isolated from random
positions in the human genome, as well as the genomic
regions from various viruses. Given that the fraction of
genome encoding miRNA genes is quite small, it is highly
unlikely that the sequences that we have chosen this way
contain miRNA precursors. We have a total of 178 positive
examples (i.e. the human precursor miRNAs from
Rfam4.0) and 5395 negative examples. Thus the fraction
of positives is the training set is of the order of a few perTable 5: SVM features to describe stem loops, part 4. These
quantities are calculated over all windows of length
corresponding to miRNA length lm that we could place on the
candidate stem loop.

cent, similar to what we think is the case in the human
genome. Analyzing the known examples [18], we and others find that miRNA precursors generally assume simple
hairpin structures (except some member of the let-7 family), longer than about 50 nucleotides. The fraction of
paired nucleotides in the stem is relatively high, and the
internal loops, if present, tend to be symmetrical. The
hairpin loop appears to be relatively short, of at most 20
nucleotides. The nucleotide composition in the stem is
generally balanced, as is the number of A-U, G-C and G-U
pairs. Based on such considerations we use the RNAfold
program to calculate the minimal free energy secondary
structure [29] and then we describe each stem loop (positive/negative example or candidate pre-miRNA) in terms
of
the
following
sets
of
features:
1. Statistics computed over the entire hairpin structure: 16
features given in Table 2;
2. Statistics computed over the longest symmetrical region
of the stem, i.e. the longest region without any asymmetrical loops: 10 features given in Table 3;
3. Statistics computed over the longest region in which the
difference between the 5' and 3' components of asymmetrical loops is not larger than ∆l (this region is called
"relaxed symmetry region"): 11 features given in Table 4.
4. Statistics computed over all windows of length corresponding to mature miRNA length lm that we could place
on the candidate stem loop, in order to zoom onto the
region of the mature miRNAs: 3 features given in Table 5.
Note that there are only two parameters in these computations: the maximally allowed asymmetry ∆l in a region
with "relaxed symmetry", and the assumed length of the
mature miRNA lm. We choose these parameters so as to
minimize the number of misclassified examples in our
training set. This minimum occurs at the values 4 and 20,
respectively.

SVM training set score distributions
SVM training set score distributions. Normalized distributions of the SVM scores for the positive and negative stem
loop examples used for the SVM training. The good separation between the two sets indicates that the SVM performs
well in recognizing the miRNA precursor specific features.

For the SVM, we use the "SVMlight" implementation of
Joachims and a quadratic kernel [31]. This implementation allows us to choose an additional cost for penalizing
misclassified positive relative to negative examples. We
chose this value such as to get a reasonable recovery rate
of known pre-miRNAs, while keeping a low false positive
rate. The distributions of scores of the training sets are
shown in Figure 4. In short, the model that we have constructed recovers 71% of the positive pre-miRNA examples with robust stems, with a false positive rate of 3%.
The features to which the SVM has assigned the largest
positive weights are the stem length, the length of the
longest symmetrical region, number of A-U and number
of G-C base pairs in the "relaxed symmetry" region. The
features with the largest negative weights are the free
energy of folding, the number of nucleotides in symmetrical and asymmetrical loops in the "relaxed symmetry"
region, and the average size of asymmetrical loops. These
conform to prior knowledge [13].
Estimation of the pre-miRNA content of a sequence
The number of pre-miRNA predictions obtained from the
SVM classifier depends on the value of the score threshold, which is somewhat arbitrary. We show here that our
approach can provide an estimate of the pre-miRNA content of a sequence which is independent of this threshold.

Figure 5
Estimation of the pre-miRNA content for HHV8 and HCV
Estimation of the pre-miRNA content for HHV8 and
HCV. Plot of the probability P(m) of a given virus to encode
exactly m pre-miRNAs (Equation 6) and probability Q(m) to
encode at least m pre-miRNAs (Equation 7). Equation 4
allows to calculate the corresponding number of expected
pre-miRNAs, 5.8 ± 1.8 for HHV8 and 0.5 ± 0.7 for HCV.
These values correspond to the mean and standard deviation
of the distribution P(m) shown on the figure.

According to the assumptions made previously, the features that we use to decide whether a candidate stem loop
is a miRNA precursor are contained in RNA sequence and
secondary structures only, and are combined into a score
using the SVM model. If this assumption holds, then the
probability p that a robust stem loop contains a miRNA is
a function of the score s only, and we can compute the
overall pre-miRNA content of a sequence based on the
distributions of scores for the set of positives (S+), the set
of negatives (S-), and the set of candidate stems in a given
genomic sequence (SC). We expect that p(s) has a step-like
monotonic behavior, being close to 0 for large negative
values of s and becoming asymptotically close to 1 for
large positive scores. In order to concretely specify the
function p(s), we first choose a suitable parametric functional expression such as

p( s) =

We perform a cross-check for the above approach by
applying it to the full training set of the SVM, merging the
positive and negative stems loop into one single set. The
expected number of pre-miRNAs from Equation 4 is 157.2

All confirmed, human. Details of the confirmed miRNAs for human.
The cloning frequency indicates the number of distinct small RNA cloned
sequences found in the comprehensive cloning set that match our predicted
pre-miRNA, "h", "m", and "r" corresponding to human, mouse, and rat,
respectively. The secondary structure uses the text display from Mfold
[32]. The last column gives the best homologs (within at most 5 mismatches) found in our confirmed predictions, in the false negative sets
(Additional files 7, 8, and 9) and in Rfam7.1 (latest release at the time
of publication). Notice MP-61 with good cloning evidence but an unusual
position in the secondary structure.

Additional File 5
All confirmed, mouse. Same as the Additional file 4, but for mouse.
Notice that the case MP-28 is identical to MP-61.
