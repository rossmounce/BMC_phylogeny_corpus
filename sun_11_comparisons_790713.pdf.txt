wasp species and the effects of Wolbachia on
host mtDNA evolution and diversity

Abstract
Background: Figs and fig-pollinating wasp species usually display a highly specific one-to-one association.
However, more and more studies have revealed that the “one-to-one” rule has been broken. Co-pollinators have
been reported, but we do not yet know how they evolve. They may evolve from insect speciation induced or
facilitated by Wolbachia which can manipulate host reproduction and induce reproductive isolation. In addition,
Wolbachia can affect host mitochondrial DNA evolution, because of the linkage between Wolbachia and associated
mitochondrial haplotypes, and thus confound host phylogeny based on mtDNA. Previous research has shown that
fig wasps have the highest incidence of Wolbachia infection in all insect taxa, and Wolbachia may have great
influence on fig wasp biology. Therefore, we look forward to understanding the influence of Wolbachia on
mitochondrial DNA evolution and speciation in fig wasps.
Results: We surveyed 76 pollinator wasp specimens from nine Ficus microcarpa trees each growing at a different
location in Hainan and Fujian Provinces, China. We found that all wasps were morphologically identified as
Eupristina verticillata, but diverged into three clades with 4.22-5.28% mtDNA divergence and 2.29-20.72% nuclear
gene divergence. We also found very strong concordance between E. verticillata clades and Wolbachia infection
status, and the predicted effects of Wolbachia on both mtDNA diversity and evolution by decreasing mitochondrial
haplotypes.
Conclusions: Our study reveals that the pollinating wasp E. verticillata on F. microcarpa has diverged into three
cryptic species, and Wolbachia may have a role in this divergence. The results also indicate that Wolbachia strains
infecting E. verticillata have likely resulted in selective sweeps on host mitochondrial DNA.

Background
The system of figs and fig wasps is considered to be a
classic example of coevolved mutualism. It is well
known that in general each fig species has a unique pollinator, which is called the “one-to-one” rule. However,
more and more examples of co-pollinators (two or more
pollinating wasp species on a fig) have broken the “oneto-one” rule [1-10]. However, we do not yet know how
they evolve. They might be distantly related species, suggesting host shifts, or sister species, suggesting

speciation on the current host [11,12]. Host shifts might
be more likely when a fig colonises a new habitat, or is
near the edge of its geographic range, because the normal pollinator is rare or absent. In this scenario, the copollinators are usually not closely related species [2,5,8].
Alternatively, sister co-pollinators may evolve from a
recent speciation event in the pollinator that is not
accompanied by fig radiation [3,11,12]. However, the
exact mode of speciation for co-pollinators has not been
well understood yet.
Wolbachia bacteria are the most common intracellular
bacteria in arthropods and nematodes, and can manipulate host reproduction in many ways [13]. Cytoplasmic
incompatibility (CI), the most common effect on host

reproduction, usually occurs between infected males and
uninfected females (or females infected by a different
incompatible Wolbachia strain), inducing progeny sterility or mortality [13]. This post-zygotic reproductive isolation can potentially cause or facilitate host speciation
[14-18]. Fig wasp species have a very high incidence of
Wolbachia infection [19-21], and previous work suggests
that Wolbachia might have an influence on fig wasp
speciation, because cryptic pollinator species have different Wolbachia infections [3]. So, Wolbachia may play a
potential important role in co-pollinator speciation.
In addition, Wolbachia can influence host mitochondrial DNA evolution. Because Wolbachia and mitochondria are co-transmitted maternally, the spread of
Wolbachia can result in the hitchhiking of mitochondrial
haplotypes. One particular mitochondrial haplotype can
sweep through a population, via hitchhiking, associated
with the sweep of Wolbachia [22,23]. This affects
mtDNA evolution by decreasing mitochondrial haplotype
diversity and also sometimes the mtDNA divergence
between species [15,22-27], and thus can confound phylogenies and barcodes based on host mtDNA [28,29].
Accordingly, we look forward to understanding the effect
of Wolbachia on mtDNA evolution of fig wasps.
Ficus microcarpa Linn. is a functionally monoecious
fig species. It is pollinated solely by Eupristina verticillata Waterston [30]. Here, we investigate the genetic
variance and Wolbachia infection status of Eupristina
verticillata in order to explore whether co-pollinators
exist, the association between Wolbachia infection and
co-pollinators speciation, and the effect of Wolbachia
on host mtDNA evolution.

Locations

After initial screening for Wolbachia infection, we
selected 76 pollinator specimens (35 infected, 41 uninfected) for further research. Only one specimen is
infected by two Wolbachia strains, while the other 34
specimens are infected by a single strain (Table 1).
In view of the NJ-tree based on wsp sequences and the
divergence among wsp haplotypes (Figure 1b), we recognise three Wolbachia strains (wEv1, wEv2 and wEv3).
The divergence between wEv1 and wEv2 is much smaller (2.96%) than that between wEv1 and wEv3 (22.44%),
and between wEv2 and wEv3 (23.20%).We then searched
for similar wsp sequences on the NCBI database. The

sequences (Additional file 1) also shows three distinct
clades (Clade I, Clade II and Clade III). The sequences
within each clade are nearly or absolutely identical. The
divergence among the clades, due mostly to length variance, is 2.29% between Clade I and II, 20.28% between
Clade II and III, and 20.72% between Clade I and III.
Remarkably, the NJ-trees based on COI and ITS2
sequences have very similar topologies, and the members which cluster together in COI clades also cluster
together in ITS2 clades (Additional file 1).
Distribution of pollinators

A summary of E. verticillata samples and their genetic
characteristics is shown in Table 1. All samples from
Haikou, Sanya, Wanning, Wuping fall into Clade 1 and
those from Danzhou and Wenchang belong to Clade 2
and Clade 3, respectively. For Xidao, Lingshui and
Baisha, individuals of Clade 1 and Clade 2 coexist.
Mitochondrial DNA polymorphism and evolution pattern

results show that wEv1 and wEv2 are 97-100% similar to
the wsp sequences found in E. verticillata in AustraliaAsia [20,21], whereas wEv3 is similar to a great number
of wsp sequences found in many other insects, including
other fig wasps, gall wasps, mosquitoes, bugs, fruit flies
and so on.

We mapped the status of Wolbachia infection onto the
E. verticillata clades based on COI sequences. This
reveals very strong concordance between E. verticillata
clades and Wolbachia infection status. Clade 1 and
Clade 2 mainly harbour wEv1 and wEv2, respectively,
while Clade 3 specimens are free from Wolbachia infection (Table 1). In order to examine the effect of Wolbachia on host mitochondrial DNA, we compared patterns
of mitochondrial DNA polymorphism and evolution
among the clades. The results are shown in Table 2.
The mean genetic divergence (D), haplotype diversity
(Hd) and nucleotide diversity (Pi) among the three
clades are significantly different. They are all much
lower in Clade 1 and 2 than in Clade 3. In addition, we
could reject neutral evolution for Clade 1 and 2 with
neutrality values (Tajima’s D, Fu and Li’s D and Fu and
Li’s F) significantly less than zero, but not for Clade 3.
In summary, we detect predicted effects of Wolbachia
infection on both mtDNA diversity and evolution.

Phylogeny and molecular variance

Discussion

We obtain COI and ITS2 sequences for all 76 pollinator
specimens. There are 24 unique COI haplotypes of
652bp in length, of which 68 nucleotide sites are polymorphic and 47 are parsimony informative. The NJ-tree
based on COI sequences (Figure 1a) shows that all the
specimens cluster into 3 distinct clades with high bootstrap values. We name them as Clade 1, Clade 2 and
Clade 3. The mean COI genetic divergence within each
clade is tiny (0.11%, 0.11%, 0.49% respectively), while the
mean divergence among the clades is large (4.22%5.28%) enough to suggest different species.
We also obtain 76 ITS2 sequences, whose length vary
from 522 bp to 545 bp. The NJ-tree based on ITS2

In this research, data from both mitochondrial (COI)
and nuclear (ITS2) markers indicate that E. verticillata
wasps fall into three distinct species (clades). COI divergence among these clades is large (4.22%-5.28%) enough
to suggest that these are different species. COI is the
gene used for animal DNA barcoding and has the
potential to facilitate both the identification of known
species and the discovery of new ones [32]. Hebert et al.
(2003) studied the ability of COI to distinguish 2238
species across 11 animal phyla, and the result revealed
that more than 98% of species pairs showed greater
than 2% sequence divergence [32]. In this study, the

verticillata COI gene. b) the tree based on Wolbachia wsp gene. c) phylogeny of Eupristina species based on COI gene.

COI divergence is greater than 2%, so it suggests the
existence of cryptic species within the morphologically
defined E. verticillata. However, because Wolbachia can
confound DNA barcoding based on mtDNA, we need
nuclear markers to support the conclusion from the
analysis of mtDNA. Nuclear marker ITS2 sequences,
which are not affected by Wolbachia, also support the
conclusion of cryptic species. ITS2 has been studied in
other hymenopterans, and this nuclear DNA fragment
shows high conservation within species and high divergence between congeneric species [33]. In our study,
ITS2 sequences within each clade are nearly identical
but diverge considerably among clades (2.29%, 20.28%
and 20.72%). Therefore, according to the tree topologies
and the divergence of COI and ITS2, we define the

specimens in Clade 1, 2 and 3 as E. verticillata-1, E. verticillata-2 and E. verticillata-3.
How can cryptic co-pollinators occur?

As background mentioned, co-pollinators may occur as
a result of host shift or speciation. In South China, F.
microcarpa is widespread, so host shift event seems
unlikely. In addition, survey of fig wasps in Hainan and
other provinces in South China does not reveal that E.
verticillata exists on other host figs (unpublished data).
All the above information suggests that occurrence of
co-pollinators on F. microcarpa is unlikely to be due to
host shift.
Alternatively, co-pollinators may evolve from a
recent speciation event in the pollinator that is not

accompanied by fig radiation [3,11,12]. In this circumstance, the co-pollinators are likely to be sister or close
related species [3,11,12]. Phylogenetic analysis indicates
that the three species we found are not only cryptic
species, but also closely related species (analysis combined with other Eupristina species, Figure 1c). Based
on the commonly used mitochondrial DNA clock rate
of 2.3% pairwise divergence/Myr [34], E. verticillata-1
diverged from E. verticillata-2 about 1.8 million years
ago, and E. verticillata-3 diverged from E. verticillata-1
and E. verticillata-2 about 2.3 million years ago.
Although E. verticillata-3 seems distant from the other
two species particularly based on ITS2 sequences, in
view of the phylogeny and identical morphology, we
still expect that the three species share the same
ancestor. Together with the evidence that in some
locations (Xidao, Lingshui and Baisha), E. verticillata-1
and E. verticillata-2 occur on the same tree, we conclude that E. verticillata has diverged into three species
on the same host. This pattern might be attributed to
the comparatively longer generation time of figs compared to that of wasps [4,11].
New species often arise via geographic isolation, but
the current geographic distributions of the three species
do not suggest geographic isolation (Additional file 2).
In some locations, E. verticillata-1 and E. verticillata-2
coexist. E. verticillata-3 is only found in Wenchang, but
this phenomenon might only reflect low sampling to
date. Additionally, speciation may also be driven by
Wolbachia-induced reproductive incompatibility. Previous studies have indicated that Wolbachia can induce
reproductive incompatibility, and then facilitate host
speciation [14-18]. In this study, we note that the three
species have different Wolbachia infection status. E. verticillata-1 and E. verticillata-2 are infected by closely
related Wolbachia strains, wEv1 and wEv2, while E. verticillata-3 is uninfected. A blast search for similar wsp
sequences on the NCBI database indicates that wEv1
and wEv2 are specifically related to E. verticillata. The
strong correlation between phylogenetic trees of wasp
species and Wolbachia strains suggests that Wolbachia
may be involved in the divergence and speciation of
hosts. In addition, we calculated the time when wEv1
and wEv2 diverged based on the wsp divergence rate
(0.2% pairwise divergence/Myr) [35]. The divergence
between wEv1 and wEv2 occurred about 15 MYA, earlier than the host wasp divergence. This makes it possible that wEv1 and wEv2 play a role in host speciation.
Although our results show that wEv1 and wEv2 may be
involved in host speciation, we can not demonstrate that
Wolbachia cause reproductive isolation among these
three host species. So, the exact mode of speciation for
three E. verticillata still needs to be explored.

Effect of Wolbachia on host mitochondrial DNA
polymorphism and evolution pattern

Many explanations have been proposed for lower mitochondrial DNA polymorphism and deviation from neutral evolution, including population expansion from a
bottleneck [36,37], selective sweep [26] and selection
against weakly deleterious mutations [38]. We analyse
the population size change by DnaSP, and get no evidence for population expansion (Additional file 3) [39].
Therefore, we should consider the other two possibilities. It is notable that E. verticillata-1 and E. verticillata2 are infected by Wolbachia and show lower mitochondrial DNA polymorphism than uninfected E. verticillata-3. The perfect concordance of mitochondrial DNA
polymorphism and Wolbachia infection status suggests
that Wolbachia-associated selective sweeps of the mitochondrion have occurred in E. verticillata-1 and E. verticillata-2. Decreased mitochondrial DNA polymorphism
as a consequence of Wolbachia infection has also been
reported in several other insects [15,22-27]. We also
find that the COI genes of E. verticillata-1 and E. verticillata-2 deviate significantly from neutral evolution
while this is not so for E. verticillata-3. Therefore, this
is also likely due to an mtDNA sweep associated with
the spread of Wolbachia, making the mtDNA undergo
purifying selection. In addition, a selection against the
weakly deleterious mutation may also induce lower
mitochondrial DNA polymorphism and deviation from
neutral evolution, and it needs to be explored further.

Conclusions
Our study reveals the molecular variance within E. verticillata, and indicates the presence of cryptic species.
Further analyses suggest that the occurrence of cryptic
species is attributable to successive speciation. A survey
on the Wolbachia infection in E. verticillata points to a
strong correlation between Wolbachia strains and the
pollinator species, which may indicate an important role
of Wolbachia in the formation of the cryptic species.
Our study also reveals that Wolbachia strains infecting
E. verticillata have likely resulted in selective sweeps on
host mitochondrial DNA.
Methods
Specimen collection and identification

Ripe syconia were collected from nine F. microcarpa
trees each growing at a different location in Hainan and
Fujian provinces, China, between 2006 and 2008 (Table
1). Wasps from more than 200 syconia per tree were
allowed to emerge and then stored in 95% ethanol at
-20℃. All pollinator specimens were then examined
under a Nikon SMZ80 microscope and identified following the keys of Bouček and Wiebes [30,31]. We then

Sun et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/86

selected randomly 30 female pollinator specimens per
tree for initial Wolbachia screening.
DNA extraction

Each specimen was washed in MILLI-Q water before
total genomic DNA was extracted non-destructively
from the whole specimen using Easypure genomic
DNA Extraction kits (TransGen, Beijing, China).
Extracted DNA solution was used for PCR amplification and then the specimens were restored in 95%
ethanol as vouchers in Institute of Zoology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
PCR amplification

The DNA qualities of extracts were first checked using
COI PCR amplification (details below). The positives
were then screened for Wolbachia infection by PCR,
employing the primers wsp81F (5’-TGGTCCAATA
AGTGATGAAGAAAC-3’) and wsp691R (5’-AAAAATTAAACGCTACTCCA-3’) [40], which amplify part of
the Wolbachia surface protein gene (wsp). We also
amplified the ftsZ and 16S rDNA regions using primers
ftsZ F (5’-TACTGACTGTTGGAGTTGTAACTAAC
GCGT-3’)-ftsZ R (5’-TGCCAGTTGCAAGAACAGAA
ACTCTAACTC-3’) [41] and 16SwolF (5’-TTG TAGC
CTGCTATGGTATAACT-3’)-16SwolR (5’-GAATAGGTATGATTTTCATGT-3’) [42] to verify Wolbachia
infection status. After initial screening, we chose five
infected individuals and five uninfected ones (or less
than five if unavailable) from each sample location to
amplify COI and ITS2 fragments.
We amplified the mitochondrial COI fragment using
the barcode primer set of LCO1490 (5’-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3’) and HCO2198 (5’TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3’) [43,44]
with the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C, followed
by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 50°C, 1 min at 72°
C, and a final elongation step of 10 min at 72°C. All
PCR amplifications were performed using an Eppendorf
Mastercycler gradient machine (Eppendorf) in 25 μl
reaction volume: Tris-HCl 20 mM (pH 8.4), KCl 20
mM, (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 10 mM, 5 pMol of each primer, 20
mM dNTPs, 1 μl of genomic DNA (~15 ng), and 2.5
unit of TransTaq polymerase (TransGen, Beijing,
China).
5 μl of each PCR product was electrophoresed
through 1% agarose gel to determine the size of fragment. Positive products were then purified with EasyPure PCR purification Kit (TransGen, Beijing). Because
direct sequencing of the COI amplicon is difficult in
Hymenoptera due to a poly-T region, the purified PCR
products were cloned and 2-3 positive clones were
sequenced with primer M13 on an ABI3730 capillary
autosequencer.

Page 6 of 8

The primers ITS2F (5’-ATTCCCGGACCACGCCT
GGCTGA-3’) and ITS2R (5’-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’) [45] were used to amplify ITS2. The amplification was performed with the following conditions: 5
min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s
at 55°C, 30 s at 72°C, and a final elongation step of 10
min at 72°C. The ITS2 products were purified and
directly sequenced.
We also sequenced the wsp fragments directly from
purified PCR products. If the direct sequencing failed
(multiple peaks or frameshifts in electropherogram profiles may reveal the presence of more than one strain of
Wolbachia), we cloned them and sequenced 5-6 positive
clones.
Sequence analysis

The sequences were assembled and aligned in MEGA
version 4.0 [46]. We then built neighbor-joining (NJ)
tree for each gene region using Kimura 2-parameter
(K2P) distance model and pairwise deletion in MEGA
4.0. Genetic distances between all specimens pairs were
also calculated using the K2P model.
COI sequence polymorphism was calculated using
DnaSP version 5.00.04 [47]. Polymorphism parameters
estimated included nucleotide diversity (Pi), haplotype
diversity (Hd), and the number of segregating sites (S).
Neutrality tests were performed on the COI gene to
determine if the frequency spectrum of polymorphisms
conformed to the predictions of the neutral model of
molecular evolution. Under selective neutrality, Tajima’s
D, Fu and Li’s D and Fu and Li’s F are all expected to
equal zero. A value significantly less than zero indicates
a higher-than-expected number of low-frequency variants, which can be caused by a recent selective sweep
or population expansion or selection against weakly
deleterious mutations [26,36-38], whereas a value significantly more than zero signifies low levels of both low
and high frequency polymorphisms, indicating a
decrease in population size or balancing selection [48].
All the sequences representing each COI and ITS2
haplotype and each Wolbachia strain have been deposited in GenBank [GenBank accession numbers
HM582244-HM582279].

the expected equilibruim distributions. In equilibrium populations, the
expected curves are free of waves. The observed curves with many peaks or
resemblance to expected curves mean equilibrium population. On the
contrary, unimodal curves represent population expansion [39].
