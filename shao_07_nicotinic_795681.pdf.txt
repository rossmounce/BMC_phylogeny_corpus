Abstract
Background: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast synaptic cholinergic
transmission in the insect central nervous system. The insect nAChR is the molecular target of a
class of insecticides, neonicotinoids. Like mammalian nAChRs, insect nAChRs are considered to be
made up of five subunits, coded by homologous genes belonging to the same family. The nAChR
subunit genes of Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Anopheles gambiae have been cloned
previously based on their genome sequences. The silkworm Bombyx mori is a model insect of
Lepidoptera, among which are many agricultural pests. Identification and characterization of B. mori
nAChR genes could provide valuable basic information for this important family of receptor genes
and for the study of the molecular mechanisms of neonicotinoid action and resistance.
Results: We searched the genome sequence database of B. mori with the fruit fly and honeybee
nAChRs by tBlastn and cloned all putative silkworm nAChR cDNAs by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. B.
mori appears to have the largest known insect nAChR gene family to date, including nine α-type
subunits and three β-type subunits. The silkworm possesses three genes having low identity with
others, including one α and two β subunits, α9, β2 and β3. Like the fruit fly and honeybee
counterparts, silkworm nAChR gene α6 has RNA-editing sites, and α4, α6 and α8 undergo
alternative splicing. In particular, alternative exon 7 of Bmα8 may have arisen from a recent
duplication event. Truncated transcripts were found for Bmα4 and Bmα5.
Conclusion: B. mori possesses a largest known insect nAChR gene family characterized to date,
including nine α-type subunits and three β-type subunits. RNA-editing, alternative splicing and
truncated transcripts were found in several subunit genes, which might enhance the diversity of the
gene family.

Background
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a ligandgated ion channel (LGIC) that mediates fast synaptic
cholinergic transmission in the insect central nervous system [1]. A nAChR is formed by five subunits arranged

around a central pore that is permeable to cations [2].
These subunits are encoded by multiple α- and β subunit
genes. Diverse nAChRs, differing in subunit composition,
have different electrophysiological and pharmacological
profiles [3]. Agonists, such as acetylcholine, bind to the NPage 1 of 10

terminal extracellular domain of the subunits at a site
formed by six loops (Loop A-F) located at subunit interfaces. The N-terminal extracellular domain also contains a
Cys-loop, characteristic of cys-Loop LGICs, which consists
of two disulphide-bond forming cysteines separated by 13
residues [2]. Each subunit also has four transmembrane
regions (TM1–TM4). The subunits with two vicinal Cys at
loop C which are involved in acetylcholine binding are
classified into α type, whereas other subunits lacking the
two Cys residues are regarded as non-α type [4]. Phosphorylation sites are found in a long intracellular loop
between TM3 and TM4, which may modulate the receptor
activity [5,6].
The genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera have been completely sequenced and
their nAChR gene families have been annotated. D. melanogaster has seven α and three β subunits [7], A. gambiae
has nine α and one β [8], and A. mellifera possesses nine
α and two β [9]. Mammals and chicken have 16 and 17
nAChR subunits respectively [10]. Compared with vertebrates, insects seem to have a small nAChR gene family.
However, recent studies showed that insects may enhance
the functional diversity through alternative splicing of
exons and RNA editing of transcripts [7,9]. In Drosophila,
alternative splicing leads to the loss of some exons or
retention of introns in mature nAChR mRNA [7].
Although study of insect nAChRs is still at an early stage,
researchers have exploited nAChR as an insecticide target
for a long time [11]. To defend against insects and other
herbivores, plants synthesize compounds having insecticidal activities. Nicotine extracted from tobacco, for example, has been used as a commercial insecticide extensively,
which is a potent agonist of nAChR [11]. Neonicotinoids
are a group of insecticides, including imidacloprid, thiamethoxam [12]. These insecticides exhibit low effective dosage, selective toxicity for insects over vertebrates, wide
insecticidal activity, and excellent uptake in plants [13].
Since the first neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid was
put into market, it has gained the fastest growing sales of
any insecticide worldwide [12].
The silkworm, Bombyx mori, producing silk, is an important beneficial insect in many countries. Recently this
insect gained more attention because the silkworm bodies
can express foreign proteins after being infected with
recombinant baculovirus [14]. B. mori is also a good
model organism because of its large body size, ease of
rearing [15], and the completion of the whole genome
sequence [16,17]. B. mori belongs to Lepidoptera, the second largest order of Insecta, possessing about 200 thousand species. Most insects of this order are herbivores and
eat plants at the larval stage and many are agricultural
pests except for the silkworm. Up to date, five α and one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/324

β subunits from Heliothis virescens, one α and one β from
Manduca sexta, one α from Chilo suppressalis and one β
subunit from Spodoptera exigua are deposited in GenBank.
In addition, three alternative transcripts of B. mori α6 were
reported [18]. Despite the agricultural importance of lepidopteran insects, the nAChR subunit gene family from
this order remains unclear. In this report, we report the
molecular characterization of the nAChR gene family
from the silkworm.

Results
Twelve candidate nAChR subunit genes in the B. mori
genome
We searched the B. mori genome sequence database for
nAChR subunit genes by tBlastn [19]. Twelve candidate
genes were identified. Through RT-PCR and RACE analyses, expression of all 12 nAChR subunit genes was confirmed and complete open reading frames (ORFs) were
obtained except Bmα7. A 121 bp sequence encoding the
signal peptide at the N-terminus of Bmα7 was obtained
from an EST sequence [GenBank: BB982760] by BLAST
search [20] and the complete ORF of Bmα7 was then
assembled. Alignment of predicted protein sequences
(Figure 1) shows that all these subunits possess two Cys
separated by 13 residues, typical of LGIC subunits, as well
as six conserved Loops (Loops A-F) located at the N-terminal domain. Nine of them, having two vicinal Cys at Loop
C, belong to type α, whereas the other three lack this motif
and are therefore of type β. All subunits carry a predicted
signal peptide at the N-terminus, and all but one (Bmα5)
possess four transmembrane motifs (TM1–TM4) at the Cterminal domain, which are involved in forming an ion
channel. Bmα5 has only three transmembrane regions
(TM1–TM3). Loops between TM3 and TM4 were highly
variable and have predicted phosphorylation sites. Putative N-glycosylation sites are present in the N-terminal
extracellular domains of all nAChR subunits [21].

Most B. mori nAChRs show high levels of sequence identities with the counterparts of D. melanogaster, up to 86%
(Table 1). However, Bmα5 shares a low sequence identity
with D. melanogaster α5, although it shows the 48%
amino acid identity with A. mellifera α5. We constructed a
phylogenetic tree comprising 39 insect nAChR subunit
protein sequences (Figure 2). In fruit fly, mosquito and
honeybee, nAChR subunits α1, α2, α3, α4, α6, α8, and β1
have strong corresponding relationships. Silkworm also
has counterparts of these subunits, which are consequently named according to the existing nomenclature.
However, subunits Bmα5 and Bmα7 are difficult to identify. In A. mellifera, α7 was named because its N-terminal
domain shared more identity with D. melanogaster α7 and
another was named α5 [9]. We named B. mori α5 and α7
following the nomenclature of A. mellifera because they
had strong corresponding relationships. D. melanogaster

β3 and A. gambiae α9 had low amino acid identities with
other gene family members. Recently, A. mellifera β2 and
α9 were also found having low sequence identities with
other members of the nAChR family, and the two genes
are located closely in the genome at a distance of 10 kb. It
was suggested that the two genes arose from a recent evolutionary duplication event [9]. As shown in Table 1, three
B. mori subunits, Bmα9, Bmβ2, and Bmβ3, have low
sequence similarities with other nAChR subunits. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Bmβ2 and Bmβ3 are clustered into one branch, suggesting that Bmα9 had diverged
before the two β subunits separated evolutionarily. Bmα9
shows 27% sequence identity with A. mellifera α9 and
21% with A. gambiae α9, respectively. Bmβ2 and Bmβ3
show equal sequence identities with A. mellifera β2, 17%.

Gene structure
Figure 3 shows that only subunits α6 of Bombyx and Drosophila share the same exon-intron boundaries. Another
pair, subunit Bmα8 and its Drosophila counterpart, β2,
only differs in one exon boundary. Bmα3 and Bmα7 possess the same number of exons with their Drosophila counterparts. Bmα2 and Bmβ1 of Bombyx possess more exons
than their Drosophila counterparts and α1, α4, and α5 of
Bombyx have fewer exons than their Drosophila counterparts. Surprisingly, three subunits of B. mori, Bmα9,
Bmβ2, and Bmβ3, have no introns.
Alternative splicing
Drosophila nAChR subunit α4 has two alternative forms
differing in residues near the Cys-loop; the α4 subunit
with exon 4' displays a less efficient assembling ability
than that with exon 4 [22]. Silkworm α4 also has these
two alternative exons (Figure 4A). Jin et al (2007) cloned
B. mori α6 and reported that the exons 3 and 8 of this subunit each possess two alternative forms [18]. B. mori α6
could have exon 3a, exon 3b or both in tandem. We found
a transcript of Bmα6 missing both exons 3a and 3b (Figure 4C). Alternative splicing of silkworm nAChRs not
only occurs in α4 and α6, but also in α8. Silkworm α8 has
two alternative exon 7s, located at TM2 and TM3 (Figure
4A). Two alternative exon 4s of α4 are found in Drosophila,
Apis, Anopheles, and Bombyx. It has been postulated that
these alternative exons have arisen from a very ancient
duplication event before the evolutionary divergence of
those insects. However, we found that the two alternative
exon 7s in α8 are extremely similar (86% identity), indicating a more recent duplication event. A phylogenetic
tree was constructed using protein sequences corresponding to the exon 7s from several insects, showing that
duplication of exon 7s appeared before the divergence of
two lepidopteran insects, after the divergence of Apis and
Bombyx, and at the same time with the divergence of Bombyx from two dipteran insects (Figure 4B).

Truncated transcripts
Existence of nAChR transcripts lacking some exons or
retaining some introns has been reported in many insects
as well as in vertebrates [7,9,23]. It was supposed that the
translation products of these transcripts may function as
acetylcholine "sponge" like molluscan ACh-binding protein [24] or change physiological properties by interfering
with the function of normal subunits [23]. In our experiments, truncated transcripts of Bmα4 and Bmα5 were
identified (Figure 5). Bmα4∆6,7,8 lacks exons 6–8 which
includes Loop F and TM1–3. Bmα5∆4 lacks exon 4, which
introduces a premature stop codon because of a frame
shift and only a very short open reading frame is retained.
D. melanogaster α4 and α5 also had truncated transcripts,
but they lack different exons [7].
RNA editing
Four D. melanogaster nAChR subunits, α5, α6, β1, β2, were
found having RNA editing sites. Their B. mori counterparts, α5, α6, α8, β1, were examined for RNA editing sites
in our experiments. cDNA clones from separate RT-PCRs
and the corresponding regions of genomic DNA were
sequenced and compared. While the genomic DNA
sequences were same as those in the silkworm genome
sequence database [19], five bases of α6 (nts #392, 394,
395, 447, and 454) in the cDNA sequence were different
from genome DNA sequence, likely resulting from RNA
editing. These nucleotide changes result in altered residues of N131S, N132G, I149M, and T152A. Possible RNA
editing was also found in three transcript variants of the B.

mori α6 gene [18]. No RNA editing sites were found in
other three subunit genes examined.

Discussion
With the help of the silkworm genome sequence and by
RT-PCR and RACE, we identified the first nAChR subunit
gene family in a lepidopteran insect, and the fourth insect
nAChR gene family, following D. melanogaster, A. gambiae,
and A. mellifera. With 12 members, the nAChR gene family of B. mori is the most complex one among those
reported for insects. Bmα1–8 and β1 are more similar to
the counterparts of other insects compared with the other
three subunits, α9, β2 and β3. The phylogenetic relationship of the three subunits indicated that they might have
arisen from two separate evolutionary duplication events.
The first event likely took place after Bombyx had diverged
from Drosophila and Anopheles, and the second might
occur after Bombyx had diverged from Apis.
The GEK motif preceding TM2 is conserved in most insect
nAChR subunits, and the glutamate residue is considered
to be associated with cation selectivity [2]. Sequence comparison results show that most of the B. mori nAChR subunits contained a GEK motif preceding TM2 (Figure 1),
while the motif was replaced by STR in α9 and β3, and by
TIR in β2. We calculated the amino acid identities of these
three subunits with anion channel subunits including D.
melanogaster GABAR, RDL [GenBank: NM_079267], glutamate-gated chloride channel [GenBank: U58776], histamate-gated chloride channel [GenBank: AF382401], and
vertebrate serotonin receptor [GenBank: AJ005205]. B.

mori α9 shares 10–17% identities with those anion channel subunits, while it shares 27% identity with Apis
nAChR α9. Bombyx β2, β3 share 8–12% identities with
above anion channel subunits, they show 17% identities
with A. mellifera β2. These results show that Bombyx α9, β2
and β3 are likely nAChR subunit candidates as opposed to
being other members of the cys-loop LGIC superfamily.
Whether Bombyx α9, β2 and β3 possess the cation selectivity as other GEK-motif-containing AChR subunits remains
to be determined.
It is an unusual finding that B. mori α5 only has three
transmembrane regions, lacking TM4. Our 3' RACE result
showed the α5 mRNA contained a consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) located 22 bp upstream of the
poly(A) tail. According to the 3'-terminal sequence, we
designed gene specific primers and performed additional
RT-PCR, but failed to find any longer cDNA product that
would include TM4 or another distinct region. These

results suggest that B. mori α5 contains only three transmembrane regions.
Alternative splicing of several exons results in changes of
residues belonging to Loops D, E, Cys-loop, TM2, and
TM3. The truncated transcripts lack exons that contain
sequences for ligand binding or the ion channel pore. We
also detected possible RNA editing events in nAChR
genes. It was reported that RNA editing might change during insect development [18], so additional editing sites
might exist in α6 or other subunits.

Conclusion
Our results show the silkworm contains the largest insect
nAChR gene family characterized to date, including nine
α-type subunits and three β-type subunits. RNA-editing,
alternative splicing and truncated transcripts were found
in several subunit genes, which might further enhance the
diversity of the gene family. These results provide a foun-

dation for future characterization of possibly tissue-specific and developmental expression patterns and the
physiological functions of lepidopteran nAChR receptors.
Furthermore, the comparison of the nAChR gene family
of Bombyx with those of other insects, in particular Lepidoptera, may serve as an important basis for developing
improved insecticides that spare an economically important insect while controlling major agricultural pests.

primers. Subunit-specific oliogonucleotide primer pairs
annealing to different exons were designed to generate
genomic and cDNA PCR products that differed in size
(except for three subunit genes without any intron). Following PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of
25 µL composed of 1 × PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 1 U Taq polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China),
0.4 µM each primer, and 1 µL cDNA template.

Methods

Some N-terminal signal peptides and C-termini are highly
variable between subunits, and could not be identified
with confidence by BLAST. In these cases, 5'- and 3'-RACE
were performed using the SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, USA) to obtain the complete ORF
sequences. For 5'-RACE, the cDNA was synthesized using
gene specific primers. For both 3'-RACE and 5'-RACE, following PCR amplification we used another round of
nested PCR. Other PCR conditions refer to the manual.

Insects
The fertilized B. mori (Strain Dazao) parent eggs were
kindly presented by Dr. Li Muwang in the Silkworm
Research Institute, Agricultural Academy of China, and
the larvae were reared with artificial diet at 25°C.
Bioinformatics analysis and identification of nAChR
subunits in the Bombyx genome
The Bombyx mori genome sequence database [19] was
examined with all D. melanogaster and A. mellifera nAChR
sequences using the tBlastn algorithm [25] to produce
candidate gene fragments. For each subunit, the gene
sequences having the highest similarity were used to
design gene specific primers for RT-PCR [see Additional
file 1] and RACE [see Additional file 2]. 5' of Bmα7 was
obtained by searching the EST database using Blastn
method [20].
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from heads of 4th instar larvae
using TRIzol reagent (Dingguo, Shanghai, China) according to the protocol. One µg total RNA was used for synthesizing the first-strand cDNA using PrimeScript™ Reverse
Transcriptase (Takara, Dalian, China) and gene specific

All PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1%
agarose gel, and DNA fragments were purified with the
DNA Fragment quick purification/recovery kit (Dinguo,
Shanghai, China). The purified DNA fragments were
ligated into pMD 18-T (Takara, Dalian, China), and
sequenced with an ABI-3730 automatic sequencer. The
sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in

Sequence and phylogenetic analyses
Signal peptide cleavage sites were predicted using the SignalP 3.0 server program [26]. Transmembrane regions
were speculated using the TMpred program [27]. Potential
post-translational modification sites including those for
N-glycosylation, cyclic AMP (cAMP)-binding, and protein
kinase C (PKC), CK2, and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation were identified using the PROSITE database [28]. All
B. mori nAChR subunit protein sequences were aligned
using software ClustalX [29] and edited with software
GeneDoc [30]. Similarity and identity values between
nAChR sequences were the output from the GeneDoc program. All Drosophila, Apis, Anopheles, and partial lepidopteran nAChR subunit protein sequences were aligned with
ClustalX and the multiple alignment result was used as
input into the PAUP software (v.4.0b10) to construct phylogenetic trees with the maximum parsimony method and
bootstrapping sampled for 1,000 times [31], and the tree
was viewed with TreeView application [32].
