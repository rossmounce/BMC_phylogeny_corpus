Abstract
Background: The post-translational addition of the monosaccharide O-linked β-Nacetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) regulates the activity of a wide variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic
proteins. The enzymes O-GlcNAc Transferase (Ogt) and O-GlcNAcase (Oga) catalyze,
respectively, the attachment and removal of O-GlcNAc to target proteins. In adult mice, Ogt and
Oga attenuate the response to insulin by modifying several components of the signal transduction
pathway. Complete loss of ogt function, however, is lethal to mouse embryonic stem cells,
suggesting that the enzyme has additional, unstudied roles in development. We have utilized
zebrafish as a model to determine role of O-GlcNAc modifications in development. Zebrafish has
two ogt genes, encoding six different enzymatic isoforms that are expressed maternally and
zygotically.
Results: We manipulated O-GlcNAc levels in zebrafish embryos by overexpressing zebrafish ogt,
human oga or by injecting morpholinos against ogt transcripts. Each of these treatments results in
embryos with shortened body axes and reduced brains at 24 hpf. The embryos had 23% fewer cells
than controls, and displayed increased rates of cell death as early as the mid-gastrula stages. An
extensive marker analysis indicates that derivatives of three germ layers are reduced to variable
extents, and the embryos are severely disorganized after gastrulation. Overexpression of Ogt and
Oga delayed epiboly and caused a severe disorganization of the microtubule and actin based
cytoskeleton in the extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL). The cytoskeletal defects resemble
those previously reported for embryos lacking function of the Pou5f1/Oct4 transcription factor
spiel ohne grenzen. Consistent with this, Pou5f1/Oct4 is modified by O-GlcNAc in human
embryonic stem cells.
Conclusion: We conclude that O-GlcNAc modifications control the activity of proteins that
regulate apoptosis and epiboly movements, but do not seem to regulate germ layer specification.
O-GlcNAc modifies the transcription factor Spiel ohne grenzen/Pou5f1 and may regulate its
activity.

Background
The activities of key proteins must be controlled in a precise spatio-temporal manner for proper embryonic development. This is accomplished by regulation at the
transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. While the effects of post-translational modifications
such as phosphorylation, proteolytic cleavage and Nlinked glycosylation have been well studied, relatively little is known about how the O-linked addition of the simple monosaccharide β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)
affects protein activities during development. This sugar is
attached to a wide variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, including those implicated in controlling important
steps during development such as NeuroD1, β-catenin, cmyc and the cytoplasmic tails of plakoglobin and E-cadherin [1-5]. Other proteins modified by O-GlcNAc
include casein kinase II (CKII), nuclear pore proteins,
RNA polymerase II and numerous transcription factors [615]. These observations implicate O-GlcNAc in the regulation of transcription, protein stability and cell cycle progression, among other events [7,8,16,17]. Attachment of
O-GlcNAc is rapidly induced in response to external stimuli such as nutrient status and stress, and is reversible
[18,19]. Thus, unlike complex glycosylation, O-GlcNAc
modification is highly dynamic and transiently alters protein function in a manner analogous to phosphorylation
[20].
O-GlcNAc is covalently linked to serine and threonine residues of target proteins by the enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (Ogt), which uses the product of the hexosamine
biosynthetic pathway, UDP-GlcNAc, as a high-energy substrate [21,22]. The reverse reaction is catalyzed by O-GlcNAcase (Oga), a cytosolic and nuclear Nacetylglucosaminidase [23,24]. Both Ogt and Oga are
modified by O-GlcNAc. The residues of many proteins
modified by O-GlcNAc are also targets of ser/thr kinases,
suggesting that Ogt modulates signal transduction pathways by preventing phosphorylation kinase targets
[20,25]. This model of regulatory control by O-GlcNAc
modification is supported by studies of the roles of Ogt
and Oga in the insulin pathway. Insulin shuts down glucose production in hepatocytes by promoting the phosphorylation of the CRTC2 transcription factor, which is
then targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation [26].
By O-GlcNAcylating CRTC2, Ogt prevents its phosphorylation and protects it from degradation [27]. CRTC2 then
antagonizes the effects of insulin by inducing expression
of gluconeogenic genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase
[28]. Ogt also antagonizes the response to insulin in adipocytes by modifying and inactivating a number of components of the insulin signal transduction cascade,
including IRSs and PI3K [29,30]. When overexpressed in
adult mice, Ogt induces insulin resistance whereas Oga
suppresses the development of type II diabetes [27,29,31].

In humans, a single ogt gene produces three enzymatic isoforms [32]. Two isoforms are localized to the nuclei and
cytoplasm, while one isoform appears to be localized
exclusively to the mitochondria [33]. Ogt contains two
conserved catalytic domains in the C-terminus, called CDI
and CDII, and an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat
domain (TPR) that differs in the three isoforms and mediates protein-protein interactions [34,35]. Although the
monomer can catalyze the addition of O-GlcNAc in in
vitro assays, multimeric Ogt has a greater affinity for UDPGlcNAc [34]. This suggests that Ogt forms an active multimeric complex in vivo. In support of this idea, the TPR
domain is essential for enzyme activity in Xenopus oocytes
[36]. The recent solving of a bacterial Ogt homolog has
shed light on the activity and specificity of the enzyme
[37].
The role of O-GlcNAc modification in regulating embryonic development has been more difficult to establish. In
mice, ogt is expressed in embryonic stem cells and in all
adult tissues examined [38]. The complete absence of ogt
function is lethal to mouse embryonic stem cells and
embryos, but the phenotype has not been well characterized [38]. Experiments with conditional alleles revealed
that ogt is required in a tissue specific manner at later
stages [39]. Differentiated neurons survive in the absence
of ogt function, but the brains are reduced and animals
survive less than 10 days. By contrast, embryonic fibroblasts do not proliferate in the absence of ogt function, and
mutant T-cells undergo apoptosis. In Xenopus oocytes, OGlcNAc levels fluctuate during oogenesis and remain elevated after fertilization until the onset of gastrulation [36].
Ogt activity is required for oocyte maturation and blocking its activity prevents entry into M-phase [36,40]. These
results show that ogt is required for cell proliferation at
early stages, but has stage and tissue dependent functions
at later stages. We were interested in determining the function of ogt during the blastula and gastrula stages, when
the body axes are established and the germ layers form.
ogt is highly conserved throughout evolution, and orthologues are found in at least three eukaryotic kingdoms,
including animalia, plantae, and fungi [41,42]. Genetic
studies in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana show that it is possible to identify new roles for ogt by analyzing hypomorphic mutant conditions. There are two genes in
Arabidopsis, called spindly (spy) and secret agent (sec) [42].
spy; sec double mutant seeds fail to germinate, indicating
that the two genes have overlapping requirements in early
development [43]. Thus, the requirement of ogt for proliferation in early embryos has been strongly conserved in
plants and animals. In spy single mutants, SEC provides
sufficient Ogt activity to bypass the early requirement,
revealing a later requirement. spy mutant plants display an
aberrant response to the plant growth hormone, gibberel-

lin [44,45]. Therefore in plants, Ogt acts at later stages of
development to regulate specific signalling pathways,
analogous its role modulating the response to insulin in
mammals.
To determine if O-GlcNAc modification modulates signalling pathways that control vertebrate development, we
used the zebrafish model organism. There are two ogt
orthologues in zebrafish, present in tandem copies on
chromosome 14, separated by approximately 200 kb [46].
The two genes are highly similar at the nucleic acid level,
and are expressed maternally and zygotically. The genes
have two alternatively spliced exons in zebrafish ogt, producing six different enzyme isoforms [46]. We show that
both full-length and short Ogt isoforms are active in vitro
and in vivo, in contrast to previous reports [46]. To determine the role of O-GlcNAc modifications in development, we increased or decreased O-GlcNAc levels in
embryos by overexpressing zebrafish Ogt, human Oga, or
morpholinos against ogt transcripts. Each treatment
results in smaller embryos with increased rates of cell
death. In addition, Ogt and Oga overexpressing embryos
have morphogenesis defects, probably resulting from
underlying defects in the actin and microtubule based
cytoskeleton in the yolk. Finally, we show that the pou
class transcription factor Oct4/Pou5f1 is modified by OGlcNAc in human embryonic stem cells. This suggests that
O-GlcNAc regulates the activity of Pou5f1 in embryonic
stem cells and, possibly, in whole embryos. We conclude
that O-GlcNAc modifications play a critical role during
embryogenesis in regulating morphogenesis and cell survival.

Results
Two ogt genes arose from a zebrafish specific gene
duplication
Unlike other animals, zebrafish have two ogt genes, called
copy I and copy II, which are 67% identical at the nucleotide level and 89% identical at the amino acid level [46].
To conform to the standard zebrafish nomenclature, we
rename these genes ogta and ogtb, respectively (Fig. 1A).
Alternative splicing of ogta produces four transcripts (variants 1–4), while alternative splicing of ogtb produces two
transcripts (variants 5 and 6) [46]. The plant Arabidopsis
thaliana is the only other model organism with two ogt
genes, spindly (spy) and secret agent (sec) [42]. We performed a phylogenetic analysis to determine when the
duplication event occurred. Danio rerio ogta is 37% identical to sec at the amino acid level and only 21% identical
to spy. Similarly, Danio rerio ogtb is 39% identical to sec,
and only 22% identical to spy. Thus, both zebrafish genes
are more closely related to one another and to sec than to
spy. This indicates that Danio rerio ogta and ogtb originated
after the plant and animal kingdoms diverged (Fig. 1B).
To pinpoint more precisely when the ogt duplication

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/28

event occurred, we examined the ogt genes in the
sequenced genomes of other metazoan animals, including worms, sea squirts, mice and humans [32,38,47,48].
Each of these species has a single ogt gene, raising the possibility that the zebrafish ogt gene duplication occurred
during the teleost specific whole genome duplication
event (Fig. 1B) [49]. To test this, we examined the
sequenced genomes of other teleost fish for ogt orthologues. The green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), fugu pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), stickleback
(Gasterosteaus aculeatus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) each
have only a single ogt orthologue (Fig. 1B) [50-52]. We
conclude that the D. rerio ogta and ogtb arose from a very
recent, zebrafish specific gene duplication.
To investigate the function of ogt in zebrafish, we isolated
a full-length ogt transcript from a 15–19 hours post fertilization (hpf) cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed
that this transcript encodes the variant 2 Ogt isoform,
which lacks exon 2a and contains exon 19 (Fig. 1A, red
boxes) [46]. Since previous experiments showed that bacterially expressed variant 2 Ogt lacked enzymatic activity
[46], we removed exon 19 from this construct in order to
generate an enzyme with the same sequence as the variant
4 isoform (Fig. 1A) [46].
ogt expression is gradually restricted to the brain
A previous study included an extensive RT-PCR analysis of
expression of all Ogt variants over a developmental time
course [46]. We examined the spatial distribution of ogt
transcripts by in situ hybridization in a developmental
time-course (Fig. 1C–J). Our probe was complementary to
the entire variant 2 sequence and is expected to hybridize
to all transcripts from the ogta and ogtb genes due to the
high homology at the nucleotide level between the two
genes. ogt transcripts are found in all cells of cleavage stage
embryos, consistent with earlier reports of maternal
expression (Fig. 1C) [46]. This staining was specific, since
no signal was detected with a sense probe (Fig. 1D). High
levels of ogt transcripts persist in all cells through the blastula stages (Fig. 1E, F), but decline during gastrulation
(Fig. 1G). At 24 hpf, the staining is more intense in neural
tissues, especially the brain, than in mesodermal tissues
like the notochord (Fig. 1H, arrow). From 36 hpf to 72
hpf, ogt transcripts are localized exclusively in the brain
(Fig. 1I, J). This demonstrates that ogt has a more dynamic
expression pattern than previously suspected, consistent
with the idea that it has different functions at different
stages of embryonic development.
O-GlcNAc modifications regulate embryonic development
Next, we took a loss-of-function approach to determine
the function of ogt during embryonic development. We
designed two translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) against ogt transcripts. MO1 was designed

The origin(see previous page)
The origin and expression pattern of zebrafish ogt genes. (A) Schematic diagram of zebrafish ogta and ogtb loci (formerly known as copy I and copy II, respectively), which are located on Chromosome 14 [46]. Diagrams of variant 2 and 4 transcripts from the ogta gene are represented under the diagram of the ogta locus. The black box represents the 3' UTR, while the
red boxes in the ogta locus and variant 2 transcript represent the alternatively spliced exon 19, which has been proposed to
inhibit O-GlcNAc Transferase activity [46]. Exon 19 is absent from variant 4 transcripts. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of ogt genes
constructed using the neighbor-joining method using aligned amino acid sequences (see materials and methods for gene identifier numbers for each of the sequences used). The A. thaliana ogt gene spy was used to root the tree, since it is the most divergent ogt gene we analyzed. Bootstrap values for 1,000 repetitions are indicated at the nodes. (C-J) A time course of ogt gene
expression from 8-cell (1.25 hpf) (C) to 72 hpf (J) of development reveals that ogt is dynamically expressed in early embryos.
ogt is ubiquitously expressed in cleavage stage (C, E), blastula stage (F) and gastrula stage (G) embryos. Signal is not detected in
embryos incubated with sense probe (D). At 24 hpf, ogt transcripts are expressed at high levels in the brain and lower levels
trunk and tail (H). At 36 hpf (I) and 72 hpf (J), ogt transcripts are restricted to the brain.

to target all transcript variants of ogta, and MO2 was
designed to target all transcript variants of ogtb. Translation blocking MOs inhibit the synthesis of protein from
zygotic and maternal transcripts, but do not affect Ogt
protein synthesized before the MO is injected. We reasoned that the early expressed protein might provide sufficient Ogt activity to bypass any requirement during the
cleavage stages, permitting us to examine the role of Ogt
at later stages of development. At 24 hpf, embryos injected
with 7.5 ng of a control MO developed normally, and the
eyes, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, notochord and
somites are clearly visible (Fig. 2A; N = 40). By contrast,
more than a third of embryos injected with 7.5 ng MO1
(34%) or MO2 (37%) were smaller than controls, with
shortened body axes, reduced heads, small or absent eyes,
and twisted notochords (Fig. 2B, C; N = 32, N = 35, respectively). Some embryos showed signs of necrosis in the
head (Fig. 2C, arrow), which became more pronounced
and more frequent with age (data not shown). When MO
injected embryos are subsequently injected with ogt variant 4 mRNA, the fraction of wild type embryos increases
from less than 10% to more than 50% (Fig. 3). This rescue
rules out potential off-target effects of the MOs.
To confirm that the MOs reduce Ogt levels, we asked if
they could efficiently prevent translation of an Ogt-gfp
fusion protein. Embryos expressing ogt-gfp mRNA produce high levels of the fusion protein, as indicated by GFP
fluorescence. Control MOs have no effect on fluorescence
levels in these embryos (Fig. 2E; N = 30). In the presence
of MO1, however, fluorescence levels decreased below the
level of background yolk autofluorescence (Fig. 2F; N =
30). This suggests that the MO efficiently blocks translation of ogt transcripts and reduces the level of endogenous
Ogt protein. To determine if the MOs reduced global OGlcNAc levels, we performed Western blots on protein
extracts from 18 hpf embryos using an O-GlcNAc specific
antibody (Fig. 2V). For this analysis, we made protein
extracts from embryos injected with MO1 or MO2 that
displayed aberrant morphology and from embryos

injected with a control MO that had normal morphology.
We used the RL2 monoclonal antibody to recognize OGlcNAc modified proteins (Fig. 2V). Quantification of all
the bands revealed that total O-GlcNAc levels are reduced
by 35% in embryos injected with MO1 as compared with
controls, and by 20% in embryos injected with MO2 (Fig.
2V, W). This is consistent with a reduction in endogenous
Ogt protein levels in MO injected embryos.
To determine if the defects in ogt morphants are due to
reductions in O-GlcNAc levels, we expressed 250 pg
mRNA encoding the human orthologue of oga (hOga; gi:
10835355). We found that hOga expressing embryos
have a shortened body axis, reduced heads, small or
absent eyes and twisted notochords (Fig. 2D). These
defects strongly resemble those in ogt morphants, confirming that reducing O-GlcNAc levels has severe consequences on embryonic development. We conclude that OGlcNAc modifications control the activity of proteins
involved in controlling embryonic development.
Derivatives of ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm are
reduced in ogt-depleted embryos
To understand the processes controlled by O-GlcNAc
modifications, we performed an extensive analysis of the
cell types present in ogt morphants by in situ hybridization. A table of the probes used and the tissues they mark
is presented in the Methods (Table 1). We first examined
expression of genes that mark derivatives of the neurectoderm, mesoderm or endoderm. emx1 marks the dorsal telencephalon in embryos injected with the control MO (Fig.
2G) [53]. The emx1 expression domain is slightly reduced
in embryos injected with MO1 (Fig. 2H; N = 20) or MO2
(data not shown; N = 25). Another structure in the dorsal
telencephalon, called the epiphysis, expresses the floating
head (flh) transcription factor (Fig. 2J, arrowhead) [54].
Even in cases of dramatically reduced brains, flh is
expressed normally in the forebrains of ogt morphants, or
is expanded slightly (Fig. 2K, N = 30; MO2 data not
shown, N = 30). The consistent expression of emx1 and flh

Tissues from all three germ layers are reduced in ogt morphants. Comparison of ogt morphants and hOga expressing
embryos with controls at 24 hpf (A-R) or 8 hpf (S-U). (B) Embryos injected with 7.5 ng MO1 (B), MO2 (C) or hOga (D) were
smaller than controls (A), and had curved tails, small brains, reduced or absent eyes and shortened body axes. Necrotic tissue
in the head from the MO injection is indicated (C, arrow)[86]. An Ogt-gfp fusion protein is translated in the presence of control MOs (E), but not in the presence of MO1 (F). In embryos injected with MO1 (H, K, arrowhead) or hOga (I, L, arrowhead),
emx1 expression is slightly reduced compared to controls (G) and flh expression in the epiphysis is normal or slightly
expanded. krox20 is expression is reduced in ogt morphants (N) and hOga expressing embryos (O). α-tropomyosin is reduced
and disorganized in ogt morphants (Q) and hOga overexpressing embryos (R), reflecting the disorganization of the entire body
axis. Fewer sox17 expressing endodermal precursor cells and dorsal forerunner cells are apparent in ogt morphants (T, arrowhead) and hOga overexpressing embryos (U, arrowhead). (V) Extracts from embryos injected with control MO (lane 1), MO1
(lane 2) or MO2 (lane 3) were probed with the RL2 monoclonal antibody (upper) or anti-tubulin antibody (lower). (W)

more than embryos injected with MO2. Anterior is to the left in A-R, dorsal views in S-U. e = eyes. Representative embryos
are shown.

indicates that the dorsal telencephalon forms and is normally patterned in ogt morphants. In the segmented hindbrain, rhombomeres 3 and 5 express the zinc finger
transcription factor krox20 (Fig. 2M) [55]. In Ogt-depleted
embryos, krox20 is still expressed in two stripes, although
expression in rhombomere 3 is often reduced (Fig. 2N, N
= 30; MO2 data not shown, N = 27). In embryos overexpressing hOga, emx1 is expressed in the dorsal telencephalon, as in ogt morphants (Fig. 2I; 4/6), and flh is
expressed in the epiphysis (Fig. 2L; 5/7). In addition,
krox20 transcripts are detected in rhombomeres 3 and 5,
although rhombomere 3 is often reduced (Fig. 2O; 7/10).

Thus, the anterior-posterior patterning of the brain is normal when O-GlcNAc levels are decreased, but the amount
of tissue is slightly reduced in the forebrain and hindbrain.
Derivatives of the mesoderm and endoderm are reduced
and disorganized when ogt function is reduced. Within
the mesoderm, slow muscle forms in the somites on
either side of the midline, and expresses α-tropomyosin
(Fig. 2P) [56]. In the morphants, α-tropomyosin expression
reveals the presence of slow muscle tissue in a reduced
number of highly disorganized somites (Fig. 2Q, 12/19;

MO2 data not shown 9/15). Endoderm precursors are
apparent during gastrulation, as individual sox17 expressing cells migrate toward the animal pole (Fig. 2S) [57]. In
addition, sox17 is expressed in a small group of dorsal
forerunner cells (Fig. 2S, arrowhead), which are not of
endodermal origin [58]. Endodermal expression of sox17
is significantly reduced in the morphants, indicating that
the embryos have fewer endoderm precursors than
embryos injected with control MOs (compare Fig. 2S and
2T). The morphants also have fewer dorsal forerunner
cells (Fig. 2T). Embryos expressing hOga strongly resemble the morphants, and have fewer somites than controls
(Fig. 2R; 5/7). In addition, hOga expressing embryos have
significantly fewer endoderm precursors (Fig. 2U; 17/25)
and dorsal forerunner cells than controls (Fig. 2U, arrowhead). The reduction of ectodermal, mesodermal and
endodermal tissues in ogt morphants and hOga expressing embryos suggests that O-GlcNAc modifications regulate cell proliferation, survival, or cell fate determination.
Induction of mesoderm and endoderm are normal in ogt
morphants
The dramatic reduction in endoderm and the more subtle
reduction in mesoderm and ectodermal derivatives could
be explained by a failure to properly specify the germ layers before gastrulation. Therefore we examined expression
of early mesoderm and endoderm markers in ogt morphants during the pregastrula stages. In controls, the
brachyury homologue no-tail (ntl) is expressed in a marginal ring that includes all mesoderm and endoderm precursors at 5 hpf, as in wild type (N = 15) (Fig. 4A) [59].
This expression is not altered by injection of MO1 (Fig.
4B, N = 25) or MO2 (data not shown). Within the dorsal
mesoderm, flh is expressed in the presumptive notochord,
while goosecoid is expressed in the prechordal plate (Fig.
4C) [59,60]. Both flh (data not shown) and gsc (4D, N =
25) are expressed normally in the morphants. Finally, the
mezzo transcription factor acts downstream of Nodal signals to specify endoderm, and is expressed in a ring at the
margin (Fig. 4G) [61]. Mezzo expression in ogt morphants
(Fig. 4F, N = 30) is indistinguishable from those injected
with control MOs (Fig. 4E). Thus, the expression of early
markers for mesoderm and endoderm appears normal
when O-GlcNAc levels are reduced in ogt morphants.
Therefore, we could find no evidence that O-GlcNAc
modifications control the initial specification of the germ
layers or establishment of the body axes. Instead, we conclude that morphological defects in ogt morphants
observed at later stages are caused by the failure of precursor cells to survive or proliferate, or by aberrant morphogenesis.

factor is expressed in a ring of endoderm precursors in control embryos (E). mezzo expression in the morphants is indistinguishable from controls (F).
Variant 2 and Variant 4 Ogta isoforms are active in vitro
and in vivo
Since tissues are reduced when Ogt is depleted, we asked
if they are expanded when Ogt levels are increased. First,
we asked if the variant 2 and variant 4 proteins encoded
by our constructs displayed O-GlcNAc transferase activity
in in vitro assays. We measured the ability of the bacterially

synthetic CKII peptide, the best established in vitro acceptor substrate for Ogt [34]. A western blot of the bacterial
lysates reveals that equivalent amounts of enzymes were
added to the reactions (Fig. 5A). Both the variant 2 and
variant 4 isoforms were active in this assay (Fig. 5A),

expressed, HIS-tagged variant 2 Ogta and variant 4 Ogta proteins. Both enzymes incorporate significant amounts of [3H]UDPGlcNAc onto the synthetic CKII peptide identical to the human sequence, although variant 4 Ogta is more active than variant
2. A western blot of the bacterial lysates reveals that equivalent amounts of enzyme were added to the reactions. (B-G) Images
of live 24 hpf embryos injected with 500 pg β-galactosidase mRNA (B, C), variant 4 ogta mRNA (D, E), or variant 2 ogt (F, G).
Embryos injected with β-galactosidase mRNA developed normally (B, C). Overexpression of variant 4 ogta mRNA resulted in
three phenotypic classes of embryos at this stage. Class I embryos had a visible, but shortened, body axis and reduced brain,
including reduced or absent eyes (D). The body axis in Class II embryos was strongly reduced and in many cases, not discernable (E). Class III embryos are indistinguishable from wild type (not shown). Expression of variant 2 ogta mRNA produced the
same range of phenotypes, including Class I (F) and Class II (G) embryos. (H, I) Western blot of protein extracts of 18 hpf
embryos injected with 500 pg mRNA encoding β-galactosidase (lane 1), variant 2 ogta (lane 2), variant 4 ogta (lane 3). The blot
was probed with the RL2 antibody, which recognizes the O-GlcNAc modification. This experiment was performed in biological
duplicate (I) Quantification of the blot shown in (H, set 1) and a technical duplicate (set 2). B and C are duplicate images of the
same control embryo.

although the specific activity of both zebrafish proteins is
significantly lower than human Ogt in the same assay
(data not shown). These results contrast to previous
results indicating that variant 2 is inactive [46]. To test
whether the isoforms were active in vivo, we injected
embryos with 500 pg of mRNA encoding either β-galactosidase, variant 2 or variant 4 Ogta protein. We performed a Western blot on extracts from these embryos
using the RL2 antibody, which is specific to the O-GlcNAc
modification (see methods). In two separate experiments,
O-GlcNAc levels were 30–50% higher in embryos overexpressing either variant 4 or variant 2 Ogta than in controls
(Fig. 5H, I). We conclude that Ogta variants 2 and 4 are
active both in vitro and in vivo.
To test the effect of increasing O-GlcNAc levels on embryonic development, we injected embryos with ogta mRNA.
100 pg or 250 pg ogta mRNA did not affect embryonic
development (data not shown). By contrast, 500 pg
mRNA encoding either variant 4 or variant 2 Ogta caused
severe developmental abnormalities (Fig. 5). These
defects are specific, since control embryos injected with
500 pg of β-galactosidase mRNA were indistinguishable
from wild type (Figure 5B, C). Overexpression of variant 4
Ogta generated three classes of embryos at 24 hpf. Class I
embryos had mildly reduced heads, eyes, notochords, and
a shortened body axis similar to that observed in ogt morphants (Figure 5D, 23/129; compare with Fig. 2B, C).
Class II embryos had more severe defects, including
greatly reduced heads, missing eyes and no distinguishable body axis (Figure 5E; 20/129). Finally, class III
embryos were indistinguishable from control embryos
injected with β-galactosidase mRNA (data not shown; 35/
129). The remaining embryos, comprising the largest
group, died soon after gastrulation and therefore are not
counted in the phenotypic classes at 24 hpf (51/129; see
below). Overexpression of variant 2 Ogta produced similar defects at similar frequencies (Figure 5F, G). These

results demonstrate that elevated O-GlcNAc levels disrupt
embryonic development.
Ogt overexpression disrupts the ectoderm, mesoderm and
endoderm
To determine which tissues are affected by increasing OGlcNAc levels, we performed marker gene analysis on Ogt
overexpressing embryos. In the experiments described
below, we obtained similar effects for both Ogta variants.
Unless otherwise indicated, we describe only those from
embryos overexpressing Ogta variant 4. Expression of
emx1 indicates that the dorsal telencephalon is present in
Class I embryos (Fig. 6H, N = 20) and Class II embryos
(Fig. 6O), and is roughly the same size as in β-galactosidase
galactosidase mRNA injected embryos (Fig. 6A). flh is
expressed in the epiphysis in Class I embryos (Fig. 6I; N =
20), as in controls (Fig. 6B, arrowhead). The epiphysis is
greatly reduced or missing in Class II embryos (Fig. 6P,
arrowhead), indicating that the size of the epiphysis varies
widely in Ogta expressing embryos. In the brain, the transcription factor pax2.1 is expressed at the mid-brain/hindbrain (MHB) (Fig. 6C, arrowhead) boundary and in the
more posterior otic vesicles [62]. In class I embryos,
pax2.1 expression in the MHB boundary is not perturbed
(Fig. 6J, arrowhead; 10/20), but the otic vesicles are often
abnormally positioned. In class II embryos, flh expression
at the MHB boundary is severely disrupted (Fig. 6Q,
arrowhead; 5/20). In the hindbrain, krox20 stripes are normal, or slightly narrower in class I embryos (Fig. 6K; N =
25) as compared to controls (Fig. 6D). In class II embryos,
the hindbrains are highly disorganized, and often display
only a single stripe of krox20 expression (Fig. 6R). Thus tissues in the forebrain, mid-brain, and hindbrain are
present, but are reduced and disorganized to varying
extents in Ogt overexpressing embryos. Expression of the
slow muscle marker, α-tropomyosin (Fig. 6E), is expressed
in a reduced number of highly disorganized somites in
Class I (Fig. 6L; 14/20) and Class II (Fig. 6S) embryos. In

Tissues from all three germ layers are reduced in Ogt overexpressing embryos. Analysis of defects in Class I (H-N)
and Class II (O-U) Ogt overexpressing embryos, compared to controls (A-G). Embryos at 24 hpf (A-E, H-L, O-S), 8 hpf (F, M,
T) and 14 hpf (G, N, U) are shown. emx1 expression in class I (H) and class II (O) embryos is indistinguishable from controls
(A). flh expression is slightly expanded in class I (I, arrowhead) and reduced in class II (P, arrowhead) embryos. In class I
embryos, pax2.1 expression is normal in the MHB (J, arrowhead), whereas the otic vesicles are often disrupted (J). In class II
embryos, pax2.1 expression is disrupted in the MHB (Q, arrowhead) and the otic vesicles are reduced or absent (Q). krox20
expression in rhombomeres 3 and 5 is indistinguishable in class I embryos (K) and controls (D). The rhombomeres are
reduced and disrupted in class II embryos (R). α-tropomyosin expression is reduced and disorganized in class I embryos (L) and
more severely reduced and disorganized in class II embryos (S). sox17 expression in endodermal precursors and dorsal forerunner cells is reduced in class I embryos (M) and severely reduced or absent in class II embryos (T) (arrowheads mark the
forerunner cells). hgg1 is reduced in class I (N) and class II (U) embryos. Anterior to the left in A-E, H-L, O-S, dorsal views in
F, M, T, and anterior views in G, N, U. e = eyes.

addition, both classes of embryos have fewer endoderm
precursors at mid-gastrulation than controls, as revealed
by sox17 expression (compare Fig. 6F and 6M). In class II
embryos, only a few sox17 expressing cells are detected
(Fig. 6T). sox17 expression in the dorsal forerunner cells is
reduced or absent in both class I and II embryos (Fig. 6M,
T, arrowheads). The hatching gland, a derivative of the
prechordal plate, expresses the gene hgg1 (Fig. 6G) [63].
hgg1 expression is reduced in class I (Fig. 6N; 12/20) and
class II (Fig. 6U) embryos. The reduced and disorganized
endodermal, ectodermal and mesodermal tissue in Ogt
overexpressing embryos strongly resembles the defects in
embryos with reduced O-GlcNAc levels. Thus, increasing
or decreasing O-GlcNAc levels results in similar defects.
This indicates that O-GlcNAc levels must be tightly regulated within a narrow range for normal development to
occur.

Altering O-GlcNAc levels increases rates of cell death
We next asked if the smaller size of Ogta expressing
embryos could be explained by a reduction in cell
number. To test this, we used flow cytometry to count
cells in embryos overexpressing Ogt and in controls (Fig.
7A–D). We injected embryos with a combination of either
β-galactosidase mRNA and FITC-conjugated dextran, or
ogta variant 4 mRNA and AlexaFluor-647-conjugated dextran. We mixed equal numbers of embryos from both
groups at 18 hpf, when morphological differences
between Ogt overexpressing embryos and the controls are
apparent, and the embryos were homogenized to disperse
the cells. In our analysis, we counted only cells in the 5–
10 μm diameter range. In one experiment, we counted
67,711 cells in 20 control embryos and only 43,213 cells
of the same size in 20 Ogt expressing embryos (Fig. 7D).
Thus, control embryos contained 23% more cells than

Ogt expressing embryos. Similar results were obtained in
an independent experiment with fewer embryos (data not
shown). This demonstrates that decreased cell number
accounts for the reduced body size of Ogt overexpressing
embryos.
The reduced cell number in Ogt overexpressing embryos
could be explained by either an increase in apoptosis or a
decrease in cell division. At 8 hpf, control embryos have
only a few dying cells, as assessed by the extent of acridine
orange staining (Fig. 7E). By contrast, injection of variant
4 ogta mRNA dramatically increases the number of dying
cells, as shown by the increase in acridine orange fluorescence (Fig. 7G). Ogt overexpressing embryos have more
dying cells than controls at every time point examined
between 8 hpf and 24 hpf (data not shown). Thus,
increased cell death could account for the decreased cell
number in Ogt overexpressing embryos. ogt morphants
and hOga expressing embryos display a similarly dramatic
increase in the number of acridine orange staining cells
(Fig. 7F, H). Thus, embryos with reduced levels of O-GlcNAc display elevated rates of cell death. The resulting
decrease in cell number could explain the smaller size of
ogt morphants and hOga expressing embryos. These
results also confirm our earlier conclusion that the defects
resulting from decreased levels of O-GlcNAc are similar to
those observed in Ogt overexpressing embryos.
OGT overexpression causes defective morphogenesis
Although the increase in cell death could explain the
reduced size of Ogt overexpressing embryos, it does not
explain their aberrant morphology. To better understand
when the embryos become disorganized, we examined
markers of axial and paraxial mesoderm just after gastrulation, and during the segmentation stages. In control
embryos after gastrulation, the cells of the axial mesoderm
express ntl and extend along the midline (Fig. 8A). In Ogt
expressing embryos, by contrast, ntl expression is truncated along the midline, resulting in a shortened body axis
(Fig. 8B). In class II embryos, ntl expression is completely
restricted to the margin (Fig. 8C). MyoD is expressed early

in the segmented mesoderm that gives rise to the somites
(Fig. 8D). Ogt expressing embryos have fewer somites
than controls, with somites often forming in only half the
embryo (Fig. 8E) [64]. In addition, the somites in class I
embryos are often wider than those in controls (Fig. 8E).
In class II embryos, the somites are extremely broad and
nearly encircle the embryo (Fig. 8F). The aberrant morphology of the axial and paraxial mesoderm suggests that
Ogt expression disrupts the morphogenetic movements
associated with gastrulation.
OGT overexpression causes delays in epiboly
The first morphogenetic movement in the zebrafish
embryo, called epiboly, begins before gastrulation when
the blastoderm thins and spreads over the entire yolk
[65]. As reported above (see Fig. 5), a large fraction of Ogt
overexpressing cells die before 24 hpf, and many embryos
examined before this stage had signs of defective morphogenesis (see Fig. 8). To determine if epiboly is disrupted by
Ogt overexpression, we monitored the development of
live embryos during a time course from 3–12 hpf. Ogt
overexpressing embryos develop at the same rate as controls during the cleavage stages, and reach the 1000-cell
stage at 3 hpf (Fig. 9A, E). Epiboly begins at 4.3 hpf in Ogt
overexpressing embryos, as in wild type, and they reach
40% epiboly at 5 hpf (Fig. 9B, F). Occasional blastomeres
separate from the blastoderms of Ogt overexpressing
embryos during this period, and the remaining blastomeres are unevenly distributed around the margin (Fig.
9F). Gastrulation begins at 6 hpf, and control embryos
reach mid-gastrulation two hours later (Fig. 9C). During
the same time, epiboly does not progress in Ogt overexpressing embryos, which appear stalled at 40% epiboly
(Fig. 9G). Less severely affected embryos progress through
epiboly at a slower rate (data not shown). Thus, increased
Ogt activity delays the late phase of epiboly, but does not
affect the onset or initial progression of epiboly. At 12 hpf,
when β-galactosidase expressing embryos are at the 3somite stage (Fig. 9D), a large fraction of Ogt overexpressing embryos degenerate (Fig. 9H; 52/129). We observed
similar defects along the same time course in embryos

MyoD marks trunk somites on either side of the midline at 14 hpf (D). Some somites are missing in class I embryos, but many

overexpressing variant 2 ogt mRNA and hOga (data not
shown). We conclude that O-GlcNAc modifications control the activity of one or more proteins involved in the
progression through epiboly.
Ogt and hOga overexpression disrupts yolk microtubules
and actin filaments
Disruption of the microtubule (MT) or actin-based
cytoskeletal network in the yolk disrupts epiboly in a similar manner to that observed in Ogt and hOga overexpressing embryos [66-68]. Therefore we asked if the yolk
cytoskeleton is disrupted when the enzymes are overexpressed. To examine the MT network, we utilized the antibody against α-tubulin (12G10) [69]. In 4 hpf controls, Zprojections of confocal images reveal a short latticework
of MTs connecting the nuclei within the YSL and a network of longer MTs extending through the cortical yolk
cytoplasm toward the vegetal pole (Fig. 10A, D), as previously described [67]. When Ogt activity is elevated, the
MTs are shortened and they do not interconnect within
the YSL (Fig. 10B, E). In addition, the MT filaments appear

thicker than normal (Fig. 8D, E arrowheads). These results
demonstrate that elevated Ogt activity disrupts the MT
arrays in the yolk, either directly or indirectly. Similarly,
the MT filaments appear shorter and thicker in embryos
overexpressing hOga (Fig. 10C, F, arrowhead). This indicates that increasing or decreasing O-GlcNAc levels disrupts that yolk MT network.
In embryonic cells, F-actin associates with the cytoplasmic
domain of E-cadherin in the cortical cytoplasm and decorates the cell membranes as visualized by rhodaminephalloidin [70]. In control embryos, EVL cells are of
roughly equal size and shape (Fig. 10G, J). By contrast, the
shape and size of EVL cells are greatly disrupted by overexpression of Ogt (Fig. 10H, K) and of Oga (Fig. 10I, L).
In controls, a punctate band of F-actin is detected within
the YSL, underneath the EVL cells (Fig. 10G, J arrows)[68].
This band contracts during gastrulation and provides
some force driving epiboly [68]. The band of actin in the
YSL was missing in class I and class II Ogt overexpressing
embryos (Fig. 10H, K, arrows). Similarly, the contractile

and 12 hpf (D, H). Progression through the cleavage stages in ogt overexpressing embryos (E) is indistinguishable from controls
(E). Epiboly initiates normally when Ogt is overexpressed, and these embryos reach 40% epiboly at 5 hpf (B), the same as controls (F). Ogt overexpressing embryos are stalled at 40% epiboly at 8 hpf (G), when controls are at 75% epiboly (G). Control
embryos complete epiboly at 10 hpf and reach the 3 somite stage at 12 hpf (D). The most severely affected Ogt overexpressing
embryos never complete epiboly and begin to degenerate at 12 hpf (H).
actin ring was not detected in hOga overexpressing
embryos (Fig. 10I, L). Thus, overexpressing hOga or Ogt
results in a severe disruption of the actin and MT yolk
cytoskeleton networks that drive epiboly movements.
Ogt modifies human POU5F1 protein
Some defects caused by increased levels of Ogt resemble
those described in embryos lacking the maternal and
zygotic function of the pou class transcription factor Spiel
Ohne Grenzen/Oct4/Pou5f1 (MZSpg) [71,72]. The late
phase of epiboly is delayed MZspg embryos, and cells in

the EVL are irregularly shaped [71]. Secondly, MZspg
embryos can display fused somites and truncated notochords, similar to those in embryos overexpressing Ogt
(Fig. 8F) [72]. Finally, endoderm is reduced or absent in
MZspg embryos, just as in embryos with increased or
decreased O-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 2T, U; Fig. 6M, T)[73].
This raises the possibility that O-GlcNAc modifies Spg/
Pou5f1 protein and regulates its function. Therefore, we
asked if this protein is modified by O-GlcNAc. Since there
is no antibody for zebrafish Spg/Pou5f1, we asked if
human Pou5f1 is modified with O-GlcNAc in human

in hOga expressing embryos (F, arrowhead). Staining with rhodamine-phalloidin reveals actin filaments associated with the
plasma membranes of EVL cells and the contractile actin ring in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) (G-L). The contractile actin ring is
apparent within the YSL of controls (G, J arrow), but not in OGT overexpressing embryos (H, K, arrow) or hOga expressing

embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We found that the O-GlcNAc specific monoclonal antibody RL-2 recognizes a 43
KDa protein immunoprecipitated by the Pou5f1 antibody
(Fig. 11, left lane). This size is consistent with human
Pou5f1 protein. Consistent with this, the same band
reacts with the Pou5f1 polyclonal antibody when the blot
is stripped and reprobed (Fig. 11, right lane). This demonstrates that Pou5f1 is modified by O-GlcNAc in hESCs.
Given the high degree of homology between the human
and zebrafish orthologues, it is likely that the zebrafish
protein is also modified by O-GlcNAc [74,75]. It remains
to be determined whether this modification regulates Spg/
Pou5f1 activity.

Discussion
In this work we used gain and loss of function experiments for the first time to study the role of Ogt and Oga
during vertebrate development. We demonstrated that OGlcNAc modifications control cell survival and epiboly
movements in zebrafish embryos, but could find no evidence that they control early cell fate decisions. Furthermore, we observed the same range of defects whether Ogt
protein was overexpressed or depleted. Since our enzymes
are active in in vitro assays, this indicates that embryonic
cells are highly sensitive to increases and decreases in the
level of O-GlcNAc modifications. Finally, we identified
Spg/Pou5f1 as a target for Ogt activity. These findings significantly extend previous genetic analyses of ogt function
in embryos, and demonstrate that O-GlcNAc modifications regulate the activity of proteins involved in controlling morphogenetic movements.
Zebrafish have two ogt paralogues
Unlike other vertebrates, zebrafish have two ogt genes,
which we call ogta and ogtb, which arose during a recent
gene duplication (Fig. 1A, B). Previous studies showed
that transcripts from both loci encode O-GlcNAc transferase proteins, although one isoform (variant 2) failed to
modify full-length p62 protein in vitro [46]. Two lines of
evidence indicate variant 2 Ogta can modify proteins
other than p62 (Fig 5). First, this protein catalyzes the
addition of O-GlcNAc to the CKII peptide in vitro (Fig.
5A). This demonstrates that variant 2 Ogta is catalytically
active, but does not provide any information about the
endogenous substrates of this enzyme. Secondly, overexpression of variant 2 in embryos causes similar defects as
overexpression of variant 4 Ogt, which would not be
expected if the protein were catalytically inactive (Fig. 5F,
G). In support of this conclusion, we found that variant 2
expressing embryos had increased O-GlcNAc levels as
compared to control embryos injected with β-galactosidase
mRNA (Fig. 5). We conclude that variant 2 Ogta is catalytically active. The apparent discrepancy between our results
and those of Sohn and Do (2005) could be explained if

Page 17 of 24

BMC Developmental Biology 2009, 9:28

variant 2 Ogta is unable to recognize p62, but can still recognize other substrates.
To reduce O-GlcNAc levels, we designed translationblocking MOs against ogta and ogtb. Several lines of evidence indicate that the MOs specifically reduced ogt function. First, the ogt MOs prevented translation of mRNA
encoding an Ogt-gfp fusion protein, whereas control MOs
had no effect (Fig. 2E, F). Second, ogt MOs reduced the
total amount of O-GlcNAc modifications in the embryo
(Fig. 2V, W). This confirms that ogta and ogtb encode proteins that are required for O-GlcNAc transferase activity in
vivo. Third, the defects in ogt morphants were rescued by
co injection of a low dose of ogt mRNA (Fig. 3). Finally,
overexpression of hOga, which removes O-GlcNAc from
target proteins, caused similar defects to those observed in
ogt morphants (Fig. 2D). The fact that MOs did not completely eliminate O-GlcNAc modifications can be
explained by the persistence of Ogt protein translated
from maternal transcripts prior to MO injection. In addition, each MO was designed to target only one ogt gene.
Thus, Ogt protein continues to be synthesized from the
non-targeted paralogue in ogt morphants.
Gain and loss of ogt function produce similar defects
ogt morphants were smaller than controls and displayed a
dramatic increase in apoptosis (Fig. 2B, C; Fig. 7). In addition, the morphants were deficient in endoderm and
some mesoderm and ectoderm derivatives (Fig. 2). It is
remarkable that we observe such strong phenotypes with
ogt MOs (Fig. 2B, C) that reduced total O-GlcNAc modifications by only 20–35% (Fig. 2V, W). This raises the possibility that some Ogt targets may be more sensitive to
reductions in O-GlcNAc than others. Furthermore, it suggests that additional roles for O-GlcNAc modifications
could be uncovered if the amount of O-GlcNAc modifications were reduced to a greater extent, perhaps by co-injection of both MO1 and MO2. Given the dramatic increase
in apoptosis in Ogt morphants (Fig. 7), however, it is possible that further reductions in O-GlcNAc levels would
merely result in more dead or dying cells.

In a complementary approach, we overexpressed two variants of zebrafish Ogt. The resulting embryos were smaller
than controls, and lacked endoderm and some ectoderm
and mesoderm derivatives (Fig. 2). Cell counts revealed
that Ogt overexpressing embryos had significantly fewer
cells than controls, due to a concomitant increase in cell
death (Fig. 7). Thus, embryonic development is severely
disrupted by reducing O-GlcNAc levels by 20–35% as well
as by increasing Ogt levels. This suggests that O-GlcNAc
modifications must be maintained within a fairly narrow
range for normal development. Surprisingly, decreasing
O-GlcNAc levels produced the same range of defects as
those observed in Ogt overexpressing embryos. This indi-

cates that both the addition of O-GlcNAc to target proteins and its removal are essential for embryonic
development. This is consistent with the idea that O-GlcNAc cycles on and off proteins, controlling a switch
between two different active states [20].
O-GlcNAc levels control the morphogenetic movements of
epiboly
Our results indicate that gastrulation stage embryos are
especially sensitive to changes in O-GlcNAc levels. First,
we found that ogt expression decreases during gastrulation, consistent with the previous RT-PCR analysis (Fig.
1C–G) [46]. In Xenopus, Ogt protein levels also decrease
during gastrulation [36]. This suggests that the downregulation of ogt during gastrulation has been conserved
through evolution. In support of this conclusion, overexpression of Ogt or hOga causes a delay in epiboly (Fig. 9,
10 and data not shown). We did not observe delays in epiboly in ogt morphants, probably because these embryos
continue expressing a significant amount of Ogt protein,
as described above.

Control of morphogenetic movements represents a new
role for O-GlcNAc modifications. To understand how OGlcNAc might act during epiboly, we examined the MT
and actin cytoskeleton in the yolk (Fig. 10). We found that
the MT network in the cortical cytoplasm was disrupted in
Ogt overexpressing embryos, with the MTs forming shortened, thickened filaments. The MT network is also disrupted in embryos overexpressing hOga. Similarly, the
contractile actin ring in the YSL is absent in embryos overexpressing Ogt and hOga. We conclude that O-GlcNAc
either directly or indirectly regulates that cytoskeletal network in the yolk.
The similarities between embryos overexpressing Ogt or
hOga and those lacking the pou class transcription factor
Spg/Pou5f1, suggest that Spg/Pou5f1 protein is a target of
Ogt and that O-GlcNAc inactivates Spg/Pou5f1 protein.
Consistent with this, we found that Pou5f1 protein
immunoprecipitated from undifferentiated human ES
cells is modified by O-GlcNAc. There is a high degree of
sequence homology between human Pou5f1 and
zebrafish Spg [74]. Mouse Pou5f1 can rescue spg mutants,
indicating a high degree of functional conservation
between the two proteins [75]. Therefore, it is highly
likely that zebrafish Spg protein is also modified by Ogt.
It is not known how O-GlcNAc modification regulates
Pou5f1 function. Like many targets of Ogt, Pou5f1 is also
modified by phosphorylation and the ability of Pou5f1 to
stimulate transcription correlates with its phosphorylation status [76]. Depending upon which residues are
modified, O-GlcNAc may stimulate or inhibit phosphorylation of Spg/Pou5f1 [20]. Further experiments are necessary to identify the residues modified by O-GlcNAc and

to determine the functional consequences of O-GlcNAcylation on Spg/Pou5f1 protein.

Conclusion
O-GlcNAc modifications are a poorly understood posttranslational mechanism for regulating embryonic development. We demonstrated that embryonic O-GlcNAc levels control epiboly movements and cell survival, but do
not regulate the initial cell fate decisions. Interestingly,
gain and loss of ogt function produced the same range of
defects. This indicates that the overall level of O-GlcNAc
modification must be tightly controlled for normal
embryonic development. Finally, O-GlcNAc modifies the
pou class transcription factor Pou5f1 in human embryonic stem cells. Although the effect of this modification
on Pou5f1 activity is not yet understood, it is possible that
some of the defects described in this paper are mediated
by improper regulation of Pou5f1.

Methods
Zebrafish strains, staging and imaging live embryos
We obtained wild type embryos by natural mating of WIK
adults. Embryonic stages were determined by morphology and are reported as hours post fertilization (hpf) at
28.5°C, according to Kimmel et al., 1995. Live embryos
were mounted in 3% methylcellulose in depression slides,
oriented appropriately and photographed under a Leica
MZFLIII stereo dissecting microscope using bright field
optics. For the time course, embryos were mounted at 2.5
hpf and stored on slides in wet chambers at 28.5°C.
Images were obtained at regular intervals.
Isolating clones encoding variant 2 and variant 4 Ogta
We isolated a cDNA encoding the variant 2 isoform by
PCR using a 15–19 hpf cDNA library as a template (gift
from Bruce Appel, Vanderbilt University). Primers were
designed from the full-length OGT sequence [46]. OGT
full-length F: 5'-TTACGTCGACGAATGGCGAGCTCGGTG-3', OGT full-length R: 5'-ATGCGCGGCCGCGATCAGGTGCTCTCGC-3'. The PCR product was sequenced,
and found to encode the variant 2 isoform. The cDNA was
subcloned into the XbaI site of the pCS2 plasmid using
the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA).
To generate a cDNA encoding variant 4 OGT, we deleted
exon 19 from variant 2 by long extension polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) using primers flanking exon 19.
OGTextF: 5'-TTTTTCTTAAGAAAAAGGCTGTTATTGACT3'; OGTextR: 5'-AATTAGCTGGGTACCGGGCCCAATOGATTGGC-3';
exon19F:
5'-GCCACCACACAGATTAACAATAAA-3',
exon19R:
5'TTTTTCCCCCGCGGCCGCGAATTAAAAAACCTCCC-3'.
To make the Ogt-GFP fusion protein using the Gateway
system (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), we amplified the
N-terminal portion of Ogt using the following primers:
BPogt1500F: 5'-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAG-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/28

GCTTAATGGCGAGCTCGGTGGGG-3'; BPogt1500R: 5'GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAGCTGTGATGCGGATGCAC-3'. The resulting product was recombined into pDONR211. For the LR reaction, pDONRNogt
was mixed with p3E-egfp and pCSDEST-2 and LR clonase
following the manufacturers instructions.
Phylogenetic analysis of ogt genes
ClustalW sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
of ogt genes were performed on MacVector software. To
construct the tree, we used the Neighbor joining method,
and bootstrap values from 1000 replications are presented. We compared the Danio rerio ogt proteins (copy I:
ENSDARP00000074945;
copy
II:
ENSDARP00000054555), to those in Arabidopsis thaliana
(SEC: NP187074; SPY: NP187761), Mus musculus

Ciona

(ENSCINP00000003035),

(NP001040861).
Whole mount in situ hybridization
in situ hybridization was performed as previously
described [77]. We used the following probes described in
Table 1[78-81].
Microinjection of mRNA and MOs
Sense mRNA was made using the Ambion mMessage
mMachine RNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, Austin
TX). We injected 500 pg of ogt or β-galactosidase mRNA, or
250 pg hOga mRNA into chorionated embryos at the 1–4
cell stage. Embryos were allowed to develop and examined at 24 hpf or fixed at appropriate stages for in situ
hybridization.

Translation blocking antisense morpholinos (MOs) to ogt
transcripts were obtained from Gene Tools, Inc. (Philomath, OR). Their sequences are as follows: OGT MO1: 5'CCACGTTCCCCACCGAGCTTGCCAT-3'; OGT MO2: 5'TCTCCTTCACTCTTTACTGGATTCT-3'; OGT control
(inverted): 5'-TCTTAGGTCATTTCTCACTTCCTCT-3'. To
monitor efficiency of the injections, MO2 was tagged on
the 3' with lissamine, and the inverted control was tagged
at the 3' end with fluorescein. MOs were dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 30 mg/ml and stored at
-20°C. The working stock of each MO was diluted to 7.5
ng/nl in 0.2 M KCL prior to injection. Embryos were
injected with 1 nl MO at the 1–4 cell stage. Embryos were
allowed to develop and examined at 24 hpf or fixed at
appropriate stages for in situ hybridization. For rescue
experiments, embryos were injected first with 7.5 ng ogt

Flow cytometry and cell death assays
We used flow cytometry to count cells in control and Ogt
overexpressing embryos. We injected embryos with either
a combination of β-galactosidase mRNA/FITC-conjugated
dextran, or ogt variant 4 mRNA/AlexaFluor-647-conjugated dextran. Embryos were raised at 25°C until 18 hpf,
when they were manually dechorionated. Prior to dissociation, we mixed an equal number normal embryos
injected β-galactosidase mRNA/FITC-conjugated dextran
with Class I and Class II embryos injected with ogta variant
4 mRNA/AlexaFluor-647-conjugated dextran. The
embryos were placed inside a nylon mesh basket that had
been inserted into a 5 mm glass dish containing 10 ml
PBS and 1% BSA, and ground with a plastic pestle. Dissociated cells were collected in plastic tubes and placed at
4°C. To concentrate the cells, we pelleted the cells by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 250 μl PBS, 1% BSA. The mixture of cells was
analyzed in a LSR-II Analyzer (BD Biosciences) with BD
FACSDiva 4.2 software. To detect cells containing FITCdextran, the samples were excited by a sapphire blue laser
at 488 nm, and the emission wavelength was detected
with a 530 +/- 30 band-pass filter. To detect cells containing AlexaFluor-647-dextran, samples were excited with a
HeNe laser at 633 nm, and the emission fluorescence was

detected with a 660 +/-20 band-pass filter. Size gating was
fixed by running 5 and 10 μm diameter standard beads.
Cells from a small number of uninjected control embryos
served as a control for autofluorescence. Gates for the
respective fluorophores were established by running samples with only FITC positive cells or only AlexaFluor-647
positive cells.
To assay for apoptosis, we dechorionated embryos on an
agar-coated plate, and placed them in 5 μg/ml of acridine
orange (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in embryo (E3)
medium [82,83]. After 30 minutes, embryos were washed
three times with embryo (E3) medium. The embryos were
visualized using the FITC filter of a Leica MZFLIII fluorescent dissecting microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL).
Immunofluorescence and Confocal analysis of the
cytoskeleton
At 8 hpf embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4°C.
Embryos were dechorionated and washed thoroughly
with PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBT). They were incubated in blocking solution containing 2% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 2 hours. To label
F-Actin, embryos were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad CA)
at a dilution of 1:40 at room temperature in the dark.

BMC Developmental Biology 2009, 9:28

Embryos were washed 5 times in PBT, five minutes each
wash. To make the stock solution, we dissolved rhodamine-phalloidin in methanol at a concentration of 6.6 μM
and stored at -20°C. To analyze yolk MTs, embryos were
manually dechorionated on agar-covered plates, and fixed
at 4 hpf in Gard's Fixative for 4 hours at room temperature
in small glass tubes [Gard's Fixative: 3.7% formaldehyde,
0.25% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100, 80 mM PIPES,
pH 6.8, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2[84]]. They were
washed once with PBS and stored overnight in 100%
methanol at -20°C. The following day embryos were
washed three times with PBS and incubated in 3.7 mg/ml
NaBH4 for 6 hours at room temperature. The embryos
were then washed 8 times in PBS and blocked for 1.5 hrs
in blocking solution (1% DMSO, 0.5% Triton, 2% BSA,
2% sheep serum) and transferred to eppendorf tubes.
Embryos were incubated in primary antibody (12G10
monoclonal anti α-tubulin antibody) at 1:100 dilution in
block solution overnight. The following day, embryos
were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated overnight in
anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Zymed Laboratories) at a dilution
of 1:200. Embryos were then washed with PBS and
mounted and analyzed in a Leica TCS SP Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn IL). Images were
gathered in 10 μm sections and presented in Z-stacks.
Bacterial expression of Ogt and enzymatic activity
Nucleotide sequences encoding variant 2 and variant 4
Ogt were cloned into pDONR (entry) and pDEST17
(expression) vectors via sequential recombination reactions according to manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Expression plasmids containing the insert
were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS competent
cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To prepare bacterial lysate
for activity assay, a colony of E. coli with each construct
was culture in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at room temperature at 250 rpm for 24 hours without
induction. After harvesting, the cell pellets were processed
as previously described [16]. E. coli strains containing
human Oga and Ogt were also expressed in parallel for
negative and positive controls respectively. To estimate
the Ogt levels, E. coli lysates were resolved by precast 7.5%
Tris-HCl precast minigel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules
CA), and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane
(Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA). After blocking with 3%
BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane
was probed with HisProbe-HRP (1:1000 dilution,
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the final detection
of HRP activity was performed using SuperSignal West
Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA) and exposed to CL-XPosure film (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Quantification of Ogt levels
was done using Gel DocXR imager (Bio Rad Laboratories,
Hercules CA). For enzymatic assay, 40 μg of crude lysate
was added into reaction mixture containing a synthetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/28

CKII peptide and UDP- [3H]GlcNAc as previously
described [10] and allowed to react at 37°C for 35 min.
The product was then purified via C18 column chromatography and the radioactive incorporation was measured
by scintillation counter. The net incorporation of radioactive GlcNAc was subtracted by the reading of the negative
control and normalizing the levels of Ogt before plotting.
Immunoprecipitation of POU5F1 from hES cells
To prepare the nucleocytosolic fraction for immunoprecipitation, a pellet of human ES cells (BG02) was resuspended in 4 volumes of hypotonic buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5/Protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche, Indianapolis,
IN) and transferred into a 2 ml homogenizer. After incubating on ice for 10 min, the cell suspension was subjected to dounce homogenization followed by another 5
min incubation on ice. One volume of hypertonic buffer
(0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 2 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM
DTT/Protease inihibitor cocktail) was then added to the
lysate. The lysate was incubated on ice for 5 min followed
by another round of dounce homogenization. The resulting lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing the Oga inhibitor PUGNAc (final concentration
10 μM) and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 25 min at 4°C
[85]. The supernatant was transferred to new microcentrifuge tube. Protein concentration was determined using
Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA).

To immunoprecipitate Pou5f1, 1 mg of nucleocytosolic
fraction was supplemented with 1% NP-40 and 0.1%
SDS, and precleared with a mixture of normal rabbit IgG
AC and protein A/G PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA) at 4°C for 30 min. Following clarification, the precleared supernatant was incubated for 3
hours at 4°C in the presence of goat polyclonal antibody
raised against an N-terminal Pou5f1 peptide (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA) at a 1:200 dilution. 40 μl
of protein A/G PLUS agarose slurry was then added into
the IP sample and the mixture was incubated for another
2 hours at 4°C. After washing with 4 ml of IP wash buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1%
SDS), the IP complex was eluted by adding 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and
boiled at for 3 min. The sample was resolved by a 10%
Tris-HCl precast minigel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules
CA), and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane
(Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA). After blocking with 3%
BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane
was probed with RL-2 (1:1000 dilution) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). The final detection of HRP activity
conjugated to the secondary antibodies was performed
using SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and exposed to
CL-XPosure film (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). After
developing the image on the film, the blot was then
