Abstract
Background: HIV-1 penetrates the central nervous system, which is vital for HIV-associated
dementia (HAD). But the role of cellular infiltration and activation together with HIV in the
development of HAD is poorly understood.
Methods: To study activation and infiltration patterns of macrophages, CD8+ T cells in relation
to HIV in diverse CNS areas of patients with and without dementia. 46 brain regions from two
rapidly progressing severely demented patients and 53 regions from 4 HIV+ non-dementia patients
were analyzed. Macrophage and CD8+ T cell infiltration of the CNS in relation to HIV was assessed
using immuno-histochemical analysis with anti-HIV (P24), anti-CD8 and anti-CD68, anti-S-100A8
and granzyme B antibodies (cellular activation). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 12.0
with Student's t test and ANOVA.
Results: Overall, the patterns of infiltration of macrophages and CD8+ T cells were indiscernible
between patients with and without dementia, but the co-localization of macrophages and CD8+ T
cells along with HIV P24 antigen in the deeper midline and mesial temporal structures of the brain
segregated the two groups. This predilection of infected macrophages and CD8+ T cells to the
middle part of the brain was unique to both HAD patients, along with unique nature of provirus
gag gene sequences derived from macrophages in the midline and mesial temporal structures.
Conclusion: Strong predilection of infected macrophages and CD8+ T cells was typical of the
deeper midline and mesial temporal structures uniquely in HAD patients, which has some influence
on neurocognitive impairment during HIV infection.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with the development of neurological complications
in many infected individuals, most especially a broad
spectrum of motor impairments and cognitive deficits.
Approximately 80-90% of autopsied cases of HIV-1infected people demonstrated neuropathological changes
[1-4]. The histopathology of HIV-associated dementia
(HAD) is characterized by brain infiltration of mononuclear cells, formation of multinucleated giant cells, astrogliosis, and neuronal damage sometimes with neuronal
loss [5,6]. The underlying mechanisms of HAD leading to
neurological disorders and its complete understanding is
still lacking. In addition, after the introduction of highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the prevalence of
HAD has risen due to prolonged life expectancy of HIVinfected patients [7-9].
HIV-1 penetration of the central nervous system is a vital
event in the neuropathogenesis of HAD. The presence of
HIV in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is one of the factors
implicated in HAD [10-12], although high plasma viral
load do not necessarily correlate with dementia. The principal cell types infected by HIV in the CNS and implicated
in HIV related neuronal dysfunction are macrophages and
microglia, which are known to secrete cytokines and factors toxic to neurons [13]. It is also widely believed that
monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages may be
required for neurologic manifestation of HIV disease
[14,15]. Blood-borne macrophages can transmit the virus
into the CNS and then infect or stimulate other perivascular macrophages and microglia [12,16]. However, HAD
usually occurs at an advanced stage of HIV disease, while
HIV entry into the CNS has been reported to occur early
after primary infection [17,18]. The most popular explanation for this discrepancy is the collapse of immune
functions mediated by T cells because cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are believed to be the principal regulatory
elements that control viral production in the periphery
and CNS [19-23]. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes
have been shown to accumulate in AIDS patients with
HIV encephalitis along with the demonstration that brain
CD8-CTL are HIV-specific and are associated with HIV
encephalitis [24-27].
Although some studies have shown evidence in favor of
frequency and topographical distribution of HIV core protein P24 [28,29], detailed investigations with focus on
quantity, quality, topographical distribution and infiltration of macrophages, CD8+ T cells, especially in relation
to HIV, in diverse regions of the brain from patients with
and without dementia, which might elucidate entry mechanism of HIV into the CNS and explain regional involvement in the development of HAD, are seriously lacking.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/192

Therefore, we have carried out a detailed and simultaneous tracking of activation and infiltration patterns of macrophages, CD8+ T cells in relation to HIV P24 antigen in
diverse areas of the brain of HIV+ patients with and without dementia. We analyzed 53 different brain regions
from 4 HIV+ non-dementia patients and 46 regions from
patients with 2 HIV+ severely demented, rapidly progressing patients. Our study is novel in revealing the predilection of HIV movements together with cellular infiltrates of
macrophages and CD8+ T cells to the deeper mid-line and
mesial structures uniquely in patients with HAD.

Methods
Brain tissue collection and ethical issues
Brain samples were obtained from the Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia (Reference No: 5465). Clinical profiles of all patients are shown in Table 1. The autopsies
were selected from a variety of brain regions of 2 patients
with severe dementia and 4 without dementia. 46 different brain regions from patients with dementia and 53
from patients without dementia were used for this study
(Table 2). Use of samples in this study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee
of the University of Sydney and The Westmead Hospital
individually. The family members of the patients have
given written, informed consent. For the diagnostic criteria for HAD, the American Academy of Neurology 1991
criteria were used (American Academy of Neurology. Nomenclature and research case definitions for neurological manifestations of HIV type 1 infection 1: Report of a working group of
AAN of neurology and AIDS task force. 1991).
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Tissues were processed, and stained histologically and
immunohistochemically as previously described[30].
Immunofluorosecent double staining was performed
using
http://www.ihcworld.com/_protocols/
general_IHC/immunofl_double_squential.htm
the
online protocol. Antibodies CD8 and CD68 (Ventana)
were used to detect lymphocytes and macrophages, antigranzyme B antibody was used to detect CD8 CTL,
whereas P24 (1:10, DAKO) was used to detect HIVinfected cells. S100A8 was a gift from Dr. Caroline Geczy
and it was employed together with the anti-CD68 to identify the activated macrophages, since it recognizes Calgranulin A, a S100 calcium-binding protein MRP-8
(S100A8) which is only expressed in chronically activated
macrophages. HIV positive and negative inflamed tonsils
were used as positive controls for anti-P24 and anti-CD8
and CD68, respectively, while the deletion of primary
antibodies served as negative controls (see additional file
1). The numbers of the positive cells were manually
counted. All the slides were viewed at magnification ×
200. Grading standards used for validating histopatholog-

Laser-capture microscopy (LCM)
HIV-infected macrophages were identified through double staining with anti-P24/CD68 antibodies. Individual
cells were catapulted and captured with a 2-millisecond
shot of a 7.5 μm infrared diode laser beam set to 60 mV,
onto flat top 0.2 μl PCR tube using a PALM MicroBeam
system (P.A.L.M. Mikrolaser Technologie, Bernried, Germany). Tissue (6 um thickness) obtained from an average
of 1500 firings was captured.
PCR, cloning, sequence and phylogenetic analysis
The tissue sampled by LCM was heated at 95°c for 30
mins and was used in the nested PCR reaction. A 325 bp
gag-pol gene fragment was amplified. The PCR, cloning,
sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of 325 bp fragment
was performed as previously reported [31]. Both phylogenetic estimations were also repeated using bootstrap simulation of 2000 repetitions with replacements. The same
sequence alignment were ran in SplitsTree version 4 [32]
using Median Network [33] with a convex hull splits representation. The pol amino acid alignment was re-analyzed with Neighbor joining and Parsimony estimations.
The resulting phylogeny was analyzed in MacClade Version 4.08 to trace the character changes in the alignment
that were consistent in the evolutionary tree predicted.
Statistical analysis
Data were log-transformed and analyzed by t-tests and
rank correlation. General linear models with patient ID as
a random effect and location as a fixed factor were used to
assess the effect of location within patients. The software
package SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used to analyze the
data. Two-tailed tests with a significance level of 5% were
used throughout.

Results
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Region-specific HIV pathology and cellular-infiltration of
macrophages and CD8+ T cells in relation to HIV in the deeper
midline and mesial temporal structures is unique to patients with
HAD
In the 2 rare rapidly progressing dementia patients, the
histopathological examination showed severe histopathology typical of HAD[5,6] in most regions (Fig.1). In
contrast, in HIV non-dementia patients, we failed to find
similar or even comparable degree of pathological
changes to HAD patients. Notably, regional pathological
variations were observed in 2 HAD patients in the deeper
midline and mesial temporal structures, which were more
involved pathologically as compared to the cerebral lobes.
Further, neuronophagia observed was highly focal in the
left occipital lobe in case of patient A and left hippocampus for patient B (Fig.1b and 1e). Between two dementia
patients, the pathological changes in the patient A were
much more severe than in the patient B, which was consistent with severe microglial nodulation (Fig. 1c)
observed in the left temporal lobe, left basal ganglia, left
hippocampus, left cerebellum, mid brain, pons, upper

medulla, lower medulla, right frontal lobe, right temporal
lobe, right occipital lobe, and right basal ganglia, respectively, in patient A and none in patient B.
By immunohistochemistry, we first assessed the infiltration of CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells individually, followed by double staining with anti-P24 antibody
for topographical tracking and localization of these two
cell types in relation to HIV in diverse areas of the CNS
from patients with and without dementia. Extensive and
diffused presence of CD68+ cells and very mild and focal
CD8+ T cell infiltration was found in the HAD brain.
However, based on cellular infiltration of CD68+ and
CD8+ cells alone (not taking HIV into account), we could
not distinguish between patients with and without
dementia (Fig.2). Importantly, the P24 staining truly segregated patients with and without dementia, demonstrating the complete absence of P24 positive cells in 53/53
regions analyzed from all 4 HIV non-dementia patients
(Fig.2e, f, g and 2h, and see additional file 2for more
brain regions). In contrast, both HAD patients showed
the majority of CNS regions positive for P24 staining
(Fig.2a, b, c and 2d). We observed a strong positive rela-

was only found in very limited regions (4/26 in the patient A and 1/20 in the patient B). Severe microglial nodules (c) were been
observed in 12/26 regions of patient A, but the absence in the patient B. Encephalopathy (f) was identified in 5/26 regions in the

tionship between macrophages and/or CD8 and P24 positive cells by rank correlation analysis (p < 0.05), although
the co-localization of CD68+ cells with P24+ cells was
much more pronounced (Fig.2b and 2d), whereas only to
a lesser degree were CD8+ T cells and P24 antigen+ cells
were seen to be co-localizing in these two severe HAD
patients (Fig.2a and 2c).
Similar distributional trends of CD68+ macrophage and CD8+ T cell
infiltration in relation to HIV in patients with and without dementia:
statistical validation
We have employed linear models to assess the regional
influence within patients with and without dementia,
which treats patient ID as a random effect and region as a
fixed effect and these were fitted into the log (CD8),
log(CD68), log (P24) transformation data. Notably, in
both patients with dementia, the deeper midline and
mesial temporal structures of the brain (basal ganglia,
mid brain, pons, medulla, thalamus, and hippocampus,
and cerebellum) showed frequent and extensive P24 antigen positive cells (Fig.3) in comparison to other lobes and
sub-regions of the lobes, where diminishing prevalence of
P24-positivity was observed. Coincident with these findings was a parallel distributional trend of CD8+ T cells
and CD68+ macrophages among all the regions studied
from these two HAD patients (Fig.4a and 4d). This was
also consistent with our pathological findings for the two
patients. Thus, the most unique observation of our studies
is that although parallel distributional trend of cellular
infiltration of CD8+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages was
seen in both HIV non-dementia and HAD patients (Fig.4a
and 4d, b and 4e), the trend of cellular infiltration of
CD8+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages following P24
staining was unique to HAD patients. Further, our linear
model supported this unique distributional trend of P24,
CD8+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages in HAD patients
with strict predilection to the deeper midline and mesial
temporal structures (p < 0.05), which appeared to be
highly affected by selective HIV-related pathology and
viral-mediated damage of the brain tissue (Fig.4i). In
order to compare the distribution of P24 and cellular infiltration among all our patients, we combined HAD and
HIV non-dementia data, which further confirmed the
validity of our observations (Fig. 4g, h and 4i). Overall,
the complete absence of P24 in all the brain regions of
HIV non-dementia was the most discernible difference
between patients with and without dementia.
Activation of macrophage and CTL in deeper midline and mesial
temporal structures of the CNS
Anti-S100 A8 antibody was used in conjunction with the
anti-CD68 antibody to identify activated macrophages
[34-36]. Interestingly, the activated macrophages, dually
stained by S100 A8 and CD68, were mostly observed in
the deeper midline and mesial temporal structures of the
brain, especially in medulla, pons and midbrain regions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/192

while only to a lesser degree in the frontal and parietal
lobes (Fig.5). This regional distribution of activated macrophages (Fig.4f) was consistent with the distribution of
HIV infection and intense infiltration of macrophages,
especially in the deeper midline and mesial temporal
structures of the brain. In addition, the numbers of activated macrophages in HAD patients were 4.03 fold higher
than HIV non-dementia patients (p < 0.01) and the percentage of activated macrophages accounted for up to
91% of total macrophages in dementia patients, which
was higher than in HIV non-dementia patients in most
regions (Fig.6). Overall, these results strongly support that
activated macrophages alone are not enough to trigger
HAD. In fact, together the productive HIV infection of
macrophages and their localization in the deeper midline
and mesial temporal structures of the brain are vital for
neurologic manifestation of HIV disease.
Further, we used anti-granzyme B antibody to identify
CD8+ CTL. Our results confirmed the distribution trend
observed in previous result section, which is the involvement of deeper midline and mesial temporal structures of
the CNS (Fig.4c). However, the variation between 2 HAD
patients was bigger than we expected. The CTL in the
patient A in every region was significantly higher than all
4 HIV non-dementia patients. Whereas, patient B showed
only limited CTL, which was comparable to HIV nondementia patients. Interestingly, statistically significant
difference (p < 0.01) was found when we compared
patients A and B as a group against all 4 HIV non-dementia patients.
Unique nature of sequences derived from Laser-captured
macrophages from the middle part of the brain
Since HIV-infected macrophages appear to play a vital role
in HAD, multiple clones of HIV provirus (325 bp gag gene
fragment) were analyzed from catapulted macrophages
positive for P24 antigen. It showed a large deletion
(CCCCACCAG + T) in two sequences between positions
134-143, which was unique to the basal ganglia (Fig.7).
Similarly, distance-based calculation and 99% bootstrap
estimations further confirmed the uniqueness of hypothalamus-derived sequences H1, H3, H4 and H5. Both
Neighbor joining and Parsimony phylogenetic estimations at the nucleotide level identified distinct grouping of
sequences from the respective brain regions, suggesting
independent evolution of virodemes (Fig.8a). Since the
325 bp gag region analyzed in this study is an overlap
between gag and pol genes, we further analyzed the pol
gene amino acid sequences. Amino acid changes supporting region specificity were a Leu to a Ileu at amino acid
position 75, which were unique to F1-F5 sequences; and
Phe to Leu change at position 63, which grouped H1-H5
sequences from others. Other region-specific changes can
be visualized in Fig.8b.

that CD68+ macrophages co-localized with P24 (b and d) within HAD patients, whereas the co-localization of CD8 and P24 is
much less pronounced (a and c). Most infected cells were macrophages (b and d), although there were still few CD8+ T cells
infected as well. We observed noticeable CD8 (e and g) and CD68 (f and h) positive cells in HIV non-dementia patients, especially around the perivascular area, but these cells were negative for P24 antigen in all the brain regions studied for all 4 HIV
non-dementia patients.

Discussion
In this study, we have investigated cellular infiltration of
macrophages and CD8+ T cells and their activation states
in diverse areas of the brain, especially in concomitance
with HIV in order to define regional predilection of these
cell types and their possible association with neurologic
manifestation of HIV disease or HAD. Here, we provide
the first evidence showing 1. That macrophage and CD8+
T cell infiltration and their activation alone was not
enough for the development of dementia. 2. That the topographic patterns of macrophage/CD8+T cell distribution
and levels of activation in diverse areas the CNS were
comparable between patients with and without dementia.
3. That the major distinction between HAD and HIV nondementia patients was the predilection of HIV-infected
macrophages and CD8+ T cells to the deeper midline and
mesial temporal structures (thalamus, medulla, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and pons) uniquely in
HAD patients. This further correlated with HIV-related
pathology in these parts of the CNS and also with the neurological manifestation of HIV disease in both HAD
patients. Further, this distribution pattern was also consistent with the activation patterns, confirmed by S-100A8
immunohistochemical staining, which was also pronounced in the deeper midline and mesial temporal structures. Thus the preponderance of activated/infected CD8+
T cells and CD68+ macrophages in the midline and
mesial temporal structures of the brain is the feature
unique to HAD patients. In contrast, even though considerable macrophage and CD8 infiltration was observed in
diverse areas of the brain of HIV non-dementia patients,
there was complete lack of P24 antigen staining and low

level of cellular activation, which indicates either the
absence or lower than detectable level of HIV in the CNS
of HIV non-dementia patients.
It is known that HIV in the periphery and the CSF may
impair the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
which makes the BBB permeable to cellular infiltrates or
the recruitment of immune cells into the CNS [37-39].
However, the strength of the immune system and the
quality of immune cells migrating to the CNS determine
the onset of neurological manifestation of HIV disease.
Thus, the immuno-suppression of the host by HIV may
have strong bearing on the appearance of productively
infected macrophages, which was the critical feature
observed in both HAD patients examined in our study.
The actual relationship, between HIV-1 proviral load and
clinical diagnosis of HIV-associated dementia (HAD),
remains to be established. A clear determination of neuroanatomic distribution of HIV-1 proviral loads in diverse
areas of the brain (including deeper midline and mesial
temporal structures) of individuals with and without
HAD may facilitate elucidation of the relationship
between tissue proviral load and HAD, and may also
explain whether regional predilection of provirus also correlates with macrophage and CD8+ T cell infiltration and
active replication of HIV in HAD patients, as we have
observed. Taken together, our findings lead to the supposition that the predilection of HIV-infected macrophages
and CD8+ T cells to the deeper midline and mesial temporal structures (which includes the brainstem), along
with the unique architecture of proviral sequences appear

Similarity of distributional trends of CD8, CD68 and P24 in the brain
Similarity of distributional trends of CD8, CD68 and P24 in the brain. Linear models were used to assess the effect of
region within patients. We observed that the deeper midline and mesial temporal structures of the brain were much more
involved than other CNS regions as evidenced by CD8 infiltration (a), CD68 infiltration (d) along with P24 antigen (i), respectively, in HAD patients. In contrast, in HIV non-dementia patients, very similar and comparable distributional trend was found
at the level of CD8 (b) and CD68 (e) infiltration patterns, although there was complete absence of P24 antigen staining across
all the regions. When the data of CD8 and CD68 of HAD and HIV non-dementia patients were combined (g and h), not surprisingly the trends are very similar with P24 distributional trend in HAD patients. The CTL and activated macrophage results
confirm that trend again (c and f).

HIV non-dementia (patient D medulla: g, h and i; patient F medulla: j, k and l) patient. These data comply with our immuno-histochemistry staining in the deeper midline and mesial temporal structures of the brain. The CD68 staining was much more
pronounced than lobes and there are comparable levels of CD68 staining, while the S100 stained cells are significantly less in
HIV non-dementia patients.

to play a vital role in the development of dementia in HIV
patients.
These and our recently published data [30] are consistent
with previous findings showing that the infection was
most frequent in the deeper midline and mesial temporal
structures, whereas the choroids plexus (CPx) showed no
productive infection [28,40]. Further, another semi-quantitative study by Neuen-Jacob [29], which analyzed topographical distribution of HIV core antigen in relation to
macrophages showed that deep grey matter, in particular
putamen and thalamus, were involved in every case, irrespective of disease stage. It is also important to reiterate
that HIV infection may incur indirect modalities and our
data confirm the active HIV infection of the CNS being the
vital feature for neurologic manifestation. Without productive infection of macrophages in the deeper midline
and mesial temporal structures by HIV, the trigger for
HAD does not occur. Thus, our supposition for the localization of HIV-infected/activated macrophages and CD8+
T cells in the context of the development of dementia in
HIV patients is highly relevant.
Previously, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for
viral antigens have been shown to accumulate and correlate with the central nervous system dysfunction in SIV or
HIV infection [25,27]. However, studies on macaques by
Sopper [20], have shown that increased infiltration of
CD8+ cytotoxic T ymphocytes specific for viral antigens
were detected only in the CSF of slow progressors. Consistently, we observed no differences at the level of CD8+
T cell infiltration and infection in two HAD patients ana-

lyzed in our study, but much higher CTL in the patient
who died within 6 years, and very little in the patient who
died within 40 weeks. Thus, our data suggest that slow
progressors may display strong intrathecal immune
response suggesting a possible protective role or delay of
the virus-specific immunity in HIV-induced central nervous system disease, as opposed to rapidly progressing
HAD patients.
Overall, why deeper parts appear to be so much more
involved rather than the cortex proximal to the meningeal
or ventricle area? And why the whole midline and mesial
temporal parts of the brain are so severely affected histopathologically? Specific tissue vulnerability may explain
part of the puzzle, but not the underlying reasons regarding the specific topographic distribution of HIV and cellular infiltrates in HAD patients. It is known that the
brainstem disturbance can be associated with dementia
through interference with arousal systems. Pathologically,
gross examination of the brain in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) shows midbrain atrophy. Further, in PSP
neuronal loss and neurofibrillary tangles in the basal ganglia, diencephalon and brainstem have been observed.
The substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and pontine
base are typically involved, as well as the ventral anterior
and lateral thalamic nuclei. The cerebellar dentate nucleus
may show degeneration [41]. In addition, in the context
of HIV basal ganglia hyperatrophy has been shown to
often accompany mild cognitive impairment [42]. Thus,
taken together, it leads us to postulate that the productive
infection of HIV in the midline and mesial temporal structures is crucial to the occurrence of dementia in HIV

patients. We wish to reiterate that we do not imply that
dementia can exclusively be caused by brainstem disease more that it can exacerbate probably through several
mechanisms - diminished arousal and therefore attention.

Conclusion
Strong predilection of infected macrophages and CD8+ T
cells was typical of the deeper midline and mesial temporal structures uniquely in HAD patients, which has some
influence on neurocognitive impairment during HIV
infection.
