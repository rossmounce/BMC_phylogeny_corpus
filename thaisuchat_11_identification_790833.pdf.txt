Identification of a novel temperature sensitive
promoter in cho cells

Abstract
Background: The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) expression system is the leading production platform for
manufacturing biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of numerous human diseases. Efforts to optimize the
production process also include the genetic construct encoding the therapeutic gene. Here we report about the
successful identification of an endogenous highly active gene promoter obtained from CHO cells which shows
conditionally inducible gene expression at reduced temperature.
Results: Based on CHO microarray expression data abundantly transcribed genes were selected as potential
promoter candidates. The S100a6 (calcyclin) and its flanking regions were identified from a genomic CHO-K1
lambda-phage library. Computational analyses showed a predicted TSS, a TATA-box and several TFBSs within the
1.5 kb region upstream the ATG start signal. Various constructs were investigated for promoter activity at 37°C and
33°C in transient luciferase reporter gene assays. Most constructs showed expression levels even higher than the
SV40 control and on average a more than two-fold increase at lower temperature. We identified the core promoter
sequence (222 bp) comprising two SP1 sites and could show a further increase in activity by duplication of this
minimal sequence.
Conclusions: This novel CHO promoter permits conditionally high-level gene expression. Upon a shift to 33°C, a
two to three-fold increase of basal productivity (already higher than SV40 promoter) is achieved. This property is of
particular advantage for a process with reduced expression during initial cell growth followed by the production
phase at low temperature with a boost in expression. Additionally, production of toxic proteins becomes feasible,
since cell metabolism and gene expression do not directly interfere. The CHO S100a6 promoter can be
characterized as cold-shock responsive with the potential for improving process performance of mammalian
expression systems.

Background
The number of recombinant proteins used for therapeutic applications has greatly increased in recent years. For
manufacturing complex biopharmaceuticals the Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) expression system is the leading
production platform due to appropriate product secretion, post-translational processing, a simple means of
cultivation and up-scaling, a reasonable safety profile
and last but not least the approval from regulatory
authorities [1,3]. To keep pace with the needs of the
market, optimizing efforts are required, including also

upstream process development. In this context, the
genetic vector construct has to be considered since it
significantly affects productivity [4]. For production purposes recombinant genes are usually transfected into the
target cells as cDNA constructs in combination with a
mammalian active expression cassette [5]. The gene promoter is the key element and it determines the strength
and the temporal kinetics of transcription. Frequently,
constitutive viral promoters are used in mammalian
expression cassettes like the promoter/enhancer element
of the human and mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV), the
SV40 immediate early promoter or the Rous Sarcoma
Virus (RSV) long-terminal-repeat (LTR) promoter [6].
However, these strong promoters can also trigger the
undesired silencing phenomenon due to methylation of
the promoter region and part of histones [7] or

otherwise induce stress responses leading to incorrect
protein folding or even apoptosis. Another problem
relates to cell-cycle dependence of these promoters that
may cause high cell to cell variation in the amount of
recombinant protein expressed.
Due to these disadvantages, cellular promoters have
been investigated for the purpose of recombinant protein expression. The best known among those are
derived from house-keeping genes that encode abundantly transcribed cellular genes, such as beta-actin or
ribosomal proteins. A successful example of a cell specific constitutive promoter represents that of the CHOderived elongation factor-1 (CHEF-1) gene [8], where
high expression levels were observed for several genes
and different cell lines. Additional constitutive promoters that have been identified in CHO cells include the
Chinese hamster Cofilin (CHCF), the CH1433e and the
Chinese hamster 14-3-3 epsilon promoter. More
recently the rat ferritin heavy chain (HC) gene locus has
been reported by Prentice et al. [9] to be suitable for
foreign gene expression.
Compared to viral promoters, little is known about
mammalian promoters, since eukaryotic gene expression
is more complex and requires a precise coordination of
many factors for efficient gene transcription. Common
to all polymerase II promoters is a shared architecture
consisting of the core and a proximal promoter [10].
Some of the known core promoter elements are the
TATA box, the first element identified in eukaryotic
genes, the initiator element and the downstream promoter element [11]. Beside TATA-box promoters, the
majority of mammalian promoters occur as so called
CpG island promoters [12] where the methylation status
of stretches of the CG dinucleotide and their open
chromatin organization can act as a transcriptional regulator [13].
The goal of this approach is to obtain an effective
endogenous CHO promoter which can be used for the
expression of recombinant genes. Owing to its functional integrity described problems, observed with many
viral expression cassettes, can be avoided. Here we
report about the successful identification of a novel
highly active gene promoter obtained from CHO cells
that shows conditionally inducible gene expression at
reduced temperature. In this study we investigated the
full length promoter sequence and different mutant constructs in transient luciferase activity gene reporter
assays.

selected as target gene due to its high amount of mRNA
levels and its response to “cold shock” conditions in various CHO parental and recombinant cell lines. For identifying the gene in its genomic context a CHO-K1
genomic lambda-phage library (Stratagene) was screened
using a DIG-labeled cDNA probe specific for S100a6.
Approximately 6x105 clones of the library were screened
in the first round yielding only a single positive clone
which was amplified during the next round and further
enriched in the third screening step by duplicate plaque
hybridization. The DNA of the positive lambda clone
was isolated and purified. The presence, size and orientation of the genomic fragment was confirmed by PCR
using gene specific primers together with the T3 and T7
promoter primer binding to the multiple cloning site of
the lambda DNA. The results revealed the presence of
about 6 kb of the 3’ non-translated sequence of the
CHO S100a6 gene, located near the T7 site in reverse
direction. Amplification reactions by antisense S100a6
primers and T3 promoter primer failed, presumably due
to the larger genomic region at this site. The entire
insert of the lambda clone was sequenced by primer
walking (GATC). In total, 14.62 kb of CHO genomic
sequence were analyzed and found to contain 8.21 kb of
5’ upstream sequence of the S100a6 gene encoding two
other members of the S100 gene cluster (S100a4 and
S100a5), and 5.15 kb of genomic CHO sequence at the
3’ flanking region.
To map the positions of intron-exon junctions, the
CHO S100a6 genomic sequence was aligned to the corresponding locus of other mammalian species using
Align and SeqMan program. The Chinese hamster
S100a6 gene spans approximately 1.2 kb of chromosomal DNA and consists of three exons and two introns
whereof the first exon is non-translated sequence. The
organization of the CHO S100a6 gene is coherent with
the human and mouse gene [15] and is illustrated in
Figure 1. The initiating ATG codon could be identified
in the second exon at position 25 and the translation
stop signal is positioned at nucleotide (nt) 132 of exon3. Due to the conserved exon-intron architecture (Fig.
1).a phylogenetic relationship can be assumed for this
gene. CHO S100a6 coding sequence (270 bp) is 94%,
94% and 92% identical to the mouse, rat and human
sequences, respectively. In contrast, the 5’-UTR, 3’-UTR
and introns are predominantly divergent.

Results and Discussion

Promoteractive sequences are usually located within a
distance of 500 bp upstream the transcriptional start
site [16]. Here, a fragment of 1.5 kb of the 5’ non-translated sequence of the CHO S100a6 gene was investigated. Computational analysis of this region was

performed using several freely available online prediction tools for eukaryotic Pol-II promoters (FPROM and
TSSG at: http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml, and a
neural network based prediction program at: http://
www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html) to identify
putative TSS.
A putative core promoter was identified including a
TATA box that is located at position -650 to -646.
Further upstream, in close vicinity, two putative Sp1
binding sites were found at position -676 and -695. A
third Sp1 consensus sequence is located at position -320
within intron 1. Prediction of the TSS was different
between two programs used for analysis. The Neural
Network Promoter Prediction program identified two
TSS, one of which is located within intron 1 at position
-420 and the second at position -620, whereas one common TSS was found at position -621 using the FPROM
and TSSG program. Considering the possibility for alternative transcripts, position -621 (nt C in gtcCatcccc
motif) seems to be most preferentially utilized in the
CHO S100a6 gene since it is in agreement with the TSS
of the human S100a6 TSS, gccCatcccc, [17]. A preference for position -620 (nt A in sequence ccAtccc) is
consistent to the view that the Initiator (Inr) has the
consensus element YYAN(T/A)YY (the underlined position indicates the TSS) [18].
In addition a search of potential CpG islands was performed using the cpgislands searcher http://www.uscnorris.com/cpgislands2/cpg.aspx and the EMBOSS
cpgplot software http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/
cpgplot. One putative island region of 190 nts (GC content of >66% and an Observed/Expected ratio of 0.672)
extending from nts -553 to -742 relative to the ATG
start signal was predicted by the cpgislands searcher.
This is in good agreement with Emboss cpg report

3. Promoter mapping and dissection

The 1.5 kb upstream region of the CHO S100a6 gene
was examined for promoter activity using a transient
reporter gene assay. In addition, a variety of deletion
mutants were constructed by successive removal of 5’
and 3’ nts in order to identify transcription active
regions. The different promoter constructs are shown in
Fig 2.
All promoter constructs were inserted into the promoter-less basic vector pGL3-Basic (B) between the KpnIHindIII sites immediately upstream the reporter gene
firefly luciferase. As control vector the empty pGL3Basic plasmid was used to determine the background
levels in this assay. Vector pGL3-Promoter (P) that contains the Simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter and the same
vector backbone was used as positive control. Quantitative reporter assays were done in co-transfection experiments in order to standardize experimental variations
like transfection efficiency or differences in cell numbers
between samples. As a second plasmid pRL-SV40 which
encodes the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the
SV-40 promoter was co-transfected along with each promoter construct under study and the control plasmids.
Since the obtained light signal of the Renilla plasmid
usually is higher as compared to firefly luciferase, only
one tenth of the second vector was used. For measuring
the luminescence signal of both reporter proteins the
Dual-Glo assay (Promega) was used which allows a consecutive measurements of both proteins from the same
cell sample.
4. Transcriptional activity of promoter constructs in CHO
cells

The activity of 19 different promoter constructs (P3 to
ds17) including the full-length variant (Sps1) together
with the control plasmids was investigated for reporter
gene expression. Immediately after co-transfection, cells
were split and transferred to 12-well plates. One set of
plates was incubated at 37°C, the other at 33°C. 24 hrs
after transfection, aliquots of each sample were prepared
and quantitatively analyzed. The calculation of promoter
activity was done by dividing the signal from firefly luciferase by that of Renilla and after that the values were
normalized to the corresponding pGL3-P positive control samples which were set to 100%. An overview of
the activity of 19 promoter constructs plus two controls
is shown in Figure 3.
The double truncation constructs, P3 and P4, are both
lacking 449 nts immediately upstream the ATG translation start codon. The absence of this region does not

boxes at the top indicate nts-numbers. Sps-constructs comprise the entire promoter region starting with nt 1 (unsigned) and are truncated at
the 5’-side. 3’ truncations (dS) start with nt 910 and are successively shortened at their 3’ terminus. For double truncations (p3, p4), deletion (16ΔSP1), core promoter (dS18), tandem core promoter (18doub) and the reverse-orientated constructs see text. TFBS are indicated with boxes, TSS

seem to be critical for promoter functionality, since the
activity was comparable to the full-length construct
(Sps1) and other mutants (Sps2-Sps6) all of which
include these initial 449 upstream nts at their 3’ end. As
concluded from P3, the removal of nts upstream 1167
from the 5’ end did not reduce activity. Therefore a series of 5’-truncations were made to narrow the critical
promoter region. Up to construct Sps6 which includes
nts 1-763 no significant reduction was observed whereas
a dramatic loss near almost background levels was
noticed for the shorter constructs Sps7 to Sps11. Since
construct Sps5, containing 910 nts, exhibits full activity,
this 5’ end was considered critical and additional

constructs were designed by successively truncating 3’
nts (ds13-ds17). The four long constructs dS13 - dS16
showed fairly high promoter activity (except construct
dS15) and even the shortest, dS16, comprising only 332
nts reached similar expression levels compared to the
full-length promoter sequence. Only dS17 which
encodes 260 nts fell below 30 percent of the top constructs and below 50 percent of the SV40 expression
value. This clearly indicates that missing nts between
dS17 and dS16 are important for promoter activity
although their absence does not completely diminish the
functionality. A closer look at this sequence reveals the
presence of the predicted CpG island (-747 to -577) that

overlaps the predicted TSS and a TATA-box occurring
in this region. Constructs dS16 and dS17 were designed
to investigate the effect of regulatory elements. Common
to both constructs is the presence of two SP1 transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) at positions 671-676
and 690-695, but dS17 lacks the TATA-box and the
predicted TSS at 620/621. This may explain the drop in
activity observed in the shortest construct. Further we
investigated the effect on transcription by deleting one
of the SP1 sites. Construct Sps6 which encodes nts 1 to
763 including both SP1 sites, showed 80-90% expression
strength of the control vector. In contrast, Sps7 which
encodes only nts 1 to 683 and lacks one essential SP1
binding side, completely lost promoter functionality.
According to these results the core promoter sequence
including both TFBS and the predicted transcription
start site is located in exon-1 which overlaps with the
putative CpG-island.
Promoter analyses under hypothermic conditions
revealed even higher activity for all tested variants. In
general, reduced temperature caused a boost in expression of about 200% on average (Figure 3). At 33°C, three
of the 5’ deletion constructs Sps4, Sps5 and Sps6
showed a substantial enhancement in reporter gene
expression of more than 2-fold when compared to the
corresponding samples of 37°C and more than 3-fold of

the SV40 control vector under temperature shift conditions. Sps4 and Sps5 showed the strongest response to
temperature change and the other 5’ truncation constructs, Sps1, Sps2 and Sps3 could be activated >2-fold
upon a shift to 33°C.
With length decreasing a reduction in temperature
response was observed; see dS13-dS16 and P3 and P4.
These mutants lack up to 578 nts in the 3’ region which
seems to contribute to this lower temperature sensitivity
since expression levels were found to range between 1.5
to 1.8-fold of the control values at 37°C under these
experimental conditions. We observed that reporter
gene expression of all promoter variants is strictly time
dependent and rapidly increasing over time. Whether
this is caused by the accumulation of the reporter protein in the cell remains to be examined. Consequently,
all measurements were done exactly 24 hours after
transfection of the cells. Remarkably, the ratio of expression levels between the SV40 control and the constructs
under study stayed constant up to a sampling time of 48
hours in the temperature shift experiments.
5. The core promoter sequence

Our next aim was to further minimize the promoter and
characterize more precisely its functional elements. Concluding from our results we identified sequence

elements upstream 579 (e.g. dS16: 579-910) essential for
full promoter activity. Truncations at the 5’-site as far as
position 910 (dS13-dS16, Sps5) did not result in diminished activity. Even in construct Sps6, with all nucleotides deleted upstream position 763, indeed a decrease
but no loss of expression was detected resulting in a
slightly lower activity than the SV40 control. According
to these findings, we designed a new “minimal” construct, dS18, which extends from nts 579 to 800. The 5’end position 800 was chosen, since a putative NF-ĸB
binding site (771-780) was included. This site is conserved among Chinese hamster, mouse and rat (Figure
4) and its involvement in the regulation of the human
S100A6 gene expression was studied by Joo et al. [19].
Also the two SP1 sites and the TATA box motifs are
present in the promoter region of the other two species.
In our study we directly compared dS18 (222 nts) and
dS16 (332), the so far smallest construct with full promoter activity. Its activity was found equal to dS16, the
initially identified minimal promoter. The results of this
paragraph are summarized in Figure 5. The NF-ĸB binding site seems to be necessary for full promoter function
since lacking of this site in Sps6 (1-763) results in
decreased activity down to a level of 65% as compared
to Sps5 (1-910).
Several cis-acting elements can also be important for
reverse-oriented transcription except for the original
TATA box. The GC box has been reported to exhibit
such reverse function and some mammalian promoters
have been identified to show antisense activity, e. g.
murine Dfna5 [20]. Thus the function of S100a6 core
promoter in inverse orientation was also tested. We
designed the inverse constructs dS18-rev and dS16-rev
to determine if transcription can be initiated in this configuration. Both showed low but detectable activity of
about 20% of theirs original sequence. This activity was
similar to the level of the SP1 deletion construct 16ΔSP1 (see below).
In order the study the function of SP1 sites, both were
deleted from construct dS16 generating 16-ΔSP1 (579-

658, 721-910) leaving only the TATA-box intact. Lacking of only 64 bp, including two putative SP1 sites, dramatically decreased promoter function to about 20%
indicating that both conserved SP1 sites are essential for
functioning of the S100a6 promoter. This observation is
relevant to the view that the SP1 site, a GC hexanucleotide, is sufficient for SV40 promoter activity and frequently appears as multiple copies.
Several studies have investigated the effect of promoter duplication on homologous and heterologous gene
expression. It was shown that a second copy of the promoter or at least its essential regions can function like
cis-acting enhancer elements. This strategy has been
evolutionally developed by eukaryotic viruses in order to
enhance the synthesis of their RNA genome [21]. For
biotechnological applications it is important to achieve
high and reliable expression levels. In an attempt to
enhance transgene expression, the effect of adding extra
TFBS by duplicating parts of the promoter region while
maintaining the spatial arrangement was analysed by
Pena and Whitelaw [22]. For the purpose of such a use
we generated construct 18-doub, having two consecutively repeated core promoter sequences (2 × 222 bp) to
test for increased activity. We observed that this tandem
repeat stimulates transcription more effectively (1.4 fold
of dS18) than a single element, and the distance of the
SP1 site(s) from the TATA box may have some
influence.

activity by quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR

results obtained by luciferase reporter gene expression

studies of different constructs in temperature shift
experiments. Measured protein levels at standard (37°C)
and reduced temperature (33°C) were compared to specific mRNA levels of two representative promoter constructs, namely the full-length construct (Sps1) encoding
1505 nts immediately upstream the ATG and the 222
nts core promoter sequence (dS18). The same constructs were assayed in parallel for Luciferase protein
expression at both temperatures. Figure 6 depicts the
fold-change values of mRNA and protein levels at 33°C
compared to 37°C for the two promoter variants at 24
hours post transfection.
7. The role of mRNA stability in regard to transcript
abundance of the S100a6 gene at low temperature

Insearch of a possible mechanism for enhanced mRNA
levels upon lowering temperature we compared the
structural and functional properties of the S100a6 gene
to well characterized mammalian cold shock proteins
(CSPs), namely the cold-inducible RNA binding protein
(CIRP) [23] and RNA binding motif protein 3 (Rbm3)
[24]. They have been recognized as regulators of gene
expression by acting as RNA chaperones through binding of misfolded RNA thereby preventing transcription
termination [25]. Their expression is modulated by
alternative mRNAs with IRES-like activity that increases
translation [26]. The 5’-UTR of CHO S100a6 gene was
therefore searched by a web-based IRES secondary
structure prediction tool [27]http://polya.umdnj.edu/
polya_svm, but no IRES-like structure could be predicted, whereas three potential cap-independent translation initiation sites where found in the 5’-UTR of the
human CIRP gene (GenBank: D78134) that served as
control. Thus, the CHO S100a6 gene does not seem to
have structural similarity to the CSP’s 5’-UTR and we

assume another regulatory mechanism. Another structural feature of CSPs is the presence of widely conserved
binding domains (anti-parallel ß-strands) that accounts
for affinity to single stranded RNA and DNA. Appar.
ntly, the S100a6 protein lacks such motifs as well as the
ability to attach to RNA/DNA. It rather interacts with
many biological targets via protein-protein binding.
In addition, we did a comparative literature search for
the regulatory and functional features of the human
S100a6 ortholog with a focus on the gene promoter and
various stimuli that have been identified to upregulate
its expression. These include growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, hormones and tumor inducing agents
[28]. Upon stress conditions such as ischemia, mechanical force, irradiation or oxidative stress the S100A6 gene
promoter is activated at the transcriptional level by
upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and NF-ĸB [29]. USF
binds to the E-box response element, a hexanucleotide
motif that is also present in the CHO S100a6 gene promoter at almost the same position: E-box CHO: -273/268; human: -283/-278 upstream the transcription start
site. Recent data provide evidence that USF may be
another stress responsive transcription factor activated
by UV and osmotic shock, heat-shock and cadmium
[30].
Since upregulation of the S100a6 gene, induced by
stress or other stimuli, is primarily based on transcriptional control we conclude that cold shock stress in
our experiments predominantly triggers a transcriptional response. To test as to whether RNA turnover is
also involved in regulation we measured mRNA stability of the promoter constructs at lower (33°C) and
standard culture temperature. For that purpose the
full-length promoter construct (Sps1) was selected.
The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D was added
to the culture and the level of the target mRNA was
determined at several time points by quantitative RTPCR. This allows calculating mRNA decay and the corresponding half-live. As internal control b-actin was
selected as reference since its mRNA expression is
considered not to be affected by lowering culture temperature [31]. Due to the short lived nature of mRNA
we followed its concentration during 6 hours after
inhibiting transcription. At each time point mRNA
levels of the reporter gene ß-actin stayed remarkably
constant. Also, mRNA levels of the promoter construct
did not differ significantly after the first 4 hours at
both temperatures. However, 6 hours after actinomycin
D treatment a decay of about 33% was detected at 37°
C, whereas in the parallel test culture at 33°C mRNA
only decreased about 5% (Figure 7). This observation
indicates that mRNA stability is enhanced by lowering
culture temperature which also contributes to higher
mRNA levels.

as compared to 5% at 33°C. The columns show the ratio of
transcript abundance (33°C-value is set to 100%) that was detected

Conclusions
The identification of the CHO S100a6 promoter
sequence was based on the analysis of microarray transcriptomics data described by [14]. Due to sparse genomic resources that are publicly available for the Chinese
hamster we took a conventional approach for target identification by screening a CHO-K1 genomic lambda phage
library. The isolated positive phage clone comprises a
fragment of 14,6 kb genomic CHO DNA encoding the
S100 gene locus including family members a4, a5 and a6.
The CHO S100a6 gene consists of three exons and two
introns, and its coding sequence is highly conserved
between mouse, rat and human. According to computational analysis, a sequence region of 1,505 bp upstream
of ATG start codon was termed as full-length promoter
and tested together with a number of promoter variants
in functional promoter assays. A core promoter region of
only 222 bp could be identified revealing almost similar
activity than the full-length construct. Several regulatory
elements were identified as essential factors to allow for
full promoter function. A drop in activity was observed
when either the TATA-box or the NF-ĸB binding site
was absent. Also the lack of two SP1 binding sites in the
core promoter region caused a drastic reduction in activity. On the other hand, functional activity of the “minimal” promoter could be considerably enhanced when
two tandem repeats were joined together. Considering
additional aspects beside transcriptional upregulation of
the S100a6 gene we could also identify mRNA stability
that contributes to transcript abundance at lower
temperature.
In addition, the CHO S100a6 promoter shows conditionally inducible gene expression at reduced temperature

resulting in two- to three-fold increase in gene expression
compared to basal activity at standard temperature. This
temperature dependent activity can be advantageous to
reduce expression during the initial growth phase and at
later production phase it allows to boost expression of the
recombinant gene. It is particularly valuable that this
increase of productivity is achieved at low temperature
culturing conditions which normally reduces overall cell
metabolism of competitive processes but obviously not the
expression of the gene of interest. Another benefit is the
potential for the manufacturing of toxic products since
gene expression and cell metabolism do not negatively
interfere as compared to conventional mammalian production technology.
The area of improving recombinant protein production by the use of reduced temperature cultivation has
been documented by several investigators [32,38].
Although lowering the culture temperature often
increases specific productivity, its effect on productivity
is variable among CHO cell lines [39] and there are conflicting reports in the literature. Al-Fageeh et al. [37]
suggested optimization of cell growth at 37°C followed
by a “cold-shock” but contradictorily it has been demonstrated that adaptation of CHO cells to low culture temperatures can enhance specific growth rates whereas
recombinant protein production decreases [40].
In case of the S100a6 promoter, increased activity after
“cold shock” treatment does not result from prolonged
generation time like in batch cultures or effects that can
be attributed to reduced cell metabolism since we determined expression levels shortly after transient transfections. Higher productivity is directly connected to
increased specific mRNA transcription rate which we
observed for parental and recombinant cell lines, including also CHO-K1. The use of this promoter for high level
protein expression under hypothermic condition therefore demonstrates an attractive alternative in production
techniques since it combines both, a novel genetic construct that is directly linked to the individual process
conditions with the potential for improving the performance also for other mammalian expression systems.

Methods
Cell culture, growth media and cultivation

Dihydrofolate-reductase deficient CHO cells (ATCC,
Rockville, MD, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (DMEM) and Ham’s F-12 medium
mixed 1:1, supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.1%
(w/v) pluronic, 0.25% (w/v) soya-peptone, 13.60 mg/l of
hypoxanthine and 3.88 mg/l of thymidine, at 37°C under
7% CO2. The cells were routinely passaged twice a week
(1:6) at a starting density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in a spinner
flask and used for transient transfection assays at the
amount of 4 × 106 cells per sample.

Plaque lifts

Generation of promoter constructs

For one dish (145 mm) that was used for screening and
plaque hybridization, fresh Escherichia coli XL1-Blue
MRA (P2) (600 μl of OD600 = 0.5 cells diluted with 10
mM MgSO4) were infected with 10 μl of 50,000 plaqueforming units for 20 minutes at 37°C. Then 7 ml of
NZY top agar at ~50°C were added, mixed and spread
onto a prewarmed (37°C) NZY agar plate. The plaques
became visible after 8 hours incubation at 37°C. After
plaque formation, the culture dishes were stored at least
2 hours at 4°C, blotted on nylon membrane (Roche),
denatured and neutralized. The step from preparing the
plating cultures and performing the plaque lifts were
done according to the instruction manual for Lambda

Hybridization and detection

Before hybridization, the DNA was fixed to the nylon
membrane by baking at 80°C for 2 hours. Pre-hybridization (39°C for 1 hour) and hybridization (39°C for overnight) were performed in the same solution, standard
buffer (5x SSC, 0.1% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% (w/
v) SDS and 1% blocking reagent). 10 ml buffer containing 10 μl of DIG-labeled probe were used for hybridization for one nylon membrane. Membranes were washed
twice with low stringency wash buffer (2x SSC, 0.1%
SDS) at room temperature followed by high stringency
wash buffer (0.5x SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 65°C. After washing
and blocking, the antibody solution (1:10,000 diluted
Anti-Digoxigenin-AP (Roche) in blocking solution) was
added to the membrane. Membranes were washed,

A reverse-oriented construct of dS16 (16-rev) was
generated by cloning of the fragment amplified with the
use of primers HindIII(-910)B and KpnI(-579)F into the
pGL3-Basic vector. The minimal promoter construct,
dS18, was generated by removing a 110 bp upstream
region from dS16, using primers KpnI(-800)B and (-579)
F for PCR amplification. Construct 18-rev was generated
by PCR with primers HindIII(-800)B and KpnI(-579)F,
followed by cloning into the vector in reverse orientation. Construct 18double, consisting of two tandem
repeats of the core promoter sequence (dS18), was generated by amplifying two copies of the core sequence,
one with KpnI(-800)B and XhoI(-589)F and the second
with XhoI(-791)B and (-579)F. The products of these
PCRs were cut with corresponding enzymes and subsequently ligated together.
All fragments were cloned into pGL3-Basic at KpnIHindIII sites and sequenced.
The PCR reactions for the constructs were performed
in a reaction volume of 25 μl containing 1 ng of lambda
DNA as template, 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, 0.4 μM of
each primer and 1 unit of KOD Hifi DNA polymerase
(Novagen) at the following cycling conditions: 95°C 2
min, 30 cycles 98°C 15 s, 58°C 5s and 72°C 20s, final
extension at 72°C 5 min. Amplifications for constructs
P3 and P4 were performed in 50 μl containing the same
amount of template DNA and dNTPs as above, 0.5 μM
of each primer and 1 unit of Phusion DNA polymerase
(Finnzymes). PCR cycles were: 98°C 2 min, 30 cycles of
98°C 10 s, 60°C 15 s and 72°C 45 s and a final extension
at 72°C for 7 min.
Transient transfection assay

The constructs were co-transfected along with the
Renilla luciferase reporter vector pRL-SV40 into CHO
dhfr - by using Amaxa’s Necleofector (Lonza). 4 × 106
cells were transferred to a 15 ml tube and centrifuged at
1000 rpm 10 min and resuspended with the nucleofection mixture containing 10 μg of plasmid DNA, 1 μg of
pRL-SV40 in 100 μl of NucleofectorTM solution and
subjected to electroporation. Subsequently, the cells
were transferred into a pre-warmed culture medium in
6-well plates and incubated at 33°C and 37°C. The luciferase activities were measured on a Biotek Synergy 2
luminometer (Gen5 software) by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) preferentially after
24 hours. To normalize for transfection efficiency, the
promoter activity of each construct was expressed as the
ratio of firefly luciferase activity relative to Renilla

luciferase activity. pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Promoter were
used as negative and positive controls, respectively.
Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR

Total RNA was extracted from 4 × 106 cells transfected
with the promoter constructs, using the TRIZOL
reagent, following the instructions for RNA isolation
(Invitrogen TM, Life technologies). The yield and purity
of the isolated RNA were determined by measuring the
absorbance at 230, 260 and 280 nm using an ND-1000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, DE). The
Eukaryote total RNA Nano assay together with Agilent’s
2100 bioanalyzer were used for quality control of the
isolated RNA according to the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (5065-4476) standard protocol. First-strand
cDNA synthesis of 1.5 μg total RNA was performed
with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA served as template for
quantitative real-time PCR reactions (1 cycle at 95°C, 2
min; 40 cycles at 95°C, 15 s; 60°C, 60 s) with the RotorGene Q Real-Time PCR cycler (Quiagen). GoTaq qPCR
Master Mix (Promega) was used in combination with
the primers listed below and the corresponding cDNA
template. For relative quantification of the mRNA levels
of the samples the Rotor gene 6000 software and the 2ΔΔC T comparative method [42] were used.

Measurement of mRNA stability

The mRNA stability of the Luciferase reporter gene normalized to the b-actin reference gene was determined
via quantitative real-time PCR after blocking of new
RNA synthesis by addition of actinomycin D at a final
concentration of 5 μg/ml. Following actinomycin D
treatment, 4 × 106 cells were harvested at designated
time points (0 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h) and total RNA was
prepared and reverse transcribed into cDNA as
described in section “Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR”.
The fold change in Luc mRNA level is indicated as percentage mRNA decay. The mRNA level at time point
zero (before treatment with actinomycin D) was considered as 100%.
