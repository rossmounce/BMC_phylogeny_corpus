Abstract

interactions

Results: The human genome was queried and 3,664 candidate PPs were identified. The most
abundant were copies of genes encoding keratin 18, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
and ribosomal protein L21. A simple method was developed to estimate the level of nucleotide
substitutions (and therefore the age) of PPs. A Poisson-like age distribution was obtained with a
mean age close to that of the Alu repeats, the predominant human short interspersed elements.
These data suggest a nearly simultaneous burst of PP and Alu formation in the genomes of ancestral
primates. The peak period of amplification of these two distinct retrotransposons was estimated
to be 40-50 million years ago. Concordant amplification of certain L1 subfamilies with PPs and Alus
was observed.

Background: Abundant pseudogenes are a feature of mammalian genomes. Processed
pseudogenes (PPs) are reverse transcribed from mRNAs. Recent molecular biological studies show
that mammalian long interspersed element 1 (L1)-encoded proteins may have been involved in PP
reverse transcription. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of human PPs using all
known human genes as queries.

Conclusions: We suggest that a burst of formation of PPs and Alus occurred in the genome of
ancestral primates. One possible mechanism is that proteins encoded by members of particular L1
subfamilies acquired an enhanced ability to recognize cytosolic RNAs in trans.

The abundance of pseudogenes is a remarkable feature of
mammalian genomes. Aptly named, pseudogenes are copies
of specific genes and are present in every mammalian

chromosome [1-5]. In general, pseudogenes are thought to be
nonfunctional [2] as they have accumulated vast numbers of
mutations during evolution and have lost the ability to be
transcribed. Pseudogenes fall into two distinct categories

depending on the mechanism by which they are generated:
processed pseudogenes (PPs) are reverse transcribed from
mRNAs (and thus do not contain introns) whereas nonprocessed pseudogenes arise from duplications of genomic DNA
[2,4]. Among the abundant PPs, there are a substantial
number of 'processed genes' or 'retrogenes' of novel function
that also derive from mRNAs of various intron-containing
genes [6-8].
In addition to PPs, mammalian genomes contain a large
number of retrotransposons (retroposons) that represent a
reverse flow of genetic information via RNA [9-13]. In
humans, short interspersed elements (SINEs) and long interspersed elements (LINEs) occupy over 30% of the genome
[14]. Progress in LINE1 (L1) molecular biology has enabled L1
'retrotransposition' studies in cultured HeLa cells [15,16].
Recent work [17-21] shows that mammalian L1-encoded proteins may have been involved in the reverse transcription of
PP and Alu [22-26]. Furthermore, L1-encoded proteins predominantly mobilize the RNA in which they are encoded
[18,19]. This so-called 'cis preference' explains the fact that,
among the overwhelming number of nonfunctional L1 RNAs,
recent mutagenic L1 insertions in humans and mice are
derived from a progenitor L1 RNA that contained intact open
reading frames (ORFs) [16]. In fact, Moran's group estimated
that a functional L1 mobilizes nonfunctional L1 RNAs and
other cellular mRNAs in trans at frequencies of only 0.2%0.9% and 0.01%-0.05%, respectively, relative to processes
involving cis RNA [19]. This finding also raised the question
of how human Alu repeats could have been amplified in trans
to their present level of approximately 10% of the human
genome, given that L1-encoded proteins preferentially mobilize their own transcripts. Boeke proposed that Alu RNA secondary structure could have positioned this RNA on the
ribosome in a manner that promoted effective interactions
with L1-encoded proteins [21,27].
The initial analysis of the human genome draft sequence by
the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium
provided the first comprehensive view of retroposons such as
LINEs and SINEs, although the description of PPs was largely
ignored [14]. The Celera report briefly described a preliminary analysis of PPs [28]. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of human PPs using all known human genes
as queries. These PPs were derived from 6% of all annotated
human genes, and our data suggest a possible burst of PP genesis early in primate evolution.

Results
Whole-genome screening for human PPs and their
content
We initially searched for PPs that exhibit sequence similarity
to any of the transcripts from the 21,921 genes annotated by
the Ensembl project [29]. The fact that PPs contain few if any
introns enabled our search to generate 3,664 PP candidates

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/11/R74

(Table 1 and Additional data file 1; pseudogenes generated by
DNA duplication contained many introns and were eliminated). These candidate PPs represented a minimum set
because not all human genes have yet been annotated [30]
and the search included only those PPs whose length is more
than 90% of the respective mRNA. If the estimated 35,000
human genes [14,28] had been used in the search and shorter
PPs included in the analysis, over 7,000 PPs would have been
expected.
Parental genes of human PPs are of various types, including
those for enzymes, structural proteins and regulatory proteins such as ligand-binding proteins and transcription factors (Table 1). Of the total PPs analyzed, the relative
frequency of those derived from genes encoding enzymes,
structural proteins and ligand-binding proteins was 19%,
34%, and 9% (Figure 1b), respectively, whereas the PP parental genes for structural proteins constituted only 9% of the
total parental genes (Figure 1a). Among 1,299 parental genes
identified in this study, kinases, ribosomal proteins and ligand-binding proteins were predominant.
Table 2 shows a compilation of the abundant PPs in the
human genome (see Additional data file 2). The three most
abundant types of human PPs were derived from the genes for
keratin 18, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPD) and ribosomal protein L21 (RP L21). These genes
generated at least 52, 43 and 38 copies of PPs, respectively, in
the genome. Keratin 18 is commonly expressed in internal
epithelia and is one of the earliest intermediate filament proteins expressed during embryogenesis [31]. The genes for
GAPD and ribosomal proteins are housekeeping genes. These
data suggest that mRNAs for keratin 18, GAPD and RPL21
were highly expressed or stable in either the germline cells or
at an early stage of development, as heritable copies of these
genes must have been reverse transcribed in one of those two
instances.
As shown in Figure 1a and 1b, structural-protein PPs constitute the largest class (34%). The 50 most prolific PP parental
genes include 25 ribosomal protein genes (Table 2) which
contribute substantially to the high incidence of structural
proteins among the total number of PPs presented in Figure
1b.

GC content in PP parental genes
Human PPs are derived from mRNAs that exhibit a wide
range of GC content. We examined the possible relationship
between the number of PPs derived from a gene and the GC
content of its mRNA (Figure 2). The rates of PP generation
from parental genes within each GC group show no significant statistical difference except for genes of high GC content
(> 0.62). This result differs from that of a previous study in
which an inverse correlation between the number of ribosomal protein PPs and the GC content of the parental genes
was observed [32]. Because we analyzed a wide variety of PPs,

The 3,664 PP candidates are distributed throughout all 24
chromosomes and were derived from genes on various chromosomes (Table 3 and Figure 3). No stringent bias of gene
'projections' (that is the insertion of the PP of a gene in a specific chromosomal location) toward specific chromosomes
was observed. In some chromosomes, however, (for example
chromosome 19), the ratios of self-projection are relatively
high. Interestingly, the PP density within each chromosome
roughly parallels gene density (Figure 4). For example, chromosomes that are gene-rich, such as 19, 17 and 11 [14,28],
tend to be relatively PP-rich. On the other hand, chromosomes that are gene-poor, such as Y, 21, 13 and 4 [14,28], tend
to also be poor in PPs. As human gene density shows strong
positive correlation with local GC content [14,28], this result
suggests that the integration of PPs into chromosomes in general may be dependent on aspects of the genomic environment that are strictly related to chromosomal gene density
[14,28], such as local GC content and an open chromatin
structure that facilitates transcription.

A simple method for estimating the level of nucleotide
substitutions in PPs
To approximate the age of each PP, we developed a method
for estimating the level of nucleotide substitutions relative to
the parental gene. Initially, this method corrected for the
sequence divergence value (a consequence of nucleotide-substitution processes) by removing the contribution of

including those of ribosomal protein genes, the correlation
observed in this previous study probably reflects a specific
correlation between GC content and either expression level or
stability of ribosomal protein mRNAs.

Next, the quantity Σ (=µT) was corrected for multiple substitutions at the same site using the Jukes-Cantor model [34],
giving the average number of substitutions per 100 base-pairs
(bp), (K). For PPs, sequence divergences were defined as the
mismatch rates of respective PPs relative to the current
parental gene sequences. Finally, the levels of substitution
that accumulated only in PPs were estimated (see Materials
and methods). The estimated levels of substitutions in PPs
(K(ψ)) were then calculated as K(ψ) = 0.705 K.

Classifications of the PPs. Gene classes were based on the functional
annotation of the NCBI Reference Sequence collection [61] for the

proteins, zinc finger protein, ring finger proteins, nuclear
ribonucleoproteins and splicing factors were classified as 'Ligand binding'.

mutations at CpG sites. The C-to-T transition rate in CpG
pairs is around 12-fold higher than the rate for other transitions [33] and causes distortions when comparing different
genomic elements of high (for example, Alus) or low (for
example, L1s) CpG content. Assuming that CpG frequency (ι)
in a genomic element that was generated by duplication of a
functional gene of high CpG content decreases over time (t)
and reaches a state of equilibrium (ε) (approximately 20% of
the frequency [14,33] expected from the local fraction of
cytosines and guanosines [14]), the time since the duplication
(T) was calculated (see Materials and methods) from the
given sequence divergence (D) and the neutral mutation rate
(µ) of primates:
D = ∫0Tµ(1 + 11((ι - ε)/((0.01ι/(0.99ι-ε))t + 1) + ε))dt

Using the levels of nucleotide substitution in PPs estimated
by K(ψ), we next evaluated the total number of PPs having the
same substitution value, thus approximating the age distribution of PPs. We initially presumed that if PPs were generated
at a roughly constant rate during primate evolution, their age
distribution would be nearly flat. Surprisingly, a Poisson-like
distribution was obtained (Figure 5a). This result indicates
that PPs in general may have been generated at extraordinarily high rates during some periods. If the rate of nucleotide
substitution is assumed to be 1.5 × 10-9 per nucleotide per year
[34,35], then our data estimate that the peak of PP generation
occurred approximately 40 million years ago, coincident with
the onset of the radiation of the higher primates [36,37].
The above results are reminiscent of the amplification profile
of Alu repeats. Alu elements comprise approximately 10% of
the human genome [14] and are restricted to primates [2226]. It has been proposed that the average age of Alu repeats
is around 40 million years and that the majority of Alus were
generated around this time [14,22,23,26]. We confirmed
these previous results by re-estimating the age distribution of
all human Alu repeats (Figure 5b). The Alus also showed a
Poisson-like distribution with a sharp peak. Alus are classified into distinct subfamilies that can be identified on the
basis of mutations shared among subfamily members
[23,26]. Alu subfamilies were derived from a small number of
source or master genes. Accordingly, a consensus sequence
constructed from members of each subfamily represents each
subfamily's source gene(s) [23,26]. To evaluate the contribution of each subfamily to the entire distribution of Alus, we
estimated the age distribution of respective Alu subfamilies
(Figure 5c). The peaks for respective subfamilies are grouped
closely, and the subfamily Alu Sx strongly influences the
overall distribution of Alus (compare with Figure 5b). Therefore, the Sx subfamily (and thus Alus in general) appears to
have been amplified intensively over a relatively short period.
To the best of our knowledge, many previous discussions of
Alu amplification reflect this viewpoint of Alu evolution
[14,22,23,26]. However, our results show that the intensive
generation of two distinct elements, PPs and Alus, occurred
almost simultaneously suggesting that an unknown change in
either the cellular environment or the proliferation mechanism itself enhanced the proliferation of such retroposons in
ancestral primates 40-50 million years ago.

Number of PPs/gene

Recent progress in L1 biology shows that mammalian L1encoded proteins are likely to have been involved in the
reverse transcription of Alus and PPs [17-21]. To elucidate the
cause of the elevated retrotransposition of PPs and Alus, we
analyzed the age distribution of all human L1s (Figure 5d).
Curiously, the rate of amplification (retrotransposition in
cells and fixation within a population) of L1s does not peak
around 7%, as was the case for PPs and Alus (compare with
Figure 5a,b), raising the issue of how the rate of PP/Alu retrotransposition became elevated during a period of moderate
change in L1 retrotransposition. To address this problem, L1s
were divided into around 80 subfamilies [38], and age distributions for representative subfamilies are shown in Figure 5e.
Although the distributions of respective subfamilies overlap,
each subfamily has emerged successively during approximately 150 million years of mammalian evolution. Merging
the distribution profiles of all the L1s yields a curve that is
rather flat (almost equal to the curve that connects the apices
of the respective bars in Figure 5d). Among a large number of
L1 subfamilies, certain subfamilies, namely L1PA6, L1PA7
and L1PA8, were amplified intensively around 47 million
years ago (the time corresponding to the 7% score). These
data suggest that only one or a few L1 subfamilies may have
contributed to the increased level of Alu and PP amplification
(see Discussion).

(cysteine)-rich domain') that result in altered residue polarity
or charge (Figure 6). A key example is the highly variable
amino-terminal half of the L1-encoded ORF1 protein, which
contains residues that may be critical for interaction with
other proteins [39]. There is 41% (54/131) amino-acid divergence between the ORF1 amino-terminal halves of L1PA7 and
L1Hs whereas the divergence is only 7% (14/207) in the carboxy-terminal half (data not shown).

Discussion
Possible mechanisms of a 'retrotranspositional
explosion'

Genome Biology 2003, 4:R74

information

Regarding the cause of the retrotranspositional explosion, it
is worth considering the effect of a 'bottleneck' [34,41] during
primate evolution. Only individuals that experienced extensive genomic retrotransposition might have propagated to
become a majority within a population of ancestral primates,
via a mechanism involving a rapid reduction in the general
population. Studies on the molecular phylogeny and demographic history of humans show, however, that the primate
lineage leading to humans never experienced an extensive
bottleneck, at least since its divergence from the prosimian

interactions

A recent extensive survey of the human genome revealed a
large number of ribosomal protein pseudogenes derived from
the 79 functional ribosomal protein genes [32]. The discussion of the ages of these pseudogenes is problematic, however, in that ages were calculated by simply dividing sequence
divergences by mutation rate. As the sequence divergence of
a PP relative to its parental gene (K) is dependent on
substitutions in both the PP (K(ψ)) and the gene (K(f)) (see
Materials and methods), the ages of the ribosomal protein
pseudogenes were overestimated. For example, with respect
to RPL21 mRNAs (the most predominant source of ribosomal
protein pseudogenes in humans), the sequence divergence
between human and mouse or rat is approximately 11%
(NM_000982, NM_019647, NM_053330, and [40]). The
previous ribosomal protein pseudogene calculations dismissed sequence divergences between the present-day and

primordial genes, probably overestimating the ages by
around 10 million years (a few percent per 8-10% of divergence). Therefore, it is difficult to compare such values with
the ages of Alus/L1s. Our method provides a clear solution to
this matter, enabling us to compare the ages of different
classes of retroposons. Hence, our method led us to the finding that there was a simultaneous burst of PPs and Alus - a
'retrotranspositional explosion' - in the primate genome.

lineage [42]. Therefore, the effect of a bottleneck can be
largely ignored.
The retrotranspositional explosion could be due to a change
in the cellular environment of ancestral primates 40-50 million years ago, such as a higher transcriptional potential of
parental (master) genes of PPs and Alus. A specific
environment of the genome during the period of the retrotranspositional explosion, such as more available target sites
of PPs and Alus, might have facilitated this event. Alternatively, a change in the proliferation mechanism of PPs and
Alus, such as an increased amount of reverse transcriptase or
an enhanced activity of enzymes for retrotransposition, might
have promoted the explosion.
Recent studies on the L1 retrotransposons show that mammalian L1-encoded proteins may have been involved in the
reverse transcription of Alus and PPs [17-21]. Here, we have
shown that the intensive amplification of distinct genetic elements, namely PPs and Alus, seems to have occurred almost
simultaneously around 40-50 million years ago, and suggests
that only one or a few L1 subfamilies may have contributed to
the observed high levels of Alu/PP retrotransposition.
How could a specific L1 subfamily (or subfamilies) have generated Alus and PPs at such an accelerated rate? We propose

that L1s within specific subfamilies mobilized RNAs in trans
at accelerated rates in ancestral primate genomes. Thus, a
specific L1 subfamily may have mediated the Alu/PP retrotranspositional explosion. The age distributions estimated in
this study allow the prediction of the most probable L1 subfamilies responsible for the explosion (care must be exercised
when comparing ages between distinct genetic elements; see
Materials and methods). The most probable candidate subfamilies are L1PA6, L1PA7 and L1PA8 (Figure 5e). As mentioned above, although the youngest L1 subfamily mobilizes
cellular RNAs in trans at very low frequencies (0.01-0.05%)
in HeLa cells, the frequency is not necessarily intrinsic to L1s.
In fact, in cultured feline cells the frequency of L1-mediated
PP formation in trans is 5% relative to that of L1 retrotransposition in cis [18]. Moreover, an eel LINE family exhibits a
high level of trans retrotransposition (up to 30% [43]), and
the frequency of L1-mediated Alu retrotransposition in HeLa
cells is 100-1,000 times higher than control mRNAs [21].
Although L1 subfamilies such as L1PA6, L1PA7 and L1PA8
appear to have been extinguished by cumulative mutations,
the possibility that an ancient L1 subfamily exhibited an
enhanced ability to mobilize RNAs in trans could be verified
experimentally in HeLa cells using reconstructed L1 subfamilies [44] as sources for reverse transcription of trans
RNAs.

Determining a set of processed pseudogenes
PPs were searched for in an assembled human genome
sequence (Human Genome Project Working Draft, April 1
2001) [50] using BLAT [51]. The BLAT setting was as follows:
Assembly: April 1, 2001; Query type: DNA; Sort output:
query, score; Output type: hyperlink. 'Confirmed cDNAs'
(23,929 entries) in Ensembl DB (v1.1.0) [29] were used as
queries. The subject with the highest score was regarded as
the gene encoding the transcript. Multiple hits were subjected
to analysis.

Genome Biology 2003, 4:R74

information

Subjects that contained over 90% of the query length were
used. The number of aligning blocks, which usually corresponds to the number of exons, was compared between a gene
and other subjects. If the number of aligning blocks was
smaller than that of the gene, the subject was further analyzed, thus eliminating pseudogenes generated by DNA
duplications. Subjects that were identified by intronless genes
(single exon genes) were not included in the analysis to avoid
confusing PPs and pseudogenes generated by DNA
duplications. To avoid confusing phylogenetic relationships,
loci (subjects) that were identified by multiple query hits were
not included in the analysis. A series of Perl scripts were
designed to analyze the BLAT search results.

interactions

Retrotransposition of PPs causes not only insertional mutations but also the propagation of new genes. These 'retrogenes' comprise PPs that inserted themselves next to resident
promoter/enhancer elements and thereby escaped transcriptional silencing and PPs that were initially inactive but were
reactivated at a later time when flanking regulatory elements
became activated by mutation [6]. Retrogenes are often

Alu insertions mediate many genomic rearrangements, such
as unequal crossing over, induction of alternative splicing,
and the introduction of new promoters, poly(A) signals and
even new exons [6]. Inactivation of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic
acid hydroxylase (around 2.8 million years ago) before brain
expansion during human evolution occurred by an Alu-mediated inactivating mutation [45], representing yet another
example of the impact of the Alu expansion. The current frequency of human endogenous insertional mutations caused
by Alu retrotransposition is estimated at around 1 in every 16200 individuals [26,46]. The frequency of Alu insertion at the
time of the retrotranspositional explosion is estimated to
have been 30-200 times higher than the frequency over the
last 10 million years ([26] and data not shown). This implies
that at least one in seven individuals at the time carried new
Alu insertions in their genomes (a maximum of 12 insertions
per individual). This high Alu insertion rate may have had a
much greater impact on ancestral primate genomes compared with the impact of present-day mutations.

Gene density (number/Mb)

Over the course of eukaryotic evolution, the extensive propagation of new genes preceded apparent bursts of new
organisms or the emergence of new hierarchies of morphological complexity [48,49]. The time of the retrotranspositional explosion can be estimated at 40-50 million years ago,
assuming a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.5 × 10-9 per
nucleotide per year [34,35]. Fossil records show that before
this period, simian ancestors (monkeys, apes and humans)
diverged from prosimians (lemurs and lorises) with the divergence of New World monkeys and the radiation of the
remaining primates proceeding immediately thereafter
[36,37] (Figure 7). The rapid amplification of Alus to the level
of 10% of the primate genome and the creation of numerous
replicas of various genes may have provided the molecular
basis that led to the radiation of higher primates.

observed in primate genomes [6], one example being the testis-specific human gene CDY (on the Y chromosome), which
arose during primate evolution by retrotransposition of the
ubiquitous mRNA of the gene CDYL located on chromosome
13 [7]. From the observed distribution of CDY homologs in
primates, this event appears to have occurred in the simian
lineage after its divergence from prosimians but before the
split between Old and New World monkeys [7] during the
period of the retrotranspositional explosion. We predict that
further studies will demonstrate that many human retrogenes
were generated during this period, and postulate that such
retrogenes were involved in generating new characteristics
that are specific to simian primates [8,47].

boxes. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method [62] based on the last 900 bp of the consensus sequences of respective
subfamilies.

The level of substitutions that accumulated in a PP (K(ψ)) was
estimated using the following method.
First, the sequence divergence value (D) was corrected by
removing the contribution of mutations at CpG sites.
Sequence divergence (δ) of a sequence (at a given time point)
of length (N) including the number of CpG dinucleotides (n)
is given as a function of the mutation rate at non-CpG dinucleotides (α) and CpG dinucleotides (β) as follows:
δ = α(1/2 - n/N) + βn/N

(1)

From the result of Sved and Bird [33], the ratio of β to α is ∼
6.5. Therefore, designating α/2 = µ and n/N = ν in Equation
1 gives the following:

Analysis of sequence divergence

To evaluate our annotation of PPs, our results for chromosomes 21 and 22 were compared with those from other studies. For chromosome 21, the PP total in this study was 34
whereas previous studies reported 41 [52,53] and 57 [4]. The
number of annotations common to two studies totaled 18
(this study and [52]), 14 (this study and [4]) and 21 [4,52].
Annotations common to all studies totaled 10. For chromosome 22, the PP total in this study was 62, whereas previous
studies reported 91 [54,55] and 73 [4]. The number of common annotations totaled 37 (this study and [54]), 28 (this
study and [4]) and 52 [4,54]. Annotations common to all
studies totaled 27. Differences between the numbers appear
to derive mainly from differences in the gene sets used for the
analyses [30].

information

For each Alu and L1 repeat, the genomic location and
sequence divergence was obtained from the output file of the
RepeatMasker program applied to the human genome draft
sequence (22 December 2001 [56]). Sequence divergences
were defined as the mismatch rates of respective repeats relative to the consensus sequence of respective subfamilies.

expected from the local fraction of cytosines and guanosines
[14]), the CpG frequency (ν) at time (t) was calculated as
follows:
ν = 1/(At + 1/(ι - ε)) + ε

(3)

If we accept the value of 1.5 × 10-9 per nucleotide per year
[34,35] as the neutral mutation rate [41] and equate this to
the mutation rate at non-CpG dinucleotides (µ) and use a
time unit of 1 million years, then the mutation rate at CpG
dinucleotides, β/2, will be around 1 per 100 nucleotides per
million years (that is, ν will be reduced by 1% every million
years). Therefore, ν(t = 1)/ν(t = 0) in Equation 3 gives:

for multiple substitutions at the same site using the JukesCantor model [34], giving the average number of substitutions per 100 bp (K): K = - (3/4)ln(1 - (4/3)Σ).
For PPs, sequence divergences were defined as the mismatch
rates of respective PPs relative to the current sequences of
their parental genes. The mismatch rate of a PP relative to its
parental gene (K) consists of the level of substitutions that
accumulated only in the PP (K(ψ)) and the level of substitutions that accumulated only in the gene (K(f)): K = K(f) +
K(ψ). K(f) and K(ψ) can be further subdivided into the
number of synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions [58-60]: K(f) = Ks(f) + Ka(f), K(ψ) = Ks(ψ) + Ka(ψ).
Kuma and Miyata evaluated the average nucleotide substitution rates of 31 pairs of human PPs and their parental genes
using homologs of other species as outgroups (K. Kuma and
T. Miyata, personal communication). They used the following
genes: ADP-ribosylation factor 1, aldolase A, aldose reductase, alpha-E-catenin, alpha-L-fucosidase, alpha-enolase,
arylamine N-acetyltransferase, beta-tubulin, c-Raf protooncogene, cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit,
calmodulin, ceruloplasmin, creatine kinase, cyclophilin, cytochrome b5, cytochrome c, ferrochelatase, gamma-actin, glucocerebrosidase, glutamine synthetase, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, histone H3.3, hsc70, hsp27,
hsp60, lactate dehydrogenase-A, neurotrophin-4, phosphoglycerate kinase, prothymosine alpha, topoisomerase-I,
triose phosphate isomerase. They calculated the following
ratios: Rs(ψ), the synonymous substitutions in PPs to synonymous substitutions in their parental genes; Ra(f), the ratio of
nonsynonymous substitutions in genes to synonymous substitutions in genes; and Ra(ψ), the ratio of nonsynonymous
substitutions in PPs to synonymous substitutions in genes.
The mean values of Rs(ψ), Ra(ψ) and Ra(f) were:

(1/(A + 1/(ι - ε)) + ε)/ι ≈ 0.99
Rs(ψ) = Ks(ψ)/Ks(f) = 1.40

(6.1)

Ra(ψ) = Ka(ψ)/Ks(f) = 1.13

(6.2)

Solving for A gives:
A = 0.01ι/((0.99ι - ε)(ι - ε))

(4)
Ra(f) = Ka(f)/Ks(f) = 0.06

(6.3)

The sequence divergence value (D) is given as an integral of
the sequence divergence (δ) from the present (t = 0) to the
time of the duplication (t = T): D = ∫0Tδdt. From Equations 2,
3 and 4,

From Equations 6.1-6.3, and Equations K = K(f) + K(ψ), K(f)
= Ks(f) + Ka(f), and K(ψ) = Ks(ψ) + Ka(ψ), the estimated level
of substitutions in PPs (K(ψ)) is given by:

D = ∫0Tµ(1 + 11((ι - ε)/((0.01ι/(0.99ι - ε))t + 1) + ε))dt (5)

K(ψ) = 0.705K

Solving Equation 5 for T gives the time since the duplication.
The following ι and ε values (ι, ε, respectively) were used for
the retroposons shown [14,57]:
