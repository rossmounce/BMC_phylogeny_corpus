Abstract
Background: Pathogenic yersiniae (Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica) share a virulence
plasmid encoding a type three secretion system (T3SS). This T3SS comprises more than 40
constituents. Among these are the transport substrates called Yops (Yersinia outer proteins), the
specific Yop chaperones (Sycs), and the Ysc (Yop secretion) proteins which form the transport
machinery. The effectors YopO and YopP are encoded on an operon together with SycO, the
chaperone of YopO. The characterization of SycO is the focus of this study.
Results: We have established the large-scale production of recombinant SycO in its outright form.
We confirm that Y. enterocolitica SycO forms homodimers which is typical for Syc chaperones. SycO
overproduction in Y. enterocolitica decreases secretion of Yops into the culture supernatant
suggesting a regulatory role of SycO in type III secretion. We demonstrate that in vitro SycO
interacts with YscM1, a negative regulator of Yop expression in Y. enterocolitica. However, the SycO
overproduction phenotype was not mediated by YscM1, YscM2, YopO or YopP as revealed by
analysis of isogenic deletion mutants.
Conclusion: We present evidence that SycO is integrated into the regulatory network of the
Yersinia T3SS. Our picture of the Yersinia T3SS interactome is supplemented by identification of the
SycO/YscM1 interaction. Further, our results suggest that at least one additional interaction
partner of SycO has to be identified.

Background
An ever increasing number of Gram-negative bacteria is
known to utilize a type three secretion system (T3SS),
mostly pathogens that manipulate their host cells by
injecting effector proteins [1]. One of the characteristics of

T3SSs is the existence of specific energy-independent
chaperones which assist several of the transport substrates. Chaperones assisting the effectors (class I chaperones) are distinguished from those assisting the pore
forming translocators (class II chaperones) [2]. The mode

of interaction between class I chaperones and their respective substrates is well-investigated, mainly due to crystal
structures of several chaperone/substrate complexes [3-5].
Typically, a region of 50–80 amino acids following the
putative N-terminal secretion signal is wrapped around a
chaperone dimer thereby preventing tertiary structure formation of this substrate region. The rest of the substrate,
however, is folded [4-8]. The chaperone/substrate complexes are recognized by a T3SS-specific ATPase [9], which
is able to displace the chaperone from its substrate and
further to act as an unfoldase unraveling the substrate
[10].
Despite these recent discoveries, the substrate recognition
process has remained enigmatic [11,12]. It has been suggested that the chaperone/substrate complexes may constitute a three-dimensional secretion signal [4]. This
hypothesis is supported by the intriguing fact that the
structures of all classI chaperones share a common fold
even across the genus barrier and despite low sequence
similarity.
The T3SS of pathogenic Yersinia spp. is among the most
intensively studied T3SSs with the structures of the
homodimeric chaperones SycE [13-15], SycH [16], SycT
[17,18], and the atypical SycN/YscB heterodimer [5] being
solved. According to phylogenetic analyses and experimental results, the Yersinia T3SS holds at least one additional classI chaperone, SycO [19,20].
Here, we focus on characterization of Y. enterocolitica
SycO, encoded by a gene termed orf155 until recently. In
Y. enterocolitica, sycO is organized in an operon together
with yopO (ypkA in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis) and
yopP (yopJ in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis). Within this
operon, sycO is located upstream of the yopO gene. A nonpolar deletion mutant of orf1, the sycO orthologue in Y.
pseudotuberculosis, secreted YpkA and YopJ in amounts
comparable to the wildtype and was fully virulent. Further, orf1 was not found to be involved in temperature
and calcium-dependent control of Yop expression and
secretion [21]. Because of these results and the use of the
infrequent "GTG" start codon of orf1, Galyov et al. [21]
proposed that orf1 might not be translated. Later, the corresponding orf7 of Y. pestis was discussed as a potential
Syc-like chaperone due to the typical size (15.7 kDa), isoelectric point (pI of 4.39), and amphipathic character of
the putative translation product [22]. However, in Y. enterocolitica the induction of apoptosis by YopP in macrophages was shown to be independent of orf155, and it was
found that secretion of YopO into the culture supernatant
was apparently not restricted in the absence of orf155 [23].
Only recently, a chaperone function of the orf155 product
on the effector YopO was reported. Consequently, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/67

gene product of orf155 was termed SycO and the gene was
renamed sycO [20].
Here, we characterize recombinantly produced SycO as a
homodimer. We demonstrate the potential of SycO to
influence Yop expression and secretion, and identify a
novel interaction partner of SycO.

Results
Recombinant production of SycO
To examine SycO in vitro, we recombinantly produced
SycO in E. coli and purified it to near homogeneity. For
this purpose, we followed a protocol previously established for production of SycH and SycT to generate the
proteins in their outright form without an affinity tag
[7,18]. The sycO sequence of Y. enterocolitica strain WA314 [24] was amplified by PCR, thereby changing the start
codon from "GTG" to "ATG" to ensure maximal expression. The fragment was cloned into vector pWS [18].
Expression was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS.
SycO was produced in abundance and its solubility was
optimized by expression at 27°C overnight. A purification
protocol was established combining ammonium sulfate
precipitation followed by MonoQ-based anion exchange
chromatography and a final gel filtration step. The yield
was approximately 15 mg of purified protein per liter of
culture with a homogeneity of about 95%.
Recombinant SycO forms homodimers
Typically, T3SS effector chaperones form homodimers. In
order to test SycO for oligomerization, we applied analytical gel filtration and chemical cross-linking. Fig. 1A
depicts the SDS-PAGE analysis of a Superdex75 gel filtration of a mixture of recombinant SycO (15.9 kDa) and the
monomeric marker protein carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa).
The Coomassie-stained gel of consecutive fractions shows
that SycO elutes before the 29 kDa marker protein. Calibration of the column revealed an apparent molecular
mass of approximately 35 kDa for SycO, which is well in
accordance with dimer formation. To confirm this, we
performed a chemical cross-linking experiment as shown
in Fig.1B. The cross-linking reagent DSP generated heatstable coupling products corresponding to SycO dimers as
resolved by SDS-PAGE. Note that the mobility of SycO in
SDS-PAGE is higher than that of typical marker proteins
due to its low isoelectric point of 4.3.
Overproduction of SycO represses Yop secretion in Y.
enterocolitica
It was described that overproduction of the regulatory
T3SS chaperone SycH in Yersinia influences regulation of
Yop secretion and expression [25,26]. In order to test
SycO for possible regulatory functions, we overproduced
SycO in Y. enterocolitica WA-314 and in the isogenic ΔyopO
and ΔyopP mutant strains [27]. In all three strains, the

Recombinant SycO forms homodimers
Recombinant SycO forms homodimers. (A) Analytical gel filtration shows that SycO elutes from a Superdex 75 column
prior to the 29 kDa marker protein, carbonic anhydrase.
Consecutive fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE
(Coomassie-stained); the column was calibrated as indicated
above the gel. (B) Chemical cross-linking of recombinant
SycO using DSP as cross-linking reagent was analyzed by
Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE.

overproduction of SycO reduced the level of secreted Yops
significantly (Fig. 2A). An IPTG titration series is shown in
Fig. 2B illustrating the correlation between an increase of
SycO production and a decrease of Yop secretion. As an
exception, the level of secreted YopO remained stable
upon SycO overproduction in the parental strain and in
the ΔyopP mutant strain as revealed by Western blotting
(Fig. 2A).
Strikingly, analysis of the pellet fractions revealed a
decrease of all Yops including YopO within the cells overproducing SycO (Fig. 2C). It was recently demonstrated,
that secretion of YopO into the culture supernatant does
not strictly rely on SycO [20,23]. Thus, excess of SycO
could increase the secretion efficiency of YopO. The finding that the amount of secreted YopO was constant
despite of reduced intracellular levels suggests that YopO
secretion efficiency was increased by excess of SycO.
On closer inspection of YopP secretion, it became evident
that deletion of yopO generated a polar effect resulting in
reduced YopP secretion (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, SycO
overproduction did not cause as pronounced a reduction
of YopP secretion in the yopO mutant as in the parental
strain. This observation might point to an interrelation
between YopO/SycO and YopP and hence to an explanation for the operon structure.

Taken together, these results suggest that SycO overproduction interferes with the T3SS regulatory network. Strikingly, this effect is neither mediated by an interaction of
SycO with its effector YopO nor by an interaction with
YopP which is also encoded within the same operon.
To test a possible unspecific effect of SycO overproduction, we searched for a protein with similar functions and
properties but unrelated to the T3SS to overproduce it as
a control. We chose SecB, the chaperone of the Sec transport pathway, which exhibits similar properties compared
to SycO (SecB: 17.3 kDa, pI 3.91; SycO: 15.9 kDa, pI
4.32). Overproduction of SecB in the same strains did not
cause any significant effect on secretion and expression of
Yops (Fig. 3), suggesting a specific effect of SycO towards
the T3SS.
As a further control of specificity, we analyzed the influence of SycO overproduction on the Sec-pathway by monitoring
beta-lactamase-mediated
resistance
to
carbenicillin. We found no influence of SycO overproduction on the level of carbenicillin resistance even at concentrations above 1 mg/ml of carbenicillin (data not shown).
Finally, we compared the effect of SycO overproduction to
that of SycH overproduction (Fig. 4). Even though the
overproduction of SycH was very massive compared to
SycO (Fig. 4B) no similar effect on secretion of Yops was
observed (Fig. 4A). In conclusion, these findings suggest
that the SycO overexpression phenotype is due to a specific interaction of SycO with some component of the
T3SS or one involved in the T3SS regulatory network.
Differential effect of SycO overproduction on
accumulation of Yops in the Yersinia cytosol in the
presence of calcium ions
We further analyzed the effect of SycO overproduction in
the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 at 37°C to detect a possible
calcium-blind phenotype. We observed that none of the
strains secreted Yops in the presence of calcium (data not
shown). Interestingly, SycO overproduction increased the
cytosolic YopO levels (Fig. 5). An excess of SycO possibly
stabilizes YopO and thereby increases its half-life when no
secretion takes place. In comparison, YopH levels were
not significantly affected upon overproduction of SycO
(Fig. 5). Consequently, SycO overproduction interferes
with Yop expression only under conditions of Yop secretion.
SycO interacts with the T3SS regulatory protein YscM1
Several Yersinia T3SS chaperones like SycD, SycE, and
SycH are known to be involved in regulation of Yop
expression [26,28,29]. Interestingly, these chaperones
interact with the negative regulators of Yop expression,
YscM1 (orthologous to LcrQ of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuber-

Overproduction of SycO represses secretion and expression of Yops. Y. enterocolitica parental strain WA-314 and the isogenic
deletion mutants ΔyopO and ΔyopP were transformed with plasmids pWS-sycO and pWS, respectively. After culturing at 37°C
in the presence of 0.2 mM CaCl2 for 2 h, Yop secretion was induced with EGTA. Simultaneously, the cultures were supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and grown for another 2 h. (A) TCA-precipitated culture supernatants were analyzed by Coomassiestaining of an SDS gel (upper panel), and by immunoblotting of YopO and YopP (lower panels). Two independent cultures of
each strain are represented. Calibration of gel loads was obtained by measurement of the optical density of the cultures. (B)

culosis) and YscM2, respectively [25,30,31]. YscM2 is only
present in Y. enterocolitica and paralogous to YscM1, sharing 57% identical residues [32]. Since our results suggest
a regulatory function of SycO, we speculated that SycO
might also interact with YscM1 and YscM2. To check these
interactions, we performed native gel electrophoresis as
shown in Fig. 6. A representative Coomassie-stained
native gel (Fig. 6, panel A) shows that loading a mixture
of the recombinant proteins YscM1 and SycO results in

appearance of an additional band (lane 2). This band
does not appear when loading either YscM1 (lane 1) or
SycO (lane 3) alone. Immunoblots developed with antisera raised against SycO (panel B) and YscM1 (panel C)
revealed that this band represents a complex composed of
YscM1 and SycO. In contrast, no interaction between
YscM2 and SycO was found (lane 4). Note that due to the
high isoelectric point of YscM2 (pI 9.79) this protein does
not enter the native gel with a pH of 8 [31].

Cross-linking experiments were performed to verify the
YscM1/SycO interaction. However, the data did not help
to interpret the results from native gel electrophoresis
since YscM1 and SycO are very similar in size and both
form homodimers ([33], Fig. 1). As a consequence, the
major cross-linking products could not be unambiguously assigned to heterocomplexes (data not shown).
Overproduction of SycO in the yscM1 and yscM2 deletion
mutants
We speculated that the effects of SycO overproduction
described above could be mediated by the regulatory proteins YscM1 and YscM2. To find out whether such a connection exists, we generated deletion mutants of yscM1
and yscM2, respectively, to use them as background for
SycO overproduction. Deletions of yscM1 and yscM2 were
generated by the Red recombinase based method of Datsenko and Wanner [34] that was adapted to Y. enterocolitica [35]. In accordance with Stainier et al. [32], we found
that neither the ΔyscM1 nor the ΔyscM2 mutant exhibited

a phenotype with respect to Yop expression and secretion
(Fig. 7). Overall, overproduction of SycO in both mutant
strains caused a decrease of Yop secretion (Fig. 7A) and
expression (Fig. 7B) similar to what was observed for the
parental strain. However, two reproducible phenomena
related to the yscM1 deletion strain could be observed.
First, SycO overproduction caused a decrease of YopO
secretion (Fig. 7A). In the presence of extracellular calcium, the increase of YopO levels was less pronounced in
the ΔyscM1 and also in the ΔyscM2 strain compared to the
parental strain (Fig. 8). Second, decrease of YopP secretion as a consequence of SycO overproduction was more
pronounced in the ΔyscM1 strain compared to any other
strain (Fig. 7A and Fig. 2A for comparison).
In summary, these results show that neither YscM1 nor
YscM2 is required to establish the SycO-mediated shutdown of Yop expression and secretion. However, the
yscM1 deletion mutant exhibits a phenotype suggesting

that SycO and YscM1 act together in the regulation of
YopO and YopP.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that Y. enterocolitica SycO
behaves as a homodimer in solution. This is in full agreement with a recent study from Letzelter et al. [20] who also
applied gel filtration analysis and cross-linking techniques with the same outcome. Homodimer formation is
typical for T3SS chaperones of effectors, and SycO dimerization is thus plausible in the light of the recent discovery
that SycO serves as a chaperone for YopO [20]. Now, that
we have established a protocol for the large-scale production of native SycO we aim at generating high-resolution
structural data to characterize SycO on the molecular
level.
We have further presented evidence that the functions of
SycO are not restricted to chaperoning YopO. We could
show that overproduction of SycO causes an apparent
repression of Yop secretion and expression. Two principle
explanations for this phenomenon seem plausible. On
the one hand, SycO could interfere with the regulatory
network involved in Yop expression, thereby causing

down-regulation of Yop expression and consequently
reducing the amount of secreted Yops. On the other hand,
SycO could interfere with some component of the T3SS
transport machinery. In particular, T3SS chaperones are
capable of interacting with the specific ATPase of the
transport machinery [9] irrespective of effector-binding to
the chaperones. Thus, abundant SycO could compete with
chaperone/Yop complexes and thereby reduce the efficiency of Yop secretion. Since a shutdown of secretion typically results in feedback inhibition of Yop expression,
this scenario could explain the phenotype equally well.
This latter hypothesis is challenged by the observation
that overproduction of SycH in Y. pestis causes a slight
increase of Yop expression and secretion as well as a relaxation of the Calcium-dependent control of Yop secretion
[26]. Similarly, moderate overproduction of SycH induces
Yop production in Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis
[25]. Even the dramatically elevated SycH levels that we
applied could not provoke an effect comparable to that of
SycO. Therefore, an interference of SycO with the Yop regulatory network is a more likely explanation. Since YopO
and YopP proved to be dispensable for mediating the
effect caused by SycO overproduction, we speculated on a
role of the Yop regulatory proteins YscM1 and YscM2 in

this context. Clearly, neither YscM1 nor YscM2 was
required to establish the SycO phenotype. Presumably, at
least one further interaction partner of SycO has to be
identified. This will help to understand whether SycO
overexpression acts at the level of transcription or translation.
Nevertheless, we could demonstrate an interaction
between YscM1 and SycO in vitro. In support of such an
interaction, overproduction of SycO in the yscM1 deletion
strain influenced YopO and YopP secretion and intracellular accumulation of YopO. The YscM proteins are
involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of Yop
expression. In addition, they are T3S substrates themselves and chaperoned by SycH, another actor in the Yop
expression network [25,36,37]. Recently, binding of SycE
to YscM1 and YscM2, and binding of SycD to YscM2 was
demonstrated [30,31]. What could be the meaning of this
YscM promiscuity? An unspecific interaction of both
YscM1 and YscM2 with the acidic T3SS chaperones seems
unlikely, given that the isoelectric point of YscM1 is 6.05
whereas the pI of YscM2 is 9.79. We propose that the YscM
proteins function as an interface, integrating information
on whether T3SS chaperones are loaded with Yops, and
transducing these signals into repression or derepression
of Yop translation.

This study supports the recently established view that
SycO is a typical T3SS chaperone of class I that increases
solubility and secretion efficiency of the effector YopO
[20]. Beyond that, our results suggest that SycO is part of
the T3SS regulatory network. This finding highlights the
need for a complete T3SS interactome to understand the
complex T3SS machinery.

introducing NdeI and SalI restriction sites, respectively.
The NdeI-SalI cleaved PCR product was introduced into
expression vector pWS [18] resulting in plasmid pWSsycO. Y. enterocolitica WA-314 secB was cloned into pWS
after generation of a PCR product using primers 5'-CATATGTCAGAACAAAACAACACCGAG-3'
and
5'GTCGACTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGGCATCCTGACGTTGTTCAGC-3', and subcloning of the PCR product into pGEM-T (Promega). The resulting plasmid was
termed pWS-secB. Construction of plasmid pWS-sycH was
conducted in an analogous manner using primers 5'-CATATGCGCACTTACAGTTCATTAC-3' and 5'-GTCGACTTAAACCAGTAAATGAGATGATG-3'. Deletion of yscM1
and yscM2, respectively, in Y. enterocolitica WA-314 was
introduced applying the phage lambda Red recombinase
technique as previously established for Y. enterocolitica
[35]. The kanamycin gene of plasmid pACYC177 (New
England Biolabs) was amplified with 50-nucleotidehomology extensions corresponding to the flanks of the
yscM1
coding
region
using
primers
5'AATAAATAACTTAGAATATCGTAGAGATAATTATAGCGA
CAGGAGACTCGTCACTGACACCCTCATCAGTG-3' and
5'ATCAACCTGGGGGTATTATCGCCTCAATATACAGTAAT
ATATTATCGCGTCAAGTCAGCGTAATGCTC-3'. Analogously,
primers
5'TGGTGGTTTAGTTTGTGTTTATTTTAAAATATACATGACA
TATCGACGTTTCACTGACACCCTCATCAGTG-3' and 5'TGAAAAATTGAATTTTTAGTTTTAAGGTAACTTATCATTA
AGTTGTGATACGTCAAGTTGTGATACGTCAAGTCAGCGTAATGCTC-3' were used in the case of yscM2.
Construction of yopO and yopP deletion mutants was
described previously [27].
Culturing of yersiniae
Induction of the T3SS of Y. enterocolitica WA-314 was
accomplished essentially as described [38]. In brief, yersiniae overnight cultures grown at 27°C in brain heart
infusion broth (BHI; Difco) were diluted 1:20 in BHI supplemented with 0.2 mM CaCl2 and cultured for 2 h at

Native gel electrophoresis reveals an interaction between
SycO and YscM1. Recombinant proteins as indicated were
loaded on Tris-buffered native gels. The gels were Coomassie-stained (A) or alternatively electro-blotted and incubated
with antisera raised against SycO (B), and YscM1 (C), respectively. The amount of SycO (20 μg) was approximately equimolar to that of YscM1 (15 μg) and YscM2 (15 μg). SycO/
YscM1 complex is indicated by arrowheads. YscM2 does not
enter the native gel (pH 8) due to its high isoelectric point (pI
9.79).

37°C. Then, EGTA was added to a final concentration of
5 mM and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mM for
induction of Yop secretion. Alternatively, for repression of
Yop secretion yersiniae were cultivated for 4 h at 37°C in
BHI supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2. Overproduction of
SycO and SecB was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG at
the time of EGTA supplementation.
Expression and purification of recombinant SycO
The strategy for production of recombinant SycO was
essentially as described for SycT [18]. Plasmid pWS-sycO
was transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene). A
100 ml overnight culture was grown in LB medium supplemented with 1% glucose at 37°C and diluted 1:50 in 5
liter LB medium. The culture was further grown in a BIOSTAT B fermenter (B.Braun Biotech International) at 37°C
under conditions of constant aeration (10 l/min), pH
(7.2) and stirring (200 rpm). At an OD600 of 0.7 the temperature was decreased to 27°C and subsequently SycO
expression was induced by adding 0.2 mM IPTG. Bacteria
were cultivated for another 18 h, harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -20°C. The bacterial pellet from 1.25
liter of culture was resuspended in 80 ml of Buffer A (50
mM Tris-HCl pH7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) supplemented with 4 mM PMSF and 250 U Benzonase (Merck
Biosciences). The sample was passed through a French
press three times (1000 psi) and centrifuged at 20,000 g
for 40 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 20%
(NH4)2SO4 and gently stirred for 2 h at 4°C. The SycO precipitate was obtained by centrifugation (20,000 g, 4°C),
washed with precipitation buffer and resuspended in
buffer A. The sample was then loaded on a MonoQ column (HiTrap Q FF, 5 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml
of buffer A, then elution was conducted by applying a 100
ml linear gradient of 0–100% elution buffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT). SycO eluted in the
range of 280–370 mM NaCl.
Chemical cross-linking
Cross-linking reagent DSP (dithiobis [succinimidylpropionate]) was purchased from Pierce. For cross-linking of
SycO, 10 μl reaction volume containing 1.3 mM DSP and
3 μg/μl recombinant SycO in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) was incubated for 30 min at 22°C. The reaction was
stopped by adding 0.4 μl of a 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5 solution and was incubated for another 15 min at 22°C. 5 μl
of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol were added and the sample was heated for 5
min at 95°C before loading.
Native gel electrophoresis
Tris-buffered continuous native gel electrophoresis was
performed as previously described [31]. Gels were stained

Analytical gel filtration chromatography
Analytical gel filtration was performed with a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) as described [33]. Recombinant SycO (50 μg) and the monomeric 29 kDa protein
carbonic anhydrase (50 μg) were mixed in a volume of 50
μl of PBS and loaded on a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column
(Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS. Fractions
of 50 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Marker proteins for column calibration were purchased
from Sigma (bovine serum albumine, 67 kDa; carbonic
anhydrase, 29 kDa; cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa).
