Abstract
Background: The number of sequences compiled in many genome projects is growing
exponentially, but most of them have not been characterized experimentally. An automatic
annotation scheme must be in an urgent need to reduce the gap between the amount of new
sequences produced and reliable functional annotation. This work proposes rules for automatically
classifying the fungus genes. The approach involves elucidating the enzyme classifying rule that is
hidden in UniProt protein knowledgebase and then applying it for classification. The association
algorithm, Apriori, is utilized to mine the relationship between the enzyme class and significant
InterPro entries. The candidate rules are evaluated for their classificatory capacity.
Results: There were five datasets collected from the Swiss-Prot for establishing the annotation
rules. These were treated as the training sets. The TrEMBL entries were treated as the testing set.
A correct enzyme classification rate of 70% was obtained for the prokaryote datasets and a similar
rate of about 80% was obtained for the eukaryote datasets. The fungus training dataset which lacks
an enzyme class description was also used to evaluate the fungus candidate rules. A total of 88 out
of 5085 test entries were matched with the fungus rule set. These were otherwise poorly
annotated using their functional descriptions.
Conclusion: The feasibility of using the method presented here to classify enzyme classes based
on the enzyme domain rules is evident. The rules may be also employed by the protein annotators
in manual annotation or implemented in an automatic annotation flowchart.

Background
The number of sequences generated by many genome
projects is soaring exponentially but most of them have
not been characterized experimentally. Manual annotation methods have been proposed by experts and are popular for use at the genome centers, but their annotation
capacities are exceeded by the fast growing genome data.
An automatic annotation scheme is in urgent need to

speed up reliable functional annotation on new
sequences produced. Automatic annotation provides an
efficient procedure for analyzing the gene sequences. Most
automatic solutions used to characterize the gene
sequences are based on a high-level sequence similarity
search against some known protein databases such as
using the BLAST or FASTA program. The correlation
between sequence composition and functional characterPage 1 of 8

ization provides the foundation for transferring functional knowledge from a biochemically characterized
protein to a homologous but uncharacterized one. However, sequence composition bias and database updating
commonly influence the results of similarity searches, and
they do not yield the exact share between biological function and domain composition based on the similarity
threshold used [1]. Many annotation packages have
recently been developed. For example, a basic annotation,
which is directly transferred from a homologue entry
using a similarity threshold, is offered by the package
GeneQuiz [2]. Other packages, such as Rulebase [3] and
HAMAP [1], use the classifying rules and are supported by
the judgment of a curator.
In the post-genomic era, the functional annotations are of
great importance in understanding the real cellular processes. A variety of enzymes and pathway databases including Ecocyc, Enzyme, and KEGG, have been built to
facilitate the prediction of the metabolic pathway. Such
databases are supplied as reference databases in virtual
construction of the metabolic networks of other organisms. On the pathway map, enzymes are the main components used for linking the metabolic networks. The
fundamental units of enzyme structure governing folding
and function are domains of protein [4]. A domain is
believed to be able to fold independently into a stable
three-dimensional structure to perform a specific function. In general, a protein would comprise a single
domain or several different domains. It is clear that the
domain composition of a protein determines its function
and pathways in which it participates [5]. In other words,
the protein function may be inferred from the domain
composition which is then used to annotate the unknown
sequences sharing the same domain composition with the
protein. More importantly, such rules are invariable
unlike the BLAST results that typically vary as the database
is updated. Many tools are available for detecting the constituents of proteins such as CDART (NCBI) and InterProScan. InterPro is a database of protein families, domains,
and functional sites where identifiable characteristics of
known proteins can be applied to annotate unknown protein sequences [6]. The tools of InterPro, InterProScan,
can be also used to annotate the single domain protein
sequence; however, it may be difficult to make a decision
on the annotation of multi-domain proteins by the
method.
This work proposes a machine learning method for identifying enzyme classes according to the rules that are
related to the protein domain composition. Using rules
generated by machine learning algorithms, Kretschmann
et al. [7] and Bazzan et al. [8] have successfully annotated
the Trembl database. They adopted the decision tree algorithm to obtain rules from the Swiss-Prot entries that are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/304

cross-referenced to the InterPro database. They then used
these rules to assign appropriate keywords to the TrEMBL
entries [7,8]. In this study, an association algorithm is
used to mine the rules linking enzymes and domains and
they are then used to annotate enzyme classes automatically. The association algorithm has been extensively
employed to analyze market baskets. It is applied primarily to determine the relationships among items in a large
dataset. In market basket analysis, large associated itemsets always represent items that are likely to be purchased
together by customers in a single transaction. The association algorithm has also been employed to mine gene
expression data [9] and medical data [10]. This investigation utilizes an association algorithm to mine the rules
linking enzymes and domains from the Swiss-Prot protein
knowledgebase. The enzyme class and InterPro accession
number (henceforth IPR Acc's) are treated consistently as
items in searching for rules governing the enzyme domain
composition. These rules may be useful even for annotators who do not have deep knowledge on the definitions
of enzyme classes.

Results and discussion
Data preparation
This work seeks to annotate unknown genes and establishes virtual metabolic pathways using the bioinformatics approach based on progress made in the Monascus
genome project at the authors' institute. Only few Monascus genes have been biochemically characterized so far.
Numerous well-characterized proteins have been stored
in a public database so that it is feasible to mine the classified rules from a protein knowledgebase. The BLAST is a
fast but insufficient method for annotating unknown
genes because it does not provide information on the
functional domain. Analyzing the constituent domains of
a gene enables the determination of possible functions of
the gene. However, making a decision regarding the annotation of a multi-domain protein is difficult. In this study,
an annotation model was established by applying rules
derived from the domain compositions in some wellcharacterized proteins. The concept of annotation using
the domain composition was further investigated. Five
datasets (Table 1) were used to mine the association rules,
which were then evaluated. All the datasets used herein
have the EC class and IPR description. In the preliminary
investigation, all the IPR Accs of each Swiss-Prot entry
were utilized to determine the association rules. Unfortunately, some IPR Accs were presented as a single rule
whose entries were linked to approximate sequence position but assigned with different accession numbers. To
reduce the redundant and insignificant ones such as the
glycosylation site and others, the IDA in InterPro was
employed to filter the IPR entries.

Association algorithm used to mine enzyme composition
Many data mining methods have been applied in the biological researches. For example, a decision tree has been
used in keyword annotation in the Swiss-Prot [7] and
PIGS [8] projects. Herein, the association algorithm was
employed to find rules to perform automatic annotation.
The association algorithm has been extensively used to
elucidate the consumptive behavior. These rules are ordinarily mined from numerous transaction records. Similar
to the market basket analysis, the EC class and IPR Acc's
were treated as a single transaction record in every training
entry. In the training file (Fig. 1), each instance was composed of all the attributes (IPR Acc's) of the training dataset and all the EC class was included in the target class. The
results indicated that various rules were obtained simultaneously. The candidate association rules were found
redundant and many were subsets of larger frequent itemsets. Table 2 presented the subset of fungous association
rules thus obtained. The complete set of rules was shown
in the additional file [see Additional file 1]. The rules
revealed, for instance, when the InterProScan results of
the protein sequence gave IPR000873, IPR001031,
IPR001242, and IPR006163, the protein was identified as
EC 6.3.2.26. Table 3 listed the association rules obtained
from the five datasets. About 40 ~ 70% of the rules thus
obtained were the multiple domain rules (> = 2 domains).
Although the single domain rules dominate some datasets, the multiple domain rules are more important in the
annotation tasks.
Evaluation of candidate rules
As presented in Table 4, the testing dataset from TrEMBL
was used to evaluate the candidate rules. The precision
was around 70% for the prokaryote dataset (A and B)
though the coverage was less than 50%. The precision and
coverage for the eukaryote datasets (C, D and E) were better than those for the prokaryote ones. The prokaryote
training dataset appears to be more diversified than the
eukaryote one which results in the number of rules
obtained for the former was less than that for the latter.
Additionally, the prediction coverage was enhanced substantially while there were redundancies remaining in the
candidate rules. In fact, the rules from the subsets of the
large itemset were used to predict entries that were not

exactly matched with the rules from the large itemset
though the prediction accuracy was slightly decreased.
Table 5 displays the cross evaluation results for the five
datasets. Both precision and confidence estimated from
the cross evaluation on various phylogenetic datasets
(such as using a fungus testing dataset to evaluate the
plant rules) were worse than those estimated on the same
taxonomic dataset. This reveals that the accuracy of the
prediction depends on the taxonomic relationship
between the training and testing datasets. The closer the
taxonomic relationship between datasets used the greater
the predictive capacity obtained. Moreover, we found that
there was at least 40% accuracy in different taxonomic
cross-validation. It seems that some domain compositions of enzyme were similar among different taxonomic
dataset. Additionally, the prediction accuracy may reflect
the taxonomic relationship in the different dataset. Yang
et al. [11] proposed that using only the presence or absent
of a protein domain architecture can determinate the phylogeny of 174 complete genomes. Our results also reveal

that domain composition of enzyme is highly similar in
the same taxonomic clade.
Furthermore, the accuracy of the presented method was
compared with the rules obtained from the InterPro database. These rules were parsed where the IPR Acc's were
cross-referenced to ENZYME in the entry_xref table of the
InterPro database. The rules such as {IPR001711, EC
3.1.4.11} were retained for providing the enzyme identification. There were five testing datasets used to evaluate
the parsed ones. As shown in Table 6, the identification
accuracy was below 65%. The results revealed that it was
not suitable to directly parse the cross-reference between

enzyme and InterPro Acc's without classifying the dataset
beforehand. In other words, as mentioned above, the
identification of enzyme classes should use the closer taxonomic rules. Moreover, the rules generated from the
association algorithm were highly specific in the closer
taxonomic testing dataset. The association algorithm was
able to select more confident rules in the protein database.
As shown in Table 7 and 8, our single domain rules can
identify enzyme classes with high accuracy, while multiple domain rules can lift the hit ratio in the enzyme identification. In addition, the remaining datasets which were
not annotated with an EC class in the fungus dataset of
Swiss-Prot entries were further employed to evaluate the
fungus rule set. A total of 88 out of 5085 test entries were
found to match with the fungus rule set (Table 9). Most of
these were otherwise poorly annotated by their functional
description. These indicate that the rules mined from the
association algorithm were unique to the enzyme class
and could be used to annotate some unknown protein
sequences.
The precision and confidence of each EC class was also
evaluated in the fungus dataset. Both quantities were varied among all the EC classes tested (data not shown here).
However, a precision of greater than 75% was obtained
for 60% of the EC classes tested (data not shown.). In this
study, the Swiss-Prot entries were chosen as the training
while the TrEMBL entries as the test set. We aimed to find
the EC classifying rules that are hidden in the protein
knowledgebase and to estimate the accuracy of the classifying method. The rules mined and presented here can be
used by an annotator to perform manual annotation.
They can be also implemented in an automatic annotation flowchart. They are also feasible to be used in identifying enzyme classes based on their IPR signature.

Conclusion
This report proposed an alternative approach on employing the association algorithm. The association algorithm
is commonly used to identify large and frequent item sets
and mine hidden relationships among items. The concept
can be applied in many fields other than market basket
analysis. The method is extended here to mine the association rules which are then applied to identify enzyme
classes. The current prediction scheme emphasizes on
identifying enzymes of taxonomically closed datasets.

Rule sets generated from the eukaryote training datasets
can be used to assign the EC classes accurately to poorly
annotated entries whose real enzyme function remain
unknown. Extending the method to predict other types of
data, including the transcription factors and structure proteins, is also worthwhile. However, the low coverage is a
shortcoming of the presented scheme. The matching coverage depends on the quality of the training dataset which
may be extended as a combination of various datasets
with each being closed in taxonomic relationship. Moreover, more rules may be generated using other association
algorithms except the Apriori one.

Methods
Data preparation
There were five distinctly taxonomic datasets referring to
the NEWT [12] (UniProt 4.1) being downloaded (Table
1). The entries that have multiple EC description numbers
were ignored. The training datasets were the Swiss-Prot
entries while the test datasets were taken from TrEMBL.
The EC numbers corresponding to the Swiss-Prot entries
were parsed from the field 'Description' in the Swiss-Prot
database. The InterPro entries that were relevant to the
Swiss-Prot entries were extracted from the InterPro database (release 9.0). The extracted data were stored in a
MySQL database. The IDA (InterPro Domain Architecture) definition was also extracted from the InterPro database. Not all of the InterPro entries that corresponded to
the UniProt entries were treated as the training or testing
attributes. The redundant and insignificant InterPro
entries were removed based on the IDA definition. The
redundancy-deprived data were also stored in the MySQL
database.

Appling association rules determine potential enzyme
composition
The WEKA machine learning package [13] which is a freeware issued under the GNC General Public License was
used to mine the association rules. The enzyme class and
IPR Accs were consistently treated as items in searching for
rules that governing the enzyme composition. For example, {IPR002019, IPR002026, IPR006680, IPR011612
and EC 3.5.1.5} in O00084 were considered to be a single
transaction in the context of market basket analysis. The
data stored in the MySQL database were transformed into
the WEKA format (Fig. 1). The first line indicates which
dataset was analyzed. (In this case, the file refers to the
fungi training dataset.). The 822 lines (each headed with
'@ATTRIBUTE IPR') that followed were all individual IPR
Accs in the fungi training dataset. All the attributes were
specified only by the value of 'true' or 'false' to indicate
whether or not they were related with the given Swiss-Prot
entry. The last attribute (labeled with '@ATTRIBUTE EC')
was the classified target or class that consisted of all the
unique EC classes in the training dataset. Finally, the 3666
lines that were behind the '@DATA' label were all the
Swiss-Prot entries in the fungi training dataset used. Each
of these comprises 823 entries and was separated by a
comma. The interior 'false' value was replaced by a question mark to avoid the meaningless rules.

The Apriori [14,15] module in the WEKA package, implemented on a linux workstation, was employed to scan the
frequent itemsets and determine the associative relationships. The association rule model represents rules where a
set of items was associated with each other. For instance,
a rule could specify a certain product that was frequently

bought in combination with other products. The rules
were extracted from some large and frequently occurring
itemsets. An itemset was regarded as frequent if the possibility of its occurrence exceeded a specified minimal support criterion. The algorithm proceeds iteratively to
identify the frequent itemsets consisting of a single item.
Then, the identified frequent itemsets were expanded with
one more item to generate larger frequent itemsets. After
all the frequent itemsets were identified, the candidate
rules were screened through the following 'lift' criterion.

quency in the data set. The support of the rule was the relative frequency of transactions containing both A and B.
The lift was the related measure of strength of the association. Positive correlation was indicated by lift > 1 while
negative correlation was indicated by lift < 1. A large frequent itemsets were subdivided into smaller ones in
numerous ways to generate the candidate association
rules. The candidate association rules were redundant and
many of them were subsets of larger frequent itemsets.
However, the rules mined herein were of the form
{A,B,C}â{D} but not {A,B}â{C,D} or {A}â{B,C,D}.
For example, {IPR000873, IPR006163, IPR010080} â
{1.2.1.31}. Because most of the support values of items
were between 1 and 50, a minimum support value of
0.09% was set herein to indicate that the attribute must
appear 2.7 times in 3000 instances. The threshold of confidence was 0.6 and the corresponding lift value was
between 10 and 30.

Evaluation of the candidate rules
The criterion satisfied rules were stored in the MySQL
database for further evaluation. The testing dataset was
used to evaluate the candidate rules governing the enzyme
domain composition. Each test datum (separated by commas) was treated as a single string and matched with the
set of rules (also separated by commas and treated as a
single string) to find the corresponding EC class. The precision of EC class matching (testing dataset to rules set)
and the confidence were evaluated using the following
equations as given by Kretschmann et al. [7].
