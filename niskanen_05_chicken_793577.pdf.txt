Abstract
Background: A chicken egg contains several biotin-binding proteins (BBPs), whose complete
DNA and amino acid sequences are not known. In order to identify and characterise these genes
and proteins we studied chicken cDNAs and genes available in the NCBI database and chicken
genome database using the reported N-terminal amino acid sequences of chicken egg-yolk BBPs as
search strings.
Results: Two separate hits showing significant homology for these N-terminal sequences were
discovered. For one of these hits, the chromosomal location in the immediate proximity of the
avidin gene family was found. Both of these hits encode proteins having high sequence similarity
with avidin suggesting that chicken BBPs are paralogous to avidin family. In particular, almost all
residues corresponding to biotin binding in avidin are conserved in these putative BBP proteins.
One of the found DNA sequences, however, seems to encode a carboxy-terminal extension not
present in avidin.
Conclusion: We describe here the predicted properties of the putative BBP genes and proteins.
Our present observations link BBP genes together with avidin gene family and shed more light on
the genetic arrangement and variability of this family. In addition, comparative modelling revealed
the potential structural elements important for the functional and structural properties of the
putative BBP proteins.

Background
Chickens are known to produce several different proteins
which bind biotin in a non-covalent fashion. One of them
is avidin, which is expressed by oviduct cells upon progesterone induction and is then transferred to the egg-white
where it constitutes a minor fraction of the total protein
content of the egg-white [1]. Independently of progester-

one, avidin expression is also induced by an inflammation response in almost all of the studied chicken tissues
[2]. Another biotin-binder, called literally biotin-binding
protein (BBP), is presumably induced by estrogen [3] and
secreted from the liver into chicken plasma [4]. From
plasma, the BBP is thought to be deposited in egg-yolk [5].
In addition, Seshagiri and Adiga found another egg-white

BBP, distinct from avidin, the biochemical characteristics
of which resemble those reported for yolk BBP [6].
The affinities that avidin and yolk BBP exhibit toward
biotin are extremely high, the dissociation constant being
femtomolar for avidin [1] and picomolar for BBP [7].
According to the published data, the yolk BBP serves as a
biotin reserve for the developing embryo and hence it is
saturated with the vitamin [5]. In contrast, avidin in eggwhite is mainly found as an apoprotein and it is assumed
to function as an antimicrobial agent that harvests free
biotin from its environment [1,2]. Because of its high
affinity to biotin, avidin has long been used as a separation, labelling and targeting tool in various bioscience
fields [8].
The yolk BBP has been further characterised to consist of
two different forms, BBP-I and BBP-II [3,9]. It has been
proposed that BBP-I is the primary gene product (67 kDa)
that is converted by proteolytic cleavage to BBP-II (19
kDa) [4]. The biological function of BBP-I is believed to be
a general biotin transporter in plasma, whereas the actual
deposition role in egg-yolk is reserved for BBP-II [3]. BBPII is a tetrameric protein, like avidin, and is composed of
subunits homologous to each other. BBP-I has been
thought to be a pseudotetramer containing four binding
domains in a polypeptide chain and its gene should,
therefore, contain four subsequent repeats encoding for
similar peptide sequences [4,9]. The egg-white BBP was
also reported to exist in a large form similar to yolk BBP-I
[6]. Interestingly, some egg-laying species, such as turkeys
and alligators, showed only one type of BBP in the yolk of
their eggs [10].
Despite their similar function, some biochemical properties of BBPs and avidin are different. The pI of the chicken
yolk BBP (not defined which form) was reported to be 4.6
[7] in contrast to avidin which has a highly basic pI (≈
10.4) [1]. BBP-I exhibits higher thermostability, being
active at 60°C, whereas BBP-II is denatured at temperatures above 40°C [10]. Bush and White III have published
the N-terminal amino acid sequences for both chicken
yolk BBP forms, which are highly similar to each other
and also resemble the avidin N-terminal sequence [4,10].
BBP-I has been proposed to be a glycoprotein [7] whereas
BBP-II is shown to be nonglycosylated [10]. Avidin is
known to contain one N-linked carbohydrate moiety per
subunit [1]. Differences in the radiobiotin exchange rates
between these two BBP forms have also been observed:
BBP-I showed slower exchange than BBP-II [10].
The published N-terminal sequences, the similar overall
sizes of the proteins and the tetrameric appearance of
BBP-II as well as the reported high biotin-binding affinities suggest that the BBPs could be related to avidin. Struc-

turally and functionally, avidin is considered to be a
member of the larger protein superfamily called calycins
[11]. These proteins form a large and divergent family of
relatively small extracellular proteins which typically bind
small hydrophobic ligands. Two particular groups of calycin protein family, the lipocalins and avidins, are β-barrels
composed of eight antiparallel β-strands. The ligand is
bound inside the protein at one end of the β-barrel [12].
An interesting feature among the lipocalins and avidins is
a structural signature wherein a conserved basic amino
acid residue, close to the last β-strand, packs over a specific
tryptophan residue on the first β-strand and forms hydrogen bonds with the short 310 helix prior to the first βstrand [11].
Because the genes, genomic locations, cDNAs or full
amino acid sequences of chicken BBPs are not known, it
is impossible to evaluate their true relationship to avidin
or, in a broader sense, to the calycin protein superfamily.
New hope to solve this enigma aroused when the first
draft of the chicken genome was published in March 2004
[13,14]. In addition to the genome project, a comprehensive collection of chicken cDNAs is also in progress [15].
In the current study we searched these databases in order
to find the cDNAs and genes for BBPs. Indeed, we found
two independent cDNAs whose translated amino acid
sequences fitted well to the published N-terminal
sequences of BBPs. The genomic fragments corresponding
to these cDNAs were also identified and analysed. They
showed features similar to those of the avidin gene family
members. Interestingly, one of these BBP gene candidates
is located together with the avidin gene family in the
chicken chromosome Z [16]. In addition, more evidence
supporting the previous hypothesis of the high recombination frequency in the avidin gene family is gathered.
One of the two putative BBPs was found to significantly
resemble avidin, showing a theoretical molecular mass
and pI close to those of avidin, whereas the other showed
theoretical characteristics fitting more closely to those
published for BBPs. Almost all amino acids important for
biotin binding in avidin [17] are conserved in both of
these supposed BBPs. Neither of the found cDNAs/genes,
however, encodes a protein composed of four similar
domains as expected for the isolated pseudotetrameric
BBP-I [3]. Instead, the encoded proteins show calculated
molecular masses corresponding to one BBP domain per
polypeptide. In silico analysis of these genes as well as
modelled structures of the putative BBP proteins are
presented.

Schematic presentation of the genomic locations and orientations of the genes
Schematic presentation of the genomic locations and orientations of the genes. The genomic location of the BBP-B
gene is unknown, whereas contigs 166.108-111 reside in the Z-chromosome as schematically shown in lower part of the picture. According to previous studies, the most probable location is in the q21 telomeric region of the Z-chromosome (Alhroth
et al., 2000).

query sequences. The public accession codes for these hits
are [GenBank:BX930135], [GenBank:BX932076] and
[GenBank:BX936151]. However, detailed analyses suggest that one of the hit sequences, [GenBank:BX932076],
is identical to sequence [GenBank:BX936151] but differentially spliced (first intron being present). The reason for
that might be a non-mature cDNA clone obtained during
the cDNA library preparation [15]. The two other hits,
[GenBank:BX930135] and [GenBank:BX936151] were
therefore chosen for further analysis (Table 1). For clarity
these two sequences are called BBP-A [GenBank:BX930135] and BBP-B [GenBank:BX936151].

The gene containing the fully identical sequence to BBP-A
cDNA with three introns was found in chicken genome
database in Contig166.108. Two contig-sequences
(Contig55972.2 and Contig26844.1) containing parts of
BBP-B were found in the database. These were manually
joined together (Figure 1). The final product contained
five changes in the nucleotide sequence when compared
to BBP-B cDNA ([GenBank:BX936151]), causing differences in three amino acid residues close to the C-terminal
part of the protein (N118I, V119L, F120L). The avidin
gene and three avidinrelated genes were also found from
the chicken genome database. The gene of BBP-A and a
novel allele of one of the previously cloned AVRs (or a
novel avidin-related gene), which we named AVR-A were

and AVD/AVRs, respectively. The number of variable sites
among the exons ranged from 25% (fourth exons) to 58%
(second exons). The first intron is similar in size in all
compared sequences, whereas the second intron is considerably longer in the avidin and AVR genes (about 425 bp)
than in the BBP genes (175 bp in BBP-A and 114 bp in
BBP-B). On the contrary, the third intron is longer in the
BBP-B gene (252 bp) than in the avidin/AVR genes (87
bp) (Figure 2). The number of variable sites among intron
sequences ranged from 24% in the third intron to 59% in
the first intron.

found in the same Contig166.108. AVR-A was similar to
AVR2 and AVR6 (Figure 4) [16]. BBP-A and AVR-A genes
point towards each other (BBP-A→ ←AVR-A) separated
by an intergenic distance of 8.1 kB. A chicken repeat 1
(CR1) element [18] was found between these two genes.
The distance between AVR-A and CR1 was 0.6 kB while
the distance between the BBP-A gene and CR1 element
was 6.1 kB. CR1 pointed towards BBP-A and it was in parallel orientation with AVR-A. Previously, Wallén et al.
have reported CR1 elements located 1.4–2.1 kB upstream
from the 5'-ends of AVR4 and AVR5 genes and pointing
towards the genes [19]. Contig166.109 contains a partial
gene (named AVR-B) clearly resembling AVR4. However,
it has a mutation that converts Phe-29 in the AVR4 protein
to leucine. In addition, Contig166.110 contains a partial
gene (named AVR-C) resembling AVR2 with the exception
that it codes for Ser and Arg in positions 25 and 26 (as in
avidin) instead of Asp and Asn found in AVR2 (Figure 4).
Finally, Contig166.111 contains the avidin gene (Figure
1).
Alignment of BBP cDNAs with their corresponding DNA
contig sequences revealed that both of these genes contain
four exons and three introns, as shown for avidin and avidin-related genes [20]. The exon and intron lengths of the
BBP genes and their comparison with the avidin gene
structure are shown in Figure 2. The fourth exons are cut
after the stop-codon, and the first exons (N-terminus) are
cleaved before the ATG starting open reading frame. The
sizes of the exons are relatively similar with the exception
of the fourth exon of BBP-B which encodes 96 amino
acids residues, compared to the 30–42 residues in BBP-A

A high similarity among the genes was observed at the
exon/intron junctions as shown in Figure 2. Sequence
divergence (p-distance) among avidin and BBP genes
ranged from 1.4% between AVR4 and AVR-B and 48.5%
between AVR-B and BBP-B (Table 2). Similar values were
obtained when sequence divergence among exons only or
introns only (the combined sequence) were analysed (not
shown).
The phylogenetic relationship of the AVD, AVRs and
biotin-binding protein genes is shown graphically in Figure 3 (the same relationships were obtained from the
amino acid sequences; not shown). In the unrooted tree,
avidin and avidin related genes formed a well supported
cluster, which was the sister group of BBP-A. Finally, basal
to the tree, was BBP-B.
All characterised genes contained a potential promoter
region upstream of the coding region according to prediction program used. In the case of AVR-C, the upstream
region of the gene was not analysed due to a missing
sequence. The promoters of BBP-A and BBP-B contained a
TATA sequence TATAAA at position (-30)-(-25) nt
upstream of the predicted transcription initiation site. In
the case of the AVD and AVR-A/B genes, the sequence
AATAAAA was detected (-31)-(-25) nt upstream of the
predicted transcription initiation site. The putative promoter regions contained possible binding sites for several
transcription factors (not shown).
Amino acid primary sequence characteristics
The most obvious difference between the BBP-B, when
compared to avidin and BBP-A, is a C-terminal extension
which makes it 18 residues longer than avidin and 22 residues longer than BBP-A. The sequence identity between
BBP-A and BBP-B is 49%. The identity between the
aligned regions of chicken avidin and BBP-A is 59% and
between BBP-B and avidin is 47%. The residues involved
in biotin binding in avidin [17] are almost perfectly conserved in both the BBP-forms (Figure 4). The only substitutions within these residues are Ser-73 which is replaced
with alanine in BBP-A and Ser-75 which is replaced with
alanine in BBP-B. Moreover, the T-A-T sequence in avidin

The SignalP signal prediction program suggested the presence of signal peptide in BBP-A at residues (-21)-(-1)
(numbering according to sequence alignment, Figure 4)

and a cleavage site at position 1/2. Similarly, a signal peptide composed of residues (-21)-(-2) and a cleavage site in
position 2/3 [21] or -2/-1 (hidden Markov model [22])
was predicted for BBP-B. It seems, therefore, that these
putative BBPs are secreted proteins like avidin [1].
Both BBPs have one possible N-glycosylation site being
17Asn-Met-Thr-Ile20 for BBP-A (identical to avidin) and
74Asn-Ala-Thr-Thr77 for BBP-B. The prediction shows,
however, a low probability for glycosylation to occur in
BBP-B.
The cysteine residues (Cys-4 and Cys-83) which form the
intrasubunit disulphide bridge in avidin are conserved in
both BBPs. In addition, two cysteine residues are found in
the putative signal sequence of BBP-A and one in the signal sequence of BBP-B. Furthermore, there are two
additional cysteines in BBP-B, one in the position corresponding to Glu-43 in avidin and one located in the middle of its C-terminal extension.
The aromatic amino acids are conserved throughout the
sequences. The only exceptions are the two tryptophans
found only in BBP-B in the region corresponding to βsheet 5 in avidin.
Secondary and tertiary structure characteristics based on
the homology modelling
The residues in BBP proteins corresponding to the β-sheet
secondary structure elements of avidin are significantly
more conserved when compared to the loop regions of
avidin.

Overall, the homology modelling strongly suggests avidin-like secondary (Figure 4) and tertiary (Figure 5) structures for both BBPs.
Based on the modelled structures, both BBPs have the
common lipocalin-motif: Gly-Xaa-Trp residues close to
the N-terminus (residues 8–10 in alignment) and arginine
in the last β-strand. This structural signature indicates that
BBPs belong to the calycin superfamily together with avidin and streptavidin (which is a bacterial analogue of
chicken avidin) [12].
At the tertiary structure level the most striking feature of
the BBPs, when compared to avidin, is the conservation of
the amino acid residues forming the inner part of the βbarrel. These amino acids also include almost all biotinbinding contact residues (Figures 5F, 5G). The hydrogen
bond between biotin and Asp-128 in streptavidin [23],
and biotin and the analogous residue Asn-118 in avidin
(Hytönen VP et al., unpublished results), are known to be
important for their ligand binding. The bonding network
including this residue comprises bonds between Gln-24

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/41

and Asp-128 in streptavidin [24] and Asn-118 and Asp-13
in avidin [17]. The residue corresponding to Asn-118 in
avidin is conserved in both BBPs.
The role of the C-terminal extension of BBP-B was hypothesised by modelling. Since there is an orphan cysteine residue near the end of β-strand 4 in BBP-B and another
cysteine residue close the end of the C-terminal extension,
one could assume a disulphide bridge between these
cysteines. Several details support this possibility. Firstly,
the region close to the cysteine residue in β-strand 4 in
BBP-B seems to be rather hydrophobic (K9L, N17L, T34L,
E46I), in comparison with the corresponding region in
avidin. This might indicate a presence of a shielding structure in this region (i.e. contact to another protein or
peptide) (Figure 5C). Secondly, the distance between the
end of β-strand 8 and the cysteine in β-strand 4 is in good
agreement with the length of the polypeptide sequence.
Thirdly, similar structures are found in structurally similar
lipocalin family proteins. For example, retinol-binding
protein (PDB code: 1RBP) has a similar α-helix connected
by a disulphide bridge in corresponding region [25].
Quaternary structure: interface-regions
All residues forming the 1–2 interface (numbering according to Livnah et al. [17]) in avidin are conserved in all of
the studied proteins (Table 3). The 1–4 interface, being
the most extensive, shows interesting similarities and differences when compared to that of avidin. Residues Gln53, Thr-67, Trp-70, Gln-82, Val-103 and Thr-113 in this
interface are conserved in all of the studied proteins. Asn54 in the 1–4 interface has been shown to have a central
role in the structurally important hydrogen-bonding network in the avidin structure [17,26]. Interestingly, histidine is found in this position in the AVR-proteins, which
are known to be stable tetramers [27,28]. Glutamine in
this position in the BBP model-structures seems to be able
to form similar contacts between the subunits over the 1–
4 interface. Taken together, only 10 out of 21 interacting
residues in the 1–4 interface are conserved in BBP-A when
compared to avidin, with the value being 8 out of 21 in
BBP-B.

In the 1–3 interface, Val-115 is conserved, whereas both
Met-96 and Ile-117 show variance both in BBPs and AVRs.
The position of Met-96 shows interesting substitutions in
other proteins since this residue faces the identical residue
from the neighbouring subunit in avidin structure.
According to previous mutagenesis studies this residue is
known to be important for the tetrameric quaternary
structure of avidin [26,29]. According to the model structure, Arg-117 in BBP-B might form an interesting intersubunit salt bridge with Glu-13 from subunit 3.

Discussion
The circumstantial evidence has indicated that chicken
yolk BBPs may be structurally related to avidin and other
members of the avidin family. Therefore we were eager to
scan the chicken genome data to evaluate the correctness

of this hypothesis. The database queries revealed two
independent hits showing high similarity to the published N-terminal sequences of yolk BBPs I and II [4] and,
indeed, a potential kinship between BBPs and avidin gene
family members was revealed.

The avidin gene belongs to the gene family that has several
other members called AVRs (avidin related genes). Previously, seven different AVR-genes have been cloned
[16,20] and the chromosomal location of this gene family
has been tracked down to a relatively short region in the
telomeric region q21 of the chicken sex chromosome Z
[16]. It seems that the number of AVR genes varies
between individual chickens and even between cells
within the same chicken [30]. The deposited genome
data, analysed in the present study, support this
observation demonstrating a novel assembly of 3 AVR
genes together in the same cluster with the avidin gene.
Interestingly, the two AVR genes found in the chicken
genome database seem to be novel variants of the formerly cloned AVRs, which also support the previous
hypothesis of the high recombination frequency within
the avidin gene family [30,31].
Our observations link the BBPs to the avidin family for the
first time, at the cDNA and gene level. There are many
independent features indicating this. Firstly, the found
cDNAs encode proteins that are evidently homologous to
avidin. Secondly, the genomic location of the BBP-A gene
close to the avidin gene family supports their relationship.
Finally, the exon/intron structures of the BBP genes and
avidin family genes are similar to each other.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/41

presumed interface residue patterns were highly similar to
those of AVRs, which are also known to form extremely
stable tetramers [27,28]. The 1–2 interface, in particular,
in which mutations have previously been shown to be
extremely important to the stability properties of both avidin and streptavidin [32-34], was perfectly conserved in
both BBPs. Hence the existing changes were concentrated
on the 1–3 and 1–4 interfaces which are known to tolerate
substitutions in avidin and AVRs [27-29]. The yolk BBPs
have, however, been reported to be clearly less heat-stable
than avidin [10] and, therefore either the sequence differences in the interfaces may explain this difference or the
tertiary structure of the BBP barrel may be weaker than
that of avidin. Overall, interfaces in the BBP models suggested tetramer formation, since the putative interface
regions were hydrophobic. Furthermore, differences at the
subunit interfaces of the BBP models, when compared to
those of avidin, were at least partially complementary. For
example the Thr-80-Val mutation at the 1–4 interface of
BBP-A seemed to be in a highly hydrophobic
environment.

According to molecular modelling, BBP-A and B proteins
both showed features that make them suitable for biotin
binding. The biotin-binding contact amino acids of avidin
[17] were almost perfectly conserved in both BBP
sequences. In addition, good conservation of the inner
part of the β-barrel in both BBPs is also important for the
function of the ligand binding cavity. If we assume that
one or both of these putative BBPs represent yolk BBPs I
and/or II, other sequence differences should explain their
observed weaker dissociation constant for biotin [7]. Similar observation has been done for AVRs which have only
a few differences in their biotin-binding residues when
compared to avidin, but still exhibit remarkable differences in their biotin-binding affinities [27].

The most striking feature that distinguished BBP-B from
avidin and BBP-A was its extraneous, approximately 20
amino acid residue-long, C-terminal extension. According
to modelling, this stretch could form an α-helix and the
cysteine residue at the end of this stretch could form a
disulphide bridge with another cysteine residue in βstrand 4 (Figure 5C). It is, however, hard to interpret the
relevance of this predicted α-helix and the possible effect
of the helix and the cysteine bridge to the structural and
functional properties of BBP-B. One effect could be that it
strengthens the structure of the protein. Interestingly,
many members of the lipocalin protein family have similar C-terminal α-helical domains [11,12]. Nonetheless,
the exon/intron structure of the avidin gene family is different when compared to the lipocalin family [35,36].
This suggests that even if the overall tertiary structures of
these proteins are similar, the evolutionary distance
between these lineages is overwhelmingly long, or alternatively these protein families have been developed independently. The manner in which BBP-B has acquired its Cterminal extension, found in lipocalins, remains therefore
an enigma. Alternative models for this extension can be
done as well; the distance between the beginning of C-terminal extension (Lys-123) of the subunit 1 and the free
cysteine in loop 3 of the subunits 3 and subunit 4 is
around 40 A (not shown). This is also approximately the
length of the fully extended C-terminal extension (Lys123-Cys-138). Based on these distances both 1–3 and 1–
4 intersubunit disulphide-bridges are possible.

It is probable that both BBP-A and BBP-B form similar
tetrameric quaternary structures as avidin. The basis for
this assumption is the fact that the conservation of the

In the light of the current study, the story of the chicken
BBP proteins gets blurred. As before, we have two possible
candidates. However, these cDNAs/genes are able to

According to the phylogenetic relationships and genome
locations of the genes, one scenario for the BBP/avidin
evolution is as follow: an initial duplication may have
occurred leading to the origin of BBP-B and the precursor
of the BBP-A/avidin family, followed by a further duplication leading to the origin of BBP-A and the precursor of the
avidin family. This could have been followed by the
formation of AVD and an AVR gene and finally the duplication of the latter in several avidin-related genes.

encode proteins having molecular mass of 14–16.5 kDa,
which correspond to only one BBP subunit instead of the
four subsequent repeats hypothesized earlier [3,9]. This
means that either the database still lacks the genuine yolkBBP gene or that some other phenomenon, like the
abovementioned hypothetical disulphide bridges, must
explain the previously reported molecular weight properties of BBP-I. Nonetheless, the fact that cDNAs for BBP-A
and BBP-B were isolated from the chicken liver library
[15], and that the putative proteins they encode have signal sequences, suggest that these cDNAs may really be the
yolk BBP cDNAs, which have been reported to be secreted
from the liver into the egg [4].
If we try to fit the characteristics of the found BBP candidates to those previously associated with BBPs, BBP-B
looks more promising. It has similar low pI [7], its C-terminal extension makes its molecular mass closer to that
determined for BBP-II [10] and it is most probably nonglycosylated as is BBP-II [10]. What is then the role of the
BBP-A gene? Is it the mysterious BBP isolated from eggwhite [6] or some unknown chicken BBP? It is evident that
we need to continue the database queries and/or start
cloning BBP genes to clarify this puzzle. In addition, we
need to produce these found putative BBPs as recombinant proteins to investigate whether their properties are
in agreement with the previous findings and the models
of the present study. Furthermore, these new proteins can
serve as a source for development of new tools for life
sciences.
For example, it could be possible to construct a chimeric
avidin-BBP-dimer [37] to adjust the ligand-binding properties of the resultant hybrid protein.

Conclusion
We have identified two putative genes and cDNAs for
chicken egg-yolk biotin-binding proteins from NCBI database and chicken genome database. The genomic location
and the structures of the found genes and the proteins
they encode link clearly BBPs to the avidin family and,
moreover, give an insight to the evolutionary history of
this gene family. Our molecular modelling results support
many preceding observations concerning the biochemical
properties of BBPs but also impugn some of the previous
hypothesis. Most importantly, the gene/cDNA structures
provided no evidences of proteolytic processing of pseudotetramers to tetramers that has been presented as a possible maturation process for BBPs, i.e. conversion of BBPI to BBP-II.

Database queries and sequence analyses
The N-terminal sequences VEIKXQLSGLWENEQDSLMEISALADDGG and VERKXQLSGLWENEQDSLMEIS-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/41

ALADDLEN [4] were used to search the deposited
collection of chicken cDNAs [15] by using TBlastn at the
NCBI web site. The obtained cDNA sequences were used
to find the corresponding genes and their genomic locations by searching the chicken genome database at the
Ensembl web site [38] using blastn. Furthermore, cDNA
of avidin [39] and AVRs [16] were used as search strings
from this database. The intron/exon structures of these
putative genes were analyzed. DNA sequences of AVD,
AVR2, AVR4, AVR6, AVR-A, AVR-B, AVR-C and BBP-A and
BBP-B were aligned exon by exon and intron by intron
using Clustal X in multiple alignment mode with default
values for both pairwise and multiple alignment parameters. Relationships among avidin and other biotin-binding proteins were obtained by the Neighbour Joining
method from the p-distance matrix as implemented in
Mega software [40]. The Dragon Promoter Finder v. 1.5
[41] was used to predict the promoter regions of the
genes. The located promoter regions were further characterised using the transcription factor analysis implemented in the Dragon Promoter Finder program using
Match™ [42] with default parameters.
Structural modelling and polypeptide analysis
The three-dimensional structure of the avidin-biotin complex (PDB code: 2avi [17]) obtained from the Protein
Data Bank [43] was used as a template structure in BBP
modelling. Sequence alignment of all proteins was made
using the MALIGN [44] multiple alignment tool of
BODIL [45,46] by using a structure-based sequence comparison matrix [47] with a gap penalty of 40. Comparative
models of BBPs were made with Modeller 6v2 [48]
according to alignment: disulphide bridges were forced
between cysteine residues 3 and 83 in both BBPs and also
between cysteine residues 43 and 138 in BBP-B. Furthermore, carboxy-terminal extension of BBP-B (amino acids
129–137) was forced to adopt α-helix conformation. Visual analysis of obtained models was done with the BODIL
molecular modelling program. Alignment representation
was made using ALSCRIPT [49] and protein representations were made using PyMOL [50]. The putative signal
cleavage sites were analyzed by SignalP [21,51]. The theoretical molecular weights, pIs and extinction coefficients
were calculated using the program ProtParam [52,53]. The
potential N-glycosylation sites and their qualities were
studied by NetNglyc [54].
