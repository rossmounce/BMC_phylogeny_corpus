Abstract
Background: Independently evolving lineages mostly accumulate different changes, which leads to
their gradual divergence. However, parallel accumulation of identical changes is also common,
especially in traits with only a small number of possible states.
Results: We characterize parallelism in evolution of coding sequences in three four-species sets
of genomes of mammals, Drosophila, and yeasts. Each such set contains two independent
evolutionary paths, which we call paths I and II. An amino acid replacement which occurred along
path I also occurs along path II with the probability 50–80% of that expected under selective
neutrality. Thus, the per site rate of parallel evolution of proteins is several times higher than their
average rate of evolution, but still lower than the rate of evolution of neutral sequences. This deficit
may be caused by changes in the fitness landscape, leading to a replacement being possible along
path I but not along path II. However, constant, weak selection assumed by the nearly neutral
model of evolution appears to be a more likely explanation. Then, the average coefficient of
selection associated with an amino acid replacement, in the units of the effective population size,
must exceed ~0.4, and the fraction of effectively neutral replacements must be below ~30%. At a
majority of evolvable amino acid sites, only a relatively small number of different amino acids is
permitted.
Conclusion: High, but below-neutral, rates of parallel amino acid replacements suggest that a
majority of amino acid replacements that occur in evolution are subject to weak, but non-trivial,
selection, as predicted by Ohta's nearly-neutral theory.

Analysis of alignments
Phylogenetic trees used in our analysis are shown in Fig.
1. Evolutionary paths connecting human and dog, D.
yakuba and D. erecta, and S. bayanus and S. mikatae are
treated as "paths I", and mouse-rat, D. melanogaster-D.
simulans, and S. cerevisiae-S. paradoxus paths, which are the
shortest in the respective trees, are "paths II". If the two
species connected by path I, and the two species connected by path II, display the same amino acid difference
at the same site (say, amino acid A in one species from
each pair, and amino acid B in the other species from each
pair), parsimony implies that the same unordered amino
acid replacement (A↔B) occurred along both paths I and
II. In the case of Drosophila tree, with ((D. yakuba, D.
erecta), (D. melanogaster, D. simulans)) topology (Fig. 1),
we can be sure that replacements along both paths were
parallel, i. e., occurred in the same direction (either A→B
or B→A), although determining this direction is not possible. In the case of mammalian or yeast trees, replacements along path I and path II may also occur in the
opposite directions, thus constituting a reversal; for example, a site with A in dog and rat and B in human and
mouse can emerge due to A→B replacement in the lineage
that led to the common ancestor of human, mouse, and
rat, followed by B→A replacement in the rat lineage. However, the contribution of reversals should be relatively
small, because the edge connecting nodes where dog and
human lineages (or S. bayanus and S. mikatae lineages)
branch off is rather short [8,9].

Background
Although evolution is primarily divergent, parallel, convergent, and reversing changes in independently evolving
lineages, collectively known as homoplasy, are not
uncommon [1]. In particular, homoplasy should be pervasive when evolution is considered at the level of DNA or
protein sequences, because there are only 4 or 20 possible
states for each site. When evolving sequences become sufficiently dissimilar, homoplasious changes prevent their
further divergence, leading to evolutionary saturation [2]
and interfering with phylogenetic reconstructions [3]. Several instances of rapid parallel evolution of similar proteins, apparently driven by positive selection, have been
observed (e. g., [4,5]). However, contribution of parallel
changes to independent evolution of similar proteins has
not been investigated quantitatively at the genomic scale.
Data on parallel amino acid replacements in proteins can
shed light on several key aspects of their evolution. In particular, because the per site rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions dN is, on average, ~10 times smaller
than the per site rate of synonymous substitutions dS, a
vast majority of amino acids must be, most of the time,
under substantial negative selection [2,6]. Still, neutral
theory claims that most of amino acid replacements
which occur in evolution are selectively neutral and, thus,
must accumulate at the same rate as synonymous substitutions [6,7], as long as the latter are approximately
assumed to be selectively neutral. The postulated relatively small proportion of rapidly evolving non-synonymous sites can be investigted using data on parallel
evolution of proteins.
The minimal number of diverging sequences which
makes it possible to study parallel evolution is four,
because the phylogenetic tree must contain at least two
nonoverlapping evolutionary paths, I and II. Here, we use
sequences of three quadruplets of closely related genomes
from mammals, fruit flies Drosophila, and yeasts Saccharomyces, and consider parallel evolution in these quadruplets at the level of all known proteins encoded by a
genome. We define the rate of parallel evolution along
path II as the rate with which allele replacements of a particular kind accumulated along this path, provided that
the same replacements did occur, at the orthologous loci,
along path I, and measure this rate for various kinds of
amino acid replacements.

Informally, replacements along path I mark evolvable
sites, and replacements, at these sites, along path II tell us
how such evolvable sites evolve. Data on rates of parallel,
and of coincident divergent, evolution of proteins are presented in Tables 1, 2, 3. In agreement with the previous
estimates [10-12], the overall rate of nonsynonymous
substitutions is ~10% of the rate of synonymous substitutions. In contrast, the average rate P of parallel nonsynonymous substitutions is much higher and constitutes ~50%
(yeast), ~60% (mammals) or ~80% (Drosophila) of the
rate of parallel synonymous substitutions. Assuming that
the fitness landscape for an amino acid site did not change
in the course of evolution represented by each tree, we can
draw a number of conclusions from this figure.
Variability among individual sites
Let us assume that only two alleles (amino acid variants)
are possible at a locus (site). The selection coefficient associated with this pair of alleles is s = 1 - w1/w2, where w1
and w2 are constant fitnesses conferred by the two alleles
(w1 < w2). Naturally, s can vary between 1 (lethality of the
inferior allele) and 0 (selective neutrality). Under given
parameters of mutation and the effective population size

switches between fixations of the two alleles, is determined by s: v = f(s). When s is large enough (>>Ne -1), the
site is usually occupied by the best allele, and negative
selection prevents fixation of the inferior allele. In contrast, when s < Ne -1, either allele can be fixed at given
moment. Assuming that the rates of forward and backward mutation are equal, v is the highest, and equals to
the rate of neutral evolution M, with s = 0, and monotonously approaches 0 when s increases ([6,13]; Fig. 2).
Consideration of only two alleles, involved in the
observed parallel replacement, is sufficient because the
ratio of frequencies of any two alleles under mutationselection-drift equilibrium does not depend on fitnesses
of any other possible alleles, as at such equilibrium the
reciprocal fluxes of allele replacements are always equal
[13].
Let us characterize all protein sites by their distributions of
s, p(s), and of v, q(v). Then, q(v) = p(f-1(v)), where f-1 is a
function which relates s to the rate of evolution: s = f-1(v).
The average rate of evolution at all sites is (all integrals are
taken from 0 to 1)
C = ∫p(s)f(s)ds = ∫vq(v)dv

(1)

The distribution of s within sites where parallel evolution
took place, i. e. the same replacement occurred along both
short paths I and II, is given not by p(s) per se, but by p'(s)
= p(s)f(s)/C, because the probability that a replacement
occurred along path I is proportional to the rate of evolu-

What does knowledge of P (say, 0.7; here and below P is
given in the units of rate of neutral evolution M) tell us
about p(s) or q(v)? The simplest option is that q'(v) and,
thus, its "parent" distribution q(v), is concentrated at P =
0.7, and p(s) is concentrated at s0 = f-1(0.7) ~1.5/(4Ne)
(Fig. 3). Of course, this cannot be the case, since different
amino acid sites evolve at widely different rates [6]. Thus,
the average value of s at sites of parallel evolution, S =
∫p'(s)sds, must be higher than f-1(P), because sites with
above-average selection coefficients make smaller contributions to evolution than sites with below-average selection coefficients (Fig. 2). Assuming any particular shape of
p(s) (e. g., that p(s) is a gamma-distribution with a particular shape parameter; [14]), we can calculate S which corresponds to the observed P.
Moreover, we can estimate the maximal fraction of effectively neutral sites (those evolving at essentially neutral
rate 1) consistent with a given P. Indeed, the contribution
of a site with some v = v0 to the reduction of P is (P-v0)v0.
This contribution is maximal when d [(P-v)v]/dv = 0, i. e.
when v0 = 0.5P. Thus, the fraction x of neutrally evolving
sites is maximal, under a given P, when there are only two
kinds of sites, those evolving with rates 1 and 0.5P. The
average rate of evolution with such a q(v), [x+(1-x)P2/4]/
[x+(1-x)P/2)], equals P when x = (P/(2-P))2. Thus, when P
= 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5, the maximal possible fraction
of effective neutral sites is 0.67, 0.44, 0.30, 0.18, and 0.11,
respectively (Fig. 3). Of course, in reality this fraction
must be lower, since p(s) and q(v) are not concentrated at
just two points.

Discussion
Patterns in parallel evolution
Our data show that rate of parallel evolution of coding
sequences is elevated: the probability of a change along
path II is above-average at sites where the same nucleotide
change also occurred along path I. This is the case even for
synonymous substitutions: a synonymous substitution
along path II is ~20% more probable when the same substitution also occurred along path I (Tables 1, 2, 3). As far
as synonymous substitutions are concerned, betweensites heterogeneity of mutation rates and/or of the
strength of selection can lead to the difference observed.
Both mechanisms are feasible, because mutation rate varies between nucleotide sites [15] and because synonymous sites are not exactly neutral [16], and they are not
mutually exclusive, but we did not attempt to determine
their relative importance. The rate of parallel synonymous

mous evolution, but still higher than the average rate of
all nonsynonymous substitutions (Tables 1, 2, 3).

The rate of parallel nonsynonymous substitutions P is elevated to a much larger extent than that of synonymous
substitutions. Indeed, in the units of the rate of neutral
evolution M, the average rate of all nonsynonymous substitutions is only ~0.1, but P is 0.5–0.8 (Tables 1, 2, 3).
The sign of this difference is as expected: because rates of
nonsynonymous substitutions are strongly heterogeneous
across sites [6,17], a replacement observed along path I
must be a good predictor of the probability of a replacement, at the same site, along path II. P is higher for rapidly
evolving proteins or when a replacement involves two
chemically similar amino acids. The rate of coincident
divergent evolution, such that an amino acid replacement
A↔C occurred along path II at an amino acid site where
an amino acid replacement A↔B occurred along path I, is
always much lower than the rate of parallel nonsynony-

Patterns in parallel evolution of proteins specifically
reveal properties of only evolvable nonsynonymous sites.
Indeed, the low overall rate of protein evolution implies
that ~90% of all new nonsynonymous mutations are
rejected by negative selection, but tells us little about sites
where nonsynonymous substitutions do occur. In principle, if we assume that selection is constant, distributions
p'(s) and q'(v), which characterize evolvable sites, can be
derived from p(s), because f(s) is known theoretically
(Fig. 2). However, this is currently impossible, because
our data on p(s) are too crude. In fact, p'(s) depends only
on the left tail of p(s), roughly corresponding to 4Nes < 10
(as sites under stronger selection do not evolve), and we
know that this tail contains 10–20% of the distribution
[18,19], but nothing definite about its shape. It is sometimes assumed that p(s) [14], as well as q(v) [20], are

observed, sites under such selection are rather rare, at least
in mammalian genomes [22].

Selection at evolvable sites
The best way to make sense of the data presented in Tables
1, 2, 3 is to consider possible reasons for a relatively small
deviation of the average rate of parallel protein evolution
P from the rate of neutral evolution M. Indeed, according
to the neutral theory [6,7], most of accepted amino acid
replacements are neutral, and in this case the two rates
should coincide. The difference between P and M could be
due to either variable or constant selection.

Thus, P < 1 is not surprising, and can be due to both variable and constant selection. If fitness landscapes are different along paths I and II, some replacements permitted
along path I are forbidden along path II. In the extreme
case of independent landscapes along the two paths, the
rate of parallel evolution would not be elevated at all. In
contrast to the case of P > 1, a single change of the fitness
landscape, somewhere between paths I and II, is perfectly
sufficient to explain P < 1.

Variable fitness landscape
The only feasible scenario which could lead to P > 1 is positive selection caused by multiple changes in the fitness
landscape. Only in this case can positive selection drive
parallel replacements along both paths I and II. Indeed,
two selection-driven parallel replacements can hardly be
caused by a single change in the fitness landscape in the
common ancestor of all the 4 species (Fig. 1), because a
replacement must follow such a change with only a relatively short delay [6]. Therefore, at least two independent
changes in the fitness landscape are necessary for parallelism – one in each lineage. Although rapidly fluctuating
selection, resulting in dN > dS [21] and in parallel evolution ([4] and references therein) has been repeatedly

A permitted replacement along path I can be either effectively neutral or driven by substantial positive selection.
Two observations make the first option unlikely. Temporarily available opportunities for neutral evolution have
been described by the covarion model [23], which
assumes that selection at an amino acid site switches on
and off as a result of amino acid substitutions elsewhere
in the protein. Because the environment of an amino acid
site is more stable within a slowly-evolving protein, covarion provides the least opportunity for path-specific neutrality and should lead to the smallest reduction of P in
such proteins. However, we observed exactly the opposite:
P was the lowest in proteins with low dN (Tables 1, 2, 3).
Further, the evolutionary distance between paths I and II

Table is analogous to Table 1.

is much larger in the mammalian phylogeny than in the
other two phylogenies (Fig. 1), which should lead to more
on and off switches of selective constraint between the
paths and, therefore, to stronger reduction in P in mammals. However, P is the lowest in yeasts, and not in mammals.
In contrast, the deepest reduction of P in slowly-evolving
proteins is consistent with the hypothesis that positive
selection plays a larger role in the evolution of slowlyevolving sites [24]. Still, it is hard to imagine that > 50%
of all amino-acid replacements accepted by slowly-evolving proteins were adaptive, and this assumption is necessary to explain P < 0.5 in such proteins (Tables 1, 2, 3)
through path-specific positive selection. Also, it seems
implausible that changes of the fitness landscape favor
radical replacements more frequently than conservative
replacements, and the reduction in P is the strongest for
substitutions which radically change the amino acid
(Tables 1, 2, 3). Finally, the lowest rate of coincident
divergent evolution, relative to P, in slowly-evolving proteins (Tables 1, 2, 3) implies that in such proteins the
same pair of amino acids most often confers the two highest fitnesses along the whole phylogenetic tree, which
appears to be inconsistent with frequent changes of the
fitness landscape, unless such changes usually do not
affect which two amino acids are the best.
Constant fitness landscape
The simpler assumption of constant selection seems to
provide a more plausible explanation for the patterns

observed. P < 1 is always expected if the two amino acids
involved in the substitution are under constant selection
(Fig. 2), as long as mutation is symmetric (see [16]). P =
0.7 is consistent with the average selection coefficient
associated with an accepted amino acid replacement
being 1.5/(4Ne) = 0.375Ne -1 or more, and with the fraction of strictly neutral replacements being ~30% or less. In
fact, selection on accepted replacements is probably even
stronger, because we underestimated the rate of neutral
evolution, which in mammals is ~10% higher, at nonCpG-prone sites, than the rate of synonymous evolution
[16].
Thus, our data on parallel evolution of proteins suggest
that a majority of amino acid replacements occur at sites
which are not effectively neutral, but experience weak
selection, in agreement with the nearly-neutral theory
[25,26]. The highest P for replacements which involve the
most chemically similar pairs of amino acids (Tables 1, 2,
3) is also consistent with this explanation, because such
replacements must be under weaker selection than radical
replacements.
If evolving lineages are at mutation-selection-drift equilibrium, the overall numbers of slightly deleterious and
slightly beneficial replacements must be equal, although
at a given moment a site is more often occupied by a
(slightly) superior allele and, thus, is more often under
negative selection. Still, at any moment, the fraction of
amino acid sites occupied by slightly inferior amino acids
must be well above ~10% of all evolvable protein sites

more likely to be permitted as well. The number of permitted amino acids is known to vary widely across amino
acid sites [28,29], and different sets of amino acids are
permitted at different sites [30,31]. Data on parallel evolution, preferably along many independent paths, can be
used to further investigate such sets.

(Fig. 2) and, thus, well above 1% of all ~107 protein sites
of an organism. Selection with s ~10-5 acting against > 105
slightly deleterious amino acids must cause a high genetic
load [27].
Sets of permitted amino acids at a site
Rates of coincident divergent evolution of proteins are ~3
times higher than their average rates of evolution, but still
much lower than rates of parallel evolution (Tables 1, 2,
3). Indeed, rates of replacements, at an amino acid site,
which involve different pairs of amino acids can be very
different and must be analyzed separately [21]. Obviously, not every amino acid is permitted even at an evolvable amino acid site.

The average selection coefficient > 1.5/(4Ne) associated
with parallel replacements implies that the ratio of equilibrium frequencies of the two preferred amino acids at an
amino acid site is ~4:1 (Fig. 2), assuming that the two
amino acids involved in a parallel replacement usually
confer the two highest fitnesses. Because for coincident
divergent evolution P ~0.3 (Tables 1, 2, 3), the corresponding average selection coefficient should be > 2.5/
(4Ne) and the ratio of equilibrium frequencies of the preferred over unpreferred amino acid is ~20:1 (Fig. 2). Thus,
rather roughly, a typical evolvable amino acid site should
be occupied by the favored amino acid, the second best
amino acid, and the other possible amino acids with
probabilities ~75%, ~15%, and ~10%.
Of course, the sets of permitted amino acids vary greatly
between sites. The rate of coincident divergence along
path II is higher at amino acid sites where divergence
along path I involves a pair of chemically dissimilar
amino acids. Therefore, if two dissimilar amino acids are
permitted at an amino acid site, other amino acids are

Orthologs of human, dog, mouse, and rat, as well as of
four species of Saccharomyces, were identified by the bidirectional best protein BLAST [32] hit approach [33] using
the Entrez retrieval system [34] of annotated protein coding genes from complete yeast and mammalian genomes,
available at NCBI [35]. Alignments of amino acid
sequences for each quadruplet were made using ClustalW
[36] and reverse transcribed to obtain alignments of DNA
sequences.
To align the whole genome assemblies of D. melanogaster,
D. simulans, D. yakuba and D. erecta, we used whole
genome multiple alignment algorithm implemented in
the VISTA Genome Pipeline (Brudno et al. in prep.). This
algorithm consists of two major modules – Pairwise
Alignment of Sister Taxa and Progressive Multiple Alignment. First module uses a glocal (hybrid global/local)
approach based on a reimplementation of the original
Shuffle-LAGAN (S-LAGAN) chaining algorithm [37,38]
combined with a post-processing stage called SuperMap.
The S-LAGAN chaining takes as input a set of local alignments between the two sequences and returns the maximal scoring subset of these under certain gap criteria. In
order to allow our alignments to incorporate duplications
in both genomes, SuperMap algorithm takes two SLAGAN outputs, for each sequence as the base. We then
classified all local alignments as belonging to both chains,
and consequently orthologous (best bidirectional hits), or
being in only one chain, and hence a duplication. After
the two pairs of sister taxa (melanogaster/simulans and
yakuba/erecta) were aligned, we used a progressive generalization of the pairwise SuperMap algorithm to align the
two alignments to each other, and get a 4-way alignment.
Our algorithm is based on finding a maximum weighted
matching in a graph, with the weights specified by the outgroup genomes, to order the individual alignment blocks
in the likely order of the ancestors of melanogaster/simulans
and yakuba/erecta. After that we align the resulting ancestrally-ordered alignments to each other using LAGAN
[39]. To restrict our analysis to one-to-one orthologs, all
cases in which an ORF in one species was aligned to more
than one ORF in another species were excluded from the
analysis. Since a substantial fraction of Drosophila coding
regions had stretches of ambiguities and internal stop
codons, we assumed that such stretches could have erroneous length due to sequencing errors. Therefore, if it
allowed us to reduce the numbers of internal stop codons,

Synonymous divergence was estimated from alignments
of fourfold degenerate sites, flanked from each side by a
nucleotide conserved between all four species. We defined
synonymous divergence between two species for an unordered pair of nucleotides (A, B) as the ratio of the number
of sites at which one of species carries A and the other B,
over the total number of sites at which they both carry A,
both carry B, or one carries A and the other B.

we changed the lengths of stretches of ambiguities so to
minimize the number of internal stop codons in the coding region.
dS and dN were estimated using pairwise nucleotide alignments taken from the four-species alignments for each
pair of species using the codeml program of the PAML
package [40]. To eliminate erroneous and nonorthologous gene alignments, those alignments in which pairwise
dS and/or dN exceeded a pre-specified threshold between
any pair of species were excluded from analysis. The
thresholds were chosen manually to exclude the outlying
alignments. The dS and dN values from PAML averaged
over all the remaining genes were used as distances
between species to produce the neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees in Fig. 1. Genes were split into three bins of
equal size (low, intermediate and high dN) according to dN
value between species of path II. The total numbers of
quadruplets of orthologous genes analyzed were 11,105
for mammals, 3,735 for Drosophila, and 3,040 for yeasts.
All the alignments and the Perl scripts used for analysis are
available upon request.
To eliminate erroneous regions of alignments, which may
originate from errors in genome assemblies or annotations, we only analyzed those codons that were flanked by
gapless alignments of length ten codons or more from
each side. To avoid the effect of hypermutability of CpG
dinucleotide in mammals, we only included in the analysis of mammalian genomes nonCpG-prone sites, not preceded by C and not followed by G.

Nonsynonymous divergence was estimated from nondegenerate nucleotide sites only, i. e. from sites at first or second nucleotide positions within an amino acid site at
which each of the four nucleotides corresponds to a different encoded amino acid. In the analysis of divergence at
the same nucleotide site, amino acid sites with divergence
at more than one nucleotide site between any two of the
four species were excluded from the analysis. In analysis
of divergence at different nucleotide sites between paths I
and II (i. e., species diverged along path I in first nucleotide site, and along path II at the second nucleotide site
of the amino acid site, or vice versa) we required that only
a single nucleotide be divergent between amino acid sites
for each two species. Nonsynonymous divergence for a
pair of nucleotides (A, B) was defined analogously to synonymous divergence.
Chemical distance between a pair of amino acids was
taken as the corresponding term from the Miyata matrix
[41]. The distance rank of a single-nucleotide nonsynonymous substitution between codons c1 and c2 took on values (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3) and was calculated as the mean of the
two values: 1) rank of the amino acid distance d(c1, c2)
among all distances d(c1, cn), where cn are all one-point
non-stop neighboring codons of c1; 2) rank of the amino
acid distance d(c1, c2) among all distances d(cm, c2), where
cm are all one-point non-stop neighboring codons of c2.

Reviewers' comments
Review 1 (John McDonald, University of Delaware, Dept.
of Biological Sciences, Newark, DE, USA; nominated by
Laura Landweber, Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA)
This manuscript compares three four-species sets of DNA
sequences for coding regions. Each set of four species consists of two independent pairs. The main result is that
there are fewer cases of parallel evolution for nonsynonymous sites than expected, based on the proportion of
fourfold synonymous sites with parallel evolution. This is
offered as evidence of mildly deleterious selection.

I think it is about time that homoplasy was treated as a
source of evidence about evolutionary processes, not just
an annoyance for systematists. However, I think the deficit of parallel evolution at nonsynonymous sites reported
here may be an artifact, and the pattern may actually be

explained by a "pure" neutral model, where the fitness of
each mutation is either 0 or 1.
Consider the first line in table 1, which concerns sites that
have A in mouse and C in rat, or vice versa. Of these AC
sites in mouse-rat, 0.047 are also AC in human-dog. However, this 0.047 is only the fraction of human-dog sites
"where human and dog also underwent divergence in the
same unordered pair of nucleotides." Thus the denominator of the fraction yielding 0.047 is not the number of AC
sites in mouse-rat, but the number of AC sites in mouserat, minus all sites with one or two non-AC bases in
human-dog. Twofold neutral sites will all have A or C in
human-dog, so the denominator will be larger (and thus
the fraction of twofold neutral sites showing parallel evolution will be smaller).
Author's response: There is a misunderstanding here. Table 1
describes the sites divergent between human and dog, as stated
in the table heading. Contrary to what Dr. McDonald assumes,
the first line in this table is concerned with sites that have A in
dog and C in human, or vice versa. The phrase in the footnote
that parallel sites are those "where human and dog also underwent divergence in the same unordered pair of nucleotides" is
simply a restatement of this. 0.047 is the fraction of the sites
with A-C synonymous divergence between mouse and rat,
among all sites with A-C synonymous divergence between
human and dog and either A or C in the common ancestor of
mouse and rat. As described in Methods, the denominator of
the fraction that yields 0.047 is the number of sites which have
A and C, or C and A, in human and dog AND have A and A,
A and C, C and A, or C and C in mouse and rat. We attempted
to clarify this in the revised version of the manuscript.
As a first approximation, we can assume that fourfold synonymous sites are fourfold neutral. For nonsynonymous
sites, however, it seems likely that many sites with AC in
mouse-rat will be only twofold neutral; the amino acids
resulting from A or C at that position may have equal fitnesses, but the G or T amino acids may be strongly
selected against. If that is the case, a smaller proportion of
the twofold AC nonsynonymous neutral sites will show
parallel evolution than fourfold AC synonymous sites, if
the denominator excludes non-AC sites in human-dog.
Here's a numerical example to illustrate this. Consider a
site with A in mouse and C in rat. The substitution probability is 0.1 to any other base between the mouse-rat
ancestor and the human-dog ancestor (this is an unrooted
tree), and 0.1 between the human-dog ancestor and either
human or dog. If the site is twofold neutral, 0.19 of these
sites will be AC in human-dog (2*0.1-0.1^2), ignoring
multiple hits in a single lineage. So the proportion of twofold neutral AC sites in mouse-rat showing parallel evolution would be 0.19.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/20

For the fourfold neutral case, 0.80 of the sites will have A
or C in the human-dog ancestor. The proportion of sites
that will be AC in human-dog is the proportion of sites
with A or C in the human-dog ancestor, times the probability of a substitution to A or C in human or dog, times
the probability that a substitution to G or T did not happen in the other lineage, or 0.80*(2*0.1-0.1^2)*(12*0.1) = 0.1216. Since the denominator is the proportion
of sites that don't have G or T in either human or dog, it is
the proportion of sites with A or C in the human-dog
ancestor, times the probability that a substitution to G or
T did not happen in either human or dog, or 0.80*(10.2)*(1-0.2) = 0.512. Thus the proportion of AC sites in
mouse-rat that show parallel AC differences in humandog, divided by the proportion of sites with AA, AC, or CC
in human-dog, is 0.1216/0.512 = 0.2375. For the same
mutation rates, 0.2375 of the fourfold neutral sites show
parallel evolution, but only 0.19 of the twofold neutral
sites do.
Author's response: We do not see a problem here. In terms of
Dr. McDonald's example, we did the following:
1) chose sites that experienced A-C divergence along path I (i.
e., A in dog and C in human or vice versa),
2) among such sites, chose those sites that had either A or C in
the common ancestor for path II (assuming parsymony),
3) for these sites, calculated the rate of A-C divergence along
path II.
Assuming that only 1 substitution can occur alone path II at a
site, we do not see how this analysis can be affected by the total
number of permitted nucleotides at the site.
I suspect that this artifact may not be large enough to
explain all of the results in this manuscript, but the
authors need to consider it. If the lower than expected proportion of parallel evolution for nonsynonymous sites
holds up, this manuscript will be additional evidence that
mildly deleterious evolution of nonsynonymous mutations is widespread.
One minor point – since the main result of this manuscript is that there is less parallelism in protein evolution
than expected, the title "Extensive parallelism in protein
evolution" is misleading; something like "Low parallelism
in protein evolution as support for the nearly neutral
model" would be better.
Author's response: Indeed, our rate of parallel nonsynonymous
evolution is ~30% below that of synonymous evolution, but it is
also ~6 times higher than the average rate of nonsynonymous

evolution. Thus, if one word is used to characterize this rate,
"extensive" sounds appropriate.
Review 2 (Sarah Teichmann and Subhajyoti De, MRC
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK)
The manuscript "Extensive parallelism in protein evolution" by Bazykin et al. provides an interesting insight into
the parallel evolution at orthologus sites, and its effects on
the observed rate of protein evolution. The work discusses
how parallel accumulation of identical changes at equivalent sites contributes towards the effective rate of protein
divergence, both under constant and variable fitness landscape. The authors conclude that the data favours a constant fitness landscape on the proteins they investigate.

The idea and results are an interesting molecular evolutionary study. However, we have some technical and conceptual comments, which need to be addressed to
improve the manuscript.
Conceptual comments
1. The authors state that non-neutrality of synonymous
sites and heterogeneity of mutation rates can influence the
results on parallel evolution, but did not attempt to determine their relative importance. Can the authors provide a
rough estimate of how much those factors can affect the
final conclusions?

Author's response: Because we use the rate of only parallel synonymous evolution as a proxy for mutation rate, heterogeneity
of the rate of evolution across synonymous sites, due to heterogeneous mutation and/or selection, should not be a problem.
However, uniform deviation of the rate of synonymous evolution from the mutation rate, caused by selection, cannot be
taken into account in this way. Because we excluded hypermutable CpG sites (in mammals), it is likely that weak selection at
synonymous sites could only decrease their rate of evolution,
perhaps by ~10% (Kondrashov et al. J. Theor. Biol. 240, 616–
626, 2006). If so, using the rate of synonymous evolution as a
proxy for the rate of neutral evolution should cause a slight
underestimation of the strength of negative selection at evolvable non-synonymous sites.
2. The authors mentioned that coincident divergent evolution is always much lower than the rate of parallel nonsynonymous evolution. Presumably this is linked to the
fact that evolvable sites will tend to switch to the most
chemically similar amino acids. This is indicated by the
Miyata distances in the tables, and the discussion section
on permitted amino acids. However, the meaning of the
percentages in the tables on the Miyata distances are not
obvious to us, and are not explained in the table legend.
To what extent is the ratio of parallel to coincident divergent sites explained by chemical similarity? What are the
results using different chemical similarity measures?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/20

Author's response: We think that the explanation may be simpler. If, at a site, all the possible amino acids confer different
fitnesses, substitutions that involve the best and the next best
amino acid would be more common in evolution than any
other, thus leading to the rate of parallel evolution being higher
than the rate of coincident divergent evolution. The two "most
preferred" amino acids do not necessarily represent the most
similar pair at a site, although, on average, their Miyata distance tends to be short. As to the last point, very similar results
where obtained using Grantham's similarity matrix (data not
shown).
3. Along the same lines, are there examples of parallel evolution of sites that are very chemically different, and do
they coincide with high dN/dS in a protein, indicating
positive selection? Is there a general correlation of high
dN/dS in a protein and chemical dissimilarity at coincident parallel sites? One could investigate this by considering individual proteins or groups of proteins rather than
the entire data set.
Author's response: This is indeed an interesting question. It
appears from our data that proteins with LOWER dN/dS values
on average allow for more radical parallel substitutions. However, there is insufficient data for this analysis to be included in
the main text.
4. The authors mention that the number of slightly deleterious and slightly beneficial replacements must be
equal. When selection is non-zero at mutation-selectiondrift equilibrium, it is not clear why this should be the
case.
Author's response: Assuming constant selection, the rates of
reciprocal beneficial and deleterious replacements at mutationselection-drift equilibrium must be the same, as long as we consider only 2 alleles – essentially, the definition of equilibrium.
Less trivially, this fact holds even when we consider an arbitrary
number of alleles (still under constant selection), because
mutation-selection-drift equilibrium is a detailed equilibrium,
with identical reciprocal fluxes of substitutions, and no cycling
possible.
5. Providing examples of parallel evolution of sites in a
protein in the context of constant and variable fitness
landscapes would be very helpful.
Author's response: We would love to do this – but how can we
be sure that fitness landscape was constant – or variable – for a
particular protein?
Technical comments
1. Although the biological aspects of equation (1) were
clear, the mathematical parts could be elucidated more
clearly: dv = d(f(s)) = f'(s)d(s), yet f'(s) is not present.

Biology Direct 2007, 2:20

2. The authors talk about the conditions where P > 1 or P
< 1 under variable and constant fitness landscape, and
mention that the distribution q(v) is concentrated at P =
0.7. However it was unclear how the value is obtained. Is
it simply derived from their results that P is between 50
and 80%? And what is the expected range of P?
3. The clarity of the manuscript needs to be improved to
make it readily comprehensible to the broad audience,
including aspects of English grammar. Subsections within
in the 'Methods' section would improve the organisation
of the manuscript.
4. Figure legends need to be more elaborate to improve
clarity. Figure 3 can be omitted and instead described in a
table or in the text. Instead, a figure of a protein with parallel mutations can be provided as a concrete biological
example of the phenomenon.
5. How many parallel sites are there per protein on average in the three groups of four organisms? We cannot
deduce this from any of the numbers in the manuscript.
Author's response: We are thankful for these comments, some
of which have been accomodated.
The modified manuscript will definitely provide good
insight into the parallel evolution leading to similar
changes at identical sites and the evidence for weak negative selection on these sites in proteins. Once the above
issues are carefully addressed, the improved manuscript is
expected to meet the standard for publication in the Biology Direct.
Review 3 (Chris Adami, Keck Graduate Institute, California
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA)
In this paper, the authors study the parallel (and divergent) replacement of residues of proteins in different evolutionary paths, obtained by aligning sequences of three
quartets of organism. The main observations are the following: the rate of parallel (non-synonymous) replacements is between 50% and 80% of the rate of parallel
synonymous replacement, while the rate of divergent
replacement (a residue replaced by another in one line,
and replaced by a different one in the other line) is about
between 25% and 30%. The authors conclude from this
observation that most of the sites that undergo parallel
evolution in these organisms (yeast, Drosophila, and mammal quartets) are under weak selection, as suggested by
Ohta's "nearly neutral" theory.

There are clearly two parts to this paper: one is the assembly of data and their analysis to determine the rates of parallel evolution, the other is the interpretation of the data.
I will limit my comments to the interpretation of the rates,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/20

and simply assume that the authors have assembled and
analyzed the data with all due diligence.
The analysis of the rates of parallel evolution turns out to
be rather tricky. The authors are mostly interested in determining the average selection coefficient at these sites.
Clearly, if all sites were just evolving neutrally, then the
rate of synonymous parallel evolution should be equal to
the rate of nonsynonymous parallel evolution, i.e., P = 1.
The question then is: how do you explain the reduced
rate? Is the rate reduced because the two lineages are seeing different fitness landscapes (so that one residue is preferred in one lineage but selected against in the other), or
is it because many sites actually have somewhat non-optimal residues to begin with, which are replaced by optimal
ones in one, but not the other lineage?
If you assume that a variable landscape explains the suppression (i.e., P < 1), then you must assume that the
change happened in the landscape of only one of the lineages, because if it happened in parallel for both, you'd
see P > 1. If only one of the lineages sees a change in landscape, is the change neutral or driven by positive selection? The authors argue that it cannot be neutral because
in this case slowly evolving proteins (for whom the landscape of "other mutations" changes only very slowly)
should have a higher P, whereas a lower P is observed.
Thus, the authors conclude that positive selection must be
responsible for P < 1 if landscapes are changing.
Author's response: So far, we agree with Dr. Adami.
If landscapes are not changing, then the authors argue hat
P < 1 implies slightly deleterious mutations at parallel
sites. It is here where I have serious reservations. The reasoning is based on assuming that the average rate of parallel evolution reflects what is going on at single sites, that
is, that the probability distribution of deleterious effects is
narrowly distributed around the mean. But the authors
themselves acknowledge that this is not the case (often a
Gamma distribution is assumed), but then go on to say
that the average effect of mutations at sites that undergo
parallel evolution can nevertheless be calculated from
knowing P. However, this reasoning also assumes that the
distribution of P's across sites is narrowly centered around
an average P, which again assumes a peaked distribution
of deleterious effects. In other words, the conclusion that
P < 1 implies a small mean effect of deleterious mutations
is obtained by replacing distributions by their means,
something that is exceedingly dangerous for distributions
with an exponential tail.
Author's response: Here, we cannot agree: we do not assume
that the distribution of rate of evolution across sites, q(v), is
narrow. We only claim that the average selection coefficient S

is minimal when this distribution is narrow, so that any nonzero variance of q(v) leads to S > f-1(P) (see text). Moreover,
we calculate the maximal fraction of selectively neutral sites
that is consistent with a given P, under an arbitrary q(v).

While I cannot argue that the authors conclusion is necessarily wrong, it seems to me that in the absence of detailed
knowledge about the distribution of deleterious effects,
no conclusion can be drawn about how neutral or nearly
neutral sites are that undergo parallel evolution. Indeed, it
seems to me that positive selection is not out of the question, as a single change at one site can influence whether
a change at another site is beneficial or deleterious (epistasis between mutations). Thus, rather than invoking environments being constant or changing for both lines, it is
sufficient for one lineage to acquire a second mutation
somewhere else in the protein in order for the change that
is beneficial in the first lineage to be detrimental in the
second. All else being equal, the ubiquity of epistatic interactions between mutations should favor an epistatic
explanation of reduced parallelism.

It is also surprising that the authors do not discuss the evidence for parallel evolution accumulated in experimental
evolution, where extensive parallelism is explained by
overwhelmingly positive selection (Wichman et al, Science 285:422–424, 1999).
Author's response: In the first paragraph of the paper, we cite
several plausible instances of parallel evolution that is driven by
positive selection. Generally, we agree with Dr. Adami that our
arguments against variable fitness landscapes being the main
reason for P < 1 are not water-tight. Still, weak, constant selection appears to provide the most plausible explanation for the
data.
