Abstract
Background: Bacteria possess a reservoir of metabolic functionalities ready to be exploited for multiple purposes.
The use of microorganisms to clean up xenobiotics from polluted ecosystems (e.g. soil and water) represents an
eco-sustainable and powerful alternative to traditional remediation processes. Recent developments in molecularbiology-based techniques have led to rapid and accurate strategies for monitoring and identification of bacteria
and catabolic genes involved in the degradation of xenobiotics, key processes to follow up the activities in situ.
Results: We report the characterization of the response of an enriched bacterial community of a 1,2dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) contaminated aquifer to the spiking with 5 mM lactate as electron donor in microcosm
studies. After 15 days of incubation, the microbial community structure was analyzed. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene
clone library showed that the most represented phylogenetic group within the consortium was affiliated with the
phylum Firmicutes. Among them, known degraders of chlorinated compounds were identified. A reductive
dehalogenase genes clone library showed that the community held four phylogenetically-distinct catalytic
enzymes, all conserving signature residues previously shown to be linked to 1,2-DCA dehalogenation.
Conclusions: The overall data indicate that the enriched bacterial consortium shares the metabolic functionality
between different members of the microbial community and is characterized by a high functional redundancy.
These are fundamental features for the maintenance of the community’s functionality, especially under stress
conditions and suggest the feasibility of a bioremediation treatment with a potential prompt dehalogenation and
a process stability over time.

Background
Ecological models and experimental data suggest that
taxonomic diversity and genetic-functional redundancy
are key factors in increasing the flexibility of microbial
communities that subsequently can both perform a
given metabolic function more efficiently and better
overcome metabolic stresses [1-3]. Biodiversity is linked
to both the chemical-physical characteristics of the
environment and the dynamic and synergistic interactions between microbes that in turn contribute to

determine the level of ecosystem functioning [4-6]. The
ecological behavior of microbes together with their
enormous metabolic potential is a valuable solution to
remediation of polluted environments [7-12]. The
exploitation of the enormous metabolic capabilities associated with microorganisms has been recently defined as
Microbial Resource Management (MRM): bacteria can
be seen as cell factories that are stirred to produce or
degrade a given compound under human management
[13].
Among major anthropogenic pollutants, chlorinated
aliphatics and aromatics are of great concern especially
in anaerobic environments like groundwater and
sediments where they tend to accumulate. For example,

1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) is considered a priority
pollutant, being the most abundant double-carbon
chlorinated compound contaminating the groundwater
worldwide [14,8]. Literature reports several examples on
how microbial metabolic potential can enhance the
removal of 1,2-DCA [10-12] as well as of other chlorinated alkanes and alkenes [8,15-17]. Key enzymes implicated in the dechlorination processes are the reductive
dehalogenases (RDs), a class of enzymes capable of eliminating chlorine from molecules [18-24].
In our previous study, RD sequences correlated with
1,2-DCA dechlorination to ethene have been identified
in Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans strain DCA1
(RD DCA1) - a microorganism that can efficiently
dechlorinate 1,2-DCA using hydrogen as electron donor
- and in situ in a 1,2-DCA contaminated aquifer (RD
54) [12,25]. The enrichment culture setup from the
aquifer (culture 6VS), was reported to contain both
Dehalobacter and Desulfitobacterium spp. Recently three
novel RDs sequences (WL rdhA1, WL rdhA2 and WL
rdhA3) have been identified in a 1,2-DCA dehalogenating enrichment culture containing Dehalobacter sp. WL
[26]. In the present work, the 6VS mixed culture [25]
was structurally and functionally characterized after
transferring in fresh anaerobic microcosms amended
with 1,2-DCA and lactate as electron donor. The final
aim was to describe the response of the resident microbial community, in terms of species diversity and functional redundancy, in order to foresee a biostimulation
or a bioaugmentation treatment to solve the problem in
situ.

Results
Bacterial diversity

We recently described a groundwater aquifer with a historical contamination by 1,2-DCA that held dechlorinating
microorganisms
[12,25].
The
bacterial
dehalogenating consortium was maintained through
adhesion of the original culture to an active-carbon support [25] and used to set up a new microcosm. The
microbial community was incubated for 15 days, in
anaerobic conditions, in presence of 5 mM of lactate as
electron donor and 900 mg L-1 of 1,2-DCA. Following
lactate amendment, the 1,2-DCA was completely
dechlorinated in about 260 h (11 days). To evaluate the
presence in the microbial community of species potentially involved in the 1,2-DCA degradation, we examined
the diversity of microbial communities by establishing
16S rRNA gene clone libraries. PCR with specific primers for archaea did not give any amplicon, even after a
second round of PCR using nested primers.
The overall community diversity as a function of both
the total number of species present (richness) and their
relative distribution (evenness) was calculated from the

Page 2 of 9

data obtained from the bacterial 16S rRNA gene
libraries after lactate amendment. The diversity and
structure of bacterial community was analyzed using
three indices: 1) Species richness, that is the number of
species identified in a sample; 2) Simpson’s index, that
is the probability that two clones, taken at random from
a sample, will be the same species. This measure is sensitive to changes in the frequency of the more abundant
species; 3) Shannon-Wiener index, that reflects the
diversity and the evenness of clones distribution
between taxa. It is sensitive to changes in the frequency
of common and less common (though not the rarer)
species [27]. After the treatment, the bacterial community of the enrichment culture was characterized by a
relatively high species richness (12 species), with a
Simpson index of 0.781 and a Shannon index of 1.807.
Pareto-Lorenz curve was used as a graphical estimator
of the species evenness [28,29]. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were ranked from high to low,
based on their relative abundance within the library.
The cumulative normalized number of clones was used
as X-axis, and their respective cumulative proportion of
abundances was reported in the Y-axis (Figure 1A). Following the treatment, Pareto-Lorenz curves showed a
situation where 20% of the OTUs represented 65-70% of
the total abundance of clones.
A summary of the clones identified in the libraries is
shown in Table 1. The 12 OTUs are reported with the
percent distribution normalized by rRNA gene copy
numbers from the closest phylogenetic relatives, in
order to minimize the rRNA copy number bias [30].
Rarefaction curves to saturation indicated that microbial
diversity in the library was satisfactorily covered (data
not shown). The bacterial clone libraries were dominated by sequences related to Desulfitobacterium, Dehalobacter and Clostridium genera, in the Firmicutes
phylum. In particular the most abundant sequences
were those identified having a 97% similarity with Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans strain DCA1 and a 99%
similarity with Dehalobacter sp. WL (26 clones for each
sequence over a total of 88 clones). Both these bacteria
have been reported to dechlorinate 1,2-DCA to ethene
[25,26]. Hence, the microbial community resulted to be
dominated by few species (Figure 1A) and most of them
are potentially related to the degradation of chlorinated
compounds (Figure 1B). Other numerically relevant
clones were related to Desulfitobacterium metallireducens and to Trichlorobacter thiogenes.
Functional genes diversity

In order to evaluate the functional redundancy of the
resident microbial community in response to biostimulation with lactate, the reductive dehalogenase diversity
was investigated. For this purpose, functional gene

libraries of this class of enzymes were prepared starting
from the total DNA extracted from the microcosm. Primers PceAFor1 and DcaB rev, annealing upstream and
downstream the gene dcaA, were used to amplify the
variable region of the dcaABCT gene cluster coding for
the reductive dehalogenase [25]. A total of 39 clones
were sequenced and sequences were aligned with those
from previously characterized RD. The phylogenetic
relationship among the different RDs found in the
groundwater is shown in Figure 2. Four groups (I-IV) of
RDs could be identified. Most of the clones were
affiliated to groups I and III, while groups II and IV
were represented by only two clones each. A high proportion of clones (24 over a total of 39) clustered in
group I and were closely related to the RD previously
identified in D. dichloroeliminans strain DCA1 (RD
DCA1) and in the same contaminated site (RD 54) (the
nucleotide identity was higher than 98%). The sequence
UP-RD-6’, representing the RD group II, was related to
the RD of the strain DCA1 but with a lower nucleotide
identity (96%). A third group, including the sequences
of eleven clones, presented only a 94% and a 88-89%
identity at respectively nucleotide and amino acid level
with the DcaA catalytic subunit previously identified in
the same aquifer [25]. On the contrary, these sequences
had an amino acid identity between 98 and 99% with
WL rdhA1, one of the three RDs sequences recently
identified by Grostern and colleagues [26] in Dehalobacter sp. WL.

It has been previously shown that 53% of the total
amino acid diversity of DcaA of the RD-54 and RDDCA1, when aligned with PceA of RDs specific for tetrachloroethene (PCE) from Dehalobacter restrictus strain
DSMZ 9455 T [31], Desulfitobacterium sp. strain Y51
[21], and Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain PCE-S
[20], was mainly localized in two small regions (blocks
A and B - Figure 3) that represent only 19% (104 amino
acids over 551) of the total DcaA residues [25]. These
two regions of hyper-variability were proposed to be
involved in 1,2-DCA recognition or in general in the
substrate specificity of RDs [25]. The novel RDs
sequences, identified in this work, were aligned to WL
rdhA1 and to sequences of the previously mentioned
RDs specific for PCE. From the alignment it was possible to identify two hyper-variable regions overlapping
with blocks A and B (Figure 3). In particular we focused
our attention on the RDs sequences of groups I and III,
considering the higher number of clones in these two
clusters. Within blocks A and B of the selected RDs
sequences, as well in other smaller regions of the DcaA
subunit, it was possible to identify amino acids specific
for: i) PceA, the RDs specific for PCE (yellow residues);
ii) DcaA of group III, an RD from Dehalobacter proposed to be specific for 1,2-DCA (light blue residues),
iii) DcaA of the group I, an RD from Desulfitobacterium,
proposed to be specific for 1,2-DCA (dark grey residues), iv) all the RDs within the groups I and III but not
for PCE-specific RDs (green residues).

Discussion
The stability of microbial communities has been suggested to correlate not only to the number of species
occupying a niche but also to the functional redundancy
found in the same niche [32,33]. Under this concept,
microbial communities should be more flexible if the
same function prevails under varying environmental
conditions and is supported by enzymes adapted to the
different conditions the microbial community is exposed
to. In this study, a reductive dechlorination activity was
linked to an adapted and specialized bacterial

community that presented, after suitable stimulation, a
high functional redundancy. According to the three
diversity indexes (species richness, Simpson and Shannon index) and the Pareto Lorenz curve representation,
the bacterial community is characterized by a good richness and few dominant species. Following the interpretation reported by Marzorati and colleagues [29], the
structure of the studied microbial community (the 20%
of the OTUs represent the 65-70% of the total abundance of clones) can be considered typical of a specialized community (as an enriched microbial community

should be). The 16S rRNA gene clone library showed
that the 1,2-DCA-degrading consortium was equally
dominated by two different taxa related to Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans strain DCA1 and Dehalobacter
sp. WL., previously shown to be involved in the 1,2DCA reductive dechlorination. In other studies different
bacteria within the same microbial community were
shown to exhibit specific activities towards different
chlorinated congeners [34]. Coherently with our results,
Grostern and colleagues [35] described the co-growth of
more microorganisms competing for the same chlorinated compound. As suggested by the authors, the cogrowth probably occurs due to the presence of slightly
different niches for each bacteria that avoid their direct
competition. We hypothesize that the differences in
niche partitioning in our culture are due to the presence
of a suitable and not limiting growth substrate and electron donor. This enrichment conditions enhanced the
growth of those portion of the microbial community

that might function as a flexible reservoir of various
degraders of halogenated compounds.
The third most abundant OTU was related to Desulfitobacterium metallireducens, identified for the first time
by Finneran and colleagues [36] in an uranium-contaminated aquifer. Desulfitobacterium metallireducens was
described as an anaerobic bacterium able to couple its
growth to the reduction of metals, humic acids and
chlorinated compounds (trichloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene) using lactate as electron donor [36]. However
its involvement in 1,2-DCA dehalogenation was not
demonstrated. The co-growth in dechlorinating enrichment cultures of bacteria not directly related to the
dehalogenating activity but with an indirect role in the
process is commonly reported in literature [37,38,26].
This is supported also by the identification of sequences
related to Lactobacillus sp. and Zymophilus sp., species
known to be able to produce lactate and other organic
acids useful as electron donors for the reductive

DcaA subunit of the group I, proposed to be specific for the 1,2-DCA RD from Desulfitobacterium; green residues those common to all the RDs
identified in the aquifers contaminated by 1,2-DCA but not conserved in the PCE-specific RDs. Asterisks, colons and dots below the alignment

dechlorination process. The structure and composition
of the microbial community suggested that the positive
response to the treatment is possibly led by a ‘complementarity effect’ rather than a ‘selection effect’ [2].
A further sign of the ‘complementarity effect’ was the
identification of possible functional redundancy related
to 1,2-DCA reductive dechlorination. The RDs gene
clone library showed four different RDs enzymes, all
conserving signature residues possibly linked to 1,2DCA dehalogenation [25,26]. Two main groups of RDs
(cluster I and III) characterized the consortium and it
was possible to connect the presence of these functional
genes to the two most abundant OTUs identified in the
16S rRNA gene library. Sequences belonging to the
group I were associated to Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans strain DCA1, that showed the same amino
acid signatures in the two reductive dehalogenases in its
genome [25]. Sequences of the group III most likely
belonged to Dehalobacter. In fact, taking into account
that i) rdhA1 of Dehalobacter sp. WL was found in a
culture amended with only 1,2-DCA; ii) its abundance
was shown to be correlated with both Dehalobacter
growth and 1,2-DCA dechlorination activity; and that

iii) Dehalobacter sp. WL rdhA1 transcription occurred
upon exposure to 1,2-DCA, Grostern and colleagues
[26] concluded that rdhA1 represents a putative Dehalobacter 1,2-DCA RD gene. At the moment, regarding the
RDs sequences of the groups II and IV, we have no definitive proof or literature data supporting their involvement in any specific dehalogenation process.
Finally, the occurrence of Dehalobacter sp. WL rdhA2
and rdhA3 in similar abundances in a 1,1,2-TCAamended culture was correlated to a second Dehalobacter strain that uses 1,1,2-TCA and, to a lesser extent,
1,2-DCA [26]. Our findings could support this hypothesis, with strain WL rdhA3 that clusters together rdhA1
in group III (Figure 2) and rdhA2 completely separated
from any other cluster and thus possibly not involved in
1,2-DCA degradation.

Conclusions
The capacity of sharing metabolic functionalities
between different members of a microbial community is
a fundamental feature for the efficiency of a microbial
community, especially under stress conditions. In fact,
when a given species cannot stand the environmental

Marzorati et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:12
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/12

fluctuations, the community functional stability is
assured by the presence of other species capable of performing the same function [29,33]. This is of special
interest for bioremediation treatments when normally
the microbial communities have to face harsh environmental conditions with the potential toxic effect of the
pollutant and the low availability of one or more carbon
sources, electron donors or nutrients.
Here we showed the characterization of a 1,2-DCA
degrading microbial consortium, providing the concept
that microbial metabolism can be exploited to solve real
practical problems (MRM).
Upon several sub-culturing steps providing 1,2-DCA
and lactate as electron donor, we were able to enrich a
microbial community that could degrade up to 900 ppm
of 1,2-DCA in less then 15 days. This community was
dominated by bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum. Among them, the most abundant OTUs were related
to Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans strain DCA1 and
Dehalobacter sp. WL, two strains known to be able to
reductively dechlorinate 1,2-DCA to ethene with no other
toxic intermediate metabolite. The structure of the microbial community was also correlated to functional redundancy with the identification of four phylogeneticallydistinct catalytic enzymes, all conserving signature residues possibly linked to 1,2-DCA dehalogenation.
In MRM terms, the application of lactate represents a
possible solution to boost the potential of the autochthonous microbial community for the degradative
activity. On the other side, the enriched consortium
itself is a potential candidate inoculum for bioaugmentation purposes to support groundwater remediation when
such metabolic capabilities are not naturally present
[39]. Further studies are needed for the in situ validation
of these principles.

Methods
Establishment of enrichment culture

Anaerobic microcosms were prepared with groundwater
from an aquifer contaminated for more than 30 years by
1,2-DCA, as described by Marzorati and colleagues [12].
The groundwater was contaminated with 1,2-DCA at a
high concentration (up to 900 mg L-1), but not by other
chlorinated ethanes or ethenes. The bacterial dehalogenating consortium was maintained through adhesion of
the original culture to an active-carbon support and the
microcosms were prepared in an anaerobic box incubated under N2/CO2/H2 (80/15/5%) at room temperature
(average temperature 22°C) and fed with 5 mM Na lactate and additional 1,2-DCA. The medium was prepared
as previously reported by Marzorati and colleagues [12].
The concentrations of 1,2-DCA, ethene, vinyl chloride
and other possible degradation products in the microcosms were analyzed by head-space gas chromatography,

Page 7 of 9

on a 7694 Agilent gas chromatograph equipped with a
flame ionization detector set at 200°C on a DB624 column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) at constant oven temperature at 80°C. 1,2-DCA limit of detection was 1 μg L-1.
PCR amplification of 16S rRNA and reductive
dehalogenase genes

DNA from the enrichment culture was extracted, starting from 1.5 mL of suspension, as previously described
[40]. 16S rRNA gene were amplified using bacterial universal primers 27f (5’AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG
3’) and 1494r (5’CTACGGCTACCTTGTTACGA 3’)
with the following reaction: 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen,
Milan, Italy), 1.5 mM MgCl 2, 0.12 mM of each dNTP,
0.3 μM of each primer, 1 U of Taq polymerase in a final
volume of 50 μL. Initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min
was followed by 5 cycles consisting of denaturation at
94°C for 1 min, annealing at 50°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min, and by 30 cycles consisting of
denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for
1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. A final extension at 72°C for 10 min was added.
A region of the reductive dehalogenase gene cluster
including all dcaA and 194 bp of dcaB gene was amplified using primers PceAFor1 (5’ ACGTGCAATTAT
TATTAAGG3’) and DcaB rev (5’TGGTATTCACGC
TCCGA3’), as reported by Marzorati and colleagues [25].
16S rRNA and functional genes libraries construction

Sixty ng PCR product (insert:vector molar ratio of 3:1) was
used for cloning reactions using the pGEM cloning kit
(pGEM-T Easy Vector Systems, Promega, Milan, Italy)
following the recommendations of the manufacturer. A
direct PCR assay was performed on white colonies
to amplify the insert using primers T7 (3’CTAATAC
GACTCACTATAGGG 5’) and SP6 (3’ATTTAGGTGA
CACTATAGAATA 5’). Amplification reactions were performed in a 25 μL total volume containing, 1× reaction
buffer (Invitrogen), 0.12 mM of each dNTP, 0.7 U of Taq
DNA polymerase, 0.3 μM of each primer. Reactions were
performed with the following protocol: an initial melting
at 94°C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s,
50°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1.5 min and a final extension step
at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were purified by a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Clones from
bacterial 16S rRNA gene library were sequenced with primer 27f, those from RD libraries with the primer PceAFor1, using the ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Milan, Italy) and an
ABI 310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Rarefaction curves were built using the PAST program [41].
To determine the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)
the 99% identity criterion for the full-length 16S rRNA

Marzorati et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:12
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/12

sequence has been chosen to minimize underestimation of
the true functional diversity of the ecosystem [42] and to
minimize PCR artifacts due to Taq DNA polymerase
errors [43]. Two clones per each OTU were completely
sequenced using primer 1494r for bacterial 16S rRNA
gene libraries and DcaB rev and DHLF3 (5’ GAAATAGCTAATGAGCCTGT 3’) for RD gene libraries.
Statistical analysis

The closest relative match to each sequence was obtained
with BLASTN facilities [44] and Classifier v.6.0 program
at the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) 10 http://rdp.
cme.msu.edu/classifier/classifier.jsp[45]. Chimera
sequences were checked with the chimera-check tool at
greengenes.lbl.gov [46]. Sequences were phylogenetically
aligned using ClustalW software http://clustalw.genome.
ad.jp/[47]. Alignments were checked manually and corrected for any misalignments that had been generated.
Tree construction was done with Treecon v.1.3b using
neighbor-joining methods and a bootstrap analysis with
1000 replicates. Matrix similarities among 16S rRNA
sequences and RDs sequences were calculated in Phylip
Interface using Jukes-Cantor algorithm for DNA and
Dayhoff PAM matrix for protein sequences.
The following indices were calculated by using the
PAST program [41] to give a more detailed description
of the diversity within the samples [48]: Dominance (D =
Σpi2), Shannon (H = -Σ(pi) × (logepi) and Simpson (Ds =
1-D), where pi is the ratio between the abundance of
each OTU and the total number of clones analyzed. In
order to graphically represent the evenness of the bacterial communities, Pareto-Lorenz distribution curves [28]
were set up based on the 16S rRNA gene clone library
results as reported by Marzorati and colleagues [29].
Sequence accession number

The nucleotide sequences of the clones identified in this
study were deposited in the EMBL nucleotide sequence
database (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ) under the accession
numbers from FM204994 to FM205005 for bacterial
16S rRNA genes and from FM204935 to FM204942 for
RD sequences.
