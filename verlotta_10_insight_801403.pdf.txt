Insight into durum wheat Lpx-B1: a small gene
family coding for the lipoxygenase responsible
for carotenoid bleaching in mature grains

Abstract
Background: The yellow colour of pasta products is one of the main criteria used by consumers to assess pasta
quality. This character is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments in semolina. During pasta processing,
oxidative degradation of carotenoid pigments occurs mainly due to lipoxygenase (LOX). In durum wheat (Triticum
durum Desf.), two Lpx-1 genes have been identified on chromosome 4B, Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2, and evidences have
been reported that the deletion of Lpx-B1.1 is associated with a strong reduction in LOX activity in semolina. In the
present study, we characterised the Lpx-B1 gene family identified in a durum wheat germplasm collection and
related the distribution and expression of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles to variations in LOX activity in the mature
grains.
Results: In addition to the already known Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2 genes, a new gene was identified, Lpx-B1.3, along
with three different Lpx-B1.1 alleles, Lpx-B1.1a, Lpx-B1.1b and the partially deleted Lpx-B1.1c. Screening of the
germplasm collection showed that all of the genotypes have one of the three Lpx-B1.1 alleles, associated with
either Lpx-B1.2 or Lpx-B1.3, thus showing that in this collection the two genes are alternatives. Therefore, based on
Lpx-B1 distribution, three different haplotypes were distinguished: haplotype I, carrying Lpx-B1.3 and the Lpx-B1.1b
allele; haplotype II carrying Lpx-B1.2 and the Lpx-B1.1a allele; and haplotype III carrying Lpx-B1.2 and the Lpx-B1.1c
allele. Determination of Lpx-B1 transcript abundance and total LOX activity in mature grains revealed differences
among these three haplotypes: haplotypes I, II and III showed high, intermediate and low levels, respectively, of
functional Lpx-B1 transcripts and enzymatic activity.
Conclusions: In this germplasm collection, the Lpx-B1 gene family accounts for most of the total LOX activity in
the mature grains. Information on these Lpx-B1 haplotypes provides significant improvement for prediction of LOX1 activity levels in mature grains, and will therefore help in breeding programmes aimed at selection of new
durum wheat genotypes with higher carotenoid contents in their end products.

Background
The yellow colour is an important parameter in the
definition of pasta quality, and it is therefore a target for
durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) breeding. This
character arises from carotenoid pigments in semolina,
which are mainly free and esterified lutein. As well as its
role as an important aesthetic parameter of pasta products, lutein has high nutritional value. Known mostly
for its importance in reducing the risk for ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and

cataracts, lutein consumption has been recently related
to a reduced risk for developing cardiovascular disease
and several types of cancer [1]. On this basis, enhancement of the lutein content in a widely consumed food
such as pasta will be beneficial towards the maintenance
of human health, particularly with the current low daily
intake of lutein compared to the daily recommended
dose.
However, during pasta processing there is often a
loss of colour as a consequence of pigment oxidation.
Although other enzymes present in durum wheat
semolina can contribute to carotenoid bleaching, such
as peroxidases and polyphenol oxidases, the major role

appears to be that of the lipoxygenase-linoleate
system [2-4].
Lipoxygenase (LOX, linoleate:oxygen oxidoreductase;
EC 1.13.11.12) is a class of non-heme iron-containing
dioxygenases that catalyses the positional and specific
dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids that contain
1,4-cis,cis pentadiene structures to produce the corresponding hydroperoxides. In plants, products of the
LOX reaction have been shown to have roles in several
processes, such as vegetative growth, wounding,
response to herbivore and pathogen attack and also
mobilisation of storage lipids during germination [5]. In
durum wheat semolina, radicals produced during the
intermediate states of linoleate hydroperoxidation can
cause oxidation of carotenoid pigments, and consequently a loss of the yellow colour in pasta products [5].
The occurrence of LOX enzymes in cereal grains has
been well documented for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).
Two different isoforms, LOX-1 and LOX-2, have been
purified and characterised [6]: LOX-1 contributes almost
exclusively to the total LOX activity in quiescent grains,
whereas LOX-2 activity increases rapidly during germination [7]. Three cDNA sequences encoding the LOX
proteins have been isolated from barley grains, and the
chromosomal locations of their corresponding genes
determined: the LoxA and LoxC clones correspond to
the LOX-1 and LOX-2 isoforms, respectively [8], and a
third clone, known as LoxB [9], encodes a LOX isoform
that has not been identified to date. The LoxA and LoxB
loci are tightly linked (1 cM) and map to chromosome
4HS, whereas LoxC maps to the long arm of chromosome 5H [9]. The LoxB transcript has been mainly
detected in germinating grains, although at levels significantly lower than for LoxA and LoxC, with no LoxB
transcript in mature grains [9].
In durum wheat the LOX genes are located in regions
collinear with barley, thus suggesting that they are
orthologous: two Lpx-2 sequences that correspond to
the barley LoxC gene have been identified and assigned
to the group 5 chromosomes, whereas two sequences
designated Lpx-3 and showing higher similarity with
barley LoxB have been mapped on the group 4 chromosomes [10]. As far as durum wheat genes orthologous to
barley LoxA, Hessler et al. highlighted three natural Lpx1 gene variants in durum wheat that have arisen from
the instability of a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in the last intron [11]. The MITE
has been shown to be complete (C7.2.1), partial (J4.2),
or even absent (J2.2/C5.36.2), and this polymorphism
has allowed mapping of the Lpx-1 sequences to chromosome 4BS. Based on similarities among the three
sequences and on their distribution among cultivars, the
authors hypothesized that the C7.2.1 and the J4.2
sequences represent alleles at the same Lpx-1 locus on

Page 2 of 18

the short arm of chromosome 4B, whereas the J2.2 and
C5.36.2 sequences correspond to a gene at a different
Lpx-1 locus. This hypothesis has been successively supported by findings of Carrera et al. [10], who highlighted two sequences, DQ474240 and DQ474241, that
corresponded to the sequences with and without the
MITE, respectively, previously identified by Hessler et
al. [11]. These sequences were shown to map at two
linked Lpx-B1 loci on wheat chromosome 4B, which
were designated Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2, respectively.
The same study also reported an allelic variation for the
deletion of the Lpx-B1.1 copy; authors’ findings demonstrated that the deletion is associated with a strong
reduction in LOX activity in semolina extracts. A partially deleted copy of Lpx-1 has also been found on
chromosome 4A [12].
The variability in carotenoid content and LOX activity
of durum wheat germplasm was recently assessed in a
large collection, and the contribution of the Lpx genes
in the determination of pigment loss during pasta processing was also determined [4]. This study confirmed
the correlation between high/low LOX activity levels in
semolina and the presence/absence of the Lpx-B1.1
locus, and demonstrated that the Lpx genes are differently expressed during seed maturation, with Lpx-1
transcripts being the most abundant in mature grains.
Here we analysed the role of Lpx-1 in the determination of LOX activity in mature durum wheat grains. An
in-depth characterization of five genes and alleles at the
Lpx-B1 locus present in a germplasm collection was performed. The full-length sequences of the Lpx-B1 genes/
alleles were isolated and characterized. On the basis of
sequence polymorphisms and map positions, a new gene
designated Lpx-B1.3 was identified in addition to the
already known Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2 genes, and three
different alleles at the Lpx-B1.1 locus were distinguished.
According to the distribution of the Lpx-B1 genes/alleles
in the germplasm collection, three distinct groups were
identified that correspond to three different haplotypes
and are characterized by different Lpx-B1 expression
profiles and LOX activity in mature grains.

Results
Identification and characterisation of genes and alleles at
the Lpx-B1 locus of durum wheat

To gain further insight into the organisation of the LpxB1 locus, we investigated whether this locus includes
genes and/or alleles other than those already identified,
and evaluated the consequent distribution in a large
durum wheat germplasm collection.
We surveyed 85 durum wheat genotypes by performing an amplification reaction on genomic DNA with the
primer pair LOXA-L1/R1 (Table 1) previously employed
by Carrera et al. to preferentially amplify sequences at

This is the LOXA-L1/R1 primer pair previously used by Carrera et al. [10]. The different amplicon sizes are due to the length polymorphism of the MITE in the
intron region. cPrimer pairs highlighted in bold were those used for Figures 3B and 5.

the Lpx-B1 locus [10]. The fragments obtained were
cloned and sequenced to prove their identity. Excluding
singletons, four different sequences were distinguished
(Figure 1). Two sequences corresponded to DQ474240
(Lpx-B1.1) and DQ474241 (Lpx-B1.2); the presence of
the MITE in the last intron of the Lpx-B1.1 gene and its
absence in the Lpx-B1.2 gene allowed size discrimination of these two amplified fragments, with lengths of
962 bp and 867 bp, respectively. A third sequence corresponded to J4.2 (888 bp long), as previously identified by
Hessler et al. [11]; in line with previous findings, this
sequence shared 99.9% identity with DQ474240 in the
coding region, and carried a partial sequence of the
MITE in the last intron, which corresponded to the first
half of the element and a final 11-bp inverted repeat. As
well as these already known sequences, a fourth new
sequence was identified: TRI5.2. In the coding region,
TRI5.2 shared 97.0% and 95.6% identity with the fragments at the Lpx-B1.1 (DQ474240 and J4.2) and LpxB1.2 (DQ474241) loci, respectively. Several deletions in
the intron regions of this sequence, one of which caused
complete removal of the MITE, allowed size discrimination between this fragment (794 bp long) and the other
three fragments.
We then isolated and characterised the full-length
genomic sequences corresponding to these four Lpx-B1

fragments. This approach allowed isolation of
four sequences [GenBank: HM126466, HM126467,
HM126468, HM126469] that ranged between 4,062 bp
and 4,263 bp (from start to stop codon) (Table 2), and
included a portion that was 100% identical to the
DQ474240, DQ474241, J4.2 and TRI5.2 sequences. In
addition to the full-length sequences that corresponded
to the four fragments reported in Figure 1, a shorter
sequence was also isolated, of 1,505 bp (from start to
stop codon) [GenBank: HM126470] (Table 2).
To determine the genomic structure of the five LpxB1 sequences, comparisons were made with the corresponding expressed sequences (see below) and with the
rice (Oryza sativa L.) 9-LOX1 gene [GenBank:
AB099850]. This latter was chosen because it is phylogenetically closely related to barley LoxA (L35931)
[13,14] and is located on rice chromosome 3, which
shows synteny with a large portion of wheat chromosome 4B. In particular, a syntenic correspondence with
rice chromosome 3 was seen for the 4BS8-0.57-0.81 bin,
in which the ESTs corresponding to the Lpx-B1
sequences were physically mapped (GrainGenes website
http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/wEST/binmaps/wheat4_rice.
html).
As shown in Figure 2, the four longer sequences of
the complete Lpx-B1 genes/alleles shared a common

structure with rice 9-LOX1, except that rice exons 3 to 5
were joined in the durum wheat genes; consequently,
the durum wheat genes comprised seven exons and six
introns. In contrast, the shorter sequence was a partially
deleted gene, which included only the region from the
first exon to the start of the second intron, with a large
part of the last exon. As the LOXA-L1 and LOXA-R1

primers fall into exons 5 and 7, respectively, no fragment corresponding to the partially deleted gene was
identified in the experiment reported in Figure 1.
While the length of the exons was highly conserved
among the Lpx-B1 genes/alleles, the introns showed
some degree of variability. In particular, the HM126466
and HM126468 sequences were characterised by the

Figure 2 Schematic representation of the structures of the Lpx-B1 genes. The structures of the Lpx-B1 genes were deduced by comparisons
of the genomic sequences with the rice r9-LOX1 gene (AB099850) and with the corresponding transcripts (see below). Filled boxes represent
exons and lines represent introns. The dotted line in the last intron of the HM126466 and HM126468 sequences represents the MITE length

same intron length, with the exception of intron 6, the
length of which differed between the two sequences due
to the polymorphism of the MITE length. As well as the
common exon/intron structure, the two sequences
shared high identity (99.4%). This is in line with the
hypothesis of Hessler et al. [11], that the two sequences
represent alleles at the same Lpx-B1.1 locus. In the light
of this, we have designated the HM126466 sequence as
Lpx-B1.1a and the HM126468 sequence as Lpx-B1.1b.
The partially deleted gene corresponding to the
HM126470 sequence was closely related to the Lpx-B1.1
alleles: in the overlapping regions it showed the same
exon/intron structure, with 99% identity.
The HM126467 sequence, that had previously been
assigned to the Lpx-B1.2 locus, and the HM126469
sequence, that was identified in the present study,
showed different intron lengths, both with each other
(with the exception of introns 1 and 2) and with the
Lpx-B1.1 alleles. On the basis of percentage identities,
these two sequences were more similar to each other
than to the alleles at the Lpx-B1.1 locus (92.6% vs 83.0%
to 85.7%).
Genetic mapping of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles

To determine the chromosomal positions of the genes/
alleles identified in the present study, linkage analysis
was carried out on two recombinant inbred line (RIL)
populations derived from the crosses between Creso ×
Pedroso and Ofanto × Cappelli. These populations were
chosen because in both cases the parental genotypes
were characterised by different Lpx-B1 genes/alleles:
Creso and Ofanto carried the sequence HM126467
(Lpx-B1.2) and the new sequence HM126470, Pedroso

and Cappelli carried, respectively, the sequence
HM126468 (Lpx-B1.1b) and HM126466 (Lpx-B1.1a),
and both of them carried the new sequence HM126469.
As shown in Figure 3A, in both of the RIL populations,
all of the four genes/alleles mapped to the short arm of
chromosome 4B, about 13 cM proximal to the microsatellite marker Xwmc617, where the map position of the
Lpx-B1 locus was previously determined [10,15]. Markers in the telomeric region of chromosome 4BS showed
significant (P < 0.01) segregation distortion in the
Ofanto × Cappelli map. In line with previous findings,
HM126466/HM126468 and HM126467 mapped as two
separate loci, Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2, respectively. The
new sequence HM126470 was seen to co-segregate with
HM126466/HM126468, thus suggesting that it represents a third allelic variant at the Lpx-B1.1 locus,
referred to hereafter as Lpx-B1.1c; this might correspond
to the deletion previously identified by Carrera et al.
[10]. The HM126469 sequence was located at a different
locus, and this new genomic position was designated
Lpx-B1.3.
The mapping results were consistent with those
obtained from the screening carried out to determine
the distribution of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles in the
germplasm collection. As shown in Table 3, no recombinant genotypes were found among Lpx-B1.1a, Lpx-B1.1b
and Lpx-B1.1c, as expected from alleles at the same
locus. All of the genotypes had one of the three alleles
at the Lpx-B1.1 locus, although none of them showed
both Lpx-B1.2 and Lpx-B1.3. These data suggest that
other alleles that were not detected with the primers
used might exist at the Lpx-B1.2 and Lpx-B1.3 loci in
the durum wheat germplasm. The haplotype analysis at

the Lpx-B1 locus highlighted three different groups of
genotypes, an example of which is shown in Figure 3B.
Haplotype I included exclusively old genotypes released
before 1971, carrying the Lpx-B1.1b allele associated
with the Lpx-B1.3 gene, while haplotypes II and III comprised genotypes carrying Lpx-B1.1a and the Lpx-B1.1c,
respectively, associated with the Lpx-B1.2 gene (Table
2). The only exception to this classification was the old
genotype Cappelli, that presented the Lpx-B1.1a allele
associated with the Lpx-B1.3 gene.
Isolation and characterisation of full-length Lpx-B1 cDNAs
from mature grains

The full-length Lpx-B1 transcripts were isolated after
amplification of cDNA from mature grains. Five
expressed sequences were isolated that were identical to
the coding sequences deduced from the corresponding

Page 6 of 18

Lpx-B1 genes and alleles, thus demonstrating that they
were all actively transcribed, with four of them potentially encoding functional LOX-1 isoforms. Three of the
expressed sequences [GenBank: HM126471, HM126473,
HM126475] corresponded exactly to the coding
sequences of the three alleles at the Lpx-B1.1 locus,
Lpx-B1.1a, Lpx-B1.1b and Lpx-B1.1c (respectively)
(Table 2). For the deleted allele, it is important to note
that the lack of the canonical acceptor site in the 5’-portion of the last exon activates a cryptic AG splice site
that corresponds to positions + 8 and + 9 of the last
exon; this results in a mature mRNA that lacks the first
nine nucleotides of the last exon. The other two
sequences [GenBank: HM126472, HM126474] were
100% identical to the coding sequences deduced from
the Lpx-B1.2 and Lpx-B1.3 genes (respectively) (Table
2). The expressed sequences that corresponded to the
complete genes were 2,586 bp long (from start to stop
codon), whereas the deleted variant was 1,101 bp long,
as it lacked a central portion of 1,485 bp, from nucleotide 487 to 1,971 (Table 2).
As shown in the structure analyses of the deduced
protein sequences in Figure 4, the complete transcripts
harboured an open reading frame that encoded a presumed translation product of 861 amino-acid residues,
with a molecular mass of about 96 kDa and a pI around
5.8, estimated using the ProtParam tool [16]. Highly
conserved regions were identified through a comparison
with the best characterised plant LOX protein: soybean
(Glycine max L. Merr.) LOX-1 [17]. Three main features
were identified: (i) the PLAT/LH2 domain (domain I) in
the N-terminal region, which consists of a b-barrel
structure that can facilitate access to the substrate; (ii)
the LOX domain PFAM00305 (domains II-V), which is
typical of the lipoxygenase superfamily and includes the
conserved regions that are important for substrate and
oxygen binding; and (iii) the residues involved in iron
binding (His 516, His 521, His 707, Asn 711 and Ile
861). As expected, the active site had the TV/R motif,
which defines the 9-LOX region specificity in plant 9LOX isoforms [18].
For the deleted transcript, the deletion did not interrupt the frame, thus harbouring an open reading frame
that coded for a putative protein product of 366 aminoacid residues (Figures 4A and 4B) with a molecular
mass of about 40 kDa and a pI of 5.79 [16]. The presumed translation product maintained the b-barrel
structure, but lacked a central region spanning from
domain II to the first half of domain V. As this missing
part of the protein is essential for catalysis, it is likely
that even if produced, this protein will be inactive.
As shown in Table 4, the three Lpx-B1.1 alleles shared
high identity at both transcript and amino-acid
level (99.2-99.3%, in bold). The complete Lpx-B1.1a and

were expressed at high levels. Particularly high levels of

alleles in haplotypes I and III, respectively, whereas
slightly lower levels were seen for the transcript corresponding to the Lpx-B1.1a allele in haplotype II. High
levels of expression were also seen for the Lpx-B1.3

Lpx-B1.1b transcripts shared 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 5 of which were silent mutations,
and 9 and 12 SNPs, respectively, with the deleted LpxB1.1c transcript, of which only 3 gave rise to amino-acid
substitutions.
For transcripts that corresponded to the Lpx-B1.2 and
Lpx-B1.3 genes, these were more closely related to each
other than to the Lpx-B1.1 alleles (97.6% vs 95.6% to
95.9% identity). The degree of identity was even higher
at the amino-acid level (99.0%, in bold italic), as only 10
out of the 63 SNPs shared by the two expressed
sequences gave rise to amino-acid substitutions.
Expression analysis of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles in
mature grains

To determine the expression levels of the Lpx-B1 genes
and alleles, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out
on the cDNA isolated from mature grains of the same
18 durum wheat cultivars used in Figure 3B. As shown
in Figure 5, the distribution (presence/absence) among

Figure 5 Expression analysis of Lpx-B1 genes and alleles. Total
RNA was isolated from the mature grains of the 18 durum wheat
cultivars of the germplasm collection and subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis using the same specific primer pairs
used for Figure 3B, and amplification conditions described in
Methods. Normalisation of the PCR reactions was performed using
primers designed on the wheat 17S rRNA constitutive genes. For
cultivar abbreviations, see legend to Figure 3B. The gel separation is
in inverted colours.

Evaluation of LOX-catalysed linoleate hydroperoxidation
and b-carotene bleaching in mature grains

We also evaluated LOX activity in crude protein
extracts of mature grains from the same 18 durum
wheat cultivars used for the gene and transcript analyses. This analysis was based on determination of LOXcatalysed linoleate hydroperoxidation and b-carotene
bleaching, the latter being responsible for pigment loss
during pasta processing. Both of the enzymatic activities
were evaluated on the three field replications of each
cultivar and the data obtained were expressed as enzymatic units (E.U.)/g of dry weight (Table 2) and as percentages of the highest values obtained for the cultivar
Matarese taken as 100% (Figure 6).
As shown in Figure 6, the two activities followed
roughly the same trend among cultivars, as high linoleate hydroperoxidation activity was always associated
with high b-carotene bleaching activity. These data are
in agreement with strict association between these two
LOX-catalysed reactions [5]: the higher the rate of intermediate radicals generation during the LOX-catalysed
linoleate hydroperoxidation, the higher the rate of pigment oxidation. As shown in Table 2, the haplotype I
cultivars showed the highest LOX activities, with mean
values of 4.60 ± 2.38 E.U./g of dry weight for linoleate
hydroperoxidation, and 5.76 ± 1.50 × 10-2 E.U./g of dry
weight for b-carotene bleaching activity. Intermediate
LOX activities were seen in the haplotype II cultivars,
which showed linoleate hydroperoxidation activity of
2.59 ± 1.08 E.U./g of dry weight and b-carotene bleaching activity of 3.34 ± 0.65 × 10-2 E.U./g of dry weight.
Low LOX activities characterised the haplotype III cultivars, with mean enzymatic activities of 0.12 ± 0.09 E.U./
g of dry weight and 0.47 ± 0.23 × 10 -2 E.U./g of dry
weight for linoleate hydroperoxidation and b-carotene
bleaching, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that
the three haplotypes are significantly different (P < 0.05)
with respect to both linoleate hydroperoxidation and
b-carotene bleaching activity.
To determine whether in addition to the quantitative
differences in the levels of active enzyme, the cultivars
that belong to the different haplotypes also had qualitative differences in LOX catalysis, we investigated the

Figure 6 LOX-catalysed linoleate hydroperoxidation and b-carotene bleaching activities. Measurements were carried out on crude extracts
from the mature grains of the 18 durum wheat cultivars of the germplasm collection as reported in Methods. The specific activity was expressed

kinetic parameters of the LOX-catalysed b-carotene
bleaching reaction. This secondary reaction was chosen
as it is the one that is directly responsible for the pigment loss during pasta processing. Two cultivars for
each haplotype were chosen: Trinakria and Kiperounda
for haplotype I, Primadur and Tresor for haplotype II,
and Creso and Ofanto for haplotype III. The data
obtained are shown in Figure 7. In agreement with previous findings [19], the b-carotene bleaching rate
showed a hyperbolic dependence on b-carotene concentration (Figure 7A). Due to the hyperbolic nature of
these kinetics, the data were plotted according to
Michaelis-Menten [20] (Figure 7A), Lineweaver-Burk
[21] (Figure 7B), Hanes [22] (Figure 7C), and EadieHofstee [23] (Figure 7D) plots, and the Km values for
b-carotene were determined from each of these plots.
As shown in Table 5, the four different plots gave the
same Km values. Comparisons among cultivars showed
that the haplotype I and haplotype II cultivars shared
the same affinity for b-carotene (Km around 4 μM),
whereas a significantly different (P < 0.05) Km was
extrapolated for the cultivars belonging to haplotype III
(around 1.2 μM).

Discussion
In durum wheat, there are two Lpx-1 genes on chromosome 4B: Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2. Evidence has been
provided in the literature that deletion of Lpx-B1.1 is
associated with a strong reduction in LOX activity in
semolina [4,10]. This finding is also supported by results
obtained in common wheat (Triticum aestivum Desf.),
which assigned the Lpx-1 genes to the group 4

chromosomes [24,25] and, very recently, highlighted the
existence of a major QTL for LOX activity on chromosome 4B [26,27], thus confirming a significant effect of
this locus on the enzyme activity in wheat seeds.
Despite the relevance of the Lpx-B1 locus in pigment
degradation during pasta processing, its role in this phenomenon has not yet been fully defined. In the present
study, we report the characterisation of the small LpxB1 gene family identified in a large durum wheat germplasm collection, and relate the distribution and expression levels of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles to the
variations in LOX activity in mature grains.
Characterisation of the small Lpx-B1 gene family in
durum wheat germplasm

On the basis of the segregation data, we propose that
the small Lpx-B1 gene family consists of three different
Lpx-B1 genes. All of these genes are located on chromosome 4BS, in agreement with previous reports [10,11].
In addition to the already known Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.2
genes, a new gene designated as Lpx-B1.3 was identified,
along with three different alleles at the Lpx-B1.1 locus.
Mapping data from the Creso × Pedroso and Ofanto ×
Cappelli RIL populations suggested that Lpx-B1.3 is a
separate locus with respect to Lpx-B1.2, even if the two
loci are closely linked (2 cM in Creso × Pedroso, and
0.6 cM in Ofanto × Cappelli). Only one recombinant
line was found in the Ofanto × Cappelli population,
which was between Lpx-B1.2 and Lpx-B1.3, and was
characterised by the absence of both the Lpx-B1.2 and
Lpx-B1.3 bands. Three recombinant lines were found in
the Creso × Pedroso population, and one of these was

characterised by the absence of both the Lpx-B1.2 and
Lpx-B1.3 bands. These data indicate that Lpx-B1.2 and
Lpx-B1.3 represent separate loci.
Comparisons with the orthologous rice 9-LOX1 gene
allowed determination of the exon/intron structure of
the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles. Although these were
highly conserved across these two species, there was
the notable exception of the loss of introns 3 to 5 in
the durum wheat genes. In contrast, the maize and
sorghum orthologues [GenBank: AF465643 and
CM000760, respectively] have maintained introns 3 to
5, but lack introns 6 and 8. All of these cases are precise intron losses that are known to have occurred in
the course of the evolution of these plant genomes

[28], probably as a consequence of homologous recombination between cDNA and its genomic introncontaining locus [29]. Comparisons among the
different LOX-1 genes in grasses strongly suggested
that the independent intron loss events probably
occurred after the divergence of the different subfamilies from their common ancestor.
As expected, sequence comparisons among the five
durum wheat Lpx-B1 genes/alleles revealed a high
degree of conservation across the alleles at the LpxB1.1 locus (more than 99% at the nucleotide level;
Table 4). In contrast, the sequence identity between
Lpx-B1.2 and Lpx-B1.3 was lower (97.6%; Table 4) and
the gene structures highlighted some interesting

differences in terms of intron lengths (Figure 2). In
particular, while the length of introns was perfectly
conserved in the first part of the gene (introns 1 and
2), introns 3 to 6 were all shorter in the HM126469
sequence than in HM126467. Several SNPs and InDel
polymorphisms were also detected through comparisons of the corresponding introns in the different LpxB1 genes and alleles. Here, the length polymorphism
was of particular interest, as has been reported previously [10,11], due to the presence in the last intron
of the Stowaway-type MITE. In agreement with previous findings, a complete MITE was followed by a
partial one (including a direct repeat of the second half
of the element) in the Lpx-B1.1a allele, and there was
a partially deleted element in the Lpx-B1.1b allele,
while in the Lpx-B1.2 and Lpx-B1.3 genes the MITE
was completely absent. These differences are probably
the consequences of different insertions and subsequent excision events, which are known to affect the
Stowaway-type MITE in Triticeae, and which often
leave partial sequences that represent recognisable
footprints of this element (as in the case of the LpxB1.1a and Lpx-B1.1b alleles) [30]. In addition to these
small-scale rearrangements, transposable elements are
also well known for their ability to cause large-scale
rearrangements, including the deletion of sequences
adjacent to the MITE [31]. In the light of this, it is feasible that the instability due to the presence of the
MITE might be responsible for the large deletion in
the Lpx-B1.1c allele, and consequently, for its loss of
function.
As far as the distribution of the Lpx-B1 genes and
alleles in the large germplasm collection of durum
wheat genotypes is concerned, three distinct pools were
identified that corresponded to three different haplotypes (I, II, III). Of note, genotypes released before 1970
included all of these three haplotypes, while all of the
genotypes released successively and characterised by
having short straw belong to haplotypes II and III. Thus
the Lpx-B1.1b allele and the Lpx-B1.3 gene of the haplotype I are absent in the modern germplasm. The Lpx-B1
locus has been mapped to the same chromosomal
region as the Rht-B1b (Rht1) dwarfing gene [32], which
was introduced into durum wheat from the hexaploid
wheat cultivar Norin 10 through introgression. Therefore, it is feasible that the distributions of the Lpx-B1
genes and alleles have been profoundly affected by the
footprint of the selection at the Rht-B1b locus. Previous
findings by Hessler et al. agree with this hypothesis, as
they detected a fragment (J4.2) corresponding to the
Lpx-B1.1b allele in an old and tall landrance that was
grown in north Africa (Jennah Khetifa), and a fragment
(C7.1.2) corresponding to the Lpx-B1.1a allele in a
recent commercial cultivar, Cham 1 [11].

The role of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles in the
determination of LOX-catalysed carotenoid bleaching in
mature durum wheat grains

Comparisons between the data obtained at the molecular and biochemical levels show that in mature durum
wheat grains, there is a closely coupled relationship
between the Lpx-B1 transcripts and LOX catalysis. In
particular, a strict relationship was detected for each
haplotype: (i) at a quantitative level, between the levels
of the Lpx-B1 transcripts and the levels of LOX activity,
which is linearly dependent on the amount of catalytically active enzyme in this tissue; (ii) at a qualitative
level, between the types of Lpx-B1 transcript and the
kinetic behaviour of the LOX-catalysed bleaching
reaction.
For this first point, the haplotype I cultivars are characterised by the higher overall levels of transcript, with
both Lpx-B1.1 and Lpx-B1.3 genes expressed at high
levels. As these both encode putatively functional LOX1 isoforms, high values of total LOX activity are also
detected in these haplotype I cultivars. Intermediate
transcript levels characterise the cultivars of both haplotypes II and III, in which only the allele at the Lpx-B1.1
locus is expressed at high levels. However, as the LpxB1.1a allele gives a putatively functional LOX-1 isoform
while Lpx-B1.1c does not, haplotypes II and III have
intermediate and low LOX activity levels, respectively,
with those of haplotype III being ascribable exclusively
to the low expression levels of the Lpx-B1.2 gene.
There was also a variability in LOX activity among
cultivars belonging to the same haplotype, which cannot
be explained by a corresponding variability in transcript
levels of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles. As there are two
other LOX isoforms, LOX-2 and LOX-3, in cereal
grains, their contributions to the total LOX activity cannot be excluded. Indeed, Carrera et al. demonstrated
that in their population, the Lpx-B1 locus accounted for
54% of the variation in LOX activity in semolina [10];
moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the Lpx-3
transcript can also contribute to the total activity in
mature grains, particularly in high LOX activity cultivars
[4]. The involvement of modifications at post-translational levels that may affect differently the functionality
of the LOX-1 isoforms encoded by the different Lpx-B1
genes and allele cannot also be excluded.
For the second point above, relating to the qualitative
level, the high identity shared at the amino-acid level
between the Lpx-B1.1a and Lpx-B1.1b alleles (99.3%)
and between the Lpx-B1.2 and Lpx-B1.3 genes (99.0%)
strongly suggests that the two putative LOX-1 isoforms
in the haplotype I cultivars share common structural
features with those of the haplotype II cultivars. This
hypothesis is supported by findings obtained at the biochemical level, as the haplotype I and II cultivars share

Verlotta et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:263
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/263

the same kinetic behaviour, as demonstrated by the
comparable Km values for b-carotene that were extrapolated from the corresponding plots. It is important
to note that these Km values obtained are in agreement with the Km previously reported for the haplotype II cultivar Tresor (3.3 ± 0.53 μM; [19]), with the
small difference probably ascribable to the different
enzyme sources used: in the present study, whole-meal
extracts were used, instead of the semolina extracts
used in the previous study. On the other hand, only
one of the two putative LOX-1 isoforms in the haplotype III cultivars is catalytically active, and this results
in a kinetic behaviour (Km values of about 1 μM) that
is significantly different (P < 0.05) from that of both
haplotype I and II cultivars.
In line with these data, recent findings by De Simone
et al. revealed that the haplotype I cultivar Trinakria
and the haplotype II cultivar Primadur shared the same
affinity for linoleate in the LOX-catalysed linoleate
hydroperoxidation reaction in the crude extract from
mature grains [4]. Also in this case, they provided a significantly different affinity for the haplotype III cultivars
Cosmodur and Creso. Moreover, haplotype I and II cultivars were found to share a similar broad bell-shaped
pH profile, which differed significantly from the narrow
peak for the haplotype III cultivars; this thus suggested
at least two LOX isoforms in the haplotype I and II cultivars, and the major contribution of a single isoform in
haplotype III. In this regard, we have partially purified
two LOX isoforms that show different affinities for
linoleate from semolina of the haplotype II cultivar Tresor [19].

Conclusions
In summary, the present study has revealed that there is
a small Lpx-B1 gene family in durum wheat germplasm,
and that the distribution of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles
among the genotypes defines three different haplotypes,
I, II and III, that are associated with high, intermediate
and low LOX activity in mature grains, respectively.
Although haplotype I was lost during the breeding of
the modern short-straw genotypes, there remains high
variability in the modern cultivars for this trait. The
findings of this study will allow a precise selection of
the genotypes bearing the deleted Lpx-B1.1 allele, and
the fixing of haplotype III in all breeding lines, which
will contribute to significant improvements in durum
wheat quality. Further studies aimed at the biochemical
characterisation of the purified LOX-1 isoforms that
correspond to the different Lpx-B1 transcripts detected
in mature grains will extend further our understanding
of the role of the Lpx-B1 small gene family in the determination of LOX activity.

Methods
Plant material and growing conditions

The experiments were carried out on a germplasm collection of 85 genotypes of durum wheat, including old
(released before 1971), intermediate (released between
1971 and 1990) and modern genotypes (released
between 1991 and 2005). This collection was chosen
because it includes all genotypes cultivated in Italy and,
therefore, represents a large portion of the genetic diversity present in this country. Moreover, information
already exist on this collection with respect to the carotenoid content and to the contribution of the Lpx genes
to the carotenoid loss during pasta processing [4].
The 85 genotypes were grown in the open field in the
winter season 2004-2005 at the experimental station of
the Cereal Research Centre of Foggia (Italy) on a clayloam soil (Typic Chromoxerert) with an average organic
matter of 1.97% and a pH 7.7. They were arranged in a
randomized complete block with three replications.
Each experimental unit consisted of a 10.2 m2 plot. Fertilizer applications were made at pre-sowing (36 kg ha-1
N and 90 kg ha-1 P2O5 as ammonium biphosphate) and
top dressing (52 kg ha-1 N as urea) at Zadoks growth
stage 2.2 and 3.1, respectively [33]. For each genotype,
the vegetative material at the third-leaf stage from the
three replications was collected and immediately stored
at -80°C, until used for genomic DNA analysis. The
seeds were harvested at physiological maturity on 13
June 2005 at about 11% moisture; the three replications
were stored at a constant temperature of 4°C and used
to obtain the whole-meal (Tecator Cyclotec 1093) used
for the expression analysis and enzymatic assays.
Assessment of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles among
genotypes

Genomic DNA was extracted from about 50 mg leaves
of each genotype using a Maxwell™ 16 Instrument (Promega) and the apposite kit, following manufacturer
instructions. The concentrations of DNA extracted were
determined using a QuBit fluorimeter (Invitrogen), and
the DNA quality was evaluated by visualisation on agarose gels.
Evaluation of the distribution of the Lpx-B1 genes and
alleles among the genotypes was performed first using
the primer pair LOXA-L1/R1 (Table 1), which has previously been reported to preferentially amplify the LpxB1 locus [10]. The amplification was carried out on
genomic DNA (100 ng) following conditions described
by Carrera et al. [10].
The data obtained were also validated through amplification of each gene and allele using the specific primer
pairs reported in Table 1. To be certain that the missing
bands were not a result of point mutations in the primer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/263

annealing site, amplifications of each fragment corresponding to the complete Lpx-B1.1, Lpx-B1.2 and LpxB1.3 genes were carried out with three different primer
pairs. Due to the high identity between the Lpx-B1.1a
and Lpx-B1.1b alleles, the same primer pairs were used
to amplify the corresponding fragments; as the amplification products included the last intron region, the
MITE length polymorphism allowed size discrimination
of the two amplification products. All of the fragments
were amplified from genomic DNA (100 ng) using GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) under the following
conditions: preheating at 94°C for 5 min, then 35 cycles
of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing/extension
at 72°C for 1 min, followed by final extension at 72°C
for 7 min.
The deleted Lpx-B1.1c allele was amplified using the
same primer pair used for isolation of the full-length
gene sequences (Table 1), but under different amplification conditions: preheating at 94°C for 5 min, then 35
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at
62°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 1 min, followed by
a final extension at 72°C for 7 min; Go-Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) was used. These conditions allowed
amplification of only the deleted gene.
All of the PCR products were visualised on agarose
gels, cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega), and
sequenced on both strands using ABI Prism™ BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing kits on an ABI PRISM™
3130xl Genetic Analyser (PE Applied Biosystem).
Isolation and sequence analysis of the full-length Lpx-B1
genes and alleles

Primer pairs suitable for amplification of the full-length
Lpx-B1 genes and alleles were designed on the in silico
contig reported in Figure 8. This contig was constructed
in silico by overlapping ESTs found with a BLAST
search in the TIGR wheat EST database, using as
queries the full-length cDNA sequence of barley LoxA
[GenBank: L35931] and the partial coding sequences
deduced from both DQ474240 and DQ474241. The
resulting contig shared 92.5% identity with barley

Figure 8 In silico contig corresponding to the putative fulllength Lpx-B1 expressed sequence. ESTs identified through a
BLAST search in the TIGR wheat EST database using the probes of
the full-length cDNA sequence of barley LOX-1 [GenBank: L35931]
and the partial coding sequences deduced from both DQ474240
and DQ474241.

Page 15 of 18

L35931 (from start to stop codon), and in the overlapped regions, 94.9% and 93.1% identity with the predicted partial coding sequences deduced from
DQ474240 and DQ474241, respectively. Different primer pairs were designed and tested on genomic DNA,
and the one that gave a single PCR product of the
expected size was chosen for isolation of the full-length
Lpx-B1 genes and alleles (Table 1).
The full-length Lpx-B1 gene sequences were isolated
from the genomic DNA of three cultivars, each of which
represented one of the three haplotypes: Lpx-B1.1b and
Lpx-B1.3 from Trinakria (haplotype I), Lpx-B1.1a and
LpxB1.2 from Primadur (haplotype II), and Lpx-B1.1c
from Ofanto (haplotype III). The amplification reactions
were performed using the high fidelity “Long Range”
Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and following the manufacturer instructions: preheating at 93°C for 3 min, then
35 cycles of denaturation at 93°C for 15 s, annealing at
62°C for 30 s and extension at 68°C for 7 min. All of
the PCR products were visualised on agarose gels,
cloned and sequenced on both strands.
The gene sequences have been deposited at GenBank,
with the accession numbers of HM126466 (Lpx-B1.1a),
HM126467 (Lpx-B1.2), HM126468 (Lpx-B1.1b),
HM126469 (Lpx-B1.3), and HM126470 (Lpx-B1.1c).
Chromosomal mapping of the Lpx-B1 genes and alleles

The positions of Lpx-B1 genes and alleles in the durum
wheat genome were determined following their segregation in two RIL populations: one that consisted of 123
lines derived from a cross between the durum wheat
cultivars Creso and Pedroso, already described by Marone et al. [34], and one that consisted of 121 lines developed from a cross between the durum wheat cultivars
Ofanto and Cappelli. The parental lines Creso, Ofanto
and Cappelli were all Italian cultivars belonging to the
germplasm collection of the Cereal Research Centre,
Foggia (Italy), while the parental line Pedroso was a
Spanish cultivar provided by the germplasm collection
of the CIFA Alameda del Obispo, IFAPA-CICE, Cordoba (Spain). In both cases the lines were obtained by
advancing random individual F2 plants to the F7 generation by single-seed descent. These populations were
chosen because there were different Lpx-B1 genes/alleles
in the parental genotypes: HM126467 and HM126470 in
Creso and Ofanto, and HM126468/HM126466 and
HM126469 in Pedroso and Cappelli. The Lpx-B1 genes
and alleles were amplified on genomic DNA (100 ng)
from the parental genotypes and the RIL population
lines using the primer pairs specific for each gene and
allele (Table 1), and the same amplification conditions
described above.
The genetic maps were constructed using the Kosambi
mapping function within the JoinMap 4 software [35],

Verlotta et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:263
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/263

considering a minimum LOD score (log10 of the odds
ratio) of 4.0. Six hundred and seventeen markers (180
PCR-based, and 437 DArT) were used to construct the
Ofanto × Cappelli map, while 500 markers (173 PCRbased and 327 DArT) were used to construct the Creso
× Pedroso map [34]. For the DArT assay, DNA from
the two mapping populations was subjected to PstI/TaqI
digestion and size purification and probed against the
durum DArT array at the Pty Ltd (Canberra, Australia;
http://www.triticarte.com.au). The goodness of fit for all
of the loci was tested to an expected 1:1 segregation
ratio, using chi-square analysis. Linkage groups were
assigned to chromosomes by comparing the marker
positions to previously published durum wheat maps
[36-42] and to the hexaploid wheat SSR consensus map
[43]. The details of the Ofanto × Cappelli molecular
marker map will be published separately; in the present
study, only the 4BS linkage group carrying the Lpx-B1
loci is presented.
Isolation and sequence analysis of the full-length Lpx-B1
transcripts

The full-length transcripts were isolated from mature
grains of the same cultivars used for isolation of the
full-length Lpx-B1 gene sequences: Primadur, Trinakria
and Ofanto. Total RNA was isolated from mature grains
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer instructions. The seeds were ground under
liquid nitrogen, and to avoid starch contamination, the
powder obtained was treated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1% sarcosil, 20 mM EDTA,
and 5 mM DTT, and subjected to phenol-chloroform
extraction. The purified samples were then used for Trizol extraction. A DNase treatment step was performed
at the end of the extraction to ensure the removal of
genomic DNA from the total RNA extracted.
The single-stranded cDNA was synthesised using 200
E.U. of SuperScript™II RNase H- reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and a poly(T) primer on 1 μg total RNA,
following the manufacturer instructions. The first cDNA
strand was used as the template for amplification of the
full-length Lpx-B1 expressed sequences using the same
primer pair used for isolation of the full-length genomic
sequences (Table 1) and high-fidelity “Phusion” Taq
DNA polymerase (Finnzyme). The PCR conditions were
as follows: preheating at 94°C for 5 min, then 35 cycles
of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 56°C for
30 s and extension at 72°C for 3 min, followed by final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. All the PCR products
were visualised on agarose gels, cloned and sequenced
on both strands to confirm their identity.
The transcript sequences have been deposited at GenBank, with the accession numbers of HM126471 (Lpx-

Page 16 of 18

B1.1a), HM126472 (Lpx-B1.2), HM126473 (Lpx-B1.1b),
HM126474 (Lpx-B1.3), HM126475 (Lpx-B1.1c).
The deduced protein sequences were subjected to
bioinformatic analysis. Alignments were carried out
using the Vector NTI Suite software (version 9.0; Invitrogen). The physico-chemical parameters of the aminoacid sequences were estimated using the ProtParam
tool, which is available at the ExPASy molecular biology
server http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html. The
conserved domains were determined by using the NCBI
Conserved Domain Database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis

The first cDNA strand was synthesised from total RNA
of mature durum wheat grains from 18 cultivars
selected from the germplasm collection, and was used as
the template for the amplification of fragments corresponding to the Lpx-B1 expressed sequences. Normalisation of the RT-PCR reactions was performed by
amplifying the wheat TC283024, which was 96% identical to the rice gene for the 17S ribosomal RNA. In this
case, single-strand cDNA was synthesised using 200 E.
U. of SuperScript™ II RNase H - reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and random primers, on 1 μg total RNA.
Amplifications of the fragments corresponding to the
Lpx-B1 transcript variants were performed using the
same specific primer pairs (Table 1) and the amplification conditions used for amplification of the corresponding gene fragments, with the notable exception
that 30 cycles were used to ensure semi-quantitative
evaluation of the abundance of the mRNA sequences
analysed. Amplification of the 17S rRNA was performed
using the specific primer pair reported in Table 1, under
the following conditions: preheating at 94°C for 5 min,
then 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min,
annealing at 60°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 1
min, followed by final extension at 72°C for 7 min.
Enzymatic assays

Enzymatic assays of both linoleate hydroperoxidation
and b-carotene bleaching were carried out on crude
whole-meal extracts. The assays of linoleate hydroperoxidation and b-carotene bleaching activity reported in
Figure 6 and in Table 2 were carried out on the same
18 cultivars used for the gene and transcript analyses,
while the assays for the kinetic analysis reported in Figure 7 were carried out on two cultivars for each haplotype: Trinakria and Kiperounda for haplotype I,
Primadur and Tresor for haplotype II, and Creso and
Ofanto for haplotype III. All the assays reported in Figure 6 and 7 and in Table 2 were carried out on the
three field replications of each genotype.

Verlotta et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:263
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/263

Five g of whole-meal were suspended in 10 mL 100
mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The suspension
was placed in an ice-water bath for 1 h, and stirred for
1 min at 15 min intervals, followed by centrifugation
(twice) at 35,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant
was stored in an ice-water bath and used on a daily
basis. Protein content was determined according to the
Lowry method [44], using bovine serum albumin as the
standard.
Linoleate and b-carotene solutions were prepared
essentially as reported in [19]. Linoleate hydroperoxidation was assayed following absorbance increase at 234
nm, due to the conversion of linoleate into the corresponding hydroperoxide (ε = 28 mM-1 cm-1). The reaction mixture consisted of 2 mL 50 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 6.6) containing 500 μM linoleate. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 mg crude protein
extract. One E.U. of linoleate hydroperoxidation activity
corresponded to the formation of 1 μmol conjugated
diene per min at 25°C. b-carotene bleaching activity was
determined by monitoring the absorbance decrease at
460 nm due to the disappearance of b-carotene (ε =
123.5 mM-1⋅ cm-1) [19]. The reaction mixture consisted
of 2 mL 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) containing 1 mM linoleate, 6 μM b-carotene, 2.0 μL/mL
Tween 20 and 0.33 μL/mL Tween 80. In Figure 7, the
b-carotene concentration was varied as indicated. The
reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 mg protein
extract. One E.U. of b-carotene bleaching activity corresponded to the disappearance of 1 μmol b-carotene per
min. All of the assays were carried out at pH 6.6 to
simulate conditions that occur during pasta processing.
To be sure that these reactions were specifically catalysed by LOX, both linoleate hydroperoxidation and bcarotene bleaching were completely inhibited by addition of propylgallate (500 μM), one of the most specific
inhibitors of LOX activity [45] (data not shown).
All of the measurements were carried out using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 UV/VIS spectrophotometer.
GRAFIT 4.0 software (ERITHACUS, from SIGMA Chemical Co.) was used to analyse the data.
Data from the enzymatic assays were reported as
mean of the three field replications ± S.D. Results were
subjected to Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test using JMP Starter 8.0 software (SAS. Institute
Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) to determine significant differences among haplotypes. An alpha level of 0.05 was
used for statistical significance.
