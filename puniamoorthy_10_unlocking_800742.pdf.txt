Unlocking the “Black box”: internal female
genitalia in Sepsidae (Diptera) evolve fast and are
species-specific
Nalini Puniamoorthy1,2*†, Marion Kotrba3†, Rudolf Meier2†

Abstract
Background: The species-specificity of male genitalia has been well documented in many insect groups and
sexual selection has been proposed as the evolutionary force driving the often rapid, morphological divergence.
The internal female genitalia, in sharp contrast, remain poorly studied. Here, we present the first comparative study
of the internal reproductive system of Sepsidae. We test the species-specificity of the female genitalia by
comparing recently diverged sister taxa. We also compare the rate of change in female morphological characters
with the rate of fast-evolving, molecular and behavioral characters.
Results: We describe the ectodermal parts of the female reproductive tract for 41 species representing 21 of the
37 described genera and define 19 morphological characters with discontinuous variation found in eight structures
that are part of the reproductive tract. Using a well-resolved molecular phylogeny based on 10 genes, we
reconstruct the evolution of these characters across the family [120 steps; Consistency Index (CI): 0.41]. Two
structures, in particular, evolve faster than the rest. The first is the ventral receptacle, which is a secondary sperm
storage organ. It accounts for more than half of all the evolutionary changes observed (7 characters; 61 steps; CI:
0.46). It is morphologically diverse across genera, can be bi-lobed or multi-chambered (up to 80 chambers), and is
strongly sclerotized in one clade. The second structure is the dorsal sclerite, which is present in all sepsids except
Orygma luctuosum and Ortalischema albitarse. It is associated with the opening of the spermathecal ducts and is
often distinct even among sister species (4 characters; 16 steps; CI: 0.56).
Conclusions: We find the internal female genitalia are diverse in Sepsidae and diagnostic for all species. In
particular, fast-evolving structures like the ventral receptacle and dorsal sclerite are likely involved in postcopulatory sexual selection. In comparison to behavioral and molecular data, the female structures are evolving 2/3
as fast as the non-constant third positions of the COI barcoding gene. They display less convergent evolution in
characters (CI = 0.54) than the third positions or sepsid mating behavior (CICOI = 0.36; CIBEHAV = 0.45).

Background
The diversity and morphology of male genitalia have
been well documented in many insect taxa [1-7], and
most evolutionary biologists agree that sexual selection
is responsible for driving the frequent and rapid divergence of these structures [6,8-11]. In comparison to
male structures, the external and internal female reproductive tract is largely a “black box” that remains poorly

known. Taxonomists routinely use male but not female
genitalia for species identification, and there is some evidence that female genitalia are indeed less variable than
their male counterparts [12,13]. However, it is important
to remember that most taxonomists are interested in
studying structures that are easily accessible and preserve well under different conditions (e.g., ethanol,
pinned specimens). Male genitalia, and in particular the
intromittent organ, are ideal candidates, because they
are external and generally well sclerotized [1,14,15]. In
contrast, the part of the female reproductive tract that is
interacting with the male intromittent organ and thus
most likely to show species-specific differences is

internal, fairly inaccessible, and membranous. It is therefore not surprising that relatively few systematists routinely study the internal female genitalia for taxonomic
purposes, and much less comparative data are available
for females. Here, we target the internal female reproductive tract in a comparative study across the Sepsidae
(Diptera: Insecta).
The female reproductive tract has recently attracted
more attention for other reasons [16-21]. It is likely
involved in sexual conflict, sperm competition, and
cryptic female choice [8,9,22-24] and generally acknowledged that detailed knowledge of the morphology of the
reproductive organs is crucial for understanding their
role in post-copulatory sexual selection [25,26]. For
instance, in Diptera, some studies use morphological
data for investigating post-copulatory sexual selection
through female choice [e.g: Muscidae, [18], Dryomyzidae
[27], and Tephritidae, [28]], sperm competition [e.g.:
Drosophilidae, [11,26,29]] or sexual arms races [e.g.:
Scathophagidae, [22]]. These studies indicate that
females can influence paternity by differentially storing
sperm from various males in separate sperm storage
organs (e.g., spermathecae) and controlling which sperm
is used for fertilizing eggs [19,26,30]. For example, in
phlebotomine sandflies (Psychodidae), the male intromittent organ (i.e. the aedaegus) deposits sperm directly
into the spermathecae, extending past the length of the
spermathecal ducts [31,32]. This, however, is not the
case for most Diptera where males deposit the sperm in
the bursa copulatrix (i.e. the vagina) and/or close to the
spermathecal duct openings [28]. Based on studies of incopula pairs of Microsepsis and Archisepsis, this is also
the case in Sepsidae, sometimes involving the formation
of an internal spermatophore [33-35].
With the exception of a few [16,22,26,36], most studies of the female reproductive tract in Diptera are
based on single species and comparative data across
multiple species are rare. Here, we present information
on a large number of species of Sepsidae, a family of
flies that is frequently used in sexual selection studies.
Currently, the internal female reproductive system of
Sepsidae is poorly known. Early schematic depictions
are superficial or even misleading in their generalizations of the female structures [37-39]. More recently,
there is photographic documentation in Kotrba [40] for
a Sepsis specimen, as well as drawings by Ozerov [41]
for a Themira specimen, but the most informative
description thus far is by Eberhard and Huber [33]
based on photos and drawings of several Archisepsis
species. These authors document the presence of two
spermathecae, a common oviduct, a vagina, a terminal
sternite at the posterior end as well as an armored ovipositor wall. There are, however, disparities among the
accounts. Eberhard and Kotrba identified a ventral

Page 2 of 21

receptacle, which is not mentioned by Ozerov. Similarly,
Eberhard and Ozerov illustrated the presence of a large,
dorsal vaginal sclerite/plate, which is not identified in
Kotrba [40]. In addition, Eberhard’s drawing indicates
the presence of a smaller anterior sclerite and a ventral
sac, which are not illustrated by the other two authors.
These could be a result of species-specific differences,
but at this point we just do not know enough about the
internal female reproductive system of this family to be
certain.
The Sepsidae are an acalyptrate family of flies of the
Sciomyzoidea with approximately 320 described species
in 37 genera. These flies are abundant worldwide and
numerous species have broad distributions that span
more than one continent [42]. Sepsid larvae and most
adults are saprophagous i.e. closely associated with
various decaying organic substrates. In recent years, sepsids have become models for testing sexual selection
theories because they are strongly sexually dimorphic
with respect to the male forelegs and terminalia and
they also display elaborate courtship behavior
[34,43-47]. The analysis presented here is part of a series
of papers that uses a comparative approach to understanding the “creative powers” of sexual selection in
diversifying morphology and behavior [47-50]. We provide the first comparative study of the internal female
reproductive tract across Sepsidae (41 species representing 21 of the 37 described genera), using microscopic
techniques that have been optimized to reveal even
delicate structures such as the ventral receptacle.
Our study has three main aims. First, we investigate
whether the internal female genitalia are species-specific
in Sepsidae. For this purpose we include eight sisterspecies pairs that are very closely related based on morphological (male genitalia, male forelegs) and/or DNA
sequence evidence. Second, we reconstruct the evolution
of the female tract in Sepsidae by assembling a matrix
based on characters describing the morphological variation in females and mapping it onto molecular [48,51]
and morphological [52-54] phylogenetic hypotheses. We
recently also published a comparative study on sepsid
mating behavior [47] that documented rapid evolution
and high levels of convergent evolution in behavioral
characters that were comparable to fast evolving molecular characters such as the third positions in protein
encoding mitochondrial genes. Our third aim is to
assess whether the female reproductive system evolves
similarly fast. We thus compare the number of character
changes and quantify the level of convergence in our
data set with the amount of change in mating behavior
and the DNA barcoding gene used for species-identification [55,56]. We also identify and describe fast-evolving
female structures that are likely candidates for future
studies of post-copulatory sexual selection in Sepsidae.

Methods
1) Testing the species-specificity of female genitalia in
Sepsidae
Taxon sampling

We studied 41 species representing 21 of the 37
described genera (Table 1). To test the species-specificity of female structures, we included eight sister-species
pairs that are closely related according to either male
structures and/or DNA sequence evidence: (1) The
common Holarctic Themira biloba and T. putris are
morphologically so similar that they were considered
one species until 1975 (Andersson, 1975); (2) Meroplius
fukuharai was only described in 1984 because it is very
similar to M. minutus [57]. The remaining sister pairs
differ by <2% for the DNA barcoding gene COI (see discussion): (3) Dicranosepsis emiliae & D. hamata, (4)
Sepsis cynipsea & S. neocynipsea, (5) S. duplicata & S.
secunda, (6) S. fulgens & S. orthocnemis, (7) S. punctum
& S. monostigma, and (8) T. flavicoxa & T. lucida [51].
Morphological study

Our investigation of the female reproductive tract is primarily based on dissections of freshly killed and alcoholpreserved specimens. Only for Susanomira caucasica
did we use pinned material (Table 1). Live flies were
killed either by freezing or with a killing jar and dissected immediately in Ringer’s solution under a Leica
MZ16 microscope, while alcohol preserved and pinned
specimens were macerated in KOH prior to dissection.
Details on the external morphology of the female genitalia were not included in this study as there was not
much change across the family. After dissection, we
removed the internal reproductive tracts and mounted
them, usually in a dorsoventral orientation, on glass
slides in polyvinyl-lactophenol with an admixture of
chlorazol black E. This medium progressively macerates
the soft tissue while staining unsclerotized cuticular elements of the specimen blue. Dissections of fresh material yielded better results especially with respect to the
membranous parts. Nonetheless, macerated specimens
were sufficient for identifying the most important
structures.
The slide preparations were studied under bright field
and differential interference contrast (DIC) using a Zeiss
Axioskop 2 equipped with a drawing tube as well as a
Zeiss AxioCam digital camera. We prepared schematic
drawings as well as photographic images at high magnifications for all the species. Descriptions of the internal
reproductive tract are based on one to seven dissections
per species (Table 1). The drawings focus on those
structures that are ectodermal in origin and are lined
with cuticle, thus omitting ovaries, lateral and common
oviducts. The terminology of the morphological structures follows a recent glossary by Kotrba [58]. The term

Page 3 of 21

“sclerotized” refers to darkened cuticular structures that
are not stained blue by chlorazol black E and appear
brown under the bright field.
Sister-species comparisons

A character matrix was assembled for 41 sepsid species
plus Willistoniella pleuropunctata (Ropalomeridae) as
outgroup using MacClade 4.0 [59]. Nineteen morphological characters were defined based on the discontinuous variation of the female reproductive tract (Table 2).
In order to test for species-specificity, we used the
matrix to identify species that have identical character
scores for the discontinuous variation. For these species
pairs, we then assessed whether morphological structures with continuous variation across the family
allowed for the differentiation of these species. In addition, using PAUP* [60], we calculated the uncorrected
pairwise distances based on our female morphological
data set as well as the distances for the COI barcoding
gene [55] in order to compare the amount of character
change across multiple data sets.
2) Reconstructing the evolution of female genitalia

There is indication in sepsids that the phylogenetic signal from molecular sequences can conflict with that of
morphological data [51]. We therefore mapped our
female morphological characters onto two different phylogenetic hypotheses. Using PAUP* [60], we generated a
molecular phylogeny based on DNA sequence data of
10 gene fragments from Ang et al.[48] and Su et al.[51]
(87 sepsid species + 2 outgroups; heuristic search; 100
random stepwise additions; TBR branch swapping). A
new analysis was needed to place the recently described
Perochaeta dikowi, which is included in our study and
whose DNA sequence data was added to Su et al.’s data
using the concatenation software SequenceMatrix [61].
We also mapped the characters onto an earlier morphological phylogeny that was reconstructed based on egg,
larval, and adult characters [52-54]. Our study of the
female reproductive system has complete taxon overlap
with the molecular phylogeny, while only 38 species are
shared with the morphological tree; i.e., some species
had to be deleted for the pairwise comparison with the
morphological tree. The character mapping was performed in MacClade 4.0 [59] and we recorded the
amount of change (tree length) and level of homoplasy
as quantified by the consistency index (CI). Given that
taxon number was kept constant in the pairwise comparisons, this avoids the problem of a negative correlation between CI and the number of terminals [62].
3) Quantifying the amount of change

To estimate the rate of change in the internal female
reproductive characters, we compared our female

Nineteen morphological characters scored across 41 sepsid species and the outgroup. Characters for: Ventral receptacle = 1-7; Dorsal sclerotization = 8-11;
Spermathecae and spermathecal ducts = 12-16; Sternite VIII = 17; Ovipositor = 18 & 19.

Due to incomplete taxon overlap between the behavior
and female morphology data, we could only include the
22 species for which both data are available (Table 1).
In MacClade 4.0 [59], we subsequently mapped all the
different characters on the molecular phylogeny derived

from the earlier-mentioned phylogenetic analysis. In
order to assess the degree of homoplasy in our female
reproductive characters, we mapped them onto the
molecular phylogeny and calculated the number of
observed steps over the minimum number of steps. This

value quantifies the level of homoplasy and is the
inverse of the consistency index. We repeated this for
both the molecular and behavioral data set.
In addition, we split the morphological characters relating to the female reproductive tract according to different
reproductive structures (e.g.: ventral receptacle, dorsal
sclerite, spermathecae, etc.) and mapped them separately
on the molecular tree in order to quantify the amount of
change contributed by the individual structures.

Sepsidae
Morphological descriptions

General description Sepsidae Our description is
restricted to the cuticular elements of the reproductive
tract, which are: the tubular vagina (va), paired dorsal
spermathecae (sp) and accessory glands (ag), the dorsal
sclerite (ds; absent in Orygma luctuosum and Ortalischema albitarse), the ventral receptacle (vr), the ventral evagination (ve), the tubular inverted ovipositor
(ov), and the internalized sternite VIII (St VIII). Please
refer to the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 when
reading and evaluating the descriptive text.

The vagina is an elongate muscular tube lined internally with thin cuticle. It is anteriorly fused with the common oviduct (oc). The spermathecal ducts and the ducts
of the accessory glands respectively open anterodorsally
and posterolaterally into the vagina (Figure 1). This
region of the vagina wall associated with the duct openings is, with the exception of Ortalischema albitarse and
Orygma luctuosum (Figure 6), modified into a dorsal
sclerite (ds), which can be very diverse in shape and
degree of sclerotization. In some species, additional
paired sclerotizations [e.g.: Sepsis fulgens (Figure 1) and
Themira biloba (Figure 9)] occur in the posterior dorsal
vaginal wall. Directly opposite to the spermathecal duct
openings, the anteroventral portion of the vagina gives
rise to the ventral receptacle and, directly posterior to
this, the ventral evagination. When the vagina is empty,
its wall forms numerous folds. This allows the vagina to
become greatly extended when containing a spermatophore after copulation or, in the case of viviparous species, a developing egg or larva [35]. In our dissections
we observed the vagina to contain spermatophores in
some species [e.g: Allosepsis indica, Australosepsis niveipennis, Sepsis dissimilis and S. thoracica] and a single
developing egg in Themira minor (Figure 10).

Figure 2 Morphology of ovipositor (ov) and Sternite VII (StVIII). (A) Ovipositor wall is densely covered with large, single and evenly spaced
spines, and posterior part of sternite VIII is clearly bifurcated in Themira biloba; (B) Ovipositor wall is lined with tiny spines in regular rows, and
posterior part of sternite VIII is fused in Dicranosepsis crinta

The vagina tapers and opens into the likewise tubular ovipositor, which, together with sternite VIII, is
invaginated from the body surface between sternite
VII and the terminalia. In some species, the apical
portion of sternite VIII is clearly bifurcated, while in
others it is fused. The ovipositor wall is, with the
exception of Toxopoda and Platytoxopoda, internally
ornamented to a variable degree with spines or tiny
denticles that may be arranged as singles, clusters or
rows (Figure 2).

All sepsids have two strongly sclerotized spermathacae
that are usually round, although ovoid, mushroom- and
barrel-shaped forms also occur. They are at times highly
telescoped [e.g: Allosepsis indica (Figure 4) and Themira
superba (Figure 10)]. The spermathecal capsules can be
of equal or, more often, of distinctly unequal size. In
one species, Toxopoda sp., we found the spermathecal
capsules to be almost entirely reduced (Figure 10).
Moreover, in some species their wall is ornamented
with transverse wrinkles or spines [e.g.: Paratoxopoda

amonanae (Figure 6) and Platytoxopoda (Figure 7)
respectively]. The latter are usually connected to cuticular end apparatuses of gland cells in the surrounding
glandular tissue. In Ortalischema albitarse, the spermathecae have a particularly elaborate shape with a belt
of spines around their perimeter and an apical spiny
crown (Figure 6).
The spermathecal ducts can likewise be either equal
or unequal in length. They can (i) open near to each
other but separately into the dorsal vaginal wall [e.g.:
Themira biloba (Figure 9)], or (ii) open into a common
pouch of the vagina wall, sometimes together with the
accessory gland ducts [e.g.: Archisepsis scabra (Figure 4)].
This pouch can be of considerable length. In one species, Meroplius fukuhari, it forms a heavily sclerotized
‘sleeve’ that is associated with the dorsal sclerite (Figure
3). In a few other species, the bases or the apical portions of the spermathecal ducts themselves are weakly
sclerotized [e.g.: Parapaleosepsis plebeia (Figure 6) and
Saltella sphondylii (Figure 7)].

The accessory glands are lined by delicate cuticle,
which is surrounded by a glandular epithelium. Their
size varies across species and they are at times even larger than the spermathecae [e.g.: Dicranosepsis crinita
(Figure 4) and Themira minor (Figure 10)]. The membranous accessory gland ducts are predominantly equal
in length and shorter than the spermathecal ducts.
Because of their very delicate nature they are often lost
in dissections, especially after maceration, which is why
they are distorted or lacking in some of our illustrations.
In all species but Ortalischema albitarse and Orygma
luctuosum, the openings of spermathecal and accessory
gland ducts are framed by the dorsal sclerite, whose
shape most usually resembles that of an inverted heart.
It varies greatly across the family and even between
closely related species within a genus (Figure 11). The
difference in shape as well as in the degree and pattern
of sclerotization is often difficult to describe or code as
characters with discrete states. However there are some
distinctive features, such as the presence of a distinct

honeycomb surface ornamentation at the basal cheeks of
the sclerite and the presence of a long process at its
anterior part [e.g.: Paratoxopoda amonanae (Figure 6)].
The ventral receptacle arises from the anteroventral portion of the vagina and extends anteriorly along the basal
part of the common oviduct. It is also very variable, albeit
mostly between genera (Figure 12). In Orygma, this organ
is very large and of unique shape compared to all other
species. It has an elongate central rod that is quite massive
and flanked by thin-walled lateral chambers (Figure 6).
Due to its significant morphological difference, this structure is difficult to homologize with structures in the other
remaining species. The ventral receptacle in other sepsids,
can be bi-lobed with or without additional internal subdivisions; or it can be multi-chambered with 10 to 80 separate roundish chambers. The interpretation of the multichambered ventral receptacle condition in Decachaetophora aeneipes was somewhat difficult, because in all
seven studied specimens this structure appeared somewhat
disintegrated, although delicate chambers and a diffuse
apical brown spot were discernible (Figure 4). In some

species, the ventral receptacle has a more or less distinct
sclerotized plate apically, and in one species, Allosepsis
indica, this apical portion is enlarged to almost the size of
an additional chamber (Figure 4). In the clade Paratoxopoda + Toxopoda the ventral receptacle is completely
sclerotized and has a modified stalked base (Figure 6 &7
respectively).
The ventral evagination inserts posterior of the ventral
receptacle. From there it extends anteroventrally past
the ventral receptacle. It varies in size, sometimes projecting further than the ventral receptacle, in other species not even reaching the length of that organ [e.g.:
Susanomira caucasica (Figure 9) and Themira lucida
(Figure 10) respectively]. This structure has been termed
‘ventral sac’ by Eberhard and Huber [33].
Description of outgroup species Willistoniella pleuropunctata (Ropalomeridae) The cuticular elements
include a tubular vagina, paired, elongate spermathecae
and accessory glands. However, unlike in sepsids, the
ventral receptacle is tubular and a dorsal sclerite is
absent. Also, there is a small ventral pouch posterior to

the ventral receptacle with unclear homology. In addition, instead of an inverted ovipositor, the vagina opens
posteriorly into a fused sheath formed by segment VIII
and contains the cerci (Figure 10).
Sister species comparisons

Based on our dissections of 41 sepsid species and the
ropalomerid outgroup Willistoniella pleuropunctata, we
defined 19 morphological characters describing the
internal female reproductive tract and scored them
across all taxa (Table 2; 11 binary, 8 multistate characters; 3 ordered, 16 unordered). The detailed character
descriptions are provided as supplementary data (Additional file 1). Of the 42 species included in this study,
only two pairs of taxa, Dicranosepsis distincta &D. emiliae (non-sister taxa) and Sepsis duplicata &S. secunda
(sister taxa) have identical character codes for the
female reproductive tract. All other species differ in at
least one character.
For the eight sister-species pairs, we quantified the
amount of changes separating them based on uncorrected pairwise distances (PD) derived from our female
data set and the variable third positions for the COI

barcoding gene. They are: (i) Dicranosepsis emiliae - D.
hamata [PDFEM = 5.56%, PDCOI = 1.49%]; (ii) Meroplius
fukuharai - M. minutus [PD FEM = 16.7%, PD COI =
13.4%]; (iii) Sepsis duplicata - S. secunda [PDFEM = 0%,
PDCOI = 1.97%]; (iv) S. cynipsea - S. neocynipsea [PDFEM
= 5.56%, PDCOI = 1.34%]; (v) S. fulgens - S. orthocnemis
[PDFEM = 5.56%, PDCOI = 0.76%]; (vi) S. monostigma - S.
punctum [PD FEM = 22.2%, PD COI = 3.25%]; (vii) Themira biloba - T. putris [PD FEM = 27.8%, PD COI =
9.37%]; (viii) T. flavicoxa - T. lucida [PDFEM = 5.56%,
PDCOI = 0.69%] (Figure 9). Seven of these pairs exhibit
greater difference in the female characters than the COI
barcode (c2 test, 1 df; p = 0.034).
2) Reconstructing the evolution of female genitalia

Our heuristic search yielded three most parsimonious
trees (19939 steps), and the strict consensus tree was
pruned to include only the 42 species covered in this
study. Given that the differences between the three
equally parsimonious trees affect species that were not
included here, the tree for our 42 species is fully dichotomous. We refer to this tree as the molecular phylogeny

S. duplicata.

from this point forth (Figure 13). Tracing our morphological characters on the molecular phylogeny with 42
taxa required 120 steps (CIMOL = 0.41). For the comparison with the morphology-based phylogeny, we had to
exclude taxa not included in the morphology-based
hypotheses [52-54]. After culling these, our tree
included 38 taxa and the female internal reproductive
characters require five more steps than on the molecular
tree. Overall, we thus found that the evolution of the
female internal reproductive characters is more in line
with the recent molecular phylogeny (113 steps; CIMOLcul = 0.42) than the earlier morphology-based hypothesis
(125 steps; CIMORPH = 0.38). Hence, we decided to use
the molecular phylogeny for the subsequent discussion
of character evolution (Figure 13).
3) Quantifying the amount of change

The ventral receptacle morphology contributed seven of
the 19 characters and accounted for 61 of the 120 steps.
The remaining 12 characters were based on the dorsal
sclerite (4 characters; 16 steps), ovipositor (2 characters;
13 steps), sternite VIII (1 character; 3 steps),

spermathecae (3 characters; 15 steps) and spermathecal
ducts (2 characters; 12 steps). We also quantified the
level of homoplasy by computing the number of
observed steps over the minimum number of steps for
the characters (the inverse of the CI). Morphological
characters related to the female reproductive tract have
lower levels of homoplasy (Female: Obs./Min = 1.84)
compared to non-constant third positions of the DNA
barcoding gene (DNA: Obs./Min = 2.77) and the behavioral data (Behavior: Obs./Min = 2.21). (Additional file
2).

Discussion
The morphology of female sperm storage organs could
play an important role in post-copulatory sexual selection, influencing where the sperm is stored, how it is
dispensed and whether it can be displaced. In sepsids,
the main sperm storage organs are the two spermathecae and the ventral receptacle. The spermathecae are
not greatly modified across the family, although there
are differences in shape and size between species.
Accordingly, the spermatheacae only contribute three of

the 19 characters in our matrix, which account for
12.5% of the total change observed. The spermathecal
ducts and ovipositor contribute even fewer changes
(10% and 10.8% respectively), while the sternite VIII
accounts for the least amount of change (2.5%). However, there are two features of the female reproductive
tract that are evolving at a fast rate: the dorsal sclerite,
which could be interacting with the male phallus and
the ventral receptacle, which has been proposed as the
likely the site of fertilization in several dipterans [63,64].
We believe that both structures are potential targets of
post-copulatory sexual selection in Sepsidae.
The species-specificity of the female reproductive system
in Sepsidae

With the exception of two pairs of species that are identical at the character matrix level, every other species
has a unique combination of morphological characters
(Table 2) and even the “identical” species differ with
regard to morphological differences in characters that
have continuous variation across the family. For both
sister pairs [Dicranosepsis distincta &D. emiliae (Figure

14A) and Sepsis duplicata &S. secunda (Figure 14B)] the
patterns of sclerotization on the dorsal sclerite differ.
Although these differences are difficult to describe or
code as characters with discrete states, they are nevertheless sufficiently distinct to allow for the unambiguous
identification of the species. We thus find that closely
related sepsid species do differ with respect to the
female genitalia. In fact, based on the comparisons of
the eight pairs of close relatives, all but S. duplicata and
S. secunda, had higher pairwise distances in the female
data than the COI barcode (c2 test, 1 df; p = 0.034).
But did these differences in the female reproductive
tract evolve quickly? In the absence of a good fossil
record for Sepsidae, we can only use molecular data as
a point of comparison. Most species of Diptera differ
by 3-5% for the COI barcode [56,65]. Several of the
closely related species-pairs that we used in our study
have much lower pairwise distances: D. emiliae and
D. hamata (1.49%), S. cynipsea and S. neocynipsea
(1.34%), S. fulgens and S. orthocnemis (0.76%), Themira
flavicoxa and T. lucida (0.69%). These low genetic distances imply that the morphological differences in the

female reproductive structures must have arisen very
fast. There are many studies that focus on the rapid
divergence and species-specificity of male structures and
emphasize the lack of stark differentiation in female
structures [6,8,9,15,66,67]. Our study indicates that, the
internal female genitalia in Sepsidae are not only diverse
but also evolve fast and are as diagnostic for species as
male genitalia and forelegs.
Fast-evolving female structures and their potential role in
post-copulatory sexual selection
The dorsal sclerite

The dorsal sclerite evolves rapidly across the sepsid
family, representing four characters in the matrix and
13.4% of all changes observed. This structure is variable
even within a genus (Figure 11) and between closely
related species. In Ozerov’s schematic drawing of a Themira sp., he indicated that the female reproductive tract
had a ‘vaginal plate’, and we believe he was referring to
the dorsal sclerite [41]. However, he did not explain the
functional significance of this structure. Eberhard and
Huber [33] studied the copulation and sperm transfer in
male Archisepsis and gave a detailed description as to
how the male intromittent organ interacts with the

female reproductive tract. They state that in addition to
spiny erectable processes that anchored to the vaginal
wall, the male aedaegus also had a surface densely covered with large, stiff bristles that can be pressed against
the surface of a large ‘vaginal sclerite’ (i.e. the dorsal
sclerite) [33]. Given this description, one possible reason
for the species-specific diversity in the dorsal sclerite in
females, is that it has co-evolved with the species-specific male intromittent organ with which it interacts.
Sexual conflict results from the asymmetries in evolutionary interests between males and females, particularly,
in relation to the control over reproduction. Both sexes
accumulate traits in the form of a coevolutionary sexual
arms race, with males persisting to achieve copulation
using ‘weapons’ and females resisting their attempts with
‘defenses’ [68,69]. Hence, both sexes are being pulled in
opposing directions resulting in the exacerbation of these
antagonistic adaptations [70,71]. In sepsis, recent artificial
selection experiments in Sepsis cynipsea indicate that
with increasing population densities and a polyandrous
system, the harm inflicted by male persistence behaviors
can result in the evolution of female resistance behaviors
[45,72,73]. Hence, it is possible that the highly diverse
dorsal sclerites documented in this study arose as a

female response or defense to prevent and/or reduce
harm caused by the heavily armored male genitalia (i.e.
coevolutionary morphological arms race).
Another possible explanation is that the dorsal sclerites act as structures that detect male genital stimulation
(i.e. female choice) [74]. In some tsetse flies, the males
have been documented to stimulate the female internally
with their aedaegus during copulation, prior to insemination [18,33-35]. In fact, in certain neotropical sepsids,
males have been observed to repeatedly stimulate the
females externally using their highly modified claspers
to squeeze them in a rhythmic repertoire [44]. It is thus
likely that the male intromittent organs are rubbing
against the dorsal scleroses and serve as courtship signals to influence post-copulatory female choice. Unfortunately, the phallus of sepsid males are poorly studied
because most species can be identified based on foreleg
and claspers morphology. However, future studies
should test whether male intromittent organs are also
species-specific and how they interact with the female
internal genitalia during copulation.

The ventral receptacle

The ventral receptacle displays a large amount of morphological variation across the Sepsidae, especially
between genera (Figure 12). It contributes seven of the
19 female diagnostic characters and accounts for more
than half of the overall evolutionary change observed
(50.8%). From a multi-chambered state in the more
basal taxa like Susanomira caucasica, Saltella sphondylii and Ortalischema albitarse, the number of chambers in the ventral receptacle decreases drastically
across Sepsidae. This is particularly evident within the
Themira clade where the number of chambers
decreases from 27 to 10. In Dicranosepsis and Sepsis,
the ventral receptacle appears multi-chambered as well
(Figure 4,5 and 7-10 respectively). However, here the
chambers are not clearly defined separate units.
Instead, the two primary compartments are secondarily
subdivided. The ventral receptacle in these is also
clearly bi-lobed unlike the ones of Saltella, Susanomira
or Themira. Based on the position of Dicranosepsis
and Sepsis on the phylogenetic tree as well as the

morphology of the internal subdivisions, we suggest
that the multi-chambered ventral receptacle evolved
twice (indicated by arrows in Figure 12).
The ventral receptacle in Orygma luctuosum is particularly interesting (Figure 6). Based on dissections of
other acalyptrate flies (Kotrba unpublished), we believe
the elongate central rod flanked by thin-walled lateral
chambers of this species to be autapomorphic. Su et al.
[51] discuss conflict between morphological and molecular data in placing Ortalischema albitarse, with molecular data placing it as sister species to Orygma and
morphological data placing Orygma as sister to all
remaining sepsids [54]. Given the unique ventral receptacle condition in Orygma and considering the multichambered ventral receptacle of Ortalischema (Figure 6;
similar to others like Themira and Saltella), our data
are in line with either hypothesis and cannot be used to
resolve the position of Ortalischema.
Another remarkable ventral receptacle structure is
observed in Platytoxopoda and Toxopoda. The base of
the receptacle in these species extends as a stalk-like
tube that terminates in two strongly sclerotized

chambers (Figure 6 &10). These are absent in other sepsids. Interestingly, while the spermathecae of Platytoxopoda are of normal size, the spermathecae in Toxopoda
are drastically reduced in size. Given these dramatic differences in the female reproductive tract, we suggest
that these sister groups would be ideal for future comparative studies investigating the relative importance of
the ventral receptacle versus the spermatheacae in
sperm storage and fertilization. For example, some studies indicate that the evolution of female sperm storage
organs drive the evolution of male sperm and sperm
storage organs [22,26,75]. Hence, it would be interesting
to test whether the length of the long, stalked ventral
receptacle in Platytoxopoda and Toxopoda females is
correlated with sperm length in the males of these
species.
Considering the morphological diversity of the ventral
receptacle in sepsids, the question arises as to its role in
post-copulatory sexual selection. Some recent studies

sperm stored in the spermathecae to the point of fertilization [17,29,76] while in certain drosophilid groups
females actively eject or ‘dump’ sperm [67]. The specific
location where fertilization takes place is still unknown
for most taxa and some authors speculate that the spermathecae provide spermatozoa directly to the eggs
[77,78]. Yet, a study in S. stercoraria, documented that
when the egg was in the vagina, the micropyle was
oriented ventrally, away from the spermathecal duct
openings which open dorsally into the vaginal wall [17].
Indeed, in many acalyptrate Diptera, the ventral receptacle is believed to be the more likely site of fertilization
and some studies document the presence of spermatozoa stored in the ventral receptacle just prior to fertilization [28,79]. For instance, in ovipositing females of the
Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, the ventral
receptacle was the first sperm storage organ to deplete,
implying that it was the site where fertilization occurred
[63], while in the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni,

the spermathecae serve to replenish the ventral receptacle where a small number of sperm is kept for fertilizations [64].
Given that the ventral receptacle is the likely fertilization site in acalyptrate flies [80,81], finding great
diversity in morphological structure in 41 species of
Sepsidae is important. In other dipteran families like
the Opomyzidae and the Tephritidae, the ventral
receptacle is also multi-chambered and each chamber
has been observed to house one to four spermatozoa
[19,82]. In fact, in Drosophilidae, the length of the tubular ventral receptacle (also called the seminal receptacle) in females was suggested to drive the evolution of
male sperm length [75]. The general reduction in ventral receptacle chamber numbers observed in sepsids
prompts future work on the possible coevolution
between the number and length of stored spermatozoa
and the number and volume of chambers in the ventral receptacle.

Figure 14 Differences in pattern of sclerotization on dorsal sclerite among species pairs with identical character coding. (A) Pattern
of sclerotization on dorsal sclerite is different between non-sister taxa Dicranosepsis distincta and D. emiliae; (B) Sister taxa Sepsis duplicata and

Convergent evolution of female reproductive structures
in Sepsidae

sepsid female reproductive tract can be considered a
fast-evolving structure.

We have documented that the female genitalia are
diverse across the Sepsidae, but just how fast and homoplasious are these changes? To answer these questions,
we compared our female data with other character systems such as the non-constant third positions of the
mitochondrial COI barcoding gene [55] and sepsid mating behavior [47]. By calculating the proportion of
observed changes to minimum changes, we derived convergence estimates that indicate that the female morphological characters are evolving at only approximately
2/3 the rate of molecular data (Fem: Obs./Min = 1.84;
CI = 0.54). They are also not as homoplasious as the
third positions (COI: Obs./Min = 2.77; CI = 0.36) or the
mating behavior (Behav: Obs./Min = 2.21; CI = 0.45)
(Additional file 2). However, it is important to remember that third positions of mitochondrial protein-encoding genes evolve particularly fast and so overall, the

Conclusions
We document that in sepsid flies the internal female
genitalia are diverse and are evolving at a much faster
rate than conventionally assumed. This applies in particular to the dorsal sclerite and the ventral receptacle.
The latter potentially plays a crucial role in post-copulatory sexual selection as the likely site of fertilization.
With the baseline data provided in this study, experimental studies can now be designed to investigate the
significance of the ventral receptacle in female choice
and its possible influence on sperm competition. Also,
there are an increasing number of empirical studies that
document the coevolution between male and female
reproductive characters. We strongly suggest that sepsids are an ideal group to study the coevolution because
the female structures are now known and are diverse.
