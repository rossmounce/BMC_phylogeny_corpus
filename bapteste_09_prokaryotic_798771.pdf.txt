Abstract
Background: The concept of a tree of life is prevalent in the evolutionary literature. It stems from attempting
to obtain a grand unified natural system that reflects a recurrent process of species and lineage splittings for all
forms of life. Traditionally, the discipline of systematics operates in a similar hierarchy of bifurcating (sometimes
multifurcating) categories. The assumption of a universal tree of life hinges upon the process of evolution being
tree-like throughout all forms of life and all of biological time. In multicellular eukaryotes, the molecular
mechanisms and species-level population genetics of variation do indeed mainly cause a tree-like structure over
time. In prokaryotes, they do not. Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things, and we need
to treat them as such, rather than extrapolating from macroscopic life to prokaryotes. In the following we will
consider this circumstance from philosophical, scientific, and epistemological perspectives, surmising that
phylogeny opted for a single model as a holdover from the Modern Synthesis of evolution.
Results: It was far easier to envision and defend the concept of a universal tree of life before we had data from
genomes. But the belief that prokaryotes are related by such a tree has now become stronger than the data to
support it. The monistic concept of a single universal tree of life appears, in the face of genome data, increasingly
obsolete. This traditional model to describe evolution is no longer the most scientifically productive position to
hold, because of the plurality of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms involved. Forcing a single bifurcating
scheme onto prokaryotic evolution disregards the non-tree-like nature of natural variation among prokaryotes
and accounts for only a minority of observations from genomes.
Conclusion: Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things. Hence we will briefly set out
alternative models to the tree of life to study their evolution. Ultimately, the plurality of evolutionary patterns
and mechanisms involved, such as the discontinuity of the process of evolution across the prokaryote-eukaryote
divide, summons forth a pluralistic approach to studying evolution.

Background
The history of life and the tree of life: How similar are
they?
Even before Darwin, biologists used the metaphor of a
tree to classify living things [1]. The most prominent historical example, however, is indeed Darwin's "great tree",
which extrapolated a family genealogy to the level of species and beyond to describe the historical relationships
between living entities. He wrote:

The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile
largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may
represent existing species; and those produced during each
former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. .... The limbs divided into great branches, and these
into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when
the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the
former and present buds by ramifying branches may well
represent the classification of all extinct and living species
in groups subordinate to groups (1859: 120) [2].
This image of a tree has resonated cognitively and visually
with both biologists and the wider public, and the history
of systematics attests to an increasingly popular goal of
classifying all organisms not just evolutionarily but also
within a unique and ever-bifurcating pattern of representation, a grand natural system in the shape of a tree. Such
a representation of life's history is now widely known as
the 'tree of life', often capitalized, with modern manifestations including all of the prokaryotes and the protists
(eukaryotic microbes). The tree metaphor, while a helpful
descriptor for the genealogical relationships of macroscopic life, does not describe prokaryote evolution over
the vastness of evolutionary time.
Darwin's theory of descent with modification operates
with just two mechanisms, natural variation (or heritable
variation) and natural selection, acting over vast spans of
geological time. The theory was formulated largely on the
basis of observations of multicellular eukaryotes, organisms visible to the naked eye. Importantly for our arguments here, the tree metaphor came to be connected with
the theory of evolution at a time before biologists had any
ideas about the mechanisms underlying the principle of
natural variation. Although our concepts about the workings of natural selection are hardly different today than
Darwin's 150 years ago, our modern understanding of the
mechanisms of natural variation are orders of magnitude
more detailed than anything Darwin could have imagined. Furthermore, and of central importance to our case,
we now know that the mechanisms of natural variation
are not uniform across all forms of life. Rather, there is a
discontinuity of evolutionary mechanisms, in particular

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

and most importantly across the prokaryote-eukaryote
divide.
At the level of cellular organization the deepest divide in
the living world is that separating eukaryotes from
prokaryotes [3-5]. The same is true that when we view the
world from the standpoint of mechanisms underlying
natural variation. It is undisputed that the genetic mechanisms that generate point mutation and chromosome replication errors are common to both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes; it is also undisputed that mutations inherited
via chromosome replication and cell division give rise to
tree-like structures over time. But the mechanisms of natural variation entailing recombination in its various forms
differ starkly between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Among
eukaryotes, meiosis ensures reciprocal recombination
among homologous chromosomes and reassortment of
alleles within lineages that recombine within or very near
(in the case of hybridization) species boundaries (see [6]
for more details). Moreover, the basic molecular machinery of meiotic recombination and sex was present in the
eukaryote common ancestor, as recent studies strongly
suggest [7-9]. Over geological time that process, which
includes chromosome replication errors, generates treelike structures during eukaryote evolution. While lineage
sorting [10], introgression [10,11], and endosymbiotic
gene transfer [12] are important deviations from a strictly
bifurcating process, no one would doubt that vertebrate
evolution can be approximated by a tree, with furcations,
lineages splittings and no significant amount of reticulation between divergent lineages.
But in prokaryotes, the mechanisms of natural variation
are quantitatively, and many would say fundamentally,
different from what goes on in sexual eukaryotes. These
mechanisms include transformation, transduction [13],
conjugation [13], gene transfer agents [14] and integrons
[15-17]. For instance, recent findings at Lost City hydrothermal field, a specialist environment with low organismal diversity among prokaryotes but a tenfold higher
frequency of transposases than any environment studied
before [18], indicate that transposase-mediated LGT is a
significant and selected contributor to genetic diversity in
that environment. In the context of a donor and a recipient cell, these processes of recombination are always unidirectional, never reciprocal; they can cross taxonomic
boundaries; and they entail the movements of fragments
of chromosomes rather than whole chromosomes. Operating over geological time scales, they result in observations among prokaryotes of the following sorts:
• The new species, Nautilia profundicola sp. nov.,
recently discovered in deep-sea hydrothermal vents
and assigned to the genus Nautilia, shares only 35% of

Page 2 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

its DNA sequences with the previously characterized
species of Nautilia [19].
Three individuals among the same "species" of
Escherichia coli may typically share only 40% of their
combined set of genes. By contrast, three individuals
of the same species of eukaryotes generally have a
nearly identical gene repertoire.
• Strains of the marine heterotrophic bacteria Vibrio,
which are identical at one or more protein-coding
housekeeping loci, can be highly differentiated in
genome size (up to 800 kb variation, ~20% of the
genome) [20]. Likewise, strains of the nitrogen-fixing
soil bacteria Frankia with more than 97% identity in
their rRNA sequences (considered to be the same species under most traditional definitions) can differ by
as many as 3500 genes. This number represents at least
43% of the genes of the larger genome of these 3
strains, and up to 77% of the genes of the smaller
genome of Frankia [21].
• Comparison of the genomes of pathogenic and symbiotic bacterial strains with their close free-living relatives shows that pathogenicity islands and similar
symbiosis islands, clearly acquired via lateral gene
transfer (LGT or HGT), can comprise over 30% of a
bacterial genome [22-24].
• A number of phylogenetic analyses show that
although the rate of LGT between divergent organisms
might be lower among highly conserved genes
involved in information processing than it is among
metabolic enzymes and other "operational" genes
[25], multiple LGT exists at the very heart of the translation system [26-28]. Informational transfers also
occur among ribosomal protein genes and rRNA
encoding operons, transcription system genes, and
RNA polymerase subunits [29].
We have become accustomed to hearing such examples of
extensive chimerism and lateral gene transfer among
prokaryotes, as if they were common-place. They are.
There are no comparable observations among multicellular eukaryotes that would even approach this degree of
massive chimerism, notwithstanding the endosymbiotic
origins of chloroplasts and mitochondria and their associated gene transfers from organelles. The reason is that the
mechanisms of natural variation are different across the
prokaryote-eukaryote divide. Processes that deviate from
the strictly bifurcation pattern of descent also occur
among eukaryotes, including multicellular plants and animals [30]. Yet, the extent of chimerism among prokaryotes is much more dominant, because it is at the core of
processes generating natural variation in these groups.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

The mechanisms of unidirectional spread of genes among
prokaryotes may be slow at the level of individual generations, but over geological timescales, their cumulative
effects are vast. How vast? Although the degree of the
effects that lateral gene transfer has is thought to be highly
variable across prokaryotic lineages [31,32,15], the bottom line of any debate on this issue is that it is entirely
plausible that LGT has affected every single gene in
prokaryotes over the full span of evolutionary history
depicted by the tree of life. If we recapitulate the development of evolutionary thinking from Darwin through the
Modern Synthesis into the age of genomes, we see that
genomes have provided major bodies of evidence for the
prevalence of vertical descent among multicellular eukaryotes, with sexual recombination, mutation, gene and
genome duplications being the main processes that give
rise to genetic novelty. At the same time, genomes gave
microbiologists evidence just as pervasive for the workings of lateral gene transfer during prokaryotic evolution.
However, we have taken the belief in a fundamentally
tree-like process of evolution as observed among most
multicellular eukaryotes and by extrapolation have projected it onto the evolutionary history of prokaryotes. To
sum up our arguments thus far in a single sentence: The
belief in the existence of a universal tree of life - inclusive of prokaryotes - is stronger than the evidence from
genomes to support it.
We are emphasizing the prokaryote/eukaryote dichotomy, and the discontinuity of evolutionary process across
that divide, in order to develop the point that although
the principle of natural variation is uniform across all life,
the processes and mechanisms underlying it are not. This
discontinuity raises questions as to how, whether, and to
what extent we can view prokaryote evolution through the
image of bifurcating trees without obtaining a wholly distorted picture of the process. Either we have one evolutionary mechanism and one evolutionary model that
applies to all life, hence one tree of life, or we have a plurality of processes and models in particular to accommodate the differences between prokaryote and eukaryote
evolution. It is important to keep in mind nonetheless
that, although prokaryotes and eukaryotes evolve in very
distinct ways, justifying in our view different evolutionary
models for their study, most of the protistan diversity
remains currently unexplored and unsequenced. We
acknowledge that it is already known that in single-celled
eukaryotes, endosymbiosis and gene transfer are important processes for innovation [33-37], and the extent to
which evolution of some protists can be approximated by
a furcating tree is currently debated. Increasing knowledge
of the genomes of protists may thus in the future expand
our conclusion: not only are the tree of life and prokaryotic evolution are two different things, but all microbial
evolution (that of prokaryotes and protists) may also be

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

poorly described if addressed in an exclusively tree-like
framework.
In the following we will consider this circumstance from
philosophical, scientific, and epistemological perspectives, surmising that phylogeny opted for a single model
of evolution due to the dominance of the Modern Synthesis account of evolution (which was largely prokaryotefree). We will argue that the universal tree of life, the single traditional model to describe evolution, is no longer
the most scientifically productive position to hold. Forcing a single bifurcating scheme onto prokaryotic evolution disregards the non-tree-like nature of natural
variation among prokaryotes and accounts for only a
minority of observations from genomes. Hence we will
briefly set out alternative models to the tree of life to study
their evolution.

Results and Discussion
One model (monism) or many (pluralism) to study
evolution?
Philosophers have often debated whether one model or
many ought to be used in science, identifying schematically two positions among scientists: the monists and the
pluralists. Those who are inclined to use a single model to
account for all of their data, however complex these might
be, are traditionally called monists. The remainder are
pluralists. In its simplest description, monism designates
a commitment to one model to which all other evidence
and interpretations must be subordinated [38,39]. For
instance, in physics, monism is justified by the appeal for
a single system of fundamental laws that could explain all
physical phenomena. Searching for a unified explanation
is seen as the essence of good scientific practice, since in
that context hypotheses are rigorously applied, evidence
interpreted consistently, and all findings coherently unified by fundamental principles into one overarching theoretical framework. In evolutionary biology, this
approach would be relevant, for instance, if evolution
were a thoroughly homogeneous, structurally simple
process. Then it might be that we should look at the
understanding of evolution as, in effect, a single question,
calling for a single mode of analysis. And this is, essentially, the assumption implicit in much neo-Darwinist
thinking. Furthermore, monism comes in general with an
ontological commitment to a particular class of entities as
the organizing theoretical focus. Typically, in the case of
traditional phylogenetics, these chief objects of study
would be the species. Whether species history is being
traced by genes, genome composition or something else,
the traditional role of phylogeny is to recover their relationships. Consistent with that approach, traditional phylogeneticists consider that species evolution follows a tree,
and processes such as LGT are theorized as supplementary
and thus unthreatening. From that standpoint, even if all

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

individual prokaryotic gene trees disagree, there is still
some universal species tree. In that sense, it seems that scientists exclusively committed to the reconstruction of one
single universal tree (the tree of species or tree of life)
embrace or are inspired by a monistic perspective on the
process of evolution, in which lateral processes are not
admitted at all or play only a secondary role. In the rest of
this manuscript, we will call this position tree-monism.
However, there are objections to a monistic approach,
and not only in biology. Pluralism opposes monism. Pluralism in philosophy of science (and political philosophy) means the conviction that different models may be
legitimate to analyze a phenomenon, and that conflict
between them need not be seen as invalidating one or
more alternative approaches [38,39]. Many pluralists
would justify their pluralism with the claim that the world
itself is not carved up in a way that is conducive to the
application of one approach only, and that a richer understanding of the phenomena can be gained with the application of more than one approach. Pluralism should be
unsurprising for biologists since they are dealing with
thoroughly complex objects. Thus their scientific models,
to provide any possibility of insight and understanding,
must focus only on specific and limited aspects of this
complex reality. One should then anticipate that different
questions should best be addressed using different concepts or models. This has important bearing on our practice of evolutionary biology. Once it is accepted that
different classes of biological entities are evolving to some
extent in different ways (as do prokaryotes and eukaryotes, for instance), then it is a wholly empirical question to
what extent the same processes will be equally significant
in explaining evolutionary histories. It is also an entirely
empirical question whether the perspective best fitted to
gaining insight into one class of objects or processes (e.g.
the eukaryotes) will be the same as that most appropriate
to another (e.g. the prokaryotes) and, indeed, whether any
single perspective will adequately illuminate a particular
class of objects or processes. With regard to the tree of life,
the pluralistic position has thus been regularly advanced
by microbial phylogeneticists who have emphasized the
diversity of evolutionary processes and entities at play in
the microbial world [40,41]. This group prefers to model
evolution as a diverse set of processes acting on the histories of diverse kinds of entities generating, finally, a diversity of overlapping and cross-cutting patterns,
corresponding to different evolutionary outcomes. For
such pluralists, depending on the approach taken (e.g.,
the choice of sequence, the choice of the reconstruction
method, the taxa of interest), a different evolutionary pattern may be generated (e.g. a reticulated network rather
than a vertical tree). Embracing this latter view, we will
now argue that using a single tree-like model to describe
all life evolution is no longer the most scientifically pro-

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

ductive to hold. In other words, we should approach the
study of prokaryote genome evolution openly, and no
longer subordinate our approaches to the study of microbial evolution to the preconceived notion of a tree.
Limits of traditional tree-monism
In addition to its limits in accounting for the different evolutionary processes emphazised by the prokaryote/
eukaryote divide, there are many methodological and
epistemological reasons why tree-monism may not be any
longer the most scientifically fruitful position from which
to study microbial evolution. We will examine some of
these issues in order to show how tree-monism falls short
in many ways.
Methodological issues
Problem 1: The circularity and arbitrariness of tree methods
The most traditional tree of life hypothesis, ignoring LGT,
predicts that trees of single-copy genes (orthologs) from a
common taxonomical sampling should be congruent
with one another and with the species tree. Thus, the goal
of the phylogenetic analysis has long been to reconstruct
this common topology. No gene tree alone can fully
resolve the entire species tree of all life forms [31], so
genes are often combined into a single analysis under the
tree-monistic assumption that they all share the same vertical history. In doing so, the aim is to reduce effects of
small sample size (stochastic errors) in phylogenetic calculations, thereby reinforcing the true phylogenetic signal
[42,43]. Unfortunately for this assumption, LGT means
that there is no a priori guarantee that a common tree is
really present in the molecular data. Worse, it is currently
not possible to provide positive evidence that the roughly
three dozen genes that have been claimed to save the concept of a universally shared core from extinction [44,45]
actually do share a common history [46]. Hence, there is
a high risk that the traditional approach produces circular
phylogenetic analyses, in which assumptions of a common tree are supported by assumptions about how the
data should be represented. As noted by Avise, "any comparative dataset can be used to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree
when a tree provides the suppositional metaphor for the data
analysis. Even inanimate entities (such as different kinds of
chairs or cars) can be grouped into tree-like depictions based on
their similarities or differences" [47]. A typical example of
such an arbitrary tree is Cicarelli et al.'s tree of life [45],
which is based on 34 concatenated orthologs. When tree
assumptions are removed, their data reveals a great deal of
LGT and many genes whose history is simply unknown
[46].
Problem 2: Underestimation of phylogenetic incongruence;
exaggeration of congruence
To avoid the arbitrary issues associated with combining
genes into a single tree, statistical tests attempt to examine

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

whether different gene-tree topologies could be due to
chance [48]. In those tests (e.g., character congruence tests
such as the incongruence length difference test [49] and
variants, or likelihood based tests), the null hypothesis
(H0) is "that the same tree underlies all of the dataset partitions" [48]. The alternative hypothesis, H1, proposes that
some of the genes being compared have undergone a different history. It is then statistically incorrect to say that
when "genes do not significantly reject the consensus tree"
(H0), that "agreement seems to be the rule" [50]. First, in
purely statistical terms, this failure to reject does not mean
that they support the consensus tree, and that they have
evolved according to this very topology [51]. Second,
individual genes with a weak phylogenetic signal will
always fail to reject the consensus tree.
Fortunately, the critical power (and relevance) of such
simple congruence tests can be illustrated by studying an
increasing number of independent test topologies, "supported" or "rejected" by individual genes. To do this, the
Shimodaira-Hasegawa or Approximately Unbiased tests
[52,53], which hold the null hypothesis that all the trees
tested are equally good explanations of the data (and the
H1 hypothesis that some trees are better explanation of
the data), can be used [48]. In particular, testing independent topologies leads to the identification of genes
that simultaneously fail to reject many different trees. If
the failure to reject one tree meant straightforwardly that
this tree should be accepted as representing the true phylogenetic history, then one would have to assume that a
gene simultaneously failing to reject multiple incompatible topologies evolved to produce many incompatible
phylogenetic histories. A more realistic explanation is that
such a gene contains too weak a phylogenetic signal, given
the assumed substitution model, to decide what its history was.
Shi and Falkwoski's work illustrates one approach of how
to critically study genes with a weak phylogenetic signal,
without claiming that data are congruent with one tree
when there is no genuine support for it [54]: First, they
built phylogenetic trees for 682 orthologous protein families from 13 cyanobacterial genomes and did not observe
any predominant, unanimous topology that represents a
large number of orthologs. The maximum number of
orthologs that share a particular topology accounts for
only 1.9-2.1% of the orthologous datasets [54]. Then,
they reconstructed five test topologies: the consensus tree,
the ML and NJ supertrees, and the ML and NJ concatenated trees for these alignments. They observed that
almost all (97.5 to 99.6%) of the molecular datasets supported the five topologies at the 95% confidence level,
suggesting a lack of resolution of single gene phylogenies.
Had they only tested the agreement of the individual gene
phylogenies against one of these five candidate trees of

Page 5 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

cyanobacteria, they could have mistakenly concluded that
they had found The Tree of Cyanobacteria.
Problem 3: Large-scale exclusion of conflicting data
Methods that search for a single universal tree often
involve steps of data exclusion in which lateral gene transfer is conceived as noise. The use of such eliminative criteria allows these phylogeneticists to ignore LGT, but also
leaves them without any trustworthy genes with which to
study prokaryote evolution. Soria-Carrasco and Castresana's "Estimation of phylogenetic inconsistencies in the
three domains of life" [55] is a good example of this logic.
These authors compared the level of incongruence in proteobacterial genes and eukaryotic genes to test whether
the proportion of vertical/lateral signal significantly varied between these taxa. They argued that if these levels
were comparable between eukaryotes and proteobacteria,
LGT could not be considered a major evolutionary process
in these bacteria. Through recurring steps of data exclusion, they removed as much conflicting data as possible to
guarantee that no phylogenetic difference could be found
between the eukaryotic and proteobacterial data.

First, they retained only ubiquitous "core" genes, thus
throwing out of the analysis the majority of the prokaryotic data in order to avoid taxonomical patchiness. The disagreement between these individual "core" gene trees and
the "species tree" (i.e. the concatenated gene tree) was,
however, higher for prokaryotes than for eukaryotes. Consequently, in a second step, the authors excluded all genes
for which there was more than one copy per species. The
aim was to exclude duplicated genes both from the
eukaryotic and prokaryotic datasets, due to a suspicion
that the large amount of incongruence observed in bacteria could be due to excessive duplications and losses. Yet,
such a procedure obviously excluded the paralogs as well
as any multiple copies resulting from lateral gene transfers
in prokaryote genomes. Only 127 genes could be retained
for proteobacteria, as opposed to 346 for eukaryotes.
Nevertheless, prokaryotic gene trees continued to show
more disagreement with the concatenated gene tree than
eukaryotic genes did, and this prompted a third exclusion
step. Biases in gene length were corrected, since proteobacterial sequences were smaller on average than eukaryotic sequences (214 aa versus 251 aa). All genes were
trimmed to an identical length of 182 unambigously
aligned positions. Based on this reduced dataset, the AU
test indicated that 46.5% of the individual proteobacterial
genes were incompatible with the "species tree" as
opposed to only 23.4% of the eukaryotic alignments. The
authors then dismissed these results by arguing that the
gene lengths were now too short to conclude anything
about the impact of LGT. So, in a final step of "good" gene
selection, they removed all markers shorter than 300 aa

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

and retained only 88 eukaryotic genes and 20 proteobacterial ones for their comparative analysis. But even in this
heavily curated dataset, the AU test demonstrated a higher
level of incongruence within the proteobacterial dataset
(25% incongruence) than within the eukaryotic dataset
(14.8% incongruence).
Even though the "purified" data now amounted to a mere
0.8% of the size of a bacterial genome, and are obviously
unrepresentative of the evolution of the rest of the proteobacterial genome, the authors surprisingly concluded that
overall no more LGT could be observed in proteobacteria
than in Eukaryotes. According to them, such a study
"opens the way to obtain the tree of life of bacterial and
archaeal species using genomic data and the concatenation of
adequate genes, in the same way as it is usually done in eukaryotes." [55] From a pluralistic point of view, however, it is
striking that a great majority of the bacterial data have to
be excluded to achieve the reconstruction of a so-called
"universal" tree. In other words, almost none of the data
that Soria-Carrasco and Castresana examined fit the metaphor of a tree, but they nonetheless filtered their observations to sieve out only those that were compatible with
their preconceived notion that the evolutionary process is
tree-like in both groups. The result is that this forced them
to disregard most of the data they initially wished to
explain evolutionarily.
Problem 4: Deprioritizing conflicting data
For those who take a monistic approach, sidelining or
deprioritizing data that conflicts with the model of a single tree may appear to be a less extreme alternative than
large-scale data exclusion. One such example is Daubin
and Galtier's recent proposal to build a tree of life by dismissing the plethora of incongruences in molecular data.
For them, "the existence of incongruences is not sufficient to
dismiss the notion of a species tree, nor to preclude its reconstruction. [...] In our view, the species tree could still be a useful
concept even if incongruent with every gene tree" [50]. They
argued that from a statistical point of view, rejecting the
species tree because of the existence of conflicts between
gene trees means refusing to calculate the mean of a distribution because its variance is non-zero, which appears too
extreme a policy [50]. They claim that the species tree can
be recovered even when the variance in phylogenetic signal is extensive, as long as transfers occur randomly. Furthermore, they assert that one could interpret the mean
and variance in phylogenomics differently: the mean signal corresponding to speciations/extinctions, and the variance to LGT and other non-vertical processes [50].

Daubin and Galtier are suggesting that calculations of the
mean phylogenetic signal of incongruent genes are the
best way to build a tree of life because it integrates (in reality, averages) a large amount of incongruent data. Under

Page 6 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

their assumptions, "a supertree method (which essentially
returns the "average" estimated gene tree) recovers the true species tree with strong accuracy from phylogenomic data simulated under a model incorporating LGT, even when the amount
of LGT is such that two random gene trees share only 50% of
their internal branches, on average" [50]. Although it is curious that anyone would summarize such a reticulated pattern with a tree, a deeper problem with such claims is that
lateral gene transfer does not in fact occur randomly. It is
strongly influenced by the selective processes operating in
organismal environments.
For example, the bacteria Salinibacter ruber displays many
genes linked to adaptation for life in hypersaline environments. These genes have their closest homologs in the
genomes of co-habitating halophilic archaea [56]. A similar example can be found in the archaeal genera Sulfolobus
and Thermoplasma. Despite belonging to different phyla,
17% of their genes are each other's closest homologs [57].
This mutuality can be explained by extensive lateral gene
transfer between these organisms, as they evolve to thrive
in the same types of environments (high temperature and
low pH). Furthermore, vertical and lateral evolutionary
signals are entangled with one another in molecules, such
that it becomes difficult to distinguish them through simple tree-centred approaches. If we really want to understand evolutionary process and pattern, it seems clear that
simply deprioritizing lateral signal will be a mistake.
Problem 5: Ambiguities in tree of life patterns
Several observations question the validity of equating the
consensus or average phylogenetic pattern with a bifurcating evolutionary organismal history, or with the tree-like
evolutionary history of the species [58-61]. At least some
of the consensus signal found in core genomes [60] might
reflect not a shared history but instead, artefactual phylogenetic reconstruction. Many phylogenomic studies have
produced a "reference tree" that is an aggregate constructed from many individual genes. Using 16S rDNA
trees as an explicit or implicit comparative criterion, these
aggregate trees have been claimed [45] or used in practice
[62-64] as a vertical scaffold onto which LGT events can
be mapped. Whether constructed using a supermatrix,
supertree or other approaches, it is often possible (and
always desirable) to attach estimates of statistical significance to features of such aggregate trees. Supermatrixderived phylogenies can be subjected to bootstrap or jackknife analyses in the same manner as single-gene phylogenies, while other approaches such as supertrees can be
resampled using techniques that are appropriate to the
underlying data, e.g., bipartitions in a supertree constructed using the Matrix Representation with Parsimony
[65,66] method, and other support indices [67].

Such measures of statistical support can be extremely misleading, however. It is widely known, for instance, that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

support values such as the bootstrap proportion or posterior probability can strongly support an incorrect split in
a tree due to model violations or multiple phylogenetic
histories within a data set [68]. It is therefore necessary to
test whether strong support for a given split in an aggregate tree is found consistently in all or a majority of the
contributing entities (i.e., single-gene alignments or individual phylogenetic trees). In one such supertree [64], a
sister relationship between Aquifex aeolicus and Thermotoga maritima was reconstructed as the earliest-diverging
group within the bacterial supertree. A total of 120 trees in
the input data set yielded a 'strong conclusion' about this
relationship, either resolving A. aeolicus and T. maritima as
sisters with strong Bayesian posterior support (PP ≥ 0.95),
or displaying an alternative relationship in which the two
were placed with other partners, again with strong support. Only 20 out of the 120 trees supported the pairing of
these two taxa. Furthermore, analysis of alternative relationships showed many distinct partners for A. aeolicus,
including several branches within the Proteobacteria, as
well as both the Euryarchaeotes and the Crenarchaeotes,
and the genus Clostridium (which includes the thermophile Thermoanaerobacter tencongensis). Similarly, T.
maritima showed strong affinities for several Gram-positive lineages (especially T. tengcongensis), Pyrococcus and
Chlorobium tepidum. While more than 30 trees supported a
relationship between Aquifex and basal Proteobacteria,
the A. aeolicus/T. maritima pairing was nonetheless
favoured by the MRP algorithm. It is thus highly debatable as to whether this latter relation should be considered
as the true vertical signal.
Another example can be found in analyses of Thermoplasma, which is a genus of hyperthermophilic euryarchaeotes that often branches near the base of the Archaea in
aggregate trees [69,70]. However, concatenated informational protein phylogeny[71] places Thermoplasma within
the euryarchaeal methanogens. Analysis of the quartet
relationships between Thermoplasma acidophilum, the euryarchaeotes Methanopyrus kandleri and Pyrococcus horikoshii, and the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeote Sulfolobus
tokodaii from the Beiko et al. (2005) [64] dataset yielded
22 quartets that placed T. acidophilum with S. tokodaii, consistent with the reference supertree. 22 other quartets supported a sister relationship between T. acidophilum and M.
kandleri (consistent with the informational protein phylogenies of another study [71]), and another 21 supported
T. acidophilum with P. horikoshii. Quartet analyses with T.
acidophilum and other triplets of genomes yielded relatively weak support for the basal positioning of Thermoplasma in the Archaeal part of the supertree. Instead, two
alternative placements within the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota were supported. Furthermore, it is noteworthy
that most supertree methods can produce novel clades not
supported by any of the source trees [72].

Even though simulated random LGT regimes tended to
diminish statistical support for more-ancient relationships rather than offering strongly supported alternatives
in average trees, phylogenetic approaches have been
shown, in theory and in practice, to favour one topology
even if the input data are generated equally on two or
more trees [73,74]. Compositional or rate effects may be
sufficient to give strong statistical support to a grouping of
branches that should in fact be unresolved [75]. Indeed,
systematic biases in residue composition have been
shown to influence large, concatenated phylogenies such
as those of eight species of yeast [76]. Likewise, most phylogenetic reconstructions methods to-date assume a timereversible model, while compositional bias in fact
changes during evolution. The assumptions of this model
are thus frequently violated, especially if different genera,
families, or even phyla are included in the same reconstruction. Likewise, when data are simulated under biased
regimes of LGT and a genome phylogeny approach, the
recovered tree displays neither the complete vertical history, nor that of any significant pathway of LGT [77].
Furthermore, gene transfer can create patterns indistinguishable from those created by vertical inheritance, as
was first recognized when the extent of gene transfer
among bacteria became visible in comparative genome
analyses [78-80]. It is reasonable to assume that the rate of
successful transfers relates to overall similarity (use of the
same transfer machinery, phages that infect both organism, similar machineries for transcription and translation,
and similar signals functioning in replication and genome
organization [81]). Gene transfer biased towards similar
partners reinforces the similarity that leads to more gene
transfer. The transfers thus create a signal that groups
organisms together, such that we consider them to be
closely related. In some instances these gene transfers
might reinforce a signal due to shared ancestry, but in
other instances all of the signal that we detect today might
have been created by gene transfer itself. The claim that
the consensus tree recovered in some molecular phylogenies is based on shared ancestry hitherto remains an
unproven assumption. What remains are two processes,
vertical inheritance and gene transfer, both of which contribute to recovered trees in ways that can be difficult to
distinguish using only one model.
Consequently, any statistically well-supported tree recovered from a phylogenomic analysis should not be construed uncritically as a 'tree of life' unless hybrid signals
and model violation effects are considered and rejected as
potential confounding factors.
Epistemological issues
Beyond these methodological issues, adherence to the traditional tree of life raises substantial epistemological
issues, about the very nature of the knowledge generated.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

Problem 6: What are trees of life really trees of?
As discussed above, the simplest tree-of-life rescue strategy
currently used is to group some genes, including those
which might have different histories, and calculate the
"average" tree-like history of these genes [50]. The analyst
lumps together a great deal of data that did not evolve by
a common tree-like process, analyzes it with methods that
deliver only trees as their result (as opposed to more-general models such as networks), obtains a tree, and then
asserts that this exercise provides evidence in favour of the
existence of a tree. A second tree-rescue strategy is to select
some smaller set of "core" genes and come up with a tree
based on their divergence. A final tree-rescue strategy is to
view a "variable core" as defining the tree of life. Known
as supertrees, these trees do not represent the histories of
even a small set of genes, but instead reflect the inheritance of different genes at different nodes [82]. What these
strategies have in common is a commitment to uncovering tree-like inheritance patterns in the complexity of
microbial inheritance. The question is whether they really
do result in a hierarchy that corresponds to the tree of species, or whether they are in fact teaching us something else
altogether about prokaryote evolution.

Consider first the averaging strategy. A species is composed of organisms, and those organisms are composed
of parts whose histories differ. Some genes might have
been transmitted "vertically" through much of their histories, while others might have been transferred from
closely or distantly related taxa at various past times. If we
average these histories, what does the resulting tree represent? The simple problem is that the historical branchpoints on such a tree do not necessarily represent past species. We don't have a species history here at all. Even Galtier and Daubin admit that not even a single gene might
have followed the path represented by the average tree.
No real species would necessarily correspond to these
averages. Averaging the tree signal would be akin to asking
about the 'geographic average' destination of an American
business traveller, which would probably be (i) somewhere in Iowa, and (ii) would not convey much meaningful information. Such a central tendency tree should thus
be critically interpreted by biologists, and not conflated
with the universal species tree.
In the second tree-rescue strategy, the search for a core, a
scientist attempts to separate the wheat (vertically transferred genes) from the chaff (genes that underwent LGT).
Such methods do, of course, yield tree-representations.
Proponents thus claim that if there is such a set of core
genes, "a tree of bacterial species remains possible" [58].
Yet, the main difficulty with the claim that the history of
the core genes represents the species history is that all we
can safely conclude from the history of the core genes is
simply knowledge of the history of the core genes. A species--and the organisms that comprise it--have histories
Page 8 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

that are not exhaustively explained by the histories of a
few of their parts. To maintain that the history of the core
genes "represents" the species history requires some argument that the history of these parts is somehow "essential" to a species' genealogy. But post-Darwinian
biologists are generally loath to attribute any special
essentialist status to either genes or species. If they fail to
essentialize (which should be expected), then any such
core-gene tree, which might well be an interesting and at
times scientifically fruitful representation, cannot be considered to represent the species history.

organisms belonging to the same group, and allow generalizations about the natural groups. Third, this tree could
be seen as a time machine. Knowing its topology, and the
properties of the extant organisms, to a certain extent one
could infer the properties of the ancestors (i.e. achieving
retrodiction) by assigning properties that are common
among all descendants to ancestral nodes. For all these
reasons, the universal tree seemed the best possible comparative framework for evolutionary biology, and ribosomal RNA was occasionally referred to as "the ultimate
chronometer" [83].

Finally, in the supertree strategy, the transmission of individual genes is not used to create a tree-scaffold, but
instead different genes in different parts of the tree of life
are combined. More precisely, different markers, presenting very little overlap in their taxonomical samplings, are
used to reconstruct different parts of the tree. It is assumed
they all fit on a common tree, despite the fact that there is
little or none support in such a patchwork of data for
many inner nodes. This strategy can appear to increase the
size of the core, since the genes that persist across a speciation event, or even a series of such events, will not be
whittled away merely because those same genes are transferred in some other part of the tree. But does this strategy
represent a species tree? Again, the problem is one of representation. There is certainly some pattern in nature
which answers to this description. Perhaps a supertree
representation accurately reflects the history of cell division. However, to call this a species tree is to claim that all
important species characteristics are inherited along these
lines - a claim that is exceedingly hard to justify.

Today however, if embracing a monist perspective to
describe microbial evolution, the question is not to ask
whether the tree model still represents the best framework
to infer and depict evolutionary relationships, but rather
to ask which of the competing approaches already available is best suited to produce the most satisfactory tree. A
wide array of methods have been developed not only to
address LGT, but also to deal with gene conversion,
recombination or hybridization (for reviews, see [84-88]).
All of these so-called reticulation events are the product of
various biological processes that violate the universal tree
model. Consequently, they directly challenge its utility for
classification, generalization, and for retrodiction, since
any attempt to treat evolution as a tree-like process is
insufficient even if partially useful [30].

Because none of the options described above accurately
reflects species trees, we should instead strive to describe
prokaryote evolution as it is in nature. That may require a
departure from analytical methods that only operate in
the language and mathematics of trees. Networks, for
example, offer an alternative mathematical framework,
albeit one that is not necessarily compatible with a treemonistic concept of inheritance or speciation.
Problem 7: Tree monism no longer provides the ideal comparative
evolutionary framework
In the time before genome sequences, when there was
bona fide reason to "hope" that prokaryote genomes
would uncover vast evidence for common ancestry, the
goal of obtaining a universal tree of life promised to serve
three highly desirable purposes. First, it would provide a
natural classification of living organisms, by identifying
all the extant descendants of a given ancestor forming a
natural group. Knowing the tree of life would thus conveniently define a hierarchical classification of Life, the
"groups within groups" proposed by Darwin. Second, this
tree could provide insights into the shared properties of

Consider the analogy of the origins of organelles via endosymbiosis in eukaryote evolution. It vividly demonstrates
that the notion of a generalized tree of life is not the most
productive position to hold. It highlights an important
manifestation of the discrepancy that arises between hierarchical classification using the structure of a tree on the
one hand and evolutionary process on the other hand,
when the evolutionary process is not tree-like to begin
with. Plastids arose from cyanobacteria, and mitochondria (including their anaerobic and non-ATP-producing
forms, hydrogenosomes and mitosomes) from proteobacteria. Both organelle types (usually) still possess their own
genome, and both symbioses entailed gene transfers from
those endosymbionts to the nucleus during the evolutionary transition in which those endosymbionts became
organelles [36,89]. Moreover, some current views have it
that the origin of mitochondria was contemporaneous
with the origin of eukaryotes themselves [90-92], that the
host for the origin of mitochondria stems from within the
archaebacteria [93], and that the origin of photosynthetic
eukaryotes was contemporaneous with the origin of plastids [35,94]. Although there are still some controversies
around this scenario, the main point is that the endosymbiotic origin of plastids and mitochondria does not conform to the tree paradigm. Both eukaryotes in general and
plants in particular represent genetic mergers in evolution,
cellular marriages consummated by the genetic integra-

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

tion afforded by endosymbiotic gene transfer and protein
import by organelles.
Thus, any tree of life that makes the effort to link prokaryotes and eukaryotes in a manner that reflects the underlying evolutionary process would need to include
archaebacterial-eubacterial lineage mergers at the origin
of mitochondria/eukaryotes and eukaryote-cyanobacterial mergers at the origin of plants. Similar mergers occur
in the origin of algae that possess secondary plastids [95].
But if we force the metaphor of a bifurcating (or multifurcating) tree onto the evolutionary process linking prokaryotes and eukaryotes, then we have to decide whether to
put the eukaryotes on the host lineage or on the mitochondrial lineage, and we have to decide whether to put
the plants on the cyanobacterial lineage or on the eukaryote lineage, when in fact the endosymbiotic origin of
these organelles ends up putting the resulting organisms
on both branches at once.
The discrepancy is even greater between a hierarchical
classification of prokaryotes and lateral evolutionary
processes. When Cicarelli et al.[45] attempted to identify
(by hand, ultimately, even though the paper advertised an
automated method in the title) all the genes that had not
been lost or transferred among genomes representative of
all life, they ended up with 31 genes, corresponding to
about 1% of the genes in a typical prokaryote genome.
The authors assumed that those genes tended to produce
congruent trees, rather than demonstrating that they actually do. In other words, at face value they found that about
1% of any genome at best might tend to fit the working
hypothesis of a tree. Any reasonable account of scientific
method would suggest that when a working hypothesis
can only account for about 1% of the data, a true scientist
would start looking for a better working hypothesis. The
current retention by many evolutionary biologists of a
strict tree metaphor for prokaryotes, despite its inability to
account for the observations, presents a serious barrier to
our understanding of prokaryotic evolution and is hard to
square with most accounts of how science should be
done.
On the other hand, despite their differences, all the evolutionary processes listed above can be modelled and represented simultaneously by phylogenetic networks better
than by trees, if a unique representation is desired. It thus
seems both prudent and pragmatic to explore alternative
mathematical representations of microbial evolution.
Adoption of network strategies does not constitute rejection of significant bifurcating patterns in the history of
life. Instead, it requires the denial that tree-patterns are the
only possible patterns. Leaving aside the specific methods
to detect LGT [69,96], recombination [97], gene conversion [98], hybridization [99] and other reticulation events
[100], different algorithms have now been proposed to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

build phylogenetic networks or to represent the non-tree
component, such as weak hierarchies, split decomposition, netting, statistical parsimony, minimum spanning
networks, reticulograms, median networks, median-joining networks, union of parsimony trees, and neighbor-net
[101-109]. Consensus methods for assembling incompatible trees into networks and supernetworks are also available [110].
In light of all these approaches, algorithms and software
already published (and still being developed), the search
for optimal trees could be advantageously replaced by the
search for optimal networks. Because trees are special
types of networks, the tree model is most properly understood as embedded in the network-model of evolution
[111]. The paradigmatic shift from a monistic to a pluralistic understanding of the evolutionary processes is thus
echoed by a graph-theoretical shift, from trees (i.e, connected acyclic graphs) to networks (i.e., connected graphs
which may contain reticulations). Indeed a good network
approach will always return a tree if the underlying data
have a tree-like structure (for distance data, the four-point
condition has to be satisfied). However, if significant conflicting signals are present in a data set, then suitable network methods should be able to depict reticulation events
that a strictly tree-based approach cannot. Although network methods have limitations [112], they should nonetheless permit progress towards more accurate
representations of the process of microbial evolution as it
occurs in nature, as opposed to depicting how some of us
think it might occur by extrapolation from observations
and experience in the study of vertebrates.
With so many methods available, the real problem is to
assess the relative performance of the competing
approaches with simulated data [77,86,113-115] as well
as in real-case applications [116]. The problem of identifying the minimum number of reticulations in a graph is
NP-hard [117], such that most recent developments in
this field have been to develop good algorithms to
approximate the optimal solution [118,119]. If it is
accepted that networks are the best model to study LGT
and microbial evolution, the next problems arise of how
to assess the likelihood [120] and robustness of such networks [121], and to compare networks or determine when
a network is significantly more informative than a tree
[122]. Although methodological and algorithmic limitations may have precluded the use of phylogenetic networks in the past, a few steps have been taken in this
direction [123]. It is time to show much more of the evolutionary process.
Process pluralism and its implications for taxonomy
Many of the above limitations associated with a tree-monistic approach in reconstructing the tree of life could easily
be dealt with by assuming a more pluralistic approach to
Page 10 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

describe microbial evolution. We already know that
microbial evolution and the tree of life are distinct in
process and pattern, and we simply have to admit it more
openly and take measures in our research to accommodate that state of affairs. Not only do we recognize the
multi-level nature of selection in biology, and that an
exclusive focus on any higher level of organisation (e.g.
cell or organism) will inevitably conceal divergent underlying processes at the genetic level, but we also have begun
to acknowledge the diversity of evolutionary processes in
action (between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and within
prokaryotes). For prokaryotes, there is an increasing agreement that whenever LGT is frequent enough, trees of
genes, genomes, cells, organisms, and perhaps of higher
level entities as well, will inevitably diverge. Consequently, as further evidence accumulates, evolutionary
biologists will, of necessity, increasingly divorce themselves from traditional tree-monism, even though the
monistic principle of descent with modification persists.
In practice, we are already studying a diversity of evolutionary processes and considering these as natural, regardless of whether or not our classificatory system consists of
only one kind of evolutionary unit (clades). Typically,
phylogeneticists are now dealing with a plurality of units
in microbial evolution. We need to realize that many of
our present "phylogenies of life" correspond to diverse
mappings that sometimes represent the history of genes,
groups of genes, or perhaps even other categories of entity
(for example, processes such as change in genomic G+C
content). These different histories do not have to map
exclusively or entirely on to one another, but can be
acknowledged as evidence of the complexity and richness
of microbial evolutionary processes. In that sense, many
current tree-rescue efforts are fully consistent with a pluralistic diagnosis. What is not consistent though is the
claim that such a tree pattern, when it is found, is a species
tree [124], and that it corresponds to the whole of microbial evolution.
All the above has important implications for the "species"
notion as well. Rather than working under a single unified
concept, microbiologists already accept many different
pragmatic definitions of prokaryotic species. They have no
species concept that would be relevant for all of life
(eukaryotes, let alone prokaryotes) that would justify the
reconstruction of a universal species tree. Doolittle and
Zhaxybayeva (2009) showed that due to various genetic,
population ecological, and evolutionary processes, not all
prokaryotes belong to genomically and phenotypically
cohesive clusters that biologists could be defined as "species" [125]. In some instances, life-defining processes
work together and generate groups of related organisms,
sufficiently like one another to be called species. However,
the evolution of such coherent clusters is not the general
outcome in the prokaryotic world. Rather, various

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

prokaryotic species taxa are defined in nature (and
throughout the literature) based on many different criteria, such as global genetic distance (Average Nucleotide
Identity, DNA-DNA hybridization experiments) and the
presence of some cohesion mechanism (e.g., recombination rates assessed by Multi Locus Sequence approaches,
the exploitation of some ecological niche characterized by
ecotypes, some phylogenetic inertia). Based on such criteria it is the case that there are multiple correct ways to classify the organic world, and a single organism may be
classified in more than one manner depending on the
aims of classification.
For instance, two species concepts proposed for prokaryotes are a recombination concept fashioned after the Biological Species Concept [126,127] and the ecotype
concept suggested by Cohan [128]. A recent study of the
genus Thermotoga shows that the same group of organisms
forms a single species according to the recombination
approach but consists of multiple species according to the
ecological approach [129]. Thus each organism in this
group belongs to two different types of species (a recombination species and an ecotype species) and those species
are not coextensive (having the same spatial and temporal
location). In this example, nature imposes a plurality of
species concept upon us. The occurrence of lateral gene
transfer is also a source of taxonomic pluralism. The
recombination concept provides an example. For some
microbes, different parts of a single prokaryote genome
recombine with different genomes. That is, there is no
whole genome recombination in these organisms. The
consequence is that by the standards of the recombination
concept, the same genome belongs to different species
[129]. Similar considerations apply to a phylogenetic
approach to classifying microbes. Because of lateral gene
transfer (and, as we have noted, due to endosymbiosis in
eukaryotes), different parts of an organism's genome
often have different evolutionary histories [40,130]. Phylogenetically based classifications for the same group of
genomes vary, depending on which clusters of genes in
those genomes are chosen. For instance, ribosomal components group the Thermotogales within the bacterial
domain as a "basal" branching lineage. If only an
unrooted bacterial phylogeny is considered, as seems reasonable because possible outgroups are on very long
branches, the Thermotogales appear as a sister group to
the Aquificales. In whole-genome phylogenies, the Thermotogales are frequently found to group with Clostridia
and Bacilli [131]. Nelson et al. [132] detected many
archaeal genes in the genome of Thermotoga maritima, a
finding supported by the recent analysis of several
genomes from members of the Thermotogales [133]. This
analysis of five Thermotogales genomes finds that the
ribosomal components group Thermotogales with Aquificae. About 8% of the genes group with homologs from

Page 11 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

Archaea, but the vast majority of genes group with
Clostridia homologs. Hence a prokaryote or a part of a
prokaryote can belong to more than one classificatory
unit and those units do not form a nested hierarchy of
inclusive units.
An implication of this discussion is that prokaryotes probably belong to overlapping rather than inclusive hierarchies. In theory, this plurality of definitions of microbial
taxa could open the way to multiple classification
schemes (i.e., taxonomic pluralism) instead of a single
universal hierarchy, often seen as the holy grail of traditional phylogenetics. What are evolutionary microbiologists to make of such pluralism? Should they reject it out
of hand given the Linnaean ideal that an organism
belongs to only one species and has only one placement
in an inclusive hierarchy? Interestingly, the debate over
whether to adopt pluralism has already been played out in
the general debate of how to define 'species' given the
plethora of eukaryote species concepts [134,135]. It
shows that adopting a pluralistic approach to microbial
taxonomy is not as radical as one might think.
One concern critics of pluralism have is that pluralism
lacks a means for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate classifications [136,137]. They worry that pluralism
is too liberal an approach to science because it accepts any
suggested classification. That is not the approach being
advocated here. Taxonomists stipulate that to be allowed
as legitimate, a classification must meet standard scientific
criteria [134,138]. And at least one philosopher of taxonomy stipulates that microbial species must be the result of
a common type of causal process or be causally efficacious
in a similar way [134,138]. For example, if we classify
microbes by ecotypes, we need to empirically test whether
evolutionary processes cause groups of stable and genetically coherent ecotypes. The same goes for a recombination approach to microbial taxa. If both approaches are
empirically confirmed and they cross-cut the world of
microbes, then we should allow a plurality of classifications. If one approach is empirically successful and the
other fails, then only one of those approaches to microbial classification should be accepted. Taxonomic pluralism is not an a priori conjecture but a hypothesis
vulnerable to empirical tests.
Another concern with pluralism is whether it leads to
inconsistent classifications. As Hennig (1966, 165) writes,
"if systematics is to be a science it must bow to the self-evident requirement that objects to which the same label is
given must be comparable in some way." [139] If some
microbes are grouped according to a recombination species concept and others according to an ecological species
concept, then those species are not comparable units. The
answer to this concern should not be surprising. Classifi-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

cations need to be internally consistent, but classifications
of different types of entities need not be consistent with
one another. Recombination species and ecotype species
are different types of entities, bounded by different causal
processes, so we should not expect them to be comparable. However, within a particular taxonomic study, if we
say there are four species within a genus and three species
in another genus, then we had better be comparing like to
like. An analogy may help clarify this point. Genera in different phyla (for example, bacterial genera and mammalian genera) are considered very different types of entities.
But within a particular classification, genera should be
constructed according to the same parameters and thus be
comparable.
This still leaves Hennig's concern that a single label is
applied to different types of entities. The worry is that the
ambiguity of 'species' implied by pluralism leads to
semantic confusion [137]. If classifications are constructed according to different parameters and that information is not evident, then we will not know what sorts
of entities and relations are represented by a classification.
There are two ways to address this concern. One is to get
rid of ambiguous terms and replace them with more accurate terms for the different types of units classified. Following the debate over eukaryote species concepts, we
might call recombination species 'biospecies,' ecotype
species 'ecospecies' and phylogenetic species 'phylospecies.' But the replacement of 'species' with new terms will
only go so far once the differences between prokaryote
and eukaryote evolution are considered. There are different kinds of ecospecies and biospecies (for example,
eukaryotic biospecies whose genomes are involved in
whole genome recombination versus prokaryotic biospecies whose genomes recombine in a piecemeal fashion). A
more practical approach to avoiding semantic confusion
is not to reform our language but to be clear about what
type of units are being categorized in a particular classification. For a classification of species, we should say which
species approach is being used and how it is being applied
(for example, whole genome recombination, or partial
genome recombination and which part of the genome).
Doing so will avoid semantic confusion and ensure that
comparable units are classified within a particular classification.
Stepping back from these details we see that whether or
not one should adopt taxonomic pluralism at the species
level is largely an empirical question. If nature is cross-cut
by significant evolutionary processes, then we should recognize the different types of resultant evolutionary units,
whether they are called 'species' or something else. So if
we want to accurately describe the species of the microbial
world and learn about the processes of microbial evolu-

on this paper.

Conclusion

iv) Radical multiplicity. Some phylogeneticists may
prefer not to replace the tree of life by any other
unique or dominant "big picture". Such pattern pluralists favour the reconstruction of as many trees and
networks as needed to describe the evolution and the
structuration of the whole genetic biodiversity. This
solution, which leads to a phylogenetic 'forest', seems
appropriate to investigate the different evolutionary
mechanisms affecting different taxa, at different scales,
or for different purposes.

There is a longstanding and increasing realization among
microbiologists that the mechanisms of gene spread
among prokaryotes across evolutionary time are multiple
and are different from those of eukaryotes. As a consequence, the gene histories for a large majority of their
genes are discordant, which means that the traditional
tree of life model is very much a problematic framework
to study microbial evolution. Many of the primary tenets
and major assumptions of this theoretical framework
have been refuted or have undergone drastic modification
since its first formulations in Darwin's notebooks. Yet
today belief in a single universal tree of life remains
largely unaffected, and the strong evidence-driven alternative is often still seen as competition rather than the successor. This persistence of the tree of life model could
partly be explained by the fact that it is difficult to fully
dislodge an old problematic model without replacing it
with a better guiding metaphor. Our discussion above has
proposed or implied several potential successors of the
tree of life model.
i) A "Central Trend of Life", in which gene transfer also
creates the signal. However, any such central trend has
to be acknowledged as representing a phenetic and not
a cladistic analysis. Although the creation of similarity
by gene transfer is a natural process, the reason for
phenetic similarity is that successful gene transfer
between unrelated organisms is rare [130], and is not
due to shared ancestry. This would be unsatisfactory
for many evolutionary biologists, eager to learn about
the extent of the diversity of processes in microbial
evolution.
ii) A "banyan tree" of highly conserved genes, which
defines a central trend that is further complicated by
extensive LGT. This model appeals to those for whom
the large-scale tree-like structure of such a net of life
still reflects evolutionary history. From this point of
view, phylogenetic reconstruction, especially of reticulation events that connect divergent organisms, is
often considered appealing.
iii) A more complex network-like graph in which
phases of tree-like evolution (with some horizontal
connections) are interspersed with significant phases
of rampant horizontal exchange of genetic information. Such processes and their outcomes cannot in
principle be represented as trees [140]. Such networks
would have the presumed advantage of more fully
uncovering the dynamics of prokaryotic chromosome
evolution and of providing new insights into the contribution of LGT to microbial evolution. This is prob-

It is clear from some of the analyses discussed above that
at least the first two of these four approaches already
appeal to the broader community dealing with microbial
evolution, even though they continue to use the traditional tree metaphor. Such metaphorical allegiance is
likely to continue for quite some time. But given what we
now know about prokaryote genome evolution and the
contribution of endosymbiosis to eukaryote evolution, it
seems rather unlikely that biologists in 20 years will still
be using the language of strictly bifurcating trees to
describe the relatedness of prokaryotes, and to develop
models of microbial evolution.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1: Ford Doolittle (Dalhousie University)
I have failed in my attempt to identify anything in this
paper with which I radically disagree. It presents a temperate account of the current state of the Tree of Life (TOL),
for prokaryotes. Indeed, I can only work up some degree
of critical fervor by imagining myself in the other camp,
for whom a universal tree still deserves a privileged status
among possible representations of Life's history. In that
assumed role, I'd argue like this.

While endorsing pluralism, authors spend most of their
effort in deconstructing tree-monism, rather than allowing it a legitimate if not preeminent explanatory role. In
fact a true pluralism must admit that one particular treelike pattern, which many call the Tree of Cells (TOC, or
Page 13 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

TOCD&S - Tree of Cell Divisions and Speciations)
remains coherent as a concept. This TOCD&S would be the
tree-like tracing of all cell division events (mostly bifurcations through binary fission but also more complex multifurcative processes by which one cell reproduces its
physical self) that have surviving descendants. It would
also include speciation events in sexual organisms, which
do not reproduce their physical selves but only reproduce
their "own kinds". Cells do divide, populations do split,
and lineages of populations that some might want to call
species do diverge. That polymorphisms persist in recently
divided populations (lineage sorting) and that (for bacteria and archaea) recombination falls off at different rates
for different genes (and may never reach zero) does mean
that branch points in such a TOC are not sharp (Retchless
and Lawrence [2007], Science 317: 1093). And of course
half of the genes in many bacterial genomes comprise limited distribution "auxiliary" genes that come and go faster
than "species" can arise and go extinct. Nevertheless, it
still seems sensible to say that E. coli K12 and O157:H7 are
more closely related to each other than either is to Yersinia
pestis, and that a rooted tree showing this represents some
sort of useful historical truth about diverging populations,
just as a tree-like pattern that has humans and chimps as
a clade to the exclusion of lemurs depicts an important
evolutionary reality.

same book on different shelves in my library, or pictures
of the same bird on different pages of my bird guide. It's
hard for me to see a network as a useful catalog, and so I
have no objection to the continued use of an rRNA tree
(or of any other agreed upon averaging or gene core-based
TOCD&S) as a conventional framework for classification,
provided everyone knows that that is all that it might be,
a conventional taxonomic framework, not the TOL with
all its baggage. Other ways of classifying microbes (for
instance by gene content or ecological role or indeed by
relative position in a multidimensional network) might
well have more predictive value, but still this relatively stable hierarchical scheme would serve a very useful organizing function. In fact, I think this is the posture that many
microbiologists have already accepted.

The problems with the TOCD&S are of course that the
deeper into the prokaryotic base of it one goes the less it
can tell us about the gene content of ancestral genomes
(and thus the phenotypes of ancestral cells), the less certainly it can be inferred by any averaging or core-gene
approach, and the less accurately it represents any kind of
genomic history. It may be ultimately unknowable. Still,
the inferred TOCD&S is one of many ways to represent
data and might be the favored default to serve as reference
against which LGTs are displayed. And trying to figure out
how to construct it keeps many people employed, generating imaginative new algorithms.

I might also accuse the authors of their own unrealistic
"ism", prokaryote-eukaryote dichotomization. Like them,
I endorse the prokaryote/eukaryote dichotomy as a useful
if non-phylogenetic view of the living world, as far as cell
structure and the physical processes underlying gene
exchange go. But still, there is considerable overlap in
what the authors call "mechanisms of natural variation".
Although sexual eukaryotes have to recombine to reproduce as organisms, not all eukaryotes are sexual. Some
highly recombinogenic bacteria can be treated as effectively sexual in population genetic models, even if they
reproduce clonally as organisms. Authors also make too
much of eukaryotic recombination being reciprocal: only
one product of recombination at meiosis is likely ever to
make it into a reproductively successful gamete. And
although individual bacteria indeed "non-reciprocally"
integrate only a fraction of genomes' information in any
single event of legitimate or illegitimate recombination,
in the end their population genetics could mimic the
eukaryotic situation. It seems to me that we need to exercise explanatory pluralism both within as well as between
domains, and that to not do so is a kind of monistic dualism.

There are two kinds of pluralism to be considered, I think,
and the TOCD&S has a role in both. The first kind admits
that different models will have different and possibly
exclusive applicability in different parts of the biological
world (especially, prokaryotes versus eukaryotes). The
TOCD&S would be the TOL for vertebrates (fuzziness at
the nodes due to lineage sorting and hybridization aside),
but network models would be preferred in representing
prokaryotic evolution. The second kind of pluralism
allows that we might apply different unitary models to all
of biology, recognizing that none is perfect or uniformly
relevant across biology, but that each might have its own
special value. I still have a hard time ridding myself of the
notion that, among this second kind, inclusively hierarchical classifications remain especially user-friendly ways
of organizing diversity. I don't expect to find copies of the

I also have a concern over how the authors deal with the
perennial skeptic's question, "just how much LGT is there,
really". On p. 8, authors say that "it is currently not possible to prove that LGT has not affected all genes in prokaryotes over the full span of evolutionary history that the tree
of life purports to depict". Even working my way through
the double negative I have some trouble with the concept
of "affecting all genes". To me this means that no individual gene in any contemporary genome can be said to have
gotten where it is through an unbroken series of genome
replications (vertical descent) since the time of whatever is
taken as the ancient last universal common ancestor. But
to others it might mean that no contemporary gene family
has fewer than one lateral event in its entire phylogenetic
tree, even though the majority of lineages one might trace
from that ancient time to now are purely vertical. There is

a big difference, and yet one sees such ambivalent statements all the time. The authors should commit themselves.
Answer to Ford Doolittle
We thank Ford Doolittle for his very insightful comments. It is
certainly helpful to acknowledge that an rRNA tree (or any supposedly representative tree) is a only conventional framework
for classification. Although there is no doubt that a tree-like
pattern such as the TOCD&S would also be useful, it is questionable whether such a concept is indeed 'coherent', if we have
multiple concepts of species, and if cell divisions have to be
aggregated into particular groups of cell divisions to make phylogenetic sense rather than anarchy.

Certainly there is a lot to be learned about the biology of protists
and their evolution. We do not want to ignore them, but we do
think that the dualism identified by Doolittle in this paper is
currently justified. This heuristic categorization allows us to
clarify the deepest issues in the tree of life, since prokaryotes
have a significantly non tree-like evolution and, except for
endosymbiotic transfers, protists can be conceived to have only
a somewhat less tree-like evolution than multicellular eukaryotes. Although we agree with Doolittle that there is certainly
some overlap in the mechanisms of genetic variation between
eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the biological differences still
appear to be of central evolutionary importance to us. Decades
of studies have tought us that meiotic recombination is the biologically most important source of genetic variation in eukaryotes. Protists from the same species therefore share the same
collection of genes, while prokaryotes may often not. We recognize, however, that not all prokaryotic lineages are similarly
affected by lateral gene transfer and recombination, and thus
that we should not be rigid in our conceptualization of this
duality.
Last but not least, we suppressed the double negatives that we
incompletely failed not to remove prior to not directly saying
what we meant.
Reviewer 2: Nicolas Galtier (CNRS, France)
One year ago, Vincent Daubin and I took advantage of an
invited article to express our view about the consequences
of lateral gene transfers (LGT) and other conflict-generating processes in modern phylogenomics, debating Bapteste's and Martin's (among others) rejection of the tree of
life as a useful concept. Then we asked Eric Bapteste for his
comments, and he said he would write a full article with
appropriate co-authors, which I am now reviewing. So
this is my review of a response to our comments on previous articles by these authors, who have the right to reply.
Hope we're not boring everybody.

The manuscript is finally not a point-by-point response to
the Galtier & Daubin paper, but rather a more general discussion of microbial evolution and systematics. The

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

authors mainly criticize the meaning and usage of a tree of
life, as they have done several times in the past, and advocate for 'pluralism", i.e., usage of the appropriate representation/model of the evolutionary pattern/process in
specific taxonomic groups, especially prokaryotes (in
which LGT is common) vs. eukaryotes (in which it is not).
My feeling about this paper is terribly ambiguous, balancing between almost complete agreement (with the content), and quasi-total rejection (with the form). I shall first
comment on what I did not like.
Answer to Nicolas Galtier
We thank Nicolas Galtier very much for his thoughtful comments on our essay. To be clear, what Martin and others reject
is the notion that the rRNA tree and 1% representations are
graphs from which we can infer the total history of life. For us,
the history of prokaryotes is not tree-like in nature, and increasing bootstrap support for branches in trees does not change that
circumstance.
Unnecessary contrasts
The discovery of LGT has deeply modified our apprehension of microbial evolution. We now know that a single
tree can not be in microbes the unambiguous, meaningful
representation of evolutionary history it is in large organisms. LGT weakens the tree of life. Now the question is (I
think): does it definitively dismiss it? Should we completely forget about species trees in microbes, or is there
still room for this concept, albeit with a modified interpretation? The manuscript implicitly qualifies those who ask
this question as "monistic", old-fashionned, dogmatic scientists, whereas those displaying "species tree = devil" on
their tee-shirts would be the open-minded, progressist,
modern "pluralists". This I think is a caricatural description of the debate and the community. We are collectively
facing a practical challenge: how to describe/represent/
study microbial evolution and systematics knowing there
are frequent LGTs. No need to create spurious "schools of
thought", as if a deep philosophical gap was separating
two categories of researchers. Please note that creationists
are exactly playing this game, calling us the dogmatic, and
themselves the pluralists.
Answer to Nicolas Galtier
Our goal was certainly not to polarize the debate with seemingly
'pejorative' terms. We had hoped to provide a useful and
thought-provoking description of pluralism and monism, rather
than carry out a name-calling exercise. We do not imply that
there is a dogmatic divide that cannot be crossed, and we see
some very interesting instances in Galtier's response that align
nicely with our ideas.
Quantitative vs qualitative
One novelty brought by this manuscript is the notion that
because prokaryotes and eukaryotes have distinct cellular
Page 15 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

machineries with respect to genetic exchanges between
cells, their evolutionary histories deserve distinct representations. This probably makes sense. I note, however,
that we knew about transformation, conjugation, plasmids and transduction long before the discovery of frequent LGT. At that time, people did not conclude that the
evolutionary theory and practice needed to be revolutionized. Only when we discovered discordant gene trees did
we start to worry. And if indeed the forthcoming genomes
of protist, or fungi, or whatever, reveal strong phylogenetic conflict between genes, we will have to deal with
that, whatever the underlying mechanisms. So the "big
divide" is perhaps not so relevant, and the problem not so
different in distinct groups. The issue is, I think, mostly
empirical (what do we do in case of phylogenetic conflict
between genes?) and quantitative (up to which level of
conflict should we keep drawing "species" trees?).
Answer to Nicolas Galtier
Galtier suggests that almost nobody in the Modern Synthesis
worried about prokaryote oddities, but that would seem to have
occurred because of the historically deep divide between evolutionary biology and microbiology at that time. Thus, the emphasis should be on discerning who the "we" is that Galtier
mentions. LGT was no surprise or problem for microbiologists:,
they were familiar with it long before genomics arrived on the
biological scene. The discordant genes trees caused phylogeneticists, not microbiologists, to worry.

We all agree that such further discordances (if occurring in protists, or fungi) would have to be accommodated, but as noted in
the text already, the amount and frequency of such transfer is
not yet enough to severely damage the tree structure.
Logical issues
Drawing a prokaryotic tree does not mean rejecting the
existence of LGTs, or neglecting their importance, as
repeatedly suggested in the text. It means trying to represent the vertical component of the underlying evolutionary process, i.e. inheritance from parent to offspring. This
is nonsense only if the vertical component has been
entirely erased by massive horizontal tranfers (which
might be true in some cases), something the ms fails to
demonstrate. The manuscript mokes those who still wish
to recover a species tree when genes disagree, for a reason
I do not really understand. The metaphor of the American
business traveller is a good illustration (p17):

"Averaging the tree signal would be akin to asking about
the 'geographic average' destination of an American business traveller, which would probably be (i) somewhere in
Iowa, and (ii) would not convey much meaningful information."
First, this comparison is somewhat misleading in suggesting that gene trees are uniformly distributed in the tree

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

space (like the uniformly distributed traveller's location in
the USA), which is not true: two gene trees of a prokaryotic data set resemble each other much more closely than
two random trees. And genome ("average") trees resemble
rRNA trees. More importantly, such trees do not say everything, but they do not say nothing, just like the Iowa location says the traveller works in the USA, which can be
good to know in a world-wide context. Of course, the geographic average does not say that the traveller is always
located in Iowa, nor does the species tree say that every
single nucleotide has evolved according to this topology,
as everybody is aware of. The question is "how much does
it say?". The tone of the manuscript sometimes suggests
the authors think such trees are of no value at all. Conceptually, do they think that vertical inheritance is not a relevant evolutionary process, partly accounting for current
microbial diversity, that deserves to be studied and represented? Practically, do they suggest that microbiology
would be in better shape if we had, following their recommendation, refused to make use of rRNA trees, mistakenly
taken as species trees, during the last 30 years?
Answer to Nicolas Galtier
We repeatedly argued above, and say again now, that a tree
capturing the vertical component of evolution is of value, but
that it is of limited value because a tree simply cannot show the
entirety of prokaryote evolution. That is why reconstructing
such a tree must only be attempted critically.

The example of the business traveler highlights one of the serious problems of the averaging approach. Given an average location, we cannot distinguish several very different alternatives:
that business travelers fly back and forth continually between
L.A. and New York, that they visit every state with a particular
frequency distribution, or that they spend their entire life in
Iowa. The fact that two mutually exclusive alternatives - the
traveler has never left Iowa, and the traveler has never been to
Iowa - cannot be distinguished, weakens the utility of the averaging approach. Similarly, two divergent phylogenetic 'pulls'
can yield an average tree that reflects neither input signal and
may thereby present a very misleading view of evolution.
Furthermore, it is somewhat of an oversimplification to say that
genome trees resemble rDNA trees. The extent to which they
resemble each other depends strongly on the inclusion or exclusion of closely related lineages. As you travel further back in evolutionary time, all sorts of uncertainties and discrepancies arise:
are beta-proteobacteria monophyletic? What about the insect
endosymbionts? How about groups like the Spirochaetes, or
Planctobacteria + Chlamydiales, or the Gram-positives in toto?
Is Aquifex an early branch, paired or not paired with Thermotoga, or with the epsilons? All of these variations have been seen
in genome trees, and to some extent in 16S trees, depending on
rate corrections and compositional recoding.

Biology Direct 2009, 4:34

Part of the discrepancy perhaps results from the fact that
the ms is discussing the "existence" of the tree of life - if it
does not "exist" (sensu Woese), then we should forget
about it. In my view, a tree is just a human-made conceptual tool that we might decide to adopt if it means something to us, like any other graphical representation,
irrespective of its "existence" in the real world. That said, I
share the authors' concern that the prokaryote tree should
not be interpreted the same way as, say, the primate tree,
and that it is not a sufficient representation of prokaryote
diversity and evolution.
Answer to Nicolas Galtier
We agree. The problem, as we pointed out several times, is
when such a tree is used exclusively, and when it is claimed to
represent the real and total evolutionary situation.
Conceptual debate, empirical agreement
I found the concluding section of the manuscript remarkably balanced and to-the-point (excluding the very last
paragraph). Knowing there are LGTs, what do we do? The
authors give 4 options. I think I currently support option
2, which says that we should try to recover the tree representing vertical inheritance, and use it to annotate genespecific horizontal transfers. The text says a majority of
authors support option 3, in which the microbial diversity
is represented by a network. I note that these two options
are essentially identical, since one natural way to annotate
LGT in a species tree is by adding reticulations - perhaps
using a distinct colour. So despite the conceptual disagreements I'm expressing above, I end up with similar conclusions/recommendations about what should be done in
practice - the really important matter. My only request
would be the right for painting in red in the net of life the
bifurcating subgraph which traces back vertical inheritance, if identifiable. I hope this is not blasphemy.
Answer to Nicolas Galtier
This most ambitious research program, if conducted critically,
is indeed a highly promising line of inquiry to follow.
Reviewer 3: John M. Logsdon, Jr. (Dpt. of Biology,
University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA)
The prokaryotic tree of life is dead!

The message rings clear in this extraordinary paper from
an ensemble group of biologists and philosophers of science. In some ways, I am convinced--and others should
be, too. That, I suspect, is the main objective of this paper:
to provide the reader with an overwhelming "disproof" of
the standard view that prokaryotic evolutionary history
occurred as lineage-splitting events and can be depicted by
a single bifurcating tree. By interweaving philosophical,
technical and empirical arguments, a solid case can be
made for inapplicability of traditional tree-thinking and

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/34

tree-making to prokaryotes. But I also suspect that the
larger (and more laudable) goal is to simply challenge the
readers' deep-seated sensibilities that such trees must necessarily be at the heart of how we view evolutionary relationships of all organisms.
Prokaryotes are different from eukaryotes. Prokaryotes
have the luxury of swapping genes (by lateral gene transfer, LGT) between both close and distant relatives, either
one gene at time or in large gene sets. This is the crux of
prokaryotic sex: the ad hoc exchange of genes via LGT.
Compare this to eukaryotic sex: the equal exchange of
whole genomes via meiosis. But eukaryotes only exchange
genomes between close relatives (generally recognized as
"species") and prokaryotes don't need to follow such a
rule. The lack of a clear species concept for prokaryotes is
a direct consequence of this basic distinction from eukaryotes and is directly implicated in the difficulty (if not inability) to use trees to describe prokaryotic evolution.
Phylogenetic inference has been based on a eukaryo-centric view of evolutionary units (species) that prokaryotes
clearly don't follow. In this sense, the authors rightfully
argue against a monistic view for understanding evolutionary processes and their resulting histories and favor a
pluralistic view that would not be constrained by species
and tree thinking, narrowly defined by eukaryotes. It's
hard to disagree with this. But whether such processes
completely undermine the possibility of a prokaryotic tree
of life is unclear and worthy of continued analysis and discussion. Although they make a strong case against such a
prokaryotic tree, I don't think that these authors will have
the last word on this.
Even if they are right about prokaryotes, they seem to
paint outside of the lines, in my view, by adding eukaryotic microbes (protists) to their argument: "we should
approach the study of microbial (prokaryotes and even
possibly protists) genome evolution openly and no longer
subordinate our approaches to the study of microbial evolution to the preconceived notion of the tree." This takes
the argument too far--there is currently no evidence that
eukaryotic microbes experience the same rates and patterns of LGT that would make the standard species concept and resulting tree outcomes like those of prokaryotic
microbes. While this is a subtle point; it is important. The
frequent reference throughout the paper to "microbes" is
misleading and should be changed to "prokaryotes". This
paper is about the differences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes and the impacts of these distinctions for (constructing) their evolutionary histories. I argue that this
distinction lies mainly in the way in which each lineage
has sex. If so, there is reason to think that any major group
of eukaryotic microbes is more prokaryotic-like in its sexual predilections than it is standardly meiotic.

In sum, this thought-provoking paper may help to pave a
clearer intellectual path for stubborn tree-monists like
myself. Although the suggestion of possible successors to
the traditional tree of life view (in which I would assign
myself to the first or second) is a positive step forward, I
have a nagging feeling that in embracing pluralism we just
might be missing the actual trees for the forest.

Long live the prokaryotic tree of life!
Answer to John Logsdon
We thank John Logsdon for this very elegant response. It is
worth noting that Logsdon, a meiosis expert, agrees with the
prokaryote-and-eukaryotes-are-different argument. We agree
with him that there is 'currently no evidence that eukaryotic
microbes experience the same rates and patterns of LGT that
would make the standard species concept and resulting tree outcomes like those of prokaryotic microbes'. Upon his advice, we
thus carefully replaced 'microbe/microbial' with 'prokaryote/
prokaryotic' where we really did mean only prokaryotes.

As for the existence, meaning and usefulness of the prokaryotic
tree of life, we also agree we won't have the last word on this
debate (but we were not really expecting to). Still, by making
the statements above, we feel we have clarified some issues and
cleared the ground for addressing what we feel are questions of
major importance for evolutionary biology and phylogeny. We
are encouraged by all three responses above to think we may
have shown how there is room for a diversity of thinking that
reflects the diversity of evolutionary processes.
