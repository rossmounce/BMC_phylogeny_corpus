Abstract
Background: An increasing number of studies demonstrate that genetic differentiation and speciation in
the sea occur over much smaller spatial scales than previously appreciated given the wide distribution
range of many morphologically defined coral reef invertebrate species and the presumed dispersalenhancing qualities of ocean currents. However, knowledge about the processes that lead to population
divergence and speciation is often lacking despite being essential for the understanding, conservation, and
management of marine biodiversity. Sponges, a highly diverse, ecologically and economically important
reef-invertebrate taxon, exhibit spatial trends in the Indo-West Pacific that are not universally reflected in
other marine phyla. So far, however, processes generating those unexpected patterns are not understood.
Results: We unraveled the phylogeographic structure of the widespread Indo-Pacific coral reef sponge
Leucetta chagosensis across its known geographic range using two nuclear markers: the rDNA internal
transcribed spacers (ITS 1&2) and a fragment of the 28S gene, as well as the second intron of the ATP
synthetase beta subunit-gene (ATPSb-iII). This enabled the detection of several deeply divergent clades
congruent over both loci, one containing specimens from the Indian Ocean (Red Sea and Maldives),
another one from the Philippines, and two other large and substructured NW Pacific and SW Pacific clades
with an area of overlap in the Great Barrier Reef/Coral Sea. Reciprocally monophyletic populations were
observed from the Philippines, Red Sea, Maldives, Japan, Samoa, and Polynesia, demonstrating longstanding isolation. Populations along the South Equatorial Current in the south-western Pacific showed
isolation-by-distance effects. Overall, the results pointed towards stepping-stone dispersal with some
putative long-distance exchange, consistent with expectations from low dispersal capabilities.
Conclusion: We argue that both founder and vicariance events during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene
were responsible to varying degrees for generating the deep phylogeographic structure. This structure was
perpetuated largely as a result of the life history of L. chagosensis, resulting in high levels of regional
isolation. Reciprocally monophyletic populations constitute putative sibling (cryptic) species, while
population para- and polyphyly may indicate incipient speciation processes. The genetic diversity and
biodiversity of tropical Indo-Pacific sponges appears to be substantially underestimated since the high level
of genetic divergence is not necessarily manifested at the morphological level.

Background
Knowledge about the processes that generate and maintain marine biodiversity, and the evolutionary relationships and genetic variation of regional populations, along
with assessments of the amount of demographic connection between these populations, are essential for understanding and effectively conserving and managing marine
resources [1] such as the highly diverse coral reefs [2].
However, this information is currently lacking in the
Indo-Pacific for most coral reef organisms other than fish
and corals [3], which is surprising considering their diversity and the significant ecological and economic roles
played by this ecosystem [4].
Because marine organisms frequently have high dispersal
potential (e.g. [5]), their ranges have often been considered to be vast. However, populations have frequently
been found to be highly genetically differentiated [6].
Sometimes they exhibit fine-scale endemism [7], and
(cryptic) speciation is a common process in the sea [8].
Two main processes have been invoked as responsible for
allopatric speciation in the tropical Indo-West Pacific
(IWP): vicariance, where a species' previously coherent
geographic range has become fragmented following the
formation of a barrier to dispersal; or speciation through
a founder effect, where a new population is established by
a small number of individuals, often by long-distance dispersal, and subsequent restricted gene flow has led to speciation (reviewed in [9]). Both processes are probably the
extremes of a continuum rather than being mutually
exclusive [10], but the degree of their interplay remains
poorly understood.
This study focuses on tropical marine sponges, a highly
diverse, ecologically and economically important, but
notoriously understudied, marine invertebrate taxon [11].
Biodiversity analyses of Australasian tropical sponges
based on species occurrence data have, for example,
revealed quite different trends from those of other marine
phyla in the IWP [12]. Latitudinal gradients in sponge
diversity were not evident, but various environmental factors were prominent at small spatial (α-diversity) scales.
Patterns observed at larger spatial (γ and ε) scales of diversity have been ascribed to biogeographic factors and connectivity (reviewed in [13]). However, investigations
based on morphometric data alone did not suffice to
unravel the biogeographic factors and connectivity among
populations.
The lemon-yellow calcareous sponge Leucetta chagosensis
Dendy 1913 (Porifera: Calcarea: Leucettidae) served here
as a model to test biogeographic and phylogeographic
hypotheses, and to determine the degree of connectivity
vs. isolation among populations, with a focus on the SW
Pacific. L. chagosensis has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/24

ranging from the northern Red Sea to the central Pacific
(Moorea, Tuamotu) and from Okinawa (Japan) to Brisbane (Moreton Bay, Australia), and was considered to be
a single species throughout this range [14]. However, the
validity of this assumption has been challenged by molecular data [15]. L. chagosensis is relatively common and is
typically found in shaded habitats below a water depth of
15 m. It is often the dominant macro-sponge in semicryptic habitats, e.g., on the Great Astrolabe Reef (Fiji)
(Wörheide, pers. observ.). It is viviparous, and as such, is
thought to have low dispersal capabilities, as is the case
for many other sponges [16]. Initial attempts to use mitochondrial gene sequences (cytochrome oxidase II) to
resolve phylogeographic patterns of L. chagosensis in the
western Pacific were unsuccessful due to the low variability of this marker [17]. Such low intraspecific mtDNA variation is apparently a general mtDNA feature in sponges
and anthozoan cnidarians, presumably due to the low
rate of their mtDNA evolution [18-20]. A subsequent phylogeographic study, focussing on the SW Pacific, used
rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences that
provided better resolution and uncovered a deep phylogeographic break on the Great Barrier Reef with distinct
northern and southern clades. Each of these GBR clades
was more closely related to the Indonesian clade than to
each other, and a vicariance scenario of fragmentation
and range expansion during and after the last glacial sea
level low was suggested as a cause for this structure [15].
The aims of the present study were as follows: to unravel
the phylogeographic structure of L. chagosensis over its full
geographic range using two nuclear loci; to estimate the
degree of connectivity among regional populations; to
determine whether vicariance or founder dispersal was
responsible for generating the observed patterns; and to
test L. chagosensis' taxonomic status as a widespread IndoPacific species.

Results
rDNA
ITS, partial 28S sequences
Our data set of 176 individuals [see Additional file 1]
includes samples covering the known geographic extent of
L. chagosensis (Fig. 1). The first rDNA fragment used
(referred to hereafter as ITS) includes the 3' end of the 18S
gene, the full ITS1, the 5.8S gene, and the nearly complete
ITS2. It was combined with a fragment from the C2-D2
region of the 28S gene. See Table 1 for general features of
both fragments. Although previous studies did not detect
any intragenomic polymorphisms (IGPs) in the ITS
regions either by SSCP [15] or by the subcloning of amplicons [21], a few IGPs were detected here, both in the ITS
and partial 28S gene. All polymorphic sequence types
could be resolved into two sequence types per individual.
Both rDNA fragments had a high GC content (Table 1,

53–61.9%), in the normal range for sponge rDNA
[21,22].
rDNA sequence type network
The estimated statistical parsimony network, which had a
maximum calculated connection limit of 14 steps (at 95%
confidence), is shown in Figure 2. It was congruent in its
general topology with a phylogeny estimated by Bayesian
inference (BI), which had low branch support (similar to
[15]) (not shown). The network showed the sequence
types oriented along a central axis, with two main clusters
near the top and bottom ends. The top cluster, centered
around the most frequent sequence type S14, contained
specimens from the Northern GBR, the Coral Sea, Guam,
Taiwan, Papua New Guinea, and Sulawesi (shaded in
blue). The bottom cluster, centered around the second
most frequent sequence type S10, contained specimens
from the Central and Southern GBR, the Coral Sea, and
PNG (shaded in dark green). Sequence types from the
Central South Pacific (shaded in lighter green) form an
ambiguous loop in the network that could not be resolved
with confidence. Leucetta villosa Wörheide & Hooper
1999, the putative GBR-sister taxon of Leucetta chagosensis,
is located within this part of the network. Towards the top
cluster, a number of deeply separated branches contain

sequence types from the Philippines, the Red Sea, and one
specimen from Vanuatu. The last branch, closest to the
top cluster, contains sequence types from Japan, Indonesia, and PNG (shaded in lighter blue).
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA)
AMOVAs were carried out for two subsets of the data: subset 1 contained all samples from the total 15 geographically pooled populations in four regional groups (i.e. the
whole data set), and subset 2 contained a more spatially
restricted set of individuals from the SW Pacific only. For
subset 1 (Table 2), the rDNA genetic variation was hierarchically structured, with about 41% distributed among
populations within the groups, about 42% within populations, and only about 17% among the four groups. Fixation indices showed significant high genetic structuring
at all hierarchical levels, with the highest structuring
within populations and the lowest among groups. For
subset 2, less than 3% of the variation was distributed
between the two groups, with no significant differentiation. Slightly more than a third of the variation was distributed among populations within the groups, which
were highly differentiated, and a little less than two thirds
of the variation was distributed within highly differentiated populations.

Hierarchical structuring of molecular variation (AMOVA) within and among a priori defined populations and groups based on rDNA sequences only.

ATP-Synthetase beta subunit intron II (ATPSb-iII)
Sequences and alignment
Both alleles of ATPSb-iII, a phase-0 intron [see Additional
file 2], could be resolved from 113 specimens of L. chagosensis. The length of the intron varied between about 750
bp in most individuals to 1089 bp in the population from
Okinawa, Japan, due to a very long insertion. The maximum uncorrected p-distance among alleles was 9.57%,
with a nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.03524 – about a fourfold increase in variation compared to the rDNA regions
sequenced (see Table 1). No significant deviation from
neutrality was found (Tajima's D: -1.20920, not significant) and no recombination was detected.

Several indels of various lengths were observed; some
were minisatellite repeats restricted to certain populations, e.g. Vanuatu. Length variant heterozygotes differed
either in the number of residues in a stretch of homomer
thymidines starting at position 301 (max T10) or in a few
private indels. After collapsing the 226 alleles of the 113
specimens sequenced, 89 unique alleles remained.
Phylogeny estimation
The estimated unrooted Bayesian phylogeny of the 89
unique alleles is shown in Figure 3 [see also Additional
file 3]. An estimated phylogeny using the maximum likelihood optimality criterion showed the same topology,
and a statistical parsimony network, constructed using
TCS with the 95% connection limit, yielded several disconnected networks (not shown). In the Bayesian phylogeny, six main larger clades were present, all of which were
well supported by posterior probabilities (PP, >95%) or
bootstrap proportions in Maximum Likelihood analyses
(BP, >70). The unrooted tree was characterized by one
polytomy, in which the relationships among the four
main clades could not be resolved. The general phylogeographic patterns were congruent with the rDNA network
(Fig. 2). Several populations were reciprocally mono-

phyletic (Red Sea, Maldives, Philippines, Japan, Samoa,
Polynesia), while others were paraphyletic (e.g. Vanuatu)
or polyphyletic (Papua New Guinea, Great Barrier Reef,
Coral Sea). Alleles from the Philippines were most divergent.
An estimated phylogeny with all 226 alleles had the same
topology, and showed that alleles from heterozygous
individuals that were subcloned to resolve length variant
alleles were found in the same larger clade and were not
dispersed among distantly related clades (not shown).
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA)
AMOVAs were carried out for two subsets of the data, as
defined above for the rDNA. For subset 1 (Table 3),
genetic variation was, in part, hierarchically structured,
with about 9% distributed among the four groups, about
57% among populations within the groups, and about
34% within populations. Fixation indices showed significantly high genetic divergence within populations and
among populations within groups, with non-significant
among-group differentiation. For subset 2, about 10% of
the variation was distributed among the two groups,
which were not significantly differentiated. About 46% of
the variation was distributed among highly differentiated
populations within groups, and about 44% within highly
differentiated populations.
Pairwise Fixation Indices (FST)
All but two pairwise comparisons of genetic differentiation between eight populations in the SW Pacific based on
FST values were statistically significant at the 99% confidence level (see Table 4). The lowest significant value
observed was 0.1, between the population from the Central GBR and Papua New Guinea. Most other pairwise
comparisons had values of more than 0.25, and the highest values observed were above 0.9 (0.94: Sunshine Coast/
Brisbane vs. Northern GBR; 0.99: Sunshine Coast/Bris-

between the population from the Capricorn Section of the
southern GBR and the adjacent population from the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane indicated no significant genetic
differentiation. Testing for a pattern of isolation-by-distance by performing a Mantel test between genetic (FST)
and spatial distances did not reveal any significant relationships (r = 0.273, P = 0.0758) for the whole data set
(subset 1: 15 populations), but an analysis of populations
along the South Equatorial Current (subset 2: 8 populations) revealed a weak but significant correlation (r =

0.439, P = 0.0326) (not shown). However, some populations did not match this trend; as was the case for some of
the pairwise comparisons among populations on the EastAustralian coast: S'GBR-Central GBR, S'GBR-N'GBR, Brisbane-Central GBR, Brisbane-N'GBR (compare with Table
4). Calculations using log-transformed distances and logtransformed gene flow parameters (M) revealed significant negative correlations for the 15 population subset (r
= -0.3927, P = 0.0144; Fig. 4a) and the eight population
subset (r = -0.4177, P = 0.0327; Fig. 4b).

Hierarchical structuring of molecular variation (AMOVA) within and among a priori defined populations and groups based on ATPSb-iII sequences
only. Subset 1: 15 populations grouped into four groups; Subset 2: 8 populations from the SW Pacific grouped into two groups. Statistical significance
is based on 10,100 permutations in Arlequin: * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.001.

Combined rDNA and ATPSb-intron analyses
Phylogeny estimation
All three fragments – ITS, the C2-D2 regions of the rDNA,
and ATPSb-iII – were obtained for 105 specimens [see
Additional file 1]. Among those, 92 unique genotypes
were found. The estimated Bayesian phylogeny is shown
in Figure 5a. The general topology was congruent with the
phylogeny estimated from the ATPSb-iII-only alignment.
Several deeply diverging major clades were detected,
highly supported by posterior probabilities and maximum likelihood bootstrap values, allowing for an
increased resolution compared to the ATPSb-iII-only phylogeny and solving the polytomy among the four larger
clades with their main geographic distribution in the
Indo-Northwest Pacific (compared with Fig. 3). A closer
relationship of the Indian Ocean clades (Fig. 5b, red) to
the remaining ones from the Indo-Northwest Pacific (Fig.
5b, blue) was revealed in an unrooted phylogeny, which
also suggested a closer relationship of the Philippine clade
with the clades from the southern Pacific [see also Fig. 5a
and Additional file 4]. The main clade geographically
restricted to the southern Pacific (Fig. 5, green) was, itself,
substructured into two sister-groups: the south-central
Pacific sensu stricto (Fiji, Samoa, Polynesia) and the southwestern Pacific, restricted to PNG and Australia's East
coast. Several regional populations showed reciprocal
monophyly (e.g., the Red Sea, Maldives, Japan, Philippines, Samoa, Polynesia), while others were para- or
polyphyletic (e.g., Vanuatu and PNG/GBR). The geographic distribution of two of the main clades (green and
blue in Fig. 5a) in the area of the GBR and PNG are also
illustrated in Fig. 5c.
Neighbor-Net analyses
Neighbor-Net analyses of the two separate rDNA and
ATPSb-iII partitions of the 92 genotype data set were carried out to explore ambiguities in the data and to evaluate
the degree of congruence among both loci [see Additional
file 5]. Some ambiguities were detected in the ATPSb-iII
Neighbor-Net, especially among genotypes from the
southern Pacific (small loops in the network). The rDNA

Neighbor-Net showed a much higher degree of incompatible splits (i.e., larger loops). Both were largely congruent
with the phylogenies estimated using other methods
(Figs. 2 and 3).
A comparison of the two Neighbor Nets revealed that the
position of several genotypes was different in the two networks (highlighted in red color). G9 (L. villosa) was found
among southern GBR genotypes in the ATPSb-iII Neighbor-Net, whereas they were found among South-Central
Pacific genotypes in the rDNA Neighbor-Net, where they
were closely related to those from Vanuatu (compare also
with Fig. 2). Similarly, G46 (Bali) grouped with genotypes
from the north-western Pacific in the ATPSb-iII NeighborNet, but was closest to a second genotype from Bali (G47)
in the rDNA Neighbor-Net. Also, the position of G14
(Hook Reef, GBR) was different in both networks.
Estimation of migration rates and directions
Migration rates and directions were estimated for two subsets: 1) a three large-population case, where populations
from the East coast of Australia, PNG, and the South
Pacific were pooled based on geography (Table 5), and a
spatially more restricted six population case, also based
on geography, containing five populations from Australia
plus the one from PNG (Table 6). Populations contained
the same specimens as those used for the AMOVA analysis. Very low migration among populations was estimated
for subset 1 (Nem: 0.05 to 0.31, Table 5), but for the more
detailed subset 2, higher asymmetrical migration was estimated within the GBR (mean Nem up to 3.03, Table 6).
Outside the GBR, the only population that was estimated
to receive more than one effective immigrant per generation was PNG (Nem up to 1.32 from the Central GBR,
Table 6).

Discussion
In this study, the phylogeographic structure of the widely
distributed coral reef sponge Leucetta chagosensis was
investigated throughout its known Indo-Pacific range,
using two unlinked nuclear DNA markers, the rDNA ITS,

were uncovered, and were congruent across both loci.
Based on the present data, we argue that life history traits
(low dispersal capabilities) in combination with historical factors (tectonics, sea level fluctuations) are responsible for the diversification of the study taxon over space
and time.

Connectivity, or lack thereof
A relationship is expected to exist between the amount of
genetic differentiation of allopatric marine populations
and their dispersal abilities [23], with low dispersing taxa
showing higher genetic structuring and a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation-by-distance, IBD) compared to those capable of wide
dispersal [24]. In this study, genetic variation was significantly structured among and within populations, but no
IBD was detected across the whole set of populations. This
suggests that, overall, the colonization process of L. chagosensis was discontinuous, with founder effects occurring
when new populations were established [10], and that the
very low migration rates were responsible for the lack of
genetic cohesiveness. A weak, but significantly positive
correlation between FST and geographic distance was
detected among populations connected along the South
Equatorial Current (SEC), consistent with expectations
based on low dispersal capabilities; some populations on
the Australian east coast were also highly differentiated
despite their close geographic proximity, probably
because there was an area of overlap of two of the deepest
diverging clades (see below).

marker for sponge evolutionary studies, the second intron
of the ATP synthetase beta subunit gene (ATPSb-iII). Deep
genetic divergences, substantial phylogeographic structure, and substantial amounts of regional isolation with
low amounts of migration among regional populations

Occasional gene flow in a stepping-stone model [25,26],
in which dispersal and genetic exchange occur only
between adjacent populations, was suggested by the significant negative slopes of the RMA regression of the logarithmic transformed values (distances and M) for both
the whole set of populations and the ones along the SEC.
However, the negative slopes (respectively -0.3451 and 0.4177) were shallower than expected for a strict steppingstone model (-0.5 for a two-dimensional array, [26]) and
might indicate some long-distance dispersal [27]. Unfortunately, low geographic coverage of L. chagosensis samples from the South Pacific (e.g. Fiji, Samoa, etc.)
prohibited further analysis and inference at this stage.
The low migration rates, below one effective migrant per
generation, frequently observed here are less than the
minimum required (i.e., 1 Nem) to compensate for
genetic drift, and thwart continued genetic divergence of
populations [28]. For the GBR, these values are lower than
those reported for GBR invertebrates [29,30]. In a conservation context, where some authors have argued for the
use of a threshold of 10 effective migrants per generation
as a minimum to counteract local extinction risks [31], the
overall low number of migrants encountered here is cause

for concern because isolated populations are clearly prone
to local extinction. Such a high degree of regional isolation certainly needs to be taken into consideration for the
effective design of marine protected areas [1].
Results from the present study suggest that the colonization of new distant habitats by L. chagosensis and the
genetic cohesiveness among them cannot be sustained by
the dispersal of sexual propagules alone. Occasional longdistance dispersal, either by asexual fragments [32,33] or
by rafting [34] might play a role. To date, there is no direct
evidence for long-range dispersal in the studied taxon, but
the discovery of a budding specimen of L. chagosensis (Fig.
6; G. Wörheide pers. obs. at Ribbon Reef No. 10 in February 2006) provides evidence that asexual dispersal does
occur naturally. Such asexual fragments (buds) constitute
fully functional mini-sponges that are probably capable of
surviving for a considerable amount of time in the plankton (or rafting on pumice, for example) before potentially
colonizing distant reef habitats.
Genealogical patterns
The structure of the rDNA sequence type network, with
the two most common sequence types at opposite ends of
the network ("star-bursts") connected by a longer branch,
is reminiscent of a "dumbbell" shaped network [35],
which apparently indicates that two long-separated populations each underwent a (recent) expansion. This interpretation would support a scenario where populations
were separated during low sea level stands, and subsequently expanded with rising sea levels from refuges on
the Queensland Plateau and the shallower shelf south of
the GBR [15]. This hypothesis, originally formulated by
Davies [36], is also supported by a number of other
genetic studies on fish and corals (e.g. [37-39]). However,
such a vicariance scenario is complicated by the intermediate allopatric populations in the rDNA network, and
was not supported by a recent study of calcareous sponges

from the same calcarean family Leucettidae, Pericharax
heteroraphis, using the same molecular markers (ITS
rDNA, ATPSb-iII) [40]. Here, Bentlage and Wörheide
observed much less variation in both markers and no phylogeographic (genealogical) structure on the GBR, and
attributed this to the retention of ancestral ITS rDNA polymorphisms and a relatively recent expansion after a population bottleneck. This suggests considerable amounts of
idiosyncrasy in each species' (demographic) history.
Using the rDNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS) for phylogenetic inferences poses some difficulties. The internal
transcribed spacers (ITS) separate the 18S and 28S rDNA
genes in the tandemly repeated rDNA cistron [41]. While
variation among the multiple ITS copies is normally
homogenized by a process called 'concerted evolution'
[42], intragenomic polymorphisms (IGP) [21] do occur,
e.g., if concerted evolution is slow [43]. The occurrence of
potentially paralogous ITS copies can then confound phylogenetic inferences [21,44]. The few rDNA IGPs detected
in this study could all be resolved into two different
sequence types, and were always found to be closely
related and clade-specific, most likely representing
orthologs. Nonetheless, reconstruction of sequence types
from rDNA IGPs by haplotype inference should always be
preceded by subcloning of rDNA amplicons of several
individuals to check the extent of intragenomic polymorphism [21]. We consider the risks of analysing paralogous
rDNA sequence types to be minimal in this case, but the
inclusion of additional and independent loci is necessary
to untangle the true demographic history from locus-specific forces because only genealogical concordance across
multiple unlinked loci can elucidate whether phylogeographic breaks are caused by stochasticity or by real barriers to gene flow [45].
To this end, our analysis of ATPSb-iII sequences provided
pivotal insight. This new marker showed about five-fold

higher substitution rates than the rDNA, and higher phylogeographic resolution was achieved with congruent
deeper coalescent patterns across loci. Based on the data
presented here, we argue that the high concordance
between the two loci is due to population substructuring
and putative reproductive isolation, and not to the linked
inheritance of both loci (for which no data currently
exist).
The large divergence of the reciprocally monophyletic
genotypes from the Philippines, with their divergence
especially pronounced among the intron alleles, points to
a long-standing isolation of the Philippine population.
The Philippine islands are an area of complex island-geomorphology that have undergone complicated tectonics,
with some islands on crustal fragments originating far
south-east of their present position [46]. Several of today's
islands have emerged since the late Miocene (about 10
million years ago), and the sampled area at the northern
reef of Bohol probably belonged to Proto-Mindanao dur-

ing the Pliocene [47]. Initial colonization could have happened by long-distance dispersal soon after reef habitats
were established. This could then have been followed by
persistence when subsequent changes in shoreline constellations due to cycling sea levels reinforced the genetic
isolation of this region [29], resulting in the deeply divergent and reciprocally monophyletic clade discovered here.
Such apparent founder speciation has been previously
described in the terrestrial fauna of the Philippines [47],
but might be more widespread in marine biota than previously appreciated [10]. This could also be responsible
for generating and maintaining the other reciprocally
monophyletic populations discovered here. However, for
more in-depth interpretations of the remarkable divergence of the Philippine population, a broader geographic
coverage of the whole island group would be required.
Substantial amounts of local endemism (reciprocal
monophyly) were also uncovered, pointing to considerable amounts of regional isolation similar to what has been
found in some other reef invertebrates [7]. This is also
consistent with expectations based on low dispersal capabilities. However, some populations were found to be
para- or polyphyletic. Such a pattern of population polyor paraphyly may be caused by either incomplete lineage
sorting or recurrent (recent and historic) gene flow among
previously separated clades [35], or both of these factors.
These two processes of shared alleles among distinct
clades are hard to distinguish on the basis of genetic data
alone [48]. Avise [35] proposed that deep coalescence of
polyphyletically distributed lineages would point to
incomplete lineage sorting, whereas shallow genealogical
patterns would be caused by recent gene flow. For L.
chagosensis, all polyphyletic populations (e.g. PNG, GBR)
showed deep coalescence, as expected for a scenario of
incomplete lineage sorting. However, the previous differentiation of geographically restricted reciprocally monophyletic lineages with subsequent re-dispersal into each
others' ranges are equally likely to have caused the appar-

derive a mutation rate of roughly 1% ITS rDNA sequence
divergence per million years for this demosponge. While
the validity of applying this mutation rate estimate to a
phylogenetically distant taxon is untested, it does currently represent the only option for a rough estimation of
divergence times among L. chagosensis clades. Thus, the
deepest divergences among L. chagosensis ITS rDNA
sequence types would have happened about 2 million
years ago in the late Pliocene, and subsequent divergences
would have occurred in the Pleistocene (see Table 1). The
late Pliocene, an era with fluctuating sea levels [52], and
the resulting differences in shoreline distributions and
current (dispersal) patterns, has been estimated to be the
time of vicariant speciation in a number of marine taxa, as
has the Pleistocene [29].

Conclusion
ent overlap in geographic distribution of the two deepest
diverging clades in the area of PNG and East Australia.
Based on the presence of putative hybrids (see below), we
favor the latter scenario. However, more extensive geographic sampling from those critical regions would be
beneficial to allow additional conclusions.
Under the phylogenetic species concept [49,50], all reciprocally monophyletic groups uncovered here would represent different recognizable taxa and ESUs (Evolutionary
Significant Units [51]). The degree of reproductive isolation among those ESUs cannot be discerned at present,
i.e., whether they are from a single, still-interbreeding
widespread species, or instead constitute a reproductively
isolated sibling (and morphologically cryptic) species.
Support for the latter came from the near-fixation of alternative ATPSb-iII alleles in some populations, e.g., between
the populations from Brisbane and Polynesia. The occurrence of a different combination of ATPSb-iII alleles and
rDNA sequence types in some individuals, uncovered by
their different clade-affiliations, is an indication of occurrences of hybridization and incomplete reproductive isolation. One of those hybrids is L. villosa, was described as
a closely related sister-species of L. chagosensis based solely
on morphological data [14]. This is evidence that those
hybrids are also manifested as (morphologically) distinguishable phenotypes.
The temporal aspect
Resolving the temporal frame of clade divergences in L.
chagosensis remains a challenge due to the paucity of unequivocally identifiable fossil remains. We also lack information about mutation rates in this taxon. Only from the
study of Wörheide et al. [21], who analysed divergences in
rDNA ITS sequences in several reciprocally monophyletic
populations of Prosuberites laughlini (Demospongiae:
Hadromerida) across the Isthmus of Panama, can we

Deep phylogeographic structure was uncovered in this
study, congruent across the two nuclear markers used.
There was low gene flow among most regional populations, some of which showed isolation-by-distance
effects. Overall, dispersal was indicated in a steppingstone model with some long-distance genetic exchange –
all consistent with expectations from the allegedly low
dispersal capability of the taxon. Reciprocally monophyletic populations have long been isolated and constitute putative sibling species, but the degree of
reproductive isolation between para- and polyphyletic
populations remains to be investigated in more detail.
Hybrids displaying mixed genotypes from deeply divergent clades were rare, but one (L. villosa) was morphologically distinguishable. L. chagosensis might therefore be
regarded as a complex of closely related (cryptic) species
rather than a single widespread species.
However, we cannot conclusively determine at present
whether the observed structure was generated solely by
vicariance resulting from glacio-eustatic changes during
the late Pliocene and Pleistocene, or was simply a result of
general dispersal limitation with stochastic long-distance
dispersal and founder speciation. However, both processes supposedly contributed with varying degrees to the
generation and/or maintenance of the observed phylogeographic structure in each region.
The low migration rates observed here are not sufficient to
counteract the continued genetic divergence and regional
isolation of populations. Geographically restricted and
deeply divergent genealogical lineages of taxa with low
dispersal capabilities are therefore prone to local extinction, since immigrants from more viable, distant habitats
cannot easily replenish populations depleted of genetic
diversity. These results highlight the need for comprehensive biodiversity estimates (i.e., based on true genetic
diversity) when considering an effective design and imple-

then used for subsequent PCR amplification of the larger
data set.

Methods

PCR reactions consisted of 2 mM MgCl2, 16 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 67 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.8 at 25°C), and 0.01%
Tween-20. Each 25 μl reaction included 1.0 μl of DNeasyextracted DNA of various concentration, 0.625 μl dNTPs
(10 mM each), 1.5 mM of each primer, and 0.25 U BioTaq DNA polymerase (Bioline, Luckenwalde). PCR
cycling conditions included an initial denaturation of 2
min at 94°C; 38 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 54°C for 60 s, and
72°C for 50 s; and a final extension step at 72°C for 10
min. Amplicons were purified from Agarose gels using a
silica-based method [58]. PCR products were sequenced
directly with ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
(Version 3.1) on an ABI 3100, and some PCR products
were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. A minimum of three positive
clones were sequenced in both directions using M13 vector primers to determine if more than two alleles were
present, indicating paralogous copies. Amplicons were
directly sequenced as above. Because the specific primers
were very close to the exon/intron boundaries, the first 42
bases of the 5'- end and the first 53 bases of the 3'- end of
the intron were not included in the final alignment.

Sample collection
Leucetta chagosensis specimens were collected by SCUBA
diving on subtidal reef slopes. Specimens from the East
Coast of Australia, the Coral Sea, Vanuatu, the Red Sea
and Japan were collected by Gert Wörheide (GW); other
specimens were received from various colleagues. Due to
this fact, and because this taxon can be quite rare (e.g. in
the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea), sample sizes were limited in some localities, varying from two in Fiji to 10 in the
Philippines individuals per site. Voucher sample numbers
and localities are given in Additional file 1. Immediately
after collection on deck, macroinvertebrate commensals
were carefully removed, if present, and parts of the choanosome were cut into small pieces. Sometimes, small
specimens were preserved whole. Samples were preserved
in >90% ethanol or in silica-gel after being cut into small
pieces, and were stored at -20°C or room temperature
until extraction (see also [15,53]). The external surface
was avoided to minimize potential contamination.
Voucher samples have been deposited at the Queensland
Museum, Brisbane, Australia (indicated by the prefix
"QMG" in Additional Table 1 see Additional File 1) or are
held by G. Wörheide.
DNA extraction and PCR amplification
Genomic DNA was extracted from the choanosomal tissue using the DNeasy-Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) and partial 28S (C2-D2 region [54]) rDNA
sequences were generated according to previously published protocols [15,21,55].

The second intron of the ATP synthetase beta subunit gene
(ATPSb-iII) was amplified using the following strategy.
Initially, degenerate primers (ATPSbf1: 5'-CGT GAG GGH
AAY GAT TTH TAC CAT GAG ATG AT-3'; ATPSbr1: 5'CGG GCA CGG GCR CCD GGN GGT TCG TTC AT-3';
[56]) were used for PCR amplification of four samples
from disparate geographic areas (Red Sea, Taiwan, GBR,
Tuamotu). BLAST searches [57] were run to confirm that
the amplified sequences were of poriferan origin. Exon/
intron boundaries were determined by comparison with
ATPS beta gene sequences from Genbank. The intron was
determined to start about 2.3 kb downstream from the 5'end of Exon 1 in Drosophila melanogaster (Position 3416;
GenBank accession no. X86015). From an initial alignment, nested species-specific primers were designed
(ATPSbf2: 5'-TTG TCT TGG ACA AGG AGG GG-3';
ATPSbr2: 5'-TCG TTC ATT TGA CCG TAC AC-3'), which
were still located in the exon but were about 10–15 bp
closer to the exon/intron boundary. These primers were

Sequence assembly and alignment
Double-stranded sequences of novel sequences generated
in this study were assembled with CodonCode Aligner
[59], automatically aligned using ClustalW [60], and
manually inspected and optimized using Se-Al v2.0a11
[61]. Existing rDNA ITS sequence types of Leucetta chagosensis from previous studies [15,21] (Genbank accession
nos. AF458852–AF458870) were added to the alignment.
Polymorphic sites in heterozygotes were detected using
the 'find mutations' option in the CodonCode Aligner,
and coded using IUPAC [62] ambiguous DNA characters.
Alleles of heterozygotes that showed no length variation
within individuals were resolved manually using a parsimony approach, in an attempt to minimize the number of
alleles observed in the data set [63]. Intragenomic polymorphisms in rDNA were resolved into two different
sequence types per individual using the same approach,
primarily to enable estimation of migration rates in
MIGRATE (see below). Due to the low intraspecific diversity of the C2-D2 fragment, rDNA alignments were concatenated for subsequent phylogeographic analyses. All
sequences from this study were submitted to the EMBL
Nucleotide Sequence Database and can be accessed under
the
following
accession
numbers:
[EMBL:
AM850255–AM850677].
Intron heterozygous indel detection
We attempted to resolve length variant heterozygotes
(LVH), which often cause problems when analyzing

intron sequences [64], using Single-Stranded Conformational Polymorphism (SSCP) analyses [65], as described
in [40]. However, the intron was too long for alleles to be
resolved using this method. Therefore, to obtain an overview of the distribution of LVH alleles on the estimated
phylogenies, i.e. whether one heterozygote individual
harbours alleles distributed in different larger clades on
the estimated phylogeny, amplicons of several such heterozygotes from each larger clade were subcloned as above,
sequenced, and both alleles were included in the alignment. Due to restricted resources, it was not possible to
subclone and sequence both alleles of all heterozygous
individuals.
Indels and minisatellite repeats were treated as missing
data, and were not recoded for phylogenetic analyses
because they represented autapomorphies for regional
populations, and as such did not contribute to resolving
phylogeographic structure.
Phylogenetic analyses
All sequences were assembled and aligned as described
above. Uncorrected p-distances were calculated using
Paup*4 [66]. Nucleotide diversities and GC contents were
calculated, and tests of neutrality using Tajima's D [67]
were carried out in DNAsp v4.1 [68]. Nuclear loci are subject to recombination, potentially confounding phylogeny estimation [69]. Consequently, recombination rates
and events were estimated using RDP 2.0 [70], employing
the default options with all methods implemented in the
program suite (RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, Chimera,
SciScan). The program MODELTEST version 3.7 [71] was
used to find the model of DNA substitution that best fit
the rDNA and intron data. The best-fit model selected for
each sequenced region by hierarchical Akaike information
criterion (AIC) [72] (ITS rDNA: TIM+G, partial 28S rDNA:
HKY+I, intron: TrN+G) was used for a subsequent Bayesian phylogeny inference (BI) using MrBayes 3.1.2 [73]
with default priors and mixed models.

Phylogenies were estimated from the combined ITS/partial 28S rDNA alignment, the intron alignment, and a
combined ITS/28S/intron alignment containing only
specimens from which all three fragments could be
obtained. For the latter, consensus sequences of ATPSb-iII
alleles were used and concatenated with both rDNA fragments into one alignment. Alignments were collapsed to
contain only unique sequence types/alleles in COLLAPSE
1.2 [74] for phylogeny estimation, and intron sequences
were additionally analyzed using the full number of
detected alleles.
Three independent runs with one cold and seven heated
Markov chains each per analysis were performed simultaneously in MrBayes 3.1.2 until the average standard devi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/24

ation of split frequencies between the three runs dropped
below 0.005 (lowered from the default value of 0.01 to
improve chain convergence). Analyses were carried out
with the MPI-enabled parallel version of MrBayes [75] on
a 64-node Linux-cluster at the Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung Göttingen (GWDG), using
one processor for each of the 24 Markov chains per analysis. Batch files are available upon request. All MrBayes
analyses were run at least twice to check for the consistency of results. The second analysis was allowed to run
longer without a stop value, until the wall time of 48
hours was reached, to check if convergence of chains
could be further improved. Trees were sampled every
1000th cycle, with a burn-in of 25% of sampled trees. The
appropriateness of burn-in values was determined after
the graphical display of likelihood values, and the convergence of chains was evaluated using AWTY [76]. The
remaining trees after burn-in were used to generate a 50%
majority rule consensus tree, where posterior probabilities
for internal branches were indicated by their sample frequency.
For comparison, Maximum Likelihood bootstrap analyses
were conducted with GARLI 0.94 [77] using a heuristic
search with the default option, i.e. under the GTR model
of nucleotide substitution, with gamma distributed rate
heterogeneity, a proportion of invariant sites, and 100
bootstrap replicates. Phylogenies estimated from the
intron-only and combined rDNA/intron data set were
rooted with the Indian Ocean clades, as they represent a
different biogeographic region (e.g. [78]). Outgroup rooting with intron sequences from a closely related species
was not possible because such sequences were unalignable due to high evolutionary rates, and because the same
intron in Pericharax heteroraphis, for example, is about
60% shorter [40].
Due to the low divergence of rDNA sequences, we estimated a statistical parsimony sequence type network [79]
using the program TCS 1.21 [80] with the default options.
The maximum number of mutational steps that constitute
a parsimonious connection between two sequence types
was calculated with 95% confidence. An attempt at constructing a nested clade design [81] was not successful
because no unambiguous nested design could be constructed due to a central loop that could not be resolved
with confidence.
To obtain an overview of the level of ambiguity and phylogeographic congruency within and among loci and to
visually explore the different signals contained in the data,
the concatenated alignment was divided into rDNA and
ATPSb-iII partitions. Each partition contained samples
from 92 specimens from which both loci could be
sequenced. Both loci were analyzed separately using

Neighbor-Net [82], as implemented in SplitsTree4 [83],
using uncorrected p-distances.
In brief, Neighbor-Net is a distance-based method that
provides an effective tool to visualize and detect conflicting signals or alternative phylogenetic histories. First, a
collection of weighted splits is constructed from a distance
matrix, and then these splits are represented using a splits
graph, where a totally compatible collection of splits
would be precisely represented as a tree, but incompatible
splits as cycles or boxes. Such incompatibilities might represent, among other things, hybridization, recombination, gene duplication, or in general, conflicting signals in
the data. In general, the more (and larger) cycles/boxes
connecting operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a split
graph, the more incompatibilities of splits and incongruences exist in the data.
Population genetic analyses
Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [84] was conducted to estimate the significance of population structure
at several hierarchical levels. Pairwise fixation indices (Fst)
[85] and their significance were calculated for intron alleles only to estimate population differentiation because
true heterozygotes cannot be distinguished from intragenomic variation in the rDNA cistron (see [86]), however,
an AMOVA was carried out using the rDNA sequence
types. Calculations were carried out in ARLEQUIN 3.1
[87] using 10,100 random permutations for significance
tests. All analyses were run at least twice to check for the
consistency of results. Two sets of analyses were run for
each data set separately, because Arlequin does not allow
for unequal sample sizes among loci. First, sample localities were pooled into 15 geographic populations. Pooling
of sample localities into populations on the Great Barrier
Reef (GBR) followed the sections of the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park: N'GBR, Central GBR, Capricorn (GBR), Brisbane, Queensland Plateau; Taiwan, Guam, Okinawa,
Philippines, Indonesia; Maldives, Red Sea; and PNG,
Samoa/Fiji/Vanuatu, Polynesia. The 15 populations were
grouped into four regional groups (separated by semicolons in the previous list: Australia, NW Pacific, S'Pacific,
and Indian Ocean). Due to low sample sizes from some
archipelagos in the SW Pacific (Fiji, Samoa) in the intron
data set, those localities were pooled with samples from
Vanuatu as one population in order to increase the statistical power. To enable comparison between the two loci,
the same geographic population structure was employed
for the rDNA data set, where more sequences were available from those archipelagos. A second analysis included
only eight populations from the SW Pacific (Northern
GBR, Central GBR, Capricorn, Brisbane, Queensland Plateau, PNG, Samoa/Fiji/Vanuatu, and Polynesia), grouped
into two groups (Australia, S'Pacific), where sampling was
more comprehensive both in terms of geography and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/24

sample sizes. A Mantel test was carried out using the Isolation by Distance Web Service [88] to test for correlations
between spatial and genetic (Fst) distances [89], also using
gene flow M calculated as (1/FST-1)/4 [26]. The significance of the slope of the reduced major axis (RMA) regression was assessed by 30,000 randomizations.
Because of the acknowledged difficulties of using FST's to
estimate gene flow [90], we also took a coalescent-based
approach to estimate the parameters of populations [91],
such as theta (θ = 4Ne μ; where Ne is the effective number
of individuals and μ is the mutation rate in mutations per
generation), migration rates (M), and the number of effective migrants per generation (Nem). We used the coalescent-based Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method
implemented in MIGRATE 2.1.7, which explicitly takes
into account historical processes and asymmetrical migration/gene flow [91]. The parallelized version of MIGRATE
was compiled to run on the LINUX-cluster of the GWDG
(see above), requesting several processors for each run
depending on the numbers of replicates. Several independent runs were conducted to check for convergence,
the consistency of results, and the shape of posterior distributions. The Bayesian search strategy was optimized for
the following settings (parm files available on request):
recorded genealogies [a]: 100,000; increment (record
every x genealogy [b]: 500; and the number of concurrent
chains [c]: 4, resulting in 2*108 visited (sampled) genealogies [a*b*c] with 10,000 discarded trees per chain (burnin). For MIGRATE analyses, each diploid sponge individual was represented by two alleles/sequence types in the
input file, whether it was homozygous or heterozygous.
rDNA sequences showing IGPs were resolved into two
sequence types using the parsimony approach outlined
above, since MIGRATE does not allow ambiguously
(IUPAC) coded nucleotide sites.
Due to the large geographic distances between some populations without intermediate sample localities, (e.g. Red
Sea-Maldives-IWP) and the low sample sizes of some, we
focussed our attention on estimating the migration rates
among populations along the East-Australian coast,
Papua New Guinea, and the southern Pacific only.
