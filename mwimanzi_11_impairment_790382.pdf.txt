Background
Elite controllers (EC) are HIV-1 infected persons who
can spontaneously control viremia to extremely low
levels. Because it is known that nef is required for HIV1 replication and pathogenesis in vivo, we wish to clarify
how HIV-1 nef plays a role in acquiring EC phenotype.
Materials and methods
Viral RNAs were extracted from plasma samples of 45
ECs and 48 chronic progressors (CP) and used for
amplification of nef by RT-PCR. The amplified products
were cloned into a plasmid and subsequently sequenced.
A representative nef clone was selected for each patient
and cloned into an NL43 proviral plasmid backbone.
Infectious recombinant viruses were prepared by transfecting 293T cells with these resultant proviral clones
and tested for their viral replication capacity in PBMCs
obtained from multiple healthy donors. Viral replication
was monitored by measuring the concentration of p24
Gag in the culture supernatant by p24 ELISA every 3
days. The same virus stocks were further tested for their
infectivity using TZM-bl cells.
Results
All nef alleles isolated from EC and CP had intact ORFs.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed no specific lineage or
clustering, suggesting the absence of common genetic
defects in EC-derived nef alleles. All viruses expressing
patient-derived nef showed a wide range of viral replication in PBMC, confirming the importance of nef alleles
in the enhancement of viral replication capacity. The
viruses harboring EC-derived nef replicated and peaked
on Day 12 after infection or even later; whereas the

viruses harboring CP-derived nef peaked on Day 9. Also,
the peak level of p24 values was significantly lower in
the EC-nef viruses than in the CP-nef viruses. Because
Nef activity is highly dependent on PBMC donors, we
tested 4 different donors’ PBMC and compared the
initial burst of their viral replication at Day 9. In all
donors’PBMC, viruses carrying EC-nef displayed lower
p24 values than those carrying CP-nef, suggesting that
the viral replication capacity was much impaired by nef
alleles in EC. Corroboratively, in viral infectivity assay in
TZM-bl cells, the EC-nef viruses showed significantly
lower infectivity than the CP-nef viruses.

Conclusion
Taken together, our data indicate that nef alleles present
in circulating plasma viruses in EC are much impaired
in boosting viral replication, suggesting that such phenotypic alterations in Nef function play a role, at least
partly, in the sustained maintenance of low viral load in
vivo.
