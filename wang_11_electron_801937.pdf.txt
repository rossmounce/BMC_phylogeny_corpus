Electron transport in acetate-grown
Methanosarcina acetivorans
Mingyu Wang1, Jean-Francois Tomb2 and James G Ferry1*

Abstract
Background: Acetate is the major source of methane in nature. The majority of investigations have focused on
acetotrophic methanogens for which energy-conserving electron transport is dependent on the production and
consumption of H2 as an intermediate, although the great majority of acetotrophs are unable to metabolize H2.
The presence of cytochrome c and a complex (Ma-Rnf) homologous to the Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation)
complexes distributed in the domain Bacteria distinguishes non-H2-utilizing Methanosarcina acetivorans from H2utilizing species suggesting fundamentally different electron transport pathways. Thus, the membrane-bound
electron transport chain of acetate-grown M. acetivorans was investigated to advance a more complete
understanding of acetotrophic methanogens.
Results: A component of the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CdhAE) was partially purified and shown to
reduce a ferredoxin purified using an assay coupling reduction of the ferredoxin to oxidation of CdhAE. Mass
spectrometry analysis of the ferredoxin identified the encoding gene among annotations for nine ferredoxins
encoded in the genome. Reduction of purified membranes from acetate-grown cells with ferredoxin lead to
reduction of membrane-associated multi-heme cytochrome c that was re-oxidized by the addition of either the
heterodisulfide of coenzyme M and coenzyme B (CoM-S-S-CoB) or 2-hydoxyphenazine, the soluble analog of
methanophenazine (MP). Reduced 2-hydoxyphenazine was re-oxidized by membranes that was dependent on
addition of CoM-S-S-CoB. A genomic analysis of Methanosarcina thermophila, a non-H2-utilizing acetotrophic
methanogen, identified genes homologous to cytochrome c and the Ma-Rnf complex of M. acetivorans.
Conclusions: The results support roles for ferredoxin, cytochrome c and MP in the energy-conserving electron
transport pathway of non-H2-utilizing acetotrophic methanogens. This is the first report of involvement of a
cytochrome c in acetotrophic methanogenesis. The results suggest that diverse acetotrophic Methanosarcina
species have evolved diverse membrane-bound electron transport pathways leading from ferredoxin and
culminating with MP donating electrons to the heterodisulfide reductase (HdrDE) for reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB.

Background
The decomposition of complex organic matter to
methane (biomethanation) in diverse anaerobic habitats
of Earth’s biosphere involves an anaerobic microbial
food chain comprised of distinct metabolic groups, the
first of which metabolizes the complex organic matter
primarily to acetate and also formate or H 2 that are
growth substrates for two distinct methane-producing
groups (methanogens) [1]. The methyl group of acetate

contributes most of the methane produced in the biomethanation process via the aceticlastic pathway
whereas the remainder originates primarily from the
reduction of CO2 with electrons derived from the oxidation of formate or H 2 in the CO 2 -reduction pathway
[2,3]. Smaller, albeit significant, amounts of methane
derive from the methyl groups of methanol, methylamines and dimethylsulfide [1].
Only two genera of aceticlastic methanogens have
been described, Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta [2].
In both genera, the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA complex (Cdh) cleaves activated acetate into methyl and carbonyl groups. The methyl group is transferred to
coenzyme M (HS-CoM) producing CH3-S-CoM that is

reductively demethylated to methane with electrons
donated by coenzyme B (HS-CoB). The heterodisulfide
CoM-S-S-CoB is a product of the demethylation reaction that is reduced to the sulfhydryl forms of the cofactors by heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr). The proton
gradient driving ATP synthesis is generated via a membrane-bound electron transport chain originating with
oxidation of the carbonyl group of acetate by Cdh and
terminating with reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB by Hdr.
Although the pathway of carbon flow from the methyl
group of acetate to methane is understood for both
aceticlastic genera, the understanding of electron transport coupled to generation of the proton gradient is
incomplete. The majority of investigations have focused
on Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanosarcina mazei
for which electron transport is dependent on the production and consumption of H 2 as an intermediate,
although the great majority of Methanosarcina species
[4] and all Methanosaeta species are unable to metabolize H2.
In the H2-metabolizing Methanosarcina species investigated, a ferredoxin accepts electrons from Cdh [5,6]
and donates to a membrane-bound Ech hydrogenase
complex that produces H2 and generates a proton gradient for ATP synthesis [7-9]. A hypothesis has been
advanced wherein H2 is re-oxidized by another membrane-bound hydrogenase (Vho) that transfers electrons
to methanophenazine (MP), a quinone-like electron carrier [9]. In the model, MP donates electrons to the heterodisulfide reductase HdrDE accompanied by
translocation of protons which further contributes to
ATP synthesis.
An electron transport chain has been hypothesized for
the marine isolate Methanosarcina acetivorans, the only
non-H 2 -metabolizing acetotrophic methanogen for
which the genome is sequenced. Although encoding
Cdh, the genome does not encode Ech hydrogenase
[10,11]. Furthermore, in contrast to all H2-utilizing aceticlastic Methanosarcina species investigated [12], acetate-grown M. acetivorans synthesizes a six-subunit
complex (Ma-Rnf) [13] encoded within a co-transcribed
eight-gene (MA0658-0665) cluster with high identity to
membrane-bound Rnf (Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation)
complexes from the domain Bacteria. It is hypothesized
that the Ma-Rnf complex plays an essential role in the
electron transport chain, generating a sodium gradient
that is exchanged for a proton gradient driving ATP
synthesis [13]. Consistent with this idea, it was recently
shown that the six-subunit Rnf complex from Acetobacterium woodii of the domain Bacteria couples electron
transport from reduced ferredoxin to NAD + with the
generation of a sodium gradient [14]. Remarkably, the
Ma-Rnf complex of M. acetivorans is co-transcribed
with a gene (MA0658) encoding a multi-heme

cytochrome c, and another flanking gene (MA0665)
encoding a hypothetical membrane integral protein with
unknown function [13]. Indeed, the cytochrome c was
shown to be synthesized in high levels of acetate-grown
cells where it completely dominates the UV-visible spectrum of the purified membranes and is distinguishable
from b-type cytochromes [13]. Furthermore, it was
recently reported (A. M. Guss and W. W. Metcalf,
unpublished results) that a six-subunit Ma-Rnf/cytochrome c (ΔMA0658-0665) deletion mutant of M. acetivorans fails to grow with acetate [15]. However,
biochemical evidence necessary to support the hypothesized role of cytochrome c has not been forthcoming.
The only other report of cytochromes c in methanogens
is for the H 2 -metabolizing species Methanosarcina
mazei (f. Methanosarcina strain Gö1) grown with
methanol [16].
The freshwater isolate Methanosarcina thermophila is
the only non-H2-metabolizing acetotrophic methanogen
for which electron transport components have been
investigated biochemically [17]. Like H2 -metabolizing
Methanosarcina species, ferredoxin mediates electron
transfer between Cdh and the membrane-bound electron
transport chain in which a cytochrome b participates and
dominates the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of membranes. It is also reported that MP is the electron donor
to HdrDE [18]. Electron carriers other than cytochrome
b that participate between ferredoxin and MP were not
identified. Importantly, no evidence for participation of
Ma-Rnf or cytochrome c was reported. Homologs encoding an Ma-Rnf complex and cytochrome c are absent in
the sequenced genome of Methanosaeta thermophila
suggesting yet another novel electron transport chain
that functions in the conversion of acetate to methane in
this non-H 2 -metabolizing genus [19]. Clearly, diverse
electron transport pathways have evolved in diverse acetotrophic methanogens necessitating biochemical investigations of representative species.
The absence of Ech hydrogenase and the demonstrated presence of the Ma-Rnf complex and cytochrome c that is elevated in acetate- versus methanolgrown cells [13] suggests that electron transport of the
non-H2 -metabolizing marine isolate M. acetivorans is
decidedly dissimilar from the genus Methanosaeta and
H 2 -metabolizing acetotrophic species of the genus
Methanosarcina. However, a biochemical investigation
essential to support the role of electron carriers has not
been reported for M. acetivorans. Here we report evidence indicating roles for ferredoxin, cytochrome c and
MP in electron transport of acetate-grown M. acetivorans. The results underscore the diversity of electron
transport pathways in acetotrophic methanogens and
contribute to a more complete understanding of acetotrophic methanogenesis.

Results
The electron acceptor for the CO dehydrogenase/acetylCoA complex of M. acetivorans

The Cdh from acetate-grown M. acetivorans was purified to ascertain the electron acceptor that initiates electron transport. The Cdh complex purified from the H2metabolizing acetotrophic species Methanosarcina barkeri contains five-subunits (CdhABCDE) [20] of which
the CdhAE component oxidizes CO derived from the
carbonyl group of acetate [21]. The genome of M. acetivorans is annotated with duplicate Cdh gene clusters
[10], each encoding five subunits homologous to the
Cdh subunits of M. barkeri. Previous proteomic analyses
of acetate-grown M. acetivorans identified subunits
CdhA, CdhB and CdhC from one cluster (MA1011-16)
and CdhA, CdhB CdhC and CdhE from the other
(MA3860-65) [22]. The purification was monitored by
following the CO-dependent reduction of methyl viologen. SDS PAGE of the purified enzyme showed bands
with molecular masses of 16 kDa and 85 kDa consistent
with the predicted values for the CdhA and CdhE subunits encoded in the genome. Mass spectrometry of the
protein bands identified the CdhA and CdhE subunits
encoded by both Cdh gene clusters consistent with previous proteomic analyses that indicated up-regulation of
both clusters in acetate- versus methanol-grown cells
[22].
Ferredoxin from acetate-grown cells of M. acetivorans
was purified as described in the Methods section to
determine if it accepts electrons from the partially purified CdhAE components thereby initiating electron
transport. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified ferredoxin detected only one protein identified as the product of MA0431 previously annotated as a 2 × [4Fe-4S]
ferredoxin [23]. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of
the as-purified protein was typical of ferredoxins with
an absorption maximum at 402 nm that decreased upon
reduction with dithionite (Additional file 1, Figure S1).
The genome of M. acetivorans is annotated with nine
genes encoding ferredoxins, a phylogenetic analysis of
which is shown in Additional file 2, Figure S2. The analysis revealed that the product of MA0431 is closely
related to the 2 × [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin purified from
acetate-grown cells of M. thermophila [24-27] and the
ferredoxin up-regulated in acetate- versus methanolgrown M. mazei [28]. These three ferredoxins contain
two CX2CX2CX3CP motifs typical of 2 × [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins and share high identity within a distinct clade
(Additional file 2, Figure S2). Figure 1 shows CO-dependent reduction of the purified M. acetivorans ferredoxin
catalyzed by the CdhAE components purified from M.
acetivorans. These results suggest that ferredoxin isolated initiates the electron transport chain in both M.

Ferredoxin as the electron donor to the membranebound electron transport chain

The finding that ferredoxin is an electron acceptor for
the CdhAE component of the Cdh complex of M. acetivorans raises the question whether it is the direct electron donor to membrane-bound electron carriers or if
other soluble electron carriers are required to mediate
electron transfer between ferredoxin and the membrane.
This question was addressed in a system containing
sucrose gradient-purified membranes and plant ferredoxin-NADPH reductase (FNR) to regenerate reduced
ferredoxin that was purified from acetate-grown cells.
The CO-dependent reduction of ferredoxin with CdhAE
was not used to avoid binding of CO to high spin heme
in cytochrome c and potentially inhibiting membranebound electron transport. The NADPH:CoM-S-S-CoB
oxidoreductase activity was monitored by detecting the
sulfhydryl groups of HS-CoM and HS-CoB (Figure 2).
No significant activity was detected when each component of the reaction mixture was deleted individually
including membranes. The dependence of the activity
on purified membranes and the concentration of ferredoxin purified from acetate-grown M. acetivorans indicated a role for the ferredoxin in the direct transfer of
electrons from CdhAE to the membrane-bound electron
transport chain terminating with reduction of CoM-S-SCoB by heterodisulfide reductase.

Role of cytochrome c in the membrane-bound electron
transport chain

It was previously documented [13] that purified membranes of acetate-grown M. acetivorans contain a multiheme cytochrome c that clearly dominates the UV-visible
spectrum of membranes from acetate-grown M. acetivorans with the major peak centered at 554 nm (Figure 3B).
Absorbance at 554 nm increased on incubation of the
membrane fraction with the reduced ferredoxin regenerating system indicating reduction of cytochrome c that was
dependent on ferredoxin (Figure 3). Addition of CoM-S-SCoB oxidized the reduced cytochrome (Figure 4) indicating
that it is a component of the membrane-bound electron
transport chain terminating with reduction of the heterodisulfide. The re-oxidation was too rapid to determine a rate
and incomplete, albeit greater than 50%. The explanation
for incomplete re-oxidation is unknown, although the
result is nearly identical to that reported for the re-oxidation of cytochromes in the membrane fraction of methanol-grown M. mazei that was rapid and reached 40% reoxidation [16]. This is the first report of cytochrome c
involvement in the conversion of acetate to methane.
Role of methanophenazine in the membrane-bound
electron transport chain

The soluble analog of MP, 2-hydroxyphenazine, has
been used to investigate the role of MP in methanogens

[18,29]. The 2-hydroxyphenazine that was reduced in
the presence of membranes with the CO/CdhAE ferredoxin regenerating system was re-oxidized upon addition of CoM-S-S-CoB (Figure 5) consistent with a
membrane-bound heterodisulfide reductase. The re-oxidation generated a total of 239 μM free thiol groups in
this representative experiment, a result that is in
approximate agreement with the observed oxidation of
106 μM 2-hydroxyphenazine. Assuming a two-electron

The results implicating MP and cytochrome c in the
membrane-bound electron transport chain presents the
possibility of electron transfer between these carriers.
The MP analog 2-hydroxyphenazine re-oxidized cytochrome c when added to membranes of acetate-grown
cells previously reduced with ferredoxin (Figure 6).
These results suggest that MP is either directly or indirectly linked to cytochrome c, a result further supporting
the participation of MP and cytochrome c in the membrane-bound electron transport chain.

methane do not metabolize H2 suggesting they employ
an electron transport pathway distinct from that proposed for the few acetotrophic methanogens in which
H2 is an obligatory intermediate. M. acetivorans is the
ideal candidate to represent the majority of acetotrophic
Methanosarcina species by virtue of its sequenced genome and published proteomic analyses leading to the
hypothesis of a novel electron transport pathway for
acetotrophic methanogens incapable of metabolizing H2.
This, the first biochemical investigation of electron
transport in M. acetivorans, has established roles for
electron carriers that reveal both commonalities and differences in electron transport pathways of diverse acetotrophic Methanosarcina species.
Figure 7 compares the current understanding of electron transport for acetate-grown M. acetivorans with
that for H2-metabolizing acetotrophic Methanosarcina
species. In both pathways, the five-subunit CdhABCDE
complex (not shown) cleaves the C-C and C-S bonds of
acetyl-CoA releasing a methyl group and CO that is oxidized to CO2 with electrons transferred to ferredoxin.
The CdhAE component of M. acetivorans was isolated
independently from the other subunits and both copies
encoded in the genome were represented. Although it
was not possible to determine which CdhAE component
reduced ferredoxin, the high percent identities (CdhA,
MA1016 vs. MA3860 = 84% and CdhE, MA1015 vs.
MA3861 = 82%) suggests it is the electron acceptor for

Page 6 of 10

either or both copies. In both pathways, ferredoxin is
the electron donor to a membrane-bound electron
transport chain that terminates with MP donating electrons to the heterodisulfide reductase HdrDE that catalyzes the reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM. Proteomic and
genetic evidence [15,22] indicates that HdrDE functions
in acetate-grown M. acetivorans. MP is the direct electron donor to HdrDE in acetate-grown cells of H2-metabolizing Methanosarcina species and the non-H 2 metabolizing M. thermophila [18]. Thus, it is reasonable
to postulate that MP is also the direct electron donor to
HdrDE of M. acetivorans. However, the electron transport pathways of H2-metabolizing and non-H2-metabolizing species diverge significantly in electron transfer
between ferredoxin and MP. In H2-metabolizing species,
ferredoxin donates electrons to the membrane-bound
Ech hydrogenase. A H2 cycling mechanism is postulated
in which the H2 generated by Ech hydrogenase is re-oxidized by the MP-reducing Vho-type hydrogenase further
contributing to the proton gradient [8]. Although the
genome of M. acetivorans contains homologs of genes
encoding Vho-type hydrogenases they are not expressed
during growth with acetate [4], a result consistent with
the absence of Ech hydrogenase and inability to metabolize H2. Instead, the results reported here support a role
for cytochrome c mediating electron transport between
ferredoxin and MP, although the identities of the direct
electron donor and acceptor for cytochrome c remain

unknown. The membrane location of cytochrome c is
unknown; however, if on the outer aspect as for multiheme cytochromes c in the domain Bacteria, ferredoxin
would be an unlikely electron donor. The most probable
electron donor to cytochrome c is the Ma-Rnf complex
that is also hypothesized to accept electrons from ferredoxin in analogy to homologous Rnf complexes from
the domain Bacteria [13,30]. In the absence of biochemical evidence, the proposed role for Ma-Rnf in electron
transport is at least consistent with up-regulation in
acetate vs. methanol-grown cells and the reported failure
of an Ma-Rnf-cytochrome c deletion mutant (ΔMA06580665) of M. acetivorans to grow with acetate [15]. The
proposed interaction of Ma-Rnf with cytochrome c is
supported by co-transcription of the encoding genes and
up-regulation in acetate- vs. methanol-grown cells [13].
A role for cytochrome c in the electron transport chain
is also supported by results showing re-oxidation of
cytochrome c upon addition of the MP analog 2-hydroxyphenazine to ferredoxin-reduced membranes,
although an unknown carrier mediating electron transfer
between cytochrome c and MP cannot be ruled out.
It was recently shown that the Rnf complex from A.
woodii translocates sodium ions coupled to electron
transfer from ferredoxin to NAD+ [14]. In view of the
potential sodium ion pumping function of Ma-Rnf, it is
interesting to note that a multi-subunit sodium/proton
antiporter (Mrp) is up-regulated in acetate-grown M.
acetivorans and that the encoding genes are absent in
H2-metabolizing Methanosarcina species [13]. Thus, it
is tempting to speculate that Ma-Rnf generates a sodium
gradient (high outside) that is exchanged for a proton
gradient by Mrp. The only other coupling site is the
reduction and oxidation of MP generating a proton gradient as proposed for H2-metabolizing Methanosarcina
species (Figure 7). The role of a proton gradient driving
ATP synthesis is consistent with the presence of a proton translocating ATP synthase in acetate-grown cells
[13] recently shown to be the primary ATP synthase
[31].
The available evidence indicates that the non-H 2 metabolizing freshwater isolate M. thermophila also utilizes ferredoxin as electron donor to a membrane-bound
electron transport chain involving cytochrome b and
culminating with MP donating electrons to HdrDE
[17,18,32]; however, a role for cytochrome c is not evident and other electron carriers have not been reported.
Thus, based on current evidence, it appears that all acetotrophic Methanosarcina species have in common ferredoxin as electron donor to a membrane-bound electron
transport chain terminating with MP donating electrons
to HdrDE, although differ widely in membrane components transferring electrons from ferredoxin to MP. The
evidence for involvement of HdrDE in acetate-grown

Page 7 of 10

cells is convincing; however, genes (MA2868, MA4236
and MA4237) homologous to those encoding the soluble HdrABC heterodisulfide reductase of CO2-reducing
methanogens were shown to be up regulated in acetateversus methanol-grown M. acetivorans [33]. This result
is consistent with the previously reported increased
abundance of HdrA encoded by MA2868 in acetateversus methanol-grown M. acetivorans [22] which opens
the possibility that the electron transport chain may terminate with both the membrane HdrDE or a soluble
HdrABC heterodisulfide reductase.
Of the nine putative 2 × [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins annotated for the genome of M. acetivorans, only the ferredoxin encoded by MA0431 was purified from acetategrown cells. While it cannot be ruled out that other ferredoxins are synthesized in acetate-grown cells, the
results suggest that the ferredoxin encoded by MA0431
is at least dominant in acetate-grown cells. Of the nine
putative 2 × [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins, the one purified from
M. acetivorans is most closely related to that isolated
from acetate-grown M. thermophila [26], a result suggesting it is the preferred electron acceptor of CdhAE in
acetate-grown Methanosarcina species.
Interestingly, genes encoding subunits of Ma-Rnf or
Ech hydrogenase are absent in the genome of the acetate-utilizing isolate Methanosaeta thermophila [19] that
is also incapable of metabolizing H 2 suggesting still
other alternative electron transport pathways coupled to
generation of ion gradients driving ATP synthesis in
acetate-utilizing methanogens. The physiological significance of these diverse electron transport pathways is yet
to be determined; however, it has been suggested that
avoiding H 2 is advantageous to the marine isolate M.
acetivorans since sulfate reducing species that dominate
this environment outcompete methanogens for H 2
potentially disrupting electron transport [13]. It is
important to note here that although M. acetivorans is
incapable of growth with H2 /CO2 it synthesizes all of
the enzymes necessary for reduction of CO2 to methane
and is capable of robust growth via the CO2-reduction
pathway albeit with electrons derived from the oxidation

M. thermophila is an acetotrophic Methanosarcina species incapable of metabolizing H 2 [37,38]. Analysis of
the genomic sequence revealed a gene cluster identical
in arrangement and homologous to genes encoding the
six subunits of Ma-Rnf and multi-heme cytochrome c of
M. acetivorans with deduced sequence identities ranging
from 86 to 98% (Additional file 3, Figure S3A). Alignments of the deduced sequences showed strict conservation of heme-binding, flavin binding and iron-sulfur
binding motifs suggesting conserved functions

Wang et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:165
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/165

(Additional file 3, Figure S3B). Although not conclusive,
these results are consistent with a role for the Ma-Rnf
complex and multi-heme cytochrome c in the electron
transport pathway of M. thermophila grown with acetate. Furthermore, the genome of M. thermophila contains a gene cluster (Additional file 4, Figure S4)
homologous to genes encoding the seven subunits of
the sodium/proton antiporter (Mrp) that is up-regulated
in acetate- versus methanol-grown cells of M. acetivorans and absent in the sequenced genomes of acetotrophic Methanosarcina species capable of metabolizing
H2/CO2 [22,39].

Conclusions
Although the majority of Methanosarcina species are
unable to metabolize H 2 , electron transport has only
been investigated in the few species for which H2 is an
obligatory intermediate. M. acetivorans is proposed to
utilize a fundamentally different electron transport pathway based on bio-informatic, proteomic and genetic
approaches. However, the proposal has not been tested
biochemically. The results indicate roles for ferredoxin,
cytochrome c and MP in support of the proposed electron transport pathway. Further, this is the first report
for involvement of a cytochrome c in acetotrophic
methanogens. The results suggest that diverse acetotrophic Methanosarcina species have evolved diverse
membrane-bound electron transport pathways leading
from ferredoxin and culminating with MP donating
electrons to HdrDE for reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB.
Methods
Materials

CoM-S-S-CoB was a kind gift of Dr. Jan Keltjens. 2hydroxyphenazine was custom synthesized by SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or VWR International (West
Chester, PA). All chromatography columns, resins and
pre-packed columns were purchased from GE Healthcare (Waukesha, WI).
Preparation of cell extract and membranes

M. acetivorans [40] was cultured with acetate as
described previously [41] and the cell paste was frozen
at -80°C. All solutions were O2-free and manipulations
were performed anaerobically in an anaerobic chamber
(Coy Manufacturing, Ann Arbor, MI) containing 95%
N2 and 5% H2. Frozen cells were thawed, re-suspended
(1 g wet weight/ml buffer) in 50 mM MOPS buffer (pH
6.8) containing 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and passed
twice through a French pressure cell at 6.9 × 103 kPa.
The lysate was centrifuged at 7,200 × g for 15 min to
pellet cell debris and unbroken cells. Membranes were
purified from the cell extract using a discontinuous

Page 8 of 10

sucrose gradient comprised of 2 ml 70% sucrose, 4 ml
30% sucrose and 1.5 ml 20% sucrose contained in 50
mM MOPS buffer (pH 6.8). A 2 ml volume of cell
extract was overlaid on the gradient and centrifuged at
200,000 × g for 2 h in a Beckman type 50 Ti rotor. The
brown band containing membranes at the 30% and 70%
sucrose interface was collected and stored at -80°C until
use.
Purification of the aε component (CdhAE) of the CO
dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex

All purification steps and biochemical assays were performed anaerobically in the anaerobic chamber. Crude
cell extract of acetate-grown M. acetivorans was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h to pellet the membrane
fraction. The supernatant solution (200 mg of protein in
10-ml) containing the soluble fraction was loaded onto a
Q-Sepharose FF column (50 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mM MOPS (pH 6.8). The column was
developed with 500 ml of a 0-1.0 M NaCl linear gradient. Each 10 ml fraction was assayed for CO dehydrogenase activity by monitoring the CO-dependent
reduction of methyl viologen as previously described
[42]. The pooled fractions from the peak with the highest specific activity were concentrated 10-fold with a
Vivacell 70 protein concentrator equipped with a 10kDa cut off membrane (Sartorius Group, Göttingen,
Germany). A 1.0 M solution of (NH4)2SO4 contained in
50 mM MOPS (pH 6.8) was added to the concentrated
protein solution to final concentration of 900 mM and
loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose FF (low sub) column
(20-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mM MOPS
(pH 6.8) containing 1.0 M (NH4)2SO4. The column was
developed with 100 ml of a 1.0-0.0 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4
decreasing linear gradient. Fractions from the peak of
CO dehydrogenase activity were pooled and concentrated followed by addition of a volume of 50 mM
MOPS (pH 6.8) to lower the (NH4)2SO4 concentration
to below 100 mM and then loaded on a HiTrap QSepharose HP column (5 ml bed volume) equilibrated
with 50 mM MOPS buffer (pH 6.8). The column was
developed with 50 ml of a 0-1.0 M NaCl linear gradient.
The peak containing CO dehydrogenase activity that
eluted at approximately 0.3 M NaCl was collected and
stored at -80°C until use.
Purification of ferredoxin

All purification steps and biochemical assays were performed anaerobically in the anaerobic chamber. Ferredoxin was assayed by the ability to couple CO oxidation
by CdhAE to the reduction of metronidazole followed
by the decrease in A320 (ε320 = 9300 M-1 cm-1) similar
to that described previously [27]. One unit of activity
was the amount that reduced 1 μmol of metronidazole/

Wang et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:165
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/165

min. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 100 μM
metronidazole and 1-3 μg CdhAE in 50 mM Tris buffer
(pH 8.0) to which 1-10 μl of the column fraction was
added. The reaction was contained in an anaerobic cuvette flushed with 100% CO.
The soluble fraction of cell extract from acetate-grown
M. acetivorans was loaded onto a Q-sepharose FF column
(20 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mM MOPS (pH
6.8) containing 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The column was
developed with 200 ml of a 0-1.0 M linear NaCl gradient.
The fraction with the highest activity was then diluted 10fold with 50 mM MOPS (pH 6.8) containing 10% (v/v)
ethylene glycol. The solution was loaded on a Mono Q column (1.7 ml bed volume) to which 10 ml of a 0-1.0 M
NaCl linear gradient was applied. The fraction containing
ferredoxin that eluted at 600 mM NaCl was loaded on a
Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column (100 ml bed volume)
and developed with 50 mM MOPS (pH 6.8) containing
10% (v/v) ethylene glycol and 150 mM NaCl. The peak
containing the purified ferredoxin was concentrated to
A402 > 0.2 with a Vivacell 70 protein concentrator equipped
with a 5-kDa cutoff membrane and stored at -80°C until
use. The protein concentration was estimated by the ratio
of absorbance at 230 and 260 nm as described [43].
Analytical

All protein concentrations except for ferredoxin were
determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay using the
reagent from Thermo Scientific, Inc.. Detection of the
free sulfhydryl groups of CoM-SH and CoB-SH was performed as previously described [17]. The buffer used in
the assay was 25 mM sodium acetate containing 1 mM
DTNB (5,5’-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)). All assays
in this study were performed anaerobically with vacuum
degassed solutions contained in sealed cuvettes with the
indicated atmosphere and at room temperature.
