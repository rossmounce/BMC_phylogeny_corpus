Abstract
Background: Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral human sexually transmitted pathogen and
importantly, contributes to facilitating the spread of HIV. Yet very little is known about its surface and secreted
proteins mediating interactions with, and permitting the invasion and colonisation of, the host mucosa. Initial
annotations of T. vaginalis genome identified a plethora of candidate extracellular proteins.
Results: Data mining of the T. vaginalis genome identified 911 BspA-like entries (TvBspA) sharing TpLRR-like
leucine-rich repeats, which represent the largest gene family encoding potential extracellular proteins for the
pathogen. A broad range of microorganisms encoding BspA-like proteins was identified and these are mainly
known to live on mucosal surfaces, among these T. vaginalis is endowed with the largest gene family. Over 190
TvBspA proteins with inferred transmembrane domains were characterised by a considerable structural diversity
between their TpLRR and other types of repetitive sequences and two subfamilies possessed distinct classic sorting
signal motifs for endocytosis. One TvBspA subfamily also shared a glycine-rich protein domain with proteins from
Clostridium difficile pathogenic strains and C. difficile phages. Consistent with the hypothesis that TvBspA protein
structural diversity implies diverse roles, we demonstrated for several TvBspA genes differential expression at the
transcript level in different growth conditions. Identified variants of repetitive segments between several TvBspA
paralogues and orthologues from two clinical isolates were also consistent with TpLRR and other repetitive
sequences to be functionally important. For one TvBspA protein cell surface expression and antibody responses by
both female and male T. vaginalis infected patients were also demonstrated.
Conclusions: The biased mucosal habitat for microbial species encoding BspA-like proteins, the characterisation of
a vast structural diversity for the TvBspA proteins, differential expression of a subset of TvBspA genes and the
cellular localisation and immunological data for one TvBspA; all point to the importance of the TvBspA proteins to
various aspects of T. vaginalis pathobiology at the host-pathogen interface.

Background
Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protist responsible
for the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted
infection (STI), with an annual estimate of 174 millions
new infections worldwide [1], corresponding to at least
the combined estimates of Chlamydia trachomatis and
Neisseria gonorea infections, and which has, paradoxically, attracted so far relatively little attention from

health agencies worldwide [2,3]. The parasite is capable
of causing severe vaginal, ectocervical, prostatic and urethral inflammations, and is linked with sterility, pelvic
inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes,
postnatal complications and cervical cancers [4-7].
Furthermore T. vaginalis also contributes, along with
other STI, to the HIV pandemic by boosting the efficiency of virus transmission through several possible
mechanisms including induction of inflammatory
response resulting in neutrophils and macrophages
recruitment into urogenital mucosa, compromising the
mucosal barrier through microhaemoragia, increasing

viral load in urogenital mucosa secretions and as a carrier (a Trojan horse) of infective HIV particles [6,8,9].
Hence, T. vaginalis is capable of invading and colonising
the heavily defended host urogenital mucosa from both
sexes, braking through the primary innate defences and
withstanding induced innate and adaptive responses,
about which little is known in relation to T. vaginalis
infections [10]. Notably, T. vaginalis infections are often
considered non-self limiting in females and recent data
even suggest that persistent, undetected infections can
persist even after successful treatments [11].
The pathobiology of T. vaginalis is complex and multifaceted with adhesion to, and alterations of, the various
mucosal landmarks (mucus, epithelial cell barrier, extracellular matrix [ECM], innate and adaptive immune
cells, bacterial microflora) thought to be essential to
initiate and maintain infections [4,12,13]. T. vaginalis
cells are also known to form large cell aggregates (in a
process called swarming or rosetting), which could
represent an important process for pathogenesis [14],
suggesting that specific cell-cell interactions also take
place between cells of the parasite. When the mucosal
tissue is damaged the parasite can bind to host ECM
proteins [15] and during menstruation or parasite
induced microhaemoragia, T. vaginalis also binds to various plasma proteins [4]. Adhesion to host tissue also
induces a cellular differentiation of T. vaginalis into
amoeboid forms [16,17]. Furthermore the parasite endocytoses host proteins (e.g. lactoferrin and laminin)
[4,18], as well as various human viruses [9,19], and phagocytoses the autochthonous mucosal microflora and
various host cells [20,21], including spermatozoids [22];
key cellular processes for nutrient uptake thought to
dependent on specific surface proteins. However, little is
known about the molecular and cellular basis of these
various processes, with the pathogen lipophosphoglycan
(LPG), various adhesions, surface and secreted enzymes
and toxins all thought to be involved, but existing data
are limited when not controversial [12,13,15,23-27]. A
so far unique human receptor for T. vaginalis, galectin1, was only recently identified when investigating the
role of T. vaginalis LPG in binding to ectocervical
epithelial cell lines [24].
An initial gene survey of expressed sequence tags
(EST) identified T. vaginalis cDNA encoding 65 distinct
proteins we named BspA-like (TvBspA) [28], due to
their similarity with the BspA protein from Tannerella
forsythensis [29], and led us to further characterise in
silico one complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding
a potential surface protein TvBspA625 [28]. TvBspA
proteins are characterised by a specific type of leucinerich repeats (LRR), named TpLRR after a membrane
protein from Treponema pallidium [30], shared with
T. forsythensis BspA and Treponema denticola LrrA

proteins [31]. This discovery was particularly appealing
for T. vaginalis because the BspA and LrrA proteins
were shown to be expressed on the bacteria cell surface
and to be involved in the colonisation of the oral
mucosa; BspA binds to ECM protein fibronectin and to
the clotting factor fibrinogen and both BspA and LrrA
stimulate co-aggregation between the two bacteria, and
promote their adhesion to and invasion of epithelial
cells [31-34]. Furthermore, the TpLRR of the
T. forsythensis BspA protein was shown to trigger an
innate immune response by inducing IL-8 secretion in
epithelial cells via toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR1
signalling [35]. The BspA protein was also shown to elicit a strong antibody responses in T. forsythensis
infected patients [29]. Hence, TvBspA proteins could
play similar roles and mediate important interactions
with mucosal features including its microflora and host
cells and proteins. The availability of one T. vaginalis
genome sequence [36], ~70,000 EST from several different growth conditions and 75 distinct TvBspA genes
spotted on microarrays gave us the opportunity to investigate the TvBspA genome complement and perform a
first exploration of their corresponding transcripts to
gain further insight into their potential importance in
host-pathogen interactions. Here, we present an updated
survey of genomes encoding BspA-like proteins and the
first detailed bioinformatic characterisations of TvBspA
genomic distribution and exceptional structural diversity. We demonstrated differential expression at the
transcript level of selected TvBspA genes upon T. vaginalis binding to ECM proteins or exposed to different
iron concentration; and TvBspA625 cell surface expression and host antibody response during infection.
Together these data strongly indicate that TvBspA proteins are likely to play several important and distinct
roles in T. vaginalis pathobiology and provide the fundamental data for future TvBspA genes and proteins
comparison between various T. vaginalis clinical isolates
and to initiate TvBspA proteins detailed functional
characterisation.

Results
The T. vaginalis genome encodes an exceptionally large
putative BspA-like protein family

A combination of different protein Blast searches identified a total of 911 distinct TvBspA candidate proteins in
the T. vaginalis current genome annotation (Table 1;
additional files 1, 2, 3, Table S1, S2, S3). Reciprocal
BlastP searches with each individual candidate TvBspA
confirmed their annotation as BspA-like proteins with
top hits being TvBspA proteins (882 entries) or BspAlike proteins from other taxa (additional file 4, Table
S4). Of these 911 hypothetical proteins, 479 were positive for a TpLRR profile, 655 were positive for the

TpLRR pattern and 699 positive for either (additional
file 1, Table S1). For 212 TvBspA entries their TpLRR
diverged to the extent that they are neither recognized
by the TpLRR profile nor pattern but all recovered
other TvBspA or prokaryotic BspA-like proteins as their
top BlastP hits (additional file 4, Table S4), hence we
defined these as TvBspA entries with divergent TpLRR.
In several cases the divergent TvBspA are clearly related
to subfamily members that are positive for the TpLRR
profile/pattern (additional file 1, Table S1), with some
examples listed in Table 2. These analyses expand by
~250 entries the size of the TvBspA protein family identified based on BlastP searches only [26,36]. Notably, all
identified TvBspA are clearly differentiated from

T. vaginalis proteins with alternative LRR (additional file
5, Table S5 list some examples), none of which where
hit by either the Wu-Blast or the PHI-/PSI-Blast search
that identified the 911 TvBspA entries.
Only one TvBspA gene is annotated to possess two
exons and 98 entries are annotated as pseudogenes due
to stop codons or frame shifts interrupting the inferred
ORF (additional file 1, Table S1). Eight TvBspA putative
proteins do not possess a starting methionine and three
of these are very similar to longer proteins with a starting methionine. There were also 14 TvBspA genes with
some ambiguous sequencing data (with tandem repeats
of N: A, C, G or T). In addition, a total of 17 TvBspA
proteins were derived from ORF that start or end at the

extremity of a scaffold suggesting they represent partial
sequences, two of which have EST support (additional
file 1, Table S1). Hence a total of 137 TvBspA ORF correspond to either mis-annotated, error-containing
sequences, derived from genes with overlooked introns,
pseudogenes, gene fragments, partially sequenced genes,
or have sequencing errors/ambiguities. We focused our
more detailed analyses on TvBspA protein sequences
most likely derived from full-length genes based on
their sequence features, genome context and evidence
for transcription.
To allow comparisons of TvBspA protein sequence
features and to provide estimates of their phylogenetic
relationships, protein alignments and protein subfamilies
were computed. These data were used to rationalise the
vast structural diversity of the TvBspA proteins and
contextualise their genomic organization. Two multi
alignments of TvBspA proteins were generated to allow
their comparisons: (i) all 911 sequences (additional file
6, Figure S1) and (ii) all 193 proteins with transmembrane domains (TMD) and inferred C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (CT, CCT) (additional file 7, Figure S2). The
order of the sequences in the alignment is a reflection
of their relatedness with the most similar sequences
typically being aligned next to each other and the more
divergent sequences overall tend to be aligned last during the alignment estimation and these are located
towards the bottom of the alignment [37] (additional file
1, Table S1). The position of the TvBspA sequences in
the two alignments were contrasted with TvBspA protein subfamilies derived from an alignment-free clustering algorithm designed to deal, to some extent, with
hard to cluster (and align) repeat containing proteins
[38]. A total of 397 subfamilies were identified for the
911 TvBspA (additional file 1, Table S1). In numerous
cases there was a good agreement between the subfamilies membership and their juxtaposed position in the
alignments (additional file 1, Table S1).
Due to the highly repetitive nature of the T. vaginalis
genome the current genome sequence data are fragmented over 17,000 scaffolds [36], consequently it was only
possible to generate a partial picture of the genome
organisation for the TvBspA gene family. The 911
TvBspA candidate genes were scattered over 440 scaffolds (size range 1 kbp to 585 kbp, mean 101.4 kbp),
with 245 scaffolds encoding one TvBspA and 195 scaffolds encoding two or more TvBspA (up to 18 TvBspA,
Table 2) making up the majority and remaining 666
entries. Many TvBspA genes are organised in clusters
either in tandem repeats, or in close proximity to each
other, with the largest cluster made of 17 TvBspA genes
(and five unrelated interspersed genes) over a genomic
segment of 46.5 kbp (Table 2; additional file 8, Figure
S3). Some of the clustered genes encoded proteins

highly similar to each other and are also recovered in
the same protein subfamily and/or were aligned beside
each other in the global (911 TvBspA) alignment (additional file 6, Figure S1; additional file 1, Table S1). Such
patterns suggest local gene duplications generating tandem repeats [39]. We also identified in several cases closely related paralogues (additional file 1, Table S1),
which were encoded by genes present on different scaffolds, reminiscent of ectopic duplications events (Table
2 lists one example)[39].
The extensive size of the TvBspA gene family is currently unparalleled. The combined PHI- and PSI-Blast
searches that recovered 908 T. vaginalis proteins recovered one to 298 BspA-like sequences in 154 additional
RefSeq annotated genomes (Table 1; additional file 2,
Table S2, additional file 3, Table S3 and additional file
9, Table S6). The next largest BspA-like gene families
were found in Entamoeba dispar (298 EdBspA entries)
and Entamoeba histolytica (124 EhBspA entries), the
only other eukaryotic genomes, with T. vaginalis, currently known to encode proteins with TpLRR [26,40]
(Tables 1, additional file 3, Table S3). In contrast, prokaryotes encoded fewer BspA-like genes (one to 19
entries) but their taxonomic diversity was much broader
including five archaeal species and 147 bacterial species/
strains, with the majority of bacterial taxa being members of Firmicutes (70%) or the Bacteroidetes (12%)
(additional file 9, Table S6).
Structural diversity of TvBspA proteins

Although some TvBspA proteins are structurally very
similar to each other, the TvBspA protein family overall
is characterised by important variations in length and
sequence of their TpLRR and other sequence features
when present, including other tandem repeats or low
complexity segments, TMD and CT (Figures 1; Figure 2;
additional file 6, Figure S1; additional file 1, Table S1,
additional file 10, Table S7). The start and end positions
of the TpLRR of each TvBspA proteins were compared
to investigate their length and contextual position with
other sequence features (Figure 1; additional file 1,
Table S1). The TvBspA protein lengths ranged from 58
to 1865 residues (mean 539) with the TpLRR representing overall the major contributor to protein length
(mean 84%) with the TpLRR length correlating well
with protein overall length (Figure 1D, E). For the 193
TvBspA proteins with a TMD and CCT (TMD-CCT)
the contribution of the TpLRR to total protein length is
overall reduced (mean 72%) and more scattered due to
the contribution of the TMD, CT and linker sequences
between the TMD and the TpLRR (TpLRR-TMD linker)
(Figure 1A, E). The TpLRR-TMD linker sequences for
24 TvBspA with TMD-CCT were characterised by additional repetitive or low complexity segments often

Figure 2 Comparison of two TvBspA paralogues in isolate G3 and TvBspA orthologue between isolate G3 and SS-22. The two proteins
TvBspA625 (TVAG_073760) and TvBspA805 (TVAG_154640) have the highest level of identity, 72%, between members of subfamily #13 (see text).
(A) The TvBspA805 protein sequence with the TpLRR (green) and P/NRR (violet) aligned to compare individual repeats and their corresponding
features in TvBspA625. The star indicates the first TpLRR that is part of the BlastP TvBspA625/TvBspA805 alignment (underlined segment) and
that extends up to the C-termini. The inferred TMD is highlighted in yellow. (B) The corresponding TpLRR and P/NRR alignments for TvBspA625.
The number of TpLRR is greater in TvBspA805, whereas the P/NRR is more extensive in TvBspA625. (C) Alignment comparing the C-terminal end
of the TvBspA805 (G3 isolate: 805_G3) and TvBspA625 (G3 isolate: 625_G3, identical to sequence of isolate C-1:NIH, GenBank accession:
AAM51159) proteins with the corresponding partial sequence of TvBsp625 derived from the clinical isolate SS-22 (625_SS-22, GenBank accession
FJ881695). In TvBspA805 every second P/NRR (aligned in A) are underlined whereas for the TvBspA625 proteins every second P/NRR (aligned in
B) are boxed. TvBspA625_SS-22 (7 P/NRR) has five fewer P/NRR compared to TvBspA625_G3 (12 P/NRR). The alignments of repeats were
manually adjusted to maximise identity levels between repeats. Missing sequence data for the sequence from isolate SS-22 are indicated by
question marks. The aligned sequences correspond to the segments between [——] in panels A and B. The sequences of the four peptides
synthesized to generate mouse antisera and used to test antibody response in T. vaginalis infected patients are shaded in grey with differences
highlighted in white (see text).

enriched in proline or serine residues (Figures 1; additional file 10, Table S7; additional file 11, Figure S4). A
few cases of TvBspA proteins were inferred to possess
distinctive domains identified by visual inspection of
their alignments (Figure 1B and see below) or through
an InterProScan search (Figure 1C).
TpLRR containing proteins are thought to be extracellular either as surface exposed or secreted proteins
[26,41]. Notably, T. vaginalis encodes none of the
enzymes required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)anchors synthesis and mediating their anchoring to proteins [36], hence we focused our more detailed sequence
analyses on entries with potential signal peptides (SP),
TMDs or conserved features located towards the
C-terminal end in the absence of evidence for TMD
(Figure 1; additional file 1, Table S1). The 193 entries
with TMD-CCT (additional file 7, Figure S2) have an
inferred membrane topology implying that the entire
TpLRR would be exposed to the extracellular milieu if
these were to be expressed on the cell surface. Of these
193 TvBspA-TMD-CCT entries 35 also had an inferred
SP, defining type I membrane proteins and the 158
entries with no inferred SP defined potential membrane
proteins of type III [42]. Among the 719 TvBspA
proteins that were considered not to possess TMD, 92
had a detectable SP (Figure 1) and several of these also
formed co-aligned subfamilies characterised by
conserved C-termini often ending with hydrophobic
residues and possessing conserved cysteines and other
residues within motifs located ~20-30 residues from the
C-terminus (additional file 6, Figure S1).
To initiate the rationalisation of the potential functional significance of the considerable TvBspA protein
family, we further investigated their structural diversity
and gene expression at the transcript level in different
in vitro culture conditions. Selected TvBspA proteins
with notable sequence features or included in large
subfamilies were also investigated in more details. Our
bioinformatic analyses also included the identification of
repetitive sequences (in addition to the TpLRR) that are
often linked with surface proteins important for hostpathogen interactions in many pathogenic bacteria and
microbial eukaryotes and are directly implicated in
virulence and pathogenicity, including adhesion to host
tissues and immune evasion [43,44].
The first investigated TvBspA protein sequence,
TvBspA625 [28] (Genbank accession AAM51159, corresponding to TVAG_073760 and XP_001321233,
TrichDB and RefSeq accession numbers respectively, see
additional file 1, Table S1 for all 911 accessions numbers) was recovered among the nine sequences of subfamily #13. TvBspA805 (TVAG_154640) (the number
after TvBspA indicates the inferred number of amino
acids) was the most similar to TvBspA625 (72% identity)

Page 8 of 26

when compared to other members of subfamily #13
(range of pairwise identity: 37% to 54%). The two
sequences share a TpLRR-TMD linker segment made of
proline and asparagines-rich repeats (P/NRR) (Figure 2)
and they are encoded on different scaffolds and separated by at least 67 kbp (additional file 1, Table S1) if
not located on different chromosomes. Variations in the
number of TpLRR and the P/NRR between TvBspA625
and TvBspA805 indicate differential contractions and
expansions of these repetitive segments between the two
paralogues (Figure 2). The variations in repetitive
sequences of proteins from microbial pathogens are an
important source of genetic variations between species/
isolate/strains and are thought to correspond to
dynamic adaptive responses in host-pathogen interactions (e.g. [43,44]). Hence we PCR cloned a 3’end segment of the TvBspA625 gene from the clinical isolate
SS-22 [45] that encompasses the P/NRR, TMD and CT
to compare it with the corresponding G3 sequence (Figure 2C). Although the TvBspA625 protein sequences of
isolate G3 and C-1:NIH were identical (Figure 2C) the
amplicon of isolate SS-22 was slightly smaller compared
to the control amplicon obtained from isolate G3 (data
not shown). Sequencing revealed that this difference was
due to a reduced number of ENP [NS]QPG repeats
(12× P/NRR in protein from isolate G3 and C-1:NIH)
with five fewer repeats in isolate SS-22 (7× P/NRR)
(Figure 2C). For reason we currently don’t understand,
several attempts to PCR clone the entire TvBspA625
ORF from strain SS-22 failed using both genomic DNA
and cDNA as template. As the entire TvBspA625 ORF
could be amplified and sequenced from isolate G3 genomic DNA in control PCR this suggests differences in the
5’end of the TvBspA625 gene between the two clinical
isolates and together with the differences in P/NRR indicate that this gene readily accumulate changes between
clinical isolates. All members of subfamily #13 did also
co-align in the global TvBspA alignment with one intercalated aligned sequence not included in subfamily #13
(additional file 1, Table S1). Four members of subfamily
#13 possess a TMD-CCT. In addition to TvBspA625
and TvBspA805, TvBspA786 (TVAG_234090) was also
characterised by a PRR in the TpLRR-TMD linker (16
prolines over 49 residues including two NPTPETP
repeats) (additional file 6, Figure S1; additional file 10,
Table S7).
Two highly similar paralogues TvBspA515 and
TvBspA575 (92% identity - TVAG_244780 and
TVAG_244800, respectively, members of subfamily
#384) were characterised by TpLRR-TMD linker
sequences with serine-rich repeats (SRR). The length
variation between the two proteins was essentially
restricted to the SRR (additional file 6, Figure S1; additional file 11, Figure S4) reminiscent of the variation

Noël et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/99

identified between TvBspA625 P/NRR from two clinical
isolates (Figure 2C).
Inspecting the alignment of the 193 TvBspA with
TMD-CCT identified several related sequences (coaligned) based on shared CT sequences. The largest
group was made of 21 sequences sharing related TMDs
and a CTs ending with the pattern [DE]FG and most of
these also possessed the dileucine-like motif DXXXLL
known to function as sorting signals for rapid endocytosis and lysosomal targeting in other eukaryotes [46]
(Figure 3A). The next largest group with a shared
TMD-CCT was made of 15 proteins sharing the motifs
[DE]D [PS]FA and the minimal NPXY-like signal (12
entries) for rapid endocytosis [46] (Figure 3B).
Among the 55 sequences with reduced contribution
of the TpLRR (≤ 55%) to overall protein length (additional file 1, Table S1), 12 were characterised by
distinct glycine-rich domains (GRD) located at the
N-terminus, followed by the TpLRR of various lengths
(Figures 1B; additional file 6, Figure S1; additional file
12, Figure S5). These 12 TvBspA-GRD proteins were
the exclusive members of subfamily #168. Six TvBspAGRD proteins were encoded by two gene clusters
(additional file 1, Tables S1). The 12 TvBspA-GRD
proteins were co-aligned together indicating relatively
recent gene duplication events, which in two cases corresponded to local duplications. BlastP searches with
the GRD domain from the TvBspA-GRD proteins as
query recovered 12 none-Trichomonas sequences in
RefSeq, all annotated as hypothetical proteins and
encoded by a taxonomically very restricted set of only
nine genomes (Table 3; additional file 13, Table S8).
The Blast hit list also included additional T. vaginalis
sequences without TpLRR (additional file 13,
Table S8), these were not further investigated here.
Visual inspection of the GRD alignment indicated that
the different GRDs are likely to be homologous to
each other with conserved positions including residues
beyond the shared glycines (additional file 12, Figure
S5). One TvBspA-GRD member possessed a TMD and
four entries without TMD possessed a potential SP, as
did the protein from Flavobacteirum bacteria (Figures
1B; additional file 12, Figure S5) suggesting that these
could be expressed on the surface or secreted. The
four TvBspA-GRD with an inferred SP corresponded
to proteins with an N-terminal extension that is shared
between a total of nine TvBspA-GRD (eight being very
similar to each other), suggesting that all the sequences
with an extension could possess functional SP with
some currently not recognized as such by SignalP or
PHOBIUS (additional file 12, Figure S5). Three
TvBspA-GRD did not possess such extension, as did
the proteins from C. difficile and the phages (additional file 12, Figure S5).

Evidence for TvBspA genes transcription

To investigate TvBspA genes transcription we explored
three sources of data including EST, semi-quantitative
RT-PCR and microarrays with quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) (additional file 14, Table S9). A total of 270
TvBspA genes (29.6% of all 911 entries) had hits on one
ore more EST, with the majority having only one hit
(57.8%), with approximately the same proportion of
TvBspA without and with TMD (30% and 27% respectively) having EST support indicating that both structural types are transcribed and likely to be functional
(additional file 15, Table S10). Different EST libraries
derived from five different culture conditions were characterised by little redundancy and overlap in terms of
their TvBspA transcripts suggesting differential expression of the TvBspA genes for the compared growth conditions (Figure 4).
A total of 74 different TvBspA cDNA were spotted on
microarrays among a total of 4938 distinct genes and
these were used to contrast transcripts concentration in
T. vaginalis cultures exposed to high and low iron concentration, as iron is an important factor known to
influence the expression level of many genes (at both
transcript and protein level), the virulence, morphology
and growth of the parasite [18,47,48]. A total of 13
TvBspA genes showed significant variation in their
mRNA concentration between the tested conditions
(Table 4) and the remaining 61 entries showed expression but without significant differences between the
tested conditions (data not shown). For three TvBspA
genes the modulations of transcript concentration was
confirmed by qRT-PCR (Table 4).
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was also used to contrast
the mRNA concentration of nine TvBspA genes upon
binding of T. vaginalis cells to ECM proteins, which is
also known to influence the parasite morphology and
gene expression [15,17]. We selected nine TvBspA
genes encoding proteins with TMD based on their
sequence features including TvBspA625 and TvBspA805
(Figure 2) and seven additional entries including two
TvBspA with divergent TpLRR (Figure 5; additional file
11, Figure S4; additional file 16, Table S11). Marked differences of expression patterns were observed among
the analysed genes with one showing no expression in
both tested conditions and five showing an obvious
increase in their mRNA concentration upon binding to
ECM proteins (Figure 5). Notable was the striking difference between the two similar paralogues (Figure 2)
TvBspA625 (TVAG_073760, up-regulated upon binding
to ECM) and TvBspA805 (TVAG_154640, no observable
changes and lower amount of transcript) (Figure 5).
Consistent with these differences in pattern of expression for the tested conditions, marked differences in
the upstream sequences to the TvBspA start codon

Figure 3 Alignment of TvBspA with TMD and similar cytoplasmic tails with potential signal for endocytosis. (A) The 21 identified TvBspA
with similar CT (sequence and length) all ending with the pattern [DE]FG (green). Most sequences possess a motif related to [DE]XXXL [LI] (blue),
a dileucine-based type endocystosis and lysososmal-like sorting signal (see text). Residues replacing [DE] in known functional endocytosis signal
in other species are also shown in blue (see text). (B) The 15 identified TvBspA sequences with a similar TMD (yellow) and CT. Most entries share
the FDNPX[YF] (blue) an NPXY-type endocytosis signal (see text). The five entries that are part of subfamily #228 (bottom five sequences, see text
and Table 2) also share a more similar TMD compared to the other 10 entries. Conserved residues in the TMD differentiating the two sets of
sequences are highlighted in dark blue.

Figure 4 Evidence for differential TvBspA gene expression from EST. (A) EST derived from different growth conditions were scanned for
entries corresponding to TvBspA genes. The total numbers of distinct TvBspA EST (blue bar) or different unique TvBspA genes (orange bar) for a
given condition are indicated. For each condition ~10,000 EST were compared (numbers in brackets). (B) The different libraries are characterised
by little overlap in terms of EST encoding TvBspA with only two TvBspA genes shared between all five compared conditions and most found in
only one library.

could be observed, suggesting different promoters for
each gene potentially mediating differential transcriptional regulation (additional file 1, Table S1). The
majority of TvBspA genes possessed known T. vaginalis core promoter elements including an initiator (Inr)
(735 entries) or TATA-boxes only (17 entries) with
159 genes possessing neither (additional file 1, Table
S1). Interestingly there was no significant difference in

the proportion of TvBspA genes with EST or without
EST among entries positive (41%) or negative (47%)
for Inr/TATA-box suggesting that other core promoter
elements for transcription exist in TvBspA genes. It
will be interesting to investigate promoter sequence
features for TvBspA and other protein coding genes
when global tanscriptomics data will be generated for
T. vaginalis.

Cellular localization of TvBspA625 and its expression
during infection

In order to investigate the expression and cellular localization of one TvBspA-like candidate surface protein
four synthetic peptides were produced derived from the
TvBspA625 sequence (Figure 2C) and used to raise

mouse antisera. Three peptides are likely to generate
antisera specific for TvBspA625 (CT-1, EXT-2 and CT2) whereas the fourth could possibly lead to antibodies
cross-reacting with the paralogues TvBsp805 (EXT-1)
(Figure 2 and see Methods). Western blot analyses on T.
vaginalis total protein extracts with the mouse antisera

Figure 5 Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assessment of TvBspA expression in T. vaginalis bound to ECM proteins. Upon contact to the ECM
proteins T. vaginalis cells strongly bind to the substrate and the majority of cells cannot be washed off after 60 min of incubation. RT-PCR for
nine selected TvBspA-like genes and control actin (no major change) and alpha-actinin (up-regulated) genes was performed on T. vaginalis ECM
proteins bound cells after 60 min of incubation (BC) and control free swiming trophozoites incubated in parallel (T). The shown results are
representative of 6 to 15 independent PCR and at least five independent binding experiments/RNA extractions. TvBspA gene-specific primers
were designed to produce amplicons of different sizes and avoid cross-amplification between TvBspA genes, in particular between the closely
related TvBspA625 (TVAG_073760) and TvBspA805 (TVAG_154640) indicated by a star. A control PCR was also performed on genomic DNA
(gDNA) confirming that the designed primers are efficient in generating the specific amplicons (size are indicated). Actin amplicons are
equivalent for cDNA preparations from both trophozoite and ECM bound cells indicating similar total cDNA load whereas the cDNA specific for
alpha-actinin increases upon T. vaginalis binding to substrate as described [97]. Five TvBspA genes show clear increase in the amount of
amplicons for the ECM bound cells suggesting transcription up-regulation or higher stability of their mRNA in this condition. For TvBspA605 no
amplicon could be detected suggesting that it is not transcribed in either tested conditions. For TvBspA805 the amount of cDNA was doubled
to allow the detection of the shown signal indicating that the mRNA encoding this protein is not as abundant as for the paralogue TvBspA625.

raised against one of the cytoplasmic located peptides
(CT-1) recognized a consistent major protein with an
apparent molecular mass of ~52 kDa for both isolate G3
and SS-22, while all presera did not detect any material
(additional file 17, Figure S6). However, the other antisera did not identify the same material and were often
characterised by more complex banding patterns (G3:
CT-2, EXT-1, EXT-2) or had a distinct major band ~40
kDa (SS-22: EXT-1). Since the pre-sera did not detect
any proteins and the apparent molecular masses of the
proteins detected by the different antisera did not match
the theoretical one for TvBspA625 (nor TvBspA805)
from the G3 isolate (67 kDa) the lower apparent molecular mass could be explained by aberrant gel migration
(sometime observed in proteins with repeats) or represent proteolytic fragments. As we currently don’t know
the corresponding genome sequence for isolate SS-22 it
is difficult to interpret the observed differences between
the two isolates.
Indirect immunofluorescence analyses (IFA) with confocal microscopy demonstrated a clear cell surface localization for the TvBspA625 protein for three out of four
mouse antisera with either ethanol fixed cells (Figure 6)
or formaldehyde fixed cells (additional file 18, Figure
S7). In contrast one antisera (anti-EXT-2) generated a
strong signal over most of many cells, making cellular
localization inference more difficult (additional file 18,
Figure S7). Mouse presera from the corresponding antipeptide antisera generated no signal and both the hydrogenosomal malic enzyme (HME, rabbit polyclonal [49])
and tubulin (mouse monoclonal VG2 [50]) controls had
clear intracellular localizations as expected (Figure 6). In
formaldehyde fixed cells we could also observe an intracellular punctuate labelling, typically at the proximity of
the cell surface, with anti-CT-2 and EXT-1 antisera,
whereas the anti-CT-1 antisera resulted in mainly a cell
surface signal (additional file 18, Figure S7).
To investigate whether the cell surface TvBspA625 protein is expressed during infection we measured the presence of antibody recognizing the four peptides (EXT-1/
2, and CT-1/2) in sera from patients infected by T. vaginalis and contrasted these to control sera from
T. vaginalis negative patients (Table 5). All four peptides
were recognised by similar proportion of patients sera
(no statistical differences in pairwise Pearson uncorrected tests) from tested patients (T. vaginalis infected
vs. non-infected - CT-1: 68% vs. 16%; CT-2: 60% vs.
12%, EXT-1: 78% vs. 18% and EXT-2: 61% vs. 15%) with
85% of these patients recognizing two or more peptides
and 88% at least one peptide (Table 5). Sera from
T. vaginalis positive patients were significantly (female
and male combined: Pearson uncorrected c2 = 105.603,
p < 0.0001; OR: 35.9) more frequently recognizing one
or more peptides in the ELISA assay when compared to

Page 14 of 26

controls patients (Table 5). The pool of T. vaginalis
positive patients was also significantly more frequently
HIV positive compared to the pool of T. vaginalis negative patients (female and male combined: Pearson
uncorrected c2 = 9.380, p = 0.002; OR: 2.6) (Table 5), as
is now well recognised [2,3,6].

Initial analyses of the draft genome sequence of T. vaginalis (isolate G3) identified a plethora of candidate surface/secreted proteins among which the largest family
was made of the TvBspA proteins with over 650 entries
that share a type of LRR [26,36]. Here we describe additional TvBspA candidate proteins further extending the
size of this considerable protein family and the first
detailed analyses of the sequence structural diversity of
all 911 TvBspA candidate proteins. We also investigated
selected TvBspA transcripts from parasites grown in different conditions and provide for one TvBspA protein
the first cellular localisation data as well as identify
sequence variations between clinical isolates and
patients antibody responses during T. vaginalis
infection.
TvBspA gene family tremendous diversity and origins

More comprehensive protein searches of the annotated
T. vaginalis draft genome, made more sensitive and specific by combining pattern and profile based searches
for TpLRR containing proteins, extended the TvBspA
gene family by over 250 to a total of 911 entries. Searching the RefSeq protein database for BspA-like proteins
with the same search strategy identified a taxonomically
divers set of organisms, including two additional eukaryotes (E. dispar and E. histolytica) and a great majority
(82%) of species derived from two major bacterial
lineages, Firmicutes (70%) and Bacteroidetes (12%).
Interestingly, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the most
prevalent taxa identified by gene surveys in the gut of
vertebrates, including humans [51]. Indeed, the great
majority of taxa encoding BspA-like proteins, including
the three eukaryotes, are known to share the capacity to
thrive on mucosal surfaces either as pathogens, commensals or mutualists (79% of taxa in Table 1). These
data clearly reinforced earlier observations, made on a
much more restricted set of sequenced genomes [28],
that BspA-like proteins are preferentially encoded by
mucosal microbes.
This pattern strengthened the hypotheses that lateral
gene transfers (LGT) of BspA-like genes between microorganisms thriving on mucosal surfaces took place [28]
and that BspA-like proteins are involved in important
aspects of microbes-mucosa interactions. Mucosal surfaces; which include the colon, the niche with the highest known density of microbes [52]; harbour a large

processed for IFA (ethanol fixation) with the four mouse antisera raised against the four peptides designed from TvBspA625 sequence (see
Figure 2) and imaging performed with a confocal microscope. Three antisera (EXT-1, CT-1 and CT-2) gave consistent signals on the cell surface
of the parasites whereas EXT-2 often gave strong labelling over most of the cells structures (additional file 18, Figure S7). (A) The mouse antisera
raised against a peptide derived from the TvBspA625 cytoplasmic tail (CT-2, green) gave a clear surface labelling. Co-labelling of the
hydrogenosomal malic enzyme (red) with a specific rabbit antiserum led to the labelling of intracellular structures as expected [49]. Controls
consisted of specific mouse pre-sera or secondary anti-mouse antisera alone (no signal in both cases, data no shown) and a mouse monoclonal
antibody raised against tubulin decorated with same secondary anti-mouse antibody (panel C), clearly demonstrated the specificity of the signal

diversity of cellular microbes (mainly Bacteria but also
Archaea and various microbial eukaryotes) between
which LGT could take place, a mechanism thought to
contribute to adaptations to a mucosal life style
[26,52,53]. As the taxonomic diversity of genomes
encoding BspA-like proteins is higher among prokaryotes we suggest that the only three eukaryotes (T. vaginalis and two Entamoeba species) currently known to
encode BspA-like proteins acquired the corresponding
genes from prokaryotic donors, likely bacterial species.
The three TvBspA proteins with the highest level of
sequence identity in BlastP alignments with prokaryotic
proteins are with the Firmicute Eubacterium siraeum
(TVAG_495790, 57% identity and TVAG_057870, 56%
identity) and the Bacteroidetes Tannerella forsythia
(TVAG_225790, 52% identity) (additional file 4, Table
S4). Interestingly a bias was observed among candidate
LGT genes identified in T. vaginalis with Firmicutes and
Bacteroridetes being the most common identifiable candidate donors as supported by detailed phylogenetics
(with proteins that lead to reliable alignments, without
repeats) [36,54]. The extensive eukaryotic BspA-like
gene families (911 in T. vaginalis, 298 in E. dipsar and
124 in E. histolytica), compared with the much
restricted gene families found in prokaryotes (1-19
entries per genome) could be explained by one or a few
LGT acquisitions from prokaryotic donors followed by
large numbers of gene duplication events within the
eukaryotic genomes, so called “conservative” gene duplications that are thought (along with LGT) to contribute
to an organism adaptations to its environment [55].
Alternatively, the larger gene families observed in eukaryotes could be explained by several LGTs followed by
less dramatic sets of gene duplication events. We favour
the former hypothesis as few eukaryotic BspA-like

entries show higher scores with their prokaryotic counterparts (only 15 TvBspA had prokaryotic proteins as
top hits from nine different Bacteria and one Archaea)
with the great majority (93%) of individual TvBspA protein recovering as top BlastP hits other TvBspA (additional file 4, Table S4). Trichomonas sequences are also
rather distinct from the Entamoeba sequences both in
terms of their TpLRR and overall structural organisation,
consistent with independent gene acquisition and amelioration (functional integration) programs - only 19 TvBspA
proteins have Entamoeba entries (one EhBspA and 18
EdBspA) as top Blast hit (additional file 4, Table S4).
Contrasting TvBspA gene positions on scaffolds with a
TvBspA global alignment and subfamily composition (as
surrogate to phylogeny) of the corresponding proteins
indicated that both tandem and ectopic gene duplications events took place, as discussed for the large disease
resistance gene family encoding proteins with LRR in
plants [39]. The largest gene cluster made of 17 TvBspA
genes was generated by a combination of a few ectopic
and several tandem duplication events. More detailed
information on the genome distribution of the TvBspA
genes, for instance their potential locations in subtelomeric regions as known for important surface variant
proteins in other pathogenic microbial eukaryotes [56],
will await more extensive clustering of the >17,000 scaffolds and their mapping onto chromosomes [36,57].
TvBspA protein structural diversity

Following gene duplications, TvBspA paralogues differentiated dramatically. This diversity was identified in
both the sequence and number of the TpLRR with
extensive overall length variation between TvBspA proteins from less then 100 to over 1800 residues. The
compression and/or extensions of the TpLRR segments

Noël et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/99

contributed to most of the observed length diversity but
variation of other type of sequences are also involved
including non-LRR repeats, TMD and CT, indicating an
evolutionary highly dynamic gene family and suggesting
that these proteins play several distinct functions. As
TvBspA proteins are characterised by TpLRR typically
present on extracellular proteins in other taxa [41], and
additional repeats are also present in several cases, they
are potentially involved in various aspects of host-pathogen interactions as shown for many repeat containing
proteins including LRR [43,44,53,58,59]. A total of 193
TvBspA were inferred to possess TMD and CCT, supporting the hypothesis that the N-terminal ends of the
proteins, including the TpLRR, face the extracellular
milieu if expressed on the cell surface. Potential SPs
were also detected for TvBspA with and without TMD.
For proteins without TMD and with SP this suggests
that these could be secreted or bound to the cell surface
with unknown anchors - as there are no GPI-anchors in
T. vaginalis [36]. Notably the current complete absence
of experimental data for T. vaginalis SP probably contributes to underestimating the number of SP positive
TvBspA entries in silico as SignalP3.0 and PHOBIUS
were trained with a restricted diversity of eukaryotes
[60,61]. Entries genuinely without SP and TMD could
be secreted or anchored to the cell surface through
unknown mechanisms or could represent non-functional
proteins, perhaps corresponding to pseudogenes,
although EST suggest that all types of TvBspA proteins
are transcribed and could be functional. Several TvBspA
without TMD (with and without detected SP) were also
characterised by conserved C-terminal ends, including
motifs with conserved cysteines and other residues and
in some cases were ending with hydrophobic residues.
Such conserved C-terminal motifs could be implicated
in anchoring TvBspA proteins via unknown lipids (as
GPI-anchor do not exist in T. vaginalis). Such motifs
included the sequences [TS]CK in members of subfamilies #20, 22, 24, 33, 34 and 35, SCHIA for some members of subfamilies #44 and 45 or TCQCR in subfamily
#26 (additional file 1, Table S1; additional file 6, Figure
S1). These TvBspA C-termini could be modified by
hypothetical and ‘atypical’ lipid anchors for a eukaryotic
surface exposed protein, as shown, or hypothesized, for
some surface proteins from E. histolytica [62] including
EhBspA proteins [40]. In the case of several EhBspA,
the cysteine of a C-terminal CAAX motif (cysteine followed by two aliphatic residues and any terminal residue
[63]) could be implicated and one CAAX containing
EhBspA protein was indeed demonstrated to be
expressed on the cell surface [40]. None of the TvBspA
possessed a C-terminal CAAX box.
The important sequence variation observed between
the TvBspA paralogues contrast dramatically with the

Page 17 of 26

high level of sequence conservation observed among
copies of the highly repetitive genes made of virus-like,
transposable elements (TE) and unclassified gene
families, with a 2.4% average pairwise difference for an
average gene copy number of 660, identified in T. vaginalis G3 genome (listed in Table two in Carlton et al.
[36]). This suggests that the TvBspA genes are under
some level of positive selective pressure whereas the
virus-like, TE and unclassified highly repetitive genes
families are evolving neutrally, as would be expected for
proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions (potentially TvBspA) and selfish genes, respectively. It will be
of great interest to contrast the level of selection pressure (neutral, positive or negative selection using ω =
dN/dS - nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate
ratio tests) on TvBspA genes and contrast these with
other genes across several T. vaginalis isolate and one
or more closely related species - required to generate
DNA alignments of ORF to calculate ω values, the more
sequences the better for tests measuring selection - e.g.
[64].
One TvBspA subfamily was characterised by a shared
N-terminal GRD followed by the TpLRR. BlastP
searches with the GRD from TvBspA-GRD identified
hypothetical proteins encoded by a very restricted set of
genomes including T. vaginalis, Flavobacteria bacterium, four strains of Clostridium difficile, two C. difficile
phages and Bacillus cereus. These data defined a new
protein domain of unknown function that is shared
between proteins with distinct C-termini currently
encoded by few and distantly related taxa, T. vaginalis
(a eukaryote), F. bacterium (Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi), C.
difficile and B. cereus (both Firmicute), and two C. difficile phages, with all cellular organisms sharing the capacity to be potentially pathogenic to human mucosa.
Clostridium difficile is the most common source of
nosocomial diarrhea [65] and F. bacterium and B. cereus
are commonly found in soil and water systems with B.
cereus being a common opportunistic pathogen also
causing pathologies in the digestive tract [66]. Members
of the Flavobacteria are often pathogens (e.g. Flavobacteria psychrophilum, a virulent fish pathogen listed in
Table 1) or opportunistic pathogens, including in
humans [67]. This highly restricted and biased taxonomic distribution among specialised mucosal pathogens and potential opportunist mucosal pathogens is
intriguing. In addition many prophages encode toxins
and other virulent factors in pathogenic bacteria [53]
and the phage GRD containing protein (ORF 30 in
phage PhiCD119 [68]) is located beside of the holin protein, which is part of the cell lysis casset, and that corresponds to one of the preferential locations of toxins
encoded by lambda-like prophages as know for the
shiga toxin in subsets of E. coli strains [69]. Indeed, the

Noël et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/99

two GRD containg proteins in the complete genome of
C. difficile 630 are encoded by genes (CD0967 and
CD2397) with the same location (as in phage
PhiCD119) within the two highly conserved prophages
identified during annotation[65]. Holin is also homologous to the TcdE gene of the C. difficile pathogenicity
locus harbouring the five genes tcdABCDE that is
known to regulate the expression of the C. difficile toxins tcdA and tcdB [65]. Taken together, these different
considerations suggest that proteins containing the
newly identified GRD could be involved in some aspects
of T. vaginalis-host interactions possibly by contributing
to damaging bacteria of the vaginal microflora or
human cells. It will be of interest to directly test this
hypothesis experimentally with both T. vaginalis and
C. difficile GRD-containing proteins.
Among relatively recently duplicated TvBspA genes
(paralogues encoding proteins with high level of protein sequence identity, >70%, 198 pairs of paralogues additional file 4, Table S4) we identified cases where
paralogues accumulated differences in both the number of TpLRR and/or other repetitive sequences as
often observed for proteins known to be involved in
host-pathogen interactions [43,44,53]. Such variations
in repetitive segments were also identified between
TvBspA625 from two clinical isolates, with isolate SS22 possessing a shorter P/NRR in the TpLRR-TMD
linker sequence when compared to TvBspA625 from
isolate G3. The incapacity to PCR clone the entire
TvBspA625 ORF from isolate SS-22 also suggested variations at the 5’end of the gene corresponding to the
TpLRR domain. Western blot analyses did detect the
same major band with the anti-CT-1 antisera but identified some differences with the other antisera (CT-2,
EXT-1/2) and sequencing of the full TvBspA625 holomologue of isolate SS-22 will be required to try to
rationalise these results. Taken together these data
demonstrated that TvBspA paralogues within a given
genome and orthologues between clinical isolates readily accumulate changes in repetitive sequences as
would be expected for proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions and possibly under selection pressures
such as in the case of host immune responses directed
against them [43,44,53,56]. In addition variations in
repetitive sequence of surface proteins can also lead to
important quantitative alterations of their functions,
such as variation of adhesion properties to substrates
as in cell-cell adhesions during parasite swarming (possibly induced by TvBspA-TvBspA interactions) with
dramatic cases described in yeast involving surface
proteins with different type of tandem repeats [70,71].
Variants in TpLRR could also lead to different functions altogether (such as binding to different substrates), and possibly contribute to rapid adaptations to

Page 18 of 26

environmental changes (as for example between the
male and female urogential tracts or between the various mucosal landmarks) as known, or suggested, for
different parasitic and other microbial eukaryotes
[43,44,71,72]. It will be particularly interesting to compare in the future the extent of global variations of
TvBspA TpLRR and non-LRR repeats between various
clinical isolates to gain a better insight into their
potential roles in evading host immune response and
possible link between T. vaginalis genetic diversity and
virulence [26]. As such, TvBspA-like genes could
represent valuable markers for epidemiological studies
to type clinical isolates [26].
Another interesting aspect of the diversity among
TvBspA proteins with TMD was identified in two subfamilies with conserved CT. Each subfamily was characterised with a classic sorting signals in their CT with one
possessing a di-leucine-like signal and the other an
NPXY-like signal, both known to mediate rapid endocytosis in other eukaryotes [46]. In both cases the sequence
and their position in the cytoplasmic tails suggested that
these are functional [46]. The NPXY containing
sequences in particular were characterised by flanking
sequences FDNP [LIF]F (similar to FDNPVY of the
human LDL receptors where the important tyrosine can
be replace by a phenylalanine) known to form potent signals for endocytosis further supporting their functionality
[46]. Hence these TvBspA proteins could represent
receptors mediating endocytosis of various host (or
others) proteins with their TpLRR likely involved in
binding to ligands. These TvBspA proteins represent to
our knowledge the first candidate receptor potentially
mediating endocytosis of various host or other proteins.
Some TvBspA genes are potential pseudogenes with 98
entries currently being annotated as such as they possess
ORF disrupting sequence features. In addition, other
TvBspA sequences have sequencing ambiguities or are
obviously truncated due to sequencing problems or missing data. However, very little is currently known about
the structure-function relationship for TvBspA proteins
and some of these annotated pseudogenes could actually
correspond to functional genes such as TVAG_191490,
which correspond to a C-terminal truncated form compared to a longer TvBspA-GRD. Hence some ‘pseudogenes’ could actually encode functional proteins (a
shorter one in the case of TVAG_191490 when compared to close paralogues) or correspond to a reservoir
used to generate TvBspA diversity through recombination or other processes facilitating the creation of new
functional genes distinct from existing ones [73].
Evidence for expression

For a total of over 270 TvBspA entries (~30% of all 911
TvBspA genes) we obtained evidence for transcription

Noël et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/99

through EST, RT-PCR and microarray analyses. Differential expression was suggested from EST surveys and
demonstrated for a subset of genes by microarray and
RT-PCR analyses for two conditions, change in iron
concentration and binding of parasite to ECM proteins,
consistent with different functions for the analysed
TvBspA. Due to the large gene family size a global
approach based on microarrays designed to cover all
911 TvBspA genes combined with testing key stages of
T. vaginalis infections of the urogenital tract of both
sexes will be required in the future to gain further
insight into the functional relevance of the vast TvBspA
gene family. The microarray data presented here indicate that this approach will be an important one to contrast transcripts abundance.
The use of antisera directed against peptide derived
from the TvBspA625 sequence demonstrated by IFA
the expression of the proteins and its cell surface location, consistent with the bioinformatics analyses, indicating that the TpLRR and the P/NRR of TvBspA625
are exposed to extracellular milieu where they could
mediate binding to host or other proteins as demonstrated for the bacterial proteins BspA and LrrA
[29,31,33].
The same peptides used to raise the mouse antiTvBspA625 antisera were also used in ELISA assays to
test the presence of antibodies recognizing TvBspA625
from clinical patients. Our data strongly suggest that this
protein is indeed expressed and triggers antibody
responses in both sexes during the majority of tested
T. vaginalis infections. Variations of the length of the
P/NRR of TvBspA625 also suggested that the protein is
under selective pressure possibly due to the immune
response it stimulates. Contrasting the TvBspA625
sequences and their expression (along with all other
TvBspA) between additional T. vaginalis clinical isolates
from patients with and without an antibody response to
this protein would be particularly interesting to further
test this possibility. The patients without detected antibodies directed against TvBspA625 (~12% of T. vaginalis
investigated patients) could correspond to T. vaginalis
isolates that don’t express that protein at all or with differences in the epitopes tested here. From these different
considerations, we predict that differential expression of
TvBspA gene sets combined with differences in the
TpLRR and other repeats between TvBspA proteins will
be identified between different clinical isolates.
Finally TvBspA could play important roles in regulating the innate immune responses in the urogential
tracts, as demonstrated in vitro for T. vaginalis total cell
surface proteins [74], since the BspA protein from
T. forsythia was shown to regulate in a CD4 and TLR2
dependent manner cytokine induction [75]. The TpLRR

Page 19 of 26

of some TvBspA could be directly involved in binding
the LRR of TLRs and induce specific innate response
signalling.

Conclusions
Considering the phenotypes of organisms encoding
BspA-like proteins, the majority being pathogens, commensal or mutualists thriving on vertebrate mucosal
surfaces; the established function of BspA-like proteins
in the pathogenicity of two mouth mucosal bacteria
(T. forsythia and T. denticola); the extraordinarily large
TvBspA protein family size with its vast structural diversity, the differential expression patterns demonstrated
for some TvBspA genes and the cell surface expression
and induction of an antibody response during infections
for one TvBspA protein; together strongly suggest that
the TvBspA proteins play various and important roles in
T. vaginalis’ pathobiology by contributing to the invasion and long term infections of the human urogenital
tract. TvBspA-like proteins represent strong candidate
surface proteins mediating interaction with various
mucosal landmarks including the mucus; VEC, urethra
epithelial cell and other host cells; ECM proteins and
vaginal microflora or cell-cell adhesion during parasite
swarming. TvBspA could also mediate endocytosis of
various host proteins and viruses, as well as underpin
phagocytosis of bacteria and various host cells. Finally
TvBspA proteins could orchestrate the modulation of
the innate immune system through TLRs signalling during infection and mediate immune evasion through differential expression.
Methods
Genome data mining and other bioinformatic analyses

A Wu-BlastP (expectation value ≤ 0.001) search at
TrichDB [76] with the TpLRR of TvBspA625 as query
(TVAG_073760, XP_001321233, positions 1-420, [28])
identified 885 TvBspA candidate proteins. A PHI-Blast
[77] (NCBI Blast server, with same query as for the
BlastP, expect threshold ≤ 0.001, with the TpLRR pattern [LIV]xx [LIV]x [LIV]xxx [LIV]xx [LIV]xxxAFxx
[CNST]xx) [30] followed by two iterations of PSI-Blast
searches [78] recovered 908 T. vaginalis annotated proteins in RefSeq (20 August 2008) [79], which included
all but 13 entries of the Wu-BlastP list and 26 additional
sequences, defining a total of 911 distinct TvBspA candidate proteins. We also performed BlastP searched with
all putative TvBspA proteins and investigated their
respective Blast hit lists using SPyPhy to annotate them
and investigate their level of similarity with the proteins
they hit [80].
Profile based searches [81] were also used to investigate the presence of TpLRR. All entries that hit the LRR

Noël et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/99

of BspA-like proteins from other taxa in the BlastP
searches or were positive for the TpLRR Profile search
(TpLRR profile accession: PS50505 http://www.isrec.isbsib.ch/cgi-bin/get_pstprf?PS50505) or the TpLRR pattern
were all considered as BspA-like candidate proteins and
were hence named TvBspA.
The first 150 bp of the 5’ upstream regions for all
TvBspA-like genes were extracted from TrichDB to allow
their comparisons and identify potential Inr sequences
(consensus: [ATC]CA +1 [ATGC] [AT]) or TATA-box
(consensus: TATA [AT]A [AT]) typically located in
T. vaginalis genes within 30 bp or 50 bp, respectively,
upstream of the translation initiation codon [36,82].
In order to identify candidate surface and secreted
proteins the potential presence of SP (SignalP3.0 [83])
and TMD (TMHMM2.0 [84]) was investigate using the
annotation and retrieval tool at TrichDB. These data
were complemented with TMD identified with SPLIT4
[85] and PHOBIUS [61,86], with the latter also investigating the presence of SP. Proteins positive for SP with
either SignalP3.0 or PHOBIUS where considered to possess a SP. The position of TMD and protein topology in
the membrane was established using the consensus
between the three methods TMHMM2.0, SPLIT4 and
PHOBIUS and entries were annotated as TMD-CCT
when at least two methods overlapped with the TMD
position and agreed with the protein topology, as such
consensus approaches can provide better predictions
[87]. In order to investigate the potential presence of
CAAX motif at the C-terminus in TvBspA-like proteins
without TMD domains we used PrePS [63].
SAPS [88,89], RepSeq [43] and REPTILE [44] analyses
were performed to investigate the potential presence of
repeats and their features (in addition to the TpLRR) and
low complexity segments among TvBspA-like proteins.
Protein alignments were performed with ClustalW2.0.9 [90] for all or selected subsets of TvBspA
sequences and took advantage of the iteration process
(iteration on the final alignment for all 911 TvBspA or
for each step for reduced set of sequences) that allow
improvement of the alignment quality. Clustal was also
used to generate table of protein pairwise sequence
identity (%). SEAVIEW [91] was used to view, edit and
manipulate the alignments for figure preparation.
To identify potential protein domains and functional
sites the TvBspA proteins were analyses with InterProScan [92].
Cell culturing

The T. vaginalis clinical isolate G3, for which a draft
genome was published [36], and the clinical isolate SS22 [45] were used for most of the molecular cell biology experimental work. In addition other isolates
described below were used for EST libraries and

Page 20 of 26

microarray analyses. Cells were grown axenically at 37°C
in Modified Diamond Medium [93] without agar,
supplemented with 10%(v/v) heat-inactivated horse
serum (Gibco, Invitrogen) and 50,000 units/l penicillin
and 50 mg/l streptomycin (Penicillin-Streptomycin
Solution, Sigma).
EST libraries

Total RNAs were isolated from different culture conditions indicated below. cDNAs primed with oligo-dT
were synthesized by using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit
and directionally cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites
of Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene) vector. The quality of the
unidirectional cDNA library was assessed by colony
PCR of 96 randomly picked clones to determine the
average insert size and percentage of clones without
inserts. Then 384 randomly picked clones were
sequenced to determine the percentage of vector contamination, valid average length and redundancy of the
cDNA library. Plasmids were in-vivo excised from the
cDNA library by using helper phage and transformed
into E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) as described by the
manufacturer (Stratagene). Around 10,000 ESTs were
randomly picked from each cDNA library which represents different stages of cell cycle, pathogenesis and specific nutrient requirements [94]. The five culture
conditions used are described below:
Condition [1]: TvEST Library (10,749 ESTs), T. vaginalis isolate ATCC30236 (JH 31A#4).
Medium: YIS, pH 6.0 supplemented with 100 μM ferric ammonium citrate. Growth condition: unsynchronized culture harvested at mid-log phase, trophozoites
forms.
Condition [2]: TvG Library (10,470 ESTs), T. vaginalis

We also took advantage of the ~24,000 EST stored in
GenBank dbEST that include those generated by TIGR
[36] and our 4003 in house EST generated from T. vaginalis (G3) trophozoites (mid log-phase). The latter were
deposited in dbEST with the accession numbers http://

20Hirt_RP%20trichomonas%20vaginalis.
Microarray and quantitate RT-PCR

Corning® UltraGAPST coated slides were spotted with
cDNA derived from the ~70,000 EST characterised from
the various growth condition described above. A total of
7,680 cDNA (4,938 distinct entries) were successfully
amplified by PCR from plasmids and spotted on the
array once, twice or in triplicate. A total of 8 arrays
were used to contrast expression levels - dye-swap
experimental design for four independent experiments.
T. vaginalis cells were grown in two conditions contrasting high iron (TYM medium supplemented with 150
μM iron nitrilotriacetate) and low iron (TYM medium
with 80 μM DIP) and grown for 10 passages in the
respective conditions. Total RNA was extracted using
QuickPrep Total RNA Extraction Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and cleaned up using Rneasy CleanUp Kit
(Quiagen). Total RNA concentration and purity was
determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The cDNA probes
were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using primers
contained in 3DNA Array 900 Expression Array Detection Kit (Genisphere). The hybridization was carried out
following 3DNA Array 900 Expression Array Detection
Kit (Genisphere) protocol. The signal was transformed
with natural log (ln) and normalized by LOWESS normalization method in the TIGR microarray data analysis
system (MIDAS) version 2.19 [95]. Entries with p values
<1e-3 were considered to have significant differences in
transcript concentration. Mean and standard deviation
for the 13 TvBspA genes with significant difference in
level of expression and appropriate control genes are
listed in Table 4. qRT-PCR of selected genes was used
to validate the microarray data and included three
TvBspA genes and 14 control unrelated genes (unpublished data) two of which are listed in Table 4. All primers used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR
are listed in additional file 19, Table S12. All tested
genes by qRT-PCR were in qualitative agreement with
the microarray data. The Microarray data were
deposited into ArrayExpress with the accession number
E-MTAB-126.
Extracellular matrix binding assay and semi-quantitative
RT-PCR

Culture cell flasks (25 cm 2 , Greiner Bio-One) were
coated with a PBS solution containing 500 μg/ml

Page 21 of 26

Collagen I (rat tail, Marathon Lab), 40 μg/ml laminin
(Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma, basement
membrane, Sigma), 50 μg/ml fibronectin (human
plasma, Sigma) and 50 μg/ml phenol red (Sigma) as pH
indicator. The solidification of the coating solution in a
gel was obtained by incubation at 37°C for 10 min and
coated flasks were stored at room temperature. The
resulting gel matrix was an ultra-thin pink coloured
layer of proteins homogenously covering the entire bottom surface of the flask. Trichomonas vaginalis cells
used for binding assays were harvested from mid-log
phase growth (~24 hrs) by centrifugation at 750 × g
min -1 and washed twice in minimal binding buffer
(MBB) [96]. Parasites were counted using a Neubauer
Haemocytometer and coated flasks were seeded with 5
× 106 cells in 5 ml of MBB and incubation carried out
at 37°C for 60 min. Amoeboid shaped cells could be
observed upon binding to the substrate after ~10 min.
After 60 min, flasks were washed twice with warm MBB
in order to remove unbound cells and the majority of
cells were tightly bound to the substrate and showed a
large proportion of amoeba forms or had pseudopodiallike cellular extensions. The population of cells were
diverse in their morphology and movements with some
cells actively roaming the substrate (including some
with long pseudopodia up ~1/3 of the length of the
cell), whereas others were static.
Expression of selected TvBspA-like protein coding
genes was analysed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR contrasting ECM bound cells and trophozoites not exposed
to the substrate. Total RNA extractions were performed
in parallel on both ECM bound cells and trophozoites
not exposed to the substrate, using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) according to manufacturer specifications (that includes a DNAase treatment step to
insure the absence of any genomic DNA) and total RNA
were quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. The polyA+
mRNA were then purified using Dynabeads® mRNA
Purification Kit (Dynal Biotech) and The RT-PCR
THERMOSCRIPT Kit (Invitrogen) was used for the RTPCR reactions with specific primer pairs previously
tested on genomic DNA - all producing the expected
size amplicons without detectable background. The
same amounts of cDNA from either ECM bound cells
or trophozoites were used for each the PCR reactions.
The amount of cDNA used for bound cells and trophozoites was normalized based on the total RNA concentrations since the smaller amount of cDNA obtained
from the ECM proteins bound cells did not allow its
quantification. Controls RT-PCRs consisted of actin
(loading control) and alpha-actinin (up-regulated gene
upon amoeba transformation) amplifications using specific primers previously described [97]. These procedures were carried out in five independent binding

Noël et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:99

assays and independent PCR reactions (at least three per
binding assays) and gave similar expression patterns for
the tested genes. All primers are listed in additional file
19, Table S12. PCR reactions were run on 1% agarose
gel for analysis.
Peptide synthesis and mouse anti-peptide antisera

Four peptides were designed from the TvBspA625
sequence [28] and their sequence features to optimized
peptide synthesis, solubility and antigenicity and to differentiate TvBspA625 from other Trichomonas proteins. Two peptides sequences were derived from the
inferred extracellular domain and two peptides from
the cytoplasmic tail (Figure 2). BlastP with all four
peptides as query established that three peptides are
likely to generate TvBspA625 specific antisera. One
TvBspA625 peptide (EXT-1) could possibly generate
antisera cross-reacting with TvBspA805 or be recognised by patients antibodies directed against
TvBspA805 as a stretch of 10 identical contiguous residues was shared between TvBspA625 and TvBspA805.
The four peptides were synthesised by adding a Nterminal cysteine, to allow cross-linking with the maleimide-activated carrier proteins. Peptides were
coupled to both keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)
and bovine serum albumine (BSA) by using the Imject
Maleimide Activated Immunogen kit (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA), following the manufacturer instruction.
Immunization of eight BALB/c mice (two mice/peptide) five weeks old was performed by both subcutaneous and intraperitoneal inoculation of 20 μg of KHL
conjugated peptide proteins in complete Freund’s adjuvant per inoculum. Mice were inoculated three times
with an interval of 10 days, and sacrificed six days
after the final intravenous boost with 10 μg of BSAcoupled peptides. Sera were collected and specific reactivity against each peptide was tested by ELISA using
plates coated with KLH and BSA coupled peptides.
The antisera titre ranged from 1:100,000 to 1:500,000.
Presera and sera were collected and used for indirect
immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses using
indicated dilutions.
Western blot analyses

Total cell extracts from T. vaginalis cell cutlures were
submitted to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as previously described [98]. Briefly, 3 × 105 washed cells from
exponentially growing cultures were resuspended in 100
μl of Laemmli lysis buffer and boiled for 3 min. 10 μl of
each sample were then loaded in each well of a 7.5%
SDS-PAGE gel, electrophoresed, blotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked, and separately incubated with the mouse
anti-peptide sera at 1: 2000 dilution. After washing,

Page 22 of 26

membranes were incubated with a goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulin sera, conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, S. Louis, USA). Bound antibodies were
detected by soaking the nitrocellulose membrane in AP
buffer (0.1 M tris pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.005 M MgCl2)
to which 0.33 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and
0.165 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate
(BCIP) were added.
Indirect immunofluorescence analyses (IFA)

Trophozoites of T. vaginalis grown in vitro were collected during the exponential growth phase at 350 × g
for 5 min and washed twice with Ringer (NaCl 0.12 M,
KCl 3.5 mM, CaCl2 2 mM, NaHCO3 2.5 mM, pH 7.2)
and fixed with either 3% formaldehyde (Sigma) 10 min
at room temperature or 70% ethanol at -20°C, 20 min.
Fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 250 × g
for 10 min at 4°C, washed twice with PBS pH 7.2, and
allowed to adhere to poly-L-lysine coated slides for 1
h. Formaldehyde fixed cells, once bound, were further
incubated with 50 mM NH4Cl to quench protein side
groups exposed by this fixation procedure and then
washed twice in PBS. Slides were incubated with
blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for
30 min before incubation with primary mouse antipeptide antisera over night at 4°C. As control we used
VG2, a mouse anti-T. vaginalis-a-tubulin monoclonal
antibody [50] and a rabbit anti-T. vaginalis-hydrogenosomal malic enzyme antisera [49]. After three washes
of 10 min each with PBS, the slides were incubated
with both Alexa-Fluor-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgGs and Alexa-Fluor-594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgGs (both from Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) diluted
1:200 for 1 h at 37°C. After rinsing three times with
PBS, the coverslips were mounted with VECTASHIELD® Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, UK) prior microscopic observation with a
confocal laser scanning microscopy Leica TCS SP2UV.
Images were captured and processed using Leica CS
Lite program version 2.61.
ELISA assays to measure human patients immune
response against TvBspA625 peptides

Sera from a total of 591 humans with high risk of sexually transmitted diseases were selected and kept frozen
at -20°C until enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) experiments; 356 sera were from female
patients, while 235 from males. Consent was obtained
from the patients and the material was databased and
processed anonymously. ELISA were performed following a published method [99]. Cells from T. vaginalis isolate SS-22 were used as the source of total antigen since
it is characterised by a low degree of phenotypic

variation and is not infected by Mycoplasma hominis.
Parasites (viability 99%) were resuspended at the density
of 1 × 106/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
50 μl of T. vaginalis suspension were seeded in each
well of PVC microtiter-well plates (Becton Dickinson,
Lincoln Park, NJ) and allowed to dry. 50 μl of ice-cold
95% ethanol were added to each well and allowed to
dry, then washed in distilled water, and stored at 4°C
until use. Prior to use, wells were pretreated for 2 hours
with a PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) solution containing
5% nonfat dry milk. 100 μl of sera diluted 1:200 in the
same solution were then added and incubated for two
hours at room temperature. After extensive rinsing with
PBS-T, 100 μl of goat anti-human IgG or IgM antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, St.
Louis) were added. After two hours, the color reaction
was induced with specific substrates and absorbance
measured. Cutoff was established as twice the mean
value obtained with sera from 10 healthy male volunteers distinct from the 591 tested humans. Sera were
classified as negative if the ELISA readings were lower
than the cutoff value, or positive if at least twice above
the cutoff value.
In order to evaluate the immunogenicity of
TvBspA625 protein during T. vaginalis infections, the
presence of specific antibodies against the four immunogenic peptides were tested by ELISA in 161 human sera
positive for T. vaginalis total proteins, as defined above.
In addition, 61 sera negative for T. vaginalis total proteins were used for comparisons. ELISA plates were
coated over night separately with 1 μg of BSA or KLHlinked peptide in 50 μl carbonate buffer, pH 8,6. Plates
were then washed with PBS 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T)
and saturated with BPS-T containing 5% nonfat dry
milk. All sera were diluted 1:200 and separately tested
for reactivity against each peptide and immune complexes detected as described above. Statistical tests on
the ELISA data (2-way contingency table, Pearson chisquare test) were performed at [100].
