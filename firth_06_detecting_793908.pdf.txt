Abstract
Background: Detecting new coding sequences (CDSs) in viral genomes can be difficult for several
reasons. The typically compact genomes often contain a number of overlapping coding and noncoding functional elements, which can result in unusual patterns of codon usage; conservation
between related sequences can be difficult to interpret – especially within overlapping genes; and
viruses often employ non-canonical translational mechanisms – e.g. frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, leaky-scanning and internal ribosome entry sites – which can conceal potentially coding
open reading frames (ORFs).
Results: In a previous paper we introduced a new statistic – MLOGD (Maximum Likelihood
Overlapping Gene Detector) – for detecting and analysing overlapping CDSs. Here we present (a)
an improved MLOGD statistic, (b) a greatly extended suite of software using MLOGD, (c) a
database of results for 640 virus sequence alignments, and (d) a web-interface to the software and
database. Tests show that, from an alignment with just 20 mutations, MLOGD can discriminate
non-overlapping CDSs from non-coding ORFs with a typical accuracy of up to 98%, and can detect
CDSs overlapping known CDSs with a typical accuracy of 90%. In addition, the software produces
a variety of statistics and graphics, useful for analysing an input multiple sequence alignment.
Conclusion: MLOGD is an easy-to-use tool for virus genome annotation, detecting new CDSs –
in particular overlapping or short CDSs – and for analysing overlapping CDSs following frameshift
sites. The software, web-server, database and supplementary material are available at http://
guinevere.otago.ac.nz/mlogd.html.

Background
Methods for finding protein-coding sequences (CDSs) in
prokaryotes and eukaryotes are well-developed. Algorithms generally make use of combinations of the following signatures of CDSs: (a) codon or dicodon bias etc., (b)
conservation between species, (c) similarity to known
sequences, (d) presence of open reading frames (ORFs),
splice sites etc., and (e) expression in cDNA/EST libraries
[1].

In virus genomes, however, the situation can be complicated by a number of factors, that may lead to decreased
sensitivity: (a) virus genomes are often too small (e.g. < 10
kb) to obtain codon usage statistics and, in any case, the
compact genomes often contain overlapping coding and
non-coding functional elements that can result in unusual
codon usage patterns; (b) regions of high conservation
between related sequences may not necessarily be coding
and, where CDSs and/or non-coding functional elements
overlap, conservation may only reveal the presence of one

of the overlapping pair; (c) new virus types often contain
novel CDSs, dissimilar to previously annotated CDS; and
(d) viruses can employ a variety of non-canonical translational mechanisms – e.g. frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, leaky-scanning and internal ribosome entry
sites.
Comparative genomics is a particularly useful way to
detect new CDSs in virus genomes, because many
sequenced virus genomes, covering a useful range of
diversity (i.e. sequence divergence), are available. In its
simplest form, a comparative genomics approach consists
of looking for genome regions that are more conserved
than average between related sequences. Such an
approach may fail to distinguish CDSs from other conserved elements. A more advanced approach is to look for
the particular mutation patterns associated with CDSs –
e.g. the CRITICA software [2], or pair hidden Markov
models [3]. However, previous such algorithms have not
dealt adequately with the case of overlapping CDSs.
In a previous paper [4] we introduced a probabilistic
model for the mutation patterns associated with non-coding, single-coding and double-coding regions of a multiple sequence alignment, and a maximum likelihood
statistic – called MLOGD – for predicting whether a new
query ORF is coding or non-coding. Here we present (a)
an improved MLOGD statistic, (b) a greatly extended suite
of software using MLOGD (70% is new relative to [4], the
rest has been substantially revised), (c) a database of
results in virus genomes, and (d) a web-interface to the
software and database.

Implementation
The MLOGD statistic
Given an input sequence alignment, a null model of the
CDS annotation (i.e. the known CDSs in some chosen reference sequence) and an alternate model (i.e. the known
CDSs plus a new putative CDS), the MLOGD statistic is an
estimate of the relative probabilities of obtaining the
observed pattern of mutations across the alignment under
each of the null and alternate models. In this subsection
we first describe how the MLOGD statistic is calculated for
a pairwise sequence alignment. Then we describe how this
is extended to a multiple sequence alignment. More extensive notes are given on the website.
MLOGD statistic for a two-sequence alignment
Given two aligned sequences S1 and S2, we estimate the
probability that S1 mutates to S2, after time t, by

log P(S1 → S2 ; t , M) =
N

nucleotides
k
k
log P(N1 → N2 ; t , mk ),
∑k = 1

(1)

k
k
where N1 and N2 are the nucleotides in S1 and S2 at the

kth alignment position (see website for treatment of alignk
k
ment gaps); P( N1 → N2 ; t, mk) is calculated using nucle-

otide, codon and amino acid substitution matrices, as
described in [4] (with the obvious extension for the noncoding model); M is the null or alternate model; and mk is
the coding status (non-coding, single-coding or doublecoding) at the kth alignment position, according to the
relevant model M (defined on the chosen reference
sequence).
We define the pairwise sequence divergence, Λ, to be the
total number of point nucleotide differences between S1
and S2, and we determine t numerically for each of the
null and alternate models by requiring the expected
number of mutations between S1 and S2, under the
model, to equal the observed number of mutations, Λ.
The log likelihood ratio of the two models is
log(LR) = log P(S1 → S2 ; t = t alt , M = alt) −
log P(S1 → S2 ; t = t null , M = null).

(2)

If log(LR) is positive, then the observed mutations
between S1 and S2 are more consistent with the alternate
model. If log(LR) is negative, then the observed mutations
are more consistent with the null model.
MLOGD statistic for a multiple sequence alignment
The MLOGD statistic, ∑tree log(LR), is calculated for a multiple sequence alignment using the following procedure.
First a phylogenetic tree is constructed using standard software (e.g. PHYLIP, [5]). The (unrooted) tree is used to
select a list of sequence pairs tracing round the outside of
the tree (figure on website). Such a set of pairwise comparisons covers each branch of the tree precisely twice. The
MLOGD statistic, log(LR), is calculated for each of the
sequence pairs in the list, summed up over all the pairs,
and divided by two, to give the MLOGD statistic for the
multiple sequence alignment, ∑tree log (LR). Similarly, the
total number of mutations, ∑tree Λ across the phylogenetic
tree is the sum of Λ values for each sequence pair, divided
by two.
Input data
The required input data for MLOGD are a multiple
sequence alignment of related sequences, a list of known
CDSs (possibly none) in a chosen reference sequence, and
a phylogenetic tree. Circular genomes are fully supported.
For viruses, useful sets of related sequences may be
obtained from the NCBI Viral Genomes Project website
[6]. There are tools on the web-server to help produce a
suitable alignment and phylogenetic tree.

CDS3 was used as the query CDS and the remaining five CDSs were taken as the known CDSs. The first panel displays the raw
log(LR) statistics at each alignment position. There is a separate track for each reference – non-reference sequence pair
(labelled at the right, together with the pairwise divergences). Gaps, and stop codons in each of the null and alternate model
CDSs, for each sequence, are marked on the appropriate tracks. The second panel displays the ∑tree log (LR) statistic at each
alignment position. The third and fourth panels display sliding window means of the statistics in the first and second panels,
respectively. The fifth panel shows the locations of the null and alternate model CDSs. The sixth panel shows the summed
mean sequence divergence (mutations per nt) for the sequence pairs that contribute to the ∑tree log (LR) statistic at each alignment position. This is a measure of the information available at each alignment position (e.g. partially gapped regions have
lower summed mean sequence divergence). (See website for more details.) The predominantly positive values in the fourth
panel show that CDS3 is functionally constrained over the majority of its length.

Six-frame sliding window plot
Six-frame sliding window plot. Example output plot for the 'Six-frame sliding window plots' option (same sequences as in
Figure 1). This is a plot of the ∑tree log (LR) statistic calculated in a sliding window along the alignment in each of the six possible
read-frames. In each window, the null model is that 'only the known CDS(s) are coding' while the alternate model is that 'both
the window and the known CDS(s) are coding'. Panel 1 shows the positions of alignment gaps in each of the input sequences
(labelled at right), while panel 2 shows the positions of stop codons in each of the six possible read-frames in each of the input
sequences. Panel 3 shows the ∑tree log (LR) statistic in each window in the +0 frame (relative to reference sequence nt 1). The
width of each window is indicated by horizontal grey lines (if the reference sequence contains alignment gaps within the window, then the window will appear enlarged in alignment coordinates). The horizontal dashed line is at zero. Panel 4 shows the
positions of stop codons in the +0 frame in all the input sequences (same order as in panel 1). Panels 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 show
the same information as panel 3, but for the +1, +2, -0, -1 and -2 frames, respectively. Similarly, panels 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 show
the same information as panel 4, but for the +1, +2, -0, -1 and -2 frames, respectively. Panel 15 shows the known CDSs (here
none were entered). Panel 16 shows the summed mean sequence divergence (mutations per nt) at each alignment position
(see caption to Figure 1). (See website for more details.) Extended regions of positive signal in panels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 indicate potential CDSs (i.e. other than those identified in the null model). In this particular plot, no known CDS(s) were entered,
i.e. the null model is that the whole genome is non-coding. Hence the actual Luteovirus CDSs have clear positive signals. Note
that several of the reverse read-frames show a false positive signal when they are in the -2 frame relative to a forward readframe CDS (see website for details).

Operation modes
The MLOGD software has three operation modes,
described below. The 'Test input query CDSs' option can
be used to test a specific query CDS (e.g. an ORF that has
not previously been annotated as a CDS). The 'Find and
test all non-annotated ORFs' and 'Six-frame sliding window plots' options can be used to search a whole input
alignment for new CDSs.
Test input query CDSs
Here MLOGD calculates the null versus alternate model
likelihood ratio statistics, where the null model is that the
query ORF is non-coding, while the alternate model is
that the query ORF is coding (both the null and alternate
models include all the annotated CDSs).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/75

cate potential new CDSs, especially where there is an
absence of stop codons across the alignment.

Results and discussion
Sensitivity and selectivity
The software has been previously tested on simulated data
and on overlapping CDSs in the Hepatitis B Virus and
Escherichia coli genomes [4]. In a further test on 14 virus
alignments, all 37 known CDSs were detected (including
five examples of overlapping CDSs completely contained
within other CDSs, and 20 CDSs that partially overlap
other CDSs). Conversely, the false positive rate for all
non-coding ORFs of at least 40 codons was 0.06 (-2 frame
overlaps excluded; see website for details). In addition, all
the false positives had very low MLOGD scores (outside
the range observed for the known CDSs).

The output includes:
1. A table of log(LR) statistics for each reference – non-reference sequence pair.
2. A plot of the log(LR) statistic for each reference – nonreference sequence pair and summed over the phylogenetic tree. On the web-server there is a link to generate
Monte Carlo simulated sequences under the same null
and alternate models. The simulations are used to estimate confidence limits on the log(LR) statistics. (Figures
not shown.)
3. A nucleotide-by-nucleotide plot of the log(LR) statistic
for each reference – non-reference sequence pair, the sum
over the phylogenetic tree, and running means of the
same (Figure 1). On the web-server there are links to
zoom in on the plot and/or adjust the running-mean window size.
Find and test all non-annotated ORFs
The 'Find and test all non-annotated ORFs' option finds
all non-annotated ORFs longer than a specified minimum
length, and produces the same statistics and plots as the
'Test input query CDSs' option for each of these ORFs. The
user may select 'start-stop' ORFs or 'stop-stop' ORFs.
Six-frame sliding window plots
Sometimes a CDS may be entered through a stop codon
read-through, ribosomal frameshift, or splicing event
rather than with an AUG codon. The 'Find and test all
non-annotated ORFs' option (above) may not be the best
way to locate such CDSs, since such CDSs generally commence part-way through an ORF. The 'Six-frame sliding
window plots' option calculates the ∑tree log(LR) statistic
in a window sliding along the alignment in all six reading
frames (Figure 2). The user may select the window and
step sizes. Extended regions of positive signal may indi-

Further tests showed that, for alignments with just 20
mutations overall (i.e. ∑tree Λ = 20; e.g. a pairwise comparison of two 100 nt sequences with a mean divergence of
0.2 mutations per nt), MLOGD can discriminate nonoverlapping CDSs from non-coding ORFs with a typical
accuracy of up to 98%, and can detect CDSs overlapping
known CDSs with a typical accuracy of 90% (see website
for details). In general usage, ∑tree Λ is often much greater
than 20, with correspondingly lower predicted error rates.
On-line virus database
A database of results for 640 virus sequence alignments is
available on the website. The database contains multiple
sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, positions of
known CDSs, six-frame sliding window plots, statistics
and plots for the annotated CDSs, and statistics and plots
for all non-annotated start-stop ORFs in the reference
sequences of at least 40 codons in length.

Conclusion
We have presented (a) a new tool for locating and analysing CDSs in virus alignments, and (b) an on-line database
of results in 640 virus alignments. Besides the easy-to-use
website and comprehensive output, the main advantage
of MLOGD over other gene-finding software is that
MLOGD explicitly takes into account the possibility of
overlapping genes – common in viruses. For example, for
the Hepatitis B, Avian Hepatitis B, Polerovirus, Luteovirus
and Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 genomes (compact genomes with relatively high fractions of overlapping
CDSs), MLOGD successfully finds all 28 known CDSs,
while GeneMark only finds 17 (VIOLIN database, [7]).
We have extensively tested the sensitivity of MLOGD and
shown it to be more sensitive than other methods for
detecting overlapping CDSs [4].
MLOGD can, of course, also be used for cellular organisms. Partially overlapping CDSs are fairly common in

prokaryotes, but it is not clear what fraction of overlaps
are functionally constrained. Many appear to be the result
of the loss of a stop codon, allowing one CDS to run into
an adjacent CDS [8]. Others may be involved in regulatory
mechanisms [9]. Similarly, many potential ribosomal
frameshift sites – leading to overlapping CDSs – have
been identified in cellular organisms [10], as well as viral
genomes. MLOGD is a valuable tool for analysing the
magnitude of functional constraints on such overlaps,
with implications for the annotation of putative
frameshift sites, and the evolution of overlapping genes in
viruses and in prokaryotes.

Availability and requirements
The MLOGD software and virus database are available at
http://guinevere.otago.ac.nz/mlogd.html (see also Additional file 1). Sequences may be entered into the webinterface or the software (C++ programmes, C-shell
scripts; distributed under the GNU General Public
License) may be downloaded and used locally. To install
the software locally, the publicly available packages
EMBOSS [11] and R [12] must also be installed. The programme codaln [13] is recommended for aligning the
input sequences. Run-time and resource-use scale approximately linearly with the number of sequences and the
length of the input alignment. On a Pentium 4 2.8 GHz
processor, analysing a 900 nt ORF takes ~3 s for a fivesequence alignment, while running six-frame sliding window plots (default window sizes) for a 10000 nt region
takes ~300 s.
