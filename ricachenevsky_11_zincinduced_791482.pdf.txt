Abstract
Background: Duplications are very common in the evolution of plant genomes, explaining the high number of
members in plant gene families. New genes born after duplication can undergo pseudogenization,
neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization. Rice is a model for functional genomics research, an important crop
for human nutrition and a target for biofortification. Increased zinc and iron content in the rice grain could be
achieved by manipulation of metal transporters. Here, we describe the ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE (ZIFL) gene
family in plants, and characterize the genomic structure and expression of rice paralogs, which are highly affected
by segmental duplication.
Results: Sequences of sixty-eight ZIFL genes, from nine plant species, were comparatively analyzed. Although
related to MSF_1 proteins, ZIFL protein sequences consistently grouped separately. Specific ZIFL sequence
signatures were identified. Monocots harbor a larger number of ZIFL genes in their genomes than dicots, probably
a result of a lineage-specific expansion. The rice ZIFL paralogs were named OsZIFL1 to OsZIFL13 and characterized.
The genomic organization of the rice ZIFL genes seems to be highly influenced by segmental and tandem
duplications and concerted evolution, as rice genome contains five highly similar ZIFL gene pairs. Most rice ZIFL
promoters are enriched for the core sequence of the Fe-deficiency-related box IDE1. Gene expression analyses of
different plant organs, growth stages and treatments, both from our qPCR data and from microarray databases,
revealed that the duplicated ZIFL gene pairs are mostly co-expressed. Transcripts of OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL7, and
OsZIFL12 accumulate in response to Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency in roots, two stresses with partially overlapping
responses.
Conclusions: We suggest that ZIFL genes have different evolutionary histories in monocot and dicot lineages. In
rice, concerted evolution affected ZIFL duplicated genes, possibly maintaining similar expression patterns between
pairs. The enrichment for IDE1 boxes in rice ZIFL gene promoters suggests a role in Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency
up-regulation of ZIFL transcripts. Moreover, this is the first description of the ZIFL gene family in plants and the
basis for functional studies on this family, which may play important roles in Zn and Fe homeostasis in plants.

Background
Duplications are recurrent in the evolutionary history of
plant genomes. Whole genome duplications (or polyploidy) are described for dicotyledons and monocotyledons [1-4]. It is estimated that the incidence of

polyploidy in angiosperms is 30-80%, and ploidy changes
may represent about 24% of speciation events [5]. Duplication generates two copies of each gene, and the fate of
duplicated genes was first described by Ohno: one copy
should maintain the ancient function and another copy
should lose function (pseudogenization) or gain a new
function (neofunctionalization) [6]. This model was
improved, giving rise to the duplication-degenerationcomplementation (DDC) model, where the duplicated

copies can have complementary functions that resemble
the ancestral gene’s function (subfunctionalization) [7].
The DDC model’s predictions are believed to be more
accurate than the previous model, since loss-of-function
changes in regulatory regions are more likely to occur
than gain-of-function mutations [7]. Other improvements of the basic model for duplicated gene retention,
involving buffering of crucial functions via conversion
and crossing-over, were recently proposed [8,9].
Due to repetitive genome duplications, plants are likely
to harbor relatively larger gene families, as compared to
animal genomes [10]. It is well established that one
whole-genome duplication occurred in the cereal lineage,
estimated 70 million years ago (MYA), preceding the
radiation of the major cereal clades by 20 million years or
more [3,11]. Recently, comparing the genomic sequences
of rice (Oryza sativa) and Sorghum bicolor, it was demonstrated that an early duplication occurred in the monocot
lineage [4]. The duplication blocks cover at least 20% of
the cereals transcriptome [4]. It was also shown that
expression divergence between duplicate genes is significantly correlated with their sequence divergence [12].
After duplication, gene pairs rapidly diverge, and only a
small fraction of ancient gene pairs do not show expression divergence [12]. However, for some genomic segments, concerted evolution homogenizes homologous
sequences through unequal crossing-over and gene conversion, changing the estimated duplication age and gene
divergence [9,13-15].
Rice was first described as having 18 duplicated segments which cover 65.7% of its genomic sequence, and
several individual gene duplications [16]. More recent
estimates account for 29 duplications in the rice genome,
including 19 minor blocks that overlap with 10 major
blocks [17]. A duplication block between chromosomes
11 and 12 has been extensively characterized in rice and
other cereals, although the age of its birth is still controversial [9,14,15,18,19]. Rice is a model for cereal genomic
and genetics studies, due to the availability of the genome
sequences from two varieties, extensive gene annotation,
and mutant resources [20-24]. Rice is also a major staple
food, feeding nearly half of the world’s population. However, it is a poor source of minerals such as iron (Fe) and
zinc (Zn), the two mineral elements most commonly
lacking in human diets [25,26]. Metal homeostasis in
plants has been extensively studied in recent years, with a
special focus on the transition metals Zn and Fe [27-29].
Thus, rice emerges both as a model species for physiological and molecular studies and as a candidate for biotechnological improvement aiming at Zn and Fe
biofortification [30-32].
Both Zn and Fe are essential to mineral nutrition of
plants. Zn has a key role in gene expression, cell development and replication, while Fe is necessary for

Page 2 of 22

photosynthesis, electron transport and other redox reactions [33]. Although essential, both can be toxic when
in excess [34-37]. Several transporters involved in
uptake and translocation inside the plant were described
for Fe and Zn [35,38-43].
The ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR 1 gene (AtZIF1),
described by Haydon and Cobbett, belongs to a new family
of transporters, with three members in Arabidopsis thaliana: AtZIF1 (AT5G13740), AtZIFL1 (AT5G13750) and
AtZIFL2 (AT3G43790) [34]. The AtZIF1 transporter is
clearly involved in Zn homeostasis, as the loss-of-function
atzif1 mutant has altered Zn distribution and its transcription is up-regulated by Zn-excess [34]. Importantly,
AtZIF1 proteins are expressed in the tonoplast, and probably are involved in transport of Zn, Zn and a ligand or a
ligand alone, to the vacuole [34]. Besides AtZIF1, only one
similar protein had been previously characterized: the
maize (Zea mays) Zm-mfs1, which is induced by infection
by the pathogens Cochliobolus heterostrophus and C. carbonum and to ultraviolet light [44]. This gene is highly
expressed in the Les9 disease lesion mimic background
and in plant tissues engineered to express flavonoids or
the avirulence gene avrRxv [44]. Both AtZIF1 and Zmmfs1 are part of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS),
which comprises the largest superfamily of secondary
transport carriers found in living organisms and is subdivided in at least 29 families [45]. More recently,
AtZIF1 and AtZIFL1 were described as quantitative trait
loci (QTL) candidates for Zn concentrations in Arabidopsis seeds [46]. In barley (Hordeum vulgare), microarray
analyses revealed that a ZIF1-like gene is expressed in the
aleurone layer of seeds and its transcription increases in
the embryo upon foliar Zn application [47]. Therefore, it
is possible that ZIFL genes are involved in Zn translocation to the seeds.
In this work, we describe the ZIF-like (ZIFL) family of
transporters. We identified 68 family members from
plants and reconstructed their phylogenetic relationships. We also analyzed in detail the organization of
ZIFL genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome: the motif
composition, genomic organization, and promoter
sequences. We analyzed the expression of OsZIFL genes
in different plant organs and developmental stages, as
well as in response to different stresses. This is the first
attempt to describe the ZIFL gene family in plants, and
the first expression analysis of these genes in rice.

Results
ZIFL genes in plants

We first used the AtZIF1, AtZIFL1 and AtZIFL2 sequences
to query genomic databases to determine the distribution
of this gene family among plant species. Two dicots, Vitis
vinifera and Populus trichocarpa, one bryophyte, Physcomitrella patens, one lycophyte, Selaginella moellendorffii,

and four monocots, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa and Zea mays had their genomes
screened for ZIFL genes. All sequences found through this
search plus the three Arabidopsis sequences were used to
generate a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile to iteratively search the same genomes (see Methods). The final
dataset consists of 66 genes coding for proteins already
annotated (Additional File 1) and two unannotated proteins from Zea mays (Additional File 2).
All organisms queried contain ZIFL sequences, with
predicted protein sequences ranging from 289 to
557 amino acids and an average of 468.4 amino acids
per protein. All gene sequences begin with an initiation
codon and end with a stop codon, except for the protein
PpZIFL1, which lacks a small N-terminal portion (about
50 amino acids) and was included in the analyses. The
overall structure contains 11 to 12 predicted transmembrane (TM) domains (Additional File 1 and Additional
File 2), found in 63% of the proteins in our dataset.
Fourteen putative proteins are predicted to have 10 TM
domains, and 11 proteins have seven to nine TM
domains (Additional File 1 and Additional File 2).
Dicot species have a small number of ZIFL gene
copies, with V. vinifera and P. trichocarpa showing five
and four paralogs of ZIFL in their genomes, similar to
the three members of the Arabidopsis ZIFL gene family
[34]. Conversely, monocot species show a higher number of ZIFL genes, with S. bicolor having the highest
number of members (14), followed by rice (13), B. distachyon (10) and Z. mays (10). P. patens and S. moellendorffii harbor two and seven ZIFL genes, respectively.
Clearly, monocot species have a higher number of ZIFL
family paralogs than dicots. The seven ZIFL genes found
in S. moellendorffii seem to be closely related and not
originated from the same expansion which originated
the monocot ZIFL genes.
ZIFL proteins are a distinct family of MFS transporters

The ZIFL proteins are all part of the Major Facilitator
Superfamily (MFS) clan of transporter proteins (Pfam
number CL0015), composed by 22 families. They show
similarity to the MFS_1 family (Pfam number PF07690),
which is the largest family within the MFS clan. We used
the MFS_1 HMM profile to isolate the MFS_1 proteins
from all dicot and monocot genomes analyzed in this
work. Phylogenetic trees reconstructing the evolutionary
history of MFS_1 and ZIFL proteins for each species
were generated using the neighbor-joining method (Additional File 3). We observed that in all cases the ZIFL proteins clustered in a separate group from all other
MFS_1 members. This result could be an indication that
ZIFL is a distinct family of MFS transporters.
Simmons et al suggested that sequences similar to
Zm-mfs1 (ZmZIFL5 in Additional File 1 and throughout

Page 3 of 22

this work) could be a distinct group of MFS proteins
found in plants [44]. This was based on comparison of
signature sequences of nine plant sequences to bacterial
and fungal MFS sequences. To confirm this hypothesis,
we searched for signatures in the ZIFL HMM profile
and aligned them to the MFS_1 HMM profile. We
found the canonical MFS signature, located in the cytoplasmic loop between TM2 and TM3, as well as the
antiporter signature in TM5 (Figure 1A). When aligning
these signatures to the MFS_1 HMM profile, we noticed
that the ZIFL MFS signature G-x(3)-D-[RK]-x-G-R-[RK]
has a conserved tryptophan (W) before the first glycine
position, which is not observed in MFS_1 (Figure 1A).
The antiporter signature, S-x(8)-G-x(3)-G-P-x(2)-G-G, is
also slightly different, having preference for serine in the
first position, instead of glycine, as observed by Simmons et al (Figure 1A) [44]. The presence of these conserved positions indicates that ZIFL transporters share
structural and functional similarities with MFS antiporters, although they show specific features that are not
common to other MFS proteins.
The ZIFL sequences also show signatures that are not
shared with MFS_1 proteins. The conserved positions in
the loop between TM8 and TM9, [RK]-x(2)-G-P-[IV]-x
(3)-R, previously reported by Simmons et al, were confirmed in our dataset with a few changes (Figure 2B)
[44]. Importantly, we found two new conserved signatures that are specific for the ZIFL proteins. One of
them is a cysteine (Cys)-containing motif C-[PS]-G-C in
the cytoplasmic N-terminal loop of ZIFL proteins, and
the second one is a histidine (His)-containing motif
[PQ]-E-[TS]-[LI]-H-x-[HKLRD] in the cytoplasmic loop
between TM6 and TM7, before the beginning of a variable region (Figure 2B; see below). From our dataset of
68 ZIFL proteins, 58 have the Cys motif, with only three
proteins showing a serine residue in the second position
instead of a proline (Additional File 4). For the histidine
motif, 61 ZIFL proteins have the conserved residues
(Additional File 4). From these, 45 have the most conserved residues P-E-T-L-H-x-H, while the other 16 ZIFL
members contain the same motif with no more than
one residue substitution (Additional File 4). Considering
that the MFS_1 family has 56,680 proteins with very low
overall similarity between them, and that ZIFL proteins
share both high similarity and unique signatures, we
suggest that ZIFL proteins comprise a distinct family of
transporters.
ZIFL gene expansion is lineage specific

To address the hypothesis of a lineage specific expansion of ZIFL genes in monocot species, we generated an
alignment using the amino acid sequences of the
68 ZIFL genes found and reconstructed the phylogenetic
relationships of these protein sequences using two

groups (Figure 2). Thus, the split of the four monocot
species used in this work probably occurred after the
expansion of the ZIFL family observed in monocots, and
this expansion is not shared with other plant lineages.
ZIFL paralogs are unequally distributed in the rice
genome

and MFS_1 signatures present in the cytoplasmic loop between

ZIFL specific signature not found in general MFS_1 proteins. The
Cys motif C-[PS]-G-C is observed in the N-terminal cytoplasmic loop;

between TM6 and TM7, before the beginning of the variable region

loop between TM8 and TM9. The overall transmembrane topology

methods: neighbor-joining and bayesian analysis
(Figure 2). Although some nodes are not in agreement
comparing the two methods, our bootstrap values and
posterior probabilities support all the major nodes of
the tree, indicating that the reported group relationships
are reliable (Figure 2).
Proteins from bryophyte and lycophyte species grouped
together, with paralogs from each species in a separate
cluster. The ZIFL proteins from dicots also formed a distinct group (Figure 2). However, there was no clear
separation into sub-groups of orthologous sequences
within the dicots group (Figure 2). Species-specific gene
duplications are observed in Arabidopsis (AtZIF1
and AtZIFL1), V. vinifera (VvZIFL2 and VvZIFL3;
VvZIFL4 and VvZIFL5) and P. trichocarpa (PtZIFL1 and
PtZIFL4) (Figure 2).
The ZIFL paralogs from monocot species were
grouped in three distinct groups, named Monocot I,
Monocot II and Monocot III. All three ZIFL protein
groups from the monocots contain paralogs from the
four species included in our analysis. The Monocot I
group contains 17 ZIFL proteins, while the Monocot II
and Monocot III groups contain 15 proteins each
(Figure 2). Both the number of sequences found in
monocot species and the tree topology strongly suggest
that the ZIFL gene family experienced an expansion in
the monocot lineage, and that the last common ancestor
of the monocots already had ZIFL paralogs of the three

The identification of the ZIFL gene chromosome locations
revealed that they are not evenly distributed in the rice
genome, but rather arranged in clusters (Additional File
5). The same trend is observed in S. bicolor and B. distachyon, but not in Z. mays (Additional File 5). Rice ZIFL
genes were named ZIFL1 to 13 based on their genomic
locations. Two ZIFL genes, OsZIFL1 and OsZIFL2 are
located in chromosome 1, and OsZIFL3 is located in chromosome 7. OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL6, OsZIFL7 and
OsZIFL8 are found in chromosome 11, while OsZIFL9,
OsZIFL10, OsZIFL11, OsZIFL12 and OsZIFL13 are located
in chromosome 12. Interestingly, the ZIFL genes arranged
in tandem in chromosomes 11 and 12 are closely related,
with OsZIFL4 being very similar to OsZIFL9 (92% of
identity), OsZIFL5 to OsZIFL10 (95%), OsZIFL6 to
OsZIFL11 (82%), OsZIFL7 to OsZIFL12 (85%) and
OsZIFL8 to OsZIFL13 (73%) (Table 1). We used the
GATA tool to align the 100 kb regions that include
OsZIFL genes in chromosomes 11 and 12 (hereafter
Os11 and Os12; Figure 3A). The regions of chromosomes
11 and 12 where these genes are located have already been
described as a recent segmental duplication in the rice
genome, what would explain the high number of matches
between these regions (Figure 3A) [18,48]. However, the
same duplication was recently found in S. bicolor, indicating that this segmental duplication is ancient to the split
of these species [14,15]. We observed that S. bicolor chromosomes 5 and 8 (hereafter Sb05 and Sb08), which are
homologous to rice chromosomes 11 and 12 (Os11 and
Os12), harbor three and two ZIFL genes, respectively
(Figure 3B) [14]. An incomplete sequence related to ZIFL
is also found in chromosome 8 (Sb08g001390; Figure 3B).
It is possible to observe that an inversion has occurred
when comparing the orientation of ZIFL regions in
Sb05 and Sb08 (Figure 3B). The alignment between rice
and S. bicolor homologous chromosomes Os11 with
Sb05 and Os12 with Sb08 demonstrate that the S. bicolor
ZIFL region in Sb08 is inverted, since the alignment of
Os11 with Sb05 is in direct orientation (Figure 3C) while
the alignment of Os12 with Sb08 is in reverse (Figure 3D).
Therefore, although in homologous regions, the ZIFL gene
cluster in Sb08 is differentially oriented in relation to rice.
OsZIFL genes organization is highly conserved

We aligned the genomic and coding sequence (CDS) of
each ZIFL gene from rice and determined the exonintron organization (Figure 4). The exon sizes of each

OsZIFL6-OsZIFL11, OsZIFL7-OsZIFL12 and OsZIFL8OsZIFL13 are nearly identical, with very few variations in
sequences. We observed that OsZIFL1 and OsZIFL2 are
probably originated from duplication, since they share a
similar exon-intron organization. However, their amino
acid sequences are only 57% identical (Table 1). This
duplication probably occurred in the common ancestor
of monocots, as orthologs from S. bicolor, B. distachyon
and Z. mays were found for both OsZIFL1 and OsZIFL2
(Figure 2). OsZIFL3 is suggested to be originated from a
partial duplication of the OsZIFL8-OsZIFL13 pair
last common ancestor (Figures 2 and 4), and shares
more identities to OsZIFL8 sequence (60%) than to
OsZIFL13 (40%). Thus, it is clear that duplications were
of major importance in the ZIFL family expansion in rice,

especially the segmental duplication observed in chromosomes 11 and 12.
Protein motif composition reveals a variable region in the
ZIFL family

We aligned the 13 rice ZIFL proteins and observed that
they share large similarity (Additional File 6 and
Table 1). To search for functional sites shared by
OsZIFL putative proteins, we used MEME (http://
meme.nbcr.net/) to identify conserved motifs in their
amino acid sequences [49]. We found eleven motifs
shared by almost all 13 OsZIFL proteins, with few
exceptions (Table 2, Figure 5A). Seven motifs matched
the general MFS_1 motif in InterProScan (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/) (motifs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6,
7 and 9), while four showed no hits (motifs 3, 8, 10, and

11) (Table 2). The ZIFL signatures Cys motif and His
motif are located within the motif 8 and motif 2, respectively (Table 2).
OsZIFL1, OsZIFL2, OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL10 and
OsZIFL12 have all eleven motifs, while the duplicated
pair OsZIFL8-OsZIFL13 and their duplicated copy in
chromosome 7 (OsZIFL3) lack several motifs (Figure 5A).
Some of these motifs are located in regions predicted to
be transmembrane (Figure 5A, black boxes at the top).
Further characterization is needed to determine if the
duplicated rice ZIFL genes are becoming pseudogenes or
acquiring new functions.
The OsZIFL4 duplicated copy OsZIFL9 lacks the
N-terminal motif 8 and the C-terminal motif 10; OsZIFL6
lacks motif 8 and its duplicated copy OsZIFL11 lacks
motif 6 and motif 10; the duplicated pair OsZIFL7 and
OsZIFL12 only differ by the C-terminal motifs 4 and 10,
which are absent in OsZIFL7 (Figure 5A). These differences suggest a divergence process between duplicated

pairs. Moreover, it is clear that the central motifs are more
conserved than those located at the N- and C-terminal
regions of OsZIFL proteins (Figure 5A).
We also observed a variable region between motifs
1 and 2 which did not show significant pattern conservation in OsZIFL proteins (Figure 5A). This region is
located between transmembrane regions 6 and 7 (considering 12 TM proteins) and is a cytoplasmic loop according to Conpred II predictions (Figure 1B). The variable
region is preceded by the conserved His motif P-E-T-LH-x-H (Figure 1B). Variable regions are found in transporters and could be involved in transport or sensing
functions [50,51]. The whole set of 68 ZIFL proteins
used in this work was submitted to MEME analysis to
find any conserved motifs specifically in the variable
region. Three motifs were found in this region and
named motifs A, B and C (Table 2; Figure 5B). None
matched any known motif in the InterPro database
(Table 2). We indicated proteins that contain each motif

in our phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) and showed their
positions in rice ZIFL protein sequences (Figure 5A).
Rice ZIFL proteins contain motifs A and B in their variable region, but not motifs C.
Motif A is present in proteins from the Monocot I,
Monocot II, Dicot and Bryophyte-Lycophyte groups
(Figure 1). This motif shows low amino acid conservation (Figure 5B). The negatively charged glutamic acid
(E) residue in the seventh position of the motif is the
most conserved residue. Conserved negatively charged
residues are also found in the fourth position (glutamic
or aspartic acid, E or D). Between these positions, two
non-polar residues, alanine (A) and leucine (L) are also
conserved (Figure 5B). Other positions containing a
positively-charged residue of lysine (K), a negatively
charged glutamic acid (E), and residues of leucine (L)
and glycine (G), although less conserved, are present
(Figure 5B). Charged positions could be involved in
transporter specificity, as already described for cation
diffusion facilitator (CDF) proteins [52]. Motif B is
shared only by a sub-group of six proteins from monocot II (Figure 2). The fifth and seventh positions of
this motif contain one positively charged residue and
one hydrophobic residue, lysine (K) and leucine (L)
(Figure 4B). Polar residues of serine (S), glutamine (Q)
and tyrosine (Y), non-polar tryptophan (W) and proline
(P) are also observed (Figure 4B). The motif C is common to 10 proteins from the Monocot I group (Figure 2), and is similar to motif A, showing the two
glutamic acids (E) separated by one instead of two nonpolar residues (Figure 5B). However, since only a small
number of proteins share motifs B and C, we should be
cautious on making assumptions about the functionality
of conserved amino acids found in these motifs, as their
conservation could be an effect of phylogenetic relatedness and not of evolutionary constraints.
Importantly, it is possible to observe the high divergence of the variable region even when comparing these
three motifs. The variability is much higher in this
region than in the whole sequence of ZIFL proteins, as
MEME analysis revealed several motifs shared by all the
68 ZIFL proteins (data not shown). Therefore, these
motifs in the cytoplasmic loop could be involved in specific functions of different ZIFL proteins.
Expression of OsZIFL genes in rice vegetative and
reproductive organs

We analyzed the expression levels of OsZIFL transcripts in
several rice organs by qPCR, including roots, culms and
shoots (vegetative tissues); flag-leaves and whole panicles
(reproductive tissues), both during R3 (panicle exertion),
R5 (grain filling) and R7 (grain dry down) stages (Figure 6).
Throughout our qPCR experiments, OsZIFL1, OsZIFL6,
OsZIFL8, OsZIFL11 and OsZIFL13 transcripts were not

Page 9 of 22

detected or were detected below a confidence threshold
for analysis. The expression levels of OsZIFL genes varied
considerably, with some genes reaching higher expression
levels (OsZIFL2 and OsZIFL4, Figures 6A and 6C) and
others showing very low expression (OsZIFL3, OsZIFL9,
OsZIFL5 and OsZIFL7; Figures 6B, 6D, 6E and 6G).
OsZIFL2 and OsZIFL3, although not resultant of a duplication event, share a similar pattern of expression: both
are more expressed in leaves and also accumulate in the
later stages of flag-leaf development, reaching the highest
levels in R7 (Figures 6A and 6B).
When analyzing gene pairs, we observed that
OsZIFL4 is almost specifically expressed in roots, showing only little expression in panicles during the R7 stage
(Figure 6C), while its duplicated copy OsZIFL9 is not
expressed in vegetative tissues nor in flag-leaves, but is
detected at low levels in panicles during R5 and at
higher levels during R7 (Figure 6D). Transcripts from
the OsZIFL5-OsZIFL10 pair show similar patterns of
expression, especially when considering the reproductive
organs flag-leaves and panicles (Figures 6E and 6F).
OsZIFL5 and OsZIFL10 are both induced from R3 to
R5 in flag-leaves, maintaining high levels at R7. In panicles, they are also induced from R3 to R5, although
OsZIFL10 transcript levels are further induced from
R5 to R7 (Figures 6E and 6F). In vegetative tissues,
OsZIFL5 levels are higher in roots, while OsZIFL10 is
more expressed in shoots (Figures 6E and 6F).
The genes from the OsZIFL7-OsZIFL12 pair also show
similar expression patterns in the organs analyzed.
OsZIFL7 is more expressed in culms and leaves, accumulates from R3 to R5 in flag-leaves and decreases its
expression from R3 to R5 during panicle development
(Figure 6G). The OsZIFL12 transcript accumulates in
leaves and also increases from R3 to R5 in flag-leaves
and decreases from R3 to R5 in panicles (Figure 6H).
Taken together, our gene expression data demonstrates
that, even after duplication and divergence, most OsZIFL
genes still share similar expression patterns in rice
organs within gene pairs.
The Fe-deficiency element IDE1 is enriched in promoters
of OsZIFL genes

To investigate the presence of conserved cis-elements in
promoter regions of OsZIFL genes, we used the POCO
tool [53]. This approach consisted in comparing the
-1,500 to +1 regions of OsZIFL genes to several random
samples of promoters from the entire Arabidopsis genome with the same size (each sample composed of
13 promoters). If a cis-element is more often found in
the promoters of OsZIFL genes than in a random set of
promoters, this cis-element is enriched in these
sequences. The POCO analysis revealed that the
sequence CATGC is enriched in our promoter set when

compared to Arabidopsis promoters. This sequence is
the core binding site of IDEF1 (iron-deficiency responsive element-binding factor 1), a transcription factor of
the ABI3/VP1 family involved in Fe-deficiency response
in rice [30,54]. As Arabidopsis is not closely related to
rice and thus the motif frequency in promoters could
vary between these species, we confirmed the enrichment by counting the average number of CATGC boxes
in nearly 25,000 promoters of rice downloaded from
Osiris (http://www.bioinformatics2.wsu.edu/cgi-bin/
Osiris/cgi/home.pl) [55]. While the average number of
the CATGC sequences in rice promoters was 3.24,
in promoters of the thirteen OsZIFL genes it was
5.85 boxes per promoter. Some promoters are highly
enriched for CATGC boxes, such as OsZIFL2 (7 boxes),
OsZIFL10 (8 boxes), OsZIFL4 (9 boxes) and OsZIFL9
(10 boxes) (Figure 7). Genes that were not detected in our
qPCR experiments such as OsZIFL8 and OsZIFL1
also have promoters enriched in CATGC boxes (11 and
6, respectively) (Figure 7). OsZIFL5, OsZIFL6 and
OsZIFL7 promoters show 5 boxes each (Figure 7).
Since the CATGC box is the core motif of IDE1, we
searched for IDE1-like sequences in promoters of
OsZIFL genes following the method described by
Kobayashi et al. [56]. We found eleven IDE1-like motifs
distributed in seven gene promoters, OsZIFL1, OsZIFL4,
OsZIFL7, OsZIFL8, OsZIFL9, OsZIFL10 and OsZIFL12
(Figure 7). OsZIFL4 shows three sequences, two of them
overlapping with CATGC boxes, while OsZIFL8 and
OsZIFL9 show two IDE1-like motifs (Figure 7). Considering that the motif is 18 bp long, it is surprising to find
such a high number of IDE1-like motifs in our promoter set. The enrichment for CATGC and IDE1-like

sequences in promoters of OsZIFL genes suggests that
they are possibly regulated by Fe-deficiency.
Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency regulate OsZIFL expression
mainly in rice roots

It has been demonstrated that AtZIF1 is up-regulated by
Zn-excess in roots and leaves of Arabidopsis plants, as
well as by Fe-deficiency [34,57,58]. As promoters of
OsZIFL genes are enriched for Fe-deficiency cis-elements, we submitted rice plants to Zn-excess (200 μM)
for three days and to Fe-deficiency (no Fe added to
nutrient solution) for seven days. OsZIFL mRNA expression level was evaluated by qPCR in roots and leaves
from both experiments.
Several OsZIFL genes were up-regulated in roots of Znexcess treated plants: OsZIFL2, OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5,
OsZIFL10, OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 (Figure 8). Expression
of OsZIFL1, OsZIFL3, OsZIFL9 and of the duplicated pairs
OsZIFL6-OsZIFL11 and OsZIFL8-OsZIFL13 was not
detected. Expression of OsZIFL4, which is nearly root-specific (Figure 6C), is induced 3.5-fold by Zn-excess
(Figure 8B). Both OsZIFL5 and OsZIFL10, a duplicated
pair, are also up-regulated by 2- and 3-fold, respectively
(Figures 8C and 8D). OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 show different patterns of induction, with OsZIFL7 induced by almost
14-fold in comparison to control levels (Figure 8E).
OsZIFL12, although induced by Zn-excess in roots, is
up-regulated only by 3-fold (Figure 8F). To confirm that
our treatment was effective, we used OsNAS1 and
OsIRO2 (Figures 8G and 8H), two genes up-regulated by
Zn-excess in rice roots [59]. Therefore, the OsZIFL genes
which are expressed in roots are up-regulated under
Zn-excess.

A very different expression pattern of OsZIFL genes
was observed in leaves under Zn-excess: expression of
OsZIFL2, OsZIFL3, OsZIFL5 and OsZIFL10 was not
affected (Figures 9A, 9B, 9C and 9D). Only OsZIFL7 and
OsZIFL12 mRNA levels were altered under Zn-excess:
1.4-fold and 3.3-fold higher than in the control treatment,
respectively (Figures 9E and 9F). The OsZIFL7 and
OsZIFL12 genes are a duplicated pair and are also upregulated by Zn-excess in roots, suggesting a strong
co-regulation under these conditions in both organs.
However, most OsZIFL genes seem to be differentially
regulated in leaves compared to roots when plants are
under excessive Zn concentrations.
OsZIFL expression was also regulated in roots of
plants under Fe-deficiency. Expression of OsZIFL2 and
OsZIFL10 was not significantly increased by the treatment (Figures 10A and 10D). OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5,
OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12, however, were up-regulated by
1.8 to 2-fold (Figures 10B, 10C, 10E and 10F). This

effect occurred in parallel with increased expression of
OsIRT1 (2.8-fold), a gene already described as responsive
to Fe-deficiency in rice roots [60,61]. This demonstrates
that the plants were indeed under Fe-deficient conditions. Moreover, all four genes regulated by Fedeficiency in roots were also induced by Zn-excess (Figure 8), confirming a trend for common responses to
both stresses in this organ, as previously reported [59].
A completely different response to Fe-deficiency was
observed in leaves. None of the OsZIFL genes showed upregulation under this condition (Figure 11A-F), although
expression of the OsIRO2 gene, was up-regulated by
5.6-fold (Figure 11G). It is known that OsIRO2 is induced
by Fe-deficiency in leaves [62]. This is, however, similar to
OsZIFL gene expression in leaves of Zn-excess-treated
plants (Figure 9): although six OsZIFL genes were
expressed, only OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 were up-regulated,
while all other family members did not change their
expression levels. Considering the results obtained with
Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency, it is possible to suggest that
transcriptional regulation of most OsZIFL genes is more
important in roots than in leaves, regardless of the level of
expression in control conditions.

OsZIFL duplicated pairs are co-expressed in specific plant
organs and in response to stresses

of both OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 in flag leaves and panicles and lower in roots (Figures 6G and 6H). The pair
OsZIFL8 and OsZIFL13, which had no detected expression in our qPCR experiments, was evaluated using specific probes. While OsZIFL13 showed no expression,
low expression of OsZIFL8 was observed in shoot tissues. Although qPCR will never generate the large
amount of data that is achieved by cDNA microarrays,
PCR has the advantage of unparalleled sensitivity, and
therefore slight discrepancies are expected [64].
OsZIFL duplicated pairs also show co-expression under
stress conditions (Figure 13). OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 are
highly up-regulated by arsenate in roots of an arsenatetolerant (Bala) and an arsenate-sensitive (Azucena) cultivars (Figure 13) [65]. This suggests that these transporters could be responsive to general stress, as they are also
up-regulated by Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency (Figures 8E

To analyze the expression pattern of OsZIFL genes
based on microarray meta-analysis, we used Genevestigator [63]. Affymetrix unique probes used for expression
analyses of OsZIFL2, OsZIFL3, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL7,
OsZIFL8, OsZIFL10, OsZIFL12 and OsZIFL13 are listed
in Additional File 7. The available data on expression of
OsZIFL genes in different organs of rice plants is shown
in Figure 12. Clearly, the expression pattern within each
one of the duplicated gene pairs OsZIFL5-OsZIFL10 and
OsZIFL7-OsZIFL12 cluster together, indicating their
overlapping expression. According to microarray data,
OsZIFL5 and OsZIFL10 are highly expressed in seed tissues, while OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 are expressed in
reproductive organs and shoot tissues (Figure 12). Similarly, our qPCR experiments showed higher expression

and 8F; 9E and 9F, 10E and 10F). OsZIFL2 is also responsive to arsenate (Figure 13). OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 are
also up-regulated under drought and salt stresses (Figure 13). OsZIFL5 and OsZIFL10 are mostly co-expressed,
although no marked increase or decrease in expression
was observed for both genes (Figure 13). The microarray
results indicate a strong co-expression of the recently
duplicated gene pairs OsZIFL7-OsZIFL12 and OsZIFL5OsZIFL10, in accordance with our qPCR data.

Discussion
ZIFL expansion through segmental duplication

Phenotypic variation is not necessarily the result of
entirely new genes. Instead, redundancy generated through

Ricachenevsky et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/20

gene duplication can be the source of evolutionary novelty.
Plants are highly susceptible to duplication events, as most
(if not all) have experienced whole-genome duplication
events in their evolutionary past, as well as tandem and
segmental duplications [66,67]. After duplication, gene
copies can follow (1) neofunctionalization, where one copy
maintains the ancestral function and the other can explore
new evolutionary terrain; (2) pseudogenization, where one
copy accumulates mutations and lose function while the
other maintains the ancestral function; (3) subfunctionalization, in which deleterious mutations make one copy to
be partially functional, but complementary to the other (i.
e. in regard to the ancestral gene) [67,68]. As deleterious
mutations are expected to be more common than beneficial ones, subfunctionalization is considered to be a more
common fate for duplicated copies than neofunctionalization, and examples are already known [69,70]. These
mutations are also more common in regulatory regions (i.
e. promoters) than in functional motifs, where selective
pressure is stronger; therefore, changes in expression patterns and/or changes in the responses to stimuli are probably more frequent [68].
In this work, we described the ZIFL protein family in
plants, which is part of the MFS superfamily. We suggested that ZIFL proteins experienced an expansion in
the monocot lineage, as we found three to four gene
copies in dicots and eight up to thirteen in monocots,
with all monocot paralogs grouping together (Figure 2).
We further characterized the genomic organization of
ZIFL genes in rice, and found that ten out of thirteen
copies are located in a duplicated region of chromosomes 11 and 12 (Figure 3A). This region was first
described as a recent segmental duplication, estimated
from five to seven MYA [11,18]. This estimation was
based on the high degree of similarity between terminal
segments of both chromosomes (Figure 3). However,
recent data showed that the duplication of this genomic
segment is ancestral to the split of S. bicolor, B. distachyon and rice [14,19]. Wang et al. proposed that three
rounds of unequal crossing-over events have produced
the high similarity observed [9]. Thus, variation in
sequence similarity within these regions reflects rather
the antiquity of the unequal crossing-over events, than
the date of segmental duplication as suggested earlier
[11,18]. Gene conversion is also occurring at high frequencies within this region, further contributing for the
maintenance of high similarity [9,13,15]. Using paralog
pairs within the 3 Mb of chromosomes 11 and 12 from
all species in the Oryza genus, a recent work demonstrated that concerted evolution is recurrent in this
region for Oryza species [19]. Gene conversion was specifically found between OsZIFL4 and OsZIFL9 in indica
rice, suggesting that concerted evolution has participated
in the evolution of ZIFL genes [9].

Page 15 of 22

We also demonstrated that the region where S. bicolor
ZIFL genes are located in chromosome 8 is inverted in
relation to its homologous region in rice chromosome
12 (Figures 3B and 3C). This inverted region was
recently described for both S. bicolor and B. distachyon,
encompassing 0.8 Mb [19]. S. bicolor ZIFL gene pairs
are not as similar as rice paralogs, indicating that
S. bicolor ZIFL genes probably did not undergo the
same degree of concerted evolution as rice paralogs (i.e.
unequal crossing-over and gene conversion). In agreement with that, Wang et al. used paralog quartets from
rice and S. bicolor (i.e. a duplicated gene pair from rice
and their homologs from S. bicolor) to search for gene
conversions. They found that OsZIFL4 and OsZIFL9
went through whole gene conversion after the split
between rice and S. bicolor, while S. bicolor homologs
did not show conversion (in their supplemental table)
[15]. Inversions are known to reduce the probability of
recombination and to facilitate the maintenance of differences between interbreeding populations [71,72].
These results suggest that the inversion observed in
S. bicolor reduced the probability of concerted evolution
in the SbZIFL genes when compared to rice paralogs.
Sequence and expression analyses suggest new
functional sites in OsZIFL proteins and insights about
duplicated gene pairs

Our analysis on motif composition of OsZIFL proteins also
revealed interesting features of this family in rice. Together
with the exon-intron organization (Figure 4), motif composition of duplicated genes OsZIFL8 and OsZIFL13 and
their partial duplicated copy OsZIFL3 suggests that these
genes are diverging in a higher rate when compared to
other OsZIFL paralogs. They all show no ZIFL signature
Cys motif C-P-G-C (Additional File 4). OsZIFL3 and
OsZIFL8 also lack the MFS signature and OsZIFL13 lacks
both MFS and antiporter signatures (Additional File 4).
OsZIFL3 expression was detected in leaves, but at relatively
low levels (Figure 6B). OsZIFL8 and OsZIFL13 transcripts
were not detected in any of our qPCR experiments, and
cDNAs corresponding to them are not present at the
KOME database (http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/PIPE/).
However, microarray metadata showed low expression
of OsZIFL8 in shoots, although no expression of OsZIFL13
was detected in all plant organs evaluated (Figure 12).
Further experiments should clarify if these genes are gaining new functions or accumulating mutations to become
pseudogenes.
A variable region, which corresponds to a cytoplasmic
loop, occupies a central position in the OsZIFL proteins
(Figures 1B, 5A and Additional File 6). There is very
low amino acid conservation within this loop. For this
reason, we were able to find conserved motifs within the
variable region only when using the whole ZIFL protein

Ricachenevsky et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/20

dataset in our analyses (Figure 5B). Variable regions are
often found in transporters [50,51]. In the ZIP family
(Zinc-regulated/Iron-regulated transporter Proteins), a
variable region is considered to be the metal-binding
site, as these loops are rich in histidine residues [50,51].
Our motif analysis in the ZIFL variable region detected
some residues in conserved positions. In the CDF
family, substrate specificity was proposed to be determined by few amino acids, normally histidine (H) or
aspartic acid (D), which are, respectively, positively and
negatively charged [52]. In OsZIFL proteins, lysine (K)
and glutamic acid (E), also positive and negative residues, seem to be conserved in the variable loop
(Figure 4B), although aspartic acid (D) and leucine (L)
are also frequent (Figure 5B). This region and its conserved residues emerge as candidates for mutagenesis
studies to clarify their importance in substrate transport,
although no substrate was proven to be transported by
ZIFL proteins [34]. Moreover, we described conserved
motifs specific to ZIFL proteins (Figure 1B), which also
contain candidate residues for site-directed mutagenesis
studies.
We characterized the expression of OsZIFL genes in
rice vegetative and reproductive organs (Figure 6) and
compared the expression patterns of three duplicated gene pairs, OsZIFL4-OsZIFL9, OsZIFL5-OsZIFL10
and OsZIFL7-OsZIFL12 (Figure 6). OsZIFL4 and
OsZIFL9 are both expressed in panicles at R7 stage, but
only OsZIFL4 is expressed in roots (Figures 6C and 6D).
This partial overlap suggests that their ancestral gene
was at least expressed in panicles at R7 and in roots, as
deleterious mutations could be subfunctionalizing
OsZIFL9 (i.e. turning into a panicle-specific gene) while
OsZIFL4 maintains both panicle and root expression.
However, neofunctionalization of OsZIFL4 cannot be
discarded. In agreement with that, Throude et al.
showed that, from 115 duplicated gene pairs, the vast
majority have been neofunctionalized or subfunctionalized, as 88%, 89% and 96% of duplicates, respectively
expressed in grain, leaf and root, show distinct expression patterns [73]. A recent work in rice showed that
the average number of conserved motifs between duplicated gene pairs declines with increased expression
diversity, partially supporting the subfunctionalization
model [74]. This is in accordance with the observed
divergent expression of OsZIFL4 and OsZIFL9 and their
motif composition, because OsZIFL9 has lost one
N-terminal and two C-terminal motifs (Figure 5A).
Expression patterns within the gene pairs OsZIFL5OsZIFL10 and OsZIFL7-OsZIFL12 are similar (Figure 6),
and both OsZIFL5 and OsZIFL10 have the same motif
composition (Figure 5A). OsZIFL12 has two C-terminal
motifs which are lacking in OsZIFL7 (Figure 5A), but
expression of OsZIFL7 and OsZIFL12 is quite similar, as

Page 16 of 22

both are up-regulated in roots and leaves under
Zn-excess (Figures 8E, 8F, 9E and 9F) and in roots
under Fe-deficiency (Figures 10E and 10F). Microarray
data also shows that the OsZIFL duplicated pairs
OsZIFL5-OsZIFL10 and OsZIFL7-OsZIFL12 are coexpressed in the same plant organs and under the same
treatments (Figures 12 and 13). Yim et al. showed that
duplicated gene pairs with high local similarity (HLS)
segments show higher expression correlations than gene
pairs without these segments [74]. This probably results
in an increased likelihood of gene conversion in promoters of gene pairs harboring HLS [74]. As gene conversion is known to homogenize sequences in multigene
families, this probably explains the similar expression
patterns of OsZIFL pairs, although it is established that
duplicated gene pairs tend to rapidly diverge in their
expression patterns [12,13,75].
Expression of OsZIFL genes is involved in the partially
overlapping pathways of Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency
responses

Ten out of thirteen OsZIFL genes are found in two tandem groups of five genes in rice chromosomes 11 and
12, probably as a result of repeatedly tandem duplication
events. This size of tandemly arrayed genes was estimated to be very rare, as only 7% of gene arrays in the
rice genome have more than three genes [76]. Tandem
duplication events have a tendency to be retained when
involving genes for which fluctuation in copy number is
unlikely to affect downstream genes, such as those at
the end of or in flexible steps of pathways [76]. In Arabidopsis and rice, tandemly arrayed genes are enriched
for membrane proteins and genes with function on
abiotic and biotic stresses [76]. Moreover, tandemly
arrayed genes often share regulatory cis-elements and
tend to be expressed in a coordinated manner, as well
as family members with HLS generated through gene
conversion [74,77]. These observations are in accordance with the up-regulation of OsZIFL members under
Zn-excess or Fe-deficiency, some of which show strong
up-regulation upon stress imposition, mostly in roots
(Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11). It also agrees with the enrichment observed for CATGC and IDE1-like elements in
OsZIFL promoter sequences (Figure 7). Enrichment for
the CATGC-box is related to Fe-deficiency responses in
rice [30,78]. The rice specific gene OsMIR is strongly
up-regulated by Fe-deficiency and shows 10 CATGCboxes in its promoter sequence [78]. In another work,
CATGC was shown to be enriched in promoters of
genes regulated by OsIDEF1, an upstream transcription
factor involved in the early response to Fe-deficiency
[30]. Thus, OsZIFL genes which are responsive to Fedeficiency are potentially under the same control network, although more data is necessary to confirm this

Ricachenevsky et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/20

hypothesis. Moreover, a similar up-regulation pattern is
also observed in the Arabidopsis AtZIF1 gene, which is
also responsive to both Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency
[34,57,58]. This suggests that OsZIFL genes which are
responsive to both stresses could have conserved regulatory sequences in comparison to AtZIF1.
Partial overlap between Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency
response has been reported [59]. Zn-excess treated
plants show much higher concentrations of Fe in roots,
but slightly decreased Fe in shoots and inhibited expression of OsFER1 [59]. This indicates that Zn-excess
causes Fe-deficiency due to mislocalization of the available Fe [59]. On the other hand, Fe-deficiency can cause
Zn-excess, as Fe regulated transporters such as
OsIRT1 are suggested to transport Zn and Arabidopsis
plants under Fe-deficiency accumulate excessive Zn
[39,79]. It was also demonstrated that 13.75% of the Znexcess up-regulated genes in roots are also up-regulated
by Fe-deficiency, further indicating an overlap between
these stresses [59]. Excessive Zn was also shown to
induce more genes in rice roots than in shoots, as
400 genes were induced in roots, while only 54 in
shoots of Arabidopsis plants under Zn-excess [59].
OsIRO2, a bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) transcription factor induced by Fe-deficiency, is the regulator of
Fe-deficiency responsive genes in roots, such as the
genes OsNAS1 (nicotianamine synthase 1), OsNAS2,
OsNAAT1 (nicotianamine amino-transferase 1),
OsDMAS1 (deoxymugineic acid synthase 1) and the
DMA-Fe 3+ transporter OsYSL15 [80]. Expression of
OsIRO2 was shown to be up-regulated by and to control
the induction of these genes under Zn-excess [59].
However, OsIRT1, a classical Fe-deficiency-regulated
gene, is not regulated by OsIRO2 [80], and is not upregulated under Zn-excess [59]. These results indicate
that OsIRO2 is in the crosslink between Zn-excess and
Fe-deficiency responses. The OsIRO2 binding site
CACGTGG is not found in OsZIFL promoters, but our
qPCR data shows that OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL7 and
OsZIFL12 are up-regulated in roots by both stresses
(Figures 8 and 10). Considering our results, it is possible
to suggest that OsZIFL genes are part of the overlapping
pathway that links Fe-deficiency and Zn-excess,
although regulators different from OsIRO2 may control
their expression. One of these regulators could be
IDEF1 [54].

Conclusions
As the first description of the ZIFL family in plants, this
work is the basis for functional studies, especially in
rice. We have shed light onto the unusual genomic distribution of OsZIFL genes, and made suggestions about
the evolutionary forces that shaped the high degree of
similarity between them. We also characterized in detail

Page 17 of 22

the motif composition of rice OsZIFL genes and the
expression patterns in different rice organs and under
stress conditions. More functional data, such as loss-offunction mutants, sub cellular localization and ligand
specificity, are necessary to uncover the specific roles of
each protein and to know to what extent they are functionally redundant, as well as to clarify the roles of
OsZIFL genes in the homeostasis of Zn and Fe in rice.

Methods
Plant material and treatments

Rice seeds of the Nipponbare cultivar were germinated
for four days in petri dishes, soaked in distilled water at
28°C (two days in the dark, two days in the light). After
germination, seedlings were transferred to holders positioned over plastic pots with five liters of nutrient solution (16 seedlings per pot) containing 700 μM K2SO4,
100 μM KCl, 100 μM KH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM Ca(NO 3 ) 2 ,
500 μM MgSO4, 10 μM H3BO3, 0.5 μM MnSO4, 0.5 μM
ZnSO 4 , 0.2 μM CuSO 4 , 0.01 μM (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 , and
100 μM Fe+3 -EDTA. The pH of the nutrient solution
was adjusted to 5.4. Plants were kept at 28°C ± 1°C
under photoperiod of 16h/8h light/dark (150 μmol.m-2.s1
). Solutions were replaced every 3-4 days.
For expression analyses in vegetative organs, samples
of roots, leaves and culms were collected at the four-leaf
stage (approximately 30 days of growth). For expression
analyses in reproductive organs, plants were grown in
soil under flooded conditions in an experimental unit at
IRGA (Instituto Rio-Grandense do Arroz), in Cachoeirinha, RS, Brazil (29°54’58.61’’S 51°10’02.65’’W), during
the rice growing season (October 2007 to March 2008).
Soil characteristics of this site were reported by Stein
et al. [36]. Samples of flag-leaves and panicles were collected during R3 (panicle exertion), R5 (grain filling)
and R7 (grain dry-down) stages, according to Counce
et al. [81]. Laboratory grown plants at the four-leaf stage
were submitted to Zn-excess or to Fe-deficiency. For
Zn-excess, plants were kept in 200 μM of ZnSO 4 for
3 days. For Fe-deficiency, Fe+3-EDTA was omitted from
nutrient solution and samples were collected after
7 days. In all experiments, three biological samples composed of at least three plants each were used for gene
expression analyses.
Sequence retrieval and databases

Sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana AtZIF1
(AT5G13740), AtZIFL1 (AT5G13750) and AtZIFL2
(AT3G43790) proteins were downloaded from the TAIR
database (The Arabidopsis Information Resource, http://
www.arabidopsis.org/) and used as queries to search the
rice genome at the TIGR Rice Genome database (http://
rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) for ZIFL sequences using
tBLASTn and BLASTp. Sequences with an expected

Ricachenevsky et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/20

value lower than 1 × 10 -30 and harboring more than
30% of similarity considering 30% of the sequence were
selected. Both Arabidopsis and rice sequences were then
used as queries to survey the genomes of Vitis vinifera,
Populus trichocarpa, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium
distachyon, Zea mays, Selaginella moellendorffii and
Physcomitrella patens at the Phytozome database
(http://www.phytozome.net/), using the same criteria as
above. All plant sequences found (plus the previously
known Arabidopsis sequences) were aligned and used as
an input to build an HMM profile using the HMMER
package [82]. The ZIFL HMM profile consensus
sequence was used to re-search the listed genomes. As
new sequences were found, the procedure was repeated
iteratively until no new sequence appeared. To visualize
the ZIFL HMM profile and the conserved motifs we
used LogoMat M [83]. Alignments of ZIFL profile to
MFS_1 HMM profile were performed using LogoMat P
[84]. Individual sequences were manually curated to discard those of poor quality or incomplete (not starting
with methionine or not having a stop codon). Accession
numbers, given nomenclature, chromosome and genomic positions and predicted number of transmembrane
domains (TMs) of ZIF-like proteins are shown in Additional File 1. Two unnanotated ZIFL genes from Zea
mays were predicted using Fgenesh (http://www.softberry.com) and their given nomenclature, chromosome
and genomic positions, exon coordinates and predicted
number of TMs are shown in Additional File 2.
Sequences from MFS_1 proteins from each monocot
and dicot species analyzed in this work were retrieved
using the same method as for ZIFL protein sequences.
The consensus sequence generated from the HMM profile of MFS_1 (Pfam number PF07690) was used to
search the genomes. All locus numbers of MFS_1 genes
used are given in Additional File 8.
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses for ZIFL
proteins were performed using the MEGA (Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) 4.1 package [85]. Protein multiple alignments were obtained with ClustalW
and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the
neighbor-joining method and the following parameteres:
pairwise deletion option, 1,000 replicates of bootstrap
and Poisson correction distance. The consensus tree
shows only branches with a bootstrap consensus >50.
Bayesian analysis was applied to generate a posterior
probability distribution using the Metropolis-coupled
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with MrBayes
3.0b4 [86,87]. The search was run for 1 × 106 generations, and every 100th tree was sampled. Posterior probabilities for each branch were calculated from the
sampled trees. Sequence alignments of MFS_1 proteins

Page 18 of 22

were performed using MEGA 4.1 package, and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the neighbor-joining
method, following the same parameters described above.
For genomic alignments, we used a 100 kb region from
rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and S. bicolor chromosomes
5 and 8 spanning the tandemly repeated ZIFL genes
regions in both species. The graphic alignment tool for
comparative sequence analysis (GATA) was used to align
the sequences and visualize the results [88]. GATA uses
BLASTn to compare a reference to a comparative
sequence. A sliding window of predefined size slides
through the reference sequence and aligns it to the comparative sequence. Matches are shown in black for forward hits (+/+) and in red for reverse hits (+/-). We used
a window size of 24 and a lower cutoff score of 80. The
default values were used for the other settings.
Exon-intron determination, motif finding and promoter
analysis

For determining exon-intron organization, genomic and
coding sequences (predicted, cDNA when available) were
aligned. To search for conserved motifs in ZIF-like proteins, MEME (Motif EM for Motif Elicitation - http://
meme.nbcr.net/ [49]) was used, with the following parameters: zero or one motif per sequence, 6 and 300 amino
acids as minimum and maximum sizes of motifs. Only
motifs with expected value lower than 1 × 10 -20 were
considered. For motifs within the variable region, the
e-value cutoff was increased to 1X 10 -10 due to high
sequence divergence. The best possible match of each
motif was searched in the InterPro database (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/interpro/). To identify the transmembrane
domains of ZIFL proteins we used Conpred II (http://
bioinfo.si.hirosaki-u.ac.jp/~ConPred2/), a consensus prediction method for obtaining transmembrane topology
models. Promoter sequences from -1,500 bp to +1 bp of
each rice ZIF-like gene were extracted from the TIGR
Rice Genome database. Different strategies were used to
find regulatory sequences within the promoters of OsZIFlike genes. POCO was used to compare the promoter
dataset to the Arabidopsis thaliana clean background, the
closest species available for this tool [53]. POCO was run
with default settings, except for the pattern length
selected as 5 bp. To confirm that over-represented motifs
in comparison to Arabidopsis background are also overrepresented when compared to rice background, the
-1,500 bp to +1 bp promoter region of nearly 25,000 rice
genes were downloaded from the Osiris database (http://
www.bioinformatics2.wsu.edu/cgi-bin/Osiris/cgi/home.pl/
[55]) and evaluated for average number of motifs.
Genevestigator

We used only specific Affymetrix probes for rice ZIF
genes (Additional File 7) to analyze expression data

Ricachenevsky et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/20

from GENEVESTIGATOR (http://www.genevestigator.
com) [63]. Only high quality arrays were used.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Rice tissues were harvested from plants grown under
laboratory or field conditions as described above. Total
RNA was extracted using the Concert Plant RNA
Reagent (Invitrogen®, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and treated
with DNase I (Invitrogen®, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA
was prepared using the SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis
Kit by Clontech ® Laboratories (Mountain View, CA,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with oligo
dT and reverse transcriptase (M-MLV, Invitrogen ® ,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) using 1 μg of RNA.
Quantitative RT-PCR and data analysis

For quantitative RT-PCR analysis (qPCR), the synthesized
first strand cDNA from each time point was diluted
100 times. qPCR was carried out in an Applied Biosystems StepOne real-time cycler. All primers (listed in
Additional File 9) were designed to amplify 100-150 bp
of the 3’-UTR of the genes and to have similar Tm values
(60 ± 2°C). Reaction settings were composed of an initial
denaturation step of 5 min at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles
of 10 s at 94°C, 15 s at 60°C, 15 s at 72°C; samples were
held for 2 min at 60°C for annealing of the amplified products and then heated from 60 to 99°C with a ramp of
0.3°C/s to provide the denaturing curve of the amplified
products. qPCRs were carried out in 20 μl final volume
composed of 10 μl of each reverse transcription sample
diluted 100 times, 2 μl of 10X PCR buffer, 1.2 μl of
50 mM MgCl2, 0.1 μl of 5 mM dNTPs, 0.4 μl of 10 μM
primer pairs, 4.25 μl of water, 2.0 μl of SYBR green
(1:10,000, Molecular Probe), and 0.05 μl of Platinum Taq
DNA polymerase (5 U/μl, Invitrogen ®, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Obtained data were analyzed using the comparative Ct (threshold cycle) method [89]. The PCR efficiency
from the exponential phase (E) was calculated for each
individual amplification plot using the LinRegPCR
software [90]. In each plate, the average of PCR efficiency
for each amplicon was determined and used in further
calculations. Ct values for all genes were normalized to
the Ct value of UBQ5 [91]. The equation Q0 target gene/
Q0 UBQ5 = [(Eff UBQ5) Ct UBQ5/(Eff target gene) Ct target gene],
where Q 0 corresponds to the initial amount of transcripts, was used for normalization [89]. Each data point
corresponds to three true biological replicate samples.
