Abstract
Background: Serine proteases (SPs) and serine proteases homologs (SPHs) are a large group of proteolytic enzymes,
with important roles in a variety of physiological processes, such as cell signalling, defense and development. Genomewide identification and expression analysis of serine proteases and their homologs in the silkworm might provide
valuable information about their biological functions.
Results: In this study, 51 SP genes and 92 SPH genes were systematically identified in the genome of the silkworm
Bombyx mori. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that six gene families have been amplified species-specifically in the
silkworm, and the members of them showed chromosomal distribution of tandem repeats. Microarray analysis
suggests that many silkworm-specific genes, such as members of SP_fam12, 13, 14 and 15, show expression patterns
that are specific to tissues or developmental stages. The roles of SPs and SPHs in resisting pathogens were investigated
in silkworms when they were infected by Escherichia coli, Bacillus bombysepticus, Batrytis bassiana and B. mori
nucleopolyhedrovirus, respectively. Microarray experiment and real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that 18 SP or SPH
genes were significantly up-regulated after pathogen induction, suggesting that SP and SPH genes might participate
in pathogenic microorganism resistance in B. mori.
Conclusion: Silkworm SP and SPH genes were identified. Comparative genomics showed that SP and SPH genes
belong to a large family, whose members are generated mainly by tandem repeat evolution. We found that silkworm
has species-specific SP and SPH genes. Phylogenetic and microarray analyses provide an overview of the silkworm SP
and SPHs, and facilitate future functional studies on these enzymes.
Background
Serine proteases (SPs) in the S1 family are involved in
physiological processes including digestion, development and defense [1-3]. X-ray crystallography studies
show that the active center of bovine chymotrypsin is
Ser195, His57, and Asp102 [4,5]. A substrate binding cleft
near the active site is the predominant factor in determining SP substrate specificity. SPs are divided into several types, including the trypsin, chymotrypsin and
elastase, based on the target scissile bond. SPs are usually
produced as zymogens. SP zymogens are sequentially
activated in a cascade pathway, with a classic example

being the blood clotting cascade and complement system
in mammalian plasma. Serine protease homologs (SPHs)
are similar to SPs in amino acid sequence, but they have
no protease activity because of losing one or more of the
catalytic residue [3,4]. In insects, SPHs participate in the
innate immune response [6,7].
Genome-wide analysis has been performed for SPs and
SPHs in Drosophila melanogaster [5]. Immunity-related
SPs and SPHs have been investigated in Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifera [3,8]. However, little is known
about these proteins in the silkworm, even though its SPs
and SPHs are involved in biological processes that
include digestion, development and immune response [912]. Tanaka et al. identified potential immunity-related
silkworm SPs and SPHs [13], but their roles require fur-

ther investigation. Changes in mRNA level during
immune response are considered evidence that a gene is
involved in an immune process. In this paper, we report
the genome-wide classification, distribution and expression profiling of B.mori SPs and SPHs based on the silkworm genome and microarray data [14,15]. The role of
SP and SPH genes in immunity has aslo been investigated. The results are expected to stimulate in-depth
analysis of silkworm SPs and SPHs.

Results and discussion
Identification and chromosome distribution of silkworm SP
and SPH genes

SP and SPH genes from Manduca sexta and other insects
were used to search the silkworm genomic sequence,
which revealed 143 serine protease genes. Analysis of
active sites showed that 51 serine protease genes have the
three active site residues intact (SP). The rest 92 serine
protease genes had mutations in the catalytic residues
(SPH), so they may have lost catalytic function (Additional file 1 and 2). Compared to 147 SP genes and 57
SPH genes in Drosophila, silkworm has 96 fewer SP genes
and 35 more SPH genes. The genes were named
BmSP(H)1-BmSP(H)143 (Additional file 1), 20 of which
had previously been submitted to GenBank, including
ovarian serine protease (GenBank Accession No.
AAL62027), cocoonase (GenBank Accession No.
ABR14241), vitellin-degrading protease precursor (GenBank Accession No. BAA03758), and alkaliphilic serine
protease P-Iic (GenBank Accession No. AAB26023)
(Additional file 3), which function in digestion, ovary and
embryo development, and formation of fibroin. The
remaining 123 genes were not reported previously. The
genes reported here represent the first catalog of silkworm SP and SPH genes. Approximately 80 (55.9%) were
found to be expressed using expressed sequence tag
(EST) data according to stringent criteria (see Materials
and Methods). The molecular weights and isoelectric
points of silkworm SPs and SPHs were widely distributed.
Predicted molecular weights were 6.3 kDa-203.6 kDa,
and predicted isoelectric points were 3.5-11.3.
In arthropods, clip-domain serine proteases and
homologs (clip-SPs and clip-SPHs) mediate innate immunity and embryonic development [13,14], and are
involved in signal-amplifying reactions [2]. Previously,
these proteases had been found only in invertebrates. We
identified 7 clip-SPs and 11 clip-SPHs in the silkworm
[13] (Additional file 4), which are consisted of a chymotrypsin-like SP domain, and one or more clip
domain(s) at the N-terminus. The SP domain amplies signals by cleaving and activating a downstream SP [16].
Activation of the Toll pathway and melanization mediated by SP cascades are the major defense mechanisms in
insects [17,18].

The updated silkworm genome has 128 SP and SPH
genes (89.5%) on 28 chromosomes, with an uneven distribution. For example, chromosome 1 and 19 have no SP
and SPH genes, while both chromosomes 17 and 22 have
one. However, chromosome 5 has 11 genes, chromosome
7 has 13, and chromosome 16 has 10 (Figure 1). Additional analysis showed that SP and SPH genes exhibit a
tandem repeat distribution on the chromosomes. For
example, there are 10 genes in nscaf3058 of chromosome
16, and BmSP18, BmSPH56, BmSPH74, BmSP142 and
BmSPH143 showed tandem repeat distribution on this
chromosome (Figure 1). Of these, BmSPH74 and
BmSP143 were closely linked. The distance between the
two genes is only 3 kb, and their sequence identities were
up to 96%. Therefore, these genes probably arose by gene
duplication.
Species-specific SP and SPH genes in the silkworm

The TRIBE-MCL clustering algorithm was used to group
the SP and SPH genes into families. Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Anopheles gambiae were included to find
members of evolutionarily conserved families, which
were defined as containing silkworm genes, and at least
one gene in another species. The results uncovered 99 SP
and SPH silkworm genes, belonging to 17 gene families,
11 of which were evolutionally conserved (Table 1).
SP_fam1 contains the most number of SP and SPH genes.
These exist in C. elegans, insects and humans, indicating
that SP_fam1 existed before the divergence of these species. SP_fam1 has two members in C. elegans, and shows
great expansion in insects and mammals. B. mori and A.
mellifera contain 24 and 28 members of SP_fam1, respectively. However, the Diptera insects D. melanogaster and
A. gambiae, have 65 and 49 SP_fam1 members, respectively. Interestingly, the other 10 evolutionarily conserved
SP and SPH gene families are insect-specific.
The silkworm genome contains 39 genes in 6 silkwormspecific SP and SPH gene families (Table 1 and Additional
file 5). If the 44 singleton SP genes are considered, 83 species-specific SP and SPH genes exist, accounting for
56.8% of the silkworm SP and SPH genes. This indicated
that the genes that came from the same species-specific
SP and SPH gene families were the result of tandem
repeats (Figure 2). For example, SP_fam13 has 7 members, and 5 occur as tandem repeats on chromosome 10.
Internal members of the same family showed tandem
repeat distribution in SP_fam14 (chr.16), SP_fam15
(chr.7), SP_fam16 (chr.26) and SP_fam17 (chr.28). Thus,
tandem repeat distribution has an important effect on the
expansion of species-specific SP and SPH genes in silkworm. In fact, silkworm genome analysis shows that
many silkworm-specific gene families have the typical
features of a chromosomal tandem repeat distribution

Figure 1 Distribution of SP and SPH genes on silkworm chromosomes . (A) The five Chromosomes that have the most number of SP and SPH
genes. Many SP and SPH genes are in tandem clusters. (B) An example of SP and SPH genes clustered on chromosome 16. These five genes are distributed in a cluster within 250 kb.The arrowhead indicates the transcriptional orientation of genes.

[2,19,20]. In addition, gene sequences in the same cluster
show high identity. For example, the chromosomal location of BmSPH74 and BmSPH143 is a typical tandem
repeat, with the genes closely linked on the chromosome,
only 3 kb apart, and sequence identity of up to 96%. This
indicated that one of the genes may have emerged from
the duplication of the other, and the duplication event
happened recently. Therefore, these specific genes may
come from a specific gene duplication family. Genes that
originated by duplication might have adapted during silkworm evolution and may cut substrates specific to silkworm. However, this hypothesis need to be valitated by
further experiments.
Expression profile of silkworm SP and SPH genes

Microarray analysis showed that 64 SP and SPH genes
have transcriptional activity in at least one tissue or organ
according to a stringent criterion for definition of
expressed genes [15]. Midgut had the highest number
(38) of expressed genes among the 10 tissues or organs,
while the number of expressed genes in testis, ovary,
head, integument, fat body, hemocytes, Malpighian
tubule, A/MSG and PSG was 26, 24, 32, 30, 15, 22, 20, 7
and 6, respectively (Figure 3). Further analysis reveals that
most of genes expressed highly and exclusively in the
midgut belong to silkworm-specific families, such as
SP_fam12, SP_fam13, SP_fam14 and SP_fam15. These

gene families showed unique midgut expression feature
that are likely to reflect the special food habit of silkworm, and the process of accumulating abundant amino
acids for producing silk. It may also be associated with
resistance with pathogenic microorganisms. Some genes
had unique expression features in other tissues on the
third day of the silkworm fifth instar larva according to
microarray analysis, for example, exclusive expression
was seen for BmSP95 in the head, BmSPH104 in the testis, and BmSPH128 in the ovaries. Semi-quantitative RTPCR was also performed to confirm tissue expression
patterns of some representative SP and SPH genes for
day-3 fifth instar larvae. The results were the same as
those for the microarray data (Figure 4).
More than 20 genes are expressed exclusively at the
fifth instar larval stage, and about 7 genes are expressed
highly over the entire metamorphosis process (Figure 5).
The majority of SP and SPH genes express in both male
and female silkworms. However, a group of SPH genes
show differences in expression between males and
females during the metamorphosis in which a pupa turns
into an adult. These genes express highly and exclusively
in males, but are minimally expressed in females during
metamorphosis (Figure 5).
We analyzed the expression pattern of repeated genes
using information on gene location and expression data
from tissue microarray experiments, and found that

repeated SP and SPH gene groups in silkworm do not
have identical expression patterns. For example, the
repeated gene group on chr.16 includes several genes, but
only BmSP18 and BmSP142 have a similar expression
pattern. Of 23 SP and SPH genes expressed exclusively in
the midgut, only BmSP18 and BmSP142 are tandem
repeat genes, with too much distance between the other
genes (Figure 2), although some were located on the same
chromosome, such as BmSPH35, BmSPH4, BmSPH44
and BmSPH6 on chr.7; BmSPH10, BmSP25, BmSPH47
and BmSPH81 on chr.18; BmS142, BmS18 and BmSPH51
on chr.16; and BmSP141 and BmSP42 on chr.12. These
results were confirmed by developmental expression patterns (data not shown)
To investigate whether silkworm SP genes are involved
in the immune response, SP and SPH expression changes
were analyzed after insects infected by four different
microorganisms. We found that expression of 65 SP and
SPH genes could be detected. Among these, 18 were upregulated more than 2.0 times in the infected group compared to the control group (Figure 6 and Additional file
6). Most were up-regulated most strongly during the late
stage, 24 hours after infection. For example, BmSP36
expression was up to 4 times higher than the control at 24
hours after E. coli infection, and twice as high as the 24-h
point for Bacillus bombysepticus or Batrytis bassiana
infection. Expression of BmSPH4 exceeded 1.5 times the
control after infection with any of the four microorganisms. A few genes showed expression regulation that was

different, depending on the infecting microorganism. For
example, BmSPH125 was up-regulated after infection
with E.coli, B.bombyspticus or B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), but did not change significantly after
infection with B.bassiana. However, when we compared
the magnitude in induction of gene expression between
antibacterial proteins BmcecropinB and silkworm SP or
SPH genes, we found that BmcecropinB was remarkably
upregulated on infection by these four pathogens at all
time points except for BmNPV infection at 24 h (Figure
6). The induced expression pattern was consistent with
SP or SPH genes at most of the time points. The data suggest that SP or SPH genes might play important roles in
the innate immune system of B. mori. The gene expression results from microarray experiments were validated
by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Additional file 7). The
results are consistent with the microarray experiments.
Only 3 of the 18 up-regulated genes were in GenBank,
specifically BmSPH125 (NP_001036891), BmSP131
(NP_001040537) and BmSP141 (NP_001040178) (Additional file 3).Of 18 up-regulated SPs and SPHs, BmSP95
has two clip domains, while BmSPH125 has one clip
domain (Additional file 4). Although the function of clip
domains is not yet clear, enzymes that contain this structure are of interest, because they may regulate serine protease activity and mediate innate immunity [5].
SPs involved in cascade regulation of the insect
immune response were found to be highly conserved.
Broehan found that chymotrypsin-like protease cascade

systems that contain CTLP1 control chitin synthase
activity in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta [21].
The chitin portion of the peritrophic matrix in the
midgut plays an important role in resistance to pathogenic bacteria and toxins. BmSPH10 has 70% identity to
CLIP 1 (Additional file 6), and like CLIP 1, BmSPH10 was
also expressed in the midgut, so it may have a similar
function. The melanism reaction in insects is mediated
by an SP signalling cascade that is highly conserved. In
the M. sexta SP signalling cascade, proHP14 is a pattern

recognition protein that binds to bacteria and autoactivates and triggers the prophenoloxidase activation system
in the hemolymph, which contains a series of proteinases
such as HP1, 6 8, 17 and 21. Finally prophenoloxidaseactivating proteinase (PAPs) are activated, leading to the
melanism reaction [22-24]. Cytotoxic molecules are produced in this process, including quinones and reactive
oxygen intermediates, that may kill the invading microorganisms that are trapped by the melanin [25]. BmSP14,
BmSPH125 and BmSPH78 in the silkworm are highly

tobacco hornworm (Additional file 6). BmSP14,
BmSPH125 and BmSPH78 were markedly up-regulated
after induction, suggesting that they may have similar
functions to their tobacco hornworm homologs (BmSP14
and BmSPH78, which were up-regulated between 1.5 and
2 times, were not included in the table).

Conclusions
From the updated B. mori silkworm genome, we identified SP and SPH genes and analyzed their expression patterns. Comparative genomics showed that SP and SPH
genes belong to a large family whose members were generated mainly by duplication and show a lineage of tandem chromosomal repeats. In addition, we found that
silkworm has species-specific SP and SPH genes, and
combining the results of express profiles, we hypothesize
that members of the silkworm SP and SPH families may
participate in biological processes that include digestion,
development and the immune response. We hope the
data presented in this study facilitates functional studies
on SPs and SPHs in B. mori.
Methods
Identification of silkworm SP and SPH genes in the
silkworm

SP and SPH genes from M. sexta and other insects were
downloaded
from
GenBank
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/. The sequence homology BLAST alignment tool was downloaded from the ftp

site of National Center for Biotechnology Information
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/. SP and SPH gene sequences
from other insects were used as queries in BLAST
searches against the silkworm database (E-value: 10-6)
[26]. Identified genes were validated by aligning to a nonredundant gene dataset. Identified genes were also validated by BLAST searching against an EST database with
threshold E-value <10-30, identities >90%, and match
lengths >100 bp.
Evolutionary analysis of silkworm SP and SPH genes

SP and SPH sequences of D. melanogaster, C. elegans and
A. gambiae were included in an all-against-all BLAST
search using BLASTP (E-value 1e-30), with the results
converted into a Markov Martrix [27]. The TRIBE-MCL
clustering algorithm was used to detect family members
[27]. Clustering operations were implemented at inflation
values of 1.2. Identified SP and SPH genes were used for
phylogenetic analyses. Multiple sequence alignments of
protein sequences were made using ClustalX 1.83 [28],
and neighbor-joining used Phylip software [29], with a
bootstrap value of 1000 to reconstruct the phylogenetic
tree.
Expression of silkworm SP and SPH genes from wholegenome microarrays

In 2007, Xia et al. constructed a genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray with more than 22,000 probes [15],
including 107 SP- and SPH-specific oligonucleotide
probes. We analyzed tissue expression of SP and SPH
genes at the third day of the fifth instar larvae of Dazao.
In brief, insects were reared at a stable temperature of
25Â°C until the third day of the fifth instar. Then testis,
ovary, head, integument, fat body, midgut, hemocytes,
Malpighian tubules, A/MSG (anterior/median silk gland)
and PSG (posterior silk gland) from this developmental
point were hand-dissected on ice. To determine the
developmental expression patterns, individuals at 20 different time points from day 3 of the fifth instar to the
moth stage were collected for both genders. Gene expression levels were visualized using GeneCluster 2.0 [30].
The detailed experimental procedures for microarray and
data analyses were as previously reported [15].
For insects used for microorganism induction, newly
hatched Dazao larvae were reared to the third day of the
fifth instar with an artificial diet, in constant-temperature
incubators. The gram-negative E. coli, gram-positive B.
bombysepticus, B. bassiana and BmNPV were used for
feeding induction, and Dazao fed with physiological
saline were used as negative control. Whole body of individual samples induced with B. bassiana were collected
after 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours, and whole body of individual
samples from induction with the other microorganisms
were collected after 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Microarray

Figure 6 Hierarchical cluster analysis of SP and SPH genes after
microorganism infection. Red represents that gene expression is upregulated; black represents that gene expression is not changed; green
represents that gene expression is download-regulated; gray represents data missing. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Cluster version 3.0 and visualized by TreeView.

procedures and data analysis were as described [15].
Genes were considered to be up-regulated if the change
in gene expression was greater than two fold on at least
one occasion over the four time points in any of the four
microorganism induction experiments [31-35]. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression patterns was performed using the Cluster (version 3.0) and visualized by
TreeView programs [36].
Tissue expression analysis of silkworm SP and SPH genes by
semi-quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from nine tissues (testis, ovary,
head, fat body, integument, midgut, hemocytes, Malpighian tubules and silk gland) from day 3 fifth instar larvae using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA).
Contaminating genomic DNA was digested using RNasefree DNase I (Promega) for 30 min at 37Â°C. RNA samples
were diluted with RNase-free water and stored at -80Â°C.
The concentration of total RNA was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Total RNA (10 Î¼g) was
reverse-transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) at 42Â°C. All cDNA sam-

ples were normalized using B. mori actin A3 as an internal control (forward primer: 5'-AAC ACC CCG TCC
TGC TCA CTG-3'; reverse primer: 5'-GGG CGA GAC
GTG TGA TTT CCT-3'). All SP and SPH primers for
semi-quantitative RT-PCR detection are listed in Table
Additional file 8. PCR amplification was performed in a
total reaction volume of 25 Î¼L containing normalized
cDNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM
dNTP, 1Ã buffer and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed in a
volume of 25 Î¼L using the following program: initial incubation at 94Â°C for 4 min, followed by 24-28 cycles
(BmSP95, BmSPH104, BmSPH128, BmSP36, BmSPH47,
BmSPH85, BmSP142 for 24 cycles; BmSP43 and
BmSP141 for 26 cycles; BmSP25 for 28 cycles) of 40 s at
94Â°C, 40 s of annealing (temperatures listed in Additional
file 8), 45 s of extension (72Â°C), and a final extension at
72Â°C for 10 min. Aliquots of 4 Î¼L of the PCR products
were separated on 2.0% agarose gels and stained with EB.
Induced expression analysis of silkworm SP and SPH genes
by real-time quantitative RT-PCR

Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI
PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The 15 Î¼l mixture included 1.5 Î¼l of cDNA, 0.5
mM of each primer and 1Ã SYBR Premix Ex Taq
(TaKaRa) in each well of a 96-well plate. PCR was carreied out with initial denaturation at 94Â°C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95Â°C for 5 s and 60Â°C for 31 s. The
primer sequences for all genes are listed in Additional file
9. Relative gene expression data were normalized against
Ct values for the housekeeping sw22934 gene in silkworm
and the fold change (2-ÎÎCt) was determined by comparison with average expression levels for control samples,
with the index dened as 1.0. Four larvae were used for
each treatment. Each expression assay was repeated three
times. Student's t-test was used to evaluate statistical
signicance (P < 0.01).

Additional material
Additional file 1 The SPs and SPHs predicted in the silkworm . a. The
scaffold name of silkworm genome that can be found in the SilkDB http://
www.silkdb.org; b. The start position of the SPs and SPHs gene on the silkworm genome; c. The end position of the SPs and SPHs gene on the silkworm genome; d. The strand of the SPs and SPHs gene on the silkworm
genome; e. The position of the SPs and SPHs gene on the silkworm chromosomes; f. Whether the SPs and SPHs genes are supported by the EST evidence.
Additional file 2 The serine protease genes that contain intact active
site . The active site of Ser, His, and Asp play important role in the catalytic
processes for SP genes. By analyzing the gene sequences, we found that 51
serine protease genes have the three active site residues intact (SP), and the
rest 92 serine protease genes had mutations in the catalytic residues (SPH),
so they may have lost catalytic function.
Additional file 3 The SPs and SPHs in the silkworm that have been
reported . The GenBank accession numbers and description of the
reported SPs and SPHs in the silkworm are listed.

Additional file 4 The clip domain in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The
conserved six cysteine residues for each CLIP are marked by color. We identified 7 clip-SPs and 11 clip-SPHs in the silkworm, which are consisted of a
chymotrypsin-like SP domain, and one or more clip domain(s) at the N-terminus.
Additional file 5 Phylogenetic analysis of silkworm-specific SP and
SPH genes of silkworm and Drosophila. Most of t he SP and SPH genes
were included in the analysis. Except for SP_fam1, we choose three representative genes to analyze. Multiple alignments of protein sequences were
made by ClustalW. Then neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by Phylip. The parameters were chosen as follows: the evolutionary distance was poisson-corrected, gaps were completely deleted, and
100 iterations were used for calculating bootstrap values.
Additional file 6 The up-regulated SP and SPHs after silkworm
infected by microorganisms . Genes whose expression were up-regulated than two fold on at least one occasion over the four time points in any
of the four microorganism induction experiments were listed. The best
NCBI BLAST Results of the up-regulated SP and SPHs were also shown in
the table.
Additional file 7 The induced expression analysis of silkworm SP and
SPH genes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR . We chose the time points
of infecting 6 h and 24 h to do the expression analysis. The expression of SP
or SPH in the control sample was set to 1. The abbreviations are used, the E.
coli infected sample (Ec), the B. bombyseptieus infected sample (Bs), the B.
bassiana infected sample (Bb) and the B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus infected
sample (NPV). Each expressive assay was replicated by three times. The Student's t-test was used to evaluate statistical signicance (P < 0. 01).
Additional file 8 Primers used in semi-quantitative RT-PCR study .
Primer sequences, melting temperature, and amplicon size were listed.
