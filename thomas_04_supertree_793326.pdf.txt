Abstract
Background: Order Charadriiformes (shorebirds) is an ideal model group in which to study a
wide range of behavioural, ecological and macroevolutionary processes across species. However,
comparative studies depend on phylogeny to control for the effects of shared evolutionary history.
Although numerous hypotheses have been presented for subsets of the Charadriiformes none to
date include all recognised species. Here we use the matrix representation with parsimony method
to produce the first fully inclusive supertree of Charadriiformes. We also provide preliminary
estimates of ages for all nodes in the tree.
Results: Three main lineages are revealed: i) the plovers and allies; ii) the gulls and allies; and iii)
the sandpipers and allies. The relative position of these clades is unresolved in the strict consensus
tree but a 50% majority-rule consensus tree indicates that the sandpiper clade is sister group to
the gulls and allies whilst the plover group is placed at the base of the tree. The overall topology is
highly consistent with recent molecular hypotheses of shorebird phylogeny.
Conclusion: The supertree hypothesis presented herein is (to our knowledge) the only complete
phylogenetic hypothesis of all extant shorebirds. Despite concerns over the robustness of
supertrees (see Discussion), we believe that it provides a valuable framework for testing numerous
evolutionary hypotheses relating to the diversity of behaviour, ecology and life-history of the
Charadriiformes.

Background
The shorebirds and allies (Aves: Charadriiformes; [1])
present an exceptional group for studying numerous evolutionary hypotheses. Their remarkable diversity of social
mating system, parental care, sexual dimorphism, ecology
and life-history make them an ideal group for unravelling
the mechanisms of, for example, sexual selection and sexual conflict. Previous comparative studies have made significant contributions to our understanding of the
evolution of mating systems [2], parental care [3,4], sexual size dimorphism [5-7], locomotion and morphology
[8], migratory behaviour [9], egg size [10], and plumage

colouration [11]. The importance of phylogeny in crossspecies comparative studies is well documented [12-14].
Large and well-resolved phylogenies that incorporate
divergence times provide powerful tests of a wide range of
hypotheses whilst accounting for the effects of shared evolutionary history [13,15]. However, the shorebird studies
listed above were limited by the lack of a complete phylogeny for the group. Most of these studies are based on
derivations of the seminal work of Sibley and Ahlquist
[16], yet this study included less than a quarter of extant
and recently extinct shorebird species. Recently extinct
taxa (according to Monroe and Sibley [1]) are: the

Tahitian sandpiper Prosobonia leucoptera, the Canary
Islands oystercatcher Haematopus maedewaldoi, and the
Great auk Pinguinus impennis.
Recent molecular studies covering a wide range of shorebird families have drawn attention to conflict in the
reconstruction of the deep basal nodes of shorebird phylogeny (figure 1; reviewed by van Tuinen et al. [17]). For
example, morphological data [18,19] places Alcinae
(auks, puffins, murres) at the base of the shorebird tree
whilst sequence [20-22] and DNA-DNA hybridisation
[16] data suggests that they are a highly derived sister
group to Stercorariini (skuas and jaegers), Larini (gulls),
Sternini (terns), and Rynchopini (skimmers). It is important to note that taxon coverage differs between these
studies and this may be an important factor in determining the tree topology. Specific phylogenies have been
derived, for example, for sandpipers [23], the genus
Charadrius [24], and jacanas [25] using DNA sequence
data. In contrast, morphological evidence provided the
basis for Chu's [26] study of gull phylogeny. Strauch [18]
presented the most complete data set of 227 Charadriiformes species. However, despite the plethora of cladograms for particular shorebird groups (see reviews by Sibley
and Ahlquist [16]; Thomas et al. [22]), those that address
relationships across the whole clade use either sparse
taxon sampling [16,27], or are based on reassessments of
Strauch's [18] data [19,28-30]. Note that Dove [30]
included a feather microstructural analysis in addition to
her reanalysis of Strauch's [18] data.
Combining phylogenetic data
Numerous methods and types of data can be used to infer
phylogeny. Frequently, as in Charadriiformes, a single
analysis incorporating all taxa of interest is absent. Under
the principle of total evidence [31], all sources of phylogenetic information should be combined to maximize their
explanatory power. Eernisse and Kluge [32] define total
evidence as a method for seeking the best fitting phylogenetic hypothesis for an unpartitioned set of synapomorphies (shared derived characters) using character
congruence (characters combined in a supermatrix).
Hence, this method combines the primary data (molecular, morphological and behavioural characters) into a single analysis. The approach is powerful because weak
signals in the partitioned data sets may be enhanced when
combined, and previously obscured relationships may be
revealed [33].

The total evidence approach has both practical and theoretical problems. First, only certain types of data can be
combined. For example, nucleotide sequences and morphological traits can be readily assessed together as
characters, but it is not generally possible to include
nucleotide sequences and genetic distance data in a single

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/28

analysis [34]. We acknowledge that Lapointe et al. [35]
suggest a distance based approach to combine otherwise
incompatible data in a total evidence analysis, although
this method has not been tested beyond a single application. The consequence is that it is rarely possible to combine all sources of data in practice and the lack of overlap
in combinable data sets may result in a reduction of the
number of taxa included. Second, Miyamoto and Fitch
[36] contend that combining data sets is rarely justified
because partitions of phylogenetic data are real and unequivocal. They argue that several partitions producing
similar topologies provide multiple lines of independent
evidence supporting that topology.
Theoretical arguments over the benefits of total evidence
will undoubtedly continue, but perhaps the major barriers to its use are the often very high computational
demands of large matrices, and the a priori exclusion of
certain data types. This is particularly true of Charadriiformes phylogeny, where one of the most significant contributions to the field – DNA-DNA hybridisation – cannot
be included. An alternative set of techniques, collectively
termed supertrees (e.g., Matrix Representation with Parsimony, MRP; [37,38]), enables combination of trees
(rather than raw data) from otherwise incompatible
sources. MRP methods code source phylogenies based on
the presence and absence of taxa at each node of the tree
[37-39] and are thus one step removed from the primary
data. It is important to recognise that supertrees should
not be regarded as a replacement for exhaustive phylogenetic studies of the primary data and there are drawbacks
to the methods (see Discussion). However, they do enable
very large phylogenies to be constructed rapidly [15].
Supertrees have been constructed successfully for a wide
variety of taxa including carnivores [15], primates [39],
seabirds [40], dinosaurs [41], and grasses [42].
Shorebirds are particularly well suited for supertree treatment, since there are numerous incomplete phylogenies
available and a broader phylogeny is desirable to facilitate
powerful analyses of numerous evolutionary hypotheses
(see above). Here, we present the first complete composite
phylogeny of extant and recently extinct [1] shorebirds
using the MRP approach. We are therefore combining
data on tree topologies, and not conducting a simultaneous analysis on the original data. We also use fossil and
molecular data to estimate divergence times (see Methods). The combination of complete taxonomic coverage
and the inclusion of branch lengths provide the basis for
future comparative analyses of Charadriiformes evolution. In addition, conflicting and unresolved areas of
Charadriiformes phylogeny are revealed.

Results and Discussion
Supertree resolution and topology
We found 1469 equally short trees of length 1847 steps
using the parsimony ratchet approach (see Methods). This
compares favourably to a standard heuristic search that
yielded shortest trees of 1853 steps. All subsequent results
and discussion refer to the parsimony ratchet analyses.
Figure 2 shows the family and subfamily level relationships of shorebirds based on the strict and 50 % majorityrule consensus tree (see additional file 1 for branch length
estimates). Figures 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 show the species level
phylogeny. The full 50% majority rule consensus and the
strict consensus trees are available as additional file 2 and
3 respectively. The 50% majority-rule consensus tree is
well resolved (73.1%; 255 nodes out of a possible 349 in
a fully bifurcating tree), although the strict consensus tree
is only 49.6% resolved (173 from 349 possible nodes).
The majority rule tree includes nine novel clades (numbers 20, 29, 57, 85, 89, 108, 122, 139, 140) that do not
appear in any of the source trees; all of these occur towards
the tips of the tree. This is a general problem in supertree
construction and such clades should be collapsed as they
have no support [41]. To demonstrate where the MRP
method has performed badly we have included the novel
clades in all figures and list details in the figure legends. In
addition, 58 nodes are supported by only one character
(see additional file 1). Each of these nodes is left over
from a single source tree. Assessing the support for such
nodes is problematic because this may simply reflect a

lack of research directed at the taxa in question. A major
challenge for supertree construction is to develop measures of support that reflect the robustness of nodes in the
source trees. We list the number of characters supporting
each node (additional file 1) but stress that these are not
measures of tree robustness and may not be directly comparable even within the same tree. This is because the
taxon coverage across source trees is highly variable so
some nodes have more potential support than others. Furthermore, because measures of support used in the source
trees differ between studies (some source trees include no
measures of support), it is impractical and of dubious
value to use these measures to assess the robustness of the
supertree.
The majority of unresolved nodes in the shorebird supertree are located towards the tips of the phylogeny. For
example, the genus Gallinago forms a monophyletic clade
but only two pairs of species are resolved from 14 species
(G. megala and G. negripennis; G. macrodactyla and G.
media) in the majority-rule tree. Only the latter relationship remains in the strict consensus tree. In addition,
clades including the genera Charadrius and Vanellus, Calidris and Tringa, Sterna, and Scolopax are poorly resolved.
This may reflect a bias in phylogenetic studies of shorebirds. For instance, we found six source trees for Alcinae
[43-48] but none devoted to Scolopax or Gallinago. Thomas et al. [49] indicate that this may be a problem for

indicates three monophyletic Charadriiformes lineages
(figure 2). Family and subfamily resolution within each
lineage is high, however the relative position of each
group is unresolved in the strict consensus tree. This is an
important point because the deepest relationships of
shorebird phylogeny are contentious [22]. The 50%
majority-rule consensus tree indicates that the gulls and
allies (Larini, Sternini, Rynchopini, Stercorariini, Dromas,
Alcinae, and Glareolidae) are sister to the sandpipers and
allies (Scolopacidae, Jacanidae, Rostratulidae, Thinocoridae, Pedionomidae). The most basal lineage includes the
plovers and allies (Charadriinae, Pluvianellidae, Chionidae, Burhinidae, Haematopodini and Recurvirostrini).
The gulls and allies clade is most consistent with DNADNA hybridisation [16], indicating that Larini are sister to
Sternini and that Rynchopini are sister to this group. This
conflicts with morphology-based topologies where Stercorariini are sister to Larini and Sternini with Rynchopini
basal to both. Indeed, the position of Stercorariini
remains controversial and most recently they were placed
as sister to Alcinae [20-22]. In contrast, morphological
evidence [18,19] places Alcinae at the base of the whole
Charadriiformes tree with Stercorariini sister to Larini.
Thus, the position of Alcinae is uncertain and appears to
be dependent on the type of data, with fundamental
differences between molecular based analyses and morphological analyses. The taxon sampling of previous morphological and molecular studies varies considerably and
it may be this, rather than genuine differences in the phylogenetic signal of different data types, that is the cause of
conflict in resolving the phylogenetic position of Alcinae.
However, it is encouraging that van Tuinen et al. [17] suggested that new unpublished osteological data are consistent with the more derived position indicated by
molecular data. The supertree resolves Glareolidae outside the Larini, Sternini, Rynchopini, Stercorariini, Dromas, Alcinae clade. This is also the case with recent
molecular and previous DNA-DNA hybridisation studies.
Morphological studies have failed to resolve the position
of Glareolidae, placing the family in a large polytomy
with all other major groups except Alcinae and the sandpipers and allies (fig. 1). A novel development in shorebird phylogeny is the placement of the black-rumped
buttonquail Turnix hottentotta as a sister to the gulls and
allies (Larini, Sternini, Rynchopini, Stercorariini, Dromas,
Alcinae, and Glareolidae) based on the nuclear RAG-1
gene [20]. We did not include this species in the supertree
because to date Paton et al. [20] remains the only study to
reveal an apparently robust relationship. More diverse
sampling of the buttonquails (Turnicidae) is essential to
corroborate the general affinities of this family.
The relationships within the plover clade appear to be reasonably stable. Morphological, molecular, and DNA-DNA
hybridisation all place Charadriinae as sister to Haemat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/28

opodini and Recurvirostrini; our supertree is consistent
with these relationships. However, it is not clear whether
Burhinidae and Chionidae are sister to each other [20-22]
or whether Chionidae are sister to a Charadriinae, Haematopodini, Recurvirostrini, and Burhinidae clade [16].
Our supertree also included Pluvianellidae, a family consisting of only one species (magellanic plover Pluvianellus
socialis) and places this as sister to Chionidae. If Pluvianellidae are excluded, the supertree is consistent with the sister group relationship of Burhinidae and Chionidae.
The sister group relationship of Jacanidae to Rostratulidae
is well established [16,18-22] and is found in our supertree. The supertree resolves the Thinocoridae and Pedionomidae as sister taxa and this group is sister to the
Jacanidae and Rostratulidae. The large Scolopacidae clade
is at the base of the sandpiper clade consistent with recent
molecular studies [20-22] and the DNA-DNA hybridisation tapestry [16].
Taken together, it is evident that the supertree is generally
more consistent with molecular data (both recent
sequence studies and DNA-DNA hybridisation) than with
analyses based on morphology. However, it is of course
possible that this reflects the greater number of molecular
source trees available rather than indicating that molecular data is actually better at resolving shorebird phylogeny.
We included several large morphological phylogenies [e.g
[18,19,26,30,43]] but the majority of source trees (29 out
of 51) were based on molecular evidence (see additional
file 5).
Node dates
The higher resolution of the majority-rule tree means it is
more likely to be of use in comparative studies. We
therefore estimated node ages for this topology only (see
additional file 1 and 2). We stress that our estimates of
node dates are a first attempt at dating the whole tree and
have several limitations. First, the fossils used to calibrate
seven nodes in the tree are unlikely to be the earliest members of their respective families thus these dates will be
underestimates. Second, we assumed that the fossils are
grouped with the extant members of the family but this
requires formal testing in a phylogenetic framework.
Third, the pure birth model assumes that no extinction
occurs but this may be unrealistic and it is likely that
extinction processes have reduced the representation of
older lineages [15]. Furthermore, this model is derived
from the topological structure of the tree so errors in tree
reconstruction will likely lead to errors in branch length
estimation. However, this approach has been employed
previously in supertrees of primates [39] and carnivores
[15] explicitly to facilitate comparative analyses. Despite
these caveats, simulation studies have demonstrated that
comparative methods such as independent contrasts are

Page 12 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:28

robust to errors in branch length [50] and no viable alternative for dating supertrees has been proposed. Nonetheless, we urge that alternative branch length assumptions
are explored if the shorebird supertree is used in future
comparative studies. At present, the calibrated RAG-1 tree
of Paton et al. [20] remains arguably the most thorough
and reliable measure of divergence times for
Charadriiformes.
A fuller understanding of the phylogenetic affinities of
fossil shorebirds will probably improve estimates of node
ages for the group. For example, the extinct form
Graculavidae, is represented by fossils from the Maastrichtian of New Jersey [51] and Cretaceous of Wyoming [52]
but its position within the shorebird clade is unclear. Feduccia [53] suggests that it may be basal and a formal corroboration of this would support proposals for a late
Cretaceous origin of shorebirds. The difficulties in dating
the shorebird tree are further illustrated by fossil representatives of Recurvirostrini and Burhinidae which are
much older than current estimates suggests. The earliest
record of the Recurvirostrini is estimated to be over 50
million years old [54] whilst recent discoveries of a possible member of the Burhinidae are dated to around 70 mya
[55,56]. There is clearly a need for an integrated phylogenetic study including both extinct and extant shorebirds.
Supertree bias
Supertrees are still at an early stage of development and
many aspects of MRP, and supertree methods in general,
are not yet clearly understood. Steps can be taken to
ensure that the supertree includes the most appropriate
sets of sources trees, such as only using trees from explicitly phylogenetic studies. This is not always straightforward and could result in the exclusion of important
information. For instance, in our shorebird supertree, we
included Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridisation
tapestry [16] although this is based on distance measures
rather than more rigorous phylogenetic methods. Even if
very strict tree selection criteria are applied, there are still
likely to be biases in the data set. For example, not all
source trees are equally well supported, yet in most
supertree analyses each tree is treated equally [57]. This is
a problem for supertree construction because whilst it is
theoretically possible, and indeed beneficial, to weight
source trees based on support values [57] it is rarely possible in practice. Many source trees do not have support
values and those that do may use different methods, (e.g,
bootstrapping or decay indices) which cannot be directly
compared with each other. An additional problem that
has not been fully resolved relates to correlations between
source trees [58]. Several source trees based on the same
data set may unduly increase the influence of that data set
on the supertree analysis. However, there is no formal way
of determining how much overlap to allow and the choice

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/28

of source trees that go into supertree construction inevitably involves some degree of subjective reasoning. For the
shorebird supertree we used strict Reduced Cladistic Consensus trees to summarise potential source trees that were
from the same data set but based on different methods.
For example, Thomas et al. [22] based their phylogeny on
cytochrome-b but used a range of methods including parsimony and Bayesian analyses. We therefore combined
these trees to minimise bias. In contrast, Ericson et al. [21]
used two types of data: sequences from the nuclear RAG 1
gene and sequences from the myoglobin intron II. They
carried out three analyses: each gene separately and then
the two combined in a single analysis. In this case, we
used three source trees. It could be argued that the combined analysis of Ericson et al. [21] should be excluded
because of the possible overlap with the individual analyses. However, under the principle of total evidence, the
combined data set may result in novel relationships being
revealed [31,33] and therefore could contribute important information to the supertree. Simulation and empirical studies are required to fully understand these and
other possible biases in supertree construction (e.g., the
influence of source tree size and shape) and formal protocols for the selection of source trees are desirable. For
transparency, we include a summary of the source trees
used, data type, and the main taxa included in the study
(additional file 5).
Our shorebird supertree is highly consistent with recent
advances in the molecular phylogenetics Charadriiformes. However, we urge caution when using the tree in
comparative analyses and encourage the additional use of
alternative phylogenies and branch length assumptions. It
is particularly important to note that the position of some
groups such as the Alcinae remains controversial and that
although the majority rule tree is consistent with recent
molecular studies, the strict consensus tree fails to resolve
the deepest nodes.

Conclusions
The supertree presented here is, to our knowledge, the first
attempt to reconstruct the phylogeny of the entire order
Charadriiformes. Overall, the supertree is highly consistent with recent molecular hypotheses of shorebird
phylogeny. However, it is apparent that fresh attempts to
resolve both the phylogeny and estimates of age will be
dependent on further gene sequencing and new fossil discoveries. The affinities of the Alcinae and the relationships
between the three major shorebird clades require further
corroboration, and studies of several genera such as Gallinago and Vanellus are desirable. Furthermore, additional
work is required to establish the true affinities of the Turnicidae. Nonetheless, it appears that shorebird phylogeny
is gradually approaching a consensus view. The broad taxonomic scope and consistency of the supertree mean that

is of potentially great value to future comparative studies
(accepting the caveats discussed above) of the behaviour,
life-history, ecology and conservation of this diverse
group.

Methods
Supertree construction
Possible source trees were identified from online searches
of Web of Science http://wos.mimas.ac.uk covering the
years 1981 to 2004. We used the single key strings phylogen*, cladistic*, clado*, classif*, systematic*, and
taxonom* (where the asterisks allow variations such as
"phylogeny" or "phylogenetics") in the topic field, in conjunction with a major Charadriiformes taxon name (scientific or common). As supertree methods have been
criticized for being biased towards historical trends, we
preferred those studies that explicitly set out to derive a
phylogenetic hypothesis and so exclude purely (and typically older) descriptive taxonomic works. The Sibley and
Ahlquist [16] DNA-DNA hybridisation tapestry may be
viewed as non-cladistic, but it was clearly the authors'
intention to reconstruct the phylogeny of birds. Furthermore, it provided a vital catalyst for subsequent studies of
avian (including shorebird) phylogeny. We therefore
included the DNA-DNA hybridisation hypothesis as a
source tree in our analyses. Simulation studies have demonstrated that the performance of supertree methods is
improved by including at least one taxonomically complete (or near complete) source tree [57]. We therefore
make an exception to our self-imposed rule, and in addition use the taxonomic hierarchy of Monroe and Sibley
[1] as a source tree as this includes all extant
Charadriiformes species. We acknowledge that this taxonomy is based largely on Sibley and Ahlquist's [16] DNADNA hybridisation tapestry.

The initial search identified 78 source trees from 44 publications. Each source tree was typed as a text file in Nexus
format [59]. We coded trees to the species level with species names taken from Monroe and Sibley [1], but note
that contra Monroe and Sibley [1], we use Charadriiformes
not Charadrii to refer to the whole group. Several studies
included the gull Larus thayeri [26,60-63] either as a subspecies of Larus glaucoides (Larus glaucoides thayeri in Monroe and Sibley [1]) or a species in its own right. In
recognition of this, we included Larus glaucoides thayeri as
the only subspecies in our data set thus increasing the
total taxa to 366. Monroe and Sibley [1] include 16 species of the family Pteroclidae within the Charadriiformes.
However, the relationship of this family to the
Charadriiformes is uncertain and they have recently been
placed in their own order [64]. We include the Pteroclidae
in our analyses only as a means of rooting the tree. Where
there were multiple most parsimonious trees (MPTs), or
where source trees had been derived from predominantly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/28

overlapping data (e.g., from the same data but using alternative methods), we used RadCon [65] to produce strict
Reduced Cladistic Consensus trees (RCC [66,67]). The
output is in the form of a reduced consensus profile and
from this we selected the tree with the highest Cladistic
Information Content (CIC) [65,68]. This resulted in a
total of 51 source trees from which our supertree is
derived and these are summarised in additional file 5.
We produced an MRP matrix of the 51 Nexus [59] source
trees in RadCon [65] (see additional file 6 for the MRP
file). We used the original MRP coding method of Baum
[37] and Ragan [38]. Weighting source trees based on
node support such as bootstrapping improves the accuracy of MRP supertrees [57]. However, this is only possible if all source trees can be weighted on the same criteria
[57]. The absence of branch support measures in many of
the shorebird source trees precludes this approach from
the present study; hence, subsequent analyses were conducted using equally weighted parsimony.
The tendency of large data sets to produce many sub-optimal trees that are close in length and topology to the
shortest tree is a serious problem in phylogenetics. Standard heuristic searches frequently are trapped searching
within globally sub-optimal "islands" and the tree search
is often aborted before completion. Nixon [69] proposed
a new method to avoid this problem. The "Parsimony
Ratchet" reweights a random set of characters from the
data set. This may result in the tree island no longer representing a local optimum and the heuristic search continues until a new optimum is reached. The algorithm then
reverts to the original weighting and the search continues.
Nixon [69] demonstrated the efficacy of the method on a
500-taxon data set, where the ratchet-based search found
a tree two steps shorter than standard heuristic searches.
We used PAUPRat [70] to implement a parsimony ratchet
in PAUP* [59]. The default settings of 200 iterations and
15% perturbation of characters for reweighting were used
and we carried out 20 replicates. Equally parsimonious
trees were summarized using both strict and 50% majority-rule consensus methods.
We did not calculate any measures of branch support for
two reasons. First, their validity and meaning is questionable in MRP supertrees [41]. Second, the number of taxa
included in our data set is too large to allow practical calculation of any branch support indices (e.g., decay indices
[71]) on a desktop computer.
Dating the supertree
Following Purvis [39] and Bininda-Emonds et al. [15] we
dated the supertree using both absolute and relative dates.
We used data from the Fossil Record 2 [54] as the source
of fossil-based absolute dates. This yielded estimates for

Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:28

Jacanidae (Nupharanassa tolutaria, Rupellian), Phalaropus
(Phalaropus elenorae, Middle Pliocene), Burhinidae (Burhinus lucorum, Lower Miocene), Glareolidae (Paractiornis
perpusillus, Lower Miocene), Alcinae (Petralca austrica,
Rupellian), Stercoariini (Stercorarius sp., Middle
Miocene), and Larini (undetermined, Rupellian). We
took the midpoint of the range from the Fossil Record 2
[54] as our date estimate. More recent publications of fossil Charadriiformes were not included because they either
represent specimens that are younger or have not been
assigned to families that are represented amongst the
extant Charadriiformes (such as Turnipacidae [72]). We
assumed that fossil dates represent the earliest occurrence
for each group which inevitably resulted in underestimates of clade age. The fossil record of Charadriiformes is
amongst the best of the modern bird groups [17] in terms
of the numbers of taxa, but many specimens are fragmentary and reliable estimates of divergence dates are dependent on a limited number of exceptional specimens [73].
The phylogenetic affinities of the fossil shorebirds in relation to their extant relatives have not yet been fully
established, hence have implicitly assumed that fossil representatives of extant groups would be resolved amongst
their living relatives.
Source trees may include estimates of relative branch
lengths (e.g., genetic distances). This allows further dating
of the supertree but is problematic because different relative estimates are not comparable and cannot be applied
directly to the supertree [39]. However, where a source
trees shares a node that has an absolute date in the supertree (a node dated from fossil evidence), the relative
branch lengths can easily be converted to estimates of age.
All taxa in our supertree are either extant, or very recently
extinct; hence, the tips of the calibrated supertree should
be equidistant from the root of the tree. In source trees
where the relative branch lengths are not equidistant from
the root, we followed the protocol of Purvis [[39]; p.407–
8]. We estimated relative dates using the local molecular
clock logic [74] as implemented by Purvis [39] and
Bininda-Emonds et al. [15]. For example, consider three
taxa A, B, and C where A and B are sister taxa and C is sister to A and B. The root is dated to 10 million years (myr)
from fossil evidence, and independent molecular data
provides estimates of divergence based on the number of
substitutions per site. The molecular estimates of branch
lengths are as follows: A, 6 substitutions; B, 8
substitutions; C, 20 substitutions; A and B are 11 substitutions from the root. A and B are therefore separated from
their common node by a mean of 7 substitutions. The
total length from A and B to the root is thus 18 substitutions compared to 20 for C (a mean of 19). This can be
converted to date estimates such that 19 substitutions are
equivalent to 10 myr. The dates of the tree are then: ((A:
3.68, B: 3.68), C: 10)). There were no cases where multiple

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/28

source trees with molecular divergence dates were able to
provide estimates for the same node. We estimated relative dates from multiple nodes rather than a single dated
node to minimise correlative errors in estimates.
To provide date estimates for all nodes in the tree we
employed a pure birth model to date nodes for which
absolute and relative dates could not be attained [39].
Pure birth models infer that a clade's age is proportional
to the logarithm of the number of species within the
clade:
date of daughter = date of ancestor *(log daughter clade
size/log parent clade size)
For example, the age of a daughter node that subtends 12
taxa, estimated from its immediate ancestor dated to 20
myr and which subtends 19 taxa is:
20*(log(12)/log(19)) = 16.879
We applied this approach to estimate the ages of daughter
nodes based on dates (absolute or calibrated) of ancestral
nodes. We had no ancestral node on which to base estimates of the most basal clade. In this case, we rearranged
the pure birth formula and calculated the age of the ancestral node from its two daughter nodes, taking the mean as
our "best estimate". Finally, to estimate the ages of nodes
between daughter and ancestor nodes of known age we
spaced the nodes evenly along the branches length [75].

Additional material
Additional File 1
Estimates of node ages and node support (branch lengths.xls) Node
numbers correspond to figures 2-9. Five types of estimate were used: a)
absolute dates from the fossil record; b) absolute dates from molecular
point estimates; c) relative dates based on branch length estimates from
molecular studies; d) estimates based on a pure birth model (see text for
details); and e) even spacing of nodes along branches with daughters and
ancestors of known age. The numbers of characters supporting each node
are provided (column D), this is equivalent to the number of source trees
that share the equivalent node (see text for details).
