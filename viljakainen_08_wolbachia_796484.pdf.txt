Abstract
Background: The role of Wolbachia endosymbionts in shaping the mitochondrial diversity of their
arthropod host depends on the effects they have on host reproduction and on the mode of
transmission of the bacteria. We have compared the sequence diversity of wsp (Wolbachia surface
protein gene) and the host mtDNA in a group of Formica ant species that have diverged
approximately 0.5 million years ago (MYA). The aim was to study the relationship of Wolbachia and
its ant hosts in terms of vertical and horizontal transmission of the bacteria.
Results: All studied ant species were doubly infected with two Wolbachia strains (wFex1 and
wFex4) all over their geographical distribution area in Eurasia. The most common haplotypes of
these strains were identical with strains previously described from a more distantly related Formica
ant, with an estimated divergence time of 3.5 – 4 MYA. Some strain haplotypes were associated to
the same or closely related mtDNA haplotypes as expected under vertical transmission. However,
in several cases the wsp haplotypes coexisted with distant mtDNA haplotypes, a pattern which is
more compatible with horizontal transmission of the bacteria.
Conclusion: Two lines of evidence suggest that the sharing of Wolbachia strains by all F. rufa
species is rather due to horizontal than vertical transmission. First, the fact that endosymbiont
strains identical to those of F. rufa ants have been found in another species that diverged 3.5–4 MYA
strongly suggests that horizontal transfer can and does occur between Formica ants. Second, the
frequent sharing of identical Wolbachia strains by distant mitochondrial lineages within the F. rufa
group further shows that horizontal transmission has occurred repeatedly. Nevertheless, our
dataset also provides some evidence for longer-term persistence of infection, indicating that
Wolbachia infection within this host clade has been shaped by both horizontal and vertical
transmission of symbionts. The fact that all the ants were infected irrespective of the family
structure of their societies gives no support to the proposed hypotheses that the spreading of
Wolbachia in ants might be associated to the types of their societies.

Background
Wolbachia, the common endosymbiotic bacteria of arthropods and filarial nematodes, may have an influence on
the genetic variation of its host population. Maternally

transmitted Wolbachia causes, among others, cytoplasmic
incompatibility (CI), which prevents reproduction
between an uninfected female and an infected male, or
between a female and a male harboring different Wol-

bachia strains [1,2]. As CI Wolbachia spreads in the population, the associated, also maternally inherited
mitochondria are transmitted along with it. Theory predicts that the mitochondrial haplotype associated with
successfully spreading Wolbachia will increase in frequency, causing a reduction in the overall mitochondrial
variation [3], and finally leading to the elimination of
haplotypes associated with uninfected females [4].

defined by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay
and the transmission dynamics investigated by comparing
Wolbachia strains with associated mtDNA haplotypes. For
this purpose we used the mitochondrial phylogeny of F.
rufa group ants [20] based on samples from a large geographical scale covering most of the Eurasian distribution
of the wood ants, and we screened Wolbachia in ants from
the same nests used in the mtDNA study.

The effect of Wolbachia on host genetic variation depends
on its transmission dynamics, i.e. whether it is strictly vertically transmitted from mother to offspring, or whether
horizontal transmission also occurs between individuals
or even between species. The reduction in mitochondrial
variation caused by a selective sweep of Wolbachia occurs
only if Wolbachia spread solely vertically [4]. Horizontal
transmission of Wolbachia will weaken the association
between Wolbachia and the mitochondrial haplotype, and
the effects on host mitochondrial DNA variation are presumed to be negligible.

We found that all the F. rufa group ant species are infected
with two common strains of Wolbachia. Two lines of evidence indicate that the generality of this double-infection
is likely to be the result of horizontal transmission of Wolbachia between host species rather than the maintenance
of an ancestral infection. Firstly, the same Wolbachia
strains and haplotypes have been found in the more distantly related species Formica exsecta with a divergence
time of 3.5 – 4 million years ago [21]. Secondly, rare Wolbachia haplotypes are shared by Formica wood ants with
distant mtDNA haplotypes. However, the data shows
some evidence for long-term persistence of Wolbachia
infection in some lineages, suggesting that both horizontal and vertical transmission of Wolbachia have been
important in the infection history of Formica ants. As all
the ants were infected irrespective of their social organization, our data gives no support to the hypotheses that the
spreading of Wolbachia in ants might be associated to the
types of their societies.

In addition to CI, Wolbachia can promote its own spread
by manipulating host reproduction by inducing parthenogenesis, killing males, feminizing genetic males and
have even shown to be obligate mutualists [5-7].
Hymenoptera have haplodiploid sex determination
where haploid eggs develop to males and diploid eggs to
females. In addition, in some Hymenoptera only a single
locus is involved in the sex determination [8,9]. These systems rule out half of the Wolbachia manipulation types.
Induction of parthenogenesis by automixis would lead to
diploid offspring that are homozygous at the sex-determining locus and would develop into males instead of
females, and diploid males are known to be inviable or
sterile. Feminization is also ruled out as that would result
in haploid females that are not able to reproduce. This
leaves CI, male killing and host dependence as the modes
of Wolbachia's reproductive manipulation in hymenopteran social insects. CI has been reported to be the most
common effect of Wolbachia on arthropod hosts [10], and
that might be true also in ants [11-14].
The putative effects of Wolbachia on reproduction of
hymenopteran social insects have raised great interest, as
sex ratio manipulation is a central theme in social insect
biology, predicted by the kin selection theory as part of
the queen-worker conflicts [15]. Furthermore, it has been
suggested that the spread and prevalence of Wolbachia
infections could be associated to the social type of insect
colonies [16,17] and to the invasion histories [18,19].
The aim of the present study was to shed light on the relationship between Wolbachia and the Formica rufa group
wood ants by focusing on the transmission modes of the
bacteria. Wolbachia infection status in the ants was

Results
Infection status
All 32 wood ant samples of the six F. rufa group species
contained Wolbachia (Table 1). Most of the ants carried a
double infection of two group A Wolbachia strains, wFex1
and wFex4, which have both been previously identified in
Swiss populations of the ant F. exsecta [22]. In addition, F.
rufa contained group A strain wFex2 (also previously
described from Swiss F. exsecta [22]) and a new strain
named wFrufa [GenBank:EF554317]. All strains were
clearly distinct in sequence, as the amount of nucleotide
differences in the 546–567 bp long sequences ranged
from 10% between wFex1 and wFex2 to 21% between
wFex1 and wFex4.

The overall proportions of the two common Wolbachia
strains wFex1 and wFex4 in the ant species sampled were
40% and 57%, respectively. Within species frequencies
varied from 26% to 75% in wFex1, and from 25% to 70%
in wFex4. The heterogeneity of the proportions of these
two strains among the host species was close to significant
(Kruskal-Wallis test, H = 10.45, df = 5, 0.05 < P < 0.10).
Strain wFex1 was more common in F. paralugubris (75%),
F. polyctena (55%) and F. rufa (39%), whereas wFex4 was
the most frequent in F. aquilonia (70%), F. lugubris (57%)

Nucleotide variation within strains
Both wFex1 and wFex4 had one common haplotype
found in most samples. Notably, in both cases the common haplotype was identical to that described from F.
exsecta [22]. In addition to these common sequences,
some rare wsp haplotypes were detected for both wFex1
and wFex4 in 25 samples (78% of the specimens), with 1–
3 point mutations per haplotype in wFex1 and 1–4 in
wFex4. As it was impossible to determine which mutations were errors made by the PCR polymerase enzyme,
none of the singletons in wsp sequences were taken into
account in further analysis. However, when the same
mutation within a Wolbachia strain was found in at least

The wsp haplotype networks showed that shared Wolbachia haplotypes were found within as well as between
species (Fig. 1a, b). The network of strain wFex1 (Fig. 1a)

cies (e.g. sample P-21 from French F. lugubris and E-10-2
from Siberian F. pratensis that were associated to mtDNA
haplotypes J and V, respectively). There were only two
cases in wFex4 (Fig. 1b) where wsp haplotypes that shared
a common mutation were associated to a same mtDNA
haplotype (haplotypes H and P).
Possible association of the wsp haplotypes and the
mtDNA haplotype lineages was examined as follows. (1)
The wsp sequences that differed from the most common
type by sharing identical nucleotide variants were considered to form a cluster (putatively a clade). There were
eight and seven such clades in wFex1 and wFex4 strains,
respectively (Fig. 1a, b). (2) The distances between all
pairs of mtDNA haplotypes were calculated as the number
of nodes separating the haplotypes in the mitochondrial
phylogenetic tree [Fig. 2 in ref. [20]]. (3) For each wsp
clade we calculated the mean distance between the associated mtDNA haplotypes. (4) The overall congruence of
the wsp and mtDNA sequence divergence was calculated
as the sum of these mean distances over all the clades. (5)
The significance of the congruence was tested by permuting the mtDNA haplotypes while keeping the wsp network
fixed, and recalculating the distances. The significance of
the observed association was inferred by repeating the
permutations for a thousand times. Using this method,
we found a significant association between Wolbachia
haplotypes and mtDNA haplotypes for the strain wFex1
(P = 0.04) but not for the strain wFex4 (P = 0.30).
Recombinant sequences
Sequence alignments and comparisons of the wsp
sequences revealed haplotypes that looked as if recombinants between wFex1 and wFex4 in samples of F. aquilonia and F. polyctena. Since all were found only once
among the initially sequenced clones, 84 additional
clones were sequenced from three of samples. Despite the
increment, none of the putative recombinant strains were
rediscovered. To investigate whether the putative recombinants were true or PCR artifacts we designed PCR primers which amplify wFex1-wFex4 recombinants (forward:
5'-GGTATTGCACATAAATCAGGCA-3' and reverse 5'AAACTGCATGTCCTCCTTTATC-3') and wFex4-wFex1
recombinants
(forward
5'-GGGACTGATGATGTTGATCCT-3' and reverse 5'-TTGAGTTCCCCTTTGCCGTC3'). The PCR assays did not result in correctly sized bands
in any of the original samples when the products were run
on an agarose gel, suggesting that the observed wFex1wFex4 recombinants were PCR artifacts. However, the
additional sequencing also identified in F. aquilonia a haplotype that was 99.3% similar to strain wFex3 from the ant
F. exsecta [22]. The strain wFex3 has been characterized as
a recombinant between wFex2 and wFex4 [22]. As we did
not find the strain wFex2 in any of our F. aquilonia samples, the new haplotype cannot be explained as a PCR arti-

fact. Therefore, this haplotype represents an additional
infection by a strain which is a variant of the previously
described recombinant strain wFex3 or a novel natural
recombinant between wFex2 and wFex4.

Discussion
The major finding of this study is the extensive sharing of
Wolbachia infections between species of F. rufa group
wood ants. All the specimens analysed were infected,
most of them with at least two different strains, and all the
species carried the same two Wolbachia strains wFex1 and
wFex4, even the same wsp haplotypes of the strains. In
addition, F. aquilonia and F. rufa had strains (one and two,
respectively) that were not detected in the other species.
The widespread infection gives no support to the hypotheses that the infection states might depend on the social
structure of the species [16,17]. Our samples included
species that have commonly a single queen in a colony
(e.g. F. rufa, F. pratensis) and species that build large networks of colonies with hundreds of queens (F. aquilonia,
F. paralugubris, F. polyctena).
Two possible scenarios can explain the sharing of Wolbachia infection in the wood ants. First, Wolbachia infection could have occurred in a common ancestor predating
the speciation of F. rufa group ants. This would mean that
the two Wolbachia infections have been maintained stably
in the ants for a long period of time, more than half a million years [20]. Alternatively, Wolbachia infections could
have been transmitted horizontally between the wood ant
species.
Under the hypothesis that the Wolbachia infections are
ancestral, predating the divergence of the host species, we
might expect some degree of evolutionary divergence
between the independently evolving Wolbachia lineages.
However, no fixed nucleotide substitutions were observed
in wsp sequences from the different ant species. We can
use some simple calculations to evaluate whether this lack
of divergence is still compatible with independent evolution of the gene lineages. The probability P0 of observing
no substitutions in either of the two shared strains wFex1
and wFex4 when the expected number is k per strain can
be obtained from the Poisson distribution as P0 = e-2k. Setting P0 = 0.05, the standard significance threshold, the
limiting value of k is 1.5. This means that we can reject the
hypothesis of a single ancestral infection if the expected
number of nucleotide substitutions in wsp in the internal
branches is k ≥ 1.5. The 2051 bp long mtDNA sequences
of the Formica rufa group had a total of 36 nucleotide substitutions in the internal branches of the haplotype network [20]. This means that for the probability of not
observing any taxon specific substitutions in either of the
two 600 bp wsp sequences to exceed 5%, the wsp gene has

to evolve at least seven times more slowly than the ant
mtDNA [(36/2051)/(1.5/600) = 7].
Wenseleers [13] have estimated that the wsp gene in Wolbachia infecting ants evolve at a rate of 0.2% per million
years (MY), which is roughly ten times more slowly than
the rate of 2% per MY estimated for mtDNA in Drosophila
[23]. Given these estimates, the persistence of ancestral
Wolbachia infections appears plausible. However, Wolbachia with identical wsp sequences (both wFex1 and
wFex4) have also been found in the ant F. exsecta [22],
which has been separated from the F. rufa group by 3.5 –
4 million years [21]. A calculation similar to that above
shows that here the evolutionary rates of host mtDNA and
Wolbachia wsp have to differ by a factor 22 to be consistent
with old ancestral infections.
Even though the above rate estimates include some uncertainty, we can conclude that the sharing of identical Wolbachia infections between F. exsecta and the species of the
F. rufa group is more likely to be the result of horizontal
transfer than the persistence of an ancestral infection. The
horizontal transfers need not be recent as the wsp gene
likely evolves more slowly than mtDNA and the Wolbachia infections may have remained unchanged for some
time. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that ants
of the F. rufa group share an ancestral Wolbachia infection
with strains wFex1 and wFex4, with neither strain fixing
mutations since the split of the host species. Particularly,
the phylogenies of wFex1 and mtDNA showed significant,
although weak congruence.
When considering only those wsp mutations which are
shared between different ant samples, we may try to evaluate how frequently horizontal transmission has
occurred. Some of the wsp haplotypes are shared between
samples with the same mitochondrial haplotype. These
include sharing of wFex1 haplotypes by F. aquilonia samples with a mtDNA haplotype P in Sweden (S-67-3) and
Siberia (E-5-2), and by F. polyctena from the Urals and F.
paralugubris from Switzerland carrying the mtDNA haplotype O, and by F. lugubris from Siberia with mtDNA haplotype A. The mtDNA haplotypes A and C (in F. lugubris
from Siberia) also carry related wFex1 haplotypes that
could originate from the same ancestor, assuming that
this haplotype has been lost from the sample with
mtDNA haplotype B (or occurs with such a low frequency
that it was not detected by us). Haplotypes of the strain
wFex4 show only two cases where ant samples with the
same mtDNA haplotype share a wsp haplotype, namely F.
aquilonia from Sweden (S-113) and the Urals (U-84-2)
that carry the haplotype P, and F. lugubris from France
with mtDNA haplotype H. In these cases, vertical transmission is the most likely explanation for the sharing of
wsp haplotypes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/55

There are, however, wsp haplotypes that are shared
between samples that have mitochondrial haplotypes separated by more than 20 mutations (Fig. 1a, b, c). If these
cases were explained by vertical transmission of an ancestral wsp haplotype, we would have to invoke repeated wsp
haplotype loss in other mitochondrial lineages that originate from the same ancestor. In addition to this frequent
haplotype loss, we would need to assume that the Wolbachia infections in the ants have retained ancestral polymorphism, maintaining both these wsp haplotypes and
the common haplotypes of wFex1 and wFex4 that were
found from all samples. These requirements are strong
and it is more plausible that sharing of mutated wsp haplotypes by different mitochondrial haplotypes has
resulted from frequent horizontal transfer of Wolbachia.
The haplotype networks had eight clear cases of this type,
three in wFex1 (including the haplotype pairs J & V, A & V
and A & T) and five in wFex4 (including the haplotype
pairs I & P, T & H, N & P, T & B, and H & O). The inferred
number of horizontal transfers may greatly underestimate
the actual number, as is known to be the case for recombination events [24].
Horizontal transmission is not as rare as previously
thought [25-27], and has been suggested to have occurred
relatively frequently in the fire ants [28]. In the case of vertical transmission, the absence of wsp haplotypes from
other samples of the same matriline could be due to haplotype loss or failure to amplify low frequency variants.
Strain loss has been suggested to have occurred in the fire
ants Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri [17], and in the Argentine ant Linepithema humile [19]. In both cases the loss has
been connected to invasion of new habitats, and the loss
may have taken place either through founder effects or
through environmental curing due to the sudden change
in climate and/or diet. F. rufa group ants have colonized
Eurasia before and during the last glaciation [20]. As a
consequence there has been ample opportunity for both
founder effects and climatic changes to cause the loss of
infections. However, the association of wsp haplotypes
and mtDNA haplotypes point more strongly towards
recent horizontal transmission than selective strain loss of
an ancestral wsp haplotype from some mitochondrial lineages, particularly in wFex4.
As mentioned above, horizontal transmission has evidently happened between different Formica ants as well as
between ants and other insects. According to blastn
searches in GenBank, Wolbachia strain wFex1 is identical
with strain wDes from the tephritid fruit fly Dacus destillatoria [29], and differs by only 0.6% from a strain identified
from the raspberry fruit worm Byturus unicolor [30]. In
addition to wFex1 and wFex4, F. rufa contained two other
strains, wFex2 and wFrufa. The closest matches of wFex2
in a blastn search were strains from a butterfly Nymphalis

xanthomelas [31], with a mere 0.4% sequence difference
and from a leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex insinuator [32]
with a 1.1% difference. The strain wFrufa differed 1.4%
from group B Wolbachia strain wSdagB1 from the ant
Solenopsis daguerrei and a strain wDiaspp2 from the spider
Diaea sp. r1 NSI [33,34]. In contrast to the incidence of
wFex1, strain wFex4 has thus far been described only from
the ants F. truncorum and F. exsecta [14,22]. The strain
closest to wFex4 is from a parasitoid wasp Spalangia cameroni with 6.8% sequence difference.
Some of our samples contained unique Wolbachia strains.
The presence of wFex2 and wFrufa exclusively in F. rufa
indicates that these strains have invaded F. rufa relatively
recently after the closely related mitochondria of F. rufa
and F. polyctena have diverged. Another possibility is that
wFex2 and wFrufa have been lost from the other species.
Similar arguments hold for the strain variant of wFex3
found in Russian F. aquilonia.
All the wFex1-wFex4 recombinant strains detected in our
assay turned out to be likely PCR artifacts, even though
recombinants between strains have been detected in ants
[22]. The fact that the simultaneous amplification of very
similar sequences can lead to the amplification of spurious recombinants is not new [e.g. [35]]. Our results indicate that when multiple Wolbachia infections are assayed
by PCR, special attention should be paid to the presence
of possible recombinant strains. In a symbiont which is
known to recombine, additional diagnostic tests should
be applied in order to separate true from false recombinants.

Conclusion
We have studied Wolbachia transmission dynamics in Formica wood ants by comparing Wolbachia strains with the
associated host mtDNA haplotypes. Our results show that
both horizontal and vertical transmission of Wolbachia
have been important in the infection history of these ants.
We found extensive sharing between ant species not only
of the same Wolbachia strains (wFex1 and wFex4) but even
of identical wsp haplotypes of these strains. The presence
of identical wsp haplotypes of the two common Wolbachia
strains also in a more distant species F. exsecta gives support to the hypothesis that horizontal transmission has
been an important factor behind the uniform distribution
of Wolbachia strains in Formica ants. In addition, the finding that Formica wood ants with distant mtDNA haplotypes share the same rare wsp haplotypes is more plausibly
explained by horizontal transmission. However, the significant, although weak, congruence between the phylogenetic networks of mtDNA and wsp of wFex1 also
suggests the significance of vertical transmission. In addition to the two prevailing strains, three separate strains
were found in eastern Russia, pointing to the existence of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/55

geographically restricted distribution of some strains. The
fact that all the ants were infected irrespective of the family structure of their societies gives no support to the proposed hypotheses that the spreading of Wolbachia in ants
might be associated to the types of their societies.

Methods
Samples
The ant species used in this study were F. aquilonia, F. lugubris, F. paralugubris, F. polyctena, F. pratensis and F. rufa,
which belong to the F. rufa group ants [36]. The 32 worker
ant DNA samples and their mtDNA haplotypes were
attained from the study of Goropashnaya, Fedorov and
Pamilo [20]. The samples, their geographical locations
and the mtDNA haplotypes are listed in Table 1.
Wolbachia strain identification
A fragment of the gene encoding the Wolbachia surface
protein WSP was amplified by PCR from the 32 ant samples using primers wsp81F and wsp691R [37]. Cycling
conditions were 95°C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of
95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min and
finally 72°C for 5 min. A negative control was included in
the PCR. Approximately 5 µl of the obtained PCR product
was run on a 1.5% agarose gel to ensure the correct size of
the amplified fragment. Remaining PCR products were
purified with a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and cloned with a TOPO TA Cloning
Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Bacterial colonies grown
overnight were suspended in 50 µl of sterile water and
screened with PCR. A new PCR for sequencing was performed for the positive clones. The PCR product was
sequenced on one or both strands using a BigDye Terminator v3.0 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and run on an ABI 377 automated sequencer.

Sequences were aligned and compared with the program
Sequencher v. 4.0.5 (Gene Codes Corporation). Wolbachia strains were identified using blastn searches in GenBank. Haplotype networks were constructed using
statistical parsimony method implemented in the program TCS [38].
Comparison of Wolbachia and mtDNA phylogenies
The possible congruence of the Wolbachia and mtDNA
phylogenies was examined by testing whether the wsp
haplotypes that share a variant nucleotide are associated
to phylogenetically similar mtDNA haplotypes. This was
done by permuting the mtDNA haplotypes (see Results
for a detailed description).
