Reliance on selenium during evolution not imminent.</p>

Abstract
Background: Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element that occurs in proteins in the form of
selenocysteine (Sec). It is transported throughout the body in the form of Sec residues in
Selenoprotein P (SelP), a plasma protein of unclear origin recently proposed as an experimental
marker of dietary Se status.
Results: Here, we report that the amino-terminal domain of SelP is distantly related to ancestral
bacterial thiol oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin superfamily, and that its carboxy-terminal Se
transport domain may have originated in early metazoan evolution by de novo accumulation of Sec
residues. Reconstruction of evolutionary changes in the Se transport domain indicates a decrease
in Sec content of SelP specifically in the mammalian lineage via replacement of Sec with cysteine
(Cys). Sec content of mammalian SelPs varies more than two-fold and is lowest in rodents and
primates. Compared to mammals, fish show higher Sec content of SelP, larger selenoproteomes,
elevated SelP gene expression, and higher levels of tissue Se. In addition, mammals replaced Sec
with Cys in several proteins and lost several selenoproteins altogether, whereas such events are
not found in fish.
Conclusion: These data suggest that evolution from fish to mammals was accompanied by
decreased use of Sec and that analyses of SelP, selenoproteomes and Sec/Cys transitions provide
a genetic marker of utilization of this trace element in vertebrates. The evolved reduced reliance
on Se raises questions regarding the need to maximize selenoprotein expression by Se dietary
supplements in situations when pathology is not imminent, a currently accepted practice.

Background

Several trace elements are essential micronutrients in
humans and animals, but why some organisms utilize certain
trace elements to a greater extent than others is not understood. It is also unknown how trace elements were utilized by
extinct organisms, how the utilization changed during evolu-

tion, and how this affected their current use. These questions
are not only important in addressing the roles trace elements
played and continue to play in biology, but also have important implications with regard to human health, animal husbandry and veterinary practice. Dietary supplementation

biofactors are an accepted practice in human and animal
health care [1,2]. The Food and Nutrition Board of the
National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences, USA, set recommended dietary allowances (RDA), the
estimated daily amount of a substance thought to be necessary for maintenance of good health. Trace elements are
prominently featured in these reports as well as in labels on
common foods.

[19]. The high content of Se in these proteins has led to the
hypothesis that SelP acts as a transport protein and is responsible for Se delivery to various organs and tissues [25]. Recent
studies support this idea [26-29]. In mammals, SelP is primarily synthesized in the liver and delivers Se to kidney, brain,
testes, and other organs. Isolated hepatic SelP deficiency does
not alter brain Se levels [30], yet brain and in particular hippocampal Se levels were lowered by disruption of the gene
encoding SelP, but not by Se deficiency [31]. SelP has two
functional SECIS elements in the 3' untranslated region
(UTR) [32], whereas a single SECIS element was reported in
all other known selenoprotein genes. The first UGA codon in
SelP is served primarily by a relatively inefficient distal SECIS
element, whereas the other SECIS element is responsible for
insertion of all other Sec residues [33]. The high Sec content
of the carboxy-terminal Sec-rich domain of SelP was shown to
be required for the role of this protein in Se transport [34].

One of the trace elements, selenium (Se), represents a particularly interesting case. It is used in proteins in the form of
selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st naturally occurring amino acid
in the genetic code [3-5]. Sec differs from cysteine (Cys) by a
single atom (Se versus S). Sec is encoded by the UGA codon
and its co-translational insertion into protein requires an
RNA structure known as the SECIS (for SEC Insertion
Sequence) element. Selenoproteins are important antioxidant enzymes and also have other redox functions [6]. Several
human disorders have been associated with Se deficiency,
such as Keshan disease, Kashin-Beck disease and myxedematous endemic cretinism (OMIM identifiers 606210 and
601484) [7,8]. The RDA for Se is based on the amount
required to maximize the synthesis of glutathione peroxidase
(GPx)3 [9]. Current US dietary recommendations for Se for
both men and women are 55 μg/day [10]. Although the normal intake of Se by eating food is sufficient to meet the RDA
for this essential nutrient everywhere in the US, approximately 20-30% of Americans consume multivitamin/mineral
supplements daily [11], and a significant part of them contain
Se.
We have previously analyzed the occurrence of selenoproteins and Se utilization traits in prokaryotes and found that
only 20% of these organisms utilize Sec [12]. Sec utilization in
eukaryotes is also sporadic, and certain eukaryotes, such as
fungi, vascular plants and some insects, do not utilize it [13].
However, in mammals, Se is an essential trace element. In
mice, embryonic lethality is caused by disruption in several
selenoprotein genes, such as those encoding thioredoxin
reductase (TR)1 and TR3, and GPx4 [14-16], and several additional selenoproteins were implicated in protection against
disease [17,18]. Previously analyzed mammalian selenoproteomes consist of 24-25 selenoproteins, whereas lower
eukaryotes and prokaryotes mostly have very few of these
proteins (for example, only 4 selenoproteins have been found
in Plasmodium and 3 in Escherichia coli) [19-22]. These
observations established Se genetics and genomics as a useful
evolutionary model system to address the issues of evolutionary changes in utilization of this trace element as well as the
use of Se by living and extinct organisms.
In the current study, we report on the use of Selenoprotein P
(SelP), selenoproteomes and Sec/Cys transitions as a genetic
marker to assess the status and evolutionary trends in Sec and
Se utilization. SelP accounts for the major pool of plasma Se
[23,24]. Human, mouse and rat SelPs have 10 Sec residues

Volume 9, Issue 3, Article R62

Lobanov et al. R62.2

SelP was recently proposed as an experimental marker of Se
utilization in humans that could be more accurate than the
currently used GPx3 marker [9]. It was found that while GPx3
expression is saturated by the current RDA for Se, the specific
amount of Se needed to achieve maximal expression of SelP is
approximately 100 μg/day. Interestingly, both SelP and GPx3
studies were based on the premise that saturated expression
of these proteins is required for optimal health and that even
partial deficiency in any selenoprotein may be detrimental.
However, in the current study, genomics analyses suggested a
trend toward reduced utilization of Se in mammals, which
could be seen at the level of both Sec content of SelP and unidirectional Sec/Cys transitions in vertebrate selenoproteins.
These data are discussed with regard to the currently
accepted practice of maximizing selenoprotein expression by
dietary supplements.

Results and discussion
Occurrence of SelP homologs in organisms from
nematodes to mammals
SelP was previously identified in fish, birds, and mammals.
We carried out PSI-BLAST analyses with known SelP
sequences as queries to search protein databases for distant
SelP homologs. The sequences identified served as new queries in searches for SelP homologs in nucleotide sequence
databases, including non-redundant, expressed sequence tag
(EST), completed genome, whole genome shotgun (WGS),
high throughput genome sequence and nucleotide trace databases. These searches identified SelP homologs in organisms
from nematodes and primitive aquatic animals to mammals,
suggesting that SelP evolved in an early metazoan lineage
rather than in vertebrates as previously thought. However,
several invertebrate animals characterized by completely
sequenced genomes (for example, Drosophila) lacked SelP,
suggesting that these organisms lost these proteins during
evolution. One of the earliest metazoans, Trichoplax

adhaerens, also lacked SelP, yet we detected at least 21
selenoproteins in this organism (data not shown).

or downstream SelP sequences, was observed in several
insect genomes. Exon 5 was the largest exon in SelP genes and
coded for the remainder of the SelP sequence, including Hisrich and Sec-rich regions, and also included the 3'-UTR. SelP
is known to occur in two forms, SelPa and SelPb, that differ by
the presence of the Sec-rich region. Both forms have the Hisrich region that mediates heparin binding and could account
for the membrane binding properties of SelP [39].

We developed an additional approach to identify SelP
sequences, wherein we searched genome and EST databases
for occurrence of two proximal SECIS elements (Figure S1 in
Additional data file 1). We screened all ESTs available in GenBank (March 2007), and the sequences upstream of two candidate SECIS elements were analyzed in three open reading
frames for similarity to known proteins. This procedure
yielded 32 full or partial non-redundant SelP sequences, most
of which were of fish and mammalian origin. Only two additional sequences were detected, one of which, from the plant
Populus tremuloides, could not be functional because higher
plants lack selenoprotein genes, and the other sequence corresponded to Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda SelW containing one predicted SECIS in the open reading frame and the
second in the 3'-UTR. We recently reported that coding
region SECIS elements are functional in higher eukaryotes
[35], but 3'-UTR structures are more efficient. Thus, twoSECIS mRNAs are a unique feature of SelP sequences, and
the search for proximal SECIS elements can specifically recognize SelP in sequence databases. These data suggest that
additional widely distributed selenoproteins containing
many (for example, more than two) Sec are either extremely
rare or do not exist.

SelP has a thioredoxin-fold domain
Genomic analyses revealed that the human and mouse SelP
genes consisted of five exons (Figure 1a), with the first exon
corresponding to the 5' end of the 5'-UTR, exons 2-4 to the
coding region, and exon 5 to the carboxy-terminal part of the
protein and the 3'-UTR. Multiple alignment of SelPs (Figure
S2 in Additional data file 1) revealed highly conserved
sequences within the amino-terminal region (coded by exons
2-4), which had a single Sec. Conservation of carboxy-terminal sequences was low, and their Sec content varied significantly. Structural analyses of SelP sequences using 3D-Jury
[36] revealed similarity of amino-terminal sequences (coded
by exons 2 and 3) to thioredoxin fold proteins (Figure 2), and
showed that the location of the UxxC motif in SelP corresponded to the CxxC motif in thioredoxins. This observation
suggests a redox function of the amino-terminal domain. Further analysis showed that five proteins with J-scores of 50.2071.60 (threshold value is 50) are structurally related to SelP,
including thiol-disulfide interchange proteins TlpA and thioldisulfide oxidoreductase ResA sequences. TlpA and ResA are
bacterial protein disulfide reductases that play important
roles in cytochrome c maturation and represent membrane
anchored proteins with a thioredoxin domain containing a
CxxC motif [37,38]. These observations further suggest a
redox function of the amino-terminal domain of SelP.
Immediately downstream of the Trx-fold domain was a conserved region (coded by exon 4), which we designate as the
Cys-rich domain (Figure 1b). This sequence, but not upstream

In addition to the selenium transport function [26,28], SelP
was shown to reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides in a cellfree in-vitro system [40]. This function may be mediated by
the amino-terminal domain. An attractive possibility is that
the amino-terminal domain serves as a redox partner for the
carboxy-terminal Sec-rich region of SelP. For example, the
amino-terminal domain could be responsible for keeping Sec
residues in the oxidized state while the protein is in transit in
the circulatory system, or for the reduction of Sec in SelP
upon import of this protein into cells. Controlled oxidation of
Sec residues to selenenylsulfides and diselenides may protect
them against oxidation of Se to selenenic and further oxidized
forms, which may lead to the loss of Se from SelP.

Sec content of SelP sequences
In contrast to a single human SelP containing 10 Sec residues
[41], zebrafish has 2 SelP isozymes [42], with SelPa and SelPb
containing 17 and 1 Sec residue, respectively [19,43]. We
examined the collection of SelP sequences derived from
genomic, non-redundant and EST databases and found that
the Sec content of SelP varied from zero to 28. Moreover, the
Sec content of mammalian SelP varied more than two-fold;
for example, dog SelP had 15 Sec residues, whereas guinea pig
SelP had 7. Organisms living in aquatic habitats, such as fish,
amphibians and some marine invertebrates, possessed a particularly large number of Sec residues. Sea urchin SelP with
its 28 Sec residues (GenBank: EC436872.1, EC432945.1 and
CD311605.1) had a conserved amino-terminal domain, but we
could not detect homology of its Sec-rich carboxy-terminal
region to other SelPs. The elevated use of Sec in aquatic SelPs
might be related to both increased Se utilization and food
preferences. Sea urchins mainly feed on algae, which themselves have many selenoproteins [44].
All SelPb sequences had a single Sec, with the exception of
Xenopus SelPb, which had Cys in place of Sec. Since fish, bird
and mammalian SelPb sequences contain Sec, it appears that
this residue was replaced with Cys in frog SelPb. PSI-BLAST
searches identified a distant Cys-containing homolog of SelP
in Caenorhabditis elegans (GenBank: NP_494277.2). It contains 23 Cys residues and is annotated as a prion-like-(Q/Nrich)-domain protein. C. elegans has only one selenoprotein
and requires very little Se. In addition, the lack of Sec in the
SelP-like protein precludes its participation in Se delivery in
this organism. Therefore, the function of this protein is likely
determined by the Trx-fold domain. Another Cys containing

Differences between fish and mammalian
selenoproteomes
Comparison of Sec content of SelPs from various organisms
revealed that fish contained more Sec residues than mammals (Figure 3; Figures S3 and S4 in Additional data file 1).
Mammalian selenoproteomes were previously thought to
represent a set of eukaryotic selenoproteins. However, several selenoproteins were identified recently (for example,

SelJ, SelL and Fep15) that occur only in fish and several other
aquatic organisms. Did these proteins evolve in aquatic
organisms after diverging from mammals or were they lost in
mammals? More generally, how does the change in Sec content of SelP relate to the changes in the composition of
selenoproteomes?
To address these questions, we reconstructed selenoproteomes of all vertebrates for which extensive genome
sequence information is available, including 19 mammals, 4
fish, 1 bird and 2 amphibians (Figure 4). Consistent with the

high Sec content of fish SelPs, the largest selenoproteomes
were detected in these organisms. We recently proposed that
aquatic environments may favor increased reliance on Se in
lower eukaryotes via unknown environmental factors [44].
Can this aquatic/terrestrial observation be extended to higher
eukaryotes? Note that humans and large terrestrial mammals
possess the protective cover of skin, which together with their
large size may make their intraorganismal environment more
similar to that of their aquatic ancestors. Interestingly, comparison of selenoproteomes from aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates revealed an 'aquatic/terrestrial' trend: fish had 32-34
selenoproteins, whereas mammals had 23-25.
However, more important was the observation that several
fish selenoproteins had homologs in mammals in which Cys
was present in place of Sec (for example, SelU1, SelU2, SelU3,
a SelW-like protein Rdx12 and GPx6). In contrast, no fish
could be found that had Cys orthologs of mammalian selenoproteins, suggesting unidirectional loss of Sec in mammals.
In addition, some fish selenoproteins that also occurred in
invertebrates and/or amphibians and birds (for example,
SelPb, SelL, Fep15, and SelJ) had no mammalian counterparts, suggesting their loss in mammals. The timing of
selenoprotein gene loss and Sec-to-Cys conversions differed
for various vertebrate selenoproteins. For example, SelU is a
selenoprotein in fish and many lower eukaryotes, and it also
occurs in the Sec form in an early mammal, the platypus,
whereas other mammals possess only the Cys version. Thus,
Sec in SelU was replaced with Cys in early mammals. Likewise, SelPb is found in fish, birds, and frogs, and is present in
platypus and opossum, but not in placental mammals (with
the notable exception of armadillo, one of the earliest placental mammals). Thus, SelPb also was lost in early mammals,
but later than SelU. The other events of selenoprotein loss
(for example, of SelL) could be extended to all mammals or to
a select group of mammals (for example, GPx6 in rodents).
There are several possible explanations for the decreased content of selenoproteins in terrestrial eukaryotes. First, the loss

may be due to lower bioavailability of Se in terrestrial habitats. This would be similar to the decreased utilization of
nutrients, such as nitrogen, in certain environments [45] or
reduced availability of iron in oxygenated ocean [46,47].
Although the overall concentration of bioavailable Se does not
appear to be lower in terrestrial environments [48], aquatic
organisms would have the advantage of concentrating this
trace element due to constant exposure to the aquatic source
of Se. In addition, terrestrial organisms adapted to preserve
water; however, this feature might have reduced their exposure to Se and perhaps certain other nutrients and micronutrients in the environment. Whereas the reduced
bioavailability of Se would primarily apply to unicellular and
small eukaryotes, following the food chain, most terrestrial
organisms would reduce their Se content.
A second possibility for the loss of selenoproteins in terrestrial organisms is the extreme reactivity of Sec, which is the
same chemical property that makes Se so important to life.
Air has higher availability and a higher content of oxygen
compared to water, which should make selenoproteins more
susceptible to oxidative damage as well as cause damage
themselves due to side reactions of Sec. An additional factor
for toxicity of Sec may be an increased UV radiation in terrestrial environments, which may result in generation of reactive
oxygen species that are capable of damaging selenoproteins.
Therefore, the widespread use of these proteins in the face of
high oxygen may be detrimental to terrestrial life, although
less so for large organisms (this could explain the presence of
relatively large selenoproteomes in mammals compared to
the selenoproteome size of insects and unicellular organisms). Participation of selenoproteins in essential cellular
processes would then pose a serious challenge to organisms
that utilize these proteins. The reduced Sec content of mammalian SelPs may then be a consequence of lower Se requirement. Since SelP functions as a Se transport protein, it is
possible that organisms with smaller selenoproteomes and
lower expression of selenoproteins require less Se.

Occurrence of Cys and Sec in vertebrate SelP sequences
Occurrence of Cys and Sec in vertebrate SelP sequences. The figure shows amino acids that occur in 20 positions, where Sec is found in vertebrate SelPs.
Sec residues are shown by the red letter U, and Cys residues by the letter C. Cys residues encoded by TGT are highlighted in blue and those by TGC in
green. Hyphens ('-') indicate that sequence information was not available for this region, and empty cells correspond to the situations where an amino acid
residue other than Sec or Cys is used.

Many Sec positions are occupied by Cys in mammalian
SelPs
Analysis of the multiple sequence alignment of SelP
sequences (Figure S2 in Additional data file 1) revealed strong
conservation of Sec residues, although some positions were
less conserved than others. The areas of highest conservation
included the first Sec and several Sec residues in the very car-

boxy-terminal region, which were nearly 100% conserved in
vertebrates. Interestingly, the majority of less conserved Sec
positions were occupied specifically by Cys residues. Sec/Cys
pairs in homologous sequences is a characteristic feature of
selenoproteins, which accounts for evolution of these proteins [12] and helps identify these proteins in sequence databases [49,50]. Thus, proteins with multiple Sec residues also

Selenoproteomes and the Sec content of SelPs

completely or partially sequenced genomes (right panel) are shown. Red circles with ticks show the presence of selenoproteins. Blue circles with ticks
indicate the presence of Cys-containing homologs. Crossed black circles are used to show the loss of protein during evolution. Similarly, red and blue

exhibit this feature, even though their Sec/Cys replacements
occur more rapidly than in selenoproteins with a single Sec,
which often utilize these residues for catalysis [6].

Unidirectionality of Sec/Cys transitions in SelP
We analyzed the frequency of Sec-to-Cys and Cys-to-Sec
changes in SelP sequences that had the carboxy-terminal Se
transport domain (Figure 3). Among 20 positions where Sec
residues could be found in at least one vertebrate SelP, 13
positions had Cys forms in some SelPs, indicating that at least
two-thirds of Sec residues are replaceable with Cys in SelPs.
All 13 Sec/Cys transitions occurred in the Se transport
domain of SelP. To quantify Sec/Cys transitions, we considered that if at least two outgroup and one sister sequence had
the same amino acid (Sec or Cys), but the other sister
sequence had the opposite residue, a Sec/Cys transition could
be inferred (Figure 5a,b). Similarly, Sec loss (that is, replacement of Sec with amino acids other than Cys) and origin
(replacement of an amino acid other than Cys with Sec)
events were quantified (Figure 5c). Due to insufficient information, some Sec/Cys replacements remained unresolved.
The use of such strict criteria resulted in some
underestimation of Sec/Cys transitions, but provided reliable
inferences in both Sec-to-Cys and Cys-to-Sec directions that
could then be compared with each other.
With this approach, we detected 20 Sec-to-Cys transitions,
but only two Cys-to-Sec transitions. The total number of Cys
and Sec residues in analyzed vertebrate SelP sequences was
502 and 418, respectively. Therefore, Sec-to-Cys transitions
occurred 12 times more frequently than transitions in the
opposite direction. At the same time, the number of Cys-to-

Sec transitions was equal to both Sec loss and Sec origin from
amino acids other than Cys (that is, two each). Thus, the transitions involving Sec were largely unidirectional and resulted
in the replacement of Sec specifically with Cys. As expected,
TGA codons for Sec could be replaced in vertebrate SelPs with
TGC or TGT (14 and 3 transitions, respectively; 3 additional
transitions could not be resolved), and the newly evolved Cys
codons had a total of 24 subsequent TGT/TGC transitions
(Figure 5d).

Recent events of Sec loss, switch and gain in closely
related species
Analyses of Sec/Cys pairs also identified interesting cases of
recent Sec loss and gain events in vertebrates. As shown in
Figure S5a in Additional data file 1, even closely related species, such as chimpanzee and human, are characterized by
differences in Sec content of SelP; for example, chimpanzee
SelP has 9 Sec residues, human 10, and macaque and gorilla
12. Further analysis of SelP sequences indicated that there
were recent changes in Sec content in primate SelPs, wherein
2 Sec residues in human and 3 in chimpanzee SelPs were
replaced with Cys. Rodent SelPs also had a lower Sec content,
with the extreme case being guinea pigs, and all these Sec
losses were due to conversion of Sec to Cys. An additional
example of the recent change in Sec content is shown in Figure S5b in Additional data file 1, where a Sec in position 354
of SelP was replaced with Cys in Oryzias latipes. Interestingly, two Xenopus species have 18 Sec residues, but the positions of two Sec in these proteins are different and correspond
to Cys in the paired sequence (Figure S5c in Additional data
file 1). Combined with the quantitative analysis of Sec/Cys
transitions discussed above, the data show that Sec/Cys

in silico. Surprisingly, this analysis showed that most ESTs
corresponding to Danio rerio SelP are derived from kidney.
This observation suggests that in D. rerio a significant portion
of SelP is synthesized in kidney (Figure S7 in Additional data
file 1). Liver still appears to contribute significantly to SelP
synthesis, but in contrast to mice and rats, to a lower extent
than kidney. The number of SelP ESTs in fish was also higher
than that in mammals (Figure S7 in Additional data file 1).
Thus, not only is the Sec content of fish SelP higher than in
mammals, but gene expression of fish SelP is also higher.

Inference of Sec transitions
Inference of Sec transitions. (a) Sec-to-Cys transition. To infer such a
transition in a SelP sequence, we required the presence of two closest
outgroup sequences and a sister SelP sequence containing Sec. (b) Cys-toSec transition. To infer gain of Sec from Cys, we required two outgroup
sequences and one sister sequence to contain Cys. (c) Loss of Sec. If Sec
was present in two outgroup and one sister sequence, whereas the
corresponding position in the tested SelP sequence had an amino acid
other than Cys or Sec, the inference was Sec loss. (d) Sec/Cys transitions

transitions may go in either direction, or may show an overall
neutral transition (which is the situation in frogs) and, therefore, may serve as a sensor of demand for Se.
The analysis of Sec residues in SelPs also allowed us to
directly observe the evolution of new Sec residues. Compared
to other vertebrate SelPs, Xenopus sequences were extended
by several residues such that their last Sec codons corresponded to stop signals in fish and mammalian SelPs (Figure
S6 in Additional data file 1). We suggest that this example
illustrates a mechanism of evolution of a new Sec residue by
carboxy-terminal extension, wherein a stop codon (UAA or
UAG) changed to a Sec codon (UGA) and the next in-frame
stop codon became a new termination signal. A similar mechanism was previously suggested for the evolution of TRs from
the glutathione reductase family of proteins [51]. We suggest
that the carboxy-terminal domain of SelP evolved de novo by
extension of its carboxy-terminal sequences.

SelP expression
Previous studies have shown that mammalian SelP is synthesized primarily in liver [28]. We used UniGene EST ProfileViewer to examine expression levels of SelP in different species

Loss of Sec in mammalian SelPs accounts for
differences with fish SelP sequences
Recent, sporadic Sec loss in mammalian SelPs and changes in
the composition of selenoproteomes might represent a coordinated response to external pressure, that is, change in
habitat that forces an organism to reduce Sec use, which is
manifested in both Sec content of SelP and selenoproteomes.
Interestingly, the number of Sec residues seems to be
inversely proportional to the number of Cys in SelP sequences
(Figure S8 in Additional data file 1). Moreover, the number of
Sec residues in the most Sec-rich SelPs exceeded that of Cys.
If during transit in the circulatory system SelP protects its Sec
residues by controlled oxidation, selenenylsulfide bonds may
be a preferred chemical form of Sec residues. Indeed, such
bonds have previously been observed in rodent SelPs [52].
However, having significantly more Sec than Cys residues,
fish and amphibian SelPs are capable of protecting only a
fraction of Sec residues through selenenylsulfide bonds.
Thus, we predict that Sec-rich SelPs form diselenide bonds
that stabilize Sec residues. A disadvantage of diselenide
bonds is the difficulty of reducing them because diselenides
are characterized by very low redox potentials. Interestingly,
we recently identified a protein, SelL, that has a diselenide
bond, and the occurrence of this protein is restricted to
aquatic organisms, including fish, invertebrates and marine
bacteria [53]. Thus, it is possible that diselenide reduction
systems occur in aquatic organisms and may act on both SelL
and SelP, whereas mammals are unable to reduce diselenides
efficiently, lack SelL and utilize selenenylsulfides in SelP.
The relatively frequent replacement of Sec with Cys in the
Sec-rich domain of SelP in mammals contrasts with the conservation of Sec in the Trx-fold domain, suggesting that different evolutionary forces act on Sec sites in the amino- and
carboxy-terminal domains. This idea is further supported by
the occurrence of SelPb (shorter version of SelP) in fish,
amphibians and early mammals.

Should selenoprotein expression be maximized?
The evolved reduced utilization of Sec in mammals raises
important questions in human and animal nutrition. Both
previous and current clinical trials operate under the assumption that selenoprotein expression should be maximized.
Although GPx3 expression is maximized by 55 μg of Se per
day (and SelP approximately 100 μg/day), these dietary levels

are readily exceeded in the US and most other countries,
without dietary supplementation, by consuming regular
foods. Clearly, selenoprotein expression is regulated such
that humans do not fully utilize the available dietary selenium, any excess of which is excreted in the form of a selenosugar [54]. In this regard, whether selenoprotein expression
should be maximized irrespective of health status, genotype,
or diet, is not clear, and should be addressed in future studies.
The consistent loss of Sec in SelP, replacement of Sec residues
with Cys in some proteins, and loss of several selenoproteins
in mammals under the conditions when this micronutrient is
not limiting suggest a highly regulated and balanced use of
this trace element. Selenium is best known for its cancer chemoprevention activity, but previous clinical studies and many
studies involving animal models utilized highly contrasting,
and often physiologically irrelevant, amounts of Se. It would
be particularly important to establish whether Se dietary supplements are useful in situations when disease is not imminent, which is a currently accepted practice. Alternatively, the
supplements may be helpful when disruption in redox homeostasis is implicated in disease, or in old age, to alleviate oxidative damage. But it is possible that the supplements should
not be used at all and that internal regulation of selenoprotein
expression and evolutionary adaptations rather than availability of excess dietary selenium govern the use of this trace
element.

ments located within a single WGS read, EST or other
nucleotide sequences. Using this program, we scanned the
indicated datasets for sequences containing two SECIS elements on the same strand. A default pattern of SECISearch
was used for SECIS element identification. A COVE program
[59] with covariance matrix optimized for SECIS elements
(AVL and VNG, unpublished) was applied to reduce the
number of false positives, and all hits with a COVE score
below 15 were dismissed. CLUSTALX was used to prepare
multiple alignments.

Additional data files

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 includes supplementary figures S1-S8.

Materials and methods
Databases and programs
Nucleotide, EST and predicted protein sequences from
organisms used in this study were downloaded from NCBI
[55]. SECISearch [19] was used for identification of SECIS
elements. Stand-alone versions of BLAST and FASTA were
used in similarity searches. CLUSTALX was utilized for
sequence analysis. Alignment shading was performed using
BoxShade web-server [56]. The evolutionary tree was reconstructed using the work of Ciccarelli et al. [57]. Missing
branches were filled using a maximum parsimony (characterbased tree estimation method) approach. The implication
was that the preferred phylogenetic tree represents the tree
that would require the least number of evolutionary changes.
The Protpars program of the PHYLIP package [58] was used
to generate a maximum parsimony tree.

Identification of SelP sequences and homologs of
known selenoproteins
SelP sequences were identified with TBLASTN in EST, WGS
and NR databases. BLASTN was used to assemble SelP
sequences from overlapping sequences. Selenoproteome
analysis was carried out using BLASTP, TBLASTN and PSIBLAST as described elsewhere [49], using a full set of known
eukaryotic selenoproteins as a query set of sequences. A specialized version of SECISearch [19] was developed for specific
detection of 3'-UTRs of SelP sequences. The modifications
included a subroutine for the identification of two SECIS ele-
