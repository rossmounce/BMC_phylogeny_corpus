Abstract
Background: The root apical meristem of crop and model legume Medicago truncatula is a
significantly different stem cell system to that of the widely studied model plant species Arabidopsis
thaliana. In this study we used the Affymetrix Medicago GeneChip® to compare the transcriptomes
of meristem and non-meristematic root to identify root meristem specific candidate genes.
Results: Using mRNA from root meristem and non-meristem we were able to identify 324 and
363 transcripts differentially expressed from the two regions. With bioinformatics tools developed
to functionally annotate the Medicago genome array we could identify significant changes in
metabolism, signalling and the differentially expression of 55 transcription factors in meristematic
and non-meristematic roots.
Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive analysis of M. truncatula root meristem cells using this
genome array. This data will facilitate the mapping of regulatory and metabolic networks involved
in the open root meristem of M. truncatula and provides candidates for functional analysis.

Background
The root and shoot apical meristems (RAM and SAM) are
established during embryogenesis and serve as a source of
stem cells for plant growth and organogenesis [1]. The
RAM produces all the tissues of the primary root by a
highly defined pattern of cell divisions [2]. Cells produced
by the meristem, known as initials, undergo proliferative
cell divisions as they are added to files of different cell
types and their fate is determined by positional information [3,4]. The stem cell niche in the root is maintained by
a small group of cells called the quiescent centre (QC)
[5,6], the QC inhibits the division of surrounding cells

and is generated and maintained by the accumulation of
auxin via the PIN auxin efflux carriers; in Arabidopsis the
genes PLETHORA1, PLETHORA2, SCARECROW and
SHORT ROOT are known to be necessary for QC formation [6-9]. The interplay of auxin and cytokinin controls
the size of the RAM, with the action of cytokinin implicated in controlling the exit of cells from the root meristem [10,11].
Several studies that characterise gene expression in the
cells of the root meristem have been published. Studies in
Arabidopsis have used green fluorescent protein-labelled

cell types and cell sorting to characterise gene expression
by microarray, for specific cell types and in different zones
of root development [12-14]. A root tissue specific gene
expression study has also been carried out in maize (Zea
mays) where the proximal meristem, QC and root cap
were microdissected and gene expression was measured
on Affymetrix rice genome arrays [15]. However the root
of model legume Medicago truncatula presents a notably
different system for study of root development to that of
Arabidopsis thaliana or maize. At a cellular level, the root of
M. truncatula has a significantly different RAM to that of
Arabidopsis. Most legume roots, unlike the Arabidopsis root
have a basic-open root meristem [16]. The difference
between open and closed meristems is significant; in the
open RAM, initials are not apparent indicating possible
variations in the regulation cell division and differentiation between the two types of RAM. Hamamoto et al. [17]
have shown that roots with an open meristem produce
individual living border cells and more border cells than
those with a closed meristem. Border cells are important
for mycorrhizal and microbial interactions including the
legume-rhizobia symbiosis [18] and environmental sensing.
In terms of root organogenesis, the most obvious difference between M. truncatula and other model plants and is
the ability of M. truncatula to form indeterminate root
nodules in association with rhizobia. Nodulation shares
several aspects of lateral root organogenesis with the
advantage that it is inducible and the site of organogenesis
is predictable. Root organogenesis is also inducible in M.
truncatula in tissue culture with the addition of auxin 1naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) to the tissue culture media.
Root formation in culture is irreversible after 7 days on
NAA [19] and does not require ethylene perception [20].
Thus, the morphological differences between the M. truncatula root and that of other model species and interest in
the species as a model for root and nodule development
led us to conduct the research we present here.

Results and discussion
The M. truncatula root meristem
The M. truncatula RAM shows a characteristic basic open
root meristem organisation (Figure 1). In the region
where cells are dividing, it isn't possible to distinguish the
initials amongst the tightly packed mass of new and elongating cells in the root tip. Our meristem section, 3 millimetres from the root tip, is comprised large group of
undifferentiated cells, surrounded by some differentiated
tissues including border cells, root cap and elongating
cells that will form the vascular bundle, pericycle, endodermis, cortex and epidermis. Our non-meristematic section, one centimetre adjacent to the meristem, only
contains the characteristic root tissue layers; root hairs
occur in this region, rhizobial infection and lateral root

The Medicago root meristem

cap; scale bar = 50 µm.

initiation occur in this zone. These sections were chosen
to correspond with earlier proteomic work on the Medicago root meristem [21] and because there are no
described markers for specific cell types in the Medicago
root meristem that could be used to create transgenic
plants for a cell-type analysis.

To characterise the transcriptomes of the meristematic
and non-meristematic root of the M. truncatula we
extracted RNA from the meristem and non-meristematic
zones from the roots of three independently grown sets of
plants four days after germination. The three biological
replicates were analysed using the Affymetrix Medicago
genome array. An average of 51% (26,9610 probe sets) of
the over 52, 000 plant gene probes of the Medicago
Genome Array GeneChip produced 'present' calls when
hybridised with biotin-labelled cRNA from M. truncatula
roots consistent with early reports [22]. Following normalisation with GCRMA, we identified 324 transcripts
that are greater that 2.0 fold over-expressed in the meristem and 363 that are over-expressed in the non-meristem.
The full data set has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database as accession GSE8115; the normalised data set is available in additional file 1.
Although our meristem sample is comprised of multiple
cells types, including stem cells, elongating and differentiating cells and some differentiated cell types, proteome
and transcriptome data suggests that the material contains
a significant proportion of stem cells. Previously we have
shown with proteomic analysis that the root meristem
accumulates significantly more actin and tubulin than
non-meristematic tissues, consistent with cell proliferation in the meristem [21]. The array data also shows that
the transcript of the ortholog of the M. sativa cyclin A2,
Medsa;cycA2;2 (Mtr.44839.1.S1_at) is expressed greater
than 2 fold in our meristematic root section. Cyclin A2 is
important in the transition to DNA synthesis and replication phases of the cell cycle and is destroyed as the cell
moves into mitosis, in M. sativa Medsa;cycA2;2 2 is
restricted to proliferating cells designated to meristem formation during developmental programs; and expression
of the gene is directly activated by auxin [23,24]. Presence
of the cyclin A2 transcript at a high level therefore serves
as a good indicator of stem cell activity in our root meristem section.

Array verification
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm the
level of expression of 10 transcripts from the array, see
Table 1. The transcripts analysed were chosen based on a
demonstrated or predicted role of orthologous genes in
plant stem cells, or due to general interest; the functional
significance of the transcripts validated by qRT-PCR is discussed in more detail below.

For all probe sets, the expression ratios displayed the same
pattern of expression as the array data. Low abundance
transcripts that were not differentially expressed at 2.0
fold (Mtr.32712.1.S1_at and Mtr.20966.1.S1_at) were
also shown to be significantly expressed by qRT-PCR.
Although the qRT-PCR and microarray expression ratios
were numerically different with qRT-PCR showing larger
fold changes in transcript expression, the data sets were
correlated with a Pearson correlation co-efficient of 0.704
(n = 10). Experimental reasons for these differences have
been reviewed by Morey et al [25]. These results help to
confirm the general accuracy of the microarray data we
present here.
Functional classification of differentially expressed probe
sets
The Medicago genome array does not incorporate the
entire M. truncatula genome, it was created based on an
incomplete genome sequence and a ESTs from the Medicago truncatula Gene Index (MtGI). Over the course of the
experiment we have noted the inclusion of probe sets for
International Medicago Genome Annotation Group
(IMGAG) gene predictions and the corresponding EST
leading to a duplication of data, and the absence of some
consensus ESTs from MtGI available at the time the chip
was made (data not shown). Annotation of the probe sets
on the Genome array also varies widely in quality.

To interpret gene expression results, we used GeneBins to
assign a relationship the genes differentially expressed

transcripts on the Medicago genome array to a hierarchical
functional classification modelled on KEGG ontology
[26,27]. This analysis showed that the metabolism of the
root meristem and non-meristem varies significantly
between the two sections, see Figure 2. About 28% percent
of differentially expressed probe sets could be assigned a
functional classification with GeneBins; of note 7% and
3.3% of transcripts differentially expressed are involved in
carbohydrate metabolism and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites respectively. 25.5% of differentially
expressed transcripts have no homolog, however by far
the largest class of probe sets that had significantly altered
expression in our analysis were unclassified with a
homolog. This result led us to use other bioinformatics
strategies to annotate the probe sets on the genome array.
To further refine the functional classification and annotation of metabolic probe sets on the Medicago genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/21

array we used PathExpress [28]. Using this database we
were able to identify statistically significant over-representation of metabolic pathways in the meristematic and
non-meristematic root, shown in Table 2. Four metabolic
pathways are significantly over-represented in the meristem and 10 are over-represented in the non-meristematic
root.
We also annotated the chip by comparing the data set
with the Arabidopsis Gene Family Information database
maintained by the Arabidopsis Information Resource
[29]. As of April 2007 the database contained 996 gene
families and 8,331 genes. Using BLAST, we were able to
classify 3159 Medicago probe sets into these families.
Sixty-nine and 71 of the differentially expressed probe sets
from the meristem and non-meristem respectively were
classified in the gene families; no families were significantly over-represented in either section (additional file

2). Finally, transcription factors (TF) on the Genome array
were predicted by homology relationship based on the
Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors (DATF)
[30]. This analysis showed that 2932 probe sets on the
Genome array have sequence homology to described
plant TFs (additional file 3).
Carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis
The most notable metabolic difference between the meristem and non-meristematic root is carbon metabolism,
carbon is fixed in the non-meristematic root and sugars
are metabolised in the meristem. PathExpress shows that
transcripts of enzymes from the pathway of carbon
metabolism are significantly over-expressed in the nonmeristematic root; they include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (Mtr.22603.1.S1_at,
Mtr.52116.1.S1_at, Mtr.47901.1.S1_x_at), fructose 1,6diphosphate phosphatase (Mtr.37533.1.S1_at), sedoheptulose 1,7-diphosphatase (Mtr.40432.1.S1_at), RuBisCO
small subunit (Mtr.12203.1.S1_at, Mtr.19517.1.S1_at,
Mtr.12202.1.S1_at, Mtr.19516.1.S1_at), 5-phosphoribulose kinase (Mtr.10464.1.S1_at) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Mtr.8683.1.S1_at). PathExpress analysis
also shows that transcripts of sugar metabolism enzymes
are over-expressed in the meristem, they include ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (Mtr.22751.1.S1_at), cellulose
1,4-beta-cellobiosidase (Mtr.45092.1.S1_at), beta-glucosidase (Mtr.35316.1.S1_at), cellulose synthase (UDPforming) (Mtr.5728.1.S1_at, Mtr.35544.1.S1_at), polygalacturonase (Mtr.45925.1.S1_s_at, Mtr.18904.1.S1_at),
pectinesterase (Mtr.28556.1.S1_at, Mtr.4467.1.S1_at),
glucan endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase (Mtr.18873.1.S1_at,
Mtr.44762.1.S1_s_at,
Mtr.13666.1.S1_at,

Mtr.44304.1.S1_at), diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate
diphosphatase (Mtr.43946.1.S1_at).
Beyond basic cellular energy needs, at least two processes
in the root meristem have significant energy requirements. Gravitropism requires the accumulation of starch
in the root cap, a component of our root meristem sample, in organelles known as statocytes. Arabidopsis plants
that lack or have reduced accumulation of starch in the
root have reduced response to gravity [31]; gravity signalling by statocytes and other signal transduction pathways
leads the redistribution of auxin in the root cap in
response to gravity [32]. Another sink for sugar metabolised in the meristem is cell wall biosynthesis and modification, for a recent review of the biosynthesis of plant cell
wall polysaccharides see Lerouxel et al. [33]. PathExpress
analysis shows that enzymes implicated in the biosynthesis of stilbene, coumarine and lignin are significantly
over-represented in both root sections; however in both
instances the enzymes implicated are multiple isoforms of
heme peroxidase, cytochrome P450 containing monooxygenases and beta-glucosidase. These enzymes contain
common catalytic domains and could be involved in
numerous cellular processes where reactive oxygen species
are generated and detoxified, such as ascorbate and aldarate metabolism and pentose and glucuronate interconversions where they also are over-represented in the nonmeristematic root in the PathExpress classification. More
specifically related to cell wall biosynthesis cellulose synthase is up-regulated in the meristematic root. Cell wall
plasticity is also required in dividing and elongating cells
[34,35], we also find transcripts of cell wall modifying
pectinesterases, polygalacturonases and expansins

(Mtr.20976.1.S1_at,
Mtr.22752.1.S1_s_at,
Mtr.47780.1.S1_at, Mtr.9830.1.S1_at) are significantly
more abundant in the meristematic root.
Neither RAM, nor SAM are photosynthetic, thus their status and carbohydrate sinks is notable. Pien et al [36] have
linked carbohydrate metabolism with the earliest phase of
commitment by meristem cells to form a leaf. They
showed that meristem cells express ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase transcripts and accumulate starch with an
increased frequency in the region of cells forming the leaf
primordium. Based on their data they also propose that
sugars may regulate the expression of genes within the
meristem which encode enzymes that can function to
influence sugar metabolism. Our meristem transcript data
shows that expression of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase
over 2 fold and sucrose synthase over 1.5 fold. Data from
gus-sucrose synthase reporter in M. truncatula demonstrates the expression of sucrose synthase in the root and
nodule meristems and in cells activated to divide through
association with rhizobia and endomycorrhiza [37]. The
role of sugar in the modification of gene expression and
its relationship with auxin in the RAM may be worthy of
further investigation.
Flavonoids
Flavonoids are important for some aspects of root and
nodule development in M. truncatula, the analysis of an
RNAi-knockdown of chalcone synthase, the enzyme that
catalyzes the first committed step of the flavonoid pathway, showed that the plant can maintain active root and
lateral root meristems in the absence of endogenous flavonoids but cannot initiate nodules [38]. This work also
showed that flavonoid-deficient roots have an increased
rate of polar auxin transport (PAT) and implicated flavonoids as a regulator of auxin transport, consistent with
their reported role as endogenous auxin transport inhibitors [39,40].

Our data suggests a role for flavonoids and their derivatives in the non-meristematic root, where PathExpress
shows that the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway is significantly
over-represented.
Isoflavone
reductase
(Mtr.24228.1.S1_at) is greater than 2.0 fold overexpressed in the non-meristematic root, where lateral
roots are formed and symbiosis may be established with
rhizobia; we have also shown the significant accumulation of this protein in the non-meristem [21]. Isoflavones
have been shown to inhibit root formation in vitro in M.
truncatula [19], their production is induced during nitrogen deficiency [41], and they are required for the establishment of symbiosis with rhizobia [42]. Flavonoid 3', 5'hydroxylase (Mtr.44207.1.S1_at) and dihydrokaempferol
4-reductase (Mtr.31382.1.S1_at) both contribute to the
production of anthocyanins and are also highly expressed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/21

in the non-meristematic root. Analysis of the
anthocyanninless2 mutant of Arabidopsis implicates the tissue-specific accumulation of anthocyanins in sub epidermal tissues of the root in the maintenance of root
organisation [43]. The relationship between anthocyanin
deposition and polar auxin transport in the root has not
been tested.
Hormones and cell to cell communication
In our analysis of plant gene families we could identify
probe sets that indicated that there are significant differences in cell to cell communication and response to hormones in the meristem and non-meristematic root. Auxin
transport in the RAM is by a system of auxin efflux carrier
proteins from the PIN family, has been well described in
M. truncatula [44]. PIN proteins are localised in an asymmetric distribution on either the basal or apical side of
cells where they control PAT [45], their expression and
reorganisation is also essential for creating localised auxin
gradients which are required for many aspects of plant
development. In the M. truncatula root, MtPIN2 is
expressed in the root, our data also showed the expression
of this gene (Mtr.45124.1.S1_at), specifically up-regulated
in the root meristem, consistent with the reported localisation of the AtPIN2 protein, where its localisation directs
auxin flow from the root tip into the elongation zone and
is crucial in mediating the gravitropic response [46]. Our
array data, confirmed by qRT-PCR, also shows that
MtPIN9 (Mtr.49764.1.S1_at) is preferentially expressed in
the non-meristematic root. Multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein-type ABC transporters also function as auxin
efflux carriers, our data shows the over-expression of three
homologous
transcripts
(Mtr.23681.1.S1_x_at,
Mtr.23679.1.S1_x_at, Mtr.43342.1.S1_at) in the nonmeristem with strong C-terminal protein sequence similarity with Arabidopsis Multidrug Resistance-Like1 (MDR1)
and MDR4, two transporters recently shown to mediate
acropetal and basipetal auxin transport proximal to the
meristem respectively [47].

Cytokinin also contributes to the establishment and
maintenance of the RAM, and recently it has been shown
that cytokinin controls the rate of meristematic cell differentiation determining the size of the RAM through a twocomponent receptor histidine kinase-transcription factor
signalling pathway [48]. In the RAM cytokinin is detected
by ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE 3, which leads to
the expression of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR
transcription factors. In our root meristem section we
were able to detect the accumulation of a probe set orthologous to ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE 5
(Mtr.30157.1.S1_at); AHK5 has been shown to be
expressed in the elongating root where it acts as a negative
regulator in the signaling pathway in which ethylene and

abscisic acid inhibit root elongation through ethylene
receptor ETR1 [49].
Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) have been implicated in
numerous developmental signalling pathways in plant
development. We see significant differential expression of
three RLKs in the meristem (Mtr.5784.1.S1_at,
Mtr.1137.1.S1_s_at, Mtr.413.1.S1_at) and one in the nonmeristem (Mtr.50901.1.S1_at). Mtr.1137.1.S1_s_at is an
ortholog of CLAVATA1, the leucine-rich RLK responsible
for specification of the SAM through interaction with the
CLAVATA3 peptide. A CLAVATA-like pathway has been
implicated in RAM maintenance, root specific RLKs have
been identified in Arabidopsis with the peptide
CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED 19 (CLE19) a possible ligand,
but due to redundancy within this large family of kinases
the pathway has not yet been fully described [50,51].
In the microarray data we identified several putative peptide hormone transcript highly expressed in the root meristem. The probe set (Mtr.16722.1.S1_at), expression
confirmed by qRT-PCR (Table 1) has strong protein
sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis gene DEVIL 19, a
member of the DVL gene family. Some DVL peptides have
been in shown to inhibit cell proliferation during leaf
development [52,53], their receptor is unknown. We also
find transcripts homologous to Rapid Alkalization Factors
(RALF)
expressed
highly
in
the
meristem
(Mtr.18300.1.S1_at and Mtr.35639.1.S1_s_at); RALFs

have been shown to act as peptide hormones in tobacco
and Arabidopsis [54]. These peptides may have a role in M.
truncatula meristem maintenance.
Transcription factors
Of the 2,957 probe sets on the genome array have
sequence homology to described plant TFs, 37 predicted
TFs were up-regulated in meristem and 18 TFs were upregulated at least 2 fold in non-meristematic cells (Additional file 3). Of the 64 predicted TF families in the DATF
database, only 21 were differentially expressed in meristem and non-meristematic root (Table 3). Of these, nine
families were significantly over-represented (p ≤ 0.05)
within the up-regulated probe sets, no TF families were
over-represented in the non-meristem. The families upregulated in the meristem are the basic/helix-loop-helix
(bHLH), basic leucine zipper (bZIP), growth regulating
factor (GRF) and the GRF-interacting factors (GIF),
APETALA2 and ethylene-responsive element binding proteins (AP2/EREBP), auxin-responsive protein/indoleacetic acid-induced protein (AUX/IAA), GATA factors (C2C2GATA), auxin-response factors (ARF) and plant AT-rich
sequence- and zinc-binding proteins (PLATZ). With the
exception of bHLH, bZIP and C2C2-GATA domain containing TFs, the significantly up-regulated TF gene families
are plant specific. We confirmed the expression of several
TFs that significantly accumulate in the meristem using
qRT-PCR (Table 1).

FiveAP2/EREPB domain containing TFs expressed in the
meristematic root, including BABY BOOM1 (BBM)
(Mtr.21627.1.S1_at) and two with described Arabidopsis
orthologs. Mtr.23155.1.S1_at is an ortholog to
PLETHORA1 and Mtr.45360.1.S1_at is an ortholog of Arabidopsis ANTIGUMENTA-LIKE 5. Tandem AP2 domain
transcription factors are strongly associated with plant
development, and PLETHORA and BABY BOOM with
root development where they have recently been shown
to be dose-dependent regulators of root stem cell identity
and maintenance [55]. The accumulation of these transcripts in the Medicago root meristem and absence of
expression in the differentiated root is consistent with
these findings.
Auxin is key regulator of plant gene expression and the
AUX/IAA and ARF TFs are important regulators of auxin
response. AUX/IAA TFs repress the expression of auxin
activated genes until they are degraded by the SCFTIR1 E3
ubiquitin ligase complex in the presence of IAA. ARFs can
activate or repress transcription in the presence of auxin
by binding to auxin-response elements. Two AUX/IAA
transcripts are highly expressed in the meristem,
Mtr.22904.1.S1.at and Mtr.16803.1.S1.at that are orthologous to Arabidopsis IAA33 and IAA30 respectively; neither has a described functional role in roots, but IAA30 is
expressed in the root QC and during embryo maturation
[12,56]. Two ARFs are highly expressed in RAM of M. truncatula, Mtr.13650.1.S1_at and Mtr.39233.S1_at share similarity with the open reading frames of Arabidopsis ARF8
and ARF10 respectively. In Arabidopsis ARF 8 has been
shown to be involved in controlling the level of free IAA
via a negative feedback loop by regulating the expression
of IAA conjugating GH3 enzymes [57]. ARF10 has been
shown to restrict the size of the stem cell niche in the distil
root causing the differentiation of root cap cells, it is regulated by both IAA and miR160 [58].
Transcription factors with no similarity to those with a
described role in meristems were also screened including
two basic helix-loop-helix domain containing genes
(Mtr.49495.1.S1_at, Mtr.24270.1.S1_s_at), a PLATZ
domain (Mtr.46508.1.S1_at) and AT HOOK domain
(Mtr.20966.1.S1_at) TFs; PLATZ and AT HOOK containing TFs have not previously been shown to be expressed in
plant stem cells. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that all
these TFs accumulate significantly in the meristem (Table
1).
Although no TF families are significantly over-represented
in the non-meristem, it is of interest that two GRAS
domain TFs are significantly expressed in this section. Several GRAS domain containing TFs are known to have roles
in the root, the best characterized are the Arabidopsis GRAS
genes SCARECROW (SCR) which in combination with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/21

SHORT ROOT are required for the specification of the QC
and endodermis [59], two GRAS domain containing TFs
have also been shown to be required for the establishment
of nodulation in Lotus japonicus [60]. Our analysis showed
the accumulation of GRAS transcript (Mtr.1484.1.S1_at)
in the non-meristem. It is an ortholog of Arabidopsis gene
LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LAS); LAS has been show to suppress the formation of auxiliary meristems in Arabidopsis
shoots, the mRNA was shown to also accumulate in roots
but the effect of the mutation on lateral root development
was not described [61]. It may have a role in inhibition of
lateral root initiation.

Conclusion
We have described differences between the root meristem
and non-meristematic transcriptomes. Notably they
include significant variations in carbon and flavonoid
metabolism, auxin and cytokinin signalling, cell to cell
communication and gene regulation. This data will facilitate the mapping of regulatory and metabolic networks
involved in root meristem establishment and maintenance, and may lead to a better understanding of root
stem cells in M. truncatula and other species with open
meristem organisation where different mechanisms must
operate to control meristem size and cell fate than those
that operate in Arabidopsis.

Methods
Plant material
Seeds of M. truncatula accession A17 were scarified, surface-sterilised with 6% hypochlorite solution and washed
7 times with sterile distilled water. Seeds were germinated
on nitrogen-free Fåhraeus medium on Petri plates in the
dark for 24 to 30 hours. To provide intact primary roots
for sectioning, germinated seeds that lacked any visible
signs of microbial contamination were transferred to new
Petri plates, 14 to 16 seedlings per plate, and grown for a
further 3 days in a growth chamber until the roots had
reached a length of 3 to 4 cm and before lateral roots
emerged. At least 150 plants were required per RNA
extraction.

Plates were kept vertically and the bottom half of each
plate was sealed with Nescofilm R. Light was kept from
the roots by the insertion of a black sheet between the
plates during incubation. An aluminium foil spacer was
placed under the lid of the Petri dish to allow gas
exchange. Plates were incubated in a growth chamber at
20°C over a 16 hour photoperiod and a photon flux density of 100 mmol m-2 s-1 and 86% relative humidity.
To compare meristematic and non-meristematic root tissues, root sections were harvested from 3 day old plants.
Tissue 3 mm from the root tip which contains meristematic cells and a further 1 cm section from the root contain-

ing non-meristematic cells were collected. All harvested
plant materials were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
For structural analysis, roots were fixed in phosphate
buffer and glutaraldehyde, taken through an ethanol
dehydration series then embedded in araldite [62]. Sections 1.5 µM thick were cut using a Leica Ultracut, stained
with toluidine blue and viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop.
RNA isolation, hybridization and data pre-processing
Total RNA was extracted and purified from plant tissues
using the Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer; RNA with an
absorbance A260/A280ratio > 2.0 was quality tested using
the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the
Test3 arrays and Medicago GeneChip® were performed
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) (at the Biomolecular Resource
Facility, JCSMR, ANU). Briefly, double-stranded cDNA
was synthesized from 5 to 8 µg of each RNA sample via
oligo T7-(dT)24 primer-mediated reverse transcription.
Biotin-labelled cRNA was generated using the Enzo BioArray kit (Affymetrix), purified using RNeasy spin columns
(Qiagen), and then quantified by spectrophotometer. Fifteen to 20 µg of each biotin-labelled fragmented cRNA
sample was used to prepare 300 µL of hybridization mixture. Aliquots of each sample (100 µL) were hybridized
onto Test3 arrays to check the quality of the samples prior
to hybridization (200 µL) onto the Medicago genome
arrays. The arrays were washed with optimized wash protocols, stained with strepdavidin/phycoerythrin followed
by antibody amplification, and scanned with the Agilent
GeneArray Scanner (Affymetrix).
To remove certain systematic biases from the microarray,
the raw Affymetrix data (.cel files) were normalized with
the GCRMA (GC content – Robust Multi-Array Average)
algorithm (ver. 2.2.0) including quantile normalization
and variance stabilisation [63], using the affy package of
the bioconductor software [64]. The normalized average
of the replicates was then log transformed in base 2 to
reduce the proportional relationship between random
error and signal intensity. Differentially expressed probe
sets were identified by evaluating the log2 ratio between
the two conditions associated to a standard t-test [65]. All
probe sets that differed by more than a two-fold difference
with a t-test p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be differentially
expressed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/21

Genome array data analysis
Functional categories significantly associated (p ≤ 0.05,
adjusted using the Bonferroni correction) with the upand down-regulated sequences were identified using
GeneBins, a database that provides a hierarchical functional classification modelled on the KEGG ontology [66]
of probe set sequences represented on Affymetrix arrays
[67]. We used PathExpress [68], a web-based tool based
on the KEGG Ligand database [69], to detect whether
probe sets associated with a metabolic pathway or subpathway were statistically over-represented in the differentially expressed sets of sequences (p ≤ 0.05).

In addition, probe sets of the Affymetrix Medicago genome
array were assigned to gene families described in the TAIR
database (Rhee et al., 2003) and to transcription factor
families provided by the Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors [30] based on their sequence similarity
with Arabidopsis thaliana proteins. BLASTXx [70] was used
to find the best match (E ≤ 10-8) for the sequences representing each probe set (i.e. sequences derived from the
most 5' to the most 3' probe in the public UniGene cluster). The differentially expressed sets of sequences were
compared to the composition of each gene family to identify if a certain category was statistically over-represented.
For each test, a P-value, representing the probability that
the intersection of the list of up- or down-regulated probe
sets with the list of probe sets belonging to the given gene
family occurs by chance, was calculated using the hypergeometric distribution [71].
Sequences of interest were analysed using BLAST and multiple sequence alignments to identify genes and proteins
with sequence similarity from Arabidopsis. To identify
orthologs in Arabidopsis AffyTrees was used [72,73],
AffyTrees automatically detects sequence orthologs based
on phylogenetic trees.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from three biological repeats of
tissue harvested from M. truncatula as described above
using the Qiagen RNeasy MINI kit (Qiagen). The RNeasy
kit protocol was modified to incorporate a DNase treatment using the DNase spin columns (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript™ III reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 2 µg total RNA for each
sample using oligo (dT18) primers. For the no reverse
transcriptase control, water was added instead of SuperScript III. For the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), gene specific primers were
designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and ordered from Sigma
Genosys. The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 10
µL containing 0.3 µM of each primer, 1 × SYBR green PCR
master mix (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were ampli-

fied as follows: 95°C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C
for 15 sec, 60°C for 1.5 min. Amplifications were performed in 384-well clear optical reaction plates (Applied
Biosystems) with an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection
System (at the Biomolecular Resource Facility, JCSMR,
ANU) using version SDS 2.2.2 software (Applied Biosystems) to analyse raw data. The absence of genomic DNA
and non-specific by-products of the PCR amplification
was confirmed by analysis of dissociation curves and agarose gel electrophoresis using 3% agarose gels stained
with 0.5 µg mL-1 ethidium bromide. Normalisation was
done as described by Searle et al. [74]; against the
MtUBQ10 gene by calculating differences between the CT
of the target gene and the CT of Ubiquitin 10 and relative
gene expression levels were calculated.
The transcripts whose expression levels were verified by
quantitative RT-PCR were as follows:
