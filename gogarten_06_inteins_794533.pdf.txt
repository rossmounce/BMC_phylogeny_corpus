Abstract
Self splicing introns and inteins that rely on a homing endonuclease for propagation are parasitic
genetic elements. Their life-cycle and evolutionary fate has been described through the homing
cycle. According to this model the homing endonuclease is selected for function only during the
spreading phase of the parasite. This phase ends when the parasitic element is fixed in the
population. Upon fixation the homing endonuclease is no longer under selection, and its activity is
lost through random processes. Recent analyses of these parasitic elements with functional homing
endonucleases suggest that this model in its most simple form is not always applicable. Apparently,
functioning homing endonuclease can persist over long evolutionary times in populations and
species that are thought to be asexual or nearly asexual. Here we review these recent findings and
discuss their implications. Reasons for the long-term persistence of a functional homing
endonuclease include: More recombination (sexual and as a result of gene transfer) than previously
assumed for these organisms; complex population structures that prevent the element from being
fixed; a balance between active spreading of the homing endonuclease and a decrease in fitness
caused by the parasite in the host organism; or a function of the homing endonuclease that
increases the fitness of the host organism and results in purifying selection for the homing
endonuclease activity, even after fixation in a local population. In the future, more detailed studies
of the population dynamics of the activity and regulation of homing endonucleases are needed to
decide between these possibilities, and to determine their relative contributions to the long term
survival of parasitic genes within a population. Two outstanding publications on the amoeba
Naegleria group I intron (Wikmark et al. BMC Evol Biol 2006, 6:39) and the PRP8 inteins in
ascomycetes (Butler et al.BMC Evol Biol 2006, 6:42) provide important stepping stones towards
integrated studies on how these parasitic elements evolve through time together with, or despite,
their hosts.

In the organism centered view of evolution, the individual
is considered the unit of selection. By being fit, the individual's genes have a greater chance to become fixed in the
population. Challenging this view, Dawkins introduced a
gene centered view of evolution [1] where the individual

organism is just a vessel created by selfish genes. Cooperative genes rely on the individual's success – they increase
their frequency in the population through increasing the
fitness of the organism; in contrast, the perpetuation of
parasitic genes through generations is independent of the

host's fitness. The molecular parasites have gained their
own individuality, and to understand their evolution, one
has to consider their life cycle. Frequently, these parasitic
elements are labeled as selfish genes; however, according
to Dawkins [1] all genes are selfish, thus we prefer the
label "parasitic" to reflect the fact that these genes are not
cooperating to the benefit of the host organism.

the spread of these parasites in the population relies on
the different alleles being brought together through sex or
gene transfer; however, many mobile elements with HE
activity are found in organisms and organelles thought to
be nearly clonal (e.g., mitochondria and prokaryotes) or
relying on asexual genetic exchange, e.g., fungi [11] and
amoeba [12] without known sexual recombination.

Self splicing introns and inteins are remarkable examples
of parasitic elements [2-7]. These molecular parasites can
excise themselves of the host molecule (mRNA, rRNA or
tRNA for introns; protein for inteins) and ligate the ends
of the host molecule without perturbing its biological
function. Some of these molecular parasites are equipped
with homing endonucleases (HE) [8-10], which produce
a single double-strand cut in the genomic DNA, usually in
the intein- or intron-free allele of the infected gene. During DNA repair, the parasitic element is copied into the
previously empty allele. In sexual populations this invasion of uninfected alleles leads to super Mendelian inheritance of the molecular parasites. It is curious to note that

The fitness of the molecular parasite and the fitness of the
organismal host walk separate roads [8,13]. For the parasite, fitness is reflected in its ability to spread in the population. Because of its splicing activity the parasite does not
impact on the host protein function. The parasite actively
colonizes all individuals until the entire population contains the intron/intein. Selection acts upon the splicing
properties at all times, but for the HE activity selection
only operates during invasion. When the parasitic element is fixed in the population, the HE function decays
and is eventually lost. Goddard and Burt [13] first formulated the homing cycle (Fig. 1) for introns with HE activity; a modified model was applied to inteins [3,14].

structure the cycle might not operate in synchrony in different subpopulations. The red arrows indicate the trajectory of the
functioning HE and the black arrows the fate of the host gene. The precise loss can occur through recombination with an intein
or intron free allele, or, in case of introns, through recombination with a reverse transcript of the spliced mRNA [39, 40].

Conceptually, the homing cycle should be formulated for
interbreeding populations [3], i.e., the units in which the
parasitic genetic element can be fixed; however, often species, not populations, were considered as units in which
the HE containing element was fixed, and the presence of
a gene with active HE was interpreted as reflecting gene
exchange across species boundaries. These assumptions
were frequently confirmed by more detailed analysis of
species, host protein, and HE phylogenies [13-16]. The
presence of HE containing introns and inteins thus
becomes an indicator for DNA exchange events within or
across the species boundaries, for example, transfers
between mitochondrial genomes in plants and fungi [1316], or from eukaryotes to extreme thermophilic bacteria
[17].

Recently discovered limitations of the homing
cycle model
Several recent findings challenge the general applicability
of the homing cycle: in Naegleria, an apparently asexual
amoeba, an intron with HE was reported to be of ancient
origin, frequently lost in different lineages, but persisting
as a functional enzyme in others [18]. And in three different orders of euascomycetes (Pezizomycota) inteins were
discovered in the PRP8 gene [19], all inserted at the same
location within the gene. The PRP8 intein has been horizontally transferred between euascomycetes and the
basidiomycete Cryptococcus [19] but no evidence for transfer between the different lineages of euascomycetes was
detected. Some of the PRP8 inteins in euascomycetes contain a functional HE under purifying selection, as judged
by the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions [19]. According to a recent attempt to date fungal
evolution [20], the groups of euascomycetes that contain
a PRP8 intein already diverged in the Late Proterozoic
(i.e., before 540 million years BP). Could a functioning
HE survive within a species over several hundred million
years without interspecies transfer?
We discuss several possible explanations, not all complementary, for these findings:
(A) Sex and genetic exchange occur more frequently than
assumed. Rare events of genetic exchange that bring HE
containing alleles together with intron/intein free alleles
might be sufficient to maintain the HE under purifying
selection.
(B) The HE might have a function beneficial to the host.
In case of Bacillus phages, introns with HE were reported
to increase the fitness of their respective host by destroying the genomes of competing phages, containing a different HE, that co-infected the same host [21]. However,
selection at the gene and the population level are interwoven tightly in this case and an alternative explanation con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/94

sidering only the gene's selfishness and competition of
different HEs for target sites was proposed [22]. Many self
splicing introns encode maturases that assist in the splicing reaction catalyzed by the intron [23], and some of
these evolved from homing endonucleases [24]. Again
selection at the different levels is interwoven, the intron
now relies on the HE not only for spreading within the
population, it also requires the HE for splicing. Without
the maturase activity, the intron splices less effectively and
thus the absence of the maturase/HE is detrimental to the
host. The maturase is under purifying selection, as long as
the intron is present. This sequence of events illustrates a
neutral pathway to complexity [25]: The organism harboring the self-splicing intron is no better off than without
the intron, but it now requires a more complex machinery
to catalyze the splicing reaction, and the parts required for
splicing now are under purifying selection. However, as
long as the maturase/HE only acts on the encoding intron,
the homing cycle could continue with the simultaneous
deletion of the intron and the encoded maturase/HE. In
Saccharomyces cerevisiae an endonuclease that triggers
recombination events leading to mating type changes is a
homolog of the HE containing intein in the vacuolar
ATPase catalytic subunit [3,26,27]; and a genome rearrangement function was also suggested in Thermococcus
kodakaraensis [28]. The acquisition of a new function that
allowed the HE to exit from the homing cycle also
occurred in plants and in soft corals where a mitochondrial mutS homolog fused twice independently with different HE types [29].
(C) The homing endonuclease might be maintained by
balancing selection. Butler et al [19] suggested that the
intein might decrease the fitness of the host organism. The
long term survival of the functioning HE might result
from the active invasion due to conversion of intein free
alleles, balanced by the decreased propagation of the
infected hosts. This balance could be achieved without the
homing cycle operating in the population.
(D) The homing cycle might operate in subpopulations
only. A low homing frequency might be sufficient to provide purifying selection for the HE function, but insufficient to fix the parasite in the whole population
simultaneously. The process of fixation might be further
delayed by a complex population structure. Decay and
loss of the parasites' fitness already might occur in one
subpopulation, whereas other subpopulations might be
only at the beginning of the invasion phase. The resulting
situation is comparable to waves in an excitable medium
that run in circles, as in a fibrillating heart-muscle (reentry ventricular fibrillation[30,31]). In the spatial model
the homing cycle operates on smaller sections of the population; the population or the species as a whole would be

out of synchrony. Reinvasion therefore can occur from
within the species or population.
Hypothesis A is compatible with the other three scenarios,
and the presence of a HE containing parasitic gene already
suggests a low level of gene flow occurring in these presumably clonal organisms. It will be interesting to learn
how the homing process in these organisms begins – in
the best studied example, the vma-1 intein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [32-34], homing only occurs during meiosis
[35,36]. Hypothesis B might explain the persistence of a
class I intron, if the encoded HE had acquired a maturase
function [24] acting in trans on other self-splicing introns;
however, under this assumption it remains puzzling that
most Naegleria isolates lost the intron. The same argument
applies to the PRP8 intein: The acquisition of a new function is at odds with the presence of several PRP8 genes in
euascomycetes that lost either the HE domain or the
whole intein altogether. If the HE acquired a function
beneficial to the host, why was it lost repeatedly during
evolution?
Hypothesis C is unlikely to be a sufficient explanation on
its own. It would require an exact balance between forces
that increase and those that decrease the HE frequency. A
slight shift away from the equilibrium would mean either
fixation or extinction for the HE containing parasite.
However, an approximate balance between decreased fitness of the host and active spreading of the parasitic element, combined with a complex population structure
could lead to long persistence times without the homing
cycle operating, especially when the selective disadvantage to the carrier and the mobility of the element were
not the same in different subpopulations. This hypothesis
on the surface appears similar to hypothesis D; however,
in the absence of the homing cycle the empty target sites
would not result from decay and loss of the parasitic element, but from the faster growth rate of the organisms
that never possessed the element.
The asynchronous homing cycle (hypothesis D) is a likely
contributor to the long term persistence of functional HE
in a single species. To corroborate this hypothesis, and to
differentiate it from hypothesis C, more detailed population studies need to be performed, including sampling of
isolated subpopulations with limited migration between
them, and thorough sampling of well mixed isolated populations. In addition, a sampling of related species is also
necessary since the detection of interspecies transfers
depends on a sufficient sampling of taxa. At present it cannot be excluded that some interspecies transfer of the HE
went undetected.
The unexpected complexity in the life cycle of inteins
reported by Butler and colleagues reinforces the need for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/94

detailed epidemiological studies of HE containing parasitic genes. These studies should be combined with
attempts to better understand the biochemical and physiological regulation of the parasitic genes, with measurements of their effect on the fitness of their host, with
determination of the transmission efficiency of the parasite, and with phylogenetic analyses that might reveal the
frequency of HE loss form the parasitic gene. In case of
introns the study of the epidemiological dynamics can be
further complicated by several factors (see [37] for a recent
review): HE genes and self-splicing introns can be considered independent parasites and a HE can associate with
different introns that provide integration sites that are
selectively neutral; self-splicing introns are frequently
found in ribosomal RNA encoding genes that are present
in multiple copies per genome; in addition to using HEs,
introns can also be mobile through reverse splicing; and
the HE function might also assist the splicing reaction.
The epidemiological dynamics of the HE containing parasitic genes are complex, and the determination of the relevant parameters will require collaborative efforts by
molecular biologists, microbial ecologists, and epidemiologists. However, these studies will be worthwhile,
because they provide a chance to untangle the interactions
between the selective forces acting at the molecular and
the organismal levels, and they also will allow detection
of low rates of gene flow between populations and possibly between species. These studies thus will constitute
important steps towards a more detailed genome 'ecology'
[38].
