The Potential for pathogenicity was present in
the ancestor of the Ascomycete subphylum
Pezizomycotina

Abstract
Background: Previous studies in Ascomycetes have shown that the function of gene families of which the size is
considerably larger in extant pathogens than in non-pathogens could be related to pathogenicity traits. However,
by only comparing gene inventories in extant species, no insights can be gained into the evolutionary process that
gave rise to these larger family sizes in pathogens. Moreover, most studies which consider gene families in extant
species only tend to explain observed differences in gene family sizes by gains rather than by losses, hereby largely
underestimating the impact of gene loss during genome evolution.
Results: In our study we used a selection of recently published genomes of Ascomycetes to analyze how gene
family gains, duplications and losses have affected the origin of pathogenic traits. By analyzing the evolutionary
history of gene families we found that most gene families with an enlarged size in pathogens were present in an
ancestor common to both pathogens and non-pathogens. The majority of these families were selectively
maintained in pathogenic lineages, but disappeared in non-pathogens. Non-pathogen-specific losses largely
outnumbered pathogen-specific losses.
Conclusions: We conclude that most of the proteins for pathogenicity were already present in the ancestor of the
Ascomycete lineages we used in our study. Species that did not develop pathogenicity seemed to have reduced
their genetic complexity compared to their ancestors. We further show that expansion of gained or already
existing families in a species-specific way is important to fine-tune the specificities of the pathogenic host-fungus
interaction.

Background
The Ascomycetes form the largest phylum in the fungal
kingdom. They exhibit a broad range of life styles, ranging from saprophytes to both plant and animal (including human) pathogens. Mycosphaerella fijiensis, for
instance, is the causal agent of ‘Black Sigatoka’, one of
the most devastating diseases affecting banana and plantains worldwide [1], while the opportunistic pathogen
Aspergillus fumigatus is the cause of allergy in human
patients with atopic immune systems [2]. With the
increasing number of genomes of Ascomycetes being
available, the study of the evolutionary dynamics that
give rise to pathogenicity becomes amenable. The

phylogeny of the Ascomycetes and more specifically of
the Pezizomycotina is of particular interest in this respect
as some of the pathogens are more closely related to
their non-pathogenic counterparts than to other pathogens, emphasizing the importance of the environment in
acquiring the pathogenic phenotype [3,4].
Recent studies showed that at least for some protein
families the retention of duplicated genes is larger in
pathogens than in non-pathogens. The functions of such
gene families with a larger size in pathogens than in
non-pathogens are in line with the pathogenic phenotype. Authors agreed that the presence of pathogenspecific families or the specific increase in gene family
size in pathogens created novel gene inventories that
can be associated with phenotypic trait acquisitions
[3,4]. However, by only comparing gene inventories in
the extant species, the evolutionary process that gave

rise to the observed enlarged family sizes in pathogens
remains unknown. Moreover, most studies which consider gene families at the level of the extant species only
tend to explain observed differences in gene family sizes
by gains rather than by losses. As a result, the impact of
gene loss during genome evolution is usually
underestimated.
In this study we evaluated how both gains and losses
affect the origin of phenotypic traits that resulted in
pathogenicity in Ascomycetes. To this end, we focused
on non-pathogenic and plant pathogenic Pezizomycotina. We reconstructed the ancestral states of extant
gene families and studied their evolution in relation to
their involvement in the phytopathogenic phenotype.

Results
The phylogenetic relationship between the species used
in our analysis is depicted in Figure 1. This tree, derived
from a subset of Ascomycete species, shows that not all
pathogens cluster together in the species tree. The
topology in which some of the pathogens are more closely related to non-pathogenic counterparts is of particular interest to uncover the evolutionary mechanisms
that resulted in differential phenotypic trait acquisition
(e.g. pathogenicity) and allows to find out which traits

Page 2 of 16

are common between evolutionary distant pathogens,
whether such common traits have been acquired in each
of the pathogens independently (convergent evolution)
or whether they have a common origin.
Gene family size in extant species

For each gene family, a phylogenetic profile was constructed that indicates per species the number of genes
belonging to the family. Transforming these profiles
allowed extracting those families for which one or more
species contained a considerably larger number of genes
than observed on average for that family in the remainder of the species; i.e. families that were selectively larger in a certain species or species set (see Methods).
Subsequent clustering of these families according to the
mutual similarity of their normalized profiles identified
clusters of families that all displayed a higher than average copy number in the same set of species. Results of
this clustering are displayed in Figure 2: some clusters
represent families with a copy number that is larger
than the family-average in one species only, while other
clusters correspond to families that show a copy number
that is higher than the average in several species. The
latter ones can be further subdivided in gene families
with a larger size in species that form a monophyletic

correction, all nodes 100% BS-supported). Branch lengths are drawn to scale. Branches of the tree corresponding to pathogenic species are
shaded in yellow while those corresponding to non-pathogenic species are shaded in green. At each time point (grey circles), the number of
gains and losses is indicated as inferred by DOLLOP (black) and CAFE (red). Expansions and contractions of already existing gene families inferred
by CAFE are not indicated as these cannot be inferred by DOLLOP.

clade and those with a larger size in species that do not
form a monophyletic clade. Of the 12,530 analyzed gene
families, 1066 showed a copy number higher than the
average exclusively in non-pathogenic species, while
1528 families had a larger size only in the pathogens.
The function of these gene families that showed a copy
number that is higher than the family-average in a subset of the species (according to GO and a comprehensive compilation of experimental data (Table 1)) was
related to the phenotype of the species in which the larger family size was observed.
For most gene families, the sizes are selectively larger
than the family-average in one of the sampled species
only: this was the case for 953 (89.40%) of the 1066
families that were selectively larger in non-pathogens,
and for 1411 of 1528 (92.34%) the families that were
selectively larger in pathogens. For the non-pathogens it
is mainly in the genome of A. oryzae that many families
show a higher than family-average gene copy number
(443). Those families are enriched in acid-ammonia
ligase activity, required for the biosynthesis of essential
amino acids and X-Pro dipeptidyl-peptidase activity.
The latter activity is in line with the ability of A. oryzae
to secrete proteolytic enzymes to the environment [5].
For the pathogens, it is mainly F. graminearum, M.
fijiensis and M. graminicola that show several families
with lineage-specific larger sizes in remarkably similar
functions (distinct families, but all related to transmembrane transport (clusters I-III, Figure 2B)).
For gene families that exhibited a higher than average
copy number in several species simultaneously, no
families were found with a larger size in all four nonpathogens. Clusters XI, XII and XIII in Figure 2A are
examples of families (nine in total) with a larger size in
three of the four non-pathogens. Among the pathogenic
species we found three protein families with a higher
than the family-average gene copy number in all four
pathogens (cluster XV, Figure 2B). These three protein
families are involved in mannosidase activity, which is
responsible for oligosaccharide catabolism and N-glycan
processing. Where mannosidase activity is not essential
for morphogenesis and cellular function in the nonpathogen A. nidulans, deleting the activity caused severe
defect in conidial formation in the human pathogen
Aspergillus fumigatus [6].
Clusters X-XIV in Figure 2B consist of 45 families
with a larger size in three out of the four pathogens.
Functional categories enriched in these protein families
included peptidase, G-protein receptor, transferase and
chitin binding activities, all of which have been related
to pathogenicity in Ascomycetes [7].
We found a larger number of protein families with
larger sizes in only two genomes (104 for the nonpathogens, 69 for the pathogens). For the largest subset

Page 4 of 16

of those families, gene families exhibited a larger size in
two species that form a monophyletic clade: from the
104 families, 64 had a larger size in both related Aspergillus species (cluster X of Figure 2A). Also for 37 of the
69 families in pathogenic species, the higher copy number was consistently shared by both closely related
Mycosphaerella species. Gene families with a larger size
in two species that do not belong to a monophyletic
clade in the species tree are cluster VI in Figure 2A consisting of 17 protein families enriched in nuclease and
fatty-acid synthase activities that show a higher copy
number in the genomes of the two non-related nonpathogens T. reesei and A. oryzae and cluster VI of
Figure 2B consisting of 16 protein families enriched in
N-acetyltransferase, oxidoreductase and tartrate dehydrogenase activities showing increased copy numbers in
the non-related pathogenic genomes of F. graminearum
and M. graminicola.
Evolution of gene family size

Phylogenetic profiling confirms what was also noted in
previous studies, namely that the functionality of protein
families with a larger gene copy number in extant
pathogens is linked to pathogenicity. The analysis of the
phylogenetic profiles, however, does not indicate how
these families ended up being extended in the extant
pathogens. For instance, the families with a larger copy
number in multiple species that do not form a monophyletic clade can either originate through independent
duplication events in non-related species (convergent
evolution) or by duplications in an ancestral species followed by gene loss in some of the descendants. To
understand the evolutionary dynamics of these common
and specific traits that can be linked to pathogenicity,
we applied a suite of complementary analyses. First, we
used DOLLOP [8] which maps for each gene family the
evolutionary history of gene gains and losses. By reconciling the binary profiles of gene families with the species tree, DOLLOP infers the minimal gene set for the
different ancestral nodes using a parsimony approach
which assumes gene loss to be irreversible [9]. DOLLOP
thus finds for every internal node in the tree whether
the species derived from that node gained or lost a specific protein family (Figure 1). However, as DOLLOP
uses binarized phylogenetic profiles that indicate
whether a certain species contains a representative of a
family, it does not contain information on the size of
the protein family in each species.
CAFE [10] on the other hand makes also use of the
number of genes in each family to model the evolution
of gene families. In doing so, CAFE not only reports on
gains and losses, but it also estimates the most likely
number of genes for each family at each of the ancestral
nodes of the species tree. From these results the

Only families for which the evolutionary history was consistently reconstructed by DOLLOP and CAFE are displayed. Description: GO description of the families.
Clustering: indicates whether an above the family-average gene copy number was observed in at least one species according to the cluster analysis. Evolutionary
events in non-pathogens were not categorized. Family size contractions due to gene loss events that do not imply the entire loss of the gene family were not
included in the table but covered in the ‘Dating gene duplication and loss events’ section. Evolutionary events: ‘gains’ and ‘losses’ as inferred by DOLOP and
CAFE; ‘significant expansion as inferred by CAFE; ‘enlarged gene family size’ as inferred by clustering i.e. size of the family in the indicated species is larger than
the family average. An ‘X’ indicates whether the event occurred in an ancestral node or in an extant species. Class: Gene families were classified according to the
evolutionary event that explains their origin. The four classes (C1-C4) correspond to those shown in Figure 3 and described in the main text.
Remark 1: Non-pathogen-specific gains were never observed.
Remark 2: Although theoretically CAFE should be able to discover significant expansions or contractions of gene families in ancestral species, these were never
observed. All cases of significant expansions and contractions were observed in the extant species.
Remark 3: Note that the class distinction was made based on the gene content of the families and not based on their functional annotation. This explains why
families belonging to the same GO category can belong to different classes (e.g. some astacin families that were present ancestrally got lost in a non-pathogenspecific way: those belong to C3. Other astacin related families were selectively gained in some pathogens. Those belong to C1.

occurrence of expansions and contractions of gene
families along the time points in the species tree can be
derived. CAFE infers an expansion at a given node if the
number of genes in a gene family augmented compared
to its number in a previous ancestral time point. A gain
of a gene family can be considered as a particular case
of an expansion for which the gene family was not present in the previous ancestral time point. Similarly, a

contraction is a reduction in the number of genes in a
gene family compared its number in the previous ancestral time point. Gene family loss is again a particular
case of a contraction for which an ancestral gene family
completely disappears in a descendant species.
The species tree, with for each node an indication on
the global number of gained and lost gene families, as
derived from DOLLOP and CAFE, is depicted in Figure

Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:318

1 (expansions and contractions of already existing protein families identified by CAFE were omitted in the
comparison as these events cannot be inferred by DOLLOP). To gain insights into the molecular functions
and/or biological processes of the gene families that
have been lost or gained or were expanded or contracted at each of the different time points, we analyzed
the GO functional categories for which the families
were enriched. The complete results of DOLLOP and
CAFE, i.e. a list of the evolutionary events for each of
the time points (TPs) in the species tree can be found
on the supporting information (Additional files 1 and 2).
Protein families for which both DOLLOP and CAFE
were consistent in inferring the same evolutionary history are displayed in Table 1.
General observations

In Figure 1, TP15 represents the last common ancestor of the eight species under consideration. Small
discrepancies in absolute numbers between DOLLOP
and CAFE result from the different underlying
assumptions between both methods, but in general
both methods predict similar tendencies. Since the
origin of the ancestral species on TP7 and TP14, gene
families seem to have been continuously lost and this
loss does not seem to have been compensated for by
gene family gains (both confirmed by DOLLOP and
CAFE).
When considering the species derived from TP7 (first
group of species in the upper part of the tree), gene loss
was significantly higher in the non-pathogens than in
the pathogens (TP2 and TP4 versus TP1 and TP5). For
the second group of species (descending from TP14),
this tendency might be masked by the unusually large
genome size that seems to have been maintained in the
cultivated species A. oryzae [5], resulting in gene loss
being at least as prominent in the pathogenic Mycosphaerella species than in the non-pathogenic Aspergillus species (TP10 versus TP13).
In the following, we give a detailed analysis of the evolutionary events that resulted in the currently observed
gene copy numbers in extant pathogens.
Pathogen-specific gene family gains (Class 1)

With a pathogen-specific gain we refer to a gene family
not present in a species that is ancestral to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic lineages (TP15), but that
appears in one of the extant pathogens (extant in
Table 1) or in an ancestral node that gives exclusively
rise to pathogenic lineages (such as for both Mycosphaerella species) (Figure 3A). Note that the term ‘specific’ used in the context of this paper should be
interpreted as specific relative to the number of species
analyzed in this study.

Page 8 of 16

We found several examples of families that were selectively present in a pathogen or in set of pathogens that
originated through this mechanism of family gain and of
which the function can be related to pathogenicity.
Examples of families that are gained in one specific
extant pathogen are, for instance for M. grisea, families
involved in subtilase and cutinase activity and families
related to the polyketide biosynthesis pathway. All of
these gene families have been directly linked to the
pathogenic phenotype in M. grisea [11,12]. In the pathogen M. graminicola we observed a significant gain of
families containing genes with peptidase and phospholipase A2 activities. These functions are needed for the
organization of infective structures in pathogenic fungi.
The expression of genes with phospholipase A2 activity
is induced in pathogenic fungi during nutrient starvation, which is assumed to be an environmental trigger
for host invasion [13]. Families specifically gained by M.
fijiensis are enriched in metallo-exopeptidase activity
which has been related to the morphological development of infective structures in the fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis [14]. In the pathogen F. graminearum we
found some specific gained gene families related to lipid
metabolism and peptidase activity that do not occur in
any other species. In F. graminearum we also observed
the gain of specific gene families associated with transmembrane transporters.
The higher than average family size we observed in
multiple extant pathogens that form a monophyletic
clade in the species tree, are explained by gains in the
common ancestor of these related species, maintained in
the extant species (DOLLOP and CAFE). An example is
the gain of proteolysis related gene families in the common ancestor TP13 of the closely related M. fijiensis
and M. graminicola species. Especially the gain of a
family of zinc endopeptidases with astacin activity is
interesting as it has been related to the activation of
peptides that act as morphogenetic signal for foot activation in Hydra [15].
Of particular interest are the different families, all
involved in similar biological processes that were gained
independently in multiple species, that are not each other
close neighbors in the species tree, as these confer examples of convergent evolution. For instance, F. graminearum and M. grisea both independently gained gene
families that are different from each other, but all related
to polyssacharide binding and chitinase activity. Chitinases are closely linked to growth and morphological
development in fungi: cell expansion and division, spore
germination, hyphal branching and septum formation all
depend on enzymes with hydrolytic activities including
chitinases [16]. In previous work, a larger than expected
size of the chitinase family was already observed for F.
graminearum [17]. Similarly, the genomes of F.

Figure 3 Evolutionary events explaining gene copy number variations between pathogens and non-pathogens. Numbers at each node
represent the presence (’1’) or absence (’0’) of members of a hypothetical gene family in each lineage descending from an ancestral species. A)
Pathogen-specific gene family gains (Class 1). This event explains the origin of gene families that are not present in an ancestral species
common to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic lineages, but appear in one extant pathogen or in an ancestral node that gives rise to
exclusively pathogenic lineages. B) Pathogen-specific gene family expansions (Class 2): gene families that are already present in the last common
ancestor of the extant species become expanded in a lineage specific way (denoted by a star (*)). C) Non-pathogen-specific losses (Class 3). This
event results in gene families that were either present in the last common ancestor of all species or in an ancestor common to both pathogenic
and non-pathogenic lineages to become lost selectively in non-pathogenic lineages. Loss of a gene family refers to selective loss of all its
members in the considered species or ancestral node. In our study, non-pathogen-specific gene family loss was only observed in extant species.
Note that in the pathogenic lineages where members of the considered families were not lost, sometimes a further expansion of the families
was observed as denoted by a star (*). D) Pathogen-specific gene family losses (Class 4): gene families either already present in the last common
ancestor of all species or in an ancestral species common to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic lineages got lost selectively in pathogenic
lineages. In our study, this pathogen-specific gene family loss was also only observed in extant species.

graminearum, M. fijiensis and M. grisea gained different
sets of families all related to oxidative stress response,
such as families involved in glutathione and thioredoxin
peroxidase activities. These gene families that were
gained independently from each other in evolution could
be involved in a generally conserved defence mechanism
of fungi against plant mediated oxidative burst [18]. We
also observed different families related to transferase
activity that were gained independently in F. graminearum, M. fijiensis and M. graminicola.
Pathogen-specific gene family expansions (Class 2)

Also gene families with an origin ancestral to both
pathogens and non-pathogens that expanded in a pathogen-specific way can explain the larger size of gene
families in extant pathogens (Figure 3B). Based on
CAFE (see Methods), 23 such gene families showed a
significant expansion in extant pathogenic species
(Additional file 3). For instance, a gene family with
methyltransferase activity that has previously been
related to fungal growth and virulence [19] showed a
significant expansion in F. graminearum. As methyltransferases methylate fungal specific glucosylceramides,
i.e., molecules that serve as receptors for antifungal

plant defensins, they can be directly linked to molecular
interactions between the fungus and its host.
Two more gene families with Ribonuclease H and
RNA-directed DNA polymerase activities showed a significant expansion in M. grisea. Not surprisingly, the
function of these families is related to processing transposable elements which are, as indicated by the DOLLOP analysis abundantly present in the genome of
M. grisea. Insertional mutants of genes from both the
Ribonuclease H and RNA-directed DNA polymerase
activities gene families are virulence defectives (Table 2).
An ancestral family involved in the polyketide biosynthesis pathway was also found to have been expanded in
M. grisea. The relation of polyketide biosynthesis with
pathogenicity in M. grisea is strongly supported by the
work of Jeon et al. (2007) based on insertional mutagenesis (Table 2).
Although contractions of gene families in ancestral
nodes can theoretically be inferred by CAFE, we did not
observe them.
Non-pathogen-specific losses (Class 3)

and pathogen-specific expansions of ancestral gene

families only account for 18.4% of the families with
enlarged size in pathogens (according to DOLLOP and
CAFE). For a considerable fraction of the families
(79.3%), the observed gene family sizes in the extant
pathogens seems to originate from an ancestral gene
family that got lost in extant non-pathogens, but that
was selectively maintained in the pathogens (Figure 3C).
With ‘loss of a family in a particular species or ancestral
node’ we refer here to an ancestral gene family that lost
all of its members in the species of interest descending
from the ancestor. The non-pathogen-specific loss of
ancestral gene families is in line with the overall
observed higher number of gene losses in non-pathogens than in pathogens (most obvious for species deriving from TP7) for the species we used in this study.
The most striking examples of non-pathogen-specific
family losses are those observed for the families involved
in transmembrane transport (more specifically secondary
active transmembrane transporters, cation:sugar symporters and solute:hydrogen symporters), lipid metabolism
and chitin binding. These families, shared by all pathogens, were present in a common ancestor on TP15, but
got lost in the non-pathogen lineages (TP2, TP4, TP8
and TP9). This indicates that transmembrane transport,
lipid metabolism and chitin binding are essential and
generic traits in determining pathogenicity in
Ascomycetes.
Related to the evolutionary dynamics of gene families
involved in lipid metabolism, it seems that not only
these families were lost in the non-pathogenic branch
(T. reesei lost ancestral gene families involved in lipid
metabolism on TP2), but also that the pathogen F.

graminearum gained some extra families in addition to
the ones it inherited from its ancestor on TP3 (DOLLOP and CAFE, Table 1). The fact that both non-pathogen-specific loss and species-specific gains are observed
for lipid metabolism further strengthens the importance
of this function in pathogenicity. The relation between
lipid metabolism and pathogenicity is further confirmed
by the fact that disrupting the genes encoding for an
extracellular lipase responsible for fatty-acid uptake, significantly reduced virulence in Ascomycete pathogens
[20]. In addition, a gene expression study of F. graminearum isolated from infected plant tissue showed that
genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and degradation
were differentially expressed during host colonization
[20,21].
Transmembrane transport mechanisms are known to
play a key role during the early stages of host invasion
by functioning as receptors for signals from the environment that trigger spore germination [21]. A mutant of a
gene coding belonging to this family of transmembrane
transporters in M. graminicola showed a reduced virulence phenotype (Table 2).
On the other hand, chitin binding proteins are known
as avirulence receptors that interact with the plant host.
Genes encoding chitin binding proteins were differentially expressed in a cDNA library of M. fijiensis grown
in the presence of banana leaves [22].
Other ancestral gene families present on TP15 that
got lost in all studied non-pathogens but were retained
in the pathogens are those involved in mannosidase
activity, astacin activity and the G-coupled protein
receptor.

Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:318
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/318

This model of gene family loss in non-pathogens also
explains why we observed members of the families
related to N-acetyltransferase, oxidoreductase and tartrate dehydrogenase activities only in the genomes of
the pathogens F. graminearum and M. graminicola that
do not form a monophyletic clade in the species tree.
The utilization of tartrate has been linked to the induction of pathogenicity related genes in M. graminicola
[23]. These families originated in the ancestral TP15,
and got lost in all extant species other than F. graminearum and M. graminicola (DOLLOP and CAFE).
Both F. graminearum and M. graminicola share wheat
as common host (Additional file 4) and those families
only being retained in those two pathogens reinforces
the importance of the pathogen-host interaction process
in the selection of pathogenic traits.
In addition to the examples discussed so far where gene
families have been collectively lost during evolution in all
non-pathogens, some losses of gene families were more
restricted to the non-pathogens of the evolutionary branch
that started either from TP7 or the one that descended
from TP14 (these are not discussed in detail here).
Some of the ancestral families that got lost in nonpathogens, but were specifically retained in pathogens
underwent further expansions as predicted by CAFE.
For those cases it is the combined action of non-pathogen-specific loss and pathogen-specific expansions that
explains the observed large family size. For instance the
gene families involved in transmembrane transporters
showed significant expansions in the pathogens M. graminicola and F. graminearum (CAFE, Table 1). The
same was true for the families involved in chitin binding
and astacin activity that were both selectively expanded
in M. Fijiensis.
Pathogen-specific gene family losses (Class 4)

In a few cases only, the acquisition of the pathogenic
phenotype could be related to the loss of ancestrally
present gene families in a pathogen-selective way. A significant number of the families that disappeared in the
ancestor of both Mycospaerella species (TP13) (Figure
3C) are related to nitrogen catabolic processes, to the
regulation of nitrogen utilization and sensing and to cellular responses towards nitrogen starvation. Nitrogen
starvation has been related to virulence in Ascomycete
plant pathogens by acting as an environmental clue for
the expression of disease symptoms in the pathosystem
Magnaporthe grisea - Oryza sativa [24]. Loss of gene
families involved in nitrogen metabolism, regulation and
sensing could reduce the ability of the fungus to sense
environmental nitrogen levels and mimic a continuous
nitrogen starvation condition that might activate the
pathogenicity transcriptional program in M. fijiensis and
M. graminicola.

Dating gene duplication and loss events

Both DOLLOP and CAFE agree in predicting that the
selective loss of families with an ancestral origin in
non-pathogens (i.e. protein families in Class 3) is the
major cause for the observed differences in gene copy
number between extant pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. So far, predictions made by DOLLOP
and CAFE only considered losses of entire gene
families (i.e. gene family losses). This is to be expected
as DOLLOP can only make predictions about ‘presence’ or ‘absence’ (extinct) states of entire protein
families while for CAFE the entire loss of a family provide statistically a stronger signal than the spurious
loss of a single gene in a family. To uncover whether
also less drastic losses i.e., where part of the genes of a
family got lost but not the entire family disappears, we
relied on tree reconciliation. We analyzed 978 families
that have minimally two members in at least one of
the species on TP1, TP2, TP4 and TP5 and in addition
the family should have representatives in at least two
other species (guaranteeing the inference of a reliable
tree). We only considered the part of the species tree
(Figure 1) where a non-pathogenic species always clusters with its pathogenic counterpart (upper part) as
this topology allows directly assessing what proportion
of the observed differences in gene family size between
extant pathogens and non-pathogens are caused by the
different evolutionary scenarios depicted in Figure 4.
Gene trees for all families were constructed. By reconciling them with the species tree, we predicted the
nodes at which duplication and loss events occurred
during evolution of the studies species [25]. To avoid
biases introduced by large scale tree reconciliation
[26], we retained 445 (45.5%) trees of which the topology was supported with a bootstrap value of at least
75% (the full list of these trees in Newick format can
be found in the SI) and only considered the reconciliation results obtained from gene trees with a reliable
topology (see materials and methods).
The reconciliation analysis showed that for a relative
small fraction of the gene families, larger gene family
sizes in the extant pathogens F. graminearum and
M. grisea resulted from expansions of ancestral or later
gained gene families specifically occurring in these genomes (Figure 4, B and 4C) (17% of the families in
M. grisea and 16% of the families in F. graminearum).
Most expansions occurred selectively in the genome of
M. grisea. Conversely, expansions of gene families in
non-pathogens did barely occur.
The majority of the families with a larger gene copy
number in extant pathogens (65% of the families in M.
grisea and 45.6% of the families in F. graminearum)
seem to have been the result of ancestral gene families
of which the copies were selectively maintained in the

Figure 4 Origin of the observed variation in gene copy number between Ascomycete species as explained by tree reconciliation.
Panels A and B describe two hypothetical scenarios of how the size of a gene family increased in the extant species: A: enlarged gene family
size due to a specific expansion in an extant species (species 1). B: enlarged gene family size in extant species 1 due to an expansion
(duplication) in an ancestral node (’D’) before the speciation event between species 1 and 2. Extant species 2 lost one of the copies (’L’ in a red
circle leading to a gray faded branch) C: Tree representing the phylogenetic relations between the studied species. Branches of the tree
corresponding to pathogenic species are shaded in yellow. Pie charts indicate, for each of the extant species at the leave of a branch, how
many of its gene families with increased size originated through scenario A and B. For instance, for a pathogen, scenario A means that there
was a species-specific expansion in the pathogenic branch, while scenario B indicates the gene family in the studied species enlarged because
of an ancestral duplication followed by a loss in the non-pathogen, closest to the studied pathogen (see species tree). The color level used in
the pie charts (following the blue-to-red scale in below) is an indication for the fraction of enlarged gene families in the studied species,
explained by either scenario A or B versus the total number of families included in the phylogenetic analysis. This shows that scenario B occurs
much more frequently in absolute numbers in pathogens than in non pathogens.

pathogens, but got (partially) lost in the non-pathogenic
counterparts (Figure 4A and 4C). The observed gene
family contractions in the non-pathogens were significantly higher than contractions observed in pathogenic
gene families.

Discussion
Previous comparative approaches studied pathogenicity
in Ascomycetes mainly by comparing gene inventories
in extant species. In line with these studies we showed
that gene families which exhibit a size larger than the
family-average in pathogens are responsible for acquired
phenotypic traits related to pathogenicity [3,4]. However,
by not only studying differences in gene family size
between pathogens and non-pathogens, but by also analyzing the complete evolutionary history that gave rise
to the observed differences in gene family size, we found
that only a relatively small fraction of the gene families
with a size that is selectively larger in pathogens could
be explained by the combined effect of gene family gain
with pathogen-specific expansions.

Most of the families with such larger size in pathogens
seemed to have been present already in the ancestor of
both pathogens and non-pathogens. The potential of
genes and gene products needed to develop pathogenicity was already present in the ancestor of all current
species and was selectively maintained in pathogens.
Strikingly, it were not the pathogen-specific expansions
of these ancestrally present gene families that explained
the discrepancies in gene family size between pathogens
and non-pathogens, but rather the selective loss of those
ancestrally present gene families in non-pathogens. Species that did not develop pathogenicity seem to have
reduced their genetic complexity compared to their
ancestors. Gene families that evolved according to this
gene loss theory are mainly involved in generic functions, conserved amongst all fungi such as transmembrane transport, lipase activity, mannosidase activity,
G-coupled protein receptor and astacin activity. Only
the number of families with those functions remained
considerably higher in pathogens than in non-pathogens.
This observation is confirmed by previous molecular

Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:318
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/318

studies which showed indeed that a vast repertoire of
genes, involved in virulence and pathogenicity, have
general functions conserved among all fungal species (e.
g. cell surface receptors, members of signaling pathways,
transmembrane transporters, members of secondary
metabolic pathways) [7].
Pathogenic fungi have to closely interact with their
host. It is, therefore, not surprising that the host-pathogen interaction further shaped the genomes of fungal
pathogens in the Ascomycetes. We observed that the
interaction with a specific environment resulted in the
differential retention of gene families with similar functionalities in phylogenetically distant pathogenic species
(e.g. families with N-acetyltransferase, oxidoreductase
and tartrate dehydrogenase activities shared by the
pathogens F. graminearum and M. graminicola). Moreover, all families that are expanded in certain pathogens
could be functionally linked to the specificities of the
host-fungus interaction. The latter observations emphasize the importance of the environment in explaining
expansions in family size.

Conclusions
We found that most of the proteins needed to develop
pathogenicity were already present in the ancestor of
the Ascomycetes lineages we used in our study, i.e. nonpathogenic and plant pathogenic Pezizomycotina. Species that did not develop pathogenicity reduced their
genetic complexity compared to their ancestors or
pathogenic counterparts. We further showed that expansions of gained or already existing families in a speciesspecific way are important to fine-tune the specificities
of the pathogenic host-fungus interaction.
Methods
Species selection

As mentioned before, for the Ascomycetes in general,
the pathogenic phenotype does not coincide completely
with the species phylogeny. As a result we selected for
our analysis 1) a subset of species for which the pathogenic phenotype is in accordance with the species phylogeny (non-pathogens that are each others closest
neighbors on the species tree) and 2) a subset of species
for which the pathogenic phenotype does not agree with
the species phylogeny (pathogen and non-pathogen that
are each others closest neighbors in the species tree).
Moreover, to avoid biases in our analysis we selected an
equal number of non-pathogenic versus pathogenic species. This resulted in the following selection: as nonpathogens we selected Neurospora crassa (BROAD Institute, v3.0), Trichoderma reesei (DOE Joint Genome
Institute, v2.0), Aspergillus nidulans (BROAD Institute,
v4.0) and Aspergillus oryzae (BROAD Institute, v3.0). As
pathogens we choose the well studied plant pathogens:

Page 13 of 16

Magnaporthe grisea (BROAD Institute, v6.0) and Fusarium graminearum (BROAD Institute, v3.0) and two economically important plant pathogens, Mycosphaerella
fijiensis (DOE Joint Genome Institute, v1.0) and Mycosphaerella graminocola (DOE Joint Genome Institute,
v1.0). As outgroup species we selected the well annotated model organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(BROAD Institute, v2.0), Schizosaccharomyces pombe
(BROAD Institute, v2.0) and Ustilago maydis (BROAD
Institute, v2.0).
Construction of gene families

Gene families were reconstructed from the proteomes of
the selected species. Pairwise similarities were obtained
by an all-against-all BLASTP search using an E-value
cutoff of 10E-05. Protein families were derived based on
these similarity scores by means of protein clustering.
Three different tools for protein clustering,
ORTHOMCL [27], BLASTCLUST [28] and GENERAGE
[29] were evaluated using a benchmark dataset consisting of experimentally validated gene families collected
from the literature (Additional file 5). BLASTCLUST
seemed to suffer from transitivity relations that are the
result of the multidomain composition of eukaryotic
proteins and often created large superfamilies of nonrelated proteins. Both GENERAGE and ORTHOMCL
obtained a high accuracy on the benchmark and performed well with respect to the multidomain composition of proteins. As ORTHOMCL has the advantage of
being notably faster than GENERAGE, final gene
families were reconstructed using ORTHOMCL (with
an inflation factor of 1.5). This resulted in 89,554 individual proteins being clustered based on their sequence
similarity into 12,530 families containing two or more
members (multiprotein families) and 19,537 singletons
i.e., proteins lacking significant homology to other proteins in the dataset.
Clustering of phylogenetic profiles

For each gene family (12,530 in total), a phylogenetic
profile was constructed. Each value in the profile corresponds to the number of genes a particular species contains for that family. To decide, for each family, whether
it contains for one or more species a considerably larger
number of genes than observed on average for that family
in the remainder of the species, we transformed the profiles as follows: 1) every value in a profile equal to ‘1’ was
converted to ‘0’ since ‘1’ represents de novo gene gains
and no enlargement in the corresponding species 2) the
profile was then normalized by subtracting its minimum
and dividing by its maximum. By this transformation all
the values in a profile were rescaled from 0 (meaning no
size enlargement at all in a particular species) to 1 (corresponding to the maximum relative size enlargement in a

Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:318
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/318

particular species). A gene family was then considered to
selectively display a size larger than the family-average in
the species where its normalized value exceeded 0.25.
Gene families with a profile containing values above 0.25
were clustered according to their normalized phylogenetic profiles. For visualization, the log2-values in the
normalized profiles were plotted.
Functional annotation of proteins and protein families

Proteins and protein families were functionally annotated
using Gene Ontology (GO, subcategories molecular function and biological process) [30]. In the first step, all proteins were assigned to GO categories by BLAST2GO
[31]. If a protein was assigned to a specific GO level, it
was automatically assigned to all parental levels of that
GO class. GO annotation at the family level was obtained
by listing the GO labels for all the genes that belong to a
particular family. A weight, equal to the percentage of
genes carrying a particular label was assigned to all the
GO labels in the family. Only GO labels with a weight
greater than 30% were considered as representative for
the family. The statistical significance of functional GO
enrichment in protein families groups/clusters was evaluated using the hypergeometric distribution. Multiple
hypothesis testing was done by FDR [32].
Inference of the species tree

One hundred single-copy core protein families (i.e., protein families containing exactly one protein in every studied species) were extracted from the previously
obtained phylogenetic profiles of the protein families.
For every single-copy core protein family, a multiple
alignment was created using ClustalW [33]. Columns in
the alignment for which a gap was present in >10% of
the sequences were removed. To reduce the chance of
including misaligned amino acids, all positions in the
alignment left or right from the gap were also removed
until a column in the sequence alignment was found for
which the residues were conserved in all genes included
in our analysis. Conservation was determined as follows:
for every pair of residues in the column, the BLOSUM62 value was retrieved. If at least half of the pairs
had a BLOSUM62 value > 0, the column was considered
conserved. The different multiple alignments were concatenated into one large alignment for which a distance
matrix was calculated based on Poisson correction using
the software package TREECON [34]. The phylogenetic
tree was constructed by neighbor-joining. Bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates was performed to test the significance of the nodes.
Detection of orthologs

Three fungal species, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Schizossacharomyces pombe and Ustilago maydis, were

Page 14 of 16

included as outgroups. Orthologous genes were detected
between outgroups and the eight Ascomycete species by
the Reciprocal Smallest Distance algorithm (RSD) using
default parameters [35].
Loss and acquisition of gene families

As DOLLOP has already been used successfully in previous studies [36,37], we applied it to our datasets to
reconstruct a parsimonious evolutionary history of the
studied gene families. The DOLLOP program [8] is
based on the Dollo principle of parsimony, which
assumes irreversible character loss [9]. In the context of
our dataset it means that once a gene family is predicted
to be lost in one or more lineages, it can no longer be
regained during evolution. As input, a binary matrix
derived from the phylogenetic profiles of the protein
families was used. In this matrix ‘0’ and ‘1’ indicate the
presence or absence of each protein family in each of
the eight studied genomes and the ‘outgroups’. For the
three outgroups, presence or absence of a representative
of a protein family was based on the orthology map that
was derived as explained in the section “Detection of
orthologs”.
Evolution of gene family size

The evolution of gene family size was statistically analyzed by CAFE [10]. CAFE assumes a stochastic birth
and death (BD) process to model the changes in gene
family size over a phylogeny and to estimate the most
likely family size in the ancestral species [38]. The phylogenetic profiles of the gene families and a species tree
of which the branch lengths are integer and ultrametric
time units (i.e. the sum of the lengths from the root to
the extant species should be the same for all paths)
were used as input for CAFE. This tree was inferred
using the same set of concatenated genes used for constructing the species tree but now inference was done
based on the nucleotide sequences. A distance matrix
was obtained using the DNADIST tool of the PHYLIP
suite [8] from a concatenated multiple alignment of the
input sequences. The phylogeny was then inferred by
KITSCH, also from the PHYLIP suite which assumes an
evolutionary clock model and provides ultrametric trees.
The following tree in Newick format was supplied as
input: ((((((fgr:15,tre:15):7,(ncr:20,mgr:20):2):11,((myg:16,
mfi:16):14,(ani:12,aor:12):18):3):26,sce:59):1,spo:60):2,
uma:62). An expectation maximization analysis was performed to estimate the parameter l which is the probability of both gene gain and loss per unit of time in the
phylogeny (for our dataset l = 0.016 was estimated).
CAFE computes a p-value for each of the gene families
in the dataset. This p-value indicates how well changes
in the number of genes in a family over the phylogeny
could be explained by assuming a birth and death

Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:318
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/318

model fitted to the whole dataset. CAFE also identifies
gene families of which the size in certain species is unlikely under a stochastic BD process. These families are
considered to show significant expansions or contractions during evolution.
We used the ‘likelihood ratio test’ option of CAFE to
identify branches along which the size change was larger
than expected. This allows identifying the extant species
or ancestral nodes where the identified significant
expansions or contractions took place.

Gene tree construction and reconciliation

For each gene family, a multiple sequence alignment
was created with ClustalW using default parameters.
Alignments were further edited by removing non-informative columns as was done for the species tree (see
above). Neighbor-joining trees (with 500 bootstrap replicates) were constructed with PHYLIP [8] using amino
acid sequences and simple Poisson-corrected substitution models (l = 1). Orthologs from the outgroup species were used to root the trees. In cases where no
outgroup orthologs existed, unrooted trees were generated. Gene trees were filtered based on bootstrap analysis using a cutoff of 75%. Supported trees were then
reconciled with the species tree using Notung [39].
Reconciled trees were further checked to account for
possible biases in the phylogenetic tree reconciliation
method as reported in Hahn et al [26]. To minimize
artefacts of tree reconciliation we only considered trees
where after a duplication event at least for one species
the paralogs were retained. Tree topologies for which
this is not the case often reflect erroneous gene trees
and reconciling them with the species tree results in a
serious overestimation of the number of loss events.

Additional file 3: Supplemental Table 3 - List of the gene families
that show a significant expansion according to CAFE. Gene Family
ID: ID of the gene family (corresponding to the numbering in Additional
file 2). Description: based on GO labels of the genes contained within
the family. Tree in Newick format: The Newick format corresponds to
the species tree (((FG TR) (NC MG)) ((MYG MF) (AN AO))). FG: Fusarium
graminearum; TR: Trichoderma reesei; NC: Neurospora crassa; MG:
Magnaporthe grisea; MYG: Mycosphaerella graminicola; MF: Mycosphaerella
fijiensis; AN: Aspergillus nidulans; AO: Aspergillus oryzae. The numbers
indicate the family size per species. The number in bold corresponds to
the family size in the species where the largest expansion took place.
Species: species where the gene family showed an unusual size
expansion. Likelihood ratio: calculated by CAFE, indicates the likelihood
that the change in family size in the mentioned species was greater than
expected.

Pathogenicity defective mutants in Ascomycete species

Data about experimentally validated pathogenicity factors in Ascomycete genomes were obtained from 1) the
Pathogen-Host Interaction database (PHI-base available
at http://www.phi-base.org/) [40] which contains an
overview of experimental phenotype data subdivided
into the following categories: ‘reduced virulence’, ‘loss of
pathogenicity’, ‘unaffected pathogenicity’, ‘effector’; 2)
the study by Jeon et al. [41] which provides a collection
of Magnaporthe grisea insertional mutants from which
they selected 202 new pathogenicity loci based on a
phenotype analysis (they recorded mutants with a deviation compared to a non-transformed control in the
number of germinated conidia and appressorium formation). Deviating mutants were subdivided according to
their observed phenotypes as ‘conidiation defective’,
‘appressorium formation defective’ and ‘ambiguous’.
From those mutants, we selected 64 strains of which the
affected locus was located in a coding region.
