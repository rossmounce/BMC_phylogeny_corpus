IS3 profiling identifies the enterohaemorrhagic
Escherichia coli O-island 62 in a distinct
enteroaggregative E. coli lineage

Abstract
Background: Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are important diarrhoeal pathogens that are defined by a
HEp-2 adherence assay performed in specialist laboratories. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has revealed that
aggregative adherence is convergent, providing an explanation for why not all EAEC hybridize with the plasmidderived probe for this category, designated CVD432. Some EAEC lineages are globally disseminated or more closely
associated with disease.
Results: To identify genetic loci conserved within significant EAEC lineages, but absent from non-EAEC, IS3-based
PCR profiles were generated for 22 well-characterised EAEC strains. Six bands that were conserved among, or
missing from, specific EAEC lineages were cloned and sequenced. One band corresponded to the aggR gene, a
plasmid-encoded regulator that has been used as a diagnostic target but predominantly detects EAEC bearing the
plasmid already marked by CVD432. The sequence from a second band was homologous to an open-reading
frame within the cryptic enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157 genomic island, designated O-island 62. Screening
of an additional 46 EAEC strains revealed that the EHEC O-island 62 was only present in those EAEC strains
belonging to the ECOR phylogenetic group D, largely comprised of sequence type (ST) complexes 31, 38 and 394.
Conclusions: The EAEC 042 gene orf1600, which lies within the EAEC equivalent of O-island 62 island, can be used
as a marker for EAEC strains belonging to the ECOR phylogenetic group D. The discovery of EHEC O-island 62 in
EAEC validates the genetic profiling approach for identifying conserved loci among phylogenetically related strains.

Background
Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) were originally associated with persistent diarrhoea in developing
countries but are now known to cause both acute and
persistent diarrhoea worldwide [1]. EAEC strains all
demonstrate a characteristic aggregative adherence to
human epithelial cells in vivo or in culture. There are
no other phenotypic or genotypic properties known to
be shared by all EAEC strains, and the contribution of
potential EAEC virulence factors to human disease is
yet to be assessed. Volunteer studies and outbreaks have
unequivocally demonstrated that at least some EAEC
strains are pathogens [2-5]. However, epidemiological
studies have always recovered EAEC from healthy

people as well as individuals with diarrhoea. Although
host factors are one reason for this observation [6,7], it
is almost certain that not all EAEC strains are
pathogenic.
The Gold Standard for EAEC detection is the HEp-2
adherence assay. As this assay can only be performed in
specialised research and reference laboratories, most epidemiological studies employ a DNA probe, CVD432 to
detect EAEC. This is an empirically identified fragment
derived from the aggregative plasmid of Chilean isolate
17-2 [8]. It is now known to be part of an operon
encoding an export system for the enteroaggregative
secreted anti-aggregative protein, Aap, also known as
dispersin [9]. The CVD432 probe was originally shown
to have a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 99% [8].
However, more recent and inclusive studies have shown
that although it maintains specificity, the sensitivity of
the probe varies from under 20% to over 80% [10].

As most epidemiological studies have used this probe
alone to identify EAEC, their importance in diarrhoea is
currently underestimated and the true, overall sensitivity
of the CVD432 probe is unknown. Moreover, plasmids
that bear this locus do not have a conserved backbone
[11,12].
Genetic studies are needed to identify alternatives or
supplements to the currently available probe. Furthermore, upon completion of the sequence analysis of the
genome of the CVD432-positive EAEC strain 042 [13],
emphasized the need to determine which genes are present in other EAEC strains. Multilocus sequence typing
of 150 EAEC strains recently revealed that EAEC strains
are distributed throughout the E. coli phylogeny but that
closely related EAEC strains did share some known
virulence genes. For example, most EAEC strains
belonging to the ECOR group D (principally ST complex 31, 38 and 394 strains) carry long polar fimbriae
genes, a chromosomal antimicrobial resistance island,
the heat-resistant agglutinin gene and the pathogenicity
island-encoded fepC gene [12]. Additionally, epidemiological association of EAEC with disease varies with different lineages with ST complexes 38 and 394 (ECOR
group D) and 10 (ECOR group A) less commonly recovered from healthy individuals in Nigeria. Thus, the
aggregative adherence phenotype emerged independently in multiple EAEC lineages and the EAEC category as defined by adherence pattern alone is likely to
be comprised of strains that have different pathogenic
mechanisms [12].
In this study, we attempted to identify other genetic
loci that are common to strains belonging to globally
disseminated EAEC lineages. We used IS-3 profiling, a
PCR-profiling method that takes advantage of the fact
that E. coli strains typically have multiple copies of
insertion-sequence 3 at different locations in the genome [14-16]. The profiling is performed at low stringency so that loci distant from IS3 elements may also be
amplified. Our objective was to identify loci that, unlike
previously described conserved genes, are not necessarily
plasmid borne, and are uncommon in non-EAEC. Such
loci could be candidate targets for diagnostic tests.

bands common across multiple related STs, allowing us
to identify loci that might be conserved among them.
The diversity of profiles seen in this study adds to existing information that points to considerable heterogeneity among EAEC. The data shows that there is also
genetic diversity within common EAEC STs, such as
ST10, ST34 and ST31, but there are some profile similarities within these groups (Figure 1).
There were no bands of identical size that amplified
from all EAEC but were absent in non-EAEC controls.
Nine band-sizes were of interest because they were
either present or absent in most EAEC strains or specific STs/ST complexes. Three of these bands did not
amplify during more than one screening and were therefore not examined further. We were able to reproducibly
amplify and clone six bands, which were end-sequenced
from plasmid clones (Table 1). Four bands contained
DNA that originated from housekeeping genes, which
gene-specific PCR demonstrated were also present in
strains that lacked the band (data not shown). Therefore
the banding pattern is likely to be due to absence of a
proximal IS3 element or other complementary DNA for
priming. One band represented a region adjacent to the

IS3-based PCR profiling is less discriminatory than
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and generates much
smaller band sizes, which made it suitable for isolating
conserved bands for characterisation [16]. Since we
observed 20 non-identical profiles among 22 EAEC
reference strains belonging to 15 STs, IS3-profiling was
more discriminatory than MLST. However, there were

[17]. IS3 elements are now known to be frequently
found on large virulence plasmids, particularly EAEC
plasmids, which explains this finding [11,12]. aggR is a
known diagnostic test target associated with EAEC virulence plasmids, which has shown better sensitivity than
CVD432 in some studies, but is less specific [18-20].
The sequence derived from another band, predominant
among the ST31 complex strains, also detected in the
single ST394 strain, but absent in other EAEC, was 98%
identical to orfz2240 from E. coli O157 strain EDL933
[21]. The z2240 open reading frame is located within the
small (1,548 bp) O-island 62 of strain EDL933 and is also
present in the genome of E. coli O157 Sakai (where it is
annotated as Ecs2075 [22]) and four other O157:H7genomes. Similar loci (95% or greater identity over the entire
sequence length) are present in the genomes of O55:H7
strain CB9615 (O55:H7 strains are believed to be the progenitors of O157 EHEC [23]), uropathogenic E. coli
strains UMN026 and IAI39, multiresistant commensal
SMS-3-5, as well as four Shigella flexneri 2a strains and a
Sh. sonnei strain [24]. Like ST31 and ST394-complex
EAEC, uropathogenic E. coli strains, and the single commensal, that have this island belong to ECOR group D
[25]. O-island 62 is absent from all other 111 complete
and 83 incomplete E. coli and related enterobacterial genomes that were publicly available by January 2011.
Distribution of orfz2240 DNA among EAEC and non-EAEC

Forty-six additional EAEC strains, not used in the profiling that initially identified orfz2240, were screened for
orfz2240 by PCR, using primers 2240f and 2240r. These
isolates were previously isolated from children with diarrhoea in an epidemiological study in Nigeria, and like the
reference collection have been multilocus sequence-

typed [12,26]. As shown in Figure 2, the z2240 orf was
amplified from twelve of these strains. Two z2240positive strains from Nigeria belonged to the ST complex
31 (STs130 and 512), seven to ST394, and two others
belonged to the ST38 complex (STs 38 and 426), which
shares mdh and purA alleles with ST31 and ST394 complexes and clusters with them by BURST and ClonalFrame analyses. The last strain (ST506) does not belong
to a designated ST complex but is also an ECOR D
EAEC strain [12,27]. Altogether (with the reference collection), this gene was detected in all 17 isolates from the
ECOR D group sequence type complexes but was absent
from the 51 isolates from all other sequence types including all isolates belonging to the most common EAEC ST
complex, ST10.
We have previously found chuA, fepC-PAI and lpfcontaining islands in EAEC strains belonging to ST31
and ST394 complexes [12,25]. These loci are also present in all ECOR group D EAEC and all three loci are
present in EHEC O157 strains. Eighteen EHEC strains
were screened for orfz2240 by hybridisation (Table 2).
Only three isolates, all O157 strains, tested positive and
all non-O157 EHEC strains lacked the gene. As also
shown in Tables 2 and 3, orfz2240 was detected uncommonly outside the EHEC O157 and EAEC ECOR group
D pathotypes. Important exceptions were diffuselyadherent E. coli and Shigella sonnei. Eight of eleven diffusely-adherent E. coli strains tested positive, as did 20
of 24 Shigella sonnei strains. We also screened 85 strains
from 13 genera of enteric bacteria with probes for
CVD432 and orfz2240. None of the isolates tested positive with the CVD432 probe and most were negative for
orfz2240. Two Aeromonas hydrophilia gp isolates from
diarrhoeal stools and none of four isolates of the same
species from shellfish hybridised to the z2240 probe.

Figure 2 Presence or absence orfz2240 mapped onto a 75% consensus ClonalFrame tree for MLST data from 53 EAEC strains
including 46 strains from Nigerian children with diarrhoea (D) and cases of from other parts of the world (R). Principal E. coli sub-clades
corresponding to three of the four major groups originally defined by MLEE - A, B1, and D - are marked in first the column to the immediate
right of the tree respectively with light shading, no shading and dark shading. The central column indicates strain source with shaded strains
from Nigeria and the far right column indicates presence (dark shading) or absence (light shading) of the orfz2240 locus.

Additionally, one of four Morganella spp., and one of six
Escherichia hermannii strains hybridized to this probe
(Table 2).
The EAEC equivalent of O-island 62 is similar but not
identical to the EHEC island

The flanking sequence of the cloned fragment, retrieved
from the EAEC 042 genome, demonstrated that the
EHEC O157 and EAEC 042 islands are of similar size
and sequence, being 95% identical at the nucleotide
level, but there are important differences in their predicted proteins (Figure 3). O-island 62 of EHEC strain
EDL933 (and the equivalent and virtually identical island
from EHEC O157 Sakai) is between the K-12 open reading frames yddG and narU. It is comprised of four open

reading frames, annotated z2239-z2242. By contrast, the
042 island contains three open reading frames, orfs
1601-1599, the middle orf, orf1600, is a concatenate of
EDL933 orfs z2240 and z2241 (Figure 3). A frameshift
at position 70-71 (with respect to the 042 orf1600
sequence), results in a premature stop codon in z2240
of EHEC. The two predicted EHEC orfs thus generated
show very high similarity to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the
EAEC open reading frame (92% and 94% identical at the
amino acid level respectively). Other O157 strains also
have the EDL933 variety of the island.
In place of these genes, E. coli K-12 strain MG1655
carries three predicted open-reading frames yddL, yddK
and yddJ. Predicted open reading frames yddL and yddJ
are very small, with significant similarity to the 5’ end of

EHEC strain EDL933 orf z2239 and the 3’ end of z2242
respectively (Figure 2). Therefore, although the entire
island was probably acquired relatively recently in evolutionary time (its GC content, depending on strain,
ranges between 33 and 36% compared to 48-50% for
flanking DNA), it is likely that the EHEC or EAEC varieties represent the ancestral island, and that this was
disrupted in E. coli K-12 by insertion of yddK. YddK is
another predicted leucine-rich repeat protein and possible glycoprotein, with a predicted RNAse inhibitor
domain found in most E. coli genomes and essential to
E. coli K-12 [28].

Discussion
Pathogen genomes contain genomic islands that are
absent in non-pathogens. At least some of these islands
contribute to virulence. Genomic islands may have been
acquired by the common ancestor of a pathogenic lineage in which case they can serve as a marker for the
lineage irrespective of their present contribution to virulence. Although some genomic islands have been

described, much less is known about chromosomal
EAEC virulence loci than plasmid-borne genes. Recent
ordering of EAEC lineages by MLST has allowed us to
conduct a within- and between-lineage search for
unique DNA. The objective of this study was to identify
conserved genetic loci among principal EAEC lineages.
We hypothesised that EAEC strains, or subgroups of
them would harbour conserved chromosomal loci and
that identifying them would serve to improve the understanding of these pathogens, enhance their identification
for research and clinical purposes and potentially find
vaccine candidates.
Identification of factors that are common to pathogenic bacteria but absent in non-pathogens is an
approach that has been shown to have promise for identifying virulence loci and candidate antimicrobial targets.
For example, [29] used in silico methods to mine
sequenced genomes for pathogen-specific factors. As
there is only one completed EAEC genome, and just
three others are in progress, we elected to use lowerresolution PCR-based genetic profiling to compare 22
genomes. Since a number of genomic islands contain, or
are proximal to IS3 elements, we hypothesised that IS3based profiling would identify loci that are lineage specific, and which might contribute to virulence. Using this
approach, we were able to identify two diagnostic candidates, aggR and orf1600. The former is a transcriptional
activator that has been characterised functionally and
used to detect EAEC in epidemiological surveys [17,19].
The second target we identified is within an island present in EHEC O157 strains (as orfz2240) and in EAEC
strains (orf1600) belonging to the ECOR D lineage.
Compared to in silico methods, our approach yielded
few hits. However, the small size of the z2240/orf1600
island and the aggR gene mean that the loci identified
by IS3 profiling could be overlooked by other
approaches.
The functionally-characterised protein showing greatest
similarity to the predicted product of EHEC orfz2240/
EAEC orf1600 is the invasion plasmid antigen H (IpaH) of
Shigella. Amino acid residues 4-60 of Z2240 (and of EAEC
Orf1600) are 35.8% identical to residues 3-119 of the 532
amino-acid IpaH variant (accession number gi152747).
Each Shigella strain has multiple variants of IpaH which
are more similar to each other than to Z2240, and vary in
length. IpaH is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is temporally
associated with Shigella pathogenicity [30-32] Z2241 is
predicted to be a leucine-rich protein of unknown function. If it is expressed, the EAEC hybrid Orf1600 could
represent a bifunctional protein. However, EAEC strains
appear to be mucosal pathogens and therefore it is not
clear if a ubiquitin ligase, which might have a role in
targeting intracellular proteins to the proteosome,
would contribute to pathogenicity in this pathotype.

Multiple attempts to over-express EAEC orf1600 for
purification (data not shown) were unsuccessful, most
likely due to toxicity. This, with comparative analysis
of E. coli genomes, suggests that the 042 version of the
island, and orf1600 in particular, may be under negative selection.
It is not known whether any or all of the versions of
this island make functional proteins but this does not
preclude expression or functional data emerging from
future studies. However, identification of two targets,
one previously unreported, offers proof-of-principle of
our method for identifying general and lineage-specific
EAEC loci. Following the realisation that the EAEC
category is comprised of multiple pathotypes, convenient markers for significant lineages are needed to help
determine their epidemiological significance. One such
lineage is ECOR phylogenetic group D EAEC, which is
globally disseminated and includes prototypical EAEC
strain 042 that produced diarrhoea in three of five volunteers during a human challenge experiment [3]. The
EAEC ECOR group D lineage contains strains belonging
to ST31-, ST394- and ST38-complexes. ST394-complex
EAEC were isolated much more frequently from Nigerian
children with diarrhoea than from controls and after
ST10, this complex was the most common in that population [12,25]. All the ST394-complex isolates in the
E. coli MLST database appear to be EAEC strains and
therefore this ST-complex represents a common complex
that is very likely EAEC-specific. ST38 was much less frequently isolated from Nigerian children but was the only
complex detected more than three times that was not
recovered from controls, suggesting that it may represent
a truly virulent lineage [12]. The island reported here
could serve as a marker for the EAEC ECOR D lineage
and combining the 2240 probe with commonly-employed
diagnostic probes that detect the plasmid marked by
CVD432, could help to determine the specific contribution of these EAEC pathotypes to the burden of diarrhoeal disease.

Conclusion
A genomic island 95% identical to EHEC O157 O-island
62 is present in EAEC strains belonging to the ECOR D
lineage. An open reading frame on this island, annotated
as orf1600 in the EAEC 042 genome, can be used to
identify this important EAEC lineage and the IS3 profiling method used to identify this locus can be used to
identify conserved DNA in important enterobacterial
lineages.
Materials and methods
Bacterial Strains

Twenty-two enteroaggregative E. coli strains from
diverse geographical locations that have recently been

Page 7 of 10

typed by mutilocus sequence typing (MLST) constituted
a reference collection of EAEC strains (Table 3) [12].
The collection was comprised of strains belonging to
EAEC sequence types (STs) that are globally disseminated, most prominently ST10 and ST31 complexes and
included two ST complexes (ST10 and ST394) that are
predominantly recovered from individuals with diarrhoea [12]. Non-EAEC E. coli strains that were used as
negative controls were E. coli K-12 strain MG1655,
enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strain EDL933
(ATCC 43895) [33], diffusely adherent E. coli strains DA
WC212-11 and DA H92-1, enteropathogenic E. coli
strains E2348/69 and B171-8 [34,35], uropathogenic
E. coli strain 536 [36], as well as Shigella flexneri 2a
strain 2457T [37]. E. coli K-12 strain DH5a (Sambrook
and Russell, 2001) was used as the host strain for clones.
Forty-six EAEC strains previously isolated from children with diarrhoea in Nigeria [26] as well as 90 other
non-EAEC isolates belonging to the enteropathogenic,
enterohaemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive/Shigella, diffusely adherent and uropathogenic E. coli categories, plus 85 isolates from related genera, were
employed to determine the distribution of loci found in
this study [18,26,38]. Strains were maintained by cryopreservation in Luria Bertani Broth (LB) with 15% v/v
glycerol at -70°C.
Routine molecular biology procedures

Standard molecular biology procedures were employed
[39]. Unless otherwise stated, DNA amplifications were
performed using 1 unit recombinant Taq polymerase
enzyme, 2 mM MgCl 2 , PCR buffer (Invitrogen) and
1 μM oligonucleotide primer in each reaction. All
amplifications began with a two minute hot start at 94°
C followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30 s,
annealing for 30 s at 5°C below primer annealing temperature and extending at 72°C for 1 minute for every
Kb of DNA. PCR reactions were templated with genomic DNA or boiled bacterial colonies. Where necessary,
Taq polymerase amplified products were TA-cloned
into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. They were then transformed into chemically competent E. coli K-12 DH5a
cells and selected on plates containing ampicillin
(100 μg/ml). Clones were verified by plasmid purification, restriction analysis and sequencing.
IS3-based PCR profiling

Insertion element 3 (IS3)-based PCR profiling was performed using the IS3A primer (5’-CACTTAGCCGCGTGTCC-3’) in the method described by
Thompson et al. [16]. Use of this primer alone in this
low-stringency protocol [16], rather than in conjunction
with IS3B, gave profiles of suitable discriminatory

strength, band intensity and resolution for evaluation
and excision. Twenty-two EAEC reference strains
belonging to 15 STs and including one untyped strain,
plus two diffusely-adherent E. coli and three E. coli
strains for which published genomic sequence is available were profiled. A 25 μl IS3 PCR reaction mixture
was prepared for each isolate in a 0.5 ml thin-walled
tube, using 200 ng (2 μl) of DNA and 23 μl of a PCR
master mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3),
50 mM KCl (1× PCR buffer, Invitrogen), a 400 μM concentration of each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP,
3 mM MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and primer IS3A at 6 μM. The amplification program consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C for
5 min; 50 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 35°C for 1 min, and
72°C for 2 min; and a final 7-min extension at 72°C.
The amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels [20 cm (W) × 25 cm
(L)] and were detected by ethidium bromide staining.
For control purposes, the selected strains were compared to non-EAEC strains. Bands that were reproducibly common to several EAEC, but absent in non-EAEC
controls were cloned and sequenced. Bands present in
the controls but absent in EAEC were also sought.
Other bands were selected because they were present or
absent in specific EAEC phylogenetic groups. Bands of
interest were excised and extracted using the QIAquick
gel extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into the TA vector
pGEM-T and sequenced.
Sequence analyses

FASTA-formatted sequences, with vector sequence
removed, were analysed by BLAST-N (nucleotidenucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST [40]). Flanking genetic
sequence was retrieved from coliBASE at http://xbase.
bham.ac.uk/colibase/ and genomic islands were also
mapped and compared at this site using the integrated
Artemis and Artemis Comparison Tool [41,42].
Phylogenetic inferences about ancestral allelic MLST
profiles and strain interrelatedness were made using
eBURST version 3 http://eburst.mlst.net/ and ClonalFrame version 1.1 http://www.xavierdidelot.xtreemhost.
com/clonalframe.htm [43,44]. Clonal complexes were
defined using eBURST based on groups sharing six
identical alleles and bootstrapping with 1000 samplings.
Relationships among different sequence type complexes
were inferred using ClonalFrame [44], a Bayesian
method of constructing evolutionary histories that takes
both mutation and recombination into account. For
each analysis, four independent runs of the Markov
chain were employed. ClonalFrame was used to compare
independent runs by the method of Gelman and Rubin

Page 8 of 10

[45]. Calculated Gelman-Rubin statistics for all parameters were below 1.20, indicating satisfactory convergence between tree replicates. A 75% consensus tree
was created for the EAEC isolates.
DNA hybridisation

The EDL933 orfz2240 equivalent (part of orf1600) was
amplified from EAEC strain 042 using primers 2240f
(5’-CCATCTCCAGCAATTTTTGTG-3’) and 2240r
(5’-GCGCTTCCAGATTAACCATGAA-3’). The resulting 545 bp product was cloned into pGEM-T to produce plasmid pLRM3. The 2240 DNA probe was
excised from pLRM3 with the enzymes PstI and EcoRI.
The fragment probe was gel purified using a Qiagen
agarose gel extraction kit, then labelled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP using a random prime labelling kit
(Roche Diagnostics). Labelled DNA probe was used in
colony hybridisation reactions as described previously
[46]. Briefly, test and control strains were inoculated
into brain heart infusion broth and incubated in an
orbital shaker (150 rpm) incubator for 16-18 hours at
37°C. Broth cultures were then inoculated onto nylon
membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham) on the surface of
brain heart infusion agar and incubated for 4-6 hours at
37°C. Colonies were lysed and the DNA was bound to
the membrane by sequential treatment with sodium
hydroxide/SDS, Tris-HCl/EDTA, saline sodium citrate
solution and exposure of the membrane to ultraviolet
light [39]. Bound target DNA was detected by hybridisation with the digoxigenin-labelled DNA probe followed
by detection of the digoxigenin label by a monoclonal
phosphatise-conjugated secondary antibody and a colour
substrate for the enzyme. Reagents for immunological
detection were supplied by Roche Diagnostics and
detection of labelled DNA was performed in accordance
with their instructions.
