Abstract
Background: Details of the mechanisms and selection pressures that shape the emergence and
development of complex biological systems, such as the human immune system, are poorly
understood. A recent definition of a reference set of proteins essential for the human immunome,
combined with information about protein interaction networks for these proteins, facilitates
evolutionary study of this biological machinery.
Results: Here, we present a detailed study of the development of the immunome protein
interaction network during eight evolutionary steps from Bilateria ancestors to human. New nodes
show preferential attachment to high degree proteins. The efficiency of the immunome protein
interaction network increases during the evolutionary steps, whereas the vulnerability of the
network decreases.
Conclusion: Our results shed light on selective forces acting on the emergence of biological
networks. It is likely that the high efficiency and low vulnerability are intrinsic properties of many
biological networks, which arise from the effects of evolutionary processes yet to be uncovered.

Background
Evolutionary pressures shaping protein interaction networks are practically unexplored, although the importance of such studies has been recognized [1]. The earlier
studies addressing this question analyzed the conservation of network motives [2-5], or the rate of link dynamics
in interaction networks [6,7]. Although the importance of
different protein properties to the evolution rates of proteins has been questioned [8-10], proteins interacting
with multiple partners simultaneously have been shown
to have a slower pace of evolution [11]. Thus, the properties of interaction networks can be thought to influence
the evolution of organisms. More general knowledge
about the effectors shaping protein interaction networks

would give insights on several aspects of the formation of
complex biological systems.
For detailed analysis of the evolution of a protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network it is necessary to have knowledge about the emergence of all the proteins in the network and their interactions. Some investigations in this
line have been presented [12,13]. The problem is that the
steps which lead to the current situation cannot be directly
addressed. To be able to follow the development in biological systems, information about biological evolution
should be applied. One attempt in this direction was to
use so-called isotemporal categories to express the appearance of a gene or protein in organisms [14].

DNA and protein sequences hold their past in their structure, which can be reconstructed with the standard tools
of phylogenetics. Here we performed to our knowledge
the first PPI network analysis utilizing phylogenetic information. One of the reasons for the lack of this kind of
study is the problem of obtaining accurate and validated
data for a system that covers the biological network, its
gene and protein constituents and their evolutionary history and homologs. We have collected such data for the
human immune system.
The human immune system, which is one of the most
complex biological machineries, has been widely investigated at the molecular, cellular and organ level in its normal state and during disease. It is a very complex system
built up from several different tissues, cell types, molecules and processes. The evolutionary history of the
human immune system is widely studied (see e.g. [15]),
but we still need new data to complete the picture.
The Essential Human Immunome is a reference collection
of genes and proteins involved in human immunity
which is distributed in the Immunome database [16,17].
Evolutionary data for all these proteins is collected in the
ImmTree database [18]. Experimentally verified proteinprotein interaction data for the immunome proteins was
collected from the Human Protein Reference Database
(HPRD) [19] and used to reconstruct the protein interaction network.
Recently, several studies have been published about natural networks [20], ranging from social interactions [21,22]
via protein-protein interactions [23,24] to the spreading
of epidemics [25] as well as human made networks like
telecommunication networks [26,27] and the Internet
[28,29]. It was initially surprising that the different networks share several common characteristics, which suggests common organizing principles for their emergence
[30].

Preferential attachment [31-33] suggests that a new protein is more likely to be connected to a highly connected
protein than to a protein with fewer interactions. Networks built up according to this principle, have been
shown to have scale free characteristics [34,35]. Scale free
networks have been detected from several different
sources, but thus far it has been very rare to observe the
preferential attachment rule at work, especially in the case
of protein interaction networks [36,37].
The evolution and development of networks has been
widely studied [38,39]. Many earlier reports on the evolution of protein interaction networks have focused on yeast
high throughput datasets [14,40,41]. Evolutionary comparisons have been limited to a few reference genomes.
The new dataset on the human immunome [16] related
proteins and their evolution allowed us to assign evolutionary levels to the proteins [18]. These levels can be
interpreted as indicating the steps of emergence of proteins. Reliable protein interaction data can be assigned
from HPRD, which contains experimentally verified interactions from literature [19]. We studied the emergence of
the immunome PPI network and elucidated which of the
network parameters are shaped by evolutionary pressures
and how these parameters have changed during time.

Results and discussion
The evolution of the immunome network was investigated by combining information about genes and proteins forming the immunome. 847 essential genes and
proteins were identified by text and bioinformatic data
mining as related to the human immune system [16]. The
evolutionary history and relationships of the immunome
proteins were obtained from ImmTree [18], which contains information on the orthologs for each protein. An
evolutionary level was assigned for each protein. The level
denotes when the protein emerged during evolution. The
levels are presented in Table 1. The third essential component, the PPIs, came from the Human Protein Reference

family members, and the TNF receptor-associated factors
(TRAFs) (see Additional file 1).

Further, interactions for low level subnetworks, levels 6–
9, were collected for Drosophila melanogaster [42,43] and
Caenorhabditis elegans [42]. This was done to reconstruct
early interactions between immunome proteins which
might have been lost during the evolutionary processes.
Only 13 new interactions were identified in these subnetworks and thus they did not affect the overall trends. It
would have been beneficial to have PPI data for model
organisms on all the 10 evolutionary levels. This is not
currently possible due to lacking proteome wide PPI networks.

For further analysis, subnetworks were created for eight
evolutionary levels. Levels 8 and 9 were excluded from the
analysis because these levels contain only a few proteins
and interactions. All subnetworks contain the nodes from
the examined and earlier levels, and the interactions
between them (Table 1, Fig 1, Additional file 2). They thus
represent the interaction network that existed at different
steps during evolution. The lowest, level 7, subnetwork is
small, with 112 proteins and 133 interactions which
existed in the ancestors of Homo sapiens when the taxon
Bilateria was formed. In each evolutionary step the
number of proteins and the interactions between them
grows substantially. The degree distribution of the subnetworks follows power law distribution with the power law
exponent between 2 and 3 (Fig 2.). The log-likelihood
ratio (-2logΛ), which marks the likelihood of the power
law degree distribution of the dataset, is much higher in
the higher level networks (Table 1).

For the analysis, we made some assumptions. We used
PPIs identified in the human proteome, and assumed that
if two proteins which interact in human, they also interact
in any organism in which the two proteins coexist. We
also assumed that this interaction existed during the evolution since both of the proteins emerged in a linage. The
model is a simplification of all possible cases. This
assumption is also in use in interaction predictions
[44,45], and although not exclusive, it is still true for the
majority of interactions. Our results for interactions in
fruitfly and worm confirm this idea, because hardly no
new interactions were found in these low level subnetworks. The model simplifies the evolution of the entire
interaction network to the evolution of its nodes. This is
necessary since we do not have a method to track the evolutionary past of interactions, while the phylogenetic
analysis of the proteins has well established and accepted
procedures.
The human immunome PPI network contains 1349 interactions for 584 proteins (Table 1). Since the network
includes only experimentally proven interactions from
the HPRD database, we can assume it represents a real,
albeit incomplete, network model of protein interactions
in the human immune system. Not all the immunome
proteins are included because the data is not complete
and does not cover all proteins in all cell types and conditions.
Of the investigated proteins, protein-tyrosine kinase FYN
has the highest number of interactions. The subnetwork
of FYN and its first neighborhood includes 47 proteins
and 93 interactions, which account for about 8% of all the
immunome nodes and 6.9% of interactions. Another Srcfamily member, lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine
kinase (LCK), is the second most linked protein with 37
interactions. 64 of the 584 proteins have more than 10
interactions. Many of these are mediators of signal transduction pathways, for example the Janus kinases (JAKs),
the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)

When analyzing the relationship between the evolutionary levels and the degrees (the number of interactions of
the proteins) we expected proteins which appeared early
on to have more interactions [37], and thus nodes with
higher evolutionary levels should have higher degrees.
However, a simple comparison of node level numbers
and their degree in the level 0 network does not show this
phenomenon (Fig 3). When we tested whether the new
nodes introduced in evolutionary steps tend to attach to
nodes with higher numbers of connections, a statistically
significant preferential attachment is clear (Fig 4). We
compared the degree distribution of all the nodes and of
those nodes which get new connections in the next evolutionary level. The nodes with new connections have
higher degrees in each step. This implies that when a new
node is introduced into the immunome network, it most
likely attaches to a node with a higher degree, so there is a
bias toward attachment to higher degree nodes.
We used scale free models although the immunome protein interaction network, like other PPI networks, does
not contain enough nodes to fulfill the statistical criteria
for scale freeness. Therefore we mostly used general
descriptive measures of networks, like efficiency, and
avoided in our conclusions the scale free network specific
aspects.
An important feature of the scale free protein interaction
networks is that highly connected nodes tend to be essential and therefore more conserved [40,46]. We used the
average entropy [47] of the proteins to measure how conserved, and thus how essential they are. Entropy was used
to measure the variability of the sites in a multiple protein

sequence alignment instead of comparing a human
sequence to an ortholog in a reference genome. We thus
take variability into account from many sequences instead
of a sequence pair. Proteins with high connectivity never
have high entropy; yet on the other hand, some of the proteins with just a few connections have very high average
entropy, which means that they are not conserved (Fig 5).
We detect this phenomenon on all the evolutionary levels.
These levels also contain enough nodes to allow binning

of the data (Fig 6). More conserved proteins are more connected during the evolution of the immunome protein
interaction network.
We further studied the effects on several network characteristics during the evolution of the network to find out
what kind of selective forces affect its development. Global efficiency quantifies the efficiency of the network in
sending information between nodes [48]. According to

earlier studies, the efficiency of a scale free network is
expected to decrease when the size of the network is growing [36,48]. Surprisingly, the efficiency of the immunome
network grows through the evolutionary steps, from an
initial value of around 0.24 to a final value of around 0.41
although the number of nodes and edges is also growing
(Fig 7A). This means that despite the number of nodes
increasing from 112 to 584, the average number of steps
necessary to reach one random node from another
decreases. Since this is against the expected behavior (Fig
7A), we assume that a selection pressure exists which
shapes the immunome PPI networks to became more efficient during evolution.
The critical components of a network can be searched by
looking for the most vulnerable nodes [49]. Vulnerability
is defined as the drop in efficiency when a node and all its
edges are removed from the network. The maximal value
of the vulnerability is the overall vulnerability of the
whole network. The maximal vulnerability of the immunome network constantly decreases during the evolutionary steps from the initial value of 0.28 (Fig 7B). At the
level of Homo sapiens (level 0) the value is 0.003, which
means that maximal drop in the efficiency of the network
is 0.3% if one of the nodes is deleted from the network.
Scale free networks are known to be tolerant of errors in

Conclusion
Our findings of the increasing efficiency and the decreasing vulnerability of the evolving network also raise new
aspects in evolution. Apparently, it is advantageous for an
interaction network to become more efficient and less vulnerable to random errors. More robust networks can possibly increase the fitness of the organism. It is likely that
similar behavior will be found from some other biological, and possibly other types, of networks. Our analysis
revealed new concepts for evolutionary biology, as well as
new insights on the emergence of scale free networks.
Large scale experimental studies are needed to test and
verify the observed network properties and their effect
during evolution.

Methods
Reconstructing the human immunome related proteinprotein interaction network
Human immune system related proteins were collected
from the Immunome database, which is a reference set for
the human immune system composed by a combination
of literature analysis and data mining [16]. Protein interactions were associated with the immunome proteins
according to the Human Protein Reference Database
(HPRD) [19]. Since only interactions between the immu-

newly formed interactions, is on the upper half. P values for the Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test are shown on the plots. Nodes

were added, but proteins without interactions were eliminated from the dataset. The final network contains 584

nodes out of the 847 original ones, forming altogether
1349 interactions. Interactions which appeared more than
once were simplified to single edges.

Conservation is measured by the average entropy of the proteins. Data points are binned so that a minimum of 6 points
are in each degree interval. The conclusion, that proteins
with high connectivity never have high entropy, does not
depend on the binning. The notation [11,14) means a bin for
degree values 11, 12 and 13.

Generating subnetworks at ten levels of evolution
Evolutionary information was assigned to all the proteins
of the network. The data was taken from the ImmTree
database [18] which represents ten evolutionary emergence levels from Eukaryota (level 9) to Homo sapiens
(level 0) (Table 1) [16]. The numbers are the unified evolutionary levels from the database. The emergence levels
were defined by analysis of the orthologs of each protein,
and they represent the earliest common ancestor of species where orthologs of a protein can be identified. For
example in the case of the FYN gene for protein-tyrosine
kinase fyn, the ortholog from the largest evolutionary distance according to the ImmTree database is C. elegans,
therefore we assume that this gene was already present in
the ancestor of the whole Bilateria group, so we assign
level number 7 for this gene.

Subnetworks for all ten levels were generated with the
program Cytoscape [50] so that all the nodes and the corresponding edges, which emerged later than the present
level, were eliminated from the interaction network. Thus,
network level 0 is equivalent to the original protein-protein interaction network; whereas networks with higher

PPI interactions for D. melanogaster and C. elegans
Experimentally derived data for low level PPI subnetworks
in fruitfly and worm was acquired from the IntAct [42]
and PIMRider [43] databases, respectively. Orthologs of
human immunome proteins were identified in these
genomes using data from the ImmTree database. Then,
interactions between the immunome ortholog proteins
were identified from the datasets and included to the low
level networks. Interactions in the fruitfly data were introduced to the Coelomata ancestor's subnetwork (level 6)
and worm data to the Bilateria ancestor's subnetwork
(level 7). There were 132 immunome ortholog proteins
identified in fruitfly and 27 in worm. The interaction datasets contained 13 new interactions between these proteins. These interactions were analysed similar to the
human PPI network derived data. Thus, interactions were
maintained in the earlier subnetworks only if both the
interacting proteins were present on that level.
Degree distribution of the subnetworks
Power law distribution was fitted to the distribution of
degrees in all subnetworks. The power law exponent (α)
was estimated with its standard error by maximum likelihood method.
Average entropy of the proteins
Multiple protein sequence alignments were downloaded
from the ImmTree database for each protein with an evolutionary level number higher than 0. Entropy values were
calculated for each site of the alignments [47] as follows:
6

s=−

∑ p ln(p ),
i

i

i =1

where pi is the frequency of residues from class i at the
position. The following six classes of amino acids were
used: aliphatic (A, V, L, I, M, C), aromatic (F, W, Y, H),
polar (S, T, N, Q), basic (K, R), acidic (D, E) and special
conformation (G, P). The arithmetic mean of the entropy
was calculated for those sites, where at least 50%+1 of the
sequences was present in order to avoid the overestimation of conservation caused by long unique sequence
parts in the alignment, which usually appear at the ends
of the alignment.
Efficiency of the network
Global efficiency quantifies the efficiency of the network
in sending information between nodes, assuming that the
efficiency for sending information between two chosen

If we assume that the subnetworks have power law degree

path length is better estimated like L ~ ln N. Since our network models are small, a second curve for the expected
efficiency was calculated as:

where E is the global efficiency of the network while Ei is
the global efficiency of the network without the node i
and all of its interactions. The overall vulnerability of the
network is the value of the most vulnerable node, i.e. the
largest loss in performance when a node is deleted from
the network. The smaller the value for vulnerability the
more stable the network is against random node removal.
