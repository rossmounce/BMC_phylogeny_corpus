Abstract
Background: Dengue Fever is one of the most important viral re-emergent diseases affecting about 50 million
people around the world especially in tropical and sub-tropical countries. In Colombia, the virus was first detected
in the earliest 70′s when the disease became a major public health concern. Since then, all four serotypes of the
virus have been reported. Although most of the huge outbreaks reported in this country have involved dengue
virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), there are not studies about its origin, genetic diversity and distribution.
Results: We used 224 bp corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of envelope (E) gene from 74 Colombian isolates
in order to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and to estimate time divergences. Analyzed DENV-1 Colombian
isolates belonged to the formerly defined genotype V. Only one virus isolate was clasified in the genotype I, likely
representing a sole introduction that did not spread. The oldest strains were closely related to those detected for
the first time in America in 1977 from the Caribbean and were detected for two years until their disappearance
about six years later. Around 1987, a split up generated 2 lineages that have been evolving separately, although
not major aminoacid changes in the analyzed region were found.
Conclusion: DENV-1 has been circulating since 1978 in Colombia. Yet, the phylogenetic relationships between
strains isolated along the covered period of time suggests that viral strains detected in some years, although
belonging to the same genotype V, have different recent origins corresponding to multiple re-introduction events
of viral strains that were circulating in neighbor countries. Viral strains used in the present study did not form a
monophyletic group, which is evidence of a polyphyletic origin. We report the rapid spread patterns and high
evolution rate of the different DENV-1 lineages.

Background
Dengue virus infection has been an important impact on
humans over the last several years, with an estimated 50
million dengue infections and an average of 1 million
cases reported annually in more than 100 countries in
tropical and subtropical regions [1-5]. This mosquitoborne flavivirus causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, which include an acute self-limited
flu-like illness known as dengue fever (DF). DF is characterized by headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital
pain and sometimes maculopapular rash. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe illness documented
by haemoconcentration (haematocrit increase by 20%)

and evidence of plasma leakage such as pleural effusion
and ascites as the major pathophysiological features. In
some patients, DHF may progress to hypovolemic shock
(Dengue Shock Syndrome, DSS) with circulatory failure
[2,6-8].
Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped virus with a
positive sense ssRNA of about 11 kb coding a single open
reading frame for three structural proteins, core (C), premembrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E), and
seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3,
NS4a, NS4b, NS5). Based on serological analysis, DENV
can be differentiated as four distinct serotypes (DENV-1,
DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4), each one with the
capacity to infect and cause even the more severe manifestation, although some serotypes have been isolated
more frequently in DHF epidemics. On the other hand,
evolution studies and molecular epidemiology using

nucleotide sequences from the DENV genome have
demonstrated the occurrence of genotype clades within
each serotype [9-28]. For this reason, genetic characterization of DENV has become a critical issue for understanding epidemic patterns of viral spread. At the same
time, the important role of DENV itself in disease severity has also been proposed rather than the immune
enhancement developed after subsequent infection with
heterologous serotypes [1,7,29]. The increase in virus
transmission over the last 50 years has possibly increased
its adaptive potential. In addition, host factors such as
the age, race, presence of non-neutralazing cross-reactive
antibodies and possibly chronic diseases could act as
selective pressures, resulting in more virulent genotypes
that may be associated with DHF/DSS [9,17,29-34].
Four DENV serotypes have been involved in Colombian epidemics, although DENV-1 and DENV-2 have
the higher circulation rate since 1971[5,6,21]. Moreover,
since the first case of DHF in Colombia at the end of
1989, these two serotypes have been associated with
severe disease. To date, DENV-1 falls into five clades
designated as genotype I (Southeast Asia, China and
East Africa), genotype II (Thailand), genotype III
(Malaysia), genotype IV (South Pacific) and genotype V
(America, Africa). Additionally, the existence of lineages
with distinctive geographical and temporal relationships
had been suggested [12,20,26,28,35-38]. Due to the
importance of DENV in public health, the particular
goals of this research were to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of DENV-1 and to date the phylogenetic
tree using isolation time as calibration points to establish date of introduction of virus and rate evolution
patterns of virus in Colombia.

Results
Virus recovery and confirmation

Seventy four viruses obtained from symptomatic
patients were isolated in mosquito cell culture and subsequently identified as DENV-1 serotype by monoclonal
antibodies and confirmed by RT-PCR methods. From
the 74 samples, it was not possible to obtain the exact
geographic origin of 10 samples. The remaining 64 isolates are listed in Table 1 indicating locality, isolation
year, accession number and genotype.
Phylogenetic reconstruction of DENV-1

Sequences from the carboxyl terminus of the envelope
(E) gene from the 74 Colombian DENV-1 isolates were
aligned in CLUSTAL W [39,40] and compared with 52
previously reported sequences elsewhere, resulting in a
trivial alignment as long as there were no indels in the
sequences alignment. The Maximum Likelihood analysis
comparing 126 sequences is presented in figure 1.

Previously reported genotypes were represented in the
tree and placed most of the Colombian isolates nesting
in the genotype V clade (America, Africa) and were
closely related to Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay virus
strains. Nevertheless, the oldest sequences
DENV-1/CO/261_Atlantico/1978, DENV-1/CO/
263_Choco/1979 and DENV-1/CO/150_Choco/1979
were slightly distant from the remaining strains and
appeared in close proximity to some Caribbean Island
and other American isolates (Trinidad, French Guinea).
Interestingly, the isolate DENV-1/CO/267_Valle/1983
appeared in a different clade, as the sister branch of
Japan (DENV-1/JP/Mochizuki/1943), China (DENV-1/
CN/GZ-80/1980), Ethiopia (DENV-1/DJ/Ethiopia/1998)
and Cambodia (DENV-1/KH/1998) strains, which have
been defined as lineages of the genotype I [26]. To allow
a better resolution of the tree, we performed a phylogenetic reconstruction using only the Colombian isolates.
Again, the oldest isolates were more divergent representing the first entrance of virus in Colombia. Although
the genotype V was the only represented in the tree, two
different lineages may be defined based on cladal distribution (figure 2).
Molecular clock

We used a Bayesian inference based on MCMC to
reconstruct Colombian DENV 1 coalescent history.
BEAST allowed the use of isolation year as calibrating
point to estimate divergence time and then generated
a posterior probability (PP) distribution of trees
instead of a bootstrap value [41-44]. The resulting tree
clearly placed the genotypes of DENV-1 already circulating globally before the first appearance of this serotype in the Americas between 1970 and 1980
(figure 3). According to the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) beneath the strict clock model, the estimated root for this phylogeny was 1929 and the
substitution rate was 8.58 × 10-4 substitutions per site,
per year. To increase resolution, we use the strict
molecular clock model to reconstruct Colombian isolates (figure 4). Under the assumption of a constant
substitution rate, the estimated root indicates 1945 as
the date of the more recent common ancestor. In
addition, there was a split up around 1987 between
DENV-1/CO/188_Guaviare/1987 isolates and the
remaining strains (PP = 0,82). As the time goes by, we
can see a sustained increase in number of isolates and
a rapid spread of viruses, which included few changes
among them as seen with the branch lengths. By the
year 1992 (approximately), another remarkable partition event occurred to generate 2 well defined clades
(PP = 0,77 and 1), evolving independently since the
early 90′s until recent time.

Discussion
Emerging and re-emerging diseases have become a public health major concern in developing countries, where
dengue is perhaps the most important vector-borne viral
disease in terms of morbidity. In Colombia, DF and
DHF had been associated to the four DENV serotypes
with DENV-2 and DENV-1 predominating since 1971
after the re-appearance and spread of Aedes (Stegomyia)
aegipty [6]. DENV-3 circulated for a short time in 1975
and then it was not detected until 2002 when re-introduction occurred probably from Venezuela [27]. DENV4 has been detected sporadically every year since 1984,
when it was involved in several DF cases.
The huge genetic diversity of DENV has been vastly
documented, starting perhaps with the Rico-Hesse proposal of different “genotypes” comprising serotypes 1
and 2 [10], following by several studies and genotype
definition of DENV-3 and DENV-4. In this way, five different genotypes has been previously defined for DENV1 (genotypes I to V) suggesting a significant genetic variation. In fact, various lineages had been proposed based
on time-spatial clustering and clade distribution
[26,28,35-38]. In the present study, 74 Colombian
DENV-1 sequences were analyzed to try to reconstruct
the phylogenetic history of the virus in this country. Different genome regions have been used to infer DENV
phylogeny including those with short fragments
[10,27,28]. Here we employed a sequence from the carboxi terminal of the envelope (E) protein which has
demonstrated to provide a useful phylogenetic signal to
define genotype clustering [26]. It is important to note
that the better resolution of evolutionary patterns
should be obtained from complete genomes. However, it
was not possible to obtain largest fragments from the
oldest isolates, probably because of RNA degradation

across the time. As expected, all strains were clustered
with those from Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and different Caribbean Islands, corresponding to the formerly
named genotype V (America/Africa), showing a well
supported clade clearly separated from the others genotypes. Colombian strains DENV-1/CO/261_Atlantico/
1978, DENV-1/CO/263_Choco/1979 and DENV-1/CO/
150_Choco/1979, were separated from the remaining
isolates and appeared closer to those from the Caribbean islands, which represent the entrance of serotype 1
into the Americas. It was reported for the first time in
1977 in Jamaica and rapidly spreading to the Antilles
including Cuba, Antigua & Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas,
Barbados, Curaçao, Dominica, Grenada, Guadaloupe,
Guyana, Haiti, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, St.
Kitts, St. Martin, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad, Turks and Caicos, and the Virgin Islands [5]. In
1978, DENV-1 was implicated in large mainland outbreaks perhaps occurring at the same time in Colombia,
Venezuela, Surinam, French Guyana, and eventually
Centro America and Mexico. In Colombia, DENV-1 was
isolated between 1977 and 1978, so the strain DENV-1/
CO/261_Atlantico/1978 represents perhaps the first
virus entrance to the country. It rapidly spread until the
next isolation in Choco (DENV-1/CO/263_Choco/1979
and DENV-1/CO/150_Choco/1979) and then it fades
away (or at less it was not reported) probably displaced
by DENV-2 (maintaining DENV-1 in a silent low circulation) until 1985 when it established in different localities. It is important to note that even with the mobility
between countries and increasing opportunity of viral
introduction, only one DENV-1 genotype is circulating
in America, different to DENV-2 and DENV-3 of which
at least 2 genotypes has been detected (America/Asia
genotypes and I/III genotypes respectively) suggesting

perhaps, dissimilar patterns of viral spread and transmission between DENV genotypes and even different adaptation capacity.
Many researchers have categorized DENV in non official taxonomic levels beneath genotype, based specially
in cladal distribution or geographical clustering. Circulation of these “lineages” has been particularly defined for
DENV-1 in India, where at least 4 different lineages had
been proposed (India-1 close to American strains, India2 related to Singapore 1993 isolate, India-3 in south
India and India-4 from Delhi and Gwalior) [26,28]. In
our study, a remarkable cladogenesis event occurs
around 1992 according to the molecular clock, generating two well supported clades corresponding to putative
Colombian DENV-1 lineages. Despite the eco-epidemiology similarities between Colombia and neighbor
countries were dengue is a major concern, lineages have
not been previously demonstrated for DENV-1. In fact,

according to ML phylogeny, most of the American
strains (Argentina and Brazil) correspond to the lineage1, leaving the lineage 2 restricted to Colombia. Although
geographic distribution of these lineages is not clearly
delimitated, it is evident that they are evolving independently and most likely in parallel at the same localities.
Despite the emergence and rapid diversification of
DENV has been a matter of special concern, precise
mechanisms of evolution remain unclear [45-50]. It is a
fact that human RNA viruses including Influenza, HIV,
Coronavirus, etc., have particularly increased mutation
and evolution rates mostly because of the lack of proofreading activity of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase
[51,52]. Nevertheless, arthropod-borne viruses (Arboviruses) have demonstrated slower mutation rates comparing with those infecting directly human host,
probably because of the trade-off effect occurring when
the virus is obligated to adapt alternatively into the

DENV [51] demonstrating that fitness improves when
virus specialize in a single cell line but decreases in
virus undergoing alternative passages in different cells.
In view of that, over all DENV mutation rates have been
previously inferred, ranging from 4.55 × 10-4 (DENV-1)
to 9.01 × 10-4 (DENV-3) [19]. In the present study, we
found a mutation rate of 8.58 × 10-4 substitutions per
site, per year, suggesting faster evolution rates for
Colombian strains, perhaps because of the high transmition occurrence especially in hyperendemic areas, where
virus replicates in several human hosts, reducing the
constraining effect occurred in the vector. However, this
high mutation rate does not necessarily reflect a fitness
advantage or a successful adaptation process. Actually,
positive selection for DENV seems to be serotype/genotype dependent and even more, protein specific. In fact,
envelope (E) protein apparently exhibits some adaptation evidence in DENV-3, DENV-4 and various DENV-2
genotypes, but not for DENV-1, strongly suggesting a
purifying selection pressure, at least over this gene.
Nevertheless, further studies have to be done to try to
understand the adaptation process in DENV.
On the other hand, although mostly of Colombian
strains belong to the genotype V, there is an isolate,
DENV-1/CO/267_Valle/1983 placed into genotype I
near to Asia, China and East Africa strains. The ML
tree show this strain close to DENV-1/JP/Mochizuki/
1943, a strain considered extinct. Since we do not have
this virus as reference in our laboratory, we can discard
cross contamination during the assay. Moreover, the
presence of this virus could be explained based on the
migration process occurred from Asia to America, officially starting to Colombia by 1929, and sustained until
the mid XX century [53]. Thus, establishment of Asian
colonies increased visitors and perhaps favored the
entrance of viral strains. We can speculate that those
viruses did not fit to the new environment and the
adaptation events were constrained because of the selective pressures including different vectors and human
immune response.
According to natural history of DENV, evolution
events could bring new genetic variants and eventually
increase the severity of disease. Although pathogenic
markers remain unclear, hemorrhagic features on some
Asian DENV-2 genotypes have been demonstrated and
Asian derived DENV-3 genotypes associated to dengue
fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported
in Brazil [25]. Moreover, changes in clinical manifestation of disease (atypical dengue) such as viscerotropism
or encephalitis may respond to the circulation of new
DENV lineages with increased pathogenic potential.

Consequently, epidemiological programs should include
not just virological diagnosis but genotype surveillance
too.

Conclusion
This study shows in a defined time-scale, not just the
first entrance of DENV 1 in Colombia, but also the viral
evolution process in a highly endemic area. As a major
conclusion, only one genotype of DENV 1 has been circulating since the first epidemic reports in the continental area. Nevertheless, two different lineages have been
evolving fast since the earliest 90′s according to molecular clock. As these evolution events may derive in a
marked pathogenic potential, surveillance programs
should include molecular methodologies. In fact, unusual presentation of disease currently reported by local
health care institutions may be correlated to this evolution process. Further analyses by using at least complete
E gene should be done to corroborate our results.
Methods
Virus strains

DENV-1 strains used in this study were obtained from
the virus collection of the National Health Institute
(INS, Virology Lab, Bogotá, Colombia), and comprise 74
isolates from outbreaks, epidemics and routine epidemiological surveillance. Clinical samples were collected
between 1978 and 2007 from different localities all
around the country, so they represent most viruses circulating in Colombia during the last 30 years (Table 1).
All viral stocks were inoculated on C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells growing in Eagle’s minimal essential medium
(E-MEM) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FSC).
After 10 days of incubation at 28°C, monolayer was disrupted and supernatant was then recovered by centrifugation and stored at -80°C until use. The remained cells
were washed with Phosfate Buffer Saline (PBS) and
dripped on slides; after fixed in cold acetone, slides were
incubated with monoclonal antibodies (anti-DENV-1 to
anti-DENV-4, kindly donated by CDC, Puerto Rico) for
one hour, washed with PBS and incubated again with a
fluorescent conjugated antibody. Additionally, DENV-1
serotype confirmation was done by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers [54].
Viral RNA extraction, RT-PCR and sequencing

Cell culture supernatants were used to extract viral RNA
using QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, Germany)
following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 140 μl of
each supernatant was placed into 560 μl of AVL buffer
with 5.6 μl of carrier RNA and mixed with ethanol (96100%) before passed through a column by centrifugation.
After washing with buffers AW1 and AW2 RNA was

Mendez et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:226
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/226

finally eluted with 60 μl of AVE buffer and stored at -80°
C until use. Five microliters from each RNA extraction
were used as template in a one step RT-PCR reaction
(Qiagen, One-Step RT-PCR kit) as previously described
[55]. Primers used [DEN1S1871 (5′-TGGCTGAGACCCARCATGGNAC-3′) and DEN1AS2622 (5′-CAATTCATTTGATATTTGYTTCCAC-3′)] were designated to
amplify 751 bp from de joining region E/NS1. Reactions
were evaluated in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidum
bromide and reactions observed as negative were then
subjected to nested PCR as follow: 1 μl of initial RT-PCR
product, 1 × buffer B (60 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 2 mM
MgCl 2 , 15 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ), 40 pmol of each primer
[DEN1S2133 (5′-GGAAAATGTTYGAAGCAACYG
CCC-3′), DEN1AS2553 (5′-TCCTCCCATGCCTTCCCRATGG-3′)] and 2.5 U of Taq DNA Polimerase (Invotrogene) in a final volume of 50 μl. PCR reactions were
first denaturated at 94°C (2 minutes) and then subjected
to 40 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 seconds), primer
annealing (57°C, 4 minutes), primer extension (72°C, 30
seconds) and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 minutes.
Nested PCR was evaluated in 1% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide.
Amplified products (from RT-PCR or nested PCR)
were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(QIAGEN, Germany) and then used as template for
sequencing reactions using the ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was carried
out on both strands with 10 pmol of primers used for
nested PCR, and the products were analyzed using an
ABI model 377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Overlapping sequences for each sample
obtained from sense and antisense primers were combined to obtain a consensus sequence using the SeqMan module of Lasergene (DNASTAR Inc. Software,
Madison, Wis.). A total of 224 bp [corresponding to
carboxyl terminus of envelope (E) gene] from 74 new
sequences were compared with 52 previously
sequenced strains from all over the world, available in
GenBank. Consensus sequences were aligned using the
program CLUSTAL W included in MEGA package
version 4.0 [35,36].
Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the Maximum
Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods
incorporated in the PAUP* 4.0 program [56]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using the best model
of nucleotide substitution based on Modeltest [57] (analyses are available upon request). Statistical significance
of tree topology was assessed with a bootstrap with
1000 replicates. Obtained trees were visualized using the
Tree View Program [58].

Substitution rates and molecular clock

In addition, estimated rate of evolutionary change (nucleotide substitutions per site per year) and tree root age was
obtained with the program BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary
Analysis by Sampling Trees)[41], which uses Bayesian
Markov Chain Montecarlo (MCMC) algorithms combined
with the chosen model and prior knowledge of sequence
data to infer the posterior probability distribution of
phylogenies [41-44]. We analyze the data using the year of
isolation as calibration points to estimate divergence time
in years. In order to avoid duplicates, sequences identical
to other on the dataset were removed. Rate variation
among branches was inferred under the strict molecular
clock model, whereas substitution rate among sites was
calculated with the General Time-Reversible model (GTR)
combined with the gamma parameter and proportion of
invariant sites (GTR+Γ+I ) model. MCMC was run for
10,000,000 steps and sampled every 500 steps and the
10,000 first steps of each run were discarded. BEAST format files were obtained in the provided BEAUti graphical
interface and the generated trees were visualized with the
FigTree 1.2.2. program. Finally, statistical analysis was carried out in the Tracer package [41].
