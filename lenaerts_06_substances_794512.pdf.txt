Abstract
Indigenous Amazonian ethnomedicine usually relies on numerous forms of healing, exercised by
both specialists and non-specialists. Such is the case among the "Asheninka del Ucayali" (Arawak
from the Peru-Brazil border). This paper attempts to elicit the underlying consistencies of their
manifold, often contradictory practices and statements.
It draws on ethnographic data gathered between 1997 and 2000, and is essentially based on my
own interviews and participant observation. Concerning some specific points these data are also
compared with ethnobotanical findings, to highlight significant peculiarities of the Asheninka
approach.
The first question is about the nature of a "good medicine". When the Asheninka borrow botanical
knowledge from another ethnic group and comment the fact, the contrast between indigenous selfassessments and objective ethnobotanical measurements points out a crucial difference: While the
Western approach focuses essentially on chemical effectiveness of the plants themselves,
Asheninka people pay much more attention to relational aspects.
The relational dimension also involves the plants themselves, as a sort of person. The point has
implications in Asheninka shamanism and herbalism. A shaman does not necessarily need to be a
good botanist. His main concern is managing a network of personal relationships involving all kinds
of living beings. This network is supposed to be the mainspring of illness – a belief shared by both
shamans and ordinary people.
However, most ordinary people have detailed herbal knowledge. In fact, this everyday herbalism
amounts to an alternative explanatory model. Such a coexistence of two contrasting explanatory
systems is frequent in Amazonia. Among the Asheninka, nevertheless, the underlying hierarchy is
clear: the herbal, apparently more materialistic, approach is embedded in the shamanic, plainly
relational, model.

Background
Like many other Amazonian people, the "Ashéninka del
Ucayali" and "del Gran Pajonal" have a complex, detailed
ethnomedical knowledge. Different forms of healing are

performed by shamans, by steam bath specialists and by
most ordinary people. It results in a wide range of medicinal means and techniques, with important local and
individual variation. Various psychoactive drugs (tobacco,

ayahuasca, datura...) and countless medicinal plants are
used, for steam baths and divination, collective ayahuasca
ceremonies and individual ayahuasca healing sessions,
baths of leaves, plant compresses, plant juices used as eye
drops, tobacco and other specific plants used for juice spit,
blowing of tobacco smoke, little pieces of thorn or charcoal extracted from the patient's body...
Together or separately, similar practices are widespread
throughout Amazonia, but rather than comparative work,
my concern here is with the internal consistency of such a
variety, from an Ashéninka point of view.
At the moment, various researchers offer very stimulating
insights into the healing systems and medical concepts of
the closely related Matsigenka [1-3] and other indigenous
neighbours [4-6]. By contrast, the Ashéninka or
Asháninka ethnomedicine has never been addressed
addressed as a whole. Even partial studies on this topic are
very few and focus exclusively on Asháninka shamanism
[7,8] or pharmacology [9].
Ethnobotany and indigenous categories
These studies actually fit in with two traditional focuses of
interest in Amazonian ethnomedicine. The first one
addresses the shamans, their social role, symbolic thought
and publicly ritualized action, i.e. the most dramatic
aspects of healing [[10-15], among many others]. In Western Amazonia it often entails a particular attention paid to
the use and diffusion of ayahuasca, the main shamanic
hallucinogen in the region [16-20]. The second one
focuses on ethnomedicinal plants and pharmaceutical
properties, especially the mentioned ayahuasca, Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce) Norton, Malpighiaceae [21-23], and
other outstanding species [24-26].

My own concern is rather different. Facing the great variety
of everyday healing (which includes much more than just
shamanic practices) I aim to determine its underlying conceptual framework, according to the Ashéninka categories
of thought. The whole paper defends the proposition that
a prior condition for any medical anthropology in the
Ashéninka case is a thorough examination of Ashéninka
epistemology.
The first steps of the analysis are based on findings of our
interdisciplinary work. They substantiate that the
Ashéninka approach is inconsistent with Western categories, and calls for another analytic framework in the next
steps. This is the reason why I progressively abandon the
references to and comparison with ethnobotanical data,
after applying them to clarify the contrast between both
approaches.

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

The ontological backgrounds are different: There are
indigenous conceptions about bodies and "souls", material substances and interpersonal relationships, but these
categories do not have exactly the Western sense, and
most of all they are interconnected in a distinct, nonWestern way. I argue that the point is critical to both sides
of Ashéninka ethnomedicine, namely shamanism and
herbalism, and to their balance and interaction.
Herbal knowledge is widespread among most of the
Ashéninka people, but paradoxically it is also poorly valued in everyday comments. A typical illustration is the following example. I had broken my leg, and the Ashéninka
taught me to use a plant with amazing anti-inflammatory
effect (I give fuller particulars in the section "results"). I
repeatedly expressed my grateful admiration for such a
"good medicine", but the Ashéninka's comments on it
were greatly contrasting. Scornfully, they answered: "Everybody knows that plant, even the children".
Which is the real status of such herbal knowledge then?
Does it belong to a specialized, almost separate field of
Ashéninka ethnomedicine, as it may occur elsewhere in
Amazonia, among the Warao [27] or many Panoan
groups [28,29] for instance? Is there a sharing out between
a spirit dimension of healing, reserved to shamanism, and
a bodily one, reserved to the layman's herbalism, as
assumed in the common sense opinion?
I do not think so. I argue that Ashéninka herbalist
approach rather is a second-class, symptomatic treatment
of the same health issues, and is viewed as a mere alternative expression of the same processes, involving primarily
the highly transformable bodies of human people and
other living beings. To substantiate this point, the overall
context will be detailed first, and roundabouts through
shamanic practices and their ontological background will
be necessary: Ashéninka ethnomedicine is based on values and categories of thought quite different from ours,
and is to be addressed as a whole.
Ethnological background
The lack of bibliographical references on Ashéninka/
Asháninka ethnomedicine is a little surprising, considering the population size. The Ashéninka and Asháninka
together amounted to more than 51,000 people in 1993
[30]. They belong to the Arawakan ethno-linguistic group,
and dwell in the Peruvian "Selva Central", with some territorial extensions going across the Brazilian border [31].
Like many other Amazonian peoples, their economy is
based on slash-and-burn agriculture, hunting, fishing and
gathering – and nowadays, some additional commercial
crops and activities (coffee, red beans, timber...). I personally worked with two north-eastern sub-groups, known as
"Ashéninka del Ucayali" (above 3,500) and "Ashéninka

del Gran Pajonal" (almost 4,000), in the Peruvian Department of Ucayali and the Brazilian State of Acre.
Peruvian people usually deem the Ashéninka to be very
rebellious. Their history is strewn with many armed uprisings [32-35], and for a long time they fought quite successfully against repeated colonization attempts by the
Peruvian state, by the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries, and still before, by the Inca empire [36]. Even in
more peaceful situations, there is clear evidence of their
deep desire for autonomy and strong ethnic pride [37,38].
Some of their neighbours will be mentioned in this paper.
Besides the Ashéninka and Asháninka, the Sub-Andean
Arawak also include the already mentioned Matsigenka to
the South-East, the Amuesha-Yanesha to the West, and the
rather distinct Yine-Piro (who are ancient enemies) to the
East. Their traditional territories formed a solid block (see
the map in Figure 1).
Beyond, most of the indigenous neighbours belong to the
quite different Panoan ethno-linguistic group. All of them
were enemies of the Ashéninka, Asháninka and Matsigenka. They present nevertheless contrasting cultural features and history. On the one hand, the Conibo and
Shipibo also form a large indigenous group (more than
20,000 people in 1993 – see [30]), settled for centuries on
the great river banks [39]. Most of them still live along the
middle Ucayali, the main artery of the region, and some
of its tributaries, often near Peruvian settlements and cities. On the other hand, there is a set of small ethnic
groups, loosely related to each other. Traditionally, they
lived scattered in the headwaters regions. Those who will
be mentioned in this paper were successively drawn to
sedentary settlements in rather recent times, after an "isolation" of many ages in the forest: Permanent contact with
the Yaminahua (around 400 people in 1998) occurred in
the 60's [40-42], and with the Yora (around 230 people in
1999) in the 80's [1,43]; the sedentary settlement of the
Chitonahua (around 150 people?) began ten years ago
and is still in process [1,40,42].

Methods
The present case study draws on ethnographic research
carried out between 1997 and 2000. It is essentially
grounded on my own data and findings as an anthropologist. I stayed among the Ashéninka in seven villages from
Brazil and Peru, with special attention paid to knowledge
variation and to healing everyday practices and ceremonies.
The basic methods were participant observation and
open-ended interviews. In-depth semi-structured interviews were not carried out from the outset, in order to
limit self-induced answers and bias of the indigenous cat-

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

egories. Rather, they were used some later to gather additional data and crosscheck previous information and
provisional interpretations. I worked in this way with
most members of three villages (Alto Bonito, 43 people;
Dulce Gloria, around 250 people; Nueva Victoria, 95 people), and with many members of the others. Interviewees
were shamans as well as ordinary people reputed to be
either skilled or inexpert in ethnomedical issues. The large
variety of informants and direct observations demonstrated the great variability of healing practices among the
Ashéninka.
Nevertheless, my personal research formed part of a wider
programme granted by the European Commission and
entitled "TSEMIM" (Transmission et Transformation des
Savoirs sur l'Environnement en Milieux Indigènes et Métis).
Concerning some specific points, this paper also draws on
findings of the colleagues involved in this TSEMIM
research, in order to enlighten some significant peculiarities of the Ashéninka approach. Since this wider research
programme forms part of the background, I give some
particulars about its objectives and methods.
The purpose was to analyse the dynamics of change and
transfer of environmental knowledge among six neighbouring indigenous peoples, first within each ethnic
group (focusing on the chances of trans-generational
transmission), and further between all of them (focusing
on interethnic exchange and influences). These ethnic
groups were the Shipibo-Conibo, Amahuaca, YaminahuaChitonahua, Yora and Yawanawá (all of them Panoan),
and the Ashéninka (Arawakan).
The interdisciplinary teams included anthropologists,
botanists and ethnobotanists from Brazil, Peru, France
and Belgium. I use and quote in this paper the findings
and personal communications of the anthropologists
Frédérique Rama Leclerc (Shipibo-Conibo), Rodolfo
Tello Abanto (Yora), Miguel Carid Naveira and Laura
Pérez Gil (Yaminahua-Chitonahua, Yawanawá), and botanists Niels Valencia Chacón, Joaquina Albán Castillo,
Betty Millán Salazar, Eduardo Salas Zuluaga, Severo Baldeón, Rosa Bueno Cuadra y Carmen Martínez.
The anthropologists worked in parallel, each of them with
a specific ethnic group. They began first with a long term,
preparatory fieldwork. Later, they were joined each in turn
by relatively steady teams of botanists and ethnobotanists
from the Museo de Historia Natural de Lima, who carried
out a one-month systematic survey among each ethnic
group. This botanical fieldwork was systematically
attended by the local anthropologist.
Due to the target of the research, i.e. knowledge variation,
(ethno)botanists as well as anthropologists had to choose

informants deliberately varying in age, gender and knowledge reputation, and the enunciation context of all indigenous answer and information (either spontaneous or
not) was carefully recorded in a suited field sheet, and
later in the database. Among the Ashéninka, the botanical
survey for instance was carried out in this way in three villages (Dulce Gloria, Nueva Victoria and Aerija), with a
total of 42 informants. Their participation to the identification work in the forest plots was voluntary, but constant
attention was paid to diversify the small groups (2–6 persons) who were successively involved in the field trips.
Regarding the botanical collection, the basic method was
Gentry's lineal transects [44]. Priority was given to an
intensive inventory to take into account vines as well as
trees. That was the reason why we opted for a low minimum diameter at breast height (DBH) rather than for a
large number of plots [45]. These plots were transects of
50 × 4 m., located in primary or late secondary forest. The
sites were chosen by the botanists within a 90-min walk of
the settlements, which is a very usual distance for indigenous gathering, but outside of the places previously best
known by the informants, in order to test their knowledge
on a random basis. All plant individuals with a DBH of
2.5 cm and above were tagged and identified as far as possible (unfortunately, part of them only at genus level;
those were not taken into account in the further full comparative work with the database). Indigenous informants
were asked about the name, use and detailed forms of use
of all these plants.
In addition, a subsidiary inventory also addressed plants
of smaller DBH, but of greatest interest for ethnobotanical
analysis and intra- or interethnic comparison. It included
juvenile trees as well as shrubs, vines, herbs, epiphytes and
even non-vascular plants, pointed out by the ethnobotanist, the anthropologist or the indigenous informants
themselves, in the transects, in the fallows and during the
field trips.
A special attention was also paid to the protection of
indigenous intellectual property rights. Since our research
was not expected to entail any direct industrial or commercial application, we did not address these rights focusing on benefit sharing, as very correctly suggested by the
Declaration of Belem or D. Posey, for instance [46,47],
but rather in a defensive way. All scientists and institutional partners committed themselves to keeping all sensitive data secret. In addition, after our own comparative
work, a random link disconnected botanical identifications and indigenous uses in the central structure of the
database (even in the copies provided to the European
Commission), which makes it completely useless for
pharmaceutical, parapharmaceutical or biotechnological
purposes. Prior informed consent of indigenous commu-

nities and political organizations was obtained both in
Brazil and Peru, but the Brazilian authorities eventually
did not allow ethnobotanical collection. The research was
thus pursued on the only Peruvian side, without the
expected ethnobotanical data on the Yawanawá and Brazilian Ashéninka. The voucher specimens (all of them collected in Peru) were stored at the Museo de Historia Natural
de Lima.
Botanical, anthropological and consolidated reports of
this research programme were published some years ago
[48]. I was in charge of the synthesis of the results. I
assume entirely the possible errors of interpretation it
could entail, both in that former publication and in the
present paper.

Results and discussion
1. What is a "good medicine"?
What actually is a "good medicine"? At first sight, the
answer seems to be obvious. A medicine must be efficient
at curing injuries and sicknesses, and according to Western common sense, such efficiency relies essentially on
chemical effects. The potential discovery of new active
molecules is probably the main reason for the widespread
interest in tropical ethnomedicine [49-52]. In this sense,
local survival of extensive traditional knowledge of medicinal plants appears as a guarantee of success: Some of
these plants at least are likely to be really (i.e. chemically)
active... If one does not feel particularly interested in
indigenous categories of thought, the next most important step is just the scientific analysis of the plant components, in order to test their "real" efficacy.

Nevertheless, the indigenous approach may be quite different. All Ashéninka I met know a very large range of
medicinal plants [[53,54], and personal observation].
Given the strong ethnic pride I mentioned before, they
should be expected to have a high opinion of this knowledge. In this respect, however, they have always the same
curious comment: Either spontaneously or prompted,
they inevitably assert that the people who really know
about this matter are not themselves, but their Shipibo
neighbours, who live closer to the river Ucayali, the main
artery of the region, and generally closer to the Peruvian
settlements and cities.
"Who really know about plants are our neighbours"
This acknowledgment of Shipibo superiority is actually
much more than a simple comment. It entails direct borrowing of ethnobotanical knowledge as well. The qualitative comparison between ethnobotanical records among
both ethnic groups substantiates that Shipibo knowledge
is massively adopted by some Ashéninka individuals [[5356], and comparative work with the TSEMIM database].
These individuals are a little distinct from the others, even

in their personal history. Usually they have (or have had)
more extensive contacts with the outside world, and could
be called the most "cross-cultural" Ashéninka. At the same
time their personal history gave them the opportunity to
come into contact with Shipibo healers. Actually they
adopted many Shipibo characteristic plants and forms of
use, and (perhaps more significantly) also many aspects
of the Shipibo's peculiar style of management [personal
communication of F. Leclerc, [57]]: Around their house,
these "cross-cultural" individuals grow various "masterplants", considered as a sort of panacea, they engage in
new, more individualistic, forms of shamanism, they
openly talk about witchcraft plants, and so forth – which
the other Ashéninka never do. Moreover, this knowledge
borrowed from the Shipibo does not come in addition to
the Ashéninka "traditional" one, but partially substitutes
it [58].
At first sight, it seems to be absolutely normal: The most
travelled and probably open-minded Ashéninka are giving up part of their own ethnomedicinal knowledge and
learning the Shipibo one – why not, if the latter is better?
Nevertheless, the comparison with the results of the
botanical and ethnobotanical surveys proved to be rather
surprising. Contrary to all expectations, the Shipibo
informants did not identify a wider range of medicinal
plants than the Ashéninka. Among many other kinds of
data, the botanists had recorded how many plant samples
had a specific indigenous name, and how many had a specific use. These kinds of rates are commonly used as a first
assessment about the overall level of local knowledge
[45,59]. The amazing point was that regarding all these
rates, the Ashéninka informants had reached much better
results than the Shipibo ones, as substantiated by Tables
1, 2 and 3.
Actually, it could also be argued that the Shipibo medicinal plants should be more efficient, but there is absolutely
no evidence of such a qualitative superiority. I am absolutely conscious that I cannot prove my statement in a
strict scientific way. We did not test the pharmaceutical
efficacy of any medicinal plant we discovered or registered. It was outside the scope of our research, and besides

we committed ourselves to the total protection of the
indigenous intellectual property rights (see details in section Methods). However, in my opinion some particulars
could be considered as significant indications.
On the one hand, coincidences in fieldwork gave us the
opportunity to experiment with Ashéninka's medicinal
plants. I can testify that some of them are quite efficient,
in a strict biomedical sense. My first example is about a
disinfectant/cicatrizing compress (please forgive me if I
keep the botanical identifications confidential: that was
our personal commitment with indigenous informants
and organizations). It was used on a thumb tip cut to the
bone. After exactly seven days, the cicatrisation was perfectly formed, without any infection. My second example
is an anti-inflammatory leaf. I had broken my fibula, but
I thought it was just a sprain. I had to walk as I could to
deal with everyday needs and my ankle was terribly swollen. The effect of the anti-inflammatory leaves was amazing. Directly under the compress, the swelling used to go
down spectacularly after a couple of hours. After two
weeks, I was able to walk up and down the hills, and to go
back to the closest landing strip.
On the other hand, the Shipibo herbal medicines have
been well-known for many years. They were widespread
beyond the ethnic boundaries due to training programmes [60] and popular handbooks [[61] – see also
[62-64]]. In the Ucayali region, they belong now to the
public domain. Some of them are presumably efficient
too, but as far as I know, none is particularly famous for
its outstanding, immediate efficiency in a strict biomedical sense. The best of Shipibo medical skills lie probably
elsewhere.
In my eyes, there is thus no doubt that the Ashéninka
herbal medicines are likely to be as efficient as any Shipibo equivalent. If so, we are faced with a strange paradox.
According to most common Western criteria, the
Ashéninka ethnomedicinal knowledge is really outstanding, but the proud, self-esteeming, Ashéninka themselves
did not agree at all. From their own point of view, this
knowledge was so underestimated that some of them preferred to borrow from foreigners – who actually do not

1 In the indigenous sense, that is to say including also a wide set of uses and effects that the Western approaches usually deem to be "magic" or
"irrational", but that indigenous people do not really distinguish from the rest of medicine: shamanic hallucinogens, hunting magic, protection against
harmful spirits, enhancing of children skills, seduction medicines, and so forth – see Table 3.

seem to be more knowledgeable... It looks like an absurdity. That was our first surprise, but in fact we were struck
by a second one: In the Ucayali region, this kind of situation was anything but an exception.
Regional chains of interethnic borrowing
Besides the Ashéninka, the TSEMIM research programme
addressed five other indigenous groups in the same way.
The final comparative work on all anthropological and
botanical data highlighted another finding: Despite its
paradoxical nature, the borrowing relationship between

Shipibo and Ashéninka actually corresponds to a rather
frequent pattern. I do not mean that it could thereby be
used as a general model for inter-indigenous relationship
in Amazonia: Even in our work region, a few counterexamples could be found. But the repetition of the same
pattern is conspicuous enough to warrant full attention.
The same schema was repeated several times, forming
chains of interethnic borrowing. Just as the Ashéninka
borrow from the Shipibo, others, namely the Yaminahua,
borrow from the Ashéninka, while a fourth group, the

one, the Yora, from another sub-group of Yaminahua.
All these cases present the same characteristics. Firstly, the
adoption of new ethnomedicinal knowledge does not
seem to rely primarily on pragmatic or pharmaceutical
substantiation. Secondly, it is a large scale process. Borrowing includes crucial species and entails important
changes in both the empirical management of the plants
and the social management of knowledge. According to
Miguel Carid Naveira's and Laura Pérez Gil's findings, the
Yaminahua for instance formerly used to gather wild
plants in the forest: It was a mostly male activity, and the
only restriction to access these resources rested in individual levels of ethnobotanical knowledge. Currently,
women's involvement has become more important: They
have obtained varieties of cultivated "piri-piri" (Cyperus
sp., Cyperaceae) from the Ashéninka, but have also
learned how to preserve the related knowledge as a personal secret – and they are now managing wild medicinal
plants in the same way. It is a complete reversal of former
customs [42].
Moreover, the orientation of borrowing chains is very
consistent – and that is probably the crucial point. Despite
traces of a formerly much more complex situation [37],
the process is restricted nowadays to a single direction:
The new knowledge always comes from the indigenous
neighbouring group who is closer to the Peruvian urban
world.
In this respect, the interethnic position of the respective
groups is quite significant. As mentioned before, the Shipibo are living very close to the urban people (their main
village is actually a suburb of Pucallpa, the second big city
of Peruvian Amazon), and they are very skilful in trading
with non indigenous people [65,66], in promoting their
shamanic skills and in negotiating with Peruvian institutions. In a city like Pucallpa, numerous mestizos and foreign people consult Shipibo shamans. They visit them for
relational, emotional and psychosomatic problems (envy,
personal success, love problems, illnesses including
behaviour disturbance like "susto" and "cutipado"...) much
more than for herbal treatment (D. Lacaze and P.
Deshayes, personal communication). Besides their skilful
management of handicraft and shamanic cures oriented
to mestizos and foreigners, the Shipibo also obtain many
little jobs in the civil service, as indigenous teachers for
instance. Statistics were not available, but empirical observation reveals a conspicuous overrepresentation.
The Ashéninka, despite centuries-old contacts, tend to be
much more reserved. The jobs they obtain in the civil service tend to be restricted to a very local level. The three
other ethnic groups are ancient isolated people, succes-

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

sively drawn to sedentary settlements: the Yaminawa were
in the 60's, the Yora in the 80's, and the first Chitonahua
came out from the forest in the last 10 years – part of them
remaining still isolated [42,67].
What does borrowing mean, then? Obviously, here the
mixed-blood society is a crucial focus of attraction,
although it is in a complex and oblique feature. The borrowing process partially means going towards the Peruvian world. But at the same time, new knowledge comes
from indigenous neighbours. Moreover, all of the new
borrowed items are emblematic of "indianness": They
concern ayahuasca (a shamanic psychoactive mixture),
manioc beer, shamanism, steam baths, or the already
mentioned piri-piri... The result is a closer proximity to
urban people, though keeping very clear indigenous features.
What is at stake here is thus a question of collective identity, that is to say the construction of a defined place in a
shared interethnic system, much more than something we
should call therapeutic efficacy. For us, such a thought
reveals a sort of "confusion" between collective identity,
interethnic relationship, and medical efficiency. However,
we have absolutely no reason to suspect the sincerity of
indigenous belief. Health is a major concern for them,
and what is borrowed from the neighbours has to be used
in the flesh. When comparing respective medicinal skills,
the "inconsistent" hierarchy indigenous people build is
nothing but their own way to assess what they deem to be
actual therapeutic efficacy.
I repeat that we cannot really compare biomedical efficiency here, given the lack of chemical and pharmaceutical evidences. I just want to stress the contrast between
indigenous and Western thought processes. For the
Ashéninka (and presumably the other peoples I mentioned too), the first concern is with respective positions
in the interethnic landscape. Presumptions of plant efficiency are induced from this prior criterion. Empirical
confirmations may occur later, but just as a last, optional
step. For Western people and scientists, the first concern is
with the plants. The extent and diversity of local knowledge (rather than its overall fame) may be taken as a
promising indication, but nothing is achieved before
chemical analyses. The former is based on relationships,
the latter on material substances.
Let me emphasize that the indigenous approach is quite
different from inability to take the conclusive empirical
steps, or from attention simply paid to some additional
dimensions of medicine. Rather, it reveals two contrasting
conceptions and managements of medical knowledge.

For biomedicine and ethnobotanical science, the healing
power of a medicinal plant belongs to the world "out
there". Both the plants and the related knowledge are
managed as mere objects. They may be bought, borrowed
and transferred independently of the people who knew
and used them first. In order to be scientifically tested and
prove their therapeutic efficacy, they must be "isolated"
(the active substance from the plant, and the plant itself
from its local context). Knowledge is a matter of neutral,
universal verification.
By contrast, in the Ashéninka approach, neither the plant
nor the knowledge may be separated from people and
relational contexts. Their healing power is understood to
come precisely from their respective position in an overall
network that includes plants as well as human beings. The
Ashéninka trust the Shipibo medicinal plants primarily
because they are related with Shipibo people, and because
Sipibo people themselves are related with urban people
(P. Gow argues for the same kind of motivation concerning the diffusion of ayahuasca throughout Western Amazonia [68]). Pharmaceutical or chemical effects are taken
into account later on, as a second-class criterion. Knowledge is a matter of ties between plants and persons keeping in touch.
2. Who is a "good healer"?
The analysis of borrowing processes led us to a crucial criterion: the opposition between substances and relationships. Priorities are quite different for Western and
Ashéninka peoples. The contrast could also be expressed
in other words. For biomedicine, a good healer is somebody who suitably uses good medicines. For an
Ashéninka, the reverse makes much more sense: A good
medicine is something used by a good healer.

The latter should be a mere tautology if it were not underlain by a complex conception of healer's agency. It is
worth noting that placing stress on the relational background of medicinal resources and knowledge is not so
unusual. Even in our own societies, some people assess
the therapeutic value of exotic or native treatments
according, primarily, to their mystical/geographical or
ecological/natural source. But it is a peripheral claim, usually referred to poorly known "alternative" traditions. By
contrast, the Ashéninka relational approach is grounded
in a dynamic and quite consistent system of thought and
practice.
The great shaman who knew very few plants
I question the point starting from an occasional case, a
(great) shaman who hardly could identify wild medicinal
plants. The example might be a little surprising and is not
to be generalized, but it does not seem to be so excep-

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

tional. Most of all, it enlightens the peculiarity of
Ashéninka priorities.
In the border region of the river Yurua (Juruá in Brazil),
Shoéshi is known as a very great shaman. His reputation
extends far beyond his little village, Nueva Victoria, on the
Peruvian upper reaches of the river.
With the botanists Severo Baldeón and Eduardo Salas Zuluaga (both from the Museo de Historia Natural of Lima),
Shoéshi did not take part in the ordinary informants
teams, but we managed to take him along on a couple of
special ethnobotanical walks. As usual, a few other people
were coming along (we did not want to impede it, given
our special interest paid to enunciation contexts and
informants' interaction), but very quickly we realized that
something was going wrong. Whenever the plant identification was likely to be more difficult or dubious, Shoéshi
trailed behind, while all the others (namely his wife, two
of his nephews, one of them BS and the other ZS...)
rushed to answer first. The ethnobotanist obviously managed to prevent such an intromission and forced answers
from Shoéshi himself. The experiment provided us with
substantial evidence that the greatest shaman of the Yurua
border also had one of the lowest identification scores we
had measured: no more than 70 or 75 % of the average
adult's results [[53] and TSEMIM database].
However, Shoéshi is not a charlatan, but a real spiritual
leader and quite an effective healer. Ill people pay him
constant visits. Some of them are coming from nearby settlements, but others are from Brazil, which means travelling through the forest for a couple of weeks and staying
in Nueva Victoria for several months. His healing reputation even cuts across ethnic boundaries: I alluded before
to the Yaminahua women who visit him to learn about
his steam baths techniques. Actually, the question is not
about Shoéshi's efficacy itself. It is a more fundamental
one: How could somebody be so great a plant healer, with
so poor botanical ability?
A first and very circumstantial point is that Shoéshi does
not have good eyesight, due to congenital trouble. Of
course his relatives are well aware of that weakness. Theirconstant willingness to answer instead of him, all along
the two identification walks, is quite understandable:
Such a crude systematic test could not but humiliate
Shoéshi. Moreover, it was still more unfair than it appears
at first sight, because of the kind of knowledge this humiliation was paid to: In fact, from the indigenous standpoint
it is nothing but a very superficial one.
Despite a frequent prejudice, knowing a large range of
medicinal plants is not a shaman's particular skill. In
some ethnic groups, such knowledge is rather equally

Page 9 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:49

shared by all men and women, as it is among the
Ashéninka or the Ka'apor [69]. In others, like among the
Yagua [10], the Warao [27] and many Panoan groups
[28,29]; [42,43], it is a matter for specialists. These specialists are often distinguished by a specific term, but their
knowledge is viewed as an incomplete one, a sort of second-class skill. The herbalists try to intervene first, and if
they fail, ill people have to visit the shaman.
Herbalism and shamanism
Shamans are deemed to have a superior knowledge, since
they are able to heal illnesses that ordinary people or
herbalists cannot. But their knowledge is often very elusive, and actually the more encyclopaedic, use-oriented
ethnobotany of indigenous herbalists or ordinary people
seems to be closer to our own system.

In fact, I suspect that this apparent closeness arises merely
from a working misunderstanding (in Marshall Sahlins'
sense, [70]), but after all it does work, so that there are few
questions about it. However, the underlying inconsistency is rather conspicuous. In many ethnobotanical surveys, for instance, the categories of uses "magic" and
"medicine" are clearly contrasted [69]. Other authors have
taken a more nuanced approach [71,1,3]. As Western people, nevertheless, we cannot help establishing a clear distinction between a plant that protects you from bad
spirits, or brings you luck with hunting, and another that
cures you of fever; or between a plant that protects you
against a future snake bite and another that stops the
effects of an actual one.
There is clear evidence of our common difficulty in dealing with indigenous empirical categories of thought.
However ingenuous it may be, our most spontaneous
reaction is to refer all "magic" or "irrational" uses to the
"real" medicine, through psychosomatic effect, or
through some hidden pharmaceutical efficacy (e.g., a
plant against the dangerous "black water spirits" will be
expected to prevent or cure actual fevers due to actual pathogens in stagnant water).
By contrast, although Ashéninka people do not distinguish "magic" and "real medicinal" uses, they also tend to
refer one kind of uses to the other. Nevertheless, they do
it in the exactly opposite way. For them, the better conceptual framework to explain the "real" healing power is the
working of the "magic" one.
Let us return to the example of snake bites. Like most
Amazonian people, the Ashéninka know many herbs,
leaves, roots, latexes and barks used to cure them, and
actually some of the chemical components could be efficacious against snake venom. When asked about the
forms of use, the Ashéninka detail the preparation (rasped

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

or crushed, raw or boiled, etc.), but the very crucial point
seems to be so obvious that they usually even forget to
mention it: Before any physical use of the medicinal plant,
you have to find the snake and kill it, otherwise the medicine is absolutely useless – everyone agrees on this point.
The idea is clear. Killing the snake means destroying the
will which yearned for your death. The material medicinal
substance is expected to have some physical effect indeed,
but first and foremost it must be encompassed in the restoration of the correct relationship. Before this crucial
step, the most effective antidote literally does not materialize. It is quite the reverse of our own conceptual hierarchy, whereby the relationship is encompassed in material
substances: first my body, the snake venom and the vegetal antidote, and later their interaction.
A knowledgeable Ashéninka knows and uses a very large
set of medicinal plants, each of them suited to some specific purpose(s). According to our ethnobotanical surveys,
they range from leaves against flu or cicatrizing barks to
medicine against rainbow burns, vines for sexual attraction or leaves to improve dogs' hunting ability, and the
rate of forest plants used as medicines (in this wide sense)
ranges from 76.7 % to 88.6 % [[53] and TSEMIM database, see Table 3]. By comparison with such a large and
diverse common knowledge, which are then the characteristics of the shaman's skills?
To put it simply, the distinction is quite similar to our own
biomedical distinction between symptomatic and aetiological treatments. In most cases I observed or I was told,
the illnesses to be treated were exactly the same. The difference is that ordinary people deal with specific, superficial cure, while shamans strike at the root. Nevertheless,
both of them are working within the same conceptual
framework. As illustrated by the snake bite example, this
framework relies on a special stress on relationships, in
sharp contrast with our own emphasis on material substances and our basically chemical or mechanical interpretations of diseases and body.
Moreover, the distinction between Ashéninka herbalism
and shamanism should be poorly described referring to
the classic opposition of body/spirit. Healing is not
shared between a bodily dimension reserved for herbal
treatments, and a spiritual/soul dimension reserved for
shamanic cure. From their own point of view, ordinary
people using herbal medicines are acting essentially on
the body, but so does the shaman too. Perhaps the latter
sounds a little strange, but the reason is that their conception of body and subjectivity is completely different from
ours. Bodily materiality and subjective innerness are felt
to interact in another way.

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:49

Ontological background: another conception of the body
This Ashéninka conception is rooted in a peculiar ontological background, the currently well-known "Amerindian perspectivism" [[72-74], and [75] for the specific
Ashéninka version]. I briefly summarize the basic points
that will be of most interest here. According to this indigenous view, what human people share with all other living beings is not the bodily physical substance, as it is
always stressed in Western science (see e.g. phylogeny and
ontogenesis, or living cells and biochemistry). What is
universally shared is rather a very human-like perception
and sociability. Obviously, there are gaps between the different living species, but these gaps are just a matter of specific points of view.

A classic Amazonian illustration should be the peccary/
human/jaguar triad. The Ashéninka version is very typical.
A white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) views its own wandering herd as a foraging human tribe, the swampy hollow where it wallows as a human village, and the wild
roots it is eating as domesticated manioc. That is the peccary's sight on its own people, but everything changes
when it is looking at outsiders (that is to say, other species). From its prey's standpoint, it views any human
hunter in a jaguar form – as well as reciprocally, actual jaguars view their human prey as peccaries, but view other
jaguars in a human form, and so forth. Each point of view
is directly shaped by the distinct body which defines the
peculiar human, animal or vegetal species you belong to.
The overall result is a single but absolutely overcrowded
world: There is no real distinction between natural and
supernatural, rather "Nature" is divided in a countless
(though not infinite) number of disconnected specific
points of view. Furthermore, it could be emphasized that
these points of view are much more than a simple matter
of passive perception. Having a body also means having
body-embedded wills. Perhaps it is more conspicuous
and understandable in a full-life biodiverse environment
like the tropical rainforest, and for hunters who are dealing every day with wild life. Predators or snakes are full of
killer mood, prey feels the bodily will to flee or to fight,
many other animals and spirits are hungry for certain
kinds of human souls (souls as an aspect of the body),
some plants are filled with specific psychotropic wills and
energy, some others are with healing or poisonous or
feeding ones... (about the influence of these beliefs on
everyday experience and very basic perceptual processes,
see [75].
Human health, hunting, agriculture and general wellbeing largely depend on this complex network of intertwined wills. When something has gone wrong, that is to
say when some bad connection ("attacks" and "harmful
influences" usually understood to be the sources of ill-

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

ness) or disconnection (mostly in case of hunting or agricultural problems) has harmed human people, the ties
and boundaries need to be restored in their favour. That is
the shaman's job. He must therefore get directly in touch
with the other species, and he cannot do so without dealing with them in their human form. According to the perspectivist thought, the shaman has thus to give up his own
human embodiment for a while, and to re-embody in the
shape of these other beings, in order to have a temporary
access to their specific points of view.
That process of disembodiment and re-embodiment is the
basic reason for the typical step-by-step feature of shamanic training. Unlike the herbalist, the shaman does not
necessarily have to know and use a wide range of healing
plants. He learns them one by one, and it is a slow and
long process: first the psychotropic ayahuasca, called
kamarámpi (Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce) Norton, Malpighiaceae) and its main additive hurúwa (Psychotria viridis
R& P., Rubiaceae), then tobacco, according to the
Ashéninka hierarchy, later maybe datura (called sááro,
Brugmansia candida Pers., Solanaceae), or more peripheral
allies like thonénto (Cavanillesia hylogeiton Ulbr., Bombacaceae) and kasáwi trees (Duroia hirsuta (P&E) Benth,
Rubiaceae)... Each alliance with a new kind of alien being
requires a respective disembodiment/re-embodiment. But
the patient building of his personal network of inter-specific ties gives him much more therapeutic efficacy than
the herbalist has. It gives him access to a genuine perception of real causes of illnesses, which is crucial for diagnosis, and sometimes for direct healing action. We had no
reason to be disappointed by Shoéshi's poor ability to
identify medicinal plants. This was just an additional and
very peripheral aspect of his job.
3. Many forms of healing
The Ashéninka shaman has a wide range of healing techniques at his disposal. This section essentially draws on
those I have been told of in details by well-known informants, and most of all, on those I could observe personally.
Some of them are close to herbal treatment, others peculiar to shamanic skills. They often echo practices reported
in other parts of Amazonia, and present evidences of evolution and transfer. My concern, nevertheless, is not with
historical or comparative work. Rather, I want to review
them in the light of the Ashéninka constant emphasis on
relational aspects of medicine, and of the peculiar body
conception I exposed just above. I consider both points as
potential keys of understanding of these highly varying
practices.
Tobacco, thorns and steam baths
In everyday life, an Ashéninka shaman rarely has to resort
to his most heroic and accurate healing skills. Just as a
Western doctor, the main part of his daily action is to

Page 11 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:49

attend to routine cases. I will briefly describe this rather
innocuous part of his work first.
The most common healing practice is widespread in the
whole Amazonian region or even Amerindian world. The
shaman just blows some tobacco smoke -or spits some
tobacco juice- on the part of the body of the patient he
deems to be the focus of illness. Actually, if we go into particulars, there are many variations among shamans or
from one healing session to another: A specific chant
might accompany the tobacco blowing or spitting; a thorn
or a little piece of charcoal might be sucked out from the
patient's body, and presented as the cause of illness; some
kind of further medication was often recommended, for
instance certain well-known wild plants to be used as
leaves baths. But in all cases the distinctive skill of the shaman is always the same. His long frequentation of tobacco
and other psychoactive plants gives him an outstanding
diagnostic ability. In order to "see" the focus of illness,
when faced with ordinary diseases and ailments, he does
not need actual disembodiment and re-embodiment any
more – besides, a shaman's frequent statement is that he
needs to consume less and less hallucinogenic drugs as the
years go by.
Another form of everyday healing is steam bathing. In the
Ucayali region, it is a specific Ashéninka technique,
although Matsigenka women have begun learning it [1],
as well as some Yaminahua women from the vicinity, as
mentioned before about interethnic borrowing. In fact,
steam baths do not belong to the shaman's reserved skills;
they are commonly used by specialized Ashéninka
women who have some affinity with shamanic talent.
What distinguishes the shaman is just a better diagnostic
accuracy regarding the selected leaves added to the water
and, even more, regarding the divination process after the
steam bath.
The patient is placed over a big cooking pot and covered
with a large cloth. The pot contains water, leaves of Pariwana (Clarisia biflora R& P., Moraceae) and sometimes of
other plant species, depending on the illness to be healed.
Several red-hot axe heads (or stones, in a more traditional
version) are progressively put in the water, to produce billows of steam shrouding the patient. After this first step,
which lasts about 15 or 20 minutes, the water is thrown
away and the leaves are carefully inspected, in order to discover some thorn or piece of bone or charcoal.
Those foreign bodies are understood to be the material
support of the illness, rather than its cause. However, the
public attention and comments focus exclusively on this
material detail, because talking explicitly about the real
aetiology, might be problematic. Once again, illness is
deemed to be grounded in relationships – that is to say in

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

conscious or unconscious aggressiveness, in this case.
Someone sent these thorns or little pieces of charcoal into
the patient's body. It could be some harmful beings of the
forest ("spirit" or animals), but many times the culprit is
deemed to be a relative or a neighbour.
Pointing out the culprit is a real problem for the
Ashéninka shaman – and local people. Violence within
the ethnic group is strongly prohibited. Unlike the frequent Amazonian pattern of permanent hostility and war
between neighbouring local groups, internal feuding has
been strongly proscribed for centuries, and shared ethnic
identity is always positively stressed in first encounters
with unknown visitors. It is an atypical characteristic of all
"Campas" (Ashéninka-Asháninka, Matsigenka, Nomatsigenka) and Yanesha-Amuesha: War is only aimed at foreign people [36,13]. In everyday life, the Ashéninka
highly value self-control over pain and affects, motions
and tone of voice, and interpersonal aggressiveness is
rarely allowed to be expressed.
However, conflicts, jealousy and aggressiveness do exist,
and are deemed to be an important source of illness. To
deal with this uncomfortable contradiction, the shaman
has various options at his disposal. As described before,
he may engage into individual cures, either with tobacco
smoke or with steam baths. He focuses public attention
on the thorns or charcoal pieces expelled from the
patient's body, and the pointing out of the culprit remains
thus as implicit or explicit as he wants – giving him some
room for manoeuvre and social management of the problem. The shaman Shoéshi for instance was particularly
skilful in this respect.
Additionally, the shaman may engage in another form of
agency. To complement this individual or interpersonal
side of the cure, he may rely on collective sessions of ayahuasca, which are an overall, more preventive healing
process- as emphasized by C. Izquierdo about the Matsigenka, health is not an individual, strictly physical and
biomedical issue, but also a social, relational one [3].
Social healing with ayahuasca
In their current form, the collective sessions of ayahuasca
are first and foremost a bodily experience. The ceremonial
use of the psychotropic mixture was first recorded by Gerald Weiss, who noted that in most cases, "the ceremony, following a definite if simple format, presents the appearance of a
group of people reverently making contact with the good spirits
under the leadership of a religious practitioner, even though it
is true that they remain passively appreciative spectators of the
shaman's virtuosity." However, "in one part of Campa territory that [he]visited, the ceremony proceeds as described, except
that the men take turns singing so that the shaman remains the
director of the ceremony but is no longer the only virtuoso" [7].

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:49

Actually, both the form and content of the sessions are
evolving. In the early 70's, in the Tambo region, the collective direct participation in drug consumption and
songs performance was described by Weiss as an exception. Nowadays, in the Ucayali region, it is a rather common feature. In my opinion, the important point is that
the change strengthens the bodily dimension of the experience. Some concrete details will make it clearer.
This kind of ayahuasca session is always held at night. Everyone is supposed to participate, though the actual audience is usually restricted to most of the men and some
teenagers who want to join them – women stay at home,
taking care of the children. All participants sit in a circle in
the dark, and each of them goes to the shaman to have a
little cup of ayahuasca. After waiting for about half an
hour, in almost complete silence and immobility (there
will be very few motions during the whole session), the
hallucinogenic effects of the brew begin to be felt, and the
shaman starts the first song. The others follow him, with
the same short repetitive song, but everyone sings at his
own pace. The voices cover each other, and nobody tries
to build a collective song in the sense of trying to reach an
acoustic unity.
In fact, everyone is singing for themselves, to celebrate the
arrival of the first plants and animals "visiting spirits". In
the Ucayali region, the most frequent are the tobacco,
Shéri or Pocháro; the ayahuasca itself (Banisteriopsis caapi
(Spruce) Norton, Malpighiaceae), addressed as Hanánero;
the main additive of the brew, Hurúwa (Psychotria viridis
R& P., Rubiaceae); and on the animal side, the Cacique
birds Chówa and Tsirótse (Psarocolius sp., Cacicus cela,
Icteridae). All of them appear in their human form and
dressed with their distinctive tunics and ornaments.
Usually, either in regional Spanish or in ethnographic
accounts, such human-like apparitions are referred as
"spirits" (or "espíritus") of the related plants and animals,
visiting the participants in the ritual assembly. However, I
assume that such a translation is nothing but a misunderstanding, grounded in our own opposition between
steady material bodies and elusive immaterial souls. The
Ashéninka are likely to experience it in a quite different
way.
In fact, if we pay attention to their genuine wordings (in
their own language), the Ashéninka never talk about "visiting spirits", but about the arrival of the specific plant or
specific animal itself. It is a question of concepts rather
than words. This wording has to be taken all the more seriously since it perfectly fits in with the peculiar ontology of
the Ashéninka.

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

What happens with ayahuasca visions then, from an
Ashéninka point of view? Under the effect of ayahuasca,
plants and animals are seen in their human form. It is
noteworthy that such a perception is absolutely abnormal, for the Ashéninka as well as for us. In normal circumstances, a hunter knows that plants and animals are
persons, but this is theoretical knowledge. The Ashéninka
are not fanciful people, lost in a sort of blurred irrational
fog. As explained before, their animist ontology leads
them to pay prime attention to other aspects of living
beings' bodies (the will and behavioural trends rather
than the morphological outline, the inter-species relationships rather than the material substances), but apart from
that, their perception is not so different from ours. Plants
and animals are perceived as vegetal or animal bodies,
which is absolutely consistent with the ontological theory,
by the way: Human people have human bodies, so that a
man is normally prisoner of his own embodied point of
view, just as any other living species is too.
By contrast, when he is faced with plants and animals in
human form, the participant in an ayahuasca session suddenly becomes able to shift to the perspective of another
kind of living beings. According to his ontology, he cannot but understand it as a metamorphosis of his own
human body. In fact, it is quite the reverse of the usual
Western interpretation as "visiting spirits". What is at
stake here is a temporary bodily process, whereby a human
being assumes the embodied point of view of another species and can meet the actual plant or animal. There is no
need to appeal to any metaphoric sense here. A literal
interpretation of this process of disembodiment/reembodiment is absolutely consistent with all what an
Ashéninka knows and directly feels during this experience,
in a quite physical sense. One of the initial effects of ayahuasca is the sensation of a complete bodily disarticulation, which is probably an inherent effect of the brew (and
a rather uncomfortable feeling). It cannot but enhance the
conviction of an actual body transformation.
On a social level, such an experience has a great power of
healing. Let us imagine now each man from the ceremonial circle, sitting motionless in near absolute dark. For
him, the apparitions are a direct and physical experience,
much stronger than simple "hallucinogenic visions": He
knows and feels that for this exceptional time, his own
body is completely reshaped to attend one by one of the
visiting plants and animals, and later the solar deity Páwa,
all of them in their distinctive bright human dress. He is
singing at his own pace, firstly for himself and the visitor
he personally succeeded in joining, to celebrate the happiness of such an encounter. But at the same time, he hears
the voices of all his companions too.

On the one hand, nobody sings in unison. On the other
hand, everybody is singing a similar song, that is to say,
proves to experience the same happy re-embodiment. The
personal experience is also perceived to as a conspicuous
general engagement- and let us recall that in this kind of
ayahuasca sessions, all expected visiting plants, animals
and deities are understood to be extremely good and
kindly disposed towards all human beings. In this sense,
it is a perfect counterpoint for the unacceptable acknowledgement of internal conflicts and tensions. These ayahuasca rituals are an affirmation, or even more, a physical
experience of collective harmony.
Ayahuasca and individual serious illnesses
The collective sessions of ayahuasca are the happy side of
the disembodiment/re-embodiment processes. There is
another, much more dramatic one, also related to ayahuasca, but addressing individual patients. When illnesses
are particularly serious, common healing techniques like
steam baths or tobacco smoke are useless. The patient
does not recover, which means that the shaman probably
did not identify the main source of illness. After a few
days, the shaman understands that the only efficient intervention should be direct work on less obvious aspects of
the body.

Such an intervention cannot be explained in biomedical
terms, but it clearly relies on a particular conception of
diagnosis, as embedded in a plurality of levels and perspectives – as usual, the first step is diagnosis, but levels of
diagnosis are various. It is a sort of systemic approach. Illness is understood to be due to some problem within the
complex network of intertwined wills that interconnects
all living beings, but the point is to circumscribe exactly
the problematic relational level. Health depends on the
global network, and the harmful influence you discovered
at first sight possibly hides another, deeper one.
In these cases of very serious illnesses, the shaman has to
consume ayahuasca, in order to mobilize his most powerful allies. In the Ucayali region, the first ones were the
swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus, Accipitridae) and
a tree, called thonénto (Cavanillesia hylogeiton Ulbr., Bombacaceae). If it did not give the desired effects, he had to
appeal then to the help of the most dangerous ones: the
giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis, Mustelidae), the king
vulture (Sarcoramphus papa, Cathartidae), and the jaguar.
It should be noted that these shamanic allies appear in
their human form, and act exactly like an Ashéninka
human shaman. Their task is to "see" the foreign body –
thorn or little piece of charcoal – that makes people ill,
and to suck it out from the patient's body, after blowing
tobacco smoke on it. The techniques of diagnosis and cure
are thus exactly the same as in human world. In fact these

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

allied beings are simply performing usual healing on their
own level of reality – or, so to speak, on their own level of
"physicality": a jaguar-physicality, a king vulture-physicality, etc. The perspective is absolutely human-like but completely distinct from the human one. What is expected is
probably an alternative interpretation of one and the
same reality, revealing problems that otherwise remain
hidden.
This kind of cure is understood to be extremely dangerous
and difficult, and it is strictly reserved to the very shamans.
Their vegetal and animal allies belong to the most "powerful" species, which means that the attractive power of
their specific perspectives is particularly strong.
The dangers of disembodiment
Temporary disembodiment is a well-known Amerindian
topic [72,73,76]. It is dangerous because you may be kept
in another being's perspective, without being able to
come back to the human one. It may occur while dreaming, walking absent-minded in the forest or giving into the
appeal of recently dead relatives, and it is one of the greatest fears an Ashéninka may feel. Firstly your human body
appears to be unchanged but it is gradually affected, and
finally you die: Death means being caught in the sight of
the other.

Therefore, in Ashéninka thought, death always comes
from outside, but "outside" and "inside" are relative concepts: The boundaries are insecure and unstable, they may
be permanently crossed over or twisted by the wills of
other beings. That is because the world is not "out there",
unfolding around human people. As any other living species, we are embedded in it as direct partakers of its networks. It is a dense and overcrowded world, but within
this world, despite its wideness, energies and material
substances are finite (a crucial point of Amazonian, and
probably Amerindian thought, which I think we never
stress enough – see [77,78]). Due to this limitation, each
species and being has to feed on one another in order to
live and grow.
Indigenous theories about generalized predation are
another crucial Amazonian topic [77-81]. At first sight,
they look a little bit like our own ecological or Darwinian
approaches, but in order to avoid any misunderstanding
we have to point out a crucial difference. From an
Ashéninka point of view, what happens is not exactly a
struggle for life between species and/or individuals,
understood as separated entities. Once again, everything
remains grounded in relationships. Actually, the other
side of predation is often seduction, which can induce a
consenting bodily metamorphosis and assimilation to the
other.

An illustration of this aspect is the case of the peyári. The
word could be translated as "ghost" or "ghost soul",
though the concepts about "souls" are rather distinct from
ours. The peyári arises when people die. It is the part of a
recent deceased which stays there for a time, often embodied in a partial or complete animal shape (a man with a
sloth head, or a deer with a strange behaviour, for
instance), whereas another kind of soul simply goes away
(as usual in Amazonia, souls are several, and may undergo
quite different fates).
The Ashéninka are usually reluctant to express fear and
pain, and in everyday life the presence of a peyári is the
only situation which repeatedly provokes real panic. It is
quite understandable. For some weeks or months after
death, the peyári remains walking around the village, especially at night-time, and calls to its former friends and relatives to take them along. It is understood as a frequent
cause of illness and death. In this sense, the peyári is a
predator and a killer. However, from its own point of view
the situation is completely different. The reason for its
harmful behaviour is nothing but sorrow and loneliness;
it simply does not want to leave its village and its family.
In fact, it just wishes some company before going away –
and of course it therefore tries to convince its closest and
most loved friends and relatives. For the remaining living
people, there is thus a great temptation to pay attention to
this sorrow. It comes from their recently dead wife,
brother or close friend. But if they give in to this appeal,
they fall in the peyári point of view, which entails nothing
but illness and death, from a human point of view.
Local strategies to resist the dangerous attraction of death
people vary throughout Amazonia [41,82-84], but they
are usually characterized by the same kind of emotional
ambiguity as among the Ashéninka. Regarding ethnomedical concepts, another noteworthy point is the ontological
status of the peyári. I mentioned above examples of its
sloth head or deer body. Just like its Araweté equivalent,
ta'äwé [85], this curious "soul" is not conceived of without
a specific embodiment (I mean "specific" in the sense of
belonging to a particular species of beings, with distinctive physical and behavioural characteristics). Rather than
against a "supernatural spirit", the dead people's relatives
have to fight against the cannibalistic seduction of a quite
material being. Once again, the struggle is about the body:
The peyári's aim is to reshape living people according to its
own bodily perspective.
There are so a lot of risks and temptations in the "disintegration" of the Self. For the Ashéninka, the boundaries of
the Self and the body are fragile and unstable, and staying
alive as a human being means firstly a permanent fight
against disintegration. Many other living beings are waiting for it, with very few exceptions: your kin, who share

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

your same food, some allied animal and vegetal species,
and perhaps your whole ethnic group, since unlike many
other Amazonian peoples, the Ashéninka established a
permanent truce between themselves, prohibiting physical warfare and shamanic aggression. With all the others,
predation is the mainspring of life, of growth, health and
illness, and of death. All preys and predators (including
the "spirits") are individual, material beings, without real
distinction between natural and supernatural worlds – or
natural and supernatural diseases: The points of view are
distinct indeed, but this is just a matter of distinctive bodies. This theory of general predation and bodies' discontinuity probably gives the overall framework of what
healing means among the Ashéninka.

Conclusion
The practices I have presented are manifold. They include
herbal interventions, which could be, deceptively, compared to our own approach of medicinal substances, and
the highly varying forms of healing performed by the shamans. As a conclusion, I shall synthesize my results, compare the shamanic and the herbalist approaches and
question eventually their coexistence and hierarchy.
Herbalism and shamanism do not address two different
kinds of illnesses, according to countless personal observations. In other parts of Amazonia, a sharing of "natural
diseases" (reserved to herbal treatment) and "supernatural diseases" (reserved to shamanic cure) has been discussed, as well as a partial overlapping between both
categories [71]. Among the Ashéninka, such distinction
does not make sense. The illnesses are essentially the
same. What differs are the forms of treatment and their
degrees of efficiency. The choice depends on the seriousness of the disease, but both herbalism and shamanism
address similar issues and are embedded in one and the
same rationality. This peculiar rationality was precisely
my central concern. The successive steps of the analysis
could be summarized as following.
First, the analysis of the regional interethnic borrowing
system has demonstrated the crucial opposition between
material substances and interpersonal relationships. I
have shown that Western scientists and indigenous stakeholders do not apply the same criteria to assess ethnobotanical knowledge. For the former, a medicinal plant is an
object, and the focus is on its objective, material effect. For
the latter, a plant is a being, and its therapeutic efficiency
is expected from its special relationship with definite
human groups.
In the 2nd section ("Who is a good healer?"), the relational
dimension has appeared to be a priority in all fields of
Ashéninka ethnomedicine. It involves relationships with
animal and plant species as well as human beings. It

Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:49

defines the superior healer's status of the shaman, as a specialist in relationships with other beings, and is the reason
why a shaman does not necessarily need to know a wide
range of medicinal plants. Even herbal treatment, which
at first sight relies on material effects of plant substances,
is embedded in an underlying relational dimension,
deemed to be critical for its actual efficiency.
Material effects are embedded in relationships. However,
I have also shown that it does not mean some priority of
a "spirit" or "soul" dimension. Even the shaman is
deemed to act directly on the body, since the Ashéninka
conceive the link between bodily materiality and subjective innerness quite differently from Western thought.
I have illustrated this point in the 3rd section, by reviewing
the many forms of healing I met and was told about. This
review outlines a world of general predation. All species of
beings feed on each other (all of them have a body,
including the "spirits" and "souls"), which is the mainspring of life, of growth, health and illness, and of death.
Predation, body nurturing and body shifting
Both Ashéninka herbalism and shamanism perfectly fit in
with these views. Rather than two specialized, separate
fields of healing, they form two distinct expressions of the
same issues. General predation in a world of limited
resources of substances and energy may indeed be
expressed in two ways.

The first one is through shamanic language of disembodiment/re-embodiment. Predation (or illness: you are ill
because another kind of living being is feeding on you) is
then a sudden shift of your body towards the perspective
(or the shape: it is exactly the same indeed) of this harmful other being. If you are not a shaman, you cannot see it
immediately – and that is why the shaman's knowledge is
a superior one: His ability for controlled temporary disembodiment gives him outstanding skills in diagnosing,
and also in healing the more severe cases, when the only
effective intervention is direct work on the overall shape
of ill people.
By contrast, if you are just an ordinary Ashéninka person,
you do not have access to such a vision and aetiological
treatment, but you see the problem from outside, as it is
expressed in the second healing (or body) language,
namely the symptomatic one. Ill people become progressively sick and thin, substances are going slowly out of
their body (another kind of living being is feeding on
them: it is exactly the same). It is a view from outside, of
course, but you also know about the other theory. If the
symptoms are obvious, if the ailment is limited, and if you
are a good herbalist, you can guess what is happening, and
go to the forest in search of the suitable medicinal plants.

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

Maybe they will be strong enough to fight against the
harmful predator – it is a process you will see from your
outer symptomatic point of view, as an addition of vegetal
substance counterbalancing the loss induced by the illness.
This second expression of health, illness and body dynamics is obviously less thoroughgoing than the first one (at
least among the Ashéninka), but usually it is sufficient to
satisfy the needs of everyday life and use. When a snake
bites you, the reason of the problem is obvious enough: as
mentioned, you pay your debt to the perspectivist theory
killing the snake, and then you look for the suitable
medicinal plants. When you want to make preventive
medicine or to cure little ailments of your children, you
give them leaf baths: you know perfectly that these kinds
of leaves are against specific cannibal beings ("spirits") of
the forest, but you do not need to access their peculiar
point of view, you are just "strengthening the body" of
your children – and so forth. The shaman uses his personal skills in perceiving foreign bodily perspectives to
intervene directly in the overall network of all living
beings, involving men, plants, animals and spirits. Ordinary people acknowledge the same conceptual framework
but confine their therapeutic action to a mere symptomatic level.
Nevertheless, there is a problem of coexistence and hierarchy. Shamanic knowledge is deemed to be much more
thoroughgoing, but in fact, the ordinary people's symptomatic approach, closely related to the concept of "body
nurturing" [86], works as an alternative folk theory.
Among the Ashéninka, it might appear as consistent as the
shamanic approach. It refers to the idea of a continuous
construction of the body that we also find in the many
dietary prescriptions and proscriptions. Every kind of living being feeds on some other ones, but has to do so very
carefully. Substances are circulating from one being to
another, but that is precisely why they are not just inert
stuff – in whole Amazonia, it is particularly conspicuous
in the couvade rituals [87,88]. There are risks of unbalance
or contamination, especially on the most sensitive
moments of change: birth and infant's growth, convalescence, shamanic training...
Among the Ashéninka, nevertheless, this theory of continuous body nurturing is less emphasized than the other
one, namely perspectivism as a theory of sudden body
shifting. Dietary prescriptions and proscriptions are often
partially disregarded. The stronger prohibitions are
related to behaviour rather than food, and to alien perspectives rather than powerful substances. As an example,
the Ashéninka avoid very carefully looking at some animal
species deemed to be mirítse, literally "orphan", like the
anaconda or the giant anteater: if you do so, somebody of

Page 16 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:49

your close kin will die (you fell in this orphan's point of
view). Even in the case of recent birth, which in other parts
is the most typical moment for body nurturing prohibitions, the main danger is with perspective shifting as
much as with substances contamination. If the parents
walk in the forest without protecting themselves (by spitting the juice of a specific "piri-piri" bulb on their own
feet), some animal species, especially no-venomous little
snakes called torótse and shonkishonkítse (n.i.), will smell
their trail (without touching their feet), so that later the
newborn's "soul" follows them.
Both body nurturing and body shifting are crucial topics
in Amazonia. They entail varying indigenous statements
and practices, but both seem to be found side by side everywhere in the region. At the moment, I suspect that they
are working as two competing integrative conceptual/perceptual schemata, neither really opposite nor really complementary (the first one refers to temporal continuity,
the second one to species discontinuity). Among the
Ashéninka, body nurturing is encompassed by the body
shifting model, but the balance between both seems to be
quite different amongst each ethnic group. For instance,
by sharp contrast with the Ashéninka, some of their neighbours seem to stress much more on the other explanatory
model: the body nurturing, as a circulation of substances
among the Kulina [4], or as an accumulation of embodied
knowledge among the Cashinahua [5].
Perhaps a good question to ask would be which model
encompasses the other in each case. As suggested by the
Ashéninka example, essential criteria for assessing this
issue should be the trend to emphasize one kind or other
of aetiological explanations, and (on the other side of the
coin) the trend to respect more carefully one kind or other
of dietary or behavioural prescriptions and prohibitions.
Beyond the Ashéninka specific case, the point probably
calls for further research.

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/49

I am also particularly grateful to the Ashéninka, with whom I carried out my
own three years of personal field research. They are usually deemed to be
very reserved. By contrast, I have been impressed by their exceptional
open-mindedness, kindness and generosity.
