Abstract
Background: Various evolutionary models have been proposed to interpret the fate of paralogous duplicates, which
provides substrates on which evolution selection could act. In particular, domestication, as a special selection, has
played important role in crop cultivation with divergence of many genes controlling important agronomic traits.
Recent studies have indicated that a pair of duplicate genes was often sub-functionalized from their ancestral
functions held by the parental genes. We previously demonstrated that the rice cell-wall invertase (CWI) gene GIF1 that
plays an important role in the grain-filling process was most likely subjected to domestication selection in the
promoter region. Here, we report that GIF1 and another CWI gene OsCIN1 constitute a pair of duplicate genes with
differentiated expression and function through independent selection.
Results: Through synteny analysis, we show that GIF1 and another cell-wall invertase gene OsCIN1 were paralogues
derived from a segmental duplication originated during genome duplication of grasses. Results based on analyses of
population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1
was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1
that was selected in the promoter region. GIF1 and OsCIN1 have evolved into different expression patterns and
probable different kinetics parameters of enzymatic activity with the latter displaying less enzymatic activity.
Overexpression of GIF1 and OsCIN1 also resulted in different phenotypes, suggesting that OsCIN1 might regulate other
unrecognized biological process.
Conclusion: How gene duplication and divergence contribute to genetic novelty and morphological adaptation has
been an interesting issue to geneticists and biologists. Our discovery that the duplicated pair of GIF1 and OsCIN1 has
experienced sub-functionalization implies that selection could act independently on each duplicate towards different
functional specificity, which provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop. Our results also
further support the established hypothesis that gene duplication with sub-functionalization could be one solution for
genetic adaptive conflict.
Background
Gene duplication has long been recognized to be an
important way to provide a substrate on which evolution
acts. The classical models that predict the most possible
fate of one of the duplicate genes is to degenerate to a

pseudogene or get lost from the genome due to vagaries
of chromosomal remodeling, locus deletion or point
mutation [1-5]. A less frequent fate of the duplicate genes
is to gain a new function (neo-functionalization) when
the other copy still maintains its original function. However, recent studies have indicated that the newly duplicated genes are often sub-functionalized from their
ancestral functions held by the parental genes [6-8]. The
sub-functionalization model (also referred to as duplica-

tion-degeneration-complementation model) explains that
the duplicate genes are maintained in the genome relying
on complementary degenerative changes in a pair of
duplicate genes, such that the duplicate genes together
retain the original functions of their single ancestor [15,9]. During this process, the expression domain shifting
is the most common character of duplicate genes. As a
consequence, the duplicates acquired sub-functionalization and then were less constrained by selection than the
single ancestor, which had to maintain the capacity to fulfill all functions. Therefore, selection could act independently on each duplicate and increase the gene function
specificity [10].
Sequence variation plays an essential role in functional
renovation of genes, however, the relationship between
DNA variation and functional consequence has been
enigmatic for the vast majority of genes in plant and animal kingdoms, despite an increasing number of studies
have been reported. Crop species and their wild relatives
with available genome information are becoming fascinating subjects for study of correlation between cryptic
genetic variation and functional evolution, because they
have undergone rapid diversification under intense artificial selection [11-14]. Therefore, investigating crop
domestication genes will shed meaningful light on
genetic variation that drives cultivation adaptation [15].
Rice was used by human about 11,000 years ago [16,17]. It
has been indicated that the divergence of indica and
japonica predated rice domestication, suggesting that at
least two genetically distinct gene pools of O. rufipogon
were cultivated and subsequently domesticated [18-20].
During the long-term cultivation and domestication, tremendous diversity in rice has been selected by human,
adapting to various ecosystems and agricultural management, in addition to high yielding characteristics, such as
grain number and weight [12,17].
Various evolutionary models have been proposed to
interpret the fate of paralogous duplicates, but little is
known about the mechanisms of evolutionary change in
duplicate genes leading to functional novelty. Rice has
been recognized as a cereal model for such a study, and
recent studies have discovered that some rice genes have
undergone adaptive evolution under domestication selection [17,21]. We previously reported that the rice grainfilling gene GIF1 (OsCIN2) encoding a cell wall invertase
(CWI) was most likely subjected to domestication selection [22]. Here, we report that GIF1 and another CWI
gene OsCIN1 constitute a pair of duplicate genes with differentiated expression and function. Population genetic
analysis showed that the two genes have experienced
strong domestication selection, and interestingly, the target of selection in the GIF1 gene is the promoter region
and that in OsCIN1 is the coding region.

Results
Evolution of GIF1 and OsCIN1 by gene duplication

Rice genome has a CWI family consisting of eight members [23,24]. Our previous study has demonstrated that
GIF1 is a member of the gene family and required for
assimilated carbon partitioning during early grain-filling
[22]. A phylogenetic analysis of the known plant CWI
genes and predicted CWI genes from the recently
released maize and sorghum genomes showed that
OsCIN1, located on chromosome 2, is highly similar to
GIF1 located on chromosome 4 (Figure 1A). Genetic distance based on amino acid substitutions also indicated
that OsCIN1 is most closely related to GIF1 (Additional
file 1). To gain insight into their evolutionary relationship,
the 500-kb flanking sequences of the GIF1 and OsCIN1
regions were compared. The other eight expressed genes
flanking the GIF1 gene on chromosome 4 show good
colinearity to the eight counterparts of the OsCIN1
region on chromosome 2 (Figure 1B and Additional file
2). The result indicated that GIF1 and OsCIN1 rose via
duplication of a genomic block, which could be as large as
15 Mb (data not shown). As shown in Figure 1A, phylogenetic analysis including cell-wall invertases of Zea mays,
Sorghum bicolor, Lolium perenne, Hordeum vulgare, Dendrocalamopsis oldhamii and Oryza sativa showed that
GIF1 was closer to cell-wall invertases of Zea mays, Hordeum vulgare and Dendrocalamopsis oldhamii, suggesting that this duplication might occur during the genome
duplication of grasses [25]. By directly using synonymous
substitution rate between the two paralogs (Ks = 0.57),
and assuming the neutral evolutionary rate of rice genes
(~6.5 × 10-9substitutions per silent site per year) [26,27],
we estimated the time of duplication between GIF1 and
OsCIN1 about 44 million years ago (MYA), a time much
earlier than the genus Oryza diversified from a common
ancestor about 15 MYA [28]. However, this estimated
duplication age could be invalid because the regions were
likely selected during rice domestication (see below).
To investigate the evidence for functional constraint on
both copies at the DNA sequence level, we calculated Ka
(non-synonymous substitution rate)/Ks ratios between
GIF1, OsCIN1 and their homologs in maize, respectively
[27]. The respective Ka/Ks value of GIF1 and OsCIN1 are
0.275 and 0.168 (p = 4.13E-24, p = 1.92E-50) (Table 1),
suggesting strong purifying selection.
Sub-functionalization of GIF1 and OsCIN1 by expression
differentiation

Duplicate genes can be maintained by sub-functionalization (the duplicate genes perform different aspects of the
original gene's function), or neo-functionalization (one of
the genes acquires a novel function), and may facilitate
adaptation to environmental change [6-9]. Our previous
research has indicated that other CINs, including

Here we further compared the expression patterns of
GIF1 and OsCIN1 in different tissues and grain-filling
stages. GIF1 transcripts were detected in roots, elongating internodes, shoots and panicles, but not in leaves. In
contrast, OsCIN1 was expressed strongly in leaves, but
weakly in elongating internodes (Figure 2A). During the
early grain-filling stage, OsCIN1 transcript levels
remained high while GIF1 transcript levels decreased
after 15 days post-pollination (DAP) (Figure 2B). In situ
hybridization experiments further showed that the GIF1
transcript was only detected in the ovular vascular tissue
but not in the pericarp and endosperm [22]; in contrast,
the OsCIN1 transcript was detected in both the pericarp
and endosperm [29]. Consistent with the difference in
their expression pattern, GIF1 was induced in the caryopses supplied with sugars, but OsCIN1 was inducible in
the leaves treated with sucrose and pathogen [23]. These
results evidently showed that GIF1 and OsCIN1 have differentiated in expression pattern after duplication
through altering expression patterns in development and
response to environment cues.

Sub-functionalization of GIF1 and OsCIN1 enzymes

Total activity of cell-wall invertases was reduced to 17%
of the wild-type in the gif1 mutant [22], indicating that
GIF1 contributes to the majority of cell-wall invertase
activity in early developing grains, although OsCIN1 was
also expressed at a higher level in developing grains (Figure 2B). In support of this observation, the OsCIN1 TDNA 'knockout' mutant did not show significant defect
in grain filling and weight (J. -S. JEON, personal communication). To further determine the functional differentiation of the GIF1 and OsCIN1enzymes, we developed
transgenic plants GIF1-OE [22] and CIN1-OE constitutively expressing GIF1 and OsCIN1 driven by the 35S promoter (Figure 3A). GIF1-OE plants exhibited significantly
higher CWI activity than that of CIN1-OE plants
although the latter accumulated higher OsCIN1 levels
(Figure 3A and 3B). These results suggested that GIF1
and OsCIN1 could have different kinetics parameters
such as Km and Vmax.
The difference in the kinetics parameters of enzymatic
activity might result from the amino acid substitutions, in
particular the GIF1 and OsCIN1 proteins contain Ala and
Gly residues in the NDPNG domain (motif ), respectively
(Figure 3C). Phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure 1A and
3C) revealed that the Gly-26-Ala substitution occurred
after the GIF1 and OsCIN1 duplication. The crystal structure of the Arabidopsis CWI indicated that the conserved
NDPNG domain is critical for CWI activity [30-32].
However, GIF1 and the homologous maize Mn1 contain a
NDPNA motif instead of the NDPNG motif that presents
in OsCIN1 and other CWIs, suggesting that the segmental duplication predates maize and rice differentiation.
Furthermore, the crystal structure showed that Asp-239
interacted with Lys-242 and both the two amino acids
played a crucial role in the transfructosylation process
and interacted via H-bonds with the bound substrate
[32]. A Thr-241-Arg substitution in the Asp-239/Lys-242
region occurred in GIF1 as well as in Mn1. It is noteworthy that the mutation in the Mn1 gene also caused shrunk
grains [33]. The synteny between the GIF1 and Mn1
genome regions suggested that they could be orthologues
(Additional file 3). These structure differences might contribute to different enzymatic kinetics of the GIF1 and
OsCIN1 proteins. Together, these results suggested that
GIF1 and OsCIN1 were subjected to sub-functionalization, or that GIF1 (probable Mn1 too) might have neo-

function of the CWIs.
Different phenotypes of GIF1-OE and CIN1-OE plants
support sub-functionalization of GIF1 and OsCIN1

To further confirm functional divergence of GIF1 and
OsCIN1, we determined the phenotypes of GIF1-OE and
CIN1-OE plants. In addition to producing shrunken
grains (Figure 4A and 4C), GIF1-OE plants were also

dwarfed in comparison with wild-type plants (Figure 4E).
By contrast, CIN1-OE plants did not exhibit any obvious
phenotype in grain-filling and plant development (Figure
4B and 4F). Instead, the CIN1-OE seeds exhibited
marked preharvest sprouting in 6 of 10 transgenic lines
tested, which expressed high OsCIN1 levels (Figure 4D
and data not shown), a phenomenon never occurring to
the wild-type japonica control. These observations suggest that OsCIN1 might indirectly modulating hormone

signaling pathways through interfering sugar metabolism
in seed germination, leading to preharvest sprouting,
since the sugar regulates rice alpha amylase (34).
Together, our results demonstrate that GIF1 and OsCIN1
have evolved differentially or most likely sub-functionalized after duplication.
Evidence of OsCIN1 domestication-selection

In the previous study, we analyzed artificial selection
using the segment sequences of GIF1. Here we further
analyzed the 2-kb promoter region of GIF1 in 25 cultivars
and 25 wild rice germplasm (AA genome) (Table 2). We
identified nine types of promoter sequences (Figure 5A).
According to the promoter sequences, nearly all culti-

vated rice was classified into type 1, further supporting
that the GIF1 promoter was artificially selected during
rice domestication.
We further sequenced two BACs containing respective
OsCIN1 and GIF1 of the BB-genome of wild rice (O.
punctata), and found that the coding region of OsCIN1
contains more variation than the coding region of GIF1 in
comparison with the reference AA genome sequences
(Additional file 4) [28,35], probably suggesting that
OsCIN1 and GIF1 might have experienced different
selection during Oryza evolution. To carefully investigate
the evolution pattern of the OsCIN1 gene, we sequenced
the OsCIN1 genome regions of the same set of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice germplasm (Table 2). Results

showed that the silent-site nucleotide, θπ, of OsCIN1 in
japonica and indica were 0.0025 and 0.0038, respectively,
lower than θπ (0.0097) in wild rice; and also much lower
than the genome average θπ (0.0052 and 0.0073) in japonica and indica, respectively (Figure 5C and Additional file
5). Furthermore, the Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade (HKA)
test detected a highly significant deviation of OsCIN1
from neutrality for cultivated rice compared with the
ADH1 gene (p = 5.89871E-11) [36], using O. punctata as
an outgroup (Table 3). The negative deviation in Tajima's
D was also consistent with a selective sweep at the
OsCIN1 locus in both japonica and indica, but no such a
pattern was observed in wild rice (Figure 5D and Additional file 5). These results suggest the OsCIN1 gene

might also have been artificially selected. We also estimated genetic variation in upstream and downstream
regions of OsCIN1 in the cultivars and wild rice genomes,
and found that the region under selective sweep may
extend as long as ~100-Kb. We further constructed a
gene tree using 4.6-kb gene regions of OsCIN1 from the
cultivars and wild rice (Figure 6A). Consequently, all the
japonica and indica accessions formed a cluster in the
gene tree, in considerable contrast to a genome tree (Figure 6B) established based on SNP data [37,38], suggesting
OsCIN1 introgression from one subspecies into another
subspecies after domestication-selection, although our
data could not rule out the possibility that OsCIN1 was
extensively selected during rice domestication indepen-

dently in the two subspecies. All the results strongly support the hypothesis that OsCIN1 was selected during rice
domestication. However, how the OsCIN1 gene has
played a role in domestication is still unknown.
To narrow down the selection target in the OsCIN1
gene, we examined all the variations in the OsCIN1
genome regions, and found that an amino acid substitution (Arg-212-Leu) almost fixed in the rice cultivars, indicating that, unlike GIF1 which was selected in the
promoter region, this site in the coding region could be
the target of artificial selection in the OsCIN1 gene (Figure 5B). Further functional characterization of this site
will provide more evidence to address how this site has
contributed to OsCIN1 function in cultivated rice.

Discussion
Gene duplication and adaptive conflict

Gene duplication plays a fundamental role in organism
evolution by providing genetic materials from which
novel functions can arise. Large numbers of duplicate
genes were found in genomes, which contributed greatly
to the genome structure and function evolution [1-5,39].
In general, the duplicate genes have two fates: first, the
duplicate gene lost its function due to chromosome
remodeling, deletion, and point mutation (known as nonfunctionalization); second, the duplicate gene retained
for the maintenance of ancestral functions [1-5]. According to adaptive conflict model, adaptive mutations could
be prohibited in the case of multifunctional genes, or one
mutation that can optimize one function, may compromise the other functions, this mutation will be prohibited
[6,40]. The adaptive conflict could be solved by sub-functionalization of duplicate genes. In this case, the duplicate
genes would be less constrained and be able to evolve
new functions under selection [41,42]. With this scenario,
it is common that one gene could have multifunction in
nature [40,43].
Independent selection of GIF1 and OsCIN1 mutations

The sequenced genomes of Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis
thaliana and Populus trichocarpa all contain a family of
cell wall invertases [44-46], some members of these gene

families were reported to be involved in growth and
development, disease resistance, stress responses and cell
death, suggesting that the CWI gene families might have
undergone sub- or neo-functionalized in these species.
Through genomic synteny analysis, we showed that
GIF1 and OsCIN1 derived from a segmental duplication
from an ancestor, most likely during genome duplication
in grass species. After duplication, GIF1 and OsCIN1
have evolved to gain divergent functions with different
expression patterns and enzymatic kinetics parameters
through accumulating mutations in cultivated rice. In
contrast to GIF1 on which domestication selection
mainly occurred in the cis-regulatory region (Figure 5A),
the artificial selection occurred mainly in the coding
region of OsCIN1 (Figure 5B). Therefore, both GIF1 and
OsCIN1 were most likely subjected to domestication
selection, resulting in a cultivated GIF1 locus for better
harvest, although the biological importance of OsCIN1 in
domestication remains enigmatic. With this scenario,
GIF1 and OsCIN1 may provide a good genetic model to
demonstrate how duplicate genes could evolve and be
artificially selected independently during crop domestication with divergent functions derived from accumulation of mutations in the regulatory and coding regions
respectively, adding to those systems reported [47,48].
Differential biological functions of GIF1 and OsCIN1

GIF1 is mainly expressed in seed vascular tissues and
controls sucrose unloading for starch synthesis at the
early grain-filling stage [22]. Overexpression of the GIF1
gene produced plants with marked defects both in grainfilling and development, indicating that over-activity of
the GIF1 enzyme disrupts sugar homeostasis, a process
important to normal grain and plant development. In
contrast, OsCIN1 has lower CWI activity compared to
GIF1 in the transgenic plants (Figure 3). Consistent with
this, no obvious phenotype was observed in CIN1-OE
plants except pre-harvest sprouting (Figure 4). Interestingly, OsCIN1 might be involved in pathogen defense and
stress response [23]. It has been reported that sugars
interact with signaling pathways mediated by phytohormones such as GA and ABA during seed germination and

seedling development [34,49], which are also involved in
stress responses. Preharvest sprouting of the CIN1-OE
seeds may implicate a role for OsCIN1 in sugar-mediated
alpha amylases activation [34]. However, detailed experiments are needed to dissect the OsCIN1 function.

Conclusion
Gene duplication and functional divergence contribute
greatly to genetic novelty and adaptive evolution. However, molecular basis of selection and functionalization of

duplicate genes remains largely unknown. Based on a set
of data including population genetic analysis, fine
sequencing of wild rice BACs, phenotyping of transgenic
plants and analysis of gene expression and enzymatic
activity, we provide a line of evidence that the two rice
CWI genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 are a pair of duplicate
genes and have been subjected to sub-functionalization
during evolution or domestication selection. Therefore,
duplicate genes could be independently selected towards
different functional specificity, either on promoter for

different expression pattern or on coding region for different protein function/activity. Our study provides a
vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a
model crop. The interesting phenotype of preharvest
sprouting OsCIN1-OE plants suggests that OsCIN1 overaccumulation might disturb sugar balance during seed
germination.

Methods
Duplication and synteny analysis

The 500-kb radiuses of the GIF1 and OsCIN1 regions
were scanned for homologous pairs. A homolog pair was
defined as a single nr-KOME cDNA and its blastn
homolog. A total of 18 homologous genes in both sides of
the GIF1 and OsCIN1 loci were compared to establish
linearity.
Sequencing and evolution analysis

To investigate the selective forces acting on GIF1 and
OsCIN1 on the molecular evolution scale, we estimated
the statistic Ka/Ks using the re-sequencing data (see
below) and the maize Mn1 and Incw1-1 as the outgroup
sequence, where Ka was the number of nonsynonymous
substitutions per nonsynonymous site and Ks was the
number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous
site [27]. Ka/Ks values significantly less than 1 were often
taken as evidence of constraint. The mean Ks of nine pair
homolog genes, including GIF1 and other eight genes
(Additional file 2), in the GIF1 and OsCIN1 regions were
used to estimate the duplication time. Two BAC clones of
O. punctata (BB genome) from the OMAP project http://
www.omap.org/ containing GIF1 and OsCIN1 respectively, were sequenced.
Analysis of OsCIN1 and GIF1 domestication

We deeply analyzed the OsCIN1 and GIF1 sequences
from the re-sequenced genomes of 25 rice cultivars and
25 wild rice germplasm (Table 2), which has been done in
Dr. Wen Wang's group, using Solexa technology (data not
shown). Haplotype diversity was calculated for nucleotide
diversity (π), and Tajima's D- statistics were calculated
with DnaSP version 4.0. The gene tree was created using
MEGA software [50]. The sequences then were aligned.
The 2-kb up-/downstream genome sequences and the
GIF1, OsCIN1 coding sequences were used for HKA test
as described [36]. Sequences from wild rice O. punctata
(BB genome) from the OMAP project http://
www.omap.org/ were used as outgroups for the HKA
test. The DNA phylogenetic tree was constructed by
neighbor-joining method using MEGA. The known or
predicted CWI genes with high sequence similarity to
GIF1 from Oryza sativa, Lolium perenne, Hordeum vulgare, Dendrocalamopsis oldhamii and the recently

Page 11 of 13

released Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor genomes were
used in this study.
Development and growth of OsCIN1-OE transgenic plants

The full-length OsCIN1 coding sequence was PCRamplified from ZH11 cDNA by using the primers 5'TCTAGTACAAAACAATGGGGACTC-3'
and
5'CGGAAAACCTCTTTATTATCTGTA-3'. The amplified fragment was subsequently cloned into the vector
35S-C1301 and transformed into ZH11 to generate 25
independent ectopic expression lines as described [22].
All transgenic materials were assayed in the second (T1)
or third (T2) generations with 10-24 sibling plants grown
in the paddy field to ensure agronomic traits.
Invertase activity assay

The caryopses were ground in the extraction buffer, and
the extraction was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min. The
pellet was washed twice then re-suspended in the extraction buffer. Insoluble invertase activity was assayed as
described [22].
RNA preparation and analysis

Total RNA was prepared from rice tissues using TRIzol
reagent according to the manufacture's protocol (GIBCO
BRL). For RT-PCR, 1-5 ug total RNA was used for the
first-strand cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript III System (Invitrogen). RT-PCR analysis of GIF1 and OsCIN1
was performed with the primers [22,23].
Accession numbers

All sequences have been deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers GU797900-GU798049.
