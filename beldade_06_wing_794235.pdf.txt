Abstract
Background: Butterfly wing color patterns are a key model for integrating evolutionary
developmental biology and the study of adaptive morphological evolution. Yet, despite the
biological, economical and educational value of butterflies they are still relatively under-represented
in terms of available genomic resources. Here, we describe an Expression Sequence Tag (EST)
project for Bicyclus anynana that has identified the largest available collection to date of expressed
genes for any butterfly.
Results: By targeting cDNAs from developing wings at the stages when pattern is specified, we
biased gene discovery towards genes potentially involved in pattern formation. Assembly of 9,903
ESTs from a subtracted library allowed us to identify 4,251 genes of which 2,461 were annotated
based on BLAST analyses against relevant gene collections. Gene prediction software identified
2,202 peptides, of which 215 longer than 100 amino acids had no homology to any known proteins
and, thus, potentially represent novel or highly diverged butterfly genes. We combined gene and
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) identification by constructing cDNA libraries from pools of
outbred individuals, and by sequencing clones from the 3' end to maximize alignment depth.
Alignments of multi-member contigs allowed us to identify over 14,000 putative SNPs, with 316
genes having at least one high confidence double-hit SNP. We furthermore identified 320
microsatellites in transcribed genes that can potentially be used as genetic markers.
Conclusion: Our project was designed to combine gene and sequence polymorphism discovery
and has generated the largest gene collection available for any butterfly and many potential markers
in expressed genes. These resources will be invaluable for exploring the potential of B. anynana in
particular, and butterflies in general, as models in ecological, evolutionary, and developmental
genetics.

Background
The last decade has witnessed an increased effort at bringing together methods and ideas from evolutionary and
developmental biology (evo-devo) to explore the genetic
basis of morphological diversity [1-7]. Understanding the
genetic bases of phenotypic variation is a fundamental
challenge for evo-devo and for contemporary biology in
general [8]. The color patterns on butterfly wings are a
spectacular example of morphological variation, and have
been established as an important system in the study of
evolution and development [9-11]. These patterns, which
vary both across and within species, are ecologically relevant and often have a known adaptive value, including
amazing examples of mimicry [9,12-14] and adaptive
phenotypic plasticity [15-17]. They have also been the
object of developmental studies at different levels, including the genetic pathways involved in pattern formation,
the physiological basis of pattern plasticity, and the biochemical pathways leading to pigment production
(reviewed in [9,10]).
Bicyclus anynana has been established as a butterfly laboratory model which is well suited to address important
questions in ecological, evolutionary and developmental
genetics [9-11,18,19]. The study of B. anynana wing patterns has already made important contributions to evodevo (reviewed in [10]). The patterns of phenotypic and
genotypic variation in different eyespot traits have been
explored within and across species [20-25], and a number
of developmental pathways known from D. melanogaster
wing development have been implicated in butterfly color
pattern formation [15,26-29]. More recently, we have
shown that candidate genes within these pathways can
contribute to between-individual variation in wing pattern in B. anynana butterflies [19,30].
Knowledge from D. melanogaster wing development studies has undoubtedly greatly advanced our understanding
of butterfly wing pattern formation. Yet, despite the power
of this approach, it is limited in that it does not generate
candidate genes outside known Drosophila wing genes.
Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Diptera are
highly diverged and butterfly and dipteran wings are quite
different (e.g., dipterans have a single pair of wings and no
colored scales covering them). It thus seems unlikely that
all the genes involved in butterfly wing pattern formation
will be genes known from Drosophila wing development
[19]. Clearly, a more unbiased search for pattern variation
candidate genes is necessary to understand fully butterfly
wing color evolution and development. Unfortunately,
genomic resources in Lepidoptera are scarce, even though
this order of holometabolous insects encompasses over
160,000 species, including many of economical importance (e.g., pollinators, agricultural pests, and silk producers). Most available information concerns the silkworm,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/130

Bombyx mori [31], with recently published expression
sequence tag [32,33] and whole-genome shotgun [34,35]
projects. Other moths (e.g., [36]) are not nearly as well
studied and genomic resources for butterflies are scarcer
still, despite ongoing expansion of gene collections for
Heliconius [37]. Developing such resources is a fundamental step towards a detailed analysis of the genetic bases
and consequences of some unusual biological properties
of lepidopterans (e.g., heterogametic females, holocentric
chromosomes, and derived wing color patterns), as well
as those that distinguish butterflies from moths (e.g., diurnal life style and color vision [38]).
Important recent advances for B. anynana genomic
resources include an ongoing project to build and analyze
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome libraries, the development of germline transformation techniques to enable
functional analysis of candidate genetic regions [39], and
the characterization of 28 polymorphic microsatellites
including a female-specific marker [40]. Until now, however, only twelve either partial or full-length coding
sequences from B. anynana had been deposited in GenBank. As a way to identify a large number of genes for this
species quickly and efficiently, we carried out an Expression Sequence Tag (EST) project. EST projects are a costeffective and powerful way to identify a large number of
expressed genes in any species [41,42], especially those
without a genome project, and have been used in many
different systems (e.g., [43-47]). Furthermore, many
"downstream" applications stem from EST projects,
including genome annotation, and the development of
both high-density expression arrays, and gene-based
genetic markers [42,48].
Here, we describe a B. anynana EST project in which we
identify over 4,000 unique genes (or UniGenes) expressed
in developing butterfly wings, together with DNA
sequence polymorphisms in many of the more highly
expressed transcripts. Our project was designed to maximize the likelihood of characterizing genes important in
wing pattern formation and simultaneously identify polymorphisms in a fraction of these genes. The results
described here characterize the most extensive EST/gene
resource publicly available for any butterfly species. This
collection will be the basis to build a gene-based linkage
map and gene expression arrays for B. anynana butterflies,
and will be of great utility in comparative genomics in the
Lepidoptera.

Results

We processed and assembled a total of 10,159 ESTs from
five different wing libraries (Table 1). These included 16
(~0.2%) of length shorter than 55 bp and 240 (~2%)
which assembled into 166 UniGenes of low complexity

(see Table 1). The other 9,903 EST sequences assembled
into 4,251 UniGenes, of which 2,202 (~52%) were estimated to have coding potential using ESTscan (see Methods and Table 2). Our library subtraction procedure,
based on removing ESTs observed to be at a high frequency in an initial sample of ~2,000 PCR-amplified
inserts (see Methods), enabled us to obtain as many UniGenes with ~10,000 sequence reads as would have been
obtained from ~23,000 clones without subtraction. Figure
1 illustrates EST redundancy in our project. About 70%
(or 2,994) of the UniGenes we identified were singletons
(and are not depicted in Figure 1), and 450 (or ~11%)
resulted from aligning four or more ESTs. The maximum
alignment depth observed was 344 ESTs in one contig.
Multifasta files with the alignments for all multimember
UniGenes are available from [49] as a single compressed
file. Table S3 [see Additional file 3] lists all individual
ESTs of length greater than 54 bp and related information,
including the actual sequence (with letter case indicating
PHRED quality; see Methods), sequence length, ratio of
low quality nucleotides to total length, and the contig into
which they were assembled. Table S4 [see Additional file
4] lists all contigs and all description and annotation
information discussed in this report.
Gene identification
Annotation of the B. anynana wing UniGenes was
achieved through BLAST analyses against a number of different genomic collections. A total of 2,461 UniGenes
(~58%) had a significant BLAST hit against at least one of
the collections used in our analysis (Table 3; see Methods). The Venn diagram of Figure 2a illustrates UniGene

annotation based on available genomic collections that
are most relevant to this project: the model dipteran D.
melanogaster and the silkworm B. mori (the lepidopteran
species with most extensive published collection of
genomic information), and diverse and dispersed collec600

genomic collections phylogenetically most relevant for B. anynana: "Dmel" for D. melanogaster, "Bmori" for the silkworm B.

invertebrate proteins (see Methods and Table 3). About 42%
of our 4,251 UniGenes did not have a significant BLAST hit
for any of these three categories. b) Of the 1,804 genes not
included in the Venn diagram, 14 showed a significant BLAST
hit to at least one of the additional collections analyzed
(details in Table 3 and in the text). The numbers on the left
panel represent BLAST hits to groups of these collections
(with some overlap across the collections).

tebrate collections we defined (Dmel, Bmori, and InvLep;
see Methods), the best BLAST hit was not always to one of
these (Table 3). Fourteen UniGenes had best BLAST hits to
non-nuclear or non-animal gene collections, and for six of
these the ratio between E-values for the overall best BLAST
hit and for the best hit to one of the invertebrate-specific
genes (cf. Figure 2a) was greater than 100. These included
three contigs that appeared to be either non-nuclear genes
(lower hit against "organel.nuc"; contigs 3271, 3438) or
non-coding RNAs (lower hit against "Rfam.nuc"; contig
1740), and three others likely corresponding to material
from bacteria (lower hit against "Ecoli.nuc"; contig 847)
or plants (lower hit against "plant.pro"; contigs 49 and
1172). Both contigs referred to above as "organel.nuc"
actually correspond to chloroplast tRNA and thus add to
the probable contaminants resulting from plant DNA
incorporated in our libraries. This list of probable contaminants is likely to be an under-estimate of the genes
that are not nuclear genes from butterfly wings. Our lepidopteran collection, for example, is an amalgam from
many different independent studies deposited on EMBL
in association to a lepidopteran species and does contain
a number of organelle genes, non-coding RNAs, and
potentially even bacteria and plant contaminants.
Functional annotation
In order to assign putative functional roles to the identified UniGenes, we used the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of D. melanogaster genes. Based on BLAST analysis
against the D. melanogaster collections, we identified
1,249 D. melanogaster genes orthologous to at least one of

our B. anynana transcripts. In addition, our BLAST analyses against the B. mori EST collections, in concert with our
own annotation of the Bombyx mori collection via D. melanogaster, led to the identification of 240 additional D.
melanogaster orthologs not identified by direct comparisons between B. anynana and D. melanogaster (see Methods). The list of 1,489 B. anynana UniGenes with D.
melanogaster orthologs, and the complete collection of
14,187 Drosophila genes retrieved from FlyBase were used
with GOminer [50] to assign GO terms to each B. anynana

(Figure 1). We also counted the number of "double-hit"
SNPs (SNPs with a minor allele count of at least two; see
Methods). These SNPs are much less likely to be errors
generated during library construction than "single-hit"
SNPs but they can only be identified from alignments
with a depth of at least four ESTs. We observed a total of
2,222 double hit SNPs. Of our 450 UniGenes of alignment depth four or greater 316 (~70%) had at least one
"double-hit" SNP and, of these, 272 (~86%) had a significant BLAST hit to at least one of the fields in Table 3. That
is, UniGenes with double-hit SNPs are somewhat highly
expressed and as a result are likely to have some associated
annotation.
We identified 320 di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide
repeat microsatellites in our UniGenes (Table 5) with
minimum repeat thresholds described in the Methods. Of
the identified microsatellites, 73 (23%) were associated
with sequence alignments greater than one, and of these,
ten (14%) were polymorphic in our sample, having up to
seven segregating alleles. Details about the microsatellites
identified are provided in Table S6 [see Additional file 6]
and include the repeat sequence, the number of times it is
repeated, and its location within the host contig sequence.
B. anynana EST database
Apart from all ESTs being deposited in GenBank (Table 1)
and, from there, downloaded into ButterflyBase [37], our
B. anynana EST database is available in two complementary formats. A large flat file [see Additional file 4] suitable
for importation into a local database program and a webaccessible openSputnik version [53]. The openSputnik
version contains a great deal of information for every EST
and every contig and is of the greatest utility for obtaining
much information about a few sequences. The downloadable flat file, on the other hand, is useful for typical simple
queries of many contigs of special interest. The fields in
the flat file include, for each contig: the consensus
sequence and sequence length the predicted protein, the
total number and a list of all constituent ESTs, the best
BLAST hit with E-value lower than 1e-05 (including gene
name, E-value, frame in the case of a BLASTX, and URL to
that gene's description where available) over several gene
collections of interest (cf. Table 3). In the case of BLAST

against the B. mori whole genome collections, we also provide information about the gene location (scaffold and
nucleotide position within). The flat file also includes
"hot links" to the alignments for every non-singleton contig. The openSputnik database, on the other hand, has
extra information available, including the ESTs flagged as
low quality and excluded from the analysis in this report,
a number of supplementary BLAST fields, and UniGene
functional annotations based on mappings of Swissport
and InterPro to GO [54].

Discussion
We carried out an EST project designed to identify a large
number of novel B. anynana genes and additionally identify SNPs in a fraction of those genes. We biased gene discovery towards genes expressed in wing tissue during the
developmental stages when patterns on the wings of butterflies are known to be determined (Table 1). Sequencing
of ~10,000 PCR-amplified clone inserts was carried out in
two rounds, so that highly redundant ESTs identified during the first round could be used in a library-subtraction
scheme aimed at minimizing total EST redundancy.
Assembly of 9,903 ESTs allowed us to identify 4,251 B.
anynana wing disc UniGenes, of which 2,461 were annotated based on BLAST analyses against gene collections
available for other organisms (Table 3). Our alignments
of different natural alleles allowed us to identify SNPs in
many multi-member UniGene contigs (Figure 1). Finally,
we identified 320 potential microsatellites markers in
expressed sequences, with about 23% located in alignments of depth two or greater, and 14% of these being
polymorphic. Overall, our project has generated genomic
resources that will be invaluable for exploring the potential of B. anynana as a model in ecological, evolutionary,
and developmental genetics.
Sequence ESTs from 3' end to facilitate combined gene
and SNP discovery
Using a modified 3' adaptor and modified 3' primer (see
Methods), we introduced "point mutations" in the polyA
tail of the cDNA clones to facilitate sequencing through
this repetitive region. A 3' sequencing effort results mostly
in information about the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs)
of genes, which despite their role in mRNA processing

[55,56], are often not highly conserved and thus do not
BLAST 3' UTRs of other organisms. However, for genes
which have a relatively short 3' UTR, part of the EST
sequence is coding region, allowing for gene identification in many instances. The average size of 3' UTRs in
invertebrates is estimated to be ~300 bp [57], which is
shorter than the average size of our UniGenes (583 bp,
Table 2), but there is much variation around this length.
In our project, 48% of the assembled UniGenes did not
have a predicted peptide (Table 2) suggesting a 3' UTR
longer than the sequence read.
Despite the difficulties of gene annotation associated with
3' UTR reads, the advantages are many-fold. The likelihood of overestimating the number of UniGenes is higher
in 5' projects relative to 3' projects, as cDNA clones are
often not full length and 5' sequencing can result in the
identification of non-overlapping parts of the same gene.
In contrast, except for cases of alternative 3' UTRs or polyadenylation sites [58], all EST sequences for a given UniGene in a 3' project share a common poly-A tail and
generally align. The resulting alignment depths, which are
greater than those typically seen in 5' projects, together
with our deliberate use of outbred individuals for building the cDNA libraries (Table 1), enabled us to identify
SNPs in many of our UniGenes (Figure 1). Finally, the 3'
ends of genes are better features for expression arrays,
since probe labeling for gene expression profiling is typically 3' biased and cross-hybridization amongst gene family members is minimized as 3' UTRs are generally less
conserved than coding regions.
Identifying genes expressed in developing butterfly wings
Our library subtraction protocol enabled us to reduce the
redundancy typical of EST projects so as to maximize the
number of new genes identified and still have alignments
deep enough for polymorphism identification. We have
identified 4,251 B. anynana wing UniGenes of which
2,461 (~58%) had a BLAST hit against at least one of the
genomic collections in our analysis (Table 3).

Although it is possible that the 1,790 genes with no BLAST
hits to any of the collections in Table 3 are unique to butterflies (or B. anynana), it seems more likely that these
UniGenes have read lengths shorter than the length of the
3' UTR (see above) and that the UTR is not conserved to
B. mori (the model lepidopteran organism) or to any
sequence in the lepidopteran collection (Figure 2 and
Table 3). About 74% (1,324) of the UniGenes with no significant BLAST hit in our analysis had no corresponding
predicted protein. Conversely, only 15% of the UniGenes
with predicted proteins failed to have significant BLAST
hits. A collection of 5' reads for our UniGenes and the
growing gene collections available for butterflies will
likely help in identifying additional orthologs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/130

The closest organism to B. anynana with extensive
genomic collections is the moth B. mori, but moths and
butterflies have diverged more than 70 million years ago
[59] and it is conceivable that even coding regions might
not be conserved over such evolutionary distances (e.g.,
[60]). Furthermore, the sometimes spectacular differences
between butterflies and moths in morphology (e.g., color
vision and derived wing patterns in butterflies) and
behavior (e.g., diurnal lifestyle) also argue for the possibility of there being genes in each group with no obvious
homolog in the other. In fact, of the 2,202 peptides predicted from our B. anynana contigs, 215 (~10%) with predicted peptides longer than 100 amino acids had no
significant BLAST hit to any database. Whereas these peptides may represent artifacts from alignment and peptide
prediction algorithms, it is also possible that they correspond to new or highly diverged proteins in butterflies. It
will be interesting in future work to determine whether
these genes have expression patterns suggestive of a role in
wing color patterning and if they are seen in other butterflies.
Heliconius butterflies are phylogenetically closer to B. anynana (both are nymphalids) than B. mori, and have rapidly growing gene collections. All Heliconius genes
deposited in the standard databases at the time of analysis
were included in our lepidopteran and invertebrate collections (see Methods) for gene identification based on
sequence homology (Table 3), but not singled-out for a
separate BLAST analysis. Both Heliconius and B. anynana
collections are incomplete in terms of UniGene number
(~4,200 for B. anynana as reported here or ~5,700 as
assembled in ButterflyBase, and ~3,700 for Heliconius
deposited in ButterflyBase; [37])) and their length (the
vast majority of UniGenes are not full length and whilst B.
anynana ESTs were sequenced from the 3' end, those of
Heliconius are mostly 5'end reads) and thus a separate
analysis is of limited value for gene identification. The
comparison between these nymphalid collections will
become much more valuable as both get larger (see [61])
Gene annotation via homology with D. melanogaster
D. melanogaster is the insect with the largest mass of available information on genome sequence and its functional
characterization. Using these resources can be of great
value for gene identification and characterization of new
insect genomic collections (Table 4). We were able to
attempt a functional annotation of our B. anynana contigs
that BLAST Drosophila either directly or indirectly via Bombyx. Three of the classes of genes annotated based on GO
classifications for Drosophila deserve special reference.

The first class is that of the so-called house-keeping genes
which included 120 structural constituents of ribosomes
(e.g., RpS13, contig 633 in Table S4 additional file 4), and

Page 7 of 16

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:130

4 tubulin genes (e.g., αTub84B, contig 860), as well as
many other genes characteristically expressed at high levels in many cell types. Given that such genes are likely to
be discovered in essentially all EST projects, they may turn
out to be a valuable resource for comparative studies.
Sequence comparisons across lepidopteran species can
provide insight into the molecular evolution of particular
gene families, and might be useful to build a time-calibrated phylogeny for higher lepidopteran taxa [62]. Furthermore, if genes belonging to these classes are added to
genetic maps for several lepidopteran species, we will be
able to further analyze and hopefully confirm the patterns
of synteny in this group (see [63]). Comparing gene order
using traditional linkage mapping-based approaches is
likely to remain the preferred method of synteny inference
in lepidopterans for some time, as lepidopteran genomes
are large by insect standards (often > 400 Mb) and whole
genome shotgun sequencing projects [34,35] have thus
far been difficult to assemble into scaffolds large enough
for chromosome assignment or even small-scale synteny
analysis.
The second class of genes worth highlighting includes
those known to be involved in fly wing development,
which are a priori candidates for contributing to wing pattern formation and variation (e.g., apterous, contig 3182,
and shot, contig 4279). Table 4 lists a number of genetic
developmental pathways in this category, including 21
genes from fly wing disc development, 13 from tracheal
system development, and genes from different signaling
pathways involved in wing development (e.g., Wnt and
Notch pathways, represented for example by nejire, contig
4401, and Notchless, contig 1312). The availability of
sequences for such genes will enable segregation tests to
assess their involvement in pattern development and contribution to pattern variation within and between species
(c.f. [19,30]).
Finally, a third and exciting class of genes we identified
includes those not characteristically expressed in Drosophila wing imaginal discs, which seem to have been
recruited to function during butterfly wing development.
Our B. anynana wing ESTs include 4 genes (Table 4)
known to be involved in eye pigmentation in D. melanogaster (e.g., Henna, contig 4143, and vermillion, contig
406), which likely have been recruited to produce butterfly wing pigmentation [19,64,65]. This discovery illustrates a limitation of generating butterfly wing candidate
genes based solely on D. melanogaster wing development.
Furthermore, it provides yet another exciting example of
the possible co-option of insect-wide developmental
pathways to produce butterfly-specific traits. Wings covered with colorful scales are a morphological novelty in
the Lepidoptera whose development has been shown to
involve a number of genetic pathways known from D.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/130

melanogaster: Formation of particular wing pattern elements relies on pathways involved in overall wing formation in Drosophila [15,26-29], and wing scale production
recruits a pathway from Drosophila bristle development
[66]. Our results illustrate a third potential example of
genetic co-option on butterfly wings, with known pigment genes used in the Drosophila eye also used to color
wings (see also [19,65]).
Sequence polymorphisms in B. anynana wing genes
Sequence quality is of fundamental importance for accurate SNP identification. Historically, DNA sequences associated with EST projects have not included quality scores.
We used lowercase letters for bases with PHRED scores
[67] lower than 20 (i.e. the probability that an uppercase,
high-quality base is called wrong is less than 1% [68]) and
ignored "low quality" bases for SNP analysis. Figure 1
shows that we have identified a large number of SNPs [see
details in Additional file 5]. In fact, all UniGene clusters
with an alignment of depth of six or greater have at least
one SNP. Different explanations can be put forward to
explain this high number. First, there were several steps
where errors could have been introduced during library
construction and amplification, such as the use of reverse
transcriptase during first strand synthesis, or the 22-cycle
exponential amplification of the reverse-transcribed products carried out prior to cloning (see Methods). Such
errors would not necessarily result in low quality bases
and could potentially be identified as SNPs. Secondly,
assembly and alignment algorithms can both over-assemble and misalign, especially when the sequences being
studied are known to harbor SNPs. Incorrect alignments,
combined with possible instances of pseudogenes or gene
duplications in our EST collection will falsely increase
estimates of polymorphism level. Finally, it is possible
that our outbred source population did have polymorphism levels approaching those observed. The levels we
observed are only approximately twice as high as those
generally seen in well-studied populations of D. melanogaster (c.f. [69]), and not inconsistent with the only previous SNP survey in B. anynana [30].

As discussed above, it seems likely that a substantial fraction of the over 14 thousand SNPs identified in 1,111 of
our non-singleton UniGenes (Figure 1) might not be
actual segregating polymorphisms. A conservative estimate of the number of "reliable" SNPs can be made by
only considering "double-hit" SNPs (see Methods) which
are far less likely to be associated with the unreplicable
random errors arising from library construction and clone
amplification. A total of 2,222 "double-hit" SNPs were
identified in 316 of our 450 UniGenes with an alignment
depth of four or greater. Although many of the 11,941
SNPs with a minor allele count equal to one may be true
SNPs, this class is undoubtedly enriched for erroneously

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:130

identified sequence polymorphisms. Furthermore, even if
real, SNPs with an observed minor allele count of one are
of questionable utility, as population genetics theory predicts their expected population frequency to be much
lower than 1/d, where d is the depth of the alignment [70].
Developing genomic resources for B. anynana
The genes and SNPs we identified will be the basis for the
development of important genomic tools for B. anynana,
which will be invaluable in the effort to understand the
genetic basis of variation in butterfly wing patterns and
the evolutionary and developmental processes shaping
that variation.

The DNA sequence polymorphisms identified in our
study will be used to build a high-density linkage map in
which the markers are SNPs in genes expressed in developing wings. Such a map will have added value relative to
a map constructed entirely of anonymous markers, as i)
mapping QTLs to individual genes is often only possible
by testing candidate genes in the interval to which a QTL
is mapped (cf. [71-74]), ii) testing polymorphic markers
in candidate genes for co-segregation with a character of
interest is an efficient way to be able to exclude those
genes as contributing to variation in the character, and iii)
it is possible that synteny among lepidopterans (see [63])
can be used to suggest candidate genes for any QTL
mapped to an interval between two gene-based markers in
maps of different species. Although we have identified
"reliable" SNPs in only a subset of our UniGenes (and not
necessarily those most interesting from the point of view
of development), we now have gene sequence tags for
many developmental candidate genes in which we can
develop markers and determine the relative position on a
linkage map for the 28 chromosomes of B. anynana . We
have also identified 320 microsatellite repeats (Table 5)
which can be tested for polymorphism levels in outbred B.
anynana, and hopefully add to the 28 polymorphic microsatellite loci already characterized in this species [40].
Microsatellites markers have been difficult to develop in
lepidopterans based on traditional methods of screening
gDNA libraries [75] (but see [76,77]). Modest repeat
number microsatellites potentially located within coding
regions, such as those we identified, are likely to be somewhat less polymorphic than gDNA-based microsatellites.
However, markers associated to expressed sequences are
more likely to be useful in other species and in the context
of comparative mapping.
PCR amplicons corresponding to our UniGene set can be
used to generate high-density gene arrays to monitor
changes in gene expression levels associated with different
types of changes in wing pattern phenotype (e.g., from
artificially selected lines, mutant stocks, or sections of
wing discs that fate-map to different adult pattern ele-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/130

ments) [19]. Targeting 3' UTR sequences has important
benefits in relation to creating high-density arrays and
future gene expression experiments. Untranslated regions
diverge very quickly, even within gene families, and thus
cross-hybridization among features on the gene arrays is
less of an issue than when features correspond to protein
coding regions. Moreover, as most current methods of
labeling polyA RNA for gene expression analysis show a
marked drop off in efficiency with distance from the
polyA tail, array features corresponding to 3' UTRs are
more likely to show above background signals after
hybridization with labeled RNA.
Genomic resources for Lepidoptera
The EST resource described here represents the most
extensive collection available for any butterfly species.
Butterflies and moths comprise the order of Lepidoptera
which is a very species-rich order of holometabolous
insects and includes many organisms of great economical
(e.g., agricultural pests) and educational (e.g., butterflies
have long been favorite examples in efforts of stimulating
public understanding of science) value. However,
genomic resources for Lepidoptera are scarce relative their
biological and societal importance. The vast majority of
gene sequence information available for this group come
from recent releases of the silkmoth EST [32,33] and
genome projects [34,35]. Just prior to submission of our
ESTs to GenBank (March 2006), this reference database
had about 131,000 ESTs from B. mori and the rest of all
lepidopterans represented by only about 21,000 ESTs. Of
these, a little over 10,000 were from Papilionoidea (the
"true butterflies") and mostly came from species of the
genus Heliconius whose collection is still growing. Ongoing projects to develop genomic resources in these and
other butterfly species, together with the organized effort
of inventorying such resources in a dedicated database
(ButterflyBase; [37]) will enable exciting comparative
analysis and progress in making the most of this group of
organisms as study targets in various areas of biological
research. EST projects, such as the one described here are,
in the short term, likely to remain the best approach to
genomic analysis in butterflies whose relatively large
genome size (around 400 Mb) renders genome projects
expensive and difficult to assemble.

Conclusion
Color patterns on butterfly wings have already made key
contributions to the effort of integrating evolutionary and
developmental biology in the study of adaptive morphological evolution. Wings patterns are highly diverse, yet
structurally relatively simple (a single cell layer), ecologically relevant, and suited for many levels of genetic and
developmental dissection. Scarcity of genomic resources
in this group of organisms has slowed the deepening of
our detailed understanding of the genetic and develop-

mental mechanisms that underlie the production of diversity in wing patterns. By targeting cDNA from developing
wings at the stages when pattern is specified, the EST
project described here biased gene discovery towards
genes potentially involved in pattern formation. Assembly
of 9,903 ESTs from a subtracted library allowed us to identify 4,251 putative gene objects including 2,461 with
homologs in publicly available gene collections, and over
200 potentially representing novel or highly diverged butterfly genes. Analysis of putative gene function through
Gene Ontology databases identified different classes of
genes, including "housekeeping" genes recurrent in EST
projects, classical wing development genes and also new
candidate genes which are typically not associated with
wing development in the genetic model D. melanogaster.
By targeting cDNA from a large number of outbred butterflies (ensuring representation of different alleles) and
sequencing ESTs from the 3' end (maximizing alignment
depths), our project combined gene discovery with identification of putative markers (including SNPs and microsatellites) in expressed genes.
The genetic resources stemming from the EST project
described here can be used to pursue a detailed understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation, as
well as address fundamental questions in evolutionary
biology. Identified ESTs will aid in the identification of
the specific genes, gene regions, and possibly nucleotides
underlying phenotypic variation of adaptive traits. The
color patterns on B. anynana wings are well suited for an
analysis of different modes of phenotypic variation, enabling the comparison between the basis of variation
within and across species, between standing quantitative
variation and mutants of large effect, and of variation generated by developmental plasticity in relation to environmental cues [19]. This variation can, furthermore, be
explored at different levels of biological organization,
ranging from the genetic pathways involved in trait formation [10] to the ecological relevance of pattern variants
[78-80]. This system provides an excellent opportunity to
address other key issues in evolutionary-developmental
biology, including the evolution of morphological innovations (as are butterfly wing color patterns) and the cooption of existing developmental pathways to produce
such new phenotypes.

Methods
Butterfly developing wings
Wing discs were dissected from developing butterflies
sampled from a large (minimum of 400 adults each generation) outbred stock of B. anynana ([40,81,82]) maintained in the laboratory at the University of Leiden and
used in a series of artificial selection experiments to produce divergent wing phenotypes [21-23,83,84].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/130

We dissected both fore- and hindwing discs from developing butterflies at 5 different stages: 5th instar larva (5TH),
crawler (when the 5th instar larvae stops feeding and
crawls up the host plant to pupate) and pre-pupae (CPP),
and male and female pupae at 24 h (24H), 48 h (48H),
and 72 h (72H) after pupation (Table 1). Dissections were
carried out in cold PBS, and dissected wing discs were
immediately placed in RNAlater (AMBION) and stored
following the manufacturer's recommendations until
RNA extraction.
Wing cDNA libraries
Total RNA was isolated using TriZol reagent (INVITROGEN), quantified in a spectrophotometer, and its quality
verified in agarose gel. cDNA libraries were created using
CLONTECH's SMART technology (TAKARA) which selectively transcribes and amplifies full-length polyadenylated
mRNA,
following
the
manufacturer's
recommendations except where noted. We used ~900 ng
of total RNA as starting material from each wing collection. In order to increase the efficiency of 3'-end sequencing directly from PCR-amplified cDNA clones, we used a
modified 3' 54-mer adaptor (ATTCTAGAGACCGAGGCGGCCGACATG(T)4G(T)9C(T)10VN) for the first-strand
synthesis, and a modified 3' primer (ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATG(T)4GTC(T)4GTTCTGTTTC(T)4VN) for the cDNA
amplification step. These modified oligonucleotides effectively convert the long run of adenosine residues into a
sequence that causes fewer problems for dideoxy sequencing chemistries. Following first strand synthesis, the
SMART technology allows for exponential amplification
of polyA containing cDNA; we carried out 22 such cycles.
We obtained RNA and amplified cDNA separately for
each of the 5 stages of development, for both hind- and
forewings, and for male and female pupae, but pooled
wing discs from different individuals within each stage/
wing/sex prior to RNA isolation. Within-stage amplified
cDNAs were pooled in equimolar amounts (as estimated
from agarose gels) before the DNA digestion step that precedes insert ligation into the λTriplEx2 phage arms. Phage
were packaged using Packagene Lambda DNA
(PROMEGA) and all libraries were amplified from ~106
initial pfus to final titers ranging from 109 to 1010 pfu/ml,
following CLONTECH's library protocol. Libraries were
mass excised to pTriplEx2 and grown in E. coli strain
BM25.8 (CLONTECH). Individual colonies were picked
into 50μl of 0.01% Tritron-X. One μl of this solution was
used as template in a 10 μl PCR reaction with 0.25U
ExTaq (TAKARA), 4 pmole of each of the primers (forward:
CTCGGGAAGCGCGCCATTGTGTTGGT,
and
reverse ATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGCC), and
dNTPs and reaction buffer according to the enzyme manufacturer's recommendations. An initial denaturing step
of 5 min at 95° was followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec at 95°,

Page 10 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:130

30 sec at 68°, and 3 min at 72°. We picked and amplified
DNA from about 4,600 clones from each of the 5 libraries.
Library subtraction
We sequenced an initial set of ~2,000 PCR-amplified
clone inserts (sequencing described below), divided
roughly equally between the five libraries. This generated
1,934 high quality sequences which were assembled into
970 UniGenes. 777 of the individual reads assembled into
73 "abundant" UniGenes (defined as those harboring
four or more ESTs). We designed ~100 oligonucleotide
probes matching these abundant transcripts [see Additional file 1] to use in a library subtraction procedure to
minimize EST redundancy. Each oligonucleotide probe
was radioactively labeled in 5μl reactions (2.5 pmole of
oligo, 5U T4 PNK, and 33 nmol ATP33 (10μCi)) for 45
min at 37°, terminated by heating to 80° for 15 min, and
then pooled before removing unincorporated ATP using
MicroSpin G-25 columns (AMERSHAM BIOSCIENCES).
We used these probes to screen high-density arrays of
unsequenced PCR-amplified clone inserts in order to
identify transcripts not already sequenced in the initial set
of ~2,000 clones. High density arrays were created using
half the PCR volume for each amplified clone that was
dried down and re-suspended in 5μl of denaturing buffer
(0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl) and spotted onto Nylon filters
(MILLIPORE) as described in [85,86]. For each stage
library, we produced one filter containing 4,608 features,
including PCR products already sequenced. Duplicate filters were hybridized with three different sets of probes: a
pool of oligonucleotides corresponding to transcripts
seen six or more times in the initial sequencing, a pool
corresponding to transcripts seen four or five times, and,
to monitor PCR yield, a control oligonucleotide probe
internal to the primers used to amplify clone inserts but
common to all inserts (AAAGACAAAACATGTCGGCC).
Filters were hybridized, washed, exposed, stripped, and
spot intensity measured as in [85,86]. Log-transformed
dot intensity for the abundant transcript probes versus
control probe [see Additional file 2] were plotted and PCR
products corresponding to spots with low intensity measures for the control probe excluded from further analysis.
These amplicons represented ~35% of the total and likely
corresponded to inserts that were poorly amplified or
non-recombinant clones. The remaining spots segregated
into two distinct classes: high for the redundant transcript
probes relative to the control probe (i.e., those already
sequenced) and low for the redundant transcript probes
relative to the control probe (i.e. new inserts). High-yield
PCR features corresponding to clones harboring novel
inserts represented ~42 % of the total PCR products
arrayed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/130

EST sequences
We used a QIAGEN BIOROBOT to "cherry-pick" 8,832
PCR products harboring putative novel inserts identified
based on the subtraction procedure described above. We
outsourced sequencing of the 3' ends of the ESTs to GENAISSANCE PHARMACEUTICALS (NEW HAVEN, CT,
USA). In total, we sequenced ~2,000 preliminary and
8,832 post-subtraction PCR-amplified clone inserts using
the sequencing primer GGCCAAGTGAGCTCGAA. Quality scores were assigned to the sequence traces using
PHRED [67]. EST assembly and annotation engines typically ignore quality scores, so we wrote a custom PERL
script that uses lower- and upper-case letters to categorize
basecalls into low (PHRED<20) and high (PHRED> = 20)
quality bases, respectively. This PERL script allowed us to
collapse basecalls and their respective quality scores to a
single fasta file with case used to designate base quality.
Case was preserved throughout our subsequent database
curation efforts, and is available in Table S3 [see Additional file 3] together with other information for each EST
(e.g., length, tissue source).
Sequence processing and assembly
The EST sequences were clustered and assembled within
the openSputnik EST analysis pipeline [52]. Prior to
assembly, regions of low-complexity were masked using
RepeatBeater (BIOMAX Informatics, Martinsried, Germany) and vector remnants were removed using CrossMatch with the UniVec database [87] modified to include
the specific polylinkers we used in the cloning process.
Clustering was performed using the Hashed Position Tree
(HPT) algorithm (BIOMAX Informatics). An HPT similarity link threshold of 0.7 and maximum distance of six
steps was imposed to define a cluster within the similarity
network, thus encouraging the separation of likely paralogs. Multi-member clusters were assembled into UniGenes and singletons using the CAP3 method with
default settings [88].

Consensus nucleotides for polymorphic sites were
assigned based on majority-rule nucleotide frequency
(e.g., in an alignment of depth three, if one sequence is an
A and two are C, the consensus will be C). The consensus
sequence for each assembled UniGene was assigned a
complexity score representing the linguistic complexity of
the oligonucleotide "words" that build the sequence, calculated using the "complex" method from version 2.2.0 of
the EMBOSS package [89]. "Complex" was run using a
window size of 25 nucleotides and a window displacement step of five nucleotides and considered all oligonucleotides between four and six residues in length.
UniGenes with complexity scores lower than 0.49 were
removed from the analysis. The consensus sequences and
associated complexity scores for all contigs, as well as
other sequence characterization parameters (e.g.,

Page 11 of 16

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:130

sequence length and total number of ESTs in each contig)
are provided in Table S4 [see Additional file 4].
For each cluster's consensus, we derived likely protein
coding sequences by parsing the best BLASTX match and
filtering the results using the arbitrary expectation value of
1e-10. The derived candidate coding sequence was used to
train the ESTScan method [90] for properties and nuances
of B. anynana codon usage. ESTScan was run using default
settings with the derived B. anynana model to predict coding sequence across the whole sequence collection. The
best BLASTX match to the SwissProt database [91] was
used as the sequence reference. Peptide sequences of
length equal or greater than 20 aminoacids were derived
for B. anynana and used as the basic scaffold for peptidebased annotations in openSputnik [52]
Annotation: gene identification
The cluster consensus nucleotide sequences and predicted
peptide sequences were assigned likely identities within
the openSputnik [52] pipeline using BLASTN (fields ending in ".nuc" in Table 3) and BLASTX (fields ending in
".pro" in Table 3) [92]. Sequence comparisons between B.
anynana and other insect sequence collections included all
D. melanogaster genes in FlyBase ("Dmel.nuc" with 20,016
genes, and "Dmel.pro" with 19,369 peptides; BDGP4),
from Bombyx mori, the ESTs [32,33] (116,541 entries
retrieved from EMBL EST database and assembled in
openSputnik [52]into 26,089 clusters and 12,904 predicted peptides [93]) and the published Whole Genome
Shotgun (WGS) sequences [34,35], and all lepidopteran
sequences in EMBL release 83, excluding the ones from
Bombyx mori mentioned above ("lep.nuc" with 40,501
entries). The B. mori collections were organized as follows:
hits to "Bmori.nuc" correspond to the best BLAST hit to
nucleotide sequences of the openSputnik-clustered EST
collections [32,33] or the predicted coding sequences
from one of the WGS projects [35], hits to "Bmori.pro"
correspond to the best BLAST to peptide sequences of the
openSputnik-clustered EST [32,33] or the predicted peptides from one of the WGS projects [35], and finally hits
to "Bmori.wgs.nuc" correspond to best BLAST to one or
both of the WGS collections [34,35]. Homology comparisons against the Rfam database [94] were used to identify
candidate structural and non-coding RNAs ("Rfam.nuc";
34,496 sequences from Rfam 6.0), and comparisons
against the collection of organellar DNA were used to
identify non-nuclear genes ("organel.nuc"; 67,548
sequences downloaded EMBL in April 2004). BLAST analysis against the whole genome of E. coli K12 (from NCBI)
was used to identify potential bacterial contaminants
("Ecoli.nuc). Further annotation was accomplished using
BLASTX against a number of peptide collections (Table 3);
"NonRed.pro" (a non-redundant protein sequence database constructed from all TrEMBL, all SwissProt, and all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/130

PIR sequences; 2,268,590 entries), "invert.pro" (all
TrEMBL protein sequences from invertebrate species; for a
total of 303,441 peptide elements), "plant.pro" (EMBL
release 83, 195,673 protein sequences from plant species), and "Swiss.pro" (SwissProt database release 48.1
with 196,679 sequences). All BLAST-based homology
results were filtered using the expectation value of 1e-05.
Some BLAST fields were combined for a clearer summary
of the gene identification effort (Table 3, Figure 2). The
field "Dmel" in Figure 2 corresponds to all those contigs
with a significant BLAST result for at least one of the fields
"Dmel.nuc" and "Dmel.pro". In the same way, all B. mori
EST- and WGS-derived fields were combined to account
for all significant BLAST results against the B. mori collections ("Bmori"), "invert.pro" and "lep.nuc" were combined into the "InvLep" field, and "organel.nuc" and
"Rfam.nuc" were combined into the "nonnuc" field for
contigs showing best significant hits to non-nuclear or
non-protein coding gene collections (Table 3). Finally,
sequences were assessed for possible contamination by
searching for homology to the Escherichia coli genome
("Ecoli.nuc", possibly from bacteria living inside dissected larvae and adults or used during the cloning process) and to plant collections ("plant.pro", possibly from
plant material from the larvae gut). We considered potential contaminants UniGenes meeting the following criteria: 1) the best BLAST hit (lowest E-value) was obtained in
the analysis against "plant.pro" or "Ecol.nuc", and 2) the
best hit to any invertebrate-specific field ("Dmel",
"Bmori", "InvLep") was at least 100 fold higher to insure
they were not simply highly conserved genes.
Annotation: functional and phylogenetic context
The openSputnik database contains a number of fields
pertaining to the functional annotation of the genes identified. These include domain analyses, which were performed using the InterPro software [95], and functional
and role assignments which were performed using SwissProt to GO and InterPro to GO mappings [54].

Further functional assignments, using gene identification
obtained via the two most relevant genomic collections
(those of D. melanogaster and B. mori) were performed
using the software GOminer [50]. Based on GO classifications available for D. melanogaster, GOminer assigns GO
categories to the list of D. melanogaster CG numbers for
which we found homologous genes among our UniGenes
(either directly, based on the BLAST analysis against the
Drosophila-specific fields, or indirectly, based on the
BLAST analysis against B. mori ESTs annotated based on
the D. melanogaster gene collection). The latter group corresponds to B. anynana genes which do not have a significant BLAST hit to the D. melanogaster collection, but do
have a significant hit (E-value below set threshold of 1e-

05) to a contig from the B. mori EST collection which, in
turn, had a significant hit (E-value below 1e-05) to a D.
melanogaster CG number.
Polymorphic marker identification
In order to characterize the SNPs segregating in our samples, we used our multifasta UniGene alignments and a
custom PERL script to process them. For each non-singleton UniGene, all ESTs in the alignment were made the
same length by padding with "N"s where necessary, and
all lowercase (PHRED<20) basecalls were replaced with
"n"s (multifasta alignment files available at [49]). In this
way, we minimized the impact of low-quality bases on
SNP identification. For each UniGene alignment our
PERL script produced a new consensus sequence by ignoring N and n and returning a IUB code for polymorphic
sites (e.g., in an alignment of depth three, if one sequence
is an A and two are C, the consensus will be M). The consensus sequences thus produced were analyzed and the
total number of SNPs counted. Since ESTs often contain
errors that are believed to originate during the reverse
transcription step required to make cDNA libraries, we
repeated our SNP identification procedure by considering
only SNPs having a minor allele count of at least two. Such
"double-hit" SNPs have proven to be of much greater
practical utility than "single-hit" SNPs (SNPs with a minor
allele count of at least one) in the human HAPMAP project
[96].

We used another custom PERL script to identify microsatellite repeats within majority-rule consensus sequences.
The script was written to locate di-nucleotide units
repeated at least six times, and tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide units repeated at least four times.
