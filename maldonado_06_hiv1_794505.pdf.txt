The different pathways of HIV transmission from dendritic cells to T cells and their possible capacity to harbor
the virus, indicates the potential of this group of cells to
be a viral reservoir, allowing the virus to evade immune
responses. Therefore, we isolated in vivo blood dendritic
cells (DCs) from HIV-1 infected patients undergoing
HAART. Proviral DNA amplification from DCs was
obtained from all infected patients except in patients with
non-detectable viral loads. A significant finding was that
DCs proviral DNA amplification were obtained from
three patients with extremely low viral loads, which
resembles the normal viral blips in HAART suppression.
This DCs viral infection may be responsible for the replenishment of important reservoirs. DCs' capacity to harbor
archaic viral quasispecies was also revealed in two of six
patients and those quasispecies were at least as archaic as
resting CD4+ T cells viral quasispecies. In addition, the
DCs proviral DNA of these two patients presented multiple changes in glycosylation patterns equal to resting
CD4+ T cells reservoir. Other important analyses of
nucleotide distance and phylogeny revealed a close relation between the viral populations of DCs and resting
CD4+ T cells in four HAART failure patients. These data
suggest that DCs can act as a short-term reservoir and
could be partially responsible for the replenishment of
other important reservoirs. Due to the well-documented
capacity of DCs to pass the HIV infection to T cells and
phylogenetic evidence, we suggest that the infection of

DCs in HAART suppression may be partially responsible
for the replenishment of the resting CD4+ T cell reservoir.
