Abstract
Background: Hookworms, infecting over one billion people, are the mostly closely related major
human parasites to the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Applying genomics techniques to
these species, we analyzed 3,840 and 3,149 genes from Ancylostoma caninum and A. ceylanicum.
Results: Transcripts originated from libraries representing infective L3 larva, stimulated L3,
arrested L3, and adults. Most genes are represented in single stages including abundant transcripts
like hsp-20 in infective L3 and vit-3 in adults. Over 80% of the genes have homologs in C. elegans,
and nearly 30% of these were with observable RNA interference phenotypes. Homologies were
identified to nematode-specific and clade V specific gene families. To study the evolution of
hookworm genes, 574 A. caninum / A. ceylanicum orthologs were identified, all of which were found
to be under purifying selection with distribution ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous amino
acid substitutions similar to that reported for C. elegans / C. briggsae orthologs. The phylogenetic
distance between A. caninum and A. ceylanicum is almost identical to that for C. elegans / C. briggsae.
Conclusion: The genes discovered should substantially accelerate research toward better
understanding of the parasites' basic biology as well as new therapies including vaccines and novel
anthelmintics.

Background
Comparative sequence analysis is an approach proven to
aid in recognition of genes and defining of their function,
especially when comparing genomes of close evolutionary distance. In addition, when partial genomes are placed
in a context of a well-studied and fully sequenced model
organism they can greatly facilitate the understanding of
the less studied organisms' biology.
Hookworms are blood-feeding nematodes that infect one
billion people causing iron deficiency anemia and
retarded physical and cognitive development in children
[1]. The two major species infecting humans are Necator
americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. The closely related
hookworm species of canids, Ancylostoma caninum, and
canines and felines, A. ceylanicum, are minor parasites of
humans, but are important as laboratory models for
hookworm infection and disease. Other hookworms
infect raccoons, sheep, seals and a variety of other mammals [2]
Adult (Ad) hookworms inhabit the small intestine and
produce eggs that pass in the feces and hatch in the soil.
The first stage larva (L1) feeds on bacteria and molts twice
to form the non-feeding, infective third stage (iL3). iL3
enters the host by penetrating the skin, or orally in the
case of Ancylostoma species, molts twice, and matures to
Ad in the small intestine. A. duodenale and A. caninum L3s
can also infect a host, temporarily abort maturation and
enter an arrested state (hypobiosis) within the host's
somatic tissues [3], reactivating in response to host physiological changes such as pregnancy [4].
Current hookworm control strategies are limited to deworming of infected people using anthelmintic drugs.
However, rapid re-infection in endemic areas and the lack
of sterile immunity necessitates repeated treatments and
can in turn result in resistance. Additionally, tissuearrested stages are relatively resilient to the effects of
anthelmintics [5]. The Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative is beginning clinical trials of a larval hookworm antigen, ASP-2, from N. americanus, as a vaccine antigen [6].
There is a critical need for further research to identify new
vaccine and drug targets as well as to better understand
hookworm biology. Lack of sequence information has
been a major hindrance to hookworm molecular studies.
High throughput sequencing of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs; sequences derived from randomly selected cDNA
clones) has proven a cost-effective tool for discovering
genes [7]. Because the hookworm superfamily (Ancylostomatoidea) falls within nematode Clade V [8,9], which
also contains the well-studied model nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans [10], predictions may be made and
tested based on their close relatedness. Previous genomebased characterization of hookworms has been limited to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/58

sampling of few hundred ESTs [11] and molecular studies
of individual genes of interest (eg. [12]; reviewed in [13]).
EST approaches have also been initiated for other Strongylid parasites including Haemonchus contortus [14,15] and
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis [16].
In this report we describe the comparative analyses of
almost 20,000 ESTs from 7 different cDNA libraries representing pre-parasitic and parasitic larval through adult
stages of the hookworms A. caninum and A. ceylanicum.
The dataset defined nearly 7,000 hookworm genes,
including a number of putative developmentally
expressed genes and candidates for further study as drug
target or vaccine components.

Results
Nearly 20,000 Ancylostoma derived ESTs were submitted to
GenBank between 1999 and 2003 [see Additional file 1].
For simplicity, the results and analysis described are presented in the same order beginning with A. caninum and
followed by A. ceylanicum, except where specified.
EST acquisition and NemaGene organization
ESTs originated from 7 cDNA libraries, representing three
and two life-cycle stages respectively (Table 1). Clustering,
implemented to reduce data redundancy and improve
sequence quality and length, grouped ESTs into contigs
which were further organized into clusters (Table 1), providing a non-redundant catalog of represented genes. ESTs
within a contig derive from nearly identical transcripts
while contigs within a cluster may arise from splice isoforms, alleles, or closely related paralogs [17]. Fifty-one
potentially chimeric ESTs were discarded. Clusters ranged
in size from a single EST to 203 and 323 for A. caninum
and A. ceylanicum respectively (Figure 1). Most clusters for
each species (72% and 55%) have ten or fewer ESTs. GC
content for coding sequences was similar in the two species (44% and 48%) and consistent with other Clade V
nematodes like C. elegans and C. briggsae [18].

The number of clusters may overestimate gene discovery,
as one gene may be represented by multiple non-overlapping clusters (fragmentation). By using C. elegans as a reference genome (19,522 genes; [10]) and discounting for
fragmentation calculated as 4.5% and 6.5 % respectively
[17], the estimated gene numbers were reduced to 3,840
for A. caninum and 3,149 for A. ceylanicum giving a gene
discovery rate of 41% (3,840 × 100/9,283) and 30%
(3,149 × 100/10,588). These numbers also indicate 20%
and 16% representation of all genes for each species
respectively. The number of genes in common for more
stage-specific Ancylostoma libraries analysed was as low as
9% and 11% (Figure 2). This may reflect the EST sample
size or stage-specific expression, as will be discussed. In

either case, the results clearly show the advantage gained
for gene discovery in Ancylostoma by including diverse life
stages in the analysis.
Functional classification based on Gene Ontology and
KEGG assignments
Thirty-four percent of A. caninum and 54% of A. ceylanicum clusters align to InterPro domains and 21% and 36%
map to Gene Ontology (GO) respectively. Following this
same pattern, A. caninum also had fewer BLAST matches
(see below). Seven of the ten most abundantly represented InterPro domains were common to both species
(Table 2). GO representation is shown by biological process, cellular component, and molecular function (Table
3). Among the most common GO categories are protein
metabolism (GO:0019538) and catalytic activity
(GO:0003824).

Within Ancylostoma spp. clusters that had extracellular
mappings, 70% and 56% respectively were in the category
of Allergen V5/Tpx-1 proteins (IPR001283) related to the
secreted venom proteins from hymenopteran insects
(Table 2). The Ancylostoma secreted proteins (ASPs)
belong to this large gene family [19], members of which
been shown to play roles in host-parasite interactions for
both mammalian [20,21] and plant parasitic nematodes
[22], and to induce protective responses [6]. ASP-1 is one
of the major proteins secreted by serum-stimulated A.
caninum iL3 [12]. In addition, four A. ceylanicum clusters
were classified in extracellular matrix (GO:0005578) as
tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP) domain proteins. A TIMP homolog is reported as the most abundant
protein in adult hookworm excretory/secretory products
and may inhibit host metalloproteases [23].

Ten % and 15% unique clusters for A. caninum and A. ceylanicum respectively, mapped to 89 metabolic pathways
grouped in 11 categories (Table 4). Complete listings and
graphical representations of the KEGG mappings are
available at http://www.nematode.net. Pathways well represented by both species include glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid
biosynthesis and metabolism. KEGG analysis (Table 4)
also suggests specific biochemical differences among
Ancylostoma stages. For example, while serum stimulated
L3-specific clusters make up to 27% of all AC clusters, they
account for 40% of all KEGG pathway mappings. In contrast, iL3-specific clusters that account for 55% of all AC
clusters make-up only 38% of KEGG pathway mappings.
It is unclear whether the predominance of enzyme mappings from the ssL3 stage versus iL3 stage is indicative of
greater metabolic activity, greater metabolic complexity,
differences in library construction methods, or other
differences.
Homologs in other organisms, orthologs within
Ancylostoma spp. and estimates of selective pressure
Within A. ceylanicum clusters, 83% had homology to proteins from other organisms as compared to only 66% for
A. caninum (Figure 3). To investigate why contigs from
closely related species would show a difference in
identified homologies, we compared sequence lengths
and the open reading frame (ORF) lengths of contigs with
and without homologies in both species. EST lengths and
contig lengths, respectively, were shorter for A. caninum
(410 and 549 nucleotides) than for A. ceylanicum (490
and 637 nucleotides). The differences were even more
striking for ORFs (Figure 4). Hence, A. caninum contigs
very likely identify fewer homologs because these
sequences are shorter, contain smaller ORFs, and proba-

176 ESTs. Cluster size (x-axis) is shown to scale for 1–75 members, with the size of larger clusters indicated.

bly include more 3' UTR versus the superior quality dataset from A. ceylanicum. Most likely, differences in library
construction and sampling rather than intrinsic differences between the species explain this discrepancy.
Accounting for such differences is important as it keeps
analysis focused upon interesting features of the dataset
related to the organisms' biology rather than artifactual
differences arising from data collection.
The distribution of identified homologs (Figure 3) was
consistent with earlier observations [17]. Besides C. elegans, one of the more informative nematode datasets for
this study is a collection of 4,780 ESTs from the human

hookworm Necator americanus to which homologies were
commonly found (42% and 38% respectively). Within
Ancylostoma itself homologies were common with 34% of
total A. caninum clusters matching the A. ceylanicum dataset and 44% of total A. ceylanicum clusters matching A.
caninum. Searching for putative orthologs between all A.
caninum and A. ceylanicum contigs resulted in 1,304
reciprocal best TBLASTX hits. The ortholog pair members
were very similar in GC composition (46% and 47%) and
the average length of alignment was 327 bp. All ortholog
pairs (574) were under purifying selection (dN/dS < 1;
Figure 5) and the average dS was 0.65 ± 0.83 and dN was
0.11 ± 0.2. The average dN/dS ratio (~0.17) is higher than

that reported for C. briggsae/C. elegans (~0.06; [18]), and
closer to that for mouse/human (0.115; [24]), indicating
that the levels of purifying selection are somewhat different. In addition, to examine if this purifying selection is
more frequently detected in genes with essential function,
we cross-referenced the C. elegans genes matched by Ancylostoma orthologs with a list of C. elegans genes with available RNA interference (RNAi) information (http://
www.wormbase.org; eg. [25]). Of the 67% of the orthologous genes matching C. elegans genes with available RNAi
data, 45% had an observable phenotype after transcript
knock-down. A vast majority of the observed phenotypes
were severe (88% sterility and embryonic lethality). Ancy-

lostoma orthologs matching C. elegans genes that had phenotypes showed a somewhat lower dN/dS ratio than
those matching genes that remained wild type after RNAi
treatment, though the difference was not statistically significant at P < 0.05 (0.09 vs. 0.14; sign. diff. at P < 0.2).
In a 4-way comparison of orthologs in C. elegans, C.
briggsae, A. caninum, and A. ceylanicum, the phylogenetic
distance between A. caninum and A. ceylanicum is almost
identical to that between C. elegans and C. briggsae and the
distance between the two genera is just over four times the
within genera distance (Figure 6). Average branch lengths
for the set of 452 orthologous proteins did not show a sigPage 8 of 19

homologies (≥ e-05) were identified to non-Ancylostoma sequences for 65.8% (2,646/4,020) of A. caninum and 83.1% (2,801/
3,369) of A. ceylanicum clusters. Databases used are: for C. elegans, Wormpep v.97 and mitochondrial protein sequences; for

nificant difference in relative rate of molecular change.
Maximum likelihood trees [26] were constructed for each
4-way ortholog and relative branch lengths compared
between Ancylostoma spp. for both the protein and nucleotide sequences. For protein sequences, 109 trees had
equal branch lengths for the hookworm species while 175
trees had longer A. caninum branches and 168 had longer
A. ceylanicum branches. To look for differences between
genes in the Ancylostoma species, we constructed a distribution of branch length differences between each of the
sister species pairs in our tree. Because some genes may be
rapidly evolving in all nematode lineages we evaluated a
subset of the trees where the difference in branch lengths
between C. briggsae and C. elegans were less than one
standard deviation from the mean but which had significantly different branch lengths in the two Ancylostoma species. This final dataset had 23 genes with significantly
longer branch lengths in A. ceylanicum and 16 in A. caninum (1 SD, P < 0.05). However the set did not show any
significant bias towards either species (p < 0.34, sign test).
This suggests there is no significant rate difference in protein evolution between the two hookworms, although

some of these genes are relatively rapidly evolving.
Repeating the analysis for nucleotide sequences we find
marginally significant differences (p < 0.08; sign test).
Using the C. elegans genome to interpret hookworm
sequences
As expected, the C. elegans genome provides the best
source of information for interpreting hookworm
sequences as a majority of A. caninum and A. ceylanicum
clusters with BLAST homologies outside Ancylostoma had
C. elegans homologs (Figure 3; 25 most conserved
nematode genes between each Ancylostoma species and C.
elegans are available online; [see Additional file 2]). Furthermore, C. elegans orthologs of hookworm genes with
available RNAi or other data provide information that
may be relevant to understanding the role of the parasite
genes. Of all the Ancylostoma clusters with C. elegans
homology, 97% and 92% matched C. elegans genes with
available RNA interference knock-down information
http://www.wormbase.org, and in turn 33% and 37% of
these C. elegans genes produce RNAi phenotypes (versus a
rate of only ~15% phenotypes for all C. elegans genes).

Phenotype classification [see Additional file 3] showed
that C. elegans genes with expressed Ancylostoma
homologs were somewhat more likely to have severe phenotypes [17]. Hence, certain genes in the Ancylostoma
datasets encode proteins if disabled may disrupt survival
of the parasite. Some examples include abundant clusters
(AC00023.cl, AE01104.cl; Table 5 and Table 6). A group
of particular interest is proteins that are required for nem-

atode survival and lack strong homologies outside of the
phyla (nematode-specific), since these targets could provide for nematode control without toxicities to the host or
other non-target organisms. Of the Ancylostoma nematode-specific clusters (Figure 3), 85 and 91 respectively
had C. elegans matches with RNAi phenotypes. Among
these, AC04398.cl and AE00474.cl matched hypothetical
protein F42A8.1 (1e-65, 2e-76 respectively), a gene with-

out a mammalian homolog yet likely involved in multiple
developmental processes based on observed mutant phenotypes [25]. Homologs are found in at least 13 nematode species to date including free-living species (3), and
parasites of mammals (8) and plants (1). Further analysis
will identify additional genes which warrant detailed
investigation.
Repeating the analysis in Stein et al. [18] indicates that 6–
7% of C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins are candidate
"orphans", lacking homologs outside of the species. We
examined whether these genes are truly orphans that have
arisen in a Caenorhabditis sub-lineage or are instead genes
present in an ancestral nematode that have been lost or
evolved beyond recognition in one species. Of candidate
orphan proteins, ten from C. elegans (Table 7) and 27
from C. briggsae [see Additional file 4] match A. caninum
and/or A. ceylanicum clusters, with three and eight, respec-

tively, having matches in both species. Most of the C. elegans orphans are hypothetical proteins of unknown
function though some had functional information from
InterPro domains (R10E9.3) or mutant phenotypes
(ZK686.1). Therefore, at least a portion of the genes identified in either C. elegans or C. briggsae as "orphans" are
actually ancestral nematode genes with homologs found
in other clade V species and further clade V sequencing
will likely reveal more such cases.
Abundant transcripts expressed in Ancylostoma species
The 25 most abundantly represented clusters account for
14% and 19% of ESTs for A. caninum and A. ceylanicum
respectively. The representation of the abundant transcripts varied from shared to stage-specific (Table 5 and
Table 6). Hookworm developmental stages differ in habitat, morphology and behavior, hence highly represented
gene transcripts may identify functions that are important

to the parasites at various stages. Differences in gene
expression between A. ceylanicum stages have been demonstrated previously for several genes [27,28]. Our
comparison of iL3 and adult suggests additional examples
(see Discussion). In fact, only 9% of the A. ceylanicum
clusters are shared between iL3 and adult (Figure 2) and
of the 25 largest clusters, 23 were biased toward one of the

developmental stages (Table 6). While representation in
EST collections generally correlates with source expression
level [29], artifacts can occur [30,31]. Differences in
expression are most likely to be accurate when comparing
the most abundant transcripts in each stage. Therefore,
while follow-up work is needed to confirm expression lev-

els, examination of ESTs provides a list of candidates for
various expression profiles.

Discussion
Overview
We have taken a genomics approach to the study of hookworm species, key parasites of humans and domestic animals that are related to the model nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans. Nearly 20,000 ESTs from Ancylostoma caninum and A. ceylanicum identified approximately
7,000 genes including over 1,300 likely orthologs represented in both species. Close to 900 genes encode putative
enzymes involved in 88 metabolic pathways. Over 3,100
genes contain recognizable protein domains many of
which have been categorized in the Gene Ontology
hierarchy. 4,600 genes have homologs in C. elegans
including numerous nematode-specific genes and hundreds with observable RNAi phenotypes. ESTs originated
from libraries representing infective L3 larva, stimulated
L3, tissue arrested L3, and adults resulting in an improved
rate of gene discovery and allowing the identification of
transcripts abundant in various stages.
Gene expression in iL3 and dauers
Infective L3 (iL3) are developmentally-arrested, non-feeding pre-parasitic stages, which when triggered by the
infection process and host-specific signals reactivate, molt
and complete development. A similar stage in C. elegans is
called the dauer larva. In Ancylostoma species host factors
such as dog serum stimulate feeding and an activation
response in serum stimulated L3 (ssL3) [32] that approximates the transition to parasitism in the host [33]. A.
caninum tissue-arrested L3 (taL3) recovered from infected
mice are a distinct population that potentially share
properties with the arrested iL3. Developmentally
arrested, non-feeding larvae would be expected to be
dependent on stored energy reserves and lipid metabolic
pathways; accordingly, the KEGG biochemical pathway
mappings show a substantive number of clusters for fatty
acid metabolism especially with the A. ceylanicum iL3 clusters (Table 4).

C. elegans microarray experiments identified 540 dauerenriched genes along with genes involved in dauer-recovery [34]. C. elegans SAGE experiments identified 358
candidate dauer-specific genes [35]. Genes shown to be
abundantly expressed in C. elegans dauers include a variety of genes that may play roles in extended survival
including heat shock protein encoding genes like hsp-12.6
and daf-21 (Hsp90), ctl-1 (cytosolic catalase), sod-3
(superoxide dismutase), and hil-1 and hil-3 (Histone
H1's). A number of genes identified both in Ancylostoma
L3s and C. elegans dauers are discussed below.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/58

Heat-shock Proteins
hsp-12.6, a member of the hsp-20 family, was one of the
most highly represented clusters in A. caninum iL3 and
taL3 as well as A. ceylanicum iL3 (Table 5 and Table 6).
Among a Strongyloides stercoralis EST collection, the gene is
also found in iL3 but not L1 [17]. C. elegans hsp-12.6 is
upregulated in dauer and starved L1s [34,36] and is a transcriptional target of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16
[37]. Unlike other HSPs, C. elegans hsp-12.6 is not stressinduced and does not prevent aggregation of unfolded
proteins, suggesting a novel role. AE00033.cl, found
exclusively in adult ESTs, encodes an ortholog of the Nippostrongylus brasiliensis HSP-20 protein. Nb-hsp-20 is more
similar to the HSP-16 group of the HSP-20 family of small
HSPs in C. elegans, is also expressed in the adult [38], and
is not stress regulated, suggesting that it may function as
an adult version of hsp-12.6.
Candidate stress-response proteins
A. caninum iL3 showed abundant clusters encoding
homologs of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunits I, II, III and a stress associated endoplasmic reticulum protein not seen in ssL3 (Table 5). One A. ceylanicum
iL3 abundant cluster encoded a ribosome-associated
membrane 4 protein (RAMP4) involved in ER protein
translocation [39] which is over-expressed in hypoxia and
suppresses degradation of ER membrane proteins [40]. A
homolog of C. elegans spp-4 was also expressed at high levels in A. ceylanicum iL3. spp-4 encodes an amoebapore, a
member of the saposin-like protein superfamily that kill
bacteria by forming membrane ion channels [41]. Amoebapore proteins are one of a number of putative stress
response proteins regulated by DAF-16 in C. elegans
[37,42]. These proteins, also including lysozyme and
thaumatin, may provide a defense against worm pathogens and contribute to dauer longevity [43]. Hookworm
free-living stages are also soil dwelling microbiverous
organisms exposed to soil pathogens, so it is possible that
spp-4 plays an antibacterial role in A. ceylanicum.
Gene expression in ssL3, adults, and multiple stages
In contrast to iL3, A. caninum ssL3 showed a CMP-sialic
acid transporter, cathepsin D-like aspartic protease, calponin-like protein, and ham-2 zinc finger protein among
the abundant transcripts. While the significance of these
molecules is unknown, upregulation of an aspartic
protease during the transition to parasitism and tissue
penetration/migration is consistent with its role in degradation of serum proteins and collagens [44].

Abundant adult-specific clusters are likely to be involved
in reproduction. For example, A. ceylanicum (Table 6)
encodes an ortholog of the C. elegans VIT-3 protein, a lipid
binding protein and major yolk component [45]. VIT-3 is
expressed exclusively in the C. elegans adult

hermaphrodite intestine, secreted, and taken up by
oocytes. Two clusters encode genes involved in metabolism of chitin, an important constituent of the nematode
eggshell [46]. One encodes a protein similar to C. elegans
protein C34D4.11, and shows some similarity to a beet
chitinase; the other encodes an ortholog of C. elegans
B0280.5, a protein required for early embryonic development [47]. B0280.5 mRNA is expressed specifically in the
adult hermaphrodite germ line and is a target of GLD-1,
an RNA binding protein required for oocyte meiotic cell
cycle progression [48].
ASP's
While there are differences in the cluster profiles among
Ancylostoma stages, there are shared transcripts as well. For
example, the Ancylostoma secreted protein ASP-1 and ASPlike cDNAs are present in abundance in both A. caninum
iL3 and ssL3. The secretion of ASP-1 protein by ssL3s was
noted as a marker of the transition to parasitism [12].
These results support conclusions made by Wang and Kim
[34] that arrested larvae are transcriptionally prepared for
dauer exit and upon receipt of appropriate stimulatory
signals, exit from the arrested state is accompanied by a
burst of translational activity in addition to further transcriptional activity. In contrast to ASP-1, ESTs for ASP-2
were exclusively detected in A. caninum iL3.
FAR Proteins
Two of the most abundant A. ceylanicum transcripts
encode fatty acid/retinol binding (FAR) proteins (Table
6). FAR proteins are novel fatty acid and retinol binding
proteins described in nematodes including A. caninum,
other Strongylida, filarial, and plant parasitic species [4951]. In C. elegans 8 FAR members are divided into 3
groups. All the parasitic nematodes FARs described to date
are most similar to the C. elegans A group containing Cefar-1, -2, and -6. Seven A. ceylanicum clusters encode FAR
proteins. Four of which (9 ESTs) were found in the adult
cDNA library; clusters AE00748.cl and AE03203.cl were
nearly identical to Ac-far-1 and Ac-far-2 (98% and 99%
nucleotide identity) whereas cluster AE02490.cl showed
the highest similarity to Ce-far-1 and AE01700.cl to Ac-far2. The iL3 specific clusters AE01410.cl (60/63 ESTs from
iL3) and AE03983.cl (2/2 ESTs from iL3) were both most
closely related to a FAR protein from Ostertagia ostertagi
[52], and more distantly to Ac-far-1 and -2. Therefore, as
seen in other parasitic nematodes, most A. ceylanicum FAR
proteins are related to C. elegans group A FAR proteins.
However, the A. ceylanicum cluster AE00750 was most
similar to group C FAR protein Ce-far-7. Group C proteins
differ from the other FARs in important ways including
lacking an N-terminal signal peptide (suggesting an intracellular location), containing several cysteines, and failing
to bind DAUDA [53]. AE00750.cl represents the first
report of a FAR-7 like protein from a parasitic nematode.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/58

The function of FAR proteins is unknown but may represent a lipid acquisition system in which released FARs
bind to lipids followed by uptake of the complex by a specific receptor mediated process. Retinoids are required for
nematode growth and development, but are not synthesized by the worms. In parasitic nematodes, release of FAR
proteins may also modify local inflammatory and
immunological responses by delivering or sequestering
biochemically important lipids [54].

Conclusion
The application of genomic approaches to hookworms
has resulted in more than a 100-fold increase in available
sequence data from Ancylostoma species thereby allowing
an initial bioinformatic analysis of transcripts from these
important parasites and establishing a foundation for the
eventual completion of a hookworm genome. Semi-automated informatic approaches that are now being applied
to all nematode sequences [55] allow uniform comparisons across many genomes and provide databases for further exploration. Transcripts in A. caninum and A.
ceylanicum include clear candidates for stage specific
expression representing the very different biological processes underway in different points of the lifecycle. The
availability of the C. elegans and C. briggsae genomes has
allowed highly informative comparisons to the two hookworm species showing extensive overlap in gene
complements, including genes demonstrated to be essential in C. elegans and numerous genes specific to nematodes. As the most closely related major human pathogen
to C. elegans, hookworms provide an attractive near-term
application for using a model organism to better understand and eventually control a key disease-causing species.
Beyond categorization of hookworm genes, clear research
avenues are available to apply this information to
improved methods for hookworm control including
anthelmintic and vaccine development, diagnostics, population studies, as well as better understanding of fundamental aspects of hookworm biology, such as host
immune system modulation.

Methods
Nematode extraction
A Shanghai strain of A. caninum was maintained in beagles as described [56]. Infective L3 (iL3) were recovered
from 7–10 day old coprocultures using a modified
Baermann technique, washed clean of debris with BU
buffer (50 mM Na2PO4/22 mM KH2PO4/70 mM NaCl,
pH 6.8; [57]), and snap-frozen by immersion in liquid N2.
Frozen larvae were stored at -80°C until used for library
construction. Serum stimulated larvae (ssL3) were generated by incubating iL3s harvested from a North Carolina
strain of A. caninum in 5% normal dog serum for 20–24 h
at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide. Tissue-arrested L3 larvae
(taL3) were recovered from BALB/c mice infected with

1,000–1,500 iL3 (North Carolina strain) and euthanized
at 10–14 days post-infection [58].
A Warsaw strain of A. ceylanicum was maintained in Syrian
hamsters as described [59], and L3 recovered, washed, and
frozen as above. For the recovery of adult stage A. ceylanicum, infected hamsters with patent infections were sacrificed and the small intestine removed. The intestine was
cut into 3 sections, opened longitudinally, and hung in 50
ml centrifuge tubes containing phosphate buffered saline
at 37°C for 2–3 hrs. Following incubation, adult worms
were recovered from the sediment, washed free of debris,
and snap-frozen as above. All animals were housed and
treated in accordance with institutional care and use committee guidelines.
Preparation of A. caninum staged RNA and cDNA
libraries
Pulverization for the ssL3 and taL3 was performed using
an Alloy Tool Steel Set (Fisher Scientific International).
Total RNA from adult and larval parasites was prepared
using TRIzol Reagent (GibcoBRL, Life Technologies or
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

SMART based serum stimulated L3 library – Library construction was based on the SMART cDNA library construction system (Clontech Laboratories; [60]). mRNA was
extracted from 10 µg of total RNA using a Dynabeads
mRNA Purification kit (Dynal Biotech) with some modifications. First strand synthesis was performed with the
mRNA bound to the oligo-dT of the Dynabeads using
Superscript II RT (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and the
primer smart T7_3G_5. Concatemers were digested with
Not I on the bead. Second strand synthesis was performed
with the smartT7_5 and the smartCDSII primer. Amplification of the cDNA was performed with the smartT7_5
and smartT7_3 primers with cycling parameters of 95°C
for 5 minutes, seven cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds, 60°C
for 5 seconds and 68°C for 6 minutes followed by a 4
minute extension at 68°C. Following amplification, the
cDNA was purified using the High Pure PCR Product
Purification Kit (Roche). The final 5 cycles of PCR introduced the deoxy-UMP primers needed for cloning into the
pAMP1 vector (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). cDNA fragments >1 kb were size selected on a 0.8% TAE agarose gel
and cloned into the pAMP1 vector following the CloneAMP pAMP1 System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies).
The ligation mix introduced into E. coli DH10B chemically competent cells (GibcoBRL, Life Technologies)
resulted in 4.36 × 105 primary transformants.
SL1-PCR-based tissue arrested L3 library – mRNA was
extracted from 2 µg of total RNA using a Dynabeads
mRNA Purification kit (Dynal Biotech) and eluted with
10 µl 10 mM Tris-HCl. First strand synthesis was per-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/58

formed using linker primer (GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTT)
and
Superscript II RT (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Amplification with Taq Polymerase used the SL1 (GGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGA)
and
Xhop
(GAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGA) primers and 5 µl of the
first strand reaction. Cycling parameters were 95°C for 5
minutes, 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 minute, 47°C for 1
minute, 72°C for 3 minutes followed by 5 minutes at
72°C. cDNA fragments >1 kb were size selected on a 0.8%
TAE agarose gel and cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector
following the TOPO TA protocol (Invitrogen). The ligation mix was introduced into E. coli DH10B chemically
competent cells (GibcoBRL, Life Technologies).
Hawdon infective L3 library – Frozen A. caninum L3 pellets
were ground to powder on a mortar pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from the powder
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Poly (A)+
RNA was isolated from total RNA using the Oligotex
mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Approximately 5 µg of mRNA was used to construct a directional
cDNA library in Lambda ZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)
as previously described [61]. pBluescript phagemid were
mass excised prior to sequencing. The library had >95%
recombinants, and insert size varied from 700–3,000 bp.
The library was amplified once (106 pfu).
Preparation of A. ceylanicum staged RNA and cDNA
libraries
Hawdon adult and infective L3 A. ceylanicum libraries –
Total RNA and poly (A)+ mRNA were isolated from the
appropriate A. ceylanicum life-cycle stage using Trizol reagent and the Oligotex mRNA isolation kit as described
above. Approximately 5 µg of mRNA was used to construct directional cDNA libraries in Lambda ZAP II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously described [61]. Both
libraries had 99% recombinants with inserts ranging from
500–2500 bp (average 1500 bp), and each underwent one
round of amplification (106 pfu). Inserts were mass
excised as described above.

SL1-PCR-based infective L3 and adult libraries – cDNA
was PCR amplified, using SL1-EcoRI primer on the 5' end
and oligo(dT)-XhoI on 3' end, gel fractionated [62], and
non-directionally
cloned
into
pCR-TOPO-XL
(Invitrogen), following XL-Topo TA cloning protocol. The
cDNA inserts were excised with EcoRI.
Sequencing and clustering
Sequencing, EST processing and clustering were performed as described [17]. Information for clone requests
and sequence trace files are available at http://www.nem
atode.net. The completed cluster assemblies, NemaGene
Ancylostoma caninum v 2.0 and A. ceylanicum v 2.0, were

used as the basis for all subsequent analyses and are available for searching and acquisition by FTP at http://
www.nematode.net. "Fragmentation", defined as the representation of a single gene by multiple non-overlapping
clusters, was estimated by examining Ancylostoma clusters
with homology to C. elegans [17]. Overall representation
of Ancylostoma genes is based on a theoretical gene
number of 21,437, comparable to C. elegans wormpep97.
Analysis and functional assignments
Homology assignments – WU-BLAST sequence comparisons [63,64] were performed using A. caninum and A.
ceylanicum contig consensus sequences which were further
organized into clusters. Consensus sequences were used
to search multiple databases, including the non-redundant GenBank (3/20/2003) and Wormpep v.97 C. elegans
(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, unpublished) protein
databases. Internally constructed databases using intersections of data from Genbank, allowed examination of
sequences in specific phylogenetic distributions. Homologies were reported for E (expect) value scores of ≥ 1e -05.

To identify cases where Ancylostoma homologs in C. elegans have been surveyed for knock-down phenotypes
using RNA interference, Wormpep BLAST matches were
cross-referenced to a list of 17,042 C. elegans genes with
available RNAi information (20th February 2005) http://
www.wormbase.org. For each Ancylostoma cluster, only
the best C. elegans match was considered.
Functional classification – Clusters were assigned putative
functional categorization using two methods. First, InterProScan v.3.1 ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/
iprscan was used to search contig translations versus InterPro domains (11/08/02) [65,66]. Using InterPro, clusters
were mapped to the three organizing principles of the
Gene Ontology (GO_200211_assocdb.sql) [67]. Mappings are stored by MySQL database, displayed using
AmiGo (11/25/02) http://www.godatabase.org/cgi-bin/
go.cgi, and are available at http://www.nematode.net.
Second, clusters were assigned by enzyme commission
number to metabolic pathways using the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
(2/24/2004)[68]. All matches better than 1e-10 were
taken into consideration.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/58

from PAML [70], calculated the synonymous (dS) and
non-synonymous substitutions (dN) per ortholog pair. A
4-way orthologs were assigned by using SSEARCH [71,72]
to find the best C. elegans and C. briggsae homolog for
each ortholog pair of A. caninum and A. ceylanicum.
Orthologs were assigned if both sequences agreed on the
best hits. Multiple sequence alignments were performed
with MUSCLE [73]. Trees were built using the programs
'protml' and 'nucml' for protein and nucleotide sequences
respectively [26]. An exhaustive search was used first to
enumerate the possible topologies and then -R rearrangement search was used to identify the most likely branch
lengths and bootstrap values. Only genes for which well
supported topologies where A. caninum and A. ceylanicum
appeared as sisters were used in subsequent analysis. Tree
branch lengths were parsed and processed with Perl
scripts written using modules from the Bioperl package
and statistical tests were applied with the R package [74].
