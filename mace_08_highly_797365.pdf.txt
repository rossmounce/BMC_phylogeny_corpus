Abstract
Background: The early radiation of the Cetartiodactyla is complex, and unambiguous molecular
characters are needed to clarify the positions of hippotamuses, camels and pigs relative to the
remaining taxa (Cetacea and Ruminantia). There is also a need for informative genealogic markers
for Y-chromosome population genetics as well as a sexing method applicable to all species from
this group. We therefore studied the sequence variation of a partial sequence of the evolutionary
conserved amelogenin gene to assess its potential use in each of these fields.
Results and discussion: We report a large interstitial insertion in the Y amelogenin locus in most
of the Cetartiodactyla lineages (cetaceans and ruminants). This sex-linked size polymorphism is the
result of a 460–465 bp inserted element in intron 4 of the amelogenin gene of Ruminants and
Cetaceans. Therefore, this polymorphism can easily be used in a sexing assay for these species.
When taking into account this shared character in addition to nucleotide sequence, gene genealogy
follows sex-chromosome divergence in Cetartiodactyla whereas it is more congruent with
zoological history when ignoring these characters. This could be related to a loss of homology
between chromosomal copies given the old age of the insertion.
The 1 kbp Amel-Y amplified fragment is also characterized by high nucleotide diversity (64
polymorphic sites spanning over 1 kbp in seven haplotypes) which is greater than for other Ychromosome sequence markers studied so far but less than the mitochondrial control region.
Conclusion: The gender-dependent polymorphism we have identified is relevant not only for
phylogenic inference within the Cetartiodactyla but also for Y-chromosome based population
genetics and gender determination in cetaceans and ruminants. One single protocol can therefore
be used for studies in population and evolutionary genetics, reproductive biotechnologies, and
forensic science.

Background
About 240 to 320 million years ago, shortly after the
divergence of mammalian and avian lineages, progressive
X-Y differentiation began, following chromosomal interstitial rearrangements [1]. This resulted in a partial loss of
homology between both chromosomes which reached its
maximal extent in primates [2]. Amelogenin is the enamel
matrix protein that combines with hydroxyapatite crystals
to form enamel prisms in teeth [3]. The gene encoding the
amelogenin protein (Amel) is among the few genes
expressed from both X and Y chromosomes in placental
mammals (Eutheria) [4].
Evolutionary uncertainties about the basal diversification
of Cetartiodactyla
The Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates, whales and dolphins) radiated approximately 70–80 Myrs ago. The relative positions of the camelid, suiform (pigs),
hippopotamus, ruminant and cetacean (whales and dolphins) groups remain unclear, whether morphological or
molecular characters are used for attribution [5-9]. Moreover, polytomies (unresolved tree nodes) within some
Cetartiodactyla taxa [8] highlight areas for further data collection (both species and markers) and phylogenetic
research. This is a particularly delicate problem within
cetaceans, probably due to adaptative radiations within a
short period of time [10,11].
Y-chromosome sequence markers are needed for
population genetics
Males are the heterogametic sex in mammals, and usually,
unequal numbers of males and females transmit genes
from one generation to the next. Y-specific polymorphisms should allow the inference of sex-specific population parameters and decryption of breeding system
patterns and dispersal strategies. Overall, the use of Y-specific markers has been restricted to evolutionary studies of
human history and some scarce studies in population
genetics, perhaps because of the low diversity of these
markers [12]. Within Cetartiodactyla, genetic structure or
admixture, e.g. in sheep [13] or cattle [14,15], has made
use of a few Y-specific markers including microsatellites,
SNPs and indels.

The matrilineally transmitted mitochondrial control
region is commonly used as an informative sequence for
population genetics. An equivalent had not been found to
date on the Y chromosome. We considered the wellknown amelogenin gene to be of particular interest
because parts of it do not recombine between X and Y
chromosomes.
Molecular sexing
Sex-chromosome recombination discrepancies have been
exploited to develop many molecular sexing techniques.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/64

Although it can be ambiguous in some small populations,
the amelogenin locus is the most commonly used for gender determination in humans [16]. Accurate gender determination in mammals is crucial to various applications in
reproductive technologies, forensic investigations and
population management. Some techniques rely on specific amplification of loci localized on the Y chromosome
(such as Sry [17]) while others are based on amplification
of homologous fragments from both X and Y chromosomes (e.g. ZFX/ZFY [18]) or use both markers [19]. Each
of these has limitations, such as the need for multiplexing
with other markers or additional steps such as digestion,
labelling or sequencing. Several amelogenin-based techniques have expanded the taxonomic coverage of molecular sexing for Artiodactyla [20-22] but they have not yet
been extended to Cetacea. Therefore, there is a need both
for new methods that apply to a greater number of species
and to increase the number of cross-checking sexing
methods, especially in conservation biology [23].
In this study, we found out that sequence variations in the
amelogenin locus can be applied in evolutionary and
population genetics as well as for molecular sexing in the
highly diversified Cetartiodactyla group. We therefore carried out an evolutionary study of orthologous Amel-Y and
Amel-X sequences (exons 4 to 5) in Cetartiodactyla. We
studied four Cetacea (the striped dolphin, the bottlenosed
dolphin, Risso's dolphin and the fin whale) and three
Artiodactyla (cow, pig and sheep) species.

Results and Discussion
Amelogenin can be used for molecular sexing and
evolutionary genetics in Cetartiodactyla
Amplification of the studied segment of the amelogenin
locus using the species-specific SC1-SC2 primers resulted
in an obvious sex-related size polymorphism in all Cetacea
(Fig. 1) with a unique 521 bp band for females (two AmelX copies) and an additional 980 bp band for the Amel-Y in
males. This pattern was obvious in male Baleen whales
(Mysticetes) but there was no corresponding Amel-X
amplification in male dolphins unless by using the primers X5-X6 derived from the human amelogenin sequence.
Previous studies showed that amelogenin amplification
was prone to allelic drop-out or at least to preferential
amplification [24]. These phenomena may be explained
by several factors. Usually, amplification of the lesser
sized allele is favoured when the amount of polymerase is
a limiting factor or in case of template DNA degradation
[25]. Small amounts o DNA may also increase stochasticity of the annealing [26]. However, our results are not consistent with these situations since the allele favoured
(Amel-Y) is always the greatest one. On the other hand,
differences in GC content and mismatches in the annealing sequences may account for differential amplification.
The amelogenin fragments that we studied are character-

ized by a higher GC content when amplified from the X
chromosome (56%) than from Y-chromosome (47%).
This difference may result from a non-insertion in the
Amel-X fragment. This feature as well as a 2 bp-long mismatch between dolphin's Amel-X and the 5' end of the
reverse primer SC2 (Fig. 2) may favour preferential amplification of the Y copy in dolphins (Fig. 1b). Indeed,
amplifying male dolphin samples SC3 (primer without
mismatch, see Fig. 2) instead of the SC2, restores the two
bands, seen in baleen whales. The presence of this large
insertion in the Amel-Y copy can be used for sex determination in probably all cetacean species.
In order to define the breakpoints of the Y insertion location and investigate its evolutionary history, we
sequenced various cetaceans (listed in Methods;
sequences deposited under the following accessions:
EMBL:AM744958 to AM744971). After alignment with
available sequences from Artiodactyla (see list in Methods), we detected the same polymorphism in all other
Cetartiodactyla except the Pig (Fig. 3): a 460–465 bp insertion (size is a function of indels within different individuals or species) located between the 4th and 5th exons (188th

to 651st position of Y sequences e.g. EMBL:AM744958).
Haplotype names and their corresponding accessions are
given in Table 1. Sequence similarity was checked by running BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) over
GenBank nr/nt nucleotide collection sequences with
megablast algorithm (intended for high similarity
sequences). In addition to the bovine and ovine Amel-Y,
the only two relevant (78 and 83% homology, E-values
4.10-68 and 3.10-53) hits matched a fragment on the seventh chromosome in pigs (ca. 250 bp), suggesting the
insertion might be a transposable element.
We interpret the presence of this insertion as a synapomorphy (shared character) of the Cetartiodactyla excluding
pigs and probably other early derived groups (camels,
hippopotamuses; [27], see Fig. 3). In addition to this long
insertion, 46 other indels were detected by sequence
alignment (positions and sizes detailed in Figure 5).
Indels are particularly useful for testing phylogenic
hypotheses, as they can provide information about
ancient divergences rather than population information.
We therefore assessed whether phylogenetic topologies
differed if we took into account or not the information

contained in these indels. Thus, the cetacean sequences
summarized in Table 1 as well as Artiodactyla sequences
were analyzed first classically, with gaps coded as missing
characters, and secondly, with gaps coded as supplementary binary characters (see Fig. 5). For each analysis, two
independent Bayesian searches were performed. The phylogenetic trees presented in Figure 4 result from a consensus of 20,000 trees sampled after standard deviation
between the two runs dropped below 0.01. They show
highly supported nodes. The phylogenetic analysis performed on the complete segment (Fig. 4a) confirmed the
clustering by sex-chromosome copy in Cetartiodactyla
(Stenella cœruleoalba, Balænoptera physalus, Grampus griseus,
Tursiops truncatus, Bos taurus and Ovis aries) whereas AmelX and Amel-Y clustered together in other mammals (Homo
sapiens, Sus scrofa) together with Amel-X from Cetartiodactyla. On the other hand, phylogeny inferred without taking into account the insertion gave a different result (Fig.
4b): whereas haplotypes also clustered by chromosome in

cetaceans, no signal related either to species history or to
chromosome bearing could be seen in the other Cetartiodactyla. Hence, the phylogenetic signal related to species
history seems to strengthen as we follow the tree from
Cetartiodactyla towards primates. This partial, homoplasic,
persistence of the phylogenetic signal may be explained
by the influence of the region surrounding the insertion.
This could be the result of the old age of the insertion
(74–87 myrs [27]). The subsequent loss of homology may
have given rise to a more divergent evolution between
chromosomes in some taxa (Cetacea) than in others (Artiodactyla).
It would be interesting to study this region at the whole
clade level by combining sequence and indel characters in
the same analysis. This could give clues to test the many
hypotheses about basal radiation of Cetartiodactyla (e.g.
[5,6,8]). Given the presumably basal position of the Suioidea and Tylopoda in the Cetartiodactyla phylogeny ([7] and

Fig. 3), we hypothesize that the major evolutionary event
represented by the insertion (illustrated by an arrow Figure 4a) occurred once in the Cetacea-Ruminantia clade and
not in the remaining Cetartiodactyla.
The presence of this large insertion in the Amel-Y copy can
be useful for sex determination.
Evolutionary history also indicates that our sexing technique is applicable, in addition to cetaceans, to over a
wide range of Cetartiodactyla species including domestic
and wild species, in particular the widespread Ruminantia
(Bovidae, Capridae and most likely Cervidae). It is however
not suitable to Suiformes and further studies are required
to confirm that the technique is also not applicable to
Camelidae, given their even more basal position in the
Cetartiodactyla phylogeny.
Use in pedigree assessment and population genetics
In dolphins, the Amel-Y fragments amplified with the
SC1-SC2 primer pair were easily sequenced without the

need of cloning since amplification was Y chromosomespecific. From the ten Striped dolphin samples sequenced,
nine were males, and we could deduce seven distinct Yhaplotypes (one haplotype represented by three individuals and four individual haplotypes) bearing 64 polymorphic sites (nucleotide diversity π = 0.004 ± 0.0007). Half
of these were in the ~460 bp insertion. An alignment of
polymorphic sites is presented in Figure 5 (a). Strikingly,
these sequences showed two highly divergent haplogroups, diverging by a mean of 49 substitutions. This concords with our results that support the probable existence
of two subspecies within the Mediterranean sea (unpublished data). Moreover, one of these haplogroups displayed a high degree of polymorphism, with 24
informative sites, whereas the others showed only eight.
These values are sufficient for use in pedigree analysis and
population genetics, as the Y chromosome counterpart of
the mitochondrial d-loop in this species. Indeed, in
striped dolphin the intra-specific (inter-group) divergence
is greater than inter-specific divergence with a mean of 45
nucleotide substitutions between the striped dolphin and
fin whale sequences. There is an average of 0.048 ± 0.01
substitutions per site when comparing the two striped
dolphin populations. This is comparable to the divergence observed between each population and the Common dolphin (0.058 ± 0.03) and confirms that nucleotide
diversity is one order of magnitude higher than the range
observed (10-4) for Y chromosome markers in mammals
[12]. As for the mitochondrial d-loop, the size of the
amplified fragment slightly limits the use of the technique. Some degraded samples do not amplify; even so, a
particularly degraded sperm whale sample was still amplifiable (data not shown).
Since the Y chromosome population is expected to have a
small effective size, it is more likely to be affected by
genetic drift. Thus, it reflects more recent demographic
events such as bottlenecks, expansions or founder effects
[28]. To study this sort of event, one needs a marker
whose diversity is high enough to allow the reconstruction of gene genealogies with the least ambiguities and in
regions where recombination does not interfere with the
uniqueness of the trees. For this purpose, highly variable
microsatellites represent valuable markers but they
require intensive computing methods to take into account
uncertainties in the trees arising from alleles that are identical by state and not by descent (homoplasies) [29,30].
Adding a new sequence marker is therefore of interest for
Y-chromosome population genetics in Cetartiodactyla.
Moreover, the Bayesian estimate of mutation rate on each
edge of both trees in Fig. 4, jointly computed with phylogenetic inference, shows high values for a marker of
nuclear DNA: between 10-8 and 10-10 substitutions per site
and per year in all Cetartiodactyla branches. This value is

intermediate between those of mitochondrial d-loop and
nuclear DNA in mammals [31,32].
Functional perspectives in amelogenin evolution
We found two stop codons at amino acid positions 98 and
99 of exon 5 in all Y chromosome copies of amelogenin
in the four studied cetacean species (positions 988–993 of
sequence EMBL:AM744959). The Amel-Y gene product
may therefore be truncated in these species or represent a
pseudogene as already observed in species from most of
the other eutherian clades [33]

Conclusion
The 460 bp insertion studied represents a single-event
synapomorphy among most Cetartiodactyla. Together with
the presence of other numerous indels informative at the
order-level, it could help resolve the phylogenic discrepancies between hippopotamuses, pigs, camels and other
Cetartiodactyla observed by many authors [7-9]. In addition, we demonstrate higher diversity within a single
sequence than has yet been observed in multi-sequence
assays [34]. This high diversity should allow the use of this
sequence as the male counterpart of the mitochondrial

control region. The applications would include inference
of male-driven evolution in population genetics as
applied to breeding management; domestication studies
in archaeogenetics [35]; conservation biology (population history, sex-biased dispersal, admixture); or for testing sex-biased selection [28]. Amelogenin intron 4
amplification will also be an efficient tool for sexing Ruminantia and Cetacea. This will be useful for many fields of
veterinary and forensic science (embryo technologies, in
vitro fertilization, meat products). Finally, amelogenin
amplification could also be a helpful tool for conservation
biology through sampling of dead animals, faecal remains
and biopsies of free-ranging animals like whales and dolphins. Amelogenin amplification in Cetartiodactyla therefore is a simple, single-step procedure with a wide range of
applications.

We subsequently cloned and sequenced these PCR fragments and designed oligonucleotide primers specific to
the Artiodactyla. They are anchored in exons 4 and 5 of
Amel-X and Amel-Y, which allows complete amplification
of the 4th intron (SC1: 5'-CAAGCATGCATTTCAATTCCC3' and SC2: 5'-CTGCATGGGGAACATCGGAG-3'). Optimal PCR conditions were adjusted by using temperature
(49–62°C) and MgCl2 (1–2.5 mM) gradients. Following
this optimization step, the PCR amplifications were conducted in a reaction mix consisting of 477 mM KCl, 1 mM
Tris/HCl pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgC12, 250 μM each dNTP, 2
pmol/μl of each primer, 3 units of Taq polymerase in a
final volume of 25 μl. Cycling was conducted as follows:
95°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at
94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 45 s, extension at

72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 70°C for 10 min.
PCR products were run on 1.2% agarose gel ethidium bromide stained, alongside a 1 kbp ladder (New England
Biolabs, County Road, MA). In order to validate the assay,
the gender, if identified during examination of the
stranded carcasses, was recorded (22 out of 38 samples).
These amplifications were conducted in eight Cetacean
species: 20 Striped dolphin (Stenella cœruleoalba), five Fin
whales (Balaenoptera physalus), four Bottlenosed dolphins
(Tursiops truncatus), three Common dolphins (Delphinus
delphis), three Gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus), two
Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), one Minke whale
(Balænoptera acutorostrata) and one Risso's dolphin
(Grampus griseus).
Of these, we sequenced striped dolphins (9 males and one
female), fin whales (two males and two females), common dolphin (2 males), gray whale (one female) and
Risso's dolphin (one female). Sequencing was performed
on an ABI Prism sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) with the dye terminator protocol directly for
fragments amplified using the same (SC1-SC2) primer

Polymorphic sites and indels in the Amel-X and Amel-Y regions in the Cetacean species studied
Figure 5
Polymorphic sites and indels in the Amel-X and Amel-Y regions in the Cetacean species studied. (a) Nucleotide
positions are represented above and on the left side the names of the haplotypes. All positions are represented on the first
sequence and each matching nucleotide on the other haplotypes is represented by a dot. (b) Indels are numbered (first row)
following their order on the aligned sequences. They are characterized by their position (second row) and their length (third
row). In both tables, shaded areas corresponds to the region holding the large insertion.

pair or after cloning in pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI)
for fragments amplified using the X5-X6 pair. Each sample
was sequenced from at least two independent amplifications for greater reliability.
Bioinformatic analyses
The obtained sequences were aligned using ClustalW, a
clustering-based sequence alignment algorithm [37], with
bottlenosed dolphin (GenBank:AY787743S2), cow (GenBank:AB091789–AB091790), pig (GenBank:AF328419
and AB091792), sheep (GenBank:AY604731) and human
(GenBank:NT_011757 from 9098117 to 9098612 and
GenBank:NC_000024 from 6796200 to 6796719)
sequences. Striped dolphin haplotypes were named
according to membership in one of the two Mediterranean populations inferred by population genetic data on
mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA (data not shown).
Stenella cœruleoalba YAn thus represents the nth haplotype
from population 1 while Stenella cœruleoalba YBn represents the nth haplotype from population 2.

Given the high indel density in this region, data were
divided into two partitions: a sequence matrix (1120 characters corresponding to nucleotides) and a binary character matrix (presence/absence of the indels). Gap coding
was achieved using Modified Complex Indel Coding [39]
in which parsimony-informative gap characters were
scored from pairwise unambiguously aligned sequences.
Hence, a total of 47 gap characters were included (summarized in Figure 5b). We used a General Time Reversible
(GTR) model, allowing for a proportion of invariant sites
for sequence partition, and a binary F81-like model with
a variable ascertainment bias for the insert's absence/presence (state 0/state 1) for the binary partition. In this
model, π0 and π1 are the stationary probabilities of the two
states and π0/π1 the rate of transition from state 1 to 0.
Patterns of genetic diversity were computed using DnaSP
[40]. Specifically, the average number of substitutions was
computed using Nei's equations 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 [41].

Authors' contributions
Phylogenic inference was performed using a Bayesian
Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach, implemented in Mrbayes [38], that allows determining posterior probability of each node of the tree.

MM performed the experiments, manuscript writing and
editing.
