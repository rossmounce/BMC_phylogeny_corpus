Separation of the bacterial species, Escherichia
coli, from mixed-species microbial communities
for transcriptome analysis
Dongjuan Dai1, Diane Holder1,2,3, Lutgarde Raskin2 and Chuanwu Xi1*

Abstract
Background: The study of bacterial species interactions in a mixed-species community can be facilitated by
transcriptome analysis of one species in the community using cDNA microarray technology. However, current
applications of microarrays are mostly limited to single species studies. The purpose of this study is to develop a
method to separate one species, Escherichia coli as an example, from mixed-species communities for transcriptome
analysis.
Results: E. coli cells were separated from a dual-species (E. coli and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) community
using immuno-magnetic separation (IMS). High recovery rates of E. coli were achieved. The purity of E. coli cells
was as high as 95.0% separated from suspended mixtures consisting of 1.1 - 71.3% E. coli, and as high as 96.0%
separated from biofilms with 8.1% E. coli cells. Biofilms were pre-dispersed into single-cell suspensions. The reagent
RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used during biofilm dispersion and IMS to preserve the transcriptome of E. coli.
A microarray study and quantitative PCR confirmed that very few E. coli genes (only about eight out of 4,289 ORFs)
exhibited a significant change in expression during dispersion and separation, indicating that transcriptional profiles
of E. coli were well preserved.
Conclusions: A method based on immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) and application of RNAlater was developed
to separate a bacterial species, E. coli as an example, from mixed-species communities while preserving its
transcriptome. The method combined with cDNA microarray analysis should be very useful to study species
interactions in mixed-species communities.

Background
Microorganisms in natural environments rarely grow as
single species, but grow as mixed species consortia in
which a variety of intra- and inter-species interactions
take place [1,2]. Previous studies have shown that species interactions play an important role in the development, composition, structure and function of microbial
consortia in biofilms as well as in suspended growth
communities [3-5]. Studies of species interactions have
promoted the understanding of microbial activities in
mixed-species communities [6-8].
Identification of relevant genes is an important step
toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of

species communication. cDNA microarray technology
has been widely used for mono-species cultures, but only
a few cDNA microarray studies have been performed for
mixed-species consortia due to broad cross hybridization
among species [6,9,10]. Variable conservation of genes
existed across bacterial species [11]. Non-target transcripts have been shown to cross hybridize in oligonucleotide microarray studies [12]. The problem was
addressed previously by carefully selecting co-cultures
consisting of one gram-negative and one gram-positive
strain, so that RNA could be selectively extracted from
one strain [6,9]. However, for most mixed-species communities, selective RNA extraction is not possible and a
method needs to be developed in order to apply cDNA
microarray technology to such communities.
Separating the target species from other community
members before extracting RNA could be an approach

(polyclonal anti-E. coli antibody (ViroStat, Portland,
ME)) was used in this study. Using this antibody, the
recovery rate of E. coli was 74.4-98.2% when separated
from suspended cultures with a density up to 1.9 × 108
CFU/ml (Figure 1). However, the recovery rate dropped
to 59.8% for samples with ten-fold higher cells (1.9 ×
109 CFU/ml), which may have exceeded the capacity of
separation columns used in IMS (Figure 1). Therefore,
E. coli cell densities in samples were adjusted to less
than 2 × 108 CFU/ml for subsequent IMS.
Determining the recovery rate of target species is
important when IMS is used to separate target species
for subsequent cDNA microarray analysis. High recovery rates yield sufficient cells for RNA extraction, especially for low-abundance target species or when limited
sample amounts are available. High recovery rates of
E. coli were achieved from samples with a wide range of
cell densities (10 4 -10 8 CFU/ml). The recovery rates
observed in this study were generally higher than those
reported previously (53-82%) [20-22].
Purity of E. coli separated from dual-species cultures

Suspended mixtures containing 0.7-71.3% E. coli cells
(104-106 CFU/ml E. coli and 105-108 CFU/ml S. maltophilia)
were used to evaluate IMS for separating and purifying
E. coli cells from various communities. One-step IMS
enriched E. coli cells to a purity of over 95% from
mixtures with 38.3-71.3% E. coli cells (Figure 2A). But
the purity of E. coli cells after one-step IMS was too
low to be acceptable (32.1-52.8%) when separated
from mixtures containing less E. coli cells (0.7-13.4%)
(Figure 2A). Therefore, a second IMS was performed
and E. coli cells were successfully enriched to a high

in minimizing cross hybridization on microarrays.
Immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) using magnetic
force to recover target cells with paramagnetic beads
and specific antibodies has been widely used [13-15].
The IMS procedure has been standardized [16]. However, isolated cells have not been considered for cDNA
microarray analysis.
While the purity of recovered cells is important for
microarray analysis, it was not always considered in previous studies. In addition, preserving the transcription
profile of target cells during IMS is critical for downstream microarray analysis and is the most important
concern addressed in this study. RNAlater (Ambion,
Austin, TX) has been used to stabilize and protect cellular RNA during sample storage. However, the effect of
RNAlater on IMS separation efficiency has not been
explored previously.
This study tested and developed a method that can be
used to study the transcriptome of one species in
mixed-species communities, including suspended and
biofilm communities. Escherichia coli was selected as
the target species in this study and Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia as a background species, because we are
interested in the interactions between these two species
when E. coli forms biofilms in drinking water distribution systems. E. coli is an important indicator of fecal
contamination and is detected in some water distribution systems [17]. S. maltophilia is a ubiquitous species
in water systems. For example, the abundance of Stenotrophomonas spp. was 2-6% in a pilot drinking water
distribution system [18]. Isolation of both E. coli and
S. maltophilia from water filtration and distribution systems [19] suggests that they share the same niches in
engineered systems and that interactions between them
take place in such systems.
The efficiency of IMS to separate E. coli from various
suspended mixtures and biofilms consisting of E. coli
and S. maltophilia was evaluated in this study. The
recovery and purity of separated E. coli cells were
reported. Changes in the transcription profiles of E. coli
cells due to sample processing and cell separation were
quantified by cDNA microarray analysis and quantitative
PCR (qPCR) to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed method. We also discussed that the method could
be applied to study other species of interest in mixed
community systems and was not limited to the example
species used in this study as long as a specific antibody
for the target species is available.

one- or two-step IMS from (A) suspended mixtures and (B) biofilms of E. coli and S. maltophilia cells. Suspended mixtures were prepared by
mixing suspended E. coli cells (104-106 CFU/ml) with S. maltophilia cells (105-108 CFU/ml). Biofilms were scraped from a flow-cell system and
dispersed into suspensions of single cells (E. coli 2.3 × 106 CFU/ml, S. maltophilia 2.6 × 107 CFU/ml). Two independent IMS experiments were
performed for aliquots of dispersed biofilms. Error bars indicate standard deviations of two or three replicate plate counts.

purity of 95.9% from mixtures containing as little as
1.1% E. coli cells (Figure 2A).
Previous studies did not report whether other species,
such as S. maltophilia, would bind to the anti-E. coli
antibody [21-23]. The high purity of E. coli obtained by
one- or two-step IMS (> 95%) (Figure 2A) suggested
that cross-reactivity, if there was any, was not a concern.
Low purity of E. coli (32.1-52.8%) obtained from mixtures with small percentages of E. coli (0.7-13.4%) was a
result of a small fraction (1%) of S. maltophilia cells
accumulation in the LS columns, in which magnetically
labeled E. coli cells were held during washing. When
S. maltophilia was dominant in samples (e.g., S. maltophilia > 90% and E. coli < 10%), the relatively low accumulation of S. maltophilia (1%) yielded high number of
S. maltophilia cells in absolute terms, resulting in low
purity of E. coli after IMS. However, since the accumulated
S. maltophilia cells were not actually bound to the antiE. coli antibody, they were removed during the second
IMS, resulting in highly purified E. coli cells (Figure 2A).
Real dual-species biofilms harvested from flow cell
systems were used to investigate whether IMS could
also separate E. coli from biofilms. The biofilm matrix
was homogenized to disperse cell aggregates into a suspension of single cells before IMS. Two independent
separations were performed for aliquots of dispersed
biofilms. Two-step IMS was able to enrich E. coli to
around 95% from biofilms containing only 8.1% E. coli
(2.3 × 10 6 CFU/ml E. coli and 2.6 × 10 7 CFU/ml
S. maltophilia) (Figure 2B). The results demonstrated
the feasibility of using IMS to separate E. coli cells from
biofilms.

It is important to obtain target cells in high purity
from mixed species communities for subsequent cDNA
microarray analysis in order to effectively limit cross
hybridization. The results showed that a high purity of
E. coli cells could be obtained by IMS from different
mixed-species communities (suspensions or biofilms)
with various amounts of E. coli cells (0.7-71.3%).
Preservation of RNA integrity during cell separation

Preserving RNA integrity during IMS is critical when
collected cells are used for subsequent cDNA microarray analysis. RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) has been
used widely to preserve RNA in bacterial cells, but
the impact of RNAlater on IMS performance was
unknown. The recovery rate of E. coli dropped to 1% if
cells remained in RNAlater during the complete IMS
procedure. This may be the result of antibody denaturing by the global protein denaturing reagents present
in RNAlater. Alternative products, such as RNAprotect
(Qiagen, Germantown, MD), contain similar denaturing reagents and are expected to show similarly
reduced recoveries.
In order to overcome this problem, RNAlater was
removed during some steps of the IMS procedure. Samples were stored in RNAlater at 4°C overnight to allow
the reagent to penetrate into bacterial cells and to stabilize intracellular RNA. RNAlater was then removed and
bacterial cells were resuspended in separation buffer just
before incubation with antibody and microbeads. Onestep IMS enriched E. coli to a similar level as shown in
Figure 2A and removed over 99% of S. maltophilia cells
(data not shown). The results confirmed that the

Dai et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/59

modified protocol did not affect the recovery and purity
of E. coli processed by IMS.
Pre-stabilization in RNAlater, quick sample processing
(~30 min), low working temperature (4°C), and maintaining an RNAase-free environment were combined to limit
RNA degradation during IMS, since RNAlater had to be
removed during some steps of the IMS procedure. The
effectiveness of these strategies in preserving the integrity
of RNA was confirmed by observing, using agarose gel
electrophoresis, high quality RNA extracted from cells
treated with the IMS procedure (data not shown).
Impact of cell separation on E. coli transcription profiles

To evaluate whether gene expression profiles were changed during sample processing (biofilm dispersion) and
IMS cell sorting, cDNA microarray analysis was used to
compare gene expressions of E. coli cells without dispersion and IMS (unsorted cells) and with dispersion and
IMS (sorted cells). To eliminate the possible impact of
any non-target RNA (from the small amount (< 5%) of
S. maltophilia cells remaining in enriched collections),
pure cultures of E. coli rather than dual-species mixtures
were used to study changes in transcription profile of
E. coli due to cell separation. To this end, pure cultures
of E. coli were processed using the same procedure used
for dual-species biofilm treatment, including cell dispersion and IMS.
Differentially expressed genes were identified based on
fold-change and statistical significance compared to the
control (Figure 3) [24]. Only 10 and 45 of the 4,289 ORFs
exhibited differential expression in two independent

for all ORFs in microarray study I. Vertical lines show the cutoff of
fold-change of 2 (Log2 ratio of ± 1), while the horizontal line shows
the cutoff of p-value 0.05. Genes located in the left-bottom corner
(Log2 ratio <-1 and p-value <0.05) and in the right-bottom corner
(Log2 ratio >1 and p-value <0.05) were considered to have their
expressions changed due to dispersion/homogenization and IMS
(immuno-magnetic separation) cell sorting. A total of ten genes
were selected using these criteria, eight of which also differentially
expressed in the independent microarray study II.

microarray studies I and II, respectively (each microarray
study was performed with two technical replicates of
microarray slides and each microarray slide had three
built-in replicates). A complete list of the differentially
expressed genes is provided in Additional File 1: Full list
of genes differentially expressed in sorted E. coli cells.
Only eight of these genes showed consistent changes in
both of the independent microarray studies (Table 1),
with three genes up-regulated and five genes downregulated in sorted E. coli cells in comparison to unsorted
E. coli cells. The fold-change of gene expression ranged
from 2.7 to -4.6 (Table 1). Differential expression of the
eight genes in sorted and unsorted E. coli cells, as identified by the cDNA microarray analysis, was verified with
qPCR using the 16S rRNA gene as a housekeeping gene.
Seven out of the eight genes showed the same trend of
differential expression (up-regulated or down-regulated
in sorted cells) as revealed by the cDNA microarray analysis (Table 1). Moreover, the qPCR results indicated that
five out of the eight genes exhibited less than two-fold
change in sorted/unsorted cells. It suggested that the
actual number of genes affected by the performance of
IMS sorting may be even less than eight. It further confirmed the effectiveness in preserving the transcriptome
of E. coli cells by the method developed in this study.
This study developed and evaluated a method that can be
used to study the transcriptome of one species in mixedspecies communities, including suspended cultures and
biofilms. It was not surprising to find some genes with
changed expression after several treatment steps, i.e., cell
homogenization/dispersion, re-suspension in buffer, and
IMS cell sorting. However, the number of differentially
expressed genes was very low (eight genes correspond to
0.2% of the 4,289 ORFs). We further searched in the literature whether the eight differentially expressed genes
were involved in species interactions or biofilm formation, since this method was specifically developed to
identify genes involved in bacterial species interactions in
mixed-species communities, including in biofilm communities. None of the eight genes has been shown to be
involved in bacterial species interactions. With regard to
biofilm formation, only one of the eight genes, flhE,
showed a potential effect on biofilm formation by Salmonella typhimurium in one study [25]. Thus, it can be concluded that transcription profiles of enriched E. coli cells
were well preserved during IMS and the use of IMS to
separate E. coli showed no obvious adverse effects for
future applications of this method to study species interactions, including in biofilms.

Conclusions
Good recovery, high purity and preserved transcription
profiles of E. coli, which was used as an example species,
indicate that the method developed in this study can be

used to study transcription profiles of E. coli in a mixed
community with S. maltophilia. Although S. maltophilia
was used as the background species in this study, this
method can be used to remove other background species that exhibit little cross binding with the antibody
used, even if the background species would be phylogenetically closer to E. coli than S. maltophilia. Similarly
high recoveries and purities of E. coli were achieved
when sorted from mixtures of E. coli and a Salmonella
species (Dr. Matthew Chapman, personal communication). In addition, the method should not be limited to
studies of E. coli, and it can be applied to study other
species of interest for which specific antibodies are available. While antibody dosage and homogenization intensity need to be determined when separating other
species of interest, the basics of the method presented
here can be applied to other communities. The applicability of the method to study real mixed-species communities has been tested by our recent study in
identifying genes of E. coli involved in interactions with
S. maltophilia (manuscript in preparation). Gene identification of species interactions can lead to further our
understanding of mechanisms of species interactions as
shown by previous studies [9]. The method developed
here thus has the potential to contribute to studies in
which understanding the mechanisms of species interactions is an important component.

grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with
tetracycline (80 μg/ml) or gentamicin (20 μg/ml) at 34°C
with continuous shaking (200 rpm). Cells were pelleted
by centrifugation (3,300 × g, 4°C, 3 min), re-suspended,
and diluted in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4) supplied with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
(Pierce, Rockford, IL). A series of artificial mixtures of
E. coli and S. maltophilia were prepared by mixing the
PBS re-suspended and diluted E. coli and S. maltophilia
cells at different ratios.
Biofilms were cultivated on the inner surface of silicon
tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) in flow cell systems as described previously [26]. Briefly, a flow cell system was assembled, sterilized, and conditioned by
running 0.1× LB broth (10-fold diluted LB broth, 1 ml/
min) at room temperature (20-25°C). Operation was
paused for one hour to allow inoculation with S. maltophilia and E. coli mixed at a ratio of 1:1. After three
days of growth, biofilms were scraped into 1× PBS and
pre-homogenized on ice using a homogenizer (OMNI
TH, Marietta, GA) set at the lowest speed for 30 seconds. Biofilms were further dispersed into single cells
using the same homogenizer set at the maximum speed
for two minutes. Over 99% of bacterial cells in the biofilm matrix were dispersed into single cells. The dispersed biofilm cells were then diluted in 1× PBS (with
0.5% BSA) for IMS.

100 μl separating buffer (1× PBS, 0.5% BSA, 2 mM
EDTA, pH 7.4) (EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid).
10 μl streptavidin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn,
CA) were added and incubated at 4°C in the dark for
10 min. Separation of E. coli cells was performed in LS
columns and a midi MACS® separator (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) following the protocol provided by
the manufacturer, except that one more washing step
was added to remove more S. maltophilia cells. In a
two-step IMS, enriched cells from the first step IMS
were directly transferred into a new LS column for the
second separation. Densities of E. coli and S. maltophilia
cells in samples and IMS enriched collections were measured using a plate-counting method with selective agar.
Cell densities were used to calculate recovery and purity
of E. coli after IMS.
The protocol was amended with the use of RNAlater
when enriched cells were used for microarray study. Bacterial cells were re-suspended in RNAlater rather than
PBS after sample collection and kept at 4°C overnight,
followed by homogenization. RNAlater was removed and
cells were re-suspended in separating buffer just before
IMS. During column separation, the buffer was additionally supplied with 10% (v/v) RNAlater. Enriched cells
were immediately stored in RNAlater. The whole procedure was performed at 4°C. All buffers, reagents, and pipette tips were nuclease-free and pre-cooled.
Microarray study

Pure E. coli cultures were used to evaluate the effect of
separation on the transcriptome by microarray analysis.
Suspended E. coli cultures were harvested from an
annular reactor (1320 LJ, BioSurface Technologies,
Bozeman, MT), supplied with 0.1× LB broth (100 ml/h)
for 7 days after inoculation. Aggregates were removed
from broth cultures by filtration (5.0 μm Millipore, Billerica, MA). Suspended E. coli cells were immediately resuspended in RNAlater and stored at 4°C overnight.
One aliquot of RNAlater stored E. coli cells served as
the control ("unsorted” cells) and was kept in RNAlater
without further treatment. The other aliquot was treated
to acquire “sorted” cells as described above using the
amended protocol. Samples collected independently
from a second annular reactor served as a biological
replicate for the microarray study.
RNAlater was removed by filtration with a membrane
(0.22 μm, Millipore, Billerica, MA) from E. coli cells just
before RNA extraction for both “unsorted” and “sorted”
cell collections. RNA extraction was based on a hot
SDS/phenol protocol [27]. A step of bead beating (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK) for one minute was added to
break cells, and all phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
washes were performed in phase lock gels (5 Prime,
Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). DNA was removed

from extracted RNA with Turbo DNase treatment
(Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37°C for 30 min followed by
purification with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). The quality of RNA was examined by gel
electrophoresis using E-gel with SYBR Safer (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). High quality RNA was further re-precipitated, concentrated, and stored at -80°C.
RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers (pd(N)6) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ)
and labeled with Amersham CyDye Post-Labeling Reactive Dye (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) following the protocol provided by the Amino Allyl cDNA
Labeling Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The quantity and
labeling efficiency of cDNA was measured using a
NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington, DE).
Microarray slides for E. coli were purchased from the
University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB, Canada). Each
slide contained three replicates of 5,978 70-mer oligonucleotides representing three E. coli strains (4,289 of
them were for E. coli K-12). Sample preparation and
loading, slide prehybridization, hybridization and washing were performed according to Corning protocols
(GAPS II coated slides, Corning Inc., Lowell, MA). An
extended 4-h prehybridization using a higher BSA concentration (1 mg/ml) was found to perform best in
reducing background noise. Hybridization was in a
Corning Microarray Hybridization Chamber (Corning
Inc.) in 42°C water bath.
Microarray slides were scanned with a Virtek ChipReader (Virtek Vision, Waterloo, ON, Canada). Spots
on scanned images were recognized and pixel intensity
for each spot was quantified using the TIGR software
Spotfinder (v3.1.1). Gene expression data were analyzed
in the software Acuity 4.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). LOWESS normalization was performed for
every microarray with three iterations using a smoothing
factor of 0.4. Hybridized spots with oligonucleotides for
strain E. coli K-12 having a high QC (quality control)
value (> 0.1), good flag tags (A, B and C) in both Cy3/
Cy5 channels were chosen for further analysis. One
sample t-tests were performed across replicates. Stepdown Bonferroni-Holm was used for the correction of
multiple hypotheses testing. Genes with at least two-fold
change in expression (p-value < 0.05) were considered
to have changed expression during sample dispersion
and IMS. Microarray data were deposited in NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus database (GSE22885).
Quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Primers for qPCR confirmation of the differential
expression of eight identified genes in Table 1 are listed
in Additional File 2: qPCR primers for nine tested
genes. The primers were designed using the software

Primer Premier (Palo Alto, CA) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Annealing
temperatures and qPCR efficiency were optimized with
PCR products using E. coli genomic DNA as template.
The 16S rRNA gene was selected as the housekeeping
gene. The amplification efficiency for target genes was
near 100% and within 5% of the housekeeping gene of
16S rRNA. Total RNA from sorted and unsorted E. coli
cells were reverse transcribed to cDNA using a reverse
transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).
cDNA was diluted 10- and 100-fold and 1 μl was
assembled for qPCR reactions using the SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).
Differential expression of the same gene in sorted and
unsorted E. coli was calculated with the ΔΔCt method
from four replicates. The PCR program included a cycle
of 95°C for 10 min, 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C,
30 seconds at the optimized annealing temperature for
each set of specific primers and 30 seconds at 72°C,
and a melting curve analysis from 60°C to 95°C at
the end.
