Analyses of genome architecture and gene
expression reveal novel candidate virulence
factors in the secretome of Phytophthora infestans
Sylvain Raffaele, Joe Win, Liliana M Cano, Sophien Kamoun*

Abstract
Background: Phytophthora infestans is the most devastating pathogen of potato and a model organism for the
oomycetes. It exhibits high evolutionary potential and rapidly adapts to host plants. The P. infestans genome
experienced a repeat-driven expansion relative to the genomes of Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora ramorum
and shows a discontinuous distribution of gene density. Effector genes, such as members of the RXLR and Crinkler
(CRN) families, localize to expanded, repeat-rich and gene-sparse regions of the genome. This distinct genomic
environment is thought to contribute to genome plasticity and host adaptation.
Results: We used in silico approaches to predict and describe the repertoire of P. infestans secreted proteins (the
secretome). We defined the “plastic secretome” as a subset of the genome that (i) encodes predicted secreted
proteins, (ii) is excluded from genome segments orthologous to the P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes and (iii) is
encoded by genes residing in gene sparse regions of P. infestans genome. Although including only ~3% of
P. infestans genes, the plastic secretome contains ~62% of known effector genes and shows >2 fold enrichment in
genes induced in planta. We highlight 19 plastic secretome genes induced in planta but distinct from previously
described effectors. This list includes a trypsin-like serine protease, secreted oxidoreductases, small cysteine-rich
proteins and repeat containing proteins that we propose to be novel candidate virulence factors.
Conclusions: This work revealed a remarkably diverse plastic secretome. It illustrates the value of combining
genome architecture with comparative genomics to identify novel candidate virulence factors from pathogen
genomes.

Background
Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of the potato
and tomato late blight disease, is a successful cosmopolitan plant pathogen. Ever since the Irish potato famine in
the middle of the nineteenth century, P. infestans has
been recognized as one of the most problematic plant
pathogens with a global impact on both commercial and
subsistence agriculture [1]. This oomycete pathogen is
recalcitrant to low input disease management and
requires costly chemical treatments to be managed [2].
Part of P. infestans success is accounted for by its biological lifestyle and remarkable capacity to rapidly adapt
to overcome resistant plants [3]. On infected plants, it
continuously produces a large number of asexual spores,

including sessile aerially dispersed sporangia and motile
zoospores, resulting in polycyclic infections and fast
spreading late blight epidemics [4]. In addition, in many
regions of the world, P. infestans reproduces sexually
resulting in increased genetic diversity and extended
survival in the field [2]. Based on these biological and
epidemiological features, McDonald and Linde concluded that P. infestans is a plant pathogen with a high
evolutionary potential that can rapidly evolve virulence
on resistant plants [3].
Similar to a wide range of animal and plant pathogens,
P. infestans secretes proteins, termed effectors, that facilitate parasitic colonization by altering host plant physiology and suppressing immunity [5-7]. P. infestans
effector proteins target different sites in host plant tissue
[5,6,8]. First, some effectors act in the extracellular space
where they interfere with apoplastic plant defenses.

Inhibitors of plant extracellular proteases and glucanases
are such apoplastic effectors [9-13]. Other effectors,
such as small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRs), are also
thought to function in the apoplast but their effector
activities remain mostly unknown [5,14]. Second, a large
number of P. infestans effectors, classified as cytoplasmic
effectors, are delivered inside host cells using N-terminal
secretion and host-translocation signals [5,6,15]. This is
the case for members of the RXLR and Crinkler (CRN)
families. A subset of the RXLR effectors is recognized
inside plant cells by intracellular immune receptors of
the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR)
family (so-called resistance or R proteins), resulting
in the induction of hypersensitive cell death and immunity [16,17].
Evolutionary and comparative genomics analyses
revealed that Phytophthora effector genes have undergone accelerated patterns of birth and death evolution
with evidence of extensive gene duplication and gene
loss in the genomes of P. infestans, P. sojae, and P.
ramorum [15,18-20]. For instance, in P. infestans, only
16 out of the 563 predicted RXLR genes are part of the
“core ortholog” gene set (genes residing in 1:1:1 orthologous genome segments between P. infestans, P. sojae,
and P. ramorum) [15]. Also, effector genes frequently
show signatures of positive selection with extensive nonsynonymous sequence substitutions, leading to high
rates of amino acid polymorphisms [19,21,22]. In P.
infestans, the RXLR and CRN gene families are among
the most expanded relative to P. sojae and P. ramorum
[15]. These RXLR and CRN genes mostly populate
expanded regions of the P. infestans genome that have
low gene density and a high abundance of repeats in
marked contrast to the housekeeping “core ortholog”
gene set that occupy gene-dense and repeat-poor
regions [15]. Haas et al proposed that these gene-poor
repeat-rich loci are dynamic regions of the genome that
underpin the evolutionary potential of P. infestans by
promoting genome plasticity and enhancing genetic variation of effector genes. Similarly, virulence genes occur
in plastic repeat-rich and telomeric regions in various
pathogens, which is thought to increase genetic and epigenetic variation and could result in accelerated evolution [23-25].
All known oomycete effectors carry N-terminal signal
peptides for secretion outside pathogen cells [5,6,8].
Although signal peptide sequences are highly degenerate, robust computational prediction algorithms enable a
systematic survey of the secreted protein catalog (the
secretome) from the genome sequence of a given organism [26]. In particular, the SignalP program that was
developed using machine learning methods [27], can
assign signal peptide prediction scores and cleavage sites
to unknown amino acid sequences with a high degree of

Page 2 of 18

accuracy [28,29]. This program turned out to be particularly useful for the prediction of effectors from P. infestans and other filamentous pathogens as numerous
SignalP predictions have been validated experimentally
[30-35]. A combination of computational prediction
methods was used recently to generate a database
of the secretome from 158 fungal and oomycete organisms [36].
In the P. infestans genome, a majority of core ortholog
genes occur in gene dense regions (GDRs) and are
excluded from gene sparse regions (GSRs), which are in
contrast enriched in effector genes [15]. This distinctive
genome organization offers a unique opportunity to
identify novel candidate virulence genes. Furthermore,
although the secretome of P. infestans includes several
hundred candidate effectors belonging to multiple
classes, additional families of secreted proteins have not
been characterized in much detail [15]. In this study, we
used a computational approach to catalog the secretome
of P. infestans strain T30-4. We then defined and identified the “plastic secretome” as the set of secreted protein
genes that (i) do not reside in segments orthologous to
P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes, and (ii) reside in the
repeat-rich GSRs. This pipeline resulted in 561 proteins
(~3% of the total proteome), of which 398 have already
been annotated as effectors by Haas et al. [15]. Because
the pipeline identified many in planta-induced genes
and ~62% of all previously predicted P. infestans effectors, we concluded that the remaining 163 proteins
from the “plastic secretome” are enriched in novel candidate effectors. In particular, we highlight 19 genes that
are induced in planta and distinct from known effector
families. These analyses implicate trypsin-like serine
proteases, berberine-bridge enzymes, carbonic anhydrases, small cysteine-rich proteins and repeat-containing proteins as novel candidate virulence factors.

Results
Prediction and annotation of Phytophthora infestans
secretome

To identify the secretome of P. infestans (set of proteins
predicted to be soluble secreted), we predicted signal
peptides using the well-validated SignalP v2.0 and v3.0
programs and sub-cellular targeting using TargetP and
PSORT (see methods). To ensure stringent standards,
only proteins predicted secreted by the four methods
were considered further. To remove proteins likely to be
retained into P. infestans plasma membrane we excluded
those for which a transmembrane domain was predicted
after the signal peptide cleavage site by TMHMM (see
methods). In total, 1,415 of the 18,155 proteins of P.
infestans were predicted to form the secretome (Additional file 1). To complement existing annotation, we
performed detection of protein domains using Pfam and

Superfamily 1.73 HMM model databases and automated
GeneOntology (GO) terms mapping using Blast2GO
server (Additional file 1).
Major functional categories enriched in Phytophthora
infestans secretome

To document biological functions enriched in the P.
infestans secretome, we compared the frequency of
occurrence of Pfam domains and GO terms in the
secretome to the rest of the proteome using chi-square
tests (see methods). We found 15 “Biological process”
ontologies, 31 “Molecular function” ontologies and 43
Pfam domains to be enriched in the P. infestans secretome. Seven “Molecular function” ontologies and 4
Pfam domains were depleted from secretome (Figure 1).
Carbohydrate metabolic processes (GO:0005975, also
GO:0016052) showed the highest enrichment among
biological processes in the P. infestans secretome compared to the rest of the proteome (Figure 1A, green).
Related biological processes enriched in the secretome
include cell wall modification (GO:0042545) and organization (GO:0007047) processes, as well as catabolism of
polysaccharides (GO:0000272), specifically cellulose
(GO:0030245) and xylan (GO:0045493). In addition,
most of the proteins associated with the sphingolipid
metabolic process (GO:0006665) and lysosome organization (GO:0007040) ontologies show sequence similarity
to glycosyl hydrolases indicating that these two ontologies are also mostly related to carbohydrate metabolism
in P. infestans secretome. Consistently, 15 “molecular
function” ontologies directly or indirectly related to
sugar metabolism are enriched in the secretome (Figure
1B, green). Sugar binding (GO:0030248, GO:0030246,
GO:0005529) and sugar modification activities
(GO:0047490, GO:0008810, GO:0004650, GO:0030570,
GO:0030599, GO:0004089, GO:0016798, GO:004553)
are indeed predominantly found in the P. infestans
secretome. Furthermore, a majority of proteins associated to glucosylceramidase activity (GO:0004348), and
cation binding (GO:0043169) ontologies show similarity
to glycosyl hydrolases. Most of the proteins associated
to aspartyl esterase activity (GO:0045330) and lyase
activity (GO:0016829) show similarity to polygalacturonases and polysaccharide lyases respectively. This
enrichment indicates that sensing extracellular sugar
and degrading host cell wall are major functions of the
Phytophthora secretome as illustrated by several previous studies [37-39]. Finally, 15 Pfam domains enriched
in the secretome correspond to enzymes predicted to
act on sugars (Figure 1C, green), either as monomers
(PF01419 on mannose) or polysaccharides, including
cellulose (PF00734, PF01341), a- and ß-1,3 glucans
(PF01055, PF00332), ß-1,4 glucans (PF07745), xyloglucans (PF01670), rhamnoglucans (PF00295) and pectin

(PF03283, PF00544, PF01095, PF03211). Aldose 1epimerase (PF01263), responsible for interconversion of
D-glucose and other aldoses, completes the list of carbohydrate metabolism-related domains enriched in the P.
infestans secretome.
Pathogenesis (GO:0009405) and defense response
(GO:0006952) are biological process ontologies highly
enriched in P. infestans secretome (Figure 1A, red). The
corresponding proteins include some with similarity to
elicitins. The molecular function ontology with the highest enrichment in the secretome, endopeptidase inhibitor (GO:0004867), corresponds to Kazal-like serine
protease inhibitors, which have been linked to the infection process as apoplastic effectors [10,11,40] (Figure 1B,
red). Proteins corresponding to the glutamyltransferase
activity (GO:0003810) show similarity to transglutaminase elicitor-like proteins harboring the Pep-13 pathogen associated molecular pattern [41]. The Kazal-type
serine protease inhibitor domain is also found among
Pfam domains enriched the in secretome (PF07648,
PF00050) (Figure 1C, red), together with elicitin domain
(PF00964) and necrosis inducing protein domain
(PF05630). The Pfam domain showing the highest
enrichment in the secretome is the cysteine-rich PcF
domain (PF09461) that forms a two-alpha helices
domain rich in acidic residues and was reported to
cause leaf necrosis [42]. The PAN domain (PF00024) is
another cysteine-rich domain enriched in the P. infestans secretome. The PAN domain occurs in the Cellulose-Binding Elicitor-Like protein of Phytophthora
parasitica that causes necrosis and activates immunity
in plants [43]. Several other Pfam domains enriched in
the P. infestans secretome are cysteine-rich domains of
unclear functions, such as the GCC domain (PF07699),
EGF-like domain (PF07974) and the domains of
unknown function PF00188 and PF10287. Secreted proteins containing these cysteine-rich domains could play
a role in plant infection similar to known small
cysteine-rich proteins [14]. Generally, the secretome
appears enriched in small (50 to 150 amino acids) proteins and in proteins rich in cysteine (>5%) (Additional
file 2). Similarly, the P. infestans secretome shows higher
frequency of proteins with elevated (>10 or >30%) glycine content (Additional file 2). One such example is
the IPIB family [44] and its corresponding Pfam domain
PF10290 (Figure 1C).
Proteolysis (GO:0006508) is a biological process ontology enriched in the P. infestans secretome (Figure 1A,
brown). Consistently, serine type peptidase activity
(GO:0004252, GO:0008236) and peptidase activity
(GO:0008233) are molecular function ontologies that
are also enriched in the P. infestans secretome (Figure
1B, brown). Acid phosphatase activity (GO:0003993)
regroups another type of hydrolases enriched in the

Page 4 of 18

P. infestans secretome. Pfam domains implicated in peptide hydrolysis, namely trypsin domain (PF0089) and
calcineurin domain (PF00149), which show similarity to
acid phosphatases, are enriched in the secretome (Figure
1C, brown). In addition, proteins associated to isomerase
activity ontology (GO:0016853) mainly show similarity
to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase or disulfide isomerases. These enzymes are known to accelerate energetically unfavorable cis/trans isomerization of the
peptide bond preceding a proline to catalyze protein
folding [45,46].
Surprisingly, RNA processing (GO:0006396) appears
as a biological process enriched in the P. infestans secretome (Figure 1A, purple). Consistently, ribonuclease T2
(GO:0033897) and RNA methyltransferase activity
(GO:0008173) are molecular function ontologies
enriched in the secretome (Figure 1B, purple). The ribonuclease T2 (PF00445) and SpoU rRNA methylase
(PF00588) are Pfam domains also enriched in the secretome (Figure 1C, purple). RNA cleavage by ribonuclease
T2 was shown to be implicated in defense and selfincompatibility processes [47]. Some of these proteins
might be effectors that are translocated inside plant cells
to alter host transcription or DNA/RNA metabolism.
Extracellular nucleases have been described in the fungi
Ustilago maydis and Aspergillus spp. [26,48].
Proteins related to oxidoreduction were also particularly abundant in the P. infestans secretome. Secreted
proteins classified under the one-carbon metabolic process ontology (GO:0006730) (Figure 1A, blue) show
similarity to carbonic anhydrase enzymes, catalyzing the
conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate
and protons. The corresponding Pfam domain (Eukaryotic-type carbonic anhydrase, PF00194) is enriched in the
P. infestans secretome (Figure 1C, blue). Monooxygenase
activity (GO:0004497) and monophenol monooxygenase
activity (GO:0004503) are molecular function ontologies
enriched in the secretome (Figure 1B, blue). Also
enriched in the secretome are tyrosinase Pfam domain
(PF00264), found in copper monooxygenases involved in
the formation of pigments and polyphenolic compounds,
and peroxidase Pfam domains (PF00141, PF01328).
FAD-binding domain (PF01565) and berberine-like
domain (PF08031), which occur in the same set of
secreted proteins, complete the list of oxidoreductionrelated domains enriched in the secretome.
Other ontologies enriched in the P. infestans secretome include generic activities such as catalytic
(GO:0003824) and hydrolase (GO:0016787) activities,
associated largely to predicted glycosyl hydrolases. Copper ion binding (GO:0005507) is another molecular
function enriched in the secretome. The pheromone
activity (GO:0005186) enriched in the secretome is
found in proteins similar to temptins, which mediates

protein-cell surface contact during fertilization in mollusks [49]. A Phospholipase D (PLD) motif (PF00614) is
among the Pfam domains enriched in the P. infestans
secretome. Phytophthora PLD activities were proposed
to be involved in zoospore encystment [50] and host
membrane modification [51] but these secreted PLDs
could target host membranes.
Molecular function ontologies depleted from the P.
infestans secretome (Figure 1B, grey) are generic binding
activity (GO:0005488) and more specifically zinc ion
binding (GO:0008270), protein binding (GO:0005515)
and nucleotide- and nucleoside-binding (GO:0003677,
GO:0003676, GO:0000166, GO:0005524). Proteinprotein interaction Pfam domains such as WD
(PF00400) and ankyrin repeat (PF00023) are depleted
from the P. infestans secretome, together with the protein kinase domain (PF00069) and ABC transporter
domain (PF00005).

genes. The GSRs (genes with 5’FIR and 3’FIR > 1.5 kb)
include 4030 genes, corresponding to 22.1% of the
genes. The other two quadrants group genes with asymmetric FIRs, one shorter than 1.5 kb and the other one
longer. We counted 6216 (34.2% of the genome) genes
residing at the border of GDRs and GSRs. Finally, 1220
genes (6.7% of the genome) were omitted because they
lack one resolved FIR (locate at one border of scaffolds)
or overlap with other genes.
An example of a genome browser view further illustrates the organization of a representative genome
region into GDRs and GSRs (Figure 2C). This 80 kb
area of P. infestans supercontig 1.13 contains a 60 kb
GSR flanked by short GDRs. As opposed to GSR genes,
all the GDR genes belong to genome segments orthologous to the P. sojae or P. ramorum genomes. All the
secreted protein genes in this region occur in the GSR.
Gene sparse regions are enriched in secreted proteins

Delimitation of gene dense and gene sparse regions in
the P. infestans genome

Because the GSRs of the P. infestans genome are highly
enriched in RXLR and CRN effector genes, we hypothesized that this property could be used to identify novel
effector candidates. First, we needed to determine quantitative parameters that distinguish between GDRs and
GSRs. To achieve this, we simulated core ortholog genes
content in GDRs and GSRs (as % of total genes falling in
each of these regions) using values of the length ‘L’ of
flanking intergenic regions (FIRs) between genes ranging
from 100 bp to 5 Kb (Figure 2A, blue and red lines
respectively). Genes with both FIRs above L were considered GSR genes, whereas genes with both FIRs below L
were considered GDR genes. Core ortholog segregation
rate was defined as the difference between the core
ortholog content of the GDRs vs. GSRs (green line). For
low L values, many core orthologs were excluded from
the GDRs since only very tightly packed genes were
assigned to them. On the other hand, with larger L
values, more genes were assigned to GSRs progressively
reducing the proportion represented by the core orthologs. The highest segregation value was obtained for L =
1.5 kb. At this cutoff, 90% of the core orthologs were
assigned to GDRs (black line) and constituted 55% of the
GDR genes. In contrast, at L = 1.5 kb, only 17.6% of GSR
genes were core orthologs. We therefore selected L = 1.5
kb for subsequent analyses because this value provided
the best segregation between the core ortholog and effector genes into the GDR and GSR genomic compartments.
The 1.5 kb cutoff delimits four coherent gene pools
when combined with the 2-variables binning representation previously performed by Haas et al. [15] (Figure
2B). The GDRs (genes with 5’FIR and 3’FIR < 1.5 kb)
contain 6689 genes representing 36.8% of P. infestans

GSRs contain 49.3% of the secretome genes even though
they contain only 22.1% of the total P. infestans genes
(Figure 2D). Consistent with previous analyses by Haas
et al. [15], GSRs contain 65.8% of the effector genes,
and more specifically 70.2% of the RXLR and 58.3% of
the CRN genes. Compared to the whole genome, the
GSRs show a two-fold enrichment in secreted protein
genes, and a three-fold enrichment in effector genes.
In addition, 82.8% of secretome, 95.1% of effector,
97.4% of RXLR and 95.5% of CRN genes are excluded
from the GDRs (occur in both the GSRs and at GDR/
GSR borders). Of the known effectors, only 4.9% are
found in the GDRs, with only 14 out of 540 RXLR effector genes and 6 out of 132 CRN genes.
The “plastic secretome” of P. infestans: secretome genes
excluded from genome segments orthologous to P. sojae
or P. ramorum and residing in GSRs

One defining feature of P. infestans effector genes is that
they have significantly diverged from their counterparts
in P. sojae and P. ramorum and are typically excluded
from orthologous segments [15,19]. Orthologous segments (OS) are defined as genome segments derived
from a common ancestor without large rearrangements,
therefore containing genes showing homology, collinearity, conserved order and orientation in different species
[52,53] (Additional file 3). We found that although only
41.9% (7948) of the total genes and 65.7% of the secretome genes are excluded from segments orthologous
between at least two of the examined Phytophthora species, this proportion reaches 89.1%, 93.8% and 96.6% for
all effector, RXLR and CRN genes, respectively
(Figure 3A). We therefore hypothesized that we could
significantly enrich in candidate effector genes using the
combination of three criteria: (i) secreted protein,

Figure 2 Delimitation and effector content of Phytophthora infestans gene sparse regions (GSRs). A) Simulation of core ortholog gene
segregation. Genes with both flanking intergenic regions (FIRs) longer than a value ‘L’ were considered as gene-sparse region (GSR) genes,
whereas genes with both FIRs below L were considered as gene-dense region (GDR) genes. To quantitatively define GSRs, the % core orthologs
among total genes falling in GDRs (blue) and GSRs (red) was calculated for values of L ranging from 100 bp to 5 kb. Core ortholog segregation rate
was defined as the difference between the core ortholog content of the GDRs vs. GSRs (green). The percentage of core orthologs assigned to GDRs
is shown as a black line. The highest core ortholog genes segregation rate was obtained for L = 1.5 kb. B) Distribution of P. infestans genes
according to the length of their FIRs. All P. infestans predicted genes were sorted into 2-variable bins according to their 3’FIR (Y-axis) and 5’FIR
(X-axis). The number of genes in bins is shown as a contour graph with a color code. The 1.5 kb limit for GSRs genes (dotted lines) delimits three
groups of genes: genes in GDRs, GSRs, and in between (corresponding genes features and numbers are indicated in labels). C) A sample window
from the P. infestans genome browser illustrating typical examples of GDRs and GSR (red background). In this 80 kb region, core ortholog genes are
exclusively found in GDRs, secretome genes (yellow) and genes excluded from orthologous segments (OS, red box) are excluded from GDRs. D)
Distribution of gene groups into the GDRs and GSRs of P. infestans. The proportion of non-secreted, secretome, known effectors, RXLR effector
genes and CRN effector genes that occur in GSRs (red, with % indicated), GDRs (blue with % indicated) and in between (yellow) is shown.

(ii) exclusion from OS, and (iii) occurrence in the GSRs
or FIR not determined. In total, 561 genes fulfilled these
three criteria (Figure 3B). Genome regions showing frequent re-arrangements, particularly in pathogenic bacteria, have been referred to as “plasticity zones” [54,55].
We therefore refer to the 561 gene set identified here as

the “plastic secretome” of P. infestans to reflect their
localization in plastic genome regions.
The plastic secretome is highly enriched in effectors

Of the 561 genes assigned to the plastic secretome, 398
(70.9%) are annotated as effectors. Also, even though

Raffaele et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:637
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/637

Page 7 of 18

the 561 genes correspond to less than 3.1% of the whole
genome, they include 61.9% of all known effector genes
(67.4% of RXLR genes and 55.2% of CRN genes, Figure
3C and additional file 4). This clearly indicates that the
plastic secretome is highly enriched in effectors and that
the remainder 163 genes are likely to be enriched in
novel candidate virulence genes.
Genes from the plastic secretome are enriched in genes
induced in planta

To identify candidate virulence genes among the genes
from the plastic secretome, we used the whole-genome
microarray expression data of P. infestans infection time
course on potato and tomato [15]. Overall, the genes
from the plastic secretome showed a higher proportion
of genes induced in planta relative to the remainder of
the genes (Figure 3D). In particular, during the early biotrophic phase of infection (2 dpi of potato or tomato) 816% of the genes from the plastic secretome are induced
relative to less than 4.5% of the remaining genes (Figure
3D). In total, 95 of the 561 genes from the plastic secretome were classified as induced in at least one of the in
planta time points tested (Additional files 1 and 5).

We examined in more details 19 genes from the plastic
secretome that have not been previously annotated as
effector genes and are induced in planta (Table 1, Additional file 6). Five candidates were annotated as cell wall
degrading enzymes (CWDEs): PITG_02545 and
PITG_08563 show similarity to pectin lyases,
PITG_20953 has an aldose 1-epimerase domain found
in some groups of glycoside hydrolases, PITG_22758 is
related to arabinofuranosidase, and PITG_22899 has a
Jacalin-like lectin domain predicted to bind mannose.
Four candidates have other predicted enzymatic activity,
including trypsin-like serine protease activity
(PITG_02700), oxidoreductase activity (PITG_02930
berberine-bridge enzyme and PITG_18284 carbonic
anhydrase) and putative mannose processing activity
(PITG_22638). Two candidates are effector-like proteins:
PITG_23138 is a truncated RXLR effector that was
missed in earlier annotations [15] and PITG_16958 possess the Pep13 motif found in transglutaminase elicitors.
Three candidates are repeat-containing proteins (RCPs):
PITG_06957 and PITG_17477 have glycine-rich motifs
while PITG_06212 harbors lysine-rich repeats. Two candidates are small cysteine-rich proteins (SCRs,
PITG_04202, PITG_07213) not previously described.
Finally, three candidates (PITG_01659, PITG_07586,
PITG_21363) do not have significant similarities to
known proteins and sequence motifs. Some of these
candidates are described in more details hereafter.

Secreted trypsin-like serine proteases related to
glucanase inhibitor proteins

PITG_02700 encodes a predicted trypsin-like serine protease related to Glucanase Inhibitor Proteins (GIPs),
which are catalytically inactive proteases that function as
apoplastic effectors [9,13]. PITG_02700 belongs to a
family of 19 paralogs in P. infestans among which 11 are
predicted to be secreted (Figure 4A). Only two out of
the 19 corresponding genes reside in GDRs (Figure 4B).
Unlike the GIPs, the catalytic triad of PITG_02700 is
intact suggesting a functional serine protease (Figure
4A). Similar to some GIP genes (Figure 4C),
PITG_02700 and its closest paralogs PITG_02704 and
PITG_21623 are induced in planta at 2 dpi (Figure 4D).

Berberine bridge enzymes

PITG_02930 has similarity to berberine bridge enzyme
(BBE) genes. BBEs are flavoenzymes related to oligosaccharide oxidases found in archaea, bacteria, plants and
fungi. They are involved in the generation of reactive
oxygen species and in the synthesis of alkaloids in
plants. Five BBE isoforms were predicted in the P. infestans genome, all of which harbor a predicted signal peptide. To gain insights into the impact of sequence
polymorphisms on the activity of these enzymes, we
aligned the BBE sequences to well characterized homologs from plants and fungi (Figure 5A, Additional file 7)
and modeled the 3D structure of P. infestans BBEs (Figure 5B). All five P. infestans BBEs possess the three

residues required for FAD cofactor binding in fungal
glucooligosaccharide oxidases (GOOX, related to BBEs,
Figure 5A) and show a good conservation of the FADbinding and BBE domains compared to their plant and
fungal counterparts (Figure 5A and 5B, ‘2’ and ‘4’). Polymorphic residues within the P. infestans BBE clade are
mostly found in the sugar-binding region (Figure 5A
and 5B ‘1’). The substrate binding groove region of Phytophthora BBEs (Figure 5A and 5B ‘4’) is divergent from
BBEs in other species. The binding groove is widely
open in fungal GOOX presumably to accommodate a
range of substrates. In contrast, the binding groove in
the P. infestans modeled BBE is largely obstructed by a
coil of amino acids running from one side to the other
of the binding pocket (Figure 5A and 5B, ‘3’). These
observations suggest that P. infestans BBEs may have
evolved to recognize a distinct set of substrates relative

to their fungal and plant counterparts. P. infestans BBE
genes are all excluded from GDRs (Figure 5C) and are
either weakly (PITG_02935, PITG_06585) or strongly
(PITG_02930, PITG_02928, PITG_06591) induced at
2 dpi in planta (Figure 5D).
Alpha carbonic anhydrases

PITG_18284 was annotated as an alpha-carbonic anhydrase (a-CA). The P. infestans genome encodes 13 predicted a-CAs among which seven belong to the
secretome. To explore the structural properties of the P.
infestans a-CAs, we aligned their sequences to the closest human homologs and to tobacco NEC3 a-CA (Figure 6A, Additional file 7), and modeled the 3D structure
of PITG_18284 and PITG_17842 (Figure 6B). When
compared to human and tobacco homologs, P. infestans
a-CAs show a conserved core surrounding the active

site (Figure 6A and 6B, ‘2’ SEHT motif of ‘3’, ‘4’ and ‘7’)
with conserved catalytic residues (with the exception of
PITG_08497). On the contrary, regions at the surface of
the enzyme are variable between P. infestans a-CAs and
differ from human and tobacco enzymes (‘1’, ‘5’ and ‘6’,
residues surrounding the SEHT motif of ‘3’). This notably results in the absence in the P. infestans enzymes of
an alpha helix gating the entry of the zinc-binding
pocket in human enzymes. Residues in this alpha helix
are in close proximity with sulfonamide inhibitor in
human models suggesting that P. infestans a-CAs may
have evolved alternative docking properties at the
entrance of the zinc-binding groove. All P. infestans aCA genes, except PITG_08497, are excluded from GDRs
(Figure 6C). Whereas the P. infestans a-CA genes that
encode non-secreted enzymes are not induced in planta
(PITG_17808 and PITG_17844 in Figure 6D), most of
the genes encoding secreted a-CAs are strongly induced
either early (PITG_17842 and PITG_18284) or late
(PITG_14412) during plant infection (Figure 6D).
Novel small cysteine-rich (SCR) proteins

Many filamentous pathogen effectors encode small
(<150 amino acids) secreted proteins with an even number of cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges [5].
We found 265 small (50 to 150 amino-acids) cysteine-

rich (>5% of sequence) in P. infestans (Additional file 8).
Among them, 59 are predicted to be secreted, 17% of
which are induced in planta (Additional file 8). In particular, PITG_04202 is a gene from the plastic secretome
that encodes a 94 amino acid SCR with six cysteines
(Figure 7). It has one close paralog (PITG_04213) that
encodes a 99 amino acid protein with the six cysteine
residues conserved. PITG_04202 is induced in planta
during the biotrophic phase similar to previously studied
SCR effectors such as SCR91, SCR50, and SCR58.
Repeat containing proteins (RCPs)

Many microbial adhesins are repetitive proteins with different types of repeats, such as glycine-rich repeats.
Some oomycete repeat containing proteins are secreted
proteins that are thought to function in adhesion, and
include P. infestans mucin-like protein CAR90 [56], IPIB
[44], and M96 mating-specific proteins [57]. Several of
the P. infestans genes from the plastic secretome that
are induced in planta encode repeat-containing proteins
not described to date. PITG_17477 encodes a 374
amino acid protein with more than 30% glycine residues
due to 48 [VA][GS]GG repeats. It has one close
paralog in P. infestans, PITG_05807 (Figure 8A). The
PITG_17477 gene is induced during the biotrophic
phase of potato infection (Figure 8B).

(PITG_14412). Expression of the effector gene Avr3a is given as a reference. Dpi, days post inoculation.

PITG_06957 encodes a 247 amino acid protein with
53 glycine residues organized in 22 imperfect GGSxET
repeats (Figure 8A). This gene lacks paralogs in P. infestans, and this class of repeats is absent from other P.
infestans proteins. PITG_06957 is induced two-fold during the biotrophic phase of potato infection (Figure 8B).
Besides Glycine-rich repeat containing proteins,
PITG_06212 is a 232 amino acid protein that contains
64 lysine residues organized in 11 KKE repeats followed
by 10 DxGEKSKKx repeats (Figure 8A). The same
repeat pattern was observed in the sequence of the protein encoded by the paralogous gene PITG_13157.
PITG_0621 is induced during the biotrophic phase of
potato infection (Figure 8B).

Discussion
We exploited genome organization to augment other criteria for selection of candidate virulence genes in the
oomycete plant pathogen P. infestans. Based on the work
of Haas et al. (2009), genome organization appears to be a

good indicator of virulence genes in P. infestans. Can this
strategy be extended to explore and identify novel effectors
from other pathogens? Effector genes often occur in plastic genomic regions. A remarkable example is the plant
pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans in which the
AvrLm1, AvrLm6 and AvrLm4-7 effector genes reside in
100 kb or larger AT-rich gene-poor isochores [58-60]. In
other plant pathogenic fungi, such as Alternaria alternata
[61], Mycosphaerella graminicola [62], and Fusarium graminearum [63], some effector genes are carried in conditionally dispensable chromosomes. Localization of
effectors in plastic genome regions also extends to animal
pathogens. Host-translocated effectors from Plasmodium
are often found near telomeric regions of chromosomes
[25]. These specific effector genome niches in eukaryotic
pathogens are reminiscent of the highly variable bacterial
pathogenicity islands that carry clustered translocation
machinery and effector genes [64]. In summary, localization of effector genes to dedicated plastic regions of pathogen genomes is a frequent occurrence. The strategy we

applied in this work enabled the identification of previously overlooked candidate virulence genes and is in
principle applicable to a wide range of eukaryotic pathogenic microorganisms.
Plastic genome regions can take several forms such as
dispensable chromosomes or telomeric regions. Are
there conserved features that characterize plastic genome
regions? How can we recognize them? High density of
active mobile DNA transposable elements (TEs) can be
considered a signature of variable genome regions. TEs
have long been considered “selfish genes” for causing
chromosomal breaks, deletions, or translocations [65].
But several studies now show that TEs are major drivers
of rapid evolution and functional diversification of gene
families [66] as well as evolution of gene regulation
[67,68]. TEs tend to accumulate around genes involved
in stress response, defense and response to external cues
[66]. The length of the intergenic regions flanking each
gene reflects the impact of TEs on local gene density.
Analysis of the distribution of FIRs helps to visualize
localized and differential TE activity and to identify plastic genome regions [15]. In this regard, P. infestans stands
out by its dramatic uneven distribution in FIR lengths
that results in a clear demarcation of GDRs vs GSRs (Figure 2B). This extreme property of the P. infestans genome allowed us to quantify the degree of association
between effector genes and plastic genome regions.
Clearly, effector genes almost exclusively reside in GSRs,
supporting a contribution of TE activity to effector evolution (Figure 2D).

Among the novel candidate virulence genes we identified, there were two types of oxidoreductases (berberine-bridge enzyme and alpha-carbonic anhydrase). The
presence of enzymes catalyzing conversion of rather
simple molecules within the plastic secretome of
P. infestans is perhaps surprising. What role may such
catalytic enzymes play in the interaction between P.
infestans and host plants? How do polymorphisms in
these enzymes affect host interactions? BBEs are flavoenzymes that catalyze carbohydrate oxidation in
plants, either for the biosynthesis of berberine type alkaloids, or for the generation of hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2). Plant BBEs are highly induced during various
defense responses, when they may contribute to the oxidative burst leading to cell death, through H2O2 synthesis. CAs typically function in acid-base balance control
by rapidly converting carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. CA
activity is also required for the onset of disease resistance in tobacco. Silencing of a CA gene in the plant
Nicotiana benthamiana results in enhanced susceptibility to P. infestans [69] and a salicylic acid binding protein SABP3 exhibiting CA activity is required for the
onset of the hypersensitive response toward the bacterial
plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens [70]. Therefore oxidoreductases might be involved in triggering or
enhancing host cell death responses during the necrotrophic phase of P. infestans growth. Alternatively, H2O2
production may contribute to plant cell wall degradation
by P. infestans. The ability to degrade alkaloids may also
contribute to virulence of various plant pathogens [71],

for instance by counteracting antimicrobial properties of
plant-synthesized alkaloids (such as berberine) and sulfonamides (such as quinine, potent inhibitors of a-CAs)
[72,73]. In any case, it is possible that evasion of plant
inhibitors (e.g. plant-specific sulfonamides) contributes
to rapid evolution in P. infestans secreted BBE and aCA enzymes. Plant secondary metabolites are structurally highly diverse, and their corresponding biosynthetic
genes are frequently associated with divergent genome
regions [74,75]. Plant-pathogen arms race coevolution
might result in a parallel highly divergent detoxification
arsenal in pathogen genome. The examples of BBE and
a-CA described here emphasize the need for integrated
metabolomic surveys of plant-pathogen interactions.
Cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) are a hallmark
of filamentous pathogen secretomes [26,76,77]. A
diverse repertoire of secreted CWDEs matches the variety of sugar polymers that make up plant cell walls.
Two P. infestans genes from the plastic secretome,

PITG_02524 and PITG_08563, are predicted pectin
lyases, which are known in other pathogens as virulence
factors that degrade the pectic components of plant cell
walls [78]. Another gene from the plastic secretome,
PITG_22758, is related to concanavalin A lectins/glucanases, which carry out the acid catalysis of beta-glucans
[79] or function in cell recognition in eukaryotes [80].
In plants, lectins show a wide variety of protein structures and sugar binding properties that matches the
diversity of sugar molecules [81]. It is therefore reasonable to correlate the diversity of P. infestans secreted
CWDEs to the complexity of the plant cell wall. But
how to explain the high divergence observed in the
CWDEs in plastic regions? First, plant cell walls are
highly variable from one plant species to another and
between different stages of plant development [82].
Therefore secreted CWDEs genes residing in plastic
genome regions may have enabled faster adaptation to a
new host or tissue (for instance, leaf vs root). Second,

Raffaele et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:637
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/637

plants have evolved a number of CWDE inhibitors as a
pathogen defense mechanism [83]. Rapid evolution in P.
infestans secreted CWDEs may have been driven by
arms race coevolution with host inhibitors. Third, cell
wall degradation products can act as damage-induced
molecular patterns (DAMPs) and trigger plant immune
responses [84]. P. infestans CWDEs may therefore
evolve to minimize DAMP induction. In summary, localization of particular carbohydrate binding protein genes
in plastic genomic regions may have contributed to the
pathogenic success of P. infestans.
It is well accepted that due to metabolic costs and spatial constraints, genome expansion is globally selected
against unless it provides an important functional advantage [85]. Although evidence for the contribution of noncoding DNA expansion to gene evolution continues to
accumulate, the mechanisms that enable faster gene evolution remain poorly understood. Unlike housekeeping
genes, most effector genes show a “patchy” phylogenetic
distribution, being present in P. infestans but lacking in
P. sojae and P. ramorum. Similar properties are typical of
the virulence genes of a variety of fungal and oomycete
pathogens [6,86]. This can be due to high rates of mutations, gene loss, copy number variation (CNV), or horizontal gene transfer that are thought to occur more
frequently in plastic regions of the genome. One example
is the large specific deletion spanning AvrLm1 that is
responsible for gain of virulence on Rlm1 plants in L.
maculans [23]. Similar gene deletions were reported for
several fungal plant pathogen avirulence loci, such as
Avr9 and avr4E of Clasdosporium fulvum [87], SIX1 of
Fusarium oxysporum [88] and Avr1-CO39 and Avr-Pita
of Magnaporthe grisea [89,90]. Additionally, an excess of
CNV and increased sequence polymorphisms were noted
toward chromosomal ends in Plasmodium spp. [91].
Such genome remodeling might preferentially occur in
regions with extensive non-coding DNA because of
reduced deleterious consequences to cis-linked genes
[92]. Another hypothesis is that longer flanking regions
enable the development of more tightly and accurately
regulated expression patterns [65,92], possibly through
epigenetic variation [90,93]. Future comparative genomics of clusters of closely related pathogen species will
help to further clarify the mechanisms underlying rapid
evolution of plastic genome regions and to test these various hypotheses.

Conclusions
In this study, we predicted and annotated the secretome of
the Irish potato famine pathogen P. infestans using in silico
approaches. We quantitatively described P. infestans genome organization by delimiting gene dense and gene
sparse regions. We used genome organization as a novel
approach that augments previously established criteria to

mine for candidate virulence factors. Occurrence of
secreted protein genes in GSRs, in combination with comparative genomics and transcriptomics, implicated 19 previously overlooked genes in virulence. These include cell
wall degrading enzymes, trypsin-like serine protease, carbonic anhydrase, berberine bridge enzyme, several repeat
containing proteins, and small cysteine-rich proteins.

methods of Torto et al. (2003) [30] and Win et al. [19].
The 18,155 proteins predicted by Haas et al. (2009) [15]
from the P. infestans T30-4 genome assembly were submitted to SignalP v2.0 [94]. A SignalP HMM score cutoff of ≥ 0.9 was used (2,228 proteins recovered). This
set of 2228 proteins was submitted to SignalP3.0 [95],
RPSP [96], TargetP [97], WolfPSort [98] and TMHMM
[99] (Additional file 1). Proteins showing (i) SignalP2.0
HMM score ≥ 0.9 and (ii) SignalP3.0 NN Ymax Score ≥
0.5 and (iii) SignalP3.0 NN D-score ≥ 0.5 and (iv) SignalP3.0 HMM S probability ≥ 0.9 and (v) TargetP predicted localization “Secreted” (S) and (vi) most probable
PSort location “extracellular” (extr.) and no TMHMM
predicted transmembrane domain after signal peptide
cleavage site were considered as P. infestans secretome.
Enrichment analyses

Pfam [100] and Superfamily 1.73 [101] with default
parameters were used to complement the annotation of
the secreted proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) terms mapping was performed on P. infestans proteome using
Blast2GO [102] with default parameters and GO sorted
by domain (Additional file 1). The number of occurrences of each Pfam domain, Molecular function GO
and Biological process GO found in secretome was calculated among secretome proteins and the rest of the
proteome. Frequencies are given as the number of
occurrences over the total number of Pfam domain or
GO hits among secreted or non-secreted proteins.
Enrichment fold correspond to frequency in secretome
over frequency in the rest of the proteome. Depletion
fold (1 over enrichment fold) is given for domains/
ontologies depleted from secretome. Significance of
enrichment/depletion is assessed by a chi-square test
with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Only
Pfam domains with enrichment p-value ≤ 0.1 and at
least one hit with e-value ≤ 10e-05 and GO with enrichment p-value ≤ 0.1 are reported in figure 1.
Identification of genes belonging to orthologous
segments

Genes belonging to orthologous segments were identified in Haas et al. [15]. Briefly, regions of conserved

Raffaele et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:637
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/637

collinear gene order between P. infestans, P. sojae and P.
ramorum genomes were computed using DAGchainer
30 considering only the relative order of the genes along
each scaffold [103]. Only orthologs defined by
OrthoMCL 24 [104] were used as anchors for collinear
blocks. Collinear blocks were defined between each pair
of the three Phytophthora genomes. The orthologous
segments reported corresponds to the union of blocks
obtained from the pairwise comparisons to the other
genomes.
Sequences alignments

Similarity searches were performed using Blastall from
NCBI Blast package [105]. Sequences were aligned using
Clustal W2 program [106], rendered with Jalview [107]
and manually annotated. Protein domains in candidate
virulence genes were identified using Pfam [100]. Identity dotplots for Repeat containing proteins were drawn
using Dotlet with word size of 7 [108], motifs were
found using MEME [109].
Gene expression analysis

Whole genome expression data used in this work were
previously described by Haas et al. [15] and are based
on a custom NimbleGen oligonucleotide microarray. P.
infestans genes were classified as induced when they
showed at least a 2-fold induction during colonization
of potato at 2, 3, 4 or 5 days post inoculation (dpi), or
tomato at 2 or 5 dpi, compared to in vitro grown mycelia. In Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, gene expression is given
as log 2 (linear expression in sample/average linear
expression in control mycelia).
Protein 3D modeling and structure analysis

3D structure of PITG_02935, PITG_02930 and
PITG_06585 P. infestans BBEs were modeled based on
homology with the template protein structures of Acremonium strictum 1ZR6A [110] and Eschscholzia californica 3D2H [111]. The align2d function and 3D modeling
in modeler9v7 [112] were used for that purpose. 3D
structure of PITG_17842 and PITG_18284 a-CA were
predicted using similar methods by homology with
human 1FLJA [113] and 1JD0A [114]. Rendering of the
models was performed with Chimera [115]. To compare
protein structures, the models were superimposed by
matching C, N and O atoms from residues H94, H96,
H119 of 1JD0.A to H92, H94, H111 of PITG_18284
model; C130, D355, W383 of 1ZR6 to C146, D373, W401
of PITG_02930 model; C166, W328, I516 of 3D2D to
C146, W311, I487 of PITG_02930 model.
