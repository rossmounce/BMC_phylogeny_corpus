Abstract
Background: Persistent infections with mutualistic intracellular bacteria (endosymbionts) are well
represented in insects and are considered to be a driving force in evolution. However, while
pathogenic relationships have been well studied over the last decades very little is known about the
recognition of the endosymbionts by the host immune system and the mechanism that limits their
infection to the bacteria-bearing host tissue (the bacteriome).
Results: To study bacteriome immune specificity, we first identified immune-relevant genes of the
weevil Sitophilus zeamais by using suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and then analyzed
their full-length coding sequences obtained by RACE-PCR experiments. We then measured
immune gene expression in the bacteriome, and in the aposymbiotic larvae following S. zeamais
primary endosymbiont (SZPE) injection into the hemolymph, in order to consider the questions of
bacteriome immune specificity and the insect humoral response to symbionts. We show that larval
challenge with the endosymbiont results in a significant induction of antibacterial peptide genes,
providing evidence that, outside the bacteriome, SZPE are recognized as microbial intruders by the
host. In the bacteriome, gene expression analysis shows the overexpression of one antibacterial
peptide from the coleoptericin family and, intriguingly, homologs to genes described as immune
modulators (that is, PGRP-LB, Tollip) were also shown to be highly expressed in the bacteriome.
Conclusion: The current data provide the first description of immune gene expression in the
insect bacteriome. Compared with the insect humoral response to SZPE, the bacteriome
expresses few genes among those investigated in this work. This local immune gene expression may
help to maintain the endosymbiont in the bacteriome and prevent its invasion into insect tissues.
Further investigations of the coleoptericin, the PGRP and the Tollip genes should elucidate the role of
the host immune system in the maintenance and regulation of endosymbiosis.

Background
Chronic bacterial infections are widespread in nature and
exhibit a large range of interactions with their host, from
mutualism to parasitism. In insects, symbiotic intracellular bacteria (endosymbionts) are deeply integrated into
host cell biology and development as they are transmitted
maternally through hundreds of host generations, and
early on in the insect embryogenesis they invade specialized host cells called bacteriocytes that sometimes form a
specific organ, the bacteriome [1-3]. Physiological and
molecular investigations have provided evidence that
endosymbionts supply their host's diet with limiting
nutrients, thereby improving their invasive power and
their ability to settle on nutritionally poor sources and
habitats, such as blood (Glossina, Rhodnius), plant sap
(aphids, psyllids, whiteflies, mealybugs), and cereal grains
(Sitophilus) [2,4].
However, while the physiological and the evolutionary
aspects of insect endosymbiosis have been thoroughly
investigated over the past two decades, very little is known
about the molecular mechanisms that permit the establishment, then the maintenance and the regulation of
such beneficial interactions. One striking question concerns the interaction between the bacteria and the host
innate immune system, an area which has been relatively
well investigated in pathogenic relationships compared
with mutualistic associations that have been recently
approached in only a few systems [5-8].
To combat infection, insects rely on multiple innate
defense reactions. Insect immunity includes physical barriers, together with local and systemic immune responses
involving both cellular and humoral pathways (reviewed
in [9]). Activation of the humoral pathway consists of
microbe-associated molecular pattern recognition by pattern recognition receptors, such as peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), and the activation of intracellular
signaling pathways, such as the Toll and the Immune deficiency (Imd) pathways. These pathways activate, in particular, the production and the secretion of a panel of
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition to AMP production, the insect humoral response also involves a
proteolytic cascade leading to prophenoloxidase (PPO)
activation and subsequent melanin synthesis at the site of
cuticular injury. This reaction, called melanization, plays
a key role in wound healing, encapsulation, sequestration
of microbes and production of toxic intermediates [10].
While the systemic response is by far the best characterized pathway among immune reactions, the local
immune response (also known as epithelial immunity)
was only recently shown to significantly contribute to protection against invading microorganisms in the alimentary tract and tracheae. In the gut, for example, there is an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/43

inducible local production of AMPs. This response is triggered upon natural infection by Gram-negative bacteria
and is mediated by the Imd pathway [11]. The gut epithelium also expresses amidase PGRP. It has been shown that
these PGRPs, which scavenge peptidoglycan released by
commensal bacteria, reduce gut immune reactivity and
avoid a state of permanent immune activation in this tissue [12,13].
In a previous work on the mutualistic interaction between
the weevil Sitophilus zeamais and a γ-proteobacterium
called S. zeamais primary endosymbiont (SZPE) (see [14]
for a review on the model), we discovered the overexpression of a member of the PGRP gene family in the bacteriome tissue of the host [15,16]. We showed that wPGRP is
induced after a bacterial challenge and that wPGRP gene
expression depends on bacterial growth. Moreover, we
have shown that the wPGRP gene was induced concomitantly with an endosymbiont release from the bacteriocytes during nymphosis, demonstrating that the PGRP
gene family is involved in host-symbiont interaction [16].
This study was dedicated to enlarging the panel of insect
immune genes involved in the host-symbiont interaction.
We first identified the host immune-relevant genes by
suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH), and analyzed in silico their full-length coding sequences completed with RACE-PCR. We then measured their steadystate levels in aposymbiotic larvae challenged with SZPE
and in the bacteriocyte cells of naturally infected larvae.
We show that experimental infection of larvae with SZPE
results in a significant induction of AMPs and that only
few immune gene transcripts, including homologs to an
antibacterial peptide and immunomodulators, are accumulated in the bacteriome tissue. These data reveal that
endosymbionts are perceived as intruders while being
present in hemolymph and that there is a local immune
gene expression in the bacteriome. This study provides the
first indication of how insects may maintain endosymbionts within the bacteriome and prevent their invasion
into insect tissues.

Results
Identification of immune-relevant genes in Sitophilus
zeamais
As the Sitophilus genome has not been sequenced, we
applied SSH technology to cDNA from E. coli-infected larvae and cDNA from naive larvae to identify the immune
genes of interest to this work. To obtain genes expressed at
different phases of the immune response, three RNA samples were extracted 3, 6 and 12 hours after Escherichia coli
infection and mixed prior to cDNA synthesis. We
sequenced 485 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the
subtracted library. Following quality analysis, trimming
and chimeric sequence digestion (see Materials and Meth-

ods), we assembled 475 sequences into 273 putative transcripts, consisting of 62 contigs and 211 singletons (Table
1).
To gain insight into the function of EST products, we compared the 273 resulting sequences with the UniProt databases and classified them using the Gene Ontology (GO)
scheme. Moreover, we constructed a database where all
the ESTs and a complete list of BlastX matches, together
with their functional classification, can be found. Of these
273 sequences, 83% successfully matched against the
UniProt database and 63% were functionally classified
(Table 1). Concerning the immune genes, around 12% of
the ESTs have similarities with transcripts that are known
to encode proteins involved in an immune function.
According to sequence identity, some ESTs showed only a
weak similarity to antibacterial peptides, such as diptericin A, cecropin A1, sarcotoxin II-1 and luxuriosin. Nevertheless, taking into account their high redundancy (12,
4, 15, and 4 copies, respectively), we have included them
in this study. In addition, sequence analysis of ESTs with
similarities to diptericin, tenecin and luxuriocin has
uncovered various isoforms of these peptides (see Additional file 1). However, due to the high DNA and protein
sequence identities (76% to 97% and 91% to 100%,
respectively) we have analyzed only one isoform of each
gene family in this work.
Analysis of full-length cDNA of immune genes obtained by
RACE-PCR
To improve sequence similarities, we applied the RACEPCR technology and have sequenced the full cDNA
sequences of ESTs (one EST for each cluster) with similarities to antibacterial peptides, lysozymes, PGRPs and Tollip (Figure 1). We also analyzed the cDNA sequences in
silico to identify conserved protein domains and to predict
the cellular localization of the peptides and proteins.
Antimicrobial peptides
AMPs typically contain fewer than 100 amino acid residues, divided in most cases into three domains: a signal
peptide, a propeptide (R-x-(K/R)-R motifs), and the
mature peptide. The first two domains are proteolytically
cleaved to release the mature peptide active against bacteria [17-19].

A signal peptide and an R-x-(K/R)-R motif have been predicted for all the putative antibacterial peptides of S. zeamais, except for INF-163 and INF-479, for which only a
signal peptide is reliably predicted (Figure 1). According
to protein similarity, we confirmed the identification of
two AMPs (INF-18 and INF-145, 40% identity) belonging
to the coleoptericin family, a defensin with sequence
identity of 66% (32/48) to tenecin (INF-217), and a
homolog of luxuriosin, an AMP characterized by a Kunitz

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/43

domain [20], with a sequence identity of 42% (45/106).
For ESTs INF-42, INF-163 and INF-165, the full-length
transcripts still show weak similarities to AMPs and no
characteristic domain has been identified for the putative
peptides, which cannot be considered as antibacterial
peptides without further analysis (Figure 1).
Lysozymes
Lysozymes are widespread enzymes characterized by their
ability to cleave bacterial peptidoglycans. Among lysozymes, several types have been described according to
the genomic structure and phylogenetic data: the c
(chicken), g (goose), i (invertebrate), phage, bacteria and
plant types [21]. Here, according to sequence homology,
we have identified two lysozymes: an i-type (INF-152),
with a destabilase-related domain identified in an i-type
lysozyme from the leech [22], and a c-type lysozyme (INF282) with a characteristic lysozyme domain. Both proteins have a predicted signal peptide.
PGRP
Two PGRP transcripts were identified in the subtracted
library. One EST (INF-9) corresponds to the wPGRP gene
previously identified [15,16] while the EST INF-441 is an
additional weevil PGRP gene. These two genes will be referenced as wPGRP1 and wPGRP2, respectively. RACE-PCR
product analysis has shown that the two wPGRP proteins
have 30% identity and have both conserved the residues
necessary for amidase activity [23]. According to in silico
analysis, wPGRP1 may be an intracellular amidase while
wPGRP2 may be secreted in hemolymph.
Tollip (Toll interacting protein)
Among the ESTs of the subtracted library, we found a
sequence (INF-359) with homology to Tollip, a regulator
of the Toll-like receptors pathway described in mammals
[24-26]. Analysis of the RACE-PCR product has confirmed
homology to the mammal genes since the predicted protein of S. zeamais shares 46% identity (127/275) with the
Tollip protein from Mus musculus.
Gene expression analysis after sterile or septic injury of
weevil aposymbiotic larvae
To determine genes induced by wounding (pricking
effect) and genes specifically induced by bacterial challenge, using qRT-PCR we have compared the transcript
levels in aposymbiotic larvae after sterile and septic injury,
and in naive aposymbiotic larvae taken as a control (Table
2).

According to the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, most of the
genes with sequence similarity to AMPs are highly
induced (30 to 300-fold) after E. coli infection, including
genes without any significant antibacterial domain (Table
2 and Figure 1). Some peptide genes, such as INF-18, INF-

42 and INF-217, are also slightly induced (10-fold) after a
sterile injury. INF-479, the homolog of luxuriosin, is the
only peptide gene induced after sterile injury but not in
response to E. coli challenge. Finally, both lysozyme genes
(INF-152 and INF-282) are induced after sterile injury,
independently of the bacterial infection.
The qRT-PCR data show that both wPGRP genes are upregulated. However, while wPGRP1 (INF-9) is weakly
induced by injury (2.3-fold) and more strongly induced
after E. coli infection (6.7-fold), wPGRP2 (INF-441) is
induced by sterile injury only (7.8 to 11.6-fold).

As regulators we quantified the expression of genes with
similarity to proteases and protease inhibitors, in addition
to the Tollip gene. The Tollip gene (INF-359) and two genes
with similarity to proteinases (INF-459 and INF-515)
were shown to be constitutively expressed. All the other
genes were induced after sterile injury, except the cysteinerich venom-like proteinase homolog (INF-91) that was
induced after infection with E. coli. However, no data are
available concerning the function of this protein identified in the salivary gland of Aedes albopictus.

ESTs were analyzed as described in Materials and Methods and classified according to gene family or function. Transcripts were quantitated by qRTPCR in untreated aposymbiotic larvae (control), in larvae six hours after a mock-infection (sterile injury) or an E. coli infection (septic injury). The
fold-change of gene expression after sterile or septic injury is expressed relative to the transcript levels in untreated larvae. For each sample, the
transcript level is estimated from the mean of three independent measurements after normalization with the expression of the gapdh gene. The
transcript amounts of the genes corresponding to the EST INF-42 and INF-258 are too weak to be quantified in the control larvae and in all the
samples, respectively. Comparisons of transcript levels between the three samples were made using nonparametric tests. A significant increase in
transcript level after sterile or septic injury is indicated by an asterisk (p < 0.05). A significant difference between sterile and septic injury is indicated
by a second asterisk (p < 0.05). Acc. Num., accession number; ND, non-determined. a. Proteases can represent either signaling proteins or immune
effectors.

In addition to humoral immune response genes we quantified two cytoskeleton genes, as the participation of actin
cytoskeleton regulation proteins in innate immunity has
been established by functional genomic analysis of
phagocytosis [27]. However, no variation in the transcript
levels has been observed, either for the actin gene or for
the homolog of profilin, an actin polymerization regulator
(INF-13).
Gene expression analysis in aposymbiotic larvae
challenged with SZPE
To examine immune response to SZPE while present in
the larval hemolymph, we quantified gene transcript levels in aposymbiotic larvae following an injection of SZPE.
Knowing that SZPE fails to divide in vitro, we injected
approximately 1 × 105 viable or heat-killed SZPE (Figure
2), the amount of E. coli required to induce immune
response (data not shown).

No significant difference was shown between water and
symbiont injections for wPGRP1 (INF-9) whereas all the
genes with sequence similarity to AMPs were significantly
induced by the symbiont. Moreover, heat-killed E. coli was
shown to induce a weaker immune response than the
untreated E. coli (data not shown), possibly because bacterial growth and division in larvae may result in an
increase of bacterial density and then in a stronger
immune response [16]. Unlike E. coli, no difference was
found between larvae injected with viable or heat-killed
SZPE, which is consistent with an absence of symbiont
proliferation in the hemocoel.
Gene expression analysis in the larval bacteriome
As the bacteriome fails to develop in the absence of endosymbionts, the immune gene expression profile was
examined in the bacteriome and compared with the mean
transcript levels from whole aposymbiotic larval tissues.

As shown in Figure 3, most of the genes overexpressed in
larvae infected with E. coli (Table 2) or SZPE (Figure 2)
were slightly (or not at all) expressed in the bacteriome,
with the exception of two genes: the wPGRP1 gene (INF-9;
39-fold) and one of the two coleoptericin genes (INF-18;
10-fold). Interestingly, this experiment also revealed a
high expression level of the Tollip gene (INF-359; 5-fold)
in the bacteriome tissue. Moreover, cytoskeleton-encoding genes were shown to be significantly underexpressed
in the bacteriome. Actin transcripts were 800-fold less represented in the bacteriome when compared with whole
aposymbiotic larvae. Although many cases of host
cytoskeleton manipulation by bacteria have been
described [28,29], we cannot exclude the possibility that
the difference in the levels of actin transcription between
the bacteriome and the larvae is due to the high muscle
actin content in the larvae. Similarly, the abundance (or
absence) of certain gene products in major tissues (for
example lysozyme abundance in gut and salivary gland)
can create an apparent under (or over-) expression in the
bacteriome, and for such genes these results should be
considered with caution. However, it is noteworthy that
comparisons between the bacteriocyte and the whole
body expression profiles have provided previously meaningful results [15,30].

Discussion
There is compelling evidence that intracellular bacterial
infections can establish chronic non-septic relationships
with host cells for many generations. Some bacteria (for
example, Chlamydophila and Salmonella) invade and proliferate rapidly in their host, causing diseases, while others
(for example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) remain latent
and may reactivate months or years after initial exposure
to cause chronic disease [31]. In the insect world, some
intracellular bacteria can generate a long-term relationship within the host without causing any disease or invad-

Analysis of
Analysis of immune gene expression in aposymbiotic larvae challenged with Sitophilus zeamais primary endosymbiont. Transcript of genes induced by an E. coli challenge were quantitated by qRT-PCR in untreated aposymbiotic larvae
(control) and in larvae six hours after a 69 μl injection of either sterile water (sterile) or SZPE cells (heat-killed or viable)
obtained from 50 bacteriomes dissected from symbiotic fourth-instar larvae. ESTs were classified according to sequence similarity as in Table 2. Each bar represents the mean of three independent measurements with standard error.

ing any host tissues except the germ cells and the
bacteriocytes. The overexpression of the wPGRP1 gene in
the weevil bacteriome suggests a close interaction between
the host immune system and the endosymbionts.
To determine how the insect immune system recognizes
the bacteria and prevents bacterial invasion of insect tissues, we first identified, by SSH technology, the immune
genes induced in insects challenged with E. coli. Bioinformatic analysis scored a relatively high proportion of ESTs
with similarities to immune-related genes, including several antibacterial peptides, lysozymes, PGRPs and proteins
of the PPO pathway (Table 2), which highlights the efficiency of the subtractive approach. Further in silico analysis on full-length coding sequences has confirmed the
identification of an i-type and a c-type lysozyme gene

(INF-152, INF-282) and at least four antibacterial peptide
genes: two members of the coleoptericin family (INF-18,
INF-145), a defensin (INF-217) and a homolog of luxuriosin (INF-479), an antimicrobial peptide from Acalolepta
luxuriosa [20]. We also validated a homolog of Tollip, a
gene so far only studied in mammals that seems to be
absent from the Drosophila genome, and a PGRP gene
(wPGRP2, INF-441) additional to the one previously
described (wPGRP1 gene, INF-9). The expression profile
of all the putative immune genes was then characterized
by larvae challenge experiments combined with RT-PCR
transcript quantification (Table 2). Thus we have demonstrated that all the genes studied were inducible, except for
homologs of Tollip (INF-359) and hemolymph proteinase 17
(INF-459), which appear to be constitutive.

Analysis 3 gene expression in the bacteriome tissue
Analysis of gene expression in the bacteriome tissue. As described in Materials and Methods, transcripts of candidate
genes were quantitated by qRT-PCR in whole aposymbiotic fourth-instar larvae (control) and in bacteriomes dissected from
symbiotic fourth-instar larvae. ESTs were classified according to sequence similarity as in Table 2. Each bar represents the
mean of three independent measurements with standard error. The asterisk represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference
between the bacteriome and the control, and a significantly high expression in a bacteriome is indicated by an arrow. ND, nondetermined.

To elucidate the particular bacteriome immune features,
we first examined the systemic host response following
aposymbiotic larvae injection with SZPE (Figure 2) and
we then measured immune gene expression in the bacteriome of naturally infected larvae (Figure 3). Experimental
infection of the larvae led to a systemic immune response
with the up-regulation of all the genes with similarities to
AMPs, providing evidence that SZPE is recognized as a
microbial intruder while present in the hemolymph. It is
noteworthy that in contrast to SZPE, Spiroplasma does not
induce host transcripts encoding AMPs in Drosophila while
present in hemolymph. However, the lack of bacterial cell
wall structure of Spiroplasma is probably the best explanation for the apparent absence of host humoral response to
this bacterium [32].
In the weevil symbiotic larvae, in addition to the wPGRP1
gene, one antibacterial peptide induced by bacterial challenge (that is, the coleoptericin gene) is overexpressed in
the bacteriome. These data confirm the existence of an
immune response in the bacteriome tissue and provide
the first elements to explain how host-endosymbiont
association can persist with regard to the host immune
system and bacterial proliferation.

Since all AMP genes are up-regulated following a hemolymph challenge with SZPE, the unique overexpression of
the coleoptericin gene in the bacteriome suggests a constitutive expression in this tissue rather than an induction by
SZPE, unless coleoptericin gene regulation involves a separate pathway from those that trigger synthesis of other
AMPs. We can only speculate about this question, as comparison between symbiont-full and symbiont-free bacteriocytes cannot be conducted since no symbiont-free
bacteriome has been detected in Sitophilus aposymbiotic
insects so far. Taking into consideration that some AMPs
are expressed constitutively in cells potentially in contact
with the environment [11,33,34], and that the coleoptericin gene encodes a signal peptide, these data suggest
that the coleoptericin gene is expressed constitutively and
secreted outside the bacteriocyte. Coleoptericin is currently under investigation to determine whether this peptide may prevent host tissue invasion by the
endosymbiont, and/or may protect the endosymbiont
population against infection with environmental bacteria,
as the bacteriome tissue is intimately attached to the insect
foregut. Moreover, another interesting issue would be to
investigate whether coleptericin expression in the bacteriome can protect the host from pathogens. This would rep-

BMC Biology 2008, 6:43

resent an additional example of 'symbiont-mediated
protection' [35].
Although the absence of a host humoral immune
response to an intracellular symbiont and a constitutive
expression of coleoptericin in the bacteriome are consistent
with current knowledge of the insect immune response,
the overexpression of gene homologs to PGRP-LB (that is,
wPGRP1) and Tollip is quite intriguing. PGRP-LB gene
inhibition in Drosophila was indeed shown to result in a
significant induction of antibacterial peptides [13], while
Tollip has been implicated as a negative regulator of the
mammalian immune response [24,25]. Moreover, these
two genes are overexpressed in the gut epithelia and have
been proposed to play a role in the control of immune
reactivity of the host to the presence of bacteria in the gut.
Therefore, the overexpression of these two genes in the
bacteriome may be consistent with an immune modulation that inhibits the production of AMPs in this organ, as
it was described in the gut epithelia. Together with the
overexpression of an AMP (that is, coleoptericin), these
results uncover striking similarities between the bacteriome immune profile and the local immune response in
gut epithelium that is in permanent contact with commensal and mutualistic bacteria [9,11,13,33,36,37]. A
gene silencing study in weevil is currently under development to validate coleoptericin, wPGRP1 and Tollip gene
function and their contribution to the maintenance of
symbiosis.
It is noteworthy that this work was performed on a
recently established symbiosis where, contrary to ancient
symbiotic associations known for a drastically reduced
endosymbiont genome size such as in the aphid/Buchnera
association [38], SZPE exhibits similar features to those of
free-living Gram-negative bacteria [39-43]. Hence,
whether and how the host immune response evolves in
parallel to symbiont genome reduction constitutes a key
aspect in the understanding of host-symbiont interaction
in the course of evolution. Recently, a transcriptomic
study was performed on the aphid bacteriocyte to identify
a gene of interest in intracellular symbiosis [30]. Intriguingly, no homolog to any known immune genes was
shown to be expressed in the aphid bacteriocyte except for
i-type lysozymes, whose function in bacteriocytes remains
unknown. Since both the weevil i-type and c-type lysozymes were shown to be weakly expressed in the bacteriocytes, these data suggest that the bacteriocyte immune
profile may have evolved with bacterial coevolution with
the host, unless the immune response of weevils (holometabolous insects) has diverged significantly from that of
aphids (heterometabolous insects).
Whatever the antimicrobial effectors (that is, antibacterial
peptides, lysozyme), their permanent expression in bacte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/43

riocytes could represent a common mechanism to restrict
the localization of mutualistic symbionts, which is probably necessary to optimize the host-symbiont interaction.
Without this confinement, intracellular symbiotic bacteria may invade the whole organism without inducing any
antibacterial peptide synthesis, as has been shown in Drosophila infected by Wolbachia, a parasitic symbiont widely
distributed in host tissues [44].

Conclusion
This work provides the first immune gene expression profile in the insect bacteriome and reveals the overexpression of at least three homologs to immune genes: a
member of the PGRP gene family involved in bacteria recognition, an antibacterial peptide involved in bacterial
clearance and a gene involved in immunomodulation in
mammals. This immune profile uncovers some striking
similarities between the bacteriome and the gut epithelium, which is in constant contact with environmental
bacteria. Taking into account that the endosymbiont is
recognized as an intruder in the host hemolymph, these
findings also indicate that the host immune system may
prevent endosymbiont invasion into insect tissues in a
manner similar to the gut local immune response that
helps to confine the microbiota to the gut, avoiding a permanent systemic response to the commensal bacteria.

Methods
Insect rearing
Insects from a SZPE-monosymbiotic strain (S. zeamais
Lagoa) and from the corresponding aposymbiotic strain
were reared and collected as described in Anselme et al.
[16].
Bacterial challenge
Fourth-instar aposymbiotic larvae were challenged by
pricking with sterile sharpened needles (mock infection)
or with needles previously dipped into a pellet from E. coli
(TOP10, Invitrogen) overnight cultures, and kept in a
moist atmosphere at 27.5°C for 3, 6, and 12 hours. Living
larvae were stored at -80°C for RNA preparation. Unchallenged larvae (naive larvae) were treated in parallel as controls.

For the study of the host immune response to SZPE, larvae
were injected with 69 nl of either sterile water or bacterial
solution containing approximately 1 × 105 viable or heatkilled (5 min at 95°C) bacterial cells. SZPE solution was
freshly prepared from bacteriomes of fourth-instar larvae.
Fifty bacteriomes were dissected in buffer A (25 mM KCl,
10 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, 35 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5), transferred in a Dounce Teflon Homogenizer and
gently crushed in buffer A. After removal of cellular debris
by low-speed centrifugation (400 g, 10 min), bacteria
were pelleted (10000 g, 5 min) and resuspended to a con-

BMC Biology 2008, 6:43

centration of approximately 1.45 × 106 bacteria/μl in
buffer A.
Total RNA isolation
Total RNA from infected and naive larvae was extracted
using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen), treated with RNaseFree DNase (Promega) and purified through RNeasy mini
kit columns (Qiagen) as described in the manufacturer's
procedures. After purification, the RNA concentration of
each sample was measured by the Nanodrop® spectrophotometer and total RNA quality was checked by electrophoresis.
Suppression subtractive hybridization
We applied SSH technology by using a PCR-selected
cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech laboratories). For the synthesis of cDNA from E. coli-infected larvae used as a tester,
three RNA samples were extracted 3, 6 and 12 hours after
infection and mixed prior to cDNA synthesis.

Briefly, cDNA synthesis was carried out on a 1 μg aliquot
from a mix of 1 μg of each infected RNA sample for the
tester and from naive larvae RNA for the driver (SMART
PCR cDNA synthesis kit, Clontech laboratories). After
phenol-chloroform purification, the infected larval cDNA
was digested with RsaI, ligated to two adaptors separately
(1 and 2R), then hybridized to RsaI-digested naive larvae
cDNA. After hybridization, the subtracted cDNAs were
amplified by PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, cDNA subtraction kit). The amplified
products were directly cloned into a pCR 2.1-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen).
Clone sequencing, Blast homology searching and GO
assignment
After transformation by electroporation, around 500 colonies were recovered from Luria Broth agar plates. They
were subjected to plasmid extraction (NucleoSpin® Plasmid Kit, Macherey-Nagel) and sequenced in the Institut
Cavanilles de Biodiversitat i Biologia Evolutiva (València,
Spain). The 485 available sequences were trimmed using
SeqClean http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/
to remove flanking vector sequences, adaptors (match
with at least 98% identity over at least 11 base pairs) and
poly(A/T) tails, and remaining sequences shorter than 60
base pairs were discarded. Because subtracted library construction includes a step of RsaI digestion and adaptor
ligation where chimeric cDNA could be formed by cDNA
ligation, we checked for RsaI sites in the ESTs and discarded the chimeras from our dataset.

Remaining sequences were clustered using the TGICL
assembly program [45] and consensus sequences were
conserved for the subtracted library. All sequences (consensus and singletons) were then compared against Uni-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/43

Prot using BlastX. For GO assignment, we retained the first
hit with at least one GO annotation among the top five
hits. GO annotation results were then classified using
WEGO [46].
Sequencing of immune-relevant full-length cDNA
The complete sequences of the transcripts of interest were
obtained by 3' and 5' RACE, performed with the SMART
RACE cDNA Amplification Kit including the Advantage II
PCR kit (Clontech Laboratories). For each gene, the nucleotide sequences of the 3' and/or 5' primers (GSP1 and
GSP2) were designed on the corresponding EST (see Additional file 2). The first-strand cDNA used for 5' and
3'RACE were produced by using 1 μg of the infected RNA
mix prepared for the SSH method, and using the primers
provided in the kit. Amplification of the RACE products
was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR fragments were gel-purified with the Nucleotrap Gel Extraction Kit (Clontech Laboratories) and
inserted into the plasmid vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The sequences were generated by Genome Express
Company (Grenoble, France) with the M13 and the
M13rev vector primers.

The full-length sequence of the transcript was predicted
using the MacMolly software package according to the
RACE PCR product and according to the presence of both
in-frame stop codons upstream of the prospective methionine start site and of a poly(A) tail following the prospective stop codon. The predicted sequence was then
confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing. The
putative proteins were compared with protein sequences
in Swiss-Prot-Trembl to confirm the first homology, and
analyzed using the InterProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
InterProScan that combines different protein signature
recognition methods.
Real-Time RT-PCR transcript quantification
Real-time RT-PCR transcript quantification was performed with a LightCycler® instrument using the LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche
Diagnostics), as described in Anselme et al. [16]. RNA
extractions on three independent biological samples were
carried out for each condition (naive larvae, mockinfected larvae and infected larvae) 6 hours after treatment and on samples of 100 bacteriomes dissected from
naive symbiotic larvae. After sample purification, reverse
transcription into the first strand cDNA was made with
the First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers. PCR primers were designed
on ESTs or cDNA sequences, when necessary, to amplify
fragments of less than 300 bp (see Additional file 2).

The PCR reactions were carried out in LightCycler capillaries in a final volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of cDNA

Page 11 of 13

BMC Biology 2008, 6:43

samples (diluted 5-fold), 3.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μM of each
primer and 2 μl of LC-Fast Start Reaction Master SYBR
Green I. After 8 min at 95°C, the cycling conditions were
as follows: 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, primer annealing
temperature for 20 s and then 72°C for 30 s. For product
identification, a melting curve was constructed at the end
of each PCR by heating for 5 s at 95°C and for 15 s at a
temperature corresponding to 10°C more than the primer
annealing temperature, and then increasing the temperature up to 95°C with increment rates of 0.1°C/s. Reactions were stopped by cooling at 4°C.
For the individual samples, the crossing point (Cp) and,
according to the standard curve, the concentrations of the
transcripts were determined. The melting curves of each
sample were analyzed and the concentrations of samples
presenting primer-dimer formation were considered as
'non-determined' (ND). Data were normalized using the
ratio of the target cDNA concentration to that of the house
keeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(gapdh). The expression of this gene is not significantly
influenced by the treatments and it is similar to the
expression of the ribosomal protein L29 gene (data not
shown). Normalized data were analyzed using nonparametric tests.

castaneum potentially involved in immune defense, signaling, and other immunity-linked cellular processes
including homologs of, for example, Toll, PGRP-SC, lysozyme, and multiple isoforms of defensins and thaumatin-like peptides. They have also performed a qRT-PCR to
determine transcriptional regulation of selected genes
(that is, defensin, thaumatin and stress-related genes) in
response to either septic versus sterile injury or heat shock.
While this study explored the Tribolium immune response
considering all cellular processes, we focused our study on
Sitophilus immune pathways and effectors. It should be
noted that, in contrast to this study, we have identified
members of different antibacterial peptide families (for
example, coleoptericin, defensin). We also identified
some homologs of thaumatin-like peptides (for example,
INF-475, INF-332, INF-CL57Contig1), but were unable to
quantify them without specific amplification.
