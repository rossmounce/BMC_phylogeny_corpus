Abstract
Background: The insecticides dichlorvos, paradichlorobenzene and naphthalene have been commonly used to
eradicate pest insects from natural history collections. However, it is not known how these chemicals affect the
DNA of the specimens in the collections. We thus tested the effect of dichlorvos, paradichlorobenzene and
naphthalene on DNA of insects (Musca domestica) by extracting and amplifying DNA from specimens exposed to
insecticides in two different concentrations over increasing time intervals.
Results: The results clearly show that dichlorvos impedes both extraction and amplification of mitochondrial and
nuclear DNA after relatively short time, whereas paradichlorobenzene and naphthalene do not.
Conclusion: Collections treated with paradichlorobenzene and naphthalene, are better preserved concerning DNA,
than those treated with dichlorvos. Non toxic pest control methods should, however, be preferred due to physical
damage of specimens and putative health risks by chemicals.

Background
Natural history collections are an invaluable source of
biological data [1-3]. These collections record the distribution of known taxa in space and time and document
both what we know and what we don’t know about the
world’s biota [4]. Biologists all over the world have been
extracting ecological, morphological, phylogenetic, diversity and biogeographic data from museum specimens for
decades, if not decennia [1]. More recently these specimens are also in frequent use for the extraction of DNA
in e.g. molecular phylogenetic, population genetic and
conservation genetic studies [5-9]. It could also be
expected that Natural history collections will be much
more important in molecular studies in the near future
owing to; 1) difficulties to collect fresh biological material from many regions and the extinction of taxa due to
habitat loss, and 2) the development of new highthroughput sequencing methods [10] and protocols that
makes it possible to use these techniques for PCR-product sequencing [11] and conducting extensive

molecular studies based on fragmented DNA in
museum collections.
Museum collections are prone to attacks by insect
pests, especially beetles of the family Dermestidae
(Coleoptera). If left unattended these pests can completely destroy an insect collection within a few months
time. Hence a variety of methods have been developed
to eradicate the pest insects e.g. fumigation or other
treatments with insecticides [12,13], traps [14-16], heating [17-19] or freezing of infested specimens [20-22]
and modified atmosphere [23-28].
Many different insecticides have been used in eradication of pest insects in collections. The use is declining,
but it is still utilized in many museums [29,30]. Several
studies of the effects of insecticides on the pest insects
e.g. [12,31] and their effect on different materials in
museum collections [32,33] have been performed, but
there are few studies of how insecticides affect the DNA
of the specimens in natural history collections. Whitten
et al [34] found no effect of sulphuryl fluoride (Vikane)
on the DNA of herbarium specimens. According to
Kigawa et al. [35] methyl bromide, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and methyl iodide all affected the DNA in
both freeze-dried mushrooms and chicken muscle

negatively, whereas sulphuryl fluoride did not. To our
knowledge no studies on the effects of insect DNA have
been performed.
Naphthalene, paradichlorobenzene and dichlorvos are
some of the most frequently used insecticides in insect
collections, but their effect on the DNA of insect specimens is not known. We therefore exposed dried insects
to various concentrations of these insecticides over a
period of 20 months (605 days), extracted DNA from
the specimens and ran both total DNA extracts and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products on agarose
gels to investigate effects of these insecticides on the
DNA of insect specimens.

Methods
Common houseflies (Musca domestica) were dried on
silica gel for three weeks and then exposed to one of
eight different treatments (Table 1). Insecticides were
placed in 15 cm 3 glass vials under a piece of cotton.
Flies were placed on the cotton to avoid direct exposure
to the insecticide. Vials where then sealed with plastic
lids with silicone insulation to make them air tight and
stored at room temperature. Recommended dosage and
10× recommended dosage of insecticides were calculated based on information on the insecticide containers. Recommended dosage for naphthalene and
paradichlorobenzene were 150 g/m3 air and 1.6 g/m3
for dichlorvos. We used 15 cm3 vials in the experiments
so these amounts transferred to 0.002 g/vial for
naphthalene and paradichlorbenzene and 2.4*10-4g/vial
for dichlorvos. We did not have accurate enough equipment to measure as small amounts as the latter thus we
used 0.001 g/vial which corresponds to roughly 41× the
recommended dosage of dichlorvos. This might seem
like a very high quantity, but it is justified since much
higher doses of dichlorvos are used in real collections.
A standard insect drawer in use at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History has a volume of 6800 cm3
(6.8 l). This means that recommended dosage of one
drawer should be 1 g for naphthalene and dichlorvos
and as little as 0.01 g for dichlorvos. Considerably
higher doses have been used in drawers at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History (Figure 1). The potency of
dichlorvos makes it virtually impossible to dose it
correctly.
In addition to recommended dosage we also included a
treatment with 10× (833× for dichlorvos) recommended

Swedish Museum of Natural History.

dosage (0.02 g/vial) and controls without insecticides.
Samples were taken with increasing intervals over a time
period of 20 months (605 days) and DNA extracted
according to the scheme in Table 2.
Molecular procedures

DNA was extracted from whole houseflies using the
Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, California) which yields DNA fragments of
length 50 000 kb and shorter. Twelve μl of the aliquots
were run directly on 1% agarose gels in 0.5× TBE buffer
for 5 hours and visualized under UV light.
Fragments of comparable length of one mitochondrial
(COI, 658 bp; primers LCO-HCO [36]) and one nuclear
gene (EF1a, 716 bp; primers M46.1-R [37,38]) were
amplified using Ready-To-Go™ PCR Beads (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, New Jersey). Reaction
mixtures consisting of 2 μl template, 1 μl primer (10
μm, forward and reverse) 16 μl dH 2 0 and beads were
heated to 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of
30 seconds at 95°C, 30 seconds at a specific annealing
temperature (52°C for EF1a and to 50°C for COI) and
50 seconds at 72°C, and then a final extension of 8 minutes at 72°. PCR products were visualized by ultraviolet
light on a 0.8% agarose gel after electrophoresis.

Visualization of DNA extracts on agarose gels showed
that dichlorvos fragments DNA both in high and low
concentration (Figure 2A-B). After four and twelve
months of exposure of the high and recommended
dosage dichlorvos respectively, the band of DNA of
length around 23 000 bp, which constitutes of most of
the DNA in the control, has completely disappeared from
the dichlorvos samples. Only a very low amount of highly
degraded DNA (<500 bp) is present in these samples. No
effect on DNA was seen in samples treated with naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene (Figure 3A, B, only high
concentration, 0.02 g/vial, shown; control: Figure 3C).

After 134 days (sample 12, Figure 4A-I) of dichlorvos
exposure (high concentration) amplification of EF1a is
considerably impeded and after 229 days (sample 14,
Figure 4A-I) it is no longer possible. Amplification of
COI is impeded after 229 days (sample 14, Figure 5A-I)
of dichlorvos exposure (high concentration). Very weak
bands are, however, visible during the whole experiment
(605 days) so amplification is possible, but made more
difficult. When looking at the samples exposed to lower
concentration of dichlorvos the results are less conclusive but amplification of both EF1a (Figure 4C-I) and
COI (Figure 5C-I) is impeded by dichlorvos even here,
indicated by weaker bands, especially for EF1a, for samples treated with dichlorvos than for the controls (Figures 4B-II, 4D-II). When compared with the controls

Samples shown on gels in this paper are given in bold.

If fragmentation is seen in both extraction and amplification then there is evidence that these insecticides
cause degradation of DNA. If, on the other hand, initial
gel runs on extracts exposed to insecticides are identical
to controls, but amplification of genes are impossible or
very difficult we have evidence that insecticides might
inhibit amplification.

Discussion
The use of DNA from organisms in museum collection
is increasing and it is thus important to curate the collections with this in mind. Dichlorvos clearly affects the

DNA of insects negatively already after four months of
exposure and the effect increases over time, whereas
naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene do not seem to
affect DNA, at least not over a time period of 20
months. Negative effects on DNA are observed both in
total DNA extractions and amplification of nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA, thus the major problem is

Espeland et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:2

fragmentation of DNA and not inhibition of PCR primers. Effects are also larger for the nuclear gene than
for the mitochondrial gene, which is not unlikely since
the mitochondrial gene is present as multiple copies in
every cell, whereas nuclear DNA only in two copies.
Mitochondria are also structurally strong which might
lead to better preservation of mitochondrial DNA than
its nuclear counterpart [39]. The concentration of insecticide used is also important with higher concentration
resulting in increased damage of DNA. The dosages of
dichlorvos used in this study might seem extremely
high, but they (even the high dose) are probably closer
to reality than the recommended dose. The pesticide is
very potent even in small doses, and it is almost impossible not to use more than necessary. It is also possible
that we will see similar results of DNA fragmentation
for paradichlorobenzene and naphthalene when used in
higher doses. Dichlorvos is a potent acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor and can cause DNA damage in human cells at
low concentrations, even after short exposure [40,41],
and it is putatively carcinogenic in humans [42]. It has
also been shown to cause severe damage on museum
material, such as bleaching of colour, and even corrosion of metal [32,33]. Because of its deleterious effects
to both human and insect DNA the use of dichlorvos
for pest prevention in natural history collections should
be strongly avoided. Even naphthalene and paradichlorbenzene, are suspected carcinogens [43,44]. They also
effect colours and soften resins [45], and are documented less effective in killing the pests than dichlorvos
[31]. Therefore they are not recommended for use in
museums. Non-toxic methods such as freezing [21,22],
or anoxic treatment [27] should be recommended if
infestation has occurred since they are effective against
pests and at the same time little hazardous to humans
and items. On the other hand we wholeheartedly agree
with Blyth & Smith [46], that prevention is better than
the cure.

Conclusion
The use of dichlorvos for pest eradication in natural history collections should be strongly avoided due to deleterious effects on DNA. Chemical eradication methods
in general should be avoided since they can cause
damage to specimens and are associated with putative
health issues.
