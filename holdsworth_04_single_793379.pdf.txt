Abstract
Background: Sphingosine-1-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are ligands for two
related families of G protein-coupled receptors, the S1P and LPA receptors, respectively. The
lysophospholipid ligands of these receptors are structurally similar, however recognition of these
lipids by these receptors is highly selective. A single residue present within the third
transmembrane domain (TM) of S1P receptors is thought to determine ligand selectivity;
replacement of the naturally occurring glutamic acid with glutamine (present at this position in the
LPA receptors) has previously been shown to be sufficient to change the specificity of S1P1 from
S1P to 18:1 LPA.
Results: We tested whether mutation of this "ligand selectivity" residue to glutamine could confer
LPA-responsiveness to the related S1P receptor, S1P4. This mutation severely affected the
response of S1P4 to S1P in a [35S]GTPγS binding assay, and imparted sensitivity to LPA species in
the order 14:0 LPA > 16:0 LPA > 18:1 LPA. These results indicate a length restriction for activation
of this receptor and demonstrate the utility of using LPA-responsive S1P receptor mutants to
probe binding pocket length using readily available LPA species. Computational modelling of the
interactions between these ligands and both wild type and mutant S1P4 receptors showed excellent
agreement with experimental data, therefore confirming the fundamental role of this residue in
ligand recognition by S1P receptors.
Conclusions: Glutamic acid in the third transmembrane domain of the S1P receptors is a general
selectivity switch regulating response to S1P over the closely related phospholipids, LPA. Mutation
of this residue to glutamine confers LPA responsiveness with preference for short-chain species.
The preference for short-chain LPA species indicates a length restriction different from the closely
related S1P1 receptor.

Background
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA) are phospholipid growth factors which are
present in normal serum and plasma. These lipids elicit
diverse responses from a wide range of cell types, including enhanced cell survival, cell proliferation, induction of
cytoskeletal changes and chemotaxis (reviewed in [1-4].
Some of these responses reflect activation of G proteincoupled receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene
(Edg) family. The Edg receptor family is classified into two
clusters based on ligand selectivity: S1P1/2/3/4/5 (formerly
Edg1/5/3/6/8) specifically respond to S1P whilst LPA1/2/3
(formerly Edg2/4/7) respond to LPA [5]. Members of the
S1P receptor family display higher sequence similarity to
each other (approximately 40% identity) than to members of the LPA receptor family (approximately 30% identity). These homologies, coupled with observed
differences in the structure of S1P and LPA receptor genes,
suggest that these receptor families evolved from distinct
ancestral genes. The S1P receptors contain a conserved
glutamic acid residue present within the third TM that corresponds to glutamine in the LPA receptors. Interaction
between distinct functional groups present on S1P and
LPA with this residue was shown for the S1P1 and LPA1
receptors using computational modelling techniques
[6,7] and was demonstrated as the basis for the ligand
preference displayed by the receptors. Experimental characterisation confirmed that replacement of glutamic acid
with glutamine in S1P1 changed ligand specificity from
S1P to LPA, and the reciprocal mutation in LPA1 resulted
in recognition of both LPA and S1P [7].
In the present study, the role of this residue in determining ligand selectivity for the S1P4 receptor was examined.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Edg family of receptors indicates that S1P4 is more closely related to other S1P receptors than receptors which respond to LPA. However, S1P4
lies on the edge of the S1P family cluster and has been
shown to bind S1P with lower affinity than other S1P
receptors and hence it has been suggested that S1P is not
the true endogenous agonist of this receptor [8]. We therefore decided to investigate whether replacement of this
residue (E3.29(122)) with glutamine conferred LPA-responsiveness to the S1P4 receptor and hence determine the role
of this residue in this lower-affinity S1P receptor. To
achieve this, we expressed wild type and E3.29(122)Q
mutant S1P4 receptors in CHO-K1 cells and studied
responses to lysophospholipids using a [35S]GTPγS binding assay. Since CHO-K1 cells respond to LPA, we utilised
fusion proteins constructed between the S1P4 receptor
and a pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi1(C351I) G protein.
Expression of these proteins in CHO-K1 cells followed by
treatment with pertussis toxin prior to harvest allowed
elimination of any signal due to stimulation of endogenous LPA receptors. Within this study, we also examined

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/5/12

how the length of the LPA acyl chain affected potency at
the mutant S1P4 receptor, using a panel of naturally occurring LPA analogues. Computational models of complexes
between the wild type or mutant S1P4 receptor and S1P
and LPA species were used to provide a molecular interpretation of the experimental findings.

Results
Human HA-S1P4 was mutated at position 122 to replace
the naturally occurring glutamic acid with glutamine. The
mutant and wild type receptors were stably expressed in
CHO-K1 cells as in-frame GPCR-G protein fusions with
pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi1(C351I). Western blotting
was used to detect expression of these fusion proteins.
Membranes from HA-S1P4-Gαi1(C351I)- or HAS1P4(E3.29(122)Q)-Gαi1(C351I)-transfected cells contained
a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of
approximately 110 kDa, which reacted with anti-HA and
anti-SG1 antibodies (Figure 1A and 1B) and was consistent with expression of the GPCR-G protein fusion. Confirmation of comparable cell-surface expression of these
proteins was obtained via FACS analysis using an anti-HA
antibody directly conjugated with fluorescein (Figure 1
Panel III).
The response of HA-S1P4-Gαi1(C351I) and HAS1P4(E3.29(122)Q)-Gαi1(C351I) to S1P was assessed using
membranes from cells transfected to express these proteins and treated with pertussis toxin prior to harvest. S1P
promoted dose-dependent increase in [35S]GTPγS binding
to membranes containing HA-S1P4-Gαi1(C351I) with an
EC50 of 355 nM ± 155 nM (n = 3); in contrast, membranes
from HA-S1P4(E3.29(122)Q)-Gαi1(C351I)-expressing cells
demonstrated severely impaired response to S1P (Figure
2A). The EC50 for S1P stimulation of the HA-S1P4-Gαi1
fusion protein (355 ± 155 nM) was not statistically significantly different from that obtained using the unfused
HA-S1P4 receptor (439 ± 187 nM, Figure 2B) and compared favourably with published values for this receptor
in HEK293T cells from two different research groups of
270 nM [9] and 790 nM [10].
Structure activity relationships were determined by the
[35S]GTPγS assay for S1P4 or its E3.29(122)Q mutant using
S1P and LPA species with 14:0, 16:0 and 18:1 acyl chains
at a single (10 µM) concentration. Of the lysophospholipids tested, only S1P induced a strong response over basal
levels (approximately 48% ± 5%) in membranes containing HA-S1P4-Gαi1 (Figure 3A), whilst 18:1 LPA did not
stimulate a statistically significant response; weak stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding was observed with 14:0 and
16:0 LPA (approximately 11% ± 3% above basal in each
case). In contrast, membranes containing HAS1P4(E3.29(122)Q)-Gαi1(C351I) showed at least weak
response to each ligand (Figure 3A). The weakest agonist

Expression
Figure 1 of HA-S1P4-Gαi1 and HA-S1P4(E122Q)-Gαi1(C351I) in CHO-K1 cells
Expression of HA-S1P4-Gαi1 and HA-S1P4(E122Q)-Gαi1(C351I) in CHO-K1 cells. Membranes from untransfected
CHO-K1 cells (lane 2) and CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-S1P4-Gαi1(C351I) (A) or HA-S1P4(E122Q)-Gαi1(C351I) (B) were
analysed by Western blotting using anti-HA (panel I) or anti-Gαi1 (panel II) antibodies. Visualisation of immunoreactive proteins
was achieved using chemiluminescence after incubation of the blot with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.
The position of each HA-S1P4 fusion protein is indicated by an arrow. Cell-surface expressed HA-S1P4 receptor was detected
by FACS analysis (panel III) using a Fluorescein conjugate of the anti-HA antibody (blue line). Cells were also stained with an
isotype matched control antibody (red line). No staining of untransfected CHO-K1 cells was observed using the Fluorescein
conjugate of the anti-HA antibody (not shown). Data are presented as overlay histograms and are representative of at least five
independent experiments.

at the E3.29(122)Q mutant S1P4 receptor was 18:1 LPA,
which produced only 14% ± 2% stimulation over basal.
S1P and 16:0 LPA gave approximately 21% ± 4% and 19%
± 4% stimulation over basal response, respectively. The
best agonist for the E3.29(122)Q mutant was 14:0 LPA,
which gave a 40% ± 2% enhancement over basal levels.
The stimulation promoted by 14:0 LPA was statistically
different from that produced by 18:1 LPA (p < 0.01). Sensitivity of the receptor to stimulation by each form of LPA,
and particularly 14:0 LPA, was markedly increased after
introduction of the E3.29(122)Q mutation and indicated
that this position was important in influencing HA-S1P4
ligand preference.

These results indicate that introduction of the E3.29(122)Q
mutation in the S1P4 receptor confers LPA-responsiveness, and that a short form of LPA was a more effective
agonist than the intermediate and longer forms, when
tested at this single concentration. Dose response curves
were constructed for ligand-induced activation of the
E3.29(122)Q S1P4 mutant by the 14:0 and 18:1 forms of LPA
as well as S1P (Figure 3B). An EC50 could only be determined for the 14:0 form of LPA as S1P and 18:1 LPA
caused minimal stimulation at only the highest concentration tested. The EC50 value for activation of HAS1P4(E3.29(122)Q)-Gαi1(C351I) was calculated to be 3.8 ±
1.4 µM. However, since a plateau of maximal stimulation

was not achieved, interpretation of this EC50 value needs
caution. This result clearly showed that 14:0 LPA was a
weak agonist of HA-S1P4(E3.29(122)Q)-Gαi1(C351I) and
hence confirmed the involvement of residue 122 in S1P4
ligand preference. Similar results were obtained using a
second CHO-K1 clone expressing this fusion protein (not
shown).
Computational modelling of the S1P complex with the
wild type S1P4 receptor identifies the best S1P binding site
within the TM with the phosphate group at the extracellular end (Figure 4A). Ion pairs appear between the phosphate group of S1P and two cationic amino acids,
R3.28(121) and K5.38(202). An additional ion pair occurs
between the cationic ammonium of S1P and E3.29(122).
Hydrophobic residues from TM2, TM3, TM5 and TM6 line
the binding pocket and surround the alkyl chain of S1P.
The best complex of 14:0 LPA in the E3.29(122)Q S1P4
mutant receptor model has striking similarity to the best
complex of S1P in the wild type S1P4 receptor model (Figure 4B). Both models demonstrate ion pairing between
the phosphate group and two cationic amino acids,
R3.28(121) and K5.38(202). Each ligand interacts with the
amino acid at position 3.29(122), S1P by an ion pair with
the carboxylate of the wild type glutamate and 14:0 LPA
by a hydrogen bond with the mutated glutamine. Multiple hydrophobic residues surround the nonpolar tails of
the lipid ligands. The superimposition of the two complexes (Figure 4B) also demonstrates that the ligands
occupy almost identical volumes. Common interactions
and overlap volumes are qualitatively consistent with the
experimental findings that these ligands give similar 48%
and 40% maximal stimulation over basal for S1P at the
wild type and 14:0 LPA at the mutant receptor,
respectively.
In contrast to the complexes of 14:0 LPA with E3.29(122)Q
S1P4 and S1P with wild type S1P4, the remaining complexes show much less common volume (Figure 4C).
Most complexes exhibit the phosphate interactions
described for 14:0 LPA with E3.29(122)Q S1P4 and S1P with
wild type S1P4. Of particular interest is the observation
that the best complexes generated by Autodock for the
18:1 LPA species with wild type S1P4 has a very high positive van der Waals interaction energy, > 3000 kcal/mol,
compared to values well under 200 kcal/mol for every
other complex studied. In the best complexes found for
16:0 LPA and 18:1 LPA in both constructs, the terminal six
to eight carbons of the hydrophobic tails fold into Lshaped conformations quite different from the extended
conformations observed in the S1P complex with wild
type S1P4 or the 14:0 LPA complex with the E3.29(122)Q
S1P4 mutant. The terminal carbons in several complexes
curl out of the receptor between TM5 and TM6 (Figure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/5/12

4C) due to the restricted length of the binding pocket.
These results suggest that the complete lack of S1P4 activation in response to 18:1 LPA is likely due to failure to form
a complex. The strongest complexes formed, S1P with
wild type S1P4 and 14:0 LPA with the E3.29(122)Q S1P4
mutant, have complementary interactions with the residue at position 3.29(122). These strong complexes give
the most robust activation. Weak complexes are formed
for other combinations due to mismatched interactions
with position 3.29(122) or excessive length of the hydrophobic tail. The presence of hydrophobic tails of 16:0 or
18:1 LPA between transmembrane domains may additionally impair the conformational change necessary for
full agonist responses.

Discussion
Parental CHO-K1 cells respond to LPA in functional
assays, reflecting expression of endogenous LPA1 (G.
Holdsworth, et al., manuscript in preparation). For this
reason, fusion proteins between wild type or mutant HAS1P4 and the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi1(C351I) G protein were used in these studies. Expression of these proteins in CHO-K1 cells followed by treatment with
pertussis toxin prior to harvest allowed elimination of any
signal due to stimulation of endogenous LPA receptors.
McAllister et al. [11] (.(adopted a similar approach for
studies of the LPA1 receptor.
We examined the role of residue E3.29(122) in controlling
S1P4 ligand selectivity using functional and computational methods. This residue, which is conserved throughout the S1P receptors, has been shown to control ligand
specificity for the related S1P1 receptor [7]. Introduction
of the E3.29(122)Q mutation severely affected the response
of S1P4 to S1P: in dose-response experiments S1P caused
minimal stimulation at only the highest concentration of
ligand used. This is in agreement with published observations for activation of the equivalent S1P1 mutant [7].
14:0 LPA was able to induce dose-dependent stimulation
of S1P4(E3.29(122)Q) with an EC50 of approximately 3.8 µM
but only promoted minimal stimulation of the wild type
S1P4 receptor. The modelled complexes of 14:0 LPA with
E3.29(122)Q S1P4 and S1P with wild type S1P4 demonstrate
nearly identical volumes occupied by the two ligands and
very similar interactions between these ligands and their
respective receptors. Of particular importance are amino
acid residues at positions 3.28(121), 3.29(122) and
5.38(202), which either ion pair with the phosphate or
interact with the 2-amino or 2-hydroxyl group in S1P and
14:0 LPA, respectively. The importance of interactions
with amino acids at positions 3.28 and 3.29 has been previously noted for the S1P1 [6,7] and LPA1,2,3 [7,12]
receptors.

Constitutive activity of HA-S1P4 and HA-S1P4-Gαi1(C351I). Comparison of basal, vehicle and stimulated (10 µM S1P)
GTPγS binding for membranes prepared from CHO cells transfected to express HA-S1P4 or HA-S1P4 fused to PTx insensitive
Gαi1. Where indicated, cells were treated with 100ng/ml PTx for 24 hours prior to harvesting. PTx treatment of HA-S1P4transfected membranes prevented activation by S1P and also caused a dramatic reduction in basal signalling, indicative of constitutive activity. In contrast, when the HA-S1P4-Gαi1 fusion-expressing membranes were treated with PTx, there was only a
slight reduction in basal signalling and the receptor still responded to exogenous S1P, indicating that the receptor signalled via
the tethered, PTx-insensitive G protein. Basal signalling in PTx-treated HA-S1P4-Gαi1-expressing membranes exceeded that
seen with membranes from untransfected CHO cells.

The S1P4 receptor exhibits marked constitutive (agonistindependent) activity (Figure 5) which was unaffected by
the introduction of the E3.29(122)Q mutation (data not
shown). This indicates that the mutation perturbs S1P recognition without affecting the ability of the receptor to
spontaneously adopt an active conformation. Similar
observations have been reported for the β2AR, where a
mutation in the sixth transmembrane domain abolished
agonist activation but not constitutive activity [13].
Unlike S1P, which exists as a single species in vivo, the
term LPA actually refers to a family of molecules that take
the general form 1-o-acyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphate. Naturally occurring forms of LPA contain acyl
chains of differing lengths, with differing degrees of saturation. Investigations into the effect of the length and
degree of saturation of the acyl chain of LPA have been
undertaken for the LPA receptors [14,15], but limited SAR
information is available for S1P receptors (22). The LPAresponsive E3.29(122)Q S1P4 mutant facilitates structure
activity relationship (SAR) studies due to the greater avail-

ability of LPA analogs relative to S1P analogs. Comparison of space-filling models of the structures of S1P and
three analogues of LPA (Figure 4D) revealed that 14:0 LPA
most closely resembled S1P in terms of apparent length.
[35S]GTPγS binding assays demonstrated greater agonist
activity of 14:0 LPA at the mutant receptor relative to 18:1
or 16:0 LPA. This SAR indicates a length restriction for the
S1P4 agonist binding site. Model complexes of 16:0 and
18:1 LPA contained alkyl chains that fold at the bottom of
the binding pocket, defined by a cluster of hydrophobic
amino acids. Three of these differ either in position of
sidechain branching or size relative to LPA receptors and
the other S1P receptors. Position 2.46, I88 in S1P4, is leucine in LPA1–3 and other S1P receptors. Residue
I6.40(256) is larger than the valine found in the other
four S1P receptors, LPA1 and LPA3. Finally, I7.51(305)
corresponds to the smaller valine in S1P2 and S1P3 and the
much smaller alanine in LPA2. These findings provide a
molecular explanation for a similar SAR observed using
para-alkyl amide analogs of S1P [9]. SAR obtained with
the S1P4 mutant are in contrast to that shown by LPA

receptors, which exhibit the general trend of 18:1 ≥ 16:0 >
14:0 for potency and maximal stimulation [15].
Since mutation of residue 122 in the S1P4 receptor from
the naturally occurring glutamic acid to glutamine conferred responsiveness to 14:0 LPA and severely affected
responses to S1P, our observations support the hypothesis
that this conserved residue in the third transmembrane
domain of the S1P receptors is involved in ligand recognition. This is in contrast to a recent paper describing models of several GPCRs, including S1P4, which had been
generated using novel first principle methods [16]. In this
model of S1P4, interactions between S1P and residues
T7.34(127) and W7.37(291) and E7.30(284) were observed. Interaction of E7.30(284) with the ammonium group of S1P
appeared to control ligand selectivity since the other
residues appeared to interact with the phosphate group,
which is present on both LPA and S1P. It is therefore surprising that none of these residues are conserved throughout the S1P or LPA receptor families. The data presented
here support the assertion that glutamic acid residue 3.29
present in the third transmembrane domain of the S1P
receptors controls ligand selectivity and suggest that the
S1P4 model described by Vaidehi et al. [16] is inaccurate.
The current study provides new information for the development of more selective S1P receptor agonists. In particular, an S1P analog with its hydrophobic chain extended
by either 2 or 4 carbons would be a very poor agonist of
the S1P4 receptor. On the other hand, the activation of the
S1P1-E3.29(121)Q mutant by 18:1 LPA [7] indicates that a
chain-extended S1P analog should retain agonist activity
at the S1P1 receptor. S1P receptor agonists with differing
selectivity profiles will be useful tools to more completely
map the physiological and pathophysiological roles of
these receptors.

Conclusions
These studies confirm that glutamic acid residue 3.29,
present in the third transmembrane domain of the S1P
receptors is important for the selective recognition of S1P,
versus the closely related lipid, LPA. Mutation of E3.29 to
glutamine diminished response to S1P and allowed structure activity studies using the diverse available LPA species. The mutant S1P4 receptor is stimulated most strongly
by LPA 14:0 and is not activated by the longer LPA 18:1,
in contrast with a previous report on the analogous S1P1
receptor mutant that responded to LPA 18:1. Thus the
S1P4 receptor ligand binding pocket is shorter in length
than the S1P1 ligand binding pocket.

Methods
Residue nomenclature
Amino acids within the TM of S1P4 can be assigned index
positions to facilitate comparison between receptors with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/5/12

different numbers of amino acids, as described by Weinstein and coworkers [17]. An index position is in the format x.xx. The first number denotes the TM in which the
residue appears. The second number indicates the position of that residue relative to the most highly conserved
residue in that TM which is arbitrarily assigned position
50. E3.29, then, indicates the relative position of glutamate 122 in TM3 relative to the highly conserved arginine
143 in the E(D)RY motif which is assigned index position
3.50 [17].
Materials
Materials for tissue culture were supplied by Invitrogen
Ltd. (Paisley, Scotland, U.K.). Foetal bovine serum was
obtained from Helena Biosciences Ltd., (Sunderland,
U.K.) or PAA Labs GmbH., (Linz, Austria). Pertussis toxin
was purchased from CN Biosciences Ltd., (Nottingham,
U.K.). Lysophosphatidic acid (18:1, 16:0 and 14:0) and
S1P were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., (Alabaster, AL.,
U.S.A.). The SG1 antiserum was produced previously [18].
All other chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich Company
Ltd., (Gillingham, Dorset, U.K.) or BDH Ltd., (Poole, Dorset, U.K.) unless stated otherwise.
Construction of receptor expression plasmids
The S1P4 coding sequence was cloned from a human
PBMC cDNA library using the sense primer 5'-GAGAGAGCGGCCGCCACCATGTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTAACGCCACGGGGACCCCGGTG-3', which
contains a NotI restriction site (bold) and the haemagglutinin HA epitope tag (YPYDVPVYA, underlined) immediately after the initiator methionine, and the antisense
primer 5'-GAGAGAGAATTCGGCGATGCTCCGCACGCTGGAGATG-3', which contains an EcoRI restriction site
(bold) and changes the S1P4 stop codon to alanine
(underlined). A C351I mutant of the Gαi1 G protein (previously produced, [19]) was amplified using PCR with the
sense cloning primer 5'-GAGAGAGAATTCGCCA CCATGGGCTGCACACTGAGCG-3', which contains the EcoRI
restriction site (bold), and the antisense cloning primer
5'-GAGAGAGGATCCTTAGAAGAGACCGATGTCTTTTA
G-3', which contains a BamHI restriction site (bold). After
digestion of each PCR product with the appropriate
restriction enzymes, fragments were ligated into the pIRESpuro mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen Ltd.) to
generate an in-frame fusion between HA-S1P4 and
Gαi1(C351I).

The E3.29(122)Q mutation was introduced into the S1P4
sequence in parallel PCR reactions. Complementary oligonucleotides were designed across the residue which was
to be mutated such that each primer contained the necessary base change to mutate residue 122 to glutamine
(underlined in each primer): sense mutational primer: 5'CAGTGGTTCCTACGGCAGGGCCTGCTCTTCAC-3';

antisense mutational primer: 5'-GTGAAGAGCAGGCCCTGCCGTAGGAACCACTG-3'. Mutational sense or
antisense primers were used in parallel PCR reactions with
the appropriate antisense or sense cloning primer, with
HA-S1P4 plasmid DNA as template. Equimolar amounts
of each purified PCR product were mixed and amplified in
a further reaction, using the cloning primers described
above. The resultant product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated with the Gαi1
sequence in the pIRESpuro expression vector to generate
an in-frame fusion between HA-S1P4(E3.29(122)Q) and
Gαi1(C351I).
Cell culture and transfection
CHO-K1 cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM Lglutamine and non-essential amino acids. Sub-confluent
cell monolayers were stably transfected to express either
HA-S1P4-Gαi1(C351I) or HA-S1P4(E3.29(122)Q)-Gαi1(C351I)
fusion proteins using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen).
72 hours post-transfection, cells were seeded in media
supplemented with 7.5 µg/mL puromycin and the resultant clones examined for expression of cell surface receptor
using FACS analysis. Clonal cell lines were expanded in
complete DMEM containing 7.5 µg/mL puromycin and
were transferred to serum free DMEM approximately 24
hours prior to harvesting. Where indicated, 100 ng/mL
pertussis toxin was included in the serum free medium.

It should be noted that we initially expressed S1P4 in
RH7777 cells, which are unresponsive to S1P and LPA and
have been commonly used for studies of Edg family receptors [20]. Unfortunately, our attempts to detect activation
of S1P4 expressed in these cells using a variety of functional assays were unsuccessful. Therefore, we used CHOK1 cells as an alternative host in these studies; expression
of functional S1P4 in CHO-K1 cells has also been reported
by Mandala et al. [21].
FACS analysis
The amino-terminal HA-epitope tag was detected using a
fluorescein conjugate of the anti-HA antibody, clone 3F10
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals Ltd., Lewes, U.K.). Cells
were harvested non-enzymatically and washed with FACS
buffer (PBS containing 3% FBS and 0.1% NaN3) then
stained with the 3F10 antibody (or an isotype matched
control) for 40 minutes at 4°C in the dark. After washing
with FACS buffer, cells were analysed using a FACScalibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxon., U.K.).
Preparation of cell membranes
Cells were harvested non-enzymatically, washed with PBS
and resuspended in "assay buffer" (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,
3 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl), supplemented with "com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/5/12

plete" protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals
Ltd.). Cells were homogenised in a nitrogen cavitation
chamber (500 psi for 15 minutes). Unbroken cells and
nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 minutes, 4°C) and the supernatant fraction was centrifuged at
45,000 × g for 45 minutes at 4°C. Membrane pellets were
resuspended in assay buffer, titurated through a fine gauge
needle and stored at -80°C until required.
Immunoblot analysis
Samples were resolved by SDS-Page on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) and were transferred to ImmobilonP membrane (Millipore Ltd., Herts., U.K.). The membrane
was blocked using 2.5% Marvel in PBS before incubating
with primary antibodies which had been diluted in PBS/
0.1% Tween-20 containing 1% Marvel. The high affinity
rat anti-HA antibody was diluted 1 in 500; the anti-Gαi1
antibody (Autogen Bioclear Ltd., Wilts., U.K.) was diluted
1 in 1000. Immunoreactivity was detected using an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted 1 in 10,000 in PBS/0.1% Tween-20
containing 1% Marvel, followed by detection using SuperSignal reagents (Perbio Science Ltd., Cheshire, U.K.).
[35S]GTPγS binding assay
[35S]GTPγS binding experiments were performed essentially as described previously [22]. Briefly, membranes
were incubated with or without the indicated ligand for
30 minutes at 30°C in assay buffer containing [35S]GTPγS
(100 nCi/point), saponin (20 µg/point) and 0.1 µM GDP.
18:1 LPA was prepared as a 2 mM DMSO stock whilst 16:0
and 14:0 LPA were prepared as 2 mM stock solutions in
1:1 ethanol:water per supplier recommendation due to
their poor solubility in DMSO. S1P had previously been
dispensed as thin film aliquots (dissolved in MeOH and
the solvent evaporated under nitrogen) in brown glass
vials and stored at -70°C prior to use. Lipids (S1P or LPA
forms) were diluted in assay buffer containing 1% fatty
acid free BSA, such that the final concentration of BSA in
the assay was 0.1%. Following incubation, membrane
protein was solubilised with 1.25% NP-40 and 0.4% SDS
and after pre-clearance using non-immune serum, Gαi1/2
subunits were immunoprecipitated with SG1 antiserum,
used at a dilution of 1 in 200. Non-specific binding was
determined by the addition of 100 µM GTPγS. Bound
radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation
counting.
Experimental data analysis
Numerical data are expressed as means ± standard error,
shown as error bars in the appropriate figures. Statistical
comparisons were made using one-way ANOVA with
Dunnett's multiple comparison post test.

Receptor model development
A model of human S1P4 (GenBank™ accession number
AAP84350) was developed by homology to the experimentally-validated model of S1P1 [23]. Alignment of the
S1P receptor sequences was performed using the MOE
software package (version 2003. 01 ed. Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). The alignment was
optimised by the manual removal of gaps within the TM,
and alignment in the region of TM5 was shifted one position to correctly orient K5.38(202) toward the interior of
the helical bundle (Pham, et al., unpublished data). A preliminary model was generated by homology modelling
using default parameters and subsequently manually
refined to optimise interhelical hydrogen bonding. Cisamide bonds present in the loop regions were converted
to the trans conformation by manual rotation followed by
the minimisation of two residues on either side of the
amide linkage to a root mean square (RMS) gradient of
0.1 kcal/mol·Å using the MMFF94 forcefield [24]. After
these manual refinements, the receptor model was optimised using the MMFF94 forcefield to an RMS gradient of
0.1 kcal/mol·Å.

A model of S1P4 with the E3.29(122)Q mutation was developed by performing the appropriate mutation in MOE,
and saturating the residue with hydrogen atoms. To allow
the sidechains of the other residues in the binding pocket
to adapt to the presence of the new moiety, the backbone
atoms of the receptor were fixed and the receptor was optimised to an RMS gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol·Å using the
MMFF94 forcefield [24].
Ligand model development
Computational models of the naturally-occurring stereoisomers of 14:0 LPA, 16:0 LPA, 18:1 LPA, and S1P were
built using the MOE software package. The -1 ionization
state for the phosphate functionality was chosen for all
ligands, and the +1 ionization state was chosen for the
amine moiety of S1P. Previous docking studies using the 2 ionization state for phosphate in related systems yield
essentially identical geometries as studies using the -1 ionization state. These ligands were geometry optimised
using the MMFF94 force field [24].
Docking
Using the AUTODOCK 3.0 software package [25], 14:0
LPA, 16:0 LPA, 18:1 LPA, and S1P were docked into the
S1P4 wild type and S1P4 E3.29(122)Q mutant receptor models. Each docking box was centered near F3.33(126) with
dimensions of 30.75 × 23.25 × 23.25 or 32.25 × 23.25 ×
23.25 Å for shorter (S1P and 14:0 LPA) or longer (16:0
and 18:1 LPA) ligands, respectively. At least 20 putative
complexes were generated for each receptor:ligand pair
using docking parameters at default values with the exception of the number of energy evaluations (2.5 × 108), gen-

erations (10000) and maximum iterations (3000).
Resultant complexes were evaluated based on final
docked energy, Van der Waals interaction energies from
the MMFF94 forcefield as well as visual analysis. The complexes with the lowest final docked energies and others of
interest were geometry optimised using the MMFF94 force
field [24], and the lowest energy complex after minimisation was chosen as the final complex structure.
