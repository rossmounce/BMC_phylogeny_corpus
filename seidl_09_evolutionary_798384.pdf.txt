Abstract
Background: Proteins play a key role in cellular life. They do not act alone but are organised in
complexes. Throughout the life of a cell, complexes are dynamic in their composition due to
attachments and shared components. Experimental and computational evidence indicate that
consecutive addition and secondary losses of components played a major role in the evolution of
some complexes, mostly without affecting the core function. Here, we analysed in a large scale
approach whether this flexibility in evolution is only limited to a distinct number of complexes or
represents a more general trend.
Results: Focussing on human protein complexes, we based our analysis on a manually curated
dataset from HPRD. In total, 1,060 complexes with 6,136 proteins from 2,187 unique genes were
considered. We computed interologs in 25 different species and predicted the composition of
complexes. Over the analysed species, the composition of most complexes was highly flexible and
only 25% of all genes were never lost. Even if one component was lost at a particular point in time,
the fraction of observed second, independent losses of additional components was high (75% of all
complexes affected). Still, loss of whole complexes happened rarely. This biological signal deviated
significantly from random models. We exemplified this trend on the anaphase promoting complex
(APC) where a core is highly conserved throughout all metazoans, but flexibility in certain
components is observable.
Conclusion: Consecutive additions and losses of distinct units is a fundamental process in the
evolution of protein complexes. These evolutionary events affecting genes coding for units in
human protein complexes showed a significantly different phylogenetic pattern compared to
randomly selected genes. Determination of taxon specific attachments or losses might be linked to
specific cellular or morphological features. Thus, protein complexes contain not only structural and
functional, but also evolutionary cores.

Background
Proteins are, next to RNA, the fundamental unit of biological activity. But, they do not act alone. Many biological
and cellular processes require a precise organisation of
proteins in time and space [1]. These multi protein com-

plexes, also called molecular- or protein-machines, are
among the fundamental entities of molecular organisation [1,2]. Recent high throughput studies identified and
analysed the components of protein interaction networks
and how they are organised to functional units [1,3-5].

On a higher level, multi-protein complexes are embedded
in a network linking cellular processes [6]. Here, the complexes are connected by shared components, e.g. proteins
present in more than one complex. Most of these shared
components are associated peripherally and are not integral members of the complexes suggesting a role in the
regulation of molecular-machines [6]. Complementary to
this network view, protein complexes can be partitioned
in a core which is modulated by different attachments. By
adding different attachments, isoforms of a complex are
built, possibly with slightly different functions. Some of
these attachments, which can consist of multiple proteins
itself, can be connected to different core complexes. These
mobile regulatory units are often called modules [1]. The
combination of core functional units with variably
attached modules increases the number of different complexes and thereby the complexity of the cell. This complexity, comprising both the functional and structural
entities of protein complexes, raises the question how the
interplay of core complexes with variable attachments
evolved. As a first step in this direction, it has been shown
that yeast complexes enriched with gene products having
an ortholog in human preferentially interact with other
gene products that also have a human ortholog [3]. Comparing the constitution of cores and modules in other species revealed that they are unlikely to be present partially
[1]. This could be interpreted as an 'ortholog proteome'
that resembles the backbone necessary to facilitate fundamental functions of an eukaryotic cell [7].
Complementary to these large scale analyses, an in-depth
study of the SMN complex which is involved in splicing
revealed a high degree of evolutionary flexibility of its
components [8]. The studied complex is responsible for
mediating assembling of the UsnRNPs (uridine rich small
nuclear ribonucleoproteins). In humans, it consists of
eight components, namely SMN and the Gemins 2–8.
This complexity arose via addition of distinct entities to
a)

b)

the ancestral core of SMN and Gemin 2 which can already
be found in protists. Contrary to this trend, diptera have
lost three of the components but still contain a functional
SMN complex. Similar losses were found in further organism, indicating evolutionary dynamics of the complex.
Here, we addressed the question whether evolutionary
flexibility is limited to a distinct number of machines or
represents a general feature of the evolution of protein
complexes.

Results and discussion
A parsimony based approach for inferring the evolutionary
history of protein complexes
We focussed our analysis on human protein complexes
annotated in the human protein reference database
(HPRD), as this database is manually curated and, accordingly, of high quality [9]. At the time of the analysis, the
HPRD dataset contained 2,197 distinct genes which were
found in 1,060 protein complexes. As a first step, we identified orthologs of these genes in the genomes of a selected
subset of species (see Fig. 1a–c for a hypothetical example
of the applied approach). To provide a wide spectrum, we
chose 25 annotated eukaryotic species including 17 metazoan, six fungi, one choanoflagellate and one amoebozoa
as an outgroup (see Tab. 1). Using literature data, a phylogenetic tree for these species was reconstructed (see
Methods). For ortholog detection InParanoid [10] combined with an iterative searching approach was implemented (see Methods for details). Using the concept of
interolog mapping [11,12] allowed the prediction of the
constitution of 'orthologous' complexes in each species
(see Fig. 1b). This prediction will vary from the 'real' complex, as we did not consider gene duplications. A duplication in the other (non human) species should not
influence the results, as one of the copies is expected to
stay as a member of the protein complex. If the duplication is human specific, two scenarios have to be distinc)

guished. In the first, both human genes are components
of different protein complexes. In this case, their ancestor
was probably a member of both complexes [13]. In the
second scenario, only one of the duplicated proteins is a
member of a complex. In cases where this functionality
evolved after the speciation, a false positive will be seen.
Thus, gene duplications will only slightly influence the
prediction of the 'ortholog' complexes. Based on the presence and absence pattern of complexes and the forming
components we inferred the evolutionary history using on
a parsimony based approach (see Methods and Fig. 1c for
more information).
Emergence of protein complexes and their components
As a first step, the emergence of each gene coding for a
component was reconstructed according to the species
tree (Fig. 2, blue numbers). For 77% of the genes
orthologs were found in at least one fungus, indicating
that their origin lay before the split of fungi and metazoans. Branches with a substantial addition of orthologs
were the base of choanoflagellates-metazoans (157) and
from there to the metazoan lineage (181). Based on the
species sampling, these 'inventions' could also represent
fungi specific gene losses. It has been suggested that the
observable complexity of organisms is not mainly
reflected by the gene number [14,15] but, among many

other factors, by the number of protein interactions and
the resulting interaction networks [6]. Indeed, the estimated size of different interactomes, in which protein
complexes are embedded [6], is correlated with the biological complexity [16]. Thus, the emergence of genes colocalises with the increase in morphological complexity
and the evolution of certain traits, like for the vertebrates
(81) and mammals (31).
In a second step, we focused on the more complex centric
view and analysed the emergence of whole complexes. We
applied three alternative definitions specifying the emergence of a complex. (i) The point where at the first time
two or more components of the complex were found
(subsequently added or present at once), according to a
definition that at least two components are necessary to
constitute a complex [17]. (ii) The point of occurrence of
the largest set of components at one time. (iii) The point
of occurrence of all HPRD annotated components. Obviously, these definitions are oversimplifications as the
minimal number of components necessary to constitute a
functional complex could be different for every complex.
Still, with our definitions we provided an upper and lower
boundary to estimate complex emergence. With the most
general definition, most of the complexes were already
present in the last common ancestor of human and fungi

Figure 2
Phylogenetic Tree with gene and complex emergence and losses
Phylogenetic Tree with gene and complex emergence and losses. The pattern of gene and complex emergence and
the secondary losses of components of whole complexes is displayed along the tree according to the absence and presence
pattern of the ortholog genes in terminal species or in subsets of species concluding the loss in the last common ancestor of all
subsequent species. The numbers of gene and complex emergence is indicated in blue (complex emergence/gene emergence).
The number of secondary losses are shown in black per affected node. It was discriminated between whole complex losses and
gene losses (complex losses/gene losses). The significance of emergence (discriminated between complex and gene emergence)
and loss (only gene) events compared to the random model are indicated with '*'. As we restricted our analysis to fungi and
metazoans, evolutionary events which have been mapped to the base of the tree ('†') could have evolved at any time before the
split.
(approximately 85%), with an increase at the base of the
choanoflagellates-metazoans lineage, the metazoans, vertebrates and mammalians, respectively (Fig. 2). Comparable results were found with the second definition. Even
with the most conservative definition a high number of
complexes were observable at the last common ancestor
of human and fungi or before (approximately 42%) and
huge accretions at the base of the choanoflagellates-metazoans lineage (not considering fungi specific gene losses)
and the metazoans. Overall, nearly 82% of all complexes
had already emerged at that point. To test whether our
results reflect an evolutionary signal and not just random

fluctuations in complex composition we compared them
to a random model. We chose a random subset of human
genes identical in size to the original dataset and calculated the emergence of genes and complexes. This was
repeated 10,000 times and compared to the biological signal. For most of the nodes (highlighted with a '*' in Fig.
2), the number of gene and complex emergence events
differed significantly between the biological signal and
the random model (all p-values smaller than an alpha
(0.05) corrected for multiple testing, see Methods). In all
significant nodes, fewer genes evolved than expected from

the random model. Thus, a gene coding for a protein of a
human complex tends to be older than the average gene.
The initial emergence of a complex is followed by a
sequential addition of further components which might
be linked to cellular or morphological features. Moreover,
most components of protein complexes emerged early in
the species tree and tend to be older than randomly chosen human genes.
Secondary loss
Having calculated the point of emergence for each component of a human protein complex, we were now able to
address the question of secondary losses of genes and
whole complexes. For each gene present in a human protein complex, we predicted species missing its ortholog
and, to identify the likely branch of gene loss, mapped
gene losses to the last common ancestor. To test the significance of the observed pattern, we compared our results to
a random model which took into account the observed
bias of emergence events. In all significant cases (with
Aspergillus niger, Phycomyces blakesleeanus and Anopheles
gambiae as exceptions) fewer losses were observed than
expected from the random model. Nevertheless, a high
number of losses occurred along the tree (Fig. 2, black
numbers). Interestingly, Encephalitozoon cuniculi has lost
approximately 73.2% of the genes present in the last common ancestor of fungi and metazoan/choanoflagellates
lineage. This might be the result of the intracellular parasitic nature with a reduced gene set, complete losses of
biochemical pathways and a reduced protein-protein
interaction network [18]. Comparable, but not equally
large gene losses were observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Monosiga brevicollis, Trichoplax adhaerens, Caenorhabditis
elegans and Ciona intestinalis. A general trend for the loss
of genes was already described for fungi, insects and C. elegans [19-21]. When looking only at genes with orthologs
in human protein complexes we recall this trend for fungi
and C. elegans. In contrast, we did not find any outstanding number of losses in insects in general or diptera in particular. The high number of losses found in C. intestinalis
might be caused by errors in gene prediction. In the analysis of the SMN complex orthologs for C. intestinalis were
not identified on the proteomic level due to annotation
problems, but in a search against the whole genome shotgun sequences [8]. This example highlights the dependency of this analysis on the quality of the available
genome data. Here, we focussed on proteins with a function in a protein complex which evolve comparably slow
[22]. As most gene annotation pipelines utilize homology
prediction, the rate of false positives will be lower than for
randomly chosen proteins.

In total, only 25% of the genes found in human protein
complexes were present in all species subsequent to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/155

initial emergence. Of this 522 genes, 302 (approximately
58%) have already emerged before the fungi/metazoan
split. The fraction of at least one secondary loss in the
HPRD dataset of 2,197 human genes was 76.2%. This
highlights the evolutionary flexibility of genes coding for
components which are part of protein complexes. 913
genes were affected by more than one loss event, which is
approximately 55% of all the genes affected by secondary
losses. Thus, genes which are affected by a loss once, are
more likely to be affected by additional further losses.
Nearly 44% of all 2,197 analysed genes were present in
more than one complex and 36 of them were found in
more than 10 different complexes. Of the nine genes that
are shared between more than 15 complexes those with
the highest occurrence were never lost, especially Integrin
beta-1 precursor [Ensembl:ENSG00000150093] which is
present in 54 complexes. The mean number of losses in
genes that are present in more than 10 complexes was
1.25 (range 0–5), the mean number of losses found in
only a single complex was 1.65 (range 0–13). Genes coding for proteins that are present in multiple complexes
and therefore form a high number of interactions tend to
evolve more slowly and seem to be more conserved than
genes coding for proteins with few interactions, however
the magnitude of difference was not dramatic [19,23].
Our analysis corroborates these observations.
Contrasting a high variability of the components of protein complexes, we rarely observed a loss of a whole complex. An exception was again E. cuniculi, which had lost
many complexes completely. Thus, the loss of certain
parts of already established complexes seems to be tolerable for the fitness of the organism. Overall, only 32 complexes annotated in HPRD (excluded complexes with the
size of one) did not suffer from any secondary loss (3%)
and 96.13% had at least one secondary loss of any component present (1,019). 75% of the complexes had at
least two losses, indicating that functional modules or single components of different subunits were lost. Still, the
core functionality of the complex has to be conserved,
either as the result of the remained functionality or by the
recruitment of non-ortholog, but functional equivalent,
gene products. When predicting the composition of
human complexes in other species, our analysis suggest
that the composition is evolutionary highly flexible. However, the absence of whole complexes was rarely observed,
indicating that either the remaining component are sufficient or additional, species specific, components are
recruited to preserve the main function of the complex in
the given context. In contrast, the partial loss or presence
of ortholog components in different species in either core
or modules has not been reported for yeast [1]. This difference might be the result of the heterogeneity of the HPRD
datasets, comprising core, modules and attachments or

the fact that the protein interaction network of human,
compared to yeast, is larger, generating more hypothetical
possibilities of flexibility.
Evolutionary dynamics of the APC Complex
As a case study, we analysed the anaphase-promoting
complex (APC), also called cyclosome, in detail. The APC
plays a key role in the degradation of cyclines and other
factors of cell cycle regulation mediated by the attachment
of multiple ubiquitine chains to a lysine residue in the target protein (for a review on ubiquitination see [24]). The
human cyclosome is a large, 1.5 MDa complex consisting
of 11 core components (annotated in HPRD as
'COM_144'; one additional component, Apc13 is not

described in HPRD) and two additional transient attachments (also not found in HPRD) required to bridge the
interaction with the substrate [25] and activate the APC
[26]. Two components, Apc2 and Apc11, built the catalytic core of the complex [25] and both are conserved
throughout most eukaryotes and essential in the examined species [27,28]. The whole complex can be divided in
four different sub-complexes, composed of the structural
part (Apc1/Apc4/Apc5), the catalytic arm (Apc2/Apc11/
Apc10), a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) arm (Apc8/Apc6/
Apc3/Apc7/Cdc26/Apc13
[Ensembl:ENSG00000129055]) involved in adaptor

substrate (Cdc20/Cdh1; [Ensembl:ENSG00000117399]/
[Ensembl:ENSG00000105325]).
We predicted the composition of the APC complex in 24
species using the described InParanoid procedure. For
species where a loss was inferred we manually checked the
absence of the particular gene product by using a reciprocal best hit approach against the NCBI non redundant
database (nrdb).
The structural part of the complex was already present in
the last common ancestor of human and fungi (Fig. 3,
additional file 1 for the corresponding gene identifier).
Apc1 was ubiquitous found in all species except E.
cuniculi. The ortholog in Danio rerio was identified by a
manual search against nrdb. Apc4 was lost in E. cuniculi
and seems to be lost in S. cerevisiae. Experiments revealed
a protein functionally corresponding to Apc4 in S. cerevisiae, but it was highly divergent and showed only a weak
similarity to the human and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe
Apc4 [27,28]. E. cuniculi and M. brevicollis have furthermore lost Apc5. The ortholog of Apc5 in C. elegans was not
predicted by InParanoid, however could be inferred by a
search against nrdb.
The components of the catalytic arm of the multi-protein
enzyme were also present in the last common ancestor of
fungi and human. Apc10, promoting substrate binding
[25], was the most conserved subunit found in every
examined species. Apc2 and Apc11, both part of the catalytic core, were identified throughout our species selection, except for E. cuniculi and in the case of Apc11 in M.
brevicollis. The orthologs of Apc11 in Xenopus tropicalis,
Drosophila melanogaster and C. intestinalis were identified
by a manual search against nrdb.
The TPR arm components were also present in the last
common ancestor of fungi and humans. Apc3, Apc6 and
Apc8 were found in all analysed metazoan genomes and
are even conserved throughout most fungi [25], highlighting the importance of the subunits to associate the attachments to the APC. Apc7, another component of the TPR
arm sub-complex, has been described as vertebrate specific. Recent studies [29] indicated a genuine ortholog in
D. melanogaster. We identified further orthologs in all
metazoan and in M. brevicollis with the only exception of
C. elegans. Additional orthologs were identified in plants
and Dictyostelium discoideum. Thus, fungi seem to have lost
this gene. The Cdc26 subunit, a small protein of 86 amino
acids, was only identified in chordates and arthropods.
Functional equivalents were described in S. cerevisiae (also
named Cdc26) and S. pombe (named Hcn1) [30]. A manual PSI-BLAST [31] search with the S. cerevisiae Cdc26 protein and the S. pombe Hcn1, respectively, did not report
any sequence similarity to other proteins in our dataset.

The APC complex demonstrate that both high evolutionary flexibility and conservation of entities in human complexes could be observed. Moreover, we show examples
that the loss of a gene can be compensated by the displacement with a non-homologous gene product to sustain the
functionality of the complex.

Conclusion
How do protein complexes evolve? Do they emerge with
all components at a specific branch in the phylogenetic
tree or is it a more gradual process over longer time scale?
Looking from human complexes back into phylogenetic
history, we found that both is true. In most cases the emergence of some members of the complex is followed by the
addition of further components. Still most components of
protein complexes tend to be older than randomly chosen
genes. Although the components show fewer losses than
observed in a random model we also revealed frequent
secondary losses of genes involved in a specific complex.
Are these losses of genes with a possibly important function in the human complex real? A critical point in the
analysis is the sequence based ortholog detection. If proteins evolve too fast, homologs might not be identified
but still be present leading to false negatives and thereby
to increased loss rates. An analysis of the BLAST algorithm
underlying InParanoid showed that BLAST consistently
identified homologs even over larger phylogenetic distances than used here [32]. We further improved sensitivity by using InParanoid, one of the best programs for
ortholog detection [33] and applying iterative pairwise
comparisons. Finally, the analysis focussed on proteins
with a function in a complex which evolve slower than
randomly selected proteins. We therefore expect only a
small influence by false negative orthologs. We identified
secondary gene losses on the sequence level, without the
possibility to infer the function of the resulting complexes
in the examined species. The SMN complex demonstrated
that even with a reduced set of genes a complex can be still
functional. Moreover, as seen in the APC complex, the
loss of a gene can be compensated by the displacement
with a non-homologous gene product. In many cases
these enzymes have evolved by shifting the substrate specificity of a related but distinct enzyme [34].
Despite these limitation, our results indicate that losses
can happen even for genes which are tightly bound into
an interaction network like a protein complex. Together
with the gradual emergence this has several consequences.
First, one can identify an evolutionary core of a protein
complex complementary to structural or functional cores.
Second, taxon specific attachments or losses of complexes
might be linked to specific cellular or morphological features. Third, the identification of the 'smallest' version of
a complex might enable an easier experimental characterisation.

Methods
Genomic Data
Genomes used in this study as well as their source and version are given in Tab. 1[14,15,18,35-53].
Species Tree
The phylogenetic tree used to guide the analysis and the
ortholog identification was based on literature data. The
position of D. discoideum as the outgroup to all other sampled species has been shown in [41] where a phylogeny
based on ortholog clusters between different species had
been calculated. The relationship of the fungi was derived
from [54] where a concatenated six gene marker was used
to infer the positions of the species. The position of the
microsporidia (e.g. E. cuniculi) within the fungi is currently under debate, due to accelerated rate of sequence
evolution. Early results suggested that microsporidia are
among the earliest diverging protist lineages within the
eukaryotes [55], however this seems to be an artefact of
'long branch attraction (LBA)' [56,57]. Recent phylogenetic [54,58,59] and molecular results [60-62] have
implied that microsporidia are in fact atypical fungi [63]
(Fig. 2 – red/light-red box). For the choanoflagellate M.
brevicollis the position on the basis as the closest known
relative to the metazoan clade was extracted from [44].
The basic relationship within the metazoan was found in
[64](Fig. 2 – light-blue box). The nematod C. elegans was
placed as a sister group to the arthropods, according to the
ecdysozoa hypothesis (Fig. 2 – blue box). An analysis
based on the coelomata hypothesis did not lead to substantially different results (supplemental material, additional file 2). The precise order in the arthropods was
gathered from the honey bee genome publication [36],
for the fishes from a phylogenomics approach focusing on
the Hox gene cluster [65]. The position of the lancelets
and the urochordates to the vertebrates was chosen based
on recent molecular data, suggesting that the urochordates, and not the lancelets [66], are the closest relatives to
vertebrates [67]. As the exact order of divergence of the
placozoan and cnidaria has not been determined beyond
doubts [68], it was represented as a trifurcation.
Ortholog detection
For the analysis of the ortholog relationships we used
InParanoid [10] in version 2.0, with standard parameters
and an outgroup. The outgroup was chosen as the closest
sister taxon of the compared species. The underlying
BLAST search was performed with the usage of the '-F m S'
option enabling soft filtering of low complexity regions.
This option will result in the highest number of identified
orthologs and minimal error rates for BLAST based identification methods [69]. In order to increase the sensitivity
of the ortholog identification we applied an iterative, triangular approach searching from a given gene to all identified orthologs in other species and used them as the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/155

starting point for another search until no new ortholog
were identified. This should further increase the sensitivity
of the InParanoid algorithm, which has been reported to
be about 80% [70], with both specificity and sensitivity,
and therefore the best performing ortholog detection
method [70,71]. Moreover, the test dataset used in [70]
comprised six different eukaryotes (Arabidopsis thalia, C.
elegans, D. melanogaster, Homo sapiens, S. cerevisiae and S.
pombe) spanning an even broader range of the eukaryotic
tree of life. To further increase the sensitivity the BLAST
searches were performed on protein sequences, whereas
the definition of orthology is based on genes. Therefore,
the resulting ortholog clusters had to be matched to genes.
Following, overlapping or identical clusters, in the case of
isoforms through alternative splicing, had to be resolved.
In the clearest scenario a cluster consisted of more than
two proteins from one species and, after mapping to the
corresponding coding gene, the cluster had two identical
genes. For this cluster one of the identical genes was
deleted during the collapsing process. If two independent
clusters consisted of several proteins and the clusters
became identical after mapping, one of this clusters was
deleted. In the case of overlapping clusters after mapping
the clusters were merged.
As a result of the iterative search and the possibility of
false positive assignments, the specificity might decrease.
As our focus was on the secondary losses and the resulting
evolutionary flexibility, this should only weakly influence
our predictions. Moreover, this iterative search procedure
should reduce the effect of fast evolving genomes and differences in the evolutionary rate of the examined species
because the ortholog prediction is not merely based on
direct ortholog identification starting from human, but
predicting orthologs from more closely related species.
We defined gene emergence as the point in the lineage
leading to the most recent common ancestor of the species in which the ortholog genes were present [72] (see
Fig. 1c). This maximum parsimony approach will give a
too recent origin of the gene if it was lost in the sister
group of the derived last common ancestor. Considering
the species sampling, this effect might be prominent for
genes lost in fungi, which will be classified as metazoan
specific. Similarly, a secondary loss was defined as the
point in the phylogenetic tree where no ortholog of a
given gene could be identified. This could be in a species
or in the last common ancestor of several species if subsequent to the ancestor no ortholog was identified [19].
Thus, no multiple independent losses were counted (see
Fig. 1c).
Interaction data
The protein-complex dataset was based on HPRD [9] version 7 (9. Jan. 2007). We extracted only data derived by

affinity purification techniques leading to 1,060 complexes with 6,136 annotated proteins. The latter were
mapped to 4,939 genes in total. These represented 2,197
unique genes due to homo-dimerisation of the gene products within a complex as well as gene products present in
more than one complex.
Comparison of phylogenetic pattern with random sets
To test, whether the observed evolutionary trends
reflected a specific feature of protein complexes, we compared our results with a random model. We randomly
drew 2,197 human genes out of the human dataset
(approximately 23,000 genes). Based on this dataset, we
applied the iterative ortholog detection method and
retrieved the phylogenetic pattern of emergence. Moreover, based on the random dataset of 2,197 distinct genes
we calculated random complexes with the same size distribution observed in the HPRD dataset (1,060 random
complexes with 4,939 genes; genes must not be present
twice or more in a given, but can be present in multiple
complexes). We computed 10,000 repeats and compared
this random model to the phylogenetic pattern observed
for the HPRD dataset. As secondary losses depend on the
point of emergence, we created a subset of randomly chosen 2,197 distinct genes out of the human dataset according to the observed distribution of emergence events
along the tree. Furthermore, we created random complexes with the same size distribution observed in the
HPRD dataset. For these dataset we computed 1,000
repeats and compared the phylogenetic pattern of secondary losses with the HPRD dataset. To estimate whether the
biological signal deviated from the random model, we
counted how many times a larger or lower signal, depending on the under- or overrepresentation of evolutionary
events, was found in the random set. This count was
divided by the number of random experiments to obtain
a p-value estimate for every node. We corrected the alphavalue 0.05 for multiple testing according to the rough false
discovery rate and marked the nodes with a p-value
smaller than the corrected alpha as significant.
