Abstract
Background: Proteolytic Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism, a severe
neuroparalytic illness. Given the severity of botulism, surprisingly little is known of the population
structure, biology, phylogeny or evolution of C. botulinum. The recent determination of the genome
sequence of C. botulinum has allowed comparative genomic indexing using a DNA microarray.
Results: Whole genome microarray analysis revealed that 63% of the coding sequences (CDSs)
present in reference strain ATCC 3502 were common to all 61 widely-representative strains of
proteolytic C. botulinum and the closely related C. sporogenes tested. This indicates a relatively stable
genome. There was, however, evidence for recombination and genetic exchange, in particular
within the neurotoxin gene and cluster (including transfer of neurotoxin genes to C. sporogenes),
and the flagellar glycosylation island (FGI). These two loci appear to have evolved independently
from each other, and from the remainder of the genetic complement. A number of strains were
atypical; for example, while 10 out of 14 strains that formed type A1 toxin gave almost identical
profiles in whole genome, neurotoxin cluster and FGI analyses, the other four strains showed
divergent properties. Furthermore, a new neurotoxin sub-type (A5) has been discovered in strains
from heroin-associated wound botulism cases. For the first time, differences in glycosylation
profiles of the flagella could be linked to differences in the gene content of the FGI.
Conclusion: Proteolytic C. botulinum has a stable genome backbone containing specific regions of
genetic heterogeneity. These include the neurotoxin gene cluster and the FGI, each having evolved
independently of each other and the remainder of the genetic complement. Analysis of these
genetic components provides a high degree of discrimination of strains of proteolytic C. botulinum,
and is suitable for clinical and forensic investigations of botulism outbreaks.

Background
The species Clostridium botulinum consists of a group of
four physiologically and phylogenetically distinct Gram-

positive obligately anaerobic bacteria that share the common feature of producing the highly potent botulinum
neurotoxin [1]. Organisms belonging to two of these

groups are associated with the majority of cases of human
botulism. C. botulinum Group I (proteolytic C. botulinum)
is a mesophilic organism that is responsible for foodborne botulism, wound botulism, adult intestinal botulism and infant botulism. C. sporogenes is considered to be
a non-toxigenic version of proteolytic C. botulinum [2]. C.
botulinum Group II (non-proteolytic C. botulinum) is a psychrotrophic organism associated with most cases of foodborne botulism not attributed to Group I [3,4]. The
botulinum neurotoxins are the most potent toxins
known, with as little as 30–100 ng constituting a potentially fatal dose [5], and are considered to be a bioterrorism threat [6].

completed, and consists of a chromosome (3.9 Mbp) and
plasmid (16.3 kbp), which contain 3,650 and 19 coding
sequences (CDSs), respectively [14]. A DNA microarray
was designed based on this sequence, and initial tests
revealed that two prophages and a plasmid present in the
genome of strain ATCC 3502 were absent from 11 test
strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes, and
that the DNA microarray could be used to discriminate
between strains of proteolytic C. botulinum [14]. The 11
test strains shared a minimum of 84% of the CDSs of
ATCC 3502, but were significantly diverged from other
sequenced clostridial species, demonstrating the wide
phylogenetic distance between different clostridia [14].

Seven major types of botulinum neurotoxin (types A to
G), and a significant number of sub-types have been
described. For example, four sub-types of type A toxin
(termed A1, A2, A3, A4) have been identified [7-9]. Subtypes are defined as differing by at least 2.6% at the amino
acid level [7,10]. Proteolytic C. botulinum strains form
neurotoxin of types A, B, or F, and dual-toxin forming
strains have also been described [2]. Additionally, some
strains possess two neurotoxin genes, but only form one
active neurotoxin. For example, A(B) strains possess a type
A and type B neurotoxin gene, but only form type A neurotoxin. Non-proteolytic C. botulinum strains form a single
neurotoxin of types B, E, or F. Each neurotoxin protein
comprises a light chain and heavy chain. The light chains
possess endopeptidase activity and cleave proteins in the
SNARE complex leading to flaccid muscle paralysis, and
potentially respiratory failure [11].

The flagellar glycosylation island (FGI) also showed evidence of diversity between strains of proteolytic C. botulinum [14]. The ATCC 3502 genome contains a large
putative FGI comprising CDSs CBO2666-2729. These are
flanked by the CDSs for flagellar structural proteins FlgB
(CBO2665), FliD and the flagellin structural subunits
FlaA1 (CBO2730) and FlaA2 (CBO2731). The FGI can be
divided into two distinct regions [14]. CBO2678-2689 are
CDSs similar to those involved in capsular polysaccharide
biosynthesis in Group B Streptococcus (designated FGI-I,
flanked by putative flagellin structural genes CBO 2666
and CBO 2695), whereas CBO2696-2729 represent CDSs
with sequence similarity to those involved in the modification of Campylobacter jejuni flagellins with nonulosonic
acids (designated FGI-II, CBO2696-CBO2729) [14].

The neurotoxin genes are associated with other genes
within the neurotoxin cluster, and two major cluster types
are recognised. The most studied neurotoxin cluster in
proteolytic C. botulinum is termed the ha plus/orf-X minus
cluster. It is commonly associated with type A1 and type B
neurotoxin genes [9,12,13], and is present in the genome
of the sequenced type A1 strain ATCC 3502 used as a
hybridisation reference in this work [14]. This cluster
comprises genes for the neurotoxin (cntA), three haemagglutinins (HA) (cntC, cntD, cntE), non-toxic-non-haemagglutinin (NTNH) (cntB), and a positive regulatory protein
(cntR). The second cluster type is called the ha minus/orfX plus cluster. In the case of proteolytic C. botulinum, this
cluster is most frequently associated with type A2, A3, A4
and F toxin genes, and the type A1 gene in A(B) strains
[9,12,13]. This cluster includes genes for the neurotoxin,
NTNH and CntR (historically also known as p21 [9,13]),
lacks the three genes encoding HA, and additionally contains a group of three open reading frames (orf-X1, orf-X2,
orf-X3) and a single CDS (coding sequence) (p47) all of
unknown function.
The genome sequence of proteolytic C. botulinum strain
ATCC 3502 (NCTC 13319, Hall 174) has been recently

In order to extend our understanding of phylogenetic relationships and the biology of proteolytic C. botulinum, an
extensive comparative genomic indexing study has been
carried out involving 58 strains of proteolytic C. botulinum, 2 strains of non-proteolytic C. botulinum, and 3
strains of C. sporogenes using DNA microarrays based on
the genome sequence of strain ATCC 3502. We have
assessed the evolution of the neurotoxin gene and cluster
and flagellar glycosylation island (FGI) in relation to the
remainder of the genetic complement. We have also identified important links between CDSs contained within the
FGI and sugars associated with post-translational modification of flagella, and discovered a new neurotoxin A subtype associated with UK wound botulism cases.

Methods
Bacterial strains and preparation of DNA
C. botulinum and C. sporogenes strains used in this work,
together with the type of neurotoxin formed, their origin,
source and date of isolation are listed in Table 1. Before
use, all strains were checked for purity (consistent colony
morphology) and lack of contamination by growth on
PYGS plates under both aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres [15]. Proteolytic activity was determined by growth
on Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM) containing 5%
(w/v) skim milk [16] and lipase activity on McClung

Toabe egg yolk medium [17]. Strains were also checked
for presence of type A, B and F neurotoxin genes by PCR
using 100 ng genomic DNA as template with primer pairs
NKB-1 (5'-GATACATTTACAAATCCTGAAGGAGA-3') and
NKB-5 (5'-AACCGTTTAACACCATAAGGGATCATAGAA3') which generate a 2278 bp PCR product for the type A
neurotoxin gene; B-1A (5'-GATGGAACCATTTGCTAG-3')
and B2-D (5'-AACATCAATACATATTCCTGG-3') which
generate a 1284 bp PCR product for the type B neurotoxin
gene [18]; and BONTFF2 (5'-GTGCTTATTATGATCCTAATTATTTAACC-3') and BONTFR2 (5'-CCATACTTCCATTGAAAATAATCTTTATA-3') which, using the same
reaction conditions, give a 765 bp PCR product for the
type F neurotoxin gene (data not shown). The type(s) of
neurotoxins formed by each strain was established by
sero-neutralisation and the mouse bioassay [19,20].

land (cntR/F, cntA/F-N and cntA/F-C), ATCC 3502 (cntA/AN and cntA/A-C), and NCTC 3815 (cntA/B-N and cntA/BC). The microarray probe to the haemagglutinin gene cntC
(CBO0803; previously ha34) failed to give a satisfactory
signal and these microarray data were excluded from the
analysis. The overall extent of genome coverage is similar
to that achieved previously for other DNA microarrays
[22-24]. GenBank accession numbers for genomes used in
this work are: A1 strain ATCC 3502, AM412317; ATCC
3502 plasmid pBOT3502, AM412318; A1 strain ATCC

NZ_ABDP00000000 (genome in progress); C. sporogenes
strain ATCC 15579, NZ_ABKW00000000 (genome in
progress). The microarray design has been deposited with
ArrayExpress (accession number A-MEXP-791).

Genomic DNA was purified from exponentially growing
cells, digested with Sau3A1 and labelled with fluorescent
nucleotides as previously described [14] except that Cy5or Cy3-dUTP (GE Healthcare, UK) was substituted for
Cy5- or Cy3-dCTP. The isolation of plasmid DNA followed the method outlined by O'Sullivan and Klaenhammer [21]. For restriction enzyme analysis, the
manufacturer protocols (New England BioLabs, USA)
were followed with the addition of spermidine to a final
concentration of 4 mM. Digests were analyzed by standard gel electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose.

Microarray hybridisation and data analysis
Each experiment combined 2 μg Cy5-dUTP-labelled
ATCC 3502 (reference) DNA and 2 μg Cy3-dUTP-labelled
test DNA, and was performed on a minimum of four
probe set replicates as described previously [14]. DNA
microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B
microarray laser scanner (Axon Instruments, CA, USA).
The data from detected features was initially processed
using the GenePix Pro v.6.0 software supplied with the
scanner.

Construction of the C. botulinum ATCC 3502 DNA
microarray
The microarray [14] included probes for 3433 genomic
CDS, for 19 CDSs of plasmid pBOT3502, and for neurotoxin-associated genes absent in strain ATCC 3502. These
included probes for CDSs of the gene clusters commonly
associated with neurotoxins type A2, A3, A4 and F (i.e.
p47, orf-X1, orf-X2, orf-X3 and lycA); for cntR of type F; and
two probes each (N- and C-terminus probes) for cntA
(neurotoxin CDS) of types A, B, and F. Probes were
designed using GenBank database sequences (available in
July 2005), and PCR amplified using DNA from strains
NCTC 9837 (p47, orf-X1, orf-X2, orf-X3 and lycA), Lange-

The R package arrayMagic v.1.14.0 [25] was used to assess
the quality of the hybridisations by generating a diagnostic plot showing the pairwise similarities between all
hybridisations. The pairwise similarity score (Sab) was calculated by arrayMagic via Sab = MADi(Xia - Xib), where for
each pair of arrays (a and b) Xia is the log-ratio of the i-th
probe on the a-th array, and the MAD (median absolute
deviation) is taken over all CDSs. The hierarchical clustering diagram generated used the similarity scores as a
measure of the 'distance' between arrays. In this way the
fidelity of the microarray technical replicates could be
assessed (arrayMagic's R script, experiment description
file and diagnostic plot are available on request). The data

for replicates that did not group together were discarded
and the hybridisation experiments repeated with a fresh
preparation of genomic DNA. Array data were further analysed using the GeneSpring GX package (Agilent Technologies) using Lowess normalisation. In order to correct for
uneven printing or for probes which routinely gave a high
or low signal, data were further normalised by using as a
control hybridisation data from ATCC 3502 × ATCC 3502
dye-swap experiments (four microarrays) on a per CDS
basis.
Pearson Correlation coefficients were calculated for the
normalised signal ratios associated with probes for all
chromosomal and pBOT3502 CDSs and used to create a
similarity matrix for all 61 strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes. The similarity matrix was subjected
to the average linkage clustering method using GeneSpring GX software.
The data generated by probes for neurotoxin cluster genes
not found in ATCC 3502 were processed separately as
there was no competing reference DNA during hybridisation. Whereas a signal channel ratio of 0.55 was taken as
the cut-off between a presence or absence of hybridisation
for chromosomal genes, a ratio greater than 5.0 was taken
as a positive hybridisation for CDSs not in ATCC 3502.
This gave results that agreed well with known genome
sequences of C. botulinum in the GenBank database. Data
for probes to the ATCC 3502 neurotoxin gene cluster itself
used a cut-off point of 0.40 to compensate for the fact that
all hybridisations had been performed using ATCC 3502
DNA as the reference material.
Validation of microarray
The microarray data were validated for biological significance using CDSs within the clostridial flagellar glycosylation island (FGI) and plasmid pBOT3502. The DNA
sequence of 28 CDSs from the FGI-I (Figures 1 and 2) of
ATCC 3502 and proteolytic C. botulinum type F strain
Langeland, matched by annotation using genomic context
and BlastP, was compared to the signals observed by
microarray analysis. The highest sequence similarity
between two homologous CDSs (CBO2682 and
CLI_2747) corresponding to an absence of microarray
hybridisation was 84.8%. The lowest sequence similarity
between two homologous CDSs (CBO2683 and
CLI_2748) that hybridised to the microarray was 85.7%,
giving a minimum value of approximately 85% sequence
identity between CDSs for a positive microarray hybridisation result. A similar percentage was previously reported
for studies with Candida [26] and Helicobacter pylori [27].
Further validation was carried out by analysis of data for
the 19 probes to the plasmid pBOT3502. Using a cut-off
value of 0.30 (because of very high signals), only one
strain, F9801A, gave a positive microarray signal for all 19

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/115

CDSs (Figure 3). Subsequent tests demonstrated that this
strain, but not two others that were tested, contained a
plasmid that shared identical restriction sites to that of
pBOT3502 (Figure 4). Additionally, pBOT3502 contains
five CDSs (CBOP15–CBOP19) that are dedicated to the
synthesis and secretion of the bacteriocin, boticin [14].
However apart from F9801A, no other strain gave a microarray signal for these probes, including C. botulinum strain
213B. This strain carries a plasmid bearing the genes for
boticin B [28], so might have been expected to give a positive signal. However, alignment of the 1 kb sequence
from strain 213B with that of pBOT3502 showed that
sequence identity over this region, spanning pBOT3502
CDSs CBOP16 and CBOP17, was only 52.1% which
would fail to give a positive microarray signal.
Isolation and mass spectrometry analysis of flagellin
proteins
Flagellin proteins were isolated [29] and mass spectrometry studies of intact flagellin proteins were carried out as
described in earlier studies [30,31]. In some cases a large
precipitate was observed in dialysed flagellin preparations. Protein isolates were evaporated to dryness in a
Savant SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientific UK) before
resuspending in 5–10 μl of formic acid. The sample was
agitated gently to dissolve protein and diluted 10-fold
with hexafluoroisopropanol. Samples were infused into a
hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(Micromass Q-TOF2, Waters Corporation, MA, USA) at a
flow rate of 0.5–1.0 μl/min [30,31]. Top down mass spectrometry experiments were performed as described by
[30], using argon collision gas with collision energies
ranging from 20–30V.
Sequencing of sub-type A5 neurotoxin genes carried by
wound botulism strains
To lower the risk of PCR-based errors, the A5 genes were
sequenced using non-cloned PCR products. Initial 3.8 kb
PCR products of the majority of the gene CDS were generated using a LongRange PCR kit (Qiagen, UK), with primers BONTAF1 (5'-GCAACCAGTAAAAGCTTTTAAAATTC3'), BONTAR1 (5'-CCATCCATCATCTACAGGAATAAA-3')
and 100 ng genomic DNA as template. PCR products were
purified using DyeEx 2.0 spin columns (Qiagen).
Sequencing was carried out using an AbiPrism 3730 capillary sequencer. Sequence of the entire 3.8 kb PCR product was achieved by designing primers using available
sequence data and by 'walking' forward on both strands.
Comparison of the 3.8 kb sequence with published examples of C. botulinum neurotoxin genes showed that the A5
neurotoxin sub-type was a close relative of the A1 subtype, which implied a similar neurotoxin locus structure.
Therefore to amplify DNA containing the 5' and 3' ends of
the A5 neurotoxin genes a series of PCR primers were
designed that would recognise the cntB gene (encoding

Figure genome analysis of 61 strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes
Whole 1
Whole genome analysis of 61 strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes. Each row of the heatmap represents a strain (indicated at right), and its branch on the dendrogram is coloured according to type of neurotoxin formed (indicated at left of heatmap; spo refers to C. sporogenes). Although lost at this resolution, each microarray probe is represented by
a vertical column within this row, from left to right first the 19 probes for each CDS of ATCC 3502 plasmid pBOT3502, followed by probes for chromosomal CDSs, from CBO3648 to CBO001. The colour of each column in the heatmap is an indicator of test signal over reference (ATCC 3502) signal channel ratio. Yellow columns represent probes which hybridised to both
test and reference isolates equally, those in blue hybridised more strongly to the reference strain, and those in red hybridised
more strongly to the test strain. Microarray features with fluorescent signals lower than 100 units (background noise), plus
those CDSs not represented on the microarray are coloured grey. Distance measurements between 0 and 1.0 are indicated in
the non-linear scale underneath the dendrogram. Clades 1 to 9 (brackets at right), are groups of strains which cluster at a distance measurement value of 0.3. The four main regions of variability (clusters of blue-coloured columns) are CDSs associated
with pBOT3502, the Flagellar Glycosylation Island (FGI), and the two prophages, Φ-CB1 and Φ-CB2 (indicated above heatmap).

NTNH) and the transposase that flank the A1 neurotoxin
gene of ATCC 3502 (CBO0805 and CBO0807 respectively). PCR was performed using 'outward facing' primers
recognising the 3.8 kb sequence combined with these two
sets of primers. PCR products that were of the expected
size were sequenced. All sequencing fragments were
assembled using the ContigExpress programme of the
Vector NTI Advance 10 software package (Invitrogen).
Comparison of the completed A5 neurotoxin gene
sequence with that of published examples of other C. botulinum neurotoxin genes together with phylogenetic tree

construction was carried out using the AlignX programme
of this package. The A5 neurotoxin gene of four strains
associated with UK cases of wound botulism was
sequenced and found to be identical.
Accession Numbers
A representative of the sub-type A5 neurotoxin gene
sequence from wound botulism strain H0 4402 065 was
deposited in GenBank (accession number EU679004).
Microarray data have been deposited with Array Express
(accession number E-MEXP-1637).

Heatmap
Heatmap comparison of CDSs in the Flagellar Glycosylation Island (FGI). Top: See Figure 1 for explanation of heatmap format. Strains are ordered by FGI CDS data; dendrogram and strain names at right are coloured (as for Figure 1) for type
of neurotoxin formed. Filled triangles (bottom of heatmap): approximately 10 CDS intervals (data for some CDSs are absent).
CDSs of FGI-I (CBO2666 – CBO2692) are highly conserved and those of FGI-II (CBO2696 – CBO2729) are less so. Hybridisation profiles divided strains into 6 divisions, numbered at left. Mass of glycans detected by mass spectrometry analysis of FlaA
proteins are symbolized in boxes at left. Strains examined by top down mass spectrometry are marked with a filled triangle.
Top down profiles of flagellin from strains marked with a single asterisk and the complete structure of the posttranslational
modification for strain FE9909ACS (hatch symbol) have been combined with previously published data [31]. Bottom: FGI
sequence comparison of proteolytic C. botulinum strains ATCC 3502 (FGI division 2), top, and Langeland type F (FGI division
3), below, confirms heatmap data. Synteny within FGI-I region (left) contrasts markedly with FGI-II; here ATCC 3502 contains
approximately 20 CDSs not found in Langeland and displays less synteny and homology with the CDSs of the Langeland FGI-II.
Heatmap data show that Langeland FGI contains many of the genes found in FGI-I of ATCC 3502 (yellow columns) while is still
missing a large number of genes found in FGI-II of ATCC 3502 (blue columns).

Results and discussion
Whole genome analysis
The 61 strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes
tested in the present study were selected to represent
diverse origins. They had originally been isolated at different times over a period of more than 80 years, from the
environment (17 strains (including unknowns)) or associated with various forms of botulism (foodborne (20
strains), infant (17 strains), and wound (4 strains)). The

strains were of different toxin types; type A toxin gene (17
strains), type B toxin gene (16 strains), type F toxin gene
(3 strains), dual toxin genes (22 strains), and no toxin
gene (3 strains of C. sporogenes) (Table 1). The CDS content of the 61 test strains was indexed in relation to the
genome of proteolytic C. botulinum strain ATCC 3502
(Figure 1). The dendrogram and heatmap (Figure 1) were
derived from this whole genome analysis, and show that
all the strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes

share a high degree of genetic relatedness (e.g. clustering
distance or branch-lengths in the dendrogram were short
with a high proportion of shared CDSs in the heatmap
(coloured yellow)). Most major branch points in the dendrogram occurred at distance measurements of between
0.20 and 0.44. A distance measurement value of 0.30 separated the 61 strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes into nine clades (excluding ATCC 3502) (Figure
1). The strains did not group together according to the
location, environment, time of isolation, or the type of
botulism with which they were associated (Figure 1). This
lack of grouping probably reflects the wide range of
sources of the strains, and has been reported previously by
workers using other typing methods [8,32]. The predominance of yellow shading in the heatmap indicates that the

11 strains in clades 7 and 8 (Figure 1) were most closely
related to the reference strain (ATCC 3502). For example,
they shared the same FGI. While nine of fourteen type A1
neurotoxin strains (as ATCC 3502) were present in these
two clades, a type B and type F strain were also present.
Indeed, most clades contained strains of more than one
toxin type (or sub-type), and most toxin types (or subtypes) were represented in more than one clade, suggesting that the evolution of the neurotoxin genes has not paralleled that of the remainder of the genetic complement.
For example, clade 3 contains nine type B strains, one type
A1 strain, two type A2 strains, two type F and four type
A5(B) strains (the novel type A5(B) strains are described
below), and clade 9 contained two type B strains and three
C. sporogenes strains (Figure 1), confirming the close rela-

tionship between proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes (e.g. [2,8,14]). Two clades, however, contained
strains of just one toxin type. Clade 4 contained eight
closely-related North American-isolated type A1(B)
strains, and clade 7 comprised seven closely-related type
A1 strains (Figure 1). Clade 5 contained a single strain
(NCTC 2012, Loch Maree) that forms type A3 toxin. Interestingly, other genomic indexing methods (MLST, AFLP,
VNTR) also found this strain to be unique and well separated from other strains of proteolytic C. botulinum
[8,33,34]. In addition to the nine clades identified, further
sub-groupings were identified within each clade, often of
the same toxin type (or sub-type). Some strains appeared
highly similar to each other when compared to the
genome of ATCC 3502. These strains included the three
type Bf strains isolated from two patients and food following a foodborne botulism outbreak in Quebec that
grouped closely together within clade 6, and the four
strains associated with wound botulism in the UK within
clade 3 (Figure 1). Most of the differences in microarray
data between the three type Bf strains were distributed
around the signal channel ratio cut-off point of 0.55, suggesting that these apparent differences may reflect background noise associated with this type of analysis. Indeed,
it is likely that these three Bf strains are identical, as they
were isolated from a pâté and clinical samples from the
same outbreak. On the other hand, the wound botulism
strains showed some clear differences in their genetic con-

tent. Other genomic indexing methods (e.g. MLST, PFGE,
AFLP, VNTR) have given a broadly similar pattern to that
found in the present study, with groups of small numbers
of closely-related strains generally of the same toxin type
grouping together, with several distinct groups for each
toxin type [8,32-34]. There are, however, a number of
interesting anomalies that might be interpreted as evidence for horizontally acquired genetic information, and
therefore worthy of further study, for example the type B
strain 2345 that groups most closely with the C. sporogenes
strains.
It is estimated that the core gene set for all 61 strains of
proteolytic C. botulinum and C. sporogenes tested was 2155
CDSs (Figure 5). This is approximately 63% of the CDSs
of ATCC 3502 represented by probes on the microarray,
and considerably higher than the value of 20% previously
reported for 75 strains of C. difficile [35]. This further confirms the close relationship of proteolytic C. botulinum
and C. sporogenes and indicates that exchange of genetic
information with other species has occurred less frequently than in C. difficile. Apart from the neurotoxin
gene cluster itself, which although significant in terms of
biological impact, represents a very small part of the
genome, four main areas of divergence were identified;
the plasmid (pBOT3502), the flagellar glycosylation
island (FGI) and the two prophages (Figure 1). Together
these account for approximately 4.6% of the DNA (plas-

Core set of CDSs of proteolytic C. botulinum/C. sporogenes. Microarray data were filtered to calculate numbers of
CDSs which were shared by all strains at a given signal channel ratio. A cut-off value of 0.55 (arrows) was chosen as
most appropriate to exclude CDSs that are absent or
diverged from their ATCC 3502 counterparts. From the
plots presented here this ratio value indicates a core set of
2155 CDSs that are shared by all 61 strains tested (filled diamonds), and 3055 CDSs that are shared by all 10 C. botulinum

mid plus chromosome) of ATCC 3502. It was previously
estimated that two type A1 strains shared 95–96% of their
CDSs with ATCC 3502 [14], but the two strains included
in this previous study are now revealed to be very close relatives. Indeed, it was estimated that the core gene set for
the ten closely-related type A1 strains in clades 7 and 8
was 3055 CDSs, equating to 89% of the CDSs of ATCC
3502 (Figure 5).
Additionally, two strains of non-proteolytic C. botulinum
type E were tested, but too many CDSs were either absent
or highly diverged for meaningful data to be derived (data
not shown). It was previously reported that a strain of
non-proteolytic C. botulinum type B and a strain of C. difficile were also too divergent to give a meaningful
response on this microarray [14]. The poor hybridisation
of DNA from the three strains of non-proteolytic C. botulinum to the microarray reflects the wide evolutionary and
phylogenetic distance between proteolytic C. botulinum
and non-proteolytic C. botulinum. This is a direct result of
the species "C. botulinum" being defined not on the basis
of a close evolutionary or phylogenetic relationship, but
on the basis of the disease caused [3].
Neurotoxin cluster arrangement – Single toxin gene strains
The type A1 neurotoxin gene is normally present in the ha
plus/orf-X minus type cluster, while the ha minus/orf-X
plus cluster is more commonly associated with type A2,

A3, A4 and F neurotoxin genes [9,36,37]. Twelve of the
fourteen type A1 neurotoxin strains tested contained the
ha plus/orf-X minus cluster, but in two strains (F9604A
and MUL0109ASA) the type A1 neurotoxin gene appears
to be in a ha minus/orf-X plus cluster (Figure 6). This
arrangement has also been recently reported for a small
number of other type A1 strains [18,38]. In the present
study, the genes (p47, orf-X1, orf-X2, orf-X3 and lycA) that
are only present in the ha minus/orf-X plus cluster were
always present together (26 strains), with no strain possessing only part of this cluster. The neurotoxin gene of
the two type A2 strains (NCTC 9837 and ZK3) and one
type A3 strain (NCTC 2012 – Loch Maree) was also
present in a ha minus/orf-X plus cluster (Figure 6), as
expected [9,13,18,37]. Although the two type A1 ha
minus/orf-X plus strains (F9604A and MUL0109ASA) had
the same neurotoxin cluster as the type A2 and A3 neurotoxin-forming strains (Figure 6), they were in different
clades well separated from each other and from the other
type A1 neurotoxin-forming strains (Figure 1). Instead
these two type A1 ha minus/orf-X plus strains grouped
with a type Ba strain (CDC 657) (Figure 1, clade 6). The
type A neurotoxin gene in strain CDC 657 (type A4) is
also in a ha minus/orf-X plus cluster [9]. Since previous
studies using AFLP, MLST and MVLA have shown two
other closely-related type A1 ha minus/orf-X plus strains
(CDC 297 and CDC 5328) also grouped with strain CDC
657 [8,33,34,38], it is likely that the four type A1 ha
minus/orf-X plus strains are closely related. Strain CDC
657 may have recently acquired a type B neurotoxin gene,
or the type A1 ha minus/orf-X plus strains may have lost a
type B neurotoxin gene. It is noted that the neurotoxin
genes in CDC 657 are present on a plasmid, while the type
A gene in at least one type A1 ha minus/orf-X plus strain
(CDC 5328) is located on the chromosome [39].
The 16 type B strains gave an almost identical hybridisation pattern, with all neurotoxin genes present in a ha
plus/orf-X minus cluster (Figure 6). This is consistent with
previous reports [9,12]. Strain MRB had a weak signal for
cntB (encoding NTNH), this may reflect the mosaic structure of cntB, and a previous genetic crossover event
between two types of neurotoxin gene cluster [2,9,40].
The three type F strains gave a ha minus/orf-X plus pattern
(Figure 6), an arrangement consistent with that reported
in the genome sequence for strain Langeland (CDSs
CLI_0845 to CLI_0850). However, while strains Langeland and Walls 8G grouped together in the whole genome
analysis (Figure 1, clade 3), strain H461297F grouped
with type A1 strains, providing further evidence that the
neurotoxin gene clusters are not evolutionarily tied to
their host organism [8,9,13].

lation of the neurotoxin genes [9,13]. The probe designed
to be specific for cntR/A1 gave a positive result with all
strains that possessed a neurotoxin gene in a ha plus/orfX minus cluster (Figure 6). Similarly the probe designed to
be specific for cntR/F gave a positive result with all strains
that possessed a neurotoxin gene in a ha minus/orf-X plus
cluster (Figure 6). The type of neurotoxin regulatory gene
(cntR) present, therefore, is entirely in accordance with the
type of neurotoxin gene cluster, but not with the type of
neurotoxin gene.
Neurotoxin cluster arrangement – Dual toxin gene strains
Twenty-two strains tested in the present study possessed
two distinct neurotoxin genes. Fourteen of the dual gene
toxin strains possessed a type A1 and type B neurotoxin
gene. Two of these strains (CDC 657 and CDC 588) form
both neurotoxins, albeit in different proportions, while
the other 12 strains appear to form only type A neurotoxin
(Figure 6). All these 14 strains gave an identical response
in that they possessed complete ha plus/orf-X minus and
ha minus/orf-X plus clusters. The microarray data cannot
distinguish between dual toxin gene strains which carry a
type A1 toxin gene in a ha minus/orf-X plus cluster, and a
type B gene in a ha plus/orf-X minus cluster or vice-versa.
However, as all type B neurotoxin genes have been associated with a ha plus/orf-X minus cluster (Figure 6; [9,12]),
the simplest explanation is that the dual toxin gene strains
are in the former arrangement. This has been reported in
strains NCTC 2916 and CDC 657 [9,36,41] and from a
preliminary analysis of strains NCTC 11199, MDa10, 667
and CDC 588 [18,41]. The four strains that formed both
type B and type F toxin showed a similar hybridisation
profile to the A1(B) strains except that they possessed a
type F toxin gene rather than a type A toxin gene. Again
both the full ha plus/orf-X minus and ha minus/orf-X plus
clusters are present (Figure 6). It is likely that these strains
possess a type F gene in a ha minus/orf-X plus cluster, plus
a type B gene in a ha plus/orf-X minus cluster. This
hypothesis is supported by (i) this is the pattern found in
strains forming either type B or type F toxin, (ii) such an

arrangement was indicated by a preliminary analysis of
strain CDC 3281 [42], and (iii) was reported for a recently
sequenced
unnamed
Bf
strain
[GenBank:
NZ_ABDP00000000].
Identification of a new toxin sub-type
The present study included four strains of proteolytic C.
botulinum (H0 4244 0055, H0 4402 065, H04464 107, H0
4068 0341) that formed type A neurotoxin, and had been
isolated from patients presenting with wound botulism in
different regions of the UK in 2004. Whole genome analysis revealed that these strains formed a sub-group within
clade 3, distinct from other type A strains. Since the majority of strains forming type A neurotoxin clustered together
within clades 4 or 7, this suggested the possibility that
they might represent an evolutionary distinct group which
could be sufficiently diverged to also produce a novel neurotoxin sub-type (Figure 1). From the DNA sequence of
the entire cntA coding region, a translation product could
be predicted that comprised 1297 amino acid residues of
a type A neurotoxin gene. The cntA/A gene sequences from
all four strains were identical suggesting that these strains
may derive from a common source. Comparison with
published examples of neurotoxin A sub-types revealed
that the wound botulism-derived cntA/A genes were distinct from toxin sub-types A1 – A4 (Figures 7, 8 and 9;
Table 2). Subtypes of cntA are defined by a minimum of
2.6% difference between amino acid sequences [7,10].
The closest relative of the wound botulism-derived cntA/A
gene is the cntA/A1 gene (Table 2), and the new DNA
sequence predicts a 2.9% difference (37 amino acid residues) between the wound botulism-derived cntA/A genes
and the cntA/A1 genes, the latter tending to share approximately 99.8% identity between themselves (see Figures 7
and 8 for an alignment of amino acid sequence of all five
sub-types). On this basis these wound botulism-derived
cntA/A genes define a new sub-type, and should be termed
cntA/A5. Furthermore, the four type A5(B) strains represented the only 'non-A1' neurotoxin-forming strains that
possessed a type A neurotoxin gene in a ha plus/orf-X

Pair-wise comparison of 1296 amino acid residue type A neurotoxins. ATCC 3502, Hall 183, CDC 297, type A1; Kyoto F, type A2; NCTC 2012,
type A3; CDC 657, type A4; H0 4402 065, type A5. Bold figures: percent homology; figures in brackets: number of different residues. Only unique
data are shown; A1 neurotoxins identical to that of strain ATCC 3502 include those of strains NCTC 3805 (62A), NCTC 7272 (ATCC 19397), and
ATCC 25763. The A1 neurotoxin of Hall 183 is identical to that of the A1 (B) strain NCTC 2916. The Kyoto F A2 neurotoxin is identical to that of
the FRI-Honey strain (all sequence data from GenBank). All type A5 neurotoxins described in this study are identical.

minus cluster (Figure 6). Interestingly all four type A5
strains gave a positive signal with the C-terminal type B
probe. Following a combination of DNA sequencing and
PCR analysis, the presence of a near complete type B neurotoxin gene with the 5' end (i.e. N-terminus of protein)
either absent or diverged from previously published
examples was detected (data not shown). As such, these
strains also represent the first published examples of type
A(B) strains that lack the ha minus/orf-X plus cluster for
neurotoxin genes. Since active type B toxin was not
detected in the mouse test, they are designated as type
A5(B). Wound botulism cases in the UK are associated
with heroin abuse [43], and it is likely that the source of
these strains of proteolytic C. botulinum is the same as the
heroin, which comes from Afghanistan [44]. This may
indicate that previously unknown botulinum neurotoxin
types are present in this part of Asia; the majority of published botulinum neurotoxin gene sequences are from
strains originating in Europe or North America.
The amino acid residue differences that distinguish the A5
sub-type from the four other type A sub-types are scattered

throughout its length (Figures 7 and 8; [7-9]). The N-terminal eight amino acid residues are involved in binding
to the neuronal cell plasma membrane [45]. Significantly
the A5 neurotoxin has a leucine at position 2, in contrast
to the usual proline, an amino acid known to cause
marked conformational changes in peptide secondary
structure. The C terminus of the light chain, especially residues 398–448 is important for solubility, stability and
catalysis [46], but only one residue (E444) close to the
protease nicking site differs in this region. Similarly, of the
heavy chain residues that are proposed to build the lactose
and sialyllactose-binding pockets needed for ganglioside
binding [47], only L1278 has been changed (to an F). It is
tempting to predict from this in silico study that the gene
product of cntA/A5 will share a similar toxicity to that of
cntA/A1, although the fact that at least three residues
known to be functionally important are different may
have important implications.
Relationship to C. sporogenes
The type B toxin producing strain 2345 had a weak signal
for all four neurotoxin-associated probes (Figure 6), and
Page 14 of 18

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:115

also groups together with the three C. sporogenes strains in
the whole genome analysis (Figure 1). These observations
support a hypothesis that strain 2345 may represent a
strain of C. sporogenes which has recently acquired part of
the (or a diverged but intact) neurotoxin gene cluster in
the recent evolutionary past. Interestingly, two of the three
C. sporogenes strains, which were expected to be completely negative for all neurotoxin-associated probes, gave
a weak signal to the cntR/A1 probe (Figure 6). This could
be due to the presence of a distantly related or partial cntR
gene, implying that these C. sporogenes strains may either
represent a descendent of C. botulinum that have lost most
of their ha plus/orf-X minus neurotoxin gene cluster, or
may have acquired a neurotoxin gene cluster by horizontal gene transfer (as postulated for strain 2345), but then
subsequently lost most of it. Although not the same strain
as the three used in this work, BLAST searches of the predicted peptides of the (unfinished) C. sporogenes strain
ATCC 15579 genome sequence showed that of several
proteolytic C. botulinum examples of this gene (and one
non-proteolytic C. botulinum example, that of strain
Eklund 17B), CntR of ATCC 3502 gave the highest percentage identity (48%) over the longest unbroken stretch
of peptide sequence. Whereas this tends to support the
microarray data, the stretch of sequence was only 27
amino acid residues in length, so genome sequence analysis of more C. sporogenes strains would be needed to further investigate this interesting observation.
Evolution of neurotoxin genes in relationship to the
genome
It is evident that in strains of proteolytic C. botulinum, the
distribution of neurotoxin genes and neurotoxin cluster
type are not consistent with the whole genome analysis
(Figure 6, Figure 1). This is consistent with previous
reports by other genomic indexing methods (e.g. 16S rrn,
PFGE, AFLP, MLST [2,8,32,33]). The evolutionary patterns of neurotoxin and associated genes within the neurotoxin cluster are also incompatible, and are likely to
have arisen from several distinct recombination events.
For example, the present study has confirmed earlier
reports [18,38] that in type A1 strains, the neurotoxin
genes may be located in a ha plus/orf-X minus cluster or
in a ha minus/orf-X plus cluster. It was also found that the
cntR gene correlated with neurotoxin cluster type, rather
than neurotoxin gene. Previous reports have identified
that NTNH-encoding genes also correlated with neurotoxin cluster type rather than neurotoxin gene, and that
the middle of the NTNH gene may be a hot-spot for
recombination events within the neurotoxin cluster
[2,9,13]. Putative insertion sequence (IS) elements
located close to the neurotoxin cluster and the localisation
of neurotoxin genes on large plasmids may also have
played a role in mobilisation and gene transfer of neurotoxin and associated genes [9,39].

Flagellar glycosylation island (FGI)
Microarray analysis of the CDSs within the FGI separated
strains into six divisions. Divisions 1 and 2 had similar
profiles, with division 1 missing some CDSs contained
within FGI-II. Divisions 3–6 were all missing large sections of FGI-II, with division 5 also missing CDSs within
FGI-I (Figure 2). The structure of these divisions indicates
that, as seen for the neurotoxin cluster genes, the evolution of the FGI may have occurred independently of the
remainder of the genetic complement, with most divisions containing strains of more than one toxin type and
from more than one clade. Divisions 1–3 each contained
strains of at least four toxin types (or sub-types) that
belonged to three or more clades, while division 4 contained only type B strains from clade 3, and division 5
comprised only the strains in clade 9 (type B and C. sporogenes strains). Division 6 contained just one strain, 17A.
The genetic variation highlighted by these divisions (Figure 2) forms the basis for a typing method for proteolytic
C. botulinum [29].

The genetic repertoire of the FGI indicated by the microarray analysis suggested that the glycan biosynthetic capacity of these C. botulinum strains may vary (Figure 2).
Indeed, it has been shown that strains differ in their FlaA
glycan structure, and it is proposed that FGI-II is involved
in this process [29,31]. Flagellin proteins were isolated
from representative strains in each division to determine
the nature of the glycan produced and its correlation with
FGI microarray profiles. Top down MS analysis of intact
flagellin protein revealed diversity in glycan composition
amongst isolates [30,31]; the masses of which are shown
in Figure 2. Flagellin from the majority of strains in division 1 harboured a glycan oxonium ion at m/z 259. Further characterisation of this glycan by MS/MS showed
fragmentation ions at m/z 200.1, 182.1, 158.1, 154.1,
126.1 and 112.1, characteristic of a di-N-acetylhexuronic
acid, previously identified as part of a trisaccharide modification on Methanococcus voltae flagellin [48]. Many of the
flagellins of division 2 strains carried a glycan oxonium
ion at m/z 301. The MS/MS spectrum of this ion also
shared fragmentation ions with a di-N-acetylhexuronic
acid, but with the increased mass likely to correspond to
the addition of a third acetyl group (data not shown). A
glycan oxonium ion at m/z 418 was detected as the FlaA
modification on all division 3 strains examined. This FlaA
glycan has been fully characterized in strain FE9909ACS
as a novel legionaminic acid derivative, Leg5Ac7NMeGlu
[31]. Strains 920A276 and CDC 15044 from division 4
possessed flagellins with glycan oxonium ions at m/z 417
and 431, which shared glycan oxonium ion fragmentation patterns typical of nonulosonic acid sugars (data not
shown). The flagellin of the division 5 strain FE0507BLP
had a glycan oxonium ion at m/z 317, which had the characteristic MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the nonu-

losonic acid sugars pseudaminic and legionaminic acid
(data not shown). These sugars have been structurally
characterised from the flagellins of Campylobacter jejuni
[49], Campylobacter coli [50] and Helicobacter pylori [51].
Taken together, these observations show that differences
in the FGI microarray profiles may be reflected in the mass
of glycan oxonium ions that modify the flagellin. Interestingly, top down mass spectrometry analysis of FlaA from
strain 17A did not produce any marker ions characteristic
of glycan, although the mass of the protein is greater than
could be predicted from its DNA sequence. This indicates
that it too is probably post-translationally modified [29].
In this case a 'bottom up' mass spectrometry analysis of
flagellar tryptic peptides may be required to identify the
glycan moiety.
A representative of division 3, which appears to produce
the novel legionaminic acid derivative, Leg5Ac7NMeGlu,
is the type F strain Langeland, the genome of which has
been recently sequenced. Comparison of FGI sequences of
both Langeland and ATCC 3502 showed that CDSs of
FGI-I shared at least 80% identity, while FGI-II was highly
divergent and was 30 kb smaller in strain Langeland (Figure 2). Homologues to the biosynthetic genes for legionaminic acid synthesis in Campylobacter coli have been
identified in the FGI-II region of the Langeland genome
[31]. The definitive confirmation that CDSs in FGI-II are
responsible for biosynthesis of the glycan found on C. botulinum strain Langeland FlaA, however, awaits further
genetic analysis.
Previously, nonulosonic acid sugars such as legionaminic
acid and pseudaminic acid have been identified as the
post-translational modification of flagellins in the Gramnegative gastrointestinal pathogens, Campylobacter and
Helicobacter [52]. In these bacteria, the glycosylation of the
flagellin is essential for filament assembly and glycan
modifications have been shown to play a role in pathogenesis [53,54]. The presence of nonulosonic acid sugars
in numerous strains of C. botulinum may have an important bearing on its ability to establish a gut infection and
thereby cause infant or adult intestinal botulism.
Although the present study has not correlated the distribution of specific flagellin glycan modifications with the
type of botulism caused, this property may enable a strain
to bring about infant/adult intestinal botulism at a lower
infectious dose than that of strains lacking these flagellin
modifications. A comparative genomic analysis of Campylobacter jejuni identified distinct distributions of flagellar
glycosylation genes (cj1321–cj1326) that were present
only in strains associated with colonisation of livestock
[53]. The hypothesis was developed that the type of flagellar glycosylation genes in Campylobacter jejuni strains
conferred a survival advantage to these strains within livestock, offering a possible explanation for the host specificity of some Campylobacter jejuni strains. It remains to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/115

established whether diversity in flagellar glycan biosynthetic capacity in C. botulinum is similarly related to host
specificity and the colonization ability of isolates.

Conclusion
The most important aspects of the biology and evolution
of proteolytic C. botulinum have been highlighted by this
study, particularly in relation to the neurotoxin and its
associated cluster and the FGI. The close relationship with
C. sporogenes, and very distant relationship with non-proteolytic C. botulinum have been confirmed. Proteolytic C.
botulinum and non-proteolytic C. botulinum are phylogenetically distinct organisms that coincidentally share type
B and type F neurotoxin genes. These genes are of such
sequence similarity as to obviously share a recent common ancestor, and appear therefore to have crossed the
species barrier. Intriguingly, type A and type E neurotoxin
genes seem to be mutually exclusive and are each
restricted to just one of these species. The genome of proteolytic C. botulinum appears to be relatively stable, and
strains sequenced to date display a high degree of synteny
(data not shown). There are, however, variable regions,
and we have presented evidence for the independent horizontal transfer of genes encoding the neurotoxin cluster
and FGI, compared to the remainder of the genetic complement. Transfer of neurotoxin and associated genes may
be associated with a hot-spot for recombination within
the NTNH, closely associated IS elements, and plasmids.
Further investigations of unexpected toxin or FGI types
within clades may be particularly interesting, and reveal
more about the acquisition or loss of genetic material. For
example, while most type A1 strains grouped together
according to whole genome and FGI analysis, four
appeared to be distinct. Two of these type A1 strains,
FE9604A and MUL0109ASA were closely related to each
other, with the toxin gene in a ha minus/orf-X plus cluster.
Strains 17A and 96A were both ha plus/orf-X minus
strains, but appear to be different to each other and all the
other type A1 strains by whole genome and FGI analysis.
Interestingly, strain 96A was also well separated from
other type A1 strains by PFGE [32]. The sequencing of further strains (which is rapidly becoming affordable for
most laboratories) is a particularly attractive way forward,
as unlike microarray analysis, which can only highlight
CDSs that are present or absent in a test strain, it will provide information not only on what has been inserted or
lost, but where on the genome this has taken place.
Indeed the genomes of several of the strains used in this
study have recently been sequenced, and those with
slightly larger genomes typically also carry approximately
300–600 novel genes with respect to the ATCC 3502
strain used as a reference in this work (data not shown).
A number of typing tools have been used for the molecular characterisation of proteolytic C. botulinum. Some (e.g.
ribotyping, 16S rrn sequencing) can be used to identify

the organism, but are not particularly effective at discriminating between strains [8,55]. Others (e.g. PFGE, MLST,
AFLP, VNTR, fla sequencing, DNA microarrays) are able to
discriminate between strains [8,14,29,32-34]. The present
study and previous work [14] have demonstrated that
comparative genomic indexing using a DNA microarray
based on the genome sequence of ATCC 3502 is an effective tool to discriminate strains of proteolytic C. botulinum. Advantages of microarrays are that they can infer
evolutionary relationships better than single/multi-locus
methods and additionally provide valuable information
on the genome content of tested strains, thereby providing an insight into the biology and evolution of the organism. The present microarray is suitable for the forensic
analysis of strains of proteolytic C. botulinum, including
investigations of bioterrorism associated events. A second
generation DNA microarray could be developed for this
purpose based on the variable regions identified between
a number of sequenced strains, and utilise printed rather
than spotted microarrays.
