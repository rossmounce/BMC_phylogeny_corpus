Abstract
Background: In this study we successfully created a new approach to ART in SIVmac251 infected nonhuman
primates. This drug regimen is entirely based on drugs affecting the pre-integration stages of replication and
consists of only two nucleotidic/nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Nt/NRTIs) and raltegravir, a promising
new drug belonging to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) class.
Results: In acutely infected human lymphoid CD4+ T-cell lines MT-4 and CEMx174, SIVmac251 replication was
efficiently inhibited by raltegravir, which showed an EC90 in the low nanomolar range. This result was confirmed in
primary macaque PBMCs and enriched CD4+ T cell fractions. In vivo monotherapy with raltegravir for only ten days
resulted in reproducible decreases in viral load in two different groups of animals. When emtricitabine (FTC) and
tenofovir (PMPA) were added to treatment, undetectable viral load was reached in two weeks, and a parallel
increase in CD4 counts was observed. In contrast, the levels of proviral DNA did not change significantly during
the treatment period, thus showing persistence of this lentiviral reservoir during therapy.
Conclusions: In line with the high conservation of the three main amino acids Y143, Q148 and N155 (responsible
for raltegravir binding) and molecular docking simulations showing similar binding modes of raltegravir at the
SIVmac251 and HIV-1 IN active sites, raltegravir is capable of inhibiting SIVmac251 replication both in tissue culture
and in vivo. This finding may help to develop effective ART regimens for the simian AIDS model entirely based on
drugs adopted for treatment in humans. This ART-treated AIDS nonhuman primate model could be employed to
find possible strategies for virus eradication from the body.

Background
Integration of proviral DNA into the host’s genome is a
fundamental step in lentiviral infections, initiating the
latency period, and allowing the virus to exploit the cellular transcriptional and translational machinery [1,2].
The recent approval of the integrase strand transfer
inhibitor (INSTI) raltegravir for first-line HIV-1 therapy

thus provides a further option for treatment of drugnaïve HIV-1 infected patients [3]. INSTIs selectively
inhibit the strand transfer reaction, catalyzed by HIV-1
integrase (IN) after 3’ processing, which generates a
reactive 3’-hydroxylgroup in proviral DNA. Raltegravir
represents a major success in the history of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is the result of a drug development process which encountered exceptional difficulties
[1,4,5].
Despite this and other major successes in antiretroviral drug discovery and the availability of several drug

options for obtaining sustained suppression of viral load
in HIV-1 infected individuals, ART cannot eradicate the
virus from the body [6], at least in a reasonable time [7].
The grounds for HIV-1 persistence during therapy lie in
the presence of long-lived viral reservoirs (mainly the
memory T CD4 + cell subset), which harbour silent
copies of proviral DNA that cannot be targeted by drugs
or the immune system [6,8,9]. Alternative/complementary strategies are therefore being actively researched, in
order to facilitate the purging of HIV-1 from reservoirs.
To this end, the so-called “shock and kill” strategies
have been proposed [8,10]. These strategies should
induce, through drugs, HIV-1 activation from quiescence (i.e. the “shock” phase), in the presence of ART
(to block viral spread), followed by the elimination of
infected cells (i.e. the “kill” phase), through either natural means (e.g. immune response, viral cytopathogenicity) or artificial means (e.g. drugs).
One major obstacle which has been encountered by
the studies on such “HIV-1 purging” strategies is the
availability of reliable animal models. Such models
should mimic the long-term effects of ART in humans.
Interesting low-cost models include the new SCID mice
technology [11] and feline immunodeficiency virus
(FIV)-infected cats [12,13]; however, the macaque AIDS
model has encountered the largest consensus in the
AIDS researchers’ community. This model is based on
lentiviruses derived from African sooty mangabeys introduced into the non-natural host, Asian macaque species
(Macaca sp.), which results in the development of illness
similar to that described in AIDS patients [14]. Recently,
also chimpanzees were found to develop disease when
naturally infected with SIVcpz, the ancestor of HIV-1
group M [15]. However, the close phylogenetic relationships with humans restrict the use of these apes in the
laboratory.
The simian AIDS model presents its own profile of
response to HIV-1 drugs, rendering it difficult to treat
with the ART protocols adopted for treatment of HIV1/AIDS. For example, SIVmac251, one of the most commonly adopted viral strains for laboratory infection of
macaques, is fully sensitive to nucleotidic and nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs/NRTIs),
retains limited sensitivity to some, but not all of the
protease inhibitors (PIs) designed for HIV-1, and shows
approximately 200-fold less sensitive to non-nucleosidic
reverse transcriptase inhibitors [16]. Treatment with
NtRTI tenofovir (also referred to as PMPA) and NRTI
emtricitabine (FTC) represents a valuable option for
studying the gene expression profiles activated during
suppression of viral load and immune restoration [17].
However, this type of treatment can hardly be used to
model long-term lentiviral persistence during ARTs
designed for humans, which comprise three or more

active drugs and at least two drug targets. The poor
response of the laboratory simian lentiviruses to
NNRTIs prompted some to replace the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of the simian lentivirus with a gene
encoding HIV-1 RT [18]. This substitution is extremely
useful for studying the occurrence of drug resistance
mutations in vivo [19], and for preclinical testing of
novel NRTIs. However, an impact of the RT substitution
on the natural history of the disease cannot be excluded
so far. Indeed, apart from altering immunogenicity,
replacement of a simian lentivirus’s RT with its counterpart from HIV-1 might alter susceptibility of some cell
populations to the virus. For example, RT-bound, elongating proviral DNA is the substrate of APOBEC3G, a
species-specific cellular restriction factor to infection by
primate lentiviruses [14]. Upon clarification of these
issues, this simian/human immunodeficiency virus
(SHIV) chimera could become an extremely useful tool
to model ART consisting of two Nt/NRTIs and an
NNRTI [20], a commonly adopted regimen for first-line
treatment of HIV-1/AIDS.
New strategies for treatment of the macaque AIDS
model may exploit the novel INSTI drug class. Hazuda
et al. [21] evaluated, in SHIV 89.6P-infected rhesus nonhuman primates, the effects of naphthyridine carboxamide, L-870,812, an INSTI belonging to a chemical class
distinct from that of raltegravir. This study provided the
first proof of concept for an antiretroviral effect of IN
inhibition in vivo. Moreover, L-870,812 monotherapy of
macaques allowed the isolation of drug-resistant viruses
presenting the N155H mutation, which later proved an
important drug resistance mutation in HIV-1-infected
individuals failing raltegravir-based regimes [22]. On this
basis, an ART-treated nonhuman primate model was
recently developed by Dinoso et al. using L-870,812 in
combination with PMPAand two PIs, i.e. saquinavir and
atazanavir in macaques infected simultaneously with
SIV/17E-Fr and SIV/Delta B670 [23]. Sustained suppression of viral load was obtained until the end of followup. However, one limitation of this model is that this
type of drug regimen is not adopted in humans. Moreover, the authors used two PIs at a relative dosage much
higher than that adopted for humans.
The susceptibility of non-human primate lentiviruses
to naphthyridine carboxamides is probably due to the
high level of conservation of IN CCDs [12]. A threedimensional (3D) structure [PDB: 1C6V] is available for
the catalytic core domain (CCD) and C-terminal domain
of the IN of SIVmac251 [24]. SIVmac251 IN catalyses
reactions similar to those of HIV-1 IN, and the crystal
structure shows that the IN of SIVmac251 shares the
highly conserved three-dimensional (3D) architecture of
retroviral INs [see Additional file 1] [24]. Accordingly,
SIVmac251 has been reported to be susceptible also to

the investigational HIV-1 INSTI, CHI/1043, belonging
to the 1H-benzylindole drug class [25]. Despite this bulk
of evidence, response of SIVmac251 to raltegravir has
not yet been studied in detail. An extension of the data
from other INSTI classes to raltegravir may not be
obvious, because different classes of INSTIs may have
different binding modes, as shown by the partially overlapping yet different drug resistance mutation profiles
and molecular docking calculations [26,27].
The assessment of the response of a simian lentivirus
laboratory strain to raltegravir may have important
repercussions on the development of antiretroviral
therapies for the simian AIDS model using a drug combination adopted in humans. Moreover, the response of
a non-human lentivirus to this drug may furnish important insights into the requirements for susceptibility to
this new and important drug class.

Results
Raltegravir inhibits SIVmac251 replication in tissue
culture

To test susceptibility of SIVmac251 to raltegravir, MT-4
cells were infected with SIVmac251, washed and incubated with decreasing raltegravir concentrations.
Response to raltegravir was assessed by the widely validated MTT assay, when the majority of cells in the
untreated controls were dead, i.e., approx. fifteen days
post-infection. Results showed that raltegravir inhibited
SIVmac251 replication in the low nanomolar range (Fig.
1A). The EC50 was approximately one order of magnitude lower than that obtained using HIV-1 IIIB, which
was calculated on the basis of data collected at five days
post-infection due to the more rapid kinetics of viral
cytopathogenicity (Fig. 1A). Data from HIV-2(strain:
CDC 77618 [28])-infected MT-4 cell cultures showed

EC90, and EC95) are presented (means ± SEM from at least two independent experiments) for inhibition of: lentiviral cythopathogenicity in MT-4
cells (Panel A), viral core antigen release in supernatants of acutely infected MT-4 cells (Panel B), syncytium formation in acutely infected
CEMx174 cells (Panel C), viral core antigen release in supernatants of acutely SIVmac251-infected rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) and enriched CD4+ T-cell fractions (Panel D). In panel A, the inhibitory concentrations were determined by the methyl tetrazolium (MTT)
method when the majority of control infected cells (in the absence of drug treatment) were dead at light microscopy examination. In panel B,
values were derived by quantifying, using antigen-capture ELISA assays, SIVmac251 p27 and HIV-1 p24 in supernatants from five-day old cultures.
In panel C, values were calculated on the basis of the numbers of syncytia per well at five days post-infection, Syncytia were counted in
triplicate on three different occasions by light microscopy. In panel D, values are representative for supernatants of primary cells from three
different donors at Day 5 post-infection.

intermediate characteristics between those obtained
from SIVmac251- and HIV-1-infected cultures. Apart
from being phylogenetically closer to SIVmac251 than
to HIV-1, the HIV-2 strain that we used killed the
majority of the infected cells in eight days following
infection, thus showing viral cytopathogenicity kinetics
slower than HIV-1 and more rapid than SIVmac251.
To assess whether the difference in the EC 50 values
for SIVmac251 and HIV-1 IIIB cytopathic effects were
attributable to the different kinetics of viral cytopathogenicity, we measured, by antigen-capture ELISA assays,
the viral core antigen in supernatants collected at five
days post-infection from both the SIVmac251 and HIV1 infected cell cultures. In this case, the ranges of the
EC50 values for SIVmac251 and HIV-1 obtained in the
different experimental set-ups were overlapping (Fig.
1B). We concluded that raltegravir inhibits SIVmac251
replication in human T-cell lines with similar potency as
shown against HIV-1.
As different types of kits had to be used to compare
inhibition of SIVmac251 p27 and HIV-1 p24 production,
we decided to confirm the results using another method
allowing simultaneous and homogeneous measurements
of antiviral efficacy against SIVmac251, HIV-1, and HIV2. We used syncytia counts in CEMx174 cells as a measure of lentiviral replication. SIVmac251 replication
induces syncytia at an earlier time point as compared to
the cytopathic effect induced in MT-4 cells, in which lentiviral replication mostly induces apoptotic and necrotic
cell death [29]. The effectiveness of syncytia counts as a
parameter for detection of the antiretroviral effects was
confirmed by correlation analyses of syncytium formation
and viral core antigen production in the presence of antiretroviral drugs (an example using raltegravir is given in
the additional material [see Additional file 2]). CEMx174
cells were infected with SIVmac251, HIV-1, and HIV-2
viral stocks at the same multiplicity of infection (MOI),
and syncytia were counted by optical microscopy at 4-5
days post-infection. Results confirmed that raltegravir
exerted potent and reproducible anti-SIVmac251 activity
(Fig 1C).
To assess the anti-SIVmac251 effects of raltegravir
under conditions more closely resembling those occurring in vivo, 3 day-old PHA-stimulated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from uninfected rhesus
macaques (Macaca mulatta) were infected with SIVmac251, and viral replication was quantified in supernatants by ELISA at five days post-infection, in order to
allow comparison with the results reported in the previous paragraph. Also in this case, raltegravir displayed
an EC50 in the low nanomolar range (Fig 1D).
To assess the effect of raltegravir in the rhesus CD4+
T cell population, i.e., the main target of SIVmac251
in vivo, we separated the CD4 + T cells from fresh

Page 4 of 19

unstimulated PBMCs using magnetic beads. Flow cytometric analysis of the enriched CD4 + T cell fraction
showed that 94 to 100% of cells expressed the CD4 antigen (data not shown). Cells were PHA-stimulated for
three days, infected with SIVmac251, and, again, viral
replication was quantitated in supernatants by ELISA at
five days post-infection. Again, results confirmed the
potent inhibitory effect of raltegravir (Fig 1D).
We concluded that raltegravir inhibits SIVmac251 in
different tissue culture assays at least with similar
potency as observed in human primary cell-based assays
[30,31]. The EC 95 values are within the mean trough
concentration (142 nM) measured in pharmacokinetic
studies in humans [32].
Raltegravir decreases viral load in SIVmac251-rhesus
macaques and stably maintains suppressed viral loads
when associated with RT inhibitors PMPA and FTC

To confirm susceptibility of SIVmac251 to raltegravir
in vivo, we tested the effects of the drug in six rhesus
macaques with stabilized infection by SIVmac251 (henceforth referred to as Group 1). The macaques had been
challenged with SIVmac251 by either the rectal or vaginal route and were between 5 months and two years
post infections prior to the start of raltegravir treatment.
The macaques were randomized to receive 50 or 100 mg
of raltegravir twice daily with food (bid). Monotherapy
was continued for ten days. At day ten, raltegravir
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in viral
load (P = 0.031, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig. 2A).
The 100 mg treatment subgroup apparently had higher
decreases in viral load than the 50 mg treatment subgroup, although the numbers of animals did not allow
statistical evaluation of differences between subgroups.
Of note, one animal treated with the 100 mg bid
dosage showed an undetectable viral load (detection
threshold: 40 copies of viral RNA ml -1 ). Virological
response to raltegravir was associated with a significant
increase in CD4 counts (P = 0.017, Wilcoxon signed
rank test), detectable in all animals (Fig. 2B). We concluded that raltegravir-treated animals showed viroimmunological improvement.
This group of nonhuman primates had been released
by another study showing that viral loads had been
stable before initiating raltegravir treatment (data not
shown). In the prior study, unfortunately, viral load had
been measured by another technique (NASBA), thus
rendering incorrect a possible statistical comparison
between the historical values and the pre-and post raltegravir treatment values from the present study.
Comparison of the CD4 values after raltegravir monotherapy with historical data derived from flow-cytometric
determination of CD4 numbers was instead possible. The
data available from the time of SIVmac251 inoculations

Figure 2 Effect of raltegravir (RAL), alone and in combination with PMPA and FTC, on viral load (panel A) and CD4 counts (panel B) in
SIVmac251-infected macaques (Group 1). SIVmac251-infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were randomized to receive 50 (marked by
the blue symbols) or 100 (red symbols) mg of raltegravir twice daily with food (bid). Monotherapy was continued for ten days. At day 11,
nonhuman primates treated with 50 mg of raltegravir bid were switched to the 100 mg regimen, and two RT inhibitors, i.e. the NtRTI, tenofovir
(PMPA) and the NRTI emtricitabine (FTC), were added to treatment (henceforth referred to as ART) in all animals. Viral load values positioning on
the dotted line parallel to the x axis should read as undetectable.

showed that the CD4 counts prior to raltegravir treatment had been gradually decreasing, or maintained at
levels lower than pre-inoculation values, as a sign of the
ongoing lentiviral infection [33]. Our results showed that
raltegravir abruptly changed the trends in the CD4
counts (Fig. 2B). For five of the Group 1 animals, it was
possible to make a multiple comparison between values
at ten days prior to treatment start, at Day 0, and Day 10
of raltegravir monotherapy. Repeated-measures ANOVA

reported an extremely significant difference (P = 0.0014).
The CD4 counts post-monotherapy significantly deviated
from values at Day 0 and ten days prior to raltegravir
administration (P < 0.05 in both cases; Bonferroni’s posttest for multiple comparisons), whereas no significant difference was found between values prior to treatment start
and Day 0 (P > 0.05). We concluded that there was a significant association between CD4 rise and raltegravir
treatment.

Lewis et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:21
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/21

At day 11, nonhuman primates treated with 50 mg of
raltegravir bid were switched to the 100 mg regimen (in
order to prevent selection of drug-resistant mutants),
and two RT inhibitors, i.e. the NtRTI, PMPA and the
NRTI FTC, were added to treatment (henceforth
referred to as ART) in all subjects. Results showed that
viral load continued to decrease: an undetectable viral
load was shown by four animals after one week, and by
all study animals after two weeks (Fig. 2A). Viral load
was maintained undetectable until the end of follow-up
(Day 52). In parallel, CD4 counts continued to increase
up to restoration of values at the time of inoculation
(Fig. 2B). We concluded that the ART regimen based on
raltegravir plus PMPA and FTC suppressed viral replication to undetectable levels in nonhuman primates and
restored CD4 counts.
As expected from results in human clinical trials, therapy was well-tolerated from a clinical point of view, and
serum chemistry (kidney and liver enzymes) and hematology values remained within normal limits (data not
shown).
The virological improvement of SIVmac251-infected
animals is significantly associated with raltegravir
treatment

The results in Group 1 nonhuman primates clearly
show that raltegravir, and ART, induced viro-immunological improvement of nonhuman primates with progressing SIVmac251 infection.
To exclude that the viral load decrease observed during raltegravir treatment of Group 1 could be attributed
to random fluctuations of SIVmac251 replication, or by
spontaneous acquisition, by the non human primates, of
the capacity to control viral replication, we treated
another group of non-human primates for which historical data were available using the same technique for
viral load measurement (Group 2). In this group, we
also measured viral load at seven days of treatment, in
order to minimize the effect of time-dependent, spontaneous viral fluctuations on the decrease in viral load.
Fig. 3 clearly shows that no significant changes in viral
load were observable in 166 days in the absence of drug
treatment (P > 0.05, Bonferroni’s post-test following
repeated-measures ANOVA). Viral load, however, did
significantly decrease in only seven days of raltegravir
treatment (P < 0.05). Despite the small number of nonhuman primates enrolled, the P values obtained support
the extreme significance of the anti-SIVmac251 effects
of raltegravir. We concluded that 1) there was significant association between decreased viral load and raltegravir treatment, and that 2) the effects of raltegravir
proved reproducible in two distinct groups of animals.
Again, one non-human primate in Group 2 showed an
undetectable viral load following raltegravir

treatment of SIVmac251-infected animals (Group 2). SIVmac251infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) received 100 mg of
raltegravir twice daily with food (bid). Monotherapy was continued
for ten days. Comparison between pre- and post-raltegravir viral
load measurements was done. Viral load values at Day 0, Day 7 and
Day 10 were compared with viral loads at 27 and 166 days prior to
treatment start. Significant differences (P < 0.05; Bonferroni’s test
following repeated-measures ANOVA; shown in the graph by the
red asterisks) were found between both the values at 166 and 27
days prior to treatment start and the values at Day 7 and Day 10 of
treatment. No significant differences, instead, were found between
the values at 166 days, or 27 days, prior to treatment, and the
values at Day 0. The dashed line parallel to the x axis marks the
detection threshold of the technique adopted.

monotherapy. This animal was the only component of
Group 2 to show a low viral load (i.e., 1,520 copies/ml)
before treatment was initiated. To further support the
contribution of raltegravir treatment to the viral load
decline in this subject, treatment was stopped and viral
load was followed up. Results showed that a rebound in
viral load occurred following treatment suspension
(4,520 viral RNA copies/ml; value at two weeks from
suspension).
SIVmac251 proviral DNA persists during ART in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells of the non-human primates

To evaluate whether copies of SIVmac251 proviral DNA
persisted during ART despite suppression of viral load
to undetectable levels, we measured proviral DNA copy
numbers in PBMCs of the non-human primates prior to
starting dosing and after 52 days of therapy. Results
showed that proviral DNA was maintained stable during
the treatment period analyzed. The difference between
the proviral DNA levels at the two time points analyzed
was not statistically significant (P > 0.05; Wilcoxon

treatment with antiretroviral drugs, and at 52 days of therapy.

maintains stably suppressed SIVmac251 viral load, but
not the proviral DNA, in non-human primates.

Discussion
Susceptibility of SIVmac251 to raltegravir

The results of the present study show that raltegravir
inhibits SIVmac251 replication both in tissue culture
and in vivo. The result is comparable to those of previous susceptibility studies using wild-type HIV-1 and
HIV-2 [25,30] and is supported by similar assays conducted in the present study using HIV-1 and HIV-2 as
positive controls for viral replication inhibition. The
EC50 of raltegravir found by Hombrouck et al. [25] in
the MTT-based assays for HIV-1 IIIB cythopathic effects
is slightly lower than that obtained in the present study.
Differences between our results and those of Hombrouck et al. can be attributed to the differences in the
experimental protocols such as the higher MOI of HIV1 used in the present study. Similarly, the higher EC50
of raltegravir for HIV-2 reported in a previous study of
Roquebert et al. using HIV-2 ROD can be explained by
the fact that these authors adopted a different method
for viral quantification, i.e. a quantitative RT PCR assay
[30]. On the other hand, the range of EC 95 values
obtained in the present study for HIV-1 overlap the
33 nM value reported previously, which became an
acceptable threshold for the trough concentrations of
the drug in pharmacokinetic studies [34].

The lower EC50 of raltegravir for the SIVmac251 cytopathic effect, as compared to that found in HIV-1-based
assays, is likely to be attributed to the viral cytopathogenicity kinetics of SIVmac251 which is slower than
that of HIV-1. Under our assay conditions, SIVmac251
required approximately fifteen days to kill the control
untreated cultures, whereas HIV-1 only took five days.
It is possible to hypothesize that the inhibitory effects of
raltegravir in the SIVmac251-infected MT-4 cells subjected to prolonged treatment exposure is the result of
the sum of the inhibition levels occurring during each of
the multiple rounds of viral replication. When the EC50
was calculated on a viral antigen basis, the resulting
values for SIVmac251 and HIV-1 were closer, because
both sets of measurements were done at five days postinfection. This result is also confirmed by viral antigen
capture assays using supernatants from primary PBMC
and enriched CD4+ cell fractions incubated under similar assay conditions.
Inhibition of SIVmac251 replication in tissue culture is
in line with the declines in viral load obtained by raltegravir monotherapy of SIVmac251-infected non-human
primates. Of course, factors other than drug treatment
may have contributed to the viral load decline observed
during treatment in vivo. For example, it has been
shown that cytotoxic responses contributed to the viral
load decline induced by another INSTI, the naphthyridine carboxamide, L-870,812 [21]. However, these
responses in the absence of raltegravir could hardly control infection, as shown by the analysis of the CD4

counts of one of our study groups prior to treatment
start. In this regard, the graph in Fig. 2B clearly shows
that the nadir of CD4 counts was approximately coincident with Day 0 of raltegravir monotherapy. Subject
M974 (belonging to this group) showed a low viral load
(1,960 RNA copies/ml) at the beginning of treatment.
However, this subject could not be regarded as an élite
controller of the infection, because, prior to raltegravir
administration, it also showed low CD4 counts (173
CD4+ T cells/μl) which increased to 531 units/μl after
10 days of raltegravir monotherapy, and to 778 units/μl
at 52 days of treatment with ART (Fig. 2A). Finally, the
results obtained in another group of five macaques, for
which historical viral load values were available prior to
start of raltegravir treatment, showed that marked
declines in viral loads were stringently associated to the
period of raltegravir monotherapy. These results support
the fundamental contribution of raltegravir administration to the antiretroviral effects. Moreover, after therapy
suspension, a rebound in viral load was evident in an
animal that had shown undetectable levels following raltegravir monotherapy. On the whole, these results show
rapid virological and immunological response associated
with administration of raltegravir in the simian AIDS
model.
Although response to a naphthyridine carboxamide
such as L-870,812 has already been assessed in the
simian AIDS model, the susceptibility to raltegravir of
SIVmac251 is far from obvious. Though mechanistically
identical to L-870,812, raltegravir belongs to an unrelated chemical class, i.e. the N-alkyl-5-hydroxypyrimidinone carboxamides [35]. It has been well established
that there may be discordant resistance between
mechanistically identical INSTI drugs designed for HIV1, and that non-human lentiviral enzymes often show
structural differences to their HIV-1 counterparts
mimicking specific drug resistance mutations [36,37]. In
this context, the in vivo susceptibility of SIVmac251 to a
further INSTI drug such as raltegravir supports the concept that the simian AIDS model responds to more than
one class of INSTIs designed for HIV-1 and encourages
pre-clinical testing of novel INSTIs in SIVmac251infected nonhuman primates.
Structural bases for the raltegravir response

An explanation for SIVmac251 susceptibility to raltegravir may be derived from comparison of the SIVmac251
IN with INSTI-susceptible or resistant HIV-1 INs; and,
conversely, the data provided herein, using SIVmac251,
may furnish novel insights into the understanding of the
raltegravir response of HIV-1. Primary resistance to raltegravir has been associated with three major mutations,
N155H, Q148H/K/R, and Y143H; mutation of any of
these HIV-1 IN amino acids initiates pathways leading

Page 8 of 19

to raltegravir resistance [22,38,39]. These residues are
located around the active site of IN and within interacting distance to raltegravir, as shown by molecular modelling simulations conducted by independent groups
[27,40]. Drug resistance mutations N155H and Q148R
were shown to hamper INSTI binding to HIV-1 IN, by
either decreasing the affinity of IN/proviral DNA complexes for INSTIs (N155H) or affecting assembly of proviral DNA (Q148R) [41]. Secondary mutations reported
for raltegravir are L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138K, G140S/A,
V151I, G163R, I203M, S230R, and D232N [22,38,40].
According to structural alignments of the HIV-1 IN
CCD with published structures of the IN CCDs from
SIVmac251 and other retroviruses with reported profiles
of susceptibility to INSTIs, we found that the amino
acid positions corresponding to Y143, Q148, and N155
are conserved between HIV-1 and SIVmac251 (Fig. 5).
These amino acids are also conserved in HIV-2 IN (susceptible to raltegravir [30]) but are not in prototype
foamy virus (PFV; susceptible to raltegravir but showing
EC 50 values 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the
EC50 for HIV-1 [42]) or Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) IN
(which is not inhibited by INSTIs designed for HIV-1
[26]). Several amino acids are also conserved between
SIVmac251 and HIV-1 at positions susceptible to secondary drug resistance mutations. Among these, conservation of E92 is particularly relevant because, differently
from other secondary resistance mutations, the E92Q
mutation alone is capable to decrease raltegravir susceptibility in the absence of primary resistance mutations [43]. Instead, the amino acid corresponding to
HIV-1 IN E92, is a proline in PFV and a valine in RSV.
Similar to HIV-2, SIVmac251 mimics polymorphisms
at some of the secondary drug resistance positions in
HIV-1 (L74, E138, G163 and I203). Among these, the
only drug resistance mutation mimicked by SIV is
I203M (Fig. 5). This mimicry, however, is shown also by
HIV-2 IN, which, as mentioned above, is fully susceptible to raltegravir. Changes in this position may thus be
irrelevant in the absence of primary drug resistance
mutation Y143R/C [44]. Outside the IN CCD at the site
corresponding to HIV-1 IN S230 (not shown in the
sequence alignment of Fig. 5), SIVmac251 presents a
glycine, which, however, does not mimic the corresponding drug resistance mutation S230R in HIV-1 IN.
Two drug resistance mutations induced by other
INSTIs were shown to confer cross-resistance to raltegravir [43]. T66I is a primary drug resistance mutation
raised by the investigational quinolone INSTI, elvitegravir, and some diketo acids [35,45]. F121Y is a primary
drug resistance mutation for naphthyridine carboxamide
L-870,810 [26]. The amino acids presented by SIVmac251 in these positions strictly correspond to those
found in wild-type HIV-1 and HIV-2 INs (Fig. 5).

SIVmac251 (PDB: 1C6V_A), prototype foamy virus/PFV (PDB: 3DLR_A), and Rous Sarcoma virus/RSV (PDB: 1ASU_A). The sequence
alignment is based on a structural alignment performed using the VAST algorithm. Regions showing significant structural alignment are
presented in blue, with the highly conserved residues shown in red. Above the alignments are shown the mutations found in HIV-1 infected
individuals failing raltegravir-based drug regimens (the green arrows indicate the primary resistance mutations Y143H, Q148H/K/R, and N155H;
black arrows indicate secondary resistance mutations). Other drug resistance mutations induced by other integrase strand transfer inhibitors are
shown below the alignments. The mutations shown by site-directed mutagenesis to confer resistance to raltegravir are underlined. Note that the
structure for HIV-1 subtype B integrase catalytic core domain (PDB: 1BL3_C) presents the secondary drug resistance mutation V151I.

If the known susceptibilities of different lentiviruses to
raltegravir, or other INSTIs, are mapped to a phylogenetic
tree of primate lentivirus IN CCDs (Fig. 6), SIVmac251 IN
clusters with a clade comprising HIV-2 IN, which is distinct from, but adjacent to the cluster of primate lentivirus
INs comprising HIV-1 IN (Fig. 6). A relatively recent common ancestor of HIV-1 and SIVmac251/HIV-2 INs may
explain their common susceptibility to raltegravir. Of note,
conservation of the key amino acids T66, E92, F121, Y143,
G148 and N155 (determining susceptibility to raltegravir)
is shared by all primate lentiviruses analysed and is displayed also by highly divergent primate lentiviruses,
including SIVcol, SIVsyk and the endogenous lentivirus
pSIV, recently identified by Gifford et al. in basal primate
Microcebus murinus [see Additional file 3] and sharing
intermediate characteristics between primate and feline
lentiviruses [46].

If the level of amino acid similarity between SIVmac251 and HIV-1 IN CCDs (calculated by the Swiss
PDB Viewer program) is mapped to a 3D structure of
HIV-1 IN CCD, it may be noted that amino acid identities cluster to the active site of IN, which is involved
in INSTI binding [27,35] (Fig. 7). INSTIs bind at the
interface between the IN active site and proviral DNA
[1,2,47]. Modelling this interaction, however, has
encountered several obstacles in the absence of crystallographic data for HIV-1 IN complexed with INSTIs,
although several theoretical models for INSTI binding
have been published so far [27,35,48-51]. A novel
study using the “induced fit” docking (IFD) approach
allowed conformational changes in the protein and
DNA as well in order to obtain the best accommodation of the ligand [27]. Considering these findings, we
built a SIVmac251 IN-Mg2+-DNA ternary complex as

a target for IFD simulations of raltegravir binding [see
Additional file 4].
Only one IFD pose of raltegravir at the catalytic site of
SIVmac251 (Fig. 7) came out from the IFD protocol,
and it was similar to one of the two conformations of
the drug at the HIV-1 IN catalytic site, as described in
the previous IFD study [27]. This IFD pose clearly
showed raltegravir as an ideal prosecution of the 3’
DNA strand of 3’processed viral DNA, consistently
with the hypothesis [52] that this drug acts as a
nucleotide mimic (Fig. 8A). The three pharmacophoric
oxygens of the drug were engaged in bidentate chelation of the two Mg 2+ ions within the catalytic cavity
(Fig. 8B), while the substituted benzyl group deeply
occupied a pocket mainly defined by IN residues
Q148, E152 and H156, and viral nucleotides dG18,
dC19, dA20, dG24 and dC25, as previously described
in docking simulations at the HIV-1 IN CCD [27] [see
Additional file 5]. Notably, during our docking simulations, the 3’-terminal adenine nucleotide dA20 underwent a dramatic conformational movement in order to
allow insertion of the p-fluorobenzyl between the two
viral DNA strands and a π-π interaction between the
oxadiazole group and the 3’ terminal adenine (Fig. 8B).
It was also observed a possible cation-π interaction

Page 11 of 19

involving one metal ion and the aromatic tail of raltegravir (Fig. 8B).
We then analysed the positions of some key amino acids
determining raltegravir susceptibility in the theoretical
drug/target complex. The raltegravir docked conformations at the SIVmac251 and HIV-1 IN showed the
aforementioned Q148 residue, important for drug susceptibility, as lying in close proximity to the ligand, i.e.
within 2.2 Å (Fig. 8B). In particular, this residue shows
strong van der Waals (vdW) interactions with the inhibitor (data not shown). No close contacts were
observed, however, between N155 and raltegravir in
both docking poses at the SIVmac251 and HIV-1 IN
even if this residue is proximal to the ligand (i.e., within
5.5 Å). A recent study by researchers at Merck showed
that the N155H mutation confers resistance to raltegravir primarily by perturbing the arrangement of active
site Mg 2+ ions, thereby interfering with the chelating
function of the inhibitor, and not by affecting the affinity of the metal or by affecting direct contacts of the
inhibitor with the enzyme [53]. No close contacts were
shown also for the third important amino acid determining susceptibility to raltegravir, i.e. Y143. The Y143
residue, however, showed a close interaction with the 5’
strand of proviral DNA, which in turn is engaged in a

close interaction (within 2.6 Å) with the methyl substituent on the oxadiazole moiety and the benzyl tail of
raltegravir. If this docking pose is correct, it is possible
to hypothesise that Y143 determines raltegravir susceptibility of SIVmac251 by maintaining DNA in a position
allowing optimal drug/DNA interactions. As for the
amino acids uninvolved in primary drug resistance, but
shown to decrease susceptibility to raltegravir when
mutated, F121 of SIVmac251 lies within 3.4 Å from the
ligand, whereas E92 showed a significant shift from its
original position following the IFD simulation (RMSD =
2.64 Å).
We also estimated the Gibb’s binding energy (ΔG) of
raltegravir complexed with SIVmac251 and HIV-1 INs
and found a low percent difference observed between
the two models (i.e. - 5.3%), which was consistent with
the similar binding mode observed (data not shown).
These chemoinformatic simulations support our experimental result showing that SIVmac251 is fully susceptible to raltegravir in tissue culture assays.
A three-drug regimen to model lentiviral persistence
during INSTI-based ART

Susceptibility of SIVmac251 to raltegravir is the basis for
a novel antiretroviral treatment for non-human primates
entirely based on drugs affecting the pre-integration
stages of replication, and consisting of only raltegravir,
and the two RT inhibitors (NtRTIs/NRTIs) PMPA and
FTC. In our experiments, it was difficult to ascertain the
contributions of the two drug classes to the achievement
of an undetectable viral load in non-human primates.
Addition of the NRTIs/NtRTIs to treatment was not
intended to show a further contribution of these drugs
to viral load suppression, since the effects, on SIVmac251, of both PMPA and FTC are well documented
in literature [17]. Rather, PMPA and FTC at an early
time point were obligate additions to therapy, in order
to prevent drug resistance which occurs very frequently
during monotherapy of lentiviral infections.
Since three-drug regimens consisting of raltegravir,
tenofovir (i.e. the active form of PMPA) and FTC have
become a new recommendable option for first-line therapy of HIV-1 as an alternative to NNRTI- or PI-based
regimens, nonhuman primates subjected to this type of
treatment may represent a valid alternative/complementary simian model to recently published models employing an RT-SHIV treated with two NRTIs and an NNRTI
or a combination of two different simian lentiviruses
treated with a mixture of different drugs including two
PIs [20,23,54]. Response to ART was shown in all study
subjects that we recruited, although they had been previously infected by different routes. This observation is
in line with a previous study of ten Haaft et al., who
investigated the effect of route of infection on early

Page 13 of 19

plasma viral RNA load in SIV(mac)-infected macaques.
These authors found no significant difference in plasma
RNA loads among the different routes of infection [55].
If this finding is confirmed in larger numbers, future
studies requiring the ART-treated simian AIDS model
might allow recruitment of nonhuman primates with
extant infections and derived from other studies, e.g.
controls for vaccine experiments, viral titration studies.
This will allow shortening the experimental times and
sparing economic resources and animal lives.
The ART-treated AIDS simian model described in the
present study could be employed for preclinical evaluation of the effects of possible strategies for eliminating
viral reservoirs or the testing of therapeutic vaccines.
For example, an easy and rapid preliminary assessment
of the impact of a candidate eradication strategy could
be conducted by measuring the proviral DNA content
of PBMCs. More sophisticated methods applicable to
this model in order to quantify the effect of a therapy
on lentiviral reservoirs could adopt limiting dilution
techniques to detect the circulating CD4+ T cells harboring replication-competent SIVmac251 or in-situ PCR
from biopsies derived from tissues known to be viral
sanctuaries. Finally, the effects of the candidate eradication therapy or the therapeutic vaccine treatment cycle
could be shown by analyzing viral load rebounds, if any,
after suspension of ART.

Conclusion
We report that raltegravir is capable of inhibiting SIVmac251 replication both in tissue culture and in-vivo.
This finding 1) supports the use of the simian AIDS
models for pre-clinical testing of novel INSTIs for HIV1 and HIV-2, and 2) is a basis for a new and effective
ART regimen for the simian AIDS model entirely based
on drugs adopted for treatment of humans. Our ARTtreated AIDS nonhuman primate model could be
employed to find possible strategies for combating lentiviral latency and eliminating reservoirs in attempts to
eradicate the virus from the body.
Methods
Cells

We used the human MT-4 cells (T-CD4 + cell line
derived from cord lymphocytes transformed with
HTLV-I virus, in which the proviral DNA is heavily
methylated and produces no detectable virus) [56,57].
The CD4+ CEMx174 cell line was also used. Cells were
grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with glutamine (200 mg/ml) (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.
Carlsbad, California), 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine
serum (FBS; Invitrogen Life Technologies), penicillin
(500 U/ml; Pharmacia Italia SPA) and streptomycin
(66.6 U/ml; Bristol-Myers, Sermoneta, LT).

Rhesus PBMCs were Ficoll-separated, resuspended at
a concentration of 10 6 /ml and stimulated for 3 days
with 5 μg/ml phytohaemoagglutinin (Difco Laboratories,
Detroit, MI, USA) and 50 units/ml of human recombinant IL-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
Rhesus CD4 + T-cells were purified using magneticbead-based commercial kits (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany), and then incubated for three days
prior to infection under similar conditions as those
adopted for stimulation of rhesus PBMCs.
Virological assays

SIVmac251, HIV-1 (IIIB) and HIV-2 (CDC 77618)
stocks were from the viroteques of the Italian of Institute of Health (Rome). Cells were infected for 2 h with
the viruses at a multiplicity of infection of, approximately, 0.1, according to a protocol widely validated in
our hands [57,58]. Cells were then washed three times
in phosphate buffered saline, and suspended at 5 × 105/
ml in fresh culture medium (to primary cells 50 units/
ml of IL-2 were added) in 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), in the presence or absence of a range
of triplicate raltegravir concentrations (0.0001-1 μM)
(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Untreated infected and
mock-infected controls were prepared too, in order to
allow comparison of the data derived from the different
treatments. Viral cytopathogeniciy in MT-4 cells was
quantitated by the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) method
(MT-4/MTT assay) when extensive cell death in control
virus-infected cell cultures was detectable microscopically as lack of capacity to re-cluster. The capability of
MT-4 cells to form clusters after infection was assessed
as previously described [57]. Briefly, clusters were disrupted by pipetting; and, after 2 h of incubation at 37°C,
the formation of new clusters was assessed by light
microscopy (100 × magnification). Though not strictly
quantitative, this method is highly sensitive, and has
been repeatedly used in order to detect reproducible
antiviral activity of compounds. Cell culture supernatants were collected for HIV-1 p24 and HIV-2/SIVmac251 p27 core antigen measurement by ELISA
(Innogenetics N.V., Gent, Belgium; Advanced Bioscience
Laboratories, Inc., Kensington, MD). In CEMx174infected cell cultures, which show a propensity to form
syncytia induced by the virus envelope glycoproteins
[58], syncytia were counted, in blinded fashion, by light
microscopy for each well at 5 days following infection.
Nonhuman primate studies
Animals and drug treatments

The Indian Rhesus macaques used in this study were
housed at BIOQUAL, Inc. Rockville, MD, according to
standards and guidelines as set forth in the Animal Welfare Act and The Guide for the Care and Use of

Page 14 of 19

Laboratory Animals, as well as according to animal care
standards deemed acceptable by the Association for the
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care International (AAALAC). All experiments were
performed following institutional animal care and use
committee (IACUC) approval. The macaques were
inoculated mucosally, either intrarectally or intravaginally, with 300 MID50 (50% macaque infectious dose) of
highly pathogenic SIVmac251. All macaques were
infected and reached peak viral loads by week 2 and set
point by week 12. Raltegravir was dosed by the oral
route, either 50 mg/kg/BID or 100 mg/kg/BID.
PMPA [(R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine]
and FTC {5-fluoro-1-(2R,5S)- [2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine} were kindly provided by Gilead
Sciences through a material transfer agreement. Animals
were doses subcutaneously with PMPA, 20 mg/kg/day,
and FTC, 50 mg/kg/day.
Quantitative assay for SIVmac251 viral RNA levels

For measurement of plasma SIVmac251 RNA levels, a
quantitative TaqMan RNA reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.)
was used, which targets a conserved region of gag and
has an accurate detection limit. The sensitivity of the
method is two copies per run, which results in a detection limit as low as 40 RNA copies/ml. The samples
were then amplified according to a method previously
validated in our hands [59,60]. Briefly, a 500-μl aliquot
of plasma was spun down at 13,000 × g for 1 h. The
liquid was poured off and 1 ml of RNA-STAT 60 was
added. After 5 min., 250 μl of chloroform was added
and vortexed. The samples were spun at the same speed
for 60 min. The clear aqueous layer on top was
removed, and added to 500 μl of isopropanol. Then, 10
μl of 10 μg/ml tRNA was added and precipitated overnight at -20°C. The samples were spun for one hour,
washed with a cold (-20°C) 75% ethanol solution, and
re-spun for 60 minutes. The RNA was resuspended in
30 μl of RNAse-free water. 10% of the resuspended
RNA was added to Taqman reagents (Applied Biosystems), plus primers and probe, and amplified in a 7700
Sequence Detection System by Applied Biosystems.
Briefly, the sample was reverse transcribed at 48 degrees
for 30 min. using One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems), then held at 95°C for 10 min., and
run for 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec. and 60°C for 1 min.
The following PCR primer/probes were used: SIV2-U 5’
AGTATGGGCAGCAAATGAAT 3’ (forward primer),
SIV2-D 5’ GGCACTATTGGAGCTAAGAC 3’ (reverse
primer), SIV-P 6FAM-AGATTTGGATTAGCAGAAAGCCTGTTGGA-TAMRA (TaqMan probe). The
signal was finally compared to a standard curve of
known concentrations from 107 down to 1 copy (the linear range of concentration/signal relation spans eight

Logs). All samples were done in triplicate for consistency
and accuracy.

appropriate transformation was done to restore normality, where necessary.

Quantitative assay for SIVmac251 proviral DNA

For proviral DNA detection, cells were spun down to a
pellet, and the supernatant was poured off. The cell
pellet was lysed with 1 ml of DNASTAT for 10 min.
250 μl of chloroform was added and the mixture was
vortexed. The samples were spun at 13,000 for 60 min.
and the aqueous layer was removed and added to
another tube. To this, 500 μl of isopropanol was added,
and the mixture was precipitated overnight at -20°C.
The samples were then spun for one hour and the precipitate was washed with a -20°C-cold, 75% ethanol
solution, and re-spun for 60 min. The DNA pellet was
resuspended in 30 μl of water and 10% of the resulting
solution was added to Taqman reagents (Applied Biosystems) plus primers and probe (the same as in previous paragraph) and amplified in a 7700 Sequence
Detection System by Applied Biosystems. The signal was
finally compared to a standard curve of known concentrations from 10 6 down to 1 copy (the linear range of
concentration/signal relation spans seven Logs). The
detection limit of this assay is two copies of proviral
DNA/5 × 105 cells.
Flow cytometry

Hematology was performed by IDEXX (IDEXX Preclinical Research, West Sacramento, CA). For calculation of
absolute cell numbers, whole blood was stained with
anti-CD3-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/anti-CD4phycoerythrin (PE)/anti-CD8-peridinin chlorophyll a
protein (PerCP)/anti-CD28-allophycocyanin (APC), and
anti-CD2-FITC/anti-CD20-PE, and red blood cells were
lysed using lysing reagent (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, Calif.). Samples were run on a FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Bioinformatic analyses

Structural alignments of the catalytic core domains (IN
CCDs) of lentiviral integrases were retrieved by the
VAST algorithm embedded in the US National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. Cn3D
4.1 (downloadable from the NCBI website) was used to
visualize the superimposed three dimensional (3D)
structures and the structure-based sequence alignments.
The Swiss PDB Viewer (SPDBV) program (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) was used to colour the 3D structures by alignment diversity. Briefly, the a-carbons of
the highly conserved catalytic triads (e.g. D64, D116 and
E152 for HIV-1 IN) were initially superimposed using
the “fit molecules” option. Then, using the “improve fit”
option, SPDBV was asked to minimize the root-mean
square distance (RMSD) between the corresponding
atoms using a least square algorithm. Using the default
matrix embedded in the program (with open and
extended gap penalties of 6 and 4, respectively), the calculation was extended to neighbouring atoms until the
maximum number of aligned atoms with the lowest
RMSD was obtained. Then, the “colour-alignment diversity” option was used. The coloured structures were
then reconstructed manually using Pymol (DeLano
Scientific, Palo Alto, CA), which generates higher-quality
images.
Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Phylogeny.
fr website [62,63], which, following a predefined pathway
using MUSCLE [64], Gblocks [65], PhyML [66] and
TreeDyn [67] outputs the corresponding phylogenetic
tree.
Molecular modeling

Statistical analyses

Data were analysed using the software GraphPad Prism
5.00.288 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). For
calculation of the EC50, EC90and EC95 values, data were
transformed into percentage-of inhibition values, plotted
on x, y graphs, and subjected to linear or non-linear
regression, depending on the best-fitting equation.
The numbers of animals enrolled in each treatment
group were determined using the free-access online calculator for the b-error embedded in the DSS Research
website [61].
For calculation of P values for changes in viral load
and immunological parameters, pre- and post-monotherapy values were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed
rank test. For multiple comparisons at different time
points, data were analyzed by repeated-measures
ANOVA followed by Bonferron’s post test for comparison between the different experimental time points. An

Recently, a HIV-1 IN-Mg2+-DNA model that mimics the
product of 3’ processing has been reported [27,68]. This
complex has now been used as template to build the
analogous SIVmac251 two metal-IN-DNA complex,
starting from the available coordinates of the CCD in
the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Indeed, 1C6V [24] is the
crystal structure of SIVmac251 IN that contains four
core domains (chains A-D) and one C-terminal domain
(chain X); all the CCDs show no metal ions in the catalytic site and have one unresolved region (residues 141151) mostly corresponding to the flexible loop (residues
140-149) adjacent to the active site.
In order to build our model, we used the molecular
modelling package Schrödinger Suite 2007 (Schrödinger,
LLC, New York, NY).
The SIVmac251 IN-Mg2+-DNA ternary complex was
thus developed by superimposing the backbone Ca
atoms of the three catalytic residues in SIVmac251 and

Lewis et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:21
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/21

HIV-1 integrases (D64, D116, and E152); in particular,
we used the chain A of SIVmac251 IN, while chains BD and X were discarded.
The unresolved region in the SIVmac251 CCD was
then computationally completed based on the conformation of the homologous region in HIV-1 CCD. The
coordinates of the two Mg2+ ions and of the viral DNA
in the HIV-1 model were also spliced into the SIVmac251 CCD, leading to a two metal model of IN-DNA
complex. The nucleotide dT14 was manually corrected
to dC14 in line with the cytosine presented in this position by sooty mangabey-derived viruses (GenBank accession: L26023). Examination of the catalytic triad
highlighted that D64 and D116 side chains did not have
the right conformation for favourable interaction with
the Mg2+ ions at the active site; thereby, their geometries were modified to metal-coordinating position.
Before the docking run, the complex was submitted to
Schrödinger’s Protein Preparation Wizard: water molecules were deleted, hydrogen atoms were added, bond
orders and charges were then assigned, the orientation
of hydroxyl groups on Ser, Thr and Tyr, the side chains
of Asn and Gln residues, and the protonation state of
His residues were optimized.
To remove the worst contacts between the parts of this
new structure but not to alter the architecture of the binding site, 100 steps of steepest descent minimization
(OPLS-2005 force field) using GB/SA model [69] as solvation treatment were carried out by freezing the two cations
and the oxygen atom of the 3’OH of adenosine-viral DNA.
The structure of raltegravir was constructed using the
Schrödinger Maestro interface and was then submitted
to Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient minimization
[0.0005 kJ/(Å mol) convergence]. The phenolic oxygen
of the ligand was considered as phenolate given the
influence of the two metal ions in the binding site.
The Induced Fit Docking (IFD) protocol [70] was then
employed in this study to accurately predict ligand binding modes and concomitant structural changes in the
receptor. Briefly, IFD methodology merges the docking
and scoring capabilities of program Glide with a protein
structure prediction and refinement module (Prime) to
generate reasonable binding structures for ligands
known to be active but unable to be docked in an existing structure of the receptor using the rigid approach.
The IFD protocol used in this study was carried out
using the following steps (the description below is from
the IFD manual):
1. Constrained minimization of the receptor (Glide
protein preparation, refinement only) with an RMSD
cutoff of 0.18 Å;
2. Initial Glide docking of each ligand using a softened
potential (van der Waals radii scaling). By default, a
maximum 20 poses per ligand are retained, and by

Page 16 of 19

default, poses to be retained must have a Coulomb-vdW
score <100 and an H-bond score <-0.05;
3. One round of Prime side chain prediction for each
protein/ligand complex, on residues within a given distance of any ligand pose (6 Å in our study);
4. Prime minimization of the same set of residues and
the ligand for each protein-ligand complex pose. The
receptor structure in each pose now reflects an induced
fit to the ligand structure and conformation;
5. Glide redocking of each protein/ligand complex
structure within a specified energy of the lowest-energy
structure (default: 30 kcalmol-1). The ligand is now rigorously docked, using default Glide settings, into the
induced-fit receptor structure;
6. Estimation of the binding energy (IFDScore) for
each output pose.
In our study, all docking calculations were run in the
“Standard Precision” mode of Glide, and the center of the
grid box was defined by the manually selected Mg ions.
The IN/DNA/ligand complex obtained by the IFD
protocol was minimized performing a Polak-Ribiere
conjugate gradient unrestrained minimization [0.005 kJ/
(Å mol) convergence], using the OPLS-2005 force field
[71] and the GB/SA model as solvation treatment [69].
Prime was then used to estimate the free binding
energy (ΔG) of HIV-1 and SIVmac251 INs bound to raltegravir, using the MM-GBSA method [72]; OPLS-2001
was used as all-atom molecular mechanics force field
[71] and GB/SA as solvation treatment [69].
Additional file 1: Structural alignment of the integrase catalytic
core domains (IN CCDs) HIV-1 subtype B (PDB: 1BL3) and
SIVmac251 (PDB: 1C6V). The alignment was conducted on structures
deposited in the NCBI database using the VAST algorithm embedded in
the website. The structures were then visualised using Cn 3D v. 4.1
(available freely from NCBI). The video was created using SnagIt
(TechSmith Corporation Okemos, MI). The HIV-1 and SIVmac251 CCDs are
shown in violet and blue, respectively. The active site is shown by the
highly conserved catalytic residues D64, D116 and E152 (presented in
yellow) and by the Mg2+ ion coordinated by D64 and D116 in the 1BL3
structure. The flexible loop (residues 140-151) is not present in the
alignment, due to its variable conformation that may not correspond to
that adopted in vivo when the IN CCD is complexed with proviral DNA.
The corresponding sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 5.
Additional file 2: Correlation between inhibition of p24 production
and inhibition of syncytium formation in acutely HIV-1-infected
CEMx174 cells. Cells were infected with HIV-1 (IIIB), washed and
incubated for five days in the presence or absence of a range of
concentrations of raltegravir in a 96-well plate. HIV-1 p24 was quantified
in supernatants by commercially available ELISA kits. The numbers of
syncytia per well were determined by light microscopy in blinded
fashion. Data from one representative experiment are shown and
presented as the percentage of inhibition occurring at each of the tested
concentrations of raltegravir. The concentrations to which the different
data points refer are indicated by arrows in the graph. The solid line is
the line best fitting the data points, as calculated by the least-squares
method. Dashed lines mark the 95% confidence limits of the regression
line. Statistical analysis reported an extremely significant correlation
between the percentage-of-inhibition values calculated by the two
different methods (r = 0.98; P = 0.0003; t-test for correlation).
