Abstract
Background: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus type one (HIV-1) is the major causing pathogen
of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). A large number of HIV-1-related studies are
based on three non-human model animals: chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, and mouse. However, the
differences in host-HIV-1 interactions between human and these model organisms have remained
unexplored.
Description: Here we present CAPIH (Comparative Analysis of Protein Interactions for HIV-1),
the first web-based interface to provide comparative information between human and the three
model organisms in the context of host-HIV-1 protein interactions. CAPIH identifies genetic
changes that occur in HIV-1-interacting host proteins. In a total of 1,370 orthologous protein sets,
CAPIH identifies ~86,000 amino acid substitutions, ~21,000 insertions/deletions, and ~33,000
potential post-translational modifications that occur only in one of the four compared species.
CAPIH also provides an interactive interface to display the host-HIV-1 protein interaction
networks, the presence/absence of orthologous proteins in the model organisms in the networks,
the genetic changes that occur in the protein nodes, and the functional domains and potential
protein interaction hot sites that may be affected by the genetic changes. The CAPIH interface is
freely accessible at http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih.
Conclusion: CAPIH exemplifies that large divergences exist in disease-associated proteins
between human and the model animals. Since all of the newly developed medications must be
tested in model animals before entering clinical trials, it is advisable that comparative analyses be
performed to ensure proper translations of animal-based studies. In the case of AIDS, the hostHIV-1 protein interactions apparently have differed to a great extent among the compared species.
An integrated protein network comparison among the four species will probably shed new lights
on AIDS studies.

Background
Cross-species virus infections usually raise serious threats
to worldwide public health. Examples include the
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Avian
Influenza, where viruses cross species boundaries to infect
humans from simians [1], and birds [2], respectively. The
interactions between virus and host proteins are essential
to the completion of virus life cycle, and impact directly
on the pathology of infectious diseases [3-6]. Therefore,
studies of host-virus interactions are critical to understanding of the virology and development of therapeutics
for viral diseases. Since host switching, host specificity,
and disease severity all depend on host-virus interactions,
comparative studies of host-virus interactions may help
unravel the host/viral factors key to these central themes
in infectious disease studies.
As one of the most deadly diseases to humans, AIDS is
barely life-threatening to chimpanzees [7], human's closest relative in the nature. Comparative studies have provided clues to the differential susceptibility to AIDS
between the two species [8-10]. However, since human
and chimpanzee protein sequences are almost identical in
most of the cases [11], the amino acid substitutions that
may lead to Homo-Pan divergences in protein-protein
interactions (PPIs) have remained elusive. Nevertheless, it
is feasible to pinpoint species-specific post-translational
modifications (PTMs), which are known to affect hostvirus protein interactions [12,13] and can be altered by
minor genetic changes such as single nucleotide substitutions or small insertions/deletions (indels). PTMs are pivotal to a wide range of biological processes, including
signal transduction, protein targeting, receptor specificity,
and PPIs [14]. So far, comparative tools for exploring the
potential influences of species-specific PTMs on host-virus
interactions have not been found.
Here we develop a web-based interactive database –
CAPIH (Comparative Analysis of Protein Interactions for
HIV-1) – for comparative studies of genetic differences
between the human proteins involved in host-HIV protein interactions and their orthologues retrieved from
three mammalian species: chimpanzee (Pan troglodyte),
rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), and mouse (Mus musculus). The three latter species are all important animal
models for HIV studies [15-17]. Understanding the differences in host-virus interplay between human and the
model species is the basis for correct interpretation of animal-based HIV studies. Furthermore, by comparing protein interactions between species, one can potentially
identify key differences that underlie chimpanzee resistance to AIDS. To facilitate inter-species comparisons of
host-HIV PPIs, four main functions are provided in
CAPIH. Firstly, the interface shows the presence or
absence of orthologous proteins, thus enabling users to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/164

pinpoint missing protein components in the host-HIV
interaction network. Secondly, the multiple sequence
alignments of orthologous proteins enable users to identify species-specific amino acid substitutions, nucleotide
substitutions, and indels. This information is helpful for
inferring functional changes of orthologous proteins.
Thirdly, predictions of 7 types of species-only PTMs
(phosphorylation, methylation, sumoylation, acetylation, sulfation, N-glycosylation, and O-glycosylation) for
each HIV-interacting host protein are presented for analyses of potential PTM influences on protein interactions
and signal/regulatory pathway. We also collect experimentally verified PTMs in human proteins. Fourthly,
CAPIH shows potential PPI hot sites on the multiple
sequence alignments. Through the visualized interface,
researchers can easily spot multiple host factors that
directly or indirectly interact with the same HIV protein,
and consider how changes in one member protein may
affect the protein interaction network.
Construction and content
CAPIH organization and implementation
The data compiling process is illustrated in Figure 1A. We
retrieved a total of 1,447 HIV-1 interacting human proteins from the HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database [18] (the November 13, 2007 freeze). The humanchimpanzee-macaque-mouse orthologous proteins were
downloaded from the Ensembl genome browser (release
47), which were identified by the Ensembl project using
the Markov clustering algorithm [19]. Note that not all the
retrieved human proteins have orthologues in all of the
three compared species. In the cases of one-to-many/
many-to-many orthologous relationships, only the protein pairs with the reciprocally highest similarity were
selected. All of the protein and nucleotide sequences were
downloaded from Ensembl. Also note that, among the
1,447 retrieved human proteins, 77 proteins had no
Ensembl-identified orthologues in any of the compared
species. The remaining 1,370 orthologous protein groups
were subsequently aligned using the MUSCLE multiple
sequence alignment package [20]. Based on the protein
alignments, the corresponding transcripts were aligned
and separated into 3 types of genomic regions: 3'UTRs,
5'UTRs and coding sequences (CDSs). Since CAPIH aims
to identify species-specific genetic changes (Figure 1B),
only orthologous genes from at least three species were
considered. In this interface, species-specific indels were
identified by using the INDELSCAN Web server [21,22].
Meanwhile, CAPIH shows 7 types of species-specific PTM
sites, which were identified by 7 well-known PTM prediction packages with default parameters (including MEMO
[23], SUMOsp [24], NetOGlyc [25], NetNGlyc, SulfoSite
[26], and NetAcet [27]; Table 1). Considering the relatively low quality of chimpanzee and macaque genomic
sequences, we used the Phred quality score of 25 as a cut-

off to filter out potential false positive predictions. The
quality scores of chimpanzee and macaque genomic
sequences were downloaded from the UCSC genome
browser [28]. In the case of indels, the quality scores of the
15 nucleotides on either side of the indel were averaged.
Whereas in the case of PTMs, 15 nucleotides on either side
(i.e. 5 amino acid residues) plus the three nucleotides of
the PTM-affected amino acid were taken into account. The
potential protein interaction hot sites were identified
using 3D-partner [29].
Since the HIV-human protein interactions encompassed a
wide variety of interaction types, we classified these interactions into 7 major groups based on 65 key phrases from
the HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database: (1)
physical interaction; (2) regulatory interaction; (3) posttranslational modification; (4) transportation; and (5)
positive interaction (6) negative interaction (7) others.
The classification of interaction key phrases can be found
online
at
http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih/key
phrases.php?search_target=keyphrases. Note that these
key phrases are retrieved from different publications. Consequently, a "biological interaction" may be represented
by more than one key phrases. For instance, protein A may
"bind" and "inhibit" protein B. In addition, to extend the
depth of the visualized network, we also incorporated
interactions between human proteins downloaded from
the BIND [30] and HPRD databases [31].
Species-specific genetic changes identified by CAPIH
The numbers of species-specific genetic changes identified
by CAPIH are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Collectively, the
interface has identified more than 86,000, 21,000, and
33,000 species-specific amino acid substitutions, indels,
and PTM events, respectively, in the four species. For lineage-specific PTM events, in general, phosphorylation
account for the largest proportion of all PTM events, followed by glycosylation (O- and N-linked types together),
methylation, sulfation, sumoylation, and lastly by
acetylation (Table 3). We find that rhesus macaque has a
much larger number of species-specific PTM events than
hominoids, whereas human and chimpanzee have
approximately equal numbers. Since the annotations of
chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genes have remained

incomplete, we are conservative about the estimates of the
numbers of species-specific PTMs. For accuracy, we further
exclude the PTM events that occur in indels (including
both lineage- and non-lineage-specific indels), all the
numbers of lineage-specific PTMs are thus decreased dramatically (Table 3). Nevertheless, each of the hominoids
still has more than 950 species-specific PTM events, and
rhesus macaque has ~4,600. This observation is consistent
with the primate phylogeny. Considering that chimpanzee is highly resistant to developing AIDS while the other
two are not, it is of great interest to investigate whether
these PTM events play important roles in AIDS development after HIV-1 infections.
Description of the CAPIH Web interface
The CAPIH interface provides five query schemes: by gene
accession number, gene description, gene ontology, protein domain, and expressing tissue (Figure 2A). Alternatively, the user can also look up the proteins of interest in
the protein table, which includes all the proteins analyzed
in the interface. All the proteins that match the query key
word will be shown with a plus "+" sign in front (Figure
2B). Detailed information of each protein can be shown
by clicking on the "+" sign (Figures. 3 and 4). Note that
the information page of each protein is composed of three
sections ("Genome Comparison Statistics", "Multiple
Sequence Alignments", and "Protein Interactions"). By
default only the first section will be deployed when the
page is shown. The user can deploy the other two sections
by clicking the "+" sign before each section. The user can
further refine the search by submitting a second key word,
or return to the homepage and start a new search. For each
protein of interest, CAPIH shows the statistical pie diagram of species-specific variations in the "Genome Comparison Statistics" section (substitutions in light blue,
indels in purple, and PTMs in green color; Figure 3A). For
substitutions and indels, the diagram gives species-specific variations in amino acid sequences, InterPro-predicted protein domains, CDSs, 3'UTR, and 5' UTR (in the
top-down direction). Each filled block represents 10 variations. That is, 10 nucleotide substitutions (for CDS and
UTRs), amino acid changes (for amino acid and IPR
domains), indels, or PTMs. For example, 12 species-specific changes will be shown as 2 filled blocks in the graph.

However, if the number of species-specific changes
exceeds 40, only 4 filled blocks will be shown (Figure 3A).
Note that nucleotide substitutions in coding regions do
not necessarily cause amino acid substitutions, whereas
indels do. Also note that one indel event may affect more
than one amino acids. Therefore, the total numbers of
indels and nucleotide substitutions in CDS do not necessarily equal the number of amino acid changes.
The interface also provides an alignment viewer using
JalView [32] (The "Multiple Sequence Alignments" section; Figure 3B). JalView helps to show the alignments of
orthologous protein, CDS, and UTR sequences, InterPro
domains, potential protein interaction hot sites, and species-specific substitutions, indels, and PTMs. All of these
features are color-shaded, and can be shown or hidden by
changing the check list in the accompanying "Feature Settings" box (Figure 3B). The user can view detailed information of the predicted protein domains and speciesspecific genetic changes by pointing the cursor to the
color-shaded boxes. Note that the features may overlap
with each other. Therefore, some features may not be seen
unless the overlapping features are hidden. The users are
advised to take advantage of the Feature Settings box to

obtain a clear view of the sequence alignment. A detailed
description of JalView can be found at the JalView website
http://www.jalview.org.
CAPIH also provides a JAVA-based adjustable protein
interaction viewer (The "Protein Interactions" section;
Figure 4). The interaction view gives the user an idea of
how HIV-1 proteins interact with the proteins of interest.
To extend the scope of interactions, we also include
human protein interactions downloaded from the BIND
and HPRD databases [30,31], in addition to HIV-1human protein interactions. The BIND and HPRD interactions are shown in dashed lines, whereas the HIV-1human protein interactions in solid lines with colored triangles representing different interaction types. HIV-1 proteins, human proteins, and the protein of interest are
shown in blue, green, and white circles, respectively. In
this interaction graph, user adjustment is allowed. Any
one of the circles can be selected by a mouse click. The
selected protein then turns red and can be dragged along
with the cursor. Clicking on the blank region will release
it. The graph can also be dragged along by clicking and
holding the left mouse click, or be zoomed in/out by
using the right click in the same way. CAPIH also provides

Utility
Example 1
It has been suggested that changes in T cell surface glycans
may be associated with Homo-Pan differences in CD4+ T
cell-mediated immune responses against HIV infection

[10]. It is therefore of interest to investigate the differences
in glycosylation between human and the other model
organisms. From CAPIH, we have identified 322 and 282
human- and chimpanzee-only glycosylation events,
respectively (Table 3). Many of these proteins are T cell
surface antigens. For example, CAPIH shows two experimentally verified N-glycosylation sites in the CD3G molecule (NP_000064) at positions 52 and 92. However, at
position 52 the glycosylation site (Asn) was substituted by
Thr in mouse, whereas the one at position 92 becomes
Asp and Glu in rhesus macaque and mouse, respectively.
Therefore, human has one and two more N-glycosylation
sites, separately, when compared with rhesus macaque
and mouse. These glycosylation sites are interesting targets for experimental verification and subsequent func-

tional analyses. If the glycosylation events are proven
important for changes in immune responses, researchers
can further examine CD3G-related PPIs to explore the
underlying molecular mechanisms.
Example 2
Another example involves the well-known group of
restriction factors, the APOBEC proteins. CAPIH includes
6 members of this group, namely APOBEC3A, 3B, 3C, 3D,
3F, and 3G. CAPIH indicates that none of these proteins
has an orthologue in the mouse genome. Since the
APOBEC3 proteins are known to be involved in host
defense against retroviruses, these proteins have undergone substantial changes because of positive selection
[33,34]. This is a good example of remarkably different
host factors even between very closely related species such
as human and chimpanzee. Indeed, CAPIH identifies a
considerable number of genetic changes in the cytidine

deaminase domains of the
APOBEC3 orthologues (Table 4).

human-chimpanzee

Notably, the mutations in the cytidine deaminase domain
are considered responsible for the host-retrovirus PPIs
and the host-range specificities of retroviruses [35-37]. It
is evident that the APOBEC3 members have experienced
very different evolutionary paths in this domain. As
shown in Table 4, APOBEC3B and 3C have obviously
diverged more than 3A and 3F both in terms of the
number of amino acid substitutions and the number of
potential PTM changes. It is therefore speculated that
APOBEC 3B/3C may have played an important role in the
divergence of hominoid immune responses against retroviruses. Nevertheless, the changes in 3A and 3F, though
not as drastic, can also have functional effects. Functional
studies are required to unravel the biological implications
of these changes. Also noteworthy is that no indels are
found in the cytidine deaminase domain in all of the four

proteins, suggesting strong negative selection on indels in
spite of the increased substitution rate in this domain.
Example 3
The interaction between human Vpr binding protein
(VPRBP) with the HIV-1 Vpr accessory protein is known to
be critical for HIV-1 infection ([38]. Inspection of the
multiple amino acid sequence alignment of VPRBP
reveals that the mouse sequence is shorter than those of
the hominoids by nearly 100 amino acid residues at the
C-terminus. The C-terminal half of VPRBP has a prolinerich domain and a number of Phe-x-x-Phe repeats, which
serves as the Vpr binding domain [39]. Consequently, it is
speculated that the loss of the C-terminal amino acids in
mouse VPRBP may have certain effects on the Vpr-VPRBP
binding affinity. This difference should be experimentally
verified, and if proven true, should be taken into account
in mouse-based HIV-1 studies.

Discussion
Here we present the first web-based interactive tool for
comparative studies of host-HIV interactions in four different model animals. The interface may provide new
insights into HIV studies. Firstly, although mouse is an
excellent model for HIV studies, considering the large
genetic divergences that occur in protein domains
between human and mouse as shown here, many of the
host-HIV protein interactions are expected to differ
between the two species. Therefore, the differences in
genetic backgrounds must be controlled for appropriate
interpretations of mouse-based HIV studies.
Secondly, human viral infections transmitted from other
species have become a critical issue because humans usually lack the immunological arsenal to fight such viruses
[2,40-42]. Comparative studies of host-virus interactions
provide a path to understand the possible mechanisms of
how viruses break species boundary into humans, and
why they cause pathological conditions in humans but
rarely do so in other animals. Differences in PPIs may harbor part of the answers. Since PTMs are critical to PPIs,
they should be taken into consideration when analyzing
the effects of different PPIs on host pathology. Meanwhile, PTM by itself is actually critical to host-virus interactions. Glycosylation, for example, is widely known to be
critical to viral recognition and entrance into target cells.
Given the wide spectrum of biological functions in which
PTMs are involved, variations in host protein PTM patterns should have major impacts on immune response
and virus life cycle.
Thirdly, one surprising finding here is that PTMs actually
differ to a great extent among the four compared species,
considering that they are genetically close to one another.
For example, human and chimpanzee differ from each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/164

other by an average of two amino acids per protein [11].
In comparison, in the 1,370 proteins compared, human
and chimpanzee each has more than 600 species-specific
substitution-related phosphorylation sites (Table 3). In
other words, on average, each HIV-interacting protein in
both human and chimpanzee has an average of 0.4 species-specific phosphorlation sites. This example illustrates
the importance of "PTMome". Glycome, the collective
sum of all glycans and part of the PTMome (if glycolipids
are not considered), is known to be remarkably larger
than proteome [43,44]. Therefore, it is easily understandable that PTMome is actually much larger than proteome.
The large numbers of species-specific PTMs in HIV-interacting proteins illustrate the great potential of PTM studies
in virology and AIDS studies.

Conclusion
The CAPIH interface is unique because it is the first webbased tool to provide comparative information of genetic
changes and PTMs in host-pathogen interactions. Since
cross-species viral infections have become a critical issue
in public health, comparative studies of host-pathogen
interactions deserve wide attention. Specifically, comparative analyses of host-HIV interactions may shed some
light on the mechanisms of differences in AIDS progression between human and chimpanzee. A number of possible mechanisms have been proposed [8,45]. However,
none of them provides a systematic view in the context of
host-HIV protein interactions. Furthermore, PTMs, perhaps one of the most important regulatory mechanisms of
host-pathogen protein interactions, have been rarely studied in a comparative way. This interface may provide clues
to the potential roles of PTMs in HIV infections, and serve
as a starting point for studies on host-HIV protein interaction networks in different hosts.

Availability and requirements
The CAPIH database is available at http://bioinfodbb.nhri.org.tw/hivppi/. The JAVA Runtime Environment
is required to view the interactive protein networks.
