Abstract
Background: The duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) belongs to the mammalian
subclass Prototheria, which diverged from the Theria line early in mammalian evolution. The
platypus genome sequence provides a unique opportunity to illuminate some aspects of the biology
and evolution of these animals.
Results: We show that several genes implicated in food digestion in the stomach have been
deleted or inactivated in platypus. Comparison with other vertebrate genomes revealed that the
main genes implicated in the formation and activity of gastric juice have been lost in platypus. These
include the aspartyl proteases pepsinogen A and pepsinogens B/C, the hydrochloric acid secretion
stimulatory hormone gastrin, and the α subunit of the gastric H+/K+-ATPase. Other genes
implicated in gastric functions, such as the β subunit of the H+/K+-ATPase and the aspartyl protease
cathepsin E, have been inactivated because of the acquisition of loss-of-function mutations. All of
these genes are highly conserved in vertebrates, reflecting a unique pattern of evolution in the
platypus genome not previously seen in other mammalian genomes.
Conclusion: The observed loss of genes involved in gastric functions might be responsible for the
anatomical and physiological differences in gastrointestinal tract between monotremes and other
vertebrates, including small size, lack of glands, and high pH of the monotreme stomach. This study
contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of the platypus
genome, might extend the less-is-more evolutionary model to monotremes, and provides novel
insights into the importance of gene loss events during mammalian evolution.

Background

A major goal in the sequencing of different genomes is to
identify the genetic changes that are responsible for the physiological differences between these organisms. In this regard,
the comparison between human and rodent genomes has
identified an expansion in rodents of genes that are
implicated in fertilization and sperm maturation, host
defense, odor perception, or detoxification [1-3], confirming
at the genetic level the physiological differences in these processes between humans and rodents. Additionally, the development of specific biological processes during evolution, for
example the production of milk in mammals, has been
accompanied by the appearance of novel genes that are implicated in these novel functions, such as casein and α-lactalbumin [4]. Therefore, it appears that the acquisition of novel
physiological functions during vertebrate evolution has been
driven by the generation of novel genes adapted to these
newer functions. However, although gene gains constitute an
intuitive mechanism for the development of novel biological
functions, gene losses have also been important during evolution, both quantitatively and qualitatively [5-9]. The recent
availability of numerous vertebrate genomes has opened the
possibility to perform large-scale evolutionary analysis in
order to identify differential genes responsible for the specific
differences in particular biological processes.
The duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) represents a valuable resource for unraveling the molecular mechanisms that have been active during mammalian evolution,
due both to its phylogenetic position and to the presence of
unique biological characteristics [10]. Together with the
echidnas, platypus constitutes the Monotremata subclass
(prototherians); this is one of the two subclasses into which
mammals are divided, together with therians, which are further subdivided into marsupials (metatherians) and placental
mammals (eutherians) [11]. The appearance of mammal-specific characteristics such as homeothermy, presence of fur,
and mammary glands makes this organism a key element in
elucidating the genetic factors that are implicated in the
appearance of these biological functions. Nevertheless, since
the last mammalian common ancestor, more than 166 million
years ago (MYA) [12,13], other characteristics have emerged,
such as the presence of venom glands or electroreception, and
some vertebrate characteristics have been lost, resulting in
the absence of adult teeth or a functional stomach [14,15].
In this work, we show that there has been a selective deletion
and inactivation in the platypus genome of several genes that
are implicated in the activity of the stomach, including all
genes encoding pepsin proteases, which are involved in the
initial digestion of proteins in the acidic pH of the stomach, as
well as the genes required for the secretion of acid in this
organ (Figure 1). The loss and inactivation of these genes provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms
that are responsible for the absence in platypus of a functional

stomach, and expand our knowledge of the evolution of mammalian genomes.

Results and discussion
Loss of pepsin genes in the platypus genome
During the initial annotation and characterization of the platypus genome, we noticed the absence of several protease
genes in this organism that were present in other mammalian
species [2,10]. Most of these lost protease genes encode members of rapidly evolving protease families, including proteases
that are implicated in immunological functions, spermatogenesis, or fertilization [2,16]. However, when we performed a further detailed analysis of all of these protease
genes lost in platypus, we observed that those encoding three
major gastric aspartyl proteases (pepsinogen A, pepsinogen
B, and gastricsin/pepsinogen C) were also absent from the
platypus genome assembly. These proteases are responsible
for the proteolytic cleavage of dietary proteins at the acidic
pH of the stomach, and have been highly conserved through
evolution, from fish to mammals and birds [17]. The genes
encoding these proteases (PGA, PGB, and PGC) are located in
different chromosomal loci, whose overall structure has also
been well conserved in most vertebrate genomes, including
platypus (Figure 2). Therefore, it appeared unlikely that their
absence in platypus could be due to the incompleteness of the
genome assembly in a specific chromosomal region. Moreover, analysis of more than 2 million trace sequences not
present in the assembly and expressed sequence tag (EST)
sequences from different platypus tissues [10] also failed to
reveal the existence of any of these pepsinogen genes, reinforcing the hypothesis that they had been specifically deleted
in the genome of this mammal.
To investigate this possibility further, we first compared the
genomic organization of these three aspartyl protease genes PGA, PGB and PGC - in the genomes of human, dog, opossum, chicken, lizard, and frog [18-21]. It is well established
that the genes encoding pepsinogens have undergone several
expansions during vertebrate evolution, leading to the presence of at least three to six distinct functional members in the
genomes of these organisms (Figure 2a). Additionally, a
duplication event in PGC in the therian lineage has resulted in
the formation of PGB, which appears to be functional in opossum and dog, and in the latter has probably replaced the function of PGC, which has been inactivated by pseudogenization.
The loci containing these pepsinogen genes have been highly
preserved through evolution, and their flanking genes are
also perfectly conserved in both order and nucleotide
sequence in vertebrate genomes (Figure 2a).
Analysis of platypus bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)
and/or fosmids corresponding to these regions revealed that
the genes flanking the pepsinogen genes in other species are
conserved and map to the corresponding syntenic region of
the platypus genome (Figure 2). However, a DNA probe cor-

responding to murine pepsinogen A failed to hybridize with
the analyzed platypus BACs or fosmids spanning the regions
of interest (see Additional data file 1). Moreover, complete
sequencing of the platypus genomic regions flanked by TFEB
and FRS3 as well as by C1orf88 and CHIA2 failed to detect
any genes encoding pepsinogen C or pepsinogen B, respectively. Additionally, and in order to test the possibility that
pepsinogen genes have been transposed to other loci during
platypus evolution, a Southern blot analysis with the same
probe was performed using total genomic DNA. This analysis
resulted in the absence of hybridization when genomic DNA
from platypus and one echidna species (Tachyglossus
aculeatus) were used, whereas the same probe readily
detected two hybridization bands in more evolutionary distant species such as lizard (Podarcis hispanica) and chicken
(data not shown).

Together, these data indicate that the genes encoding these
gastric proteases have been specifically deleted in the genome
of monotremes, probably resulting in important differences
in the digestion of dietary proteins in these species when compared with other vertebrates.

Loss or inactivation of platypus genes implicated in
stomach acid secretion
Pepsinogens are synthesized by chief cells in the oxyntic
glands of the stomach as inactive precursors that become activated when they are exposed to the low pH of the gastric fluid
[22]. The secretion of hydrochloric acid is stimulated by the
gastric hormone gastrin, which is released by enteroendocrine G cells that are present in pyloric glands in response to
amino acids and digested proteins. To try to extend the above
findings on the absence of pepsinogen genes in platypus, we
next evaluated the possibility that the gene encoding gastrin
(GAST) could also be absent from the platypus genome.

Deletion of pepsinogen-coding genes in the platypus genome
Deletion of pepsinogen-coding genes in the platypus genome. (a) Synteny map of the loci containing PGB and PGC in vertebrates shows a strong
conservation of the genes encoding pepsinogen C and its flanking genes, with the exception of platypus, in which PGC has specifically been deleted. The
figure also shows how the gene encoding pepsinogen B appeared in therians as a result of a duplication of PGC to a nearby locus, followed by a
translocation. The corresponding region in the platypus genome lacks any pepsinogen-coding gene. Functional pepsinogen genes are colored in blue,
whereas pepsinogen pseudogenes are in red. For human and dog, which underwent a translocation of the PGB locus, chromosomes are indicated on the
left. The genome sequences analyzed are from platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), human (Homo sapiens), dog (Canis familiaris), opossum (Monodelphis
domestica), lizard (Anolis carolinensis), chicken (Gallus gallus), and frog (Xenopus tropicalis). (b) Synteny map of the PGA locus in different vertebrate species
shows the deletion of this gastric protease gene in the platypus genome. Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and fosmids used in the study are
indicated at the top of each panel. Gene colors and scale are the same as in panel a.

After comparative genomic analysis following the same strategy as in the case of pepsinogen genes, we failed to detect any
evidence of the presence of GAST in platypus (see Additional
data file 1), which suggests that acid secretion might also be
impaired in this species. Consistent with this observation,
parallel genomic analysis also showed that the α subunit of
the H+/K+-ATPase (ATP4A), which is responsible for the
acidification of the stomach content by parietal cells, has also
been deleted from the platypus genome. This gene, which is
present from fish to amniotes, has been highly conserved
through evolution but is absent from the platypus genome
assembly (Figure 3a). Also similar to the case of pepsinogen

genes, the ATP4A-flanking genes (TMEM147 and
KIAA0841), which are present in fish, therians, and chicken,
were readily identified in platypus. Thus, analysis of a fosmid
clone corresponding to this region with a probe for the most
proximal gene (TMEM147) resulted in detection of a specific
hybridization band in platypus (see Additional data file 1).
However, no hybridization bands could be detected in platypus fosmid KAAG-0404B19, or total genomic DNA from platypus and T. aculeatus when using a human derived ATP4A
probe, which otherwise recognized specific bands in mouse,
chicken, and lizard (Additional data file 1 and data not
shown). These results extend the above findings on gastric

protease genes and demonstrate that other genes involved in
the digestive activity of gastric juice have also been selectively
deleted from the genomes of monotremes.
We next examined the possibility that mechanisms distinct
from those involving the specific deletion of gastric genes
could also contribute to the apparent loss in platypus of evolutionarily conserved digestive functions. This analysis led us
to conclude that two well known gastric genes - namely CTSE
and ATP4B [23-25], which encode the aspartyl protease
cathepsin E and the β subunit of the H+/K+-ATPase, respectively - have been inactivated by pseudogenization. Thus, we
first observed that the platypus genome contains sequences
with high similarity to both gastric genes in the corresponding syntenic regions, suggesting that CTSE and ATP4B could
indeed be functional genes in platypus. However, further
detailed analysis of their nucleotide sequence revealed that
CTSE is nonfunctional in this species due both to the presence
of a premature stop codon in exon 7 (Lys295Ter) and to the
loss of six of its nine exons. Similarly, the gene encoding
ATP4B has been pseudogenized in platypus because of the
presence of premature stop codons in exons 3 and 4
(Tyr98Ter and Lys153Ter), as well as a frameshift in exon 7
(Figure 3b). This observation, together with the loss of ATP4A
in platypus, confirms the absence of a functional H+/K+ATPase in this vertebrate and provides at least part of the
explanation for the lack of acid secretion in the platypus
stomach; this is a characteristic feature of monotremes,
whose gastric juice is above pH 6 [14].

Loss of gastric genes during platypus evolution
The mammalian stomach is lined with a glandular epithelium
that contains four major cell types [26]: mucous, parietal,
chief, and enteroendocrine cells. The data presented above
show that the genes encoding different products of these four
major cell types of the gastric glandular epithelium have been
selectively deleted or inactivated during monotreme
evolution (Figure 1 and Table 1). Although the genes encoding
proteases have been shown to be subjected to processes of
gene gain/loss events in both vertebrate and invertebrate
genomes [5,16,27], we have determined that these gene loss
events observed in platypus gastric genes do not represent a
general process affecting all proteins that are involved in food
digestion, because analysis of genes implicated in gastrointestinal functions revealed that those encoding proteases and
hormones expressed in the intestine or exocrine pancreas
from eutherians are perfectly conserved in platypus (Figure
1). It therefore appears that there has been a selective loss of
platypus genes responsible for the biological activity of gastric
juice.
To address this question further, we next performed a
detailed search for the putative occurrence in the platypus
genome of functional genes encoding proteins secreted by
gastric glands. This search led us to the identification of two
genes with interesting characteristics in this regard. The gene
encoding gastric intrinsic factor (GIF), which is necessary for
the absorption of vitamin B12, is perfectly conserved in platypus. This protein is secreted by chief or parietal cells in most
eutherians, but it is mainly produced by pancreatic cells in
dogs as well as in opossum, in which no gastric expression can
be detected [28,29]. It is therefore likely that the expression

of this gene was pancreatic before the prototherian-therian
split, and the intrinsic factor might still be secreted by the
pancreas in platypus, where it can exert its physiological
function.
To investigate this possibility, we conducted RT-PCR analysis
using specific primers for GIF and RNA from different tissues
from either platypus or echidna (T. aculeatus). This allowed
us to find that GIF expression can be detected in pancreas,
and lower expression could be also detected in liver as well as
in echidna brain, whereas no expression was detected in muscle or brain from platypus (see Additional data file 2). Therefore, these findings indicate that, similar to the case of
marsupials, the GIF gene is also expressed by the pancreas in
monotremes. A similar situation could occur in the case of
chymosin, an aspartyl protease that participates in milk clotting by limited proteolysis of κ casein [30]. Chymosin is
present in chicken and in most mammalian species, although
it has been inactivated by pseudogenization in humans and
other primates [2,31]. Our genomic analysis also detected a
gene containing a complete open reading frame that might
constitute a functional chymosin gene in the platypus
genome. This finding, together with the absence of soluble
pepsins and cathepsin E in platypus, suggests that chymosin
might be the only aspartyl protease with ability to contribute
to food digestion in the stomach of platypus. Nevertheless, it
is very unlikely that chymosin could compensate for the lack
of pepsin activity in platypus stomach because of its much
lower proteolytic activity when compared with that of pepsins
[30]. Additionally, the high pH of platypus stomach might
prevent the zymogen activation and proteolytic activity of this
peptidase. Finally, it is possible that, similar to the case of the
intrinsic factor, platypus chymosin might be also produced by
other tissues. In this regard, we have been unable to detect the
expression of this gene in any of the tissues analyzed above
(data not shown), although its putative participation in the
digestion of dietary proteins should be further characterized.

The loss of stomach function in prototherians is unique
among vertebrates, because this organ has been functional for
more than 400 million years, from fish to therians and birds,
and it has been adapted to specific dietary habits, resulting in
the formation of multiple chambers in birds and ruminants
[32]. In contrast, the stomach of platypus is completely aglandular and has been reduced to a simple dilatation of the lower
esophagus [14,15]. It is remarkable that some fish species
such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) and pufferfish (Takifugu
rubripes) have also lost their gastric glands during evolution,
although this fact has not apparently resulted in the loss of so
many gastric genes in these teleosts as in platypus [33,34]. On
the other hand, the small stomach, high pH of gastric fluid,
and lack of gastric glands in echidna, together with the finding that some of the gastric genes lost in platypus are also
absent in T. aculeatus, suggest that the loss of the stomach
function and gastric genes in monotremes occurred before
the platypus-echidna split, more than 21 MYA [10]. However,
it is difficult to determine whether the loss of gastric genes in
platypus has conferred a selective advantage during evolution, or whether they have been lost as a result of a relaxed
constraint due to additional changes in this species.
In this regard, it is possible that the loss of gastric genes in
monotremes might have conferred a selective advantage to
this population against parasites or pathogens that rely on the
presence of an acidic pH in the stomach for their infection or
propagation, or the use of cell surface proteins such as
ATP4A, ATP4B, or CTSE as receptors for the infection.
Should this be the case, then this would represent a clear
example of the 'less-is-more' hypothesis [35,36], which postulates that the loss of a gene might confer a selective advantage under specific conditions. Nevertheless, in the absence of
additional data, it cannot be ruled out that additional changes
in the digestive system of monotremes made irrelevant the
function of the genes described in this work, and they were
subjected to the accumulation of deleterious mutations
because of a relaxed constraint. However, an interesting
question at this point is whether additional strategies have

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R81

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/5/R81

been adopted by platypus to accomplish efficient protein
digestion in the absence of a number of gastric enzymes.
Changes in dietary habits, such as feeding on insect larvae,
which are easily digested; the presence of specific anatomical
structures, such as grinding plates or cheek-pouches, which
allow food trituration and storage; and the putative occurrence of a characteristic gastrointestinal flora in platypus
might constitute mechanisms by which this species has overcome the loss of a functional stomach.
Another question raised by this comparative genome analysis
is whether the loss of all of the above discussed genes is cause
or consequence of this particular platypus gastric phenotype.
Deletion of the gene encoding gastrin might have contributed
to this process, because mice deficient in gastrin exhibit an
atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa, with a reduced number of
parietal and enteroendocrine cells, achlorhydria, and
decreased mucosa thickness [37-39]. Additionally, inactivation of ATP4B has been shown to produce a significant
decrease in pepsin-producing chief cells and alterations in the
structure of parietal cells [25]. Moreover, loss of PGA might
also contribute to the gastric atrophy observed in platypus,
because this protease was recently shown to be required for
the processing and activation of the morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the stomach [40]. Therefore, deletion or inactivation of gastrin, the acid-secreting ATPase, and pepsinogen
A could have contributed to a substantial reduction in the formation of gastric glands in monotremes. Nevertheless, we
cannot discard the possibility that the stomach function was
lost by some other unrelated mechanism, and - in the absence
of a selective pressure to maintain the genes encoding proteins implicated in the gastric function - these genes were lost
by pseudogenization and/or deletion events. However, the
exclusive absence of these genes cannot explain the significant reduction in size observed in the stomach of platypus,
suggesting that other factors might be responsible for this
characteristic feature.
To evaluate this possibility, we first selected a series of genes
previously described to influence stomach size in mice and
examined its putative presence and sequence conservation in
the platypus genome (Additional data file 3). This analysis
allowed us to determine that the gene encoding neurogenin-3
has been lost in platypus (Additional data file 1 and Table 1).
Neurogenin-3 is a transcription factor whose activity is
required for the specification of gastric epithelial cell identity,
and deficiency of this factor results in considerably smaller
stomachs and absence of gastrin-secreting G cells, somatostatin-secreting D cells and glucagon-secreting A cells [41].
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that neurogenin-3 could
be a candidate gene to explain, at least in part, the morphological differences between platypus stomach and that of
other vertebrates. Nevertheless, further studies of the role of
neurogenin-3 in different species will be required to ascribe a

role to this transcription factor in defining structural or functional differences in stomach during mammalian evolution.

Mechanisms involved in the loss of gastric genes in
platypus
Finally, in this work we have also examined putative mechanisms responsible for the loss of gastric genes in the platypus
genome. A first possibility in this regard should be the occurrence of directed gene losses specifically occurring in platypus
and the two extant echidna species Zaglossus and Tachyglossus. As a first step in this analysis, and based on recent studies
of specific gene losses during hominoid evolution [42], we
examined the hypothesis that gastric genes were independently deleted in platypus by nonallelic homologous recombination or by insertion of repetitive sequences. Consistent with
this possibility, and in agreement with the increased activity
of interspersed elements in the platypus genome [10,43], we
have found that the CTSE gene has been disrupted in platypus
by the insertion of long interspersed elements (LINEs) and
short interspersed elements (SINEs) in exons 7 and 9, disrupting the protein coding region (Figure 4). Interestingly,
exon 9 was disrupted by the insertion of a LINE2 Plat1m element, which was further disrupted by the insertion of a SINE
Mon1f3 element (Figure 4). In this regard, analysis of different interspersed elements in the platypus genome has
revealed that the main period of activity of Mon1f3 elements
was between 88 and 159 MYA [10], indicating that pseudogenization of CTSE might have occurred within this period,
and suggesting that the inactivation of gastric genes in
monotremes started at least 88 MYA. Furthermore, the high
abundance of repetitive elements in the CTSE region (more
than 3.8 interspersed elements per kilobase as compared with
2 for the genome average [10]) might have contributed to the
deletion of six out of the nine exons of CTSE by nonallelic
homologous recombination between these repetitive elements. The variable density of interspersed elements in the
regions examined in this study raises the possibility that similar mechanisms to that observed in CTSE might have been
responsible for the complete deletion of other gastric genes,
although the participation of other mechanisms in this process cannot be ruled out.

Conclusion

In summary, detailed analysis of the platypus genome
sequence has allowed us to demonstrate that a number of
genes that are implicated in food digestion in the stomach
have specifically been deleted or inactivated in this species, as
well as in echidna. It is remarkable that the results presented
here may constitute an exceptional example of the less-ismore evolutionary model [35,36], both for the number of
genes involved as well as for the physiological consequences
derived from these genetic losses. In fact, the loss of the gastric genes reported in this study appears to be responsible for
the specific characteristics of the platypus gastrointestinal
system, although it cannot be ruled out that the loss of the

stomach by other unrelated events might have resulted in the
neutral evolution of these genes. The gastric genes lost in the
platypus genome include those encoding the aspartyl proteases pepsinogen A, pepsinogens B/C and cathepsin E, the
hydrochloric acid secretion stimulatory hormone gastrin, and
both subunits of the gastric H+/K+-ATPase. Likewise, genes
encoding proteins implicated in stomach development, such
as the neurogenin-3 transcription factor, are also absent in
the platypus genome. All of these genes have been highly conserved in vertebrates for more than 400 million years, reflecting a unique pattern of evolution in the platypus genome
when compared with other mammalian genomes. On the
basis of these findings, we propose that loss of genes involved
in gastric functions might be responsible for the remarkable
anatomical and physiological differences of the gastrointestinal tract between monotremes and other vertebrates, and
underscores the importance of gene loss for mammalian
evolution.

Materials and methods
Bioinformatic analysis
The identification of protease-coding genes in the platypus
genome was carried out as previously described [27], using a
6X assembly (version 5.0) generated with the PCAP assembly
program, with an estimated coverage of 90% to 93% [10].
Briefly, protein sequences corresponding to human proteases
were searched in the platypus assembly using the TBLASTN
algorithm with an expected threshold of 10. In most cases this
was sufficient to identify individual contigs containing exons
with high sequence identity to the queried protease, which
were further analyzed to obtain the full-length coding

sequence. In those cases in which no clear ortholog was found
in the platypus genome assembly, the following procedure
was used. First, the traces and the EST sequences were analyzed using BLASTN and TBLASTN, increasing the expected
threshold up to 1,000, which was sufficient to detect the
orthologous genes in the assembly and traces of more evolutionary distant vertebrates such as lizard, chicken, or frog.
Second, to exclude the possibility that these results arose simply because that the human gene was too divergent from the
platypus one, the query sequence was replaced by the corresponding ortholog in mouse, dog, opossum, chicken, lizard,
frog, or fish (when available), and the search was performed
in the platypus assembly, traces, and ESTs using BLASTN
and TBLASTN. Third, if the previous strategies failed, then
the 5'- and 3'-flanking genes in other vertebrate genomes
were used as query to identify platypus contigs corresponding
to the locus in which the candidate gene was supposed to lie.
These contigs were then searched with the TBLASTN
algorithm with increasing expected threshold to identify
potential exons of the gene or pseudogene, and the contigs
were analyzed for the presence of large gaps. When large gaps
were found, BACs and/or fosmids corresponding to those
regions were obtained and analyzed by Southern blot and/or
sequencing.

Southern blot and sequencing
Platypus BACs were obtained from Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, and fosmids and genomic DNA were
provided by the platypus genome sequencing project [10].
DNA was digested with the indicated enzymes, separated in a
0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane.
Southern blot hybridization was performed using specific oli-

gonucleotides corresponding to platypus genes present in the
assembly (Additional data file 4) or using human or mousederived cDNA probes for ATP4A (corresponding to nucleotides 1,899 to 2,503 of sequence NM_000704), PGA (corresponding to nucleotides 867 to 1,259 of sequence
NM_021453), and NGN3 (corresponding to nucleotides 387
to 593 of sequence NM_020999). DNA probes were PCRamplified using Taq Platinum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
purified. All PCRs were performed in a Veriti 96-well thermal
cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for 35 cycles of
denaturation (95°C for 15 seconds), annealing (60°C for 15
seconds), and extension (72°C for 30 seconds). Doublestranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP
(3,000 Ci/mmol) from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden),
using a commercial random priming kit purchased from the
same company. When specific oligonucleotides were used for
hybridization, they were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/
mmol) from GE Healthcare using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase
(USB, Cleveland, OH). Hybridization was performed at 42°C
or 60°C for oligonucleotides or cDNA probes, respectively,
using a Rapid-Hyb hybridization solution (GE Healthcare).
Additionally, the regions corresponding to the PGC and PGB
loci in platypus were cloned from the indicated BACs and fosmids, and subjected to direct sequencing using the kit DR terminator TaqFS and the automatic DNA sequencer ABIPRISM 310 (Applied Biosystems), with specific oligonucleotides as primers. Mutations in gastric genes were confirmed
by amplification of the corresponding exons with specific
primers (Additional data file 4) using platypus genomic DNA
as template, and the amplified product was subjected to
nucleotide sequencing.
