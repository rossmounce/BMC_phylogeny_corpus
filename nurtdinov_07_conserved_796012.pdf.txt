Abstract
Background: Alternative splicing has been shown to be one of the major evolutionary
mechanisms for protein diversification and proteome expansion, since a considerable fraction of
alternative splicing events appears to be species- or lineage-specific. However, most studies were
restricted to the analysis of cassette exons in pairs of genomes and did not analyze functionality of
the alternative variants.
Results: We analyzed conservation of human alternative splice sites and cassette exons in the
mouse and dog genomes. Alternative exons, especially minor-isofom ones, were shown to be less
conserved than constitutive exons. Frame-shifting alternatives in the protein-coding regions are
less conserved than frame-preserving ones. Similarly, the conservation of alternative sites is highest
for evenly used alternatives, and higher when the distance between the sites is divisible by three.
The rate of alternative-exon and site loss in mouse is slightly higher than in dog, consistent with
faster evolution of the former. The evolutionary dynamics of alternative sites was shown to be
consistent with the model of random activation of cryptic sites.
Conclusion: Consistent with other studies, our results show that minor cassette exons are less
conserved than major-alternative and constitutive exons. However, our study provides evidence
that this is caused not only by exon birth, but also lineage-specific loss of alternative exons and sites,
and it depends on exon functionality.

Background
Alternative splicing is emerging as one of the major evolutionary mechanisms for protein diversification and proteome expansion. Indeed, not only more than half of
mammalian genes are alternatively spliced [1-3], but a

considerable fraction of alternative splicing events
appears to be species- or lineage-specific, at the level of
comparison of genes from human and mouse [4-7],
rodents [8] or other mammals [9,10]; fruit flies (Dro-

sophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura) and malarial mosquito [11]; or rice and Arabidopsis [12].
However, the prevalence and functionality of non-conserved alternatives is subject to controversy. Indeed, nonconserved cassette exons are often frame-shifting or contain in-frame stop codons, and thus their inclusion leads
to isoforms likely subject to nonsense-mediated decay
(NMD) [13]. On the other hand, this does not necessarily
mean that such isoforms are devoid of function: channeling a transcript to NMD may be one of the regulatory
mechanisms [14,15]. Functionality of minor isoforms is
supported by the fact that many of them are tissue-specific
[5], although in a study that used oligonucleotide microarrays, NMD-inducing isoforms have been shown to be
expressed at uniform, low level [16].
In any case, pairwise comparisons do not allow one to distinguish between gain and loss of features such as splicing
alternatives. Two recent studies that considered more than
two genomes [5,11] just listed the estimates obtained in
independent pairwise comparisons. In a study with triple
human-mouse-rat comparison, about 20% of exons conserved in human and one rodent were not conserved in
the other rodent [17], although this result could be biased
by the procedure that used cross-species EST-to-genome
alignments. Multiple genome analyses [9,10] considered
progressively distant genome triples and demonstrated
relatively recent gain of human minor isoform exons.
Here we compiled a set of human-mouse-dog ortholog
triples and studied the conservation of human alternative
splicing patterns in the mouse and dog genomes. In such
comparisons, dog serves as an outgroup. Thus we can distinguish between gain and loss of a human alternative
exon or site, although it still is not clear whether a gained
alternative variant is functional or represents splicing
noise (to distinguish between bona fide gains and noise
using only evolutionary considerations, one has to consider gains that had occurred in internal branches of the
phylogenetic tree and were conserved after that). In an
attempt to address the functionality issue, we considered
separately major (mostly included) and minor (mostly
skipped) cassette exons, alternative splice sites corresponding to shorter or longer exon variants (internal and
external alternative splice sites, respectively), and framepreserving or frame-shifting alternatives. We also demonstrate that the observed distribution of minor (rarely
used) internal and external splice sites is consistent with
the model of random functional fixation of cryptic sites.

Results
Data compilation and preparation
Available ESTs, mRNA and protein sequences were
mapped to the human genome. Unspliced or badly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/249

aligned ESTs were ignored. Of 20809 genes in the initial
sample, 19669 genes had introns, and of the latter, 12595
genes had at least one splicing alternative. The alternatives
were decomposed into 34463 elementary alternatives of
the four main types: alternative donor and acceptor sites,
cassette exons and retained introns. The former three
types (alternative sites and cassette exons) occurring
within protein-coding genes were considered in detail.
After application of all filters described in the "Data and
Methods" section, the final sample consisted of 18910
elementary alternatives.
Triples of orthologous human, mouse and dog genes were
taken from [18]. A human exon was assumed to be conserved in the mouse or dog genome if spliced alignment
of the genomic fragment containing this exon and adjacent exons on both sides yielded exactly the same exon triple. An alternative splice site was assumed to be conserved
if invariant dinucleotides (GU for donor sites and AG for
alternative sites) of both alternative sites were conserved.
Note that (i) only the theoretical possibility of the conserved-exon existence is thus demonstrated, whereas its
functional relevance could not be assessed, (ii) this
approach allowed for the analysis of human genome-specific alternative exons and sites having no counterparts in
the mouse and dog genomes, but not exons that are alternatively spliced in the human genome, but constitutively
spliced in these genomes [7], and that (iii) absence of the
exon or site in the sample of mouse or dog ESTs does not
influence this definition. Thus the level of coverage of the
mouse and dog genomes by the ESTs did not affect the
results.
The major human variant was assumed to be the one that
was observed in a protein and had the larger EST coverage.
At that, the second variant was allowed to be supported
only by ESTs. Cases where both variants were supported
only by ESTs, as well as rare cases where the single proteindefined variant had lower EST support than the alternative
variant were filtered out.
To compute the inclusion level of a human cassette exon,
we considered all valid ESTs whose spliced alignment to
the genome contained, at least partially, both adjacent
exons. The inclusion level was defined as the fraction of
the number of sequence fragments containing this exon to
the total number of fragments covering this region. Note,
however, that since an average EST is rather short, this procedure may discriminate against exon inclusion events,
and thus their prevalence may be underestimated.
Similarly, to estimate the prevalence of an alternative site,
spliced alignment of ESTs containing (at least partially)
the exon spliced at this site and the adjacent exon was considered. Rare exons and sites that could arise from splicing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/249

errors were defined using the procedure from [19]. In a
nutshell, a variant was considered "rare" (and hence suspicious), if the hypothesis that its frequency is less than
1% could not be rejected at 95% significance level given
the observed counts of variants of the considered elementary alternative (see "Data and Methods").
Finally, all alternatives were divided in two groups, framepreserving ones where the length of the alternative region
was a multiple of three, and frame-shifting ones. Since we
considered only protein-coding regions, no in-frame stop
codons were allowed.
Conservation of alternative exons and splice sites
We tested conservation of all observed human exons in
genomic DNA of corresponding orthologous mouse and
dog genes using a two-step procedure (see "Data and
Methods"). To validate this procedure, we calculated conservation of constitutively spliced internal exons at varying levels of ESTs coverage (Table 1). These results agree
with previously published estimates of 93–98% in [20].
The degree of conservation of constitutively spliced exons
increases to 100% with increased EST coverage. Further,
since we aligned human exons to genomic DNA using
spliced alignment of exon chains, only exons that evolve
considerably faster than adjacent exons so that they cannot be identified any more in the specific intron by a sensitive dynamic programming algorithm could escape
detection. We consider such possibility rather unlikely.

The relationships between conservation, inclusion level,
and frame-preservation of cassette exons are analyzed in
Fig. 1. As is other studies, it is clear that (i) the fraction of
conserved exons is higher among exons with higher inclusion level [5,9,10,19] and (ii) frame-shifting exons are
conserved less often than frame-preserving exons (more
generally, exons yielding potentially translated isoforms)
[9]. However, the difference in the conservation fraction is
really negligible for the major exons, as more than 90% of
exons whose inclusion level exceeds 60% are conserved in
at least one genome regardless their functionality. For the
minor exons, the situation changes dramatically for
frame-shifting exons, and more gradually for frame-pre-

serving exons. However, even for very rarely included
exons (skipped in more than 99% of cases), the fraction
of human exons conserved in at least one other genome is
approximately 40% for both frame-preserving and frameshifting exons. However, the fraction of exons conserved
in both genomes is considerably lower for the latter
(10%) compared to the former (26%), and the same
holds for all other inclusion levels: frame-shifting exons
tend to become lost in at least one lineage. At that, an
exon is more likely to be lost in the mouse genome than
in the dog genome: the number of exons common for
human and dog, but not mouse is about twice larger than
the number of human-mouse-(not-dog) exons for all
inclusion levels of both frame-preserving and frame-shifting exons. This is consistent with other evidence of faster
molecular evolution in the rodent lineage compared to
other mammals, and human and dog in particular [18].
A slightly more complicated situation was observed for
alternative sites. Here the distinction between inclusion
and exclusion transforms into the distinction between
internal (yielding shorter exons) and external (yielding
longer exons) sites. From the protein point of view, the
use of internal sites leads to deletions (cf. skipped exons),
whereas the use of external sites, insertions (cf. included
exons). There exists an evolutionary asymmetry: even if an
internal site does not function in splicing, it still might be
conserved simply because it falls within the protein-coding region and is subject to selection acting on the level of
the encoded protein, unlike an external site that in general
might be expected to be conserved only if it does yield a
functional isoform. As seen in Figs. 2 and 3, the conservation reaches maximum in the interval of approximately
equal use of internal and external variants. As expected,
the conservation of alternatives is clearly higher in the
interval where frequently used sites are the external ones
compared to the rarely used external sites.
The overall trends in the evolution of alternative sites are
the same as in the case of cassette exons. There is a considerable level of lineage-specific loss of alternative sites, and
the losses are more frequent in the mouse genome compared to the dog genome. Frame-shifting variants, both

although many of them still are conserved in at least one
genome. Uniformly used donor sites from the frame-preserving subgroup are slightly more conserved compared
to acceptor sites, but both frame-shifting acceptor sites
and unevenly used acceptor sites that show clear prevalence of one isoform, are more conserved than donor sites

from the respective groups. However, all these differences
are rather minor.

extended by alternative sites, but the fraction of intronextending and truncating sites stabilizes at about 60% as
the intron length increases.

We then analyzed the possible source of alternative sites.
At that, we compared the frequencies of cases when the
major site is the internal one (alternative extensions) and
the external major sites (alternative truncations). The relative fraction of extensions among all alternative sites as

dependent on the exon length is shown in Fig. 6 (donor
sites) and Fig. 7 (acceptor sites), separately for two functional groups of alternatives sites (frequent and frame-preserving sites that are likely functional, and frame-shifting
or rarely used sites that might be suspected to be nonfunctional). We also considered separately all alternative
sites conserved in either mouse or dog. In all cases we
observed a strong correlation between the tendency of
alternative splice sites to be mainly extending or truncating and the exon length: alternative splice sites tend to
extend short exons and truncate long ones, with the balance between the extending and truncating alternative
sites reached at exons of approximately 90 nucleotides in
length.

These observations are consistent with alternative splice
sites arising from fixation of cryptic ones. Indeed, the
probability of a cryptic site within an exon (a truncating
alternative) increases with exon length. Truncation of
short exons is unlikely, as there simply is no space for an
alternative site. However, an alternative explanation could
be that alternative sites are fixated due to selection
towards preferred exon length caused by difficulties in recognition or splicing of too short or excessively long exons.
To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a
simple model of random site fixation. We assumed that
the probabilities of cryptic donor and acceptor sites are
the same within introns and within exons, and that only
in-frame cryptic sites could be fixated as minor alternative
sites.

In this case the probability of exon truncation (that is, of
existence of at least one cryptic site within an exon) is
roughly proportional to the exon length, whereas the
probability of exon extension is proportional to the distance to the nearest in-frame stop codon in the adjacent
introns. The equilibrium is reached when the probabilities of fixating a truncating cryptic site and an extending
cryptic site are equal, and this happens when the exon
length is twice the distance to the nearest in-frame stop
codon (since an exon may be extended on both sides).
When we calculated the average distance from a random
point in an intron to the nearest in-frame stop codon, it
was 73 nucleotides, and twice this value, 146 nucleotides,
indeed is close to the average exon length that is about
130 nucleotides.

Discussion
It has been suggested that alternative splicing serves as an
evolutionary testing ground: new exons initially appear as
alternative minor variants, and become constitutive following fine-tuning of regulatory elements if they prove to
add new, beneficial properties to the encoded protein

[5,9,10]. This is consistent with the fact that relatively
rarely used isoforms are more likely to be species-specific
and the evidence for faster evolution, and more positive
selection in alternative regions compared to constitutive
ones [21-25]. Stretching this idea a bit further, one might
say that the aberrant isoforms are not simple noise, but
rather raw building material, on which selection towards
new functions operates.
While earlier studies [8] saw little evidence of exonisation
and it was implicitly assumed that new alternative exons
evolve by duplication [26,27], newer analyses indicate
that exonisation may be the main source of new exons.
Indeed, many studies suggest that the human genome
contains a large number of cryptic sites that become activated following mutations disrupting the main sites
[28,29]. New sites can also emerge as a result of activating
mutations creating both alternative sites and cassette
exons [30]; this is particularly true for acceptor sites where
many splicing-related genetic diseases are caused by de
novo sites [29]. A rich source of cryptic sites, both acceptor
and donor, is Alu repeats [3,1,32,33]. Our analysis of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:249

extending and truncating alternative sites is consistent
with the theory of fixation of randomly occurring cryptic
sites. However, mutually exclusive exons indeed often
evolve by duplication [26,27] and their evolutionary
properties are sharply different compared to the properties of cassette exons. For example, in insects, mutually
exclusive exons are as conserved as constitutive ones, and
tolerate even less intron insertions than the latter [11].
When this study was essentially completed, two studies
appeared that addressed the problem of exon conservation in vertebrate datasets [9,10]. Both studies mainly
considered internal cassette exons and reached similar
conclusions, namely, that young exons tend to be alternatively spliced and minor. At that, both studies ascribe differences between human and other genomes to the
emergence of new exons. The latter study [10] used the
outgroup approach to distinguish between exon birth and
loss, and considered an exon present in the human
genome but absent in the comparison (say, mouse)
genome and the outgroup genome to be a new human
exon created after branching out of the comparison
genome (similarly for the exon loss). However, this
approach does not guarantee that these new exons are
functional and do not represent splicing errors or experimental noise [13,34]. The former study [9] used a different technique, calculating the number of exons present in
the human and comparison genomes and absent in the
outgroup genome; here the assumption is that such exons
emerged at the branch leading to the human and comparison genomes. This is a more conservative approach, especially at larger evolutionary distances between the human
and comparison genomes, since conserved exons may be
assumed to be functional. However, this does not account
for the possibility of exon loss in the outgroup.
Our results demonstrate that both the issue of exon functionality and the possibility of exon loss should not be
ignored. Indeed, a large fraction of alternative exons and
alternative sites are conserved in human and mouse but
not dog or vice versa, which means that whatever the
branching order, these differences may not be exclusively
explained by lineage-specific exon birth (curiously,
despite using the same Human Genome Browser genomic
alignment, the cited studies assumed different branching
orders, primates-rodents-dog [10] and primates-dogrodents [9]). A high level of exon loss in rodents was also
demonstrated in [17]. Thus, despite being consistent with
other studies [8-10] as regards the general trends in the
distribution of lineage-specific exons, our study provides
evidence that lineage-specific loss of alternative exons and
sites is an important factor in the evolution of alternative
splicing (cf. the prevalence of intron loss over intron gain
in mammals [35]). Because of that, conservation of exons
should be defined not only in terms of evolutionary depth

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/249

of exon presence in genomes (time of birth), but also as
resistance to loss. This means that modeling of exon evolution needs a combined approach, utilizing both outgroup and ingroup techniques. This can be done not only
for vertebrates, where evolution of the exon-intron structure is dominated by the exon dynamics [35], but also for
(dipteran) insects, where intron insertion and loss play an
important role, while the general trend of lower conservation of alternative sites and exons compared to constitutive ones is the same as in vertebrates [11]. Finally, we
demonstrate that not only conservation of cassette exons
depends on the exon inclusion level, but also that conservation of alternative sites depends on the relative site
usage and show that both are dependent on the exon
(resp. site) functionality.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate considerable evolutionary diversity of alternative splicing, in particular frequent lineagespecific loss of alternative variants. The fraction of conserved cassette exons is higher among exons with high
inclusion level, and frame-shifting exons are less conserved than frame-preserving exons. However, the difference in the conservation level between frame-shifting and
frame-preserving exons is really negligible for major
exons. For very rarely included exons the fraction of
human exons conserved in at least one other genome is
approximately the same for both frame-preserving and
frame-shifting exons, whereas the fraction of exons conserved in both genomes is considerable higher for framepreserving compared to frame-shifting ones. For alternative splice sites the conservation reaches maximum when
the internal and external variants are used approximately
equally. The distribution of alternative sites is consistent
with a model of random fixation: alternative splice sites
tend to extend short exons, truncate long exons, and
extend very short introns.

Methods
Construction of the sample of human elementary
alterantive splicing events
All protein, mRNA, DNA and EST sequences were derived
from GeneBank [36] (UniGene, EntrezGene, GenePept).
EST and mRNA sequences were aligned with genomic
DNA using ProEST [1], and protein sequences were
aligned with genomic DNA using ProFrame [37].

For each gene we constructed the splicing graph. The vertices of this graph correspond to the donor and acceptor
splice sites or to the termini of first and last exons, and the
directed arcs correspond to introns and exons. Then we
consider pairs of sites (vertices) such that the 5'-site has at
least two outcoming arcs, the 3' site has at least two
incoming arcs, and there is no vertex common for all
paths coming from the 5'-site to the 3'-site (note that both

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:249

the 5'-site and the 3'-site may be donor sites and/or acceptor sites). Each such pair of a 5'-site and a 3'-site forms an
alternative. An alternative with only two paths between
the 5'-site and the 3'-site was considered elementary.
Among all elementary alternatives we selected cassette
exons, pairs of alternative donor sites, and pairs of alternative acceptor sites. The corresponding subgraphs are
shown in Fig. 8. Retained introns, mutually exclusive
exons, and complex unclassifiable alternatives were not
considered.
We required that at least one path forming an alternative
was supported by a protein sequence. For example, for
cassette exon either the path consisting of one arc (intron
DC-AC) or the path consisting of three arcs (intron DC-AA,
exon AA-DA, intron DA-AC) in Fig. 8A, or both had to be
observed in spliced alignments with proteins from
GenePept. Thus we considered only 19350 alternatives
occurring in protein-coding regions. For each alternative,
the major variant was defined as the one supported by a
protein sequence and having higher EST coverage. We
removed 440 cases where the single protein-supported
variant had lower EST coverage than the alternative,
purely EST-supported variant. We also removed overlapping alternative splice sites by considering only alternative
donor and acceptor sites with at least nine nucleotide
positional difference. This resulted in the final sample of
18910 elementary alternatives.
Since we required that the major variant was a protein
one, this procedure allowed us to set the reading frame
and to distinguish between frame-preserving and frameshifting alternative variants, as well as variants containing
in-frame stop codons.

Rare exons and sites that potentially could arise from
splicing errors were defined using the procedure from
[19]. At that, we assumed that variants with frequency less
that 1% may not be relevant. To retain only relevant variants, we excluded all cases then the hypothesis that the
minor variant frequency was less than 1% could not be
rejected at the 95% level. For each elementary alternative
we calculated the probability that the observed minor variant counts are sampled from a distribution with the
minor variant frequency of 1%:

P=

∑ i!×(N!−i)! (0,01) × (1 − 0,01)
N

N −i

i=0

where N is the number of all ESTs that cover the alternative region, and K is the number of ESTs that correspond
to the minor variant. At that, an EST was assumed to cover
a cassette exon region if it covered at least partially both
adjacent exons. Similarly, an EST was considered covering
an alternative splice site if it covered at least partially the
exon containing this site and the adjacent exon. If the
probability P exceeded 0.95, we treated the minor alternative as a relevant one and assumed its frequency to be K/
N. Otherwise the alternative was treated as a possibly spurious one.
Testing the conservation of human elementary alternative
splicing events in the mouse and dog genomes
We analyzed conservation of human exons and alternative sites in the mouse and dog genome using a two-step
procedure. Firstly, we compared translated DNA
sequences of human and mouse or dog genes using BLAT
[38]. This allowed us to identify highly conserved human
exons and split all DNA alignments into segments
between such exons and, further, to localize orthologs of
all human exons in the mouse and dog genomes either
explicitly, or by matching of adjacent exons. Then we
attempted to find orthologs of the remaining unmatched
exons by genomic spliced alignment using Pro-Gene [39].
This program implements a variant of the Smith-Waterman dynamic programming algorithm. We allowed some
variation at exon termini, so that one or two first or last
amino acids in each human exon could be missed in the
alignment. Such site shifts were forbidden for alternative
donor and acceptor splice sites. This is consistent with the
observation that site sliding on larger distances is rare
[40].

Additionally we realigned exons that formed elementary
alternatives. To analyze cassette exons, we aligned exonintron-exon-intron-exon fragments (the central exon
being the cassette exon under consideration), and an exon
was assumed to be conserved if this exon and both adjacent splice sites (DC and AC in Fig 8A) were conserved. To
analyze alternative sites, we considered exon-intron-exon

fragments (with an alternative donor site in the left exon
or an alternative acceptor site in the right exon). An alternative site was assumed to be conserved if both constitutive and alternative splice sites were conserved (pair of
alternative donor sites DA1 and DA2 plus acceptor sites AC1
and AC2 in Fig. 8B; pair of alternative acceptor sites AA1 and
AA2, plus donor sites DC1 and CD2 in Fig. 8C).

Modeling of cryptic sites
To calculate the average distance to the nearest stop
codon, we considered random points in constitutively
spliced introns and scanned the intron in the 3' direction,
storing the distance to the nearest in-frame stop codon.
This procedure was repeated ten times for each constitutive intron.

Authors' contributions
