Abstract
Background: Invertebrate and vertebrate GATA transcription factors play important roles in ectoderm
and mesendoderm development, as well as in cardiovascular and blood cell fate specification. However,
the assignment of evolutionarily conserved roles to GATA homologs requires a detailed framework of
orthologous relationships. Although two distinct classes, GATA123 and GATA456, have been
unambiguously recognized among deuterostome GATA genes, it has been difficult to resolve exact
orthologous relationships among protostome homologs. Protostome GATA genes are often present in
multiple copies within any one genome, and rapidly evolving gene sequences have obscured orthology
among arthropod and nematode GATA homologs. In addition, a lack of taxonomic sampling has prevented
a stepwise reconstruction of protostome GATA gene family evolution.
Results: We have identified the complete GATA complement (53 genes) from a diverse sampling of
protostome genomes, including six arthropods, three lophotrochozoans, and two nematodes. Reciprocal
best hit BLAST analysis suggested orthology of these GATA genes to either the ancestral bilaterian
GATA123 or the GATA456 class. Using molecular phylogenetic analyses of gene sequences, together with
conserved synteny and comparisons of intron/exon structure, we inferred the evolutionary relationships
among these 53 protostome GATA homologs. In particular, we resolved the orthology and evolutionary
birth order of all arthropod GATA homologs including the highly divergent Drosophila GATA genes.
Conclusion: Our combined analyses confirm that all protostome GATA transcription factor genes are
members of either the GATA123 or GATA456 class, and indicate that there have been multiple
protostome-specific duplications of GATA456 homologs. Three GATA456 genes exhibit linkage in
multiple protostome species, suggesting that this gene cluster arose by tandem duplications from an
ancestral GATA456 gene. Within arthropods this GATA456 cluster appears orthologous and widely
conserved. Furthermore, the intron/exon structures of the arthropod GATA456 orthologs suggest a
distinct order of gene duplication events. At present, however, the evolutionary relationship to similarly
linked GATA456 paralogs in lophotrochozoans remains unclear. Our study shows how sampling of
additional genomic data, especially from less derived and interspersed protostome taxa, can be used to
resolve the orthologous relationships within more divergent gene families.

Background
GATA transcription factors perform conserved and essential roles during animal development, including germ
layer specification, hematopoiesis, and cardiogenesis [1].
Nevertheless, homologs in the GATA gene family have
undergone significant divergence in both sequence and
gene number in different animal phyla, making it difficult
to resolve orthologous relationships of individual family
members [2,3]. For example, the number of GATA paralogs – homologs within an individual genome – varies
substantially between protostomes and deuterostomes.
Most vertebrate genomes possess six GATA paralogs,
whereas the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has only five
and the nematode/roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans
eleven. Reconstructing the evolution and the ancestral
developmental roles of these genes requires a framework
of orthologous relationships among GATA homologs.
Previous studies have identified two classes of GATA
homologs within deuterostomes [2,3]. Basal invertebrate
deuterostomes, including echinoderms, urochordates,
and cephalochordates, possess only single GATA123 and
GATA456 orthologs. Most vertebrates possess three paralogs from each class, likely from two whole genome duplication events that occurred during the evolution of jawed
vertebrates. Within the three vertebrate GATA123 paralogs, the vertebrate GATA-2 and -3 genes are more closely
related to each other than to the GATA-1 gene. Likewise,
the vertebrate GATA-4 and -6 genes are both more closely
related to each other than to the GATA-5 gene [3]. Thus
two genome duplications, together with the losses of one
GATA-1 like paralog and one GATA-5 like paralog, can
account for the number of genes in each vertebrate GATA
class.
While the evolution of GATA factors within the deeper
branches of the deuterostome phylogeny is well understood, it has been more difficult to reconstruct the evolution of protostome GATA factors. We recently published
data suggesting that the last common protostome/deuterostome ancestor had at least two GATA factors with distinct roles in early germ layer development: an
endomesodermal GATA456 gene and an ectodermal
GATA123 gene [2]. In this analysis, at least one representative was identified from each class in multiple protostome genomes, and the germ layer specific expression for
each class was documented in a basal lophotrochozoan,
the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii. However,
orthologous relationships for the more degenerate C. elegans and Drosophila GATA transcription factors remained
unclear.
Here, we report an analysis of the complete complement
of GATA factors from several newly available protostome
genomes. We have identified GATA factors from nine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/112

diverse protostomes by directly searching databases from
recently conducted whole genome sequencing efforts. We
have conducted phylogenetic analyses using predicted
protein sequences, conserved chromosomal gene order,
and conserved intron/exon boundaries to better understand the evolution of protostome GATA factors. Our
results provide evidence for protostome-specific expansions of GATA456 paralogs and enable us to infer the evolutionary relationships of even the most divergent
Drosophila GATA factors.

Results
The complement of GATA transcription factors from newly
sequenced protostome genomes
To further investigate the evolution of GATA transcription
factors within protostomes, we obtained GATA gene
sequences from nine newly sequenced and phylogenetically informative protostome genomes (see Materials and
Methods). These include five arthropods [Ixodes scapularis
(tick), Daphnia pulex (water flea), Tribolium castaneum
(beetle), Apis mellifera (bee), and Anopheles gambiae (mosquito)], one nematode (Caenorhabditis briggsae), and three
lophotrochozoan [Lottia gigantea (limpet), Capitella capitata (polychaete), Schmidtea mediterranea (flatworm)]
genomes. For almost all of these collected GATA transcription factor genes we identified and assembled the complete dual-zinc finger domain for further analyses. We
believe that these retrieved GATA genes represent the complete GATA gene complement within each analyzed
genome (see Materials and Methods, Additional File 1).

Each ortholog was initially assigned to either the ancestral
bilaterian GATA123 or GATA456 class (see Introduction),
based upon reciprocal best hit BLAST analysis (see Methods). With the exclusion of the nematode Caenorhabditis
briggsae (discussed below), each of the additional protostome genomes appeared to possess a single GATA123
ortholog and three GATA456 paralogs. In the four insect
genomes, as well as in the single annelid (Capitella capitata), a fourth highly divergent GATA456 paralog was
detected. Thus, our initial genome wide search indicated
the existence of one single copy GATA123 gene and multiple copies of GATA456 genes within these additional
protostome species.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis defines multiple distinct
GATA456 clades within arthropods
Resolving the phylogenetic relationships of GATA transcription factors present in Drosophila has been difficult
due to their highly divergent gene sequences. Previous
work had shown that Drosophila possesses an obvious
GATA123 ortholog, grain, as well as an unambiguous
GATA456 ortholog, pannier [3]. However, the placement
of the three remaining Drosophila GATAs (serpent, GATAd,
and GATAe) has been uncertain due to extensive sequence

divergence within the generally well-conserved dual zinc
finger domain. The Drosophila GATA genes serpent and
GATAe have been proposed to be derived GATA456
orthologs due to their roles in endoderm and/or mesoderm development [2]. However, like some vertebrate
GATA123 genes, serpent also has roles in blood development suggesting that serpent may be orthologous to all vertebrate GATA genes [4,5].

(ML), Bayesian inference (MB), and distance based (NJ)
analyses (see Materials and Methods). This tree was
rooted with the sole GATA transcription factor in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (NvGATA), which appears to
be equally related to GATA123 and GATA456 genes [2].
This analysis confirms the existence of two separate
branches of bilaterian (protostome and deuterostome)
GATA factors, a clade of GATA123 genes and a clade of
GATA456 genes. It replicates previous results [2], but now
with substantially increased support due to the presence
of additional and more conserved GATA sequences. With
the addition of multiple arthropod sequences, the
diverged Drosophila serpent, GATAe, and GATAd now

We now can resolve the uncertain Drosophila GATA factor
relationships by including sequences from additional
arthropod genomes. The phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 represents the combined results of maximum likelihood

unambiguously group within the larger GATA456 clade.
The GATA123 versus GATA456 groupings are well supported by both ML and MB analyses, though not by NJ
analysis, which shows lower bootstrap support due to the
occasional grouping of the NvGATA within the GATA123
clade. We presume this is a possible short-branch attraction artifact, due to the relatively low sequence divergence
for the GATA123 and NvGATA genes. However, consistent with our results from the reciprocal best hit BLAST
analysis (see above), all of the arthropod genomes encode
sole GATA123/Grain like orthologs but multiple
GATA456 like paralogs.
Our more inclusive phylogenetic analysis also reveals
orthologous groups among the arthropod GATA456 paralogs. The four Drosophila GATA456-like transcription factors are co-orthologs of the vertebrate GATA456 family,
and appear to have independently expanded early in
arthropod evolution. The Drosophila GATA456 paralogs
are members of four distinct clades, each containing a single paralog from every analyzed insect genome. Furthermore, three of these insect GATA456 paralog groups
appear to be conserved within the arthropods, as one paralog for each of the three clades are found in the crustacean Daphnia, and in the chelicerate/tick Ixodes. We have
named the three common arthropod clades as
GATA456a/GATAe,
GATA456ba/serpent,
and
GATA456bb, using a nomenclature discussed below (see
Material and Methods). GATA456bb appears to have
undergone an insect-specific duplication (see Discussion), resulting in the GATA456bba/pannier and
GATA456bbb/GATAd clades in insects, and hence
explaining the fourth insect GATA456 paralog.
While our results support four distinct clades within the
arthropod GATA456 subfamily, the deeper evolutionary
relationships among these clades remain uncertain. NJ
and MB analyses represent the internal relationships
between the four GATA456 paralogous clades as an unresolved basal polytomy, despite the resolution of four
external GATA456 clades. However, the ML analysis suggests additional interclade relationships, as shown in the
tree in Figure 1. All of the arthropod GATA456 paralogs
appear to form a distinct and well supported clade. The
insect specific GATA456bbb clade groups closely with
GATA456bba clade, and therefore appear to be duplicates
from a common GATA456bb gene. This topology also
suggests that theGATA456bb factors appear more closely
related to GATA456a orthologs than to the GATA456ba
ortholog group, but we have found no additional evidence to support this relationship.

An arthropod GATA456 paralog cluster: Synteny reveals
orthologous relationships
To better understand the evolutionary relationships of
arthropod GATA456 paralogs, we examined the syntenic
relationships among the different arthropod GATA factors
and discovered a conserved linkage of GATA456 paralogs.
As shown in Figure 2, we found that three of the Drosophila
genes – serpent, GATAe, and pannier – are clustered within
a 47 KB region on the Drosophila 2R chromosome. We
have identified a similar cluster of three tightly linked
GATA456 paralogs in other arthropod genomes, including additional insects and a crustacean (see Figure 2).
Gene orientation within the cluster is fully conserved, and
the gene order follows the predicted orthology suggested
by the clades in our molecular phylogenetic analysis (see
above). As this cluster is conserved in all analyzed insects
and a crustacean, we infer that this cluster arose at least as
early as the pancrustacean ancestor, some 420 million
years ago. No additional syntenic relationships were
found when comparing the nearest upstream and downstream genes from each of the five assembled arthropod
genomes, suggesting that gene order within this GATA456
paralog cluster is more conserved than within surrounding chromosomal regions.

The conserved linkage suggests an origin from two tandem duplication events of a single ancestral GATA456
transcription factor. This cluster includes an unambiguous GATA456 ortholog (pannier) [2,3], further supporting
our phylogenetic inference that these three homologs are
all GATA456 paralogs. Furthermore, the weak homology
of the three identified tick GATA transcription factors to
each of these paralogs suggests that this three-gene cluster
may have existed in the last common arthropod ancestor.
However, our initial attempts at local contig assembly (see
Materials and Methods) have failed to find linkage for the
tick GATA genes. GATA gene linkage in the tick should
soon be resolved, pending assembly of the whole tick
genome.
A unique intron/exon structure for each of the three
arthropod GATA456 clades
The ~135 AA dual-zinc finger domain that defines the
broader GATA transcription factor gene family, including
both GATA123 and GATA456 homologs [3], is encoded
by three exons with similar intron/exon boundaries that
are found in the sole cnidarian GATA gene, and in all deuterostome GATA genes we have examined (data not
shown). We infer that the ancestral GATA transcription
factor gene contained these three exons (see Figure 3,
Additional File 1). An N-terminal exon (ZF1, ~50 AA)
encodes the first zinc-finger, and a middle exon (ZF2,
~54AA) encodes the second DNA binding zinc-finger
domain. The C-terminal exon (3'CD) encodes a conserved
stretch of ~30 AA, after which conservation sharply drops.

Synteny 2 GATA456 paralogs in arthropods and lophotrochozoans
Synteny of GATA456 paralogs in arthropods and lophotrochozoans. Linked GATA456 orthologs are shown within
genomic regions ranging from 30 kB to 75 kb in length. Green arrows indicate the transcribed GATA456 gene regions and
transcriptional direction. The full extent of the transcribed region is known only for well-characterized genomes like Drosophila. Predicted coding sequences (CDS) are shown in pink; the conserved dual-zinc finger domain in red.

Although the exon structure of this dual zinc finger
domain is well conserved in most GATA homologs, many
GATA genes in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster appear
to lack the first zinc finger. In Drosophila, the first GATAe
zinc finger is highly divergent, and GATAd lacks any sign
of the first zinc finger. Serpent was initially thought to be
a single zinc-fingered protein [5] – two of the three splice
variants for serpent lack the first zinc finger – but a more
complete analysis identified the serpent isoform B with a
complete conserved domain [6]. A lack of a first zinc finger in many GATA factors within Drosophila, as well as C.
elegans (see below), could suggest that these GATA factors
evolved from an ancestral sequence encoded by a single
zinc finger [3,5]. However, our examination of additional
arthropod GATAs indicates that independent losses of the

first zinc-finger have occurred. Both zinc-finger exons
appear intact for the three ancestral arthropod GATA456
genes in the additional arthropod species. Only the insect
specific GATA456bbb/GATAd orthologs consistently lack
the first zinc finger exon; however, our analysis shows
these are relatively recent duplicates, and hence must have
arisen from dual-zinc fingered GATA456 factors. Therefore, we conclude that the absence of the first exon and
zinc finger in some Drosophila GATA genes is a derived
rather than an ancestral trait.
Our analysis of GATA gene structure also suggests a
derived loss or modification of the second (2ZF) and third
(3'CD) exon boundary in many of the arthropod GATA
homologs (Figure 3). 16 of the 24 identified insect and

Intron/exon Structure of arthropod GATA conserved domains
Intron/exon Structure of arthropod GATA conserved domains. Schematics of the exon structure for the conserved
dual-zinc finger domain of the arthropods GATA transcription factors. The ancestral prototype for this conserved domain consists of three exons with well-conserved boundaries, represented here by the sole Nematostella vectensis NvecGATA. The first
exon (ZF1 in yellow) consists of the first DNA binding zinc-finger, whereas the second (ZF2 in green) contains the second
DNA binding zinc-finger domain. The third exon (3'CD in blue) contains the GATA N-terminal activation domain described for
some species.

crustacean (pancrustacean) GATA homologs have undergone a modification of this exon boundary compared to
the inferred ancestral sequence. The second and third
exons in all of the GATA456bbb/GATAd and
GATA456bba/pannier orthologs are fused. The
GATA456a/GATAe genes have retained the ancestral state

for the intron/exon domains, though they have also fused
their second and third exons in dipteran insects. The
GATA456ba/serpent genes (except the honey bee Apis)
also contain a second intron in the conserved domain, yet
the boundaries of this second intron do not appear conserved.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:112

The unusual intron/exon structure of the GATA456ba/serpent genes suggests they may have resulted from an initial
fusion of the second and third exon, and the subsequent
introduction of a new intron. We have identified four
examples of insect and Daphnia GATA456ba/serpent
homologs in which the first 13 AA from the third exon
(3'CD) are now encoded within the middle exon (2ZF).
The high degree of sequence conservation implies a transfer between the original coding exons, as opposed to a loss
of the beginning of the third exon and gain of surrounding genomic sequence at the end of the middle exon. This
presumably rare sequence of events likely occurred only
once, and was then preserved within GATA456ba/serpent
orthologs. The one exception, AmelGATA456ba, likely represents an additional intron loss.
To summarize, the clades of arthropod GATA456
homologs defined by molecular phylogeny also exhibit
clade-specific intron/exon structures. This correspondence
provides a third line of evidence in support of our proposed orthologous relationships for these genes, as suggested by both molecular phylogenetic analysis and
conserved syntenic gene order. The intron/exon structure
also allows us to generate deeper inferences regarding
interclade relationships (see Discussion).
Extensive gene duplication and sequence divergence
within the nematode GATA family
We also analyzed the GATA genes of two nematode species, Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans. The
GATA gene family has undergone extensive duplication in
nematodes, with eleven GATA factors identified in C. elegans, and thirteen in C. briggsae. These sequences display
significant sequence divergence, and only the elt-1/
GATA123 orthologs contain complete dual-zinc finger
domains. The other predicted nematode GATA factors all
lack the first zinc finger, similar to some of the insect
GATAs.

Although the nematode GATA factors are highly derived
in sequence, they resemble the arthropod GATA complement in displaying a biased expansion of the GATA456
paralogs. In a previous analysis, we assigned the C. elegans
GATA factors to one of the two classes based upon their
reported germ layer-specific function or expression. Four
orthologs have roles in ectoderm (epidermis and nervous
system) specification, while seven (C. elegans) or nine (C.
briggsae) have roles in endomesoderm (intestine and muscle) specification (see Additional File 1). However, our
phylogenetic tree (see Additional File 2) suggests that elt1 is the sole GATA123 ortholog in both nematode species,
and that all the remaining nematode GATAs group within
the GATA456 class. The long branches of these additional
GATAs, and the short regions of conserved sequence,
make these inferences highly speculative. Nevertheless,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/112

our data suggests that, like the arthropods we have analyzed, both nematodes have undergone a greater expansion of GATA456 paralogs, relative to GATA123 paralogs.
To evaluate the relationships between the GATA factors in
the two nematode genomes, we have conducted additional phylogenetic analyses using the complete gene
sequences from these two Caenorhabditis genomes (see
Figure 4). This analysis provides clear support for nine
common clades of C. elegans and C. briggsae GATAs, based
upon the ability to define orthology between individual
C. elegans and C. briggsae GATAs. This suggests that the last
common ancestor of these two nematodes possessed at
least nine distinct GATA genes. Furthermore, several nematode GATA factors appear to have resulted from more
recent duplications within these clades, suggesting their
duplication after the divergence of C. elegans and C.
briggsae lineages some 80–110 million years ago [7].
These include C. elegans elt-4, C. briggsae end-3, and the
med genes in both species.
We also observed chromosomal linkage of some nematode GATA genes. Most of the linked genes are the same
ones identified as more recent duplicates within single
clades that are specific to only one nematode species: the
C. elegans elt-4 and elt-2 genes, as well as the C. briggsae
end-3 and two of the med genes. Some orthologs are linked
in both nematode species, including the elt-5/6 and end-1/
3 orthologs, indicating a linkage retained from an ancestral Rhabditis species. However, these linked genes are
from closely related clades, and possess long internal
branch lengths suggestive of an evolutionary origin within
nematodes. We conclude that the linked nematode
GATAs originated from more recent nematode and Rhabditis specific duplication events, and do not reflect any
retention of deeper ancestral gene duplicates.
Similar GATA family gene number and linkage, but
different intron/exon structures, in lophotrochozoans and
arthropods
The lophotrochozoan GATA complement is similar in
copy number to the arthropod GATA complement. For
example, all of the analyzed lophotrochozoans possessed
three or four GATA456 homologs, and a single GATA123
homolog (see Figure 1). In the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea, and the limpet, Lottia gigantea, we have found
three GATA456 paralogs in a reciprocal best hit BLAST
analysis. The annelid polychaete, Capitella capitata,
appears to possess an additional GATA456 homolog. The
annelid leech Helobdella robusta, has 13 predicted GATA
homologs; however, the number and extreme divergence
of these leech GATAs relative to other lophotrochozoan
genomes appear to make these uninformative in reconstructing the ancestral annelid condition.

As in arthropods, we also identified syntenic relationships
of GATA456 genes in two lophotrochozoan genomes (see
Figure 2). In Lottia, all three of the GATA456 orthologs are
contained within a 45-kilobase region, although the third
gene appears to be inverted in orientation compared to
the arthropod genes. In Capitella, two of the four
GATA456 genes appear in an 11-kilobase region, though
linkage to a third gene has not been found. None of the
GATA genes appear linked in Schmidtea, consistent with
the relatively degenerate nature of the flatworm GATA
genes (data not shown), or perhaps a consequence of the
short lengths of the currently available assembled
genomic regions.
Although similar in number and linkage, it is unclear to
what degree the lophotrochozoan and arthropod
GATA456 duplicates can be considered orthologous. No
relationships between individual arthropod and lophotrochozoan GATA456 duplicates are apparent from our
molecular phylogenetic analyses.
It is also unclear to what degree these lophotrochozoan
GATAs are related to one another. The GATA456Nc genes
appear to be orthologous across Capitella and Lottia in
both ML and MB analysis, and the CcapGATA456Nd is
supported as a more recent duplicate of the
CcapGATA456Nc gene in the ML analysis. However, the
two well-conserved GATA456 duplicates from both
Capitella and Lottia (Na, Nb) group more closely within
each species then across species, suggesting these could be
recent lineage-specific duplicates. The sole GATA456 identified in another polychaete, the Platynereis dumerilii
PdGATA456, does not branch near the other lophotrochozoan GATAs, instead branching as the closest outgroup to
the arthropod GATA456 clade. Finally, when we examined the intron/exon structure of all of the analyzed annelid (Capitella capitata), mollusk (Lottia gigantea), and
flatworm (Schmidtea mediterranea) GATA genes, we found
little evidence for the extensive modifications seen for the
arthropod GATA456 homologs (see Additional File 1).
Thus, while the orthologous relationships between
arthropod GATA456 factors appear well supported, additional information will be needed to resolve the evolutionary relationships of lophotrochozoan GATA456
factors.

Discussion
We have identified the complete complement of GATA
factors from nine additional protostome genomes, and we
have reconstructed the evolution of protostome GATA factors using multiple approaches. Our initial estimates of
orthology, from reciprocal best hit BLAST analysis,
revealed an expansion of the GATA456 paralogs in protostomes, while the GATA123 genes appear to be retained as
a single copy. The inclusion of additional arthropod

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/112

genomes has allowed us to confidently assign the more
divergent Drosophila GATA factors as GATA456 paralogs.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated widespread linkage
of many GATA456 duplicates, suggesting a mechanism of
gene duplication via tandem duplication events and providing further evidence in support of duplicate-orthology.
Finally, we infer from changes in intron/exon structure the
sequence of gene duplications that produced the
GATA456 paralogs in arthropods.
Overview of the evolution of the protostome GATAs
We suggest two alternative scenarios for the evolution of
the GATA transcription factors in protostomes (Figure 5).
In the first scenario, the GATA456 family expanded very
early during protostome evolution. In support of this scenario, there are similar numbers of GATA456 paralogs in
lophotrochozoans (three, with a fourth in Capitella) and
arthropods (three, with a fourth paralog in insects), even
though they each appear to possess single GATA123
orthologs. Furthermore, the chromosomal linkage of
GATA456 paralogs, not only in arthropods but also in the
mollusk, Lottia, and partially in the annelid, Capitella, is
suggestive of a deep origin.

However, our analyses more strongly support a second
scenario, in which there have been independent duplications of a single GATA456 ortholog in both arthropods
and lophotrochozoans. This second scenario is suggested
by the lack of affinities between individual lophotrochozoan and arthropod GATA456 paralogs in molecular phylogenetic analyses. One possibility is that this cluster arose
very close to the lophotrochozoan-ecdysozoan split,
allowing little time for sequence divergence and retention
of phylogenetic information between the GATA456 paralogs. Nevertheless, the conserved modifications of intron/
exon boundaries between orthologous arthropod GATA
genes suggest that intron loss and gain occurred before the
duplication of certain arthropod GATA456 paralogs (see
below). Because all but one of the analyzed lophotrochozoan GATA456 genes have retained the ancestral intron/
exon structure, we conclude that either the GATA456 paralog clusters in lophotrochozoans and arthropods have
independent origins, or that GATA456 genes in arthropods have undergone repeated and convergent intron
losses.
Orthology and evolutionary birth-order of the arthropod
GATA gene complement
We have used multiple lines of evidence to determine the
origin and relationships of the more degenerate Drosophila
GATA factors. A reciprocal best hit BLAST analysis suggested that only one (Grain) of the five Drosophila GATAs
belongs to the GATA123 class, while the remaining four
are in the GATA456 class. Additionally, in multiple phylogenetic analyses all five Drosophila GATAs formed single

clades with other arthropod homologs, suggesting orthologous relationships between the GATA genes within each
clade. Orthologous genes for each of three fly GATA456
genes – Serpent, GATAe, and Pannier – are present
throughout arthropods. However, the fourth GATA456
paralog, GATAd, appears to be an insect-specific duplicate
found only in the beetle, bee, mosquito, and fruitfly
genomes.
Additional evidence for the orthology of the four arthropod GATA456 genes comes from the observed conservation of gene order within a GATA456 paralog cluster
among arthropods. The Drosophila GATA genes Serpent,
GATAe, and Pannier are present within a tightly linked
cluster, as are their best-hit orthologs in all the arthropod
genomes we analyzed. Moreover, the relative orientations
of these three genes are the same in every analyzed arthropod genome. In contrast, the insect specific GATA456
gene, orthologous to GATAd, is not linked in any of the
four analyzed insect genomes. Thus, the gene order is consistent with the predicted orthology defined by our phylogenetic analysis.

A third independent line of evidence for the orthologous
relationships among arthropod GATAs emerged from our
comparative analysis of the genomic intron/exon structures. The ancestral condition for the genomic structure of
the conserved dual zinc finger domain of GATA transcription factors is three exons with conserved intron/exon
boundaries, as found in all vertebrate, lophotrochozoan,
and cnidarian GATAs analyzed. In contrast, arthropod
GATA456 genes exhibit extensive modifications from this
ancestral genomic organization. However, the suspected
orthologs among the arthropod GATA456 homologs are
united by unique clade specific intron/exon structures.
The observed synteny, as well as the pattern of intron
losses and gains of the arthropod GATA factors, also provide an explicit mechanism for gene expansion via tandem-duplication and suggest an evolutionary birth order
for the GATA genes during the expansion from one ancestral to four GATA456 homologs in arthropods. As illustrated in Figure 6, we can infer the following sequence of
duplication events. GATA456a/GATAe and the
GATA456b precursor would have first arisen from an ini-

tial tandem duplication of a GATA456 gene that possessed
the ancestral intron/exon structure. GATA456b then lost
the second intron, resulting in a secondary state. The subsequent duplication of GATA456b formed GATA456ba/
Serpent and GATA456bb. Gain of a novel second intron
by GATA456ba/Serpent produced a third state. Following
the divergence of insects from a pancrustacean (insect and
crustacean) ancestor, a duplication of GATA456bb generated both the GATA456bba/Pannier GATA456bbb/
DmGATAd genes. GATA456bba genes appear to retain the
second state, but the GATA456bbb genes appear to have
lost the first exon (ZF1) early.

related to, or independent of those observed in other protostomes. For example, we can define nine Caenorhabditis
clades, but we have little understanding of how these
relate to the four predicted ancestral arthropod GATA
genes. Several of the nematode GATA genes are tightly
linked, but most of these appear to involve very recent
duplications. While sequenced genomes are now becoming available for additional nematode species, currently
the data from the well supported C. elegans and C. briggsae
GATA sequences provide the best platform to launch
future inquiries into GATA gene family evolution in nematodes.

Our analysis shows the utility of such rare genomic
changes as additional characters for resolving the relationship between deep branches in gene phylogenies. In this
case, combining synteny and gene structure analysis with
molecular phylogeny helped to resolve not only the
obscure phylogenetic relationships of the highly derived
Drosophila GATA456 genes, but also suggests the sequence
of gene duplications that produced this gene family in
arthropods. This evolutionary scenario makes predictions
about the sequences, intron/exon structure, and syntenies
of GATA456 genes within arthropod phylogeny that can
now be further tested by obtaining genome sequences
from additional arthropods. This scenario also predicts
similarities in expression and function of the orthologous
GATA genes in arthropod development.

Likewise, we cannot fully resolve how lophotrochozoan
GATA456 paralogs are related to each other, or to Drosophila GATA456 paralogs, despite similar copy-number
and linkage. In each of three lophotrochozoan genomes,
we identified three or more GATA456 paralogs. Two and
three of these GATA456 paralogs are linked in an annelid
(Capitella) and molluskan (Lottia) genome, respectively.
In our molecular phylogenetic analysis, the CcapGATANc
and LgigGATANc form a clade, and are both part of the
GATA456 clusters in either organisms, suggesting these
may represent orthologs across molluscs and annelids.
However, our molecular phylogenetic analyses fail to
define additional relationships for the GATA456 paralogs
in lophotrochozoans, or between lophotrochozoans and
arthropods.

The identification of clear arthropod orthologs to Drosophila GATA factors also allows us to infer the origin of
metazoan single-zinc fingered GATAs. Non-metazoan
GATA factors, such as the fungal AreA proteins, generally
possess single zinc-fingers, but most metazoan GATA factors possess dual zinc fingers. However, some invertebrate
GATAs (e.g. Drosophila GATAd or Serpent isoforms) possess only single zinc fingers that might indicate their independent origin from single-zinc fingered ancestors.
However, as described above, other arthropods possess
orthologs of single finger Drosophila genes with two zinc
fingers, indicating these genes all arose from dual-zinc fingered ancestral sequences. This conclusion is further supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses suggesting that
all metazoan GATA factors are equally related to fungal
outgroups (W.J.G, unpublished results). Finally, we also
have been able to identify highly conserved individual
amino acids that are diagnostic for individual arthropod
orthologs and may be useful for identifying orthologous
GATA factors in partially sequenced arthropods genomes
(see Additional File 3).

Additionally, the sequence and expression of four of the
five Capitella GATA factors was recently characterized [8].
They name these factors CapI-gataA, CapI-gataB1, CapIgataB2, and CapI-gataB3, which appear to correspond to
CcapGATA123, CcapGATA456Na, CcapGATA456Nc, and
CcapGATA456Nb, respectively. Interestingly, the mRNA
expression of the GATA123 ortholog was reported to be
restricted to ectodermal derivatives, while the expression
of the three GATA456 paralogs was described within
nested mesendodermal territories. These results provide
additional evidence for a class-specific germ layer expression and expansion of GATA456 versus GATA123 transcription factors [2].

Unresolved GATA456 orthology in other protostome phyla
While we can use both gene sequence and synteny to infer
GATA456 factor phylogeny among arthropods, it remains
unclear whether the GATA456 expansion in arthropods is

One path to resolving gene-family relationships in other
protostome phyla is to survey additional taxa, with a focus
on slow evolving genomes and appropriate phylogenetic
position. A better understanding of the Drosophila GATA
factor evolution was possible only after additional arthropod genomes from suitable phylogenetic branches were
included, many of which possessed less derived GATA
sequences. However, the arthropods currently are an
exceptionally well-sampled protostome phylum, and our
findings suggest that the current sampling of lophotrochozoan genomes is not sufficient to resolve their gene
family evolution. In order to extend our findings in

Page 12 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:112

arthropods to other phyla, it will be important to survey
additional protostome genomes. Several ecdysozoan
genomes have been targeted for whole genome sequencing, including those from basal taxa such as tardigrades
and priapulids. Genome sequences from additional nematode species may help resolve the current ambiguity
about the relationships of the Caenorhabditis GATAs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/112

were then clustered, using blastn to search for like hits in
the organism's trace archive, using these to group all positive traces and remove duplicates from the list of positive
TblastN hits. The best deuterostome TblastN hit from each
of the blastx analyses was recorded, and used for reciprocal best hit BLAST analysis to assign the initial orthology
to known deuterostome classes. This process was repeated
until no additional exons could be identified.

Conclusion
In this study, we identified and examined the complete
complement of GATA factors from nine newly sequenced
protostome genomes. We have reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of these protostome GATAs using
complementary forms of phylogenetic inference, including molecular phylogenetic analysis, genomic linkage and
an examination of intron/exon boundaries. Our analysis
indicates that protostome genomes have a single
GATA123 ortholog, but multiple GATA456 paralogs. Furthermore, by including many arthropod genomes, we
have been able to define orthology for the more degenerate Drosophila GATA factors, including assigning the
GATAd, GATAe, and serpent genes conclusively as
GATA456 co-orthologs. Our examination of intron/exon
structure modifications suggests a birth order of GATA456
paralogs, which could not be resolved in molecular phylogenetic analyses. This analysis has also identified similar
tightly linked clusters of three GATA456 orthologs in both
arthropods and lophotrochozoans, but additional taxa
sampling will be required to define gene family relationships among diverse protostome phyla.

Methods
Identification of the conserved domains of the GATA
transcription factor complement
To identify putative GATA conserved domains, whole
genome traces were downloaded to a local database and
searched using two previously described Platynereis GATA
factors and TblastN with each individual genome.
Genome sequence from T. castaneum (Tcas_2.0) and A.
mellifera (Amel4.0) was obtained from the Baylor College
of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center [9]. I.
scapularis (iscapularis.TRACE-WIKEL.june07) and A. gambiae (AgamP3) genome sequence was obtained from the
VectorBase [10]. D. pulex, C. capitata, and L. gigantea
sequence data (v.1.0) was obtained from the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute [11]. S. mediterranea (v.3.1) sequence data was produced by the Genome
Sequencing Center at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis [12].

The TblastN hits from the genomic trace archives were validated and grouped using subsequent blast analyses. First,
TblastN hits were validated by blastx against the Genbank
NR genome, with a positive hit showing highest similarity
to GATA sequences in other organisms. Validated hits

To assemble the individual exons, we used two distinct
methods. In cases where a genome assembly was publicly
available, contigs containing these exons were identified
by blastn and compared to define the assembled exon
structure for individual genes. In cases where no genome
assembly was available, we attempted to first connect
these exons by searching for traces with overlap between
two exons. In the case where no single trace could be identified to connect two exons, we performed chromosome
walks on the individual exon using the Tracembler program [13]. These larger contigs, which was based upon
overlapping sequence and also mate-pair relationships,
were then used to determine linkage between genes.
Nomenclature for additional protostome GATA factors
We have named these additional protostome GATA factors using a nomenclature that reflects our inferred evolutionary relationships. In some cases, such as for the
arthropod and insect GATAs, we can infer not only orthologous relationships, but also the sequence of duplications
that lead to additional paralogs. In these cases, we use a
binary naming system to describe each gene speciation
event, adding an 'a' to one duplicate, and 'b' to the other.
In cases where only uncertain orthology is inferred, we
describe the orthology following our convention, and
describe multiple, uncertain orthologs using a capital 'N',
followed by letters ranked by their degree of sequence
conservation (from most conserved to least conserved).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
A sequence file was made for each of the GATA genes
using the conserved dual-zinc finger domain, consisting
of the two zinc finger exons and the N-terminal portion of
the following exon. These sequences were aligned using
Clustalw [14], and then manual improvements were
made in MacVector (see Additional File 4). Maximum
likelihood analysis was conducted using PhyML-aLRT
[15,16] using a JTT model of evolution, and branch support given by the aLRT CHI2-based parametric statistic.
Bayesian Inference was conducted using the MrBayes v3.1
[17], using the JTT model of evolution. The results are a
consensus of two-converged runs of 3,000,000 generations, and branch supports given as posterior probabilities. Neighbor joining distance-based analyses was
conducted using the MacVector program (v7.2.3) [18],
and the support given by bootstrap percentiles of 10000

replicates. For the nematode GATA factors, the complete
sequence for each factor was aligned using Clustalx, a tree
was generated using PhyML-aLRT, and includes support
from both the PhyML-alrt CHI2-based parametric statistic
and Bootstrap percentiles from a Neighbor Joining analysis in MacVector.
