Abstract
Background: The lycophytes are an ancient lineage of vascular plants that diverged from the seed
plant lineage about 400 Myr ago. Although the lycophytes occupy an important phylogenetic
position for understanding the evolution of plants and their genomes, no genomic resources exist
for this group of plants.
Results: Here we describe the construction of a large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) library from the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii. Based on cell flow cytometry, this species
has the smallest genome size among the different lycophytes tested, including Huperzia lucidula,
Diphaiastrum digita, Isoetes engelmanii and S. kraussiana. The arrayed BAC library consists of 9126
clones; the average insert size is estimated to be 122 kb. Inserts of chloroplast origin account for
2.3% of the clones. The BAC library contains an estimated ten genome-equivalents based on DNA
hybridizations using five single-copy and two duplicated S. moellendorffii genes as probes.
Conclusion: The S. moellenforffii BAC library, the first to be constructed from a lycophyte, will be
useful to the scientific community as a resource for comparative plant genomics and evolution.

Background
The lycophytes (class Lycopsida) are an ancient group of
vascular plants that dominated the earth's flora during the
Carboniferous period. The three orders of lycophytes that
remain from this period include the homosporous Lycopodiales, the heterosporous Selaginellales and the heterosporous Isoetales. All of these plants are distinguishable
from ferns and flowering plants by the presence of microphylls (as opposed to euphylls), the absence of leaf gaps
and the absence of lateral roots. In common with ferns
but not flowering plants, all lycophytes produce free-living spores, an independent gametophyte generation and
non-integumented sporangia. Based upon the fossil
record, the lycophytes are thought to have emerged during
the early Devonian about 400 Myr ago prior to the evolution of leaves and roots in vascular plants [1,2]. Based on
recent DNA-based phylogenetic analyses, the Lycopsida
clade is monophyletic and sister to the fern/seed plant, or
euphyllophyte, clade [3]. As representatives of the earliest
and still-surviving vascular plant lineage, the lycophytes
are an important group of plants for providing insights
into the early evolution of land plants.
While genomic resources are available for many species of
flowering plants, including the sequences of the Arabidopsis thaliana [4], rice [5,6] and poplar [7] genomes, very few
resources exist for plants other than angiosperms. A draft
genome sequence is available for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [8], a chlorophytic green alga that is a distant relative of the charophytic algal group that gave rise to land
plants [9]. The huge phylogenetic gap between the characterized genomes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and flowering plants greatly limits our ability to study how

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/10

important features in plants originated and diversified at
a genetic level. To help fill this gap, the genome sizes of
several species of lycophytes were determined by cell flow
cytometry in order to identify a lycophyte with a relatively
small genome. Of those surveyed, the spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii was found to have the smallest, with a
nuclear genome size less than 127 Mbp. Here we describe
the construction and characterization of a large insert BAC
library for this species.

Results and discussion
Genome size estimates
The approximate genome sizes of several lycophyte species were determined by cell flow cytometry using as an
internal standard the nuclei of other plants or cells with
genomes of known sizes (Table 1). The homosporous
Huperzia lucidula and Diphaiastrum digita (Lycopodiales)
have the largest genomes of those surveyed, estimated to
be 5585 and 2670 Mbp/1C, respectively. Isoetes engelmanii
(Isoetales), a heterosporous lycophyte, has a genome size
of 1710 Mbp/1C. The heterosporous Selaginella moellendorffii (Selaginellales) has the smallest genome of those
surveyed, between 88 and 127 Mbp/1C. The three estimates of S. moellendorffii genome size (Table 1) vary
depending on species used as the internal standard. We
also confirmed that the genome size of S. moellendorffii is
smaller than that of S. kraussiana (Table 1), which was previously reported to have a genome size ranging from
0.32–0.72 pg/2C, or 157–320 Mbp/1C [10]. The decision
to construct a BAC library from the heterosporous S. moellendorffii was largely based on its having the smallest
genome size of all lycophyte accessions examined here or
reported previously.

Figure 1 of BAC DNA isolated from 43 random BAC clones from the S. moellendorffii BAC library
Not I digests
Not I digests of BAC DNA isolated from 43 random BAC clones from the S. moellendorffii BAC library. The vector contains
two Not I sites that flank the Hind III cloning sites. The vector is present in all samples with the exception of the first and last
lanes, which contain the DNA marker PFG midrange I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA).

BAC library construction and characterization
In constructing the BAC library, nuclear DNA was isolated
from the growing tips of S. mollendorffii sporophytes, partially digested with Hind III and the library constructed
and processed essentially according to Luo and Wing [11]
as described in the Methods section. A total of 9126 BAC
clones were picked, arrayed and processed for long-term
storage. To estimate the insert sizes of this library, BAC
DNAs were prepared from 410 randomly selected clones,
digested with Not I and size-separated by pulse field gel
electrophoresis. The Not I restriction patterns of 43 randomly selected clones are illustrated in Figure 1. Of the
410 BAC DNAs prepared, 23 yielded no DNA and 9
lacked an insert. Of the remaining 378 clones with inserts,
the inserts ranged in size from 9 to 292 kb, with 75% having inserts sizes 90–159 kb and 84% with inserts greater
than 90 kb. The average insert size of the clones with

inserts was 122 +/- 44 kb (SD). The distribution of insert
sizes is shown in Figure 2.
To estimate the extent of chloroplast and mitochondrial
DNA contamination of the BAC library, the arrayed
library was probed with two S. moellendorffi DNA fragments that contain either chloroplast- or mitochondrialencoded genes (Table 1). The S. moellendorffii DNA fragment containing the chloroplast encoded ribosomal proteins S8, L2 and S19 hybridized to 207 BAC clones. The S.
moellendorffii DNA fragment containing the mitochondria-encoded NADH DEHYDROGENASE SUBUNIT 5
gene did not hybridize to any BAC clones but did hybridize to itself (data not shown). It is unlikely that either fragment is of nuclear origin given that these genes are
encoded by organelles in every plant species studied so
far. The results of these hybridizations demonstrate that a
very small proportion (2.3%) of the BAC inserts are of

chloroplast origin. This is within the expected range for
organellar DNA contamination in large insert DNA libraries [12]. The inability to detect clones that hybridize to
mitochondrial DNA might reflect a mitochondrial
genome that is small enough to be efficiently removed
from the nuclear DNA preparation. However, the sizes of
mitochondrial genomes in the lycophytes have yet to be
reported.
To determine the number of genome equivalents represented by the BAC library, the arrayed library was probed
with the seven S. moellendorffii genes listed in Table 2. All
seven genes potentially encode proteins that are at least
43% identical in amino acid sequence to similar genes in
angiosperms. The two genes homologous to GIBBEREL-

LIN INSENSITIVE (SmGAI) and CYTOCHROME P450 98
(SmCYP98) were obtained by RT-PCR. The gene homologous to OXYANION TRANSLOCATION PROTEIN
(SmOTP) was identified from an EST library (C. Chapple,
unpub. obs.), while the genes homologous to the SHORTROOT (SmSHR), MAGNESIUM CHELATASE SUBUNIT
H (SmChlH), ZINC-FINGER (SmZNF) and SYNTAXIN
(SmSNT) gene fragments used as probes were identified
from the sequences generated from the ends a sheared S.
moellendorffii genomic library (J. Banks, unpub. obs.).
Based upon the genomic DNA hybridization results
shown in Figure 3, these genes are present in either one or
two copies in the genome. The number of BAC clones that
hybridized to the single-copy genes ranged from 7–12,
and to about twice that number of clones (16 and 23)

using the two duplicated genes as probes (Table 2). Based
on the results of these experiments, the estimated number
of genome equivalents represented by the BAC library is
~10. Assuming that one nuclear genome equivalent is represented by 871 BAC clones with nuclear DNA inserts and
each BAC insert is 122 kb, we estimate that the S. moellendorffii genome is 106 Mbp. This estimate coincides well
with the estimated size of the nuclear genome of S. moellendorffii based upon cell flow cytometry.
To our knowledge, this is the first Lycopsida BAC library
constructed. A BAC library was recently published for
Physcomitrella patens [13], a moss that has become a popular model system for functional genomics, biochemistry,
evolutionary and developmental genetic studies
(reviewed by [14]). As a representative of the early branching vascular plants, the S. moellendorffii library described
here will link genomic resources from algae
(Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and moss (P. patens) to seed
plants, including important crop species. The library also
will be a useful resource for readily identifying genes that
are involved in developmental, physiological and biochemical processes in the lycophytes and provide an
important tool for the study of plant evolution. The
nuclear genome of S. moellendorffi is currently being
sequenced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome
Institute using a shotgun sequencing approach [15]. The
BAC library described here is currently available to the
scientific community through the Arizona Genomics
Institute [16].

Conclusion
We have shown that the lycophyte S. moellendorffii has a
very small genome size, as small or smaller than that of
Arabidopsis thaliana based on cell flow cytometry, and have
constructed from this species a large insert BAC library
that contains about 10 genome equivalents and has an
average insert size of 122 kb.

Methods
Plant material
Selaginella moellendorffii plants were obtained from Plant
Delights Nursery, Inc., Raleigh, NC. Huperzia lucidula
plants were obtained from Carolina Biological Supply
Company (Burlington, NC; referred to there as Lycopodium
lucidulum). Diphaiastrum digita plants were obtained from
Gar Rothwell (Ohio University, Athens, OH). Isoetes engelmannii plants were obtained from Gerald Gastony (Indiana University, Bloomington, IN). Once obtained, all
plants were grown in a local greenhouse under 50% shade
cloth.
Nuclear DNA content determination
The procedure used to analyze nuclear DNA content in
plant cells was modified from Arumuganathan and Earle

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/10

[17]. Glycine max, Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare or Arabidopsis thaliana or chicken red blood cell nuclei were used as
internal standards. For flow cytometric analysis, 50 mg of
fresh leaf tissue was placed on ice in a sterile 35 × 10 mm
plastic petri dish. The tissue was sliced into 0.25 mm to 1
mm segments in a solution containing 10 mM MgSO4, 50
mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 3 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1
mg ml-1 propidium iodide, 1.5 mg ml-1 DNase free RNase
(Rhoche, Indianapolis, IN) and 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100.
The suspended nuclei were filtered through 30 µm nylon
mesh and incubated at 37 C for 30 min before flow cytometric analysis. Suspensions of sample nuclei were each
spiked with a suspension of standard nuclei (prepared in
above solution) and analyzed with a FAC calibur flow
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For each
measurement, the propidium iodide fluorescence area signals (FL2-A) from 1000 nuclei were collected and analyzed by CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose,
CA) on a Macintosh computer. The mean position of the
G0/G1 (Nuclei) peak of the sample and the internal
standard were determined by CellQuest software. The
mean nuclear DNA content of each plant sample, measured in pg, was based on 1000 scanned nuclei.
BAC library construction
The growing tips (1 cm) of plants were harvested and flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to nuclei preparation. Purified nuclei were prepared according to Luo and Wing [11].
The embedding of nuclei, Hind III restriction enzyme
digestion of DNA and the preparation of high molecular
weight DNA fragments were performed according to Luo
and Wing [11]. The Hind III cloning-ready single copy
pIndigoBAC536 vector was prepared from the high copy
pCUGIBAC1 plasmid as described by Luo et al. [18]. High
molecular weight genomic DNA fragments were ligated to
the vector and transformed into E. coli stain DH10B T1
phage-resistant cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transformed colonies were picked and transferred into individual wells of 384 microtiter plates, grown and then stored
at -80C. The BAC library was gridded onto 11.25 × 22.5
cm filters in high density, double spots and 4 × 4 patterns
with a Genetix QB (Genetix, UK). To characterize the BAC
inserts, BAC DNA samples were prepared with a Tomtec
Quadra 96 model 320 (Tomtec, Hamden, CT) in a 96-well
format, digested with Not I, separated on 1% agarose
CHEF (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) gels at 5–15 sec linear
ramp time, 6 V/cm, 14C in 0.5 × TBE buffer for 16 hours
and stained with ethidium bromide.
DNA hybridizations
Genomic DNA for gel blot analysis and PCR was isolated
from S. moellendorffii plants using the Nucleon Phytopure
kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA); cDNA was synthesized and RT-PCR performed using

the cMaster RTplusPCR System (Eppendorf, Westbury,
NY). The 479 bp SmGAI cDNA fragment (GenBank accession AY874058) was initially obtained by RT-PCR using
the
primers
5'cayttyacigciaaycargci3'
and
5'
tcraaiarigcrctrtartartg3'. The 473 bp SmCYP98 cDNA fragment (GenBank accession AY843208) was obtained by
RT-PCR using the primers 5'gtdgcvttcaacaacatwac3' and
5'ccatnccwgchgtgatcat3'. In all cases, y = c or t, r = a or g, d
= a, g or t; v = a, c or g; w = a or t; n = a, t, g or c. All PCR
products were cloned into the pGEM-T EASY vector
(Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Several genes
used as probes were generated by PCR using genomic
DNA as template. The 302 bp genomic SmSHR fragment
(GenBank accession AY877259) was obtained using the
primers
5'ggtggacctctcctctcctc3'
and
5'atccaggtttgtagcgcttg3', the 254 bp genomic SmZNF fragment (GenBank accession AY877260) was obtained using
the
primers
5'gaggtcgtctccttgtcacc3'
and
5'cggcgaaagtgtttcttgat3', the 395 bp genomic SmChlH fragment (GenBank accession AY877262) was obtained using
the
primers
5'ggatcgccttcatatccaaa3'
and
5'aaactcgcggtcacagtctt3', and the 375 bp genomic SmSNT
fragment (GenBank accession AY877261) was obtained
using the primers 5'gatccaggccaagatgaaga3' and
5'tgccagtgaccgtgaagtag3'. The SmOTP gene (accession
number AY877263) was identified from a S. moellendorffii
EST library; the entire insert was used as a probe. The S.
moellendorffii chloroplast (GenBank accession AY877264)
and mitochondrial (GenBank accession AY877265) fragment sequences were identified from a partially
sequenced, small-insert, sheared genomic library. For
DNA blot hybridizations, each cloned insert was gel purified and labeled with 32P using the Megaprime DNA
Labelling System (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,
NJ). For DNA gel blots, 4 µg of S. moellendorffii genomic
DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, fractionated
and alkaline transferred to nylon membranes according to
Sambrook and Russell [19]. All filters were hybridized at
65C in a solution containing 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH
7.2), 7% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mM EDTA. All membranes
were washed under stringent conditions (0.1X SSC, 0.1%
SDS, 65C).
