Abstract
Background: Brachypodium distachyon constitutes an excellent model species for grasses. It is a
small, easily propagated, temperate grass with a rapid life cycle and a small genome. It is a self-fertile
plant that can be transformed with high efficiency using Agrobacteria and callus derived from
immature embryos. In addition, considerable genetic and genomic resources are becoming available
for this species in the form of mapping populations, large expressed sequence tag collections, TDNA insertion lines and, in the near future, the complete genome sequence. The development of
Brachypodium as a model species is of particular value in the areas of cell wall and biomass research,
where differences between dicots and grasses are greatest. Here we explore the effect of mild
conditions of pretreatment and hydrolysis in Brachypodium stem segments as a contribution for the
establishment of sensitive screening of the saccharification properties in different genetic materials.
Results: The non-cellulosic monosaccharide composition of Brachypodium is closely related to
grasses of agricultural importance and significantly different from the dicot model Arabidopsis
thaliana. Diluted acid pretreatment of stem segments produced significant release of sugars and
negatively affected the amount of sugars obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis. Monosaccharide and
oligosaccharide analysis showed that the hemicellulose fraction is the main target of the enzymatic
activity under the modest hydrolytic conditions used in our assays. Scanning electron microscopy
analysis of the treated materials showed progressive exposure of fibrils in the stem segments.
Conclusion: Results presented here indicate that under mild conditions cellulose and
hemicellulose are hydrolysed to differing extents, with hemicellulose hydrolysis predominating. We
anticipate that the sub-optimal conditions for hydrolysis identified here will provide a sensitive
assay to detect variations in saccharification among Brachypodium plants, providing a useful analytical
tool for identifying plants with alterations in this trait.

Background
Although the contribution of agricultural waste to the
generation of transportation fuels has been negligible, in

recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in the
use of grass straw from agricultural waste as well as dedicated energy crops for the production of biofuels [1].

Since grasses of agricultural importance have complex
genomes and growth requirements that make them difficult for use in research at the molecular level, there is a
need for model grass species in basic research. This need
for grass model species is particularly evident in the area
of cell wall research, where dicots and grasses differ substantially in the composition and organisation of the
component polymers [2,3]. A growing range of genetic
tools and the growth characteristics of Brachypodium distachyon make it potentially a good model for grass
research [4,5]. A 4× draft of the genome sequence has
been released and an 8× assembly will be available http:/
/www.brachypodium.org[6].
The high costs associated with the three biological steps
involved in the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels
(enzyme production, biomass hydrolysis and fermentation of the released sugars) have driven numerous efforts
to make the overall biochemical conversion more efficient
[7]. These efforts have been directed not only to reduce the
costs of enzymes, but also to optimise the configuration of
all the steps of the process [8]. Any approach for improving the process of saccharification of lignocellulosic plant
biomass requires, or at least will benefit from, a thorough
understanding of the structure and biosynthesis of plant
cell walls [9]. Using Brachypodium as a model for understanding the characteristics of the grass cell wall involved
in the process of saccharification will require a detailed
characterisation of the saccharification in this material
under different conditions [6].
The conversion of lignocellulose into sugars depends on
variables present at different levels of organisation in the
cell wall, from the diversity of the glycosidic bonds
involved in the synthesis of the wall polymers, to the
organisation and the relative abundance of each component [10]. Indeed, alfalfa mutants with altered lignin levels present improved digestibility, and saccharification in
maize and sorghum is affected by ferulic acid cross-links
[11,12].
Industrial procedures for the conversion of lignocellulose
into sugars for fermentation use chopped biomass, in
which the structure and consequently the architecture of
lignocellulose represent another factor affecting conversion. The development of improved lignocellulose saccharification assays, relevant to industrial considerations,
should include materials where tissue structure is intact in
order to take in account features of the cell wall that will
influence digestibility in 'real-life' conditions.
Here we present a characterisation of the saccharification
of Brachypodium stem segments in order to understand the
modifications occurring in lignocellulose under different
pretreatment and hydrolysis conditions. We have carried

http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/1/1/15

out analyses of the composition of Brachypodium stems
and the products released, as well as structural changes,
occurring in the stem segments under mild conditions of
hydrolysis.

Results
Monosaccharide composition of Brachypodium stems
Brachypodium is closely related to agronomically important grasses, making it a potential model species from a
phylogenetic point of view [6]. To examine whether
Brachypodium relatedness to important crop grasses is
maintained at the level of cell wall composition, we compared the monosaccharide composition of stem cell wall
from several grass species with that of Arabidopsis, a wellcharacterised dicot model.

Figure 1 shows that the composition of Brachypodium is
similar to that of barley, Miscanthus and wheat. On the
other hand, the monosaccharide composition of the cell
wall from the grasses analysed differ significantly from
Arabidopsis. The percentage of arabinose in grasses is, on
average, 2.5 times higher than the amount observed in the
dicot species. Conversely, the molar percentage representation of galacturonic acid is around four times and rhamnose around five times higher in Arabidopsis than in the
grasses. These differences reflect the divergence in polymers constituting the matrix of the cell wall.
Whilst the cell walls of grasses and dicot plants are both
largely polysaccharide composites based around a framework of cellulose microfibrils, there are substantial differences between these groups of plants with regard to the
composition of the matrix polysaccharides that associate
with the cellulose. The primary cell walls of most dicots
are relatively rich in pectins, and xyloglucans form the
major hemicellulose coating the cellulose microfibrils. In
contrast, the primary cell walls of grasses have much less
pectin and xyloglucan, and glucuronoarabinoxylan
(GAX) and mixed-linkage glucans form the major hemicelluloses [13]. Dicots and grasses also show differences in
the composition of secondary cell walls. The hemicellulose of dicot secondary cell walls is typically dominated by
simple arabinoxylans with only occasional side chains
[14]. In contrast, the GAX of grass secondary cell walls has
more complex and numerous side chains, and the arabinosyl side chains may serve as connections to lignin
through feruloyl esters [1,14].
The cell walls of dicot species such as Arabidopsis are generally much richer in pectic components such as homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan than are grasses,
and this is clearly apparent in the higher levels of galacturonic acid released from Arabidopsis cell walls. The similarities in non-cellulosic monosaccharide composition
between Brachypodium and commercially important

grasses lend support to the use of Brachypodium as a model
to explore the conversion of lignocellulose from grasses
into ethanol.
Effect of H2SO4 concentration and temperature during
pretreatment on the hydrolysis of Brachypodium stem
segments
Many studies have shown the need for pretreatment of the
lignocellulosic material in order to produce an efficient
hydrolysis [15]. Here we studied different conditions of
diluted acid pretreatment in the release of sugars from
Brachypodium stem segments.

Increasing concentrations of H2SO4 up to 2% at 90°C
increased the release of sugars in Brachypodium stems. Acid
pretreatment above these concentrations did not result in
increased sugars production after hydrolysis. Conversely,
acid pretreatment of paper (used here as a de-lignified
control) only marginally increased the release of sugars
after hydrolysis, and concentrations of sulphuric acid
above 1% did not increase saccharification in paper (Figure 2). The pretreatment of Brachypodium segments with
4% H2SO4 resulted in a lower production of sugars from
stem segments after enzymatic hydrolysis, suggesting that
a certain proportion of the polysaccharides accessible to
the enzymes are released by the acid during the pretreatment (Figure 2).

Diverging composition is observed between grasses and Arabidopsis. Results represent the mean (± SD) of three experiments.

Further effects of different pretreatment conditions were
studied, combining increasing temperatures with H2SO4.
The release of sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis remained
unaltered in the absence of H2SO4, irrespective of increase
in the temperature (up to 130°C) (Figure 3A). The efficiency of the enzymatic saccharification increased following pretreatment with H2SO4 at all temperatures, but we
found that temperature and H2SO4 concentration generally interact in a cooperative way leading to increased
enzymatic saccharification. However, pretreatment at
130°C in the presence of H2SO4 led to a lower sugar
release on cellulase treatment than that seen at lower temperatures. As shown in Figure 2 for H2SO4 concentration
above 4% at 90°C, this decrease in the efficiency in the
release of sugars is probably due to chemical hydrolysis
produced by the combination of high acid concentration
and high temperature. Indeed, the sugars present in the
media of the pretreatment show a drastic increase when
the H2SO4 concentrations and temperature increase (Figure 3B). Hemicellulose hydrolysis has been reported in
corn stover under diluted acid conditions and slightly
higher temperatures [16]. Under the mild hydrolysis conditions used in the present work, the release of sugars produced during the acid pretreatment limits the availability
of substrates for the subsequent enzymatic action. Alternatively, hot acid treatments can lead to the formation of
inhibitors of enzyme action and thereby reduce sugar

release [17]. In our experiments, this explanation seems
unlikely as the segments are rinsed after acid treatment
prior to adding the enzymes.
The effect of different pretreatment conditions in the
structure of the Brachypodium stem segments was observed
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 4
shows sections obtained by splitting the segments longitudinally, in order to observe the vascular elements and
epidermis after pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic
hydrolysis. Pretreatment at 90°C with or without enzymatic hydrolysis shows no discernable change in the
structure of the vascular tissue. After enzymatic treatment
the tissue appears slightly disorganised, but no major
effect is observed (Figure 4). The pretreatment with 2%
H2SO4 at 90°C also shows no obvious changes in the
structure of the tissue, but following subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis there are clear changes in structure with
thinner and 'flaky' walls apparent in the longitudinal sections. The longitudinal sections show clear alterations
when pretreated at 130°C, even in the absence of H2SO4.
When the segments are pretreated at 130°C in the presence of acid, fibrous material is exposed in the surface of
the material (Figure 4). Similar exposure of fibrous cell

wall material has been shown in barley hull, particularly
at the level of epidermis [18].
Analysis of sugars released during pretreatment at
different temperatures
In order to study the effect of mild pretreatment with
dilute acid, we studied the composition of sugars released
after 20 minutes of pretreatment with and without acid
and at different temperatures. Figure 5 shows that xylose
is the major monosaccharide released during pretreatment without H2SO4 acid. Small amounts of glucose were
also released. Increasing temperature led to increased
amounts of xylose and glucose being released, but no
other detectable sugars appeared (Figure 5A). When the
stem segments were pretreated in the presence of 1%
H2SO4 at 4°C, the predominant sugar detected was xylose
with traces of glucose and mannose (Figure 5B). Increasing temperature in the presence of H2SO4 led to an
increase in the release of xylose, mannose and glucose,
with arabinose also present in the pretreatment media.
Many studies show hemicellulose hydrolysis produced by
diluted acid treatment [19,20]. These results suggest that
acid pretreatment at high temperatures induces the breakdown of hemicellulose in Brachypodium segments, mainly
glucuronooarabinoxylans.

Standard conditions of hydrolysis and effect on
Brachypodium stems
The saccharification of Brachypodium stems was compared
with the digestion of paper in order to compare the
dynamics of sugar release from cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials. An increasing amount of enzyme progressively increased the release of sugars in paper (Figure 6),
showing that no structural barriers limit the enzymatic
activity in this case. In contrast, in Brachypodium stems, the
release of sugars increased with increasing enzyme load,
to 12 filter paper units (FPU)/g and then stabilised (Figure
6), suggesting that access to substrates is more limited
than is the case with paper.

One of the major aims of the work presented here is to
establish conditions for use in high-throughput screens to
enable the identification of alterations in saccharification
potential in mutant populations. In contrast to industrial
processing where maximum release of sugars is desirable,
we wish to identify mild pretreatment conditions that

http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/1/1/15

allow the enzymes to release limited quantities of sugar
from wild type stems and will enable changes in the ease
of sugar mobilisation with enzymes in potential mutants
to be detected. In a typical digestion we pretreat 4 mm
whole stem segments with 1% H2SO4 at 90°C for 20 min.
Subsequent digestion of the pretreated material is carried
out for 1 h at 30°C, using an enzyme cocktail containing
4 FPU and 19 cellobiose units (CBU) (see Methods for
details) per gram of material. Under these conditions, an
average of 75% of the total sugars in the material
remained undigested in the stems following pretreatment
and enzyme hydrolysis, whilst 90% remained following
enzyme hydrolysis without pretreatment (Figure 7). SEM
imaging showed minor structural alterations of the Brachypodium stems following hydrolysis (Figure 4).

rides. This most likely reflects the fact that paper has
already seen substantial loss of hemicelluloses during the
pulping process, and that pulping has also produced
cleaner cellulose fibres more readily attacked by cellulases. Although xylose was not detected in the oligosaccharide analysis (Figure 9A), monosaccharide analyses of
the digestion products from paper show that xylose is
present after enzyme action, but the low amounts released
(relative to glucose) do not allow quantification under the
analytical conditions of the oligosaccharide analyses (data
not shown).

early in the digestion but disappear with time (Figure 9).

Methods. Results represent the mean (± SD) of three experiments.

In contrast, the Brachypodium stems have only been
exposed to the gentle pretreatment conditions used in our
assay and hence the more readily digestible hemicellulose
components are releasing greater quantities of sugar than
the more recalcitrant cellulose (Figure 9B). Saccharification analysis of dilute H2SO4-impregnated wheat straw
produced large amounts of xylose after pretreatment in
enzymatic hydrolysis [21]. Since some of the main candidate energy crops are grasses, high levels of xylose are
expected to be released for fermentation, underlying the
need for pentose-fermenting organisms in the production
of liquid biofuels [22].

Conclusion
Brachypodium is being considered as a suitable experimental model species to investigate various parameters related
to the use of fast-growing biomass grasses in the context
of biofuels and bioenergy [3,6]. Work presented in this
paper shows that the composition of non-cellulosic
polysaccharides in Brachypodium appears broadly similar
to that of biomass grasses and cereals, and that all of these
differ to that seen in Arabidopsis, indicating that from a
perspective of cell wall composition Brachypodium appears
to be a suitable model. In order to underpin the development of high-throughput saccharification screens that can
be used to identify Brachypodium mutants with altered
digestibility characteristics, we have undertaken an examination into the effects of a range of pretreatment and
enzymatic hydrolysis conditions. Dilute acid pretreatment has been shown to be an efficient method of increasing efficiency in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials
in general. Here we show the effect of particular combinations of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis in the saccharification of Brachypodium stems.
We found that both pretreatment temperature and acid
concentration had effects on subsequent enzymatic saccharification. Temperatures above 110°C combined with
acid in the pretreatment led to hydrolysis of cell wall
polysaccharides directly, decreasing the amount of sugars
released by subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. The monosaccharide composition of the sugars released during
pretreatment corresponds to hemicellulosic materials.

SEM images of the segments after pretreatment and enzymatic attack revealed changes in stem structure associated
with changes in sugar release. Our data support the use of
Brachypodium as a model species for studying lignocellulose from cereals and biomass grasses, and suggest a combination of modest temperature and dilute acid
pretreatment may form the basis of a sensitive screening
method to identify genes affecting grass biomass saccharification potential.

Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions
Seed of Brachypodium distachyon Bd21 were sown in 4-inch
pots, watered, and kept at 4°C for two weeks prior to
growth. Plants were grown in a glasshouse under a 16hours light regime, at 22°C. After setting seed, plants were
left to dry in the pots. For studying saccharification, stem
segments of 4 mm length were taken from the middle section of internodes 5, 6, and 7. Preliminary studies showed
that there were no differences in saccharification using
material taken from these internodes. In all the saccharification assays 4 mg samples were used and assays were carried out in quadruplicates. In the case of paper used for
comparative purposes with Brachypodium stems, samples
were 4 mg of 5 mm discs of 80 g/m2 recycled paper (MReal, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Hydrolysis of materials
Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out using Celluclast
(cellulase from Trichoderma reesei) and Novozyme 188
(cellobiase from Aspergillus niger) in an enzyme cocktail
containing a 4:1 proportion of Celluclast: Novozyme 188.
The enzymes were filtered using a Hi-Trap desalting column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) before use and
the hydrolysis was carried out during the indicated times,
at 30°C in buffer Na Acetate 25 mM at pH 4.5.
Total sugar content
The determination of total sugar content in untreated,
pretreated, and no pretreatment stems was carried out following the protocol described by Fry [23]. 4 mg of stem
fragments were dissolved in 72% H2SO4 at 30°C and then
hydrolysed in 4% H2SO4 at 120°C for 1 h. The resulting
solution was neutralised with Ba(OH)2 and the sugars
were measured as described below in sugar determination.
Scanning electro microscopy
Stems were incubated in buffer Na Acetate 25 mM pH 4.5
for 20 min at room temperature (untreated and no pretreatment), or incubated in 1% H2SO4 for 20 min at 90°C
(pretreated). The segments were rinsed several times with
buffer and then incubated with 0 or 0.5 mg of enzyme
cocktail for 1 h. Segments were placed in 100% ethanol
and then air-dried. For SEM, stems were mounted in SEM

http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/1/1/15

stubs and coated with gold/palladium. The mounted
specimens were observed with a JEOL JSM 6490LV (Jeol
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5kV.
Sugar determination
The determination of sugars released after hydrolysis was
done using a modification of the method by Anton and
Barrett [24] using 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrozone (MTBH). Determination was carried out in a 1 ml
final volume using 300 μl of sample. The detection reaction contained 0.25 N NaOH, 0.06% MTBH, 0.02% DTT,
and colour was developed by adding 0.2% FeNH4(SO4)2,
0.2% Sulfamic acid and 0.1% HCl. The absorbance of the
reaction was followed at 620 nm. This method was tested
for the detection of a range of sugars that are released from
the cell wall, showing no significant differences between
reducing sugars.
Sugar analysis
Oligosaccharide analyses of the sugars released from stem
segments after hydrolysis was carried out by taking 0.2 ml
samples from digestions after 0.5, 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, and 24 h
of enzymatic digestion. Samples were filtered using
AG50W × 12 resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd, Hemel
Hempstead, UK) and subsequently dried and re-suspended in 100 μl of deionised water. The samples were filtered using a Millex LH 0.45 μm pored filter (Millipore,
Billerica, USA) and then separated by high-performance
anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a Dionex
Carbopac PA-100 column (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, USA) with integrated amperometry detection. The
separated oligosaccharides were quantified by using external calibration with an equimolar mixture of eleven monosaccharide and oligosaccharide standards (glucose,
cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, cellohexaose, xylose, xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose, and
xylopentaose).

Cell walls for non-cellulosic sugar composition from
grasses and Arabidopsis were extracted from mature stems.
Tissue was subsequently extracted with phenol, chlorophorm:methanol 4:1, 90% DMSO and 100% ethanol. 4
mg of dried material was digested with 2 M trifluoroacetic
acid at 100°C for 4 h. After the acid was evaporated, samples were rinsed with isopropanol and resuspended in
100 μl of deionised water. Samples were filtered and analysed as described below.
For the determination of sugars during pretreatment, samples were taken after 20 min of pretreatment in the presence of 0 and 1% H2SO4at 4, 30, 60 and 90°C.
Monosaccharide analyses were performed by HPAEC
using a Dionex Carbopac PA-10 as described in [25]. Samples (1.4 ml) were collected immediately after pretreatment and filtered using a column of Dowex 1 × 2 to

eliminate the H2SO4 from the samples. The monosaccharide standards used for quantification were arabinose,
fucose, galactose, galacturonic acid, glucose, glucuronic
acid, mannose, rhamnose, and xylose.
