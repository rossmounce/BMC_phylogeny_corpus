FITBAR: a web tool for the robust prediction of
prokaryotic regulons
Jacques Oberto

Abstract
Background: The binding of regulatory proteins to their specific DNA targets determines the accurate expression
of the neighboring genes. The in silico prediction of new binding sites in completely sequenced genomes is a key
aspect in the deeper understanding of gene regulatory networks. Several algorithms have been described to
discriminate against false-positives in the prediction of new binding targets; however none of them has been
implemented so far to assist the detection of binding sites at the genomic scale.
Results: FITBAR (Fast Investigation Tool for Bacterial and Archaeal Regulons) is a web service designed to identify
new protein binding sites on fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. This tool consists in a workbench where the
significance of the predictions can be compared using different statistical methods, a feature not found in existing
resources. The Local Markov Model and the Compound Importance Sampling algorithms have been implemented
to compute the P-value of newly discovered binding sites. In addition, FITBAR provides two optimized genomic
scanning algorithms using either log-odds or entropy-weighted position-specific scoring matrices. Other significant
features include the production of a detailed genomic context map for each detected binding site and the export
of the search results in spreadsheet and portable document formats. FITBAR discovery of a high affinity Escherichia
coli NagC binding site was validated experimentally in vitro as well as in vivo and published.
Conclusions: FITBAR was developed in order to allow fast, accurate and statistically robust predictions of
prokaryotic regulons. This feature constitutes the main advantage of this web tool over other matrix search
programs and does not impair its performance. The web service is available at http://archaea.u-psud.fr/fitbar.

Background
In every living organism, the binding of regulatory proteins to their specific DNA targets accounts for the accurate transcription modulation and expression of the
neighboring genes. The prediction, in silico, of new transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is a key aspect of
the deeper understanding of gene regulation. The discovery of regulons, sets of functionally related and coregulated genes scattered throughout the genome, is of
great importance for the geneticist. However, the exponentially growing number of fully sequenced genomes,
especially prokaryotic, has turned the prediction of regulons into a daunting task. Several reviews compare the
algorithms that have been developed to address the identification of TFBSs [1-5]. These programs can be subdivided into two main classes. In the first class, DNA

Microbiologie, 91405 Orsay, France

binding sites are predicted in a limited amount of short
sequences where a particular regulation is known to
occur but without prior knowledge on the binding site
sequence itself. These de novo search algorithms detect
over-represented or non-random information pertaining
to binding sites by the means of probabilistic approaches
such as Gibbs sampling, hidden Markov models and their
variations. In the second category of programs, binding
sites can be predicted on DNA sequences of any length.
The only prerequisite in this case is a list of known binding sites sharing the same biological properties, determined experimentally. These properly aligned sequences
define the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), a flexible representation of the binding motif [6]. PSSMs have
been widely used to detect motifs in DNA or protein
sequences [7]. Unlike probabilistic de novo approaches,
PSSM search programs are not limited by the size or the
number of the DNA sequences and are therefore particularly well suited to scan entire genomes and predict

regulons. The program ScanAce constituted the initial
implementation of a PSSM DNA search tool; it involved
the manual handling of DNA sequence files and required
program execution on the local system shell exclusively
[8]. Novel scanning algorithms such as QPMEME [9] or
OPENFILL/SCANGEN [10] based on the estimate
sequence-specific binding energy of a given transcription
factor have been reported. However, these computing
techniques do not seem to solve the problem of the false
negatives [10]. Furthermore, QPMEME fails to find a
solution on datasets containing many low affinity
sequences [11]. More recently, the availability of a large
and growing number of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes triggered a regain in interest for PSSM
searches. These genomic databases permitted the development of web services such as MAST [12], RSA Tools
[13], PredictRegulon [14], PRODORIC Virtual Footprint
[15] and RegPredict [16] to grant easier access to genome-wide regulon prediction. Unfortunately, the results
of existing PSSM genomic scanning programs rely on the
choice of an arbitrary threshold value. A low threshold
may detect a large number of false positive sites whereas
a high threshold may fail to produce any meaningful
result. The MAST web service can produce TFBS Pvalues but only analyzes intergenic regions; furthermore,
its results are not computed in real time. Despite the fact
that a considerable progress has been made in assessing
the statistical significance in biological sequence analysis
[17], the interactive prediction of regulons using probabilistic methods remains a computationally intensive
task and appropriate computer programs are not available. To address this problem, I have developed FITBAR
(Fast Investigation Tool for Bacterial and Archaeal Regulons), a real-time PSSM scanning web tool for completely
sequenced prokaryotic genomes. FITBAR is designed as a
high-performance workbench providing two algorithms
for the detection of new binding sites in combination
with two methods to calculate their P-values. This web
service aims to assist the experimentalist with the discovery and characterization of new prokaryotic regulons.

Implementation
Web service and database implementation

The FITBAR web service is developed in the C# language
and ASP.NET web scripting language. The application is
deployed on a server equipped with two quad-core AMD
Opteron 8378 processors clocked at 2.4 Ghz and 8 GB of
RAM. The operating system is Windows Server 2008
RC2. The service is freely accessible from any operating
system/internet browser combination at the URL http://
archaea.u-psud.fr/fitbar. All computations and predictions are executed interactively in real time. The server
stores over 200 consensus prokaryotic binding sites
matrices collected from Harvard University http://arep.

Page 2 of 10

med.harvard.edu/ecoli_matrices/ and from RegTransBase
http://regtransbase.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/regtransbase. Alternatively, user-defined matrices in Fasta or raw format can
be submitted as well. FITBAR genomic databases are
stored on the server and provide access to the publicly
available complete genomes of Bacteria and Archaea. An
accessory program enables the daily automated update of
the database from the repository of the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.
gov/genbank/genomes/Bacteria using the FTP protocol.
Newly sequenced genomes are therefore available within
24 hrs of their public release. Genomes are downloaded
in the GenBank format and parsed to extract the information relevant to FITBAR. These flat file genomic databases are shared with the BAGET web server http://
archaea.u-psud.fr/bin/baget.dll and were described
previously [18]. In addition, for every represented prokaryotic chromosome, the database contains a table of
cumulative mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies used to generate the Markov models. This table is
computed once, each time a new chromosome is added
to the database. The generation of reports in Portable
Document Format (PDF) is achieved using the opensource PDFsharp library http://www.pdfsharp.net/
PSSM scanning algorithms

Two methods have been described to score candidate
sequences for their similarities to known binding sites
using position specific scoring matrices. The nucleotide
distribution frequencies at each position are computed
from an aligned series of biologically defined binding
sites. These frequencies can then be transformed using
either the log-odds [19] or the entropy-weighted [20]
algorithms to generate the PSSM. Query sites are then
matched against the PSSMs by summing up the score at
each corresponding position. In this work, both logodds and entropy-weighted search algorithms have been
implemented as optimized multithreaded routines in
order to scan both DNA strands simultaneously and to
take advantage of multi-core processors. For compatibility purposes, the scores obtained with the two scanning
algorithms are normalized to 1.0 according to the best
theoretical binding site deduced from the PSSM.
Compound Importance Sampling

The methodology to calculate P-values using the compound importance sampling has been described [21].
This variance-reduction technique of Monte Carlo estimators can be used as an efficient alternative to naïve
direct simulation [17]. Briefly, each genomic query
requires the generation of 10 compounds containing
respectively 9986, 7732, 5987, 4636, 3590, 2780, 2153,
1667, 1291 and 1000 samples. The samples consist of
Markov chains generated using the null model and

Oberto BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:554
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/554

mixed with samples from the consensus sites, in a mixing ratio that varies linearly from 0 to 1. Each sample is
scored against the consensus motif and the results are
compiled to generate a distribution. The cumulated frequencies of this distribution allow the calculation of the
P-value, for each score. Since the compounds contain
samples from the user-specified consensus sites, they
need to be computed at query time. The background
model is constituted by third-order Markov chains generated at query time using the pre-calculated chromosome-specific mono- to tetranucleotide frequencies from
the database. The Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons was not be used in this implementation
due the large number of repetitions involved in the
scanning of entire genomes. The CIS algorithm
was implemented in FITBAR according to the description in the original article and additional information
(T. Kaplan, pers. comm.).
Local Markov Model

The Local Markov Model uses an efficient algorithm
based on probability-generating functions to compute the
P-value of candidate binding sites [22]. Briefly, the candidate binding site sequences are first scored by PSSMs then
submitted to filtering. For this implementation, a different
filtering heuristics was developed (Figure 1). It takes into
account the distribution of predicted TFBS score values
which is more dispersed for the log-odds than for the
entropy-weighted method. The same behavior was
observed for all PSSM tested (data not shown). The

P-value of the pre-selected sites are computed against a
null model based on the local genomic context. This null
model or background distribution is constituted by a second-order Markov chain computed on the basis of a 1000
nucleotide segment surrounding the predicted binding
site, excluding the actual binding sequence. This P-value
algorithm is limited to PSSMs with an informational content > 12 bit. The LMM algorithm in FITBAR consists of
a C# implementation based on the original C++ source
code [22].
Sequence logo

A PSSM can be represented under the form of a
sequence logo pictogram showing the consensus
sequence, the relative frequency of bases and the informational content (measured in bit) [23]. Sequence logos
were originally developed with the PostScript description language and fonts. In the present implementation,
the processing overhead imposed by the PostScript language was eliminated by using a more efficient OpenType font rendering. This implementation includes a
small sample correction to avoid underestimation of the
entropy for query datasets composed of a limited
amount of sequences [24].

Results and Discussion
In spite of the number of existing software tools to identify specific DNA binding sites for regulatory proteins
[25,26], the continuous development of new programs
illustrate the fact that the optimal TFBS prediction

system is not available yet. The prediction of regulons
remains a non-trivial and time consuming task for the
experimentalist, especially for the analysis of the large
and growing number of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. A common limitation of the existing PSSM
search programs reside in the selection mechanism for
the newly detected binding sites. It is achieved mainly by
discarding sites presenting a PSSM similarity score below
an arbitrary threshold value. With the naive assumption
that prediction errors accumulate proportionally to the
length of the scanned DNA sequence, the validity of
PSSM searches over an entire genome is questionable in
the absence of a proper statistical analysis. On the other
hand, the elimination of false positives by classical statistical methods is inadequate for real time analysis. For an
average sized prokaryotic chromosome, this correction
would exceed, by two to three orders of magnitude, the
computing time required for the initial genome scan [21].
The FITBAR web service was developed to bring a solution to this problem by providing an interactive and statistically significant prediction of DNA binding sites at
the genomic scale.
General features

The FITBAR web tool was developed in C# and the
choice of this particular language was motivated by its
performance over other commonly used programming
languages. Memory usage and the reading of large
sequence files is more efficient in C# than Java; the
speed of execution is nearly as fast as C and C++ and
6 × faster than Perl and Python [27]. The web service
consists of dynamic web pages compatible with all current internet browsers and operating systems. FITBAR
relies on the same genomic databases as the BAGET
web tool [18]. The data files are stored locally to
increase performance and undergo a daily automated
update from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) repository (see Implementation). In
order to select individual chromosomes, the user is provided with a list of bacterial and archaeal species names.
Organism names have been appended the C1, C2, etc,
suffixes when they harbor multiple replicons. The only
external data required by FITBAR consist of an aligned
series of known binding sites which can be copy-pasted
directly in the appropriate text area. Alternatively, binding sites can be selected from the local database providing over 200 known prokaryotic matrices. FITBAR will
generate a PSSM consensus and search a selected chromosome for additional sites using the log-odds or
entropy-weighted algorithms. Queries can be conducted
on entire chromosomes or restricted to intergenic
regions. The statistical significance of potential binding
sites can be assessed either by the Local Markov Model
or Compound Importance Sampling algorithms (see

Page 4 of 10

next section). If the query is successful, FITBAR will
provide a graphically-rich report composed of four
parts. (1) The first panel details chromosome and query
sites statistics in addition to the user-selected scanning
and P-value methods (Figure 2A). (2) A sequence logo
permits a visual quantization of the informational content at every nucleotide of the query PSSM [23] (see
Implementation). (Figure 2B). (3) A map drawn to scale
permits to evaluate rapidly the predicted binding sites
distribution on the entire chromosome (Figure 2C). (4)
The binding site list details, for every predicted target,
its chromosomal position, orientation, score, P-value,
DNA sequence and detailed genomic context graphical
map over 10 KB; in addition it provides, for each potential regulated gene, a link to the encoded function at the
NCBI database (Figure 2D). FITBAR search results can
be either printed or exported in Excel. CSV format for
further elaboration and in portable document format for
storage or device-independent high-resolution printing.
Statistical significance of the newly predicted sites:
P-value algorithms

The principal objective of FITBAR is to predict statistical significant TFBSs. This significance is commonly
assessed by computing a P-value which measures the
probability of its stochastic occurrence. P-values can be
calculated either with analytic expressions describing the
score distributions or alternatively by simulation; several
efficient algorithms have been proposed for both
approaches [17]. For the present work, two P-value algorithms were retained: the Compound Importance Sampling (CIS) [21] and Local Markov Model (LMM) [22]
(see Implementation for a description). The first criteria
that motivated this choice was the background model
used by the algorithms. Both rely on Markov (of order
m ≥ 2) models for the null distribution which have been
shown to represent accurately biological DNA sequences
[22,28]. This observation is particularly relevant to
prokaryotic genomes where the sequence composition
varies considerably. It has been reported that the GCcontent ranges from 23.7% in Mycoplasma bovoculi to
69.5% in Pseudomonas pseudomallei [29]. The second
criteria was the speed of execution since fast algorithms
would be better suited for an interactive web service.
Finally, it seemed worthwhile to compare the efficiency
of analytical and simulation methods. The two algorithms were adapted to the FITBAR web service as
follows. The implementation of CIS was straightforward:
it is executed once per genome/query and a unique
P-value is assigned to each possible PSSM score before
the actual genome scan. FITBAR therefore evaluates the
PSSM significance at each genomic position and retains
the candidate sites below a cutoff P-value (see next section). The LLM algorithm is based on the local genomic

context and requires therefore the calculation of a specific background distribution for each potential site. In the
original description, this computation-intensive task is
restricted to the top 0.1% candidate sites based on their
PSSM similarity scores [22]. This filtering method is
impractical for complete genomes as it could require an
excess of 10 4 individual background calculations for
large chromosomes. FITBAR uses a different LLM sorting heuristics as shown in Figure 1. It is based on the
query binding site statistics and on the difference in
score distribution between the entropy-weighted and
log-odds screening algorithms (see next section). A
further restriction has been imposed on degenerated
PSSMs with a sequence logo informational content < 12

bit which are not considered for the LMM algorithm.
The accuracy of the predictions is also assessed in FITBAR by the calculation of the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) which visualizes the components
of the false discovery rate. More precisely, the Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
(AUROC), a common summary statistic proportional to
the quality of a predictor in a binary classification task
[30], is provided for each PSSM search.
Benchmarking and experimental validation

The principal aim of FITBAR is to predict and rank
TFBSs by their P-value. This feature is not found in
other PSSM scanning programs and it was therefore

Oberto BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:554
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/554

important to contribute to its development. Since the
two selected P-value algorithms were developed originally to analyze short sequences, their performance was
tested extensively for genomic scanning and one of
these experiments is detailed below. Necessary adjustments were performed to allow the prediction of statically significant TFBS on complete chromosomes.
Benchmarking tests were conducted as follows to illustrate the performance and functionality of FITBAR and
to compare it to other available genomic PSSM scanning
tools. The Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 genome was
screened for potential binding sites for the transcriptional
regulator NagC involved in N-acetylglucosamine metabolism. The query sites are shown in Table 1 and consisted
of known NagC operator sequences compiled from [31]
and J. Plumbridge (pers. comm.).
Since FITBAR allows two user-selectable DNA scanning algorithms (log-odds or entropy-weighted) and two
user-selectable P-value algorithms (LMM or CIS), the
four combinations were analyzed and the results are
detailed in Table 2. It can be seen that globally, the
entropy-weighted and log-odds screening methods
yielded similar results even if the score values were
more dispersed for the log-odds algorithm. A simulation
was carried out to verify this behavior with a collection
of 108 random sites modeled with third-order Markov
chains. The distribution of log-odds scores was nearly
symmetrical whereas the entropy-weighted distribution
showed a positive skew (Figure 3A). The observed difference in score dispersion is therefore due to the PSSM
scanning algorithms. Interestingly, the entropy-weighted
scanning was able to find additional sites not detected
by log-odds. They correspond to a strong site between
ddlA and iraP, and weaker sites such as those upstream
tdk, hns, aer, patA and others.
FITBAR was then compared to other available web
servers such as RSA Tools [13], PRODORIC Virtual
Footprint [15] and RegPredict [16]. The PredictRegulon
web service was taken offline during this work and

could not be tested. It appears that the results obtained
by Virtual Footprint closely resemble FITBAR log-odds
predictions (Table 2). Surprisingly, the highly ranking
site located between nanC and fimB was not detected
by RSA Tools and RegPredict. Another site, upstream
galP, was detected by FITBAR, Virtual Footprint and
RegPredict but was absent from RSA Tools predictions.
Experimental data from several reports corroborate the
regulatory role of these particular sites. First, repression
of nanC and fimB divergent transcripts by NagC has
been observed both in vivo and in vitro [32]. More
recently, we were able to demonstrate by in silico genome screening followed by a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches that galP transcription is
strongly repressed by NagC [33]; this finding provides a
rationale for the better growth of E. coli nagC mutants
on galactose [34]. These results show that the detection
sensitivity of FITBAR equals or surpasses that of existing tools.
The use of two independent P-value algorithms, in
combination with the biological data described above
was instrumental in the reciprocal validation of the cutoff P-values. In the original descriptions of the CIS [21]
and LLM [22] algorithms, the elimination of false positives is recommended for sites with a theoretical P-value
above 10-3 and 2 × 10-4, respectively. The benchmarking
test shows that the LMM and CIS P-values differed significantly for each predicted site, up to several orders of
magnitude (Table 2). Such variations in P-values for
each predicted site were expected: they are due to the
method used to model randomness in the P-value estimation procedures [17]. In this particular situation, they
reflect presumably the impact of general versus local
background distribution models. At this stage, it was
important to compare the P-values obtained with CIS
and LMM to those computed using a classical but
slower method. Separate P-values were calculated for
the 108 random samples in the above mentioned simulation using the log-odds and entropy-weighted scanning
algorithms. Similarly to the PSSM scores, the P-values
varied notably according to the genome scanning algorithm (Figure 3B). Simulated P-values could therefore be
assigned to each predicted NagC operator in Table 2 to
allow comparison between the different methods. Interestingly, all simulated entropy-weighted P-values were
comprised between the corresponding LMM and CIS Pvalues and always within two orders of magnitude from
LMM; on the other hand simulated and CIS P-values
differed by five logs or less (Figure 4A). The difference
between the simulated log-odds P-values and the LMM
or CIS P-values never exceeded two orders of magnitude
(Figure 4B). These results enabled the determination of
the cutoff P-values to discriminate against false positives.
In general, it was necessary to retain higher cutoff values

Figure 3 Simulation-based P-value estimation. A collection of 108 sites 23 nt-long were generated as third-order Markov chains using the
E. coli nucleotide frequencies. The sites were then matched to the consensus shown in Table 1 with the entropy-weighted and log-odds
algorithms. The respective score distribution are shown in Panel A. The P-values were estimated on the basis of the cumulated score
distributions as shown in Panel B.

than those recommended in the original CIS and LMM
descriptions. The CIS cutoff P-values for the CIS
method were set to 0.04 for the log-odds and 0.065 for
the entropy-weighted algorithms. Corresponding
P-values of 0.018 and 0.044 for the NagC operator
upstream galP fit quite well within the cutoff values. A
LMM cutoff P-value of 2 × 10 -3 was retained for the
log-odds scanning method which accommodates the
value for 0.0012 for galP. In the case of the entropyweighted method, the observed LMM P-values after filtering were all lower than the recommended cutoff of
2 × 10-4. It would be interesting to analyze the biology

of some of the weaker detected sites such as upstream
tdk or hns to verify these findings.
The efficiency of FITBAR was compared to that of
existing PSSM search web tools by measuring the
respective response times from a network address outside the servers domains. The results indicated that
FITBAR performance equals or exceeds to that of comparable tools and most importantly, that the calculation
of the P-values does not impair significantly the general
performance (Table 2). Finally, it is worth mentioning
that the time required to calculate P-values by simulation exceeds by two to three orders of magnitude the

A) or log-odds (Panel B) genome scanning algorithms.

time required by the CIS and LMM algorithms (Table
2).

Conclusions
Current genomic TBFSs scanning programs do not provide P-values for the predicted sites and existing P-value
computing algorithms have not been applied to the scanning of entire genomes in real time. In response to the
gap in the available bioinformatics software, FITBAR was
implemented as a performing workbench to assist experimentalists with the identification of regulons in prokaryotic genomes. The prediction of novel protein binding
sites is achieved by a user-selectable combination of optimized sequence scanning and P-value calculation algorithms. In addition, this web tool presents a number of
improvements. A rich user-friendly graphical interface
presents a sequence logo for the query sites and precise
genomic context map for each TFBS. The manual handling of large sequence files and cryptic parameter tweaking are eliminated. General performance equals or
exceeds that of existing score-based PSSM scanning
resources. Recently, FITBAR has been used to identify, in
the E. coli genome, new high affinity targets for the Nacetylglucosamine repressor, NagC; the validity of the in
silico predictions was confirmed by exhaustive genetic
and biochemical evidence [33]. The effortless access to
the prokaryotic genomes database, updated daily, permits
the analysis of phylogenetically related organisms to validate regulon predictions. Finally, the annotation of new
genomes and transcriptomic projects might benefit from
this tool as well.
