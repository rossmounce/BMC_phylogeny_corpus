Abstract
Background: Numerous DNA microarray hybridization experiments have been performed in
yeast over the last years using either synthetic oligonucleotides or PCR-amplified coding sequences
as probes. The design and quality of the microarray probes are of critical importance for
hybridization experiments as well as subsequent analysis of the data.
Results: We present here a novel design of Saccharomyces cerevisiae microarrays based on a
refined annotation of the genome and with the aim of reducing cross-hybridization between related
sequences. An effort was made to design probes of similar lengths, preferably located in the 3'-end
of reading frames. The sequence of each gene was compared against the entire yeast genome and
optimal sub-segments giving no predicted cross-hybridization were selected. A total of 5660 novel
probes (more than 97% of the yeast genes) were designed. For the remaining 143 genes, crosshybridization was unavoidable. Using a set of 18 deletant strains, we have experimentally validated
our cross-hybridization procedure. Sensitivity, reproducibility and dynamic range of these new
microarrays have been measured. Based on this experience, we have written a novel program to
design long oligonucleotides for microarray hybridizations of complete genome sequences.
Conclusions: A validated procedure to predict cross-hybridization in microarray probe design
was defined in this work. Subsequently, a novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae microarray (which
minimizes cross-hybridization) was designed and constructed. Arrays are available at Eurogentec S.
A. Finally, we propose a novel design program, OliD, which allows automatic oligonucleotide design
for microarrays. The OliD program is available from authors.

Background
DNA array-based technologies enable the determination
of thousands gene expression patterns in a single experiment [1]. Such technologies involve either (i) the in situ
synthesis of oligonucleotides using photochemical techniques or ink-jet oligonucleotide synthesizer [2,3], or (ii)
the "spotting" of presynthesized DNA molecules or oli-

gomers on glass slides or filter membranes [4,5]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a large number of genome-wide
expression analysis have already been performed [6,7].
Two DNA chip formats are currently in wide use in S. cerevisiae: the PCR product microarrays made from entire
coding sequences (CDS) or synthetic oligonucleotide
microarrays made from either short (20–25 mers) or long

(60–70 mers) oligonucleotides. In all cases, microarrays
contain probes for all computer predicted-CDS from the
original yeast sequence.
Seven years after the complete sequencing of the S. cerevisiae genome [8], several studies have refined the original
annotation of the yeast genome and identified new genes
[9]. Those studies involve computational methods
[10,11], comparative methods [12–14], transposon tagging [15] and expression profiling combined with mass
spectroscopy of proteins [16].
Compared to the numerous improvements in microarray
data analysis and clustering methods [17–19], the problem of cross-hybridization between genes of a given
organism has rarely been addressed so far. An automated
approach (ProbeWiz) to design PCR products with minimal homology to other expressed sequences from a given
organism was reported [20]. In this algorithm, the PCR
primer sets are evaluated according to the sum weight of
three penalty parameters (paralogy, primer quality and 3'
proximity penalties) out of which the chances of crosshybridization must be deduced by the user. Moreover,
softwares for genome-scale PCR primer or oligonucleotide design (PrimerArray, OligoArray and OligoPicker)
were recently published [21–23]. These programs compute gene-specific and secondary structure-free oligonucleotides for microarray construction.
Here, we describe a novel design of microarray probes
based on a refined definition of S. cerevisiae genes and the
analysis of their potential cross-hybridization. The
dynamic range, sensitivity and reproducibility of results
using this novel design was assessed and the actual crosshybridization was experimentally examined. Following
the experimental validation of our cross-hybridization
procedure, we have written a novel program, OliD, which
allows the automatic design of long oligonucleotides for
microarray hybridization experiments.

Results
Establishing the list of protein coding sequences in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae useful for microarray analysis
Most microarrays commonly used until now were
designed according to the initial yeast genome annotation
which included about 6200 protein coding genes [8,24].
The S. cerevisiae coding sequences (CDS) were originally
predicted using, as primary criteria, their size (> = 100
codons from ATG to stop) and ignoring all reading frames
entirely included within longer ones [25]. Additional criteria such as the codon adaptation index, CAI [26] were
sometimes used, in particular to identify short CDS without obvious similarity or to estimate the likelihood of partially overlapping CDS. Shorter CDS were considered only
when previously described or when their predicted prod-

uct showed similarity in public databases. In addition,
original annotations were not carried out uniformly for all
chromosomes (e.g. chromosome I annotations [27] differed from chromosome VIII [28]).
Before starting the design of the novel microarray probes,
we reviewed the entire yeast genome sequence and established a novel list of S. cerevisiae CDS. A first working list
(6252 CDS) was composed of all predicted CDS exceeding 99 codons which are not entirely included within
longer CDS and do not overlap other defined elements
such as tRNA genes, LTRs, … plus novel short CDS identified by comparative genomics in the Genolevures project
[13]. This list includes 993 partially overlapping CDS
(83% of them are in antiparallel orientation excluding
frameshift sequencing errors), most of which resulting
from over-prediction and/or mirror effects as judged by
the fact that 58% of them do not show similarity with
other hemiascomycete yeasts. In 449 cases (see additional
data file 1), a clear-cut distinction between the two partially overlapping CDS was obtained by comparing their
translation product against our Genolevures data set. In
such cases, one CDS (conserved in the list) showed similarity to sequences of several other yeast species whereas
its partner (eliminated from the list) remained entirely
devoid of homolog. A final list of 5803 CDS is used for the
present microarray design. This list includes 93 partially
overlapping CDS that are real genes or could not be
resolved based on similarity results.
Design of microarray probes
Three major considerations lead us to the present probe
design: the attempt to have uniform probe lengths; the
desire to locate probes preferentially near the 3' end of the
CDS; and the desire to eliminate cross-hybridization.
Note that we refer to the spots on the glass slide as probe
and to the sample hybridized to the glass-bound array as
target.
Prediction of potential cross-hybridizing regions within our selected
CDS
In classical hybridization experiments, cross-hybridizing
sequences can be distinguished from identical sequences
by increasing the stringency of hybridization conditions.
In the present case, however, it is not possible to apply the
most stringent conditions for each of the 5803 genes at
the same time. We have examined sequence similarity
between each of the selected CDS and the entire yeast
genome sequence in order to determine the lengths of
possible sequence alignments, the percentage of identity
between them, and therefore the best probe not susceptible of cross-hybridization.

Cross-hybridizations of a CDS with other yeast sequences
may results from (1) a single continuous alignment

exceeding cross-hybridization parameters or (2) from a
discontinuous series of short similarity regions (within
the same subject) appearing as several alignments which
all together exceed the cross-hybridization parameters
(Figure 1 and "Methods"). This last situation is of critical
importance because a previous study [29] suggests that
short regions of sequence identity spread over the entire
length of a probe may result in cross-hybridization artefacts in cDNA microarrays. This type of alignments was
found in 17.6% and 5.1% of cases when comparing entire
CDS to other coding sequences and intergenic regions,
respectively. Such cases were treated as described in
"Methods".
In order to predict cross-hybridizing regions in each CDS,
three parameters were combined. The alignment size (AS)

threshold was set to 50 nt, based on predicted melting
temperatures [30] with an average GC content of 39%, as
in the S. cerevisiae genome. The percentage of identity (ID)
was set to 70% based on previous studies in Escherichia coli
[31] (52% GC content) and in Arabidopsis thaliana [32]
(40% GC content). Finally, a longest contiguous perfect
match segment (LC) of 30 nt was considered sufficient for
cross-hybridization.
Using above criteria, 4523 (78%) of yeast CDS are not
expected to show cross-hybridization with any other transcript from the yeast genome. In such cases, the corresponding probes could be easily designed in the preferred
region (as described below). For the remaining 1280 CDS,
cross-hybridizations are expected with other CDS (841),
with intergenic regions (191), or with both simultane-

ously (248) (Table 1). In such cases, designed probes were
selected to avoid the cross-hybridizing region(s) as far as
possible (see below).
Probe design (made of PCR products (4972 cases) or oligonucleotides (831 cases)) predicts that 5660 CDS
(97.5% of the total) should be free of cross-hybridization.
This is a gain of 1137 CDS compared to full-length probes
often used in other arrays. For example, HXT2
(YMR011w), a high-affinity hexose transporter is known
to share high amino acid sequence identity with other
members of the same family [33]. At the nucleic acid level,
we found that YMR011w has potential cross-hybridizing
regions with all the other 15 members of the hexose family: HXT1; HXT3-12; HXT14-16 as well as with YLR081w,
the gene encoding the GAL2 protein. In a previous study,
the HXT2 transcript signal could not be determined
because of high sequence similarity with the other hexose
transporter genes [34]. In this work, our designed probe
for HXT2 does not show cross-hybridization with members of the same family (see also Additional file: 7).
No non cross-hybridizing probes could be designed for
the 143 remaining CDS (2.5% of the total). Among them,
9 cross-hybridize with intergenic sequences and the 134
others with CDS only or with both CDS and intergenic
sequences (Table 1). The complete list of such CDS as well
as their putative cross-hybridizing sequences is given by
the additional data file 2.
Designed primers and corresponding PCR products
From the previously defined non cross-hybridizing
regions, 4972 pairs of primers were designed to generate
PCR products as probes (see additional data file 3). The
average GC content of the designed primers is 47.8%. As
far as possible, reverse primers were selected for their
proximity to the 3'-end of each gene. This feature was chosen because, in most experiments, the hybridizing target
will be prepared by reverse transcription with oligo(dT)primed mRNA. Distances between the reverse primer and
the stop codon is less than 100 nt for 62% of the CDS and
less than 300 nt for 94% of the CDS. Reverse primers were
selected at greater distances from the stop codon in 316
remaining cases, due to the presence of putative cross-

hybridizing regions near the 3'-end of these CDS. The forward or reverse primers were selected in the 5'- or 3'untranslated regions (UTR) in 37 CDS because their non
cross-hybridizing regions were shorter than 300 nt and
located in the 5- or 3' regions of the CDS (see additional
data file 4). Attention was placed not to overlap the next
CDS.
Minimal size of the PCR products was limited to 300 bp
because it was previously reported that small genes (<300
nt) often showed lower intensity signals in hybridization
experiment [31]. Average size of our PCR product set is
521 bp. The GC content of the designed PCR probes range
from 20 to 62 % (with an average of 40.6) compared to 20
to 59% (with an average of 40%) for entire yeast CDS.
PCR amplification of yeast DNA using the above primer
pairs showed good quality products of 98.8% of
experiments.
Long oligonucleotides as probes
For the 831 CDS in which non cross-hybridizing regions
are shorter than 300 nt, we decided to use synthetic 71mer oligonucleotides as probes (see additional data file
5). Using this strategy, we reduced the number of crosshybridizing probes by 688, leaving only 143 CDS in
which cross-hybridization is unavoidable. Oligonucleotide probes were selected within the last 800 nt of each
CDS. They have a melting temperature close to 70°C (as
determined using the melting program [35] with sodium
concentration and nucleic acid concentration in excess set
to 0.825 M and 0.02 M, respectively). Note that 199
selected oligonucleotides partially overlap the 5'- or the
3'-UTR (mainly for short CDS). For each of these oligonucleotides, the sequence in 5' or 3'-UTR is 41 nt and does
not overlap the next CDS.
Sensitivity and specificity of our microarrays
We have determined the sensitivity and specificity of our
microarrays from results of hybridization experiments
described in the next section. Under our experimental
conditions, 82–92% of all probe spots produce detectable
transcript signals i.e. showing Cy3 or Cy5 intensities
higher than the 95% upper limit of the distribution of
empty spot signals. This is indicative of the high sensitivPage 4 of 18

ity of our system. An example (for Cy5 channel) of the
dynamic range and reproducibility of the duplicate measurements of an array is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen,
transcript intensities can be measured over a 3-log range
and the reproducibility of measurements of the two duplicates is high (slope close to 1 with r value of 0.98). Similar
results were obtained for the Cy3 channel (data not
shown).
We also compared hybridization results using arrays from
3 different batches (Batch800, Batch400, and Batch616)
successively prepared in this order. Batch400 gave higher
values for background signals than Batch800 and
Batch616 (Table 2). In our most recent experiments,
which give the best transcript abundance, Batch616 was
used.

We have examined the effects of probe size, GC content,
and position relative to stop codon on signal strength
(case of Cy5 channel). Results of hybridization experiment with ∆ymr011w strain are shown by Figure 3. The
probe size (300–700 bp) has no significant effect on signal although the running average of the intensities ranges
from 2039 to 4145. The same is essentially true for the distance between the probe and the stop codon (except for
very high figures (>1000 nt)). On the contrary, the GC
probe composition shows some influence on intensities,
especially for lower GC as could be expected. As can be
seen, the signal intensity increases with the GC probe
content with a maximun at 44 to 46% GC. Note, however,
the large distribution of values over the entire composition range. Similar results were obtained for the Cy3 channel (data not shown). Moreover, the figure observed in

For all arrays of a given batch, the mean intensity value for each gene was first calculated considering all intensity measurements above 95% of the
background threshold. Distribution of intensities were computed for all genes. Results are described by their medians and means. The transcript
abundance (TA) is the mean intensity of the probe in the batch over mean intensity of the background signal.

∆ymr011w hybridization is the same in other hybridization experiments (data not shown).
Within two independent experiments involving BY4742
(Cy3-labelled) and ∆ydr225w (Cy5-labelled) cDNA, we
compared the oligonucleotide signals to the PCR probe
signals (Table 3). The hybridization signals of oligonucleotides tend to be higher than those of PCR products (e.g.
respective mean values 3512 and 3093 for Cy5 channel,
and 2280 and 2194 for Cy3 channel in experiment B). The
same is not true for median values. Nevertheless, signals
of oligonucleotide spots remain highly significant in comparison to background signals (more than 20 fold in Cy5
channel and more than 6.5 fold in Cy3 channel). In our
experimental conditions, sensitivity (94%) of the oligonucleotide probe spots was similar than the one observed
for the PCR probe spots (95%). In separate experiments
which involved PCR and oligonucleotide probes with
extensions in the 5'- or 3'-UTR, we found that more than
87% of the probe spots produce a detectable signal with
signal ratios over background ranging from 4.8 to 9.5.
Experimental validation of predicted cross-hybridization
profiles
In order to test experimentally our cross-hybridization
predictions, we have used the collection of yeast deletion
mutants. We have first selected a set of probes representative of the various situations encountered with regard to
potential cross-hybridizations (i.e. different alignment
size and different percentage of identity between the
tested probe and the potential cross-hybridizing gene)
(Part I in Table 4 [Additional file: 6] & Table 5 [Additional
file: 7, part II]). Eleven deletants were selected to represent
cases in which the probe shows potential cross-hybridization with only one other coding sequence and the 2 other

deletants (YML113w and YMR011w) to represent cases
with potential cross-hybridization to several other coding
sequences. One deletant (YEL033w) was selected for its
predicted cross-hybridization with an intergenic sequence
and a last one (YNL143c) has putative cross-hybridizing
regions with one coding sequence and 14 intergenic
sequences. Putative cross-hybridizing regions range from
31 to 494 nt with identities higher than 79%. The last 3
deletants (YBR025c, YML072c, and YLR109w) were
selected as negative controls (no putative cross-hybridization).
For each of the 18 different hybridization experiments,
intensities were normalized as described in "Methods"
and the Cy5/Cy3 ratios were calculated for all the probes.
For convenience, values are presented as a normal or a flip
ratio (FR)(see "Methods"). Figure 4 describes the theoretical results expected: a ratio close to 1 or -1 (for a flip ratio)
(with yellow color) should be observed at the spot corresponding to the cross-hybridizing gene (used as control)
whereas the color at the spot corresponding to the tested
gene (deleted gene in mutant) should be either yellow (in
case of cross-hybridization) or green (in case of non crosshybridization). Results are given in Tables 4 (see Additional file: 6, Part II) & 5 (see Additional file 7, Part II). For
each spot, we determined the transcript abundance (given
by TA5 and TA3) by comparing the hybridization signal at
the spot with the average background signal of the array.
In order to allow comparisons between the 18 experiments, we also calculated the mean of the Cy5/Cy3 ratios
(given by Control ratio) for the tested gene in the 17
experiments in which the tested gene is not deleted. As
shown, all values are close to 1 or -1, indicating the homogeneity and reproducibility of experiments (Part III in

Intensities and corresponding background values were computed separately for oligonucleotide and PCR probes. Experiments were done twice
(Exp. A and B) using microarrays from batch J100B. Cy3- and Cy5-labelled cDNA targets were prepared from the total RNA isolated from the
wild-type strain BY4742 and ∆ydr225w, respectively. For each channel, the distribution of intensities for all genes was computed for oligonucleotide
or PCR probe. Results are given by median and mean of the intensities. The transcript abundance (TA) is the mean intensity of probe over mean
intensity of background.

Table 4 (see Additional file: 6) & Table 5 (see Additional
file: 7)).
As expected, our three control genes YBR025c, YML072c,
YLR109w (botton lines in Table 4 - see Additional file: 6)
predicted not to cross-hybridize, show highly negative flip
ratios (-100 to -33.3) at the tested gene spots.
Correspondingly, the transcript abundance in the mutant
(TA5) is significantly lower than in the wild-type (TA3).
For the probes predicted to cross-hybridize with only one
other S. cerevisiae gene, cross-hybridization was observed
for YMR170c, YMR169c, YDR225w, YGR148c, YGL147c,
YBR145w, and YNL143c (flip ratios at the tested spots
range from -2.1 to -1.2) but not for YOL103w, YDR497c,
YGR086c, YJR148w and YLR058c (flip ratios at the tested
spots range from -50 to -9). Note that, with the exception
of YGR148c (missing spot of the putative cross-hybridizing gene YGL031c on our array) and YNL143c (hybridization signal of the putative cross-hybridizing gene
YGR069w below the background signal), ratios at the
cross-hybridizing spots are close to 1 or -1, as expected.
The difference between the first 7 genes (that cross-hybridize) and the last 5 (that do not cross-hybridize) may have
several causes. First, the transcript abundance for the
potential cross-hybridizing gene may, of course, influence

the signal at the tested spots. In our experiments, however,
low and high levels of transcript abundance from the
potential cross-hybridizing gene (given by TA3 and TA5)
were observed in each category, suggesting that this factor
has limited importance. Similarly the alignment size (AS)
does not seem to play a major role (67 to 348 nt for the
probes that do not cross-hybridize compared to 31 to 494
nt for those that do). In contrast, the LC value seems to
play the most important part in our results. If one excepts
YBR145w, LC values for the 6 tested probes which crosshybridize, range from 31 to 187 nt, and for the 5 tested
probes which do not cross-hybridize, from 15 to 24 nt.
The cross-hybridization observed for YBR145w (with a LC
value of 14 nt) is probably due to the high transcript
abundance of the cross-hybridizing gene YMR303c (TA5
of 338).
Results of experiments with the probes (YML113w and
YMR011w) having putative cross-hybridization with
several other yeast genes (Table 5 - see Additional file: 7)
are compatible with the above conclusions in the sense
that YMR011w (whose LC values range from 11 to 20) do
not show cross-hybridization (flip ratio of -16.6) while
YML113w does (LC values from 11 to 32 with a flip ratio
of -1.5).

The cross-hybridization observed for YNL143c (LC of 31
nt) cannot be due to its potential cross-hybridizing gene
(YGR069w) because its transcript level is undetectable.
However, the YNL143c probe also shares 31–34 nt in
common with several intergenic regions with might be
transcribed since some of them are close to the next CDS.
This result suggests that transcripts from intergenic
regions can lead to cross-hybridization, thus validating
our concern to examine cross-hybridization of probe with
intergenic sequences. For the probe YEL033w, however,
the flip ratio of -16.6, indicates an absence of crosshybridization with a possible transcript from the potential
cross-hybridizing intergenic region (position 92686–
92717 on the chromosome 4) that is only 45 nt distant
from the next CDS.
In summary, of all parameters that may interfere with
cross-hybridization results, it seems that LC plays the

most important part. From our data, two different
sequences with LC ≤ 24 should not significantly crosshybridize in regular experiments while sequences with LC
> 24 do. Effect of the transcript abundance of the crosshybridizing gene may of course play some role, in particular when AS and LC are low (i.e. AS of 53 with LC of 14).
Considering all our results, we predict that a total of 5660
probes in our microarray design should be specific for the
selected gene.
Validation of the OliD program
Following the above results, we developed a program
(OliD) that allows the automatic design of
oligonucleotides probe of various size, GC content, or
melting temperature, depending on user-defined input
parameters (see "Methods"). This program has been successfully tested on CDS from S. cerevisiae (data not
shown). From an entry file of 5607 CDS (without intron)

and the specified parameters (oligonucleotide length of
65–70 nt, Tm range of 70–90°C; AS, ID and LC of 50, 70,
and 24, respectively) the OliD program successfully
designed "unique" oligonucleotides for 5332 CDS
(95.1%). Because of their higher similarity with other
sequence regions of the yeast genome, 253 CDS (4.5%)
failed to be represented by a "unique" oligonucleotide
probe. In such cases, the program selects an oligonucleotide with the minimum number of cross-hybridizing
regions and displays the location of the cross-hybridizing
regions. For the remaining 22 CDS (0.4%), no oligonucleotide could be designed because of their short length or
excessive AT-richness.

Discussion
In this work, we designed and experimentally tested a
novel hybridization array for all the 5803 predicted coding sequences (CDS) of S. cerevisiae. Our design differs
from currently used yeast arrays by the list of probes
selected and by our concern to minimize artefactual crosshybridization between related sequences.
The prediction of protein coding genes in S. cerevisiae is
not as simple as it may seem. During the last 7 years, since
the publication of the original sequence [8], corrections
have been introduced in several yeast chromosome
sequences. Although most of them are only minor ones
(except for the chromosome 4), the complete sequence of
chromosome 3 has been entirely re-sequenced (MIPS,
http://mips.gsf.de). In addition, the original sequence
annotation, essentially based on CDS size, resulted in
some degree of over-prediction and under-prediction, due
to that all partially overlapping CDS were considered and
that short coding sequences were avoided, respectively. In
this work, we used the first extensive comparative
sequencing data on different yeast species to address both
problems. A number of novel CDS whose protein products are conserved in other yeast species have been
included, mostly short ones [12,13]. At the same time, a
number of questionable CDS (mostly partially overlapping ones) have been eliminated, resulting in a total of
5803 CDS. Note that a total of 98 partially overlapping
CDS are still included in this set, although we believe that
in most cases, only one of them will correspond to an
actual gene. For those partially overlapping CDS, our
probe design procedure automatically removed the
overlap.
While this work was in progress, other publications
reported the re-annotation of the S. cerevisiae genome,
based on theoretical, comparative or experimental studies. The likelihood of predicted CDS was assessed using
methods such as the three-dimensional space curve (Z
curve) or the dinucleotide composition, resulting in 5645
CDS or 5300–5400 CDS, respectively [10,11]. The first

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/38

figure is close to 5651 CDS, an estimation based on statistical and comparison analysis with partial sequence data
from a number of other yeast species [36]. Similarly, comparisons with the finished S. pombe genome resulted in an
estimation of a maximum of 5804 real CDS for S. cerevisiae, and it was suggested that 370 others, defined as
totally spurious CDS, should be disregarded [14]. Interestingly, 306 of those CDS were also eliminated in our work.
This indicates a good correlation of results despite the fact
that our approach took into account sequence
comparisons within a less diverged phylogenetic group
(the hemiascomycetes) than S. pombe (an euascomycete).
Similarly, 317 of the unlikely CDS resulting from Z curve
analysis are also eliminated in our work. A number of
experimental methods were recently used to reveal the
presence on non-annotated short CDS. Using an original
transposon-mediated gene trapping associated with
expression analysis and similarity searching, Kumar and
coll. [15] identified 137 previously non-annotated CDS.
Most of those CDS, however, are short ones that are
included in antiparallel orientation into other annotated
CDS or are in subtelomeric locations, and are not in the
present work. By a combination of expression profiling
and mass spectrometry of yeast proteins, 62 novel genes
were proposed [16]. This work also provides independent
experimental support for 13 previously identified genes
[12,13] that are already included in our set of yeast genes.
These new non-annotated genes, treated in our annotation procedure (as described before), revealed that 17
novel non-annotated CDS not considered yet in the
present work could be considered as real genes.
The second major concern of our work was to reduce
cross-hybridization between related yeast sequences. Such
cross-hybridizations can result from (i) duplications of
genes or short repeated sequences (such as di- or trinucleotide arrays) which can be predicted by sequence analysis,
and from (ii) the existence of transcribed sequences
(pseudo-genes, disabled CDS or relics) in intergenic
regions that may resemble to actual gene sequences
[37,38]. In addition, natural transcripts contain 5'- and 3'UTR which, except in a few cases, have not been experimentally determined and therefore correspond to "intergenic" region in databases. These are the reasons why we
have compared the sequences of all predicted CDS with
the entire yeast genome and not only with other coding
sequences.
According to our probe design and its experimental validation using mutants from the systematic deletion
collection, we propose here a complete yeast array in
which each of the 5660 probes is specific for a unique target gene. This represents more than 97% of the actual
yeast CDS. Our experiments showed that, of all sequence
similarity parameters, the LC value plays the most impor-

Page 10 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2003, 4

tant role to determine cross-hybridization. No crosshybridization was observed for LC < = 24. If we use LC >
24 as a limit, 5579 probes (96% of the total) are expected
to be specific for a unique target gene. In an independent
work, cross-hybridization was reported between
sequences sharing more than 15 contiguous identical
nucleotides [39]. Using this more stringent criterion, a
total of 5454 (94% of the total) of our designed probes are
still expected to be specific for a unique target gene. As
expected, other parameters than LC nevertheless plays
some role in cross-hybridization. For example, a sequence
of 162 nt with 81% of nucleotide identity was found sufficient to favour cross-hybridization in our experimental
conditions, an observation which is consistent with earlier
studies [31,32,39]. The expression level (transcript abundance) of the putative cross-hybridizing sequences is also
a determinant. In the case of highly expressed gene such
as YMR303c, cross-hybridization was observed with the
YBR145w probe although the two sequences share only 53
nt segment with 86% identity and a LC of 14.
Despite our probe design protocol, cross-hybridization
could not be eliminated for 143 CDS because they are part
of highly conserved gene families. Only 5 of them are
parts of ancient duplicated chromosome blocks as previously described [40]. For the remaining 650 CDS pairs in
such blocks, our design successfully discriminated each
CDS from its partner(s). One example is provided by the
well-studied yeast gene family encoding the alcohol
dehydrogenases (ADH)[41]. From the five distinct ADH
genes present in S. cerevisiae, ADH1 (YOL086c) and ADH2
(YMR303c) show cross-hybridization with other members of the family. Using our probe, it is now possible to
study individually ADH3 (YMR083w), ADH4 (YGL256w)
and ADH5 (YBR145w) without cross-hybridizations with
the other family members.
In 236 cases (37 PCR products and 199 oligonucleotides),
our probes include extensions into 5'- or 3' intergenic
region flanking the CDS. Hybridization with those probes
has been experimentally verified. Although 5'- and 3'-UTR
have not been determined for all yeast genes, it was previously predicted that in 85–95% of cases, poly(A) sites are
located between 55 and 145 nt after the stop codon of the
CDS [42], a figure which is perfectly consistent with the
fact that the average distance between two converging
CDS is 326 bp [43]. Except in two cases (YBR191wa and
YLR149ca), our probes are entirely included into the predicted 3'-UTR regions. It is, therefore, unlikely that they
will hybridize with transcript from the neighbouring gene.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/38

primers, in which attention was focussed on the uniqueness in the entire yeast genome sequence. Thus, in most
cases, the reverse primers designed (without their common 5'-tag) can also be used to prime the synthesis of the
first strand cDNA target. Although the mRNA priming
with specific reverse primers will shorten the average
length of cDNA, this priming method should increase the
sensitivity of detecting rare mRNAs in samples because
there is no more priming competition between rare
mRNAs and abundant mRNA as it can be observed with
oligo(dT) primers. Therefore, the use of a mixture of
oligo(dT) and specific reverse primers should provide uniform coverage of cDNA target length and should increase
the detection of rare mRNAs.
Another explanation for the absence of cross-hybridization could be that the cross-hybridizing region lies
upstream of a long CDS such that this region is under-represented in our labelled reverse transcriptase-generated
cDNA. This, however, seems unlikely because the distance
from the probe to the stop codon of the corresponding
gene ranges from 18 to 246 nt (for probes showing crosshybridization) and from 38 to 240 nt (for probes not
showing cross-hybridization).
While this work was in progress, two programs that select
oligonucleotides as microarray probes were reported. In
OligoPicker program [23], the cross-hybridization
approach is based on finding the occurrences of contiguous perfect matches. In our approach, we also emphasize
that contiguous base pairing is one of the most important
parameters during the cross-hybridization procedure.
However, we focus on the longest perfect match, which
was experimentally verified as a leading parameter for
cross-hybridization. In the same study [23], the secondary
structure of the selected oligonucleotides was assessed by
calculation of regions that may self anneal, whereas in our
study, prediction of the secondary structures was calculated from the free energy of the oligonucleotide molecule
[44]. Our design follows the same strategy as in the OligoArray algorithm [22], except that it (1) first determines
the non cross-hybridizing regions within the sequence
entry (instead of scanning the sequence to check for oligonucleotide specificity); (2) can computes different oligonucleotide lengths within the same run; and (3) finds the
best oligonucleotide as configured by the user. In addition, the OliD program displays the location of crosshybridizing regions as this information might be useful
during the microarray hybridization analysis.

Conclusions
Compared to other yeast arrays, our design is unique by
the combination of PCR products and long oligonucleotide probes on the same array. The high success rate of
PCR reactions is attributable to our carefully designed

We have described a novel yeast microarray that combines
a refined annotation of S. cerevisiae genome and an experimentally validated method that predicts cross-hybridizing regions between two related sequences. In our

approach, we emphasize that contiguous base pairing is
one of the most important parameters for cross-hybridization, in particular the longest contiguous perfect match
(LC). Our yeast microarray experiments show a suitable
dynamic range, good reproducibility and sensitivity. Since
oligonucleotide-based microarrays are now preferentially
set up, we developed an oligonucleotide design program,
OliD, which allows a user-defined input parameters and
automatic design of long oligonucleotides. Performances
of the OliD program have been successfully evaluated on
a well-established data set.

Methods
DNA sequences and databases
DNA sequences of the 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes were
downloaded from MIPS on February 2001. A set of 5803
protein coding genes (see "Results") was used in this work
and referred to here as the GSC database. The GSC database includes CDS originally described at MIPS plus novel
short CDS discovered in Génolevures [13] or other comparative sequence analysis [12]. All remaining sequences
from S. cerevisiae were considered as "intergenic"
sequences and called GSCIG database. The list of introncontaining CDS was compiled from MIPS, YIDB [45] and
ARES [46] databases. Position and length of trinucleotide
repeats relative to S. cerevisiae CDSs were taken from [47].
Design of DNA probes
Our probe design involves 3 steps as illustrated by Figure
5.
Step1. Detection of non cross-hybridizing regions within coding
sequences
Each sequence (here the entire CDS as query) was first
compared to our GSC database using blastn program (versus 2.1.2) [48] without low complexity filter, in order to
identify potential cross-hybridizing regions. Self-matching scores were ignored. The two possible types of alignments are described in Figure 1. Type2 alignments were
considered as putative cross-hybridizing regions if the following two conditions were simultaneously met: (i) the
successive alignment blocks between the query and subject sequences have the same strand orientation. (ii) Lquery
and Lsubject distances are less than 500 nt and more than -7
nt (cases of partial overlaps). The threshold value of 500
nt was chosen because it corresponds to the average size
of probes to be designed. Overlapping alignment threshold was arbitrary set at 7 nt.

Potential cross-hybridizing regions were identified when
alignments meet one of the following two conditions: (i)
AS > 50 and ID > 70; or (ii) LC > 30, where AS, ID, and LC
are the size, the percentage of identity, and the longest
contiguous perfect match segment in each alignment,
respectively. Note that for Type2 alignments, AS and ID

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/38

were re-calculated globally from extreme coordinates of
blocks. The remaining part of each CDS (without potential cross-hybridizing regions) was retained from subsequent analysis.
After elimination of introns and trinucleotide repeats, all
segments larger than 72 nt were extracted and compared
against our GSCIG database using the same procedure as
above to eliminate potential cross-hybridization with
intergenic regions. After this step, a list of non crosshybridizing regions was obtained for each CDS, among
which our probes were selected. When possible, preference was given to sub-segments of 800 nt in length
selected by their proximity to the 3'-end of the CDS. In
some cases, sequences were extended to the neighbouring
intergenic regions. Based on the size of available non
cross-hybridizing regions two distinct routes were followed (see Figure 5): Step 2 orStep 3.
Step 2. Design of primer pairs
The selected non cross-hybridizing regions were subjected
to primer3 program [49] with the following parameters:
primer length: 20 nt, primer melting temperature range:
56–63°C, and optimum PCR product size: 300–700 bp.
Primer3 was allowed to return up to 10 pairs of primers as
candidates (forward primer or reverse primer designate the
oligonucleotide localized near the start or the stop codon
of the CDS, respectively). Each candidate primer sequence
was first compared to the 16 yeast chromosome sequences
using blastn program without low-complexity filter and W
(word size) set to 14. Primers were considered as "unique"
if no match of 14 nt was found or if matches > = 14 nt
leaves mismatches at the 3'-end. For each CDS, preference
was given to "unique" primers, or those exhibiting minimal size match. Finally, the best primer pair for each CDS
was selected based on the following preferences: (i) an
optimal probe length of 500 bp; (ii) at least one of the two
primers is "unique"; and (iii) position of reverse primer is
as close as possible to the 3'-end of the open reading
frame. In our design, 97.2% of primers were "unique".
Step3. Design of long oligonucleotide probes
For CDS in which the remaining non cross-hybridizing
regions are shorter than 300 nt, no PCR probe was
designed. Instead, 71-mer synthetic oligonucleotides were
synthesized, that met the following criteria: GC content
between 34–46 (optimum 39%); absence of monotonous
hexanucleotides (TTTTTT, CCCCCC, GGGGGG and
AAAAAA); and absence of secondary structures (as
determined using the mfold 2.3 program [44], with temperature set to 68°C).
Oligonucleotide design tool
The OliD program, follows the design strategy described
above, except that monotonous nucleotide sequences are

not excluded. The input sequences are individual exon
sequences in fasta format. The OliD command line allows
the user to define several input parameters such as size,
GC content, and melting temperature of the designed oligonucleotides; the cross-hybridization parameters
(alignment size, percentage of identity and longest contiguous match); the maximal distance from the 3'end of the
sequence; the number of oligonucleotides per input
sequence and the minimal distance between two adjacent
oligonucleotides (if two or more oligonucleotides are
selected).

was done using the same chemistry but the 5'-end is modified by the aryl amino-group NH2- [CH2]6-. All primers
were synthesized by Eurogentec s.a.
PCR amplification reactions were done in two rounds. In
the first round, one hundred-microliter reactions were
performed using each primer pair with the following reagents: 20 ng of S. cerevisiae DNA template, 50 pmoles of
each primer, 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Eurogentec
s.a.), 1 × PCR buffer (Eurogentec s.a.), and 1.8 mM MgCl2.
Thermalcycling was carried out in Gene Amp PCR system
(Applied Biosystems) with 5 min denaturation step at
95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 30 sec at
55°C, 1 min at 72°C, and a final cycle at 72°C for 10 min.
All PCR reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reactions that failed to amplify or show multiple bands were repeated using different conditions (e.g.
higher annealing temperatures) to favour amplification of
the desired product. The second round of PCR amplification follows the same protocol as the first round except for
the use of 5 ng of first round PCR products as templates,
50 pmoles each of forward (with an amino-group NH2[CH2]12- at the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide) and reverse
tag-primers, and the annealing temperature of 45°C. PCR
reactions were purified with 96-well Millipore MultiScreen-FB filters (Millipore), then eluted in a final volume
of 40 µl NaPO4 20 mM, pH 8.0, and stored at -20°C until
use.

Briefly, the program first compares each input sequence
against the genome sequence and predicts all non crosshybridizing regions within the input sequence according
to selected parameters. From these regions, all possible
oligonucleotides that fulfill the user-defined parameters
are listed. Then, an oligonucleotide score is calculated as
the sum of individual score parameters (size, GC content,
and Tm), [Wsize/|D|size + Wgc/|D|gc + WTm/|D|Tm], where W
is the user-defined weight of each parameter, and D is the
difference between the optimum value defined by the user
and the value found for the selected oligonucleotide. |D|
is arbitrary set to 1 if |D| < 1. If the oligonucleotide is not
located within the user-defined position on the entry
sequence, a penalty score is calculated as [P(EntryLen –
PosMax – PosOligo)] where P is the weight position (100000 by default); EntryLen, the length of the sequence
entry; PosMax (user-defined parameter), the maximal distance from the 3'end of which the oligonucleotide should
be designed; and PosOligo, the end position of the
selected oligonucleotide. The penalty score is also added
to the oligonucleotide score. The list of oligonucleotides is
first sorted by their number of cross-hybridizing regions,
then by their scores. Finally, the best oligonucleotides are
chosen. Sequences and user-defined parameters are automatically transferred to intermediate programs (blast,
melting, mfold, etc…) and the results are saved in two output files. The first one is a tabulated spreadsheet table containing the oligonucleotide sequences as well as its
position on the entry sequence and the cross-hybridizing
regions found. The second one contains rejected
sequences with the reasons of rejection. OliD is written in
python 2.2 (with the use of biopython modules) and runs
under all platforms supporting python, blast and mfold programs. OliD is available upon request.

Using the robot SDDC-2 (Engineering Services Inc., ESI),
DNAs (PCR products, 71-mer oligonucleotides, and control genes) were deposited in close duplicates (1 fmol
DNA of PCR product and 10 fmol DNA of long oligonucleotide) onto microarray aldehyde glass slides with 200µm spacing between neighbouring spot centers. Subsequent microarray treatments were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Telechem International).
The microarray view is described in Figure 6. Note that
batches 800, 400, and 616 (prepared successively in this
order from November 2001 to February 2002) used in our
hybridization experiments differ from the final ones
described above, since the probes corresponding to the
genes YBR145w, YDR225w, YEL033w, YGL147c, YGR148c,
YJR148w, YMR011w, YMR169c, YMR170c, and YNL143c
are present in the form of PCR products instead of 71-mer
oligonucleotides.

Microarray preparation
Primer pairs for each of the PCR products selected as
probes were synthesized at 40 nmoles scale using standard cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry method. The
forward and reverse primers are 34–35 nt long (20 nt specific and a common 5'-tag sequence: forward primer-tag:

by PCR amplification. All the deletant strains have normal
growth phenotype.

mRNA preparation, cDNA synthesis and hybridization
For each experiment, freshly grown yeast cells were inoculated into 400-ml glucose-rich liquid medium, grown to
mid log phase (OD600 = 0.5), and total RNA was purified
as described by [51]. Hybridization experiments were performed as described in Figure 4. For each experiment,
about 10 µg of total RNA were converted to labelled cDNA
targets using an indirect labelling kit (Amersham-Pharmacia-Biotech). All experiments were performed using the
same RNA preparation from the wild-type strain BY4742
as reference. The amount of cDNA as well as the incorporation of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes into cDNA targets were quantified by measuring the absorbance of each sample at 260
nm, 550 nm and 650 nm, respectively. For each experiment, labelled-Cy3 and -Cy5 cDNA targets were then
combined in equal amount, vacuum dried (Speed-vac
centrifugation), and re-solubilized in 50 µl hybridization
buffer composed of Dig Easy Hyb solution (Roche diagnostics) with 0.5 mg/ml of salmon sperm DNA. After prehybridization in 50 µl hybridization buffer for 2 h at
42°C, the hybridization was performed with CyDyelabelled cDNA solution at 42°C for approximately 16 h.
Following hybridization, slides were washed twice in 0.1
× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min and finally in 0.1 × SSC for 30s.
Then, slides were immediately dried by centrifugation (2
min at 400 × g).

AS, alignment size

Array data processing
Hybridized microarrays were scanned using a Genepix
4000A fluorescence reader (Axon) with a resolution of 10
µm. Signal quantification for each probe on the microarray was performed with Genepix image acquisition software (Axon). For each experiment, intensity signals of the
ca. 200 empty spots were measured and the 95% upper
confidence interval of these figures was used as the lower
limit for significant measurements. Intensity signals of
duplicated DNA spots were processed independently.
Since the dye bias appears to be dependent on grid location in the array, a "within-print-tip-group"
normalization method [52] was applied. This procedure
corrects the differential rates of incorporation of Cy3 and
Cy5 so that the log2-transformed ratio for each array grid
is close to 0. Fluorescence ratios were computed based on
hybridization signals normalized with background corrections. Ratio below 1.0 was inverted, multiplied by -1
for symmetry to give the flip ratio [FR].

CDS, coding sequence
TA3 or TA5, transcript abundance for Cy3- or Cy5-labelled
cDNA targets, respectively
FR, flip ratio

ID, percentage of identity
LC, longest contiguous perfect match segment
cDNA, complementary DNA
