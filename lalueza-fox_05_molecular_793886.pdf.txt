Abstract
Background: Myotragus balearicus was an endemic bovid from the Balearic Islands (Western
Mediterranean) that became extinct around 6,000-4,000 years ago. The Myotragus evolutionary
lineage became isolated in the islands most probably at the end of the Messinian crisis, when the
desiccation of the Mediterranean ended, in a geological date established at 5.35 Mya. Thus, the
sequences of Myotragus could be very valuable for calibrating the mammalian mitochondrial DNA
clock and, in particular, the tree of the Caprinae subfamily, to which Myotragus belongs.
Results: We have retrieved the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1,143 base pairs),
plus fragments of the mitochondrial 12S gene and the nuclear 28S rDNA multi-copy gene from a
well preserved Myotragus subfossil bone. The best resolved phylogenetic trees, obtained with the
cytochrome b gene, placed Myotragus in a position basal to the Ovis group. Using the calibration
provided by the isolation of Balearic Islands, we calculated that the initial radiation of caprines can
be dated at 6.2 ± 0.4 Mya. In addition, alpine and southern chamois, considered until recently the
same species, split around 1.6 ± 0.3 Mya, indicating that the two chamois species have been
separated much longer than previously thought.
Conclusion: Since there are almost no extant endemic mammals in Mediterranean islands, the
sequence of the extinct Balearic endemic Myotragus has been crucial for allowing us to use the
Messinian crisis calibration point for dating the caprines phylogenetic tree.

Background
Myotragus balearicus [1] was an extremely modified
caprine, endemic of the Balearic Islands, characterized by
a series of unusual apomorphies developed throughout
more than five million years of insular evolution [2-7].
Myotragus disappeared from Mallorca between 3,700 and

2,040 years BC [8], probably after the arrival of the first
humans to the Islands. The morphological peculiarities of
Myotragus, including extreme size reduction, a single ever
growing lower incisor, modified limb bones and frontal
eyes [2], makes it difficult to clarify its taxonomic position
[9].

In two previous studies [10,11], we obtained bits of the
mtDNA cytochrome b gene from two different Myotragus
bone specimens from Mallorca island, one found in cova
Estreta (Pollença) and the other found in Cova des Gorgs
(Escorca). Although the quick radiation of all the Caprinae [12] and the short cytochrome b fragment retrieved
(338 bp) made the previous analysis difficult, our data
indicated that Myotragus was genetically close to the sheep
(Ovis) group.
There is a general agreement that the continental ancestor
of the Balearic bovid possibly settled in Mallorca and
Menorca during the Messinian period. The Balearic
Islands were last connected to the continent during the
Messinian regression, when the Mediterranean basin was
dried out, allowing faunal exchanges between the islands
and the continental lands [13,14]. The opening of the
Strait of Gibraltar 5.35 Mya definitely isolated the Balearic
Islands and promoted the beginning of the independent
evolution of Myotragus [2]. The Myotragus lineage spreads
from the Pliocene to the Holocene, and includes in Mallorca five chronospecies: M. pepgonellae, M. antiquus, M.
kopperi, M. batei and M. balearicus. No absolute datings are
available for the oldest species, M. pepgonellae, although a
chronology of Lower Pliocene has been proposed; a paleomagnetic data of about 2.6 My is available for M. antiquus remains [2]. Apart from two shrews from the islands

96 bp

of Crete and Sicily, respectively, no other Pliocene
endemic mammal persists in Mediterranean islands
[15,16]. Thus, the accurately dated vicariant event that isolated Myotragus from their continental relatives constitutes a unique opportunity to use the sequences of
Myotragus for calibrating the DNA molecular clock of
caprines. Previously, only dates outside caprines (the
emergence of the family Bovidae 18.5 Mya), or dates that
are too recent for accurate estimations (common ancestry
of some domestic sheep breeds a few thousand years ago)
could be used [17,18]. In addition, since the molecular
clock is not perfect, it is necessary to use as much sequence
information as possible to obtain reliable date estimates.
For this purpose, we decided to retrieve the complete cytochrome b gene and some other genetic markers of Myotragus; to do this, we used a newly excavated Myotragus bone,
obtained in 2002 from Cova des Gorgs, that looked macroscopically very well preserved and therefore was suggestive of DNA survival. We designed different sets of
overlapping primers for retrieving the complete cytochrome b gene, as well as a 305 bp fragment from another
mtDNA gene, the 12S. In addition, we retrieved a short
fragment of a nuclear gene, 28S rDNA, from the same
extract. The only precedent of nuclear DNA retrieval from
warm climates is, to our knowledge, the analysis of a
ground sloth coprolite from the south of United States
[19].

Our results confirm that Ovis is the sister group of Myotragus. We also show that the initial radiation of caprines
occurred 6.2 ± 0.4 Mya, more recent than the date
obtained in other analyses that used very different calibration points [17,18]. Finally, we show that the cytochrome
b sequences of alpine and southern chamois, until
recently considered to be subspecies, have been separated
1.6 ± 0.3 Mya, much longer than previously suspected.

Results and discussion
Ancient DNA sequences
The complete 1,143 nucleotides of the cytochrome b gene
were retrieved in seven overlapping fragments (see primers in Table 1), including the 338 base pairs section
between positions 14,312 and 14,649 (using Ovis as reference sequence) already retrieved in a previous work [11]
and a section of 85 bp replicated in Oxford (between positions 14,399 and 14,483) (Table 2). Two discrepancies

with the previous consensus sequences were observed, a T
in position 14,635 and a T in 14,638. The first one was
already reported as heteroplasmic in the cloned PCR
product in [11], where it was present in five up to ten
clones sequenced. The latter was not found in our previous study; therefore, it can correspond to a silent polymorphism within the Myotragus population or to a DNA
damage involving a rare A to T change in that particular
PCR reaction. All cytochrome b fragments were routinely
cloned (not shown), although very few heteroplasmies
were detected in the direct sequencing, attributable to
both the exceptional preservation of the sample and the
short lengths of the fragments; consequently, the error
rate in the clones (number of nucleotide differences/
1,000 base pairs) was very low (< 2 per thousand base
pairs). Considering the overlapping of the primers and the
fragment replicated, 404 bp (around 35% of the cytochrome b gene) have been determined from more than

one PCR. It cannot be discarded that DNA damage could
have affected some positions, although it is unlikely that
this would significantly alter the phylogenetic inferences.
The putative presence of nuclear mtDNA insertions is very
unlikely, since we proceed designing the L primers for the
next fragment in the sequence already retrieved from the
previous fragment, and the H primers in a consensus
Caprinae sequence. The 12S gene sequence (305 base
pairs) was retrieved in three overlapping fragments (see
primers in Table 1). The sequences found in 12S showed
several differences from those of extant Caprinae, a fact
that points to its authenticity.
The PCR of the 28S nuclear gene yielded a very faint band
around 140 base pairs and was subsequently cloned and
sequenced. In addition, DNA from tissue samples from
domestic goat (Capra aegagrus), southern chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) and domestic sheep (Ovis aries) was
extracted in a separated laboratory, and the same 28S fragment was determined. The 96 base pairs sequence
obtained from Myotragus is similar to that found in other
Caprinae (Table 3), and clearly different to the human
one and to the cow, a suggested source of contamination
because of the use of BSA (bovine serum albumine) in
ancient DNA amplifications. Moreover, no other Bovids,
extinct or living, had been analyzed in the same laboratory when the extraction, amplification, cloning and
sequencing of the Myotragus genes was undertaken; therefore, the 28S sequence seems to be endogenous of Myotragus. The cloning of the 28S PCR product (Table 3) showed
that two of the sequences (about 20% of the clones) were
human contaminants; this accounts for the noise
observed in the direct sequencing of the PCR product.
Most likely, the human DNA comes from handling of the
Myotragus bones during its excavation and posterior morphological study. Nevertheless, the error rate in the clones
is relatively low (3.07 per thousand base pairs), a figure
within the range found in some modern specimens and
well preserved ancient remains, like the moas [20].
Variation in length is characteristic of 28S gene; size variations are due to expansions or contractions of variable
segments in 10–12 positions within the gene, where variation does not interfere with ribosomal function [21]. The
sequences were aligned by eye; due to the high interspecific variation in 28S, no definite alignment is possible
and therefore, the phylogenetic information obtained
from this gene is limited. However, the retrieval of a
nuclear gene indicates the quality of the DNA of the sample used. Furthermore, it opens new possibilities of
research for assessing the phylogenetic relationships of
Myotragus and for retrieving nuclear genes with phenotypic implications.

Phylogeny of the Caprinae subfamily and the position of
Myotragus in the tree
We included Pantholops hodgsoni in the phylogenetic analysis since previous analysis as well as ours indicate that
this species is clearly associated to other members of the
subfamily Caprinae. As an outgroup, we used 14 members
of the tribes Alcephalini and Hippotragini (see Methods)
previously detected as the closest members within the
Bovidae [17,22]. The cytochrome b and cytochrome b +
12S Bayesian and maximum-likelihood trees (Figure 1)
showed a topology roughly similar to that found in previous studies on Caprinae phylogeny (e.g., [22]). Recently,
it has been reported that the Budorcas cytochrome b
sequence available at GenBank was in fact a chimaera that
included a fragment of Ovis sequence, and a new sequence
for this species was provided [17]. Crucially, in previous
works Myotragus formed a quite stable clade with Budorcas
and Ovis that is not maintained anymore, with Budorcas
now clustering in a different position.

Examination of the cytochrome b trees (Figure 1a and 1b)
shows that some of the clades previously found are
present in these trees, specially Myotragus+Ovis (67.5% in
the
maximum-likelihood
trees),
Capricornis+Ovibos+Naemorhedus (100% in the maximum-likelihood
tree) and Hemitragus+Pseudois+Capra (94.6% in the maximum-likelihood tree). The position of Hemitragus, that
precludes the monophyly of the genus Capra, is problematic, as some authors have already noticed [18]. Some species show unstable positions in the trees, particularly the
genera Budorcas, Ammotragus, Pantholops, Rupicapra and
Oreamnos. The problematic position of these taxa has
been already reported on extant species studies (see, for
instance [22,23]). However, our tree, although still with
low bootstrap values, has been able to better resolve the
phylogenetic position of Myotragus, which is basal to the
Ovis clade; the support value for the Myotragus+Ovis
grouping is now 0.46 in the Bayesian tree and the bootstrap value 67.5% in the maximum-likelihood tree,
respectively [11].
The trees with the cytochrome b + 12S fragment (305 base
pairs) did not significantly improve the phylogeny (Figure
1c and 1d); the Capricornis+Ovibos and Hemitragus+Pseudois+Capra clades are well supported by bootstrap analysis, while the support of the cluster of Myotragus+Ovis is
reduced with respect to the cytochrome b sequence alone.
This discrepancy can be attributed to the small number of
informative positions added by the 12S fragment together
with the reduced number of species that could be used
due to the unavailability of the 12S sequence in many species.

Evolutionary rates and diversification of Caprinae
The complete resolution of the Caprinae phylogeny cannot be achieved with the cytochrome b gene alone, as
some species of the subfamily (specially of the genera
Budorcas, Oreamnos, Rupicapra, Ammotragus and Pantholops) still have an unstable position. It is likely that the lack
of resolution in the basal branches is due to the existence
of a very quick initial radiation in the Caprinae subfamily.
To test this, we performed a likelihood ratio test for zero
branch-length of all branches of the tree, that showed that
there are nine branches with p > 0.05 (and therefore, not
significantly different from 0). Five of them belong to the
basal branches of the Caprinae tree, thus supporting the
hypothesis of a very fast initial radiation of this group.
Additionally, the plot of grow of lineages of an ultrametric
tree (see below) also supports this fast initial radiation.

Being Myotragus a small caprine, its long branch in the
maximum-likelihood tree previously detected with a cytochrome b fragment [11] was attributed to an earlier age of
first reproduction and a shorter generation time in Myotragus than in other wild caprines [11]. This long branch is
also present in the trees of the complete cytochrome b
(Figure 1a and 1b). However, recent estimates indicate
that Myotragus was actually bigger than previously
believed, with a weight ranging between 15 and 25 kg for
the smallest adult specimens and between 40 and 60 kg
for the larger specimens [24]. Therefore the reason for this

long branch cannot be due to its presumed extreme
reduced size (and the consequences that this involves).
On the other hand, the hypothesis that tries to explain differences in evolutionary rates as due to differences in metabolic rate or generation time (both correlated to body
mass) was not supported in the analysis of cytochrome b
evolutionary rates of a wide set of mammalian species
[25]. It is thus more likely that this relatively long branch
of Myotragus in the Caprinae tree is mainly a stochastic
phenomenon.
Dating of the Caprinae phylogeny
Due to the endemicity of Myotragus [2], it can be hypothesized that this lineage diverged from the continental species 5.35 million years ago (Mya), when the desiccation of
the Mediterranean ended [13,14] and the Myotragus
ancestors became isolated in the Balearic Islands. In principle, this would be a minimum age for the node in the
tree, but we consider likely that the isolation of the Balearic Islands was a vicariant event responsible for the split
of the Myotragus and continental lineages, so that we can
use this date as a fixed age in the Caprinae cytochrome b
tree (Figure 2). The dating results for the maximum-likelihood and Bayesian trees are very similar and only the
former are shown. We have calculated ultrametric trees
using the Langley-Fitch method [26] as well as the penalyzed likelihood method with several smoothing factors
[27] implemented in the r8s program. The cross-valida-

tion procedure to explore the fidelity with which these different methods explain the branch length variation in the
tree indicates that the Langley-Fitch method is slightly better for our data set and therefore we used this method in
the calculations described next (although dates obtained

were very similar using penalyzed likelihood with a log10
of the smoothing factor of 2; not shown). In addition, we
have performed a parametric bootstrap procedure, in
which we simulated alignments from the maximum-likelihood tree and re-calculated dates from the same maxi-

mum-likelihood topology with branch lengths optimized
for each simulated alignment. This allowed us to evaluate
the stochastic errors of date estimates associated to sampling a finite number of alignment positions [28]. In a different parametric bootstrap procedure, we reconstructed
new trees from each simulated alignment and used them
for time estimation (instead of only the original topology)
and therefore errors associated with finite number of positions as well as with tree reconstruction imperfections are
estimated [28]. The standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals for most date estimates were very similar
for both parametric bootstrap procedures (Table 4), indicating that most of the errors in the present data set are
associated to the finite sample sequence rather than to tree
errors. In the following, standard deviations given refer to
the parametric bootstrap using only the original topology
for calculating dates.
The ultrametric trees calculated by the Langley-Fitch
method applied to the cytochrome b maximum-likelihood tree showed that the separation of the most divergent lineages within Caprinae (Pantholops and the rest of
species) occurred 6.2 ± 0.4 Mya. These dates are more
recent than a proposed Caprinae radiation 11 Mya based
on different molecular calibrations (see Introduction)
[17,18]. There is no general consensus from fossil data on
the date of the start of the Caprinae radiation, that ranges
from around 14 Mya [12] to a more recent Late Miocene
origin [29], which would be more consistent with our
results.
After the first split, the separation of the most basal lineages took place around or before 5.35 Mya (Figure 2), and
therefore we can estimate that the main radiation of
caprines occurred in less than one million years of evolution. A lineages through time plot, that reflects the
number of lineages in each split point of the tree (bottom
of Figure 2), indicates a fast growing of lineages during the
first million years of evolution in comparison with the
flatter slope in the rest of the tree. Although a few species
are missing in this tree, all genera are covered and it is
likely that the tree with all species will reveal the same
clear steep slope at its base. This truly supports the existence of a quite fast initial radiation that led to the differentiation of nine clades (including the Myotragus lineage)
that are at the base of all extant genera. In addition, this
explains the difficulties we face in reconstructing the phylogenetic tree of this group.
Interestingly, the separation of the two chamois species
(Rupicapra) and the beginning of the radiation of the main
clade of goats (separation of the Capra ibex and Capra
pyrenaica clade from the rest of species) occurred at 1.6 ±
0.3 Mya and 1.5 ± 0.2, respectively, according to the calibrated cytochrome b tree. This would imply that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/70

beginning of the Pleistocene glaciations promoted the
diversification of the main lineages of Caprinae species
living in the Alps and other Eurasian mountainous
regions. The deep split observed between the alpine and
southern chamois, at 1.6 ± 0.3 Mya, is quite remarkable,
since these two species have been considered subspecies
until recently [30], and other molecular studies have given
much more recent dates for the separation of these two
species using restriction fragment length polymorphism
of mitochondrial DNA [31] or microsatellites [32]. Their
split is even older than that between Capra pyrenaica and
Capra ibex, a pair of species with a similar geographic disjunction than the two chamois and traditionally recognized as different species, that separated 0.6 ± 0.1 Mya
according to our data. To test whether the deep split
observed between the two chamois was caused by particularly divergent cytochrome b haplotypes of chamois used
in this study, we performed the calibrations with all
sequences of chamois in databases, including shorter ones
(five for R. pyrenaica and six for R. rupicapra), obtaining
very similar dates (not shown). To analyze if the date of
this split depended on the particularly long branch of
Myotragus, we manually reduced this branch to the half,
but we obtained again similar dates for all splits in the
trees (1.7 Mya for the split between chamois). This is due
to the smoothing of rates performed by the calibration
methods used, that correct for the higher evolutionary rate
of the Myotragus lineage. To account for the possibility
that Myotragus could be more basal in the tree, we manually positioned Myotragus just after the separation of Pantholops. Then the split date of the two chamois was
reduced, but only up to 1.4 Mya. This is in agreement with
the parametric bootstrap analyses (Table 4), that indicate
that the tree topology is not crucial in this calculation.
This is surely due to the small internal branches involved
in all different topologies arranging the basal species of
the tree. Other works where several topologies were used
for calculating dates have also shown that age estimates
were largely insensitive to different phylogenies [28].
Finally, if Myotragus and Ovis had diverged in fact more
recently and the ancestors of Myotragus had reached the
Balearic Islands via a transmarine colonization after these
islands became disconnected from the continent, as proposed for other vertebrates [32], all the dates in the tree
could be more recent; however, this hypothesis is
extremely unlikely in Myotragus from the paleontological
evidence [24]. On the other hand, the use of evolutionary
rates calculated from other sources, for example, the separation of humans and chimpanzees 5 – 7 Mya [34,35]
combined with the genetic distance between their cytochrome b sequence, would lead to a separation of Myotragus and Ovis clades at 7.2 Mya. Although the use of an
external calibration could be problematic, this reference
would not support a transmarine colonization of Myotra-

separated much longer than previously thought, which
would help explain the anti-hybridization mechanisms
currently operating [30].

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study is among the first ones in which
mitochondrial as well as nuclear DNA has been retrieved
from an extinct species from a warm location, in this case
the Mediterranean area. Also, our research demonstrates
the importance of ancient DNA in phylogenetics, since we
have been able to use the isolation of Myotragus in the
Baleric Islands as a vicariant event for dating the Caprinae
phylogenetic tree. This is quite a unique opportunity for
mammals because, contrary to other zoological groups
such as insects, reptiles or amphibians, almost no extant
endemic mammal remains in these Islands.

Methods
A left tibiae (MNIB 60176) bone from Myotragus balearicus
from Cova des Gorgs (Escorca, Mallorca), dated to 6,0105,830 cal BC 2σ (Beta-177239) was chosen for DNA analysis because of its excellent external preservation. The
remainder bone not used for analysis is held in the vertebrate collection in the Museu de la Naturalesa de les Illes
Balears (MNIB, Palma de Mallorca); the present sample is
approximately between 500 and 1,850 years younger than
the other one from the same site previously analyzed [11].
DNA was extracted following procedures described elsewhere [11]. The sample was demineralized overnight with
0.5 M EDTA, incubated overnight with proteinase K and
SDS, extracted with phenol-chloroform and concentrated
and desalinized with centricon columns. Finally, the
extract was purified with silica. The sample was extracted
with blank extractions to monitor against contamination.
Several fragments of mtDNA cytochrome b gene were
amplified and sequenced until completing the whole gene
(Table 1).
The cytochrome b sequences matched the partial sequence
previously retrieved from another Myotragus bone from
the same site [10]; multiple controls, such as independent

replication of the results in two different laboratories and
cloning of different overlapping PCR products, contributed to the authentication of the sequences. All the work
was carried out in a dedicated ancient DNA laboratory,
with UV lights, air-positive pressure and regular cleaning
of surfaces with bleach. No signs of contamination were
observed along the study in the extraction and PCR
blanks; the sample was analyzed along with an Upper
Paleolithic human remain [36] that yielded a human
sequence. In addition, no other Bovid had ever been
extracted in the same laboratory. One fragment of the
cytochrome b was previously replicated in the Ancient
Biomolecules Centre (Oxford), yielding the same
sequence as in the present study. For the 12S gene, some
primers were designed (Table 1) to match previous Caprinae sequences published [37].
Due to the exceptional quality of this extract, a pilot
project was launched for trying to retrieve a fragment of a
nuclear gene. The 28S rDNA was chosen because it is
present in some hundreds of copies in the genome. The
primers used to amplify the 28S rDNA were those
designed [38] to be vertebrate-specific (Table 1).
Five microliters of extract were added to 20 µl PCR reactions, containing 1× reaction buffer, 1 unit of taq DNA
polymerase, 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 25 pmol of each primer.
Forty cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C and 1 min at
72°C were performed. PCR products were resolved in 1%
low-melting agarose gels in a TA buffer; bands were
excised from the gel and subjected to a second 30 cycles of
PCR with limiting reagents. PCR products were cloned
with the SureClone Ligation Kit (Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden); inserts were sequenced with 3100 Gene Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).
Sequences have been deposited at the GenBank under
accession numbers: AY380560, AY380561, AY380562,
AY380563, AY894418, AY894419 and AY894420.
Several phylogenetic analyses were performed with the
Myotragus sequences. We used its cytochrome b together
with the whole cytochrome b of all Caprinae species available in databases (Capra hircus, Capra aegagrus, Capra fal-

pyrenaica and the complete sequence of 14 members of
Alcephalini and Hippotragini used as outgroups (Addax
nasomaculatus, Alcelaphus buselaphus, Alcelaphus lichtensteini, Beatragus hunteri, Connochaetes gnou, Connochaetes
taurinus, Damaliscus lunatus, Damaliscus pygargus, Hippotragus equinus, Hippotragus niger, Oryx dammah, Oryx gazella,
Oryx leucoryx and Sigmoceros lichtensteinii); this high
number of outgroups eliminates the possible biases of
choosing a single one at random and partitions the longest branches, thus reducing the problem of long branch
attraction [39]. The analyses considered a general time
reversible (GTR) model with a proportion of invariable
sites and a discrete gamma model with 6 categories to
account for among site rate variation. This model was
selected upon checking with Modeltest [40] that the set of
all positions as well as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions favored the GTR model or a model close to it (GTR
being the closest model in the phylogeny programs used
here) and gamma plus invariable rates. Phylogenies were
performed using Bayesian analysis implemented in the
program MrBayes v. 3.0. [41]. For the calculations, independent models of sequence evolution were used for each
codon position. Four chains of 4,000,000 trees were generated, sampling every 100th tree, with burning completed by the 20,000th tree; thus, 20,000 trees were used
to estimate topologies and posterior probabilities of
parameters. It was checked that the likelihood and all
parameters were stationary after this burn-in. Maximumlikelihood analyses were performed with the program
Phyml, version 2.4.4 [42]. The gamma parameter, the proportion of invariable sites and the nucleotide frequencies
were estimated from the data. Two maximum-likelihood
tree searches were made, one starting from a neighbor
joining tree and another from the previously generated
Bayesian tree, selecting the tree with the best likelihood
(almost always the one starting from the Bayesian tree).
To test the robustness of the tree clades, 1,000 bootstrap
samples were performed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/70

To estimate absolute rates of molecular evolution with a
relaxed molecular clock on the cytochrome b phylogenetic
tree (and divergence times using the geological date of the
isolation of the Myotragus lineage), the r8s v1.7 program
was used [45]. Outgroup sequences were eliminated from
the tree previous to the analysis of caprines. Smoothing of
rate variation along the tree was performed with the Langley-Fitch [26] and penalized likelihood [27] methods.
Sixteen smoothing factors with log10 from -2 to 5.5 were
used for the penalized likelihood method. The lowest χ2
cross-validation score, as calculated by r8s, was used to
select the best method. To perform parametric bootstraps,
1,000 Monte Carlo simulations of alignments of the same
length than the complete cytochrome b were generated
with SeqGen [46] using the phylogenetic trees and model
parameters previously obtained. A lineages through time
plot of an ultrametric tree obtained with these methods
was calculated with the program GENIE [47].

Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian trees were similarly
generated in a combination of the cytochrome b sequence
with a 12S fragment, using the only 20 caprine species in
which both 12S and cytochrome b were available at GenBank, and an outgroup. For the Bayesian tree, an independent GTR model was considered for the 12S partition.
No tree was generated for the 28S fragment, due to irresolvable difficulties with the alignment.
To test the possibility of an explosive diversification of the
Caprinae subfamily, we performed the likelihood ratio
test for zero-length branches [43] from the cytochrome b
data using PAUP 4,0 [44] and the same maximum-likelihood model as above.
