Incomplete concerted evolution and reproductive
isolation at the rDNA locus uncovers nine cryptic
species within Anopheles longirostris from Papua
New Guinea

Abstract
Background: Nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes and transcribed spacers are highly utilized as taxonomic markers
in metazoans despite the lack of a cohesive understanding of their evolution. Here we follow the evolution of the
rDNA second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I subunit in the
malaria mosquito Anopheles longirostris from Papua New Guinea (PNG). This morphospecies inhabits a variety of
ecological environments indicating that it may comprise a complex of morphologically indistinguishable species.
Using collections from over 70 sites in PNG, the mtDNA was assessed via direct DNA sequencing while the ITS2 was
assessed at three levels - crude sequence variation through restriction digest, intragenomic copy variant organisation
(homogenisation) through heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing via cloning.
Results: Genetic evaluation of over 300 individuals revealed that A. longirostris comprises eight ITS2 PCR-RFLP
genotypes and nine ITS2 heteroduplex genotypes showing distinct copy variant organization profiles after PCR
amplification. Seven of these nine genotypes were found to be sympatric with other genotypes. Phylogenetic
analysis of cloned ITS2 PCR products and mtDNA COI confirmed all nine clades with evidence of reproductive
isolation at the rDNA locus. Compensatory base changes in the ITS2 secondary structure or in pseudoknots were
absent when closely related species were assessed. Individuals from each ITS2 genotype showed the same copy
variant heteroduplex profile suggesting that the rDNA array is fixed within each genotype.
Conclusion: The centromere-proximal position of the rDNA array in Anopheles mosquitoes has probably reduced
interchromosomal recombination leaving intrachromosomal events responsible for the observed pattern of
concerted evolution we see in these mosquitoes. The stability of these intragenomic ITS2 copy variants within
individuals and interbreeding populations suggests that rDNA is moving as a single evolutionary unit through
natural populations to fixation and has provided a complementary diagnostic tool to the restriction digest for
studying genetic discontinuities and species boundaries. In this, the utility of the ITS2 as a universal taxonomic
marker is probably contingent on several factors pertaining to spacer dimensions and the genomic location of the
rDNA array with respect to recombination and proximity to regions potentially under selection.

Background
The identification and classification of reproductive isolation is fundamental for defining species biodiversity as
species are generally understood to be composed of
genetically or reproductively isolated units [1]. Two very

differently evolving genomic regions are often used to
study species diversity and include a segment of the
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) [2,3]. The only
commonality between these markers is that both regions
exist in high copy numbers within eukaryotes, which in
turn facilitates their PCR amplification. The conditions
under which they evolve could not be more different.

The use of a barcoding approach based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) provides a line of evidence from a
genome separate to nuclear DNA in that it is not associated with the machinery of sex and also carries several
intrinsic problems associated with its evolution including maternal inheritance, reduced effective population
size, introgression and heteroplasmy [4]. Importantly,
when studying closely related species the mtDNA is
often unable to identify recently emerged species
because of the time required to separate the intraspecific
variation from interspecific divergence - the “barcoding
gap” [4,5]. Indeed, barcoding gap problems can occur in
discriminating species within Diptera [6]. At the same
time, the ITS2 has been used extensively as a tool for
the identification of species with increasing calls for this
region to become an important marker in molecular
systematics based on the occurrence of a correlation
between compensatory nucleotide changes on helix II or
III of the ITS2 secondary structure and sexual incompatibility [3,7,8].
In metazoans, the ITS2 is part of the rDNA gene
family tandemly organized head to tail, often hundreds
of times in the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). This
family of structural RNA genes and spacers are observed
to evolve through a pattern of concerted evolution using
DNA turnover machinery that operates to spread or
remove sequence variant copies within individuals
(homogenization), and also operates to spread or
remove variants within an interbreeding population
(fixation). Polymorphism is usually low among these
tandem units within individual genomes and populations
due to the homogenizing effect of the DNA turnover
machinery. Unlike the mtDNA barcode marker, whose
evolution and utility as a taxonomic marker is relatively
well described [9,10], the evolutionary machinery that
drives variation in nuclear rDNA is more complex being nuclear DNA that does not follow traditional
Mendelian rules of inheritance - and a comprehensive
understanding of this process remains elusive [11-13].
However, in metazoans we observe that each gene
sequence in the array is generally the same, producing
sequence similarity within a species and sequence diversity between species [14,15]. The practicality of this
rDNA turnover machinery for resolving closely related
species has been that the less functionally restricted
regions, including the ITS2, can accumulate mutations
within reproductively isolated populations relatively
quickly and can thus be the first indicators of genetic
discontinuity between populations [3,7,16]
Mosquitoes transmit pathogens that cause human disease. As each species will display its own biology, ecology and pathogen transmission potential, identification
of independently evolving genetic groups is vital to an
understanding of mosquito-borne disease dynamics. It is

generally understood that many mosquito morphospecies contain cryptic species, and the occurrence of newly
identified species is usually followed by the development
of molecular diagnostic tools to assist field studies
[17,18]. These diagnostic tools are commonly designed
around the fast evolving ITS2, which have consistently
revealed informative species-level sequence variation
and are flanked by conserved gene regions, greatly simplifying PCR primer design and analysis.
The mosquito Anopheles longirostris transmits malaria
in Papua New Guinea (PNG) [19,20]. This morphospecies exists throughout the major river valleys and flood
plains of the Sepik and Ramu valleys in northern PNG, as
well as the upper Fly River valley in southwest PNG; it
inhabits a variety of ecological environments indicating
that it may comprise a complex of morphologically indistinguishable species [21]. The aim of this study is to
determine if A. longirostris constitutes a cryptic species
group by showing reproductive isolation at the rDNA
ITS2 locus, while co-investigation of the COI locus is
used to determine if the identified cryptic species exist as
divergent mtDNA lineages [5]. We hypothesize that A.
longirostris, like many mosquito morphospecies in PNG,
comprises a cryptic species complex and so we follow the
evolution of both the mtDNA COI and rDNA ITS2
sampled from over 70 collection sites. We examine the
evolution of the ITS2 at three levels: 1) PCR-restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to view crude
sequence variation; 2) PCR-copy variant analysis to view
the homogenization of potential ITS2 copy variants
within the rDNA array; and 3) DNA sequence analysis
via cloning and sequencing.
Concordance was found between the numerous
mtDNA lineages and ITS2 genotypes and reproductive
isolation exists at the rDNA locus for most genotypes.
Interestingly the ITS2 copy variants appear fixed in all
individuals of each genotype suggesting that intrachromosomal events are the primary driver of rDNA turnover in A. longirostris and that the rDNA array is
moving as a single evolutionary unit within interbreeding populations.

Results
A total of 302 specimens identified as A. longirostris
morphospecies were collected and studied from 76 sites
in PNG (Table 1 and Figure 1). Based on PCR amplification of the ITS2 region, all individuals produced a single
band at approximately 680 bp (Figure 2A). The ITS2
region was subsequently assessed using three different
approaches: 1) rudimentary assessment of sequence variation was obtained by RFLP analysis; 2) intragenomic
copy variants present were observed by heteroduplex
analysis; and 3) DNA sequence variation was detailed
through cloning and sequencing of the ITS2.

Restriction digestion of the ITS2 product with the
enzyme Msp I (recognition motif CCGG) followed by
size separation through a 3% agarose gel revealed eight
RFLP profiles or genotypes with bands ranging from 50
bp to 350 bp. These eight genotypes have been designated A-H (Figure 2B). Genotype distribution and abundance are described in Table 2. Briefly, genotype A was
only found from one site in the Ramu Valley north-west
PNG; genotype B came from 11 sites both north and
south of the PNG Central Ranges; genotype C was common and found at 37 sites throughout PNG; genotype D
came from nine sites spanning both sides of Central
Ranges; genotype E came from 16 sites throughout
PNG; genotype F came from three sites in north-west
PNG; genotype G was restricted to sites in Western
PNG, on both sides of the Central Ranges; and genotype
H came from two sites in north-west PNG. No shared
or hybrid RFLP profiles were found and only two RFLP
genotypes (F and H) were not found to be in sympatry
with the other RFLP genotypes (Table 3), suggesting
potential reproductive isolation.

for seven of the eight RFLP genotypes (Figure 2C;

revealed two distinct heteroduplex profiles, suggesting
that two different copy variant populations were present
within this single RFLP profile, and these were assigned
their own genotype status (designated C1 and C2). Thus
ITS2 genotypes could be resolved within RFLP profiles
by following the copy variant organization in individual
genomes. Additionally, seven of the nine genotypes were
found to be in sympatry, again suggesting potential

ITS2 DNA sequence analysis

Three individuals from each of the seven ITS2 genotypes were selected and cloned with four to five clones
sequenced per individual. The ITS2 PCR product cloning and DNA sequencing is summarized in Table 4 and
all unique ITS2 sequences were submitted to Genbank
with accession numbers described in the genetic analysis
summary Table 5 [GU170434-GU170538]. Cloned ITS2
sequences were subsequently aligned in Clustal X [22]
using gap opening/gap extension values of 20/15. The
ITS2 alignment length was 762 nucleotides consisting of
105 sequences of which 543 characters (71%) were constant, 168 characters (22%) were parsimony informative
and 51 variable characters (7%) were parsimony uninformative. Gaps or missing data represented 264 sites and
the GC content ranged from 59.1-64.5% (61.8% average).
A summary of the ITS2 sequencing is detailed in Table
4 and 5 with the ITS2 alignment available as additional
file 1 or as a Popset through GenBank [269969773].
Based on NCBI BLAST searches (blastn algorithm),
the most closely related sequences came from other
regional mosquito species - A. annulipes from Australia

(EF042773, 74% identity over 100% of the sequence) and
A. lungae from the Solomon Islands (80% identity over
64% of the sequence). This low level of sequence identity to mosquitoes outside the group led to the construction of unrooted phylogenetic trees using both
Bayesian and ML phylogenetic methods and produced
similar trees with strong bootstrap scores and posterior
probabilities for the nine ITS2 genotypes (Figure 3). All
ITS2 sequences were unique for each divergent lineage
and no evidence of either hybridization or ancestral
polymorphisms was found between the nine lineages.
Intraindividual ITS2 sequence variation revealed by
both heteroduplex profiles and in cloned ITS2 DNA
sequences appeared as single nucleotide polymorphisms
and sequence insertion/deletion indels, where indels
generated overt hetroduplex bands that migrated much
more slowly through the acrylamide gel. For example,
genotypes B, C1, C2, D and F contain ITS2 copy variant
sequence indels that manifest in the acrylamide gel as
slower moving heteroduplexes (Figure 2). (Refer to the
ITS2 alignment in additional file 1 or in GenBank [Popset: 269969773] for indel locations (genotypes B (nt 486487), C1 (nt 454-455, 612-614, 621-624), C2 (nt 530), D

* No copy variants evident in PCR product

Sixty-two individuals representing each of the nine ITS2
heteroduplex genotypes were sequenced for a segment
of the mtDNA COI [GenBank submissions GU247052 GU247114]; the results are summarized in Table 5 and
the alignment is available as additional file 2 and Genbank Popset [82555717]. There was no evidence of
intragenomic sequence polymorphisms in the chromatograms to suggest the presence of nuclear mitochondrial
sequences or pseudogenes. The final 524 bp alignment
contained 41 different haplotypes, consisting of 103 variable sites of which 98 (or 95%) were parsimony informative. All ITS2 lineages were evident in the mtDNA COI.
One non-synonymous T to G transversion was identified at residue 221 in all samples of genotype B resulting
in a change from Serine to Alanine. The COI data
shows well-supported clades for eight of the nine ITS2
genotypes. However the clade for genotype E sits as a
subclade with genotype G, separated by 9-10 mutational
steps (1.7-1.9%) from the nearest G haplotype. Diversity
within genotype G spans 17 mutational steps at its maximum (3.3%) suggesting that without the ITS2 data, genotype E may not have been resolved with the COI alone
because it exists in a “barcode gap” between the substantial intraspecific variation of genotype G and the

Figure 3 Phylogenetic assessment of A. longirostris based on DNA sequence from the ITS2 (Panel A) and mtDNA COI (Panel B) reveal
nine lineages. Both Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood procedures produced trees of similar topology with branch support values above 70%
shown - Bayesian posterior probability above the branch (converted to percentage) and Maximum Likelihood bootstrapping (percentage) below
the branch. The ITS2 showed a well resolved tree with all clades well separated into genotypes. All ITS2 genotypes were evident as mtDNA COI
divergent lineages with cloned individuals co- assessed for the COI.

small interspecific divergence of genotype E. More sampling may help resolve this issue.
ITS2 secondary structure analysis

Other studies have raised the suggestion that compensatory base changes in ITS2 secondary structure can correlate with sexual incompatibility and discriminate of
biological species [3,7]. We assessed closely related ITS2
genotypes (C1-C2 and F-D) for the presence of compensatory base changes because they showed distinct genotype-specific sequence indels. ITS2 sequences were
folded into secondary structures using the MFOLD
algorithm [23], with optimal and suboptimal structures
generated and observed for compensatory base changes.
Despite the presence of genotype specific indels identified in the 3’ region (25 bp separated the F/D comparison and 53 bp separated the C1/C2 comparison), no
optimal or suboptimal structures could place these
indels in positions that could be observed as compensatory. Additionally, the issue of compensatory base
changes within RNA pseudoknots also seemed unlikely
but could not be fully explored due to the 450 bp
sequence length limits of the vsfold5 pseudoknot prediction software [24]. However, as the ITS2 sequence
folded consistently 5’ to 3’ in MFOLD we could utilize

partial sequences in the pseudoknot analyses. Nevertheless, we found no evidence that these nucleotide differences between genotypes were involved or linked to
pseudoknots.
Genotype abundance and distribution in PNG

The abundance and distribution of the nine ITS2 genotypes are described in Table 2. The RFLP genotype C
was most commonly collected with 181 specimens
representing 60% of the collection. However, subsequent
acrylamide gel analysis to reveal heteroduplex copy variants split this RFLP genotype into subsets of 11 C1
(3.6%) and 170 C2 (56.3%). The C1 genotype was only
collected from PNG’s northern Sepik Valley region
while C2 extended across the full distribution of A. longirostris - a range also shared by genotypes B, D and E.

Discussion
The malaria transmitting mosquito identified morphologically as A. longirostris was found to comprise nine cryptic species in PNG that could be resolved by following
the evolution of two molecular markers - the rDNA ITS2
and the mtDNA COI. The ITS2 is a transcribed spacer
comprising part of a nuclear rDNA multicopy gene
family and evolves through non-Mendelian inheritance

Alquezar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:392
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/392

processes [25,26]. By following the evolution of the ITS2
it was possible to show evidence for reproductive isolation at the rDNA locus and also develop relatively simple
species-diagnostic molecular tools to distinguish these
putative cryptic species. The maternally inherited COI,
widely used as a DNA barcode [27], was able to show the
existence of eight divergent lineages with two genotypes
(G and E) potentially obscured by the substantial intraspecific variation of genotype G and small interspecific
divergence of genotype E.
The ITS2 revealed eight overt RFLP profiles with genotype discrimination apparent through single nucleotide
polymorphisms and repeat insertion/deletion indels that
are common to these regions. Seven of the eight RFLP
genotypes generated a single heteroduplex profile with
the RFLP of genotype C revealing two distinct heteroduplex profiles and thus suggesting that it contains two
distinct ITS2 genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of the
cloned ITS2 and COI sequences from individuals representing each genotype revealed nine separate evolutionary units confirming all genotypes including both C1
and C2; these latter two appear as distinct sister clades.
Agreement with the mtDNA COI on these species’
groupings provided additional support for the ITS2 data,
but this comparative approach may not be as informative for recently diverged species that do not show complete COI lineage sorting.
Despite the incomplete homogenization of the ITS2 in
these mosquitoes, the spacer appears to evolve through
concerted evolutionary rDNA turnover suggesting that
interbreeding in reproductively isolated populations is
driving different rDNA patterns that have in turn facilitated the discrimination of multiple species. It seems
unlikely that the copy variants observed within these
genotypes are the products of rDNA pseudogene amplification as we found little evidence of an elevated mutation rate in the conserved 5.8 S 3’ gene region that
makes up the first 100 nt of the ITS2 alignment. Additionally, no optimal or suboptimal ITS2 secondary structure folds (including RNA pseudoknots) could identify
compensatory base changes when closely related ITS2
genotypes were examined that would have concurred
with the theory that compensatory base changes in the
ITS2 secondary structure correlate with sexual incompatibility [3,7].
The mitochondrial DNA is regarded as fast evolving,
but its mode of maternal inheritance can only reveal the
presence of divergent lineages and cannot confirm the
existence of reproductive isolation between lineages.
Discrimination of species based on a percentage of
divergence thresholds has been suggested [27], but this
has been questioned for studies of Diptera [6]. The
advantage of using the rDNA as a genetic marker is that
it is possible to identify reproductive isolation at the

Page 8 of 12

rDNA locus where different rDNA genotypes exist in
sympatry. Under this assumption, most A. longirostris
ITS2 genotypes were collected in sympatry with other
genotypes (except H and F) while still maintaining genotype-specific RFLP and heteroduplex profiles. Additionally, most genotypes show robust phylogenetic
clustering with no shared sequences that could be considered either ancestral or a result of recent hybridization. The mtDNA COI marker supports all nine
genotypes with evidence of extended time in isolation in
most cases. We suggest that A. longirostris is a complex
of at least nine cryptic species in PNG that can now be
distinguished by a relatively simple PCR-based procedures utilizing the ITS2.
The utility of the ITS2 as a marker that can show
early genetic discontinuity between populations may
arise from a combination of interlinked factors that
include the ITS2 sequence length, the position of the
rDNA array on the chromosome with an associated ability to facilitate recombination. The size of the ITS2
appears to have some bearing on the ability of the
sequence to acquire non-deleterious mutations with
longer sequences generally better able to accommodate
mutation accumulation than shorter sequences. If
indeed a core structure is necessary for maturation of
the rRNA, mutations in a minimum length structure
will affect the core structure integrity moreso than
longer ITS2 sequences that may accommodate a higher
level of mutation. For example, the extension and contractions of helices through the gain and loss of nucleotides and indels may not compromise the structurefunction relationship. Using examples from Diptera,
short ITS2 sequences such as those found in Nearctic
Blackfly species (Diptera: Simuliidae; ITS2 length 286260 nt) show a restricted number of informative sites
when examined across five genera [28]. The ITS2
sequences from members of the Anopheles gambiae
complex (ITS2 ~ 426 nt) reveal a low level of single
nucleotide polymorphisms between cryptic species
[16,29]. This study and similar studies on Anopheles
mosquitoes from PNG suggest some correlation
between rDNA transcribed spacer size - whether it be
ITS2 or ITS1 - and the level of DNA sequence variation
and homogenization, with longer spacers showing a
more complex pattern of incomplete concerted evolution and DNA sequence variation that can be informative at the inter- and intraspecific level [11,30-32].
The DNA turnover machinery responsible for this
observed pattern of concerted evolution is thought to be
driven primarily through unequal crossover and gene
conversion [13,33]. If recombination is reduced, as it is
near the centromere [34], then homogenization may
appear incomplete and copy variants can be carried
along within an interbreeding population. The rDNA in

Alquezar et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:392
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/392

Anopheles mosquitoes is located on the sex chromosomes adjacent to the centromeres [35], and so rDNA
evolution would be driven primarily by intrachromosomal events, most likely gene conversion, within the
rDNA array. The presence of fixed ITS2 variants within
the A. longirostris rDNA genotypes suggests the rDNA
array is moving as a single evolutionary unit through
interbreeding populations. Comparable studies have
come from work on Drosophila melanogaster, where the
rDNA array exists within paracentromeric heterochromatin on sex chromosomes resulting in reduced recombination that sees rDNA turnover also occurring through
intrachromosomal exchanges with the rDNA array evolving as a single evolutionary unit or locus [36]. Intrachromosomal events driving rDNA evolution have also been
suggested by others [37,38], and the DNA turnover
machinery suggested is gene conversion. Indeed biased
gene conversion can be dynamic as seen in hybrid arthropod scallops where experimental hybridisation between
closely related scallop species carrying different rDNA
ITS variants can induce rapid early development biased
gene conversion (to the maternal type) that is almost
complete 14 days after fertilization [39].
Anopheles longirostris revealed nine independently
evolving rDNA genotypes with each genotype showing
fixed ITS2 sequence variants and suggesting that the
rDNA array is moving as a single evolutionary unit or
locus. This observation is evident in other Anopheles
mosquitoes we have studied and has previously provided
insights into genetic subdivisions within and between
putative species [30-32]. These regions may be under
divergent natural selection as evolutionary studies on A.
gambiae from Africa see the X-linked centromere-proximal rDNA in a region under reduced gene flow, which
has led to the suggestion that suppressed recombination
in this region may be involved in speciation [40,41]. The
rDNA in A. gambiae and other Anopheles mosquitoes
probably reside in regions that are now regarded as
genomic islands of speciation (areas of the genome
which show high levels of differentiation early in the
divergence process) which often include genes responsible for behavioral or ecological isolation [42,43]. Linkage
disequilibrium between the rDNA and potential isolating factors or genes under selection may have contributed to the ITS2 evolution we see in these cryptic species
from PNG.

Conclusion
The rDNA ITS2 is now regarded as a molecular key for
the identification of eukaryote biological species [3,7].
However, while the utility of the ITS2 for species identification can be compelling - as seen in this study, amongst
many others - it is most probably contingent on transcribed spacer dimensions and the position on the

Page 9 of 12

chromosome of the rDNA array itself with respect to
recombination frequency and proximity to genomic
regions under selection. We suggest that the rDNA’s
movement as a single evolutionary unit through these
mosquito populations is the reason why we observe fixed
intragenomic ITS2 variants within individuals and interbreeding populations. This DNA turnover phenomenon
that appears to fix copy variants within interbreeding
populations provides a complementary tool for identifying genetic discontinuities and species boundaries.

Methods
Sample collection

Mosquitoes were collected from the field throughout
regions in PNG by the Australian Army Malaria Unit
(AMI) using larval collections, CO2 baited light traps or
night biting catches [21]. Sites are summarized in
Table 1 and displayed in Figure 1. Larval material, in
most cases, was bred through to adults with subsequent
morphological identification to species using the keys of
[44]. All field material was stored either at -20°C, in
alcohol or dried on silica gel.
ITS2 amplification and RFLP genotype scoring

Genomic DNA was extracted and the ITS2 was amplified by PCR using whole or partial mosquitoes and the
methods described in [30]. Forward and reverse primers
were redesigned to anneal at higher temperatures to
reduce the effect of strong secondary structure found in
this mosquito’s ITS2 region (ITS2Ah 5’-GGA TCG
ATG AAG ACC GCA GCTA and ITS2Rh 5’-CCG TTT
CGC TCG CAG CTA CTC AGG). The PCR was carried
out in 48 well (0.2 ml) PCR cycle plates (Astral Scientific) using 25 μl final volume and oil overlay. The final
PCR mixture contained 16.6 mM [NH4]2SO4, 67 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.8 (at 25°C), 0.45% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/
ml gelatin, 1.5 mM MgCl, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.4
μM of each primer, 5.0% DMSO, 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase and approximately 2-10 ng of purified genomic
DNA (1 μl of mosquito DNA extraction). A drop of
mineral oil was overlaid and the reaction cycling (on
either a MJ research PTC200 or a BioRad C-1000 thermal cycler) involved an initial denaturation step at 94°C
for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 57°C
for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min using minimum transition
times. The PCR products were run out on a 1% agarose
gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized at 312 nm. Restriction digestion analysis of the
ITS2 product was performed by adding 5 μl of PCR
reaction to 5μl of 2× Msp I buffer containing 1 unit of
Msp I per reaction. Reactions were incubated at 37°C
for 2.0 hr and then run on a 3% agarose gel containing
0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized at 312 nm.
Genotype profiles were scored.

ITS2 copy variant analysis and DNA sequencing

Sequence alignment

One tenth (2.5 μl) of the ITS2 PCR product was electrophoresed on a 7% non-denaturing acrylamide gel
(NOVEX or BioRad) for 2.5 hr at 200 V. To prevent heating of the gel and subsequent denaturing of the DNA
duplex the gel tank was placed in a plastic container containing an ice and water mixture. The gel was stained
with ethidium bromide (5μg/ml) for 1 min and then
rinsed twice and visualized at 312 nm. Native acrylamide
gels are sensitive to double stranded duplex formation
with heteroduplexes (duplex misspairing) running slower
than homoduplexes (no misspairing) permitting a qualitative assessment of the major ITS2 copy variants amplified in the ITS2 PCR products. Individuals that produced
only homoduplexes (a single band corresponding to the
size of the PCR product) could be directly sequenced.
Heteroduplexes appearing as multiple band profiles in
the acrylamide gel signified the presence of ITS2 copy
variants in the PCR product and thus cloning was
required prior to DNA sequencing. Briefly, ITS2 PCR
products were ligated into the pGEMT vector and transformed into E. coli (DH5a) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega, Madison, USA).
Positive colonies (white/pale-blue) were stabbed with a
sterile pipette tip, briefly immersed into a 0.5 ml PCR
tube containing a 25 μl PCR reaction, and amplified
using both forward and reverse primers as described
above. Cycling involved 25 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 57°C
for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min using minimal transition
times. Amplified PCR products were confirmed and
quantified on a 1% agarose gel. Sequencing involving a
spin column cleanup of amplification products was performed using a QIAGEN QIAquick PCR Purification Kit,
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequencing was performed by the Australian Genomic Research Facility
(University of Queensland) using the ABI Big DyeTM
Terminator kit (Perkin Elmer, Forster, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. The same forward
and reverse primers were used as a priming template.

All sequences were analyzed and edited using
Sequencher 4.2.2 (Gene Codes Corporation, 2004) and
alignments were generated using Clustal X [22] and edited in MacClade 4 [47]. As the ITS2 regions contained
many short repeats and gaps, the final alignment
required some manual fine-scale modifications. The
ITS2 sequence alignment is available as additional file 1
and as GenBank Popset [269969773].

Amplification of the Mitochondrial DNA

A 580 base pair fragment of the mtDNA COI subunit
gene was amplified by PCR using the COI forward primer (5’ GTTCCTTTAATATTAGGAGCACC 3’ [45])
and reverse primer (5’ TAATATAGCATAAATTATTCC [46]). The final PCR mixture contained 1×
Taq buffer II (Fisher Biotech, Australia), 2.5 mM MgCl,
0.125 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.51.0 unit of Taq polymerase and 5.0-10.0 ng of extracted
genomic DNA (1 μl of extraction). The cycling involved
an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 3 min, then 35
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1
min with minimal transition times. Amplified PCR products were purified and sequenced as described above.

Nucleotide substitution model and phylogenetic analyses

The model of molecular evolution for the data was evaluated using jModeltest [48]. Under the Akaike information criterion (AIC), from 88 possible models the ITS2
alignment was best fitted by the GTR+ I followed by the
GTR+ Γ model while the mtDNA COI data was best
fitted by the TVM+G followed by the GTR+ Γ.
For the ITS2 the nucleotide sequence alignment was
analyzed using a Maximum Likelihood method with the
model incorporating six categories and a Gamma shape
parameter (the GTR+Γ model) using PhyML 3 [49]. The
branch support of the Maximum Likelihood tree was
evaluated by the bootstrapping method with 500 replicates in PhyML. In addition, the ITS2 dataset was analyzed by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using MrBayes
3.1.2 [50] using the GTR+ Γ model. Metropolis coupled
Markov chain analyses were run with one cold and
three heated chains (temperature set to 0.2) for
5,000,000 generations and sampled every 200 generations. This process was performed three times from a
random starting tree and run well beyond convergence.
Trees before convergence were discarded before reconstruction of the consensus Bayesian tree with posterior
probability transformed to percentage values.

Detection of compensatory substitutions in the ITS2

To investigate the concept of compensatory base
changes informing on the potential level of sexual

incompatibility [3,7], closely related ITS2 genotypes (C1C2 and F-D) were assessed for evidence of compensatory base changes. The ITS2 sequences were first folded
into secondary structures using the MFOLD algorithm
[23]. We used the older MFOLD version 2.3 so as to
select for a lower folding temperature of 28°C while
leaving other RNA fold parameters as default. Both optimal and suboptimal structures were generated and
observed for compensatory base changes. Additionally,
the issue of compensatory base changes within RNA
pseudoknots was also investigated using vsfold5 pseudoknot prediction software [24]. Limitations in the software (maximum sequence length is 450 bp) only
permitted the analysis of partial ITS2 sequences and
these were derived from nucleotide 240 to the 3’ end
based on the folding pattern obtained by MFOLD.
