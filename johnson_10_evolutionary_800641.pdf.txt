An evolutionary analysis of cAMP-specific
Phosphodiesterase 4 alternative splicing
Keven R Johnson1, Jessie Nicodemus-Johnson2, Robert S Danziger3,4*

Abstract
Background: Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze the intracellular second messengers: cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP). The cAMP-specific PDE family 4
(PDE4) is widely expressed in vertebrates. Each of the four PDE4 gene isoforms (PDE4 A-D) undergo extensive
alternative splicing via alternative transcription initiation sites, producing unique amino termini and yielding
multiple splice variant forms from each gene isoform termed long, short, super-short and truncated super-short.
Many species across the vertebrate lineage contain multiple splice variants of each gene type, which are
characterized by length and amino termini.
Results: A phylogenetic approach was used to visualize splice variant form genesis and identify conserved splice
variants (genome conservation with EST support) across the vertebrate taxa. Bayesian and maximum likelihood
phylogenetic inference indicated PDE4 gene duplication occurred at the base of the vertebrate lineage and reveals
additional gene duplications specific to the teleost lineage. Phylogenetic inference and PDE4 splice variant
presence, or absence as determined by EST screens, were further supported by the genomic analysis of select
vertebrate taxa. Two conserved PDE4 long form splice variants were found in each of the PDE4A, PDE4B, and
PDE4C genes, and eight conserved long forms from the PDE4 D gene. Conserved short and super-short splice
variants were found from each of the PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4 D genes, while truncated super-short variants were
found from the PDE4C and PDE4 D genes. PDE4 long form splice variants were found in all taxa sampled
(invertebrate through mammals); short, super-short, and truncated super-short are detected primarily in tetrapods
and mammals, indicating an increasing complexity in both alternative splicing and cAMP metabolism through
vertebrate evolution.
Conclusions: There was a progressive independent incorporation of multiple PDE4 splice variant forms and amino
termini, increasing PDE4 proteome complexity from primitive vertebrates to humans. While PDE4 gene isoform
duplicates with limited alternative splicing were found in teleosts, an expansion of both PDE4 splice variant forms,
and alternatively spliced amino termini predominantly occurs in mammals. Since amino termini have been linked
to intracellular targeting of the PDE4 enzymes, the conservation of amino termini in PDE4 splice variants in
evolution highlights the importance of compartmentalization of PDE4-mediated cAMP hydrolysis.

physiological processes such as; protein phosphorylation
via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), gene transcription through cAMP response elements, and cyclic
nucleotide gated ion channels [3-6]. These processes
have been linked to cognitive function, depression,
schitzophrenia, hypertension, and an integral involvement in modulating cardiomyocyte contractility [7,8].
The PDE4 gene family is composed of four gene isoforms; PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4 D which
arose via a gene duplication event in a common eukaryotic ancestor before the separation of sponges and

eumetazoans [9]. Although PDE4 s have not been extensively studied in teleosts, amphibians, or reptiles, transcripts from all four PDE4 gene isoforms have been
detected in several mammalian species; for review, [8].
Mammalian PDE4 splice variant forms produced from
each gene isoform (A-D) have been classified as: long,
short, super-short, or truncated super-short [7,10] (Figure 1). PDE4 splice variant synthesis proceeds through
alternative splicing via the incorporation of distinct promoters (alternative transcription start sites) that drive
differential tissue expression and transcriptional regulation [11-13]. The long form transcripts consist of exons
encoding the amino termini (i.e., 5′ exon), upstream
conserved region-1 (UCR-1), linker region-1 (LR-1),
UCR-2, LR2, catalytic, and carboxy-terminal domains
(Figure 1). Each PDE4 gene isoforms produces multiple
PDE4 long forms with unique amino termini. The PDE4
amino terminal protein region is proposed to be responsible for variant-specific protein-protein interactions
providing subcellular localizations for PDE4 splice variants [14-16]. The UCR-1 and UCR-2 facilitate long
form activation via PKA phosphorylation [17] and
homodimerization [18,19]. The LR2 in the super-short
splice variant PDE4A4 has been shown to bind SRC tyrosyl kinase LYN though an SH3 domain [20]. PDE4
short, super-short, and truncated super-short splice variants have unique amino termini and differ from long
forms by the exclusion in entirety of UCR1 (i.e., in
short, super-short, and truncated super-short forms),
and segments of UCR2 (in super-short and truncated
super-short forms). These variations affect how PDE4
splice variant forms are regulated by eliminating UCR1-

mediated dimerization and PKA-dependent phosphorylation, providing a functional dichotomy between the
different PDE4 splice variant forms.
The PDE4 proteome is expansive, from four gene isoforms there are greater than twenty known PDE4 splice
variants that have been identified in various mammals
(primarily rats, mice and humans). In this study we first
established the timing of PDE4 gene and splice variant
form evolution in vertebrates using NCBI EST and
ENSEMBL genome databases. We then identified evolutionary conserved splice variants (based on amino terminus conservation) within the vertebrate lineage that may
likely form the functional foundation of PDE4 mediated
cAMP degradation.

Results & Discussion
Evolutionary Conservation of the metal-dependent
phosphohydrolase domain in PDE4 Splice Variants

We identified 162 PDE4 ESTs from 15 species encompassing the vertebrate phyla and one invertebrate (Additional File 1). All PDE4 s share high sequence identity
in the catalytic domains. Residues H361, H397, D398,
and D479, are found within the ‘HD’ motif of the phosphohydrolase domain and are known to confer PDE4
activity. These residues are invariant from Ciona to
Humans (Additional File 2), with the exception of D479
(which is an asparagine in Ciona). This suggests that all
PDE4 s included in our study are catalytically active.
PDE4 splice variant classification

In order to classify newly identified PDE4 splice variants
obtained from NCBI and ENSEMBL database screens

Figure 1 Overview of representative PDE4 gene structure. PDE4 genes are composed of multiple exons connected by either a dashed line
(facultative exons), or solid line (constitutive exons). The PDE4 long form amino-termini specifying exons (1), are located in the upstream region
of the genes, each under different promoter control. The Upstream conserved region-1 (UCR1) is composed of three exons (UCR1a, UCR1b, and
UCR1c). The PDE4 short form amino termini specifying exon(s) (1a) are located downstream of the linker region 1 (LR1) exon. Upstream
conserved region 2 (UCR2) is composed of three exons (UCR2a, UCR2b and UCR2c), which are interrupted by the super-short form aminoterminus specifying exon (1b). The amino-terminus of truncated super-short PDE4 splice variants is found within the UCR2b exon (1c). The
enzymatic core of PDE4 is encoded by several constitutive exons (found in all isoforms) located in the farthest downstream regions of the gene.

into the proposed PDE4 classification system and verify
previously annotated PDE4 splice variant classifications,
a phylogenetic tree displaying the relationships of all
splice variants to each other was constructed (based on
the catalytic domain) for all PDE4 splice variants used
in this study (Additional File 3).
All PDE4 splice variants segregate into four distinct subclades (Additional File 3), representative of the four
known PDE4 gene isoforms. Surprisingly, teleost transcripts form two subclades for PDE4A, PDE4B, and
PDE4C gene isoforms (Additional File 3), (Figure 2). In all
PDE4 clades, rodents (i.e., mouse and rat) group out from
other mammals. Several teleost PDE4 splice variants have
been mis-annotated including; Stickleback PDE4B
(ENSGACT00000025861) and Medaka PDE4B1
(ENSORLT00000012530) which group into the “PDE4A“
clade, Fugu PDE4D4 (ENSTRUT00000034690), PDE4D1
(ENSTRUT00000034687),
and
Zebrafish
4D2
(XM_688538) and 4D3 (XM_001332019), all group into
the “PDE4C“ clade (Additional File 3, Additional File 1).
Several un-annotated PDE4 splice variants were also identified. These newly identified NCBI ESTs and BLASTP
proteins include: X. tropicalis PDE4C (BC129020), E.
caballus PDE4A1 (cDNA acc. # XR_044570), R. norvegicus
4A (protein acc. # EDL78317), M. musculus 4A (protein
acc. # EDL25164) and 4 D (protein acc. # CAQ51655), H.
sapiens PDE4C (ENSP00000336624). Splice variants
grouped according to PDE4 gene isoform type and not
splice variant form (Additional File 3), because all isoform
splice variants share the same exon pool (i.e. catalytic
domain exons). The incorporation of all splice variants
(long, short, super-short, truncated super-short) in our
analysis allowed the detection of splice variant NCBI database transcript isoform mis-annotation and classification
of newly discovered transcripts from NCBI EST libraries.
In this study, the multi-species alignments show several orthologous PDE4 splice variants that have different nomenclature designations either assigned
automatically by computational annotation or through
the literature. As rodents are typically the preferred
animal models for studies of human pathologies our
analyses in this section are limited to mice and rats,
however several mis-annotations occur in other species
as well. In the PDE4A gene, several orthologous splice
variants have been given different designations between
human and rodent in nomenclature (Additional File 4).
These splice variants include the human long form
PDE4A1 (NP_001104777) which has a homologous
amino terminus to mouse PDE4A5 (NP_899668) and
the rat PDE4A4 (NP_037233). The human long form
PDE4A3
has
two
designations;
PDE4A3
(NP_001104779) and PDE4A10 (AAD34217), and has a
homologous amino terminus to mouse and rat
PDE4A10 (EDL25164 and ENSRNOP00000057814,

respectively). The human super-short form PDE4A4
(NP_006193) is homologous to mouse PDE4A1
(NP_062772) and rat PDE4A1 (AAA56859). Several of
the homologous PDE4 D amino termini have also been
assigned different nomenclature designations in human
and rodent (Additional File 4). In the PDE4 D long
forms, human PDE4D8 (AF53677) is homologous to
mouse (ENSMUSP00000119583) and rat PDE4D4
(NM_001113334). Human PDE4D7 (AF536976) is
homologous to rat PDE4D2 (NM_001113329). As individual PDE4 splice variants likely serve discrete and
highly localized functions, it is important to remain
consistent and accurate when referring to each splice
variant. For the purposes of this study we refer to
PDE4 splice variants in reference to the human ortholog if present.
PDE4 Gene Isoform Evolution

The PDE4 phylogeny was constructed from one representative long form splice variant sequence for each of
our 17 vertebrate species (Additional File 3, Additional
File 1) and one invertebrate (Ciona intestinalis). All teleost long form transcripts were incorporated, as the catalytic domain phylogeny (Additional File 3) suggested the
presence of two teleost PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4C
clades. Within the long form PDE4 phylogeny four distinct gene types were again present in all vertebrates
sampled (except A. carolinensis PDE4C) (Figure 2).
PreENSEMBL genome assembly and PCR screens of
reverse transcribed mRNA (data not shown) from the
sea lamprey (P. marinus) suggest more than one PDE4
gene type is present in this species. Ciona intestinalis
(outgroup) root placement established two main clades
composed of PDE4A and PDE4B, and PDEs 4C and 4 D
genes present in vertebrates studied (Figure 2) (Additional File 3). ENSEMBL genome database screens for
PDE4 s show all teleosts tested (D. rerio, O. lapites, G.
aculeatus, and T. rubripes) contain two PDE4B and
PDE4C genes, however only O. lapites, G. aculeatus,
and T. rubripes contain two PDE4A genes (Additional
File 3, Additional File 1). PDE4 gene duplication
occurred after the divergence of primitive chordates
(Myxiniformes) and before teleost divergence to form
present day PDE4 gene isoforms A-D (Figure 2), suggesting the expansion of this gene family and fixation of
four distinct PDE4 isoforms occurred early in vertebrate
evolution. After PDE4 gene duplication to form the four
present day gene isoforms, teleosts appear to have
undergone additional gene duplications detectable in
PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4C genes. The symmetrical
tree topology follows the (2R) hypothesis of Ohno
[21,22], indicating that present day PDE4 gene number
may be derived from two rounds of genome duplication
occurring early in the vertebrate lineage. Although many

genes are lost after genome duplication events, the
homeostatic necessity for, and phylogenetic maintenance
of the PDE4 genes attests to the importance of this gene
family.
Evolutionary Perspectives on PDE4 Splice Variant Form
Genesis

The intron-exon structure of each PDE4 gene is conserved between isoforms and across species. An exception was found in A. carolinensis, where the PDE4C
gene isoform was not detectable. The exons encoding
for the amino-termini of each splice variant form (long,
short, super-short) are located in tandem within intronic
regions between the same domain junctions for all species examined (Figures. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6). PDE4 long form 5′
exons are all located upstream of the CRFL-UCR1a
exon, short form 5′ exons are between the LR-1 exon
and UCR2a exon. The super-short 5′ exons are all
found between the UCR2a and UCR2b exons. The
amino termini of truncated super-short forms are
initiated at an internal Methionine in the UCR2 region
(Additional File 2, residue number 174), in the species
examined. PDE4 long form splice variants from all four
gene isoforms were detected in all organisms (C. intestinalis through mammals, with the exception of A. carolinensis PDE4C) tested using Ensembl and NCBI EST
databases (Figure 2). PDE4A super-short form splice
variant transcripts were detectable in EST libraries of S.
scrofa, B. taurus, R. norvegicus, M. musculus, C. jacchus,
and H. sapiens (Figure 2, Additional File 1). Amino termini corresponding to super-short form splice variants
were only detectable in the PDE4A genes of S. scrofa
through H. sapiens. Neither short nor truncated supershort PDE4A transcripts were identified from EST
libraries screened. Amino termini corresponding to a
short form transcript were detectable in the PDE4B
genes of Xenopus (NP_001072863) through humans
(NP_001032416), but not in teleosts. PDE4B super-short
form transcripts were detectable in EST libraries from
teleosts (ENSTRUP00000002631) through humans
(EF595686). PDE4B truncated super-short forms
were not detectable in any EST libraries. PDE4C
short and super-short transcripts were not detectable
in any EST libraries screened. A PDE4C truncated
super-short form splice variant transcript and genomic
amino terminus exon were identified in both C. jacchus
(ENSCJAP00000025959)
and
H.
sapiens
(ENSP00000336624), but absent in non-primates analyzed in this study (Additional File 1).
Transcripts from the PDE4 D gene isoform for each of
the short, super-short, and truncated super-short forms
were identified in organisms ranging from rodents to
humans. The disparities in timing and type of splice variant form generation (Figure 2) are likely due to

Page 5 of 14

differences in the formation the 5′ exons and their corresponding alternative transcription start sites. Genomic
analysis of orthologous gene regions performed between
taxa indicated that transcription start sites and 5′ exons
within each PDE4 gene isoform developed through
sequence drift (Additional File 5). Upon incorporation
by sequence drift, all derived taxa encode the amino termini (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6).
The intracellular targeting and microdomain diversity
of the PDE4 family suggests a functional expansion
through the incorporation of different splice variant
forms (long, short, super-short truncated super-short),
as well as the alternative splicing of multiple splice variant 5′ exons from each PDE4 gene isoform (observed in
mammalian PDE4s). There is very limited evidence of
alternative splicing in teleost PDE4 genes. Only one
alternative splicing event (PDE4B super-short) (Additional File 1) is detectable in teleosts. Teleost-specific
PDE4 gene duplications (in PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4C
genes) and paralogous gene conservation increased the
number of long forms for PDE4A,4B, and 4C gene isoforms in D. rerio, and G. aculeatus (O. latipes PDE4A
and 4C) through an increase in gene dosage, in lieu of
long form alternative splicing. Extensive PDE4 alternative splicing is limited in non-mammalian ESTs and
does not appear to be a common property of all vertebrate PDE4 gene isoforms.
PDE4 gene isoforms are both alternatively spliced (primarily in mammals) and duplicated (in teleosts), both of
which can increase PDE4 proteomic diversity. In a
recent study, a correlation was detected between the
size of the gene family and frequency of alternative splicing events, as duplicated gene families had significantly
fewer alternative splicing events than single copy or less
duplicated gene families [23]. This same trend can be
observed in the PDE4 family (Figure 2).
The mammalian evolution of each of the PDE4 splice
variant forms (long, short, super-short, truncated supershort) appears to have occurred at the same domain
junctions independently within each gene isoform (Figure 2). The loss of UCR1 (in short, super-short, truncated super-short forms) as well as segments of UCR2
(in super-short and truncated super-short) may alter
PDE4 enzyme conformational states and therefore catalytic activity [17,24,25]. Furthermore, the MAP kinase
ERK1/2 has been shown to activate the PDE4 short
form PDE4B2, whereas this phosphorylation event inhibits catalytic activity in the PDE4 long forms PDE4B1
and PDE4C2 [26], drawing a possible functional dichotomy that is largely based on the presence or absence of
UCR1. While the evolutionary and functional necessity
for non-long form PDE4 splice variants remains unclear,
our analysis suggests they likely have a distinct role,
unique from long form splice variants in the hydrolysis

and UCR2 domains and may not be entirely related to
the incorporation of variable amino termini.
Conservation of alternatively spliced amino-termini exons
in PDE4 gene isoforms

Four long forms and one super-short form splice variant
from PDE4A are conserved across multiple species. The
amino terminus of the PDE4A long form PDE4A8 is
composed of two exons, both of which are conserved in
the genomes of S. scrofa, B. taurus, C. familiaris, and
C. jacchus, while these exons are not well conserved in
M. musculus (Figure 3). EST searches for PDE4A8 in S.
scrofa and C. jacchus identified splice variants orthologous to PDE4B1, but not orthologs to PDE4A8. A
human PDE4A1 long form splice variant ortholog is
detectable in the transcriptomes of D. rerio, T. rubripes
M. domestica, S. scrofa, C. familiaris, R. norvegicus, M.
musculus, and C. jacchus. The corresponding amino
acid sequence ranges from 61% (D. rerio) to 98%

(C. jacchus) sequence homology. The 5′ exon corresponding to this amino terminus (PDE4A1) is conserved
in the genomes of species from T. rubripes to H. sapiens
(Figure 3). A PDE4A long form splice variant orthologous to H. sapiens PDE4A2 is conserved in the genomes
of C. jacchus and S. scrofa (Figure 3) (Additional File 1).
The amino terminus of this splice variant (PDE4A2) is
much less conserved in M. musculus, which has 51%
sequence identity at the amino acid level between
rodents and primates (not shown). The PDE4A2 splice
variant has EST support in both M. musculus and
C. jacchus. The human PDE4A3/10 ortholog is detectable in the transcriptomes of B. Taurus, R. norvegicus,
M. musculus, and C. jacchus (Additional File 1), with
80-89% amino acid sequence identity (not shown). The
5′ exon corresponding to this amino terminus is detectable in mammalian species from S. scrofa to H. sapiens
(Figure 3), Transcripts corresponding to the human
PDE4A4, a super-short splice variant were detected in
B. Taurus, R. norvegicus, M. musculus, and C. jacchus

using MultiPIP maker. PIP output files were cropped to display only the exons of interest. 5’ exons for PDE4 D long forms PDE4D7, PDE4D4,
PDE4D5, PDE4D3, PDE4D8, and PDE4D9 are colored blue, the short form PDE4 D is colored gray, the super-short form PDE4D6 is colored
orange. Vertical dotted lines represent breaks in the nucleotide sequence, and nucleotide positions as referenced to Hsap PDE4 D along the
bottom scale. The range of nucleotide percent identities shown (between 50% and 100%) is indicated in the upper right corner of the plot.

with the corresponding amino acid sequence sharing
100% sequence identity. The 5′ exon encoding this
amino terminus was detected in the genomes of
S. scrofa to H. sapiens. There is also high sequence identity for the PDE4A4 5′ exon in X. tropicalis, A. carolinensis, and T. rubripes, though the 5′ flanking region
(i.e., promoter region) shares little sequence identity in
these species (not shown).
Two long forms, one short form and one super-short
form splice variant(s) from the PDE4B gene isoform
have both detectable EST transcript and genomic conservation across multiple species (Figure 4), (Additional
File 1). Long form splice variant transcripts, orthologous
to human PDE4B1, can be found in G. aculeatus,
O. latipes, T. rubripes, S. scrofa, E. caballus, R. norvegicus, M. musculus, and C. jacchus, with the amino acid
sequence identity ranging from 94% among mammals
(S. scrofa), to 25% in teleosts (O. latipes). Two exons
encode this amino terminus (PDE4B1), each of which
were found in the genomes of these same species. Transcripts for the second PDE4B long form splice variant,
orthologous to H. sapiens PDE4B3, were detectable in
transcriptomes of X. laevis, S. scrofa, B. taurus, M.
domestica, E. caballus, R. norvegicus, M. musculus, and
C. jacchus (Figure 4), (Additional File 1), with the amino
acid sequence identity ranging from 81-98% from X. laevis to C. jacchus (not shown). The 5′ exon comprising
this amino terminus was found in the genomes of all
species ranging from teleosts to humans (Figure 4). One
short form PDE4B transcript orthologous to human
PDE4B2 was detectable in X. tropicalis, S. scrofa, R. norvegicus, and M. musculus (Additional File 1). The 5′
exon encoding this amino terminus is conserved from
X. tropicalis to H. sapiens, with the corresponding
amino acid sequence ranging from 69-89% identity (not
shown). A PDE4B super-short form orthologous to
human PDE4B5 has both EST and genomic conservation from T. rubripes to H. sapiens, (Figure 4) (Additional File 1). The amino terminus of this splice variant
is 100% identitical (in amino acid sequence) across species (not shown).
PDE4C is the smallest PDE4 gene isoform, and also
contains the fewest total (two) conserved splice variants
(Figure 5), (Additional File 1). Transcripts for the long
form PDE4C1 were found in C. familiaris, E. caballus,
C. jacchus, and H. sapiens, with amino acid sequence
identity ranging from 55-86% (not shown). Genomic
sequence conservation of the PDE4C1 splice variant 5′
exon was found in M. domestica, B. Taurus, C. familiaris, C. jacchus, and H. sapiens. The 5′ exon sequence
encoding this amino terminus (PDE4C1) is not intact in
T. rubripes, and M. musculus (Figure 5). Transcripts for
the second conserved long form splice variant, orthologous to human PDE4C3, were detectable in B. taurus,

C. jacchus, and H. sapiens, with 91-97% amino acid
sequence identity (not shown). Genomic conservation
for the 5′ exon of PDE4C3 was found in B. taurus,
C. familiaris, M. musculus, C. jacchus, and H. sapiens.
T. rubripes and M. domestica lack an ATG start site
(M. domestica and T. rubripes) and 5′ sequence identity
(T. rubripes) for this amino terminus.
The PDE4 D gene isoform contains the greatest number of orthologous 5′ exons in the PDE4 family. Long
form amino termini exons identified with both genomic
conservation and strong EST support are orthologous to
H. sapiens PDE4D3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 (Figure 6), (Additional File 1). With the exception of the long form
PDE4D9, which has EST support (72-100% amino acid
sequence identity) and genomic conservation from
T. rubripes to H. sapiens, PDE4 D long form splice variant conservation is found primarily in mammals. PDE4
D long forms orthologous to human PDE4D3, 4D4,
4D7, and 4D8 all have EST support in B. Taurus and
M. musculus and range from 80-100% amino acid
sequence identity. The exons encoding these long form
amino termini are detectable in several mammalian species (i.e., M. musculus, B. Taurus, M. domestica). The
PDE4 D gene is the only PDE4 gene isoform with
detectable transcripts for short (orthologs to H. sapiens
PDE4D1), super-short (orthologs to H. sapiens
PDE4D6), and truncated super-short (orthologs to H.
sapiens PDE4D2) splice variant forms. Both the short
form PDE4D1 5′ exon and truncated super-short form
PDE4D2 have EST evidence and genomic conservation
in R. norvegicus and H. sapiens (Figure 6), (Additional
File 1). The super-short form orthologous to human
PDE4D6 has EST support in M. domestica, C. familiaris
and M. musculus with 95-97% amino acid sequence
identity. Genome conservation of the 5′ exon for this
splice variant (PDE4D6) was found in T. rubripes, X. tropicalis, A. carolinensis, M. domestica, S. scrofa, B. taurus,
C. familiaris, M. musculus, and C. jacchus. Splice variants orthologous to human PDE4D6 and PDE4B5 have
homologous amino termini to each other (i.e., 4D6 and
4B5 have the same amino termini amino acid sequence).
Our multi-species PDE4 gene isoform alignments performed using PipMaker and transcript presence determined by NCBI EST database screens showed the
evolutionary conservation of select PDE4 splice variant
amino termini across species. Conservation across multiple species has been recognized as a key indicator of
functional importance [27,28], although PDE4 s are
known to be temporally and spatially differentially regulated [14,29,30]. Thus the lack of PDE4 EST support
does not necessarily suggest splice variant absence. As
such, the genomic conservation of splice variant amino
termini were also utilized to infer evolutionary conservation across a wide range of species and confirm the

timing of PDE4 splice variant evolution inferred from
transcript presence or absence. Here we have identified
several PDE4 splice variants from the gene isoforms that
are conserved between multiple species clades. A relatively few of these splice variants have been well
described and functionally characterized; among these
include PDE4A4, PDE4D3, and PDE4D5. The supershort form PDE4A4 has been shown to interact with
SH3-domains of the tyrosyl kinases Lyn [20]. This splice
variant (PDE4A4) also potentially allows cross-talk
between cAMP, phospholipase D, and calcium signaling
[31]. The long form PD4D3 has been shown to interact
with the A-kinase anchoring protein (mAKAP) [32,33]
and has also been suggested to serve a role in ryanodine
receptor function and Ca2+ “leakiness” from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during heart failure [34]. The
long form PDE4D5 is perhaps the best documented
PDE4, and this splice variant forms a complex with barrestin and serves to regulate b2 adrenoreceptor activity
[7,35,36]. These three examples (PDE4A4, 4D3 and
4D5) represent a very small proportion of evolutionarily
conserved PDE4 splice variants. The functional characterization of other conserved splice variants shown in
our study may also prove important in vertebrate cAMP
signaling pathways.

development of the PDE4D6 5′ flanking sequence and
promoter region in teleosts (i.e., T. rubripes) as compared to mammals (i.e., C. familiaris) (Additional File 6:
Supplemental Figure S4A). The “TATA” or HognessGoldberg box, is generally located 20-50 bp upstream of
the transcription start point and controls the transcription start point. A consensus TATA box was found
upstream of the initiation codon for PDE4D6 in H.
sapiens and C. familiaris, but not in M. domestica and
T. rubripes (Additional File 6: Supplemental Figure
S4A). Consensus GC-boxes, which control the initial
binding of RNA polymerase, were identified in H.
sapiens and C. familiaris but not in M. domestica and
T. rubripes. While neither element is uniquely essential
for promoter function, the correlation of the development of these promoter elements with the appearance
of PDE4D6 ESTs suggests sequence drift in the promoter region is responsible for transcription of this splice
variant in mammals more derived than M. domestica.
Detailed biochemical information regarding the proteinprotein interactions of PDE4B5 and PDE4D6 are lacking, and it is unclear if this represents a case of redundancy in the PDE4 family or a specialized localization
(conferred by the amino terminus) in different areas of
the brain.

The Splice Variants PDE4B5 and PDE4D6 Share
Homologous Amino Termini

Conservation and Functionality in PDE4 Regulatory
Domains

The 5′ exon nucleotide sequences of the super-short
splice variants from two different gene isoforms
(PDE4B5 and PDE4D6) share high nucleotide sequence
identity (77-100% between vertebrates sampled) (Additional File 6). Amino acid sequences ranged from 87100% identity among vertebrates (Additional File 6: Supplemental Figure S4C). ESTs and/or genomic detection
of the 4B5 5′ exon were found from teleosts to humans
(Figure 4). In contrast, ESTs for PDE4D6 were identified
for C. familiaris to H. sapiens, though genome conservation for the 5′ exon of PDE4D6 extends to teleosts (Figure 6), (Additional File 6: Supplemental Figure S4B).
Lower vertebrate (basal to C. familiaris) 4D6 upstream
promoter regions appear to not have “TATA” and “GC”
motifs, necessary for transcriptional initiation (Additional File 6: Supplementary Figure 4A).
The splice variants PDE4B5 and PDE4D6 appear to
represent an exception to the rule among PDE4 splice
variant amino termini; they have homologous amino termini (Additional File 6: Supplemental Figure S4C), and
are co-expressed in the brain [37,38]. The 5′ exons for
these super-short form splice variants appeared in their
respective gene isoforms (PDE4B and PDE4D) early in
vertebrate evolution (Figures 4, 6). The difference in the
timing of PDE4B5 and 4D6 transcript appearance in the
vertebrate lineage, is likely due to the relatively delayed

In contrast to the PDE4 splice variant 5′ exons (amino
termini), coding regions found in the LR1, LR2, and
terminal catalytic domain exons are highly conserved
across species (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6) (Additional File 2). LR1 is highly conserved (teleosts to humans for PDE4A,
PDE4B, and PDE4D; placental mammals for PDE4C)
within gene isoforms (Additional File 2). LR-2 is also
only evolutionarily conserved within gene isoforms
(Additional File 2). LR2 is conserved in placental mammals, tetrapods, and vertebrates for PDE4A, PDE4B, and
PDE4 D respectively. The carboxy terminal region of the
PDE4C LR2 is conserved in vertebrates, while the amino
terminal region is conserved in placental mammals.
Located in the carboxy-terminal region of all PDE4
splice variants, ERK2 binding domain and phosphorylation are highly conserved between and among PDE4
gene isoforms across the vertebrate lineage (Additional
File 2). Minor residue variations are detectable in the
carboxy-terminus of X. laevis 4B, and M. musculus, C.
familiaris, and S. scrofa PDE4Cs (Additional File 2).
Evolutionarily conserved motifs between diverse taxa
are indicative of functional importance, and several such
motifs (e.g., PKA phosphorylation of UCR1, and ERK1/2
phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminus) have been
identified and described in PDE4 s [17,26,39]. We
observed previously unidentified evolutionary

Johnson et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:247
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/247

conservation within LR1, LR2 and the c- terminus
among PDE4 s that are likely indicative of functional
importance. The serine-threonine kinase Erk2 has been
shown to both inhibit the long form splice variants
PDE4D3, PDE4B1 and PDE4C2 and activate the short
forms splice variants PDE4B2 and PDE4D1 [26,39]. ERK
phosphorylation of a PDE4A recombinant fragment has
been demonstrated [40], however ERK-mediated phosphorylation of native PDE4A splice variants has not
been shown to date. The observed conservation at this
site across all isoforms strongly suggests ERK regulation
within PDE4A splice variants as well (Additional File 2).
ERK phosphorylation at this site appears to be an
ancient form of PDE4 regulation, as the consensus motif
is found from C. intestinalis to H. sapiens. We also
observed more recent development of evolutionary conservation within the PDE4A LR2. This region has been
shown to interact with the SRC tyrosyl kinase LYN
through an SH3 domain in humans [20]. This highly
conserved region appears to have been inserted in placental mammals (Additional File 2), increasing the
potential mechanisms of PDE4A regulation. This polyproline domain is absent from the rodent PDE4A LR2
region (Additional File 2) signifying a functional divergence between rodents and other mammals in this protein region and is consistent with the general rodentmammalian divergence observed in PDE4 gene evolution (Figure 2). The LR2 in PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4
D are also highly conserved within gene isoform types,
and thus may suggest an as of yet unidentified ancient
functional role. LR1 is also highly conserved within
PDE4 gene isoforms, but less so between gene isoforms.
The functional significance of LR1 is unknown, however
the high conservation observed within isoforms suggests
a likely functionality related to PDE4 gene isoform-specific sequence identity.

Conclusions
In summary, this phylogenetic analysis of PDE4 gene
isoforms and alternative splicing has addressed several
gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary basis for
the functional diversity seen in the multitude of PDE4
splice variants. Following the divergence of invertebrates
(C. intestinalis) and primitive vertebrates (teleosts), multiple gene duplications produced the present day PDE4
gene isoforms (A-D). The production of multiple protein products from these genes through alternative splicing is limited in primitive vertebrates. Integration of
distinctive long form amino termini and expansion of
splice variant type (short, super-short, truncated supershort) is largely introduced in tetrapods and greatly
expanded in mammals. This growth in splice variant
identity (unique amino termini) and different form types
appears at different times throughout vertebrate

Page 12 of 14

evolution and occurs independently within each gene
isoform. Sequence drift appears to be responsible for the
development of PDE4 amino termini-coding exons, as
well as promoter development.
The most physiologically distinguishing characteristic
of PDE4 splice variants are the amino termini, and from
each gene several splice variant amino termini have
been highly conserved throughout evolution. These conserved splice variants likely represent the functional core
of the expansive PDE4 proteome. In addition to the
splice variant-specific amino termini, several regulatory
domains (including PKA phosphorylation, long form
dimerization and ERK phosphorylation) have remained
essentially completely conserved. The conservation of
these regulatory domains, which provide an additional
level of functional regulation, underpins the importance
of these domains in an evolutionary functional context.

Methods
Sequence Data Acquisition

PDE4 nucleotide and protein sequences were obtained
from a search of NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and
ENSEMBL http://www.ensembl.org genomic databases.
The UCR-1, UCR-2, and catalytic domain nucleotide
and amino acid sequences from human, rat and mouse
PDE4A-D splice variants were used to identify annotated and unannoted PDE4 transcript and protein
sequences in vertebrates and invertebrates (Ciona intestinalis) using NCBI BLASTP, TBLASTN, EST database
searches and Ensembl (release 41). Select species, spanning the vertebrate lineage, used for this study include:
mammals-Homo sapiens (H. sap), Callithrix jacchus (C.
jac), Mus musculus (M. mus), Rattus norvegicus (Rnor),
Canis familiaris (C. fam), Equus caballus (E. cab), Bos
Taurus (B. tau), Sus scrofa (S. scr), Monodelphis domestica (M. dom), reptiles- Anolis carolinensis (A. car),
amphibians- Xenopus tropicalis (X. tro), teleosts-Danio
rerio (D. rer), Takifugu rubripes (T. rub), Oryzias latipes
(O. lat), Gasterosteus aculeatus (G. acu); chordates- Sea
lamprey Petromyzon marinus (P. mar).
Phylogenetic Analysis

PDE4 translated amino acid sequences were aligned
using the Clustal function of Mega v4, according to the
default settings. PDE4 splice variant relationships based
on the catalytic domain were determined using the
Neighbor Joining algorithm of Mega v4. The tree shown
represents three independent runs, each with 1000 bootstrap replicates using the PAM matrix of amino acid
evolution. One long form splice variant nucleotide
sequence from each clade was selected for each species
of interest (representative of species individual PDE4
gene isoforms, highlighted in Additional File 3), and
translated in the clustal function of MEGA. Mr Bayes

and PhyML were used to construct a vertebrate PDE4
gene family phylogeny using the amino acid sequences
common to all PDE4 long forms (UCR-1, UCR-2, and
catalytic domains). The tree represents three and four
independent runs of 1000 bootstrap replicates and four
million generations, in PhyML and Mr Bayes, respectively. Mr Bayes was allowed to estimate the best fixed
rate model of protein evolution during the run by setting the prior for amino acid model to mixed. The best
fixed rate model was Jones-Taylor Thornton (JTT)
model (gamma = 0.946). PhyML analyses were run
under this model as well.
Identification of Promoter elements

Upstream flanking regions of the PDE4D6 5′ exon were
analyzed using TRANSFAC motif search [41] http://
motif.genome.jp/, using a cutoff score of 85 for all vertebrate motifs.
Exon conservation using Percent Identity Plots (PIP)

Multi PipMaker http://bio.cse.psu.edu [42,43] was used
for PDE4 gene comparisons across vertebrate taxa with
respect to exon presence/conservation. In each case, the
human PDE4 gene of interest (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C,
or PDE4D) was used as the reference gene, in the forward orientation. Multi PIP maker offers an additional
function in which user defined exon positions are displayed. Exon positions (coordinates) within each human
PDE4 gene were determined using the human gene
sequence and conserved splice variant amino termini,
facultative (not present in all forms) and constitutive
exons (present in all forms) within the two sequence
BLAST (bl2seq) function from NCBI http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and then formatted into an exon
file for use in Multi PipMaker.
