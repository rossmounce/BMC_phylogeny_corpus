The performance of the Congruence Among
Distance Matrices (CADM) test in phylogenetic
analysis
Véronique Campbell*, Pierre Legendre, François-Joseph Lapointe

Abstract
Background: CADM is a statistical test used to estimate the level of Congruence Among Distance Matrices. It has
been shown in previous studies to have a correct rate of type I error and good power when applied to
dissimilarity matrices and to ultrametric distance matrices. Contrary to most other tests of incongruence used in
phylogenetic analysis, the null hypothesis of the CADM test assumes complete incongruence of the phylogenetic
trees instead of congruence. In this study, we performed computer simulations to assess the type I error rate and
power of the test. It was applied to additive distance matrices representing phylogenies and to genetic distance
matrices obtained from nucleotide sequences of different lengths that were simulated on randomly generated
trees of varying sizes, and under different evolutionary conditions.
Results: Our results showed that the test has an accurate type I error rate and good power. As expected, power
increased with the number of objects (i.e., taxa), the number of partially or completely congruent matrices and the
level of congruence among distance matrices.
Conclusions: Based on our results, we suggest that CADM is an excellent candidate to test for congruence and,
when present, to estimate its level in phylogenomic studies where numerous genes are analysed simultaneously.

Background
In phylogenetic studies, data matrices are assembled and
analysed to infer evolutionary relationships among species or higher taxa. Depending on the study, characterstate data or distance matrices may be used, and several
different types of data may be available to estimate the
phylogeny of a particular group [1]. An increasing number of phylogenomic studies are published for data sets
including more than 100 genes [2-10]. Whereas character-state data (e.g., nucleotide sequences) are commonly
used for parsimony, maximum likelihood or Bayesian
analyses, distance methods can be selected as an alternative option to decrease computing time when analysing
large data sets, or else, can be used in comparative studies where the primary data are not available.
Different approaches have been proposed to analyse
the growing amount of information that may originate
from different sources. The total evidence approach

[11], also called character congruence approach [sensu
[12]] or combined analysis [sensu [13]], combines different data sets in a single supermatrix [14-17]. The taxonomic congruence approach [sensu [12]], or consensus
approach [13], analyses each matrix separately, and
combines the resulting trees a posteriori using a consensus [18-22] or a supertree method [23-26]. The pros
and cons of these competing approaches have been
debated at length in the literature [7,17,21,22,27-32]. An
intermediate approach, referred to as the conditional
data combination, consists in testing a priori the level of
congruence of different data sets. Only the data sets that
are considered statistically congruent, i.e. in phylogenetic agreement, are combined in a supermatrix. The
remaining incongruent data sets are analysed separately
[13,19,33-35].
The approach used often depends on the level of congruence or incongruence in the data. In phylogenetic
analysis, “incongruence” can be defined as differences in
phylogenetic trees. It is observed when different partitions, or data sets, sampled on the same taxa suggest

different evolutionary histories [36]. However, incongruence may also arise when the data violate the assumptions of the phylogenetic method. Incongruence among
data sets is fairly common and can be present at varying
degrees [37]. Hence, statistical tests have been designed
to detect the presence of incongruence and its magnitude [36]. In general, such incongruence tests are used
to determine if the topological differences observed
could have simply arose by chance [38]. The null
hypothesis of most of these tests (H0) is congruence, i.e.,
topologically identical trees, where any topological difference is the result of stochastic variation in the data
sets [see [22], [38] for reviews]. The most commonly
used test of this type is the Incongruence Length Difference test [ILD: [39]]. However, numerous problems are
known to be associated to it. For example, type I error
rates were shown to be well above the nominal significance level when data sets (with great differences in
substitution rates among sites) were compared [40,41].
Therefore, nominal significance levels of 0.01 or 0.001
have been suggested as more appropriate [36]. Also,
power was low when short nucleotide sequences simulated on different tree structures were compared [41].
Numerous factors have been described to explain differences in phylogenetic trees obtained from the analysis of data sets containing the same species. A wide
range of evolutionary processes may cause nucleotides
at different sites to evolve differently, for examples due
to their codon positions or to different functional constraints [42-44]. Also, various parts of the genome may
have experienced different phylogenetic histories (e.g.,
mitochondrial vs. nuclear genes) and trees inferred
from different data types (e.g., morphological or molecular data) may support different phylogenies [45].
Other evolutionary processes can explain incongruence
between data sets: horizontal transfer, duplications,
insertions or losses, incomplete lineage sorting, mobile
elements, recombination, hybridization and introgression [see [37], [38] for an exhaustive list]. Furthermore,
the use of an inappropriate method to analyse a given
data set may lead to a spurious phylogeny, that can be
erroneously incongruent to some extent with another
phylogeny that has been correctly estimated [22,33,40].
Thus, given two data sets, one of which has parameters
prone to long-branch attraction [46,47], the choice of
an inconsistent phylogenetic method to analyse both
data sets may produce different trees. Incongruence
due to systematic errors can be addressed by changing
the evolutionary model or the phylogenetic method so
that it conforms better to the data. However, incongruence resulting from genealogical discordance processes
must be detected and handled in some appropriate
ways, e.g., by using phylogenetic network inference
methods [see [48] for a review]. Thus, three main

Page 2 of 15

causes can be invoked to explain incongruence: 1) different phylogenetic trees may be inferred due to random sampling errors, 2) different trees may be
produced due to the presence of systematic errors,
leading to erroneous phylogenetic inference, or 3) real
differences may exist between phylogenetic trees due
to contrasting evolutionary histories [38].
Alternatively, the term “congruence” is often used to
describe data sets, characters or trees that correspond to
identical (or compatible) relationships among taxa [49].
However, many authors use a definition of congruence
that is looser than the previously described identical
topology and that incorporate varying degrees of topological similarities. For example, taxonomic congruence,
as defined by [12], is the degree to which different classifications of the same taxa support the same groupings.
Since the pioneer study of [12], different measures and
indices have been proposed to quantify the level of congruence [see review by [18]]. Conditional data combination often relies on such indices to determine the degree
of congruence and on statistical tests in order to determine whether or not the data sets should be combined
[13,18,33].
As described above, the term “congruence” and
“incongruence” can have a more or less strict meaning
with regards to the level of similarity. The definitions
used in this paper are in concordance with the test of
congruence among distance matrices (CADM). CADM
was introduced by [50] and is applicable to two or more
matrices. The null hypothesis of the test (H 0 ) is the
complete incongruence of all trees (two or more), which
corresponds to phylogenies with different topologies
and/or very different branch lengths. Hence, the method
can also account for branch lengths [as in [51]]. For two
matrices (or two trees), the alternative hypothesis (H1) is
that the inferred trees are partially or completely congruent. When more than two matrices (or trees) are
tested, H1 postulates that at least two trees in the group
are partially or completely congruent. It is then possible
to test for specific pairs. In this paper, incongruence
refers to phylogenetic trees with different topologies,
which suggests completely distinct evolutionary histories. At the opposite, congruence refers to two or more
identical trees with an underlying identical evolutionary
history (i.e., complete congruence or topological identity)
or to two or more phylogenetic trees with a partial
degree of similarity in their evolutionary relationships
(i.e., partial congruence). The level of congruence can be
measured by the test statistic, which ranges from 0 to 1.
More specifically, given two or more data sets (e.g.,
different genes) studied on the same species, a concordance statistic [Kendall’s W statistic: [52], [53]] is calculated among the distance matrices corresponding to the
gene sequences or to the trees and tested against a

Campbell et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:64
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/64

distribution of permuted values to estimate the probability that the data correspond to the null hypothesis.
CADM is an extension of the Mantel test of matrix correspondence, which can be used to test the null hypothesis of complete incongruence of the distance matrices
(corresponding to all data sets or trees under study). As
a complement to the p-value, the W statistic provides
an estimate of the degree of congruence of two or more
matrices on a scale between 0 (no congruence) and 1
(complete congruence). Note that when trees have identical topologies but different branch lengths, a statistical
conclusion of partial congruence or even incongruence
may be reached, depending on the level of differences
among the distance matrices that cause differences in
relative distance rankings. The test allows users to
detect these two cases; thus, both topological and phylogenetic congruence can be tested with CADM (see the
Methods section).
A posteriori tests can be used to identify which data
sets are congruent and to estimate their level of congruence. When the level of congruence among all distance matrices is low, researchers can decide to analyse
the matrices separately or in subgroups. However,
rejection of independence of the gene trees does not
imply that inference of a tree from the combined data
set is appropriate. In the case of partial congruence,
phylogenetic network methods [48,54], instead of traditional tree reconstruction methods, can be more appropriate to combine congruent data sets into a single
analysis. Indeed, in these cases, evolutionary relationships may be better depicted as reticulated relationships. Additional tests or studies can also be performed
to determine the causes underlying partial congruence
[e.g., [55]]. Thus, with its null hypothesis (H0) of complete incongruence of all trees, CADM differs from
most other available phylogenetic tests of congruence/
incongruence, which assume a common evolutionary
history (H 0 : congruence) and test the alternative
hypothesis of different histories among the data sets
(H1: incongruence).
Previously published simulations have shown that the
global and a posteriori CADM tests have a correct type
I error rate and good power when applied to dissimilarity matrices computed from independently-generated
raw data [50]. Identical results were obtained in simulations involving ultrametric distance matrices [56].
CADM has also been successfully used to detect congruence among phylogenetic trees obtained from different gene sequences [57]. In this paper, we expand on
previous CADM simulations to assess the performance
of the test when it is applied to phylogenetic trees. Specifically, the type I error rate and power of the global
and a posteriori CADM tests were assessed using distance matrices obtained from nucleotide sequences

simulated on additive trees under various phylogenetic
conditions.

Results
Type I error rate

Type I error rate was evaluated by calculating the proportion of replicated simulations that rejected the null
hypothesis when H0 was true by construct. To construct
data sets under a true H 0 of complete incongruence
among matrices, IM were compared using CADM.
Table 1 presents type I error rates of the global CADM
test, at a nominal significance level of 0.05, obtained for
different numbers of IM (2, 3, 4, 5 and 10); n (10, 25, 50
and 100); and L (1000, 5000, 10 000 and 20 000 bp). In
all cases, the 95% CI of the rejection rates included the
nominal 0.05 alpha level, suggesting an adequate type I
error rate when CADM is applied to compare distance
matrices in a phylogenetic context. Type I error rates
were also investigated for a posteriori CADM test,
where matrices included in a set under comparisons are
permuted one at a time. As for the global test, in all
cases and for each matrix, the 95% CI included the
nominal 0.05 alpha level, suggesting an adequate type I
error rate (results not shown).
Power: Different levels of congruence among matrices

The estimated power is the proportion of replicates for
which the null hypothesis is rejected when H0 is false by
construct. For 1000 replicates, a power of 1.0 (i.e., rejection rates of 1.0) indicates that all replicates rejected the
false null hypothesis, and thus power is maximal. Figure
1 shows power curves obtained when different numbers
of taxa were permuted to construct congruent matrices
(CM = 3, M = 5), L = 10 000 bp and n = 10 and
50 taxa. When the proportion of permuted taxa is equal
to 0, the distance matrices were obtained from nucleotide sequences simulated on identical trees (CM I ).
When the proportion of permuted taxa is greater than
0, the distance matrices were obtained from nucleotide
sequences simulated on partly similar trees (CMP), and
thus, it corresponds to different levels of partial congruence (depending on the number of permuted taxa).
Power decreased with a decrease in the level of congruence among the three matrices (i.e., with an increase in
the number of taxa permuted). A power close to 1.0 was
observed when identical trees were used (CMI), regardless of matrix sizes (n). Reduced power (i.e., less than
0.5) was observed for matrices with 25% or more permuted taxa, when n = 10 taxa; whereas it was observed
for matrices with 50% or more permuted taxa, when
n = 50 taxa.
In a posteriori CADM tests, the rejection rate of each
individual matrix was similar to the power level
obtained in the global test. Figure 2 presents the

rejection rates obtained for each matrix tested individually for M = 5 (same matrices as those used for simulations presented in Figure 1). The three partly similar
matrices (CMP) were obtained from nucleotide sequences
simulated under identical evolutionary conditions. In
situations where not all matrices are congruent in a replicate, incongruent matrices are expected to fail to reject
the null hypothesis of incongruence (i.e., the rejection
rate corresponding to type I error), whereas partially congruent matrices should reject H0 (i.e., the rejection rate
corresponding to power). This is exemplified in Figure 2,
where partially congruent matrices (matrices 1, 2 and 3)
present rejection rates above 0.05, thus above the significance level alpha that was used for each test. Rejection
rates for incongruent matrices 4 and 5 were near 0.05,
for both n = 10 and 50 taxa. The power curves in Figure
2 are nearly identical to those in Figure 1 for data sets of
the same size n, when partially congruent matrices were
tested (matrices 1, 2 and 3). Tables 2 and 3 present rejection rates for M = 5, and that included a varying number
of CM. In Table 2, CM correspond to distance matrices
obtained from nucleotide sequences simulated on identical trees (CMI), whereas in Table 3, CM correspond to
distance matrices obtained from nucleotide sequences
simulated on partly similar trees with 40% of permuted
taxa (CMP). For both tables, power increased with (1) an
increase in the number of objects (n); (2) an increase in
the number of congruent matrices (CM); and (3) an
increase in sequence lengths (L). However, power
increased much more rapidly in Table 2, which corresponds to a situation of complete congruence, with maximum power obtained when three or more CM were
included in a replicate, regardless of matrix sizes (n). In
Table 3, which corresponds to a situation of partial congruence, maximum power was observed only for four
matrices or more, included in a set of M = 5, and with
larger matrices (n = 100 taxa).

Power: Effect of different evolutionary parameters

A false H0 was constructed by including a different number of completely
congruent matrices (CMI) together with a different number of incongruent
matrices (IM), for a total of five distance matrices (M = 5). When CMI = 5, all
matrices included in the test are congruent. Rejection rates are given at a
significance level of 0.05, with 95% confidence intervals in parentheses.
Calculated from 1000 replicates, except for cells with * (100 replicates). Dashes
(-) correspond to a CI of 1.000 - 1.000.

Power was also calculated for distance matrices obtained
from nucleotide sequences simulated on identical trees
under a GTR model, with identical or different evolutionary parameters. In Table 4, distance matrices obtained
from nucleotide sequences simulated with identical evolutionary parameters were compared, for CMI = 2. Rejection rates of pairwise comparisons tested for different
values of mutation rates (s) and heterogeneity of substitution rates among sites (a) are presented. In Table 5, distance matrices obtained from nucleotide sequences
simulated with contrasting evolutionary parameters were
compared. In both cases, and for every condition tested,
rejection rates were high, with at least 79% of the replicates rejecting H0. The lowest rejection rate was observed
when matrices obtained from nucleotide sequences

(i.e., s = 0.02; a = 0.06) were tested. But in general, most
cases rejected the null hypothesis of complete incongruence (i.e., power of 1.0). Identical simulations were also
performed for CMI = 5, M = 5; and rejection rates were
of 1.0 in every case (results not shown).

Discussion
Incongruence among data sets is widespread in phylogenetic analyses [58]. Our simulations clearly demonstrate

A different number of partially congruent matrices (CMP) and a different
number of incongruent matrices (IM) were included in each test, for a total of
five distance matrices (M = 5). To generate CMP, nucleotide sequences were
simulated on partly similar trees (with permutations of 40% of n). Rejection
rates are given at a significance level of 0.05, with 95% confidence intervals in
parentheses. Calculated from 1000 replicates, except for cells with * (100
replicates). Dashes (-) correspond to a CI of 1.000 - 1.000.

the validity of CADM to estimate the level of congruence (or to detect incongruence) among different data
sets or partitions and to test its statistical significance.
However, in comparison to other tests used in phylogenetic analysis, the null and alternative hypotheses are
reversed. Most phylogenetic incongruence tests assume
that the data sets share an identical evolutionary history
and the null hypothesis is congruence (i.e., topological
identity) among trees [38]. On the contrary, the null
hypothesis of CADM is complete incongruence.

Kendall’s coefficient of concordance W is widely used in
other fields, especially psychology, where it is used to
assess the degree of correspondence or strength of association among different estimators [53,59]. In a phylogenetic context, CADM evaluates the level of congruence,
i.e., the degree of agreement among different estimators
(data partitions or genes) of phylogenies, represented by
their evolutionary distances, and can be used to test for
congruence among matrices or trees.
In order to investigate type I error rates, which is the
proportion of replicates that rejected H0 when it was
true by construct, incongruent distance matrices were
compared. In every case, the 95% CI of the rejection
rate included the nominal significance level of 0.05 used
for the test (Table 1). Hence, CADM accurately detects
completely incongruent matrices even when multiple
data partitions are tested simultaneously. In comparison,
the incongruence length difference test [ILD, [39]] produces inflated type I error rates under particular conditions. Computer simulations were designed in [41] to
assess the performance of ILD under different conditions of rejection of the null hypothesis (i.e., congruence
between data sets). In that paper, observed rejection
rates were well above the alpha level when sequences
were simulated on identical trees, but with important
differences in the substitution rates among sites.
Furthermore, the rejection rates increased for longer
sequences and for asymmetrical trees. Similarly, ILD
was shown to be strongly biased in detecting topological
congruence [40], and to be negatively influenced by the
presence of a substantial number of noisy characters
[60]. Different methods have been proposed to alleviate
this problem, such as using an alternative null model
[60] or an arcsine transformation of the standardized
length of the trees in order to linearism the relationship
between noise and tree length [61].
Numerous congruence tests have also been designed
recently such as principal component analysis on loglikelihood ratios or p-values [62], or heat maps to
identify groups of congruent markers [63,64]. Bayesian
approaches have also been suggested [65,66]. Caveats
associated to each method are discussed in [67], where a
hierarchical clustering method based on log-likelihood
ratios [35] is introduced to test congruence. However,
these tests are dependent upon tree inference [67], and
thus could produce spurious results if inadequate models of evolution are used [68,69]. When using the
CADM procedure, it is possible to compare the results
obtained by computing a distance matrix on the nucleotide sequences using different distances or different
substitution models to investigate possible bias. Alternatively, CADM can also be applied to the path-length distance matrices obtained from phylogenetic trees [57].
These different possibilities were all tested in

preliminary simulations (not reported here), and no
effect on the outcome of the test was observed.
As observed in previous simulation studies [50,56], the
power of CADM increased with the number of taxa,
with the level of congruence and with the number of
congruent matrices within a set of distance matrices
(Figures 1 and 2, Tables 2 and 3). Thus, the test performs according to expectations. Indeed, the power of a
test should increase with the number of objects and
with effect size, that is, the degree to which congruence
is present [70]. Interestingly, power also tends to
increase with longer nucleotide sequences from which
distance matrices are calculated. This novel observation
is opposed to the prediction in [50], where it is showed
that power is not affected by the number of variables in
the raw data. These authors argue that the number of
variables should not affect the outcome of the test since
data partitions are converted into distance matrices
prior to computing the test. However, a weighted version of CADM, which can be used to assign weights to
each matrix in the global analysis, is presented in [50].
Comparison of distance matrices obtained from nucleotide sequences is a particular application of the CADM
test. We believe that the higher power observed for
longer sequences can be explained by the number of
informative sites. However, it appears that power
increases more rapidly with the number of taxa
than with the number of characters, and even more
rapidly with the number of congruent matrices under
comparison.
When the overall level of congruence decreases
among congruent matrices, so does power (Figure 1).
For nucleotide sequence matrices simulated on phylogenetic trees with 40% permuted taxa (partial congruence),
a drastic decrease in power was observed when compared to nucleotide sequence matrices simulated on
identical phylogenetic trees (complete congruence, Table
2 vs. Table 3). The greater the effect size, the greater the
power of the test will be [70]. Tables 4 and 5 present
the rejection rates for two matrices that have been
simulated on identical trees (i.e., complete congruence),
and nearly all cases tested rejected the null hypothesis
of complete incongruence, regardless of the evolutionary
parameters used. In this study, topological differences
are reflected by a decrease in congruence among the
sequence matrices, and this can be interpreted as noise
in the data or to real incongruence. Indeed, power
decreases quite abruptly with an increase in topological
differences (Figure 1). The level of congruence among
distance matrices is indicated by the statistic value in a
posteriori tests.
One of the main advantages of CADM lies in its ability to test several matrices in a single analysis, and identify partially or completely congruent and incongruent

Page 8 of 15

members of a set of matrices. This is achieved through
a posteriori testing, which compares each matrix to all
other matrices by permuting a single matrix at a time.
Our results show that power of a posteriori CADM tests
is equivalent to the power observed for the global test
(Figures 1 and 2). When the null hypothesis of incongruence is rejected, a posteriori tests should be used to
identify the matrices that can be combined in a supermatrix, and those that should be analysed separately, or
combined in a supernetwork approach [48,54]. Other
tests, such as ILD, can be modified to test for incongruence among multiple matrices. Different approaches
have been proposed to identify incongruent matrices
within a set of multiple matrices; the methods and
problems associated are discussed in [38,71]. The CONCATERPILLAR program also allows testing for incongruence among multiple matrices through pairwise
comparisons [67]. However, the number of tests
increases exponentially with the number of data sets,
and it becomes excessively computationally demanding
when numerous data sets have to be compared.

Conclusions
In the light of our results, CADM has proven to be statistically valid to detect partial or complete congruence
among distance matrices and estimate its level in a phylogenetic context. One important advantage of this permutation method is its computational efficiency in
significance testing. CADM offers several other advantages with respect to previously described incongruence
tests: (1) The statistic is calculated directly from the distance matrices, thus different types of data can be compared after convertion to distance matrices using an
appropriate function. (2) Data that readily come in the
form of distance matrices do not have to be further
transformed into character-state data matrices. (3)
Given that distances can be calculated directly from the
raw data without inferring a phylogenetic tree, possible
biases introduced by the use of an inappropriate phylogenetic method can be reduced. (4) Also, appropriate
distances can be chosen for each individual data set to
accurately model its evolutionary parameters. (5) If
needed, path-length distances calculated on phylogenetic
trees can also be used, which provide an interesting
method to test for congruence among different trees in
a supertree approach. (6) Distance matrices can be
weighted differentially to account for different numbers
of characters. (7) A posteriori tests can be performed to
identify which particular matrices are congruent among
all data sets tested. (8) An estimate of the level of congruence can be obtained by the statistic value of a posteriori test. With the growing amount of taxa and
sequences that are used in phylogenomics, CADM offers
a simple alternative to compare multiple matrices and

Campbell et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:64
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/64

identify congruent data partitions. CADM could also be
used in cophylogeny studies, where congruence between
species phylogenies is assessed to determine the level of
host specificity [e.g., [72-74]]. Further simulations
designed specifically in a coevolution, cospeciation or
cophylogeny context could be performed to validate the
use of CADM in these particular settings.

Methods
CADM test

The null hypothesis (H0) of the global CADM test is the
complete incongruence of the matrices under study,
whether these matrices contain pairwise genetic distances, pairwise path-length distances, or pairwise topological distances. Rejecting H0 indicates that at least two
matrices contain a certain amount of congruent information. The global statistic value measures the level of
congruence for partially congruent matrices, with a
maximum value of 1 indicating complete congruence
among the matrices (i.e., identical rankings of distance
matrices). One advantage of the test is that congruence
can easily be detected and measured at different steps of
the analysis, since CADM can be applied to any type of
distance matrices (Figure 3). Thus, it is possible to distinguish between different types of congruence: (1)
genetic congruence, (2) phylogenetic congruence, and
(3) topological congruence. Genetic congruence can be
tested through comparisons of distance matrices calculated on the sequence data (with an uncorrected measure, or one corrected with an evolutionary model, see
Test 1: Figure 3). Alternatively, the test can be applied
to the path-length distance matrices corresponding to
the inferred trees in order to determine the overall phylogenetic congruence (see Test 2: Figure 3). Topologically congruent trees with branch lengths that differ
enough to change the ranking of the values may be considered incongruent (see the example given in Figure 4).
To detect such cases, an additional test can be performed by setting all branch lengths to 1, so that only
topologies are represented by the distance matrices (see
Test 3: Figure 3). Preliminary simulations showed that
the CADM test had an adequate type I error rate and
good power, whether it is applied to genetic or phylogenetic distance matrices. Thus, most of the simulations
were performed on genetic distance matrices because
this approach allows users to determine, before phylogenetic inference, if the data matrices must be treated in a
separate or combined analysis.
A posteriori tests can be used to identify incongruent
and congruent matrices in a set. To determine the
groups of potentially congruent matrices that could be
tested, matrix correlations (also called Mantel statistics)
based on ranks can be used. The test statistic W gives
an estimate of the level of congruence, which ranges

Page 9 of 15

from 0 (complete incongruence) to 1 (complete congruence). After CADM tests, the completely congruent
matrices can be combined in a supermatrix analysis, or
analysed together using a supernetwork approach in the
case of partially congruent matrices [e.g., [54], [75]]. A
summary of the computations to perform the CADM
test follows:
• The upper off-diagonal section of each distance
matrix is unfolded and written into a vector corresponding to row i in a worktable.
• The entries of each row are transformed into ranks
according to their values.
• The sum of ranks (Rj) is calculated for each column
j of the table.
• The mean ( R ) of all Rj values is calculated.
• The Kendall coefficient of concordance (W) is computed using the following formula:
W=

p2

n3

12S
− n − pT

where p is the number of matrices, n is the number of
distances in each matrix, S is obtained using:
n

(Rj − R)2

S=
j=1

and T is a correction factor for tied ranks:
m
3
t k − tk

T=
k=1

in which tk is the number of tied ranks for each k of
m groups of ties. Kendall’s W statistic is simply the variance of the row sums of ranks Rj divided by the maximum possible value that this variance can take, which
occurs when all data matrices are in total agreement.
Thus, W ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents a complete disagreement in the rankings of the distances
among the different matrices, and a value of 1 is
observed when the distance matrices are in complete
agreement.
• W is transformed into a Friedman’s c2, which is a
pivotal statistic appropriate for testing, using the following formula:
χ 2 = p (n − 1) W

Statistical conclusion: Phylogenetic congruence

is available in R 2.9.0 [76,77], within the Ape 2.3 package [78,79].
For the simulations described below, one thousand
replicates were simulated for each combination of parameters, unless stated otherwise. For each replicate, 999
random permutations were computed to estimate the
reference distribution of the CADM statistic. We calculated the rate of rejection of H0 with its 95% confidence
interval (CI), at a nominal significance level of 0.05, for
cases where H0 was true (type I error rate) and for cases
where H 0 was false (power). All the analyses were

performed on ten Power Mac G5, with PowerPC 970
MP processors (2 × 2.5 GHz).
Type I error rate

The type I error rate, which is the probability of rejecting H0 when the data conform to this hypothesis, was
assessed for both the global and a posteriori CADM
tests. A statistical test is valid if the rejection rate of H0
is smaller than or equal to the nominal significance level
of the test [80]. Given that H 0 postulates complete
incongruence resulting from independent phylogenetic

Campbell et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:64
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/64

processes, we considered H 0 to be true by construct
when distance matrices calculated on nucleotide
sequences simulated on independently-generated phylogenetic trees were compared. To do so, random additive
distance matrices were obtained using the method proposed by [51]. Such distance matrices correspond to
trees with random topologies, random permutations of
the taxon labels, and branch lengths assigned at random
from the distribution of actual branch lengths. Phylogenetic trees were computed from the distance matrices
using a neighbor joining algorithm [NJ: [81]] in PAUP*
4.0 [82]. Nucleotide sequences were simulated on the
phylogenetic trees using Seq-Gen 1.3.2 [83]. To reproduce the complexity of actual substitutions observed in
real sequence data, we used a general time-reversible
model [GTR: [84-86]] following a gamma distribution
[Γ: [87]] with invariant sites (I). Parameters were identical to those used in [88]. Accordingly, the equilibrium
frequencies of nucleotides A, C, G, and T were: gA =
0.1776, gC = 0.3336, gG = 0.2595, gT = 0.2293, the relative substitution rates were: rAC = 3.297, rAG = 12.55,
rAT = 1.167, rCG = 2.060, rCT = 13.01, rGT = 1.0, and
parameters a and I were 0.8168 and 0.5447 respectively.
Distance matrices were calculated from the nucleotide
sequence matrices using a p distance [89], corrected
with the same parameters as those used to simulate the
sequences. Given that the sequences were simulated on
randomly-generated phylogenetic trees, the distance
matrices obtained are incongruent matrices (IM). In
order to explore various situations that might be
encountered in phylogenetic analysis, different conditions were tested: different number of independent distance matrices (IM = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10), different
number of taxa in each matrix (n = 10, 25, 50 and 100)
and varying lengths of nucleotide sequences (L = 1000,
5000, 10 000 and 20 000 bp). The simulation protocol is
illustrated in Figure 5.
Power

Power, which is the rate of rejection of a false H0, was
evaluated for different conditions of application of
CADM. Rejection rates of H0 were calculated with sets
of distance matrices that included varying numbers of
congruent matrices (CM) with different levels of similarity and different evolutionary parameters. The number of matrices (M) varied in a set and included
incongruent matrices (IM) in addition to CM, for cases
where CM < M.
Power: Different levels of congruence among matrices

Nucleotide sequences were simulated under a GTR + Γ +
I model on the NJ trees obtained from partly similar
matrices (CMP) and from identical matrices (CMI). CMP
were generated by random permutations of different

Page 12 of 15

numbers of taxa and branch lengths from a random additive distance matrix. As the number of permuted taxa
increases, so does the distortion of the original matrix,
whereas the level of congruence among matrices
decreases. The number of taxa permuted varied according to the total number of taxa (n) included in each
matrix, in order to maintain the same proportion of the
taxa permuted regardless of the matrix size. The effect of
the level of congruence on power was tested for CMP =
3, out of a total of five matrices (M = 5), with n = 10 or
50, and L = 10 000 bp. The power of a posteriori tests
was also investigated with the same sets of CMP . The
number of taxa permuted varied from 0 to 60% of the
total number of taxa. Additional simulations were performed to compare the particular case of 0% permuted
taxa, which correspond to CMI (i.e., near 100% congruence among matrices) to CMP with 40% permuted taxa.
For these analyses, a total of five distance matrices were
compared (M = 5) but with varying number of CMI or
CMP (i.e., 0, 2, 3, 4 or 5); n = 10, 25, 50 or 100; and L =
1000, 5000, 10 000 or 20 000 bp. When CMI or CMP = 0,
only incongruent matrices (IM) were included in the set
of five matrices, which corresponds to a true H0. A false
H 0 was constructed when CM I or CM P ≥ 2, and all
matrices were congruent when CMI or CMP = 5.
Power: Effect of different evolutionary parameters

Because genes controlled by different evolutionary processes can share an identical evolutionary history (i.e.,
branching pattern), we investigated the effect of different
evolutionary parameters on the power of the CADM
test. Following [58], nucleotide sequences were simulated under the GTR + Γ + I model described above but
with different mutation rates (s = 0.02 and 0.4) and different heterogeneity levels of substitution rates among
sites (a = 0.06 and 0.8168). Homogeneity of substitution
rates among sites were simulated using a = 200. The
same phylogenetic tree was used to simulate nucleotide
sequence matrices representing different partitions
within a replicate, but different tree topologies were
used for each replicate. Nucleotide sequence matrices
simulated with identical or different evolutionary
parameters on an identical tree were compared for M =
2 or 5; s = 0.02 or 0.4; a = 0.06, 0.8168 or 200; CMI = 2
or 5; n = 10, 25, 50 or 100; and L = 1000, 5000, 10 000
or 20 000 bp. Nucleotide sequences were simulated
under the same GTR parameters as above, except for s
and a that varied. Thus, in addition to comparing data
sets that evolved under identical conditions, we also
compared data sets that were simulated with different s
or a values. Thus, for s = 0.02 and 0.4, we compared
data sets characterized by heterogeneity of substitution
among sites vs. data sets with a homogeneous substitution rate (a = 0.06 vs. a = 200, and a = 0.8168 vs. a =
