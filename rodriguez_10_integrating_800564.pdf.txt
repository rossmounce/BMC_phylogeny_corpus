Integrating phylogeographic patterns of
microsatellite and mtDNA divergence to infer the
evolutionary history of chamois (genus Rupicapra)
Fernando Rodríguez1, Trinidad Pérez1, Sabine E Hammer2, Jesús Albornoz1, Ana Domínguez1*

Abstract
Background: The chamois, distributed over most of the medium to high altitude mountain ranges of southern
Eurasia, provides an excellent model for exploring the effects of historical and evolutionary events on
diversification. Populations have been grouped into two species, Rupicapra pyrenaica from southwestern Europe
and R. rupicapra from eastern Europe. However, a previous study of cytochrome b revealed that the two proposed
species were non-monophyletic. The reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships between animal species often
depends on the markers studied. To further elucidate the evolutionary history of chamois, we extended earlier
studies by analysing DNA sequences of four mitochondrial regions (ND1, 12S, tRNApro and Control Region) and
microsatellites (20 loci) to include all subspecies and cover its entire distribution range.
Results: We found discordant microsatellite (μsat) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA phylogenies. Mitochondrial
phylogenies form three clades, West, Central and East (mtW, mtC and mtE), at variance with taxonomic
classification. Our divergence age estimates indicate an initial separation into branches mtW-mtC and mtE 1.7
million years ago (mya), in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, quickly followed by the split of clades mtW and mtC.
Clade mtW contains haplotypes from the Iberian peninsula and the western Alps, Clade mtC includes haplotypes
from the Apennines and the Massif of Chartreuse and Clade mtE comprises populations to the east of the Alps.
Divergence among populations within these three major clades is recent (< 0.5 mya). New microsatellite multilocus
genotypes added to previously published data revealed differences between every pair of subspecies, forming
three well defined groups (μsatW, μsatC and μsatE) also with a strong geographic signature. Grouping does not
correspond with the mitochondrial lineages but is closer to morphology and taxonomic classification. Recent
drastic reductions in population size can be noted for the subspecies ornata as an extremely low diversity.
Conclusions: The phylogeographic patterns for mtDNA and microsatellites suggest an evolutionary history with
limited range contractions and expansions during the Quaternary period and reflect a major effect of the Alpine
barrier on west-east differentiation. The contrasting phylogenies for mtDNA and microsatellites indicate events of
hybridization among highly divergent lineages in the central area of distribution. Our study points to the
importance of reticulate evolution, with periods of isolation and reduction of population size followed by
expansions and hybridizations, in the diversification at the level of close species or subspecies.

Background
Any group of organisms has a single true pedigree that
extends back through time as an unbroken chain of parent-offspring genetic transmission but not all genes
trickle through this pedigree in identical fashion [1].

species often depend on the markers studied, as different genes might have different modes of transmission
and different histories [2-4]. In addition, hybridization
can result in discordant phylogenies between markers.
Increasing evidence points to a contribution of reticulate
evolution to the speciation process [5,6]. In this context,
information on the phylogenies of different markers for
closely related species and subspecies is important to
the study of the processes underlying speciation [7].

The chamois (Rupicapra spp.) provides an excellent
model for exploring the effect of historical and evolutionary events on diversification. It is distributed over
most of the medium to high altitude mountain ranges
of southern Eurasia (Figure 1). The Quaternary glacial
ages probably had a major effect on the phylogeography
and evolution of the genus Rupicapra, as it did on other
animals in Eurasia [8-11]. There are diverse opinions
concerning the phylogenetic relationships between fossil
and living forms of Rupicaprini. The Rupicaprini seem
to have originated in Asia during the Miocene period
[11]; the fossil genus Procamptoceras appeared in Europe in the Villafranchian period (more than 2 million
years ago [mya]) and together with Rupicapra is
believed to belong to a phyletic lineage that had already
separated from the ancestral Rupicaprini [12]. The sudden appearance of Rupicapra fossils in Europe during
the middle Pleistocene age has been interpreted as
resulting from immigration from the east during a cold
climatic phase [11]. At present, chamois populations are
classified into two species R. pyrenaica and R. rupicapra
[13] on the basis of morphological and behavioural
characters: Rupicapra pyrenaica (with the subspecies
parva, pyrenaica and ornata) from southwestern Europe
and R. rupicapra (with the subspecies cartusiana, rupicapra, tatrica, carpatica, balcanica, asiatica and caucasica) from northeastern Europe [14]. Analysis of genetic
variation in a limited number of subspecies for allozyme
loci [15], minisatellites [16], RFLPs of mitochondrial
DNA [17] and the major histocompatibility complex
[18,19] showed a considerably higher divergence
between populations of the two proposed species than
between populations within the same species. Microsatellite analysis of 8 of the 10 proposed subspecies

Page 2 of 19

showed a clear differentiation between every pair of
populations and clearly separated two groups corresponding to the two proposed species of chamois [20].
The geographic distribution of separated mtDNA clades
allows the study of historical demographic and dispersal
events and the differentiation between mtDNA
sequences can be used to date the separation among
phylogenetic groups. The study of a fragment of cytochrome b (cytb) of 349 bp revealed that the two proposed species were non-monophyletic [21]. Three cytb
lineages were identified: Clade West in the Iberian
peninsula and western Alps, Clade Central in the Apennines and the Massif of Chartreuse and Clade East in
populations to the east of the Alps. Clades West and
Central are represented in both species, while Clade
East is restricted to R. rupicapra. The divergence
between the main clades has been estimated around 1.53 mya [21-25] but this cannot be directly assumed to be
the divergence time between species. The study of
microsatellites [20] has shown a correlation between
genetic and geographic distance between populations,
denoting a genetic flow among contiguous populations.
To further elucidate the processes leading to the
diversification of the genus Rupicapra, we studied a larger sequence dataset including several mtDNA fragments and nuclear markers, which has been
recommended to increase the performance of phylogenetic studies [26,27]. Earlier work was extended by analyzing DNA sequences of four mitochondrial regions
[NADH Dehydrogenase subunit 1(ND1), 12S ribosomal
RNA gene (12S), tRNAproline (tRNApro) and the control region (CR), total 1356 bp] and microsatellites (20
loci) to include all subspecies of chamois and to cover
its entire distribution range. Here we include the

subspecies cartusiana and asiatica, both missing from
previous studies, as well as additional samples of ornata
and tatrica (previously only represented by 1 and 2 individuals respectively). Comparison of the geographic distribution of mitochondrial and nuclear markers allow us
to follow the pattern of hybridization between highly
differentiated lineages in the context of the climatic
oscillations of the Pleistocene age.

diversity, both haplotypic (95.07%) and nucleotidic
(2.80%). In particular, nucleotide diversity was very high
in the sample from Val di Susa in the western side of
the Alps. On the other hand, diversity was extremely
low for populations from the Massif of Chartreuse (R.
rupicapra cartusiana) and from the Apennines (R. pyrenaica ornata).
A simple Neighbor-Joining tree based on Jukes-Cantor
distances between individuals (Figure 2) revealed three
well supported major clades, although these do not concur with the taxonomy of chamois. The three clades,
hereinafter named Clade mtWest (mtW), Clade mtCentral (mtC) and Clade mtEast (mtE), show a strong geographic signal. Clade mtW is present in individuals from
the Iberian peninsula (R. pyrenaica) and the western
Alps (R. rupicapra), Clade mtC in individuals from the
Apennines (R. pyrenaica) and the Massif of Chartreuse
(R. rupicapra) and Clade mtE in all individuals of populations from the central Alps to the Caucasus. Thus, the
two species were mitochondrially non-monophyletic: R.
pyrenaica contains the clades mtW and mtC and R.
rupicapra the three mitochondrial clades. Networks
computed using the four mitochondrial fragments
(ND1, 12S, tRNApro and CR) separately (Figure 3)
showed identical topologies as the combined analyses

Results
Mitochondrial DNA phylogeography

We have amplified and sequenced fragments of ND1,
12S, tRNApro and CR from 152 individuals. These
sequences were concatenated with a fragment of cytb
obtained in a previous study [21]. The combined dataset
contains 1708 nucleotides (1646 nt, indels excluded),
742 of them corresponding to coding sequences. The
alignment resulted in 79 haplotypes defined by 219 variable sites of which 64 corresponded to coding regions.
The overall number of mutations was 223, of which 15
corresponded to non-synonymous substitutions in coding regions. Mitochondrial DNA diversity was high
(Table 1) with on average one distinct haplotype over
1.9 individuals (152/79). The Alpine chamois (R. rupicapra rupicapra) as a whole showed very high values of

within each clade are connected to haplotypes of the same
population or of a nearby population. However, the haplotypes of the western Alps are connected to haplotypes of
the Cantabrian Mounts and the Pyrenees but are quite differentiated from them. The haplotypes of Chartreuse
belong to Clade mtC and occupy a more central position
within the network than the haplotypes from the Apennines. Pairwise differences between populations in mean
number of substitutions per nucleotide (Table 2) are all
significant with the exception of the differences between
individuals from the central and the eastern Alps, rupicapra E versus caucasica and asiatica versus caucasica.
To investigate further the evolutionary history of Rupicapra, the 79 haplotypes of the combined dataset were
aligned with sequences of Capra hircus, Ovis aries and
Bos taurus and the phylogenetic relationships were
investigated using Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony, Neighbor-Joining or Bayesian approaches under
different models of nucleotide substitution. Following
the Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test (hLRTs), as
implemented in MODELTEST [28], the combined dataset of haplotypes with outgroups was found to fit a
HKY + I + G model. The six parameters (nucleotide frequencies A:0.3588, C:0.2540, G:0.1331, T:2540; Ts/Tv
ratio: 16.037; rate heterogeneity: 0.3464 and proportion
of invariants: 0.4791) given by MODELTEST were used
to obtain an ML tree with the program DNAML of the
PHYLYP package [29]. The number of different possible
evolutionary rates was set to five plus a class of invariant
sites. The same model of nucleotide substitution was
used for the construction of the Bayesian tree but the
parameters were obtained by the program Beast itself.
There were 196 parsimony-informative sites. Model-free
Parsimony Analysis performed with MEGA [30] led to
thirty equally parsimonious trees with a total length of
1150 steps. NJ analysis was performed by means of the
simple model of Jukes-Cantor.

The different methods of tree construction all led to
topologies with three main well supported branches
(Figure 4). In addition, Clade mtC divides into two well
supported external branches representing the chamois
from the subspecies R. p. ornata and R. r. cartusiana.
The other two major clades, mtW and mtE, do not
show consistent external nodes. Only an external node
including several Cantabrian haplotypes is formed
within Clade mtW and, similarly, only an external node
of haplotypes from the Carpathians forms in Clade mtE.
These groups must correspond to local lineage sorting
rather than to long phylogenetic divergence.
The relationships between the three major clades or
internal branches were found to vary depending on the
method used for tree construction. Under ML, the split
between Clades mtC and mtE is posterior to the split of
Clade mtW. The topology obtained with Bayesian, MP
and NJ methods (in Figure 4) was always poorly supported, suggesting that the divergence of these three
main clades most probably happened in a radiation
within a short period of time.
Using the divergence times of Bovidae, Caprinae and
Capra-Ovis as calibrations, following Hernandez-Fernandez and Vrba [31], the divergence of Clades W-C and E
was dated at 1.68 mya (95% confidence limits [CI]: 0.912.56), overlapping with confidence limits for the time of
divergence between Clades W and C, which was calculated to be 1.37 mya (95% CI: 0.75-2.09). The subsequent divergences within these three main clades are
considerably younger (< 0.5 mya), already in the middle
Pleistocene.
Microsatellite DNA phylogeography

The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 23 with
a mean of 9.20 (see Additional file 2). Observed heterozygosities were, in general, slightly lower than expected
(Table 3) and the difference was significant in the

subspecies carpatica and balcanica. Only one combination individual -locus failed to amplify, indicating that
null alleles do not occur at high frequency. The test with
Micro-Checker identified potential null alleles at frequencies higher than 0.2 in the subspecies carpatica (SRCRSP-13, SR-CRSP-14) and balcanica (SR-CRSP-8, SRCRSP-12, ETH225, INRA036). After the exclusion of the
loci with potential null alleles, the observed heterozygosity was still lower than expected (carpatica, P = 0.0023;
balcanica, P = 0.0061). Hence, the heterozygote deficit in
these subspecies can be attributed to the Wahlund effect
rather than to the presence of null alleles. The locus SRCRSP-14 is identified by Micro-Checker as having potential null alleles at a frequency of 0.24 in rupicapraW. The
fact that this population showed no general heterozygote
deficit suggests that deviation is probably due to the presence of null alleles. Despite this finding, the effect in
overall F-statistics and genetic distances would be limited
and hence the locus was retained for analysis. The subspecies tatrica showed a diversity of 33%, in the lowest
range of the values. The population of the Apennines
showed an extremely low diversity of 3%. Six out of 12
individuals were homozygous for the 20 loci and only 3
loci presented more than one allele.
A Neighbor-Joining tree of 179 individuals (116 of them
also included in the mitochondrial analysis) based on
allele-sharing distance (Figure 5) shows two main clades
corresponding to the Iberian chamois (Clade μsatW)
and the Eastern chamois (Clade μsatE) and a third one
(Clade μsatC) that groups the Apennine chamois, the
subspecies R. pyrenaica ornata. Like the mitochondrial
tree, the microsatellite-based phylogeny shows a strong

geographic signal but at the centre of the distribution of
Rupicapra the mitochondrial and the nuclear data are in
apparent conflict. All eight individuals of R. rupicapra
cartusiana formed with R. pyrenaica ornata the mitochondrial Clade mtC but group with alpine chamois
R. rupicapra rupicapra for microsatellite markers. In
contrast to mitochondrial data, the 18 individuals
sampled from the west Italian Alps group with the
nuclear Clade μsatE, while 16 of them belong to Clade
mtW (see Figure 2). The microsatellite tree shows the
clustering of individuals of the different subspecies even
though there is not a clear-cut between them.
Bayesian clustering of individuals with the software
Structure using the method of Evanno et al. [32] yields
a likely number of clusters of two. Nevertheless, inspection of the twenty replicate runs of Structure shows
inconsistencies among replicates, with Clade μsatC as
defined above clustered with μsatW in eight of the replicates and with μsatE in the remaining 12 replicates.
Clustering of individuals with K = 3 (Figure 6) is more
consistent among replicates and forms the same groups
of individuals as the microsatellite tree in 17 replicates.
In the other three, the grouping of the subspecies parva,
pyrenaica and ornata varies: in two of them pyrenaica
and ornata group together and parva forms a different
group but in one replicate parva and ornata group
together. Higher orders of structure (K = 7-9) yield clusters that tend to group individuals of the same or neighbour populations but the clusters present low
consistency among replicates.
Every pairwise comparison of genetic differentiation
between populations (excluding the comparisons with
asiatica represented only by one individual) differs significantly from zero (Table 2). A UPGMA consensus
tree was generated from 1000 bootstrap replicates based
on Nei’s standard genetic distance. The population tree
topology was represented over the geographic distribution of the genus (Figure 7) to highlight the geographic
signature on the microsatellite variation.

Discussion
Our phylogenetic analysis based on either mitochondrial
or nuclear DNA variation gives results that are to a certain some extent discordant, even though both markers
show a strong east/west phylogeographic signal that
must be related to the distribution of lineages in space
and time with recurrent periods of isolation and contact
in contiguous areas of the species’ range. The discordance between mitochondrial phylogeny and the taxonomic classification, based mostly on morphological
characters, results in non-monophyly. The two species
of Rupicapra, R. pyrenaica and R. rupicapra, are not
reciprocally monophyletic for mtDNA; Clades mtW and
mtC are represented in both, while Clade mtE is

restricted to R. rupicapra. It is interesting that R. rupicapra cartusiana groups with R. pyrenaica ornata
regarding the mtDNA, as both form the Clade mtC, but
clusters with its conspecific group R. rupicapra on the
basis of microsatellite variation. No signs of recent
admixture can be noted in the individual nuclear genotypes. The population from the west Italian Alps
(R. r. rupicapra W) is non-monophyletic with haplotypes
belonging either to the Clade mtE (2 individuals) or to
the Clade mtW (16 individuals). These phylogenetic
relationships can be interpreted either as a consequence
of old hybridization among differentiated lineages [21]
or as a result of much more recent human-mediated
translocations [25]. The different expectations of the
two hypotheses are as follows: if translocation and
hybridization were recent, within the last 150 years as
suggested (24 generations assuming a generation time of
6.24 years following Gaillard [33]), a signature of the
reintroduction should be visible both at the levels of
nuclear and mitochondrial variation. As evident from
the Structure analysis, the 16 individual alpine specimens of the Clade mtW belong to the nuclear Clade
μsatE and there are no signs of admixture or recent
hybridization. In addition, close inspection of the subsample of haplotypes of Clade mtW from alpine R. r.
rupicapra individuals argues against a recent reintroduction because: 1) the haplotypic and nucleotidic
diversities (0.883 and 0.00786) are high and similar to
the values found, for example, in the Pyrenean chamois; 2) none of the seven haplotypes present in this
subsample were recovered from the Pyrenees. Our
Pyrenean sample is limited in number and the samples
come only from two sampling locations (see Figure 1)
but it is nevertheless remarkable that locations on
both sides of the Pyrenees share haplotypes with each
other but not with the sample from the Alps; 3) the
genetic distance, in mean number of substitutions per
nucleotide (following Jukes-Cantor), between the subsample of Clade mtW from the Alps and either the
Cantabrian or the Pyrenean chamois (1.38 and 0.99) is
comparable to the distance among the Cantabrian and
Pyrenean populations themselves (0.65) and hence
denotes a similar time of divergence. Thus we conclude that the haplotypes from Clade mtW present in
the alpine R. r. rupicapra population result from
ancient hybridization.
Overall, phylogeographic analysis of mtDNA and
μsatDNA allows the definition of three groups of chamois that separate in an east-west pattern. The two
types of markers gave incongruent results for individuals
from the regions of contact between lineages, the Massif
of Chartreuse and the western Alps. Hence, our results
provide strong evidence for the effect of old migrations

and hybridization between highly differentiated lineages
on the current composition of populations in the central
area of the distribution of chamois.
Taxonomic implications

The currently accepted taxonomy of chamois recognizes
two species: R. pyrenaica, which include chamois from
the Iberian peninsula together with the chamois from
the Appenines; and R. rupicapra, which includes all the
other populations [13]. However, the taxonomy of the
genus has been subject to continuous revisions during
the twentieth century. In 1914, Camerano [34] distinguished the species R. ornata on the basis of skull and
horn morphometrics. Subsequently Couturier and Dolan
considered the ten populations of chamois as a single
species [35], [40] but later work based on skull evaluations [36], electrophoretic data [15] and different coat
pattern as well as several courtship behaviour patterns
[37] suggested that treatment as two species is warranted. More recently, Crestanello et al. [25] suggested
that R. pyrenaica ornata be re-elevated to species rank
in accordance with the high divergence between the
mtC Clade and the other two. However, these authors
did not take into account that R. rupicapra cartusiana
also belongs to the Clade mtC.
The mitochondrial DNA data provide information
about phylogeny that is frequently used to diagnose species using the phylogenetic species concept (PSC). Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs), essentially equivalent
to species under the PSC [38], have been defined as
populations of individuals reciprocally monophyletic for
mtDNA alleles and differing significantly in the frequency of alleles at nuclear loci [39]. According to this
criterion, mitochondrial phylogeny implies that a single
species of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) should be
recognized, as by Couturier [35] and Dolan [40]. However, experiments on species delimitation that are based
on markers from a single uniparentally inherited genome must be treated with caution, given that such markers are preferentially introgressed across species
boundaries [4,41]. Multilocus assignment methods have
been proposed to have considerably more power [4].
The microsatellite analysis clearly separates three
groups: two corresponding to the two recognized species
plus a third group for individuals from the Apennines,
that are closer to the Iberian chamois than to the other
populations. This finding can be related to the classification proposed by Camerano [34], who accorded the rank
of species to the population from the Apennines (R. pyrenaica ornata). Morphological differentiation between
ornata and pyrenaica has also been shown by Scala and
Lovari [42], even though differences between the Iberian
and Apennine group and all other Rupicapra rupicapra

Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/222

spp. are much greater [36]. Thus, microsatellite differentiation seems to be more closely related to morphological variation than does work with mtDNA.
Mitochondrial phylogenies are frequently discordant
with taxonomy, and hence with morphological differentiation [43-47]. In the case of chamois, we have shown
that the introgression of mtDNA into the Eastern chamois corresponds to ancient hybridizations. Our conclusion is consistent with the observation of intermediate
phenotypes between R. rupicapra and R. pyrenaica in R.
r. cartusiana [36], implying that the consequences of
hybridization were not limited to introgression of
mtDNA from local animals to the invading species.
From the perspective of the biological species concept,
only one species should be considered if there is widespread hybridization among the nominal species.
Further information on the extent of past hybridization
in the central area of the distribution is therefore
required to define the taxonomy of Rupicapra.
Overall, the genus Rupicapra exhibits levels of diversity comparable to those found in other genera of wild
Artiodactyla in Europe [48-52]. Microsatellite markers
show a differentiation among populations of the ten
currently recognized subspecies, though differences are
not always clear-cut. Most populations of chamois
show intermediate levels of diversity either for microsatellites or for mtDNA. Even though the limited number and non-random distribution of samples precludes
a detailed comparison of intra-population variability,
some of the data are remarkable. The subspecies rupicapra, represented by many thousands of individuals,
has very high levels of diversity, both for mitochondrial
and for microsatellite markers. Previous studies have
documented the existence of genetic fragmentation at
this geographic scale [25,53]. The high level of diversity at the mtDNA level in the sample from the western Alps can be attributed to ancient hybridization of
very different lineages, as we have discussed. The subspecies ornata and cartusiana, which were classified as
vulnerable and endangered by the Caprinae Specialist
Group [54], show very low diversities at the level of
mitochondrial DNA: 0.01% and 0.04%, respectively.
These low levels of mitochondrial diversity can be
related to reduced female population sizes in the past
due to geographic isolation. With regard to diversity
for microsatellites, the subspecies cartusiana shows a
moderate level of 42%, similar to other subspecies,
while the subspecies ornata presents the extremely low
value of 3%. Six out of 12 individuals are homozygous
for the 20 loci and only three loci present more than
one allele. This level of diversity is lower than the lowest values reported for several bottlenecked mammalian populations: H e = 0.43 for a bighorn sheep
population founded from 12 individuals (Forbes 1995),

Page 12 of 19

He = 0.25 for the brown bear subpopulation isolated in
the east Cantabrian mountains [55], H e = 0.13 for a
Mexican grey wolf population founded with fewer than
ten individuals [56] or H e = 0.13 for the alpine Ibex
population of the Alpi Marittime-Mercantour, which
was reintroduced between 1920 and 1933 with an
effective number of founders possibly lower than ten
animals [57]. The diversity of the subspecies ornata for
microsatellites is possibly the lowest value reported in
the literature for a population of non-selfing diploid
organisms. This is a reflection of the recent past of the
Apennines population, with two extreme bottlenecks
in the last century. The subspecies ornata nearly
became extinct early in the 20 th century and in the
late 1940s [37] and recovered to 800 animals by 2003
[58].
Inferences on the evolutionary history of chamois

The distribution of variation, both of mtDNA and of
microsatellites, shows a clear geographic signature with
a west-east differentiation. Present day mtDNA clades
show an east-west distribution along medium to highaltitude mountain ranges of southern Europe and the
near east: each clade of mtDNA forms a patch occupying a delimited geographic area, even though Clade mtC
is split into two with both in the central area of distribution. For microsatellites, genetic and geographic distances have been shown to correlate [20], consistent
with gene flow among populations. For both types of
markers the barrier of the Alps is a factor that disrupts
the distribution of genetic variation. The somewhat contrasting pictures offered by the two types of markers can
be related to their different modes of evolution. Microsatellite markers narrate the phylogenetic history of tens
of thousands of years while mitochondrial markers shed
light on the deeper phylogenetic history [59]. In addition, both markers, especially mtDNA, provide information about phylogeographic events such as migration
and hybridization of populations. The largely concordant
geographic distribution of both old and new genetic variation in chamois implies that differentiation occurred
without major migrations since the establishment
in Europe of the three extant mitochondrial lineages
(Figure 8).
The earliest Rupicapra fossils stem from the middle
Pleistocene and have been found in France, together with
Hemitragus and Ovis, and a few remains from the Rissian
age have been found in the Pyrenees, the Italian Alps, the
Apennines and Hungary [11]. Masini and Lovari [11] have
suggested that the chamois, or its direct ancestor, may
have reached the European region as a late immigrant during the Early or Middle Pleistocene, probably from southwest Asia. The phylogenetic analysis of 1708 nucleotides,
including five mitochondrial genes, concurs with previous

studies [21,25]. It shows an initial split of the pyrenaica
(mtW-mtC) and rupicapra (mtE) lineages 1.7 mya, based
on the molecular clock. Clade mtC started to diverge from
mtW very soon after, 1.4 mya. The divergence time estimates between the three lineages have overlapping confidence intervals and place the radiation back to the PlioPleistocene before the beginning of the strong climatic

oscillations of the Quaternary. The contrast between this
dating and that obtained from microsatellites [20] can be
attributed to the well known effect of homoplasy of microsatellites, which leads to underestimation of separation
times for long diverging populations [60]. Thus, molecular
mitochondrial data place the age of modern chamois
lineages before their first occurrence in the fossil record. In

Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/222

addition, an older mitochondrial lineage fossilized in the
nucleus as a pseudogene has been identified in both species currently recognized [24]. Its translocation to the
nucleus was close to the radiation of present day clades,
suggesting the existence of older chamois precursors in
Europe of a lineage that did not survive until the present.
The geographic patterns of mtDNA and microsatellite
variation suggest that the three major mitochondrial
clades differentiated “in situ” with moderate migrations
after their initial radiation. In the middle Pleistocene,
chamois occurred in the geographic area they currently
occupy [11]. There have probably been multiple phases
of isolation and hybridization between contiguous populations, most likely caused by expansions to lower altitudes during Pleistocene glacial periods and
contractions to high altitudes during interglacial periods.
The presence of chamois at high altitudes in the Swiss
Alps during the Riss-Würm interglacial period and its
wider and continuous distribution on low altitude sites
during the Würm has been documented [11]. The ice
sheets in the Alps and the Pyrenees during glacial maxima must have constituted barriers that greatly limited
contacts between populations already showing a pattern
of isolation by distance. Clade West was presumably isolated to the west of the Pyrenees, in the Iberian peninsula; Clade Central must correspond to the isolation of
chamois, most probably between the Pyrenees and the
Alps; and Clade East was probably isolated to the east
of the Alps during the glacial maxima and presumably
extended its distribution during interglacial periods. It is
highly likely that Clade West recolonized the western
Alps and there encountered the lineage from the east
that occupied most of the Alps. The populations constituting Clade mtC were probably split by the expansion
of the two main clades into the central region. This
interpretation is consistent with the paleontological evidence for the presence of R. rupicapra spp. in Holocene
deposits of the northern Apennines [11]. The subspecies
cartusiana, which lives in the isolated mountain system
of Chartreuse on the western edge of the French Alps,
carries mitochondria from Clade mtC, while nuclear
markers place it in the eastern group (μsatE), denoting
hybridization. This observation is in accordance with
the hypothesis of Lovari and Scala [36], who argue that
hybridization might explain why R. r. cartusiana bears
some phenotypes that are intermediate between R. rupicapra and R. pyrenaica. Parallel data were observed with
regard to the population from Val di Susa in the western Alps, where most individuals carry the mitochondrial Clade mtW together with nuclear markers of the
Clade μsatE, denoting hybridization among lineages in
the contact zone. Finally, the warm climate of the Holocene definitively isolated the populations, which were
restricted to the tops of the different mountain ranges.

Page 14 of 19

Our data concur with other studies on comparative
phylogeography in Europe [9,10] in explaining the divergence between lineages in the context of divergence
among three main areas and of the effect of the Alpine
barrier in population differentiation. The historical
events of population range contractions and expansions
due to climatic oscillations may have eliminated haplotypes present in glacial areas and led to hybridizations
between other lineages. Our findings are consistent with
a scenario of diversification of the genus Rupicapra
without major migrations since the time of radiation of
present-day clades but involving periodic isolation of
populations and subsequent range overlap, most probably triggered by climatic changes, and hybridization.

Conclusions
The mitochondrial phylogeny shows three main lineages
that originated in a close period at the Early Pleistocene.
There is a first split of the Clades mtW-mtC from mtE
(dated 1.7 mya), soon followed (1.4 mya) by the split of
the left branch into Clades mtC and mtW. The two
nominal species of chamois R. pyrenaica and R. rupicapra are not monophyletic for mtDNA. Microsatellite
genotypes form three well defined groups that do not
exactly match the mitochondrial lineages but are closer
to morphology and taxonomic classification. Based on
all these findings, Rupicapra populations are subdivided
into three main groups: the Iberian populations, the
Apennine population and northeastern populations. The
geographic signature in the distribution of variability
suggests that differentiation occurred without major
migrations. The phylogeographic patterns suggest an
evolutionary history with range contractions and expansions related to climatic oscillations during the Quaternary period and reflect a major effect of the Alpine
barrier on west-east differentiation. The contrasting phylogenies for mtDNA and microsatellites for populations
of Chartreuse and the western Alps indicate events of
range overlap and hybridization among highly divergent
lineages in the central area of the distribution. In addition, the extremely reduced variability of some subspecies shows the potential importance of lineage sorting in
the composition of present-day populations.
Our study points to the importance of reticulate evolution, with periods of isolation and reduction of population size followed by expansion and hybridization, in
the diversification of close species.
Methods
Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites - Sampling and
DNA Extraction

Samples of the 10 recognized subspecies of chamois
were collected from 1992 until the present, covering the
distribution range of the genus Rupicapra (see Figure 1).

Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/222

A total of 215 samples were analyzed either for microsatellites and mtDNA (116 samples) or for just one type of
marker (63 samples for microsatellites only and 36 samples only for mitochondrial markers) (see Additional file
3). From the 179 samples analyzed for microsatellites,
142 had been previously typed [20]. The 37 new samples
included individuals from populations lacking (cartusiana and asiatica) or poorly represented (ornata, tatrica,
balcanica and caucasica) in the previous study. For
large populations, where hunting is allowed, samples
were either of muscle or skin preserved in 96% ethanol
by gamekeepers, or teeth from skulls sent to taxidermists. For protected populations, samples were obtained
from animals found dead; tissues, as well as their conservation method, were diverse (hair, bone, salted skin
and muscle in ethanol) and were sent by biologists.
Due to the different origin and type of the material
included in this study, different methods of DNA isolation were used. DNA from bones or teeth was extracted
by a method modified from Catanneo et al. [61] as
described [20]. For soft tissue samples, DNA was
extracted either with the phenol/chloroform method
[62] using Chelex, following Estoup et al. [63] or using
the ‘DNeasy Tissue kit’ (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Finally, 56 of the 215 samples were collected and the
DNA extracted in the laboratory of Vienna (Austria) following the protocol described in the Genetic Analysis
Manual (LI-COR, Inc. 1999). The lysed sample was subjected to a standard phenol/chloroform extraction and
DNA precipitation procedure [62]. DNA extracted in
Vienna was sent to Oviedo (Spain) for analysis.
Mitochondrial DNA Sequencing Analysis

Four mitochondrial sequences corresponding to the tRNApro gene, parts of NADH-1 (ND1), 12S rRNA (12S) genes
and the Control Region (CR) were sequenced. A fragment
between 488 bp and 547 bp, including 6 bp to the right of
the tRNA-thr that was discarded, the tRNA-pro (66 bp) and
the left hypervariable region (HVR-I) (416-475 bp) of the CR,
was amplified with the primers CRa F (5′-AGGAGAACAACTAACCTCCC-3′) and CR R (5GGTTTCACGCGGCATGG′-3′) designed from the sequences of R. rupicapra in
the GenBank (AM279274 and AM279275). Primers for
amplification of ND1 were designed from the sequences of
R. pyrenaica (GenBank DQ236338) and R. rupicapra (GenBank DQ236339) [64]. A fragment of 444 bp, including 51
bp of the ARNt-leu, was generated with the primers ND1F
(5′-GTGGCAGAGCCCGGTAATTG- 3′) and ND1R (5′TGTGCTACTGCTCGTAAGGC-3′). For the 12S rRNA
gene, the primers 12SbF (5′-ACAAAATTATTCGCCAGAGTACT-3′) and 12SR (5′-TCCAGTATGCTTACCTTGTTACG′-3′) were designed from the sequence of

Page 15 of 19

R. rupicapra (GenBank AM158314) and produced a fragment of 471 bp. PCRs conditions for all amplifications were
identical. Reactions were performed in a final volume of 20
μl containing 2 μl (≈ 40-70 ng) DNA, 0.5 mM of each primer, 1× PCR Buffer, 200 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl
2 and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplification was carried out in PE GeneAmp PCR
9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
with an initial step of 3 min at 94°C, 30-35 cycles of 15 s at
94°C, 30 s at 62°C and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 10 min at
72°C. PCR products were electrophoresed along with size
standards in 2% agarose gel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA and
visualized by UV. The PCR-amplified products were purified
with the Exo-SAP-IT kit (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH)
and sequencing reactions performed with the previous
designed primers and the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing products
were purified with isopropanol precipitation and sequenced
in an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The
raw sequence data were analyzed using the ABI Prism DNA
Sequencer Analysis software v3.4.1.
Mitochondrial DNA - Phylogenetic Reconstruction

The mitochondrial sequences were aligned using the
multiple alignment program of BioEdit [65] and manually checked and edited. All generated haplotypes of
the four studied fragments were submitted to NCBI
GenBank (accession numbers GU951809-GU951916,
see Additional file 1). In addition, the four datasets
plus a fragment of cytb previously sequenced in the
same individuals (accession numbers EU836150EU836161 and EU836163-EU836168, see Additional
file 1)[21] were combined to produce a final alignment
of 1708 nucleotides (1646 nt, indels excluded).
Sequences were analyzed separately for the four data
sets and for the combined dataset with the MEGA4
software package [30] and DnaSP 4.0 [66]. A Neighbor-Joining tree based on the number of substitutions
per site under the Jukes-Cantor model was constructed
from the combined sequences of the 152 Rupicapra
individuals. All positions containing gaps were eliminated (complete deletion option in MEGA). Haplotype
diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) were estimated for each subspecies. The evolutionary genetic
distance between pairs of subspecies was quantified
with MEGA as the net average number of substitutions
per site. Analyses were conducted using the Jukes-Cantor model of nucleotide substitution and the Standard
Errors obtained by a bootstrap procedure (1000 replicates). Significance of these inter-group distances was
tested with a Z-test performed with EXCEL and applying the Bonferroni correction [67].

The evolutionary relationships between the haplotypes,
of the four markers separately or the combined sequence,
were analyzed by a Median-Joining network [68] constructed with NETWORK 4.2 (Fluxus Technology Ltd.).
This method differs from traditional ones by allowing
extant haplotypes to occupy internal nodes. The parameter
ε was set to zero (default) to obtain a sparse spanning network. For the CR and the combined datasets the MedianJoinig network was enhanced by first running the
Reduced-Median network (with the Reduction Threshold
Parameter r set to the default value of 2) to simplify the
outcome. Phylogenetic relationships were further analyzed
for the dataset of haplotypes of the combined sequence
aligned with sequences of Capra hircus (AF533441), Ovis
aries (NC_001941) and Bos taurus (NC_001567) as outgroups. Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Maximum Parsimony
(MP), Maximum-Likelihood (ML) or Bayesian approaches
were used under different models of nucleotide substitution. We elected not to use sophisticated models of
nucleotide substitution for analyzing phylogenies because
differences in genetic estimates of distances are low when
closely related sequences are studied. In addition, statistical prediction based on a model with many parameters is
subject to larger error variance [69]. A Neighbor-Joining
(NJ) tree of haplotypes based on Jukes-Cantor distance
was constructed with MEGA. The reliability of the nodes
was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates [70]. The topology of the tree was further investigated by model free
Maximum Parsimony (MP) as implemented in MEGA.
The MP tree was obtained using the Close-NeighborInterchange algorithm with search level 3 in which the
initial trees were obtained with the random addition of
sequences (10 replicates). The MP consensus tree was
inferred from 1000 bootstrap replicates with MEGA. The
Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree was obtained using the
DNAML program within the PHYLIP package [29], after
determining the optimal substitution model from the hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test (hLRTs) implemented in
MODELTEST 3.7 [28]. To assess the reliability of the
nodes, 1000 bootstrap replicates were obtained with the
program SEQBOOT within the PHYLIP [29] and analysed
with the program DNAML under the multiple dataset
option. The consensus tree and the bootstrap support
were obtained with TreeAnnotator of the software package BEAST [71].
Bayesian analysis was conducted using the Monte Carlo
Markov chains (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST
[71]. A relaxed lognormal model of lineage variation and a
coalescent prior with constant size was assumed given that
the alignments contain multiple intraspecific sequences
[72]. The model of nucleotide substitution was HKI + G +
I with the empirical nucleotide sequences and a gamma
distribution of site heterogeneity with 5 categories of

Page 16 of 19

substitution rates plus invariant sites as priors. Two replicates were run for 25 million generations with tree and
parameter sampling every 1,000 generations. A burn-in of
10% was used and the convergence of all parameters
assessed using the software TRACER (within the BEAST
package). Subsequently, the sampling distributions of two
independent replicates were combined using the software
LogCombiner and the resulting samples summarized
using the software TreeAnnotator and visualized with FigTree [73]. Divergence times were estimated with BEAST,
which employs a relaxed molecular clock approach. As
calibration we used the divergence times of Bovidae (mean
25.8 mya, standard deviation [SD] 0.6 mya), Caprinae
(mean 14.1 mya, SD 1.1) and Capra-Ovis (11.5 mya, SD
0.9) following Hernández-Fernández and Vrba [31] as a
normal distribution prior. We placed monophyly constrains on the group Caprinae and on the group
Rupicapra.
Microsatellite Markers and Multiplex PCR

The twenty polymorphic microsatellite loci described
previously [20,74] were analyzed. The amplification conditions were as described but fluorescent labelled primers
were used and several markers were co-amplified and/or
co-loaded in the same well for analysis. Five multiplex
reactions were developed to amplify 12 of the loci (ETH10 + ETH225; INRA005 + INRA023; SR-CRSP-6 + SRCRSP-8; SR-CRSP-1 + SR-CRSP-3 + SR-CRSP-14; SRCRSP-9 + SR-CRSP-12 + SR-CRSP-15). The remaining 8
loci (INRA003; INRA011; INRA036; INRA063; SRCRSP-4; SR-CRSP-5; SR-CRSP-11; SR-CRSP-13) were
amplified independently. Amplification was carried out
using the PE GeneAmp PCR 9700 (Applied Biosystems).
PCR products were checked in a 2% agarose gel and the
product diluted up to 100-fold depending on the signal
intensity. One microlitre of the dilution was added to a
12 ml mix of formamide and ROX 400HD (12:0.2) and
loaded on an automatic sequencer ABI310 (Applied Biosystems). Several PCR reactions were co-loaded for analysis: (INRA036 + [ETH10 + ETH225], INRA003 +
[INRA005 + INRA23], INRA11 + INRA63) and the
remaining seven PCR reactions were loaded independently. To obtain the complete profile of each individual
sample 13 PCR reactions and 10 runs were needed.
Microsatellite patterns were examined both visually and
using GENESCAN ANALYSIS 3.1 and GENOTYPER 2.5
software (Applied Biosystems).
Microsatellites - Statistical Analyses

Multilocus individual genotypes were arranged in a
matrix of 20 loci per 179 individuals (142 typed in a
previous study and 37 individuals added in this study).
Multilocus genotypes were complete for all but the only

Rodríguez et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:222
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/222

individual from the subspecies asiatica, for which the
locus SR-CRSP-4 could not be amplified.
Descriptive statistics analysis was performed with
GENEPOP [75,76] and MSA [77]. In each population,
every locus was tested for departure from Hardy-Weinberg (HW) by the “exact HW test” [76]. The algorithm
used to estimate the exact P-value was a Markov-chain
method with the default values recommended by the
authors. Global tests across loci for each population
were constructed using Fisher’s method. The Bonferroni
procedure was applied to correct the significance level
for multiple comparisons [67].
Genotyping errors and null alleles were evaluated with
Micro-Checker [78] for each population. This method,
along with all other methods for detecting null alleles,
assumes that deviations from HW do not result from
other causes, such as the Wahlund effect. We estimated
the frequency of potential null alleles with MicroChecker following the method of Brookfield, indicated
when failures in the amplification of just a single locus
(which could signify a null homozygote) are not
observed. Frequencies of null alleles lower than 0.2 are
not expected to cause significant problems in analyses
[79]; thus we only considered loci exceeding this value
to be potentially problematic.
The allele-sharing distance between every pair of individuals [80] was calculated using MSA [77] and a
Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed from the resulting distance matrix using the program NEIGHBOR of
the PHYLIP package [29]. The tree was rooted in the
midpoint. Population structure was detected with the
software STRUCTURE 2.1 [81] (without prior population information), which uses a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to define the most likely
genetic clusters on the basis of multilocus genotype
data. We used different values of K, from one to ten,
and ran STRUCTURE 20 times for 100,000 steps after a
burn-in period of 50,000 steps. The correct value of K
was estimated following Evanno [32] and by visual
inspection of the replicates. Population differentiation
was investigated with F ST [76] using MSA and significance was tested by 10,000 bootstraps and applying the
Bonferroni procedure. Several studies have tested the
performance of different genetic distance measures in
resolving the evolutionary relations of closely related
populations or species from microsatellite data [82,83].
The results have shown that Nei′s standard distance, Ds
[84] performs well. We calculated Ds with the software
MSA [77]. Bootstrapping over loci for Ds was achieved
with MSA. These multiple data sets (1000 replicates)
were used to construct UPGMA trees with the NEIGHBOR program from PHYLIP 3.5c [29]. The 50% majority-rule consensus tree was generated with the

CONSENSE program in PHYLIP 3.5c. Tree diagrams
were obtained with FigTree [73].
