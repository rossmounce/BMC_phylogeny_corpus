Abstract
Background: The preservation of fish egg quality after ovulation-control protocols is a major
issue for the development of specific biotechnological processes (e.g. nuclear transfer). Depending
on the species, it is often necessary to control the timing of ovulation or induce the ovulatory
process. The hormonal or photoperiodic control of ovulation can induce specific egg quality defects
that have been thoroughly studied. In contrast, the impact on the egg transcriptome as a result of
these manipulations has received far less attention. Furthermore, the relationship between the
mRNA abundance of maternally-inherited mRNAs and the developmental potential of the egg has
never benefited from genome-wide studies. Thus, the present study aimed at studying the rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) egg transcriptome after natural or controlled ovulation using 9152cDNA microarrays.
Results: The analysis of egg transcriptome after natural or controlled ovulation led to the
identification of 26 genes. The expression patterns of 17 of those genes were monitored by realtime PCR. We observed that the control of ovulation by both hormonal induction and photoperiod
manipulation induced significant changes in the egg mRNA abundance of specific genes. A dramatic
increase of Apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1) and tyrosine protein kinase HCK was observed in the
eggs when a hormonal induction of ovulation was performed. In addition, both microarray and realtime PCR analyses showed that prohibitin 2 (PHB2) egg mRNA abundance was negatively
correlated with developmental success.
Conclusion: First, we showed, for the first time in fish, that the control of ovulation using either
a hormonal induction or a manipulated photoperiod can induce differences in the egg mRNA
abundance of specific genes. While the impact of these modifications on subsequent embryonic
development is unknown, our observations clearly show that the egg transcriptome is affected by
an artificial induction of ovulation.
Second, we showed that the egg mRNA abundance of prohibitin 2 was reflective of the
developmental potential of the egg.
Finally, the identity and ontology of identified genes provided significant hints that could result in a
better understanding of the mechanisms associated with each type of ovulation control (i.e.
hormonal, photoperiodic), and in the identification of conserved mechanisms triggering the loss of
egg developmental potential.

Background
Fish egg quality can be defined as the ability of the egg to
be fertilized and subsequently develop into a normal
embryo. The egg's potential to produce a viable and normal embryo can be affected by many environmental and
biological factors acting at various steps of the oogenetic
process (see [1,2] for review). The determinism of egg
quality has also been shown to be under the influence of
genetic factors [3-5]. While the effects of many experimental factors have been studied, the mechanisms by which
they trigger egg quality losses are far less documented.
Yolk composition as a result of a specific diet has been
intensively studied in several fish species in relationship
with egg developmental capacities [6-8]. Hormones of
maternal origin supplied to the embryo by the egg also
have a significant effect on embryonic development as
shown by several studies [9]. In contrast, the putative role
of non-yolky cytoplasmic components accumulated during oogenesis, such as structural and regulatory proteins,
cortical alveoli content and messenger RNAs (mRNAs),
has received far less attention [1]. Nevertheless, maternal
mRNAs that accumulate in the oocyte during oogenesis
are essential for early embryonic development [10,11].
Like in other animals, some maternal mRNAs are
involved in embryonic germ cells formation in fish [12],
but other oocyte mRNAs, such as those involved in
growth regulation, could be necessary to ensure a normal
early development [13]. Thus, in bovine two-cell
embryos, a relationship between embryonic developmental competence, assessed in terms of time of first cleavage,
and the expression of IGF1 mRNA was reported [14]. In
addition, other studies showed a relationship between
variation of maternal RNA polyadenylation levels and
developmental competence of mammalian oocytes, thus
pointing out a relationship between maternal mRNA stability and embryonic developmental capacities [15]. In
fish, the possibility that specific oocyte mRNAs might be
affected when egg quality is experimentally decreased has
been seriously suggested by a previous work dealing with
the effect of egg post-ovulatory ageing on the mRNA levels
of many genes (~40) in rainbow trout eggs [16].
In fish, it is often useful or necessary to control the timing
of spawning or induce the ovulatory process. These techniques are used for biotechnical, experimental or economical reasons to obtain out of season egg production
and/or synchronous egg production within a group of
females or, for some species, to obtain eggs from captive
fish. The effects of these manipulations on fish egg quality
have been thoroughly studied [1,17]. However, the
impact on egg transcriptome as a result of these manipulations has received far less attention despite recent efforts
to study the ovarian or follicular transcriptome during
oogenesis [18-20]. In the present study, we analyzed the
transcriptome of unfertilized rainbow trout (Oncorhyn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/55

chus mykiss) eggs after natural or controlled ovulation.
Two different protocols of controlled ovulation that are
widely used in laboratories and fish farms were carried
out: (i) a hormonal induction of ovulation using intraperitoneal GnRH-analog injection, and (ii) a specific photoperiod regime designed to advance the spawning
period. In addition, a third group was not subjected to any
specific manipulation to allow egg collection after natural
spontaneous ovulation. For each individual female, egg
samples were collected and either subjected to a microarray analysis or transferred in an experimental hatchery
after fertilization for monitoring developmental success
(e.g. embryonic survival, malformations). Thus, the
present study aimed at (i) analyzing the effect of ovulation
control processes on egg transcriptome and (ii) analyzing
possible links between egg transcriptome and egg developmental potential.

Results
Egg quality
Both hormonal induction and photoperiodic manipulation of ovulation had a negative impact on egg quality.
The percentage of normal (i.e. without morphological
abnormalities) alevins monitored at yolk-sac resorption
(YSR) was used to characterize the egg quality of each
individual female. The higher percentage of normal
alevins at YSR, 84 ± 5%, was observed after natural (N)
ovulation (Figure 1). In contrast, significantly lower percentages were observed after hormonal induction (HI) of
ovulation (65 ± 9%) or photoperiodic manipulation
(PM) of ovulation (37 ± 16%) (Figure 1).
Transcriptomic analysis
After signal processing, 8423 clones out of 9152 were kept
for further analysis. SAM analysis was performed using the
expression data of those 8423 clones. Twenty six genes
exhibiting a differential mRNA abundance among at least
2 of the 3 experimental groups were identified (Table 1,
Figure 2) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 3.4%. The
ontologies of those genes are presented in Table 2. Thirty
one genes putatively linked to egg quality were identified
(Table 3, Figure 3) with a FDR of 30%. The ontologies of
those genes are presented in Table 4.
Real-time PCR analysis
From the 57 (26+31) genes identified in the transcriptomic analysis, 32 were ultimately kept for real-time PCR
analysis (Table 5). Real-time PCR data corresponding to
the remaining 25 was not used in the analysis because of
methodological reasons (e.g. low expression, poor PCR
efficiency, double amplification).

A similar expression pattern was observed for clone #
1RT68D18_D_B09 that exhibited sequence similarity
with mouse Hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK, Table 1). The
deduced partial amino acid sequence generated from the
corresponding UniGene cluster exhibited 40% and 38%
identity with mouse and human HCK proteins respectively.

Genes exhibiting a differential egg mRNA abundance among
experimental groups
Among the 26 genes exhibiting a differential mRNA abundance between experimental groups, 17 were studied by
real-time PCR. Among those 17 genes, 7 were found to be
differentially expressed in the real-time PCR study (Figure
4). The identity of those 7 genes is presented below. Only
the informative alignments obtained using the full rainbow trout coding sequence (CDS) or a substantial part of
the CDS are presented (Figures 3, 4). For clarity reasons,
the official human protein symbol was used in the text.

Clone # 1RT65F10_D_C05 exhibited significant sequence
similarity with mouse Apolipoprotein C-I precursor
(APOC1, Table 1) and was significantly more abundant in
eggs of the HI group than in eggs of the N group while
intermediate levels were observed in eggs of the PM
group. The mRNA abundance in the HI group was 13
times higher than in the N group while it was 2 times
higher than in the PM group (Figure 4). After performing
a Blast search in the GenBank database, the complete rainbow trout amino acid sequence deduced from the EST
sequence exhibited 54% sequence identity at the amino
acid level with the zebrafish (Danio rerio) cognate protein
(Figure 5A). A sequence identity of 33 and 26% was
observed with mouse and human proteins respectively
(Figure 5A). The number of amino acids deduced from the
trout EST is consistent with the number of amino acids
present in mammalian and zebrafish sequences.

Clone tcbk0023.o.24 exhibited sequence similarity with
hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase cytoplasmic (MR-1,
Table 1) and was less abundant in eggs of the HI group
than in eggs of the 2 other experimental groups (Figure 4).
A contig sequence was generated using all rainbow trout
ESTs belonging to the same UniGene cluster
(Omy.19659). This contig sequence was then used to perform a blastX search in GenBank. This contig sequence
corresponded to a partial CDS of the putative rainbow
trout cDNA. The deduced rainbow trout amino acid
sequence exhibited 59% identity with the mouse brain
protein 17 isoform 1 (Figure 5B). This mouse protein is
also known as myofibrillogenesis regulator 1. In addition
a 60% identity was observed with human cognate protein
(Figure 5B) know as myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR1).
Clone tcba0025.n.15 exhibited sequence similarity with
human N-terminal asparagine amidase (NTAN1, Table 1)
and was more abundant in eggs of the HI group than in
eggs of N and PM groups (Figure 4). This sequence did not
belong to any UniGene cluster and did not include a complete CDS. After performing a Blast search using this partial sequence, a 47% identity with the cognate human
form (NTAN1) was observed.
Clone 1RT131K20_C_F10) exhibited sequence similarity
with mouse myosin Ib (MYO1B, Table 1) and was more
abundant in eggs of the PM group than in eggs of HI and
N groups (Figure 4). This sequence did not belong to a
UniGene cluster and did not contain a full CDS. The
observed identity with predicted zebrafish and chicken
cognate forms was 93 and 86% respectively. An 85 and
86% amino acid sequence identity was observed with
human and murine proteins respectively.
Clone tcay0027.b.13 exhibited sequence similarity with
human pyruvate carboxylase (PYC, Table 1) and was more
abundant in eggs of the PM group than in eggs of the N
group, while intermediate levels were observed in eggs of
the HI group (Figure 4). This sequence did not include a
full CDS. After performing a Blast search using this partial
coding sequence, the amino acid sequence identity with
cognate vertebrate forms was above 80%.
Clone 1RT139F11_B_C06 exhibited sequence similarity
with ribosomal protein RPL24 and was more abundant in

eggs of the HI group than in eggs of the PM group (Figure
4). This clone included a full CDS and the deduced amino
acid sequence exhibited very strong (above 95%)
sequence identity with cognate fish proteins (Figure 5C).
For 5 genes (HRNPK, RBM5, DAB2, PGH2 and SEC22,
Table 1) similar expression profiles were observed in realtime PCR and microarray analyses. However, no statistical
differences between groups were observed in the real-time
PCR experiment (Figure 4).
For 3 genes (PKP1, DBNL and LYPA3, Table 1) the consistency between real-time PCR and microarray data was limited to 2 of the 3 experimental groups. In addition, no
statistical differences between groups were observed in the
real-time PCR analysis (Figure 4).
For the 2 remaining clones (BX082249 and CA388269,
Table 1), no correlation was observed between real-time
PCR and microarray data (data not shown).

Genes exhibiting a quality-dependent mRNA abundance in the eggs
Among the 31 genes identified as linked to egg quality, 15
were analyzed by real-time PCR. Among those 15 genes,
the mRNA abundance of 1 gene was found to be significantly correlated with egg quality. This clone (PHB2)
exhibited significant sequence similarity with rat prohibitin 2 (Table 3). Its mRNA abundance in the eggs was negatively correlated (R = -0.47, p < 0.05) with the percentage
normal alevins at yolk-sac resorption. In addition the
mRNA abundance of this gene was significantly higher in
eggs exhibiting the lowest developmental potential (Figure 6). An amino acid sequence was generated from nucleotide sequences of Omy.9050 UniGene cluster. This
deduced amino acid sequence exhibited 83% identity
with zebrafish sequence and 76% identity with human
and rat sequences (Figure 6).

Discussion
Microarray analysis efficiency and reliability
The hybridization of radiolabeled cDNAs with cDNAs
deposited onto nylon membranes has been used for several decades. However, the use of nylon cDNA microarrays is not very common in comparison to glass slide
microarrays. Nevertheless, this technology has successfully been used for several years [21]. In our laboratory,
we have successfully used this technology to identify differentially expressed genes during oocyte maturation and
ovulation [18]. In the present study, we have used the
same methodology and have identified a group of 26
genes exhibiting differential egg mRNA abundance after
natural controlled ovulation with a false discovery rate of
3.4%. Using real-time PCR, the egg mRNA abundance of
17 genes was analyzed. Among those 17 genes, only 2
exhibited expression patterns totally inconsistent with
microarray data. In contrast, the expression patterns of the
other genes were very similar to microarray data, even
though observed differences were not always significant.

It is noteworthy that the 2 genes exhibiting inconsistent
expression patterns between PCR and microarray experiments correspond to uncharacterized proteins. Indeed,
one of the genes (CA388269) had no significant hit in the
Swiss-Prot database while the other one (BX082249) had
a significant hit with a hypothetical yeast protein (Table
1). To conclude, the overall consistency of PCR and
microarray data suggests that the microarray analysis performed in the present study is robust and reliable.
Genes exhibiting a differential mRNA abundance after
natural or controlled ovulation
Hormonal induction of ovulation
Among identified genes, APOC1 and HCK were the most
affected by a hormonal-induction of ovulation. Thus, the
egg mRNA abundance of those 2 genes was dramatically
increased after hormonal induction of ovulation in comparison to natural ovulation (Figure 4). Human APOCs
are protein constituents of chylomicrons, very low density
lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins [22]. The

Amino acid sequence alignment of rainbow trout APOC1 (A), MR-1 (B), and RPL24 (C) with cognate vertebrate forms. For
each target species, the GenBank accession number of the protein is indicated.

human APOC1 protein is predominantly expressed in
liver and adipose tissue [23]. APOC1 may modulate the
activity of plasma enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.
Besides, APOC1 has also been reported to interfere with
the APOE-dependent hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants by the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and
LDLr-related protein [24]. Interestingly, it was previously
shown in rainbow trout that the same clone of the APOC1
gene was significantly up-regulated in the ovary at the
time of oocyte maturation [18]. This could be related to
the arrest of lipoproteins uptake by the oocyte at the end
of vitellogenesis concomitantly with a decrease of the
expression of vitellogenin receptor [25]. It is therefore
possible that the hormonal induction of ovulation
induces an artificial over abundance of some hormonallydependent genes, such as APOC1, in the eggs. However,
the possible consequences of such an over abundance on
lipid metabolism of the embryo is so far unknown.

Similarly to APOC1, the egg mRNA abundance of HCK
gene was also dramatically increased after hormonal
induction of ovulation. HCK, hemopoietic cell kinase,
belongs to Src-familly tyrosine kinases and is expressed in
cells of myelomonocytic lineage, B lymphocytes, and
embryonic stem cells. It was previously shown that the
conventional progesterone receptor could interact, in a
progestin-dependent manner, with various signaling molecules, including Src tyrosine kinases [26]. Indeed, these
authors used downregulated HCK as a general model of
the c-Src family tyrosine kinases to investigate the mechanism of activation by conventional progesterone receptor.
In addition, the participation of the conventional progesterone receptor in African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis)
oocyte maturation process was seriously suggested by two
independent studies [27,28]. Besides, Src tyrosine kinase
activation has been shown to be one of the earliest transcription-independent responses of Xenopus oocytes to

progesterone during in vitro induced maturation; a period
when oocyte mRNA content remains stable [29]. Interestingly, we observed a dramatic over abundance of HCK
mRNA in the eggs after hormonal induction of ovulation.
To date, the significance of this over abundance as a result
of hormonally-induced ovulation is unknown. However,
it further demonstrates that the egg mRNA abundance of
specific genes can be dramatically affected by a hormonal
induction of ovulation.
In addition to APOC1 and HCK, eggs obtained after hormonal induction of ovulation were also characterized by
higher NTAN1 and lower MR-1 mRNA abundance. However, the fold difference observed for those 2 genes was
less important. In mice it has been shown that NTAN1
encodes an N-terminal amidohydrolase specific for N-terminal asparagines, which is involved in ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis termed as the N-end rule pathway [30].
N-end rule pathway determines metabolic instability of
different proteins that contain a destabilizing N-terminal
residue [31]. More specifically, a recent study suggested
that an over expression of NTAN1 using recombinant
NTAN1 adenovirus vector resulted in a marked decrease
in the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) expression in hippocampal neurons in rat [32]. Regardless of the
specific target of NTAN1 in the oocyte, an increased
expression of this enzyme should participate in protein
turnover, and its regulation might be important for the
normal development of the oocyte. The second gene, MR1, is a newly identified protein that interacts with contractile proteins and exists in human myocardial myofibrils
[33].
Finally, the egg mRNA abundance of RPL24 was higher
after hormonal induction of ovulation. However, this difference was only significant in comparison with the PM
group. The 60S ribosomal protein L24 (RPL24) is one of
the forty seven 60S ribosomal proteins present in eukaryotic organisms and often used as markers for phylogenetic
studies and comparative genomics. Those ribosomal proteins have been sequenced recently in catfish (Ictalurus
punctarus) and high similarities with mammalian ribosomal protein were found [34]. 60S ribosomal subunit
participates in translational initiation in combination
with 40S ribosomal subunit [35]. An insertional mutagenesis study carried out in zebrafish (Danio rerio) reported
this gene to be essential for early embryonic development.
Mutation of this gene resulted in small head/eyes mutants
[36]. Interestingly, when monitoring embryonic development in the present study, we noticed that many embryos
originating from eggs of hormonally-induced females
exhibited small eyes at eyeing stage. Precise quantification
of this phenomenon would be necessary to stress its relationship with RPL24 over abundance in the eggs.

Photoperiodic control of ovulation
Four genes exhibited differential egg mRNA abundance
after photoperiod treatment in comparison to natural
ovulation. Similarly to eggs obtained after hormonal
induction of ovulation, eggs of the PM group also exhibited increased levels of APOC1 and HCK. The differential
abundance of both genes was high but less pronounced
than after hormonally-induced ovulation. In addition
eggs obtained after photoperiod manipulation of ovulation were also characterized by higher MYO1B and PYC
mRNA abundance. According to the gene ontology analysis, MYO1B is a cytoskeleton protein involved in nervous
system development (Table 2). It is also expressed in a
wide variety of tissues including rat neonatal tissues
[37,38]. The class I myosin, MYO1B, is a calmodulin- and
actin-associated molecular motor widely expressed in
mammalian tissues [39]. MYO1B can interact on the
dynamic actin filament populations and might play a role
in intracellular membrane trafficking [40]. Myosin light
chain has been recently suggested to participate in anchoring the 26S proteasome, a 26S multiprotein complex that
catalyses the breakdown of polyubiquitylated proteins, to
the actin cytoskeleton of goldfish oocyte [41]. Degradation of proteins mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays important roles in the regulation of eukaryotic
cell cycle [42] and can be involved in oocyte maturation
and further embryonic cell cleavages.

Pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) is a mitochondrial biotindependent carboxylase. In the adipose tissue and liver
PYC participates in the citrate shuttle by which NADPH
equivalents are transported out of mitochondria to the
cytosol for lipogenesis [43]. Five alternative forms of rat
pyruvate carboxylase cDNAs have been identified in liver,
kidney, brain, and adipose tissue and these are expressed
in a tissue-specific manner [44-46]. In red Seabream
(Pagrus major), PYC mRNA was detected by Northen blot
analysis in heart, liver, muscle and ovary [47]. Interestingly, it was previously shown that a photoperiod manipulation of spawning date was associated with a
significantly higher occurrence of yolk-sac resorption
defects [48]. Together, these observations suggest a putative link between an abnormal stockpiling of PYC mRNA
in the egg and problems in the processing and/or use of
yolk-sac lipidic stores. Indeed, it was previously reported
that non viable gilthead sea bream eggs have lower pyruvate carboxylase activity than viable eggs [49].
Genes exhibited an egg mRNA abundance correlated with
egg's developmental potential
From microarray data, 30 genes were identified as exhibiting an egg mRNA abundance correlated with egg's developmental potential. However, the false discovery rate was
elevated and those genes were considered as candidate
genes requiring PCR validation. Nevertheless, it is note-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:55

worthy that the ontological analysis of this group showed
that 5 genes are involved in the regulation of transcription
and others in cell proliferation/development and
cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis. In addition,
the correlation was confirmed for 1 of the 15 genes analyzed by real-time PCR: prohibitin 2 (PHB2). In animals
and yeast, prohibitins have been shown to play important
roles in cell cycling and senescence. One of prohibitin 2
major role is to be a chaperone-like regulator of the AAA
protease in the mitochondrial matrix that assists in the
assembly of inner membrane complex [50]. In Caenorhabditis elegans, PHB proteins were showed to be essential
during embryonic development and are required for
somatic and germ line differentiation in the larval gonad
[51]. Moreover, deletions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
homologues, PHB1 and PHB2, result in a decreased replicative lifespan, and a defect in mitochondrial membrane
potential. The prohibitin protein has been immunolocalized in mammalian oocytes and embryos and suggested
to have an antiproliferative activity [52]. Besides, a higher
immunoreactivity level was found in the nucleus of
embryo that failed to develop normally in comparison to
morphologically normal ones. In the present study, we
observed a higher prohibitin 2 mRNA abundance in eggs
exhibiting the lowest developmental potential. This differential abundance in eggs of varying quality suggests
that prohibitin 2 plays a role in the developmental potential of the embryo. Further studies are needed to unravel
the link between an overabundance of prohibitin 2
mRNA in the eggs and a reduced egg developmental
potential. Thus, this overabundance could be the result of
a reduced prohibitin 2 synthesis during oogenesis.

Conclusion
In the present study we successfully used rainbow trout
cDNA microarrays to analyze egg transcriptome after natural and controlled ovulation and in relationship with the
developmental potential of the eggs. We showed that the
control of ovulation using either a hormonal induction or
a manipulated photoperiod could induce differences in
the egg mRNA abundance of specific genes.
In addition, we showed that the egg mRNA abundance of
prohibitin 2 (PHB2) was negatively correlated with the
developmental potential of the egg.
Furthermore, the identity and ontology of identified genes
provided significant hints that could result in a better
understanding of the mechanisms associated with each
type of ovulation control (e.g hormonal, photoperiodic)
or conserved mechanisms triggering a loss of egg developmental potential.

Methods
Animals
Investigations were conducted according to the guiding
principles for the use and care of laboratory animals and
in compliance with French and European regulations on
animal welfare. Three groups of male and female rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were obtained from our
experimental fish farm (Sizun, France) and maintained
until reproductive season under natural photoperiod and
water temperature conditions. A first set of egg samples
was collected from females undergoing natural (N) ovulation. Four weeks before expected ovulation fish (25
females) were transferred in a controlled recirculated
water system (12°C) under natural photoperiod in INRA
experimental facilities (Rennes, France). A second set of
egg samples was collected from females subjected to a
hormonal induction (HI) of ovulation. Four weeks before
expected ovulation fish were transferred in a controlled
recirculated water system (12°C) under natural photoperiod in INRA experimental facilities (Rennes, France).
Females (n = 33) were given a 250 µL.Kg-1 body weight
(b.w) intraperitoneal injection of [Des-Gly10, DArg6, ProNHEt9]-GnRH analog (Bachem, Allemagne) at 60 µg.Kg-1
b.w. A third set of egg samples was collected from females
subjected to a photoperiod manipulation (PM) of ovulation. After a first reproduction, fish (17 females) were isolated in light-proofed tanks and exposed to an artificial
photoperiod. Beginning on January 15th, all fish were held
under constant light (24L:0D) for 490°C.day. Then,
beginning on March 27th, they were held under short photoperiod (8L:16D) until ovulation (1230°C.day). Light
was supplied by 4 neon tubes (58 Watts).
Gamete collection
In order to avoid excessive post-ovulatory ageing, unfertilized eggs were collected by manual stripping 5 days after
detected ovulation. Two batches of 5 mL of eggs (approximately 100 to 200 eggs per batch) were used for fertilization. At each egg collection day, fresh sperm samples were
collected from 10 mature males originating from the same
group in order to fertilize eggs with a pool of sperms.
Sperm samples were obtained by manual pressure on the
abdomen and kept at 4°C for a short time before use.
Fertilization and early development
Fertilization was performed under previously described
standardized conditions [16]. The two batches of 5 mL of
eggs were fertilized with 5 µl of pooled semen. Fertilized
eggs were transferred into compartmentalized incubation
trays supplied by recirculated water (10°C). Water temperature and chemistry were routinely monitored and
maintained constant over the entire incubation period.
Dead eggs and embryos were periodically removed and
survival rates were estimated as percentages of the initial
number of eggs used for fertilization. Survival at the com-

pletion of yolk sac resorption (YSR, 550°C.day) was monitored. The occurrence of noticeable morphological
malformations at YSR was also monitored. Survival and
malformation data were used to calculate the proportion
of normal alevins at YSR expressed as a percentage of the
initial number of eggs.
RNA extraction
Extractions were performed as previously described [53]
with minor modifications. Total RNA was extracted from
20 unfertilized eggs using 9 mL of TRizol (Invitrogen) in
13 mL sterile polypropylene tubes. Because of high egg
vitellogenic content, each RNA was subsequently repurified using a Nucleospin RNA 2 kit (Macherey Nagel) in
order to obtain genomic-grade RNA quality. For each egg
sample, three RNA extracts were obtained, pooled and
precipitated with sodium acetate (3 M, pH5.2, Prolabo) to
increase RNA concentration. Thus, any RNA sample used
for transcriptomic analysis originated from 60 unfertilized eggs of an individual female.
cDNA microarrays
Nylon micro-arrays (7.6 × 2.6 cm) were obtained from
INRA-GADIE (Jouy-en-Josas, France) resource center [54].
A set of 9152 distinct rainbow trout cDNA clones originating from 2 pooled-tissues library [55,56] were spotted in
duplicates after PCR amplification. PCR products were
spotted onto Hybond N+ membranes as previously
described [57]. This rainbow trout generic array was
deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
(Platform# GPL3650) [58].
Microarray hybridization
Four RNA samples originating from naturally ovulating
females, 11 RNA samples originating from hormonallyinduced females and 14 RNA samples originating from
photoperiod-manipulated females were used for microarray hybridization according to the following procedure.
Hybridizations were carried out as previously described
[21], with minor modifications, at INRA genomic facility
(Rennes). A first hybridization was performed using a
33P-labelled oligonucleotide (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG which is present at the extremity of each PCR product) to monitor the amount of cDNA in each spot. After
stripping (3 hours 68°c, 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS), arrays were
prehybridized for 1 h at 65°C in hybridization solution
(5× Denhardt's, 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS). Complex probes were
prepared from 3 µg of RNA by simultaneous reverse transcription and labelling for 1 hour at 42°C in the presence
of 50 µCi [alpha-33P] dCTP, 5 µM dCTP, 0.8 mM each
dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 200 units M-MLV SuperScript
RNase H-reverse transcriptase (GIBCO BRL) in 30 µL final
volume. RNA was degraded by treatment at 68°C for 30
min with 1 µl 10% SDS, 1 µl 0.5 M EDTA and 3 µl 3 M
NaOH, and then equilibrated at room temperature for 15

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/55

min. Neutralization was done by adding 10 µl 1 M TrisHCl plus 3 µl 2N HCl. Arrays were incubated with the corresponding denatured labeled cDNAs for 18 h at 65°C in
hybridization solution. After 3 washes (1 hours 68°C,
0.1× SSC 0.2% SDS), arrays were exposed 65 hours to
phosphor-imaging plates before scanning using a FUJI
BAS 5000. Signal intensities were quantified using
ArrayGauge software (FujifilmMedical Systems, Stanford,
CT) and deposited in GEO database (Series# GSE5928)
[58].
Microarray signal processing
Spots with low oligonucleotide signal (lower than three
times the background level) were excluded from the analysis. After this filtering step, signal processing was performed using the vector oligonucleotide data to correct
each spot signal by the actual amount of DNA present in
each spot. After correction, signal was normalized by
dividing each gene expression value by the median value
of the array.
Microarray data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) software [59]. For each comparison, the lowest false discovery rate (FDR) was used to
identify differentially abundant genes. A first analysis was
performed in order to identify differentially abundant
transcripts between N group and the two other experimental groups (HI and PM). A second analysis was performed in order to identify differentially abundant
transcripts in relation with egg quality, estimated by percentage of normal alevins at YSR within the complete data
set or inside each experimental group (HI and PM).
Identity of mircroarray cDNA clones
Rainbow trout sequences originating from INRA AGENAE
[55] and USDA [56] EST sequencing programs were used
to generate publicly available contigs [60]. The 8th version (Om.8, released January 2006) was used for BlastX
[61] comparison against the Swiss-Prot database (January
2006) [62]. The score of each alignment was retrieved
after performing BlastX comparison. This was performed
automatically for each EST spotted onto the membrane
and used to annotate the 9152 clones of the microarray.
Data mining
For all the clones identified as differentially abundant
after a SAM analysis (Table 1, 3) the official human gene
symbol was retrieved [63] and used in the text, figures and
tables for clarity reasons. In addition, the accession
number of the corresponding rainbow trout cluster (UniGene Trout, January 2006), if any, was retrieved from the
UniGene database [64]. For all genes identified as differentially abundant in the transcriptomic analysis, ontologies were obtained using the AmiGO tool [65]. Finally, for

Page 15 of 17

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:55

the differentially abundant genes identified in the realtime PCR analysis, a BlastX search was performed against
the GenBank NR database. When possible, this was done
using the contig sequence generated from all the ESTs
present in the corresponding UniGene cluster. Subsequently, the amino acid sequence deduced from the trout
contig sequence was aligned with cognate vertebrate
forms.
Real-time PCR analysis
Real-time PCR was performed using all RNA samples used
for microarray analysis (N = 29). Reverse transcription
and real time PCR were performed as previously described
[66]. Briefly, 2 µg of total RNA were reverse transcribed
using 200 units of Moloney murine Leukemia virus
(MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI)
and 0.5 µg dT15 Oligonucleotide (Promega) per µg of
total RNA according to manufacturer's instruction. RNA
and dNTPs were denatured for 6 min at 70°C; then chilled
on ice for 5 min before the reverse transcription master
mix was added. Reverse transcription was performed at
37°C for 1 hour and 15 min followed by a 15 min incubation step at 70°C. Control reactions were run without
MMLV reverse transcriptase and used as negative controls
in the real-time PCR study. Real-time PCR experiments
were conducted using an I-Cycler IQ (Biorad, Hercules,
CA). Reverse transcription products were diluted to 1/25,
and 5 µl were used for each real-time PCR reaction. Triplicates were run for each RT product. Real-time PCR was
performed using a real-time PCR kit provided with a SYBR
Green fluorophore (Eurogentec, Belgium) according to
the manufacturer's instructions and using 600 nM of each
primer. After a 2 min incubation step at 50°C and a 10
min incubation step at 95°C, the amplification was performed using the following cycle: 95°C, 20 sec; 60°C, 1
min, 40 times. The relative abundance of target cDNA
within sample set was calculated from a serially diluted
oocyte cDNA pool using the I-Cycler IQ software. After
amplification, a fusion curve was obtained using the following protocol: 10 sec holding followed by a 0.5°C
increase, repeated 80 times and starting at 55°C. The level
of CyclinA2 RNAs was monitored using the same sample
set to allow normalization. Cyclin A2 was used for normalization because its mRNA abundance was shown to be
elevated and highly stable in rainbow trout eggs collected
5 days after ovulation ([16]). Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 7.0 software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK).
Differences between groups were analyzed using non parametric U tests.
