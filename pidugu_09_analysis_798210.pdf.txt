Abstract
Background: The hot dog fold has been found in more than sixty proteins since the first report
of its existence about a decade ago. The fold appears to have a strong association with fatty acid
biosynthesis, its regulation and metabolism, as the proteins with this fold are predominantly
coenzyme A-binding enzymes with a variety of substrates located at their active sites.
Results: We have analyzed the structural features and sequences of proteins having the hot dog
fold. This study reveals that though the basic architecture of the fold is well conserved in these
proteins, significant differences exist in their sequence, nature of substrate and oligomerization.
Segments with certain conserved sequence motifs seem to play crucial structural and functional
roles in various classes of these proteins.
Conclusion: The analysis led to predictions regarding the functional classification and
identification of possible catalytic residues of a number of hot dog fold-containing hypothetical
proteins whose structures were determined in high throughput structural genomics projects.

Background
The 'Hot dog' fold was first identified in the crystal structure of β-hydroxydecanoyl thiolester dehydratase (FabA)
from E. coli [1]. The hot dog fold in this structure is
formed by a sausage-like long central helix wrapped
around by a highly curved six-stranded β-sheet resembling
the bun (Fig. 1). Several protein structures determined
since then were shown to contain this fold. These proteins
take part in several functions including the dehydration
step of fatty acid elongation, thioester hydrolysis, transcription regulation in fatty acid metabolism and degradation of phenylacetic acid and environmental pollutants.

It appears that the hot dog fold is designed for coenzyme
A (CoA) binding in cellular processes involving fatty acids
and related molecules. The binding site in FabA has been
identified as a well-formed deep tunnel present at the subunit interface [1]. Residues from both subunits contribute
to the formation of the tunnel which is hydrophobic in
nature except at the two catalytic residues His70 and
Asp84. FabA, being a homodimer, consists of two tunnels
related by a twofold symmetry. The active site is located
slightly below the surface of the protein and the active residues at each site come from a different subunit.

Dillon and Bateman [2] have unified the large superfamily of hot dog fold proteins by an extensive analysis of
their sequences. They have classified a large number of
proteins from prokaryotes, archaea and eukaryotes of this
superfamily into 17 subfamilies based on the clustering of
sequences and available structural and biochemical information. Consensus sequence motifs were identified by
them for each subfamily. Though all these proteins possess the hot dog fold, the inter-subfamily sequence similarities are very low (10–20%). They showed that the hot
dog fold domain, though exists as a single entity of the
coded proteins, also associates with other domains, suggesting the occurrence of domain fusion events involving
this domain. It has been found to be associated with a second hot dog fold domain in tandem and also with various
types of other domains such as LpxC (UDP-3-O-acyl Nacetylglucosamine deacetylase), AMP binding, acyl transferase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and a few more [2].

In the last two years, there has been an enormous increase
in reports of the structures of hot dog fold containing proteins and the deposition of their coordinates in the Protein Data Bank. Currently, the PDB contains more than
sixty non-redundant crystal structures of proteins with the
hot dog fold, a majority of them being hypothetical proteins taken up by structural genomics programs, for which
no other characterization has been reported until now
(see Additional file 1). The availability of a reasonable
number of crystal structures of hot dog fold proteins facilitated a more detailed comparative analysis across the
subfamilies. Here, we attempt to group these hot dog fold
proteins into their corresponding subfamilies and analyze
the structure-function relationships of the subfamilies
having representative crystal structures. This paper
describes a detailed structural comparison of the hot dog
fold proteins and their different modes of quaternary
associations and functional diversity. This analysis made

it possible to predict functional subfamilies and identify
possible catalytic residues for a number of hypothetical
proteins with known structures which should aid in further experimental verifications.

Results and Discussion
Diversity in quaternary association and function
Each subunit of a hot dog fold is made up of 5 or 6 highly
curved antiparallel β-strands wrapped around a long αhelix. Our analysis indicated that the basic structural
repeat unit of the hot dog fold proteins is either a
homodimer of two such subunits or a double hot dog
with a single polypeptide chain folding into two hot dog
domains (Fig. 1). The dimer of hot dog folds is formed by
the association of β-sheets from both the subunits to form
a continuous anti-parallel β-sheet. The two helices run
antiparallel to each other at the dimer interface. In the
enzymes with the repeat unit as the dimer of hot dogs, the
active sites comprise residues from both the subunits. In
the case of double hot dogs, the two domains have an
undetectable sequence similarity (~10% identity as
derived from structure-based alignment). However, at the
nucleotide level, the sequence identity between the two
domains of the double hot dogs is around 50% [3].
Though these basic building blocks (homodimer or double hot dog) of various subfamilies are similar with root
mean square deviations (rmsd) of 1.0–3.0 Å for the Cα
atoms, they differ in their quaternary associations and are
highly divergent in their sequences. The various quaternary associations observed are dimers (D); tetramers with
central helix interactions at the tetramer interface (TA);
tetramers with back to back stacking of the β-sheets of the
repeating units (TB); hexamers with active site loops at the
interface (H1); hexamers with N-terminal helices at the
interface (H2); hexamers with head-to-tail arrangement of
dimers (H3); dimers of double hot dogs with central helix
interactions (DdhA); dimers of double hot dogs with back
to back stacking of β-sheets (DdhB); and trimers of double
hot dogs (Trdh) which appear like H2 (Fig. 2). The two
domains of the double hot dogs are connected by long
loops. Though they connect the second β-strand from the
centre in the first subunit to the last β-strand of the second
subunit in all the cases, the loops have considerable variation in length and conformation and also in the direction they follow to connect the subunits. This variation in
the nature of the connecting loops appears to be linked
with the quaternary association (DdhA, DdhB and Trdh) of
the double hot dog fold proteins. The analysis of buried
surface areas of various types of quaternary association
has revealed that approximately 17–20%, 20–25%, 26–
30%, 32–36%, 26–30% and 16% surface area per monomer gets buried upon the formation of D, TA, TB, H1, H2
and H3 types of quaternary associations, respectively.

An analysis of these proteins indicates the following general features: The hot dog fold domain does not exist as a
single entity. It always forms a dimer (or a double hot
dog) or higher oligomers. There are different modes of
association of the basic building blocks in higher oligomers, but strict correlation between oligomeric state and
function has not always been observed. Subfamilies with
hot dog fold proteins of similar quaternary associations
differ in their substrate specificities. On the other hand,
proteins with different quaternary associations and highly
divergent sequences can carryout the same reaction as in
the case of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases. In all the
crystal structures considered, the consensus sequence
motifs identified earlier [2,4] are localized at the active site
and at the interface of the quaternary association indicating that the information about the substrate specificity
and quaternary association are encoded in the sequence.
Variations of the consensus sequence at the interface
change the oligomeric state. The double hot dog domains
are found to accommodate bulkier substrates and generally contain one active site per dimer instead of two. The
structure-function relationships of subfamilies with the
available representative crystal structures (see Additional
file 1 and 2) are discussed here.
Subfamilies of the hot dog fold suprefamily of proteins
1. Dehydratases (FabA and FabZ)
The two subfamilies of dehydratases, FabA-like dehydratases and FabZ-like dehydratases have been well studied both biochemically and structurally. Both FabA and
FabZ are isozymes catalyzing the third step of elongation
in Type II fatty acid biosynthesis. FabZ is only a dehydratase while FabA has an additional isomerase activity.
The biological oligomer of FabZ is a hexamer [5-7], a
trimer of dimers where the active site loops are stabilized
by the interactions at the hexameric interface. However,
FabA is active as a dimer [1]. Dimers of FabA and FabZ
superpose with a rmsd of around 1.5 Å and the positions
of the catalytic dyad (Glu-His in the case of FabZ and AspHis in the case of FabA) are structurally conserved. The
two cis peptides Tyr-Pro (FabZ)/Ala-Pro (FabA) in the Nterminal loop lining the active site tunnel and His-Phe
harbouring the catalytic histidine are conserved in both
the classes of enzymes. However, there is a subtle difference in the overall architecture of the active site tunnels,
which was attributed to the additional isomerase activity
of FabA [8]. It was shown by domain-swapping experiments that the β-strand at the dimer interface and the loop
connecting this β-strand to the next one are important for
isomerase activity [9]. In the case of FabA, consensus
sequence motifs are localized to the loops that form the
active site tunnel and the region responsible for the isomerase activity, while in the case of FabZ, the consensus
sequence motifs are located on active site loops which are
also involved in hexameric contacts. When a hexamer of

Various quaternary associations of hot dog fold proteins. D – dimer (PDB code: 1MKA); dh – double hot dog (PDB
code: 1C8U); H1 – hexamer with active site loops at interface (PDB code: 1Z6B); H2 – hexamer with N-terminal helices at

central helix interactions (PDB code: 1BVQ); TB – tetramer with back to back stacking of the β-sheets (PDB code: 1Q4T).
DdhA (dimer of double hot dog with central helix interactions) is similar to TA while DdhB (dimer of double hot dogs with back
to back interaction of the β-sheets) is similar to TB. Trdh (trimer of double hot dogs) is similar to H2.

FabA was generated by superimposing three dimers onto
the three dimers of hexameric FabZ, severe steric clashes
of less than 1 Å were observed at the dimer-dimer interfaces between the atoms of the loops containing the catalytic histidine and the loop involved in isomerase activity,
thus indicating the neccessity of the dimeric state of FabA
to function as a dehydratase/isomerase.
Each step of the FAS II pathway present in bacteria and
plants is catalyzed by a distinct enzyme. In contrast to this,
in the FAS I pathway of mammals and fungi, all the reactions are catalyzed by a large single multienzyme complex
called the synthase. The dehydratase domain identified in

each subunit of the homodimeric porcine fatty acid synthase structure (PDB code: 2CF2[10]) was found to have
the double hot dog fold flanked by FabD (malonyl-CoA/
acyl-CoA-ACP transacylase) and FabI (NADPH-dependent β-enoyl reductase) domains. As the structure is available at a low resolution of 4.5 Å and the deposited
coordinates contain only the Cα atoms of the fitted
model, it is not included in further analysis presented in
the paper.
2. Thioesterases

protein (ACP) [11]. The thioesterases belong to different
subfamilies of hot dog fold proteins as they differ in their
substrate specificities and are also highly divergent in
sequences. Eight of the seventeen subfamilies [2] of hot
dog fold proteins are thioesterases and representative crystal structures are available for all of these thioesterase subfamilies (see Additional file 1).
a. Acyl-CoA thioesterases
Acyl-CoA thioesterases are widespread in prokaryotes and
are also found in a few eukaryotes. In mammalian systems, these enzymes have a double hot dog domain and a
START (StAR related lipid-transfer) domain while in others the basic building block is the dimer of hot dogs. Crystal structures with PDB codes: 1VPM (B. halodurans), 1YLI
(H. influenzae), 1Y7U (B. cereus), 2GVH (A. tumefaciens),
2QQ2 (Human acyl-CoA thioesterase 7), 2EIS (T. thermophilus) and 3B7K (human acyl-CoA thioesterase 12)
from structural genomics programs have the consensus
sequence of acyl-CoA thioesterases. All these structures
show H2 type hexamer formation while 2GVH and 3B7K
form trimers of double hot dog domains (Trdh). Asp44 of
the H. influenzae enzyme (1YLI) [12] has been identified
as the catalytic residue by mutagenesis. Structures of the
N- and C-terminal domains of the mouse Acyl-CoA
thioesterase 7 were determined separately (PDB codes:
2V1O and 2Q2B respectively) and Asp213 along with
Asn24 were found to take part in catalysis. Though the
individual domains of this protein form H2 type of hexamers of the N-terminal domain and dimers of the C-terminal domain, the full length protein was shown to be a
trimer with Trdh arrangement in solution [13]. The catalytic aspartate residue found in the reported structures is
conserved in the rest of the hypothetical proteins (see
Additional file 2) and thus could be identified as the catalytic residue in these enzymes. Some of the proteins in
this class possess an additional long helix at the C-terminus (Fig. 3). These helices of varying lengths in different
structures wrap around the hexamer.
b. TesB-like thioesterases
TesB-like thioesterases found mostly in bacteria and
eukaryotes include the human peroxisomal enzyme that
binds to the HIV Nef protein. The crystal structure of TesB,
the medium chain acyl-CoA thioesterase II from E. coli
(EcThII; PDB code: 1C8U) for the first time showed the
structure of a double hot dog. The biologically active oligomeric state is a dimer of double hot dogs (DdhB) with
the consensus sequence at the dimer interface and the
active site. The dimer is formed by the back to back stacking of the 12 stranded β-sheets. The crystal structure
revealed a novel catalytic mechanism wherein a hydrogen-bonded triad of Asp204, Thr228 and Gln278 are
identified by site directed mutagenesis as catalytic residues
and synergistically activate a water molecule for nucle-

ophilic attack [14]. The crystal structure of a putative peroxisomal thioesterase from yeast (PDB code: 1TBU) with
the hot dog fold structure forms a tetramer of type TB and
has only the first few consensus sequence motifs which do
not include the catalytic triad.
c. YbgC-like thioesterases
The YbgC-like thioesterases, that belong to the tol-pal cluster, act on short chain aliphatic acyl-CoA as shown in the
gamma-proteobacterium Haemophilus influenzae [15].
This tol-pal cluster operon is well conserved in all gramnegative bacteria and is shown to be crucial for the maintenance of cell envelope integrity [16]. The crystal structures of the hypothetical proteins with PDB codes: 1S5U
(E. coli), 1Z54 (T. thermophilus), 2GF6 (S. solfataricus),
2HX5 (P. marinus) and 2EGJ (A. aeolicus) have a hot dog
fold in the subunits and a consensus sequence of the
YbgC-like subfamily. Further, a tetramer of the type TA is
formed within the asymmetric unit or with the symmetryrelated molecules, indicating that the tetramer might be
the biologically active oligomer. Zhuang et al. (2002) [15]
have shown in the case of the H. influenzae YbgC protein
that the D18N mutant was not capable of hydrolyzing the
short chain aliphatic acyl-CoA thioesters, thus suggesting
a catalytic role for this aspartate residue. This residue
present in the consensus sequence motif is conserved in
all the proteins (see Additional file 2) mentioned above.
d. 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase-associated thioesterases
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase-associated thioesterases are specific to short chain fatty acids of fatty acid
metabolism catalyzing the reduction of 3-hydroxyacylCoA to 3-oxoacyl-CoA [17]. The crystal structure of a
hypothetical protein from Pseudomonas putida (PDB code:
2HLJ) possesses the conserved sequence motif of the
hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase subfamily. One hot dog
subunit is present in the asymmetric unit and forms a
dimer with a symmetry-related molecule with the consensus sequence motif present at the active site.
e. 4-Hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases
4-Hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases, encoded by the
fcbC gene, are involved in the degradation of the environmental pollutant 4-chlorobenzoate to 4-hydroxybenzoate. The 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA degradation pathway
operons of certain Pseudomonas and Arthobacter bacterial
strains show significant differences in gene order and
sequences [18]. Both the subfamilies (i) 4HBT-I (from
Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS-3; PDB code: 1BVQ[19],
1LO7[20]) and (ii) 4HBT-II (from Arthobacter sp. strain
SU*; PDB code: 1Q4T) have been studied both biochemically and structurally. Though both the enzymes form
tetramers, they have different modes of quaternary association, CoA binding sites and catalytic architecture. In the
case of 4HBT-I, TA tetramers are formed, while 4HBT-II

enzymes form TB tetramers. The structures of these two
enzymes in complex with inhibitors revealed that the 4hydroxy phenacyl moieties are oriented such that the
thioester C = O can form a hydrogen bond with the amide
nitrogen atoms of Tyr24 and Gly65 located at the N-terminus of the central helix in Pseudomonas (4HBT-I) and
Arthobacter (4HBT-II), respectively. Due to the hydrogen
bond and the polarity of the helix, the C = O group is
polarized, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.
Though the catalytic mechanism is similar, the positions
of the carboxylate residues, Asp17 in 4HBT-I (1BVQ) and
Glu73 in 4HBT-II (1Q4T[21]), involved in catalysis are
different. These two enzymes having the same fold and
catalyzing the same reaction differ remarkably in their
quaternary associations. In 4HBT-I the active site is
formed at the dimer interface, while in 4HBT II three subunits contribute to the active site. A hypothetical protein

(PDB code: 2OAF) has a consensus sequence motif of that
of 4HBT-I and forms a TA tetramer. For 4HBT-II, the extra
N-terminal motif, which is also one of the consensus
motifs, is positioned before the central helix and prevents
the formation of helix-to-helix packing observed in the
quaternary association of 4HBT-I. The crystal structures of
hypothetical proteins with PDB codes: 1O0I (H. influenzae), 1VH5 (E. coli) and 1VH9 (E. coli) have the consensus
sequence of the 4HBT-II subfamily and a similar mode of
quaternary association. In all these proteins, the catalytic
machinery is both sequentially and structurally conserved
within the subfamilies.
f. PaaI-Thioesterases specific to phenylacetic acid
PaaI is a thioesterase involved in the phenylacetic acid catabolic pathway, catalyzing the degradation of phenylacetyl-CoA [22]. PaaI from Thermus thermophilus (TtPaaI;

BMC Structural Biology 2009, 9:37

PDB code 1J1Y) and E. coli (EcPaaI: PDB code: 2FS2) have
been characterized both structurally and biochemically.
They also form TB tetramers similar to the 4HBT-II subfamily. A novel induced fit mechanism was observed in
the case of TtPaaI, where only two of the four active sites
accommodate the ligand, indicating half of the sites reactivity. A rotation of up to 2° of the subunits upon ligand
binding introduces a negative cooperativity preventing
the binding of ligands at the other two active sites [23]. In
the case of EcPaaI, the overall structure is similar to that of
TtPaaI except for the presence of an additional long N-terminal helix that lines the active site (Fig. 4).The helix has
a kink in two subunits of the tetramer [24] giving rise to
two different catalytic platforms. It was further confirmed
by site directed mutagenesis of the active site residues in
both conformations of the helix that the subunit with the
kinked N-terminal helix is catalytically active [24]. Four
hypothetical proteins (PDB codes: 1ZKI from P. aeruginosa, 2CY9 from M. musculus, 2QWZ from Silicibacter sp.,
2PIM from R. eutropha) and a putative human enzyme
(2F0X[25]) form tetramers of the type TB similar to that of
TtPaaI whereas another protein (3BBJ) is a double hot dog
with a DdhB type of quaternary structure. Hypothetical
proteins 1IXL (P. horikoshii) [26], 2HBO (C. crescentus),
2PRX (S. loihica) and 2OV9 (Rhodococcus sp.) possess the
active site consensus sequence motif (see Additional file
2) of PaaI but show variation in the consensus sequence
motif located at the tetramer interface (see Additional file
2). These four proteins form dimers of hot dogs. In TtPaaI,
Asp48 identified as the catalytic residue [23], occurs in the
consensus sequence motif and is found to be conserved in
all the proteins of this subfamily. The variation in the second consensus sequence motif that is present at the
tetramer interfaces, might be responsible for the proteins
of this subfamily having different oligomeric structures.
However, the substrate specificities of these proteins are
yet to be confirmed. The structure of 2OV9 is different
from the others with an additional long loop consisting of
two helices from each subunit forming a four-helix bundle as a separate domain (Fig. 5).
g. Fat-Thioesterases specific to acyl-ACPs
Acyl-ACP thioesterases terminate the Type II fatty acid
biosynthesis by hydrolysing the thioester bond between
an acyl moiety and ACP [27]. Two gene classes, fatA and
fatB, exist in higher plants, and differ in sequence and substrate specificities [27,28]. The Fat subfamily of hot dog
fold proteins contains members from both FatA and FatB
classes [2]. The crystal structures of hypothetical proteins
from B. thetaiotaomicron (PDB code: 2ESS) and L.
plantarum (PDB code: 2OWN) possess tetramers formed
by the dimers of double hot dogs with the central helices
pointing inward (DdhA). This central helix contains the
consensus sequence of the Fat subfamily. These proteins
share a sequence identity of >20% with FatA and FatB of

Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, these two hypothetical
proteins can be considered as members of the Fat subfamily.
3. (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratases or MaoC dehydratase-like
subfamily
(R)-specific enoyl hydratase that catalyzes the hydration
of trans-2-enoyl-CoA to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA is
involved in supplying the (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA from
the fatty acid oxidation pathway to the polyhydroxy
alkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis pathway [29]. The eukaryotic enzyme is found to be an integral part of a peroxisomal
multifunctional protein (MFE-2 in fungi and MFE-1 in
mammals) [4,30-32]. The crystal structures of a prokaryotic (R)-hydratase (PDB code: 1IQ6) from Aeromonas caviae, a eukaryotic hydratase 2 (PDB code: 1PN2) from
Candida tropicalis and a human enzyme (PDB code: 1S9C)
are available. In these structures, the loop corresponding
to the one containing the catalytic histidine of the dehydratase FabA of E. coli, is longer by about 35 residues. This
additional segment called the 'overhanging segment' contains both the catalytic residues Asp31 and His36 in 1IQ6.
The prokaryotic enzyme forms a dimer of hot dogs with
two such segments i.e., two catalytic sites, while the
eukaryotic and human hydratases are dimers of double
hot dogs, with each subunit having one catalytic site (Fig.
6). The double hot dog of eukaryotic and human

2), reflecting the differences in quaternary association and
substrate specificities. However, all the proteins of this
subfamily share a sequence identity of around 15–40%
and the catalytic dyad Asp31 & His36 is highly conserved
both sequentially and structurally.

hydratase 2, supposed to have arisen due to gene duplication, has structurally diverged during evolution to accommodate bulky fatty enoyl-CoAs at the cost of one catalytic
site [3,33,34].
The consensus sequence motif for this subfamily has been
identified by Qin et al. (2000) [4]. The current analysis
suggests that the overhanging segment containing this
sequence motif can also be considered as a structural
motif of this subfamily as it is present in all the three proteins (1IQ6, 1PN2 and 1S9C) for which crystal structures
and biochemical characterization are available. Three
hypothetical proteins, one from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(PDB code: 2BI0[35]) and two from Archaeoglobus fulgidus
(PDB codes: 1Q6W and 2B3M) can be classified into this
subfamily. The first one is a trimer of double hot dog
folds, the second one is a trimer of dimers and the third
one is a dimer of hot dog folds indicating that the quaternary association is not conserved in this subfamily.
Though all these proteins have hydratase activity, they differ in their substrate specificities. For example, recently
cloned and characterized R-hydratases from the P. aureginosa PHA biosynthesis pathway, PhaJ1-PhaJ4 show a variation in activity based on the length of the fatty acyl chain
of enoyl-CoAs [36]. PhaJ1 can act only on short chain
enoyl-CoAs (C4–C6), while the other three can act on
longer (C8–C12) enoyl-CoAs. The consensus sequence
motif of the hydratase 2 domain [4] though present in this
subclass of enzymes shows variation (see Additional file

The crystal structures of FAS I synthase of yeast (PDB code:
2UV8[37]) and Thermomyces lanuginosus (PDB codes:
2UV9 and 2UVA[38]) are available at 3.1 resolution. In
contrast to the mammalian homodimeric enzymes, these
two exist as α6β6 dodecamers. The dehydratase domain
located on the β subunit has a unique triple hot dog fold.
The first and the third hot dog domains associate as pseudodimers and are structurally similar to eukaryotic
hydrates 2 enzymes having the double hot dog fold with
the catalytic residues in the overhanging segment of the Cterminal domain. The second hot dog domain is inserted
in the long loop connecting the first and the third hot dog
domains in the same way the domains in the double hot
dog structures are connected. The central helix of this
domain is much shorter and has a different orientation
compared to that in the typical hot dog domain described
here. The yeast enzyme, which is well refined, has been
included in the present analysis.
The crystal structure of a hypothetical protein from M.
tuberculosis (PDB code: 2C2I) possesses the consensus
sequence motif of the NodN-like subfamily, a subgroup
of MaoC like hydratases [39]. This protein is a dimer with
two overhanging segments which contain the catalytic residues Asp40 and His45. The N-terminus of each subunit
has an additional short β-strand and a small α-helix. A
proline residue Pro71 at the centre of the central helix
causes a 25° kink in the long helix (Fig. 7), giving rise to
a curved long tunnel similar to eukaryotic and human
hydratase 2 enzymes which are specific to longer substrates.
4. YbaW subfamily
Structural genomics programs have shown that the crystal
structures of conserved hypothetical protein YbaW (PDB
codes: 1NJK from E. coli, 2ALI from P. aeruginosa, 2AV9
from P. aeruginosa, 2CYE from T. thermophilus, 2FUJ from
X. campestris [40], 2NUJ from Jannaschia sp. CCS1, 2OIW
from B. stearothermophilus) with the hot dog fold form
tetramers of type TA similar to that of 4HBT-I. However,
the sequences of both the subfamilies are quite different.
Asp20 has been identified as the catalytic residue in the
case of YbaW from X. campestris (PDB code: 2FUJ) which
is conserved among all the other hypothetical proteins of
this subfamily. This residue occupies the same position as
His133 of Plasmodium falciparum FabZ enzyme (PDB
code: 1Z6B). We have also seen a Glu/Asp residue in the
consensus sequence (see Additional file 2) similar to
Glu147 of PfFabZ.

motif of this subfamily – the overhanging segment is highlighted.

5. FapR subfamily
FapR is a transcriptional repressor of gene expression
involved in Type II fatty acid biosynthesis and phospholipid biosynthesis in many gram-positive organisms [41].
It is highly conserved and acts as a negative regulator by
binding to a consensus promoter sequence of fap regulon.
Malonyl-CoA, an intermediate in the lipid biosynthetic
pathway, regulates FapR. FapR contains a hot dog domain
to accommodate malonyl-CoA and an additional helixturn-helix motif at the N-terminus for DNA binding [2].
Recently reported crystal structures (Fig. 8) of the effector
binding domain of the FapR from B. subtilis (PDB code:
2F3X[41]) have revealed that binding of malonyl-CoA
induces significant structural changes in the three loops at
the active site tunnel converting the open ligand binding
groove into a long tunnel where the effector molecule
binds. These conformational changes induced by ligand
binding constrain the flexibility of a linker helix that con-

nects the helix-turn-helix motif to the core and thus regulate transcription. A majority of hot dog fold proteins have
catalytic functions, with rare exceptions such as FapR
which has lost enzymatic action but plays a regulatory
role.
6. Acetyltransferases
The crystal structures of three hypothetical proteins (PDB
codes: 1T82 from S. oneidensis, 1SH8 from P. aeruginosa,
and 1YOC from P. aeruginosa) were found to be
homodimers. These proteins share 27%, 38% and 34%
sequence identity, respectively with the putative acetyltransferase YiiD from E. coli. However, the consensus
sequence motif is not well conserved in these proteins. A
glutamate residue in 1SH8 and 1YOC (see Additional file
2) has been identified as the catalytic residue by structural
superpositions. However, the corresponding one is a threonine in 1T82.

Other proteins with the hot dog fold
Other three subfamilies namely, CBS-associated, MSCP
and AMP binding subfamilies [2] do not have representative crystal structures. On the other hand, two hypothetical proteins from T. thermophilus (PDB code: 2CWZ) and
T. maritime (PDB code: 2Q78) possess the hot dog fold,
but it was not possible to assign a subfamily to these proteins as they do not have any of the consensus sequence
motifs of the known subfamilies. These proteins form a
dimer of hot dogs. In addition, they have a two stranded
β-sheet towards the N-terminus and a long helix towards
the C-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis also shows that
these proteins group together but do not cluster with any
of the subfamilies. This might be a representative member
of an unexplored subfamily of hot dog fold proteins. The
yeast protein, a member of Phenazine biosynthesis, PhzF
(PDB code: 1YM5[42]) has a kinked double hot dog with
a similar domain structure but a domain association different from that described so far. Each hot dog subunit
contains nine β-strands around the central α-helix which
is shorter in length compared to those discussed so far.

The structure of Rv0098 from M. tuberculosis forms a new
head-to-tail hexameric association (H3) made up of trimers of dimers of hot dog fold domains (PDB code:
2PFC[43]). This enzyme has been identified as a long

Structure-based phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees were generated for monomers and
dimers with various options (neighbor-joining, minimum evolution, UPGMA) in the program MEGA [44].
Though both monomers and dimers yielded similar
results, those with dimers were more consistent, one of
which is shown in Figure 9. Though strict rules could not
be drawn, certain distinct features appear in the phylogenetic trees. In some cases, all the proteins of a subfamily
have the same quaternary structure: H1 in FabZ (1b), H2
in Acyl-CoA thioesterases (2a). All MaoC-like hydratases
(Subfamily 3) cluster together with individual branches
corresponding to different quaternary structures. All the
TA type of tetramers group together though they belong to
different subfamilies: YbgC (2c), YbaW (4) and 4HBT-I
(2e.i). The related structures DdhA are also in close proximity. The TB type of tetramers are observed in subfamilies TesB-like thioesterase (2b), 4HBT-II (2e.ii) and
PaaI (2f) which occur on neigbouring branches of the
phylogenetic tree but are interspersed with a few dimers.
This phylogenetic analysis further validates the functional
annotation of the hypothetical proteins as they group into
the respective subfamilies.
CoA binding and catalytic sites
Various substituents of acyl-CoA serve as substrates for
most of the hot dog fold binding proteins. There are 12
crystal structures of various hot dog fold proteins complexed with different CoA molecules. The CoA molecule
binds to the hot dog fold proteins in two different binding
modes. In both cases, CoA binds near the active site in a
curved conformation with the groups substituted at the 4'phosphopantetheine arm located in the active site tunnel
(Fig. 10). The β-mercaptoethylamine and pantothenate
units are mostly solvent exposed and are stabilized by
hydrogen bonds to the backbone of the C-terminal loop
of the β-strand at the dimer interface. The major difference
in the two modes of binding is the orientation of the
nucleotide moiety. In the case of hot dog fold proteins
with quaternary associations of the type D, TA, H2, DdhA,
the 3'-phosphate interacts with the loop mentioned above
and the nucleotide interacts with the convex surface of the
curved β-sheet. In the case of hotdog fold proteins that
have a quaternary association of the type TB and DdhB due
to back to back stacking of the β-sheet, the 4'-phosphopantetheine arm winds in the opposite direction directing
the nucleotide away from the β-sheet and is more solvent
exposed. Within the TB mode of quaternary association,
the 4HBT-II subfamily proteins show all site reactivity,

while in PaaI from T. thermophilus half the site reactivity
has been reported [23].
A structural comparison of the catalytic residues of various
enzymes with those (Glu147 and His133) of FabZ of P.
falciparum (PDB code: 1Z6B) revealed that while the catalytic sites are located in the same region, there is considerable variation in their architecture and catalytic residues as
shown in Table 1. All H2-type hexamers of subfamily 2a
have only one catalytic residue, Asp, similar to Glu147.
One catalytic residue (Asp/Glu) similar to Glu147 of FabZ
is present in all the enzymes which form TB-type tetramers, with additional Thr and Gln in one of the families. In
TA-type tetramers, an Asp residue occupies the same position as His133 of FabZ. In subfamily 3, which shows a
variety of oligomeric structures, the His residue is conserved but the position of the second catalytic Asp residue
is slightly different from that of Glu147 of FabZ. Thus it
appears that different types of active site architecture exist
for different classes of hot dog fold proteins (subfamily 1,
subfamily 2a, subfamily 3, all TA and all TB). These classes
cluster together in the phylogenetic tree as well.
Highly divergent sequences lead to similar structures
The present analysis shows correlations between the oligomerization, function and sequence of proteins with the

hot dog fold (see Additional file 1, 2 and Figure 9). At the
subunit level, the proteins possess highly divergent
sequences but adopt a similar fold. A detailed comparison
of these proteins revealed conserved hydrophobic interactions between the residues from the central helix and the
various parts of the curved β-sheet. Though the residues
involved in these interactions are from different parts of
the sequence in different proteins, the interactions are
structurally conserved and hence form the driving force
for the formation of the hot dog fold.
Ligand and pH induced Structural Changes
Two of the 64 proteins discussed in this analysis show
structural changes upon ligand binding. In the case of T.
thermophilus PaaI (PDB code: 1J1Y) protein a small rotaton of 2° in one of the dimers of the TB tetramer results in
negative co-operativity and an asymmetric induced fit
mechanism inducing half of the sites reactivity. In the case
of B. subtilis FapR (PDB code: 2F3X), upon ligand binding,
three flexible loops become ordered, a substrate binding
tunnel is formed leading to conformational changes in
the helix-turn-helix motif resulting in the impairment of
DNA binding.

The third enzyme in which structural changes have been
observed is FabZ of P. falciparum (PDB codes: 1Z6B

&1ZHG). As reported earlier [6], the two cis peptide bonds
in the active site loops of the active hexameric FabZ molecule flip to trans peptide bonds, leading to large conformational changes in the active site loops, by which the
architecture of the catalytic site drastically changes making
it incapable of binding to the substrate (Fig. 11). In addition, the hexamer dissociates into inactive dimers as the
changes affect the loops at the hexamer interfaces. Extensive Dynamic Light Scattering and gel filtration studies
showed that these transitions are triggered by pH changes.

quaternary structure and active site direct the mode of
association and substrate specificity. Different modes of
quaternary association were observed in the MaoC subfamily where the consensus sequence motif at the interface varies considerably. Double hot dog domains might
have evolved by gene duplication to accommodate bulky
substrates and to regulate activity by the asymmetric
induced fit mechanism. It appears to be a case of directed
divergent evolution where sequences changed substantially to design various types of quaternary association to
carry out different functions with the same fold.

Conclusion
As a extension of the analysis of the hot dog fold present
in the structure of the enzyme FabZ of P. falciparum that
we determined [6], we probed the nature of this fold
present in other proteins as well. Our analysis led to the
identification of the probable functions of the hypothetical proteins containing the hot dog fold through detailed
structural comparisons and identification of sequence
motifs. Our analysis also demonstrates that quaternary
association and function are related in certain cases. The
consensus sequence motifs localized to the interface of

Methods
Functional annotation of hot dog fold proteins
All non-redundant crystal structures containing the hot
dog fold in the PDB were identified using the DALI server
hosted by the EMBL-EBI [45] using a dimer of FabZ from
P. falciparum (PDB code: 1Z6B) as a search model. The
sequence of one representative structure from each subfamily obtained from the DALI search was submitted to
the Blastp server of NCBI [46] and a search for homologues in the PDB was carried out which resulted in the

identification of all the structures with the hot dog fold
within the subfamilies. A total of 64 non-redundant crystal structures were considered for the present analysis. Out
of these structures, more than forty are from various structural genomics programs and have not been biochemically characterized so far. We attempted to assign
functions to these proteins based on sequence and structural analysis. These crystal structures were grouped into
respective subfamilies according to the presence of consensus sequence motifs [2] and available biochemical
information. For the structures where the consensus
sequences were not strictly followed, homologous proteins were picked up from the Swissprot database using
the BLAST server. The consensus sequence motifs could be
readily identified in these homologous proteins and these
were used to assign the function. The crystal structures
were visually examined in PyMOL [DeLano Scientific
LLC] to identify the repeating structural unit. The possible
quaternary association was identified by displaying the
symmetry-related molecules and was further confirmed
by examining the buried surface areas using the server
MSDpisa [47]. For the hypothetical proteins classified
into structurally and functionally characterized subfamilies, the functional annotation was confirmed by the
similarities in the mode of quaternary association and
structural conservation of the active site architecture. Pairwise structural superposition of the monomers and dimers was carried out using DaliLite. These results are used to
calculate the structural distance measure (SDM) [48,49].
SDM values are calculated based on structural superposition and thus provide a better model for the evolutionary
relation of proteins with very low sequence identities.
MEGA [44] is used to generate the final phylogenetic tree
using the distance matrix of the SDM values.
