Effect of grazers and viruses on bacterial
community structure and production in two
contrasting trophic lakes
Lyria Berdjeb, Thomas Pollet, Isabelle Domaizon and Stéphan Jacquet*

Abstract
Background: Over the last 30 years, extensive studies have revealed the crucial roles played by microbes in
aquatic ecosystems. It has been shown that bacteria, viruses and protozoan grazers are dominant in terms of
abundance and biomass. The frequent interactions between these microbiological compartments are responsible
for strong trophic links from dissolved organic matter to higher trophic levels, via heterotrophic bacteria, which
form the basis for the important biogeochemical roles of microbial food webs in aquatic ecosystems. To gain a
better understanding of the interactions between bacteria, viruses and flagellates in lacustrine ecosystems, we
investigated the effect of protistan bacterivory on bacterial abundance, production and structure [determined by
16S rRNA PCR-DGGE], and viral abundance and activity of two lakes of contrasting trophic status. Four experiments
were conducted in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy and the mesotrophic Lake Bourget over two seasons (early spring
vs. summer) using a fractionation approach. In situ dark vs. light incubations were performed to consider the effects
of the different treatments in the presence and absence of phototrophic activity.
Results: The presence of grazers (i.e. < 5-μm small eukaryotes) affected viral production positively in all
experiments, and the stimulation of viral production (compared to the treatment with no eukaryotic predators) was
more variable between lakes than between seasons, with the highest value having been recorded in the
mesotrophic lake (+30%). Viral lysis and grazing activities acted additively to sustain high bacterial production in all
experiments. Nevertheless, the stimulation of bacterial production was more variable between seasons than
between lakes, with the highest values obtained in summer (+33.5% and +37.5% in Lakes Bourget and Annecy,
respectively). The presence of both predators (nanoflagellates and viruses) did not seem to have a clear influence
upon bacterial community structure according to the four experiments.
Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of a synergistic effect, i.e. the positive influence of grazers on
viral activities in sustaining (directly and indirectly) bacterial production and affecting composition, in both
oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes.

Background
The heterotrophic bacterial community is the most
important biological compartment involved in the transformation and mineralization of the organic matter in
aquatic systems. It also constitutes a key source of prey
for higher trophic levels, i.e. primarily flagellates, but

also ciliates and the metazooplankton [1,2]. Our conceptual understanding of the role of heterotrophic bacteria
in pelagic systems and in global biochemical cycles is
closely linked to our understanding of how their growth
rate, abundance, distribution and diversity are controlled
[3-5].
Different biotic and abiotic factors have been identified as players acting on the activity and composition of
the bacterial community, and resources (organic matter

and nutrients) are considered one of the main factors
controlling this community [2,6]. However, the roles of
bacterivory and viral lysis are not insignificant, and may
also strongly affect bacterial abundance, activity and
structure. Both heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) grazing and viral lysis are known to be variable causes of
bacterial mortality, and can be responsible for 10 to 60%
of daily bacterial loss in lacustrine systems [e.g. [7]]. In
addition, both processes can impact the size distribution
of bacterial communities through ‘size-selective mortality’ for flagellates [8,9] and ‘host-specificity’ for viruses
[10]. Moreover, viruses can act indirectly on bacterial
structure throughout the release of cell debris during
lysis activity (enriching the pool of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) and inorganic
nutrients) enhancing in fine growth and production of
some bacterial groups [11,12]. Indeed, whether cells are
grazed or lysed can have different ecological and biogeochemical consequences, as the implications for the matter and energy flow through the microbial web will be
very different [13,14]. Typically, high rates of viral cell
lysis may generate a recycling of nutrients and organic
matter at the base of the food web and therefore, less
carbon and nutrients may reach higher trophic levels, a
process referred to as the viral shunt [13,14]. In contrast, if bacteria are grazed by flagellates, nutrients and
energy can reach higher trophic levels via the connection between the microbial loop and the classical food
chain [15]. Thus, these processes can significantly influence the production of dissolved organic carbon and the
recycling of nutrients [14,16] and can impact/modify
not only bacterial diversity [9,17] but also the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning [18].
A few studies have investigated the individual effects
of flagellates or viruses on bacterial communities in
terms of abundance, production and diversity (e.g.
[7,10,19,20]). However, their combined effects on bacteria, and the comparison between individual and combined effects are still limited [18,21,22]. According to
these studies, both viral lysis and protistan bacterivory
may act additively to reduce bacterial production and
sustain diversity, which could explain the less pronounced blooming species in heterotrophic bacterioplankton than in phytoplankton [22]. However, the
opposite effect has also been reported [23]. Moreover,
comparisons of the combined effects of viruses and flagellates on the bacterial community according to the
trophic status of aquatic systems are scarce and until
now, no information has been made available for lacustrine systems. To the best of our knowledge, Zhang et
al. [22] are the only authors who have investigated these
effects taking into account a trophic range within a
coastal ecosystem, and the same trend was highlighted
[22]. According to these authors, a shift of predator

control mechanisms from flagellates in oligotrophic systems to viruses in eutrophic systems could explain the
results.
In this study, we collected samples from two perialpine lakes (Annecy and Bourget) with substantial differences in their trophic state (oligo- vs. mesotrophic,
respectively) and we developed treatments with either
individual or combined predators of the bacterial community using a fractionation approach (i.e. a physical
separation of virus-bacteria and the small eukaryotes).
Our main goal was to examine the separated and combined effect of viruses, grazers and small autotrophs (<
5 μm) on the bacterial abundance, production and
structure, and to compare it in different environmental
conditions. Since the importance of both predators (flagellates and viruses) as potential controlling forces of
the bacterial community may display seasonal variations
in these lakes [7,8,24], this study was carried out at two
contrasting periods (early-spring vs. summer), characterized by substantial differences in both the dynamics and
structure of microbial communities and environmental
conditions [8,25].
Our main findings are that both viral lysis and flagellated bacterivory act additively to sustain bacterial production, probably through a cascading effect from
grazer-mediated resource enrichment, whereas their
effects on the bacterial community structure remain
more subtle. On the whole, the combined effects of
viruses and flagellates showed the same trend in both
lakes Annecy and Bourget.

Initial conditions
In situ characteristics of the study sites

Lake Bourget is an elongated and north-south oriented
lake situated in the western edge of the Alps (length 18
km; width 3.5 km; area 44 km2; volume 3.5 × 109 m3;
altitude 231 m; maximum depth 147 m; mean depth 80
m; residence time 8.5 years). Lake Annecy is located in
the eastern part of France, at a distance of approx. 50
km from the former, (length 14.6 km; width 3.2 km;
area 28 km2; volume 1.2 × 109 m3; altitude 447 m; maximum depth of 65 m; mean depth 41 m; residence time
3.8 years). From the end of March to mid-July (i.e. periods during which experiments were conducted), in situ
temperatures of the two study sites varied between 6.2°
C and 20.4°C, while the dissolved oxygen varied more
modestly, between 9.7 and 11.7 mg l-1 (Table 1). Differences in the concentration of nutrients (NO3, NH4 and
Ptot) between Lake Annecy and Lake Bourget were
principally recorded during the early spring experiments
(LA1 and LB1, respectively), with values twice to threetimes higher in Lake Bourget (LB1) than in Lake Annecy
(LA1) (Table 1). Chl a concentration was relatively low

(i.e. < 2.8 μg l -1) for the four experiments (LA1, LA2,
LB1 and LB2). The abundance of heterotrophic bacteria
varied between 1.2 and 3.5 × 10 6 cell ml -1 , viruses
between 3.7 and 15 × 10 7 virus ml -1 , heterotrophic
nanoflagellates (HNF) between 2.6 and 7.6 × 102 cell
ml-1, pigmented nanoflagellates (PNF) between 1.4 and
18 × 102 cell ml-1, and picocyanobacteria between 2 and
15 × 104 cell ml-1. These parameters were significantly
different (ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 12) between the four
experiments (LA1, LA2, LB1 and LB2), indicating distinct biological characteristics at initial sampling. Seasonal difference in the picocyanobacterial abundance was
monitored (ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 6) in both lakes
(Annecy vs. Bourget), with values 1.6- to two-times
higher in summer (LA2 and LB2) than in early spring
(LA1 and LB1). HNF and PNF abundances were significantly higher in Lake Annecy than in Lake Bourget
(ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 12, Table 1). In contrast, viral
abundances were always lower in the oligotrophic Lake
Annecy.
Conditions in experimental bottles - Effect of filtration

The < 5-μm prefiltration removed a relatively small fraction of both HNF and PNF (less than 20%), whereas the
< 1.6-μm filtration removed, as expected, all of them

(Table 2). At the start of the experiments, in VF
(Viruses+Bacteria+Flagellates) and VFA (Viruses+Bacteria+Flagellates+Autotrophs) treatments, HNF abundances varied between 2.5 × 102 cell ml-1 (LB) and 6.5 ×
102 cell ml-1 (LA), PNF between 1.1 × 102 cell ml-1 (LB)
and 14.4 × 10 2 cell ml -1 (LA), and picocyanobacteria
between 0.7 × 104 cell ml-1 (LB) and 11.2 × 104 cell ml-1
(LA) corresponding to 52 to 72% of in situ abundances.
Comparatively, a small fraction of the picocyanobacterial
community passed through the < 1.6-μm filter and only
0.1 and 0.8 × 104 cell ml-1 were recorded in treatment
V (only bacteria and viruses), i.e. 1 to 5% of in situ
abundance (Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, filtration
through 1.6 μm resulted in a small loss of bacterial and
viral abundances (less than 14% and 20%, respectively)
whereas after 5-μm filtration, loss never exceeded 4%
for heterotrophic bacteria and 13% for viruses. At the
beginning of the incubation, heterotrophic bacteria and
viral abundances, in the four treatments of all experiments varied between 9.4 × 105 and 33.5 × 105 cell ml-1
and between 2.9 × 107 and 13.4 × 107 virus ml-1, respectively (Figure 1). Overall, we succeeded in obtaining
incubations with strongly contrasting predator pressure
(with or without) and, with negligible loss to the abundances of both bacteria and viruses, when compared to
in situ conditions.
Effect of treatments on viral abundance and production

Viral abundance only varied by a small degree (between
2.9 × 10 7 and 4.6 × 10 7 virus ml -1 ) in Lake Annecy,
while it varied greatly in Lake Bourget particularly during the LB2 experiment (Figure 1). In both LA1 and
LA2 experiments, the temporal trend of viral abundance
revealed different patterns according to the treatment:
viral abundance increased in VF and V treatment, while
in the VFA treatment no significant evolution (ANOVA,
P > 0.05, n = 9) was recorded (Figure 1). In Lake Bourget, viral abundance increased during the four days of
incubation in all treatments, except in treatment V of
the LB1 experiment. At the end of incubation, the
increase in viral abundance in VF and VFA was significantly higher than in treatment V (ANOVA, P < 0.01, n
= 9) in LA1 (+39% and +16%, respectively), LB1 (+34%
and +27%, respectively) and LB2 (+47% and +61%,
respectively) (Figure 2D). However, the opposite was
true for LA2 (-6%, ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 9). The stimulation of viral abundance was 3-fold higher in Lake
Bourget (average +29%) than in Lake Annecy (average
+8%) (t test, n = 24, P < 0.001) and significantly different between seasons for each lake (t test, n = 12,
p < 0.01).
Similarly to viral abundance, viral production
increased without exception from the beginning to the
end of the experiments, particularly in VFA and VF

Viral production varied between a minimum of 3.2 ×
105 virus ml-1 h-1 (LA2) and a maximum of 4.7 × 10 6
virus ml-1 h-1 (LB2) (Figure 3), which corresponded to
3.5 × 105 and 47.4 × 105 cells lysed ml-1 d-1, respectively
(Table 3). Viral production in VFA and VF were, in
most cases, significantly different (ANOVA, P < 0.001, n
= 18), over the course of the incubation, being on average 21% higher (range 7-53%) than in V treatments in
both lakes (Figure 2E). Stimulation of viral production
seemed to be significantly higher (t test, P < 0.0001, n =
24) in Lake Bourget (average +30%) than in Lake
Annecy (average +11%), while no significant seasonal
differences (t test, P > 0.05, n = 12) were recorded for
either lake.
Effects of treatments on bacterial abundance, production
and mortality

Bacterial abundance increased throughout the experiments, particularly during the LB2 experiment (Figure
1). Concentrations were significantly higher in VFA and
VF than in treatment V (ANOVA, P < 0.05, n = 18).
Concentrations in VFA and VF were in most cases similar in Lake Annecy, when compared to each other
(ANOVA, P > 0.05, n = 18), in contrast to the significant differences observed in the samples issued from
Lake Bourget, with higher bacterial abundance in treatment VFA than VF. At the end of the incubation, the
increase in bacterial abundance (comparison of

treatments V and both VF and VFA between day 0 and
day 4) in treatment VFA was significantly higher than in
treatment V (ANOVA, P < 0.01, n = 9) (Figure 2A). In
the four experiments, bacterial abundance was significantly higher (by up to 9% to 53%) (t test, P < 0.05) in
treatment VFA than in V. In the VF treatment, bacterial
abundance was significantly higher (t test, P < 0.05) in
LA2 (up to 35%), LB1 (up to 30%) and LB2 (up to 19%)
than in treatment V. No significant difference was
observed in LA1 (t test, P>0.8). Stimulation of bacterial
abundance was significantly different between lakes (t
test, P < 0.001, n = 24) (+38% in Lake Bourget and
+14% in Lake Annecy) and between seasons with highest values measured in summer (+59% in Lake Bourget
and +26% in Lake Annecy).
During the incubation period, bacterial production
fluctuated between 0.5 and 0.9 μgC l-1 h-1 in LA1, 0.8
and 2.3 μgC l-1 h -1 in LA2, 1.2 and 3.1 μgC l -1 h -1 in
LB1 and between 3.2 and 7.8 μgC l-1 h-1 in LB2 (Figure
3). Following bacterial abundance evolution, a significant
increase in the bacterial production (ANOVA, P > 0.05,
n = 27) was also recorded throughout the period of
incubation. For both lakes, bacterial production was
often higher in treatment V than in both VFA and VF
during the early spring experiments (LA1 and LB1).
After 96 h of incubation, the stimulation of bacterial
production (comparison of variation of the viruses treatment (V) and the grazers treatments (VFA and VF)) was
observed in all experiments and averaged 27% in

observed in VFA during the LB2 experiment (51%).
Overall, the bacterial production was significantly different (ANOVA, P < 0.001, n = 27) between the three
treatments for the four experiments, with the highest
values observed in most cases in VFA and VF (Figures 2
and 3). In contrast to the bacterial abundance, a significant difference in the stimulation of bacterial production
was only noted between seasons (t test, P < 0.001, n =

(+33.5% and +37.5% for Lake Bourget and Lake Annecy,
respectively).
Bacterial growth rate fluctuated between 0.1 and 0.7
d -1 after either 48 h or 96 h of incubation (Table 3),
with the lowest values recorded during early spring
experiments (LA1 and LB1). The presence of flagellates
did not induce a reduction of bacterial abundance and
the estimation of bacterial loss rates over time generally led to negative values, showing enhanced bacterial
growth. In Lake Annecy, this positive impact on bacterial growth was only significant in the LA2

observed in both VF (-0.1 d -1 ) and VFA (-0.1 d -1 ). In
Lake Bourget, the two experiments (LB1 and LB2)
showed the same effect on bacterial growth, with the
highest values observed in VFA treatment (-0.2 d -1 ,
ANOVA, P < 0.001, n = 6).
Bacterial mortality due to viral lysis activity was estimated to range between 0.2 d -1 and 2.2 d -1 (Table 3)
with the highest values obtained during summer experiments (LA2 and LB2). Differences between V and VFA/
VF treatments indicated a significant increase in the
lysis mortality rate after 48 h incubation in both LB1
(+28%) and LB2 (+43%) and this enhancement was
maintained until the end (96 h) (Figure 2C). In LA1 and
LA2, a significant difference between V and the other
treatments was observed at the end of incubation,
accompanied with an increase in lysis mortality rate in
LA1 (+11%), and a decrease in LA2 (-7%).
Effects of treatments on the bacterial community
structure

Figure 4 shows the PCR-DGGE patterns of the bacterial
community structure at the start and end of incubation
for the three treatments and the four experiments.
Between 17 and 26 bands were found in treatment V,
between 18 and 28 in VF and between 18 and 27 in VFA
(Figure 4 and Table 4). The number of common bands
found in the three treatments for each experiment

represented between 24 and 49% (average 40.5%, Table 4).
Between 0 and 3 bands (average 3.8%) per experiment
were specific to V. Between 0 and 2 bands (average 2.3%)
and between 1 and 4 (average 6.5%) bands were specific to
VF and VFA, respectively (Table 4).
Among the eight sequenced bands, B2 (excised from
the LA1 experiment) was present in all treatments.
From this band, ten sequences out of 12 obtained were
related to the genus Curvibacter (class of b-proteobacteria), the two other sequences corresponding to the
genus Burkholderidia (class of b-proteobacteria) (Table
5). Three other sequenced bands were visible in all
treatments but they increased significantly in intensity
at the end of incubation (both B3 and B4 in V final of
LA1, B8 in VFfinal of LB2). These three excised bands
were related to the phylum Actinobacteria (with B3
affiliated to the clade acI) (Figure 4 and Table 5).
Finally, the three last bands chosen to be sequenced
appeared (B5 in Vfinal and VFfinal of LA2) or disappeared
(both B6 and B7 in VFAfinal of LB1) at the end of incubation (Figure 4). These ones were all affiliated to the
phylum Actinobacteria (as were 85% of the sequenced
DGGE bands). Note that the excised band B1 (LA1
experiment), related to the phylum Cyanobacteria
(Table 5), disappeared at the end of the incubation in
both VF and V treatments.
Cluster analyses based on quantification of the band
position and intensity (Figure 5) showed that, for each

In order to study the influence of both predation pressure and the autotrophic activity on bacterial community of Lakes Annecy and Bourget, we carried out a
fractioning approach and performed incubation in either
darkness or ambient light. The originality and strength
of this study comes from the fact that such experiments
were conducted (i) in two ecosystems with either oligotrophic or mesotrophic status and (ii) at two distinct
periods of the year (i.e. early-spring and summer) where
microbial planktonic dynamics and composition are
likely to display clear differences [8,24,25]. Although the
use of microcosms may introduce some bias into the
development of microbial communities compared with
those occurring naturally in the field (due to

lake, the bacterial community structure was clearly different according to the period (early spring/summer)
(Figure 5). In lake Annecy, different responses could be
observed following our manipulations: In spring, the
effect of time (separation between t0 and tf, whatever
the planktonic size fraction) clearly affected the bacterial
structure. In summer, the differences in the structure
induced by the size fractionation were the strongest, and
sample discrimination was clearly linked to the fractionation (1.6 vs. 5 μm). Similar patterns were obtained for
Lake Bourget in summer. Finally, treatment VFA was
highly divergent from V and VF (between 42% and 58%
of similarity) during the early spring experiment for
Lake Bourget.

confinement and handling effects), these experimental
tools are still very useful for investigating how processes
such as mortality factors induce temporal variation in
bacterial dynamics, structure and activity [26]. Incubation time (4 days) coupled with the volume of microcosms (2.5 L) considered in this study have previously
been used successfully in other experimental studies
[18,22]. We assumed that our design was thus realistic
enough compared to the generation time of microorganisms and aimed to obtain significant changes in bacterial
and viral activity [27]. A comparison of virus and flagellate abundances at the onset of the experiments with in
situ conditions and among treatments with different
viral and flagellate effects was successful. However, the

experimental protocol resulted in a reduction of HNF at
the start of the experiment and we thus might have
underestimated their influence. Clear effects of HNF
were observed at the end of the experiment, when flagellate abundance was about twice as high as in situ
(Tables 1 and 2).
Grazing effect on viral activity

According to the model of Miki and Yamamura [28],
grazers should reduce the role of the viral loop. As viral
production was higher in VF and VFA treatments than
in V in most cases, particularly after 48 h incubation,
our results instead suggested a stimulation of viral activity in the presence of grazers. Such a stimulation of viral

Berdjeb et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/88

production by the presence of small eukaryotes (grazers)
was observed in all experiments for the two lakes. These
results corroborate the findings of Jacquet et al. [27]
who observed a clear and positive relationship between
flagellate concentration and VIBM (virus-induced bacterial mortality) in Lake Bourget (r = 0.99, P < 0.05) at
three different periods of the year (winter, spring and
summer), suggesting a synergistic cooperation between
grazer and virus activity. Our new results extend the
occurrence of this process at other periods of the year
and in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy. Similar beneficial
effects of protozoan grazing on viruses have been
reported in various lacustrine systems with different
trophic statuses [21,23,26]. This means that the trophic
status cannot be ‘used’ as an environmental factor to
change the balance between positive and negative effects
of flagellates on viruses [29], and it is likely that there
are probably different processes involved in enhancing
viral activities in response to grazing activity [21].
To the best of our knowledge, Šimek et al. [19] were
first to suggest that protozoan grazing may influence
and increase viral lysis. From that time, other studies
reported such a synergistic effect in contrast to freshwater systems [21,26,27]. Nevertheless, an antagonistic
interaction between these two compartments was also
noted elsewhere [30,31]. Mechanisms by which HNF
affect viral activity are still unclear and many hypotheses
have been proposed to explain such a cooperative interaction (reviewed by Miki and Jacquet [29]). In brief,
grazing activity could stimulate bacterial growth rates,
by releasing organic and inorganic nutrients. Higher
bacterial growth rates might be associated with
enhanced receptor formation on cell surface which may
result in a greater chance of phage attachment and in
fine higher infection frequencies. Thus, grazer stimulation of viral proliferation could occur through cascading
effects from grazer-mediated resource enrichment [23].
We observed, in this study, a strong stimulation of bacterial production in treatments with grazers which may
corroborate this assumption in both lakes. A link
between infection and host production has been
reported previously (summarized in Weinbauer [11])
and, recently, experimental studies showed that viruses
may preferentially lyse active cells [18,32]. Our results
showed that autotrophic activity contributed to this stimulation, mainly in the early summer experiment (for
both lakes), while heterotrophic flagellates were always
involved in this positive feedback. A shift in the bacterial
community structure could also contribute to the synergistic interaction observed in this study. According to
Weinbauer et al. [33], grazing can favour species which
are capable of rapid growth and resistant to grazing,
which may stimulate viral infection. Our results also
seemed to support this hypothesis since both high

Page 11 of 18

bacterial production and specific bands were only
observed in treatments VF and VFA.
Stimulation of viral production was much more variable between lakes than between seasons and it was
clearly higher in Lake Bourget. This suggests that environmental conditions encountered in the mesotrophic
system might promote higher viral activity compared to
more oligotrophic conditions. This hypothesis agrees
with Lymer et al. [34] or Pradeep and Sime-Ngando
[26] who observed, during a microcosm experiment, an
enhancement of both viral abundance and FIC (frequency of infected cells) in P-enriched samples as a
result of nutrient stimulation of bacterial growth, which
in turn enhanced viral activity. However, it is noteworthy here that although phosphorus concentration
was 2-fold higher in Lake Bourget than in Lake Annecy
(Table 1), no significant difference was recorded in bacterial production between the two lakes (t test, P >
0.005). Some studies have suggested that nutrient availability may have an important influence on viral life
strategies (e.g. [35,36]). As lysogenic infection is considered the most favourable method of bacterial infection
in water characterized by low bacterial abundance and
primary production, this may also explain the relatively
weak stimulation of viral production observed in Lake
Annecy compared to Lake Bourget [32].
In Lake Annecy, and in contrast to viral production,
the effects of flagellate presence on viral abundance
seemed to be highly variable between the two periods
(LA1 vs. LA2). This variation revealed viral abundance
stimulation in early-spring (LA1) and repression in summer (LA2), for both treatments (VFA and VF). This
result could suggest a direct grazing of flagellates on
viruses during summer. Virivory by flagellates has been
previously reported [37,38] and according to Domaizon
et al. [39], all flagellates do not act similarly because of
large differences between taxon-specifc ingestion rates.
During our study, heterotrophic flagellates were mainly
represented by Oikomonas (45 and 48% during LA1 and
LA2, respectively). Also, the grazing impact of flagellates
on viruses has always been reported to be relatively low,
resulting in < 4% loss [37,38]. Hence, direct grazing of
flagellates on viruses was unlikely to explain the repression of viral abundance in LA2. Other factors should be
invoked [36] and would need further investigation.
Effect of both flagellates and viruses on bacterial activity

Higher bacterial production in both VF and VFA treatments than V suggested that grazers and viruses acted
additively to sustain (directly or indirectly) bacterial
activity in Lake Annecy and Lake Bourget. Such bacterial growth and activity stimulation in the presence of
grazers and viruses has been previously reported in the
oligotrophic Sep reservoir, Massif Central, France

Berdjeb et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/88

[23,26]. However, the control and reduction of bacterial
production by the two mortality agents have been
observed in other aquatic systems [18,21,22]. Such variability in possible responses could be due to the initial
bacterial community composition and environmental
conditions.
The increase in bacterial production with the presence
of both predators (flagellates and viruses) could be
explained by the fact that grazing activity and viral lysis
are likely to release inorganic and organic nutrients
which may stimulate bacterial activity. Obviously, the
absence of direct measurements of grazing rates of flagellates on heterotrophic bacteria communities, for
instance using fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) [40],
prevented us from drawing firm conclusions about the
grazing pressure of HNF on bacteria and our results
should be considered in light of that. However, it has
been suggested that a minimal proportion of 1,000 heterotrophic bacteria for one heterotrophic flagellate is
characteristic of microbial food webs in which flagellates
preferentially consume bacteria [39,41,42]. The value for
this ratio was higher than 1,000 in each treatment (VFA
vs. VF) and for each experiment (early spring vs. summer). Indeed it varied between 1,632 and 3,866 bacteria
per flagellate in Lake Annecy (mean value: 2,795), and
between 2,619 and 8,857 in Lake Bourget (mean value:
5899), suggesting that heterotrophic bacteria were abundant enough to support the development of the heterotrophic flagellates that were present.
Seasonal variability in the stimulation of bacterial production seemed to be more important than the trophic
status variability, with highest mean values recorded in
summer (+33.5% and +37.5% in Lakes Bourget and
Annecy, respectively), a period which corresponds to
low total phosphorus conditions and high temperature
in surface waters (Table 1). Thus, the input of nutrient
resources by viral and grazing activities, under such
summer conditions, is likely to stimulate the bacterial
community much more than under the cold early-spring
conditions (temperature = 6-7°C). Moreover, Thomas et
al. [32] observed that the abundance of HDNA (high
nucleic acid containing bacteria) is lower in spring than
in summer in Lake Bourget (less than 40% of the total
bacterial abundance), and this group is considered to be
more active in comparison to LDNA (low nucleic acid
bacteria) [43,44]. This could also explain the low stimulation of bacterial production in early spring compared
to that in summer.
For most experiments (LA1, LB1 and LB2), the stimulation of bacterial production, at the end of experiments,
was much higher in VFA than in the VF treatment
(Figure 4) which could be attributed to an increase in
substrate availability and regenerated nutrients, resulting
from grazing pressure of flagellates on both heterotrophic

Page 12 of 18

bacteria and autotrophic communities, in treatment VFA
[45,46]. Nevertheless, the opposite situation was observed
in Lake Annecy during the summer period (LA2 experiment) suggesting weaker competition by the bacterial
community for nutrient resources in the presence of
autotrophs, at this period. As a possible explanation, the
abundance of autotrophs (represented mainly by picocyanobacteria and PNF) was indeed 2- to 4-fold higher in
summer than in early spring while bacterial abundance
was 2-fold lower (Table 1).
Impact of HNF on bacterial community structure

We are aware that the DGGE fingerprinting method
presents some bias and only reflects the microorganism
populations that are present at relatively high concentrations. For example, while Muyzer et al. [47] claimed that
the reported sensitivity of DGGE is 1% of the template
DNA, Casamayor et al. [48] reported that the number
of bands is related to the number of populations that
account for more than 0.3-0.4% of the total cell counts.
In addition, some other bias such as insufficient or preferential disruption of cells during the DNA extraction
step, amplification bias (chimera and heteroduplex formation) and band co-migration in the DGGE gel can
occur and consequently over- or underestimate the
number of bands. However, such limitations are not
specific to DGGE and may also be found in other molecular fingerprinting techniques [49]. Therefore, it must
be kept in mind that only major changes in the bacterial
community composition could be monitored using
DGGE. That is exactly what we observed in this study
as all sequenced bands belonged to Actinobacteria and
Proteobacteria, known to be the most dominant phyla
in lakes [50,51]. Thus our results have to be interpreted
with caution because the structure of some “non-dominant” phyla, non-detectable with the DGGE technique,
could have changed according to the treatments performed in this study.
We found that some bands were specific to each treatment suggesting that some bacterial phylotypes were
able to develop and thwart the predation pressure. Such
specificity has already been reported in other experimental studies [18,21,22]. Phylotypes, observed in both
VFA and VF treatments, were likely to be resistant to
both grazing and infection [21,22]. Nevertheless, the
presence of phylotypes only in VF (not in VFA) might
indicate sensitivity to the autotrophic activity as a result
of a weak ability to compete for resources. Phylotypes
only present when viruses were the exclusive mortality
agents would probably not be able to deal with the combined pressure of grazing and viral lysis [21] or were
strongly susceptible to grazing as already suggested by
Zhang et al. [22]. Finally, the appearance of bands in
both VF and VFA treatments could be due to

Berdjeb et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/88

phylotypes benefiting from the presence of predators, e.
g., via the production of DOM or by the removal of
competitors.
A few previous experimental studies have shown that
viruses can influence the presence or absence of specific
bacterial phylotypes but, typically, result in a reduction
of the number of detected phylotypes [53,54]. In contrast, we observed during the summer period an
increase in the apparent richness when viruses were the
exclusive mortality agents (i.e. the number of detectable
bands) giving support to the “killing the winner hypothesis”. The stimulation of bacterial diversity in the presence of viruses was also reported in other lacustrine
systems by Weinbauer et al. [21] and other experimental
studies performed in coastal marine systems observed
the same trend [18,22]. However, the relative stability of
the apparent richness during early spring experiments,
in treatment V, highlighted the seasonal variability of
virus effects on bacterial diversity. This high variable
impact of viruses upon bacterial community structure,
already reported by Hewson and Fuhrman [54], could
suggest the influence of stochastic processes.
Since no decrease in the number of bands was
observed in either treatment VF or VFA, our result
could not support the hypothesis of Miki and Yamamura [28] according to whom grazing on infected cells
“Kills the killer of the winner” and thus reduces bacterial
species richness. In some cases, the combined effect of
viruses and flagellates on bacterial fingerprint diversity
was more consistent than the effect of viruses alone,
suggesting that both predators acted additively to sustain apparent richness. According to Zhang et al. [22]
the ‘killing the winner’ hypothesis is mediated by both
predators and not just by one type of predator (viruses).
Thus, all predators (viruses and flagellates) could act
additively in controlling the winners of the competition
for resources and caused an increase in detectable phylotypes. In addition, stimulation of bacterial production
and related viral lysis also suggested input of nutrients
and substrates from grazing and lysis activities which
may decrease the competition pressure within bacterial
community, thereby increasing the competitiveness of
the minor phylotypes [23].
The effect of both predators on the bacterial diversity
was not apparent in all experiments, suggesting more
variability and complexity in the interactions between
bacterial diversity, viruses and grazers than hitherto
assumed. Diverse patterns between predators and bacterial diversity were reported in other studies [18,19,55].
Such variability could be explained by the change in the
balance between bacterial production and protistan
grazing [56] or to chaotic behaviour due to competition
among predators for the same prey [28]. Overall, previous work performed in both Lakes Annecy and

Page 13 of 18

Bourget, indicated that the strong complexity of the
combined physico-chemical and biological parameters
(with a larger effect of abiotic factors) is mainly responsible for the evolution of the bacterial community structure [57].

Conclusion
Many forms of interaction exist between the various
components of the microbial loop including the viruses.
Our results highlight that viruses and flagellated grazers
are likely to act together, synergistically, on bacterial
activity and community structure. Even at the community level, interactions between bacterioplankton, viruses
and grazers are thus much more complex than hitherto
assumed. More than ever, additional studies are needed
to fully assess the factors responsible for the variability
in the interactions between grazers, bacteria and viruses,
especially in freshwater ecosystems, as well as their ecological significance for the microbial community structure/role and whole ecosystem functioning.
Methods
Study sites and sampling

Water samples were collected from the two largest natural lakes in France. For the purpose of this study, 40
litres of water samples were collected near the surface
(i.e. 2 m) using a water pump and large tubing on 26
March and 10 July 2007 in Lake Annecy (referred to
later as LA1 and LA2, respectively) and on 02 April and
17 July 2007 in Lake Bourget (i.e. LB1 and LB2). In this
way, for each period, samples were separated by only
one week between the two lakes.
Physicochemical variables

Total organic carbon (TOC) and nutrient concentrations
(NH 4, NO3 , PO4, total phosphorus) were measured at
each station and date, according to the standard French
protocols AFNOR (details available at http://www.dijon.
inra.fr/thonon/les_plateaux_techniques/le_laboratoire_de_physico_chimie). A conductivity-temperature-depth
measuring device (CTD SEABIRD SAB 19 Seacat profiler) and a Chlorophyll fluorescence Fluoroprobe (BBE
Moaldenke, Germany) were used to obtain vertical profiles of water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence.
Size fractionation approach

Immediately after sampling, samples were pre-filtered
through a 60-μm mesh screen, followed by pre-filtration
through Nucleopore membranes (< 5-μm pore size)
under low differential pressure (< 50 mm Hg) in order
to exclude large eukaryotes. We could thus focus our
attention on the small eukaryotes, autotrophic and heterotrophic prokaryotes and viruses. A third of the pre-

Berdjeb et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/88

filtered sample was then filtered through 1.6-μm pore
size to yield a total free-living bacteria and ‘grazer-free’
containing fraction, which was confirmed by detailed
microscopic examination at the beginning and at the
end of the experiments. The remaining pre-filtred sample was divided into two parts; one of them was kept in
a black box (simulating darkness) to inhibit the autotrophic activity. Therefore, three combinations of treatments were performed: the treatment ‘Viruses +
Bacteria + heterotrophic Flagellates (grazers) + Autotrophs’ (fraction < 5 μm, referred to as VFA); the treatment ‘Viruses + Bacteria + Flagellates (grazers)’ (fraction
< 5 μm put into a black box; VF) and finally the treatment ‘Viruses + Bacteria’, i.e. without the flagellates and
the autotrophic community (fraction < 1.6 μm, referred
as V).
Samples so transformed were divided into triplicates
and poured into 2.5 L Nalgene transparent carboys,
which had been previously cleaned with 1.2 N HCl and
rinsed three times with Milli-Q and filtered lake water.
All the bottles were incubated in the lake at 2 m depth
for four complete days. Subsamples were taken from
each triplicate at day 0, 2 and 4 to assess microbial
abundances and activities, and at day 0 and 4 for the
analysis of the bacterial community diversity.
Flow cytometry (FCM) sample analysis

We used a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.) equipped with an aircooled laser providing 15 mW at 488 nm with the standard filter set-up. Only a few hours after sampling (less
than 4 h), one millilitre of water was immediately analysed without adding any fixative or dye to analyse the
picocyanobacterial community dynamics and also to
check for the absence/presence of prokaryotic (e.g. Synechococcus) and eukaryotic autotrophic organisms in the
V treatment. Such unfixed samples, kept in darkness in
refrigerated boxes and at 4°C for a few hours before
analysis, revealed no significant changes in cell counts
while this was not true when using either formaldehyde
or glutaraldehyde (not shown). Fluorescent microbeads
(Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, U.S.A.) of 1-μm
diameter were added to each sample as an internal standard. Another 1 ml was fixed and used for bacterial and
viral counts via FCM, according to the protocol
described in Personnic et al. [25]. Briefly, viruses were
fixed with glutaraldehyde (0.5% final concentration,
grade I, Merck) for 30 min in the dark, then diluted in
0.02 μm filtered TE buffer (0.1 mM Tris-HCL and 1
mM EDTA, pH 8), and incubated with SYBR Green I
(at a final 5 × 10 -5 dilution of the commercial stock
solution; Molecular Probes), for 5 min at ambient temperature, followed by 10 min at 75°C, and then another
5 min at room temperature, prior to FCM analysis.

Heterotrophic bacterial counts were performed on samples that had also been fixed with glutaraldehyde (0.5%
final concentration) for 30 minutes, but the samples
were then diluted in 0.02 μm filtered deep-lake water
sample, and incubated with SYBR Green I (10-4 dilution
of the commercial stock solution) for 15 min [25] Listmode files were analysed using Cytowin [58].
Enumeration of flagellates

50 ml sub-samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde (1%
final concentration), stained with primuline [59] and
collected onto black polycarbonate membranes (0.8-μm
pore size). For flagellates, slides were prepared within 24
h after sampling and were stored at -25°C in darkness
to minimise the loss of autofluorescence [60]. Slides
were observed at a 1,250× magnification using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE200) under
UV light for heterotrophic nanoflagellates and, under
blue and green light for pigmented nanoflagellates.
Bacterial production

The incorporation of 3H-leucine was determined following the protocol of Kirchman [61]. For each sample, 5
sterile eppendorfs (2 ml) received 1 ml of sub-sample.
Two samples were fixed with formaldehyde (1.6% final
conc.) to serve as controls. Eppendorfs were inoculated
with known saturating 3H-Leu (80 nM final concentration, specific activity: 73 Ci.mmol-1 ) and incubated in
the dark for 2 h. Protein synthesis was stopped by the
addition of formaldehyde (1.6% final concentration).
Samples were then filtered through a 25-mm diameter,
0.22-μm pore size membrane (GTTP). The filters were
then rinsed twice with 5 ml of trichloroacetic acid
(TCA, 5% final concentration). The filters were placed
in scintillation vials, allowed to dry and solubilised with
1 ml of toluene. After adding 3 ml of the scintillation
cocktail (Hionic Fluor, Perkin Elmer), the radioactivity
was counted with a Packard Tricarb Liquid Scintillation
Analyser 1500. Bacterial production, calculated in
pmoles l-1 h-1 of 3H-Leucine incorporated into protein,
was converted in μgC l-1 h-1 following Simon and Azam
[62]: BP (μgC l-1 h-1) = Leu (mmols Leu L-1 h-1) × 131.2
× (%Leu)-1 × (C:Protein) × ID); with C:protein = 0.86
(ratio of cellular carbon to protein); %Leu = 0.073 (fraction of leucine in protein). ID = 1 (Isotopic Dilution);
131.2 = Molecular weight of the leucine.
Estimation of viral production

We used the dilution technique of Wilhelm et al. [63] in
order to estimate the viral production throughout the
experiment at day 0, 2 and 4. 50 ml of sub-samples
were diluted and mixed with 100 ml of virus-free (0.02μm pore size pre-filtered at day 0 and kept at 4°C) lake
water, and incubated in dark conditions. Triplicates

were made and incubated at in situ temperature in the
dark. One-ml sub-samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12,
18 and 24 h. Viral production rates were determined
from first-order regressions of viral abundance versus
time after correcting for the dilution of the bacterial
hosts between the samples and the natural community,
a necessary step to account for the loss of potentially
infected cells during the filtration. Viral production (VP,
virus ml-1 h-1) was calculated as proposed by Hewson
and Fuhrman [64]: VP = m × (b/B) where m is the
slope of the regression line, b the concentration of bacteria after dilution, and B the concentration of bacteria
prior to dilution.
We estimated the number of lysed bacteria (cell ml-1
-1
h ) during the viral lysis activity by considering an average burst size (27) previously estimated for Lake Bourget
[7,65] with the number of lysed bacteria = Viral production/Burst Size [66].
In order to show the effect of the presence of flagellates on the dynamics and activities of both heterotrophic bacteria and viruses, we calculated the
stimulation of the different parameters presented above
(both abundance and production) in treatments VF and
VFA (as proposed by Bonilla-Findji et al. [18] and
Zhang et al. [22]). The stimulation corresponds to the
difference in variation between treatments with flagellates (VFA or VF treatments) and the treatment without
flagellates (V treatment) between 0 and 48 h, and
between 48 h and 96 h, respectively. As an example, the
equation used to calculate the stimulation of bacterial
abundance in the VF treatment, between 0 and 48 h, is:
StimulationBA (%) =

BA(VFA)48
× 100 −
BA(V)48

BA(VFA)0
× 100
BA(V)0

(1)

Where BA(VFA)0 and BA(VFA)48 are the abundance of
bacteria in VFA, at the beginning and after 48 h of incubation and BA (V)0 and BA (V)48 are the abundance of
bacteria in V, at the beginning and after 48 h of
incubation.
Net growth and loss rates of bacteria

Bacterial net growth rates with bacterial predators (rb,
d -1 ) and without predators (r, d -1 ) were calculated
from the difference in abundances from day 0 to day 2
(t = 48 h) and from day 0 and day 4 (t = 96 h), assuming exponential growth. We used the equations: rb =
(ln Nbt - ln Nb0)/t and r = (ln Nt - ln N0)/t; where
N0 and Nt are the bacterial abundances (Nb0, Nbt =
with predators (VFA, VF), N0, Nt = without predators
(V)) at the beginning and after 48 h or 96 h of incubation. The loss rate of bacteria due to grazing activities
were calculated as the differences between the treatment with (VFA, VF) and without (V) predators: g = r
- rb [67].

Nucleic acid extraction, PCR and DGGE

Analysis of the bacterial community structure was
assessed using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis
(DGGE). Bacteria were harvested from approximately
250 ml water onto 47-mm diameter, 0.2-μm pore size,
polycarbonate white membrane filters (Nuclepore) after
a pre-filtration step through 2-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane filters (Nuclepore) to eliminate large
eukaryotes and filamentous cyanobacteria. The filters
were then stored at -80°C prior to nucleic acid extraction. Nucleic acid extraction was performed as described
in Dorigo et al. [68]. Molecular weight distribution and
purity of the DNA were assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by both visual comparison
with molecular weight markers in ethidium bromide
stained agarose gels (rough estimate) and by optical
density measurements using NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Such material was
then stored at -20°C until PCR amplification.
PCR reactions were carried out using the Eubacteriaspecific primer 358-GC [47] and the universal primer
907 rM [69] which amplify the variable V3 region of the
16S rRNA gene and yield a DNA fragment of ca. 550
bp. All PCR amplifications were carried out using about
30 ng of extracted DNA in a 50 μl reaction mix containing 10 × Taq reaction buffer (Eurobio), 1.5 mM MgCl2,
120 μM of each deoxynucleotide, 1 μM of each primer,
bovine serum albumin (Sigma, 0.5 mg ml-1 final concentration), and 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Eurobluetaq,
Eurobio). PCR amplification consisted of an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 52°C for 1
min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, and a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 min using a PTC100 thermocycler (MJ Research). Correct size (ca. 500 bp length) of
PCR products were determined by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis with a DNA size standard (Low DNA Mass
Ladder, GIBCO BRL).
DGGE analysis was performed on PCR fragments, as
described in Berdjeb et al. [57] using Ingenyphor U-2®
(Ingeny international) and by using a 40-80% gradient.
Since all of the replicates (more than 70) could not be
placed in the same gel, aliquots of DNA extracts from
the three replicates of each treatment were pooled, but
only after we had checked similarity in DGGE patterns
between replicates for all sampling time points. Digital
images of the gels were obtained using a Kodak DC290
camera, and were then saved for further analysis using
the Microsoft Photo Editor Software. The DGGE banding patterns were analyzed using the GelCompare II
software package (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium)
and after digitalization of the DGGE gels. Briefly,
banding patterns were first standardized with a reference pattern included in all gels. Each band was

described by its position (Y, in pixel on the image file)
and its relative intensity in the profiles (P i ) which
could be described as the ratio between the surface of
the peak (n i ) and the sum of the surfaces for all the
peaks within the profile (N).

From the DGGE gels, the bands of interest were excised,
placed in sterile water and stored at -20°C. Prior to
cloning, each excised DGGE band was subjected to a
freeze-thaw cycle and then centrifuged. DGGE fragments contained in the supernatant were used as template in a second PCR amplification performed as
described above. The resulting PCR products were
cloned with an Invitrogen cloning kit (TOPO TA cloning) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Twelve clones were randomly chosen for each band of
interest. Each clone was verified by PCR using the commercial primers M13 and finally sequenced (GATC Biotech). Sequences were then edited, aligned with
Genedoc [70] and finally checked for chimeras using
Bellerophon [71] and the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP) [72]. Sequences were finally subjected to BLAST
and the RDP database to determine the level of similarity with other 16S rRNA gene sequences available in
Genbanks.
Statistical Analysis

Differences between treatments per experiment, per
time point were tested for significance using parametric
analysis of variance (ANOVA) including post hoc test
analysis (Fisher’s protected least significant difference
test). Testing for normality and homogeneity of variance
was performed, and data transformation was done when
required (for all data compared per test). Differences
were considered significant at P value of < 0.05. We
compared the difference on the stimulation rate of
abundance and production of both viral and bacterial
communities according to the seasons (n = 12) and
trophic status (n = 24) by using paired t test.
