Abstract
Parasitic plants and their hosts have proven remarkably
adept at exchanging fragments of mitochondrial DNA.
Two recent studies provide important mechanistic
insights into the pattern, process and consequences
of horizontal gene transfer, demonstrating that genes
can be transferred in large chunks and that gene
conversion between foreign and native genes leads to
intragenic mosaicism. A model involving duplicative
horizontal gene transfer and differential gene
conversion is proposed as a hitherto unrecognized
source of genetic diversity.
Horizontal gene transfer in plants
Among the most profound biological insights gleaned
from the past decade of comparative genomics has been
the realization that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has
impacted the genetic make up of virtually everything we
have chosen to sequence. Long recognized as a major
force in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes [1] and
somewhat more recently for microbial eukaryotes [2],
HGT can also impact the genomes of complex, multi­
cellular organisms: case in point, plant mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA). Parasitic plants and their hosts (Figure 1)
have proven to be avid donors and recipients of mtDNA
[3], and two recent studies, one in the pages of BMC
Biology [4], have provided new mechanistic detail on the
causes and consequences of plant HGT [4,5]. HGTs
involving plant nuclear and chloroplast DNA appear (for
now at least) to be rare [6,7]. In contrast, plant mtDNA
appears to be highly mobile, a fact that has significant
practical and theoretical implications for plant biology.
The first suggestions that plant mitochondria might be
exceptional in terms of DNA uptake came from studies of

their fungal-derived, homing group I introns (for
example, [8]), and a growing body of evidence for plantto-plant HGT has since accumulated [3]. The current
champion is Amborella trichopoda, a ‘primitive’ flowering
plant found exclusively on the island of New Caledonia,
the mtDNA of which is littered with foreign genes
acquired from both angiosperm and non-angiosperm
donors [9,10].
How exactly does plant HGT happen? An important
clue comes from the fact that while examples of ancient
and ‘recent’ HGT events involving chloroplast DNA have
been documented [2], such events appear to be very
infrequent [6]. This makes sense given that plant

mitochondria possess active DNA uptake systems and
are capable of fusion; chloroplasts do not and are not (see
[3] and references therein). Thus, given direct physical
contact between host and parasite tissue, ample oppor­
tunity for mtDNA uptake and exchange would seem to
exist. Yet despite extensive phylogenetic evidence
support­ ng the notion that plant mitochondrial HGT is
i
rampant, numerous mechanistic uncertainties remain.
These include the question of whether DNA or RNA is
the donor molecule and whether a virus or some other
vector mediates the transfer.

Gene transfer, gene conversion, and intragenic
mosaicism
Mower et al. [4] sought to elucidate the process of plantto-plant HGT by using PCR to survey mitochondrial
genes in species of the parasitic plant Cuscuta (Figure 1)
and one of its many hosts, the dicot weed Plantago. After
initially casting a wide net to capture ten protein and
RNA genes from both Cuscuta gronovii and Plantago
coronopus mtDNA, they sequenced three genes, atp1,
atp6 and matR, from a range of host and parasite relatives
and showed that each gene appears to have been
transferred recently (within the last few million years)
from the mitochondrial genome of Cuscuta to that of
Plantago. In and of itself this is no longer surprising, but
the authors demonstrate that (i) the three genes appear to
have been transferred together in the context of a
relatively large fragment of DNA (and not RNA, which
can be inferred due to the presence of unedited cytidine
residues at sites known to undergo RNA editing); (ii)
both native and ‘foreign’ homologs (xenologs), the latter
in the form of pseudogenes, co-exist in several species;
and (iii) multiple gene conversion events have occurred
between co-resident loci.
Hao et al. [5] have gone even further. They uncovered a
‘gorgeous mosaic’ of multiple mitochondrial genes and
gene fragments in various plant host-parasite lineages,
including a striking chloroplast-to-mitochondrion transfer
involving a region of atp1. In total, approximately onethird of the HGT events investigated (5 of 17 genes)
appear to have involved at least some gene conversion the non-reciprocal exchange of DNA between homolo­
gous sequences - suggesting that this process plays an
important role in the integration of foreign genetic
material. The true significance of HGT-associated gene
conversion may in fact be underestimated because of
differential gene loss, lack of phylogenetic resolution and
insufficiently sensitive detection methods. The authors
propose a model - duplicative HGT and differential gene
conversion (DH-DC) - in which intra- and interorganellar gene transfer and recombination are creative
forces in the generation of mitochondrial genetic
diversity.

By duplicative HGT, Hao et al. mean the transfer and
integration of a foreign set of genes, a single gene, or a
gene fragment from donor to recipient mtDNA that does
not instantly replace its endogenous counterpart. Herein
lies the key to the model, as the co-existence, however
transient, of foreign and native loci within the same
subcellular compartment allows gene conversion to
occur. Gene conversion is a well-understood process (for
example, as a generator of allelic diversity during
meiosis), and in the context of DH-DC, gene conversion,
occurring in either a continuous or discontinuous
manner, gives rise to patchwork recombinants. Such
heterogeneity is not phenotypically ‘silent’: the
recombinant atp1 and matR genes uncovered by Hao et
al. yield proteins with different amino acid sequences [5].

DH-DC in plant mtDNA: impact and implications
The results of Mower et al. [4] and Hao et al. [5] are both
troubling and satisfying. Troubling because recombi­ a­
n
tion between resident and foreign gene copies, no matter
how transient the latter, has the potential to ‘wreak havoc’
on the results of even the most cautious phylogeneticist
intent on inferring organismal phylogenies from plant
mitochondrial genes [5]. In addition, mutation rate
estimates for plant mtDNA - painstakingly obtained and
long considered to be exceptionally low [3,11] - should, in
the face of the DH-DC model, now be considered over­
estimates: a certain fraction of single-nucleotide differ­
ences observed between sequences will be due to gene
conversion, not point mutation. Ultimately, though, satis­
faction comes from a deeper understanding and appre­
cia­ ion of the true complexity of plant mtDNA evolution.
t
More generally, Hao et al. [5] raise the intriguing
possibility that DH-DC could be a driver of gene evolu­
tion in prokaryotes, one that has thus far gone un­
detected. And what of nuclear genomes? In concluding
their study of Plantago-Cuscuta HGT, Mower et al. [4]
state that ‘…unravelling this history will probably require
sequencing multiple mitochondrial and nuclear genomes
from Plantago.’ Given the pace at which sequencing
technologies are evolving, it is hard to imagine this not
happening in the near future, not just within plants but
also for microbes and multicellular organisms across the
full breadth of eukaryotic diversity. With the exception of
specific lineages such as fungi, whose nuclear genomes
are being sequenced at both shallow and deep evolu­
tionary divergences, the field of comparative genomics is
still in ‘gap filling’ mode. The Hao et al. [5] and Mower et
al. [4] studies underscore the fact that when it comes to
HGT the devil is in the details: only in the context of
meticulous comparisons of both closely and distantly
related genomes is a deep understanding of the pattern,
process and full scope of eukaryotic HGT likely to
emerge.
