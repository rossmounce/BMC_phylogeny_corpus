The evolutionary trajectory of mitochondrial
carrier family during metazoan evolution
Ming Gong†, Jie Li†, Meng Wang, Jin Wang*, Ke Zen*, Chen-Yu Zhang*

Abstract
Background: Exploring metabolic evolution is a way to understand metabolic complexity. The substrate transport
of mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) influences direct metabolic activities, making it possible to understand
indirectly metabolic evolution from the evolution of substrate transport of MCF. However, the evolutionary study of
substrate transport of MCF does not mean that all the concrete structures of mitochondrial carriers (MCs) must first
be gained.
Results: Here we studied the alternation of MCF structure and potential correlated functions of MCF during
metazoan evolution. The data analysis indicates that the types of substrates transported by MCF as a whole were
maintained during metazoan evolution. However, the size of the substrates transported by members of MCs
continuously diminished during the evolutionary process. We have found that the ratio of hydrophobic amino
acids at specific helix-helix interfaces increases significantly during vertebrate evolution. Amino acid’s spatial
positioning and the calculating of packing values both indicate the increase in the number of hydrophobic amino
acids would lead to a more “tight” structure of the TR domain, which is in agreement with the trend of
diminishing size of substrates transported by MCs. In addition, there was a significant increase in the number of
carriers of MCF during vertebrate evolution.
Conclusions: We propose that the more “tight” TR structure generated by the increase of the hydrophobic amino
acids at specific helix-helix interfaces during vertebrate evolution enhances the substrate selectivity of MCF,
reflecting the evolutionary trajectory of MCF during metazoan evolution.

Background
Mitochondrial carriers (MCs), located at the inner membrane of mitochondria (IMM), are responsible for transporting a variety of metabolites between the cytosol and
the mitochondria and influence the activities of the
metabolic pathway direct [1,2]. The substrates transported by MCs, such as nucleotides, amino acids, cofactors, and H+, are involved in oxidative phosphorylation,
gluconeogenesis, the synthesis and degradations of
amino and fatty acids, the macromolecular synthesis of
proteins and nucleic acids, sterol metabolism, and thermogenesis [1]. The mutations of the carriers are closely
correlated with diseases, including Amish microcephaly,
CAC deficiency, NICCD/CTLN2, neonatal myoclonic

epilepsy, Sengers’ syndrome, severe obesity, and type II
diabetes [1,3].
The substrates transported by MCs vary widely in
their structure and size from the smallest, H+, to the largest and most highly charged species, such as ATP. By
considering conservation of amino acids, distance and
chemical constraints [4], and by modelling family members [5-12] on the known structure of the ADP/ATP
carrier, recent research has identified a common substrate binding site located at approximately the midpoint
of the membrane [4]. However, the molecular mechanism of substrate selectivity of MCs remains incompletely
understood. It is not possible to obtain the concrete
structures of all mitochondrial carrier family (MCF)
members through crystallization [1,13], and thus uncovering the mechanism of substrate selectivity of MCF
direct is impossible solely by linear superposition.
A powerful source of functional innovation is gene duplication and loss [14]. Some reports have suggested that

many of gene duplication events occur during the earlier
period of vertebrate evolution [15,16], indicating that if
gene duplications exist in MCF [17,18], the substrate selectivity changes may be a form of functional innovation closely associated with metabolic evolution. Here we
investigate MCF, a gene family with common functional
categories whose members do not have clearly defined
functions, and subject it to The Big Experiment [19] to
explore the evolutionary trajectory of MCF. We further
investigate the synchronization between molecular evolution and macroevolution to search for evolutionary rules of
sequences corresponding to structures of MCF in order to
determine the characteristics of structural changes. The
molecular mechanism of change of substrate selectivity was
then analyzed to identify the transport functions of MCs.

Results
Gene duplication of MCF is under strong purifying
selection

According to the classification of the MCF secondary
structure region (Additional file 1), TR has the most
conservative sequence with an identity of 70.44%, while
the average identities of LOOP135 (loop1, loop3, loop5)
and NCLOOP24 (n, c, loop2, loop4) (Additional file 1)
are only 42.24% and 19.25%, respectively. On the one
hand, the high evolutionary conservation in TR reflects
a stable structure maintaining the basic function of the
transport channel. On the other hand, this evolutionary
conservation indicates that the relatively small changes
(29.56%) of TR sequences may have a large effect on the
substrate transport of MCF.
Based on phylogenetic trees constructed from TR
sequences, orthologous subfamilies were identified from
gene families along with the relative gene duplication
events. Fifteen gene duplication events were found in
twelve gene families (Additional file 2). For the gene
family tested, the alternative model (specifically testing
for positive selection) was not a significantly better fit
(2l < 2.71, df = 1, p > 0.05) than the null model (Additional file 3). This result shows that there is no positive
selection in the evolution of MCF. According to purifying selection (dN /dS < 1), the smaller the dN /dS ratio
is, the greater the number of eliminated substitutions
and the greater the selective constraint [20]. Therefore,
strong purifying selection is characteristic of a high
number of eliminated substitutions and a strong selective constraint, indicating that its dN/dS values must be
very small. The cumulative distribution of the dN /dS of
MCF (Figure 1) and the mean value of dN /dS (0.023)
both show that strong purifying selection occurs in the
evolution of MCF in metazoan. The strong purifying
selection indicates that MCF maintains a relatively stable
substrate transport and its evolution is characteristic of
continuity during metazoan evolution.

Figure 1 The cumulative distribution of d N /d S of MCF. The
orthologous sequences of SLC25 were applied into a pairwise
sequence comparison. The program yn00 used the methods of
Yang and Nielsen [50] to estimate synonymous and
nonsynonymous substitution rates between two orthologous
sequences (dS and dN).

The evolution of MCF keeps pace with metazoan
evolution

The distribution of gene duplication events was found
mainly 750-430 Myr ago (Figure 2A), meeting approximately the earlier stage of vertebrate evolution along
with a large scale of events of gene duplication [15,16].
According to the trend of the cumulative distribution of
age distribution (Figure 2B), an explosion of gene duplication events occurred approximately 600 Myr ago during the Ediacarian and Cambrian periods (approximately
630 - 490 Myr ago). This timing indicates that the functional evolution of MCF began at approximately the
same time as metazoan evolution.
The correlation coefficient is 0.999 (P < 0.001) with
well congruence by comparing the divergence time of
species from the local clock estimation with the divergence time inferred from the fossil and molecular data
(Figure 3B), indicating that the evolution of MCF keeps
pace with metazoan evolution. The metabolic evolution
of metazoans may be embodied in the functional evolution of MCF.
The significant rise of hydrophobic residues at helix-helix
interfaces

The evolution of MCF was divided into three consecutive phases (see Methods) based on the fact that the
evolution of MCF occurs in parallel to metazoan evolution. Statistics on the components of amino acids in different structural regions of MCF showed that the

There was a significant rise in the hydrophobic residues

significant changes in TR UP was observed. Thus, the
region with a significant rise in hydrophobic residues
was focused on TRDOWN135 (P < 0.001; Additional file
4C). There was no significant change in the proportion
of charged residues and turn residues in TR. According

to the method of deselecting species, three sequence
pools were applied into the analysis of AACs. Non-ver
was clearly separated from Ver-eco and Ver-endo
according to the cumulative distribution of the proportion of the hydrophobic residues in TRDOWN135 (Figure
4A), while TRDOWN246 did not show a similar variation
(Figure 4B). This result further demonstrated that the
number of hydrophobic residues was significantly
increased in TRDOWN135 during vertebrate evolution.
Interestingly, TRUP246 showed a similar distribution (Figure 4D) with TRDOWN135, indicating that the number of
hydrophobic residues was increased in TRUP246 during
vertebrate evolution too. Although TR DOWN135 and
TRUP246 faced opposite directions (Additional file 1 and
Figure 4E), the spatial distributions in the structure of
ADP/ATP carrier clearly showed that they were close to
each other and formed three helix-helix interfaces (Figure 4E). The conserved P and G (Figure 4F) in TR246
could serve as the hinges between TR UP246 and
TR DOWN246 (Figure 4E) and made the helices in
TR UP246 tilt to the TR DOWN135 sides (Figure 4E).
TRDOWN246 participated in the formation of helix-helix
interfaces with TR DOWN135 as well as TRUP246 (Additional file 5A). However, TRUP135 had no similar properties according to its space distribution (Additional file
5B). So, TRDOWN135 served as links between TRUP246
and TRDOWN246 and played a vital role in the formation
of helix-helix interfaces, indicating the potential functional significance of the increased hydrophobic residues
in TRDOWN135.

mitochondrial inner membrane protein, MCF. The helix
association then occurs through a combination of
hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic, and van der Waals
interactions [22]. Due to the enrichment of the hydrophobic residues in position 3, 4, 6, 8 of TRDOWN246 (Figure 5D and 5F) and the enrichment of the hydrophobic
residues in position 4, 5, 7, 8 of TRUP246 (Additional file
6), we postulated that the methyl groups of the side
chain of the hydrophobic residues might interact with
the methyl groups of the hydrophobic residues from the
neighboring residues in TRDOWN135 by van der Waals
interactions to maintain the helix-helix interactions. The
experimental evidence showed that A134 of bovine
mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier potentially engaged
in inter-helical interactions as well as other key residues
in the odd-numbered transmembrane a-helices [10].
Further, we found that A134 was located rightly at the
TR DOWN135 and evolved from S at the same site of
invertebrate (Additional file 7), which indirectly supported our hypothesis that the increase of hydrophobic
residues would bring in more methyl groups, further
strengthening the accumulated effect of the van der
Waals interaction among them and generating a more
“tight” TR structure.
According to the calculation of packing values of the
residues in membrane proteins [22], TRDOWN135 in vertebrates had a significantly higher packing value (0.396)
than that of invertebrates (0.383). This result thus
further indicates that vertebrates have a more “tight” TR
structure of MCF than invertebrates.

The “tight” structure of TR during vertebrate evolution

Enhancement of substrate selectivity

According to the orientation of the three dimensional
structure of the ADP/ATP carrier, TRDOWN mainly consists of hydrophobic residues and some hydrophilic residues (Figure 5A and 5B). The changes of the type and
number of hydrophobic residues in TRDOWN affected
the connection among a-helices and further determined
direct the degree of compactness of TR DOWN since
hydrophobic residues in TR DOWN accounted for the
connection among a-helices (Figure 5A and 5B). These
hydrophobic residues were distributed in approximately
the vertical planes along the central axis from the cytosol to the matrix (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, the logo [21] analysis based on all the
sequences in the TRDOWN of MCF showed not only the
enrichment of the hydrophobic residues at the same site
or contiguous site in TRDOWN, but also the transformation of hydrophilic residues to hydrophobic residues in
TR DOWN135 at sites 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 during metazoan
evolution (Figure 5C and 5E). The hydrophobic effect
was lost once the helices were inserted into hydrophobic
bilayers as a driving force for the helix association of
integral membrane proteins [22] such as the

The salt network formed by the positive acids and negative acids (Additional file 8A) from three motif
sequences (Px(D/E)xx(K/R)) constituting the conical pit
of MCF (Additional file 8C) is important for transporting substrates [23-25]. Thus, the tandem concatenated
sequences from three motifs were selected to serve as
the indicators selecting the substrates. The Logo analysis
on the mark sequences of MCF as a whole in metazoans
showed a high similarity (Figure 6A), indicating that the
types of substrates transported by MCF are not different. This is in agreement with the strong purifying
selection (Additional file 3) occurring in the evolution of
MCF in metazoan.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4.0
[26] based on TR sequences from 44 carriers in SLC25
and their orthologous sequences in nine species (44 Χ
9) (Figure 6B). As can be seen, its branches were
labelled according to previous reports related to substrates transported by MCs [1,2]. The tree clearly
showed three clusters that correspond to three categories of substrates, namely ADP/ATP, amino acid and
cofactor, and H + . According to the E-value of each

diminished throughout the evolution (Figure 6B).

and the label sequences of Px(D/E)xx(K/R) [24,27]

in TR 246 (Figure 4E and Figure 4F) could also serve
as the hinges between TR UP246 and TR DOWN246 .

Furthermore, these conserved P and G in the transmembrane a-helices (Figure 4F) constituted the P-G level 1
located at approximately the midpoint of transmembrane region and the P-G level 2 located at approximately the bottom of transmembrane region [28]. The
two P-G levels [28] made the TRDOWN relatively independent and less affected by the structural changes due
to helix tilt during the substrate transport process. So,

the increased hydrophobic residues at the specific helixhelix interfaces could enhance the compactness degree
in TRDOWN and strengthened the interaction between
substrates and substrates contacting sites [4] of the
MCF, thus allowing the passing of the substrates with
the given size, in agreement with the trend of continuously diminishing size of substrates (Figure 6B).

Discussion
MCF acts as the molecular fossil of metazoan

The rise of oxygen concentration appears to have precipitated a massive increase in metabolic complexity, culminating in the rise of metazoans around 600 million
years ago [29]. Feedback in the rise of oxygen concentrations has led to increasing metabolic complexity [29]
and shows the existence of the intrinsic molecular
mechanism of continuously adapting to the rise of oxygen concentration. We found that many gene duplication events of MCF occurred during the early period of
vertebrate evolution, especially during the Ediacarian
and Cambrian periods (Additional file 2). Further, the
molecular evolution of MCF keeps pace with macroevolution (Figure 3). MCF located in mitochondria has a
direct effect on metabolic activity [1,2], and thus this
feedback mechanism may be embodied in the functional
evolution of MCF. These data make the MCF act as the
molecular fossil for exploring metabolic complexity in
metazoan.
Enhancement of substrates selectivity correlates to the
rise of oxygen concentration

The enhancement of the substrate selectivity of MCF
could partially explain the feedback mechanism evolved
in metabolic evolution from the viewpoint of providing
energy and reducing damage. From the view of providing energy, if mitochondria can be regarded as an
energy-producing factory, its core department is the
electron-transport chain. The enhancement of substrate
selectivity of MCF allowed for more frequent communication between the mitochondrial matrix and the IMM.
In addition, this increase of substrate selectivity provided
more energy materials to the energy-producing factory
by promoting the operation efficiency of this transport
machine. Thus, the increase in the concentration of oxygen as the last electron receiver in the electron-transport chain [30,31] would produce more abundant
energy to satisfy physiological needs.
Oxygen participates in the provision of energy for the
evolution of life but also brings by-products, such as
superoxide and peroxides [29]. The enhancement of
substrate selectivity of MCF offers a possible way to
reduce oxygen damage. It is the tendency towards
strengthening of the substrate selectivity of MCF that
makes the enhancement of selectivity of the H +

substrate. Uncoupling protein is generally considered as
responsible for H + conductance [32,33]. No specific
uncoupling protein is responsible for the proton conductance of yeast mitochondrion [34]. The recent
research represented that lamprey, generally considered
as the most primitive vertebrate, had the uncoupling
protein (UCP) transporting H+ [35], at least indicating
the enhancement of selectivity of the H+ substrate. We
also found the UCP subfamily was diverged approximately 637 million years ago (Additional file 2), in good
agreement with around 600 million years ago when the
rise of oxygen concentration culminates in the rise of
metazoans. This good correlation further indicate that
the rise of oxygen concentration may induces the
enhancement of selectivity of the H+ substrate, which
reduces oxygen damage by affecting the IMM potential,
such as the role of the UCP located in the H+ cluster in
reducing superoxide production and production of ROS
[36-38].
In view of the important role of MCF as a molecular
fossil in metabolism, we postulate that oxygen could be
an environmental factor affecting the variation of substrate transport of MCF. Our studies explore the functional mechanism of oxygen on the evolution of MCF
from the viewpoint of the enhancement of substrate
selectivity of MCF.

Conclusions
The more “tight” TR structure generated by the increase
of the hydrophobic amino acids at specific helix-helix
interfaces enhances the substrate selectivity of MCF,
which reflects the evolutionary trajectory of MCF.
Because the goal of this study was to understand the
variation in the structure of MCF from the level of
sequence, our findings might provide the more specific
mutation sites for laboratory experiments to improve
experimental efficiency.
Methods
Partitioning evolutional processes and obtaining
orthologous sequences

The orthologous sequences of human MCF (SLC25)
were obtained from Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL and GenBank
using the BLAST network service [39,40]. The complexity of metabolism was reflected by the evolutional process of metazoan, and thus the orthologous sequences
from metazoan were studied exclusively. In view of the
facts that sequence similarity is close to 30% between
members of SLC25 [41], the shorter process of
metazoan evolution has a lower sequence variation and
the orthologous gene itself has the a higher sequence
similarity, the E-value of BLAST was set to 10 -50 to
exclude the interference from many nonhomologous
genes. For cases when there was more than one

Gong et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/282

sequence with a high similarity to human members, the
sequence with the highest similarity was selected as the
orthologous gene.
The emergences of vertebrates and endotherms indicate the two great leaps in metazoan evolution, and thus
metazoan evolution was divided into three consecutive
phases named the Non-ver (invertebrate) phase, the
Ver-eco (vertebrate ectotherm) phase and the Ver-endo
(vertebrate endotherm) phase. As current databases do
not provide sequence data of MCF for more than three
ectotherm species, we only chose three fully annotated
species from three partitioned phases to meet the statistical requirements of ANOVA. Caenorhabditis elegans,
Drosophila melanogaster and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were used to represent the Non-ver phase. Tetraodon nigroviridis, Danio rerio and Xenopus tropicalis
were used to represent the Ver-eco phase. Bos Taurus,
Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens were used to represent the Ver-endo phase. The number of carriers from
the nine species are as follows: human (44), mouse (44),
bovine (40), frog (43), zebrafish (44), fugu (41), sea
urchin (22), fly (26), and worm (25). A list of sequence
accessions could be found in Additional file 9.
Classification of the whole structural region

In accordance with the generally accepted secondary
structure of MCF [1,2,13,23,27,41], we defined aminoends, carboxyl-ends and two hydrophilic regions (n, c,
loop2, loop4) facing the cytosol space as NCLOOP24;
transmembrane regions consisting of six a-helices as
TR; and three hydrophilic regions facing matrix space as
LOOP135 (loop1, loop3, loop5) (Additional file 1). Six
transmembrane a-helices were defined according to the
classification of TR [42] and the c-terminal definition of
three odd a-helices [41]. The example of TR classification could be found in the CLUSTAL alignment among
the oxoglutarate/malate sequences in metazoan species
(Additional file 7). TR135 represents three odd a-helices.
TR246 represents three even a-helices. TR was separated
into two parts along the vertical direction from cytosol
to matrix (Additional file 1). TRUP indicates the upper
part facing cytosol. TRUP was further divided into two
parts: TR UP135 was made up of three odd a-helices,
while TR UP246 consisted of three even a-helices.
TRDOWN represents the lower part of TR which faces
the mitochondria matrix. TRDOWN was further divided
into two parts: TRDOWN135 was made up of three odd
a-helices, while TRDOWN246 consisted of three even ahelices.
Gene duplication and natural selection detection

Gene duplication events were detected through the construction of phylogenetic trees of gene families [15]. The
acceptance criterion was that the orthologous subfamily

Page 9 of 12

emerging from a duplication event had at least two species. The topology of the phylogenetic tree of the candidate family was constructed by the neighbor-joining
method [43] (bootstrap = 500, JTT matrix).
The nonsynonymous substitution (those causing
amino acid-alterations) to synonymous substitution
(silent) rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) provides a sensitive measure of natural selection at the protein level, with ω
values of 1, > 1, and < 1, indicating neutral evolution,
positive selection and purifying selection, respectively
[44]. We used branch-site model A [44,45] to detect the
type of natural selection of TR. This model has been
reported to be more sensitive to the detection of positive selection than previous models including branch
models [46] and site models [47], which may be useful
in detecting positive selection after gene duplication in
gene family evolution [44]. We used a branch-site test
of positive selection [45] to construct a likelihood ratio
test between Model A with ω2≧1(alternative model,) and
Model A1 with ω2 = 1 fixed (null model). The test was
done by comparing the difference of likelihood values
2l to a c2 distribution of 1 degree of freedom. The critical values of 2l at the 5% and 1% level are 2.71 and
5.41, respectively [48]. Sites that could be under positive
selection were identified with a Bayes Empirical Bayes
approach [49]. In addition, synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates were estimated using
the methods of Yang and Nielson [50] as implemented
in yn00 using PAML software [48].
Time scale and molecular clock estimation

The time scale estimation of gene duplication with multiple calibrations was implemented in the codeml program [51] of the PAML package (version 4) [48]. We
adopted several calibrations inferred from both fossil
data and molecular data [52,53], such as the primaterodent (91 Myr ago), and vertebrate-fly (993 Myr ago)
calibrations. The mtREV24 model [54] was applied as a
model of amino acid substitution. We used both global
clock and local clock methods to conduct the time scale
estimation of gene duplication [55]. Linear regression
was applied to test the congruence between global clock
and local clock.
We applied the above-mentioned method to the molecular clock estimation to infer whether the evolution of
MCF keeps pace with macroevolution. Nine species could
be found in the small number of orthologous sequences of
human MCF, barely enough on behalf of MCF. Therefore,
six species (worm, fruitfly, zebrafish, frog, mouse, and
human) were selected to narrow the range of species.
Then 33 orthologous sequences were found for each species. Further, the tandem concatenated sequence, which
consisted of 33 orthologous TR sequences in each species,
was applied in the molecular clock estimation.

Analysis of the feature of the sequence from the
structure of MCF

The statistics of the amino acid component (AAC) were
conducted according to the classification of the structure of MCF. Hydrophobic residues were based on the
hydrophobicity table [56]. Our compiled program using
perl 5.8.7 was applied to the AAC statistic with two
approaches of selecting and de-selecting species, respectively. Firstly, the statistics with selecting species were
based on the above-mentioned nine species. A one-way
ANOVA, followed by the Holm-Sidak test for multiple
comparisons, was conducted using SigmaStat Windows
Version 3.5 to evaluate differences in mean values
among groups. The downloaded orthologous sequences
according to 10-50 (not including sequence fragments
and the sequences with obvious deletion in TR or conical pit region) were divided into the three sequences
pools that were in the Non-ver pool (192), the Ver-eco
pool (164), and the Ver-endo pool (208). A list of
sequence accessions could be found in Additional file
10. The mean value of the percentage of the relative
AAC was calculated from 132 (44 carriers × 3 species)
sequences sampled randomly from three pools, respectively. This process was repeated for 132 times. The
cumulative distribution function in the R language was
applied to the analysis of the cumulative distribution of
the mean values obtained.
Helix packing is important in the folding, stability, and
association of membrane proteins [22,57]. The packing
value correlates positively with the degree of compactness of TR [22,58]. Therefore, the quantitative statistics
of packing values of the membrane protein can partially
reflect the degree of compactness of TR. By studying
the packing trait on the membrane protein helix from
the obtained structure data of the membrane complex
[22], it was able to obtain the packing values of the
helix residues of TR. These data were applied to determine the average packing values of TR in MCF, indicating changes in the degree of compactness of TR during
metazoan evolution.
The evolution of substrate transport of MCs

A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4.0
[26] based on TR sequences from 44 carriers in SLC25
and their orthologous sequences in nine species (44 Χ
9). In view of the large number of sequences, the relatively low number of amino acids (the average length of
the sequences used was 111 amino acids), and the relatively high divergence among the sequences, the neighbor-joining method was selected to generate the
phylogenetic tree with the Poisson correction used to
measure the pairwise sequence distances [59,60]. Other
tree-generating algorithms (minimal evolution, UPMGA
and maximum likelihood) resulted in phylogenetic trees

Page 10 of 12

with a similar topology regarding the main branches
generated by the neighbor-joining method. According to
previous reports about the function of the members of
MCF [1,2], we could obtain the pattern of substrate
transport of MCF.
As this family is exclusive to eukaryotes [4], we took
all the fungal genomes in NCBI, the primitive species in
eukaryotes, as a reference from which to estimate the
ancient level of MCs. The sequences of SLC25 members
were applied into the BLAST network service in all the
fungal genomes in NCBI to obtain the corresponding
list of E-values. The smallest 10 E-values on the list
were used to determine the mean value statistics. The
smaller the mean value, the higher the similarity
between the sequences, and the older the carrier.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Two-dimensional structure of MCF. The structure of
MCF consists of the three segments that are NCLOOP24 facing the space
of cytosol, TR located in the inner membrane, and LOOP135 facing the
space of matrix, respectively. TR is made up of six a-helices represented
by six bars. Dark dot represents individual amino acid.
Additional file 2: Gene duplication events and the divergence time
of MCs. Orthologous TR sequences from 44 members of SLC25 were
applied into the construction of the phylogenetic trees to identify gene
duplications events. 15 gene duplication events were detected in 12
independent trees. Arrow indicates a gene duplication event with the
divergence time (Myr ago). The index in SLC25 (the appellation of MCF
in human) was used to denote the corresponding orthologous
sequences, such as A7, 8, 9 (representing the orthologous sequences of
UCP1, 2, 3 in human, respectively). A47 represents the subfamily of
Hepatocellular carcinoma-down-regulated mitochondrial carrier protein in
human.
Additional file 3: Likelihood scores, model parameters, and
likelihood-ratio test results for branch-site model analyses. A
indicates the orthologous sequences of member of SLC25. The index in
SLC25 (the appellation of MCF in human) was used to denote the
corresponding orthologous sequences, such as A7, 8, 9 (representing the
orthologous sequences of UCP1, 2, 3, respectively). We used a branchsite test of positive selection [45] to construct a likelihood ratio test
between Model A with ω2≧1(alternative model,) and Model A1 with ω2
= 1 fixed (null model). The test was done by comparing the difference of
likelihood values 2l to a c2 distribution of 1 degree of freedom. The
critical values of 2l at the 5% and 1% level are 2.71 and 5.41,
respectively [48].
Additional file 4: Analysis of the AAC (amino acid component) in
MCF. (A) The mean percentage of the hydrophobic residues in TR. (B)
The comparison of the mean percentage of the hydrophobic residues in
TRUP and TRDOWN. (C) The comparison of the mean percentage of the
hydrophobic residues in TRDOWN135 and TRDOWN246. The groups were
evaluated using a one way ANOVA followed by the Holm-Sidak test for
multiple comparisons. n = 132. Bars represent the mean ± s.e.m, while
an asterisk indicates P < 0.001 in comparison to the Non-ver phase.
Additional file 5: The spatial distribution of transmembrane ahelices in the human ADP/ATP carrier. (A) The human ADP/ATP carrier
viewed from the lateral side. Yellow represents TRDOWN135. Blue
represents TR246. (B) The human ADP/ATP carrier viewed from the
cytosol. Yellow represents TRUP135.
Additional file 6: The logo chart of sequences in TRUP246. (A) The
logo chart of sequences in TRUP246 from Ver. (B) The logo chart of
sequences in TRUP246 from Non-ver. Red indicates hydrophobic residues,
blue indicates hydrophilic residues, and black indicates other residues.

The logo chart describes the residue changes in the same vertical plane
according to the space structure orientation of TRUP246 for metazoan
evolution. WebLogo [21] was applied into the Logo analysis. Ver
indicates vertebrates, while Non-ver indicates invertebrates.
Additional file 7: The CLUSTAL alignment among the oxoglutarate/
malate sequences in metazoan species. The sequences with fragment
and obvious deletion in TR and conical pit region (CPR) were not
included. CLUSTAL W [63] was applied to multiple sequence alignment.
The marks “*”, “.”, and “:” stand for the identical amino acids, relative, and
similar amino acids. CPR consists of three motif sequences (Px(D/E)xx(K/
R)) that are located at the C-terminal of TR1, TR3 and TR5, respectively.
The sequence accessions according to the species order above were as
followed: Q02978, Q9CR62, P97700, NP_777096.1, NP_001090497.1,
AAH71521.1, CAF90256.1, XP_002610854.1, XP_001639936.1,
XP_001867726.1, NP_651703.1, NP_493694.2, XP_002571870.1 and
XP_001893008.1. The detailed classifications of TR sequences and CPR in
the oxoglutarate/malate carrier are applicable to other MCs too.
