Abstract
Background: Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSTs), consisting of a histidine
kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR), represent a major paradigm for signal transduction in
prokaryotes. TCSTs play critical roles in sensing and responding to environmental conditions, and
in bacterial pathogenesis. Most TCSTs in Erwinia amylovora have either not been identified or have
not yet been studied.
Results: We used a systems approach to identify TCST and related signal transduction genes in
the genome of E. amylovora. Comparative genomic analysis of TCSTs indicated that E. amylovora
TCSTs were closely related to those of Erwinia tasmaniensis, a saprophytic enterobacterium
isolated from apple flowers, and to other enterobacteria. Forty-six TCST genes in E. amylovora
including 17 sensor kinases, three hybrid kinases, 20 DNA- or ligand-binding RRs, four RRs with
enzymatic output domain (EAL-GGDEF proteins), and two kinases were characterized in this
study. A systematic TCST gene-knockout experiment was conducted, generating a total of 59
single-, double-, and triple-mutants. Virulence assays revealed that five of these mutants were nonpathogenic on immature pear fruits. Results from phenotypic characterization and gene expression
experiments indicated that several groups of TCST systems in E. amylovora control amylovoran
biosynthesis, one of two major virulence factors in E. amylovora. Both negative and positive
regulators of amylovoran biosynthesis were identified, indicating a complex network may control
this important feature of pathogenesis. Positive (non-motile, EnvZ/OmpR), negative (hypermotile,
GrrS/GrrA), and intermediate regulators for swarming motility in E. amylovora were also identified.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that TCSTs in E. amylovora played major roles in virulence
on immature pear fruit and in regulating amylovoran biosynthesis and swarming motility. This
suggested presence of regulatory networks governing expression of critical virulence genes in E.
amylovora.

Background
Prokaryotes use their small size and metabolic diversity to
dominate every conceivable niche on earth. A large part of
this success comes from the evolution of elaborate sensory
systems to monitor and respond to dramatic fluctuations
in their environment. Primary means of signal transduction in bacteria involve two-component signal transduction systems (TCSTs) [1,2]. The term "two-component"
was coined in 1986 to describe a new class of regulatory
systems found in bacteria; today, two-component systems
represent major paradigms for signal transduction in
prokaryotes and in lower eukaryotes [3,4]. The prototypical two-component system consists of a histidine kinase
protein (HK) containing a conserved kinase core and a
response regulator protein (RR) containing a conserved
regulatory domain [4,5]. Extracellular stimuli are sensed
by, and serve to modulate HK activities. The HK is autophosphorylated at a histidine residue, creating a highenergy phosphoryl group that is subsequently transferred
to an aspartate residue in the RR via a reaction catalyzed
by the RR itself. Phosphotransfer to the RR leads to activation of a downstream effector domain that elicits a specific
response [1,4].
Two-component systems are distributed at varying frequencies among organisms of all domains, including
Eubacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya [1,3]. The availability of
complete genome sequences has allowed for a definitive
assessment of the prevalence of two-component proteins.
There are 30 HKs (five of which are hybrid kinases) and 32
RRs in Escherichia coli [6]. However, the number of twocomponent proteins differs greatly among bacteria. Often,
parasitic bacteria encode fewer signaling proteins than relatively free-living bacteria [7]. Among sequenced plant
pathogenic bacteria, the number of TCST genes is quite
different. For example, the xylem-limited Xylella fastidiosa
has the fewest TCST genes; whereas, the relatively adaptable Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas spp. have the
largest number of TCST genes [8,9]. Perhaps, the most
attractive reason for studying two-component systems in
bacteria is that TCST systems are used by pathogenic bacteria to control expression of virulence factors required for
infection. Many such TCST systems are identified in both
human and animal pathogens and in plant pathogens
[7,10]. The Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirA/VirG system,
the GacA/GacS of both Pseudomonas sp. and Pectobacterium
carotovora, and the RpfCG of Xanthomonas spp. and X. fastidiosa are probably the most well-known and studied
TCST systems involved in virulence gene expression in
plant pathogens [10-12]. However, most of these studies
focused on one or a few TCSTs. Only recently has genomewide analysis of TCSTs in plant pathogenic bacteria
become possible due to increased availability of whole
genome sequences [8,9,13].

E. amylovora is the causal agent of fire blight, a devastating
necrotic disease affecting apple, pear, and other rosaceous
plants. Fire blight is one of the most important bacterial
plant diseases worldwide that has a significant economic
impact, resulting in crop losses of millions of dollars per
year [14]. As a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, E. amylovora is related to many important human and animal
pathogens such as Es. coli, Salmonella enterica, Shigella
flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Y. pestis. Like many
other Gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria, E. amylovora utilizes both a type III secretion (T3SS) apparatus to
deliver effector proteins into host plant cells, and the
extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) amylovoran to cause
disease [15-17]. In E. amylovora, structural components of
T3SS encoded by the Hrp regulon are regulated by the
two-component system HrpX and HrpY, which direct the
expression of the NtrC family σ54-dependent, enhancerbinding protein HrpS [18]. Both HrpY and HrpS function
in the activation of expression of the alternate sigma factor
HrpL, thereby regulating various genes and operons of the
Hrp regulon. Expression of hrpX and hrpS is regulated by
low pH, low nutrients, and low temperature conditions,
mimicking the plant apoplast [18]. The biosynthesis of
amylovoran is regulated by another TCST system, the
RcsCDB phosphorelay system [17]. Recently, we identified several TCST genes including hrpX, grrS, and envZ that
are induced during infection of host tissue in E. amylovora,
indicating that TCSTs are key players in controlling the
expression of virulence factors required for infection, and
thus we hypothesize that there are likely networks controlling virulence gene expression [19]. However, other
TCSTs in E. amylovora have either not been identified or
have not yet been studied. This prompted us to use a systems approach to explore the function of TCSTs in E. amylovora. Understanding the genetics and molecular
mechanisms of E. amylovora signaling will greatly enhance
the likelihood of developing novel methods of controlling the disease.
The EnvZ-OmpR and GrrS-GrrA (also called GacSA, BarAUvrY) are two widely-distributed and well-studied TCSTs
in γ-proteobacteria. They represent those paradigms of signal transduction systems having pleiotropic effects, thus
suggesting both systems are global regulators [2,20]. EnvZ
is a transmembrane sensor that predominantly responds
to acidic pH conditions and changes in osmolarity, and
subsequently phosphorylates OmpR. The EnvZ-OmpR
system has been originally reported to govern the expression of ompC and ompF genes, encoding two major outermembrane porins [21]. In addition to its role in porin
osmoregulation, OmpR is involved in regulating various
cellular components including flagellar gene expression,
fatty acid transport, curli fibre formation, and cell division
as a dual regulator; i.e., negative or positive [22]. In Salmo-

nella spp., OmpR-EnvZ regulates another TCST system
SsrA-SsrB, that in turn regulates the T3SS produced by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) [23-26]. OmpR
also negatively regulates expression of invasin in Yersinia
enterocolitica and the T3SS in P. syringae [27,28].
GacS and GacA homologs have been identified in many
Gram-negative bacterial genera, including Azotobacter,
Erwinia, Escherichia, Legionella, Pectobacterium, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Serratia, and Vibrio [12,20,29]. The
sensor kinase GacS was initially discovered as a key regulator of virulence in the plant pathogen P. syringae [see
review [12]]. The GacSA system has since been reported to
regulate an array of phenotypes, including biofilm formation, alginate biosynthesis, production of toxins and
extracellular enzymes [30,31], proteases, siderophores,
swarming motility [32], and type III secretion [10,29,3335]. Similar to EnvZ-OmpR, GacSA also has a dual regulatory function; i.e., as a positive or negative regulator. The
GacS/GacA (BarA/UvrY) system positively controls the
expression of one to five genes specifying small RNAs
(sRNAs), thus upregulating the productions of proteins
that are otherwise repressed by small RNAs (RsmA/CsrA)
[32,36]. Most gacS/gacA mutants demonstrate reduced
production of virulence factors and reduced virulence in a
variety of host-pathogen systems [12,20]. An alternative
scenario is that the GacSA cascade downregulates the
expression of flagellar genes in P. fluorescens or Es. coli
[20].
In this study, our genome-wide analysis, using the
recently closed genome sequence of E. amylovora Ea273
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_amylovora/ identified a total of 46 TCST genes in E. amylovora including 17
sensor kinases, 20 response regulators, three hybrid HKs,
four RRs with enzymatic output domain (EAL-GGDEF
proteins), and two kinases. A comparative genomic analysis of TCSTs was then conducted in related enterobacteria
enabling classification of the TCSTs in E. amylovora. A total
of 59 deletion mutants were generated, and their contribution to virulence, amylovoran biosynthesis, and
swarming motility was characterized. Our findings suggested that TCSTs in E. amylovora played a major role in
virulence and in the regulation of amylovoran biosynthesis and swarming motility. This indicated that networks of
gene regulation existed in E. amylovora that respond to different environmental and host signals.

Results
Identification and comparison of TCSTs in E. amylovora
We utilized two approaches to identify HKs and RRs in the
genome of E. amylovora. First, using a candidate gene
approach, known HK and RR sequences from Es. coli K12
and P. carotovora pv. atroseptica SCRI1043 were used to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/245

search the closed genome sequence of E. amylovora http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_amylovora/. Second, based
on conserved domains of known HKs and RRs, other
putative HKs and RRs in E. amylovora were identified and
confirmed by searching the complete genome sequences
for proteins containing HK and RR domains using Pfam
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles and BLASTP. As a
result, we identified 46 TCST and other related signal
transduction genes in E. amylovora (Table 1 and Table S1,
[see Additional file 1]), excluding two sets of chemotaxis
genes (cheABRWYZ). These putative regulatory genes represented 1.36% of the genome (3367 genes) [37]. Among
them, 17 are sensor kinases, three hybrid HKs, 20 DNA-or
ligand-binding RRs, four RRs with enzymatic output
domain (EAL-GGDEF proteins), and two putative kinases
(Table 1).
When compared to TCSTs in other enterobacteria, the
majority of TCSTs in E. amylovora have counterparts in
related enterobacteria, including Dickeya dadantii (Erwinia
chrysanthemi) 3937, P. carotovora subsp. atroseptica
SCRI1043, Erwinia tasmaniensis Et1/99, and Es. coli K12
(Table 2 and Table S1, [see Additional file 1]). Only one
HK and RR pair (ypdAB) in E. tasmaniensis is not present in
E. amylovora Ea273 (Table 2). The number of TCSTs in E.
amylovora is the lowest among other sequenced related
plant pathogenic enterobacteria and Es. coli (Table S1, [see
Additional file 1]). BLAST searches revealed that the HKs
and RRs in E. amylovora shared the highest amino acid
(aa) identity/similarity to those of E. tasmaniensis Et1/99,
an epiphytic bacterium isolated from apple flowers in
Australia [38], except for HrpX/Y which shared the highest
aa identity/similarity to those in Erwinia pyrifoliae, a
related blight pathogen of Asian pear (Table 2). It is interesting to note that HrpXY, which regulates T3SS gene
expression in plant pathogenic enterobacteria, is the only
TCST that is not present in other mammalian enterobacterial pathogens [39].
Classification of HKs and RRs in E. amylovora
In general, HKs are highly variable in amino acid
sequence length; whereas, RRs are highly conserved in
their receiver domain (REC). Classification of HKs is usually based on alignment of residues surrounding the Hbox that contains the conserved His residue within the
histidine kinase domain (HisKA) [9,40]. Multiple
sequence alignment using Clustal X has classified the HKs
of E. amylovora into four groups [40]. Among them, 15
belong to groups IA (11), IB (3), and IC (1); and one
(DcuS), two (NarQ and HrpX), and one (YehU) belong to
groups II, III, and IV HKs, respectively (Table S1, [see
Additional file 1] and Figure S1, [see Additional file 2]).
This is the first time that HrpX has been classified as a type
III HK. However, RcsD (also known as YojN), containing

a Genes

for one TCST system are listed separately if they are not encoded within an operon in the genome. Otherwise, TCSTs are listed as an
operon if genes are present together. Mutants for ntrBC were not constructed.
b All TCSTs are sensor kinases and their corresponding DNA-binding response regulators. We included two sets of quorum sensing genes and four
RRs with enzymatic output domain (EAL-GGDEF proteins) and two kinases. EBP: NtrC family of enhancing-binding protein. HPT: Histidine
phosphotransfer domain; AHL: Acyl-homoserine lactone; GGDEF: Diguanylate cyclase; EAL: Type I c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase.
c Mutant designation see Table 3.

a histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) domain, but lacking a
conserved histidine residue in the HisKA domain, could
not be classified.
Analysis of the domain architecture of E. amylovora HKs,
by either searching the Conserved Domain Databases
(CDD) [41] or using the SMART program [42]http://
smart.embl-heidelberg.de/, has revealed that all HKs in E.
amylovora, except for HrpX and NtrB, contain one to three
hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) helices within the Nterminal sensor region. This indicates that these HKs are
periplasmic sensors. HrpX and NtrB contain two and one
PAS domain (initially found in PER, ARNT, and SIM proteins), respectively, within the N-terminal sensor region,
indicating that they are soluble and cytoplasmic proteins
that sense intracellular signals [18]. The YehU contains a
5TMR-LYT (5 TM receptor domain, LytS-like) sensory
input domain before the two TM helices, thus indicating
that the YehU is an intramembrane sensor.
Often, RRs are classified into families based on their output domains and domain combinations [43]. By search-

ing the SMART program and conducting a structural
similarity of C-terminal output domains [4,43], it is
revealed that 20 RRs contain either DNA- or ligand-binding output domains in E. amylovora (Table S1, [see Additional file 1]). Among them, eleven, four, two, and one are
further classified into OmpR-, NarL-, NtrC-, and LytR-like
proteins, respectively (Table S1, [see Additional file 1]).
These RRs belong to four major families of RRs found in
prokaryotes and account for about 64% of all RRs identified thus far [43]. In addition, four RRs (YciR, YddV, YegE,
and YoaD) contain enzymatic output domains including
GGDEF and EAL domains (Table 1). The GGDEF and EAL
domains have diguanylate cyclase and Type I c-di-GMP
phosphodiesterase activity, respectively, and these proteins are involved in regulating virulence functions in
some plant pathogens [44].

a Sequences for E. amylovora TCST genes are from the whole genomic sequence of E. amylovora http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_amylovora/.
One TCTS system (ypdAB) in E. tasmaniensis is not present in E. amylovora Ea273. Two sets of CheABRWYZ exist in E. amylovora, but only one set
in E. tasmaniensis.
b In parentheses is gene or gene number for the corresponding gene in E. tasmaniensis.
c The number in parentheses is the length of deduced amino acid for the corresponding protein in E. tasmaniensis which differs from those in E.
amylovora.
d All data are the highest aa similarity and identify found in NCBI database as of today except for HrpXY which share the highest aa identity/
similarity to those in E. pyrifoliae (98/99%; 99/99%, respectively). N/A: not available.

deletion mutants were generated for those genes/operons
identified above, and also included hrpS and eamI. Deletions were made using the Lambda-Red recombinase technique, as previously described for Es. coli and E. amylovora
[45-47]. A total of 59 single-, double- and triple- stable
deletion mutants were generated (Table 1 and Table 3).
For these mutants, the majority of the coding region of
each gene or operon was deleted and replaced by the CmR
or KmR marker gene, except for the first and last 50 nt of
the gene or operon, thus minimizing any polar effects of
the mutation.
For prokaryotes, genes for cognate pairs of HKs and RRs
are typically encoded together in a single operon [1].
Because of this unique feature for HKs and RRs, and the
potential cross-talk between different HKs and RRs, these
single deletion mutants generated in this study have been
designed to have little or no effect on expression/function
of the cognate gene in the operon. Furthermore, operon
deletion mutants have been generated so that phenotypes
of single gene deletion mutants could be compared with
those of operon deletion mutants to determine whether

or not there is cross-talk between HKs and RRs. All
mutants and their designations are listed in Table 3.
To determine the role of deletion mutants in E. amylovora
virulence, an assay, routinely used to evaluate virulence of
E. amylovora WT strains, of all 59 TCST mutants on immature pear fruits was conducted [19,46,48]. Mutants and
WT strains were inoculated on immature pears as
described, and disease development was assessed for up to
eight days. Results showed that five mutants, including
three single (rcsB, rcsC, rcsD mutant), one double (rcsBD),
and one triple mutant (hrpXYS), were non-pathogenic on
immature pears (Table 3). However, hrpX, hrpY, and hrpXY
mutants remained to exhibit full-virulence, as that of WT,
on immature pear fruit (Table 3). Previous genetic studies
have shown that a mutation in rcsB renders E. amylovora
nonpathogenic and abolishes amylovoran production
[49]. Our results further demonstrated that the RcsCDB
phosphorelay system was essential for virulence in E. amylovora [17]. In addition, all other mutants induced similar
symptoms to the WT strain on immature pear fruit (Table
3).

operon encodes amylovoran biosynthesis. The entire operon (amsA-L; 15.8 kb) was deleted in the ams mutant [47]. flhD and fliA encode two
regulators of flagella biosynthesis. These three mutants were used as negative controls for amylovoran biosynthesis and swarming motility,
respectively.

c Amylovoran production was measured 48 hr post inoculation. ND: not determined.
d Distance of swarming motility was measured 48 hr post inoculation. Original circle was about 0.6 cm in diameter. I: irregular movement; C:

e Values within the amylovoran production and distance of swarming motility columns followed by the same letter are not significantly different
according to one way ANOVA and student-Newmans-Kleus test (P = 0.05).

Phenotypic analysis of deletion mutants
All generated mutants did not exhibit any distinctive phenotypes on rich LB medium, except for a single mutant
which was mucoid (ybjN mutant). Therefore, phenotypes
of the 59 deletion mutant strains were evaluated using a
swarming plate assay [50,51]. WT cells can swarm via the
combined effects of flagellar motility, chemotaxis, and
growth, thus creating a circular colony. Defects in cell
motility, chemotaxis, or growth can produce alterations in
swarming size or density [51]. For E. amylovora WT and
mutant strains, bacterial suspensions were plated onto
swarming agar plates containing 0.3% agar, as previously
described [50,51]. Swarming diameter and density were
determined following incubation at 28°C for up to 72 hr,
and three different swarming phenotypes were identified.
Two mutants, grrA and grrS, exhibited substantially larger
and lower density swarms than the WT (Figure 1A; Table
3, significance level a). In addition, three mutants, envZ,
ompR, and envZ/ompR double-mutant, showed dramatic
reduction in swarm size, but with increased density (Figure 1B; Table 3, significance level v). All these five mutants
exhibited circular swarming (Figure 1A and 1B). A third
group of mutants showed smaller swarms, colonies exhibited irregular circular patterns, and these included arcAB,
baeRS, cpxA1R1, kdpE, luxPQ, rstAB, and yciR mutants (Figure 1C; Table 3, significance levels o to u). Although the
distance of the cpxA1R1 mutants had similar significant
level as that of envZ/ompR mutants at 48 hr, these mutants
were included in the third group due to its irregular move-

ments and with increased distance at 72 hr in contrast to
envZ/ompR mutants which remained the same at 72 hr
(Figure 2B). The rest of mutants showed even less change
in swarm distance. As negative controls, all flagella-deficient mutants, flhDC and fliA, were non-motile on swarming plates (Figure 1D).
As shown in Figure 1A, grrS/grrA mutant strains showed
precocious swarming and moved faster than the WT
strain, with a diameter of 1.7 cm within 24 hr compared
to 1 cm for the WT strain, from an original spot of 0.6 cm
in diameter (Figure 2A). The swarming distance was 3.2
and 4.8 cm for grrS/grrA mutants and 2.7 and 3.8 cm for
WT strain, respectively, at 48 and 72 hr (Figure 2A). When
grrS and grrA mutants were complemented with their own
gene cloned from the WT strain, the hyper-motile phenotype was restored in these mutants with a swarming distance, ~2.8 cm after 48 hr of incubation, similar to that of
the WT strain (data not shown). In contrast, envZ/ompR
mutants showed reduced swarming even after 72 hr (Figure 2B), and colonies exhibited more dense and fuzzy
appearance. The diameter for envZ/ompR mutants was
about 0.8, 1.0, and 1.0 cm for 24 to72 hr, from an original
spot of 0.6 cm in diameter, respectively (Figure 2B). When
envZ/ompR mutants were complemented by their own
gene cloned from the WT strain, the 'low-motile' phenotype was partially restored. The diameter (about 1.5 cm
after 48 hr of incubation) for the complemented mutant
strains was comparable to that of the WT strain (Data not

shown). However, the swarming phenotype remained different between envZ/ompR mutants and those of flhDC
and fliA mutants, which exhibited no movement and
maintained the original size of 0.6 to 0.7 cm in diameter
(Figure 1BD). In summary, these results demonstrated
that EnvZ/OmpR acts as a positive regulator of swarming
motility, while GrrS/GrrA is a negative regulator of swarming motility in E. amylovora. These findings demonstrated
that additional TCST genes might also control swarming
motility in E. amylovora.
Regulation of amylovoran biosynthesis
Based on the virulence assay, the RcsCDB system that regulates amylovoran biosynthesis is essential for virulence
in E. amylovora. Phenotypes of the 59 deletion mutant
strains were further evaluated by measuring amylovoran
biosynthesis in vitro. The amylovoran concentration in the
supernatant of bacterial cultures was quantitatively determined using a turbidity assay with cetylpyrimidinium
chloride (CPC), as previously described [52]. In this
screening, four groups of mutants exhibiting varying levels of amylovoran production in vitro were identified
(Table 3). For Group I, three mutants (rcsB, rcsD, and
rcsBD) exhibited lack of amylovoran production (Table 3,
significance level r); For Group II, six mutants (grrA, grrS,

ybjN, envZ, ompR, and envZ/ompR double-mutant) showed
a dramatic increase in amylovoran production, about 20fold, compared to that of the WT (Figure 3A; Table 3, significance levels a to c); Group III mutants demonstrated
increased production of amylovoran, from 2- to 8-fold,
compared to that of the WT, and these included hrpX,
hrpY, hrpXY, hrpXYS, rcsC, luxPQ, and eamIR (Table 3, significance levels d to j). Group IV mutants did not show
much difference in amylovoran production when compared to that of WT, and these included pmrAB, narPQ,
and yfhAK (Table 3, significance levels k to p). As a negative control, an amylovoran operon deletion mutant, ams,
lacked amylovoran production (Figure 3A; Table 3, significance level r) [17,47].
For group I mutants, we have recently described how the
RcsCDB phosphorelay system regulates amylovoran biosynthesis [17]. This study focused on group II mutants,
except for the ybjN mutant, which will be reported in the
future. Amylovoran production of five mutants, including
grrA, grrS, envZ, ompR, and the envZ/ompR double-mutant,
was partially complemented by their own gene/operon
cloned from the WT strain. As shown in Figure 3A, complemented strains produced slightly less amylovoran than
that of the mutant strains. To correlate amylovoran proPage 8 of 16

flow cytometry [17]. The amsG gene was expressed at a
basal level in the WT strain, with a GFP intensity value of
1.7 (geometric mean), compared to a geometric mean
value of 1.5 for the control vector. The geometric mean
value of the GFP intensity of the amsG promoter was 26.2
and 60.5 for ompR and grrA mutants, respectively (Figure
3B). These results indicated that amylovoran production
was negatively regulated by both EnvZ/OmpR and GrrA/S
systems, and a regulatory network might be regulating
amylovoran production in E. amylovora.

[17], the level of expression of the amsG gene, the first
gene in the ams (amylovoran) operon, was measured
using GFP as a reporter in two RR mutants (grrA and
ompR). GFP intensity was measured in the WT and in
mutants containing the amsG promoter-GFP fusion using

In this study, 46 TCSTs have been identified in E. amylovora, a pathogen of rosaceous plants which mainly
resides in the plant xylem, but can also grow epiphytically
on stigmas of flowers. Compared to other plant pathogenic enterobacteria such as D. dadantii and P. carotovora
subsp. atroseptica, both of which can survive not only in
plants, but also in soil, or the animal counterpart Es. coli,
the number of TCSTs present in E. amylovora is relatively
small, thus may reflecting the particular host niche for this
pathogen. Furthermore, the genome size (3.9 Mbp) of E.
amylovora is also the smallest among sequenced enterobacterial plant and mammalian pathogens [53]. However,
E. amylovora still maintains both enterobacterial-specific
TCSTs (such as the Rcs system) [54] and plant enterobacterial-specific ones (such as HrpXY) [39].
On the other hand, E. amylovora has almost the same
number of TCSTs as that found in E. tasmaniensis, a saprophytic bacterium isolated from apple flowers in Tasmania,
Australia [38]. Since both bacteria occupy the same ecological niche during colonization and can grow epiphytically on flowers, these bacteria might have developed and
maintained similar TCSTs. This suggests that TCSTs may
be evolutionarily maintained to cope with similar environmental and plant host signals in closely related bacteria. It is interesting to note that fire blight is endemic to
North America, and it has subsequently spread to Europe
and New Zealand in the 1950s and in 1917, respectively,
but it has not yet been reported in Australia [14]. It is possible that these two bacteria may have not yet encountered
each other, as the distribution of E. tasmaniensis outside of
Australia remains unknown. Surprisingly, we found that
the majority of TCSTs in these two bacteria share a high
level of aa similarity and identity. These results suggest
that similar TCSTs might play important roles for the survival and proliferation among closely-related bacteria in
similar plant niches.
Currently, several thousands of TCSTs have been identified in sequenced bacterial genomes [55-57]. Although
the basic biochemistry of TCSTs is well understood, some
structural insights in phosphorylation-dependent changes
of TCST domains are variable. Domain architecture has
proven particularly informative for analyzing multidoPage 9 of 16

OmpR-types. Recently, many novel conserved domains
have been described such as PAS, GAF, GGDEF, EAL, and
HD-GYP, thereby affirming the complexity of bacterial
signaling systems [43,58]. In E. amylovora, most HKs
belong to four common HK groups, and are periplasmic
sensors. Moreover, most RRs in this bacterium are OmpR, NarL-, NtrC-, and LytR-like proteins, the four most common families of DNA-binding RRs found in prokaryotes
[43]. These results indicate that E. amylovora has maintained some basic signal transduction systems for the bacterium to survive. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses
have revealed co-evolutionary relationships between cognate HKs and RRs. This seems obvious in E. amylovora as
orphan HKs and RRs are rare.

It is well understood that TCSTs are involved in regulating
virulence gene expression in plant bacterial pathogens
[10]. Previous reports on TCSTs have demonstrated the
importance of TCSTs in the virulence of bacterial plant
pathogens. However, data on complete or global virulence regulation networks are lacking. A recent study by
Qian et al. [13] provides a useful beginning towards a better understanding of the regulatory networks involved. A
genome-wide mutagenesis of all 54 RRs in X. campestris
pv. campestris has revealed that two novel RRs are involved
in virulence, thus facilitating future studies on signaling
networks in this bacterium [13]. In this study, we have utilized a reverse genetic approach and constructed 59 HK
and RR mutants in E. amylovora, which will also provide
valuable tools for future global gene expression assays
using microarrays to deduce signaling networks in this
bacterium.

[43,58]. In RRs, structural characterization of DNA-binding domains has revealed several variations on the common helix-turn-helix (HTH) theme, such as NarL- and

Early studies have revealed that in E. amylovora, the Hrp
T3SS, which delivers effector proteins into host plants,
and the EPS amylovoran are two major virulence factors
[52,59,60]. Previous reports have also indicated that the
RcsCDB phosphorelay system regulates amylovoran biosynthesis, while the two-component system HrpXY regulates hrp-T3SS gene expression. Recently, we have further
demonstrated that the Rcs system is essential for virulence
in E. amylovora and may play a role in the survival of the
pathogen [17]. Mutations in the Rcs system have rendered
the organism non-pathogenic [17]. In this study, we have
found that hrpX, hrpY and hrpXY mutants remain virulent,
and could induce a spotty weak hypersensitive response
(HR) on tobacco (Figure S2A, [see Additional file 2]);
while, a hrpXYS triple mutant has a normal Hrp- phenotype. It is interesting to note that, in a previous report,
Tn5-insertional mutants of hrpY have been reported to be
non-pathogenic, and could not induce an HR on tobacco
[18]. Two classes of hrpX insertional mutants have been
identified, one similar to the hrpY mutant and the other
that continue to cause disease and induce a spotty HR on
tobacco [18]. Similar observations have been reported in

Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, causal agent of Stewart's
wilt of corn [61]; wherein, Tn5-insertional hrpX and hrpY
mutants exhibit a Hrp- phenotype and in-frame deletion
hrpX mutants show reduced virulence. Since the hrpXY is
transcribed as an operon, it is possible that Tn5 insertion
could cause polar effects on the downstream genes such as
hrpS (Figure S2B, [see Additional file 2]). Indeed, a recent
study indicates that the hrp regulatory genes in P. stewartii
subsp. stewartii participate in a novel regulatory loop that
upregulates itself by readthrough transcription of hrpL
into hrpXYS [62].
It has been proposed that in E. amylovora, both HrpY and
HrpS regulate hrpL, encoding the master regulator of T3SS,
and that the effects of HrpY and HrpS are additive [18].
Subsequent studies of P. stewartii subsp. stewartii, D.
dadantii, and Pantoea herbicola pv. gyposophilae have demonstrated that HrpY initially activates hrpS by binding to
its promoter, and then the HrpL is activated by HrpS as
well as by other regulatory genes [39,63]. Furthermore, it
has been reported that HrpY in D. dadantii acts as both a
positive and negative regulator [39]. In P. stewartii subsp.
stewartii, besides the HrpY binding site, additional
sequences further upstream of the hrpS promoter are also
required for hrpS expression, suggesting that unknown
regulatory proteins may act cooperatively with HrpY [63].
Microarray studies suggest that hrpL represents only one
branch of the regulatory pathways downstream of hrpRS,
and a large number of genes regulated by HrpRS are hrpLindependent in P. syringae [64]. In our study, HrpX, HrpY,
and HrpS also act as negative regulators, as hrpX, hrpY,
hrpXY, and hrpXYS mutants produce more amylovoran.
Our virulence tests suggest that the T3SS remains functional in hrpX, hrpY, and hrpXY deletion mutants, but not
in the hrpXYS mutant, whereby HrpS and HrpL may be
activated by other unknown regulators except that production and/or translocation of HrpN (Harpin) in
tobacco is severely attenuated as showed in an HR assay
(Figure S2A, [see Additional file 2]). It is possible that host
signals affecting gene expression may also be different in
tobacco.
Various models have proposed that HrpX senses environmental signals in the plant apoplast or the Hrp-inducing
medium to phosphorylate HrpY [18,34,35]. However,
domain structure analysis has indicated that HrpX is a soluble cytoplasmic protein, and may sense intracellular signals. This suggests that other signaling pathways may also
be involved in activating hrpXY, hrpS, or hrpL by sensing
outside signals to regulate T3SS. Since the expression of
HrpX, HrpS, and HrpL is regulated by low pH, also corresponding to conditions under which OmpR-EnvZ and
GrrS-GrrA are activated, our results further suggest that
both OmpR-EnvZ and GrrS-GrrA can regulate the hrpXY
operon or hrpS either directly or indirectly as reported in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/245

other plant pathogenic bacteria [10,28,33,34]. Further
studies are needed to dissect the roles of OmpR-EnvZ and
GrrS-GrrA in regulating T3SS.
Several regulatory genes have been previously reported to
control amylovoran biosynthesis in E. amylovora, including the Rcs system, RcsA, Lon protease, and H-NS protein
[17,50,65]. Here, we have further identified several groups
of regulators, including both negative and positive regulators. These regulators may form a network that governs
the production of amylovoran under different conditions
to benefit pathogen survival or pathogenesis. Regulatory
cascades are also likely to occur as global regulators such
as OmpR-EnvZ and GrrS-GrrA may control expression of
other regulatory genes or proteins, such as hrpXY and quorum sensing systems, as reflected in the amount of amylovoran produced in these mutants. However, we cannot
rule out that cross-talk between different TCSTs may further complicate this scenario. Our study indicates that regulation of amylovoran biosynthesis is highly complex and
further suggests that the pathogen has developed a system
to control this major virulence factor.
Swarming is a flagella-driven form of motility for movement across solid surfaces as a group [66-70]. Swarmer
cells are normally hyperflagellated and require extracellular components such as EPS and surfactants that enable
mass migration [71,72]. Previous studies have identified
several global regulators in Es. coli and in other bacteria,
including the Rcs system, OmpR and GrrSA, known to
influence flagella biosynthesis, especially the master regulator flhDC [71,73]. In this study, we have identified both
negative (GrrSA) and positive (EnvZ/OmpR) regulators of
swarming motility. It is easy to accept that the GacSA system may negatively regulate flagella biosynthesis, thus
rendering grrSA mutants hypermotile. It is also obvious
that flagella biosynthesis is not impaired in the envZ-ompR
mutants as the swarming phenotype is different between
the envZ-ompR mutants and the flhDC-fliA mutants. The
obvious question that arises as to why envZ-ompR mutants
are non-motile although they produce prolonged flagella.
A recent study in Salmonella typhimurium has reported that
mutations in chemotaxis pathways are impaired for
swarming motility and further revealed a role of flagellum
in sensing external wetness [72]. It has been proposed that
swarming requires a fluid environment generated as bacteria extract water from the underlying agar gel [74]. Flagella are designed to work in this aqueous environment;
that is swarming cells move in a thin layer of fluid over the
surface of the agar. Further studies have revealed that the
wetting agent that draws water out of the underlying agar
is an osmotic agent [74]. It is likely that in our envZ-ompR
mutants, this unknown osmotic agent provides a signal
for EnvZ-OmpR system that may regulate chemotaxis
response or creates high osmolarity so that water can be

Further studies are needed to clarify this hypothesis.

previously [80].

Conclusion

Construction of TCST mutants in E. amylovora by
Lambda-Red recombinase
E. amylovora stable mutants were generated by using the λ
phage recombinases as previously described [45-47].
Briefly, E. amylovora Ea1189 was transformed with plasmid pKD46 expressing recombinases redα, β, and γ. The
transformant Ea1189 (pKD46) was grown overnight at
28°C, reinoculated in LB broth containing 0.1% arabinose, and grown to exponential phase OD600= 0.8. Cells
were collected, made electrocomponent, and stored at 80°C. Recombination fragments consisting of a kanamycin (kan) or chloramphenical (cat) gene with its own promoter, flanked by a 50-nucleotide (nt) homology arm,
were generated by PCR using plasmid pKD13 or pKD3 as
a template. The primers used for generating mutants are
listed in Table S2 [see Additional file 1] (primers start with
B). To confirm mutants by PCR, primers (Table S2, [see
Additional file 1], primers start with Z), and internal
primer pairs km1 and km2 of the kan gene, cm1 and cm2
of the cat gene were used. For the resulting mutants, the
majority of the coding region of each gene was replaced by
the kan or cat gene, except for the first and last 50 nt. The
resulting mutants were designated and listed in Table 1
and Table 3.

In summary, we have identified and classified TCSTs, and
have systematically generated TCST deletion mutants in E.
amylovora. The mutants generated will serve as resources
for future exploration of TCSTs in E. amylovora. In-depth
characterization of deletion mutants and global gene
expression will be our next goal. Our current data provide
experimental evidence that TCSTs, especially those global
regulators such as the Rcs system, EnvZ-OmpR and GrrAGrrS, play important roles in virulence and in regulating
virulence factors such as amylovoran production and
swarming motility. These findings also suggest that multiple TCSTs may form complex and highly connected circuits and signaling networks in this important pathogen.

Methods
Bacterial stains and culture media
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed
in Table 4. The LB medium was used routinely for culturing E. amylovora. When necessary, the following antibiotics were added to the medium: 20 μg ml-1kanamycin and
chloramphenical, and 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin. Amylovoran production was determined by growing bacteria in
MBMA medium (3 g KH2PO4, 7 g K2HPO4, 1 g
[NH4]2SO4, 2 ml glycerol, 0.5 g citric acid, 0.03 g MgSO4)
amended with 1% sorbitol [52,75].
DNA manipulation and bioinformatic analysis
Plasmid DNA purification, PCR amplification of genes,
isolation of fragments from agarose gels, cloning, restriction enzyme digestion and T4 DNA ligation were performed using standard molecular procedures [76]. DNA
sequencing was performed at the Keck Center for Functional and Comparative Genomics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Sequence management and
contig assembly were conducted using Sequencher 4.9
software. Similarity searches of nucleic acid sequences and
proteins were conducted using the BLASTN and BLASTP
programs at NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST[77]. Protein domain organizations of the HKs and
RRs were identified by searching the CDD with Reverse
Specific Position BLAST [41] or the SMART program http:/
/smart.embl-heidelberg.de/[42]. Domain limits for proteins were also derived from the graphical output of the
SMART web interface. Transmembrane segments of HKs
were predicted by the TMHMM2 program http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/[78].
Multiple
sequence alignments of proteins were carried out using
Clustal ×1.80 [79]. Sequence logos were derived from
alignment of proteins belonging to corresponding HK
group and created by Weblogo http://weblogo.berke
ley.edu. Proteins without known domain were character-

Cloning genes/operon for complementation of TCST
mutants
For complementation of selected mutants, flanking
sequences of genes or operon were used to design primers
to amplify fragments of gene/or operon and their promoter sequences (Table S2, [see Additional file 1], primers
with gene name). Primer pairs, with or without restriction
sites were used to amplify corresponding DNA fragments
from E. amylovora WT strain which contains upstream and
downstream sequences of the gene or operon, and PCR
fragments were cloned into either pGEM T-easy vector
through A-T ligation or into a low-copy number vector
pWSK29. The final plasmids were listed in Table 4. For
primer pair with restriction site, DNA fragments and the
vector were both digested with corresponding enzymes
following amplification, and ligated together. All plasmids were introduced into E. amylovora strain by electroporation. Transformants were selected on LB plates
supplemented with Ap and Km or Cm. Their genotypes
were confirmed by both enzymatic digestion and
sequencing.
Construction of promoter-GFP fusions for gene expression
assays
For gene expression assays, flanking sequences of the
amsG ORF were used to design primers to amplify DNA
fragments. Primer pairs amsG1-amsG2 with restriction

sites were used to amplify 721 bp DNA fragments from E.
amylovora WT strain, containing promoter sequences of
amsG gene. PCR products and the promoter trapping vector pFPV25 were both digested with BamH1 and EcoRI for
amsG gene. The resulting fragments were gel-purified,
ligated together, and cloned to the upstream of promoterless gfp gene. The final plasmids were designated as
pWDP4 for amsG, and were confirmed by restriction
enzyme digestion and sequencing.
Immature pear virulence assays
For E. amylovora WT and mutant strains, bacterial suspensions were grown overnight in LB broth, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.5 × sterile phosphate
buffered-saline (PBS) with bacterial cells adjusted to concentrations of ~1 × 103 to 1 × 104 colony-forming units
(CFU/μl) (OD600 = 0.1 and then diluted 100 times) in
PBS. Immature fruits of pear (Pyrus communis L. cv. 'Bartlett') were surface-sterilized, and pricked with a sterile
needle as described previously [19,46]. Wounded fruits
were inoculated with 2 μl of cell suspensions, and incubated in a humidified chamber at 26°C. Symptoms were
recorded at 2, 4, 6, and 8 days post-inoculation.
CPC assay for determining amylovoran concentration
The amylovoran concentration in supernatants of bacterial cultures was quantitatively determined by a turbidity
assay with cetylpyrimidinium chloride (CPC), as previously described [50,52]. Briefly, for E. amylovora WT,

mutants, and complementation strains, bacterial suspensions were grown overnight in LB broth w/o appropriate
antibiotics, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with
PBS three times. After the final wash, the bacterial pellet
was resuspended in 200 μl PBS. A total of 100 μl of bacterial suspension was inoculated into 10 ml MBMA
medium with 1% sorbitol. One ml of bacterial cells was
pelleted two to three days after inoculation at 28°C with
shaking. Following centrifugation, 50 μl CPC at 50 mg ml1 was added to one ml supernatant. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the amylovoran concentration was determined by measuring OD600 turbidity. The
final concentration of amylovoran production was normalized for a cell density of 1.0. For each strain tested, the
experiment was repeated at least three times.
Swarming motility assay
For E. amylovora WT and mutant strains, bacterial suspensions were grown overnight in LB broth w/o appropriate
antibiotics, harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS
once, and resuspended in 200 μl PBS. Then, bacterial suspensions were diluted 10 × in water, and 5 μl of the
diluted bacterial suspension was plated onto the center of
swarming agar plates (10 g tryptone, 5 g NaCl, 3 g agar per
l Liter) as previously described [50,51]. Swarming diameters were determined following incubation at 28°C for up
to three days. The experiments were repeated at least three
times.

Statistical analysis
Amylovoran production and swarming motility data were
undertaken a one-way ANOVA and Student-NewmanKeuls test to determine differences in means (P = 0.05)
using SAS 9.1 program.
GFP reporter gene assay by flow cytometry
The BD FACSCanto flow cytometer was used to monitor
the GFP intensity of WT and mutant strains containing the
corresponding promoter-gfp construct [17]. For in vitro
amsG gene expression, WT and mutants containing the
amsG promoter-GFP fusion plasmid were grown in LB
overnight, harvested, and resuspended in water. Bacterial
suspensions were re-inoculated in MBMA broth with 1%
sorbitol and grown at 28°C with shaking for up to three
days. Bacterial cultures were then harvested by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and then resuspended in PBS
for flow cytometry assay. Flow cytometry was performed
on a BD LSRII 10 parameter multilaser analyzers (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). For both cases, data were collected
for a total of 100,000 events and statistically analyzed by
gating using flow cytometry software FCS Express V3 (De
Novo Software, LA, CA). A geometric mean was calculated
for each sample. Each treatment was performed in triplicate and each experiment was repeated three times.
