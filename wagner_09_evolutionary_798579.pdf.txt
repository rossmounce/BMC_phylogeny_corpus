Abstract
Background: Metabolic networks show great evolutionary plasticity, because they can differ
substantially even among closely related prokaryotes. Any one metabolic network can also
effectively compensate for the blockage of individual reactions by rerouting metabolic flux through
other pathways. These observations, together with the continual discovery of new microbial
metabolic pathways and enzymes, raise the possibility that metabolic networks are only weakly
constrained in changing their complement of enzymatic reactions.
Results: To ask whether this is the case, I characterized pairwise and higher-order associations in
the co-occurrence of genes encoding metabolic enzymes in more than 200 completely sequenced
representatives of prokaryotic genera. The majority of reactions show constrained evolution.
Specifically, genes encoding most reactions tend to co-occur with genes encoding other reaction(s).
Constrained reaction pairs occur in small sets whose number is substantially greater than expected
by chance alone. Most such sets are associated with single biochemical pathways. The respective
genes are not always tightly linked, which renders horizontal co-transfer of constrained reaction
sets an unlikely sole cause for these patterns of association.
Conclusion: Even a limited number of available genomes suffices to show that metabolic network
evolution is highly constrained by reaction combinations that are favored by natural selection. With
increasing numbers of completely sequenced genomes, an evolutionary constraint-based approach
may enable a detailed characterization of co-evolving metabolic modules.

Background
Evolutionary history can constrain future evolution. It can
constrain both the production and the preservation of
phenotypic variation [1-6]. For instance, the acquisition
of some traits may require the presence of other traits. To
take a metabolic example, the biosynthesis of steroid hormones uses cholesterol as its starting point and prerequisite [7]. Cholesterol, in turn is a eukaryotic invention.
Conversely, the loss of certain traits constrains future evo-

lution, because it may be difficult to reverse, as exemplified by the independent and irreversible loss of
planktonic feeding stages in multiple echinoderms [8].
The best-studied cases of constrained variation regard
macroscopic and readily observable organismal traits [9].
However, if one wants to study genetic contributions to
constrained variation, such traits are not ideal study
objects. This is because hundreds to thousands of genes

with often poorly understood interactions are typically
involved in forming any macroscopic trait. Such incomplete characterization of genotypes, and of how exactly
they produce phenotypes render genetic causes of constrained evolution difficult to understand for complex
traits.
This problem suggests that more tractable genetic systems,
where genotypic information is readily available, may be
a useful starting point to learn more about the extent and
pervasiveness of evolutionary constraints. Molecules such
as proteins and RNA are the best-studied such candidate
systems, but regulatory and metabolic networks are
increasingly accessible with the available of genome-scale
sequence and functional data [10-34]. Taken together, the
phenotypic diversity of molecules and the networks they
form is sufficiently rich to encapsulate the phenotypic
diversity of organismal traits. Especially for metabolic networks, significant amounts of information about network
genotypes and how they vary among species are available
[35-37].
Studies of evolutionary constraints as applied to DNA,
RNA, or protein sequences have a long history [38,39].
They show that most amino acid or nucleotide residues of
these molecules cannot vary freely, and that variation in
some residues is much more constrained than in others.
Only a minority of residues may be under weak or no constraint, for example those that cause silent changes in
lowly expressed proteins. We know less about evolutionary constraints for biological networks such as genomescale metabolic networks, despite intriguing experimental
observations that raise many questions about such constraints. Specifically, gene knockout experiments and
computational work [13,14,16,22,26,40-44] show that in
any one environment, many individual reactions of a
metabolic network are expendable. Even reactions in the
most central parts of metabolism, such as glycolysis or the
citric acid cycle may be dispensable [14]. One reason lies
in the distributed nature of metabolic systems, where several bypasses may exist around any blocked pathway.
Does that mean that metabolic networks are unconstrained, or only weakly constrained in changing their
complement of enzymatic reactions on evolutionary time
scales?
I will here ask this and related questions with data from
more than 200 prokaryotic genome-scale metabolic networks. Such networks are central to all life. They sustain it
by producing metabolic energy and biosynthetic precursors. The metabolic network of typical free-living heterotrophic organisms comprises of the order of 103 different
biochemical reactions [40,45,46]. These reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which are encoded by genes. Variation
in the structure of such a network occurs through either

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/231

mutational elimination of individual reactions (enzymecoding genes), or through addition of one or more reactions, for which horizontal gene transfer is a major mechanism in prokaryotes. Information about which reactions
are catalyzed in any one organism has been assembled
into various databases [36,37,47] through a combination
of manual curation and comparative genome analysis. For
example, the KEGG database whose data I use here contains information about the complement of enzymes
encoded in more than 600 completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes.
Can individual reactions in a metabolic network vary
independently from other such reactions? If so, what fraction of reactions can vary independently? If co-variation
among reactions occurs, does it affect pairs of enzymes or
larger groupings? Only a few years ago, these and similar
questions could not have been addressed, because the
number of completely sequenced genomes required for at
least a coarse metabolic annotation [36] was too small.
With genome-scale information for hundreds of organisms, such analysis is now becoming tractable.

Results
High diversity of metabolic networks
The elementary unit of evolutionary change in metabolic
networks is the individual chemical reaction catalyzed by
an enzyme that is encoded by a metabolic gene. Except
where mentioned otherwise, I here represent each such
reaction on the level of the gene, as represented by
orthologs of metabolic enzyme-coding genes in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg/; [36]). This representation
facilitates evolutionary analysis, because it is genes (and
not reactions) that undergo mutations, and that are
exchanged between organisms through horizontal gene
transfer.

Before studying constrained variation in individual reactions, it is useful to ask how diverse the composition of
different metabolic networks really is. Previous work
focused on different questions has assessed different
aspects of this diversity [29,48-51], but genome-scale data
about metabolic networks is accumulating so rapidly that
continued assessments are useful. I used metabolic network data from 648 prokaryotic species in KEGG. To
avoid biasing the analysis towards very closely related species, I focus for the rest of this contribution on one representative of each prokaryotic genus or 222 metabolic
networks in total (median number of 1057 reactions per
network). For each pair of these networks, I first determined how different their complement of chemical reactions was, by calculating the fraction D of reactions that
occurs in only one but not both of the two networks. (D =
1 for networks that share no reactions.) Figure 1 shows

Metabolic networks can show very distance composition
Metabolic networks can show very different composition that depends on their evolutionary distance. The
figure shows a histogram of the fraction D of reactions (represented by KEGG orthologs; [36]) that occur in only one
network of a pair of metabolic networks. The histogram is
based on all networks that occur in 222 prokaryotes with
completely sequenced genomes. Horizontal bars indicate
mean (center of bar) and one standard deviation (length of

above each bar (see Methods for details).

this distribution of D. Its large mean of D = 0.68 suggests
that two networks share on average only about one third
of their reactions. Superimposed on the distribution of
Figure 1 are data (horizontal bars) that indicate the mean
(center of bar) and standard deviation (length of bar) of
D for prokaryotic taxa that share a similar, broadly
defined habitat. Metabolic networks are not much less
diverse in these habitats than in the whole data set of metabolic networks. Even 13 different strains of E. coli show a
mean D = 0.36 (s. dev. σ = 31; median D = 0.25).
Many constrained reaction pairs
These observations suggest that metabolic networks are
very diverse in their complement of metabolic reactions,
even for organisms living in similar habitats. Together
with the resilience of such networks to elimination of
reactions [13,14,16,22,26,40-44], which indicate enormous plasticity in metabolic network organization in a
given environment, they raise the question whether the
evolution of such networks is perhaps only subject to
weak constraints. I first addressed this question on the
smallest level of evolutionary change, that of the individual reaction.

On this level, evolution would be unconstrained for any
one reaction, if the occurrence of the reaction in a meta-

bolic network can vary independently of other reactions.
The most-straightforward way to assess this kind of constraint is to study statistical associations among all pairs of
reactions. To this end, I applied an exact binomial test to
the 1.35 × 107 possible pairs of the 5188 reactions found
in the 222 networks I studied. This test determines
whether two reactions occur jointly in these networks
more often than expected by chance alone. Among several
approaches to account for multiple testing [52,53], I here
choose the (highly conservative) Bonferroni correction,
focusing on reaction pairs with P-values below a Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.05, i.e., P = 0.05/(1.35 × 107) = 3.7 ×
10-9. Figure 2a shows the proportion of reactions that are
associated with at least one other reaction according to
this test, at a P-value exceeding the value shown on the
horizontal axis. The figure shows that about half of reactions are associated with some other reaction at the Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.05. Individual reaction pairs can
have P-values as high as10-35. It is important to note, however, that the association of two reactions, that is, their cooccurrence in the same genome, is rarely perfect. This is
illustrated in Figure 2b, which shows for all associated
reaction pairs, as a function of P-value the mean (± one
standard deviation) fraction of genomes that encode only
one but not the other reaction. For any constrained reaction pair, a value of 0.5 would mean that half of the examined genomes encode one but not both reactions. The
figure shows that the fraction of genomes encoding only
one reaction is greater than 20 percent except for the most
highly constrained reaction pairs.
The same kind of test can also be used to ask whether
there are pairs of reactions that tend to "avoid" each other,
that is, whether a network that harbors one reaction tends
not to harbor the other reaction. Such reaction pairs exist,
but their numbers are much smaller. Specifically, fewer
than five percent of reactions show such a negative association among genomes at the Bonferroni-corrected P =
0.05, and no reaction pair shows a P-value smaller than
10-17 (Figure 2a). In sum, these associations suggest that a
substantial fraction of reactions covary extensively with
other reactions.
Many constrained reaction sets
In any metabolic network, the production of important
metabolites for biomass production requires the cooperation of multiple reactions. This observation calls for an
extension of the above reaction-centered approach to
larger units. Co-occurrence of reaction sets would suggest
joint constrained evolution and joint requirement for key
metabolic processes. A substantial technical problem to
identifying such sets is the astronomical number of possible combinations (triples, quadruples, and so forth) of
reactions, which renders an exhaustive evaluation infeasible. To circumvent this problem, I take the following

Many reactions show constrained pairwise evolution
Many reactions show constrained pairwise evolution. a) The horizontal axis shows the negative decadic P-value of the
statistical association of two reactions, as determined by an exact binomial test (see Methods). The left vertical axes shows the
proportion of reactions that are positively associated, that is, that co-occur more often than expected by chance alone. The
right vertical axis shows reactions with negative associations, reactions that occur less often together than expected by chance
alone. Note the difference in scale for the two vertical axes. The Bonferroni-corrected value of P = 0.05 (0.05/(1.35 × 107)) lies
at -log10(P) = 8.43. b) The vertical axis shows the mean and standard deviation (length of bars) of the number of genomes that
harbor only one but not both reactions of a positively associated reaction pair. Specifically, if two reactions are encoded by n1
and n2 genomes, and if n12 genomes encode both reactions, then the vertical axis shows the quantity 1-(n12/(n1+n2-n12)), averaged over all reaction pairs whose P-value lies in a given range (horizontal axis).

graph-theoretic approach. I define a reaction constraint
graph whose nodes are individual reactions. Two reactions
are connected by an undirected edge in this graph if one
of the reactions is associated with another reaction in the
pairwise assay above, at a P-value that lies below a given
threshold. A connected component in this graph is
defined as a set of reactions that shows pairwise associations among set members, but where no reaction is associated with other reactions outside the set. (I eliminate
isolated reactions, that is, components of size one from
this graph.) Such connected components can be thought
of as sets of constrained or co-occurring reactions, and
their identification is the target of this part of my analysis.
The size and number of components of the reaction constraint graph may vary, depending on which P-value
threshold is used to define the graph. At a high threshold
(low required statistical significance), the graph may consist only of one or few large components that comprise
most reactions, whereas at lower thresholds, the graph
may fragment into multiple components of decreasing
size that indicate increasingly strongly associated sets of
reactions. To have a frame of reference, I compared the
structure of this graph at any given threshold to that of a
randomized graph. This randomized graph was generated
from the original reaction association graph through
swapping of edge pairs (see Methods), which leaves the
number of edges, and the number of edges per node constant, but randomizes the graph in other respects. More
specifically, I generated 20 such randomized graphs and
characterized the component size distributions of each of
these graphs.
Figure 3a shows that at even low P-values, the reaction
constraint graph fragments into many constrained reaction sets. Specifically, even at a P-value close to the Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.05, this graph has 202 such sets,
with a mean number of 9.6 (standard deviation 89.3; Figure 3b) reactions per set, and a wide variation from 120
sets with only 2 reactions to one large component with
1271 reactions (Figure 3c). Over most of the P-value range
explored, the number of constrained reaction sets is
orders of magnitudes larger than the corresponding
number in randomized graphs. For example, at the Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.05, randomized constraint graphs
have on average 50-fold fewer components (mean 3.85
components; standard deviation σ = 1.03). The number of
constrained reaction sets declines in randomized graphs,
but not in the actual reaction constraint graph, where it
increases with decreasing P-value to a peak of 241 such
sets (at P = 10-10.5) and then declines steadily. Figure 4
shows the distribution of the number of constrained reaction sets for the P-value where the number of such sets is
the largest (P = 10-10.5). At other P-values, this distribution
is qualitatively similar. Clearly, the overwhelming majority of reactions are associated in small sets of two, three,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/231

or four reactions, and there are only few larger reaction
sets. The mean and maximal component sizes are generally smaller for the actual randomized reaction constraint
graph than for randomized graphs (Figure 3b and 3c). The
mean number of reactions per set, as well as the size of the
largest sets decline with increasing P for both the actual
and the randomized graphs (Figures 3b and 3c).
Constrained reaction sets and metabolic pathways
In sum, sets of evolutionary constrained reactions are typically small, much smaller than would be expected if reaction associations were distributed randomly across
metabolic networks. These observations raise the question
whether the constrained sets of reactions are largely congruent with traditional classifications of metabolic pathways. To address this question, I took advantage of the
biochemical pathway classification of reactions in KEGG
[36]. For any constrained reaction set as defined above, I
determined the fraction of all reaction pairs that are
assigned to the same metabolic pathway. For those reaction sets at the Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.05 where reactions can be assigned to individual pathways, all reaction
pairs within a set can be assigned to the same pathway for
almost 90% (124/139) of sets. More than half of the
remaining few (15) reaction sets have between four and
1271 reactions, and are thus biased towards larger reaction sets. For more tightly associated reaction sets (very
small P-values), this bias towards constrained reactions in
the same pathway increases. For example, at P = 10-15 and
P = 10-20, respectively 92% (127/138) and 96.6% (85/88)
constrained reaction sets belong in one pathway. In sum,
individual reactions for most constrained reaction sets can
be allocated to the same pathway.
Specific examples: Top 15 reactions
Table 1 shows the 15 most highly constrained reaction
sets, that is, those sets with the smallest P-value. The negative decadic logarithm of this P-value is indicated in column 1 from the left. All of the reaction sets in the Table
have P < 10-16. Column 2 shows the number of reactions
in each set. In keeping with the skewed distribution of
reaction set sizes (Figure 4), most sets have size two, and
only few sets are larger. Column 3 shows either the metabolic pathway a reaction set belongs to, or the individual
reactions where this pathway annotation is unknown or
highly ambiguous. Most constrained reaction sets have a
clear pathway affiliation, and only few sets involve proteins of unknown or poorly characterized function. The
sets also occur in a great diversity of pathways, including
amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate biosynthesis, and
butanoate metabolism. Noteworthy is that several cofactor biosyntheses appear among the most highly constrained reaction sets They include the synthesis pathways
of cobalamin (vitamin B12); biotin (vitamin H or B7), a
cofactor in fatty acid and leucine biosynthesis, and pyr-

The same causes may also explain the conspicuous

reactions in life. Central carbon metabolism is highly
reticulate, with many alternative metabolic routes for
missing reactions [17], which may lead to fewer highly

coenzymes have a complex molecular structure and complex biosynthetic pathways that are not situated at the
center of an organism's metabolic network, but rather at
the periphery. For these reasons they are often less reticulate than the most central parts of metabolism, with fewer
alternative routes between metabolic intermediates. This
may be the very reason why they are highly constrained:

Specific examples: Histidine degradation
I will next focus on those reaction sets in Table 1 that
involve more than just two reactions, and where the
respective pathway is well-characterized. The first set (row
one of Table 1) contains the first three reactions in the
degradation of histidine to glutamate, a pathway that is
responsible for the utilization of histidine, and that ultimately feeds into the citric acid cycle. (Figure 5a). Each of
the reactions occurs in between 84 and 95 of the studied
genomes. Together they form a highly significant reaction
set (P < 10-23 for each of the three possible reaction pairs),
whose congruence in genomic association is nearly perfect. Figure 5b illustrates this association with a 16S
rDNA-based phylogenetic tree of the analyzed species
and, along the circumference of this tree, color-coded bars
that indicate the presence or absence of each reaction. For
example, the topmost two reactions of Figure 5a occur in
84 and 85 genomes, respectively, and 83 of these genomes
encode both reactions. The tree also shows that most
genomes encode either all three reactions or none of
them. Moreover, the species encoding these reactions are

Three highly constrained reactions (P < 10-20) in the histidine utilization pathway. a) shows the three first reactions
of the histidine utilization pathway, color-coded to help visualize their occurrence in b), which displays a 16S rDNA-based
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, visualized by ITOL [101], of the bacterial species analyzed here. Bars along the circumference of the tree indicate whether a specific reaction (as indicated by the bar's color) is encoded by a genome or not. Bars
containing two or more colors indicate that the respective reactions are encoded in two or more genomes. Note that most
bars contain all three colors, indicating that the respective genomes encode all three reactions. c) shows the distance in kilobase pairs and d) the number of genes intervening between genes encoding histidine ammonia lyase and imidazolone propionase in the studied genomes. The bimodality of the distributions in c) and d) is similar for the other reaction pairs (not shown),
with a bias towards tightly linked genes. The fourth reaction (formiminoglutamase) shown in a) is not part of a highly constrained reaction set significant at P < 10-20. However, it is associated with the remainder of the pathway. For example, it is
associated with the imidazolonepropionase reaction preceding it at P < 10-8. Whereas 84 genomes encode imidazolonepropionase, only 38 of them encode a known ortholog of formiminoglutamase, which is responsible for the weaker association. (37 of
these 38 genomes also encode the imidazolonepropionase reaction.)

scattered throughout the tree, which reflects a broad range
of both bacterial and archaeal taxa. This suggests that the
association among these reactions is no artefact of their
vertical co-inheritance among lineages represented on the
tree. This is confirmed by a matched pair test [54,55],
which can take the structure of a phylogenetic tree in association testing into account (association significant at P <
2.3 × 10-13, for each of the three reaction pairs).
I next asked whether constrained gene pairs in this set are
always tightly linked, which might indicate that they are
always transferred jointly. Figure 5c shows a histogram of
the distance between the genes encoding the first and
third reaction in the pathway of Figure 5a, for all genomes
that encode both of these reactions. Figure 5d shows an
analogous histogram for the distance in terms of the
number of intervening genes. Perhaps the most striking
feature of this distribution is its bimodality. That is, a substantial fraction of gene pairs seems to be tightly linked,
with a distance of fewer than 10 kilo base pairs and fewer
than 10 intervening genes, but an equally substantial fraction is loosely linked or unlinked, with more than 100
kbp and hundreds of genes in between them. The tightly
linked gene pairs likely reflect the well-known organization of histidine utilization genes into one or two linked
operons, which has been observed for some organisms
[56-58]. The existence of many unlinked gene pairs suggests that not all of the covariation of these genes can be
explained through constrained variation. Bimodial distributions (not shown) are also observed for the other two
reaction pairs analyzed in Figure 5a.
Specific examples: Cobalamin, PQQ, and inositol
metabolism
A second example (row 7 in Table 1) concerns cobalamin
(vitamin B12), one of the most complex biogenic small
molecules. Its biosynthesis is restricted to prokaryotes
[59]. The last four reactions of this biosynthesis include
the assembly of the major parts of the molecule into the
final molecule [59]. These reactions form a highly significant association cluster (P < 10-17 for each pair). The genes
encoding these four reactions occur in between 92 and 98
of the examined genomes, and every pair of genes cooccurs in at least 82 genomes. Figure 6b shows that most
taxa have either all or none of these genes, which are
broadly distributed across the phylogeny, and not
restricted to specific clades. (All pairwise associations are
significant in a matched pair test at P < 9.1 × 10-13). As for
histidine biosynthesis, the distance distributions of genes
encoding cobalamin biosynthesis genes are bimodal, as
shown in Figures 6c and 6d for the second and fourth
reaction. Other reaction pairs also show bimodality in the
distance distribution of their encoding genes (not
shown). Individual reactions can but do not always cooccur in operons [59].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/231

The remaining most highly constrained reaction sets of
size greater than two occur in PQQ synthesis (3 reactions
in 23-25 genomes; P < 10-18), whose reactions are poorly
characterized, and in the catabolism of myo-inositol (4
reactions in 26-30 genomes; P < 10-17). As opposed to
eukaryotes, where inositol derivatives have signaling
roles, in prokaryotes they serve structural roles as membrane anchors of proteins and glycolipods, and they can
aid the infectivity of pathogens [60]. Myo-inositol can
also serve as sole carbon source for several microorganisms [61]. The reactions in question catalyze four consecutive steps in a pathway that converts myo-inositol into
acetyl-CoA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (KEGG pathway identifier: ko00562). In these last two examples, too
few genomes contain the reactions to carry out a meaningful statistical analysis of the genomic distance distribution, but I note that also here, some of the genes encoding
individual enzyme pairs are not closely linked (not
shown).
This pattern, where constrained enzyme-coding gene pairs
are not necessarily tightly linked, holds not only for the
examples I just discussed. It holds much more generally,
even for the most highly constrained pairs. Figure 7 shows
the distribution of the mean distance between genes
encoding constrained reaction pairs, either in kilo base
pairs (Figure 7a) or in the number of intervening genes
(Figure 7b) for pairs significant at P < 10-20. Although the
distribution displays a distinct peak at short distances, it
also makes clear that most genes are hundreds to thousands of kilo base pairs apart and are separated by hundreds of intervening genes. Such widely separated genes
are likely to be transferred individually, not jointly. Thus,
variational constraints may not be solely responsible for
the constrained evolution of metabolic reactions.
Specific examples: reactions with negative associations
A final class of examples comes from the (small) set of
negative pairwise associations, where the occurrence of
one reaction in a genome implies that the other reaction
is absent. One might think that such associations might
reflect alternative metabolic routes, where one route
might exclude the presence of the other route in an organism, but this is not so. Earlier steps of cobalamin biosynthesis than those shown in Figure 6 provide an example.
Specifically, the biosynthesis of adenosyl cobyrinate from
precorrin 2 occurs according to two different routes, one
that requires oxygen and another that does not [59]. However, sets of reactions in this and other alternate pathways
are not generally negatively associated (results not
shown). Instead, the strongest negative associations
involve different individual enzymes that can carry out
the same or similar reactions, and that show non-overlapping distributions among genomes. One example concerns two similar forms of the final reaction in the

cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, color-coded to help visualize their occurrence in b), which displays a 16S rDNA-based maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the bacterial species analyzed here. Bars along the circumference of the tree indicate
whether a specific reaction (as indicated by the bar's color) occurs in a genome or not. Bars containing two or more colors
indicate that two or more reactions occur in a given species. Note that most bars contain all four colors, indicating that the
respective genomes encode all three reactions. Gene symbols 'Cob*' in a) reflect names of genes known to catalyze these reactions in aerobes [36,59]. c) shows the distance in kilobase pairs, and d) the number of genes intervening between the second
and fourth reaction from a) in the studied genomes. The bimodality of this distribution is similar for the other reaction pairs

Both experimental and computational work shows that
metabolic networks vary greatly in their organization. For
example, earlier work on the organization of the citric acid
cycle in 19 completely sequenced microbes showed that
almost every organism encodes a different subset of the
cycle's reactions [50]. Given the centrality of this cycle in
energy metabolism, this variability is especially remarkable. The genome-scale analysis of multiple metabolic networks from Figure 1 highlights such variability. It shows
that metabolic networks are highly diverse in their reaction content. In addition, metabolic networks can be
quite resilient to elimination of individual reactions in
any given environment [13,14,16,22,26,40-44], partly
because the blocked reactions can readily be bypassed
through alternative metabolic routes. Furthermore, new
metabolic pathways and reactions continue to be discovered [63,64]. Taken together, these observations raise the

(Figure 8). Orthologs of the genes encoding these reactions occur in most examined genomes, but in an almost
non-overlapping pattern (P < 10-12): Only four genomes
contain orthologs for both reactions (Figure 8). Similar
patterns of negative association occur for other enzymes,
including a FAD (flavine adenine dinucletide)-dependent
and FAD-independent thymidilate synthase (P < 10-13,
[62,63]), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the DNA
building block dTMP, as well as two homoserine kinases
(P < 10-12) and two prephenate dehydrogenases (P < 1011). There are also several strong negative associations of
unknown biological significance, such as that of the DNA
mismatch repair protein MutS2 (KEGG ortholog identifier K02339) and the DNA polymerase holoenzyme subunit χ (K07456), which occur in 171 genomes but in only
one of them jointly (P < 10-15).

possibility that there are so many different ways of organizing the flow of matter through a metabolic network -many of which still unknown -- that individual reactions
may only be weakly constrained in their evolution. In this
view, the mutational elimination of any one reaction
might be readily compensated by an alternative metabolic
route that is either already present in the genome or can
be readily transferred into the genome through horizontal
transfer.
In contrast to this scenario, the merely 222 genomes studied here suffice to show that the majority of reactions are
indeed highly constrained in their evolution. This is indicated by their statistically significant co-occurrence with
other reactions in constrained reaction pairs. The genes in
such a pair are not always tightly linked, which renders
horizontal co-transfer of constrained reaction sets an
unlikely sole cause for these patterns of association. Constrained reaction pairs can be grouped into small sets
whose number is substantially greater than would be
expected if the same number of associations occurred
among randomly chosen reaction pairs in a metabolic
network. The reactions in a set typically belong to the
same biochemical pathway(s). Despite the distributed
nature of metabolic networks, where perturbations in one
part of a large network can be compensated through
changes in other, superficially remote parts, clearly identifiable constrained reaction sets exist, and are usually
highly localized. These observations are consistent with
earlier observations of modular structures in metabolic
(and other) networks [29,51,65-73]. For example [70]
focused on the identification of conserved modules in
metabolic pathways, and showed that many such modules exist, have a skewed size distribution, and may be
hierarchically organized.
In the bioinformatics community, questions regarding the
modular organization of biological networks have
attracted significant attention, unlike the topic of evolutionary constraints. In contrast, whether evolutionary
constraints exist, and how pervasive they are has been an
important and controversial topic in evolutionary biology. Standard textbooks [1] would discuss these questions
extensively. This paper is complementary to earlier work
from the bioinformatics community [29,51,65-73], not
only in approach, but also by focusing on the concept of
evolutionary constraints. It points to the fertile ground
that data on molecular networks can provide for the analysis of such constraints.
In the evolutionary biology literature, constraints are
hardly ever absolute. Classical examples include the tetrapod limb, which has mostly five digits, although ichthyosaurs had more; the lower jaw of frogs, which generally

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/231

lacks teeth, except for the genus Gastrotheca [1]. Constraints are thus best viewed as statistical biases in the
occurrence or co-occurrence of traits (here: chemical reactions). For metabolic networks, the reason behind the lack
of absolute constraints are easily explained: Matter can
flow along many alternative routes through a metabolic
network. A reaction in a constrained reaction set whose
presence is be essential in one metabolic network, may be
dispensable in another, because its role can be assumed
by other reactions. Statistical analyses like mine help
avoid the opposite extreme of assuming maximal flexibility, because they show that network reactions show constrained evolution.
The tightly constrained evolution of many reaction sets
raises a question about the causes of these constraints.
Specifically, is it caused merely by natural selection favoring certain reaction combinations, or do metabolic reactions also co-vary in their transfer from bacterium to
bacterium? An important source of variation in metabolic
and other networks is horizontal gene transfer [21,74-82].
In such transfer, immediately adjacent genes are more
likely to be transferred together in any one transfer event
than more distantly related genes. For example, a study on
horizontal transfer among five different E. coli species
showed that the majority of transfer events involved fewer
than 15 kilo base pairs of DNA [83]. Tight linkage of genes
thus introduces a constraint, in addition to any constraint
imposed by selection, because linked genes are not transferred independently of one another. Selection may of
course itself be the ultimate cause of such tight linkage,
because tight linkage may allow beneficial coregulation or
co-transfer of genes [84-88]. In the latter case, selection's
preference of certain gene combinations may have caused
variation in these gene combinations itself to become
constrained. In other words, if certain reaction combinations are favorable, then the genes involved in them might
become tightly linked over time.
I asked how important gene linkage is in constraining
reaction evolution by examining the most highly constrained reaction pairs and how closely together their
encoding genes are linked in a genome. Not surprisingly,
the results show clear evidence that some such linkage
occurs. However, there are also many cases where linkage
is not likely to be solely responsible for constrained variation. The reason is that covarying metabolic genes are
often unlinked in many genomes in which they occur.
This observation is in line with previous work [89], which
suggested that gene clusters and operons are highly
dynamic on an evolutionary time scale. They form and
disintegrate readily, and their constituent genes are sometimes tightly linked, sometimes scattered throughout the
genome [84,86,89,90].

Horizontal gene transfer is perhaps the most rapidly acting form of change in prokaryotic metabolic networks,
because it can introduce multiple new genes into a
genome on short evolutionary time scales. However, metabolic networks can change also without such horizontal
transfer, albeit on longer time scales. Aside from the mutational loss of reactions (which may be slow for reactions
in a highly constrained reaction set), new enzymes can be
created through gene duplication and subsequent
sequence divergence, as well as through recombination
and shuffling of domains and exons [91-94]. Such processes are the source of new enzymatic reactions that can
then be "shared" among organisms through horizontal
transfer. Their successful transfer will depend on whether
reactions of in the same constrained reaction set are cotransferred, or are already present in the new host.
Current limitations of any statistical approach to analyze
constrained evolution of metabolic networks include the
limited number of available genomes. With hundreds of
genomes at hand, such statistical characterization is
beginning to be meaningful, but it is unlikely to resolve
the fine-structure of such associations, for example by distinguishing more conserved from less conserved pathways
with any confidence. The observation that some 20 percent of reactions appear to be unconstrained (Figure 2a)
may be explicable through this limitation. Some reactions
occur only in few of the 222 genomes I studied, and to
preserve a meaningful statistical analysis, I excluded reaction pairs whose reactions occurred in fewer than five
genomes. The further the number of genomes that contain each reaction in a pair deviates from this lower limit,
the more readily a statistical test can reveal constraints.
Thus, the number of apparently unconstrained reaction
pairs will undoubtedly decrease as the number of completely sequenced genomes increases. It may well decrease
to zero. Similarly, metabolic databases contain annotation errors. Their numbers are unknown, and their presence is a source of noise for such statistical analyses. Their
incidence will undoubtedly decrease, as more genomes
become sequenced and analyzed comparatively.
A second limitation comes from a particular class of
potential network misannotation. A reaction can be catalyzed by an enzyme that is unrelated in sequence to any
other known enzyme catalyzing this reaction. If so, then
identification of metabolic network composition based
on genome-sequence alone would miss the reaction. This
is an example of convergent or parallel protein evolution,
and has also been called orthologous gene replacement.
For example, 5 out of 14 reactions in the citric acid cycle
were reported to be subject to non-orthologous displacement [50]. (The respective genes are now all represented
in KEGG). Unfortunately, manual curation of metabolic
reactions becomes impractical in surveys of many metabolic networks. The problem is of unknown magnitude. It

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/231

also will be alleviated only with time, as more unrelated
enzymes encoding the same reactions are discovered.
Thirdly, the occurrence of particular pathways in data
such as that of Table 1 depends on pathway annotation,
and in particular on pathway size. Complex pathways
with many reactions are more likely to harbor constrained
reaction sets than small pathways with few reactions,
merely by virtue of their larger size. In addition, different
databases may contain somewhat different pathway
annotations. Because of the dangers of overinterpreting
constraints in particular pathways, I thus here focus only
on more generic features, namely whether the reactions in
a constrained set occur in the same pathway.
A final limitation is that the constrained reaction sets I
analyze have evolved in the context of a phylogeny, but
that statistical analysis neglects this evolutionary history.
Some phylogenetic methods have been developed to
address correlations caused by shared evolutionary history for phenotypic and sequence data [95]. Aside from
their various limitations [95,96], such methods would
have limited applicability to the microbial genomes that I
study. First, most such methods require either an implicit
or explicit model of character (here: reaction) evolution.
Multiple such models exist for sequence data, because
enormous amounts of such data exist that can inform
these models. In contrast, such models do not yet exist for
metabolic network evolution. Second, and more importantly, extensive horizontal transfer -- in particular of metabolic genes [75,78,83] -- obscures evolutionary history,
which can differ greatly among reactions. If, for example,
even genomes as closely related as those of different
Escherichia coli strains differ in more than a megabasepair
of sequence [83] and some 25% of metabolic reactions,
then existing methods are surely inadequate for more distantly related species. Visual inspection and manual analysis is feasible for a small number of examples like those I
study (Figures 5, 6, 8), but not for large numbers of constrained reaction sets. We sorely need new methods to
incorporate evolutionary history and horizontal gene
transfer into the analysis of genome-scale metabolic data
sets.

Conclusion
Despite the great apparent flexibility of metabolic networks suggested by gene knockout studies, and despite
considerable network differences among closely related
species, most individual reactions are not free to vary
independently of other reactions. The discrepancy
between these two observations can be resolved if one
considers that the environment plays a crucial role in
determining the effect of changing a network's reactions.
Environmental variation is difficult to account for comprehensively in gene knockout studies, and its extent is
often unknown for different species.

Methods
16S rDNA data and phylogenetic analysis. All publicly
available complete prokaryotic genome sequences were
obtained in December 2008 from the National Center for
Biotechnology
Information
(NCBI;
http://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes). One 16S rDNA sequence was
extracted from the genbank file for each genome. 16S
rDNA sequences were aligned using the NAST (Nearest
Alignment Space Termination) algorithm, as implemented in a web server specifically designed to align 16S
rDNA sequences (http://greengenes.lbl.gov; [97]). Pairwise 16S rDNA nucleotide divergence was calculated from
this multiple alignment as the fraction of (non-gap) characters that differ between two sequences. A prokaryotic
16S rDNA maximum-likelihood tree was constructed
using the package phyml [98], with the HasegawaKishino-Yano [99] substitution model, where the transition-transversion ratio and the proportion of variable sites
were estimated from the data. To accommodate variable
substitution rates among sites, I allowed for four different
substitution rates and estimated the parameter of the
gamma distribution determining the rate variation from
the data. A tree generated by neighbor joining [100] was
used as the starting tree to be refined by the maximum
likelihood algorithm. ITOL [101] was used for tree visualization.
Environmental data
NCBI provides a broad classification of habitat types for
completely
sequenced
prokaryotes
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi. From this
classification, I identified 10 anaerobic aquatic species, 17
aerobic terrestrial species, 24 thermophilic species, and 8
moderate halophilic species for which complete genome
sequences and metabolic network information were available. In addition, I identified seven completely sequenced
marine prokaryotic species from the Marine Microbiology
Initiative
http://www.moore.org/microgenome/strainlist.aspx with metabolic network information in KEGG.
The horizontal bars in Figure 1 are based on these sets of
species.
Exact binomial test
If two reactions R1 and R2 occur in n1 and n2 networks,
such that n1 ≥ n2, and if R2 occurs independently from R1,
then the number of metabolic networks harboring both
R1 and R2 can be modeled as a binomially distributed random variable X with parameters n1 and p, where p is simply the total fraction of networks that harbor R2. To assess
whether R2 co-occurs with R1 to a significantly greater
extent than expected by chance alone, one can determine
the probability P(X ≥ n12), where n12 is the observed
number of networks that harbor both R1 and R2. If P(X ≥
n12) is smaller than a pre-determined significance threshold (e.g., P = 0.05) then the association of the two reac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/231

tions is deemed significant. If n1 ≤ n2, then the test is
carried out with reversed roles of the two reactions R1 and
R2. This test essentially asks if the less frequent of two reactions is significantly associated with the more frequent
one. An exactly analogous test can be carried out to determine whether two reactions co-occur significantly less
often than expected by chance alone. Specifically, values
of 1- P(X ≥ n12) that are smaller than a predetermined significance threshold would indicate reaction pairs with a
tendency to not occur in the same metabolic network. In
applications of these tests, I restricted myself to reaction
pairs R1 and R2 where genes encoding these reactions
occur in at least 5 genomes.
Reaction constraint graph analysis
A reaction constraint graph is a graph whose nodes are
reactions, and where two reactions are connected by an
edge if the statistical significance of their pairwise association falls below a given significance threshold. To randomize such a graph, I used an edge swapping algorithm
[102] that preserves each node's number of neighbors and
the node's degree distribution. This algorithm first
chooses two edges e1 and e2 at random that do not share
any nodes. It then reconnects e1 such that its source node
becomes linked to the target node of e2, and e2 such that
its source node becomes linked to the target node of e1. I
iterate this algorithm 2E times, where E is the total
number of edges in the graph, to yield one randomized
reaction graph. All results for random reaction graphs
reported here are based on 20 randomized graphs for each
significance threshold. To evaluate whether members of a
constrained reaction set can be assigned to the same pathway, I first determined for each pair of members of this set
whether they share at least one KEGG pathway annotation. I then calculated the fraction of pairs in the set for
which this was the case.
Distance of orthologs encoding associated reactions
For any two gene pairs that show a statistically significant
association, I identified the names of all known orthologs
of genes encoding these reactions from the KEGG "ko" file
(available at ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/genes/;[36]). I
then searched for the respective genes and their genomic
position in the annotated genbank genome sequence files
available at http://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes. In those
cases where one genome contains more than one ortholog
encoding the same reaction, I calculated pairwise distances for each of these orthologs separately, and include
these distances in the distributions reported here.
