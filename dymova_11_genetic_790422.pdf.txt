Abstract
Background: A persistent increase of tuberculosis cases has recently been noted in the Ukraine. The reported
incidence of drug-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis is growing steadily; however, data on the genetic variation of
isolates of M. tuberculosis circulating in northern Ukraine and on the spectrum and frequency of occurrence of
mutations determining resistance to the principal anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampicin have not yet
been reported.
Methods: Isolates of M. tuberculosis from 98 tuberculosis patients living in Kharkiv Oblast (Ukraine) were analyzed
using VNTR- and RFLP-IS6110-typing methods. Mutations associated with resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid
were detected by RFLP-PCR methods, and also confirmed by sequencing.
Results: We identified 75 different genetic profiles. Thirty four (34%) isolates belonged to the Beijing genotype and
23 (23%) isolates belonged to the LAM family. A cluster of isolates belonging to the LAM family had significant
genetic heterogeneity, indicating that this family had an ancient distribution and circulation in this geographical
region. Moreover, we found a significant percentage of the isolates (36%) belonged to as yet unidentified families
of M. tuberculosis or had individual non-clustering genotypes. Mutations conferring rifampicin and isoniazid
resistance were detected in 49% and 54% isolates, respectively. Mutations in codon 531 of the rpoB gene and
codon 315 of the katG gene were predominant among drug-resistant isolates. An association was found for
belonging to the LAM strain family and having multiple drug resistance (R = 0.27, p = 0.0059) and also for the
presence of a mutation in codon 531 of the rpoB gene and belonging to the Beijing strain family (R = 0.2, p =
0.04).
Conclusions: Transmission of drug-resistant isolates seems to contribute to the spread of resistant TB in this oblast.
The Beijing genotype and LAM genotype should be seen as a major cause of drug resistant TB in this region.

Background
Tuberculosis remains to this day the most widespread
infectious disease in many parts of the world and has
high mortality rate. Among the estimated 9 million new
cases that are annually recorded, antibiotic drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become an
increasing problem. The appearance of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB and, more recently, of extensively drugresistant (XDR)-TB is an actual threat to achieve TB
control and elimination. Each year over 400,000 new
cases of MDR-TB occur and, in every setting XDR cases

are recognized (although their number is currently
unknown) [1]. The use of molecular genetic methods to
analyze the population structure of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis has enabled data to be collected on the relationship between a specific genotype and its influence
on the course of disease [2,3] with the outcome of disease being determined to a large extent by the individual
characteristics of the patient and the genetic type of the
mycobacterium [4]. Different genotypic families of M.
tuberculosis have varying degrees of virulence eliciting
different immune responses [5], which can be manifested as increased abilities of individual genetic types to
acquire drug resistance. This can also affect the results
of diagnostic tests, e.g., the interferon-gamma T-cell test
[2,3].

Several researchers have shown a relationship between
the genotype of isolate, drug resistance, and the type of
genetic mutations responsible for the drug resistance.
Isolates of M. tuberculosis belonging to the Beijing strain
family are associated with drug resistance in Iran,
Afghanistan, and Russia [6-8]. Thus, a detailed study of
regional population structures of M. tuberculosis and
identification of the specific genotypes associated with
drug resistance can facilitate both a more effective drug
therapy regime and give information at the molecularepidemiological level.
A rapid determination of the resistance profile to antituberculosis drugs defines the choice of an effective drug
therapy regime. Molecular genetic methods for determining drug resistance of mycobacteria require minimum
time for completion of an analysis and are especially effective when access to a bacteriological laboratory is limited.
However, the use of these methods requires detailed information on the molecular mechanisms for developing drug
resistance and the spectrum of mutations causing resistance. The M. tuberculosis genome is exceptionally conserved with minimal horizontal transfer and an absence of
plasmids [9,10]. The acquisition of resistance is due to
mutations and deletions within the chromosome. These
chromosomal changes affect protein-binding structures
for the drug or the activity of enzymes that metabolize the
drug. Mutations and deletions in intergenic regions of the
genes katG, inhA, and oxyR-ahpC are known to cause
resistance to isoniazid. Resistance to rifampicin is most
often caused by different mutations and deletions in the
81 bp catalyst region of the rpoB gene that encodes the bsubunit of DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. These
aforementioned mutations are the principal modes of drug
resistance in M. tuberculosis.
A persistent increase of tuberculosis cases has recently
been noted in the Ukraine. In 2004 TB incidence rate
was 81 per 100,000 in a population and a mortality rate
was 23 per 100,000 in a population. In 2009 TB incidence and a mortality rates were slightly decreased to
73/100000 and 18/100000, respectively [11]. The
reported incidence of drug-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis is growing steadily; however, data on the genetic
variation of isolates of M. tuberculosis circulating in
northern Ukraine and on the spectrum and frequency of
occurrence of mutations determining resistance to the
principal anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampicin have not yet been reported. Here we report for the
first time, molecular typing of isolates circulating in
Kharkiv Oblast using VNTR- and RFLP-typing methods.
We also identified mutations in genes associated with
the development of resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, determined their frequency, and found correlations
between having a specific mutation and belonging to a
certain mycobacterial genotype.

Methods
Sampling

A total of 98 consecutive observed adult smear-positive
pulmonary TB patients presenting to the State Clinical
Anti-Tuberculosis Dispensary (SC ATD) No. 1 and its
regional branches in Kharkiv, between January and
March 2004 were enrolled in the study. The State Clinical Anti-Tuberculosis Dispensary is the main referral
center for TB in Kharkiv and captures the majority of
TB cases in the city. Males aged between 20 - 60 years
(average age 40 years) dominated (81/98, 83%) the
patient cohort. Smear - positive patients who had never
been treated or were treated for less than 1 month were
classified as new cases (n = 36, 37%), designed as first
group of examined patients. The remaining patients (n
= 62, 63%) were classified as chronic cases that previously had active TB and considered clinically cured
but had become smear-positive again, designed as second group of examined patients. The information collected included socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics, current and previous history of M. tuberculosis infection, history of contact with a TB case, history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment and chest
X- ray findings. The most common form was infiltrative
tuberculosis of the lungs in 61/98 (62%) patients;
fibrous-cavernous in 28/98 (29%) patients; disseminated
tuberculosis of the lungs in 6/98 (6%) patients; caseous
pneumonia in 2/98 (2%) patients; and exudative pleuritis
in 1/98 (1%) patient. The study was approved by the
Ethic Committee on Medical Research of the Institute
of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SBRAS.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients. There
were no demographical or clinical differences between
recruited patients and those who refused to participate.
Bacteriological studies were performed at the Centralized Bacteriological Laboratory of SC ATD No.1, regularly fulfilling quality control. M. tuberculosis was grown
for four weeks in Lowenstein-Jensen medium, before
testing the isolates for sensitivity to isoniazid, rifampicin,
streptomycin, ethambutol and kanamycin by the absolute concentration method [11].
DNA isolation

DNA was isolated from M. tuberculosis cultures as
described by van Soolingen [12].
VNTR-typing

VNTR-typing of the loci; ETR A, B, C, MIRU2, MIRU4,
MIRU10, MIRU16, MIRU20, MIRU23, MIRU24,
MIRU26, MIRU27, MIRU31, MIRU39, and MIRU40
was performed by PCR with a final volume of 20 μL
containing; 65 mM Tris-HCl (рН 8.9), 16 mM (NH 4 )
2SO4; 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2 mM dNTP,
1 μM of the appropriate oligonucleotide primers, 1 unit

of Taq-DNA-polymerase, and 1-10 ng of M. tuberculosis
genomic DNA. The oligonucleotide primer sequences
are given in Table 1. The reaction was carried out in an
iCycler amplifier (Bio-Rad, USA) where after an initial
denaturation step of 96°C for 3 min, 33 cycles were performed as follows; denaturation at 95°C for 5 s, annealing at 60°C for 10 s, and elongation at 72°C for 20 s.
The number of tandem repeat copies was calculated
as a function of the size of the PCR product. The structure and number of repeat copies was also verified by
direct sequencing of the amplified DNA fragments. The
genotype of each isolate was expressed as a set of 15
digits where each digit of the 15-place number showed

the number of copies of the corresponding tandem

RFLP-typing

RFLP-typing of M. tuberculosis DNA isolates was performed using the method described by van Soolingen
and van Embden [12-14].
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the program
Statistica 6.0 (Statsoft Inc.). Cluster analysis and construction of dendrograms was carried out using the
UPGMA criterion (unweighted pair-group average) and
the Neighbor-Joining method.
Identification of mutations associated with the
development of resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin

Primers were designed for amplification of fragments
containing codon 315 of the rpoB gene (MspA and
MspB), and codon 531 of the rpoB gene (MUT531U
and MUT531R). The primer sequences are given in
Table 1. PCR amplification was performed in 20 μL
reaction volumes containing; 65 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.9),
16 mM (NH4 )2 SO 4 , 0.05% Tween 20, 2.5 mM MgCl2 ,
100 μM dNTP, 1 μM primers, 1 unit of Taq-DNA-polymerase, and 1-10 ng of M. tuberculosis genomic DNA.
The reaction was carried out in a Tertsik amplifier
(DNA-technology, Russia) with an initial denaturation
step of 96°C for 3 min, followed by 38 cycles consisting
of: denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 68°C for
10 s (for the fragment of katG), or at 55°C for 10 s (for
the fragment of rpoB), and elongation at 72°C for 20 s.
The presence of an amplification product was checked
by electrophoresis in 6% PAAG with subsequent visualization of the DNA by ethidium bromide staining.
A mutation in codon 315 of the katG gene was determined by hydrolyzing 10 μL of the amplification product using the enzyme MspI. The total reaction volume
was 15 μL. One unit of enzyme was added twice at 1hour intervals and the mixture was incubated at 37оC.
The restriction mixture was analyzed by electrophoresis
in 8% PAAG. Fragments of 72 bp, 57 bp, and 6 bp corresponded to the wild-type allele of katG; whilst fragments of 72 bp, 36 bp, 21 bp, and 6 bp corresponded to
mutations in codon 315 of katG.
The amplification product from rpoB was hydrolyzed
by endonuclease restriction using the enzyme BstPAI in
order to determine whether a mutation in codon 531 of
gene was present. In case where a wild-type allele was
present in the amplified DNA fragment, a substitution
was inserted into one of the oligonucleotide primers to
create a recognition site for the endonuclease. The
hydrolysis was carried out in a 25 μL reaction volume
using 20 μL of the amplification product and 2 units of

BstPAI. The reactions were incubated at 65°C for 2
hours and the restriction products analyzed by electrophoresis in 8% PAAG with subsequent visualization of
the DNA by ethidium bromide staining. Fragments of
153 bp corresponded to the mutant-type allele; fragments of 135 bp and 18 bp to a wild-type allele. Direct
sequencing of the catalyst region of the rpoB gene was
performed on an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) using the
Big dye 3.1 set and primers RPOB1 and MUT531R (see
Table 1).

Results
VNTR-typing

VNTR-typing using 15 polymorphic loci of the 98 M.
tuberculosis isolates identified 75 genetic types. A total
of 67 isolates had unique profiles. The remaining 31 isolates formed clusters of different sizes (with a difference
coefficient <0.125). The Hunter-Gaston discrimination
index (HGDI) for this method was 0.985. A clustering
dendrogram of M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from
tuberculosis patients in Kharkiv Oblast (Figure 1) was
constructed using the UPGMA and N-J methods based
on the VNTR-typing and shows three large branches.
These branches consist of smaller clusters or in most
instances, include isolates with unique allele profiles.

The Beijing strain family is represented in this study
by 32 isolates (32%). Within the Beijing strain family
isolates, the majority 10 (31.5%) had the genetic profile
233325153533424 (for typing over 12 MIRU-loci and
three ETRA, B, C-loci). The remaining isolates of
belonging to this family had either a unique profile or
fell into small clusters of 3-5 isolates.
Representatives of the LAM isolates family formed a
large cluster of 23 isolates (23%). Of these, 5 isolates
had the allelic profile 134325153225222, and 2 isolates
134325113225222. The others isolates of LAM families
had unique profiles.
The Haarlem strain family was represented by 7 isolates (7%), two isolates had the same genetic profile,
235325153323323; but the allelic profiles of the other
five isolates were unique.
We were unable to assign 36 isolates to any previously
known families. A small cluster was formed by 4 (4%) of
the isolates but the remaining 32 (32%) had a unique
genetic profiles.
Isolates of the Beijing strain family were most common among the first group of examined patients (31%),
followed by isolates of the LAM strain family (14%), and
finally isolates of the Haarlem strain family (8%). In the
second group isolates of the Beijing and LAM strain
families represented 39% and 29% of all isolates,

respectively. The increase in the number of isolates from
the Beijing and LAM strain families was not statistically
significant (c 2 = 0.33, p = 0.56; c 2 = 2.08, p = 0.15,
respectively).
RFLP-typing

A total of 31 isolates with sufficient DNA for analysis
were typed using the RFLP-IS6110 method for a more
accurate characterization. A schematic representation of
the results is shown in Figure 2. The 31 isolates were
represented by 23 different genetic profiles using RFLP-

IS6110 typing versus 26 profiles obtained from VNTRtyping of the same samples. A clustering dendrogram
for these isolates was constructed based on the results
of the IS6110-RFLP-typing (Figure 2). Two large clusters
with a mutual difference coefficient of <0.225 are visible
on the dendrogram. The clustering was 29%.
The 9 isolates of the Beijing strain family made up a
very large and rather homogeneous group (figure 2,
lanes 381 to 303) and had between 14 and 19 copies of
the IS6110 element. We identified several variants of the
Beijing strain family; 2 isolates for variant B; 6 isolates

belonging to the LAM strain family. The abscissa axis is number of isolate. The ordinate axis is a linkage distance. Simulation of RFLP-typing of

for variant A, and 1 isolate for variant C [15]. All 9 isolates had a characteristic VNTR-profile of Beijing family.
A heterogeneous group (Figure 2, lanes 372 to 309) with
a difference coefficient <0.1, that included isolates of the
LAM strain family and made up 30% (10 samples) was
also seen. The presence of 10 to 12 copies of IS6110
was characteristic of this family. VNTR-typing confirmed that these isolates belong to the LAM family.
Two isolates (Figure 2, lanes 307 and 349) had the same
RFLP- and VNTR-profile and formed a cluster. Three
isolates (Figure 2, lanes 320, 311 and 304) had same
RFLP-profiles, but only two isolates (№№311,304) were
assigned according to the Haarlem strain family based
on VNTR-typing. Isolates № 361 and №308 had identical RFLP-profiles and possessed by VNTR types. The
remaining 5 isolates (30%) were found to have the
unique RFLP- and VNTR-profiles.
A clustering dendrogram of these same isolates was
also constructed based on VNTR-typing of these isolates
(Figure 3). The difference coefficients for the LAM and
Beijing strain families were <0.1 and <0.125 respectively.
We computed the Hunter-Gaston discrimination indices
for both methods: for RFLP-typing, it was 0.97; for
VNTR-typing, 0.987. This indicated that VNTR-typing
using 15 loci had a higher resolving capability.
Here the perfect concordance between two highly discriminatory molecular methods was observed. Rand
coefficient commonly used for comparing congruence of
typing methods was 0.963 [16].
Analysis of drug resistance

All isolates were tested using the absolute concentration
method for resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin,

Page 6 of 10

kanamycin and ethambutol. Monoresistant tuberculosis
was observed in 14/98 (14%) patients and polyresistant, in
60/98 (61%). It was found that 58% (57/98) of the isolates
were resistant to isoniazid, 49% (48/98) to rifampicin, 75%
(74/98) to streptomycin, 40% (39/98) to kanamycin and
35% (34/98) to ethambutol. MDR-TB (resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, both) was seen in 48/98 (49%) isolates
[17]. Resistance to all tested drugs was seen in 30/98 (30%)
isolates. Twenty four isolates (25%) were sensitive to all
drugs tested.
Determination of mutations associated with resistance to
rifampicin and isoniazid

PCR-RFLP analysis showed that 35 isolates (73%) that
were resistant to rifampicin had the codon substitution
Ser531Leu in rpoB. Sequencing of an 81 bp region of
rpoB was performed for 13 rifampicin-resistant isolates
with no mutation present at codon 531 of the gene
(Tables 2). Codon substitutions were identified in five
locations; in 6 isolates (12.5%) codon 526 changed from
His®Tyr, in 4 insolates (8%), codon 516 changed from
Asp®Val, and in 2 isolates (4%), codon 533 changed
from Leu®Pro. In 1 isolate (2%), two mutations were
observed simultaneously in codons 509 and 511 with
changes from Ser®Thr and Leu®Pro respectively. The
sensitivity and specificity of the genetic analysis was
100%.
Screening of the M. tuberculosis isolates for the presence
of a mutation in codon 315 of the katG gene showed that
53/57 (93%) isoniazid-resistant isolates carried this mutation. Four isoniazid- sensitive isolates also had the
Ser315Thr substitution. Repeated analysis of these isolates
using DNA sequencing of the corresponding part of the

gene confirmed that a mutation was present in this codon.
This may indicate that the results of the bacteriological
study were flawed. The sensitivity and specificity of the
genetic analysis for resistance to isoniazid was 93% and
90%, respectively. Our findings in this study agree with
reports in the literature where the phenotype test for
determining sensitivity to isoniazid has also been shown to
be unreliable (92%) [18,19].
Analysis of the correlation between multiple drug
resistance and genotype of the isolates

The frequency and spectrum of drug resistance of the
isolates belonging to the different strain families were
analyzed (Table 3). Belonging to the LAM strain family
and having multiple drug resistance was shown to be
associated using the Spearman correlation coefficient (R
= 0.27, p = 0.0059). Such an association was not found
for the Beijing strain family (R = 0.1, p = 0.3241).

Discussion
Mutations in the catalyst region of the rpoB gene are
associated with the development of resistance to rifampicin. In 86% of occurrences, they arise at codons 531,
526, or 516. These mutations in certain regions of

Russia are responsible for almost all rifampicin-resistant
isolates [20]. In our collection of isolates, mutations at
these codons were identified in 94% of the rifampicinresistant isolates, which is similar to other reported
results [14] and reflects the geographical similarity of
these regions. The number of rifampicin-resistant isolates with mutations at codons 531, 526, and 516 of the
rpoB gene (73%, 12.55% and 8% respectively) agreed
with those found by Nikolaevskyy et al. during typing of
isolates from Nikolaev and Odessa, Ukraine [21]. These
results are typical of countries with an average or high
level of resistance to rifampicin and predominance of
isolates belonging to the Beijing strain family [22].
The occurrence of the nucleotide substitution
AGC®ACC at codon 315 of the katG gene in isoniazidresistant isolates correlated well with the phenotype test
(93%). Similar results have been obtained for northwest
Russia (93.6%), Latvia (91.0%), and Lithuania (85.7%)
[22-24]. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned mutation according to the literature has an insignificant
effect on decreasing bacterial adaptation and is very
often encountered in rifampicin-resistant strains
[23,25,26]. It is necessary to note, a considerable quantity isolates (30/98, 30%) were resistant to all tested
drugs, however we were not able to designate these isolates as XDR due to lack of fluorquinolones resistance
data [27,28].
Genotyping of 15 polymorphic loci showed a large
variation in the genetic profiles of the studied isolates.
The high discrimination level of VNTR-typing using 15
polymorphic loci (HGDI = 0.985) resulted in a significant percentage of isolates (36%) belonging to as yet
unidentified strain families of M. tuberculosis or having
individual non-clustering genotypes. Six loci (MIRU10,
MIRU26, MIRU31, MIRU39, MIRU40 and ETRA) had a
discrimination index >0.5. The number of allele repeats
varied from 3 to 9, confirming their high discriminating
capability [29]. The discovery of a large cluster of isolates belonging to the Beijing strain family with numerous branches on the clustering dendrogram indicates
that these isolates are widely distributed and have circulated in this region for a long time. The frequency of
occurrence of this strain family was 34%, which is below
the frequency of occurrence of isolates of this strain
family for the Russian Federation (about 50%) [30,31].

The frequency of occurrence of M. tuberculosis isolates
from the LAM strain family (23%) in Kharkiv Oblast
was comparable with that found for Bulgaria (22%) [32]
and Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia (18%) [33]. However,
isolates from this strain family in the Urals and western
Siberian regions of Russia were only 9-10% [31,34]. We
observed that just 7% of our isolates were from the
Haarlem strain family, which has European origins. The
frequency of occurrence of this family is higher in
European countries and in an analogous study in Scandinavia the distribution of isolates from the Haarlem
strain family was 20% [35]. The following migration patterns for the various strain families of M. tuberculosis
can be proposed: strains from the Beijing family were
distributed into Ukraine from eastern Russia; whilst
strains from the LAM and Haarlem families, came from
the European side.
We demonstrated an association between belonging to
the LAM strain family and having multidrug resistance
(MDR). At the same time such association had not been
found for the Beijing strain family. Previously, not only
the predominance of the Beijing strain family but also a
statistically significant association for this family with
MDR (89 of 225 isolates belonging to the Beijing family;
of these 48.3% had MDR, 19.8% did not; RR 2.43, 95% CI
1.63-3.63) was described during a study of isolates from
M. tuberculosis circulating in Odessa and Nikolaev
(Ukraine) [21]. Moreover, the previous study showed that
isolates with the genetic profile 223325173533424 and
the Beijing strain family subtype had more mutations
associated with rifampicin and isoniazid resistance than
those from other subtypes of this family (RR 1.86, 95% CI
1.41-2.47 and RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.17-2.57, for isoniazid
and rifampicin resistance, respectively). Drobniewski
et al. showed during typing of M. tuberculosis circulating
in Russia that this genotype was frequently encountered
among prisoners [36]. In our study we didn’t find isolates
with such genetic profile (223325173533424). Isolates
with the genetic profile (233325153533424) make up
31.5% of all isolates from the Beijing isolates family in
our setting. However, reliable differences between other
Beijing isolates family subtypes with respect to the predominance of mutations related to isoniazid and rifampicin
resistance were not found (c2 = 1.035, p = 0.3; c2 = 0.68,
p = 0.4, respectively).
We did not find a correlation between having a substitution at codon 315 of the katG gene and belonging to
the Beijing or LAM strain family (R = 0.14, P = 0.17, R
= 0.08, P = 0.44, respectively). However, a correlation
was found between having a mutation at codon 531 of
the rpoB gene and belonging to the Beijing strain family
(R = -0.2, P = 0.04). This correlation was not found for
the LAM strain family (R = 0.19, P = 0.06). It is

interesting to note that according to the literature the
presence of such associations depends on the geographic
region because an association between belonging to the
Beijing strain family and having a mutation at codon
531 of the rpoB gene was not found in eastern Asia
[37]. This association is encountered in northwestern
Russia but in northern Africa is more often found in
isolates belonging to the Beijing strain family than in
those of non-Beijing strain families [30,38]. An association was also found between having a substitution at
codon 315 of the katG gene and belonging to the Beijing strain family in studies carried out in Russia and
Kazakhstan [30,39].
A study of M. tuberculosis genotypes in patients with
newly acquired tuberculosis and chronic tuberculosis is
very important for the epidemiological analysis of genotype distribution in a specific region. We found a percentage increase of the Beijing and LAM isolates in the
second group of patients at comparison with the first
ones. However, it was not statistically significant (c2 =
0.33, p = 0.56; c2 = 2.08, p = 0.15, respectively). This
may indicate that these strain families of M. tuberculosis
are transmitted to an equal extent.

Conclusions
Here we have characterized for the first time, the
genetic variation of M. tuberculosis isolates circulating
in northeastern Ukraine and determined the frequency
of occurrence of mutations associated with the development of resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin. Associations between MDR of the isolate and belonging to the
LAM strain family and between belonging to the Beijing
strain family and having a mutation at codon 531 of the
rpoB gene were demonstrated. Representatives of the
LAM strain family were genetically heterogeneous in the
studied isolates, which is inconsistent with recent transmission and has high epidemiological significance for
this region. Unfortunately, this particular study was
rather small and the high percent of secondary cases
could bias real population structure of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex strains from Ukraine. We suggest
that further DNA fingerprinting studies involving better
characterized prime and secondary TB cases obtained
more recently will be useful. The discovery of the principal phylogenetic families of M. tuberculosis and the
description of their properties, especially drug resistance,
will help the selection of more effective preventative
measures in the fight against tuberculosis in the complicated epidemic situation in Ukraine.
