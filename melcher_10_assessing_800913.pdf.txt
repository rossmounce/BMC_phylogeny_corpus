Assessing constancy of substitution rates in
viruses over evolutionary time.

Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic analyses reveal probable patterns of divergence of present day organisms from
common ancestors. The points of divergence of lineages can be dated if a corresponding historical or fossil record
exists. For many species, in particular viruses, such records are rare. Recently, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using
sequences from closely related organisms isolated at different times have been used to calibrate divergences.
Phylogenetic analyses depend on the assumption that the average substitution rates that can be calculated from
the data apply throughout the course of evolution.
Results: The present study tests this crucial assumption by charting the kinds of substitutions observed between
pairs of sequences with different levels of total substitutions. Datasets of aligned sequences, both viral and nonviral, were assembled. For each pair of sequences in an aligned set, the distribution of nucleotide interchanges and
the total number of changes were calculated. Data were binned according to total numbers of changes and
plotted. The accumulation of the six possible interchange types in retroelements as a function of distance followed
closely the expected hyperbolic relationship. For other datasets, however, significant deviations from this
relationship were noted. A rapid initial accumulation of transition interchanges was frequent among the datasets
and anomalous changes occurred at specific divergence levels.
Conclusions: The accumulation profiles suggested that substantial changes in frequencies of types of substitutions
occur over the course of evolution and that such changes should be considered in evaluating and dating viral
phylogenies.

Background
Phylogenetic analyses reveal probable patterns of divergence of present day organisms from common ancestors. The points of divergence of lineages can be dated
if a corresponding historical or fossil record exists. For
many species, in particular viruses, such records are
rare. Substitution frequencies calculated from analysis of
strains of single viral species suggest that many viruses
are evolving so rapidly that any traces of distant evolutionary events should be obscured [1,2]. On the other
hand, evidence has been presented [3-7] that phylogenetic trees of larger taxa often mirror those of their

hosts, implying codivergence of virus with host. This
implication is consistent with conclusions from analysis
of viral hallmark genes that viruses existed at the time
that cellular life evolved [8]. The two views appear to
conflict [2,9]. Substitution frequencies required for the
codivergence hypothesis need to be about 104 fold less
than those observed in many viral species [2,7]. A recent
review [10] suggests, by way of reconciliation of the two
views, that different evolutionary mechanisms are at
work in viral speciation than in the evolution of viral
strains of individual species.
Evolutionary theory has recognized that not all residues in a nucleotide or amino acid sequence are subject
to the same evolutionary constraints [11]. It also has
allowed for the possibility that some kinds of substitutions occur more frequently than others [12] and that

overall substitution rates may speed up or slow down
along selected lineages [13]. Phylogenetic applications
[14,15] allow incorporation of these possibilities for variation into the models to be tested. One application,
DAMBE, allows one to examine the relative rates of
accumulation of transitions and transversions [16], but
not to distinguish between transitions or among transversions. However, no phylogenetic model-testing applications allow the individual substitution frequencies to
vary relative to one another over the course of evolution. Constancy is important particularly when phylogenetic trees are constructed and dated using only recent
dates as references, such as in BEAST [14]. The present
study was undertaken to answer questions about variation of the relative proportions of the different substitution types over evolutionary time. Do interchanges
noted between recently diverged sequence pairs have
distributions of interchange types similar to those of distantly diverged pairs? If they are not the same, do the
relative rates of types of interchange change gradually or
abruptly over divergence time? Does coding ability of a
strand influence relative rates of types of interchanges?
Are other factors involved?
For this analysis three viral datasets and three non-viral
datasets were chosen. Available complete genome
sequences of virus species in the Tobamovirus genus
(family Virgaviridae) served as one dataset. These viruses
have single strands of positive sense RNA as their encapsidated genomes. Wheat streak mosaic virus is a single
viral species with multiple sequence representatives of
moderately wide diversity. Its genome consists also of a
single strand of positive sense RNA. To contrast with
these viruses, the study included isolates of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus of which there are several closely
related species distinguished by geographic location of
original isolation. The genomes of these viruses are single-stranded circular DNA molecules that have open
reading frames on both their genomic and their antigenomic strands. A series of eucaryotic retroelements
were chosen as coding regions with relaxed evolutionary
constraints. Coding regions for each of the two subunits
of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase were included since
that encoding RbcL is plastid localized and that for RbcS
is encoded in the nuclear genome. Plastid and nucleus
are expected to have different mutational profiles.

Methods
Datasets

Six datasets were assembled from sequences available in
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ for coding regions for the large
subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL)
from red algae, the small subunit of the same enzyme
(rbcS) from cereals, reverse transcriptase (RT) coding
sequences from retroelements of a diversity of sources

selected from the EST database, isolates of Wheat streak
mosaic virus and the related Oat necrotic mottle virus
(WSMV), members of the Tobamovirus genus and isolates of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). Lists of
the accession numbers used are presented in additional
file 1. Sequences were aligned manually using Se-Al [17]
with reference to the amino acid sequences encoded. In
the case of tobamoviruses, previously constructed alignments [5] were used as guide. Alignments are available
as fasta format in additional file 2.
Analysis

Each of the six datasets was analyzed for the numbers of
each type of the six interchanges for one strand for each
pair of sequences in the dataset and the total numbers
of positions evaluated for each pair was recorded. Positions where either member of the pair lacked a residue
were ignored. For datasets with open reading frames on
one strand only, that strand was used for analysis.
When ORFs were on both strands, as in TYLCV, the
genomic strand was used. Analysis was accomplished by
a short program written in Future Basic (Staz Software,
Bay St. Louis, Missouri; source code available as additional file 3). The program tabulated the numbers of
each type of interchange in each pair of sequences and
the total number of differences in each pair.
Results of the pairwise comparison were imported into
Microsoft Excel. The total number of evaluated interchanges, normalized by the number of positions
compared were converted to t-distances using the JukesCantor correction for multiple substitutions [18]. For
each of the six interchange types, values were converted
to numbers of each type per knt compared. The results
were sorted according to t-distances. The numbers of
interchanges were then binned according to t-distance
to give between 30 and 60 well populated bins. Underpopulated bins were removed from consideration. For
each interchange type the mean numbers of interchanges per knt in each bin were plotted as a function
of t-distance. For each each t-distance bin, the standard
deviations were also calculated for each interchange
type and plotted as half error bars. Microsoft Excel,
through its “solver” tool, was used also to estimate the
goodness of fit of observed values to a hyperbolic equation [19]

Results
Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, show the accumulation of nucleotide interchanges between pairs of sequences as a function of the divergence t-distance between the sequences.
Absent other considerations, the relationships should be
hyperbolic with an initial nearly linear phase followed by
a leveling-off as previously interchanged sites undergo
additional substitutions.

Viral interchange accumulation profiles

For the dataset of species from the Tobamovirus genus
(Fig. 1), transitions accumulated 3.5 times as rapidly as
transversions in the initial period of divergence. On
further accumulation of substitutions during divergence,
the T<>C interchanges appeared to plateau at a lower
level than G<>A interchanges. Transitions and transversions had similar rates of accumulation during this period of divergence. At the largest divergence distances,
the number of T<>A transversion interchanges could
not be distinguished from the number of T<>C transition interchanges. Not surprisingly, the complementary
T<>G and C<>A interchanges had practically indistinguishable accumulation profiles, while C<>G interchanges were least frequent. Between t-distances of 0.45
and 0.50, significant anomalous shifts in interchange frequency occurred for T<>A, G<>A and T<>C
interchanges.

The Tobamovirus data set was chosen to focus on
speciation events. For comparison, multiple isolates of
the same virus species were tested for two viruses (Figs.
2 and 3). Limitation of the dataset to members of the
same species resulted in a narrowing of the range of tdistances plotted. For isolates of WSMV (Fig. 2), transitions accumulated eight times as rapidly as transversions
in the initial period of divergence. Indeed, the transition
accumulation curves appeared non-hyperbolic, being
characterized by an apparent lag phase. C<>G interchanges were rare during this period. On further accumulation of substitutions, the T<>C interchanges
appeared to plateau after more limited divergence times
than did G<>A interchanges. Between t-distances of
0.12 and 0.28, a significantly anomalous transient shift
in interchange frequency occurred for C<>A
interchanges.

was chosen (Fig. 3). Despite the virus’ DNA genome,
mutation rates, both inferred [20] and experimentally
estimated [21], have been reported to be of the order of
those for RNA viruses. Lag phases were apparent for
several inerchange types. T<>C interchange accumulation was more prominent than others, including G<>A
interchanges, in the initial period of divergence. Indeed,
accumulation of G<>A transition interchanges
resembled closely that of T<>A transversions. C<>G
and C<>A transversion interchanges accumulated much
less rapidly than transversions involving T. Although
C<>G interchanges appeared to have plateaued between
0.19 and 0.21 t-distance units, additional such interchanges were noted in more diverged pairs.
Non-viral interchange accumulation profiles

The reverse transcriptase coding regions of nuclear retroelements from a variety of eukaryotes were assembled
into a dataset to provide a highly diverged protein-coding gene set that may be under reduced selective

pressure (Fig. 4). With the exception of non-significant
fluctuations at high divergence levels, the accumulation
profiles of the different types of interchanges conformed
to the expected hyperbolic pattern. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.988 for T<>C to 0.997 for C<>G
interchanges. T<>A transversion interchanges joined the
two transitions (T<>C and G<>A) as the most frequent
type of substitution in this dataset. As with the viral
profiles, C<>G interchanges accumulated to the smallest
extent.
As additional controls, datasets of coding regions for
plastid and nuclear subunits of ribulose-bisphosphate
carboxylase (RbcL and RbcS, respectively) were also
examined. As for viral sequences, initial interchanges
between recently diverged pairs of RbcS from cereals
(Fig. 5) were 4.7 times as likely to be transitions than to
be transversions and G<>A transitions began to plateau
at a lower level of divergence distance than did T<>C
transitions. T<>G interchanges were the least frequent
at all levels of divergence and significantly less frequent
than the complementary C<>A interchange, except at
the very shortest divergence distances.
For RbcL coding regions from algae (Fig. 6), T<>C
transition and T<>A transversion interchanges were the
most prominent throughout the period of divergence,
with T<>C exceeding T<>A except in the most diverged
pairs. At the highest divergence levels these two
accounted for four-fold as many interchanges as for the
other four combined. As with the viral profiles, C<>G
interchanges accumulated to the smallest extent. An
apparent anomalous change occurred between 0.11 and
0.12 t-distance units where C<>A transversion interchanges were more prominent among distant pairs than
with less distant pairs. This transition appeared to have
been compensated by fewer T<>C interchanges at
greater distances.
Interchange comparisons

Table 1 compares the percentages of the total interchanges represented by each of the six types of interchange, obtained for the data sets analyzed in this study
at a t-distance of 0.10, with two classic sets of data, one
on globin genes [22] and one on pseudogenes [23]. A tdistance of 0.1 was chosen for the comparison to avoid
influence of highly frequent mutations (t-distance <0.5)
and the influence of substitution saturation seen at
higher t-distances. The classic percentages had been
summed over all distances, but nonetheless provide a
useful comparison. For the pseudogenes, presumably
subject to relaxed evolutionary constraints on substitutions, only G<>A transition interchanges were noticeably higher than other types. G<>A interchanges were
not the predominant type for five of the six datasets
analyzed in the current study. The exception was the

tobamoviral sequences where the G<>A percentage was
slightly higher than that for T<>C. G<>C interchanges
were relatively rare in all datasets except for globin and
the RbcS ones. In globin genes their percentage was second only to the G<>A transition interchange. The complementary substitution pair A<>C and G<>T had
similar percentages in pseudogene, retroelement and
Tobamovirus datasets, but were biased in the other substitution classes.

Discussion
The interchanges summarized in this work are represented as X<>Y to make clear that no attempt has been
made to determine the direction of substitutions,
whether X changed to Y or Y changed to X. Such determination requires confident knowledge of ancestral
sequences. This knowledge was lacking in most
instances. Trial runs using a consensus sequence as
common ancestor resulted in separation of the six
curves into twelve curves. Often the reciprocal exchange
values were widely different. Investigation into mechanisms responsible for anomalies and differences will need
to analyze the full set of 12 types. However, such
separation was not needed to observe the existence of
anomalies.
If substitutions were to occur with equal frequency on
coding and non-coding strands, one would expect that,
because of complementarity, T<>A and C<>G interchanges would be detected equally frequently as would
C<>A and T<>G interchanges. T<>A exchanges were
observed to be prominent in the tobamovirus, retroelement and TYLCV datasets, while C<>G interchanges
were minor in all but the RbcS dataset. On the other
hand, C<>A and T<>G interchange levels had practically
indistinguishable accumulation profiles in the tobamovirus dataset. This was also true for retroelements, RbcL
and, at low to moderate divergence levels, for WSMV,
but not for TYLCV or RbcS.
In the viral datasets, among sequence pairs that had
undergone only limited divergence, one or both transition interchanges were by far the most predominant
type. For tobamoviruses and WSMV both transitions

had this feature while for the TYLCV only T<>C interchanges showed this property. The same transitions
played a much diminished role in pairs that diverged
from one another over a longer period of time. Similar
early spurts of T<>C interchanges occurred also in evolution of both Rbc coding regions, with G<>A interchanges also being prominent early in RbcS. The result
suggests that there are subsets of sites that can readily
tolerate transitions and that substitutions at these sites
approach saturation after only short periods of evolution. If the suggestion is correct, then such changes in
substitution frequency need to be taken into account
when calibrating phylogenetic trees to determine dates
of divergence. Initial rates of divergence may be substantially higher than those after saturation of these sites
has been reached.
Of greatest relevance to the issue of dating viral phylogenetic trees is the nature of the curves representing
the accumulation of substitutions over evolutionary
time. Fig. 4 shows that, for a dataset where selective
pressures are likely to have been slight during evolution, the curves are very consistent with the expected
hyperbolic relationships. The other datasets generated
graphs with irregular appearances, including lag phases
and abrupt changes in slope. It is intriguing that these
slope changes appear to occur at specific divergence
levels. That they may represent substitutions associated
with speciation events merits investigation. They are
likely associated with a shift in base composition. The
apparent lag phases are likely the result of a non-linear
relationship between t-distance and time. Between
recently diverged pairs some types of interchanges
(usually transitions) happen frequently at a limited
number of sites. These interchanges occur over a small
time span thus artificially expanding the x-axis at early
“times” of divergence and resulting in apparent lag
phases. This interpretation is consistent with the view
that substitution frequencies are much higher for
intrastrain divergence than for interspecies divergence.
Thus, it may not be valid to apply substitution frequencies calculated from recently diverged pairs to
evolution of species.

Conclusions
These observations suggest strongly that the probabilities of particular substitutions are different at different
stages of evolution. Thus, a single probability applied to
an entire dataset, such as those analyzed for Figs. 1, 2, 3
and 5, 6 should produce unreliable results in phylogenetic analysis. This study therefore supports the conclusion [10] that different evolutionary rules may apply to
recent divergences than apply to divergences that give
rise to speciation and similar distant past events.
