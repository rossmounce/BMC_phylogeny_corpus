Introgression potential between safflower
(Carthamus tinctorius) and wild relatives of the
genus Carthamus

Abstract
Background: Safflower, Carthamus tinctorius, is a thistle that is grown commercially for the production of oil and
birdseed and recently, as a host for the production of transgenic pharmaceutical proteins. C. tinctorius can cross
with a number of its wild relatives, creating the possibility of gene flow from safflower to weedy species. In this
study we looked at the introgression potential between different members of the genus Carthamus, measured the
fitness of the parents versus the F1 hybrids, followed the segregation of a specific transgene in the progeny and
tried to identify traits important for adaptation to different environments.
Results: Safflower hybridized and produced viable offspring with members of the section Carthamus and species
with chromosome numbers of n = 10 and n = 22, but not with n = 32. The T-DNA construct of a transgenic C.
tinctorius line was passed on to the F1 progeny in a Mendelian fashion, except in one specific cross, where it was
deleted at a frequency of approximately 21%. Analyzing fitness and key morphological traits like colored seeds,
shattering seed heads and the presence of a pappus, we found no evidence of hybrid vigour or increased
weediness in the F1 hybrids of commercial safflower and its wild relatives.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that hybridization between commercial safflower and its wild relatives, while
feasible in most cases we studied, does not generate progeny with higher propensity for weediness.

Background
The genus Carthamus is a diverse group of plants
within the Asteraceae and is of interest due to the commercial growth of one member, C. tinctorius (safflower)
as well as for its potential as a model system to examine
the introgression of agronomic and weedy traits across
species boundaries and to study the invasiveness of wild
relatives of a crop. Safflower is grown in several countries as an oilseed crop and for birdseed and is being
evaluated as a crop platform for molecular farming [1].
The different species of Carthamus have been classified
into several different grouping systems by different taxonomists. Estilai and Knowles [2] originally placed 13
species in the genus Carthamus into five sections, based
on chromosome numbers. Lopez-Gonzalez [3] rearranged the 15 species that he identified into three

sections (Carthamus, Odonthagnathis and Atractylis), to
match the understanding of the relationships between
the species and their chromosome numbers. In the
scheme proposed by Vilatersana et al. [4], the section
Carthamus contains the species with 12 sets of chromosomes including C. tinctorius, C. palaestinus and C. oxyacanthus. The section Atractylis (n = 10, 11, 22, 32)
contains all other species in the genus including the
noxious weeds C. lanatus (n = 22) and C. leucocaulos (n
= 10). There are still some species with uncertain placement within the groups, such as C. nitidus [5]. In this
report, we have chosen to use the classification system
of Lopez-Gonzalez. Elucidating species relationships
within Carthamus has been challenging. There are low
levels of genetic variation despite clear morphological
differences between species [4,6]. Random amplified
polymorphic DNA markers [RAPDs; 4] and conserved,
intron-spanning PCR markers [7] have been utilized to
address species relationships. Recently, because of low
reproducibility of RAPD marker results [8] and conflict

between published data sets, we have utilized microsatellite markers to analyze species relationships [6].
We have been using the genus Carthamus as a model
system to study the introgression of traits across species
boundaries and the extent to which these traits provide
adaptive benefits. Several species of weedy relatives are
growing in the same areas as the commercial crops and
have the potential to cross and produce fertile offspring
with safflower. These include C. lanatus (woolly distaff
thistle, saffron thistle), C. leucocaulos (glaucous star thistle, white-stem/yellow distaff thistle), and C. oxyacanthus (jewelled distaff thistle, wild safflower). The
genus is native to the Middle East; however, its distribution has expanded into many countries across the world
including Australia and North America [9]. Both C.
lanatus and C. leucocaulos are considered noxious
weeds in California and Australia. In Australia, C. lanatus has become a weed after it was introduced from the
Mediterranean. It has spread throughout the continent
[10] and is currently considered the most economically
damaging thistle species in New South Wales [11].
There are other thistle species within the family Asteraceae and some of them are noxious weeds, including
spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) and star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis). These species are highly invasive, particularly
in drier Prairie climates. In Canada, knapweed is now
recognized as a major invasive weed, causing significant
damage to a number of Prairie agroecosystems [12].
Hybridization of safflower with sympatric wild relatives has probably played a significant role in the evolution of Carthamus and cultivated safflower in the
Mediterranean [13-15]. For example, the hexaploid noxious weeds C. creticus and C. turkestanicus are allopolyploids resulting from the hybridization of a tetraploid
ancestor (C. lanatus) with a diploid progenitor lineage
(C. leucocaulos and C. glaucus, respectively) [15]. The
fact that these species intercross and that some of the
relatives are weedy, leads to concerns about transgene
escape from cultivated C. tinctorius plants and the
potential for commercial safflower to cross with its
weedy relatives and become feral or “de-domesticated”.
The evolution of agricultural weeds from wild species
is a recurring pattern in the history of agriculture, with
plants from numerous families evolving weedy genotypes that thrive in cultivated areas [16]. This is not surprising, given the evidence that 12 of the 13 most
important food crops hybridize with at least one wild
relative within their range [Reviewed in 17]. Typically,
during the development of crop plants a number of
traits are commonly selected for, including high germination rates, yield, oil profile, earliness and developmental consistency. Similarly, when a wild species evolves
into an agricultural weed, a number of important

Page 2 of 10

adaptations occur, including rapid seedling growth, high
competitive ability and increases in both seed output
and dispersal [18]. These adaptations are relevant for
several reasons. First, these traits are encoded by multiple independent genes and the evolution of similar traits
in different species is of interest from a comparative
genetics viewpoint [19]. Second, the adaptations often
result from the transfer of crop genes that provide specific life history traits for the hybrid to become a noxious weed. A particularly clear example of this has been
the transfer of transgenes that encode herbicide resistance to create weeds with herbicide tolerance [20,21].
In addition to concerns about transgene escape there
are now speculations that certain traits will allow invasive species to capitalize on different elements of global
climate change [22].
In this paper, we describe which members of the
Carthamus tribe can hybridize with cultivated safflower, determine whether the hybrid plants have a
higher fitness than the C. tinctorius parent and look at
the segregation of a herbicide resistance transgene in
an interspecific cross. Finally, we analyze traits potentially important for adaptation to specific biotic
environments.

Results
Crossing success and fitness of hybrids

Table 1 outlines the total number of seeds harvested
and the success rate (# seeds produced/# crosses
attempted × 100) of each cross. The success rate of controlled crosses between a transgenic C. tinctorius (Centennial) and other Carthamus species varied from 0% to
67%, compared to the C. tinctorius/C. tinctorius control
cross of 40%. We are aware that some of the Carthamus
lines obtained from the USDA might be fairly inbred
and therefore may have given low seed set due to
inbreeding depression.
Crosses with species in the section Carthamus (n =
12; C. oxyacanthus and C. palaestinus) generally
worked, regardless of whether C. tinctorius was the male
or female parent. Crosses worked equally well with C.
palaestinus as either the female (38%) or the male (31%)
parent. Two different accessions of C. oxyacanthus (PI
426427, PI 426477) had a low success rate as the female
parents (2% and 14%) with somewhat higher values as
the male parents (15% and 23%). A nontransgenic variety of C. tinctorius (Centennial) was also crossed with
two other accessions of C. oxyacanthus. These crosses
worked well with C. oxyacanthus as female parent (56%
and 30%) and a bit less efficient as the male parent (21%
and 42%; data not shown).
Crosses between species of the section Odonthagnathis (n = 10; C. leucocaulos and C. glaucus) and C.
tinctorius were relatively successful, ranging from 14%

to 67% success rate. The cross with C. glaucus produced
fertile F1 plants; however, the cross with C. leucocaulos
resulted in sterile offspring. Our recent data and similar
findings by other laboratories have raised doubts about
the identity of the C. glaucus samples that are being distributed by USDA Pullman, WA, i.e. these seeds might
in fact not be from C. glaucus but from a species with n
= 12.
For the section Atractylis (n = 22, 32; C. lanatus, C.
turkestanicus, C. creticus), the cross between C. lanatus
(n = 22) and C. tinctorius worked well with C. lanatus
as male parent (29%), with a lower success rate as
female parent (17%). However, all F1 plants from this
cross were sterile.
For C. turkestanicus, two different genotypes were
used (PI 426180, PI 426426). Only one seed was harvested, giving a success rate of 0.3%. We did not determine whether this seed was truly a hybrid, would
germinate and produced viable F1 plants.
C. creticus as female parent gave a 2% success rate,
and 0% as male parent, therefore it was assumed that
crosses between these species were unlikely to work. In
summary, crosses with members of the section Atractylis were successful for C. lanatus (n = 22) but failed for
C. creticus and C. turkestanicus (both n = 32).

A number of seeds from all crosses, except C. creticus
and C. turkestanicus, were imbibed to determine the
germination rates and to produce F1 plants for further
analysis (Table 2 and 3). In total 197 F1 plants were
generated and all, except two self-pollinated individuals,
were true hybrids as verified by species-specific microsatellite markers and antibody based test strips. The
hybrid plants were subsequently selfed for the generation and analysis of F2 seeds (Table 3).
While there are a number of ways of calculating parental and F1 fitness, our calculation of fitness was based
solely on the total seed set per plant, given as a fraction
of the seed set of the commercial cultivar Centennial
(Table 2). However, we note that some of the Carthamus lines are likely to be fairly inbred, due to repeated
selfing and seed collection, which occurs as a result of
the way the USDA maintains its lines. Thus, some selfs
may have given low seed set due to inbreeding depression, whereas outcrossing relieves this, resulting in
higher seed set.
Parental fitness varied from 0.05 (for one C. oxyacanthus genotype) to 13.41 (for C. leucocaulos), compared to the Centennial parental fitness (1.00). The F1
fitness was zero for C. lanatus and C. leucocaulos as all
of the self-pollinated F1 plants (11 and 18 plants,

respectively) had a very low amount of pollen and none
of them produced any seed.
Domestication and weedy characteristics of C. tinctorius
and the wild relatives

After analyzing the key descriptors for safflower [23], we
developed a list of traits that could potentially be associated with domestication or weediness and analyzed
them in the parental species (Table 4) and the F1
hybrids (Table 3). These included seed weight, seed
color, presence of a pappus, number of seeds produced,
time at rosette stage, spininess, time to flowering, time
of flowering and shattering versus non-shattering heads.
Three key morphological traits that may be associated
with weediness are colored seeds, shattering seed heads
and the presence of a pappus. Carthamus lanatus, C.
leucocaulos, C. turkestanicus and C. creticus all have a
pappus on their seeds and are shattering, and most of
the wild species have seeds that are tan, brown or
brown striped, all of which should help in seed dispersal
and in reducing seed predation. Additionally, most of
the wild species studied had much higher numbers of
seeds per plant.
Other traits that may be related to weediness or invasiveness are a longer time at the rosette stage and to the

start of flowering, as well as spininess. Shoot elongation
is delayed for the weedy relatives and their time at the
rosette stage was 1.8 to 6.9 times that of Centennial. For
the F1 plants this was 1.6 to 2.9 times and it always fell
between the two parents.
Time to flowering differed substantially between the
species analyzed, with C. leucocaulos and C. lanatus
showing the longest time. The values for the F1s fell
between the two means of their parents.
There was a wide range of the number of selfed seeds
per plant for the parental species, ranging from a few to
over two thousand, although some individual plants did
not produce any seeds at all. The wild relatives, particularly C. lanatus and C. leucocaulos, had many more
seeds than Centennial. Having many smaller-sized seeds
is probably a strategy used by these weeds to increase
the dispersal and the probability that a viable seed will
find a suitable environment. The two genotypes of C.
oxyacanthus (PI 426427 and PI 426477) produced quite
different amounts of seed (215 vs. 8) which may reflect
some inherent self-incompatibility systems [24]. The
seed set of the F1 plants also varied between the different crosses. However, the biggest variation was again
seen between the progeny of the C. oxyacanthus -C.
tinctorius cross.

The F1 germination rates of the two C. oxyacanthus
accessions and of C. lanatus were about a third of C.
tinctorius, which was almost 100%. They ranged from
32% to 36% and were also considerably lower than the
germination rates of their weedy parents (50% to 100%).
For C. lanatus, F1 seeds from the cross with C. tinctorius as the male parent had a considerably higher germination rate than from the reciprocal cross (not shown).
C. leucocaulos and C. palaestinus parental and F1 seeds
germinated at very similar rates (80% to 100%), whereas
the C. glaucus F1s did significantly better than their
weedy parent (75% vs. 44%). It should be noted however
that fitness measurements on material which has very
different histories (inbred for several generations, compared to a commercial cultivar or an F1 hybrid), are
extremely difficult to compare, due to possible genetic

effects associated with cultivar development, inbreeding
or differences in hybrid breakdown in the F2 generation.
The seed weight of the F1 seeds either fell between
that of Centennial (the parent with the larger seeds) and
the wild relative, or it was lower. F1 seeds were always
similar in color, size, shape and seed weight to the
female parent of the cross, suggesting some degree of
maternal inheritance to these traits (Table 3). The
weight of the F2 seeds was between that of the two parents and there was no difference whether Centennial
was the female or the male parent.
The weedy species are primarily shattering, which is
likely to increase the dispersal rate of the seed. Since C.
lanatus, C. leucocaulos, C. turkestanicus and C. creticus
hybrids did not develop any F2 seed set, we have no
data about this trait from these species. In the case of C.

Mayerhofer et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/47

oxyacanthus, all the selfed F1 plants were shattering at
variable degrees, suggesting a dominant trait; however,
our data do not allow a more detailed genetic analysis.
Seed color was difficult to evaluate genetically but the
weedy species and their F1 hybrids had mostly striped
to brown seeds, that are clearly less visible against a soil,
crop or grassland background.
The frequent presence of a pappus in C. lanatus, C.
leucocaulos, C. turkistanicus and C. creticus indicates
the value of this trait in these weedy species. We
observed a pappus in the F1 seed when the weedy relative was the female parent, but not the reciprocal cross.
Again, we could not analyze any F2 seeds for this trait
in these crosses. Regardless of the trait measured, the F1
plants usually had a phenotype that was midway
between the parents.
Deletion of the transgene in specific F1 hybrids

The presence of the transgene in the F1 crosses was verified using an antibody strip test as well as T-DNA specific PCR primers, detecting the pat protein and pat gene,
respectively. Additionally, the integrity of the left and
right T-DNA border/plant DNA junctions were analyzed
by PCR using the LB/LGS and RB/RGS primer pairs (Figure 1). We found that, with one exception, all crosses
produced F1 offspring carrying the intact transgene.
However, when C. tinctorius was crossed with C. glaucus,
the pat protein and pat gene were absent in 21% of the
progeny (Table 2). Instead, in those F1 plants the LGS
and RGS primers amplified a single band of the same size
as in the genomic region of the nontransgenic Centennial
control, suggesting a complete deletion of the T-DNA
construct. Table 5 shows the PCR and strip test results
for four (out of 72 analyzed) F1 individuals, along with
two controls plants. Hybrids glauc1 and glauc2 showed a
deletion of the T-DNA construct, whereas glauc3 and
glauc7 retained it. These patterns were consistent for all
of the F1s we analyzed, i.e. the F1s that lacked the pat
protein, the pat gene and the left and right T-DNA

borders produced a wildtype Centennial band and vice
versa. Since we separated the PCR products only by agarose gel electrophoresis, we were unable to determine
whether there were any smaller deletions (<20bp) associated with the excision of the transgene. We did not
observe any discernible morphological differences
between these F1 plants and the ones carrying the
transgene.

Discussion
Hybrid production

Safflower is considered one of humanities’ oldest crops
and has therefore been selected for domestication
traits over several centuries [25]. It does have numerous wild relatives and gene transfer through interspecific hybridization may introduce weedy traits into the
commercial crop, creating the potential for invasive
hybrid populations [26-28]. Alternately, it can also provide an avenue for the transfer of novel traits from
specially developed crops to wild populations. In the
Old World there are a number of wild relatives that
coexist with C. tinctorius, for example C. palaestinus,
C. persicus and C. oxyacanthus [9,25,29,30]. In the
New World, potential recipients of genes from cultivated safflower include four naturalized wild relatives,
C. creticus, C. lanatus, C. leucocaulos and C. oxyacanthus. Of these, C. oxyacanthus and C. creticus have
previously been shown to produce viable hybrid offspring with C. tinctorius [5]. We have now demonstrated that most of the wild relatives, which have 10
or 12 chromosomes, produce viable and fertile hybrids
with C. tinctorius.
A number of hybrids from the different interspecific
crosses are currently being advanced by selfing, as well
as backcrossing to the wild parents. Monitoring of the
fitness of subsequent generations will give us a better
idea about the adaptive value of the incorporated crop
genes. Also, other effects like hybrid breakdown [31]
can be better recognized at later generations.

Domestic versus weedy traits

Many of the traits detected in cultivated safflower such
as Centennial have clearly been selected for by breeders.
These include consistent white seeds, high germination
rates, high yield and yield correlates (seed number and
seed size), absence of a pappus, non-shattering, erect
stature, etc. Therefore, the traits that may provide a
selective advantage in an agricultural setting may not be
selected for in nature or in an invasive weed. For example, while a high germination rate is valuable from a
producer’s perspective, delaying germination until a second year might allow a weedy genotype to germinate in
a different environment, either in terms of the competitive environment (a different crop) or a different abiotic
environment.
Several weedy relatives of C. tinctorius have been studied and hybrids between these relatives and safflower
have been used to study the inheritance of a number of
domestication traits [32,33]. The wild and weedy species
C. oxyacanthus, C. persicus and C. palaestinus were
shown to have seeds that are released by shattering,
although in our study C. palaestinus was non-shattering.
These species are homozygous dominant for the gene
Sh, while cultivated safflower genotypes are homozygous
recessive for this locus (sh) [29,30]. Another trait that
alters seed dispersal in the Asteraceae is the presence of
a pappus, a seed appendage for dispersal via water, wind
and adherence to animal fur. Most of the seeds of safflower lack a pappus and when it is present, it is less
than the length of the achenes. The gene controlling the
presence of a pappus in C. persicus has been shown to
be dominant (P_), while commercial safflower is homozygous recessive for this locus (pp) [30]. A third trait
that has been genetically characterized is the duration of
cultivated safflower’s rosette stage, which is shortened
by a single dominant gene (ro), reducing the maturity
time of the crop, which might also affect the invasiveness of a particular genotype [30]. The longer rosette
stage of both C. persicus and C. oxyacanthus helps their
seeds to be dispersed in the field after harvest of the
cereal crops they often grow among. Domestication

traits such as large seed, reduced shattering, lack of pappus and short duration of the rosette stage ensure that
the majority of safflower seeds are harvested. Reduced
seed dormancy causes the seeds to germinate when
planted so they are less likely to persist in the seed
bank.
Data obtained from crosses of C. tinctorius with other
species can be used as an initial indicator to predict the
potential for hybridization and subsequent introgression
of a gene from a cultivated crop into a weedy population and vice versa. Hybrids between safflower and wild
relatives could potentially serve as a source of feral safflower populations but hybridization and introgression
would require that both plants be sympatric in their distribution and flower at the same time. Our analysis of
some of the traits that make C. tinctorius a commercial
crop suggests that they are unlikely to provide any selective advantage.
Segregation of a transgene in the hybrids

The movement of a specific transgene to the offspring
was analyzed using a homozygous line with a single TDNA insert. We observed that in all of the crosses,
except one, the transgene acted as a normal Mendelian
trait. However, in the C. tinctorius × C. glaucus cross,
the transgene was deleted at a frequency of 21%.
The ultimate fate of a transgene in nature is affected
by several factors including its frequency in the population, the probability that the gene will be transferred to
the hybrid plant and finally, the selective advantage the
gene confers to the new host species [34]. It seems unlikely that transgenes used for the production of Plant
Made Pharmaceuticals (PMPs) would improve the viability or survival of feral safflower. In fact the only data
we are aware of (McPherson M., unpublished data), suggest that the PMP trait used in these experiments
reduces the fitness of the seed. Haygood et al. [35] have
shown in their analysis that the likelihood of establishment and rate of spread of a transgene is governed primarily by the strength of selection, as opposed to the
migration rate [35,36].

Mayerhofer et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/47

Several pieces of data now point to the unlikelihood
of transgene escape, except when the transgene provides a selective advantage to the hybrid, e.g. herbicide
tolerance. First, the outcrossing frequency of safflower
is relatively low. Second, our data provide evidence of
the selective deletion of transgenes in specific crosses,
a phenomenon that we believe is the first of this kind
in an interspecific cross. Third, the traits that breeders
have selected for in cultivated safflower, like seed
color, high germination rates, seed weight and nonshattering seed heads, appear unlikely to provide much
of a selective advantage in competitive situations in
nature, as they decrease both the seed number and dispersal characteristics of the hybrids. However, the
adaptive value of crop genes can be different in backcross progeny growing under different environments.
Given that the genus Carthamus includes several
weeds such as C. lanatus, C. leucocaulos and C. oxyacanthus, it seems sensible to avoid growing transgenic
safflower in geographical areas where feral species have
been reported, e.g. drier regions including California
and Australia, and areas where safflower is currently
being grown as an oilseed crop.

Conclusion
In this study, we report that commercial safflower will
cross readily with different members of the same section
(Carthamus) and several species with different chromosome numbers. All of these crosses produce F1 plants
and most of them, particularly coming from wild relatives with n = 10 and n = 12, are viable and fertile.
However, there is no evidence of hybrid vigour or other
benefits provided to them.
Our analysis of some of the domestication traits that
make C. tinctorius a commercial crop suggests that they
are unlikely to provide any selective advantage when
they are introgressed into wild relatives. Likewise, the
transfer of a T-DNA construct from commercial safflower did not appear to have any visible effect on the
hybrids.
The transgene was deleted in 21% of the hybrids from
a specific cross, suggesting a negative selection mechanism against foreign DNA in some species.
Methods
Plant material

Additional File 1 provides a list of the germplasm used
and the identifier number to allow the identification of
the germplasm in our recent phylogenetic analysis as
described in Bowles et al. [6]. The C. tinctorius parent
in all crosses was the commercial safflower
variety Centennial, which was homozygous for a transgene construct containing the Phosphinothricin

Page 8 of 10

Acetyltransferase (pat) gene as a selectable marker
(Figure 1). Seeds for this line, as well as for a nontransgenic line of Centennial, were obtained from SemBioSys Genetics Inc. (Calgary, AB, Canada). The seed
lots were tested for purity and homozygosity of the
transgene as described by Christianson et al. [37]. For
most accessions, seeds were germinated in soil. In
those cases where no germination occurred in the first
attempt, 0.3% gibberellic acid (GA 3 ) in ddH 2 0 was
added. Where possible, single seed descent was performed to reduce the level of genetic variability in the
specific genotypes used in crossings. For interspecific
crosses, plants were emasculated and hand pollinated,
the flowers were bagged and the plants allowed to fully
mature. For most crosses, three plants of each genotype were used as parents and reciprocal crosses were
performed. In total, between 38 and 280 crosses were
carried out for each species pair. In addition, positive
control crosses (a cross with a plant of the same genotype) and negative control crosses (emasculation, but
no pollination) were carried out. Once dried, seeds
were harvested and stored for four to six months to
allow for a break of dormancy. F1 seeds were then germinated in ddH20 and sand and, where required, GA3
was added. Parents and F1 plants were evaluated for
different growth parameters and for seed set. Plants
were covered with micro perforated selfing bags and
allowed to self-pollinate. A number of crosses are currently being evaluated at the F2 and BC1 stage.
Genotypic analysis of plants

We used three procedures to genotype the F1 plants.
Leaf tissue samples of the progeny were analyzed for the
presence of the pat protein using antibody based test
strips (Strategic Diagnostics Inc. 111 Pencader Drive,
Newark DE). The presence and integrity of the pat gene
and the T-DNA cassette was confirmed by PCR, using a
combination of T-DNA and pat gene specific primers
(Figure 1), as described by Christianson et al. [37]. Species-specific microsatellite markers [6, Mayerhofer R
(unpublished results)] were used to ensure that the F1
plants were true hybrids.
Genomic DNA extractions from fresh or lyophilized
leaf tissue were performed as described by Mayerhofer
et al. [38]. The microsatellite loci were amplified using a
modified protocol adapted from Schuelke [39]. PCR
reactions contained 0.75 mM MgCl 2, 0.2 mM dNTPs,
0.267 mM reverse and M13 labeled primers, 0.067 mM
forward primer, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase and
50-100 ng of template in 15 μl total volume. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 94°C (5 min.); 30 cycles
of 94°C (30sec), 56°C (45sec), 72°C (45sec); 9 cycles of
94°C (30 sec), 53°C (45 sec), 72°C (45 sec); ending with

Mayerhofer et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:47

72° for 10 minutes. Products from the PCR reactions
were resolved on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. Products
were sized using Genemapper with the GeneScan 600
LIZ size standards (Applied Bioscience).
For those F1 plants where the pat protein was absent,
the presence of specific components of the T-DNA cassette was determined. Figure 1 illustrates the key components of the T-DNA construct and the specific
primers that were used to evaluate the F1 progeny.

MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 mM of each primer, 40 ng
of template and 2.5 units of Qiagen Taq polymerase.
The cycle parameters were 95°C (10 min), followed by
35 cycles of 95°C (20 sec), 59°C (30 sec) and 72°C (45
sec), with a final elongation step of 5 minutes at 72°C.
