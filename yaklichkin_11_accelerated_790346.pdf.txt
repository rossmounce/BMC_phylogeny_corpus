chicken FoxE1

Abstract
Background: The forkhead transcription factor gene E1 (FOXE1) plays an important role in regulation of thyroid
development, palate formation and hair morphogenesis in mammals. However, avian FOXE1 genes have not been
characterized and as such, codon evolution of FOXE1 orthologs in a broader evolutionary context of mammals and
birds is not known.
Results: In this study we identified the avian FOXE1 gene in chicken, turkey and zebra finch, all of which consist of
a single exon. Chicken and zebra finch FOXE1 are uniquely located on the sex-determining Z chromosome. In situ
hybridization shows that chicken FOXE1 is specifically expressed in the developing thyroid. Its expression is initiated
at the placode stage and is maintained during the stages of vesicle formation and follicle primordia. Based on this
expression pattern, we propose that avian FOXE1 may be involved in regulating the evagination and
morphogenesis of thyroid. Chicken FOXE1 is also expressed in growing feathers. Sequence analysis identified two
microdeletions in the avian FOXE1 genes, corresponding to the loss of a transferable repression domain and an
engrailed homology motif 1 (Eh1) C-terminal to the forkhead domain. The avian FOXE1 proteins exhibit a
significant sequence divergence of the C-terminus compared to those of amphibian and mammalian FOXE1. The
codon evolution analysis (dN/dS) of FOXE1 shows a significantly increased dN/dS ratio in the avian lineages,
consistent with either a relaxed purifying selection or positive selection on a few residues in avian FOXE1
evolution. Further site specific analysis indicates that while relaxed purifying selection is likely to be a predominant
cause of accelerated evolution at the 3’-region of avian FOXE1, a few residues might have evolved under positive
selection.
Conclusions: We have identified three avian FOXE1 genes based on synteny and sequence similarity as well as
characterized the expression pattern of the chicken FOXE1 gene during development. Our evolutionary analyses
suggest that while a relaxed purifying selection is likely to be the dominant force driving accelerated evolution of
avian FOXE1 genes, a few residues may have evolved adaptively. This study provides a basis for future genetic and
comparative biochemical studies of FOXE1.

Background
FOXE1 is a member of the large and evolutionarily
ancient family of forkhead domain-containing transcriptional regulators, which are involved in a variety of
developmental and physiological processes in organisms
from yeast to mammals [1]. FOXE1, previously termed

thyroid transcription factor-2, (TTF-2) was originally
isolated by screening a rat cDNA library [2]. The
FOXE1 protein was shown to bind specifically to the
thyroglobulin promoter and function as a transcriptional
repressor [2,3]. During mouse embryogenesis FoxE1 is
expressed in developing thyroid, Rathke’s pouch, palate,
tongue, epiglottis, pharynx, and oesophagus and in the
epithelium of the pharyngeal wall and arches [2,4].
FOXE1 transcripts are also found in the hair follicle and
are regulated by sonic hedgehog signaling in the human
and mouse [5,6]. Consistent with its expression pattern,

FOXE1-null mutant mice exhibit either a sublingual or
completely absent thyroid gland, cleft palate and abnormal hair structure and growth [7,6]. Similarly, mutations
in the forkhead DNA-binding domain of the human
FOXE1 gene cause thyroid agenesis, cleft palate and
choanal atresia similar to the phenotype observed in
FOXE1-null mutant mice [8]. Taken together, the crucial role of FOXE1 in thyroid formation, palate, and hair
development is well established in placental mammals.
Expression of FOXE1 orthologs in other vertebrates is
similar to their mammalian counterparts. For example,
in the Xenopus embryo, foxe1 is expressed in the developing thyroid, pituitary mesoderm of brachial arches
and the pharyngeal endoderm [9]. In the zebrafish
embryo foxe1 is expressed in the thyroid, pharynx, and
pharyngeal skeleton [10]. In addition, the gene is
strongly expressed in the gill and weakly expressed in
the brain, eye, and heart in adult zebrafish. However, in
contrast to the role of FOXE1 in placental mammals, a
loss-of-function study demonstrated that zebrafish foxe1
is not required for the thyroid formation but is necessary for chondrogenesis during pharyngeal skeleton formation [10]. These data suggest that FOXE1 may have
acquired the role in the regulation of thyroid development during the evolution of tetrapods, or may have
lost this role in the fish lineage. On the other hand,
FOXE1 is involved in the regulation of hair morphogenesis, which is a relatively recent skin organ, appearing in
the mammalian lineage [6]. This suggests that FOXE1
has acquired a novel regulatory function in the mammalian lineage. Taken together, the data supports

substantial functional evolution of FOXE1 during vertebrate evolution.
Despite progress in understanding the function of the
mammalian, amphibian and fish FOXE1 genes, nothing
is known about FOXE1 gene in birds. The study of
FOXE1 of birds can help fill the missing link and provide important insights into the evolution of this gene
in vertebrates. Here, we have identified FOXE1 genes in
multiple avian species and characterized its expression
pattern during chicken development using in situ hybridization. Our data shows that chicken FOXE1 expression is limited to developing thyroid and feathers. We
also observe a significant sequence divergence of the Nand C- terminus of the avian FOXE1 proteins and a loss
of two repressive domains. Our codon analysis (dN/dS)
of avian FOXE1 genes suggests that relaxed purifying
selection, or alternatively, positive selection in a subset
of residues, might have driven sequence divergence of
the avian FOXE1 C-terminus.

Results
Identification and characterization of FoxE1 genes of
chicken, zebra finch, and turkey

Chicken FOXE1 is currently listed in the ensembl database as ENSGALG00000023293 located at Chromosome
8: 22,697,482-22,698,342. Although FOXE1 genes in
other species are listed as orthologs for this gene, the
lack of synteny with other FoxE1 genes indicates that
this region is not homologous to FOXE1 but with
FoxE3 (Figure 1). A true homolog (with appropriate synteny) of FOXE1 has not been previously reported in the

Figure 1 Syntenic alignments of putative avian FOXE3 (Chromosome 8) and the FOXE1 homolog (Chromosome Z) are identified with
human (Hsa), mouse (Mmu), chicken (Gga), and zebra finch (Tgu) FOXE3 and FOXE1, respectively.

chicken. We searched for the FOXE1 gene in the
chicken genome database using a mouse FOXE1 gene as
the query sequence in the BLAST search. A genomic
region of the highest homology to the query sequence
was found on the chicken BAC clone CH261-25P17,
representing a part of the sex-determining Z chromosome. The expression of the chicken FOXE1 gene was
confirmed with RT-PCR using a chicken embryonic
cDNA library (data not shown). Analysis of the region
of homology revealed an uninterrupted ORF of 873 bps,
encoding a 290 aa protein sequence with a molecular
weight of 30617 Da (Additional File 1, Figure S1). The
deduced protein sequence shows the highest similarity
to the FOXE1 forkhead domain (53-151aa) with ~88%
identity, whereas the C-terminus outside the forkhead
domain shows a much reduced similarity (less than
30%). The C-terminus of the chicken FOXE1 protein is
shorter (139 aa) than those of orthologous FOXE1 proteins. Moreover, the N-terminal 41 aa of chicken
FOXE1 has no significant similarity to the N-terminal
domains of other FOXE1 proteins. The chicken FOXE1
gene is extremely GC-rich (overall GC-content = 78%),
and the highest GC-content is in the 3’-region of the
gene, encoding the C-terminus (GC-content = 85%)
(Additional File 1, Figure S2). The syntenic arrangement
of surrounding genes confirmed that this was FOXE1
(Figure 1). Thus, we identified the chicken FOXE1 gene
consisting of a single exon similar to orthologous genes.
We further searched for the presence of a zebra finch
FOXE1 using a chicken FOXE1 gene as the query
against the genomic dataset of zebra finch. The blast
search identified a genomic region of 588 bps on the
minus strand of Z chromosome with the coordinates
31552116-31551529 bps, (genome version WUGSC
3.2.4/taeGut1) exhibiting 88% similarity to the chicken
FOXE1 nucleotide sequence. An ORF was identified in
this chromosomal region (Additional File 1, Figure S3),
and the corresponding protein sequence exhibited the
highest homology to FOXE1 proteins. Thus, this similarity clearly indicated that the indentified region is a zebra
finch ortholog of chicken FOXE1 (Additional File 1, Figure S4). However, the zebra finch genomic sequence
lacked a 5’ - part, encoding an entire N-terminus and a
5’ - portion of the forkhead domain because of a gap in
the sequence of the Z chromosome. Nevertheless, the
region represents a major portion of the gene, encoding
a portion of the forkhead domain and an entire Cterminus.
To better characterize FOXE1 in avian lineages, we
further searched for FOXE1 gene in the reference genome of turkey. However, despite the recent sequencing
of the turkey genome, the FOXE1 gene sequence was
not identified. Upon closer inspection, we concluded
that the corresponding genomic region is missing from

Page 3 of 14

the turkey reference genome. Therefore, we identified
the FOXE1 gene from turkey by direct genomic PCR
amplification and sequencing. Remarkably, the putative
turkey FOXE1 gene exhibited 97% identity to the
chicken gene, which is consistent with the reported high
similarity of chicken and turkey genomes [11].
Interestingly, avian FOXE1 genes in both chicken and
zebra finch are located on the sex-determining Z chromosome, which is distinct from the chromosomal location of vertebrate orthologs. Fish and mammalian
FOXE1 are located on autosomal chromosomes (data
not shown). This difference in localization indicates two
possibilities: the avian FOXE1 was either part of the
ancestral autosomal chromosome which has evolved
into the Z chromosome in an ancestral amniote [12], or
FOXE1 genomic locus was translocated onto the Z chromosome. Synteny between the chicken chromosome Z
and human Chromosome 9, which includes the sex
determining DMRT1, indicates that the chromosome Z
evolved from the autosomal chromosome [13]. Human
FOXE1 is located on chromosome 9. Therefore, a distinctive chromosomal localization of avian FOXE1 in
birds is likely associated with the ancestral autosomal
chromosome that subsequently evolved into the Z
chromosome.
In summary, by synteny-based analysis of orthology in
chicken, and by direct sequencing in turkey, we have
identified the avian orthologs of mammalian FOXE1
gene, at least two of which are localized on the sexdetermining Z chromosome.
Expression of chicken FoxE1 gene is restricted to the
developing thyroid and feathers

To determine the expression pattern of FOXE1 during
chicken embryogenesis, whole mount in situ hybridization was performed on chicken embryos spanning
embryonic stages 3-42 [14] with a 504 bps antisense
probe for FOXE1. Expression of FOXE1 was observed at
but not before stage 14, and was restricted to the primordial thyroid placode (Figure 2A). At this stage the
thyroid placode is forming by anterior bending of the
pharynx floor, and is characterized by a low proliferative
index [15]. FOXE1 expression is clearly visible when the
placode is discernible (Figure 2E). At stage 17, the thyroid primordium is in an advanced stage of evagination,
and expression of FOXE1 was more pronounced in the
indentations rather than in the shoulders of the evagination (Figure 2F). At stage 18, expression of FOXE1 was
restricted to the anterior pharynx at the level of the second pharyngeal arch (Figure 2C). By stage 19, the thyroid develops into a vesicle [14]. FOXE1 expression is
maintained in the forming vesicle during budding off of
the gland from the pharynx. FOXE1 expression is maintained at stage 25 (Figure 2D) when the thyroid

separates from the pharynx and exhibits a dramatic
change in shape that marks the beginning of bilobation
[15]. At stage 35, the thyroid is invaded by vascular and
connective tissues and strong expression of FOXE1 was
observed throughout the follicle primordium (Figure
2G). This suggests that FOXE1 may be involved in the
maturation of the gland as well. We confirmed this tissue as the developing thyroid using the transcription

factor gene HHEX, which is expressed in the developing
thyroid ([16] Figure 2H, I). HHEX, is important for proliferation of thyroid cell precursors and for thyroid morphogenesis [17]. In situ hybridization showed that
expression domains of FOXE1 and HHEX are similar,
clearly marking the developing thyroid. Although no
expression of FOXE1 was detected in feather buds at
stages 30-35, FOXE1 is expressed in distal growing

feathers by HH stage 42 (Figure 2J). Interestingly, no
chicken FOXE1 expression was observed in the developing pituitary or, palate, as has been reported for amphibian and murine FOXE1 genes, respectively. In
conclusion, in situ hybridization analysis shows that
chicken FOXE1 is a thyroid and feather-specific transcription factor, and suggests a possible role for FOXE1
in the evagination, and morphogenesis of the thyroid
and feathers.
Evolution of the avian FoxE1 proteins: a loss of a
repressive domain and the Eh1 motif

To investigate the basis for the size reduction and
sequence divergence of the avian FOXE1 proteins relative to mammalian and amphibian counterparts, we

constructed a multiple sequence alignment of all FOXE1
genes. The sequence alignment revealed two deletions at
the C-terminus: a first deletion corresponding to 66 aa
and a second deletion corresponding to 28 aa protein
region (Figure 3). The first deletion resulted in an avianspecific loss of a 21 aa aromatic domain (Figure 3),
which previously was shown to exhibit transcriptional
repression activity in cell culture [3]. The second deletion led to the loss of sequences encoding almost the
entire Eh1 motif and adjacent sequences except for a
conserved phenylalanine residue, which is preserved in
avian proteins. The Eh1 motif is a conserved eight
amino acid sequence FSIN[TSN]L[IV][GH], which is
present in a majority of foxe1 proteins of fish, amphibians and non-placental mammals [18]. Similarly, the

FOXE1 proteins has lost the engrailed homology motif 1 (Eh1) and the aromatic repression domain during evolution, due to the two
microdeletions, probably occurring in the lineage of birds. The aromatic repression domain is highlighted with the yellow box and the Eh1 motif
with the red box in the aligned protein sequences. The numbers on the left indicate the positions of amino acid residues in the respective
sequences. The positions for FOXE1 of T. guttata (zebra finch) are enumerated from the forkhead domain due to the missing N-terminal
sequences.

Yaklichkin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:302

loss of the Eh1 motif is observed in FOXE1 of placental
mammals (Figure 3) (Yaklichkin, Kessler, unpublished
data). The Eh1 motif is known to mediate physical interactions of FOX proteins with the Groucho/TLE corepressors [19,20].
Additionally, a novel feature in the avian FOXE1 proteins is the presence of an N-terminal polyalanine repeat
(Additional File 2, Figure S5), varying from five to nine
alanine residues. The polyalanine repeat is also found in
FOXE1 of mammals where it is distal to the forkhead
domain, but is absent in FOXE1 proteins of amphibians
and fish. This suggests that the avian polyalanine repeat
arose independently in the avian lineage. The C-terminus of the chicken FOXE1 protein is also enriched with
alanine, glycine, and proline residues (Additional File 1,
Table S1), as well as short tandem repeats of proline
and alanine (Additional File 1, Table S2; [21]). Proline
and alanine-enriched domains are commonly found in
transcriptional repressors [22]. This suggests that the
avian FOXE1 protein may function as a transcriptional
repressor. Thus, while there appears to be an avian-

Page 6 of 14

specific loss of two repressive domains in FOXE1 as a
result of deletions, we also found an avian specific gain
in proline-alanine repeats, which can potentially confer
transcriptional repressive activity to avian FOXE1.
Analysis of codon evolution in the avian lineage of FOXE1

Next we investigated whether, consistent with a functional divergence, FOXE1 has experienced accelerated
evolution (relaxed purifying selection, or positive selection) specifically in bird ancestry and specific bird
lineages using codeml [23]. Multiple sequence alignment
was constructed using three bird and seven other tetrapod FOXE1 sequences encoding a portion of the forkhead domain and an entire C-terminus, where most of
the sequence divergence in the available sequence is
concentrated. We first compared two models of evolution using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) [24]. In Model-0
(one-ratio model) all lineages were assumed to have the
same evolutionary rate ω0 (dN/dS) in the gene phylogeny (Figure 4); the most likely estimate of ω0 in this
case was 0.052. According to Model-1 (two-ratio

of substitutions per codon along the branch as estimated by the program Mega4. Branches B (common ancestor of birds) and Gl (common
ancestor of Galliformes) were the lineages of the analysis in free branch models.

Yaklichkin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:302

model), the bird lineages and their ancestral lineage (a
total of 5 branches) evolved at a rate of ω1 while all
other lineages evolved at rate ω0. The estimates of ω0
and ω1 were 0.0386 and 0.1042, respectively, corresponding to a 2.7-fold increase in the evolutionary rate
in the bird lineage. Model-1 had a significantly better fit
to the data than Model-0 (P = 0.0009). In Model-2
(three-ratio model) we assumed that the common ancestor of Galliformes (the order of turkey and chicken), and
turkey and chicken were evolving at rate ω2 and the
common ancestor of the avian species and zebra finch
were evolving at ω1, while all other lineages evolved
with rate ω0. Comparing this model with the first model
yielded a P-value = 0.003, with ω0 = 0.038, ω1 = 0.12,
and ω2 = 0.083. In Model-3 (three-ratio model), we
assumed ω2 for the zebra finch branch and ω1 for the
four branches - common ancestor of all birds and the
three Galliformes branches. Comparing this model with
the first model resulted in a P-value = 0.0002, with ω0 =
0.038, ω1 = 0.12, and ω2 = 0.4801 corresponding to a
12.4-fold increase in the evolutionary rate in the zebra
finch lineage. These results indicate that there is overall
evidence of accelerated evolution in avian FOXE1. Thus,
we conclude that FOXE1 is likely to have evolved either

Page 7 of 14

under relaxed purifying selection or restricted positive
selection in a few specific residues in the avian lineage.
Placental FOXE1 genes, which also lost the Eh1 motif,
were tested for evolutionary rate by assigning ω1 to the
placental branch, which resulted in ω0 = 0.0561 and ω1
= 0.0476. Thus, no increase of the evolutionary rate in
FOXE1 of placental mammals is observed in our dataset.
This suggests that overall, avian FOXE1 has experienced
either relaxed purifying selection or positive selection on
a few specific residues.
As an alternative analysis, we also estimated the
average dN/dS profile in the sliding window analysis
across FOXE1 sequences of three pairs of species
groups - birds and mammals, birds and amphibians,
and, mammals and amphibians (Figure 5). A low dN/
dS ratio is estimated for the forkhead domain in all
groups, which is indicative of a strong purifying selection. In contrast, the dN/dS profile shows a large variation in the C-terminal region of FOXE1.
Nonsynonymous substitutions were predominantly
concentrated within the C-terminus of FOXE1. In the
two groups that included the birds, dN/dS is much
more pronounced when compared to the amphibian
and mammal groups.

The analysis is given across the coding regions of FOXE1 genes. In each case, the window was set at 60 bps and step 12 bps.

Next, we applied the branch-site model to estimate
the fraction of codons that are likely to have evolved
under positive selection specifically in the five avian
branches using the BEB procedure implemented in
PAML. We used the five avian branches as the foreground and the other branches as background. The test
compares two models: (1) no change in selection was
observed in the foreground branches compared to the
background branches, and (2) a certain proportion of
sites went from being under negative or no selection in
the background branches to being under positive selection in the foreground branch. The LRT test statistic
(2Δl) of the second model relative to the first model
was 13.65 (P = 0.001, df = 2), indicating that a certain
fraction of sites did undergo positive selection specifically in the avian lineages. Based on the Bayesian posterior probabilities (BEB) of site class, this analysis detected
nineteen sites with BEB ≥ 0.5. Of those, six sites were
selected in the branch leading to Galliformes; however,
the BEB values for these were less than 0.8. Two of the
sites, 196Q and 203L, were detected to be adaptively
evolving in bird lineages with probability > 0.95. There
were seven additional sites with BEB ≥ 0.8, which are
134R (0.927), 162A (0.858), 164R (0.898), 173P (0.923),
175P (0.884), 211P (0.80) and 249R (0.89). The amino
acid coordinates are provided relative to the chicken
FOXE1 protein. These results indicate a change in selective pressure on specific amino acids on the branch
leading to birds.
A single positively selected site, 134R, was identified
within a forkhead DNA-binding domain, which resulted
in the non-synonymous substitution of Arg to Glu. The
rest of the positively selected residues were identified in
the C-termius, which is likely to be involved in proteinprotein interactions. It is known that the trans-regulatory domains of transcriptional factors are comprised of
short co-factor interaction motifs. By adapting a BLAST
search for short sequences, we searched for short Cterminal segments of chicken FOXE1, consisting of 20
residues with the positively selected sites. We found that
segment 195-207 aa of the chicken FOXE1 protein
exhibited a high similarity to the N-terminal region of
the homeobox-related transcriptional factor HOXA13
(Figure 6A). The hit between FOXE1 and HOXA13 had
the highest score of ~30 bits. This sequence contains
two adaptively evolving sites, 196Q and 203L, with the
highest posterior probability, and 199S with BEB = 0.75.
Based on the highest scores and number of hits, the
match is likely to be associated with transcriptional
function. Interestingly, the majority of HOXA13 proteins that exhibited the match were from tetrapods; catfish HOXA13 was detected but with a lower log-odds
score. The region of similarity in HOXA13 proteins is
located in the N-terminal domain outside of the

Page 8 of 14

homeodomain. Therefore, it may be potentially associated with activation or protein interaction function.
Another short segment, 209-225 aa matched short proline enriched sequences in homeobox proteins HOXB3
and HOXA4 in the BLAST search with a score of 30
bits (Figure 6B). This sequence contains a positive
selected site, 211P with a BEB = 0.80. This short
sequence is also enriched with proline and alanine residues, which are commonly found in minimal repression
domains [22]. It is possible that this sequence can exhibit repressive activity and an increase of the proline residues can enhance repressive activity. The consensus of
both sequences is shown on Figure 6C. In HOXB3 this
sequence is located in the N-terminus outside of the
homeodomain. The search of hits to other segments of
avian FOXE1 proteins with the selected sites did not
retrieve any significant matches to other transcriptional
factors. Thus, we were able to identify two potentially
functional sequences in avian FOXE1 proteins containing four positively selected sites.

Discussion
In this study we report on the identification of the
FOXE1 gene of three bird species and the characterization of FOXE1 expression pattern during chicken
embryogenesis. Both FOXE1 of chicken and zebra finch
are distinctively localized on the sex-determining Z
chromosome, in contrast to placental and marsupial
FOXE1 genes which are localized on autosomes. In situ
hybridization shows that the expression of the chicken
FOXE1 gene is restricted to the developing thyroid and
feathers. Its thyroid expression is initiated at the stage of
placode formation when the thyroid cells evaginate from
the pharyngeal floor and migrate, and is also maintained
during the stage of thyroid maturation. The process of
evagination is characterized by tissue remodeling, which
includes modulation of cell adhesiveness and cell mobility. Based on the pattern of FOXE1 expression, we propose that the transcription factor FOXE1 may regulate
evagination of thyroid primordia by regulating specific
genes required for cell motility and adhesiveness. This
observation is supported by previous loss- and gain-offunction studies in the mouse and cell culture, respectively. For example, in FOXE1-null mice the secondary
palate remains opened [7], which indicates inability of
the palate shelves to adhere in the mutant mice [25].
Forced expression of mammalian FOXE1 in cell culture
resulted in significantly increased expression of an actinbinding protein, tropomyosin isoform 3, and lower
expression of integrin beta-1 and collagen type XI
alpha-1 [26]. Tropomyosin has been shown to be important for regulating the actin mechanics in the cell cytoskeleton, and can mediate changes in cell morphology,
adhesion and migration [27,28]. Similarly, integrin beta-

1 has been shown to mediate cell migration [29]. Moreover, it has been recently shown that human FOXE1
directly regulates the signaling molecule TGF-3b [30],
which in turn, is involved in regulation of cellular

adhesion and extracellular matrix [31]. Thus, FOXE1
may be involved in regulation of a set of genes and signaling pathways that are required for controlling cell
adhesiveness and motility during migration and

morphogenesis of thyroid cells. In the future, it will be
important to determine whether chicken FOXE1 directly
regulates a similar set of genes during the migration and
morphogenesis of the thyroid gland. We also detected
expression of FOXE1 in the growing feather, which suggests the acquisition of a novel expression domain by
FOXE1 in the bird ancestry; since the feather is a bird
specific integumentary appendage.
Two striking features are found in the sequence of
avian FOXE1 proteins, which are the sequence divergence of the C-terminus and the loss of two functional
domains: a C-terminal aromatic domain and the Eh1
motif as a consequence of two microdeletions. Both
domains appear to be involved in mediating transcriptional repression. The aromatic domain of the mammalian FOXE1 protein can inhibit transcription in cell
culture when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding
domain, thus acting as a transferable repression domain
[3]. Nothing is known about direct targets of this repression domain. Interestingly, mammalian FOXE1 represses
transcriptional activation mediated by PAX8 in cell culture, which suggests that it may directly interact with
transcription factor PAX8, possibly via this repression
domain [3]. We noted that the avian genomes lack transcription factor PAX8 (personal communication), which
is important for thyroid formation in mammals [32].
This is consistent with an extensive loss of genes in the
chicken genome [33]. Thus, it would be interesting to
determine whether the loss of the aromatic repressive
domain was associated with the loss of the PAX8 locus
in birds.
The Eh1 motif is a conserved amino acid sequence
[18], known to mediate physical interaction of other Fox
proteins with Groucho/TLE co-repressors. FOXG1,
SLP2 (FOXG), FOXD3 and FOXH1 have been shown to
interact physically with Groucho/TLE co-repressors via
the Eh1 motif ([19,20,34] Yaklichkin and Kessler,
unpublished data). Strikingly, the Eh1 motif is conserved
in all FOXE1 of fish, amphibians, and non-placental
mammals, but it was lost in those of birds. Interestingly,
a loss of the Eh1 motif is also observed in FOXE1 of
placental mammals as an outcome of a microdeletion
(Yaklichkin and Kessler, unpublished data). The loss of
the Eh1 motif in the avian FOXE1 protein is likely to
lead to the loss of Groucho/TLE recruiting activity
mediated by the Eh1 motif, and the loss of specific
repressive activity dependent on the aromatic domain.
Even though the functional implication of both domain
losses in avian FOXE1 proteins is not clear, it is likely
to affect transcriptional function. It is intriguing that the
loss of two putative repressive domains is accompanied
by a gain of an N-terminal polyalanine repeat. The avian
FOXE1 domain losses may be associated with either
functional divergence, loss of co-factor interacting

proteins, or even reduction of expression domain. In
situ hybridization in the chicken embryo shows that
expression of FOXE1 is restricted to the developing
thyroid and feathers, and no expression was observed in
other internal embryonic tissues. FOXE1 orthologs have
additional domain expressions other than in developing
thyroid. For instance, frog foxe1 is expressed both in the
developing thyroid and pituitary [9]. Foxe1 of zebrafish
is expressed in pharyngeal skeleton, gills and thyroid
[10]. It is certainly possible that the reduction of expression of FOXE1 in birds has resulted in the loss of these
functional sequences. Similarly, a loss of the Eh1 motif
in FOXE1 of placental mammals can possibly be associated with a novel functional requirement.
To investigate the role of selection in the evolution of
FOXE1 coding regions in the avian lineages, we used
various models of codon evolution dN/dS (ω). Overall,
dN/dS (ω) of FOXE1 was estimated to be less than 1,
which suggested that FOXE1 were evolving under purifying selection. Significant increase of the dN/dS ratio
was estimated between the branches of avian FOXE1
and those of mammals and amphibians, which is indicative of a change in the selection and of the acceleration
of evolution of avian 3’FOXE1. The increase of the dN/
dS ratio can be a result of either a relaxation of purifying selection or positive selection in specific sites of the
C-terminal domain of FOXE1 in the avian lineage. In
paralogous regulatory genes, the relaxation of purifying
selection was proposed to be a result of paralogous proteins binding to a subset of interacting proteins relative
to the ancestral gene copy [35]. By this analogy, relaxation of purifying selection in avian FOXE1 could be a
result of loss of ancestral protein interactions and possibly formation of interaction with novel binding proteins.
Overall, the C-terminal domain is subjected to fewer
functional constraints when compared to the DNAbinding forkhead domain. An increased evolutionary
rate of C-terminal regions can be attributed to the capacity of trans-regulatory domains to interact with co-factors and the transcriptional machinery via short
interaction motifs. In turn, interaction peptide motifs
can evolve quickly due to short size and low affinity of
interaction with co-factors [36].
Our branch-site model identified eighteen C-terminus
residues under positive selection in the avian lineage,
and two residues, 196Q and 203L, had the highest posterior probability, suggestive of adaptive evolution. Only
a single adaptively evolving residue, 134R, was identified
in the forkhead DNA-binding domain, which resulted in
a non-synonymous substitution in the avian lineage,
whereas all other residues lie in the C-terminus. Interestingly, the 196Q and 203L residues are located in a
segment (195-207 aa) of avian FOXE1 proteins. This
segment shows a strong homology to N-terminal short

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/302

sequences of the homeobox HOXA13 proteins. The Nterminal portion of the HOXA13 protein contains a
trans-regulatory domain, which is likely involved in regulation of transcription. Mouse HOXA13 has been
shown to function as a negative regulator [37]. Moreover, HOXA13 can inhibit Smad-mediated activation of
transcription by binding directly to Smad co-factors via
the N-terminus [38]. However, refined mapping of
Smad-interacting sequences have not been conducted. It
is likely that the region (195-207 aa) is involved in regulation of transcription based on high homology to the
N-terminal segment of homeodomain-containing
HOXA13 protein, and adaptively evolving residues may
have contributed to avian specific FOXE1 function.
A residue 211P under positive selection was found in
the FOXE1 segment (214-225 aa) enriched with proline
and alanine residues. This segment shares a high similarity with N-terminal sequences of HOXB3 and
HOXA4 proteins of mammals, which are also enriched
with proline and alanine residues. Interestingly, the
mouse HOXB3 protein can function as a transcriptional
repressor [39], and is expressed in the thyroid primordia
and regulates its migration [40]. Minimal repression
domains of metazoan transcription factors are known to
be often enriched with proline and alanine residues [22].
It is thus predicated that this region may be involved in
repression of transcription. It is possible that the avianspecific gain of proline residues has contributed to
enhancement of repressive characteristics or the formation of novel avian-specific motifs. Additionally, we cannot exclude the contribution of the N-terminus to
transcriptional activity of avian FOXE1, which has
gained polyalanine repeats. Thus, relaxed selection in
the avian lineage may be the predominant contributor
to the accelerated evolution of avian FOXE1 and significant sequence divergence of the C-terminus, whereas a
limited positive selection could lead to the formation of
novel avian specific transcriptional motifs.
Evolution of gene expression, and thus, the evolution
of transcription factors, is likely to play a major role in
morphological evolution. Because of the pleiotropic
effects of changes in transcription factor sequence, some
have argued that changes in gene regulatory networks
are predominantly mediated via changes in DNA cis-elements [41]. However, negative pleiotropic effects can be
limited by tissue-restricted expression of transcription
factors and changes in the transcription factor
sequences affecting their interaction with other tissuespecific co-factors [42]. This seems to be the case for
FOXE1 evolution in birds. However, directed experiments will be needed to further clarify the functional
underpinnings of the evolutionary divergence of avian
FOXE1.

Conclusions
Identification of functional FOXE1 orthologs and their
codon analysis can provide important insight into their
contribution to vertebrate evolution, and offer a foundation for the study of their function across vertebrates.
Comparative biochemical studies will be necessary to
determine transcriptional function and the effect of the
loss of two functional domains in comparison to the
other FOXE1 proteins. Building on ongoing functional
and structural studies should yield a comprehensive
understanding of the evolution of FOXE1 in vertebrates.
Methods
DNA and protein sequences

DNA sequences of FOXE1 were obtained from the
NCBI database http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and the
Ensembl database (http://ensembl.org, v47). The
FOXE1 sequences of chicken, zebra finch and turkey
identified in this study were deposited under the accession numbers BK008024, BK008025 and AEE88205,
correspondently at the NCBI database. The accession
numbers of FOXE1 sequences obtained from the NCBI
are following: Homo sapiens (NP_004464), Mus musculus (NP_899121.1), Xenopus laevis (AAS82575.1),
Xenopus tropicalis (XP_002936729.1), Macropus eugenii
(ADN52078.1),
Monodelphis
domestica
(XP_001372714.1), and FOXE1 of Sus scrofa
(ENSSSCT00000005909) was obtained from the
Ensembl database v47. The sequence of chicken
FOXE1 was obtained from a Z chromosome BAC
sequence (AC192757.2) in NCBI. The sequence of
zebra finch FOXE1 was obtained from the chromosomal Z region - 31551529-31552116 bp (genome version WUGSC 3.2.4/taeGut1), from UCSC Genome
Browser http://genome.ucsc.edu.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis

Analysis of amino acid composition of deduced FOXE1
protein sequences was performed using the SAPS program (isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/SAPS_form.html; [21]). A
search of FOXE1 in the NCBI chicken genome database
was performed using the BLAST server http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov. Identification of the Eh1 motif in FOXE1
sequences was performed in accordance with the previously described sequence analysis [18]. Multiple
sequence alignments were constructed using T-COFFEE,
version 7.7.1. (tcoffee.vital-it.ch/cgi-bin/Tcoffee/tcoffee_cgi/index.cgi; [43]). Indels (small insertion or deletion mutations/sequencing errors) in the aligned
sequences were removed using the alignment editor
BioEdit 7.0.4.1. http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/page2.
html. Syntenic alignment was generated by comparing
the surrounding genomic region in ensembl and

Yaklichkin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:302
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/302

metazome http://www.metazome.net. A phylogenetic
tree of FOXE1 genes was constructed by using the software Phylip 3.69 [44]. The phylogenetic tree was converted into a cladogram using MEGA 4 http://www.
megasoftware.net/.
dN/dS analysis

The dN/dS (ω) analysis was performed using the program Codeml in the PAML package 3.13 [23] to assess
whether FOXE1 evolved under a differential selection in
the avian lineage, relative to the rest of the phylogeny.
We specifically performed the analysis on the C-terminus of the avian FOXE1 proteins. Positive selection on
specific bird lineages were tested using branch models.
A model in which ω was fixed across the tree (oneratio) was compared with models in which ω was
allowed to differ in a subset of branches (two- and
three-ratio models), and the significance of the difference was assessed using the likelihood ratio tests (LRTs).
To identify the sites under positive selection along the
avian FOXE1 genes, we used the branch-site model A.
We used the avian branch set as the foreground
branches and all other branches as the background. We
then tested whether a model which allows a subset of
background sites under neutral or purifying selection, to
evolve under neutral or positive selection in the foreground. Model significance was tested using the LRTs
termed Test 1. In Test 1 branch-site model A is compared with two degrees of freedom to a site model
(M1a, “Nearly Neutral”) with two site classes: 0 < ω0 <
1 and ω2 = 1. In addition, PAML also computes for
each site the posterior probability of belonging to the
class that undergoes an increase in dN/dS.
To visualize variation in ω along FOXE1 genes, a slide
window analysis was conducted using the software
SWAAP 1.0.3. http://asiago.stanford.edu/SWAAP/
SwaapPage.htm. A window size was set to 60 bps and
the step size to 12 bps. Values of ω were estimated in
accordance with the Nei and Gojobori method.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification and
Sequencing of genomic DNA

Turkey blood was kindly donated by Bolton Turkey
Farm, Silverdale, PA. Genomic DNA was isolated from
the blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (cat.

pairs of primers were designed to regions with 100%
identity shared between chicken and zebra finch FOXE1
genes, and upstream and downstream regions of chicken
FOXE1. Primer sequences are available by request. PCR
fragments covering the single exon FOXE1 were amplified using GC-RICH PCR System (cat. number: 12 140
306 001), Roche Applied Science. PCR mixture was
made in accordance with the protocol of the maker.

using 1 μg of RNA per a reverse Transcription (RT) reaction with the Tetro cDNA Synthesis Kit (cat. number:
Bio-65042). PCR was used for template generation with
the GC-rich PCR System Kit (cat. number: 12 140 306
001), Roche Applied Science; 34 cycles of annealing at
50°C were performed. PCR products were isolated and
purified with the QIAquick Purification Kit (cat. number:

reverse primer, 5’GCTCTAGAAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGgcggggacgaacctGTCG3’. Chicken FOXE1
sequences are bolded, the T3 RNA polymerase binding
site is italicized, remaining sequence contains restriction
sites (PsiI, HindIII, NotI, XbaI). The PCR generated
cDNA template was sequenced to confirm identity. A
standard 504 bps RNA probe of FOXE1 was produced
