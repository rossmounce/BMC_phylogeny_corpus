Abstract
Background: The best documented survival responses of organisms to past climate change on short (glacialinterglacial) timescales are distributional shifts. Despite ample evidence on such timescales for local adaptations of
populations at specific sites, the long-term impacts of such changes on evolutionary significant units in response
to past climatic change have been little documented. Here we use phylogenies to reconstruct changes in
distribution and flowering ecology of the Cape flora - South Africa’s biodiversity hotspot - through a period of past
(Neogene and Quaternary) changes in the seasonality of rainfall over a timescale of several million years.
Results: Forty-three distributional and phenological shifts consistent with past climatic change occur across the
flora, and a comparable number of clades underwent adaptive changes in their flowering phenology (9 clades; half
of the clades investigated) as underwent distributional shifts (12 clades; two thirds of the clades investigated). Of
extant Cape angiosperm species, 14-41% have been contributed by lineages that show distributional shifts
consistent with past climate change, yet a similar proportion (14-55%) arose from lineages that shifted flowering
phenology.
Conclusions: Adaptive changes in ecology at the scale we uncover in the Cape and consistent with past climatic
change have not been documented for other floras. Shifts in climate tolerance appear to have been more
important in this flora than is currently appreciated, and lineages that underwent such shifts went on to contribute
a high proportion of the flora’s extant species diversity. That shifts in phenology, on an evolutionary timescale and
on such a scale, have not yet been detected for other floras is likely a result of the method used; shifts in
flowering phenology cannot be detected in the fossil record.

Background
Niche conservatism - the tendency of species to retain
ancestral limits in tolerances to environmental factors has a long history [1,2]. From a theoretical perspective,
it is supported by the expectation that rates of adaptation of populations to environments outside of the fundamental niche are slow relative to the time to
extinction in such environments [3-6]. These assertions
based on theory have been followed by a suite of

empirical studies that have found evidence both for
niche conservatism [7-9] and against it [10-12]. In a
recent review, Wiens and Graham [13] conclude that
whether niches are conserved or not may simply depend
on how similar niches must be to be considered conserved, and that a more productive focus might be on
how well the concept of niche conservatism allows us to
predict outcomes in different areas of ecology and
evolution.
Here we use a phylogenetic approach to investigate
changes in distribution and flowering phenology of a
species-rich flora through a period in which it was
exposed to numerous climatic changes of a consistent

and repetitive nature, and compare how organisms that
responded in different ways have contributed to extant
species diversity. Our study uses phylogenies representing 20% of the extant angiosperm flora of the Cape of
South Africa (1800 of the 8900 species), a biodiversity
hotspot that has experienced climatic changes associated
with strong seasonal aridification since the Neogene (ca.
2-14 million years ago), likely in several different
episodes [14].
Elsewhere in the world, at an intra-specific level, a
plethora of past studies have found evidence for local
adaptation to contemporary climate change at specific
sites [15], although some dispute this evidence in all but
a minority of cases [16,17]. However at the level of species or evolutionarily significant units, the traditional
view is based on the fossil record [18-20], which shows
that in response to past climatic changes in the Quaternary (fluctuations occurring on the timescale of thousands of years, within the last 2.6 million years) species
underwent dramatic distributional shifts, but retained
remarkable stability in phenotype and inferred ecology.
The importance of distributional shifts on this timescale
is further supported by the success of ecological niche
models in predicting ancient distributions [21,22].
Over timescales of millions of years, the documented
response of floras to past environmental change is that
of species-level turnover [23,24]. It is likely that there is
a strong adaptive component to such turnover, but an
understanding of the relative roles of adaptation and
species sorting is complicated by the fact that the timescale of change (hundreds of thousands to millions of
years) corresponds to the typical duration of species;
many of the characters detected in the fossil record that
may exhibit adaptive responses to past climatic change
(e.g. leaf micromorphological features such as stomatal
density and distribution, and trichome abundance) are
themselves used for species delimitation. While flowering phenology is subject to strong physiological constraints and therefore likely to be strongly linked to
climate, it cannot be inferred from the fossil record,
regardless of timescale. Reconstructions based on molecular phylogenetic data offer certain advantages over the
fossil record with respect to these issues. Notably, the
characters used for lineage delimitation are different
from those used to detect adaptive responses to climate
change. Further, it is possible to include in an analysis
both a wide breadth of lineages, including those absent
from the fossil record, and any character identifiable
across their living representatives.
The species-rich Cape Floristic Region (CFR) provides
a model system in which to assess the utility of niche
conservatism in explaining floral responses to past climatic change. Firstly, the concentration of the Cape’s
floral species diversity within a small number of

Page 2 of 11

unusually large endemic or near-endemic radiations permits the development of robust phylogenetic hypotheses
through intense sampling focused in a small geographic
area. Consequently, molecular phylogenetic coverage of
plant lineages in this biota is more complete than that
of any other biodiversity hotspot. Secondly, despite
being unusually species-rich both for its area and latitude, the entire seed-plant flora has been catalogued,
with detailed locality and phenological information
available for each species [25]. Thirdly, the CFR spans
two regions with a major difference in climatic regime
(Figure 1). The eastern region has a nonseasonal rainfall
climate, while the western region has a strictly winter
rainfall (Mediterranean-type) climate. Evidence from
global climate data support a nonseasonal rainfall climate across the Cape in the Early-Mid Miocene [26,27].
This was followed by a seasonal aridification trend along
the west coast [14], the precise timing of which is
uncertain, in which summer rainfall was reduced and
winter rainfall was increased. Evidence from fossil data
supports numerous later fluctuations between nonseasonal rainfall and winter rainfall regimes in the western
region, culminating in the modern winter rainfall regime
in the western region [28-34]. However the number and
precise timing of these fluctuations remain uncertain.
The current flora of the winter rainfall region shows
a peak of flowering in the spring (September-October),
while that of the nonseasonal rainfall region shows a
peak in late-spring/early summer (October-November)
[35]. Species in the winter rainfall region also show a
shorter mean duration of flowering (3.21 months, n =
3670 for all seed plant species; 3.05 months, n = 877
for all species in clades sampled) than species confined
to the east (4.04 months, n = 2316 for all seed plant
species; 3.56 months, n = 373 for all species in clades
sampled; [25]). These two patterns are consistent with
expectations if insufficient moisture for physiological
activity is the main factor limiting summer flowering
in the CFR [35]. Species occupying the Cape-wide nonseasonal rainfall regime prior to the summer aridification trend, and that were physiologically vulnerable to
the new climate, could have survived by adapting to
the new climate, by changing their distribution, or a
combination of the two. Based on the broad pattern of
aridification since the Mid Miocene, the predicted
direction of adaptive changes in phenology would be
from long-duration summer flowering to shorterduration spring flowering. This predicted directionality
holds regardless of whether adaptive changes are the
result of fixed genetic changes or plastic responses. In
terms of distribution, reduced survival in the west, and
distributional shifts towards the east where the effects
of summer aridification were less severe, would also be
predicted.

Figure 1 Location of the Cape Floristic Region in southern Africa as defined by Goldblatt & Manning [25]. Western and eastern regions
with winter and nonseasonal rainfall regimes, respectively, are indicated, along with representative seasonal rainfall charts (after [84]).

We compiled molecular phylogenies representing 20%
of the angiosperm species diversity of the CFR [36-50]
as defined by Goldblatt and Manning [25]. These 18
molecular phylogenies represent monophyletic floral
clades largely or entirely restricted to the Cape, estimated to have diversified within the last 46 Myr
[39,40,42,45,47,48,50-55]. Published data [25] for geographical distributions and for the timing and duration of
flowering of extant species were used to reconstruct
maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the ancestral
states of these clades.
Our aim was to test the relative contribution of distributional shifts and adaptive change in the response of
the Cape flora to climatic changes since the midMiocene. If niche conservatism predominates, then

lineages must track the non-seasonal rainfall regime from
the West to the East in order to continue to occupy a physiologically favourable environment. We therefore expect
lineages whose ancestors experienced climate change in
the West to show distributional shifts to the East.
A species’ niche is the multidimensional set of biotic
and abiotic conditions in which it is able to persist and
maintain stable population sizes. For a flowering plant,
one aspect of its overall niche is its flowering phenology i.e. the timing and duration of its flowering period. Since
flowering is known to be limited physiologically by many
aspects of climate [56], we consider flowering phenology
to be one of the suitable dimensions of niche space in
which to look for adaptive shifts in response to past
changes in climate in the Cape. Adaptive changes in

Warren et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/39

phenology could considerably modify species climate
envelopes, but not necessarily accompany a shift of
biome or vegetation type. Whether adaptive changes
result from fixed genetic changes or plastic responses is
best determined by experimental transplantation of
plants, which has not yet been carried out in the Cape.
These two mechanisms cannot be distinguished on the
basis of phylogeny alone. Nonetheless, the identification
of the scale of such changes using phylogeny can serve
as a stimulus for future experimental work. In screening
the Cape flora for changes consistent with predictions
under past seasonal aridification, we find a number of
distributional shifts. Surprisingly however, shifts in flowering phenology of lineages consistent with predictions
also occur, are similar in frequency to distributional
shifts, and belong to lineages that have proceeded to
contribute a large proportion of species-diversity to the
extant flora.

Results
Our phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrate that 9
clades have undergone shifts in flowering pattern consistent with predictions based on past climate change
(Figure 2; Table 1). How the number of shifts per Cape
clade are counted depends on the treatment of nodes
for which character states are unresolved; we use the
basal-most possible position of shifts (as in additional
file 1: AF1.pdf) in order to produce figures that are
comparable across Cape clades. On this basis, shifts in
flowering pattern consistent with predictions consist of
one (Figure 2, and see AF1.pdf, Trees 5, 8, 10, 12 &13),
two (AF1.pdf, Tree 6) or four (AF1.pdf, Tree 5) shifts in
flowering duration per Cape clade, and one (AF1.pdf,
Trees 3, 5, 6 & 9) or two (AF1.pdf, Tree 5) shifts in the
timing of flowering per Cape clade, making a total of
eleven shifts in flowering duration and six shifts in the
timing of flowering detected across the sampled flora.
By contrast, four clades have undergone shifts in flowering pattern contrary to predictions (Table 1, additional
file 2: AF2.pdf); these consist of one (AF1.pdf, Trees 5 &
10) and two (AF1.pdf, Tree 14) shifts in flowering duration per Cape clade, and one shift in the timing of flowering per Cape clade (AF1.pdf, Trees 5, 10 & 12),
making a total of four shifts in flowering duration and
three shifts in the timing of flowering contrary to predictions detected across the flora.
In terms of distribution, 12 clades show predicted
shifts from the west towards the east (intra-Cape shifts
out of the west, into the east, or a combination of the
two; Figure 2, Table 1); these consisted of one (AF1.pdf,
Trees 2, 10 & 13), two (Figure 2; AF1.pdf, Trees 1, 3,
7, 8, 9 & 12), three (AF1.pdf, Tree 5) and seven (AF1.pdf,
Tree 14) shifts out of the west and/or into the east per
Cape clade, making a total of 26 shifts in distribution

detected across the sampled flora. By contrast, four
clades show distributional shifts from the east towards
the west, contrary to predictions (intra-Cape shifts out of
the east, into the west, or a combination of the two;
Table 1, AF2.pdf); in all cases these consisted of just one
(AF1.pdf, Trees 2, 5, 10 & 11) shift out of the west or
into the east per Cape clade, making a total of four shifts
in distribution contrary to predictions detected across
the flora.
Thus, of the 18 clades sampled in our study, almost as
many clades show shifts in flowering phenology consistent with adaptation to climate change (9 clades) as
show changes in distribution (12 clades). Seven clades
showed shifts in both phenology and distribution consistent with predictions. A smaller number of clades show
shifts in flowering phenology and distribution contrary
to adaptation to climate change (4 clades in each case,
of which two show both reverse patterns).
We also counted the number of Cape species in clades
that speciated following phenological and distributional
shifts, in order to determine the scale of contribution of
such lineages to the extant flora. When species numbers
in our sample are considered, and errors caused by
unsampled species and uncertainty in the exact node of
character state transition are allowed for, 14-55% of species belong to lineages that have experienced a shift in
phenology consistent with an adaptation to climate
change. By comparison, our reconstructions indicate
that 14-41% of species have arisen from ancestors that
showed a distributional shift consistent with climate
change.

Discussion
The reproductive output of plants depends on the finetuning of flowering to fit abiotic and biotic conditions
[57,58]. Thus flowering phenology has strong fitness
consequences, and flowering time is one factor determining a species’ niche [59]. Like other characters specifying a species’ niche, physiological or morphological,
flowering phenology may be conserved, plastic or
undergo evolutionary change [57,59].
It is well established that many plant populations can
and have changed their flowering time in the last century. Shifts in flowering phenology provide some of the
most compelling evidence that species are being influenced by contemporary global environmental change
[60-62]. These tracking responses, perceived as adaptations to changing environmental conditions, may be
environmentally induced plastic responses or evolutionary adaptations. Although genetic data is not available
for most of the species showing phenological responses
to climate change [17], there are several studies which
have demonstrated that responses can be heritable.
These include examples of crop plants responding to

environmental changes in situ and invasive plants or
domesticates encountering new climate regimes as they
expand their distribution [63-67]. Differential tracking of
contemporary climate change has been shown to be a
determinant of the species composition of a community,
since populations of species lacking a plastic or microevolutionary response are locally extirpated [68,69].
These findings raise questions about the significance of
phenological adaptation to past climate change, since
the extent to which differential tracking of past climate
has shaped a whole flora is at present unknown.
Our study has identified a footprint of past phenological change, set in motion over five million years ago, in
a contemporary flora. A point that remains clear regardless of the relative roles of evolutionary changes and
phenotypic plasticity is that the observed phenological
shifts have had a major role in shaping the extant Cape
angiosperm flora; lineages that underwent shifts in

flowering phenology later speciated extensively. Our
study also provides tentative evidence of differential
tracking of climate change, with phenological shifts
apparent in some clades but not others.
The comparable number of shifts - distributional and
phenological - experienced by the Cape flora as a new
climate regime was established is a noteworthy finding
of our study. Table 1 shows that phenological shifts are
apparent in some clades (Crotalarieae, Disa, Heliophila,
Moraea, Muraltia, Oxalis, Pentaschistis, Phylica and
Podalyrieae) but not others. We go beyond estimation
of the frequency of shifts to estimate the scale of the
contribution these shifts have made to the character of
the present-day flora. While our confidence intervals are
wide - 14-41% and 14-55% of species belonging to
lineages that have experienced distributional and phenological shifts consistent with past climate change,
respectively - these figures indicate that contrary to

For each Cape clade in question, ticks (✓) indicate one or more supported shifts in character state consistent with our past climatic change predictions. Unless
otherwise indicated, shifts in flowering midpoint are from the summer towards the spring, shifts in flowering duration are reductions in the number of months of
flowering, and shifts in distribution are out of the west and/or into the east. Where available, ranges of published date estimates for the shifts are listed, along
with the dating methods included in this range and reference to source publications.
✓b, clades in which some degree of later backward shifting is exhibited at the distal-most nodes. ✓1, in the Crotalarieae, the flowering midpoint is reconstructed
as shifting from summer to early spring deep within the Cape clade, followed by a much shallower shift to late spring and finally back to early spring. A
reduction in flowering duration is reconstructed both deep within the Cape clade, and towards the tips. 2, Pelargonium exhibits a shift from east to west at a
single distal-most node. 3, Oxalis exhibits a shift in reconstructed flowering midpoint from mid-May to the May-June boundary and/or to mid-June (i.e. from lateautumn slightly towards the winter). 4, the Cape Restionaceae exhibits a shift in reconstructed flowering duration from one to two months, and from one to five
months at a single distal-most node. In the only instance where such shifts do not involve very shallow nodes, a later shift back to one flowering month is
observed. 5, Depending on the nodes considered either side of those for which states are undetermined, Pentaschistis either exhibits a very slight shift in
flowering midpoint from summer towards the spring, or an equally slight shift from spring towards the summer.

certain schools of thought [18,20], adaptive changes
consistent with past climate change have had a significant impact on the Cape flora on the timescale considered (Early-Mid Miocene to the present). Such
adaptations may be close contenders to (often co-occurring)
distributional shifts in their frequency and contribution
to the modern flora. Our results, while suggestive of evolutionary changes, do not allow us to rule out a major
role for plasticity in the phenotypic adaptations that we
observe. Furthermore, flowering phenology is just one of
many important niche parameters of Cape plants, most
of which are presumably highly conserved, otherwise
there would not be large clades restricted to the Cape
(Cape clades), and the Cape Floristic Region as we know
it would not exist. Nonetheless, the patterns uncovered
demonstrate that both adaptive and distributional shifts
consistent with past climatic change have had strong
impacts on the assembly of this biodiversity hotspot,
since lineages that underwent these changes went on to
contribute a high proportion of its current species
richness.

While most of the observed shifts in distribution and
flowering patterns are consistent with predictions based
on past climate change, alternative explanations must be
considered. First, we consider the possibility that reconstructed shifts in flowering patterns result from changes
in distribution within the Cape, with a consequent phenological response to regions with differing climates,
rather than climatic change itself. This scenario can be
rejected because reconstructed shifts in flowering
pattern (long-duration summer flowering to shorterduration spring flowering) work in the opposite direction to predictions on the basis of reconstructed west to
east shifts in geography.
Second, we consider the possibility that reconstructed
shifts are an artefact of regional differences in species
diversity within the Cape; the west is known to harbour
higher species diversity than the east [14]. Were the
flowering duration or season of Cape species distributed
at random with respect to phylogeny, we might expect
the predominant flowering states observed in the west
(short-duration spring flowering) to be more frequently

Warren et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/39

reconstructed at the base of Cape clades than those
observed in the east (longer-duration summer flowering), purely as a result of them being the most frequent
in the dataset. This second scenario can be rejected,
since observed shifts in flowering phenology run in the
opposite direction to those predicted as a result of the
proposed diversity difference artefact.
Third, we consider the possibility that the patterns we
observe have arisen by chance. Our character randomizations of flowering midpoint across trees showing the
basal-most (Podalyrieae) and distal-most (Disa) shifts in
flowering midpoint showed that the probability of patterns consistent with past climatic change occurring by
chance are P = 0.00 and P = 0.1 respectively. If we take
the higher of these two probabilities as representative of
the maximal probability of shifts consistent with past
climatic change occurring by chance in any particular
Cape clade, and consider the five out of 18 Cape clades
for which shifts consistent with past climatic change
arose in the real data, we can reject the hypothesis that
the observed shifts occurred by chance (P = 0.0218).
It is appealing to link environmental changes and
shifts in phylogenies through estimations of the timescales on which they occurred. In the case of the seasonal aridification trend in the Cape flora, problems with
such an approach arise. The most significant of these is
the absence of data concerning the precise timing, frequency and nature of the aridification trends; much
more palaeobotanical and geological evidence is needed
if we are to narrow down their timing reliably within
the broad bounds of the Neogene. Notwithstanding this
caveat, in all sampled Cape floral clades for which date
estimates are available, confidence intervals for the timing of distributional and phenological shifts strongly
overlap with temporal bounds of the aridification event
(Table 1).
Since our phylogenies only sample living species, we
are unable to speculate on any responses of non-surviving lineages of the early flora prior to their extinction.
Clearly however, our conclusions regarding the type of
response of lineages that survived past climatic change
are unaffected by the type of response (or lack of
response) of lineages that became extinct. Further to
complete extinction, two patterns of local (regional)
extinction may be envisaged. The first is extinction
within the CFR with the lineage surviving as a “nonCape relative” outside the CFR; we refer to this as ‘Cape
departure’. The second is relatively rapid back-and-forth
shifting of distribution, leaving no significant distributional change between start and finish; we refer to this
as ‘back-and-forth shifting’.
Cape departure seems unlikely to present a major distortion of the broad-scale pattern presented here; such
cases are infrequent judging by the small number of

Page 7 of 11

complete departures from the CFR occurring within the
monophyletic (or nearly so) groups of Cape species
(‘Cape floral clades’). Therefore compared with most
continental floras, the CFR can be viewed as being close
to a closed system. Under the back-and-forth shifting
scenario, a lineage’s temporary absence accompanied by
a shift in phenology and reinvasion of the CFR could
have been misinterpreted as in situ phenological change.
However, we have to invoke local extinction in the Cape
at the time that the lineage colonized the neighbouring
region, followed by local extinction in that neighbouring
region as the lineage re-colonized the Cape. While this
is not impossible it should first be noted that virtually
any interpretation of a phylogeny can be refuted if
enough extinction events in the right place are hypothesised. The more extinction events that are needed, and
the more specific the placement of the extinct species
required, the less strong such counter-arguments may
seem. Here we require a minimum of two for each Cape
clade inferred to undergo a phenological shift, making
18 local extinction events in total. More importantly,
this scenario still involves phenological shifts. The only
difference is that the phenological shifts occur while the
lineages are outside the Cape, rather than being in situ.
This would be an important detail to note were evidence found in favour. However, our main conclusion that a large proportion of Cape clades have undergone
phenological shifts during a period of past climatic
change - would remain unchanged.
The cases of phenological shifts that we document
provide a highly conservative estimate of the likely frequency of niche shifts in the Cape flora overall; we
investigated shifts in timing and duration of flowering
only, and there are many other pathways by which
plants may have survived summer aridification events.
These include the evolution of an annual life form, and
changes in leaf longevity, sclerophylly, leaf size, root
depth and root storage, all of which are interpreted by
plant physiologists as mechanisms of drought resistance
[70-74]. Improvements in a species’ capability to survive
a higher incidence of fire [14] through resprouting or
reseeding may also have been important. While many of
these species traits might be ideal for testing for adaptation to aridification between closely related species, few
if any of them are likely to have been as important
responses across the taxonomic breadth of the Cape
flora as is flowering phenology.

Conclusions
Adaptive changes in ecology at this scale and consistent
with past climate change have not been documented for
other floras. For example, palynological studies, most
complete for the Northern hemisphere, suggest that
many plant species underwent major distributional shifts

Warren et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/39

in response to Late Quaternary climatic fluctuations but
appear to have remained unchanged in phenotype
[18,20]. The same applies to beetles [19]. Clearly however, such studies compare the external morphology of
living and fossil forms; on this basis, nothing can be
inferred about the stability or otherwise of characteristics such as phenology over this timescale.
Despite concordance with conclusions based on the
Quaternary fossil record (short timescales of 103 to 104
years), the phenomenon of niche conservatism initially
came as a surprise and paradigm shift to those familiar
with strong patterns of adaptive change in response to
biotic and abiotic changes over long timescales in the
fossil record (104-109 years, e.g. [75]). Nonetheless, this
paradigm and associated distributional shifts gain support from several lines of inference, including the success of ecological niche models in predicting
geographical distributions, most notably in reciprocal
comparisons between the Last Glacial Maximum (based
on fossils) and the present [21,22]. Such studies have
provided a picture of species’ geographic distributions
tracking particular climatic regimes closely [76]. Ecological niche models involving climate have also shown
strength in predicting the geography of species invasions
in different geographical settings [77], and in predicting
distributions of sister species separated by several million years of independent evolution [8]. Finally, a wealth
of population genetic studies have supported the conclusion that species underwent distributional shifts in
response to past climate change [78,79].
In terms of adaptive responses, numerous ecological
studies provide evidence for intraspecific adaptation to
current and past (Late Quaternary) climate change at
specific sites, predominantly in the northern hemisphere
[64,78-80]. The absence of occurrence of novel phenotypes across a whole species or evolutionarily significant
unit through periods of past climate change [15], as
inferred from the Quaternary fossil record, has recently
been questioned from palaeoecological perspectives [81].
However it has remained unchallenged by phylogenetic
studies. Given the high frequency of Cape lineages that
underwent phenological responses consistent with past
seasonal aridification, and the difficulty of recovering
such shifts from the fossil record, it is conceivable that
such shifts in niche through periods of past climate
change have been more prevalent than is currently
appreciated. Further, the importance of shifts in ecology
[15], in addition to range shifts [18], in the Cape flora’s
response to past climatic changes may have been underestimated. In addition to the limitations of the fossil
record in preserving ecological shifts, such shifts may be
more easily detected at the species level over the course
of longer timescales (104-109 years, for which fossil data
is not available in all biomes) than shorter ones

Page 8 of 11

(10 3 years). Considering the ongoing accumulation of
molecular phylogenetic data worldwide, we hope that our
findings will stimulate comparable investigations across
other biomes for which the timing and nature of past climatic changes have been more precisely documented.

Methods
Species sampling

Phylogenies of 18 floral clades largely or exclusively
restricted to the Cape were compiled from existing publications [36-50]. These clades vary in the number of
Cape species they include, from 20 to an estimated 378
species, cumulatively totalling 20% of the flora’s species
diversity. Cape clades were identified following Linder’s
[14] criteria. Sampling of Cape species within these
clades varied from 100% to 10% per phylogeny. Tree
topologies used for analysis were either one of the most
parsimonious trees, or the Bayesian tree gaining highest
posterior probability, with the exception of five Cape
clades for which only a consensus tree was available
from the source publication.
Character scoring

Flowering duration and the midpoint of flowering season were treated as separate characters and scored for
each species based on Goldblatt & Manning’s [25] data
on flowering period in months. Flowering duration was
scored with 12 states corresponding to number of
months, and midpoint of flowering was scored with 24
states corresponding to mid-points that fall either midmonth or at the transition between two months. Three
species had a split flowering season unlikely to result
from a paucity of records, and their flowering durations
and midpoints were consequently scored as missing
data. Distributional data were available in the form of
presence or absence in each of six phytogeographic centres that Goldblatt & Manning [25] used to subdivide
the Cape. Given the proximity between the boundaries
of these centres and the division of Johnson’s [35] two
rainfall regions, we scored species as present or absent
from Goldblatt & Manning’s [25] western (NW, SW)
and eastern (KM, LB, AP, SE) phytogeographic centres,
corresponding to Johnson’s [35] winter rainfall and nonseasonal rainfall regimes respectively.
Reconstruction of ancestral states and state shifts

Ancestral states were reconstructed using a single-rate
maximum likelihood (ML) model implemented in Mesquite version 1.11 [82]. The advantage of this approach
is that it permits an estimate of the uncertainty in state
reconstruction [83]. A minimum of two log-likelihood
units separating a single state of highest likelihood from
alternative states was used as a threshold for determining the state optimisation of each internal node.

Warren et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:39
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/39

Optimisations at nodes for which this threshold is not
reached, or for which two log-likelihood units separate
more than one state of high likelihood from others, were
considered undetermined. Where nodes optimised as different states are separated by nodes in which the ancestral
state is undetermined, we quote species diversities under
the two extremes (deepest and shallowest) of potential
location of the state shift. Likewise, we quote species diversities of clades under the two extremes of placement of
unsampled species. To calculate the probability of shifts
consistent with past climatic change occurring by chance,
we carried out randomizations in which we permuted the
observed taxa among the terminal nodes in any given tree
using the Reshuffle Terminal Taxa option in the TreeFarm
package of Mesquite. Fifty randomizations of flowering
midpoints were conducted across two Cape clades selected
to represent trees with the basal-most and distal-most placement of flowering midpoint shifts. The resulting 100
trees were manually examined for shifts consistent with
past climatic change, following the same criteria that were
used in the observed data.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Molecular phylogenetic trees with reconstructed
shifts in geographic distribution and flowering patterns (flowering
durations and flowering midpoint) indicated. Unless otherwise
indicated, shifts in flowering patterns are in the direction consistent with
past climatic change; shifts in flowering midpoint are from the summer
towards the spring, and shifts in flowering duration are reductions in the
number of months of flowering. Where nodes optimised at different
states are separated by nodes in which the ancestral state is
undetermined, we have marked on the basal-most possible location of
the shift.
Additional file 2: Table illustrating the degree of shift in flowering
phenology in the eighteen Cape clades sampled. Mid-month
flowering midpoint character states are indicated by an abbreviation for
the month in question, while character states at the boundary between
two months are indicated by those two month abbreviations separated
by a hyphen. Flowering durations are in months. Shifts from the base of
the tree towards the tips are indicated as “>“. Note that all possible
series in the degrees of shift of flowering midpoint and duration are
listed. Many nodes optimised at different states are separated by nodes
for which the ancestral state is undetermined. Therefore, how many
shifts are counted depends on the criteria used to count them. In order
to be conservative in our counting, we have counted shifts in the text, in
Table 1 and in additional file AF1.pdf based on the basal-most possible
location of each shift. As a result of these criteria and tree shape, there
are many more possible series in the degrees of shifts marked here than
there are basal-most possible positions of shifts in the text, Table 1 and
file AF1.pdf.
