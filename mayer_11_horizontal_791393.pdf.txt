Horizontal gene transfer of microbial cellulases
into nematode genomes is associated with
functional assimilation and gene turnover

Abstract
Background: Natural acquisition of novel genes from other organisms by horizontal or lateral gene transfer is well
established for microorganisms. There is now growing evidence that horizontal gene transfer also plays important
roles in the evolution of eukaryotes. Genome-sequencing and EST projects of plant and animal associated
nematodes such as Brugia, Meloidogyne, Bursaphelenchus and Pristionchus indicate horizontal gene transfer as a key
adaptation towards parasitism and pathogenicity. However, little is known about the functional activity and
evolutionary longevity of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer and the mechanisms favoring such processes.
Results: We examine the transfer of cellulase genes to the free-living and beetle-associated nematode Pristionchus
pacificus, for which detailed phylogenetic knowledge is available, to address predictions by evolutionary theory for
successful gene transfer. We used transcriptomics in seven Pristionchus species and three other related diplogastrid
nematodes with a well-defined phylogenetic framework to study the evolution of ancestral cellulase genes
acquired by horizontal gene transfer. We performed intra-species, inter-species and inter-genic analysis by
comparing the transcriptomes of these ten species and tested for cellulase activity in each species. Species with
cellulase genes in their transcriptome always exhibited cellulase activity indicating functional integration into the
host’s genome and biology. The phylogenetic profile of cellulase genes was congruent with the species phylogeny
demonstrating gene longevity. Cellulase genes show notable turnover with elevated birth and death rates.
Comparison by sequencing of three selected cellulase genes in 24 natural isolates of Pristionchus pacificus suggests
these high evolutionary dynamics to be associated with copy number variations and positive selection.
Conclusion: We could demonstrate functional integration of acquired cellulase genes into the nematode’s biology
as predicted by theory. Thus, functional assimilation, remarkable gene turnover and selection might represent key
features of horizontal gene transfer events in nematodes.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the movement of genes
from one organism to another by mechanisms other
than direct descent, is widespread in prokaryotes, but is
thought to be rare among eukaryotes with sexual reproduction [1,2]. However, recent genome and expressed
sequence tag (EST) projects in nematodes provide
strong evidence for HGT from bacteria, fungi, amoebozoa or from endosymbionts in the plant parasites

plant-parasitic nematodes of the Bursaphelenchus group,
the necromenic nematode Pristionchus pacificus and the
filarial nematode Brugia malayi [3-7]. In particular, cell
wall degrading enzymes of glycosyl hydrolase families
(endo-1,4-beta-glucanases; cellulases), pectate lyases and
xylanases were acquired by several of these nematodes.
Cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4) can be found in 14 different glycosyl hydrolase families, of which only GHF5 and
GHF45 were found in nematodes so far [8].
Surprisingly, phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that
cellulase genes have been acquired multiple times independently in nematodes from distinct microbial donors

such as Meloidogyne, Heterodera and Globodera) and
migratory parasitic species (Pratylenchus penetrans) are
from glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GHF5). They appear
to have acquired a whole ancestral GHF5 gene cassette
consisting of the catalytic domain and the carbohydratebinding module 2 (CBM2) [10]. The intronless ancestral
gene from putative bacterial donors later gained introns
followed by intron shifts or losses in single gene copies.
The pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus,
which is part of the same clade as the cyst/root-knot
nematodes above, but from a distinct grouping,
acquired a different family of cellulases (GHF45) from
fungi [3]. Genes obtained by HGT that are central to
parasitic interaction, like pectin lyase or cellulase genes
have undergone expansion by gene duplication after
HGT in Meloidogyne hapla, M. incognita or P. pacificus
[5-7,10].
Evolutionary theory makes a number of predictions
for the successful acquisition of genes by HGT. Specifically, evolutionary theory predicts that the successful
integration of HGT-acquired genes into the biology of
the host requires gene activity and longevity [11], resulting in a number of testable, but yet unanswered questions, i.e. are genes acquired by HGT functional? How
stable are these genes over evolutionary time scales and
do they undergo normal or unusual turnover rates?
Finally, are such genes under positive selection?
To study the evolutionary history, activity and longevity of genes acquired by HGT requires a well-established
phylogenetic framework at the species and family level
and a number of natural isolates for intra-species comparisons. Nematodes of the beetle-associated genus Pristionchus fulfill these requirements as more than 160
strains of worldwide origin are available for the model
species P. pacificus and 25 species of the Pristionchus
genus have been phylogenetically characterized [12,13].
Furthermore, molecular analysis places the genus Pristionchus well within the Diplogastridae family [14-16].
Building on this phylogenetic framework, we used, first,
transcriptomics of seven Pristionchus species and three
additional diplogastrid species to study the evolution of
cellulase genes and, second, compared individual genes
in 24 natural isolates of P. pacificus.
Here we show that species with cellulase genes in
their transcriptome always exhibited cellulase activity.
Cellulase genes show high turnover with significant
birth and death rates. The comparison of 24 natural isolates of P. pacificus strains from around the world suggests these high evolutionary dynamics to be associated
with copy number variations and positive selection. We
conclude that functional assimilation, high gene turnover and selection might represent key features of HGT
events in nematodes.

Results
Cellulase genes in diplogastrid transcriptomes

EST libraries of P. pacificus, six additional Pristionchus
species, and three other diplogastrids (Acrostichus sp.
RS5083, Diplogasteroides magnus RS5445 and Koerneria
sudhausi SB413) were sequenced using the Roche 454sequence technology platform (Figure 1A, see Materials
and Methods for details) [17]. The datasets contained
16,000 to 28,000 assembled EST contigs and 42,000 to
148,000 singletons, each. Expressed gene contigs encompassing the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) present at the C terminus of cellulases, were identified in
all seven Pristionchus species and a near full-length cellulase transcript was found in Koerneria sudhausi
(Figure 1A) [18]. In contrast, cellulase/CBM transcripts
were not found in D. magnus and Acrostichus sp.
RS5083 (Figure 1A). The CBM of the Pristionchus
nematodes belonged to the CBM49 (pfam09478) family
[19] and differed from that of plant-parasitic nematodes,
which have similarity to the bacterial carbohydratebinding module of family 2 (CBM2; pfam00553) [18].
The CBM49 domains of different Pristionchus species
were all highly similar to each other (Figure 1B; additional file 1). In contrast, in the K. sudhausi cellulase a
CBM domain could not be detected and the cellulase
transcripts did not show sufficient sequence similarity to
the Pristionchus cellulases to be included in the same
multiple sequence alignments.
BLASTX searches of GenBank, Wormbase and UniRef90 databases with Pristionchus and Koerneria cellulase transcript sequences encompassing the full-length
cellulase domain identified them as members of the glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GHF5; pfam00150) (Figure 2)
[6,20,21]. Different sets of closest matching sequences
were found. The Pristionchus cellulase genes Ppa-cel-2,
Ppa-cel-3 and Ppa-cel-1, the latter not detected in the
sequenced transcriptome, were most closely related to a
paralogous set of duplicated genes of the slime molds
Dictyostelium discoideum and Polysphondylium pallidum (score: 264 bits, E-value: 4e-68), whereas K. sudhausi genes revealed high similarity to cellulase genes of
the plant-parasitic nematode Aphelenchus avenae (score:
306 bits, E-value: 1e-81; Figure 2). These results of the
similarity searches could be affected by skewed or insufficient sampling because matching homologues from
related organisms are not yet in the databases, as has
been argued by Mitreva et al. (2009) for GHF5 cellulase
genes in plant-parasitic nematodes [22]. This explanation could hold for the Koerneria GHF5 cellulase gene,
which appears to be in a monophyletic clade with plantparasitic nematodes of the phylogenetic clade 12 [16].
However, the clade 9 nematode Koerneria is the
only nematode in this clade - which encompasses

Diplogastridae (Pristionchus and others) and Rhabditidae
(Caenorhabditis and others) - to possess this GHF5 subclass, and no genes similar to GHF5 cellulases were
detected in available EST datasets at GenBank from
non-plant parasitic nematode clades or other species at
intermediate phylogenetic positions (e. g., Rhabditida,
748,443 ESTs; Ascarida, 63,743 ESTs; Spirurida, 59,125
ESTs; Trichocephalida, 52,763 ESTs; Dorylaimida, 9,351
ESTs; Araelaimida, 2,591 ESTs).
In contrast, the Pristionchus cellulases belong to a
GHF5 subclass that is distinct from those in plantparasitic nematodes. Tracing the GHF5 genes of clade 9
and clade 12 nematodes and amoebozoans back to a
common ancestor would require maintenance and
sequence conservation of gene copies in genomes over
extended evolutionary timescales and massive parallel
losses of genes in most investigated nematodes and
other phylogenetically related lineages of organisms during evolution. Hence, two independent HGT events, one
from an amoebozoan or related microorganism to an
ancestral Pristionchus species and a second from an
unknown donor to Koerneria and Aphelenchus, appear
to be the most likely scenario.
Correlation of cellulase genes and cellulase activity

These 10 species were used in Roche 454 sequencing. The tree was
reconstructed from 4,043 bp of concatenated ribosomal protein
genes by heuristic search using the maximum likelihood criterion in
the PAUP*4.0b10 software as described in Mayer et al. (2009) [11,12].
Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values. The presence of
cellulase transcripts and observed cellulase activity in worm
supernatants is indicated. The tree was rooted by Koerneria sudhausi.

Roche 454 transcriptomes encoding CBM49 domains of cellulases

been selected by Modeltest 3.7 (Posada) corresponding to equal
base frequencies, Nst = 6, substitution rates of A-C = 1, A-G =
1.1039, A-T = 1, C-G = 1, C-T = 1.7501, G-T = 1.0000; proportion of
invariable sites I = 0; gamma distribution shape parameter a =
0.9033. Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values of 1,000
replications.

Is the presence of cellulase genes in the EST sequence
data correlated with cellulase activity? We tested the
supernatant of mixed stage cultures of all ten species
in a Congo red-polysaccharide interaction assay and
found complete correlation with the transcriptome
data [3,23]. All eight tested Pristionchus and Koerneria
species that contain cellulase genes in their EST
libraries had detectable cellulase activity in the assay
(Figure 1A; Figure 3). In contrast, D. magnus and
Acrostichus sp. RS5083 did neither show cellulase
activity nor could we detect expression of cellulase
genes in their transcriptomes (Figure 1A; Figure 3).
Thus, species with cellulase genes in their transcriptome always exhibited cellulase activity, suggesting that
functional assimilation of HGT acquired genes represents an important force during HGT events.
Evolutionary dynamics of Pristionchus cellulase genes

To study the evolutionary dynamics and turnover rates
of cellulase genes, we reconstructed the phylogenetic
relationship of the 12 Pristionchus ESTs encoding
CBM49 domains by the maximum likelihood criterion
using the alignment shown in additional file 1.The
resulting phylogram revealed two important findings
(Figure 1B). First, the cellulase CBM49 gene phylogeny

cellulase activity assays were performed on carboxymethylcellulose
agar plates [3,23]. Clear halos were detected in the supernatants of
P. uniformis, P. entomophagus, P. aerivorus, P. pseudaerivorus, P. sp.

is highly congruent to the species phylogeny of Pristionchus (Figure 1A,B) [13]. This result indicates an
ancestral acquisition of cellulase genes followed by
maintenance of the gene through several speciation
events and subsequent divergence by point mutations
during the evolution of species. The only discrepancy is
presented by the P. uniformis Contig22434.1, which
appears to be a cellulase gene that was maintained only
in P. uniformis but was lost in other Pristionchus species. Homologous genes in the P. pacificus genome with
highest similarity to P. uniformis Contig22434.1 are
Ppa-cel-2 and Ppa-cel-3. Second, the cellulase genes
evolve dynamically by gene duplications as indicated by
species-specific duplicates in P. pacificus, P. sp. 11 and
P. sp. 15, respectively. In addition to lineage-specific
gene duplications, putative gene deletions have occurred
as exemplified by an ancestral CBM49 domain that is
detectable in only one extant species, P. uniformis.
These results suggest conspicuous evolutionary
dynamics of cellulase genes in the genus Pristionchus
with high gene birth and death rates.
Copy number variation among populations is well
known from human evolution [24]. We wanted to know
if the evolutionary dynamics of genes acquired by HGT
also results in patterns of copy number variations. We
selected three paralogous cellulase genes from the P.
pacificus genome and compared them in 24 natural isolates of worldwide origin (Table 1). Two of the genes
(Ppa-cel-2 and Ppa-cel-3) are expressed in the transcriptome and are detectable by mass spectroscopy in the
proteome [6,25]. For comparison, the third gene (Ppacel-1) has been selected because it could be found as a
complete copy in the genome and its transcription has
been demonstrated, but at too low levels to be found in
the transcriptome and proteome analyses [6,25]. The
analyzed parts of the genes Ppa-cel-1, Ppa-cel-2 and
Ppa-cel-3 encompass 3.0, 2.6 and 2.8 kb, respectively,
with a total of 3.9 kb of exonic sequence (Table 2).
While Ppa-cel-1 and Ppa-cel-2 were obtained from all
24 natural isolates, Ppa-cel-3 could only be detected in
16 out of the 24 P. pacificus strains (Table 1). The variability of Ppa-cel-3 among the strains is low, with ≤ 0.4%
nucleotide differences in pair-wise comparisons of the
whole gene and ≤ 0.3% nucleotide differences in exons.
At the same time, this gene is highly similar to Ppa-cel2 in transcript sequence and to a large part in intronic
sequences with most of the splice sites being conserved
between them. These results suggest that the Ppa-cel-3
arose by recent gene duplication from Ppa-cel-2 within
the species P. pacificus. The time since its birth was too
short for substantial sequence diversification and the
gene itself has not yet spread through the whole population. Thus, the comparison of Pristionchus species and
P. pacificus strains provides strong evidence for notable

evolutionary turnover of cellulase genes by gene duplications and putative deletions.

result in a ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) to synonymous
(Ks) substitutions higher than one at individual codons.
We calculated the Ka/Ks ratio at each site of the cellulase proteins Ppa-CEL-1, Ppa-CEL-2 and Ppa-CEL-3
with the help of the Selecton server by using an empirical Bayesian method [27]. Sites with a Ka/Ks ratio ≥1 in
Ppa-CEL-2 were identified. A likelihood ratio test was
performed between the two models, M8 and M8a,
implemented on this platform. M8 considers sites under
purifying selection vs. a category of sites experiencing
positive or neutral selection (ωs ≥1) [28]. M8a, which is
nested in the M8 model, is restricted to purifying and
neutral selection only (ωs = 1) [29]. The test showed a
significance level of 0.001 in support for the M8 model,
which allows site-specific positive selection (Table 2).
In contrast, Ppa-CEL-1 and Ppa-CEL-3 did not show
any evidence for positive selection, arguing that the evolutionary forces act on individual genes with high specificity. This is also observable when comparing the
degree of polymorphisms among the three genes. The
highly expressed Ppa-cel-2 gene displayed up to 2.1%
nucleotide differences in pair-wise comparisons of the
whole gene and 1.5% in exons. In contrast, the variation
in Ppa-cel-1 was considerably higher with up to 5.7%
and 6.0% nucleotide differences in the whole gene and
exons, respectively. We speculate that neutral processes
underlie this variability in Ppa-cel-1, but not in Ppacel-2. Taken together, the comparison of three cellulase
genes in 24 natural isolates of P. pacificus indicates that
different evolutionary forces act on these genes and provides evidence for positive selection acting on Ppa-cel-2.
Evidence for intron gain after HGT

Evidence for positive selection of Ppa-cel-2

In addition to copy number variations, the evolutionary
diversification of genes should result in intra-specific
polymorphisms, which are either the result of nonadaptive or selective processes [26]. The P. pacificus collection of wild isolates of worldwide origin enables the
inference of site-specific positive Darwinian and purifying selection. Site-specific positive Darwinian should

After a gene has been acquired by HGT it will assimilate
to the new genomic environment, which may lead to
changes in the size and number of spliceosomal introns
[30]. Consistent with this, we found that the putative
donor cellulase genes in the slime molds D. discoideum
and P. pallidum contain only one or two small introns
of 71 to 275 bp, whereas the P. pacificus cellulase genes
Ppa-cel-1, Ppa-cel-2, and Ppa-cel-3 possess 13 to 16

introns, ranging from 14 to 452 bp (Table 2). This
includes several extremely small introns of a length
below 50 bp, which are typical for P. pacificus and other
nematodes [6]. Assuming that the slime mold genes
represent the ancestral state, these cellulase genes have
gained up to 15 small spliceosomal introns. However,
we want to note that in theory, it is also possible that
slime molds might have lost ancestral introns.

Discussion
We have shown that the diplogastrid nematode genera
Koerneria and Pristionchus independently acquired cellulase genes by HGT from different putative donors. A
detailed functional and genomic investigation in the
phylogenetic framework of Pristionchus reveals that all
features of evolutionary significance are fulfilled, including functional activity, longevity and the action of positive selection. Longevity of the transferred genes is
indicated by their divergence from the donor through
accumulated mutations. In addition, the resulting cellulase CBM49 phylogeny following HGT into Pristionchus
is congruent to the host taxon phylogeny, i.e. the
phylogenetic pattern of the transferred genes is largely
identical to the phylogeny of the genus Pristionchus
(Figure 1A,B). Thus, the original insertion of the cellulase gene occurred in an ancestral taxon and has been
maintained over evolutionary time scales. During these
processes, the cellulase gene became functionally integrated into the nematode’s biology. Five notions support
this. First, the cellulase genes are transcribed. Second,
peptides corresponding to transcripts were identified by
mass spectrometry [25]. Third, the nematodes secrete
cellulases whose enzymatic activity can be demonstrated
in functional assays with supernatant of mixed stage cultures. In nature, microorganismal and plant cellulose are
potential targets for nematode cellulase activity, providing new potential food sources and fitness advantages
for the nematode. Fourth, the cellulase genes gained
introns in the host species, which are in phase with the
functional open reading frame. The finding that the original open reading frames have not been disrupted by
intron gain provides additional evidence for the functional assimilation of the acquired genes and for a selective advantage of active cellulase proteins in P. pacificus.
Fifth, the cellulase genes display high intra-genus and
intra-species turnover dynamics by birth-and-death processes, accompanied by selection for certain functional
genes. In conclusion, we demonstrated the functional
integration of acquired cellulase genes into the nematode’s biology as predicted by theory. Functional assimilation, remarkable gene turnover and selection might
represent key features of horizontal gene transfer events
in nematodes. We speculate that HGT represents a
major source for evolutionary innovation in nematodes

Page 7 of 10

and might have helped nematodes to invade the diversity of ecosystems, in which they can be found today,
such as parasites of plants, animals, including humans.

Conclusions
Predictions for successful horizontal gene transfer by
evolutionary theory include, in particular, integration of
the genes into the host’s genome, functional activity,
evolutionary longevity and positive selection of the
genes. Supported by a robust phylogenetic framework
we examined here these predictions for cellulase genes
in seven species of the diplogastrid nematode Pristionchus and three other related diplogastrid genera.
The following conclusions can be drawn. First, species
with cellulase genes in their transcriptome always
showed enzymatic cellulase activity demonstrating functional integration into the biology of the nematode. Second, different cellulase genes were acquired
independently by the diplogastrid nematodes Koerneria
and Pristionchus. Third, the considerable congruence of
the phylogenetic profile of cellulase genes within the
genus Pristionchus with the phylogeny of the species
indicates an ancestral gene integration event into the
genome and gene longevity. Forth, sequence comparisons of three selected cellulase genes in 24 natural isolates of the species Pristionchus pacificus show notable
evolutionary dynamics with elevated birth and death
rates, associated with copy number variations and putative positive selection for one of the cellulase genes.
Thus, functional integration of acquired cellulase genes
into the nematode’s biology, as predicted by theory,
could be demonstrated.
Methods
Expressed sequence tag (EST) library preparation and
sequencing

Mixed stage cultures of inbred nematode strains derived
from isogenic female lines were collected and washed
with phosphate-buffered saline. The strains were:
Pristionchus pacificus PS312; P. aerivorus RS5106;
P. pseudaerivorus RS5139; P. entomophagus RS0144;
P. uniformis RS0141; P. sp. 11 RS5228; P. sp. 15 RS5229;
Diplogasteroides magnus RS5445; Acrostichus sp.
RS5083; and Koerneria sudhausi SB413. Total RNA was
prepared by the Triazol method (Invitrogen). Normalized cDNA libraries from the polyadenylated RNA fraction from nine of the mixed stage nematodes were
constructed at the GSC at Washington University by
standard procedures and sequenced on the Roche 454
FLX platform producing 320,000 to 540,000 reads. Median read length was ~ 250 bp for all libraries. The K.

EST version of PCAP.REP [31] to EST contigs and
annotated by similarity searches using BLASTX against
the non-redundant protein databases Uniref90 and GenBank. The complete ten species EST library dataset will
be published elsewhere. Carbohydrate-binding modules
(CBM) and cellulase families were identified and classified with the help of the NCBI conserved domain database (CDD) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/cdd)
and the Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy)
server [8,32,33]. All cellulase genes identified in Pristionchus and Koerneria are available at Pristionchus.org
under http://www.pristionchus.org/suppPlosMayer.html
Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree
reconstruction

Cellulase nucleotide sequences were aligned by Clustalx
[34,35] and adjusted manually with the help of the
Seqpup (v0.6f) software [36]. For phylogenetic tree
reconstruction the optimal substitution model was
selected by the Modeltest 3.7 software using the Akaike
information criterion [37,38]. A phylogenetic tree was
then obtained by the neighbour-joining algorithm with
the help of the PAUP*4.0b10 software [39]. The distance
measure was set to ML with likelihood settings corresponding to the model as determined by Modeltest.
Trees were visualized using FigTree v.1.3.1 [40].
To find the closest homologs to the diplogastrid cellulase EST contigs the 100 best protein matches were
identified by a similarity search in the non-redundant
protein database (2010-05-18) at GenBank and retrieved
using BLAST Explorer [41]. The dataset was pruned by
removal of highly similar paralogous or allelic protein
sequences. The minimum score of the sequences kept in
the final dataset was 140 bits with an E-value of 9e-31
for Pristionchus cellulase EST contigs, and a score of
156 bits, E-value of 1e-36 for the Koerneria sudhausi
EST contig. Phylogenetic analysis of the dataset was performed by the workflow of the Phylogeny.fr platform
[42] comprising sequence alignment by the MUSCLE
software (v3.7) [43], removal of ambiguous regions by
Gblocks (v0.91b) [44] using the following parameters:
minimum length of a block after gap cleaning: 10; no
gap positions allowed in the final alignment; all segments with contiguous nonconserved positions bigger
than 8 were rejected; minimum number of sequences
for a flank position: 85%. The phylogenetic tree was
reconstructed from the protein sequences using the
maximum likelihood method implemented in the
PhyML program (v3.0 aLRT) on the same platform
[42,45]. WAG was used as substitution model with 4
substitution rate categories, number of invariant sites

Page 8 of 10

and gamma distribution parameter were estimated. The
gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the
data (gamma = 1.119). Reliability of internal branches
was assessed using the aLRT test (SH-Like) [46].
Amplification of Pristionchus pacificus cellulase genes by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Cellulase genes from genomic DNA from 24 P. pacificus
strains were amplified in four or five overlapping amplicons by PCR. The reactions were performed in 20 μl of
1× PCR buffer (GE HealthCare, Germany) containing
0.2 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.5 μM
of each primer, 40 ng of genomic DNA, and 1 unit of
Taq DNA polymerase (GE HealthCare). The reactions
were started by initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min in
a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (PE
Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by
35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, primer
annealing at 55°C for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C for
2 min. A final incubation step at 72°C for 7 min concluded the reaction. The products were gel purified and
directly sequenced by the PCR primers (additional
file 2). The sequences were assembled using the SeqMan
Pro (v8.0.2) software in the Lasergene 8 package
(DNASTAR) and aligned to P. pacificus PS312 genomic
and cDNA with the help of Seqpup (v0.6f) to deduce
the positions of exons [6,36]. Protein sites under selection were identified in a codon-alignment of exon
sequences using the Selecton server at http://selecton.
tau.ac.il/ [27].
Cellulase Activity Assay

About 50,000 mixed stage worms per milliliter M9 medium were incubated on a shaking platform for 2 days at
20°C. The culture supernatants were sterile filtered and
40 μl were applied to holes in agar plates containing
0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt. After incubation for 24 h the plates were stained with 0.1% Congo
red for 15 min and destained with 1 M NaCl for
another 15 min. The assay was repeated at least 3 times
for each nematode strain.
