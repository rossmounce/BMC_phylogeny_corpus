Abstract
Background: Like humans, the living elephants are unusual among mammals in being sparsely covered
with hair. Relative to extant elephants, the extinct woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius, had a dense
hair cover and extremely long hair, which likely were adaptations to its subarctic habitat. The fibroblast
growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects hair length in a diverse set of mammalian species. Mutations in FGF5
lead to recessive long hair phenotypes in mice, dogs, and cats; and the gene has been implicated in hair
length variation in rabbits. Thus, FGF5 represents a leading candidate gene for the phenotypic differences
in hair length notable between extant elephants and the woolly mammoth. We therefore sequenced the
three exons (except for the 3' UTR) and a portion of the promoter of FGF5 from the living elephantid
species (Asian, African savanna and African forest elephants) and, using protocols for ancient DNA, from
a woolly mammoth.
Results: Between the extant elephants and the mammoth, two single base substitutions were observed
in FGF5, neither of which alters the amino acid sequence. Modeling of the protein structure suggests that
the elephantid proteins fold similarly to the human FGF5 protein. Bioinformatics analyses and DNA
sequencing of another locus that has been implicated in hair cover in humans, type I hair keratin
pseudogene (KRTHAP1), also yielded negative results. Interestingly, KRTHAP1 is a pseudogene in
elephantids as in humans (although fully functional in non-human primates).
Conclusion: The data suggest that the coding sequence of the FGF5 gene is not the critical determinant
of hair length differences among elephantids. The results are discussed in the context of hairlessness
among mammals and in terms of the potential impact of large body size, subarctic conditions, and an
aquatic ancestor on hair cover in the Proboscidea.

Background
Hair is a defining characteristic of mammals. The hair follicle is the only organ in mammals to undergo life-long
cycles of growth, regression and quiescence [1]. Hair
development proceeds through a cycle of anagen in which
hair follicles undergo rapid growth, catagen in which hair
growth ceases due to apoptosis-driven regression, and telogen in which the hair follicle enters a period of relative
quiescence [1]. Longer hair can thus result from an
increase in the length of time during which anagen proceeds. A loss-of-function mutation in the fibroblast
growth factor 5 gene (designated Fgf5 in mice and rats,
and FGF5 in other mammals) is responsible for the long
hair phenotype present in angora mice, while a similar
long hair phenotype occurs in mice homozygous for a
null allele of Fgf5 produced by gene targeting [2]. In mice,
catagen does eventually occur even in the absence of functional FGF5, indicating that other factors are also involved
in the cycle [2].
The FGF5 gene consists of three exons [3]. In wild-type
mice and other mammals, the FGF5 transcript is present
in two isoforms, with the smaller transcript due to alternative splicing in which exon 2 is excluded from the mRNA
[3,4]. The shorter transcript antagonizes the activity of the
longer transcript, suggesting that they function together in
hair cycle regulation [4]. In mice, the Fgf5 mutation causing the long-hair angora phenotype affects exon 1 [2]. In
dogs, sequencing of the FGF5 gene in 218 individuals
from 14 breeds, including three dog breeds fixed for long
hair and five breeds fixed for short hair, identified a missense mutation in exon 1 as responsible for the long
haired phenotype [5]. In domestic cats, the FGF5 gene was
shown to be associated with hair length [6,7], with four
independent mutations in exon 1 or 3 considered to be
functionally significant in controlling hair length in a survey of more than 380 individuals from 26 short- or longhaired breeds, non-breed cats and two pedigrees [6]. In
rabbits, mutations in FGF5 have been reported to have
significant association with wool yield [8]. Given that the
species for which FGF5 is known to influence hair length
belong to different superordinal placental clades that
diverged ca. 97 million years ago (Mya) (Figure 1) [9,10],
it seems plausible to hypothesize that FGF5 may be a critical determinant of hair length across mammals.
The Elephantidae, a family of proboscideans comprising
the living elephants, their extinct relatives, and the extinct
mammoths [11], would constitute an important group for
the comparative study of genes involved in regulating hair
cover and growth. The woolly mammoth, Mammuthus
primigenius, was covered with hair ranging in length from
a few centimeters to over 90 cm, with coarse outer hairs,
beneath which were shorter, thinner hairs forming
densely packed underwool (maximum 2.5-8 cm long)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/232

that formed a thermal insulating layer [12,13]. By contrast, extant elephants are sparsely covered with hair and
have hair of short length [12]. Given the role of FGF5 in
determining hair length in a diverse set of mammalian
taxa, we hypothesized that loss of function of this gene
may play a role in the longer hair length of the woolly
mammoth. We therefore generated and compared
sequences of FGF5 from living elephants and the woolly
mammoth. In addition, using a combination of bioinformatics analysis and DNA sequencing, another gene
related to hair phenotype in humans, type I hair keratin
pseudogene (KRTHAP1) [14], was examined, as were
three other genes coding for hair keratin proteins [15].

Results
The FGF5 gene was sequenced from a woolly mammoth
and from two Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), two
African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) and two
African forest elephants (L. cyclotis) (Table 1) [16]. For the
woolly mammoth, protocols established for ancient DNA
were used [17], with the complete FGF5 coding sequence
obtained for Indigirka mammoth N2031, a ca. 1100013000 year-old tooth from the Indigirka River basin, Federal Republic of Russia. PCR products from the Indigirka
mammoth were amplified from multiple extracts at two
different laboratories (Norfolk and Thunder Bay), with 2
or more PCRs performed per fragment, and PCR fragments cloned and sequenced. Among-clone variation was
observed but no consistent differences among amplifications were detected. Partial sequence was also obtained
from the Jarkov mammoth, a ca. 20,380 year-old sample
from the Taimyr Peninsula, Federal Republic of Russia.
(See Methods and Additional file 1 for further information on the mammoths and laboratory protocols and
primers).
The complete 5' UTR, complete open reading frames
(ORFs) of the three exons, and part of the promoter region
of the FGF5 gene were sequenced in the elephants and the
Indigirka woolly mammoth (Table 1). All of the elephants
as well as the woolly mammoth had an uninterrupted
open reading frame (without premature stop codons). In
each of the elephantids, exon 1 was 593 bp in length (229
bp of 5' UTR, 364 bp of coding region); exon 2 was 104
bp; while the protein coding region of exon 3 was 348 bp,
with 40 bp of the 3' UTR also sequenced. The four boundaries between exons and introns were identical across all
elephantids sequenced, thus FGF5 does not vary at these
splice sites among elephantids. Full sequencing of the two
introns was not attempted due to their length: 7,729 bp
and 11,312 bp for introns 1 and 2, respectively, in human,
with even longer introns present in savanna elephant
based on genomic traces (data not shown). Additionally,
the mammoth genomic sequences [15] were found to

have poor coverage of both introns in the mammoth
(data not shown).
Only two mammoth-specific differences were found: one
in the promoter and one in exon 3 (Table 1). The substitution in the promoter sequence (Table 1) did not alter
any predicted transcription factor binding sites [18]. The
difference present in exon 3 of the mammoth was a guanine to adenine substitution at position 790 that was a
silent mutation, i.e. did not alter the amino acid sequence
(Table 1). This substitution also did not lead to a rare
codon being present in the mammoth. The mammoth
FGF5 amino acid sequence was identical to that of 2 of the
3 extant elephant species. This suggested that all
elephantids including the long-haired mammoths had a
functional FGF5 protein.
The nucleotide sequence of FGF5 varied among living
elephantids (Table 1), although only one non-synonymous substitution was found among living or extinct
elephantids. In both forest elephant individuals, exon 1
(nucleotide position 327) contained a codon for glycine
at residue 33, whereas a codon for alanine was present in
other elephantids at this position (Table 1, Figure 2). This
is a physicochemically conservative change [19]. Among
other mammals for which FGF5 sequence is available, this
G33A mutation was found to be present only in the in
rodent FGF5 protein sequence (Figure 2). The mutation is

located at the N-terminus of the protein (Figure 2). The Nand C-termini of other members of the FGF family play
key roles in the specificity of interaction with the FGFreceptors (FGFRs). [20]. However, this mutation resides
within a mainly unstructured region, predicted to be an
extended loop downstream of the signal peptide (Figure
3A and data not shown). Thus, the G33A mutation in forest elephants would be unlikely to affect the secondary
structure of the FGF5 protein. Both glycine and alanine are
nonpolar, neutral amino acids, with neighboring hydropathy indices [21,22] in the hydrophobic range, which precludes prediction of their structural position, i.e. external
or internal. The tertiary structure of this region could not
be modeled, because the structure of this region has not
been experimentally resolved in any member of the FGF
family. Analysis using SIFT and POLYPHEN programs
suggested that while the G33A mutation may increase the
stability of the protein, the G33A mutation in forest elephants should not have serious consequences on FGF5
protein function (data not shown).
Human and mammoth FGF5 protein sequences were also
compared [23,24]. FGF5 is predicted to be secreted and
has an almost identical signal peptide sequence for the
two species (Figure 3A). The major difference between the
two sequences is an insertion/deletion of three amino
acids at the N-terminal region. This region is predicted to
include many O-glucosylation sites, suggesting a putative

difference in glycosylation between the two FGF5 proteins
(Figure 3A). The two proteins are predicted to have a
unique N-glycosylation site at position 110 of the human
sequence.
The general features of the amino acids of mammalian
FGF5 are shown in Additional file 1, as are the phylogenetic relationships among FGF5 amino acid sequences.
The FGF5 proteins are very similar across elephantids but
differ from those of other mammalian FGF5 proteins. To
test whether any of these differences would be predicted
to alter the three-dimensional structure of the elephantid
FGF5 proteins, the tertiary structures of FGF5 in different
species were predicted. This analysis predicted that all
described mammalian FGF5 proteins fold similarly (data
not shown). The structural analysis also revealed that the
amino acid differences between human and mammoth
FGF5 sequences (shown in green color in Figure 3B) do
not correspond to residues known to interact with the FGF
receptor (FGFR, yellow color) and heparin (blue color)
(Figure 3B). The two amino acid differences between
humans and mammoths that are included in the 3D
model are predicted to be parts of loops and do not seem
to affect the secondary or the tertiary conformation of the
FGF5 molecule (Figure 3B).
To examine the quality of sequence traces for the recently
published genome sequence of the woolly mammoth
[15], the mammoth FGF5 DNA sequences generated for
this study were compared using BLAST to homologous
sequences generated by the Mammoth Genome Project
http://mammoth.psu.edu[15]. Five matching mammoth
genome sequences were found, comprising sequence coverage of about 50% (714/1434 bp). Coverage of the mam-

moth genome varied by region for the FGF5 gene. Four
genomic sequences matched the promoter and 5' UTR;
these covered 99% (513/520 bp) of the corresponding
region sequenced by the current study. There were 6 discrepancies among the traces covering this region. Only
one genomic sequence was found that overlapped with
the coding regions, and it covered only 22% (201/915 bp)
of the sequence determined for the current study, with
nine discrepancies found between genomic traces and our
sequences. Overall, four of the five mammoth genomic
sequences had discrepancies with the mammoth
sequences generated for the current study, with a total of
15 nucleotide site discrepancies detected. The discrepancies relative to our sequence likely reflect damage present
in the ancient DNA of the mammoths used to generate
genomic sequences. Similar ancient DNA damage affected
the mammoth sequences generated for the current study
(although for the current study multiple clones from at
least two independent PCRs per fragment were used to
successfully generate a consensus sequence). For five PCR
amplicons used in the current study to determine the
sequence of the FGF5 promoter, the among-clone diversity was in the range 0-9 (see Additional file 1). Unlike
PCR-based approaches where multiple PCRs can be performed and multiple clonal sequences per PCR determined to generate a consensus sequence, the mammoth
genome does not currently have high enough coverage per
base to be confident that observed differences among
traces, individuals or species represent the true sequence
rather than ancient DNA damage. Thus although the
mammoth genome is extremely useful for designing
mammoth-specific primers and for initial queries, our
data suggest that PCR, cloning and sequencing would still
be required to determine mammoth DNA sequences, to

account both for ancient DNA damage and gaps in the
low-coverage genome sequences.
Like FGF5, other loci have been identified that are associated with reduced hair cover. In humans the type I hair
keratin pseudogene KRTHAP1 has a premature stop
codon in the fourth exon, and protein is not detected in
human hair follicles [14]. In great apes, the orthologous
gene has an intact ORF, with RNA expressed and protein
translated in the hair follicles of chimpanzees (cHaA) and
gorillas (gHaA) [14]. Thus, while closely related primates
with dense hair coverage express this gene, relatively hairless humans do not. Using the Loxodonta africana draft
genome sequence, all of the homologous exons except for
exon 7 for this gene were identified. Exon 1 displayed a
predicted premature stop codon (Figure 4). Thus, as in
humans, this gene appeared to be disrupted in the
savanna African elephant. A 302 bp segment of exon 1
was therefore amplified and sequenced from the Indigirka

mammoth to examine the region that contained the premature stop codon in the elephant. The stop codon was
found to be present in the mammoth as well (Figure 4),
suggesting that this mutation is not involved in hair phenotype differences among elephantids.
Among mammals, hair phenotype is affected by hair keratin genes [25]. We therefore examined keratin genes
reported as displaying either elephant or mammoth
unique differences [15], using genomic sequences of
savanna elephant or woolly mammoth [15,26]. KRT25
was identified as having a unique alanine to serine
change, but this was specific to only one of two woolly
mammoths previously sequenced [15]. Similarly, in the
elephantids KRT27 and KRT83 were found to code for rare
amino acid differences. However, only a methionine to

both DNA (above) and amino acid sequences (below, in boldface) are shown. Premature stop codons predicted for the

differences in KRT27 and KRT83 are unlikely to be associated with differences in hair cover.

tion of our results suggests that FGF5 was not the major
genetic determinant of long hair in mammoth.

Discussion

Similarly, no differences were found among elephantids
for partial sequences of several additional candidate genes
such as KRTHAP1, KRT25, KRT27, and KRT83. Thus, none
of the candidate genes examined thus far demonstrated a
clear difference exclusive to mammoths, which would be
necessary for establishing a role in their unique dense and
long-haired phenotype relative to extant elephants. While
a host of additional genes are known to influence hair
development, many play other critical developmental
roles and would likely be lethal if function were perturbed
[25]. Thus, future candidate genes will likely reside among
the keratin and keratin-associated protein (KRTAP) genes,
believed to play a role in the evolution of mammalian
hair characteristics [27]. Among mammals, KRTAP gene
repertoires vary considerably, with homogenization
within groups [27], although the genes have not been catalogued in elephants or other afrotheres. Once the
savanna elephant genome is complete, keratin and KRTAP
genes from this species may be identified as candidates for
determining the hair differences among elephantids.

To date, the FGF5 mutations found to produce long hair
have been uncovered in phenotypic variants among laboratory or domestic mammals, including mice, rabbits,
dogs and cats (Figure 1) [2,5,6,8]. A role for FGF5 in interas opposed to intra-species differences in hair length has
not been established. Nonetheless, the association of
FGF5 mutations with long-hair phenotypes in a wide variety of distantly related mammals (Figure 1) suggested that
FGF5 might be a determinant of hair length in mammals
in general. To test this hypothesis we sequenced the open
reading frames of all three exons, the 5' UTR and the promoter region of the FGF5 gene in the relatively hairless
extant elephantids and in the woolly mammoth. Our data
show that these regions of FGF5 are highly conserved
among elephantids, including the woolly mammoth.
Only one variant in the amino acid sequence was detected
among elephantids, the G33A mutation in forest elephants coded by exon 1. However, our analysis suggested
that this mutation would not greatly affect protein function, a conclusion also supported by the presence of same
amino acid substitution in the wild-type sequence of
FGF5 in murid rodents. While regulatory mechanisms
may exist that would not be detectable by our study, and
a role for FGF5 in the long hair of mammoths cannot be
completely ruled out, the most parsimonious interpreta-

Among living mammals hairlessness is more pronounced
among fully aquatic species of sirenians and cetaceans
(Figure 1); thus the designation of humans and elephants
as "hairless" is a relative term [28]. In the case of elephants, hairlessness may be a thermoregulatory adaptation to large body size [28], which would be consistent

with a gain of hair cover for the woolly mammoth
[12,29], since mammoths appear first in Africa before the
lineage adapted to colder environments [11]. In considering the evolution and genetics of hair cover in extant elephants, woolly mammoths and other proboscideans, a
number of factors must be taken into account. First, it is
difficult to determine based on outgroups whether hair
cover was lost in extant elephantids or gained in the
woolly mammoth. The presence of considerable hair
cover in a distantly related outgroup to the elephantids,
the American mastodon (Mammut americanum) [30,31],
does not necessarily suggest that hair cover is ancestral.
Hair cover in the American mastodon may comprise a
convergent adaptation to cold and/or aquatic habitats,
rather than an ancestral state [12]. Second, the proboscidean lineage that gave rise to both elephantids and mastodons is likely to have derived from aquatic or semiaquatic ancestors [32,33]. Although many semi-aquatic
species are not hairless [28], proboscideans derive from a
common ancestor with the fully aquatic and hairless sirenians [32]; while Proboscidea and Sirenia, along with
Hyracoidea (hyraxes, which are not hairless), comprise
the Paenungulata, one of the few unresolved trichotomies
among extant mammalian orders [9]. Additionally, some
ancestral proboscideans were as large as living elephants
[32], and if hairlessness is an adaptation to large body size
in terrestrial mammals, it may have been the ancestral
state in proboscideans [12,28,29].
A third consideration is that, both in the case of the hyraxsirenian-proboscidean clade and the elephantid clade, the
evidence suggests that divergence of the ancestral line into
two and then three descendent lineages occurred in quick
succession. Among the elephantids, nearly complete
mtDNA sequences have been generated for all three genera including mammoths [34-36]; using the mastodon
mito-genome as an outgroup suggests that Loxodonta
diverged from the common ancestor of Elephas and Mammuthus ca. 7.6 Mya; followed by the divergence of the two
latter genera ca. 6.7 Mya (Figure 1) [36]. The order of
divergence among the Paenungulata remains unresolved
[9], suggesting, as in the case of the elephantids, that the
two divergences that yielded the three mammalian orders
occurred in rapid succession. The rapid divergence of lineages in both cases suggests that incongruent lineage sorting of alleles may have affected many loci, causing
discrepancies between gene and species trees [37-39].
Interestingly, the mammoth and African elephant FGF5
sequences are identical at positions -112, -150 and -269 of
the promoter (Table 1), while differing from the Asian elephant sequence even though the Asian elephant and
mammoth are sister taxa [36]. This suggests that this
region of the genome may have been subject to incongruent lineage sorting in which the gene tree does not match
the species tree [37], as has been reported for other gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/232

segments [38]. Thus both convergent evolution and
incongruent lineage sorting may have affected genes
involved in hair cover among the Proboscidea.

Conclusion
Although the gene for long hair in mammoths was not
here identified, proboscideans remain an important
group for understanding the evolution of hair cover.
While most mammals have dense hair cover, humans and
extant elephants are notable in being relatively hairless
[28], and both are closely related to species with much
greater hair cover (great apes and woolly mammoths,
respectively). Both lineages are also noteworthy in being
"genome-enabled" [40] for the study of genes affecting
hair cover. The human and chimpanzee genomes have
been sequenced [41], while the elephant genome is being
sequenced [26], and substantial coverage for the mammoth genome is now available [15]. Other than aquatic
species, the number of other mammalian genera considered to be "hairless" is quite small [28]. Thus, for a comparative approach to the evolution of hair cover,
proboscideans comprise an important group for further
research.

Methods
Samples
Modern elephant DNA was extracted from blood or tissue
samples. Wild African savanna elephants Laf-KR0014 and
Laf-KR0138 were from Kruger National Park, South
Africa. Wild African forest elephants Lcy-LO3505 and LcyLO3508 were from LopÃ© National Park in Gabon. Asian
elephants Ema-6 and Ema-10 were zoo animals at the
Rosamond Gifford Zoo at Burnet Park, Syracuse, NY. Both
Ema-6 (North American studbook number 27) and Ema10 (North American studbook number 28) had been
wild-caught, most likely in Thailand.

The mammoth tooth designated N2031, which is the
focus of this project, is from the Indigirka River basin, Russian Federation. N2031 was found in 1965 on the
Berelekh river (a tributary of the Indigirka river), in the
Berelekh mammoth "cemetery" in situ. The approximate
geological age is 11000 - 13000 years before present (BP;
G. Boeskorov, personal communication). The sample was
originally obtained from the Geological Museum, Geological Institute, Yakutsk. Partial sequences were also
obtained from the Jarkov mammoth discovered in the
Taimyr Pensinsula, Russian Federation and dated to ca.
20,380 years BP [42]. In order to obtain material for DNA
extraction, an electric drill with individual sterile drill bits
were used at low speed to collect the bone powder and
shavings.

DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing
Extractions of mammoth samples in Norfolk were carried
out in a room dedicated to ancient DNA work in a CleanSpot PCR hood (Coy Laboratory) following an established
protocol [43]. Likewise, all pre-amplification work in
Thunder Bay was performed in a 'Clean Lab'. PCR amplifications were performed at least twice per primer pair.
Primer sequences and details of ancient DNA extractions,
PCR and sequencing are included in Additional file 1. All
PCR products were cloned and sequenced since direct
sequencing can lead to an erroneous sequence due to contamination and DNA damage in the extract. Cloning and
sub-sampling individual representative amplified
sequences provides a better representation of the original
template amplified [44], therefore none of the mammoth
consensus sequences generated in this study were determined from direct sequencing.

DNA from extant elephants (~50 ng) underwent amplification by PCR using 200 nM final concentration of each
oligonucleotide primer in 1.5 mM MgCl2, with AmpliTaq
Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems Inc. [ABI]).
Primers are listed in Additional file 1. For all primer pairs,
PCR consisted of an initial 95Â°C for 9:45 min; with cycles
of 20 sec at 94Â°C, followed by 30 sec at 60Â°C (3 cycles);
58Â°C, 56Â°C, 54Â°C, or 52Â°C (5 cycles each temperature);
or 50Â°C (last 22 cycles), followed by 30 sec extension at
72Â°C; with a final extension of 3 min at 72Â°C. PCR products were enzyme-purified [45] and sequenced using the
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI).
Extension products were purified with Sephadex G-50
(Amersham), and resolved on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. The software Sequencher 4.5 (Gene Codes Corp.)
was used to edit chromatograms and assemble contigs.
Gene identity was established by homology to GenBank
entries with BLAST [46]. Direct sequences for elephants
and consensus sequences for mammoths generated for
FGF5 and KRTHAP1 have been deposited in GenBank
[GenBank:FJ755444-FJ755451].
Protein sequence analysis and structural prediction
Sequences were collected from the NCBI and the
ENSEMBL databases using both keyword and homology
searches. Multiple protein sequence alignments were performed using MAFFT 6 (E-INS-i algorithm; scoring matrix:
BLOSUM 62; gap opening penalty: 1.53; gap extension
penalty: 0.00) [47]. Pairwise alignments were performed
using the Smith-Waterman algorithm [48]. N- and O-glycosylation sites were predicted using the NetNGlyc 1.0
and NetOGlyc 3.1 webservers http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services[49]. The signal peptides were predicted using the
SignalP 3.0 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/Sig
nalP[50]. The effects of mutations on protein function
were predicted using the SIFT [51] and POLYPHEN programs [52]. Tests on protein stability and secondary struc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/232

ture predictions were performed using the MuPro http://
www.ics.uci.edu/~baldig/mutation.html and SSPro8
http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu webservers [53,54].
The PDB database http://www.pdb.org was searched to
check whether the FGF5 structure has been experimentally
resolved, but with negative results. For this reason,
homology modeling and fold recognition were performed
using
the
SWISS-MODEL
http://swiss
model.expasy.org[55]
and
PHYRE
http://
www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre[56] web servers. Both programs identified the human FGF9 structure [PDB:1IHK]
as the best candidate (most similar; E-value = 10-45) to
build a structural model of FGF5. Therefore, the mammoth, elephant and human FGF5 proteins were modeled
by using the human FGF9 as template. Pairwise structural
alignments and model structural superimposition was
performed using the SSAP http://cathdb.info/cgi-bin/
SsapServer.pl[57,58] and DaliLite http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
Tools/dalilite[59] webservers. Tertiary structure figures
were generated using PyMol (DeLano Scientific; http://
pymol.org).
FGF5 sequences from therian (placental and marsupial)
mammals were aligned using MAFFT 6 (G-INS-i algorithm with JTT200 scoring matrix; gap opening penalty:
1.53; gap extension penalty: 0.00), and examined for residue variation using the FINGERPRINT web server http://
evol.mcmaster.ca/fingerprint[60]. The phylogenetic relationships among FGF5 sequences were examined in a
maximum likelihood framework in RAxML 7.0.4 [61]
using the best-fit JTT protein substitution matrix [62] with
empirical residue frequencies and among-site rate heterogeneity modeled with ï with four classes [63], after comparing the log-likelihood of all substitution models
available in RAxML.
Genome project sequences
Elephant sequences of KRTHAP1, KRT25, KRT27 AND
KRT83 were identified in the NCBI Loxodonta africana
genome Trace Archives http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Traces/home using MegaBlast [64]. Human or chimpanzee KRTHAP1 exon sequences were used as queries and
obtained from GenBank [GenBank:AJ401054 and
Y16795] or from the UCSC Genome Browser http://
genome.ucsc.edu[65] (Human March 2006 [hg18] assembly). Elephant trace files obtained by matches to primates
were themselves used as queries against the elephant
genomic trace files, to obtain additional elephant
sequences, with the process repeated to obtain further
upstream and downstream elephant traces and sequences.
Mammoth sequences were obtained from the mammoth
genome
project
BLAST
server
http://mam
moth.psu.edu[15]. Mammoth sequences with a score
above 100 were used. The mammoth and elephant
sequences were also verified using a BLAT search [66]
