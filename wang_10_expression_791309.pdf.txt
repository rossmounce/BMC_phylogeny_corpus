Abstract
Background: The cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like gene superfamily (CESA/CSL) is proposed to
encode enzymes for cellulose and non-cellulosic matrix polysaccharide synthesis in plants. Although the rice (Oryza
sativa L.) genome has been sequenced for a few years, the global expression profiling patterns and functions of
the OsCESA/CSL superfamily remain largely unknown.
Results: A total of 45 identified members of OsCESA/CSL were classified into two clusters based on phylogeny and
motif constitution. Duplication events contributed largely to the expansion of this superfamily, with Cluster I and II
mainly attributed to tandem and segmental duplication, respectively. With microarray data of 33 tissue samples
covering the entire life cycle of rice, fairly high OsCESA gene expression and rather variable OsCSL expression were
observed. While some members from each CSL family (A1, C9, D2, E1, F6 and H1) were expressed in all tissues
examined, many of OsCSL genes were expressed in specific tissues (stamen and radicles). The expression pattern of
OsCESA/CSL and OsBC1L which extensively co-expressed with OsCESA/CSL can be divided into three major groups
with ten subgroups, each showing a distinct co-expression in tissues representing typically distinct cell wall
constitutions. In particular, OsCESA1, -3 & -8 and OsCESA4, -7 & -9 were strongly co-expressed in tissues typical of
primary and secondary cell walls, suggesting that they form as a cellulose synthase complex; these results are
similar to the findings in Arabidopsis. OsCESA5/OsCESA6 is likely partially redundant with OsCESA3 for OsCESA
complex organization in the specific tissues (plumule and radicle). Moreover, the phylogenetic comparison in rice,
Arabidopsis and other species can provide clues for the prediction of orthologous gene expression patterns.
Conclusions: The study characterized the CESA/CSL of rice using an integrated approach comprised of phylogeny,
transcriptional profiling and co-expression analyses. These investigations revealed very useful clues on the major
roles of CESA/CSL, their potentially functional complement and their associations for appropriate cell wall synthesis
in higher plants.

Background
Plant cell walls make up the most abundant renewable
biomass on the earth. Of the main wall polysaccharides,
cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane
whereas non-cellulosic polysaccharides (pectins and
hemicelluloses) are made in the Golgi body. In higher
plants, CESA was first isolated from developing cotton
fibers, and it was further characterized in Arabidopsis as

catalytic subunits of cellulose synthase complexes
(CSCs) that locate within the plasma membrane [1,2].
The CSCs are believed to be a rosette structure holding
as many as 36 individual CESA proteins. In Arabidopsis,
at least three CESA isoforms are required for the synthesis of primary (AtCESA1, -3 & -6) and secondary
(AtCESA4, -7 & -8) cell walls. Mutant and co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that AtCESA2 & -5
are partially redundant with AtCESA6 [3-5]. Consequently, the CESA family has been identified in other
plants, such as maize [6], barley [7], poplar [8,9], pine
[10], moss [11] and rice [12]. Those higher plants
appear to have many more CESA family members, but

very little is known about their functions in comparison
to those from Arabidopsis.
A large number of cellulose synthase-like (CSL) genes
showing sequence similarity to CESA have been identified. In Arabidopsis, a total of 30 CSL genes are classified
into the six following families: CSLA, B, C, D, E and G
[13]. Based on the common motif DXD, D, Q/RXXRW,
all CSL proteins are predicted to encode processive glycosyl transferases (GTs) [14-17]. There are increasing
lines of evidence supporting CSL as catalytic enzymes for
non-cellulosic polysaccharide synthesis. In Arabidopsis
and guar, genes of the CSLA family are demonstrated to
encode (1,4)-b-D-mannan synthases [16-19]; in rice,
genes of the CSLF family have been implicated in the biosynthesis of (1,3;1,4)-b-D-glucans [20]. More recently, it
has also been established that barley CSLH genes, like
CSLF, are able to direct mixed-linkage b-glucan biosynthesis [21]. In addition, the CSLC family contains a glucan
synthase involved in the synthesis of the backbone of
xyloglucan [22,23], and several CSLD mutants have been
characterized for their potential roles in wall polysaccharide (xylan and homogalacturonan) synthesis [24-27].
However, even though there are a number of CSLD
mutants in Arabidopsis and rice displaying interesting
phenotypes, very little is known about the biochemical
function(s) of CSLD proteins. The detailed functions of
these CSL genes, especially those of families CSLB, E and
G, remain to be clarified.
Rice, one of the major food crops across the world, is a
model species for the functional genomic characterization
of monocotyledonous plants. With the completion of the
rice genome sequence, the CESA/CSL superfamily has been
identified in rice http://waltonlab.prl.msu.edu/CSL_
updates.htm. This rice superfamily has shown a striking difference in the CSL families between rice and Arabidopsis,
reflecting the distinct cell wall compositions of dicots and
monocots [28]. In contrast, several orthologs of the AtCSL
genes exhibited a similar function in rice [29]. But, the
OsCESA/CSL functions still remain largely unknown.
In this work, we utilized an innovative approach for
the characterization of genes of the CESA/CSL superfamily in higher plants. We first performed a phylogenetic and structural analysis to determine their potential
functions. Then, we focused on an integrative analysis of
co-expression profiling and regulations using 33 tissue
samples from the entire life cycle of two rice varieties.
We further carried out a comparative analysis of CESA/
CSL in rice and Arabidopsis.

Methods
Database searches for OsCESA/CSL genes in rice

The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of the cellulose synthase domain (PF03552) was downloaded from
PFam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/. We employed a name

Page 2 of 16

search and the protein family ID PF03552 for the identification of OsCESA/CSL genes from the rice genome.
Information about the chromosomal localization, coding
sequence (CDS), amino acid (AA) and full length cDNA
accessions was obtained from TIGR http://www.tigr.org
and KOME http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/cDNA. The
corresponding protein sequences were confirmed by the
Pfam database http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/
search.shtml.
Sequence and structure analysis

We performed our exon-intron structure analysis using
GSDS http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/[30]. The protein transmembrane helices were predicted by the TMHMM Server V2.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/
[31,32]. Protein subcellular locations were analyzed using
WoLF PSORT http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/ [33], an extension
of the PSORT II program http://www.psort.org.
Phylogenetic analyses and motif identification

The multiple alignment analysis was performed using
the Clustal X program (version 1.83) [34] and MAFFT
[35]. The unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed
with the MEGA3.1 program and the neighbor joining
method [36] with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Protein
sequences were analyzed using the MEME program
http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi for the
confirmation of the motifs. The MEME program (version 4.0) was employed with the following parameters:
number of repetitions, any; maximum number of motifs,
25; optimum motif width set to >6 and <200. The
motifs were annotated using the InterProScan http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/ search program.
Chromosomal localization and gene duplication

The OsCESA/CSL genes were mapped on chromosomes
by identifying their chromosomal positions given in the
TIGR rice database. The duplicated genes were elucidated from the segmental genome duplication of rice
http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/segmental_dup/100.
The DAGchainer program [37] was used to determine
the segmental duplications with following parameters: V
= 5 B = 5 E = 1e-10-filter seg and distance = 100 kb.
Genes separated by five or fewer genes were considered
to be tandem duplicates. The distance between these
genes on the chromosomes was calculated, and the percentage of protein sequence similarity was determined
by the MegAlign software 4.0.
Genome-wide expression analysis of OsCESA/CSL and
OsBC1L in rice and AtCESA/CSL and AtCOBL in
Arabidopsis

The expression profile data of OsCESA/CSL in 33 tissue
examples (Additional file 1) of Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and

Minghui 63 (MH63) were obtained from the CREP database http://crep.ncpgr.cn and from a rice transcriptome
project using the Affymetrix Rice GeneChip microarray
(Additional file 2). Massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) data http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/ was used to
determine the expression profiles of the genes with conflicting probe set signals. The expression values were logtransformed, and cluster analyses were performed using a
software cluster with Euclidean distances and the hierarchical cluster method of “complete linkage clustering”.
The clustering tree was constructed and viewed in Java
Treeview. The same method was used in the “artificial
mutant” analysis. However, in the hierarchical cluster of
the “artificial mutant” analysis, the expression data for
regarding gene(s) or tissues were deleted. All Arabidopsis
microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/ using the GSE series accession numbers GSE5629,
GSE5630, GSE5631, GSE5632, GSE5633 and GSE5634
(Additional file 3 and 4). Subsequent analysis of the gene
expression data was performed in the statistical computing language R http://www.r-project.org using packages
available from the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org. The raw data were processed with the
Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite (MAS Version 5,
Affymetrix) [38].
RT-PCR analysis of representative genes of the OsCESA/
CSLD family

The primers designed for the RT-PCR analysis are listed in
Additional file 5. Samples were collected from Zhenshan
97 (ZS97), one of the varieties used in microarray. The
samples were ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar
and pestle. Total RNA (4 μg) was isolated using a RNA
extraction kit (TransZol reagent, TransGen) and treated
with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) for 15 min to eliminate possible contaminating DNA. Then, first strand
cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA with an
oligo(dT)18 primer in a 50 μl reaction (diluted to 200 μl
before use) using an M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
the PCR amplification of the reverse transcription product,
the PCR reaction was performed in a volume of 25 μl containing 2 μl of template. The reactions were conducted
with rTaq polymerase (Takara Biotechnology, Japan) on a
Bio-rad MyCycler thermal cycler using the following program: 3 min at 95°C for pre-denaturation, followed by 29
cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 20 s at 60°C and 30 s at 72°C, and a
final 5 min extension at 72°C.
Plant cell wall fractionation and polysaccharide
colorimetric assays

The plant tissues were firstly heated at 110-120°C for
about 10 min to inactivate the enzymes, before they

Page 3 of 16

were fully ground in a mortar and pestle with liquid
nitrogen and dried to constant weight at 65°C for about
2 days. The extraction and fractionation of the cell wall
polysaccharides were performed with 0.5 M phosphate
buffer, chloroform-methanol (1:1, V/V), DMSO-water
(9:1, V/V), 0.5% ammonium oxalate, 4 M KOH, acetic
acid-nitric acid-water (8:1:2, V/V/V) and 72% (w/w)
H2SO4, and the extraction was measured using colorimetric assays according the method reported in a previous study [39].

Results
OsCESA/CSL superfamily in rice

Searching the TIGR database revealed 45 sequences
that significantly matched to CESA/CSL superfamily,
out of which eleven are predicted as OsCESA and 34
as OsCSL http://waltonlab.prl.msu.edu/CSL_updates.
htm (Table 1). The sequences of OsCESA10 were short
and appeared to be truncated. Of the 11 OsCESA
sequences, CESA 1-9 contained a cellulose synthase
domain (CS) and zinc finger structure, whereas CESA
10 & -11 only harbored a CS domain. When referring
to the CSL classification in Arabidopsis, the 34 OsCSL
proteins with a CS domain could be divided into six
groups (Table 1). In addition, 31 genes had KOME
cDNA support, and probes for 41 genes could be
found in the CREP database (Table 1). The “DXD, D,
QXXRW” motif is typically in the OsCESA/CSL family,
but OsCSLA10 and OsCSLE2 showed alternative
motifs ("DXD, D, RXXRW” and “DXD, D, LXXRW”);
OsCESA10, 11 and CSLH3 contained only “DXD” and
lacked “D, LXXRW” (Additional file 6). Besides the
“DXD, D, LXXRW” motif, some novel conserved
amino acid residues (G, E, G, P and G) with unknown
biochemical functions were also detected in this
region.
Structural and phylogenetic analyses of OsCESA/CSL

An unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated from the
alignments of 45 OsCESA/CSL protein sequences with
two distinct clusters (Figure 1). Cluster I was resolved
into five branches, namely Cluster IA (OsCESA), Cluster
IB (OsCSLD), Cluster IC (OsCSLF), Cluster ID
(OsCSLE) and Cluster IE (OsCSLH), whereas Cluster II
had two branches, Cluster IIA (OsCSLA) and Cluster
IIB (OsCSLC). In Cluster I, OsCESA had the most
introns, and the OsCSLD had the fewest number of
introns. In Cluster II, OsCSLA had more introns than
OsCSLC. The analysis of motif composition was in
agreement with the above OsCESA/CSL family classification (Additional files 7 and 8). Of the total 25 motifs
predicted, Cluster I contained 18 motifs and Cluster II
had 10 conserved motifs, of which three were in
common.

Tandem and segmental genome duplications of OsCESA/
CSL

The OsCESA/CSL members are distributed on 12 chromosomes of rice (Figure 2). As reported by Burton et al.
(2006) [20], members of the OsCLSF (9, 8, 2, 1, 4, &3)
are physically linked within a region of approximately
118 kb of rice chromosome 7. We discovered two additional tandem duplication sets (OsCSLH2/CSLH3 and

OsCSLE1/CSLE6) and seven segmental duplication sets
(OsCESA2/CESA8, OsCSLA1/CSLA9, OsCSLA2/CSLA4,
OsCSLA5/CSLA7, OsCSLA6/CSLA3, OsCSLC9/CSLC10
and OsCSLE2/CSLE6) that were assigned to the TIGR
segmental duplication blocks at a maximal length distance permitted between collinear gene pairs of 100 kb.
In most sets, both members (genes) in a segmental
duplication set were from same family. The extreme

example is from CSLA family; eight of nine members in this
family are in duplicated regions. Moreover, most of the
duplicated genes have a relatively close phylogenetic relationship; in particular, in the four sets OsCESA2/CESA8,
OsCSLA2/CSLA4, OsCSLA5/CSLA7, and OsCSLC9/CSLC10,
two member genes are phylogenetically closest to each
other (Figure 1A). Interestingly, the two pairs of segmental
sets (OsCESA2/CESA8 and OsCSLC9/CSLC10) join closely
in two chromosomes (Figure 2). Of the 45 OsCESA/CSL
genes, 23 are involved in duplication events. Therefore, segmental and large-scale tandem duplication events contributed largely to the expansion of this superfamily. Cluster I
families were mainly attributed to tandem duplication,
whereas Cluster II likely resulted from segmental genome
duplication.
OsCESA/CSL expressions

A microarray analysis was conducted for the expression of
OsCESA/CSL genes in two rice varieties (Additional file 2),
and the expression patterns of OsCESA and OsCSLD
families were further verified by RT-PCR analysis (Figure
3, Additional file 9). We also demonstrated the expression
of OsCESA/CSL genes in both individual and collective
levels (Figure 4). Generally, OsCESA genes, with the
exception of the OsCESA11, exhibited an extensively high
expression in most of the tissues examined; in particular,
OsCESA1 and OsCESA3 demonstrated extremely high
expression in many tissues over different developmental
stages of the life cycle (Figures 3 and 4). In addition, the
accumulative OsCESA expression levels were highest in
the stem and root, but were relatively low in the flag leaf
and stamen (Figure 4). Of the OsCSL families, six OsCSL
members (CSLA1, CSLC9, CSLD2, CSLE1, CSLF6 and

CSLH1) were expressed in all of the tissues examined. In
contrast, other OsCSL genes showed tissue-specific expression. For instance, CSLD3 & -5, CSLH2 and CSLC9
showed high stamen-specific expression, whereas CSLA5,
CSLD1 and CSLD4 were specific in the endosperm, radicle
and plumule, respectively. The accumulative expression of
all the CSL genes in a family is also depicted in Figure 4.
The overall expression of the family of CSLD genes is
highest in the stamen and lowest in the shoot of seedlings
with two tillers. The total expression of the CSLA genes
was highest in plumules (mostly contributed by CSLA1
and 6) and was followed by high expression in radicles
(roots) and calli, with the lowest expression detected in
flag leaves. The total expression of CSLC was higher in the
stamen and plumule/radicles, but was lower in leaves. Collectively the expression of the genes of the whole family
often accumulated to high levels in one or more of the tissues for which the CSL members showed preferences.
This may indicate functional homoplasy among the members in a family although most of them exhibit different
expression patterns.
Expression divergence of OsCESA/CSL genes in
duplication

We further observed the expression profiling of the duplicated OsCESA and OsCSL genes. The expression of the
two duplication sets OsCSLE1/OsCSLE6 and OsCSLE2/
OsCSLE6 were not included in the analysis because we
lacked the corresponding probe set of OsCSLE6. The
expression profile of the eight remaining sets of OsCESA/
CSL genes (two tandem duplication sets and six segmental
duplication sets) with the corresponding probes was analyzed. We found a divergent expression pattern within a

duplicated set (Figure 5). The pairwise expression correlation coefficients (r values) of the duplicated OsCESA/CSL
genes were below the level of significance at P = 0.05 (data
not shown). Of the nine gene sets, only CSLA2 and CSLA4
in a segmental duplication set (CSLA2/CSLA4) exhibited a
relatively similar expression pattern. The fate of four pairs
(CSLH2/CSLH3, CESA2/CESA8, and CSLC9/CSLC10)
could be described as nonfunctionalization, where one
member of the set lost expression in all tissues, while the
other showed strong expression. In the other duplication
sets, the expression patterns of both member genes were
partial complementary and/or overlapped. Comparison of
expression pattern shifts of the duplicated genes of the
OsCESA/CSL superfamily could reflect the divergence
hypotheses that a duplicate gene pair might be involved in:
nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization [40].

Because many genes of COBRA-like proteins, including the
brittle culm1 like family (OsBC1L), have been investigated
for cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and rice [41-44],
the OsBC1L genes were referred as markers of OsCESA/
CSL co-expression patterns in this study. Based on the hierarchical cluster analysis, the OsCESA/CSL family can be
classified into three major groups with ten distinct groups
that exhibit a complementary expression pattern spanning
33 tissues from entire life cycle of two rice varieties (Figure
6). Each group consists of multiple OsCESA/CSL members,
which show predominant co-expression in tissues with distinct cell wall constitutions (Table 2).
Generally, Group IA showed high co-expression in the
young vegetative tissues (M7/Z7-M11/Z11) typical of the
primary cell wall, and Group IB exhibited additional coexpression in other vegetative tissues (e.g., seedlings,
young shoots and stems). Five OsCESAs (5, -6 and 1, -3,
-8) were strongly co-expressed in those two groups, suggesting that OsCESA1, -3 & -8 may form a cellulose
synthase complex for primary cell wall biosynthesis. However, while OsCESA1 and OsCESA8 are tightly coexpressed, there are some differences in expression
between OsCESA3 and OsCESA1 &-8 (Figure 6). We
observed that OsCESA3 had exceptionally low expression
in the plumule and radicle (M8/Z8-M11/Z11), where the
expression of OsCESA5/OsCESA6 is relatively high (Figure
6). This observation might indicate the partial complementation of OsCESA3 by OsCESA5 & -6 in the expression pattern. In comparison to Group I, Group II showed
co-expression in three tissues rich in secondary cell walls
(old panicle, hull and spikelet) (Figure 6). However, three
OsCESAs (CESA4, -7 & -9) in the group also showed a coexpression pattern that overlapped with Group IB in
young and old stem tissues, which represent the transition
stage from primary to secondary cell wall synthesis. Thus,
OsCESA4, -7 & -9 may be organized as a cellulose
synthase complex involved in secondary cell wall synthesis.
In contrast, Group III appeared to show co-expression in
diverse tissues harboring specific cell wall structures. For
instance, five OsCSL genes of Group IIIB demonstrated
high co-expression in the stamen (M31/Z31), a tissue that
contains extremely high levels of pectins (Table 2), and
Group IIIC showed co-expressions in four early stages of
panicle development. Co-expression was detected between
the OsCESA and OsCSL families in all ten groups; we also
observed strong co-expression between the OsCESA/CSL
and OsBC1L families in seven groups, each containing at
least one OsBC1L family gene. For instance, OsBC1 and
OsBC1L5 both have correlation coefficients (r values)
above 0.94 with respect to their relevant OsCESA/CSL
genes. Interestingly, this extensive co-expression was only
found between BC1L and OsCESA/CSL. There are no
such extensive relationships found between OsCESA/CSL

Comparative co-expression analyses with Arabidopsis

Using the Arabidopsis public database, we presented a
co-expression profiling of 63 tissue samples, and compared it with rice (Figure 7, Table 3). Based on hierarchical clustering, the expression pattern of the AtCESA/
AtCSL genes could also be divided into three major
groups (Figure 7). In contrast, the expression patterns of
the CESA/CSL genes in both species are summarized in

Table 3. Clearly, the expression patterns of the genes of
the AtCESA/AtCSL superfamily fell into groups similar
to those of the OsCESA/CSL genes. As an example of
genes showing a similar expression pattern, AtCESA1, -3
& -6 showed high co-expression in the tissues of the
primary cell wall, whereas AtCESA4, -7 & -8 were coexpressed in the secondary cell wall tissues. As an example of genes showing a different expression pattern,
there was no AtCESA gene, like OsCESA3, showing an
exceptionally low expression level. In addition, distinct
CSL co-expressions were compared between rice and

Arabidopsis (Table 3). For example, a group of IC genes
(AtCSLG1, -2, &-3 and AtCSLB2) was specifically
expressed in flower organs (carpels or sepals) in Arabidopsis, while the OsCSLF genes (OsCSLF2 &-7) were
preferentially expressed in the hull of rice. Thus, the
gene expression pattern may reflect both the similarities
and differences in the cell wall composition of rice and
Arabidopsis.

Discussion
The previous characterization of the rice OsCESA/CSL
family was focused on phylogenetic and gene structure analyses [12,28]. Hazen et al. (2002) identified 37 OsCSL genes
[28]; however, some of the CSL genes are pseudogenes, and
these have now been updated http://waltonlab.prl.msu.edu/
CSL_updates.htm. For examples, CSLC4, -5, -6 &-8 were
verified as pseudogenes and were not included in this study.

could provide an innovative approach and important clues
toward understanding the roles of the CESA/CSL superfamily in cell wall biosynthesis in higher plants.
CESA/CSL evolution and classification

In principle, gene families are extended by three major
mechanisms: segmental duplication, tandem duplication
and retroposition [45,46]. Here we confirmed that both
tandem and segmental duplication events were largely
responsible for the expansion of the OsCESA/CSL
family. Interestingly, we characterized two clusters of
OsCESA/CSL and concluded that they not only differ in
phylogeny and motif constitution, but that they also
expanded in the following distinct ways: Cluster I
(OsCESA/CSLD, E, F and H) arose mainly from the tandem duplication, and Cluster II (CSLA/CSLC) resulted
from the segmental duplication. These results support a
previous report claiming that CSLA/CSLC has a different evolutionary origin compared to other CSL families
[12]. In terms of the duplicated gene expression, we
observed that two genes in a duplication set show a

strongly contrasting expression pattern. The fate of
duplicated genes in OsCESA/CSL could be described as
nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. None of the genes in a segmental duplication set have similar expression patterns. The latter
findings are consistent with a previous report whereby
growth-related genes were sensitive to high dosage of
gene expressions, and stress responsive genes were tolerant to high dosage [47].
The comparison of the CESA expression patterns
among seven plant species (rice, barley, maize, poplar,
cotton, eucalyptus and Arabidopsis) is depicted in the
unrooted neighbor-joining tree (Additional file 10).
Most clusters contain genes from both monocot and
dicot plants, and most orthologs show a higher similarity than paralogs in the CESA family, indicating that
some gene expansion may have arisen earlier than when
the divergence(s) of the species occurred. The latter
result is supported by reports whereby the orthologous
genes in a cluster show a similar expression pattern in
primary and secondary cell walls [48,49]. Furthermore,

we compared the expression patterns of some CSL
homologs in Arabidopsis, rice, barley and other species,
and a striking similarity was observed in the close orthologous genes across species (Additional file 11). We also
observed similarities of CSL orthologs in other aspects
such as gene duplication and intron-exon structure
(data not shown). Thus, such observations could be
helpful in the prediction of gene expression patterns of
orthologs in cereal species and other higher plants.
Analysis of OsCESA functions

Patterns of co-expression can reveal networks of functionally related genes and provide a deeper understanding of the processes required to produce multiple gene
products [50]. The genome-wide expression analysis of
the CESA family could provide insights into the potential functions of its members in cell wall biosynthesis.
Almost all OsCESA genes are highly expressed in the
tissues we examined, confirming their major roles in the
biosynthesis of cellulose, the main component of plant
cell walls. The co-expression profiling of the CESA
genes can somehow indicate their protein interaction/
association as an essential synthase complex for cellulose biosynthesis. Despite the use of the mutant analysis
and co-immunoprecipitation in Arabidopsis [3,5,51], the
application of these approaches in the identification of

the CESA complex in other higher plants, such as rice,
maize and barley has not been reported.
In this work, therefore, we utilized an alternative
approach via the integrative analysis of gene co-expression profiling and developmental regulations. First, we
confirmed the formation of two distinct cellulose
synthase complexes, AtCESA1, -3, & -6 and AtCESA4,
-7, & -8, in Arabidopsis from our AtCESA co-expression
profiling data (Figure 7). Similarly, we can assume that
OsCESA1, -3 & -8 and OsCESA4, -7 & -9 may be two
synthase complexes involved in primary and secondary
cell wall synthesis in rice, respectively (Figure 6, Table
2), which provides clues on the physical interactions of
proteins in the synthase complexes. The co-expression
profiling in Arabidopsis in this study, however, could
not further verify the previous finding of AtCESA6 as
partial redundant gene with AtCESA2 & -5 [4,5], probably because of the lack of essential expression data of
Arabidopsis tissues from the public microarray data
(Figure 7). Similarly, we could assume OsCESA3 to be a
partially redundant candidate gene with OsCESA5/
OsCESA6 given its low transcript level in specific tissues
(plumule and radicle), where the expression of
OsCESA5/OsCESA6 is relatively high (Figure 6). In other
words, OsCESA5 or -6 may be partially redundant with
OsCESA3 in those specific tissues. Eventually, we

Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/282

Page 13 of 16

demonstrated the partial redundancy of OsCESA5 or -6
with OsCESA3 by a novel approach, the “artificialmutant” analysis of gene co-expression profiling (Figures
8 and 9, Additional file 12 and 13). While OsCESA3 was
artificially deleted, the hierarchical cluster analysis
showed that OsCESA1 &-8 clustered together with the
OsCESA5 and OsCESA6. This result might indicate that
OsCESA1 & -8 form a synthase complex with OsCESA5
or OsCESA6 (Figure 8). However, deleting either
OsCESA1 or OsCESA8 did not disrupt the above organization (Figure 8). Even after the double deletion of
OsCESA3/OsCESA1 or OsCESA3/OsCESA8, OsCESA5
and OsCESA6 could somehow still organize a complex
with either OsCESA1 or OsCESA8 (Figure 8). Clearly,
the data are in support of our assumption. When the
gene expression data in the plumule and radicle tissues
were not included in the hierarchical cluster analysis,
OsCESA1 &-8 could not form a group with OsCESA5 or
OsCESA6 when OsCESA3 was artificially deleted (Figure
9). Thus, we believe that partial redundancy occurs in
the specific development stages/tissues (such as plumule
and radicle) of rice.
Characterization of the OsCSL family

Several OsCSL genes were demonstrated to exhibit relatively tissue-specific expression, indicating their specific/
unique roles for wall polysaccharides synthesis or their
potentially functional complements for appropriate cell
wall synthesis. For instance, in the pectin-rich and cellulose-less stamen tissue (Table 2), all OsCESAs have a
relatively low transcript level, but three OsCSLs
(OsCSLC9, OsCSLD5 and OsCslH2) exhibit specifically
high expression. In addition, all six OsCSL families
appear to have at least one highly expressed gene
(CSLA1, CSLC9, CSLD2, CSLE1, CSLF6 and CSLH1) in
all the tissues we examined, therefore suggesting that
the entire OsCSL family is essential for cell wall
biosynthesis.
The analysis of co-expression profiling and developmental regulations, together with a comparison with
Arabidopsis, can be used for the characterization of
OsCSLs. As described above, we concluded that ten coexpressed groups are expressed in cells/tissues with different cell wall constitution. Based on this information,
we could find clues about the predominant roles of
OsCSL genes in cell wall biosynthesis. For example,
OsCSLF2 and OsCSLF7 in Group IIA may have quite a
different role from other OsCSLF genes in Groups IB,
IIID an IIIE (Figure 6). OsCSLF2 and OsCSLF7 show a
uniquely high co-expression pattern with OsCESA4, -7
& -9 in the hull/spikelet tissue typical of secondary cell
walls (Figure 6); however, they both have a much lower
transcript level than OsCSLF6 and OsCSLF8 (Figure 4).
Because there are pentose-rich hemicelluloses in the

Figure 8 Gene co-expression profiling of OsCESA by “Artificialmutant” analysis in all the tissues examined.

hull tissue (Table 2), we assume that OsCSLF2 and
OsCSLF7 may also encode other synthase enzymes
besides the b-(1,3-1,4)-glucan synthase that was previously characterized. In addition, comparison of coexpression profiling in the stamen tissue between rice
(Group IIIB) and Arabidopsis (Group IIC) suggests that

Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/282

Page 14 of 16

consistent with the report that AtCSLD2 and AtCSLE1
apparently exhibit strong increases in expression in old
leaves versus young leaves in Arabidopsis [25]. The
authors proposed that the changes in expression of
these two genes may reflect a role in homogalacturonan
synthesis, which accumulated to a high level in old
leaves. The availability of more detailed information
about cell wall composition (e.g., monosaccharide) will
help in establishing links between CESA/CSL proteins
and the carbohydrates they might synthesize.

Conclusions
Previous analysis of the functions of CESA/CSL members on plant cell wall biosynthesis has been focused on
biochemical and genetic approaches in the model plant
Arabidopsis. Here, we performed a validated approach
that is applicable in higher plants and successful at finding out useful clues on OsCESA/CSL protein interaction
or association. Our approach not only relies on a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, but it also integrates
the characterization of co-expression profiling and regulations, which can reveal very useful clues on the
dynamic organization of OsCESA proteins as distinct
cellulose synthase complexes in primary and secondary
cell wall biosynthesis. We also conclude that the coexpression profiling of OsCESA/OsCSL and OsBC1L can
be associated with ten distinct groups in specific cell
wall polysaccharide synthesis. In a word, our results provide insights into functional analyses of CESA/CSL
family and of other GT families or cell wall-related
genes in rice and other higher plant species.
