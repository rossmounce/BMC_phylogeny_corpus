Abstract
Background: Vast migrations and subsequent assimilation processes have shaped the genetic composition of
Southeast Asia, an area of close contact between several major ethnic groups. To better characterize the genetic
variation of this region, we analyzed the entire mtDNA control region of 214 unrelated donors from Laos
according to highest forensic quality standards. To detail the phylogeny, we inspected selected SNPs from the
mtDNA coding region. For a posteriori data quality control, quasi-median network constructions and autosomal STR
typing were performed. In order to describe the mtDNA setup of Laos more thoroughly, the data were subjected
to population genetic comparisons with 16 East Asian groups.
Results: The Laos sample exhibited ample mtDNA diversity, reflecting the huge number of ethnic groups listed.
We found several new, so far undescribed mtDNA lineages in this dataset and surrounding populations. The Laos
population was characteristic in terms of haplotype composition and genetic structure, however, genetic
comparisons with other Southeast Asian populations revealed limited, but significant genetic differentiation.
Notable differences in the maternal relationship to the major indigenous Southeast Asian ethnolinguistic groups
were detected.
Conclusions: In this study, we portray the great mtDNA variety of Laos for the first time. Our findings will
contribute to clarify the migration history of the region. They encourage setting up regional and subpopulation
databases, especially for forensic applications. The Laotian sequences will be incorporated into the collaborative
EMPOP mtDNA database http://www.empop.org upon publication and will be available as the first mtDNA
reference data for this country.

Background
Laos is the only landlocked country of Mainland Southeast Asia. Under Siamese control since the 18th century,
Laos became part of French Indochina in 1893 and
gained full independence in 1954. The country was
severely affected by the Vietnam War. In 1975, the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic was established. It has a
population of almost seven million [1]. Southeast Asia is
an area of close contact between several major ethnolinguistic groups: the Daic (Tai-Kadai), the Austro-Asiatic (including the Mon Khmer), the Sino-Tibetan
(including Tibeto-Burmans and Han), the Hmong-Mien
(Miao-Yao), the Austronesian and the Altaic. Migration

and assimilation processes formed the genetic landscape
of culturally separated ethnic groups living in the same
geographic area [2-8]. Laos has an unusually high degree
of human diversity [9]: more than 200 ethno-linguistic
groups have been identified [1]. The population pattern
is the result of vast movements in the last 2000 years,
mainly from China to the southern lowlands. The highlands in the North and along the Annamite Cordillera
are inhabited by minorities [2]. Laotian tribes have formerly been classified into three categories based on the
ethno-linguistic family, the customary habitat and the
type of agricultural production: Lao Lum ("lowlander”)
of the Tai-Kadai, Lao Thoeng/Teung/Kang ("mid- or
uplander”) of the Mon Khmer and Lao Sung/Song
("highlander”) of the Sino-Tibetan and the HmongMien. This classification ceased in 1981 due to promotion of unity of the nation and changes in habitat and

agriculture [10]. The number of officially listed tribes
varies: 68 prior to 1975, 47 in 1995 [11]. In 2000, an
ethno-linguistic system of 49 groups was established [1].
In addition, the classification based on language and culture has some difficulties [2,8,10,12]. Genetic data from
Laos are scarce. The great ethnic diversity specifies the
requirements for a population sample. For forensic,
population and phylogenetic purposes, it needs to cover
the lineages that occur as comprehensive as possible.
This is warranted by country-wide sampling. We examine the mtDNA composition of Laos for the first time,
presenting a cross-sectional population sample of 214
individuals from throughout the country that was analyzed according to the highest forensic standards.

Methods
MtDNA samples and DNA extraction

220 blood samples were acquired from volunteers of
both sexes from The Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
Total DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using automated standard protocols [13]. All
donors gave their informed consent. Samples were fully
anonymized. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic’s National Ethics
Committee for Health Research (No.89/NECHR). The
donors’ provinces of birth comprise 15 of the 17 provinces of Laos. Figure 1 shows the number of samples

MtDNA sequence analysis and haplogroup assignment

We generated full mtDNA control region (CR) sequence
data of 220 samples by chain termination sequencing.
All experiments were performed according to the
EMPOP forensic standard procedures to ensure highest
sequence quality and reliable base calling [14]. Contiguous CR sequences were assembled, phylogenetically
aligned [15] and reported with respect to the revised
Cambridge Reference Sequence [16] using Sequencher
V4.8 (Gene Codes Corporation).
We performed partial coding region (codR) sequencing in order to refine the phylogeny of samples that
could not be assigned to a haplogroup more specific
than paragroups M*, N* or C*. For samples of paragroup M*, we examined up to four segments (nps 18202450, nps 4450-5580, nps 8670-9850, nps 11450-12820)
comprising SNPs diagnostic for M haplogroups, haplogroups D, G, and subhaplogroups. Samples of paragroup C* were inspected for their haplogroup C4 and
C7 status by sequencing nps 5820-6660. This fragment
was also used to test for B4 subhaplogroups and D5b1,
where relevant. To detect haplogroups of paragroup N*,
we analyzed nps 4450-5860 and nps 6340-7770. Primer
sequences and experimental conditions were applied as
published before [17]. To scrutinize samples for haplogroups C1c, G3b, L3b or M13, CR sequencing primer
reads were extended upstream to np 15900.
In order to endorse a reference haplogroup nomenclature, we used the comprehensive mtDNA “phylotree”,
release 8 [18], for assigning haplotypes to haplogroups
according to their SNP pattern.

A posteriori data quality control was performed using
the NETWORK software provided on the EMPOP website (http://www.empop.org, 2 nd release) [19,20]. This
program facilitates the inspection of rare or unobserved
substitutions and indels occurring in the dataset that
could represent possible sequence errors [21]. The
resulting HVS-I and HVS-II networks are shown in
Additional file 2 and explained in Additional file 3.
Identical haplotypes (disregarding cytosine insertions
after nps 16193, 309 and 573 and point heteroplasmies)
were inspected for maternal relatedness by typing up to
17 autosomal STR loci using the AmpFℓSTR SGM Plus
PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and the
PowerPlex 16 System (Promega). Five samples were
thereafter removed from the dataset, applying a cutoff

likelihood ratio of 1000 [22]. One sample was excluded
due to contamination.
Population genetic analyses

In order to shed light on the genetic structure and population genetic history of Laos and Southeast Asia, the
Laos sample was compared to surrounding populations.
Both countrywide and ethnic subpopulation samples
from recent literature were compiled [3-7,12,17,23-26].
All sequences were aligned and trimmed to a greatest
common range, cytosine insertions after nps 16193 and
309 were disregarded. We conducted two separate analyses, one comprising a total of 1229 samples from this
study, Northern Thailand [17], Vietnam [23], Hong Kong
[24] and a mixed Han sample [7] with a greatest common
range of nps 16024-16497 and 30-407 (see Table 1),
another comprising Laos and 16 East Asian populations
with a total of 5470 samples (nps 16024-16383) (see
Table 2).
The random match probability for each population
was calculated as sum of squared haplotype frequencies
(disregarding cytosine insertions after nps 16193, 309
and 573). We performed intra- and interpopulation
comparisons: the number of mean pairwise differences
within and between populations, molecular diversity
indices, and an analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA) were calculated using Arlequin (version
3.5.1.2) [27]. Also the corrected numbers of MPD
between populations were determined, i.e. the MPD
between two populations minus the mean number of
MPD contained within these two populations. To give
additional perspective on the genetic relation of the
populations and for a visualization of the AMOVA
results, we performed a correspondence analysis based
on pairwise FST values using PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS
Inc.).

which 141 were unique (66% of the samples) were
detected (disregarding indels around nps 16193, 309 and
573). The most prevalent haplogroups were B5a (12%),
F1a1a (7.5%), C7 and M7b1 (6% each). The most frequent CR haplotypes (five occurrences each) were a B5a
(73-210-263-315.1C-523del-524del-16140-16183C16189-16266A-16519) and a F1a1 haplotype (73-249del263-315.1C-523del-524del-16129-16162-16172-1630416399-16519).
Macrohaplogroup N (including haplogroups A, B, F, N
and R) comprised 57% of the samples in 37 haplogroups. 26% of the samples were assigned to haplogroup B, almost equally to B4 and B5. 26 out of the
27 haplogroup B5 samples were found to be haplogroup
B5a. 22% of the samples belonged to haplogroup F, of
which 79% belonged to F1a and its subhaplogroups.
Macrohaplogroup M (including haplogroups C, D, G
and M) comprised 43% in 27 haplogroups. 32% of the
samples belonged to haplogroup M, distributed among
ten subhaplogroups. 25% of the M samples, however,
remained M*. No maternal west Eurasian or African
admixture was detected.
Figure 2 depicts a phylogenetic tree of all haplogroups
and their absolute frequencies. A haplogroup and frequency list is given in Table 3. The analyzed range, haplotype and haplogroup of every sample are available
from Additional file 4.
Diversity indices of the Laos sample

The power of discrimination by CR was calculated
99.26%, the random match probability 0.74%. The number of mean pairwise differences for full CR was 13.14 ±
5.94. This high number is due to the double origin of
East Asian mtDNA lineages in both macrohaplogroup
M and N.
Point heteroplasmic positions in the Laos sample

Results and Discussion
Haplogroup composition, unique and most common
haplotypes of the Laos sample

The 214 Laotian samples classified into 64 distinct haplogroups [18]. 45% of the samples were assigned to a
terminal twig of the “phylotree”. 171 CR haplotypes, of

Point heteroplasmies at a single CR position were observed
in eight samples. Two of these (16093Y and 152Y) were
the most common point heteroplasmic positions observed
in a dataset of 5015 global samples [28]. One position
(16261Y) was found three times, two positions a single
time (16289R and 16468Y), three heteroplasmic positions

(16086Y, 16179Y, 16271Y) were absent in the 5015 samples. A search in the 10970 sequences (including most of
the 5015) of the EMPOP database (http://www.empop.org,
2nd release) yielded three hits for 16086Y, the latter two
positions remained unobserved. The proportion of CR profiles revealing a heteroplasmic position was 3.7%, in agreement with observations in blood samples from other
populations (1-9.5%) [28].
New insights into the Southeast Asian mtDNA phylogeny

After CR sequencing, a number of Laos samples displayed new SNP motifs within haplogroups B and D
that were found recurrent in other Central, East and
Southeast Asian populations (Thailand, Vietnam, Hong
Kong, Uzbekistan, Japan and the Miao) [17,23,24,29-31].
These findings (see Table 4 and Additional file 5) indicate that the phylogeny of the particular lineages is not
yet fully resolved.

The partial codR sequencing had a great impact on
the phylogenetic resolution of the dataset. It helped to
confirm and exclude haplogroups without or with recurrent CR motifs. In addition, new codR SNP patterns
were detected. The assays applied therefore constitute
valuable time-, cost- and DNA-saving alternatives to
whole mitochondrial genome sequencing for phylogenetic purposes.
The paragroup M* codR sequencing assay was performed on 41 samples. 14 samples were confirmed to
belong to a described M haplogroup, haplogroups D or G.
New, recurrent SNP motifs with matching haplotypes from
Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong and the Philippines
[[17,23,24,32] and P.M. Schneider, personal communication] were revealed by all but two of the remaining M*
samples. Figure 3 shows the novel M lineages found. To
remain with the established nomenclature [18], we
refrained from assigning new haplogroup names. For some

haplotypes, codR SNPs that were not analyzed were
inferred from the known information. This strategy is
widely applied when CR is only sequenced partly [4,5,7],
and in genetic epidemiology ("imputing”).
The recently described haplogroup M71 was diverse in
the Laos sample. Several new sublineages (including the
postulated “M71a1” [32]) could be identified in 23 individuals from Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, China and the
Philippines. Three haplogroup M samples from Laos
and Thailand revealed the SNP pattern 11810-1273216362 indicating haplogroup M61 [33], while other
presumably diagnostic SNPs were not present. These
findings indicate that the Southeast Asian mtDNA phylogeny is far from being resolved and needs more
sequence information for full clarification (see Figure 3).
We inspected the recurrent codR SNPs for their effect on

expected to be silent, adaptive or neutral (by affecting
weakly conserved amino acids or causing substitutions by
similar amino acids, as encountered here) [34]. This finding

could be another indication of a true phylogenetic meaning
of the new basal haplogroup M codR SNP patterns that we
found in multiple samples from several populations.
Haplogroup composition of Laos compared to
surrounding populations

The Laos sample showed mtDNA diversity characteristic
of Southeast Asian populations. The composition of haplogroups was in agreement with other populations from
this region [3-7,12,17,23-25,35], with haplogroups B4a,
B5a, M7b1, F1a and R9 being the most frequent southern
aboriginal lineages. The ample haplogroup pattern may
reflect the rich history of migrations of ethnic groups in
today’s Laos. Aside from a few haplogroups with high
sample numbers, a plethora was present at very low frequencies. The five most prevalent haplogroups together
comprised 37% of the samples (see Table 3).
In Laos, haplogroups B4a and R9 were less frequent
than expected from the literature. This is partly
explained by “technical” reasons: samples assigned to
haplogroup “R9a” by HVS-I-motifs [4,12] actually belong
to F3a (R9a is discontinued). Nevertheless, there was
only one F3a sample in the Laos dataset. Earlier publications considered B4g haplotypes as B4a due to their
common root [3,5,7,12,23,35]. B4g, not B4a is the most
prevalent B4 haplogroup in Laos.

Little Northern contribution was detected. The presence of haplogroups described as Northern (East)
Asian [4,6,7,25,36], i.e. A, Z, Y, C, M8a, M9, G2, D and
N9, was low in the Laos dataset. Haplogroups G, M8
and A were present as singletons, Y and Z were absent.
Haplogroup C, in contrast, showed an unexpectedly
high frequency of 6%, but very limited diversity: all haplotypes belonged to haplogroup C7. Interestingly, 12 of
the 13 samples derive from Northern provinces (see
Additional file 1). Together with the singular presence
of haplogroup M8, this is indicative of a founder effect possibly the immigration of a small group of females
carrying the C7 haplogroup from its Northern pool.
Genetic comparisons with four East Asian populations
(HVS-I and HVS-II)

We compared the genetic composition of the current
sample to that of populations from Thailand [17], Vietnam [23], Hong Kong [24] and mixed Han from China
and Taiwan [7] with the greatest common range of nps
16024-16497 and 30-407. The total number of samples
was 1229 (see Table 1).
The numbers of intrapopulation MPD were highly similar. The highest intrapopulation diversity was found in the
mixed Han sample (10.96) followed by Laos (10.93); the
lowest in Vietnam (10.62). The intrapopulation RMP

Bodner et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:49
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/49

ranged between 0.004 (Han) and 0.011 (Thailand) indicating that the populations were highly differentiated. Laos
was intermediate with a value of 0.008 (see Table 1). Interpopulation MPD ranged from 10.68 (Vietnam-Hong
Kong) to 11.18 (Laos-Han), the corrected values from 0
(Laos-Vietnam) to 0.23 (Laos-Han). The low and similar
values indicate similar genetic structures of the populations. The corrected and uncorrected results corresponded, as population pairs ranked low, medium or high
in both calculations (see Additional file 6).
All populations shared haplotypes to varying extents.
47 haplotypes (28%) of the Laos sample were found in
the other populations. Thailand was at the top (16%
shared haplotypes) followed by Vietnam (12%) and
Hong Kong (8%). The mixed Han sample only shared
3% of its haplotypes with Laos and its most frequent
shared haplotype was only a singleton in the Laos sample (see Additional file 7).
AMOVA was used to test for significant variation in
the mtDNA genetic structure among the populations.
Almost all genetic variation observed is attributable to
differences within populations (99.16%). Variance among
populations only accounts for 0.84%. The AMOVA
results were statistically significant (see Additional file 6).
The low and similar pairwise F ST values possibly
reflect the common origin of the populations and little
evolutionary time since their differentiation. However,
the small genetic variance detected was significant for
almost all comparisons. No significant difference in
genetic structure was found between the Laos and the
Vietnam population sample, which may indicate extensive gene flow by migration between the two countries
(see Additional file 6).
Genetic comparisons with 16 East Asian populations
(HVS-I)

To shed more light on the genetic structure of the Laos
sample, we performed analogous analyses including a
greater number of East Asian populations [3-7,12,17,23-26]
with a shorter segment (nps 16024-16383). The total number of samples was 5470 from 17 populations (see Table 2).
The numbers of intrapopulation MPD ranged from
6.27 to 7.92. The highest intrapopulation diversity was
found in the Pinghua Han [12] (confirming their genetically heterogeneous background), the lowest in the
Hmong [5]. Laos was third highest (7.69). The intrapopulation RMP ranged from 0.005 (Southern Han [6]) to
0.023 (Austro-Asiatic [3]) indicating highly differentiated
populations. Laos was intermediate at 0.012 (see Table 2).
The interpopulation MPD spanned from 6.47 (Hmong
[5]-Daic [3]) to 7.90 (Southern Tibeto-Burmans [4]Pinghua Han [12]), the corrected values from 0 (even
arithmetical values below zero) for several comparisons
to 0.74 (Laos-Tibet [4]). The range of values was greater

Page 8 of 12

than for the analyses using a longer segment (see previous section), revealing a greater population differentiation. This was expected given the broader geographic
origin of populations included. Tibet, being a population
at far geographic distance, had the highest numbers of
MPD with all of the samples but the other Northern
sample (Northern Han [6]), an effect that was only visible after correction (see Additional file 8).
The order of the populations in the MPD and RMP
analyses was different when only HVS-I was analyzed
(see previous section), which demonstrates the impact
of larger reading frames. It can be supposed that the
results of analyses with more information included are
closer to truth.
All populations shared haplotypes with the Laos sample. 46% of the Laos haplotypes were found in other
populations. This high percentage is due to the short
mtDNA segment and the high number of populations
involved. The geographically closer populations, i.e. Thailand [17], Hong Kong [24], the Southern Indigenous
Minorities [12], Pinghua Han [12], Guangdong Han [25],
Vietnam [23], Hmong and Mien [5] and the AustroAsiatic [3] tended to share higher proportions (13-30%)
than the Southern Tibeto-Burmans and Tibet [4], Daic
[3], the mixed Han samples [6,7] and the sample from
Island Southeast Asia [26] (3-9%) (see Additional file 7).
AMOVA again showed that the observed genetic variation was mainly attributable to differences within
populations (98.09%). Variance among populations
accounted for 1.91% (see Additional file 8). The
AMOVA results were statistically significant.
Mainly low, but also some intermediate F ST values
resulted from the pairwise comparisons, indicating limited genetic differentiation between the populations (as
in the previous section). All intermediate F ST values
were yielded in comparisons including the Tibet [4] or
the Northern Han [6] sample, and comparisons with
these two population samples resulted in the highest
pairwise FST values for most other groups. The outlier
position of the two Northern samples detected in several
genetic comparisons supports the concept of isolation
by geographic distance with subsequent differentiation.
Most differences in genetic structure were highly significant. Only the mixed Han sample [7] and the Pinghua
Han [12] with multi-ethnic origin showed no significant
difference in several comparisons, along with the Laos
sample when compared to the Vietnam sample [23], as
shown in the previous section (see Additional file 8).
An MDS plot for visualization of the AMOVA results
is depicted in Figure 4. The positioning of the samples
did not change when nonsignificant F ST values (see
Additional file 8) were excluded. In this correspondence
analysis, the population sample from Laos clustered
with the samples from Vietnam [23] and Thailand [17]

and the Southern Indigenous Minorities [12]. This
might be explained by the fact that these four samples
do not represent ethnic entities, but are a similar combination of several groups. The partly shared political history of the three neighboring countries could have
facilitated migrations.
The other populations appeared more distant from the
Laos sample: the Austro-Asiatic [3] and the cluster of
the Guangdong Han [25], Pinghua Han [12] and the
sample from Hong Kong [24] were closer, the cluster of
Southern Han [6], Mixed Han [7] and Southern TibetoBurmans [4] at an intermediate distance, while the
remaining groups, i.e. the Hmong and Mien [5], the
Daic [3], the Northern samples (Northern Han [6],
Tibet [4]) as well as the Island Southeast Asians [26]
localized further away.
Obviously, the Han population samples did not cluster in
the correspondence analysis. Although assigned to the same
nationality, they are distant from each other genetically. The
mixed Han [7] localized between the Northern and Southern Han [6] - as expected near their sister Sino-Tibetan
branch, the Southern Tibeto-Burman sample [4] - while the
Pinghua [12] and the Guangdong [25] Han samples with
minority background and the sample from Hong Kong [24]
clustered between the other Southeast Asian populations
rather than with the other Han samples. This reflects the
process of assimilation of indigenous populations along
with the Han expansion [12,25] and the particular genetic

composition of Hong Kong [24] possibly caused by a history distinct from the rest of today’s China. Our findings
further point out the importance of subdatasets even for
large ethnic groups, as reported before [6,7]. It was also
meaningful to separate the Hmong and Mien population
samples [5], that are usually combined based on linguistics,
as they differ genetically (see Figure 4).
Understanding the genetic history of Laos

The rapid initial colonization of Southeast Asia at some
time after 60 kYBP along the “Southern Coastal Route”
was followed by an expansion in situ (while other
groups moved on), a dispersal into the continent and
onto the islands, and the subsequent differentiation of
ethnic groups with common origin but diverging
lineages (most of which arose during the last stadial of
the Würm glacial, 30-10 kYBP, probably in different
refugia) [3,7,26,37,38]. We confirmed this in our analyses: the novel basal M haplogroups found in high
diversity in the Laos sample and surrounding populations support the fast migration and in situ differentiation model (see Figure 3). Despite of little evolutionary
time, the linguistically separated groups also clearly differed genetically (see Figure 4).
The original genetic structure of MSEA with distinct
areas inhabited by the main ethnic groups - the Daic in
the coastal areas of the Southeast, the Austro-Asiatic in
Western and central MSEA, the Sino-Tibetan (Tibeto-

Bodner et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:49
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/49

Burmans and Han) in the North and the Hmong-Mien in
today’s central China - has been blurred by massive
migrations [3,7]. In the past 2600 years, the TibetoBurmans moved from the Northwest and the Himalayan
area to the South, absorbing indigenous lineages [4]. In
the past 2000 years, several waves of Han expansions to
the West and South caused massive displacements of
indigenous minorities [3,4,6,7]. The Daic were forced
southward by the expanding Han in a fanning spread and
are now mainly found west of Hong Kong. In today’s
Laos, they formed small city states in the North from the
late 11th century AD and later moved to the central and
Southern plains, thereby repelling the Austro-Asiatic
population to the highlands or assimilating them. Today,
the Daic “lowlander” living in the plains and along the
rivers constitute the major proportion (60-65%) of the
Laos population. They are dominant in language, culture,
media and politics [1-3,6,10,39]. The Hmong-Mien are
the newest arrival: they were continuously forced to the
Southwestern areas already settled by Austro-Asiatic and
Southern Tibeto-Burmans. They immigrated to the hilly
North of Laos only in the past several hundred years and
today exhibit a pattern of refuge ("highlander”), rather
than a positive expansion [2,5,8].
Traces of these migrations might be visible in the
extant mtDNA composition of Laos. To shed more light
on the population genetic history, it was meaningful to
compare the cross-sectional Laos sample to those of the
ethnic groups that together constitute the population of
this country.
An interesting picture was revealed (see Additional
Files 6, 7 and 8, Figure 4): the ethnic population with the
highest similarity to the Laos sample in terms of shared
haplotypes, MPD, pairwise FST values and localization in
the MDS plot were the Austro-Asiatic [3]. This was
unexpected, as the “midlander” only constitute 20-25% of
the Laotian population, being the major group only in
some regions [10,39]. Given the fact that the Daic sample
[3] localized at much further distance from the Laos sample in the correspondence analysis (see Figure 4), had a
higher corrected MPD value and less shared haplotypes,
our findings indicate a great proportion of assimilated
Austro-Asiatic lineages in the Daic-dominated Laos.
The ethnic samples second closest to the Laos sample
in the MDS plot were the three “highlander” Southern
Sino-Tibetan groups (Southern Tibeto-Burmans [4],
Southern [6] and Mixed Han [7]), while other “highlander”, the Hmong and Mien [5], appeared far from the
Laos sample. This might reflect expanding Sino-Tibetan
tribes immigrating from the Northwest of MSEA, and is
in agreement with the reported migration routes (see
above). Both in the shared haplotypes analysis (see
Additional File 7) and the MDS plot (see Figure 4),
there was only small evidence for admixture by

Page 10 of 12

Northern Sino-Tibetan groups (Tibet [4] and North
Han [6]), suggesting that these migrations were minor
concerning the area of today’s Laos or blurred by the
admixture by indigenous females to immigrating Northern groups (as reported for the Southern Han [6]). Specific, but limited Northern traces were found in the
Laos sample, however (haplogroups D, M8 and C7, see
above).

Conclusion
The cross-sectional Laotian sample presented here is
highly suitable for genetic purposes regarding the countrywide mtDNA variation. Subpopulation and regional
databases for detailed population genetic investigations
and reliable forensic frequency estimates are desirable
and need more extensive sampling. New phylogenetic
lineages were detected: this sample will significantly
contribute to further clarification of the Southeast Asian
mtDNA phylogeny and the development of region specific filters for NETWORK constructions [19,20]. The limited codR sequence analysis considerably increased
phylogenetic resolution, suggesting that complete mitochondrial genome sequencing and analyzing a greater
number of samples and populations will help to identify
additional new lineages, yielding a more realistic picture
of human mtDNA diversity, dispersal history and a
higher power of discrimination for forensic purposes.
This first Laos dataset reveals a highly diverse population in terms of mtDNA composition, possibly reflecting
the contribution of several major ethnolinguistic groups
and a complex migration history. The Laotian population
sample showed to be highly differentiated and lies well
amid other Southeast Asian populations in terms of haplogroup structure, diversity indices and sharing of haplotypes. Nevertheless, its genetic structure was significantly
different from 15 East Asian groups included in the comparisons. Our sample gives strong indication for a mixed
Southeast Asian aboriginal origin of the extant Laos
population along with limited Northern East Asian contributions, with highest similarity to Austro-Asiatic and
Southern Sino-Tibetan populations. This finding was
unexpected, as the Daic are culturally dominant in Laos,
but is in agreement with the ethnic divisions of Southeast
Asia before the Han expansions, where the Austro-Asiatic lived in this central area of today’s Laos [3]. However,
this mtDNA study reflecting the maternal history of Laos
is only one piece of the puzzle. Y-chromosomal and autosomal markers will allow further, and possibly contrary,
insights into the complex migration and population history of Laos and Southeast Asia [40,41].
The haplotypes presented in this study will be available
on the EMPOP database http://www.empop.org [EMPOP:
EMP00083] and on GenBank [GenBank:HM852213HM852426] upon publication. This publication follows
