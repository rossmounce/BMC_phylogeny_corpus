Abstract
The neurotophin signaling network is critical to the development and survival of many neuronal
populations. Especially sensitive to imbalances in the neurotrophin system, cholinergic neurons in
the basal forebrain are progressively lost in Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic use of neurotrophins
to prevent this loss is hampered, however, by a number of pharmacological challenges. These
include a lack of transport across the blood-brain barrier, rapid degradation in the circulation, and
difficulty in production. In this review we discuss the evidence supporting the neurotrophin
system's role in preventing neurodegeneration and survey some of the pharmacological strategies
being pursued to develop effective therapeutics targeting neurotrophin function.

Background
The neurotrophins and their receptors
Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin discovered and is the prototypical member of a family of
structurally related proteins including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, and NT-4/
5. Neurotrophins have been identified in many vertebrate
lineages, including reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and
mammals [1]. Not all neurotrophins have been found in
all species; NT-4/5 has not been found in chicken and NT6 and -7 are found only in fish. More distantly related
genes have been found in the Agnatha species lamprey and
hagfish. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that NGF and NT3 form a subfamily as do BDNF and NT-4/5. The neurotrophins bind two classes of receptor, the common
p75NTR, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor

receptor family [2,3], and the tropomyosin-related kinase
(Trk) receptors, members of the large tyrosine kinase
receptor family [4]. Three Trk receptors have been identified in vertebrates, and more distantly related receptors
have been found in lamprey and amphioxus. TrkA and
TrkC form a distinct phylogenetic subfamily [1]. All neurotrophins bind p75NTR with similar affinity (Kd~10-9
M), but binding to the Trk receptors is more selective.
NGF binds the TrkA receptor, BDNF and NT-4/5 bind the
TrkB receptor, and NT-3 primarily binds the TrkC receptor
[5]. These binding specificities are consistent with the
phylogenetic separation into distinct subfamilies. NT-6
and -7 are more closely related to NGF than the other neurotrophins and bind TrkA [1]. The common p75NTR also
enhances binding of NGF to TrkA receptors to create high
affinity binding sites (Kd~10-11 M), possibly by binding to

different surfaces on the NGF dimer [6]. p75NTR can also
bind precursor forms of the neurotrophins. For example,
pro-NGF does not bind TrkA, but causes cell death by
binding to p75NTR [7,8].
These neurotrophins function to support the growth and
survival of many neuronal populations [5,9-11]. NGFdeficient mice die shortly after birth and show a decrease
in sensory and sympathetic neurons, but basal forebrain
cholinergic neurons develop relatively normally. However, this perinatal lethality can be rescued by transgenic
expression of NGF under the K14 keratin promoter, which
restores the sensory and sympathetic neuronal populations [12]. These rescued mice exhibit reduced cholinergic
innervation in the cortex and hippocampus, but this can
be restored by intracerebroventricular delivery of NGF
[13]. Disruption of a single NGF allele causes deficits in
memory acquisition and hippocampal cholinergic innervation, suggesting that NGF is required for the formation
and maintenance of correct innervations [14]. BDNF-deficient mice also die shortly after birth due to defects in
brain and sensory, but not motor, neuron development
[15]. Long-term potentiation and mechanosensation are
impaired in heterozygous BDNF knockout animals
[16,17]. NT-3 deficient mice show severe movement
defects and die shortly after birth with complete absence
of spinal proprioceptive afferents [18]. The number of
muscle spindles was reduced in heterozygous NT-3
knockout mice. NT-3 deficiency also causes a decrease in
the number of sympathetic cervical ganglion neurons, lingual innervations, and sensory neuron precursor cells
[19,20].
The three Trk receptors show distinct patterns of expression throughout the mammlian brain and peripheral
nervous system [4,21-24]. TrkA is expressed exclusively by
cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. TrkB and TrkC
are highly expressed in the hippocampus. In the peripheral nervous system, these receptors are expressed on overlapping sets of sensory and motor neurons. None of the
Trk receptors are essential for embryonic development
and knockout mice are born in the expected ratios. However, the mice fail to thrive and die shortly after birth.
TrkA-deficient mice show a marked loss of cholinergic
neurons in the forebrain and sensory and sympathetic
neurons in the trigeminal, superior cervical, and dorsal
root ganglia [25-28]. Mice lacking TrkB show decreased
synaptogenesis and mossy fiber maturation in the hippocampus, as well as severe sensory deficits in the vestibular
and cochlear ganglia [29-31]. TrkC-deficient mice also
show decreased hippocampal synaptogenesis and display
abnormal movements due to loss of proprioception and
muscle afferents [30-32]. Heterozygosity for a trk allele
permits survival, but structural alterations are apparent in
aged mice [14,33,34]. TrkC is also expressed on non-neu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/S2/S1

ronal cells and supports glial development [35]. Multiple
alternatively spliced isoforms have been observed for
TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, especially in non-neuronal cells
[36-39]. Some of these isoforms lack the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, but retain selective signaling and may
inhibit neurite outgrowth [37,40,41].
Due to their ability to protect multiple neuronal cell types
from apoptosis, there is considerable interest in whether
neurotrophins can stimulate neuronal regeneration in
vitro and in model systems [42-45]. If neurotrophins can
prevent or reverse neuronal cell loss, they would make
good therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases,
and in brain or spinal cord injuries [46,47]. One complication, however, is that neurotrophins also bind to
p75NTR. Activation of this receptor may cause cell death
rather than survival, as p75NTR-/- mice show reductions
in neuronal cell death after pilocarpine-induced seizures
compared to wild-type [48,49]. Therefore, the final effect
of a neurotrophin is a balance between the cell survival
signal derived from the Trk receptor family and the cell
death signal from p75NTR. Indeed, neurotrophins cause
cell death in approximately 30% of cultured hippocampal
neurons expressing p75, but which lack the cognate Trk
receptor, potentially limiting the therapeutic utility of the
neurotrophins themselves [50].
Neurotrophins, Trks, and neurodegeneration
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most severely
affected systems is the cholinergic neurons projecting
from the basal forebrain to the neocortex. There is a strong
correlation between the loss of these cholinergic neurons
and the loss of memory [51]. Cholinesterase inhibitors
can prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine that results in
the partial restoration of memory and decreased confusion, but despite this initial improvement, as more
cholinergic neurons are lost, there is a continual, gradual
loss of function. Many reports have documented the ability of NGF to improve cholinergic function in vitro and to
prevent lesion-induced degeneration in rodents and primates, as well as age-associated declines in rats and primates [46,50,51]. NGF is expressed in a number of cell
types in the brain, including astrocytes, but not in microglia or oligodendrocytes [52]. Correlative studies have
found defects in the NGF system in early stages of AD that
may indicate a causative role. NGF mRNA levels are not
altered in AD. Total NGF protein is relatively normal, but
the ratio of proNGF to mature NGF is increased [53,54].
TrkA expression is reduced, but p75NTR amounts are
unchanged in AD [55,56]. The reduction in TrkA suggests
a relative deficit in NGF signaling, as NGF positively regulates trkA gene expression. proNGF may increase apoptotic signaling via p75NTR, altering the balance between
neuronal survival and death. The importance of NGF is
underscored by studies in a transgenic model of neurode-

generation. Mice expressing blocking antibodies to NGF,
specifically in the adult brain, showed reduced cholinergic
innervations of the cortex and impairments in synaptic
plasticity [57]. Similarly, short-term neonatal administration of anti-NGF antibodies by intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) injection in mice leads to altered exploratory
behavior on a hole board [58]. BDNF may play an important role too. In AD, not only are BDNF mRNA and protein levels decreased in basal forebrain, cholinergic
neuron target tissues – for example, cortex and hippocampus [59] – but local levels of BDNF in the nucleus basalis
are reduced [60]. Hippocampal BDNF levels are increased
by exercise, thought to delay decline in patients with AD
[61]. Adenoviral expression of BDNF enhances neuronal
plasticity, increases long-term potentiation formation,
and improves performance on behavioral tests in a rat
model with cognitive deficits [62]. NT-3 levels in the
motor cortex are also lower in AD patients than controls
[63], but other regions appear unaltered [64,65]. Furthermore, the receptors TrkB and TrkC are decreased in
cholinergic basal forebrain neurons in AD [55].

[78,79]. To test this idea in a transgenic model, Pettigrew
et al. [80] expressed NGF throughout the brain under control of the GFAP promoter. Neurons grafted into the transgenic animals showed extensive parallel axonal
regeneration extending beyond the astroglitic scar, demonstrating that gradients are not needed for parallel fiber
growth, and that global expression of NGF is beneficial.
BDNF is required for sprouting of hippocampal CA3
pyramidal cell axons, and either BDNF or NT-3 supports
engraftment of CA3 cells in kainite-lesioned rats [81,82].
NT-4/5 can also increase CA2/3 cell survival following
fluid percussion injury, but did not improve performance
on behavior tests [83]. The beneficial effects of neurotrophins may not be limited to neuronal survival, as
BDNF reduces blood-spinal cord barrier permeability following spinal cord injury, and reduces leakage of serum
proteins [84]. BDNF, and its receptor TrkB, are also
required for the anti-depressant effect of imipramine and
fluoxetine in rodent models, suggesting that neurotrophin
therapy may also have beneficial effects in post-traumatic
stress and other depressive disorders [85,86].

Neurotrophins may also be a promising therapy for neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury. In a study of 14
children with severe traumatic brain injury, NGF levels in
the cerebrospinal fluid were normal 2 hours post trauma,
but increased 5-fold at 24 hours post trauma [66]. In contrast, BDNF levels were elevated >25-fold 2 hours post
trauma, but decreased to 3-fold of normal at 24 hours.
Higher NGF levels at 24 hours post-trauma correlated
with better clinical outcome. These elevations in neurotrophins have also been seen in rodent models of brain
injury and are thought to be a protective mechanism to
minimize neuronal loss [67-69]. Kainate-induced injury
increases BDNF and NGF levels in the hippocampus of
Fisher 344 rats [69]. The increase in BDNF was diminished in aged rats, suggesting reduced spontaneous healing with aging [70,71]. Cortical and hippocampal NT-4/5
levels are elevated in rats subjected to a lateral fluid percussion injury, and NT-4/5 knockout mice showed more
extensive Cornu Ammonis (CA) pyramidal cell loss and
showed impaired motor recovery compared to wild-type
mice Prolonged infusion of NT-4/5 prevented 50% of the
pyramidal cell loss. In another study, BDNF and NT-3
were elevated in the rat thalamus following percussive
brain injury [68]. Glucocorticoids are often prescribed following brain injury. Administration of dexamethasone, a
synthetic glucocorticoid, elevates brain levels of NGF,
BDNF, and NT-3 following injury [73-76]. Adrenalectomy
prevents the trauma-induced increase in NGF, underscoring the essential role of endogenous glucocorticoids in
inducing the protective neurotrophins [77]. NGF infusion
promotes local axonal regeneration in spinal cord injury,
but does not extend beyond the site of infusion, which led
to the suggestion that neurotrophin gradients are required

Neurotrophin therapy
In preclinical and clinical findings, neurotrophins are
thought to be a promising therapy for peripheral neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [87]
and Parkinson's disease [88]. However, neurotrophins do
not make good drug candidates due to their poor pharmacokinetic behavior and bioavailability at the desired targets. One of the major hurdles for neurotrophin therapy is
the lack of passage of peptide hormones across the bloodbrain barrier [89,90]. Peripheral administration of peptide hormones only leads to a small increase in their intracerebral concentration. This has necessitated complicated
methods of delivery, such as via the olfactory neural pathway [91-93], ex vivo gene therapy by intracranial injection
of NGF-expressing fibroblasts [94], or placement of indwelling catheters to allow neurotrophin infusion. Intranasal administration of NGF rescues memory defects in a
mouse model of AD [95]. Preliminary trials of i.c.v. infusion of recombinant mNGF for 3 months have shown
some benefit in small numbers of AD patients [96]. Ex vivo
gene therapy using the patients' own fibroblasts infected
with a retrovirus to express human NGF is currently being
tested in phase I trials, but recent problems associated
with gene therapy make it unlikely that such an approach
will succeed in the near future [94].
As a result, considerable effort has been devoted to finding
neurotrophin peptidomimetics. These are small molecules that mimic the binding of selective peptides and
elicit the desired neuroregenerative responses of neurotrophins. Much of this work is driven by the crystal structures of the neurotrophins and their receptors, and
structure-function studies of small peptides [97,98]. NGF

contacts the TrkA receptor through residues in β-hairpin
loops 2 and 4, and residues in the amino- and carboxyl
termini. A dimeric, cyclized peptide derived from loop 4
activates TrkA and has NGF-like neurotrophic effects [99].
Other β-turn mimetics have also been developed and
optimized for neurotrophic activities in vitro [100,101].
NGF contacts p75NTR through residues in loop 1 and
peptidomimetics have been developed that block the
binding of NGF, preventing apoptotic cell death driven by
proNGF activation of p75NTR [102]. Taking a slightly different approach, small peptides have also been developed
that prevent the association of the Trk receptors with cellular tyrosine phosphatases. Treatment of PC12 cells with
a cell-permeable version of the leukocyte common antigen receptor (a tyrosine phosphatase), expressed in neurons, causes neurite outgrowth in a TrkA-dependent
manner, presumably by preventing de-phosphorylation
of TrkA [103]. A peptidomimetic, cerebrolysin (N-PEP12) from Ebewe Pharma, is showing promise in phase II
clinical trials [104].

Small molecule, non-peptide neurotrophic
factors
The development of small molecules promoting neurotrophic function has been recently reviewed [105]. These
are small molecules that can alter neurotrophin function
in a manner independent of ligand binding to receptor.
The mechanisms can be varied. Some agents modulate the
expression of the neurotrophins themselves, while others
act by enhancing neurotrophin action. In the former class,
a purine-hypoxanthine derivative, leteprinim (Neotrofin), has been shown to elevate neurotrophin levels
(including NGF) in animals, and caused increases in acetylcholinesterase labeling in lesioned rats [106]. In
humans with mild-to-moderate AD, this molecule
improved cognitive scores in memory, executive function,
and attention tests [107]. It also increased metabolic rate
especially in the cerebellum, and sensory and prefrontal
cortices. Leteprinim showed promise in a phase II clinical
trial for the treatment of AD but is now being developed
for peripheral neuropathy. Similarly, retinoids, AMPA
(alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid) receptor agonists, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, serotonin/norepiephrine reuptake inhibitors,
and tricylic antidepressants all increase neurotrophin
expression [105].
As for the agents acting by enhancing neurotrophin
action, xaliproden is a combined NGF potentiator and
serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist that also reduces chemotherapy-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy but has
yet to show efficacy in cognitive decline in AD. Its ability
to enhance NGF action in vitro is mimicked by tyrosine
kinase inhibitors [108]. This is reminiscent of the
enhancement of NGF action by inhibitors of mixed-line-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/S2/S1

age kinases (MLKs), for example, K252a, CEP1347,
BMS355249, or L-753,000 [109-112]. For many years,
K252a was thought to be a weak TrkA inhibitor, but was
subsequently shown to be a potent inhibitor of the MLKs.
More specific MLK inhibitors that lack the TrkA inhibitory
activity can still enhance neurotrophin action. Nitric
oxide donors also contribute to neuronal survival through
transactivation of TrkA [113-115]. The protective effect
requires cyclic GMP and protein kinase G, but the downstream target is not known. Activation of G-protein coupled receptors by adenosine, or pituitary adenylate cyclase
activating peptide (PACAP), also leads to transactivation
of TrkA, stimulation of downstream signaling, and neuroprotection [116,117]. These effects may be related to the
known redox regulation of TrkA. Antioxidants, such as Nacetylcysteine, blocks NGF-induced neuronal differentiation, whereas buthionine sulfoximine, which reduces cellular
glutathione
levels,
enhances
neuronal
differentiation [118].
Other studies have focused on small molecule, direct activators of the TrkA receptor. A cell-based chemical genetic
screen for compounds that can protect SN56 neuroblastoma cells against apoptosis in a TrkA-dependent manner
identified gambogic amide as a selective agonist for TrkA
[119]. Gambogic amide is the major active ingredient of
gamboge, a traditional Chinese medicine. This compound binds TrkA, but not TrkB or TrkC, and causes receptor dimerization and phosphorylation. Gambogic amide
stimulates neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, reduces neuronal cell death in a kainate-induced seizure model, and
reduces infarct volume in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model [119].
Our studies have focused on the asterriquinone class of
compounds. The asterriquinones are naturally occurring
bis-indolyl-dihydroxyquinones that were originally identified as activators of the insulin receptor [120,121]. The
molecules are small and readily cell-permeable, and act
directly on the receptor tyrosine kinase domain, although
its mechanism of activation is not known. The original
compound, demethylasterriquinone-B1 (DAQ-B1), was
demonstrated to cross the blood-brain barrier and activate
hypothalamic signaling when given orally [122]. Therefore, we hypothesized that similar compounds could
potentially activate signaling in the central nervous system
and be used as oral NGF activators for neurotrophin therapy. These compounds would have the very important
additional advantage of targeting the kinase domain of
TrkA and therefore not activating the p75NTR receptor. To
facilitate identification of TrkA activators, we developed a
combinatorial library of structurally related asterriquinones and screened them against TrkA [123]. Out of 334
asterriquinones screened, we identified 35 that had agonist activity >50% that of NGF. Dose-dependent toxicity

was also measured for this library and TrkA activation and
toxicity were modeled mathematically using quantitative
structure activity relationship (QSAR) models. There was
no correlation between activation of TrkA and cellular viability, suggesting that toxicity is not dependent on agonist
activity. Based on the library screen, we picked compound
5E5 for further evaluation. This compound is a potent
activator of TrkA (200% the activity of NGF) and a partial
activator of TrkC (80% the activity of NT-3), but does not
appreciably stimulate TrkB or the insulin receptor. Interestingly, this compound has additive effects with NGF and
at low doses is able to potentiate the effect of NGF to activate TrkA and downstream signaling. 5E5 enhances neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells
in the presence of a low dose of NGF that alone is inefficient at promoting neurite outgrowth.

Conclusion
Progress continues in the development of strategies for
neuroprotection in AD. Both the central role for neurotrophins in mediating neuronal survival, and the positive
effects using recombinant NGF or peptidomimetics in
small clinical trials, suggest that the neurotrophin system
would be a good therapeutic target in AD. Multiple
approaches are being pursued, though many have their
limitations. Peptidomimetics offer greater specificity, but
are less readily delivered. Small molecule neurotrophin
mimetics are easily delivered, but less selective, and may
have non-Trk-mediated side effects. In the end, molecules
potentiating the effect of endogenous neurotrophins are
particularly appealing as this may avoid the potential
complications of systemic neurotrophin stimulation. In
this way, neurotrophin action would only be enhanced
where endogenous neurotrophins are found. Many of
these studies establish proof-of-principle, and it is hoped
that they will spur development of second and third generation therapeutics with better selectivity and potency.
