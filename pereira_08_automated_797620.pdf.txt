Abstract
Background: Dispersed repeats are a major component of eukaryotic genomes and drivers of
genome evolution. Annotation of DNA sequences homologous to known repetitive elements has
been mainly performed with the program REPEATMASKER. Sequences annotated by REPEATMASKER
often correspond to fragments of repetitive elements resulting from the insertion of younger
elements or other rearrangements. Although REPEATMASKER annotation is indispensable for
studying genome biology, this annotation does not contain much information on the common
origin of fossil fragments that share an insertion event, especially where clusters of nested
insertions of repetitive elements have occurred.
Results: Here I present REANNOTATE, a computational tool to process REPEATMASKER annotation
for automated i) defragmentation of dispersed repetitive elements, ii) resolution of the temporal
order of insertions in clusters of nested elements, and iii) estimating the age of the elements, if they
have long terminal repeats. I have re-annotated the repetitive content of human chromosomes,
providing evidence for a recent expansion of satellite repeats on the Y chromosome and, from the
retroviral age distribution, for a higher rate of evolution on the Y relative to autosomes.
Conclusion: REANNOTATE is ready to process existing annotation for automated evolutionary
analysis of all types of complex repeats in any genome. The tool is freely available under the GPL
at http://www.bioinformatics.org/reannotate.

Background
Repeats of high sequence complexity – mostly transposable elements (TEs) – account for a large portion of many
eukaryotic genomes. In humans they comprise almost
half of the (cytologically euchromatic) genome [1], and in
some plants (e.g. maize) most of the DNA (>70%) is
repetitive [2-4]. In addition to genome size evolution,
repetitive sequences are fundamentally implicated in
structural and functional genome evolution. Sequence
similarity and complementarity form the basis of many
biochemical reactions involving nucleic acids. Hence the
occurrence of repeated sequences may mediate genome,

epigenome and transcriptome interactions, such as chromosomal rearrangements [5-7], centromere [8] and telomere [9] function, and chromatin remodelling and gene
silencing mediated by repeat-induced small RNAs [1015]. In addition to the effects of sequence repetition, TE
insertions may have sequence-specific phenotypic consequences. For instance, they encode regulatory signals that
can potentially affect gene expression [16-19].
Given the importance of repetitive DNA sequences for
genome structure and evolution, systematic annotation of
repeats is essential for inferring biological organisation

and function from genomic sequences. When large
amounts of sequence data are analysed, automation of the
annotation procedure is indispensable. REPEATMASKER[20] has become the default computational tool for
automated repeat annotation. Despite the current indispensability and efficiency of REPEATMASKER in annotating
genomic regions similar to known families of repeats, the
REPEATMASKER annotation contains relatively little information on the origin and evolution of repeats. For example, if a given TE insertion is subsequently targeted by
further insertions, the original TE sequence will be interrupted and fragmented by sequences of later origin. In
such a situation REPEATMASKER may annotate multiple
sequence similarity hits to the given TE family without
establishing the common origin of these sequences [2124], and no information on the temporal order of insertion of overlapping repetitive elements is obtained without human analysis. This situation is common as TEs are
non-randomly distributed within genomes and are often
'nested', i.e. inserted into another TE. Nesting has been
observed in diverse genomes across the eukaryotic kingdom [10,24-32]. Thus, post-processing is necessary to
improve the biological interpretation of REPEATMASKER
annotations (reviewed in ref. [33]).
Here I describe REANNOTATE (Repetitive Element re-annotation), a computational tool for automated defragmentation and evolutionary analysis of (high complexity)
repetitive DNA elements (mainly TEs). The term re-annotation reflects the use of REPEATMASKER annotation as input
to REANNOTATE, and in this context it means neither the
prediction of previously unannotated sequence features
(similarity hits) nor the detection of false positives in the
original annotation. Rather, it means adding "layers" of
information that contain new kinds of inferences not
present in the original annotation. REANNOTATE automatically generates up to three layers of re-annotation: i)
defragmentation, via construction of repetitive element
"models" consisting of sequence features originally annotated as separate similarity hits; ii) order of insertion, where
TE models constructed in (i) overlap; and iii) age, for long
terminal repeat (LTR)-elements in particular (dating of
their insertion events is performed for structurally complete elements). In addition to annotation, REANNOTATE
can output the sequences of defragmented repetitive element models, with appropriate gaps so that elements classified in a given family are all pairwise aligned to the
family reference sequence; in this form they can easily be
multiply aligned (which would be non-trivial with
ungapped sequences if they have large indels relative to
one another) and are ready for phylogenetic analysis.
REANNOTATE is ready to re-annotate existing REPEATMASKER annotation – either in its original format or as REPEAT-

MASKER track tables from the UCSC Genome Browser web

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/614

site http://genome.ucsc.edu. The first two layers of automated re-annotation can be visualised in the APOLLO
genome browser [34], and in addition they can be combined with other kinds of annotation (e.g. non-repetitive
genes), facilitating direct human analysis when required.
Among the functions performed by REANNOTATE, defragmentation of genomic sequence regions homologous to
TEs has been previously addressed by other tools
[22,24,35]. MATCHER[22] uses a dynamic programming
algorithm to defragment TEs, but does not include biological constraints that can assist the defragmentation process. PLOTREP [35] is an interactive tool that assists
manual defragmentation but cannot provide fully automated defragmentation necessary for genome scale analysis. Recently, TCF [24] has become available for
automated identification and defragmentation of TE clusters, but TCF does not attempt to defragment all TEs –
notably pieces of LTR-elements found in clusters, and
fragments of TEs nested within another TE. REANNOTATE
provides fully automated defragmentation of any kind of
TE using biologically informed constraints. Importantly,
REANNOTATE is able to defragment LTR-elements, which
are often represented by separate query sequences for
LTRs and internal regions, and to estimate the age of LTRelement insertion events. Other important differences
between REANNOTATE and TCF include: i) TCF was developed for mammalian genomes and visualisation of annotation is limited to genomes available in the UCSC
genome browser web site, whilst REANNOTATE is ready for
the re-annotation of any genome and its visualisation
(using APOLLO); ii) TCF effectively defragments only TEs
that are interrupted by other previously characterised TE
sequences, whilst REANNOTATE allows interruptions by
any kind of sequence (e.g. unknown TEs) and also reannotates complex repeats other than TEs; iii) parameters
in the REANNOTATE defragmentation algorithm may be set
by users to adapt the algorithm to the repetitive content of
a particular genome; and iv) the annotation produced by
REANNOTATE has been validated by comparison with manually curated annotation of sequences containing highly
nested clusters of TEs. During the write-up of this paper,
another tool, TENEST[36], has become available that has
similar functionality to REANNOTATE. However, there are
also important differences between REANNOTATE and TENEST: i) TENEST currently uses plant repeat databases, and is
therefore designed to annotate plant genomes, whilst
REANNOTATE is ready to annotate any genome. ii) TENEST
itself manages the sequence similarity searches (using
WUBLAST[37] and LALIGN [38]) against the repeat library,
whilst REANNOTATE processes the similarity annotation
produced by RepeatMasker. The similarity search is the
most computationally expensive step in the annotation
process, and because RepeatMasker annotation is already
available for many genomic sequences, the re-annotation

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:614

of such sequences is computationally cheaper with REannotate. iii) The visualisation method employed by REANNOTATE allows the repetitive DNA annotation to be
combined with other kinds of genome annotation (see
below).
In order to illustrate the kind of analysis that become possible with REANNOTATE, an application of whole chromosome re-annotation is provided for a human sex
chromosome and two autosomes, providing analyses of i)
repetitive element patterns of nesting (including evidence
for recent expansion of satellite repeats on the Y chromosome), and ii) the age distribution of endogenous retroviruses.

Implementation
Repetitive element model construction and re-annotation
algorithm
A. Input REPEATMASKERannotation
REPEATMASKER annotation either in its original format or
as a UCSC table is input to REANNOTATE. If this annotation
reports similarity to N different reference repetitive elements, let R = {r1, ... rN} denote this library set of N reference elements. Here I call a hit to the reference element r
a query sequence region homologous to r and with higher
sequence similarity to r than to any other reference element in R, annotated by REPEATMASKER. As an example, a
visual representation of the input annotation is given in
Figure 1A.
B. Defragmentation of repetitive elements
REANNOTATE constructs repetitive element models
assigned to the different families in the reference library R.
A given reference element r defines a set of hits along the
query sequence. REANNOTATE will search for subsets of hits
to r that are to be defragmented into an element model if
they satisfy the criteria:

(i) Colinearity with the reference element.
(ii) Maximum span.
Criterion (i) requires that the defragmented hits be in the
same orientation on the query sequence, and that they
match consecutive (though not necessarily contiguous)
regions of the reference element r. (Note that along the
query sequence these defragmented hits need not be consecutive, in the sense that there may be other hits to r
nested between them.) An example is illustrated in Figure
1B. The reference element in question is PREM2_ZM_I (from
REPBASE UPDATE), and hits to this reference element along

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/614

the maize sequence are highlighted in magenta. REANNOconstructed a model defragmenting the three innermost hits to PREM2_ZM_I, shown in red, which respectively
match nucleotide positions 1-787, 783-4958, and 49566864 along the reference PREM2_ZM_I sequence. Note that
there is a small overlap between the matching coordinates
along the reference sequence (5 nucleotide between the
first two matches, and 3 nucleotides between the last
two), which is an ostensible deviation from strict colinearity between the three hits on the maize chromosome
and the reference sequence. This situation is common and
is due to uncertainty about the ends of local alignments.
REANNOTATE has a user-definable tolerance parameter in
the requirement for colinearity between the element
model and the reference element that allows for an overlap (o) between the matching coordinates of two defragmented hits along the reference sequence, if o  . (Default
= 40 nucleotides; if > L/10, where L is the length of a given
reference sequence r, then the tolerance margin for that
family is automatically set to L/10).
TATE

Criterion (ii) requires that the span (i.e. the query
sequence length from the end of the first to the beginning
of the last defragmented hit) of candidate repetitive element models do not exceed a (user-definable) length 
(default  = 40 Kb).
For each reference family in the library R, REANNOTATE
searches for candidate repetitive element models that satisfy (i) and (ii), but only constructs models that additionally satisfy:
(iii) Uniqueness.
(iv) Maximum defragmentation.
(v) Recursive model nesting.
Criterion (iii) requires that constructed models comprise
mutually exclusive sets of hits.
If two candidate models are such that all the hits defragmented in one model are present in the other model that
defragments a higher number of hits, then criterion (iv)
requires that only the model defragmenting the maximum number of hits be constructed.
If two candidate models (assigned to the same family)
comprise different sets of hits with at least one hit in common, then criterion (v) requires that the candidate model
whose hits span the narrower region of the query
sequence be constructed. If a hierarchy of such models
exists then this pairwise criterion is repeated recursively.
Additionally, if two candidate models (assigned to any
families) are such that a) they comprise non-intersecting

sets of hits and b) they span overlapping regions of the
query sequence, then criterion (v) requires that they cannot both be constructed unless the span of one candidate
model lies entirely within the span of the other.
Defragmentation of chromosomal elements matching multiple
reference sequences
If, upon human inspection of either the original REPEATMASKER annotation or the automated re-annotation, the
occurrence of fragments of a given repetitive element
matching multiple reference sequences is detected, a user
may supply as input to REANNOTATE a text file containing
lists of "related" reference elements, so that hits to different reference elements within one such list may be considered for defragmentation into a repetitive element model.
The use of this option was essential for the re-annotation
and analysis of human endogenous retroviruses in
Results; the ERV names equivalence lists are provided in
Additional file 1.
C. Defragmentation of LTR-elements
The defragmentation procedure described in step B above
applies to any high-complexity repetitive element. Both
the LTR and the internal region (i.e. the sequence between
the two LTRs of a complete element) of a given LTR-element family may be found as dispersed repeats. Fossil
remains of a given insertion may contain only LTR
sequence or only internal region (IR) sequence. REANNOTATE performs additional analysis of LTR-elements (i.e.
LTR-retrotransposons and retroviruses) if the reference
library contains separate entries for the LTR and IR
sequences. Names of reference LTR and IR elements of the
same family should be identical (unless a name equivalence list is input to REANNOTATE) apart from a suffix. Reference LTR names do not need a suffix, but they may be
suffixed with either the string '-LTR' or '_LTR' (case-insensitive). Reference IR names should be suffixed with either
'-int', '_int', '-I', or '_I' (case-insensitive). This is the naming convention used in REPBASE UPDATE for LTR-elements
in most genomes, though currently with the notable
exception of human/primate endogenous retroviruses
(for the solution to this problem adopted in this study see
below and Additional files 1 and 2).

Models of LTRs and IRs are separately constructed with
the Defragmentation algorithm in step B. REANNOTATE then
constructs higher-order models combining models of
defragmented LTRs and defragmented IRs. Higher-order
model construction proceeds with requirements analogous to those in step B, but now the colinearity criterion
refers to the LTR-IR-LTR structure of a canonical LTR-element. An example is illustrated in Figure 1C. Recursive
model nesting (as in B) is used to defragment LTR-element structures within structures. Where nested structures
corresponding to the same family are identified, these are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/614

resolved by mapping the coordinates of the component
LTR or IR fragments onto their respective reference
sequences. A nested element should interrupt the nesting
element. (If there is ambiguity in the sense that a given
LTR could be paired with two different LTRs and IRs, a
model of a 'complete' element is constructed with the two
LTRs whose sequences are most similar to each other).
If a candidate higher-order model contains only one LTR
and one IR model, a higher-order model for a truncated
LTR-element is constructed only if the LTR and IR are separated on the query by less than a (user-definable) distance  (REANNOTATE default  = 15 Kb). Furthermore,
truncated higher-order models are only constructed when
the constituent LTR and IR models cannot be accommodated in a model of a 'complete' LTR-element.
REANNOTATE classifies LTR-element models as either (i)
'complete', if they contain at least part of the sequence of
both their original LTRs and of the IR; or (ii) 'truncated', if
they are not 'complete' and not a 'solo' LTR; or (iii) a 'solo'
LTR, if a model contains only sequence corresponding to
a single LTR, and if this is separated from the nearest LTR
or IR model – of the same family and inserted in the same
orientation – by a distance greater than . (Note that the
term 'solo LTR' is often used to mean an element that
resulted from a deletion event that occurred via recombination between intra-element LTRs; such an event would
preserve target site duplications (TSDs) flanking the original element, however REANNOTATE currently does not
check for TSDs, and such a check would only be possible
if the termini of the original element had not been truncated).
DNA rearrangements other than transposition
REANNOTATE will flag the possibility that LTR-element
sequences have been involved in DNA rearrangements
other than transposition of an entire element when an IRLTR-IR structure is detected, i.e. two IR models flanking an
LTR model of the same family, in the same orientation.
Here "flanking" means that either i) the LTR model and
the IR models are contiguous on the query sequence
(within a tolerance margin ), and that neighbouring ends
have no missing sequence (within ) – this excludes the
possibility of a nested insertion of an IR or LTR of the
same family being considered; or ii) the LTR and IR models are not contiguous on the query and they are not complete, but the length of the gaps between them equals the
amount of sequence they are missing (within ) – this
includes structures in which the IR-LTR boundaries have
been obliterated (possibly prior to the re-arrangement), or
structures with segments that are not homologous to the
closest library sequence; or (iii) the structure is highly
symmetrical, i.e. the two IR models are equidistant from

Page 5 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:614

the LTR model between them (within ), and provided that
this separation on the query is less than .
D. Inference of nesting order
After all hits to high-complexity repetitive elements have
been defragmented into element models, any nested
structures can be resolved by comparing the coordinate
ranges of the models along the query sequence. If the span
of a given model is contained within the span of another
model, the former is classified as 'nested' in the latter
(inferred to have inserted into the latter). An example is
continued from step C and shown in Figure 1D.

REANNOTATE also provides an optional algorithm for the
identification of 'truncated nesting': if one terminus of a
given element model interrupts another model, the interrupting element may be classified as nested even if the
interrupted element does not contain detectable sequence
on both sides of the interrupting element. Truncated nesting is annotated only if there is no sequence missing from
the the interrupting terminus of the interrupting element
(so that a deletion spanning part of the truncated element
and part of the interrupting element is not considered).
E. Dating of LTR-elements
For each (structurally) complete LTR-element model constructed, REANNOTATE outputs the gapped sequence (see
below) of each intra-element LTR separately. REANNOTATE
then generates automated intra-element LTR alignments
using the CLUSTALW(2) [39] alignment program. The
number of nucleotide substitutions per site (K) between
intra-element LTR sequences (and its variance) is then
estimated (Figure 1E) using the Kimura 2-parameter
model [40]. If a rate of substitutions per site (s) is provided, the time elapsed since the insertion of a 'complete'
K
LTR-element (t) is estimated as t = 2 s . In addition to the
variance propagated from the estimation of K, the vari-

ance of the time estimate ( s t2 ) accounts for the fact that
the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions occurs stochastically over time, which can be modeled as a Poisson
process; the variance in t is then estimated as

s t2 =

(s K L) 2 + KL
4( sL) 2

, where K is the standard deviation of

the estimate of K, and L is the length of the intra-element
LTR alignment.
Gapped sequence output
Each repetitive element model constructed by REANNOTATE is associated with a given reference element r; each
similarity hit defragmented into a given model is locally
aligned to r by the sequence similarity search engine used

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/614

either
WUBLAST[37]
or
REPEATMASKER,
For each model REANNOTATE outputs
the chromosomal sequences (that have been locally
aligned to r) of its hits, separated by gaps if necessary. The
gaps refer to local alignment positions along r: in the output model sequence the gap length between two hits does
not correspond to their distance along the chromosomal
sequence, but rather to the distance between the hits' terminal alignment positions along r. Terminal gaps are also
included if the hits to do not align as far as the termini of
r. An example is given in Figure 2.
with

CROSS_MATCH[41].

If REANNOTATE is run with the option to estimate the age
of structurally complete LTR-element models then the
CLUSTALW2 pairwise alignments of gapped intra-element
LTR sequences are also output.
Evaluation of REANNOTATE's predictions
Accuracy of the defragmentation layer of re-annotation
was assessed by its sensitivity and specificity at the element level. A high sensitivity would indicate that most of
the hits in the input REPEATMASKER annotation that correspond to fragmented repetitive elements in the manually
annotated query sequence have been correctly assembled
into multi-hit element models by REANNOTATE. A high
specificity would indicate that few hits that are not part of
fragmented elements have been incorrectly included into
multi-hit element models. The sensitivity and specificity
were respectively calculated according to the formulas
TN
and TN + FP , where TP (count of true positive predictions) is the number of hits correctly assembled into
multi-hit repetitive element models; FN (count of false
negatives) is the number of separate element models constructed by REANNOTATE that correspond to the same elements in the manual annotation; TN (count of true
negatives) is the number of hits correctly modeled as single-hit elements; and FP (count of false positives) is the
number of hits incorrectly assembled into multi-hit models. Accuracy of both the nesting structure and the time
layers of re-annotation was calculated as the proportion of
REANNOTATE predictions in agreement with manually
curated annotation.

Sequence output
Sequence output. The element model shown in green (in A) defragmented three regions of human chromosome Y homologous to segments of the reference sequence of the DNA transposon family MER58B (CHESHIRE_B), shown in B. Hits marked 1
and 2 (in A) are separated on the chromosome by only 26 bp, but in the output model sequence (shown in C) their respective
sequences are separated by an internal gap of length 79 – this is the distance along the reference MER58B separating its segments
that are aligned to hits 1 and 2. In contrast, the sequences of hits 2 and 3 are output contiguously (without an intervening gap)
because they match contiguous segments of MER58B – even though the corresponding chromosomal regions are separated by
an ALUSX SINE insertion (blue box above the green model in A). The terminal gap in the model sequence is added to indicate
that the annotated alignment of hit 3 ends five nucleotide positions short of the 5' terminus of the MER58B sequence.
CINFUL2_ZM are closely related, and hits to these elements
were considered together for defragmentation into element models. In the diploid wheat analysis the monocot
library from the REPBASE UPDATE repeatmaskerlibrary version 20050523 was used.

Re-annotation output
The main annotation is output to a tab-delimited text file.
As an example, the annotation of the maize sequence analysed here is given in Additional file 3, and its data fields
are described in Additional file 4.

Analysis of human and fly sequences
REPEATMASKER annotation was downloaded directly from
the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC)
Genome Browser web site http://www.genome.ucsc.edu.

A copy of the input REPEATMASKER annotation is also output, with the original "ID" column replaced with identifiers of defragmented elements in the main REANNOTATE
annotation file.

Annotation of the human genome sequences was further
processed with a custom script (Additional file 2) to suffix
the names of reference LTR and IR elements for defragmentation. Additionally, a file with ERV reference name
equivalence lists (Additional file 1) was input to REANNOTATE. This is because many HERV reference sequences in
REPBASE UPDATE (which were used in the REPEATMASKER
annotation) are closely related but may have disparate
names, and for most ERV families the corresponding LTR
and IR reference sequences have different names.

Benchmarking of processing time
In order to illustrate the computational cost of re-annotation, I have benchmarked the CPU time used by REannotate for processing the entire Arabidopsis thaliana genome.
REPEATMASKER annotation of the A. thaliana genome was
downloaded from http://www.repeatmasker.org/Pre
MaskedGenomes.html, and the corresponding genome
sequence was downloaded from ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/
home/tair/Genes/TIGR5_genome_release/.

Running (under GNU/LINUX) on a 3.16 GHz INTEL E8500
processor, REannotate took:

ple, the re-annotation of 6 similarity hits that were defragmented into the same TE model.

• 157 CPU seconds to re-annotate the entire genome and
output sequence. Out of these 157 seconds, 62 seconds
were used by CLUSTALW2 to produce alignments. (19213
repetitive element models were constructed, 3619 nested
insertions were inferred, and 294 intra-element LTR pairs
were aligned).

Fragmentation of repetitive element sequences in the
REPEATMASKER annotation may also result from divergent
or chimeric elements relative to the reference sequences
used in the similarity searches, or from matches to closely
related sequences in the reference library, rather than
sequence evolution of a repetitive element since its integration into the genome. REANNOTATE provides a facility
to defragment hits in this situation as well (see section
"Defragmentation of chromosomal elements matching
multiple reference sequences" in Implementation). Additionally, DNA re-arrangements other than transposition
of an entire element (e.g. segmental duplication) may
occur involving repetitive elements after their integration;
in this situation a single insertion model is not adequate
to describe all of a query sequence that is homologous to
a given repetitive element in the re-arranged region. Currently for LTR-elements (only) REANNOTATE checks for the
possibility of re-arrangements that result in multiplication
of segments of elements, and generates models of such rearrangements (see below and Implementation).

• 107 CPU seconds (57 seconds used by CLUSTALW2) in
total, to re-annotate the five A. thaliana chromosomes if
the input RepeatMasker annotation was processed separately for each chromosome (i.e. the input annotation for
each chromosome was stored in separate files).
• 195 CPU seconds (86 seconds used by CLUSTALW2) to reannotate the entire genome when equivalence lists of reference repeats were used to defragment chromosomal elements matching multiple reference sequences. (Nine
equivalence lists were used: 1. athila4 athila4A athila4B
athila4C; 2. athila8A athila8B; 3. athila6 athila athila2
athila0; 4. athila6A athila6B athila6; 5. athila athila5 athila2;
6. athila0 athila3; 7. atgp3 atgp5 atgp7; 8. atgp1 atgp2N; 9.
ATREP3 ATREP4). (18880 element models were constructed, 3673 nested insertions were inferred, and 393
intra-element LTR pairs were aligned).
Processing times will be much longer if many equivalence
lists (such as those in Additional file 1, which exceed 100)
are input to REannotate.

Results and discussion
Re-annotation
REANNOTATE creates up to three new 'layers' of repetitive
DNA annotation over existing REPEATMASKER[20] annotation taken as input. The new layers of annotation are:
Layer 1 – Defragmentation
After integration, the sequence of a repetitive element may
become fragmented by subsequent insertion/deletion
events or other rearrangements. REANNOTATE generates
models of repetitive element insertion events into an
ancestral state of a query genomic sequence, in order to
identify query sequence regions that originated in the
same insertion event and that correspond to (possibly)
multiple hits in the input REPEATMASKER annotation.
Therefore for a given re-annotated query sequence the
number of TE hits in the REPEATMASKER annotation is usually greater than the total number of repetitive element
models obtained from the defragmentation of hits performed by REANNOTATE (the inferred number of insertion
events). Figure 3A shows a visual representation of the
REPEATMASKER annotation of multiple similarity hits to
TEs along a DNA sequence. Figure 3B shows, as an exam-

REPEATMASKER annotation implicitly contains the chromosomal distribution of sequence similarity hits to dispersed
repeats along the query sequence. This first layer of reannotation consequently contains the chromosomal distribution of repetitive element integration events.
Layer 2 – Nesting Structure
As the genomic distribution of repetitive elements is not
random, families of elements may vary in their distribution patterns, which may reflect biases towards chromatin
states or proximity to particular classes of genes or other
sequence elements [44]. Clustering of repeats occurs not
only at the chromosomal level, but also at smaller scales.
In eukaryotic genomes, repeat deserts are commonly
punctuated by regions of high repeat density, where subsequent insertions have occurred into previous repetitive
element insertions ('nested' elements) [10,24-32]. Building upon the insertion models of the Defragmentation
layer of re-annotation, REANNOTATE resolves any nested
structures among the repetitive elements identified. Figure
3C shows resolved clusters of re-annotated TEs. The temporal order of insertion events in nested structures is reflected
by the nesting level of each element model.
Layer 3 – Time
The direct, long terminal repeats (LTRs) of any individual
LTR-retrotransposon or retrovirus are created from the
same parent template, and are therefore identical at the
time the element integrates into the host molecule. Nucleotide substitutions in either of the two intra-element LTR
sequences can accumulate as time passes, so that their

Layers of re-annotation: maize adh1 locus. A. Representation of the input REPEATMASKER annotation of 160 Kb of
sequence around the adh1 locus of maize cultivar LH82. In the bottom tier pale yellow boxes correspond to un-masked
sequence (no similarity to known repeats), dark vertical lines indicate low-complexity repeats. Boxes in top tier represent similarity hits to dispersed repeats, separated by vertical lines. Red boxes represent hits to the IR of LTR-elements, orange boxes
LTRs, lilac boxes non-LTR retrotransposons, dark green boxes DNA transposons, and the pink box an unknown type of
repeat. B. Detail of re-annotation layer 1: Defragmentation. The two bottom tiers represent a portion of the REPEATMASKER
annotation shown in A, whilst boxes above indicate 3 IR hits (third tier from bottom) and 3 LTR hits (top tier) defragmented
into a single model, and therefore inferred to share an insertion event. This element is labeled 'i' in C and in Table 1, and corresponds to element Victim in 45. (Three hits modeled as part of the same IR are linked by a red line, two hits modeled as part
of the second LTR linked by an orange line). C. Re-annotation layer 2: Nesting Structure. Overlapping element models are
shown in their order of insertion as resolved by REANNOTATE. (Figure created by rendering in APOLLO GFF annotation
automatically generated by REANNOTATE). Letters label LTR-elements in Table 1 that were annotated in 45. D. Re-annotation layer 3: Time. For 'complete' LTR-elements the number of substitutions (vertical scale) between intra-element LTRs and
the time since insertion have been automatically estimated. Upper bounds on the ages of two solo LTRs (labeled 'j' and 'm')
could be placed as the elements are inserted into complete LTR-elements. Double-headed arrows span two standard deviations around estimates of K. This figure may be compared to Figures 1 and 2 in 45.

sequence divergence works as a molecular timer, set to
zero at the time of integration [45]. REANNOTATE can generate automated intra-element LTR alignments and then
estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site
(K) that have occurred between the intra-element LTR of a
given element since its insertion event. Estimates of K are
a relative measure of time; but if the user can provide a
rate of nucleotide substitution, estimates of K can be converted to estimates of absolute ages of (structurally) 'complete' LTR-elements. (Here by 'complete' I refer to
elements for which at least a portion of each LTR is still
detectable). Although direct dating of insertions is only
available for 'complete' LTR-elements (and made possible
by the previous Defragmentation layer of re-annotation),
in nested structures bounds on the ages of other kinds of
sequence elements can be estimated by using the age estimate for an overlapping LTR-element. If a 'complete' LTRelement is found in a nested cluster of repetitive elements,
the previous Nesting Structure layer of re-annotation
allows the placement of i) an upper bound on the age of
any elements nested within, and ii) a lower bound on the
age of any elements nesting, the LTR-element. Figure 3D
shows examples of both direct dating of insertion events
and indirectly using the nesting structure. Additionally,
indirect dating of host molecules is possible in cases such
as i) segmental duplications with a differential content of,
and ii) haplotypes bearing insertional polymorphism for,
'complete' LTR-elements. Here a paleontological analogy
is particularly apt, as the dating of both the molecular fossil and its sequence context are interrelated, just as real
fossils can be dated by either absolute (e.g. radiocarbon)
or relative (e.g. stratigraphic) methods. In eukaryotic
genomes nesting of repetitive elements (see Background)
and insertional polymorphisms [44,46-50], for example]
are common – in plants particularly for LTR-elements.
This layer of re-annotation implicitly contains the age distribution of 'complete' LTR-elements, and bounds on the
ages of other kinds of sequences that may be found overlapping LTR-elements.
Visualisation of re-annotation
In addition to the main re-annotation output to tabdelimited text files, for visualisation and human analysis
of the automated annotation REANNOTATE generates a
General Feature Format (GFF) annotation file. The GFF
annotation can be visualised (using a configuration file
distributed with REANNOTATE) in the APOLLO genome
browser [34]. Figure 3C is taken from a screenshot of such
a visualisation. The GFF output can be combined with any
other kinds of annotation of the query sequences that are
available in the GFF format.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/614

Sequence output
REANNOTATE retrieves (from the query) and assembles the
sequence of all repetitive element models constructed. For
each element model, it outputs the sequences of all the
fossil fragments associated with a given model without
intervening (unrelated) regions of the query sequence
(Figure 2). Each pair of neighbouring fragment sequences
is either i) output contiguously if they match contiguous
segments of the reference sequence, or ii) output separated by a gap of length equal to distance between the
respective matching segments of the reference sequence
(see Figure 2 and Implementation). Thus these gapped
sequences reflect the element insertion model and
exclude the sequence of subsequent insertions into the
element. For each 'family' of repeats (where 'family' refers
to the set of elements in the query sequence that share a
closest homologue in the reference library): gapped element
sequences are all aligned relative to the reference sequence.
Alignment of all the elements within a family, whose
sequences may contain large indels relative to one
another, is a powerful feature for the evolutionary (phylogenetic) analysis of repetitive elements.
Validation: nested transposable elements in cereal
genomes
In order to validate annotation and evolutionary analysis
generated by REANNOTATE, I have re-annotated repetitive
elements in maize and wheat sequences, and then compared their automated re-annotation with published
human annotation of these sequences. The term 'molecular paleontology' was coined by SanMiguel et al. [45], who
produced manual annotation of nested clusters of LTRretrotransposons within 240 kb around the adh1 locus of
a particular maize cultivar and inferred a doubling of the
maize genome size due to LTR-retrotransposon activity
over a period of three million years – an inference that was
possible by dating (using intra-element LTR sequence
divergence) insertion events. Approximately 160 Kb of
contiguous sequence and annotation for this locus are
available. Detailed annotation of highly nested clusters of
LTR-retrotransposons (including age estimates for complete elements) and other types of TEs is also available for
a 215 Kb segment of chromosome 5Am of the diploid
wheat Triticum monococcum [51]. Both the 160 Kb- and
215 Kb-long maize and diploid wheat sequences were
annotated with REPEATMASKER and re-annotated with
REANNOTATE (see Implementation for details). The automated re-annotation and evolutionary analyses are illustrated in Figure 3 (maize) and Figure 4 (wheat), and
compared to the manually curated annotation in Table 1.

Although the analyses above focused on the annotation of
LTR-elements, they also validate the automated re-annotation of other kinds of repetitive elements and were chosen for two main reasons: i) Models of LTR-elements in

Manual annotation results of maize [45] and diploid wheat [51] sequences are shown in italics. REANNOTATE results are shown in regular font style.
Only elements spanning sequences that were annotated as TEs both in the manual annotation and in the input (REPEATMASKER) to the automated reannotation are listed. In the first column letters indicate maize elements and correspond to labels in Figure 3C, numbers indicate wheat elements
and labels in Figure 4.
a Uppercase names correspond to reference element sequences in REPBASE UPDATE (RU), numbers correspond to reference sequences in the TIGR
ZEA REPEAT DATABASE. Rows without an entry for the manually annotated repeat name indicate that REANNOTATE constructed multiple models (one
model per row) corresponding to a single element in the manual annotation: for instance, Sabrina_F2-2 corresponds to three automated models, a
result due to the fact that (parts of) different RU reference elements, SABRINA2_TM, SABRINA3_TM and SABRINA_HV are closely related, and were best
matches (annotated by REPEATMASKER) to different segments of Sabrina_F2-2.
b Number of similarity hits reported by REPEATMASKER that were defragmented into a single element model by REANNOTATE.
c Number of repetitive elements nesting a given element. (†) The first wheat element listed was annotated in [51] to be inserted into a TE sequence
with no detectable similarity to reference elements in RU (absent form the input REPEATMASKER annotation); the last wheat element was annotated
by REANNOTATE to be interrupting a fragment of an element homologous to CLAUDIA1_TM, which is not present in the manual annotation.
d Estimated number of nucleotide substitutions between intra-element LTRs. (*) REANNOTATE did not date Milt because the 3' LTR is in inverse
orientation relative to the rest of the element: an element model was built including the Milt 5' LTR and internal region, and another model for the
3' LTR. (‡) Eway G1-1 was originally annotated as having identical LTRs, but they are in fact quite divergent. (...) Elements Ji-6, Tekay and Kake-1 were
dated in the original annotation, but these elements are truncated at the ends of the available 160 Kb of contiguous sequence re-annotated here.
e Estimated time of insertion (million years ago), obtained with the substitution rate for the adh loci of grasses [66]. The standard deviations
computed by REANNOTATE are larger than in the manual annotation: in the latter the variance in time was propagated from the variance in K, whilst
REANNOTATE additionally accounts for the Poisson variance (stochasticity) in the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions.

the first (Defragmentation) layer of re-annotation are
more complex than models of other repeats. LTR-element
models involve defragmentation of LTRs (which are
themselves repetitive elements) and defragmentation of
the internal regions (which are also repetitive) using the
same algorithm as for other repeats, and an additional
algorithm to defragment LTRs and internal regions modeled as parts of the structure of the same element (see
Implementation). Therefore validation of the automated
defragmentation of LTR-elements can be extended to
other repetitive elements. The second layer (Nesting Structure) of re-annotation builds on the first layer and uses the
same algorithm for all elements. Finally, the third layer
(Time) of re-annotation is directly applicable only to
(structurally) complete LTR-elements (though secondary
inferences can be made for other kinds of elements if they
overlap with a complete LTR-element). Note that results
for the Time layer are obtained independently from any
information on Nesting Structure (except for the secondary
inferences of bounds on the ages of overlapping elements). The Time layer annotation of the LTR-elements in
the maize and wheat sequences analysed is completely
consistent with the Nesting Structure annotation (Figures 3
and 4, and Table 1), adding support to the method for
dating LTR-elements. Consistency between nesting structure and age estimates (obtained from a method different

from the one used here) has also been shown for mammalian TEs using TCF [24], suggesting that this result is a general feature of the molecular paleontology of TEs. ii) For
the maize and wheat sequences analysed, manually
curated annotation of transposable elements was available that contained detailed information on the nesting
order of repeats and dating of LTR-elements, providing a
standard for comparing automated inferences against.
Here I compared (Table 1) only TE sequences that are
present both in the manual and in the REPEATMASKER
annotation input to REANNOTATE, because only those are
relevant for evaluating REANNOTATE's inferences. REANNOTATE's predictions in the three layers of re-annotation
achieved excellent accuracy relative to manual annotation, with results shown in Table 2 (see Implementation
for calculation). The actual accuracy of predictions may be
higher, as for some of the discrepancies the correct prediction may be attributed, upon inspection, to the automated re-annotation, despite the generally high quality of
the human-curated annotation. For instance, the given
accuracy of the Time layer predictions for the wheat
sequence was obtained from 10 correct predictions out of
11 complete LTR-elements dated (90.9%). The one disagreement refers to the element Eway_G1-1 (Table 1) that
was originally misannotated as having identical intra-elePage 13 of 21

Re-annotation of highly nested TEs in the diploid wheat genome
Re-annotation of highly nested TEs in the diploid wheat genome. Re-annotation of repeats in a 215 Kb region of Triticum monococcum chromosome 5Am. Numbers label elements listed in Table 1. Colour scheme follows Figure 3 (except that
thin green boxes are specifically MITEs, and on the bottom tier unique genes are shown as light blue boxes). Label "18" appears
twice and corresponds to element Sabrina_G1-1 annotated in [51] (Fig. 1 in this reference may be compared with this figure);
REANNOTATE constructed two separate models because when run with default parameters the maximum span of a model is 40
Kb, which is exceeded by the chromosomal span of Sabrina_G1-1. Element models marked with a "*" above a horizontal bar
were annotated as part of element Sabrina_F2-2 in [51], which corresponds to label "3" in this figure (see section 'Limitations
and scope for development'). This figure was rendered in APOLLO from a GFF annotation file generated by REANNOTATE.
ment LTRs; the LTR sequences are actually quite divergent
and REANNOTATE predicts the element to be the oldest of
all complete LTR-elements found in the analysed query
sequence.
Repetitive DNA rearrangements other than transposition
In order to demonstrate that REANNOTATE can correctly
detect and annotate DNA re-arrangement events (involving TE sequences) that have occurred after integration, I
have re-annotated a region of the D. melanogaster genome
that has previously been shown to contain a large number
of TE fragments that have arisen by the joint effects of integration and duplication [32]. This region lies between the
Hsp70 genes on chromosome arm 3R and is denoted in
ref. [52] as NEST_FBti0020655 (Release 3), and in ref. [32]
as "high density region 16 (HDR16)" (Release 4). The reannotation of NEST_FBti0020655 is shown in Figure 5,
which can be compared to Figure 2 in ref. [32]. This serves
to illustrate an additional type of inference that can be
generated by REANNOTATE: the identification of segmental
duplications contained in dispersed repeats (currently for
LTR-elements only). Such a rearrangement could result
from tandem duplication of a segment of an element, or
from inter-element recombination events (e.g. between
LTRs). Note that here REannotate attempts to construct an

explicit model of sequence duplication to distinguish the
origin of the repetitive sequences from independent transposition events.
The periodic structure of the LTR-element sequences in
Figure 5 strongly suggests tandem multiplication. The
multiple similarity hits (annotated by REPEATMASKER) to
LTR-elements (in which other repeats are nested) in the
structure (inferred by REANNOTATE) all belong to the same
family (COPIA2), periodically map to the same regions of
the reference sequence, and were re-annotated as elements that have been involved in a DNA rearrangement
other than transposition. The 'solo' LTRs re-annotated as
nested in the COPIA2 sequences all belong to the same family (INVADER1), they are also periodically arrayed (with the
same spacing as the nesting sequences), and are inserted
at the same position within the reference COPIA2 LTR.
Hence it is evident that the INVADER1 LTR was inserted in
the COPIA2 LTR prior to tandem multiplication. Arrangements of the kind found in the D. melanogaster cluster
NEST_FBti0020655/HDR16 (Figure 5) have also been
reported for LTR-elements in yeast [53], for human ERVs
[54], and have been detected with REANNOTATE in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (data not shown). Thus it is posPage 14 of 21

mechanisms in addition to transposition is a common
phenomenon in eukaryotic genomes [32].
Although prediction of DNA rearrangements other than
transposition is under-annotated by REANNOTATE (only
certain kinds of rearrangement are currently detected – see
Implementation), these annotations have value in i) cautioning the user against the validity of dating LTR-elements that may have been involved in post-integration
recombination events; and ii) marking structures with

Genome Paleontology
The advent of automated defragmentation and sequence
analysis of fossil fragments of dispersed repeats makes
possible the study of the evolutionary dynamics of these
elements (and their host molecules) at the scale of entire
chromosomes or genomes [44,54].

In order to further illustrate evolutionary analyses that
become possible with REANNOTATE, here I highlight the reannotation of dispersed repeats in a human sex chromosome (Y) and in two autosomes (chromosomes 2 and 1).
Nesting of repeats in the human genome
Nesting patterns and counts of insertion events of repeats
re-annotated on human chromosomes Y and 2 are summarised in Table 3. One striking result is the scarcity of TE
insertions nested in satellite repeats, especially on chromosome Y. Even though, from these data, the possibility
of functional constraint on satellite arrays cannot be ruled
out, it is plausible that this result reflects a recent expansion of satellite repeats on human chromosome Y. Taking
chromosome 2 as an example, not only the density of TE
insertions into satellite sequence is almost four times that
on the Y chromosome, but also there are ten times as
many satellite repeats on the Y as in chromosome 2 (Table
3). The density of TE insertions into satellite arrays has
been recently used to infer an age gradient for domains of
such arrays around the primate X chromosome centromere [55].

Segmental multiplication within a TE cluster in the fly genome. Re-annotation of a cluster of repeats in the Drosophila

scheme as in Figure 3, except that "element" models – displayed as boxes united by horizontal lines – no longer indicate
sequences sharing an insertion (transposition) event; here a model indicates sequences that resulted from segmental multiplication subsequent to an original insertion. Note the high periodicity of the arrangement. The LTR-elements displayed immediately above the bottom tier all belong to the COPIA2 family, the sequences marked with a '*' are all INVADER1 LTRs, and the ones
marked with a black bar are MICROPIA elements. REANNOTATE infers that the COPIA2 sequences have been involved in DNA
rearrangements other than transposition of an entire element. It is likely that the INVADER1 LTR was inserted in a COPIA2 LTR
prior to the multiplication of the latter. The green box to the left indicates (subsequent) insertion of a PROTOP_A element, and
the ones on the right S-elements. (All family names given as in the RU database). This figure was rendered in APOLLO from a
GFF annotation file generated by REANNOTATE, and it may be compared with Figure 2 in ref. [32].

Another noteworthy nesting pattern in the re-annotation
is the difference between LINEs on the one hand, and
SINEs and LTR-elements on the other. On chromosome 2,
LINEs harbour on average over twice the density of TE
insertions (of any kind) per unit of LINE sequence than
do SINEs per unit of SINE sequence or LTR-elements per
unit of LTR-element sequence. In addition, on chromosome 2 (and on the Y) the proportion of SINE and LTRelement insertions nested into other repetitive elements is
higher than that of LINEs (Table 3). Multiple factors such
as age, base composition, and insertional biases may contribute to these differences, although automated analysis
of such factors is beyond what is currently implemented
in REANNOTATE.
Autosomal vs Y chromosome comparison of endogenous retroviral
ages
The age distribution of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)
on human chromosomes 1, 2, and Y was obtained from
their automated re-annotation, and shown in Figure 6.
ERVs on both chromosomes 1 and 2 have less divergent
intra-element LTRs than those on chromosome Y (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, p < 10-6), whilst there is no significant age difference between chromosomes 1 and 2 (p =
0.6). The main period(s) of retroviral activity over evolutionary time must have generated most ERV insertions on
all chromosomes, therefore the older estimated ages are
consistent with a faster rate of evolution on the Y than on

chromosomes 1 and 2. Given that the "old" tail of the age
distributions on those three chromosomes are similarly
shaped, the age difference is not purely an effect due to
longer persistence of ERVs on the Y. Evidence (from different methods) for a faster rate of evolution of the human Y
chromosome relative to autosomes has been previously
reported (e.g. [56]).
In contrast to plant (cereal) genomes where LTR-element
polymorphisms make the dating of these elements potentially useful for dating haplotypes from different lines
within the same species, most primate ERV insertions are
ancient. Using the rate of evolution for mammalian
repeats estimated in [57], 2.1 × 10-3 substitutions per site
per million years, the age distributions of ERVs in the
genome of the lineage leading to human peaks at around
40 Myr ago.
Discussion of potential applications
Re-annotation of repetitive elements via automated
defragmentation, resolution of nesting structures, and (in
some cases) dating of LTR-elements form the basis for the
evolutionary analyses exemplified above. Re-annotation
also makes possible other kinds of analyses that were not
explored in this report. For example, i) analysis of the
insertion sites of TEs, which would require proper defragmentation of fossil sequence fragments to identify the
both termini of the ancestral TE sequence at the time of

within library sequences of reference high-complexity (dispersed) repeats, which results in low-complexity repeats
in chromosomal sequence being annotated by REPEATMASKER as high-complexity repeats [22]. If these regions
were masked on the reference sequences prior to their use
in similarity searches, multiple hits might be reported
even when the chromosomal sequence of a repetitive element is intact – this artefactual fragmentation is resolved
by REANNOTATE into an element model, and masking of
low-complexity regions in the reference library would be
recommended in order to avoid low-complexity
sequences being annotated as dispersed repeats. In addition to the re-annotation, the sequence output from REANNOTATE also has potential uses that were not explored in
this report. Here this output was only utilised for dating
LTR-elements, but alignment of all copies within a given
family of repeats (which is non-trivial as copies typically
have large indels relative to each other) is a powerful
resource for evolutionary studies of repetitive elements.
For instance, alignment of human ERV sequences
(obtained with an early precursor to REANNOTATE) supported an analysis showing that members of the HERV-K
family have been re-infecting the germline of the human
lineage for 30 million years – from the inference of selective constraint on the HERV-K envelope gene [58]. Further
examples of potential applications aided by multiple
alignments of TE sequences are analyses of i) transition/
transversion ratios in tests for the detection of hypermutability associated with cytosine methylation [59], ii) insertion/deletion spectra, used to estimate rates of
spontaneous DNA loss [60], and iii) evolutionary relationships among individual elements or families via phylogeny re-construction [58,61].

dating events on their host molecules, for instance when

interruption matrix analysis [24,32].
Defragmentation of repeats performed by REANNOTATE
could also solve a problem that has plagued automated
annotation of complex repeats: low-complexity regions

Limitations and scope for development
Reference library issues
As REANNOTATE takes as input similarity-based (REPEATMASKER) annotation, only elements homologous to
known families of repeats can be re-annotated. For
genomes with poorly characterised repeat families, any
similarity-based detection methodology needs to be complemented with de novo repeat discovery [[62-65], for
example]. Even though de novo discovery is useful for
identifying uncharacterised families of repeats, it is not
appropriate for genomic sequence annotation as it will
fail to predict many repetitive elements that are are nested
or fragmented. New families should be added to form an
augmented reference library, and query sequences annotated with REPEATMASKER and REANNOTATE. Generally,
sequence divergence between repetitive element lineages
exposes the dependence of similarity-based annotation
on the quality and comprehensiveness of the reference
library. For defragmentation, the most difficult situation
occurs when a chromosomal element is divergent from all
available library elements. For example, if the chromo-

Page 17 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:614

somal element is in parts homologous to two different
library elements, then REannotate would construct two
element models instead of one. Note that REannotate
does provide a facility to correct defragmentation, provided that this situation is noticed through human inspection in the first place (see below).
Chimeric elements also present a challenging form of
sequence divergence. They arise, for instance, when i) a
transposable element nesting an unrelated element is
mobilised, transducing the nested element; or ii) recombination between TE or ERV sequences leads to a new replication-competent element. If the progenitors of a
chimeric element, but not the element itself, are both represented in the reference library, then REPEATMASKER will
report separate hits to each progenitor reference, and
REANNOTATE will construct separate element models for
segments of the chimeric element. However, if upon
human inspection of the automated annotation such chimerism is noticed, REANNOTATE does provide an option to
combine hits to prescribed reference elements into element
models, so that a new round of re-annotation will construct models capturing the full sequence of chimeric elements.
The optional REANNOTATE facility to defragment elements
matching multiple reference sequences is also useful for
solving another problem – overrepresentation of a lineage
in the reference library, when the library redundantly contains very closely related sequences. Again this may cause
REPEATMASKER to report matches to different reference elements that correspond to segments of the same chromosomal element. Finally, user-prescribed association of
reference elements is essential for the construction of LTRelement models if the library entries for the LTR and IR
representing the same family of elements have different
names (as is the case for primate ERVs in REPBASE
UPDATE).
However, the ideal approach for optimum similaritybased annotation is the construction of a reference library
that non-redundantly represents repeat lineages as comprehensively as possible. In some cases, even when it is
noticed (on human inspection) that chromosomal elements match multiple library sequences, the REannotate
facility to defragment such elements will not help. This is
the case when the rules for element model construction
and defragmentation are violated. For example, the element labeled "3" in Table 1 (first column) and in Figure 4
was present in the original human annotation [51] with
the name Sabrina_F2-2", an LTR-retrotransposon. The IR
of this element was matched by three disntinct reference
elements in the library used (Table 1: "SABRINA2_TM",
"SABRINA3_TM", and "SABRINA_HV"). So in this case REannotate constructed three separate element models, which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/614

correspond to the element "Sabrina_F2-2" in the human
annotation. The longest of these three models (labeled
"3" in Figure 4) defragmented four hits to the reference
element SABRINA2_TM (one IR and three LTR hits). The
other two short element models are marked in Figure 4 by
a horizontal bar and a "*". They correspond to the hits to
SABRINA3_TM and SABRINA_HV. In the current defragmentation algorithm, these shorter hits could never be defragmented into the longer model containing the four
SABRINA2_TM hits. This is because the SABRINA2_TM hits have
in fact the opposite orientation on the chromosome relative to the SABRINA3_TM and SABRINA_HV hits.
DNA re-arrangements
REANNOTATE assembles fossil sequence fragments colinear
with a given reference element into an element model,
and the model assumes that such fragments are also colinear with the ancestral sequence of a repetitive element at
the time of integration. DNA rearrangements involving a
TE after its insertion into the genome may disrupt colinearity of its sequence with a reference element. The issue
then arises as to whether to classify the re-arranged
sequence as a single repetitive element. REANNOTATE will
normally construct a separate model for any sequence segment violating colinearity with the reference. DNA rearrangements other than transposition (of an entire
element) pose challenges for TE annotation; for example,
if a segmental duplication has occurred within an element
that remained replication-competent and that subsequently
generated new copies, then for these new copies, colinearity with the reference element (which does not contain the
duplication) is violated and two separate models are constructed. REANNOTATE does construct models of DNA rearrangements involving LTR-elements (which are based on
re-arrangements of the common structure of these elements). One of the purposes of such annotation is cautioning against the validity of dating such an element, as
the rearranged structure may be the result of inter-element
recombination. The occurrence of post-integration, interelement LTR recombination would invalidate the use of
intra-element LTR sequence divergence as a molecular
timer. It is also possible that inter-element LTR recombination may occur without altering the structure of the elements involved – in this case the re-arrangement will
remain undetected by the algorithm currently implemented in REANNOTATE. Nevertheless, the aligned
sequence data output by REANNOTATE can be used to
reconstruct the phylogeny of all LTRs within a family:
inter-element recombination would be detected if intraelement LTRs did not cluster on the phylogeny. There is
scope for future implementation of algorithms for
improving the detection and annotation of recombination, segmental duplication, and inversion events involving repetitive elements.

Conclusion
REANNOTATE improves repetitive element annotation of
genomic sequences by constructing models of evolutionary events involving dispersed repeats. Currently, automated repetitive element annotation is largely limited by
default use of REPEATMASKER output, which reports
genomic regions that have sequence similarity to known
repeats. REANNOTATE is ready to post-process existing
annotation or to be incorporated into annotation pipelines that use REPEATMASKER. REANNOTATE processes the
similarity annotation to infer the common origin of dispersed repetitive sequences, resolve complex nesting patterns, and date insertion events LTR-elements with a
detectable structure. These analyses become possible even
in genomic regions with a high-density of repeats, such as
heterochromatin. The annotation and repetitive element
model sequences output by REANNOTATE therefore provide automated paleontology of complex repeats and,
consequently, their host genomes, as the evolution (and
possibly some function) of genomes is linked to their
repetitive content.
