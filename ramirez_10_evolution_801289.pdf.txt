Abstract
Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. DENV are
comprised of four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 through DENV-4) and each serotype can be divided in different
genotypes. Currently, there is a dramatic emergence of DENV-3 genotype III in Latin America. Nevertheless, we still
have an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary forces underlying the evolution of this genotype in this
region of the world. In order to gain insight into the degree of genetic variability, rates and patterns of evolution
of this genotype in Venezuela and the South American region, phylogenetic analysis, based on a large number
(n = 119) of envelope gene sequences from DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela from 2001 to 2008,
were performed.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed an in situ evolution of DENV-3 genotype III following its introduction in the
Latin American region, where three different genetic clusters (A to C) can be observed among the DENV-3
genotype III strains circulating in this region. Bayesian coalescent inference analyses revealed an evolutionary rate
of 8.48 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year (s/s/y) for strains of cluster A, composed entirely of strains isolated in
Venezuela. Amino acid substitution at position 329 of domain III of the E protein (A®V) was found in almost all
E proteins from Cluster A strains.
Conclusions: A significant evolutionary change between DENV-3 genotype III strains that circulated in the initial
years of the introduction in the continent and strains isolated in the Latin American region in recent years was
observed. The presence of DENV-3 genotype III strains belonging to different clusters was observed in Venezuela,
revealing several introduction events into this country. The evolutionary rate found for Cluster A strains circulating
in Venezuela is similar to the others previously established for this genotype in other regions of the world. This
suggests a lack of correlation among DENV genotype III substitution rate and ecological pattern of virus spread.

Background
Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae.
DENV are mosquito-borne flaviviruses with a singlestranded, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA genome of
approximately 11 kb in length [1]. Dengue viruses are
comprised of four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 through

DENV-4), which are transmitted to humans through the
bites of two mosquito species: Aedes aegypti and Aedes
albopictus [2].
DENV causes a wide range of diseases in humans,
from the acute febrile illness dengue fever (DF) to lifethreatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock
syndrome (DHF/DSS). Dengue has spread throughout
tropical and subtropical regions worldwide over the past
several decades, with an estimated 100 million infections
and tens of millions of cases occurring annually [3].
Currently, there is a dramatic re-emergence of DENV in

Latin America and an alarming increase of DF and
DHF/DSS cases in this region [4].
Based on sequence analysis of the E/NS1 region, and
using a cut-off of 6% divergence, each DENV serotype
can be divided in different genotypes [5]. In the case of
DENV-3, this serotype has been divided into four genotypes (I-IV) [6-8], sometimes including a genotype V [9].
Recent findings have demonstrated the emergence and
global spread of DENV-3 genotype III [8]. The emergence of DHF in Sri Lanka in 1989 coincided with the
appearance there of a new DENV-3, genotype III variant, which spread from the Indian subcontinent into
Africa and Latin America [8]. Sri Lankan DENV-3 genotype III and associated American isolates have been
linked to severe disease epidemics [10].
Phylogenetic analyses have elucidated the origins and
forces underlying the molecular evolution of DENV in
different geographic regions of the world [11]. Nevertheless, we still have an incomplete understanding of the
dispersion and evolutionary history of DENV-3 genotype
III in the South American region.
The objective of the present study was to gain insight
into the degree of genetic variability, rates and patterns
of evolution of this genotype in Venezuela and the
South American region based on the analysis of a large
number (n = 119) of envelope (E) gene sequences of
DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela from
2001 to 2008.

Results
Genetic variability of DENV-3 genotype III circulating in
Venezuela

In order to gain insight into the degree of genetic variability of DENV-3 genotype III strains circulating in
Venezuela, 29 Venezuelan DENV-3 genotype III E gene
sequences representing strains isolated between 2000
and 2007 in seven different Venezuelan geographic locations, were aligned with 58 sequences from DENV-3
genotype III E gene of DENV isolated in Latin America
and 11 DENV-3 sequences from strains isolated
elsewhere representing other DENV-3 genotypes (for
strains included in these studies see Additional File 1,
Table S1).
Once aligned, we first identified the optimal evolutionary model that best represent our sequence dataset
(Akaike Information Criteria and Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test indicated that the GTR+Γ model fit the
sequence data). Using this model, maximum likelihood
phylogenetic trees were constructed and the robustness
of each node of the tree was assessed by approximate
Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT). The results of these studies are shown in Figure 1.
All strains in the tree are assigned according to their
genotype. Genotype III strains cluster together, strains

belonging to other DENV-3 genotypes cluster separately
(see Figure 1). These clusters are supported by very high
values of aLRT. Inside genotype III cluster, three different clades can be observed for strains isolated in South
America: one composed exclusively by strains isolated in
Venezuela (Cluster A; Figure 1, bottom); one composed
by strains isolated in Martinique, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay (Cluster B; Figure 1, middle); and one composed
by strains isolated mainly in Ecuador and Peru (Cluster
C; Figure 1 top). Clusters B and C also include strains
isolated in the Caribbean region. Previous strains isolated in Nicaragua, Panama and Mexico from 1994 to
2000 were assigned to a different cluster inside genotype
III (see Figure 1, middle). These strains circulated in the
initial years after the introduction of DENV-3 genotype
III in the continent, but show a great divergence with
recent Latin American strains. This reflects a significant
evolutionary change among strains isolated in the initial
years and recent strains.
Interestingly, strains isolated in Venezuela are not only
assigned to Cluster A, but also to Clusters B (strain
DENV-3/VE/BID-V911/2001) and C (strains DENV-3/
VE/BID-V1593/2005 and Gua2007), revealing at least
three different introduction events of DENV-3 genotype
III in that country (see Figure 1). The results of these
studies also show the diversification of DENV-3 genotype III circulating in South America in three different
genetic lineages (see Figure 1).
In order to confirm these findings, the same studies
were done using a dataset containing all the 119
DENV-3 genotype III sequences isolated in Venezuela
(for strains included in these studies see Additional
File 1, Table S1). Using this dataset, we have found
that apart from the three strains mentioned, the rest of
the 119 DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela were assigned to Cluster A (Additional File 2,
Fig. S2).
Diversification of DENV-3 genotype III in the South
American region

In order to gain insight into the diversification of
DENV-3 genotype III in the South American region,
full-length E protein amino acid sequences from strains
isolated in Venezuela, representative of the three genotype III clusters observed, were aligned.
DENV-3 E protein resembles its homolog of DENV-2
in its dimeric structure and in the details of its protein
folding [12]. Each monomer consists of three domains:
domain I, an eight-stranded b-barrel, which organizes
the structure; domain II, which contains 12 b-strands
and two a-helices; and domain III, which is an IgG-like
domain, with 10 b-strands. In solution and in the crystals, two monomers of E assemble head to tail to form a
dimer [13].

Figure 2 Alignment of E protein ectodomain amino acid sequences from DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela. Strains are
listed by their names on the left side of the figure, and the cluster to which the strain is assigned is indicated between parentheses (see also
Fig. 1). Only one strain of each cluster is shown (for detailed results of substitutions found in the rest of the Venezuelan strains see Additional
File 2, Table S2). Identity to strain FJ639750 (DENV-3/VE/BID-V2179/2000) is indicated by a dash. Amino acid positions (relative to strain FJ639750)
are shown by numbers at the top of the alignment. Sequences corresponding to E protein domains I, II and III are shown in red, yellow and
light blue, respectively. Surface-exposed sequences previously identified on the dimeric DENV-3 protein are shown by a black diamond. Potential
ELK/KLE-type and KELK/KLEK-type motifs are shown by a star. Asparagine at position 388 is shown by a white circle. Amino acid residues
recently identified to be critical for neutralization by complex-reactive monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) on domain III of DENV-3 are indicated by a
black circle [43].

As shown in Figure 2, Cluster A strains (composed
entirely by genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela)
present an amino acid substitution in position 329
(A®V), while strains from Clusters B and C share an
Alanine at this position (see Figure 2, domain III). Interestingly, Cluster C strains present an amino acid substitution at position 132 (Y®H) with respect to Clusters A
and B strains (see Figure 2, domain I), in a region previously described to be exposed at the surface of the
protein [14]. Besides, the unique Venezuelan strain
assigned to Cluster B present an amino acid substitution
at position 346 (N®S) (see Figure 2, domain III). An
asparagine (N) at position 388 was found in all strains
included in these studies (see Figure 2). Previous studies
in DENV-2 have shown that an N at this position
appears to be associated to increased incidences of
hemorrhagic fever (see Figure 2, domain III) [15].
These studies were repeated using all the 119
sequences of DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in
Venezuela. The same conclusions were obtained using
this dataset (for detailed results of substitutions found in
these strains in nucleotide and/or amino acids
sequences, see Additional File 3, Table S2).
Mapping of amino acid substitutions found in DENV-3
genotype III of strains circulating in the South American
region

In order to map the amino acid substitutions found on
the E protein structure of DENV-3 genotype III strains
of the three clusters identified in this study, we
employed the PDB ProteinWorkshop 3.6 [16], using as a

reference the E protein structure of DENV-3 strain
DENV-3/TH/CH53489D73-1/1973 [12]. The results of
these studies are shown in Figure 3.
Amino acid substitution at position 329 of domain III,
found in Cluster A strains, is situated in previously identified surface-exposed amino acids in DENV-3 E protein
[12,13,17]. The amino acid at position 132 of domain II
is also exposed on the surface of the E protein (see Figure 3) [14].
Bayesian coalescent analysis of DENV-3 genotype III
Cluster A strains

In order to gain insight into the evolutionary rate and
mode of evolution of DENV-3 genotype III circulating
in Venezuela, we used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) approach as implemented in the BEAST
package [18], to analyze E gene sequences of DENV-3
genotype III of strains included in Cluster A (see Figure 1).
The results shown in Table 1 are the outcome of the
analysis for 20 million steps of the MCMC, using the
GTR+Γ model, a relaxed clock [19] and the expansion
population growth model [20].
As shown in Table 1, our results suggest that Cluster
A, entirely composed by strains circulating in Venezuela,
evolved from ancestors that existed around 1998. When
the GTR+Γ model is used, a mean rate of 8.48 × 10-4
nucleotide substitution per site per year was obtained
for Cluster A strains (Table 1). This rate is similar to
the ones obtained in similar studies for DENV-2 genotype III and DENV-4 genotype II (8.0 × 10-4 and 8.3 ×
10-4 substitutions/site/year, respectively) circulating in

Discussion
After an absence of 17 years from the Latin American
region, DENV-3 re-emerged in Central America in 1994
[23], and continue to expand into South America
[8,17,24-32]. Previous studies have shown that this
emerging DENV-3 is a genotype III variant of Asiatic
origin [8,24-26,33]. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis presented in these studies reveal an in situ evolution
of DENV-3 genotype III following its introduction in
the Latin American region, where three different genetic
clusters can be observed in DENV-3 genotype III strains
circulating in the South American region (Figure 1). In
addition, we observed a significant evolutionary change
between DENV-3 genotype III strains that circulated in
the initial years of the introduction in the continent
(1994-2000) and strains isolated in the Latin American
region in recent years (see Figure 1).
In this study, the evolution of DENV-3 genotype III in
Venezuela was extensively analyzed. DENV-3 cases from
Venezuela were first reported in the central region of
the country [26]. Previous studies have proposed that a
characteristic of dengue in Venezuela is that the outbreaks were first reported in neighboring countries, specifically in Central America and the Caribbean Islands,
and then the epidemic spread northwards to Mexico
and southern United States and southwards into South
America. Therefore, the introduction of DENV-3 strains
into Venezuela is more likely to have occurred as the
result of the spread of strains circulating in Central

Ramírez et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:329
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/329

America or the Caribbean islands and not to direct
introduction or importation of Asiatic strains [26]. The
phylogenetically closest strain to the earliest (year 2000)
DENV-3 Venezuelan isolates is in fact an 1999 isolate
from the geographically close Aruba island. This is in
agreement with the results of this study, since strains
isolated in Venezuela have been found in all genetic
clusters of DENV-3 genotype III reported in this work
(see Figure 1). Moreover, the presence of DENV-3 genotype III strains belonging to different clusters was
observed in Venezuela in different years (2001, 2005 and
2007, see Figure 1). This reveals that several introduction events of DENV-3 genotype III strains take place in
this country. Since the traveling history of the patients
from which these isolates were obtained is not known,
we cannot determine if these three isolates correspond
simply to imported cases or form part of the circulation
of minor variants that remain undetectable due to a low
number of isolates available.
Nevertheless, the predominant type of DENV-3 strains
circulating in Venezuelan belongs to cluster A (Figure
1). This cluster include strains isolated in Aragua State
along several years (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006,
2007 and 2008), the rest of the strains having been isolated in several different geographic locations of Venezuela (Miranda, Monagas, Guarico, Lara and Cojedes
States, and the Distrito Federal). Previous studies suggested that DENV-3 is evolving at a rate of 9.0 × 10-4
substitutions/site/year (s/s/y) [34]. Very recent studies
using much larger datasets revealed a similar rate (8.9 ×
10 -4 s/s/y) [33]. This is in agreement with the results
found in this study for DENV-3 genotype III cluster A
strains entirely composed of strains isolated in Venezuela (8.48 × 10-4 s/s/y, see Figure 1 and Table 1). Evolutionary rates for DENV-3 genotype III isolated
elsewhere revealed roughly similar figures (11.6 × 10-4 s/
s/y [34], 10.3 × 10-4 s/s/y [22] and 8.2 × 10-4 s/s/y [33].
The differences between these estimations are probably
due to the different number of sequences used in the
studies, although lay within the confidence intervals of
the estimations.
It has been previously suggested that the ecological
conditions for DENV dissemination may alter the viral
evolutionary rate among dengue lineages [34]. Nevertheless, the results of this study revealed that the main evolutionary rate found for DENV-3 genotype III Cluster A
strains circulating in Venezuela (8.48 × 10 -4 s/s/y) is
similar to others determined in different regions of the
world, as well as for other serotypes. This suggests a
lack of correlation among DENV genotype III substitution rate and ecological pattern of virus spread, in agreement with recent results [33].
The results of these studies suggest that Cluster A
Venezuelan strains evolved from ancestors that existed

Page 6 of 9

around 1998 (1996-2000) (see Table 1). This result is
consistent with very recent studies on DENV migration
that suggests DENV-3 genotype III was introduced into
the Americas through Mexico where this genotype was
first isolated in 1995 [33], and a rapid spread to other
countries in the region.
Amino acid substitution at position 329 of domain III,
found in E proteins from Cluster A strains isolated in
Venezuela, is situated in previously identified surfaceexposed amino acids in DENV-3 E protein [12,13] (see
Figure 3). Substitutions at this position have also been
found in DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Ecuador and Peru [17]. This alanine (Ala)-to-valine (Val)
substitution implies a change of a hydrophobic amino
acid by another hydrophobic but aliphatic amino acid.
While most amino acids contain only one non-hydrogen
substituent attached to their C-beta carbon, Val contains
two. This means that there is a lot more bulkiness near
the protein backbone. Whether this may permit the
virus to escape immune recognition or neutralization
remains to be established.

Conclusions
A significant evolutionary change between DENV-3 genotype III strains that circulated in the initial years of the
introduction in the continent and strains isolated in the
Latin American region in recent years was observed.
The presence of DENV-3 genotype III strains belonging
to different clusters was observed in several years. This
fact reveals that several introduction events of DENV-3
genotype III strains take place in this country. The main
evolutionary rate found for Cluster A strains circulating
in Venezuela is similar to others previously established
for this genotype in other regions of the world, as well
as for other serotypes. This fact is in agreement with
recent studies that suggest a lack of correlation among
DENV genotype III substitution rate and ecological pattern of virus spread. Although a high degree of genetic
variation has been observed among the three different
clusters of DENV-3 genotype III strains circulating in
the Latin American region, the E protein of these strains
is relatively well conserved among all clusters.
More studies will be needed to characterize all DENV3 genotype III clusters circulating in the Latin American
region. This will permit to design appropriate anti-viral
strategies against DENV infection.
Methods
Viruses

The new sequences of the E gene reported in this study
are from Venezuelan strains of DENV-3, originally isolated in the “Department of Virology” from the “Instituto Nacional de Higiene Rafael Rangel - INHRR,
Caracas, Venezuela, and from the “Laboratorio Regional

Ramírez et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:329

de Diagnóstico e Investigación del Dengue y Otras
Enfermedades Virales - LARDIDEV, Maracay, Venezuela.
Acute-phase sera of patients identified as infected with
DENV-3 using an established RT-PCR Multiplex protocol [35], were used to infect monolayers of the Aedes
albopictus cell line C6/36. After growth for 7 days at
32°C, virus-infected supernatants were collected, clarified
by centrifugation and stored at -70°C until use.
RNA extraction and PCR amplification

Viral RNA was extracted from 280 μl supernatant medium of virus-infected cells using the QIAamp® Viral
RNA System, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen®, Chatsworth, CA, USA). Viral RNA was reverse
transcribed to cDNA first strand in a 50-μl reaction
final volume with Superscript II reverse transcriptase
system (Invitrogen) and pd(N)6 random primers (Invitrogen, USA) or a specific primer (Additional File 4,
Table S3). Reverse transcription was allowed to proceed
at 42°C for 90 min followed by reverse transcriptase
inactivation at 70°C for 15 min. cDNA amplification was
performed with synthetic primers listed in Supplementary Material Table 1. Both sense and antisense primers
were used to amplify a fragment containing the E coding region on the viral RNA. The reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 50 μL, 2 to 10 μL of the
cDNA, 1 mmol/L of MgSO4, 0.3 mmol/L of each dNTP,
0.2 μmol/L of each sense an antisense primers, and 2.5
U of platinum® pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The
amplification was carried out in a thermal cycler
(Eppendorff) as follows: 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 1.5 min, and 68°C for 2.5 min, followed
by a final incubation at 68°C for 5 minutes. Each PCR
was run with positive and negative controls and the
fragments were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and
detected under ultraviolet light.
Amplicon purification and sequencing reactions

Amplicons were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit from QIAGEN, according to instructions from
the manufacturers. The sequence reaction was carried
out using the Big Dye DNA sequencing kit (PerkinElmer) on a 373 DNA sequencer apparatus (PerkinElmer). Alternatively, sequences were obtained from
purified amplicons through a commercial sequencing
service (Macrogene Inc, Seoul, Korea). Both strands of
the PCR product were sequenced in order to avoid discrepancies. The E gene nucleotide sequences obtained
from the DENV-3 Venezuelan strains were deposited in
the GenBank Database under accession numbers [GenBank:HM348812] through [GenBank:HM348831], (see
also Additional File 1, Table S1). Previously reported E
gene sequences from DENV-3 isolated in Venezuela

Page 7 of 9

were obtained by means of the Virus Variation Database
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) [36] (for strains names and accession numbers
see Additional File 1, Table S1).
Sequence Datasets

Different datasets were constructed to perform phylogenetic analyses. One included all DENV-3 genotype III E
gene sequences isolated in Venezuela (n = 119) between
2000 and 2008, as well as 58 sequences from DENV-3
genotype III E gene of DENV isolated in Latin America
and 11 DENV-3 sequences from strains isolated elsewhere representing other DENV-3 genotypes. We created another dataset that includes 29 selected
Venezuelan DENV-3 genotype III E gene sequences representing strains isolated in seven different Venezuelan
geographic locations between 2000 and 2007 and the
same other strains, isolated elsewhere, included in the
former dataset (for strain names and accession numbers,
see Additional File 1, Table S1). For the selection of the 29
sequences of the latter dataset, we considered several
variables in order to avoid biases in our results, including
avoiding the presence of duplicates.
Phylogenetic analysis

Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program
[37]. Once aligned, we first tested whether a recombination event occurred on any of the sequences used in
these studies. We used two approaches implemented in
the SimPlot Program [38]: 1) a sliding window analysis
of distances and 2) the bootscanning [39]. No recombinant strains were found in the dataset (not shown).
The program Modelgenerator [40] was used to identify the optimal evolutionary model (Akaike Information
Criteria and Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test indicated
that the GTR+Γ model fit the sequence data). Using this
model, maximum likelihood trees were constructed
using software from the PhyML program [41] (for
details about the ML parameters, see Additional File 5,
Table S4). As a measure of the robustness of each node,
we employed an approximate Likelihood Ratio Test
(aLRT), that assesses that the branch being studied provides a significant likelihood gain, in comparison with
the null hypothesis that involves collapsing that branch
but leaving the rest of the tree topology identical [42].
In order to gain insight into the evolutionary rate and
mode of evolution of DENV-3 genotype III strains circulating in Venezuela, we used a Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as implemented in
the BEAST package v.1.4.8 [18], to analyze E gene
sequences of DENV-3 genotype III of strains included in
cluster A (Figure 1) isolated between 2000 and 2007.
Using the GTR+Γ model and 20 million steps of
MCMC, different population dynamic models were

Ramírez et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:329
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/329

tested (constant population size, exponential population
growth, expansion population growth, logistic population growth and Bayesian Skyline). Statistical uncertainty
in the data was reflected by the 95% highest probability
density (HPD) values. Results were examined using the
TRACER v1.4 program [43] from the BEAST package.
Convergence was assessed with ESS (effective sample
size) values after a burn-in of 2 million steps. Models
were compared by calculating the Bayes Factor (BF) [44]
from the posterior output of each of the models using
TRACER v1.4 program [42] as explained in BEAST
website http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Model_comparison. A
log BF (natural log units) > 2.3 indicates strong evidence
against the null model. The expansion population

Mapping of amino acid substitutions in DENV-3 E protein
3D structure

In order to map amino acid substitutions found in
Venezuelan DENV-3 genotype III E protein, crystallography data of the E protein of the strain DENV-3/TH/
CH53489D73-1/1973 [12] was imported from Protein
Data Bank [PDB:1uzg]. Visualization was done using
PDB ProteinWorkshop 3.6 [16].
