Abstract
Background: Glioblastoma is the most lethal primary malignant brain tumor. Although considerable progress has been
made in the treatment of this aggressive tumor, the clinical outcome for patients remains poor. Histone deacetylases
(HDACs) are recognized as promising targets for cancer treatment. In the past several years, HDAC inhibitors (HDACis)
have been used as radiosensitizers in glioblastoma treatment. However, no study has demonstrated the status of global
HDAC expression in gliomas and its possible correlation to the use of HDACis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
and compare mRNA and protein levels of class I, II and IV of HDACs in low grade and high grade astrocytomas and
normal brain tissue and to correlate the findings with the malignancy in astrocytomas.
Methods: Forty-three microdissected patient tumor samples were evaluated. The histopathologic diagnoses were 20
low-grade gliomas (13 grade I and 7 grade II) and 23 high-grade gliomas (5 grade III and 18 glioblastomas). Eleven normal
cerebral tissue samples were also analyzed (54 total samples analyzed). mRNA expression of class I, II, and IV HDACs was
studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and normalized to the housekeeping gene β-glucuronidase.
Protein levels were evaluated by western blotting.
Results: We found that mRNA levels of class II and IV HDACs were downregulated in glioblastomas compared to lowgrade astrocytomas and normal brain tissue (7 in 8 genes, p < 0.05). The protein levels of class II HDAC9 were also lower
in high-grade astrocytomas than in low-grade astrocytomas and normal brain tissue. Additionally, we found that histone
H3 (but not histone H4) was more acetylated in glioblastomas than normal brain tissue.
Conclusion: Our study establishes a negative correlation between HDAC gene expression and the glioma grade
suggesting that class II and IV HDACs might play an important role in glioma malignancy. Evaluation of histone acetylation
levels showed that histone H3 is more acetylated in glioblastomas than normal brain tissue confirming the
downregulation of HDAC mRNA in glioblastomas.

Background
Gliomas, the most common brain tumor, are currently
classified as astrocytic, ependymal, oligodendroglial and
choroid plexus tumors. Among astrocytic tumors, glioblastoma (World Health Organization grade IV [1]) is the
most lethal primary malignant brain tumor. Although
considerable progress has been made in its treatment, the
clinical prognosis associated with this tumor remains
poor.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have recently become recognized as a promising target for cancer therapy, including for the treatment of glioblastomas [2]. Together with
histone acetyltransferases (HATs), HDACs are responsible
for chromatin packaging, which influences the transcription process. In general, increased levels of acetylation
(high HAT levels) are associated with increased transcriptional activity, whereas decreased acetylation levels (high
HDAC levels) are associated with repression of transcription (reviewed in [3]). HDACs are classified into 4 major
categories based on their homology to yeast HDACs,
including structure and cellular localization (Figure 1).
Class I and class II HDAC proteins share a common enzymatic mechanism that is the Zn-catalyzed hydrolysis of

the acetyl-lysine amide bond. Human class I HDACs
includes HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8, which are enzymes similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3, generally
localized to the nucleus [4,5]. These enzymes are ubiquitously expressed (with the exception of HDAC8, which
has higher expression levels in the liver) and seems to
function as a complex with other proteins [6]. HDAC1
and -2 only show activity within a protein complex, which
consists of proteins necessary for modulating their
deacetylase activity and DNA binding, and the recruitment of HDACs to gene promoters [7]. Wilson AJ et al. [8]
have suggested that multiple class I HDAC members are
also involved in repressing p21 and that the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects induced by HDAC inhibitors
are probably mediated through the inhibition of multiple
HDACs.
Class II HDACs includes HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9a, -9b, and 10, which are homologous to yeast Hda1. These class II
enzymes can be found in the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting potential extranuclear functions by regulating the
acetylation status of nonhistone substrates [9,10]. HDAC
members of class II are abundantly expressed in skeletal
muscle, heart, brain, tissues with low levels of mitotic

activity [11,12]. Functionally, Class II HDACs is thought
to act as transcriptional corepressors by deacetylating
nucleosomal histones. These enzymes do not bind
directly to DNA; they are thought to be recruited to distinct regions of the genome by sequence specific DNA
binding proteins [13-15].
Class III HDACs is composed of the Sirtuins (SIRT) proteins 1–7, which are homologous to the yeast Sir2 protein
and require NAD+ for deacetylase activity in contrast to the
zinc-catalyzed mechanism used by class I and II HDACs
[16-18].
An additional HDAC expressed by higher eukaryotes is a
Zn-dependent HDAC (HDAC11 in mammals). This
enzyme is phylogenetically different from both class I and
class II enzymes and is therefore classified separately as
class IV [19] reviewed in [5].
The use of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) for the treatment
of cancer is an area of active investigation. In gliomas,
HDACis have been used for the treatment of glioblastoma
in combination with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Some authors have demonstrated that HDACis have
a radiosensitizing effect on glioblastoma cells in vitro and
in vivo [20-23] and also seem to be associated with inhibition of glioma cell growth by both cell-cycle arrest and
apoptosis [24-26]. Despite the widespread use of HDACis,
the mechanistic implications remain to be elucidated.
To this date, there are no studies that demonstrate the status of global HDAC gene expression and protein levels in
astrocytomas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
and compare mRNA and protein levels of class I, II and IV
of HDACs in low grade and high grade astrocytomas and
normal brain tissue and to correlate the findings with the
malignancy in astrocytomas.

Methods
Patients Samples
For this study, tumor samples of 43 patients (19 men and
24 women) ranging in age from 1.3 to 79 years (mean age
24.6 years, with a median and a standard deviation of
12.8 ± 22.6 years) were evaluated. The histopathologic
diagnoses were 20 low-grade gliomas (13 grade I and 7
grade II) and 23 high-grade gliomas (5 grade III and 18
glioblastomas). In addition, 11 samples of normal cerebral tissue were analyzed. Frozen tumor and normal specimens were microdissected. Diagnoses were based on
2007 World Health Organization criteria [1].

For tumor microdissection, tumor samples were placed
on a cooled platform and immediately positioned on the
cutting base of the cryostat under Tissue Tek (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA). After rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/243

the sample was cut and immediately captured on a coverslip, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated
by image apposition. The area of interest in the original
cryopreserved tumor block was then trimmed, and the
microdissected sample was transferred to a previously
identified tube, which was immediately placed under dry
ice.
Prior to initiation, the research here presented was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of University of
Sao Paulo, processes number 9375/2003 and 7645/99.
The mentioned Committee is in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration requirements for research carried out on
humans. Informed consent was also taken from each
patient (or their legal representative) involved in this
project, also in accordance to the Helsinki Declaration.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol® Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNA was reverse
transcribed to single-stranded cDNA using a High Capacity Kit (Applied Biossystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR)
Messenger RNA expression level for each HDAC was evaluated using an ABI 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Amplifications were obtained using
on demand TaqMan® probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) for each HDAC. For relative quantification
of gene expression, standard curves were constructed for
each gene by considering at least 3 points in triplicate of
10-fold serial dilution of cDNA in water, starting from
1:10 of a volume of undiluted cDNA transcribed from 1.0
μg of total RNA. The slopes of standard curves ranged
from -3.17 to -3.87. Blank and standard controls (calibrators) were run in parallel to verify amplification efficiency
within each experiment. To normalize differences in the
amount of total cDNA added to each reaction, β-glucuronidase (GUS β) gene expression was used as an endogenous control. As a calibrator sample (reference sample
for relative quantification), the U343 cell line was used.
To obtain the Ct (cycle) values, we established a threshold
of 0.1. All reactions were made in duplicate, and all procedures were carried out at 4°C.
Western Blotting
For protein analysis, 30 μg of each sample was loaded and
separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis [27]. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were then incubated in 1% Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST)
containing 5% (w/v) dried non-fat milk for 1 hour at

room temperature. The primary antibodies were diluted at
1:3000 in TBST containing 5% (w/v) milk: HDAC9
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Acetyl-Lys H3 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and Acetyl-Lys H4 (Upstate Biotechnology
Lake Placid, NY), and the membranes were incubated for
1 hour at room temperature, The membranes were then
washed 3 times with TBST, incubated with the secondary
antibody (1:5000 in TBST) labeled by horseradish peroxidase (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 1 hour at room temperature, and washed 3 times with TBST. The secondary
antibody was visualized using electron chemiluminescent
reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Films were exposed from
10 to 60 seconds and developed.
Statistical analysis
Comparison of gene expression between groups of tumor
was performed by nonparametric testes Mann-Whitney
and Kruskall-Wallis. The level of significance was set at p
< 0.05 in all analyses.

Results
Global expression of HDAC genes in gliomas and normal
brain tissue
The expression of 12 HDAC genes was analyzed using relative quantification of mRNA levels in normal brain,
astrocytomas grades I, II and III, and glioblastomas (Figure 2). Class I HDAC genes (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8)
showed lower levels of expression (relative expression of
0.5 to 6.0 approximately) compared to the other classes
studied. The highest values of expression for class I were
seen for HDAC8 (2.0 to 6.0). Expression of HDAC class II
and class IV were higher, with values of approximately 1.0
to 150.0. The highest level of mRNA was observed for
HDAC9a and HDAC9b, with relative expression reaching
values above 100 for normal brain tissue and grade I
astrocytomas; however, HDAC6 and HDAC7 showed levels of expression comparable with those of class I (approximately 1.0 and 3.0).

Table 1 shows the median values for each HDAC gene in
all groups analyzed. For class I, the highest median value
observed was 2.87 (HDAC8 in low-grade astrocytoma)
and the lowest median value was 0.62 (HDAC3 in astrocytoma grade III). For class II, the highest median was
61.51 (HDAC9b in normal brain) and the lowest was 0.56
(HDAC7 in glioblastoma). HDAC11, the only member of
class IV, had the lowest median value for normal brain tissue (3.67) and the highest for glioblastoma (1.02).
Comparison of the HDAC mRNA levels in low- and highgrade gliomas and normal brain tissue
We compared mRNA levels of HDAC genes (the medians
of relative expression) in low- and high-grade gliomas and
also in normal brain. Among class I HDACs, significant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/243

differences in gene expression between tumor groups were
not observed (Table 2).
Seven of 8 class II HDAC genes (exception for HDAC4)
were expressed at lower levels in high-grade astrocytomas
compared to low-grade astrocytomas (p < 0.05; Table 2).
The same significant difference for low-grade and highgrade gliomas was observed for HDAC11 (class IV).
We compared the most malignant form of astrocytoma
(glioblastoma) with the other 3 tumors (astrocytomas
grades I, II and III) and normal brain in order to establish
a correlation between HDAC expression and tumor grade
(Table 3). As mentioned above, no significant difference
in HDAC expression was observed for class I; however, for
classes II and IV, there was a decrease in expression of
these genes in glioblastoma compared to that in other
groups. Moreover, this downregulation appeared to follow a pattern in which lower-grade tumors had a larger
number of HDAC genes at lower expression levels. Comparison between glioblastoma and grade III astrocytoma
showed that 4 of 8 genes were expressed at lower levels in
glioblastoma samples (HDAC4, -6, -7, and -11). Comparison with low-grade astrocytoma (grades I and II) showed
that the expression of 6 of 8 genes was lower in glioblastomas (except for HDAC5 and -7). Finally, when we compared glioblastoma with normal brain, 7 of 8 genes
studied, with the exception of HDAC7, were expressed at
lower levels in glioblastoma.
Protein analysis: Acetyl H3 but not Acetyl H4 correlates
with mRNA levels
In order to validate the data obtained from qRT-PCR,
western blot analysis was performed for HDAC9b protein.
This protein was chosen because we found the highest levels of mRNA expression for HDAC9b. The results
obtained for HDAC9b western blot analysis confirmed
the data obtained in quantitative mRNA analysis. The protein levels of HDAC9a were higher in normal brain tissue
and low-grade astrocytoma than in the grade III astrocytoma and glioblastoma (Figure 3A).

Anti-acetyl histone H3 and anti-acetyl histone H4 antibodies were also used to verify the level of acetylated histones H3 and H4 and to correlate the findings with
histone deacetylase activity in the groups studied (Figure
3b).
Considering the large number of HDAC genes with low
levels of expression in glioblastomas, we expected that the
levels of acetylated histones were higher in those tumors.
Interestingly, when we analyzed the acetylation levels of
the H3 and H4 histones, H3 histone acetylation, but not
H4 histone acetylation, correlated with the data obtained
by qRT-PCR (Figure 3B). Glioblastoma samples showed

Discussion
In this study we evaluated and compared mRNA levels of
12 HDAC genes in astrocytomas and normal brain tissue.
As mentioned before, the acetylation levels of histones is
a process regulated by two groups of important enzymes:
HATs and HDACs, and the balance of the activities of

these two enzymes is tightly related to the gene expression
status in the cell. The regulation of HDACs has been studied, but is not yet well established. The reason for that is
maybe because HDACs seem to be regulated at multiple
levels including cellular compartmentalization, association with other factors, abundance, activity states and
genome-wide distribution.
Considering that altered gene expression is frequently
observed in cancer, a relationship between HDACs and
cancer progression has been postulated. Wade P. [3] suggested that loss of targeting of class I HDACs through disruption of a transcriptional corepressor and the
inappropriate redistribution of class II resulted in the misregulated gene expression in cancer.
Although a crucial role for HDACs in gene transcription
and their possible involvement in cancer has been proposed, no studies have demonstrated the expression profile of 3 classes of HDACs simultaneously in brain tumor.
Our study did not find differential gene expression of class
I HDACs in high-grade and low-grade gliomas which may
indicate that class of deacetylases seems to not be directly
involved with malignancy of gliomas. Only a few studies
have evaluated the level of class I HDAC expression in
cancer: Huang BH et al. [28] demonstrated that HDAC1
and HDAC2 seem to be upregulated in colon cancer; Choi
JH et al. [29] demonstrated an overexpression of HDAC1
mRNA 68% of gastric cancer tissues studied by them (17
of 25) and elevated expression of HDAC1 protein was also
detected in 61% of the gastric cancer samples (11 of 18).
Expression of class I HDAC3 was also shown elevated in
astrocytic glial tumors compared to nonmalignant gliosis

HDAC1 is significantly lower in colorectal cancer samples
in comparison to normal colorectal tissues.

HDAC expression and malignancy in gliomas. In agreement with our study, some authors have demonstrated
downregulation of these deacetylases and their relationship with prognosis in cancer as well. Ozdag H. et al. [31]
showed that HDAC5 and HDAC7 are significantly lower
in colorectal cancer samples in comparison to normal
colorectal tissues. These authors also showed downregulation of HDAC5 in renal tumors compared to normal renal
tissue. Downregulation of HDAC gene expression has also
been observed in lung cancer: reduced expression of class
II HDAC genes (mostly HDAC10) seems to be significantly associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that
class II HDACs may repress critical genes that may have
important roles in lung cancer progression [32]. Like in
our study, these authors demonstrated that class I HDACs
seem to have no correlation with malignancy of those
tumors.

used as endogenous control.

The downregulation of HDAC genes in cancer may be difficult to explain, since multiple factors are involved in the
regulation of these enzymes. Unlike class I HDACs, which
are predominantly localized in the nucleus, class II
HDACs actively shuttle between the cytoplasm and
nucleus being under control of classic cellular signaling
pathways, and cellular localizations represents a fundamental mechanism for them [12,14]. Additionally, class II
HDACs seem to have additional levels of regulation,
which makes elucidation of the mechanism of gene transcription regulation more complicated.
Our study seems to reveal the involvement of class II
HDACs in glioma malignancy. If we consider that, in general, increased levels of acetylation (downregulation of
HDACs) is related to higher transcriptional activity, we
could predict that gene transcription in malignant gliomas may be upregulated. In that case we could infer that
some proto-oncogenes might be overexpressed and somehow leading to the malignancy. The overexpression of
proto-oncogenes in gliomas has been well documented.
Besides EGFR, which is found overexpressed in 40% of gliomas, the genes N-MYC, C-MYC, PDGFR-α, MYB, K-RAS,
CDK-4 and MDM2 are the most commonly amplified
oncogenes in gliomas [33-37]. However, due to the fact
that these deacetylases are regulated at several levels, additional information about the functionality of HDACs in
gliomas is required.
In order to correlate mRNA and protein levels of HDACs,
we analyzed HDAC9 protein levels in all groups of tumors
studied. Western blot analysis showed that HDAC9 protein is expressed at a higher concentration in normal brain
and low-grade gliomas than in high-grade gliomas, validating the data obtained by real-time PCR.

We also evaluated HDAC activity by analyzing histone
acetylation levels in tumor samples and normal brain.
When we analyzed the levels of H3 and H4 acetylated histones, we observed an increased level in acetylation of H3
but not of H4 histone in glioblastomas compared to lowgrade astrocytomas and normal brain tissue. Considering
the low levels of HDAC expression in glioblastomas, it
was expected that the levels of acetylated histones should
be more elevated in those tumors, as demonstrated here
for histone H3. On the other hand, the lack of correlation
between low HDAC expression and high histone H4
deacetylation levels in glioblastomas could be explained
by the existence of cofactors or unidentified regulators.
Some few authors have already demonstrated that the specificity of HDACs depends on cofactors which makes
HDAC specificity a complicated process [38-41]. It is
tempting to speculate that class II of HDACs could be
responsible for deacetylation of histone H3 more than
histone H4. However, the data here presented are not
enough to infer about the specificity of HDACs in astrocytomas. Moreover, it has been observed that differences
between HDAC subtype specificity do not coincide with
the division into class I and class II enzymes. HDAC1,
HDAC3 (class I), and HDAC6 (class II) seem to be very
similar in substrate specificity and mainly differ in the
degree of specificity [39]. Until now, a lot of data has been
generated about HDAC research, but the natural substrates of different HDACs and their substrate specificities
is still not well understood.
The class IV HDAC11 enzyme seems to be an unusual
member of the HDAC family. Its sequence is not homologous to any other HDAC, and it may have distinct physiological roles. This enzyme, like members of the class II
HDACs is expressed more in brain, heart, skeletal muscle,
and kidney [19]. In our study, we also found high levels
of HDAC11 in normal brain tissue and significant differential expression was also observed for this enzyme in
low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Little is known about
this unique HDAC, and its relation to malignancy of gliomas is yet to be elucidated.
HDACis
Even considering that to evaluate the effect of HDAC
inhibitors in gliomas was not the aim of the present study,
the finding that most of the HDAC genes are downregulated in glioblastomas could lead us to consider that
HDACis may not be effective in the treatment of highgrade gliomas. Some studies have demonstrated radiosensitization of gliomas after HDACi treatment [21,22].
Therefore, despite the low levels of HDAC gene expression
in glioblastomas, HDACis seem to be potential therapeutical targets for glioma treatment. The explanation to this
may point to the existence of nonhistone substrates for
HDACs. Although histones are the most thoroughly stud-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/243

ied as HDAC substrates, several reports have shown that
HDACs are also responsible for the deacetylation of
diverse types of nonhistone proteins, including transcriptional factors, signal transduction mediators, and molecular chaperones (a summarized table of nonhistone
substrates for HDACs can be found in [2]). Additionally,
recent evidences suggest that modulation of gene expression through histone remodeling might not be the only
process responsible for the antiproliferative action of
HDACis [42,43]. Although the present study has demonstrated that most of HDACs genes are downregulated in
glioblastomas, no experiment was performed in order to
analyze the effect of HDAC inhibitors on glioma treatment, therefore the effect of these inhibitors on glioma
treatment should be addressed in a separate manuscript.

Conclusion
Our study has established a negative correlation between
HDAC gene expression and glioma grade, suggesting that
class II and class IV HDACs might play an important role
in glioma malignancy. This differential HDAC expression
may provide insight into development of novel treatment
approaches for this devastating disease. However, a more
complete understanding of the biological function and
specificity of the diverse HDAC isoforms and their
involvement in the cancer process is necessary.
