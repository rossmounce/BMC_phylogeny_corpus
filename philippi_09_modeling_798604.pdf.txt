Abstract
Background: The decision pro- or contra apoptosis is complex, involves a number of different
inputs, and is central for the homeostasis of an individual cell as well as for the maintenance and
regeneration of the complete organism.
Results: This study centers on Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis, and a complex and internally
strongly linked network is assembled around the central FasL-mediated apoptosis cascade.
Different bioinformatical techniques are employed and different crosstalk possibilities including the
integrin pathway are considered. This network is translated into a Boolean network (74 nodes, 108
edges). System stability is dynamically sampled and investigated using the software SQUAD. Testing
a number of alternative crosstalk possibilities and networks we find that there are four stable
system states, two states comprising cell survival and two states describing apoptosis by the
intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways, respectively. The model is validated by comparing it to
experimental data from kinetics of cytochrome c release and caspase activation in wildtype and Bid
knockout cells grown on different substrates. Pathophysiological modifications such as input from
cytomegalovirus proteins M36 and M45 again produces output behavior that well agrees with
experimental data.
Conclusion: A network model for apoptosis and crosstalk in hepatocytes shows four different
system states and reproduces a number of different conditions around apoptosis including effects
of different growth substrates and viral infections. It produces semi-quantitative predictions on the
activity of individual nodes, agreeing with experimental data. The model (SBML format) and all data
are available for further predictions and development.

Background

Results

The decision to undergo apoptosis is complex, ultimately
fatal for the cell and yet important for continued health
and proper regeneration of most tissues. As an example of
high medical relevance we investigate here the liver tissue.
A number of different studies already investigated and
modeled different pathways implicated in liver cell apoptosis [1-4]. We have started our analysis from an interesting observation in cultured hepatocytes: Depending on
the culture conditions, different pathways for apoptosis
are used. In vivo, hepatocytes use the so-called type II signaling pathway to apoptosis after stimulation with Fas ligand (FasL). However, in the presence of a collagen I
monolayer, primary mouse hepatocytes switch to the type
I signaling pathway in response to FasL. Whereas type II
uses mitochondrial signaling implying tBid formation
and cytochrome c release for effector caspase-3 activation,
the type I pathway is more direct, bypassing the mitochondrial components. When the cells are kept in suspension right after isolation, the signaling does not switch but
stays type II as in vivo [5]. We therefore inferred that this
switch most likely occurs due to a crosstalk between the
apoptosis and the collagen-integrin signaling pathways.
This prompted us to conduct a systematic search for different system states in liver cells regarding apoptosis.

Modeling
For a systematic investigation network data from genome
information, databases, sequence- and domain analysis as
well as network module analysis were compiled. We
established a comprehensive network of proteins
involved in the apoptosis signaling of hepatocytes including different nodes around key pathways of apoptotic signaling as well as a number of proteins implicated in
crosstalks (overview in Figure 1; details and interaction
maps for all the steady states in suppl. Material). Additional file 2: Table 1S lists all involved proteins, their
sequences as well as their domain compositions, labeling
key domains for apoptosis, for kinase signaling and executioner caspases. These interactions were taken into
account in the resulting model.

This study aims at integrating different apoptosis pathways (including those investigated in the studies cited
above) and considering a number of different crosstalk
possibilities in hepatocytes including different members
of the integrin pathway. The complete established network is first investigated by sequence and domain analysis
[see Additional File 1] and then turned into a Boolean network of activating and suppressing nodes. As for many
nodes of this network exact parameters or measurements
are not available, a global system stability analysis has
been performed applying the software SQUAD [6]. We
show that the complete network comprises four stable system states; two states of cell survival and two states of
apoptosis. In a next step, the model is qualitatively validated by experimental readout data such measuring caspase activities by fluorogenic substrates. It includes and
reproduces the system response behavior after modifications, such as knocking out the BH3-only protein Bid or
infecting the cells with cytomegalovirus.

The program SQUAD starts from a Boolean network
model of the system and subsequently uses a heuristic
algorithm for parameter estimation and systematic
parameter variation to count and collect all stable system
states. SQUAD turns the Boolean network into a dynamic
simulation, replacing the Boolean states for each node of
either 0 (off) or 1 (on) by a hysteresis curve to interpolate
all intermediate states for each node starting there with
similar basic assumptions for the exponential function
[see Additional file 2 for complete equation]. Briefly the
exponent h is set to 0,5 as default, but then consecutively
modified according to network connectivity for each specific node. The space is already in the Boolean network
equal to 2(number of nodes) for different network states, i.e. for
the full network with 74 nodes this corresponds to 274
states or roughly 1023 states. This algorithm (SQUAD) efficiently implements a reduced order binary decision diagram [7] and systematically explores the large solution
space. Table 1 shows that depending on the number and
kind of feedback loops there are networks with one, two
or four different system states. A positive feedback loop
doubles the amount of steady states and a negative feedback loop is responsible for the stabilization of a steady
state.

Overall, the presented model provides a comprehensive
system overview of the complex apoptosis signaling network, gives insights into its structural properties and can
serve as a first basis for more detailed kinetic modeling of
the complete network of signaling molecules in hepatocytes.

The network allows a systematic simulation and investigation of different system states. This also implies all crosstalk possibilities because the hepatocyte system may
switch from life to apoptosis via different pathways and
system states. Table 1 lists the different tested versions of
the network. For each topology the program SQUAD was
used to systematically test the number of stable states in
the network.

Twenty different versions of the model were analyzed [see
Additional file 2]. The complete model (A, all) shows four

different steady states (Table 2), characterized by additional components such as positive feedback loops
between Akt/PKB and PI3K, Bcl-2/xL and Stat3, as well as
by additional Akt substrates. To test for robustness, a Bid
KO model containing 73 nodes was tested and the same 4
steady states were obtained, yet modified in some of the
final concentrations (Table 3; compare with experimental
data on collagen shown later). Finally, based on these
results three models representing different viral infections
were additionally constructed (Table 1).
Model A was chosen for further investigations, as it nicely
captures the richness of different apoptotic states and
agrees with experimental data (see below). There are four
different system states. Steady state A1 represents the
mitochondrial/intrinsic pathway like it is for cells in suspension. Bcl-2 is inactive while all caspases are active,
additionally showing a cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. Steady state A2 shows the extrinsic pathway which
correlates to cells grown on collagen. Bcl-2 is active but it's
not interfering in the extrinsic pathway. State A3 and state
A4 mimic stable living cells. In both states AKT and NFκB

are active. The difference between these two states is the
activation or inactivation of Bcl-2 and Stat3. The choice
between both system modes should be cell type dependent, for instance regulation by the JAK/STAT3 pathway
and resulting Bcl-2 expression control in the non-apoptotic state is known for hematopoetic cells [8].
Verification and biological data
The signaling behavior of hepatocytes in suspension (Figure 2) or grown on collagen (Figure 3) correlates nicely
with the system switches predicted from the SQUAD simulation. SQUAD allows the systematic collection and
comparison of stability states of the system as well as transitions between them. The input for a respective node, i.e.
all interactions leading to its activation (1) or inactivation
(0), is systematically sampled and a decay term for its
inactivation is included (see also Materials and Methods).
When hepatocytes are stimulated with FasL (the node
changed from an inactive to an active ligand state), the
system simulates apoptosis starting from FasL stimulation. In the model for growth on collagen, cytochrome c
is not released (no activation by tBid, inhibition by Bcl-2/

the model.
In each upper panel (Figure 2A, Figure 3A) the behavior of
the key system nodes of the network is depicted in relation
to time, representing the downstream molecular components of the signaling pathway, i.e. stimulation with FasL,
survival signals, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, tBid formation, cytochrome c release and finally apoptosis induction. The values for system node states range between 0
(inactive) and 1 (active). The equations for the dynamic
simulations yield time courses which reproduce the experimental data well. Time units are set to hours.

The comparison of the calculated curves (Figure 2A) for
the expected readout with the observed readout shows a
good qualitative agreement (Figure 2B). Both also agree
quantitatively if the time scale is set to hours in the upper
panel. Maximal stimulation is reached after 4 hours both
by simulation and experiment (Figure 2). Whereas Figure
2A displays the behavior of the network for FasL stimulated primary hepatocytes cultured in suspension, Figure
3A depicts that for the cells grown on collagen. We show
for the latter condition that the dynamics modeled by our
SQUAD simulation involving the A2 system state (apoptosis on collagen, crosstalk inhibits mitochondrial pathway for apoptosis, Figure 3A, top) is well compatible with

the experimental readout from experiments with fluorogenic caspase substrates (Figure 3B, bottom) if the time
scale is again set to hours in the upper panel (Figure 3A,
simulation). Note the difference in the tBid curves,
because while there is an increase of tBid formation in Figure 2A, the tBid values value were at baseline. This is in
accordance with experimental data on the system [5].
Apoptosis was defined by the decline of the number of
surviving cells over time (Figure 2A, Figure 3A). Some of
the cells cultivated on collagen are predicted to be viable
by this model. This corresponds to the experimentally
determined system read-out (Figure 2B and Figure 3B).
The delay of apoptosis experimentally observed for cells
cultivated on collagen could also be modeled by a delay
for apoptosis in the simulation. The exact values for the
experimental data are given by Walter et al. [5]: Cytochrome c release is represented by a black line and was
measured by Western blotting. We carried these experiments out ourselves (DW, KF, CB) [see Additional file 2:
Experimental procedures]. In suspension there is prolonged release of cytochrome c and apoptosis. In contrast,

growth on collagen does not lead to release of cytochrome
c into the cytoplasm [see Additional file 2: Experimental
procedures]. The model reproduces this correctly. For suspension cells cytochrome c is released (Figure 2A), for
growth on collagen cytochrome c is at baseline and no
release of cytochrome c is obtained (Figure 3A). Both in
the experiment and the model (Figure 2) cytochrome c is
already strongly released into the cytosol of suspension
grown hepatocytes after 2 hours of FasL treatment, reaching a maximum after 4 hours (typical type II pathway as in
vivo). Collagen cultured hepatocytes, dying after 4 hours
according to experimental data, retain cytochrome c in the
mitochondria and do not release it into the cytosol upon
FasL treatment (Figure 3B), as is typical for the type I pathway. Caspase-8 activity reaches a maximum in suspension
cells after 3 hours of FasL treatment and stays high
throughout the experiment (Figure 2A). In collagen cultured cells (Figure 3A) caspase-8 activity reaches a plateau
after increasing for 4 hours. Our model is qualitative as it
does not include direct kinetic parameter input but
instead an exponential curve estimate by SQUAD to interpolate between inactive and active state for each network

node. However, the calculated values allow ratio estimates
between the activities of different nodes and, obviously,
whether they inhibit or promote signals in the network. In
particular, the qualitative behavior over time (Figure 3A)
including different behavior for different nodes is overall
correctly simulated and agrees with the experimental
observations such as the number of surviving cells or cytochrome c release (Figure 3B). The model also fits to further experimental data available on the qualitative
differences concerning tBid formation, caspase-8 activation, the release of some cytochrome c after about 3 hours
[5] and caspase-9 activity levels which first increase below
the value in Figure 3A, but then return to zero.

Simulation of a viral infection
As an example for medical application we investigated the
blocking of cell death by viral interference. We used
model A and added key nodes interacting under cellular
infection by cytomegalovirus. The interacting viral proteins are M36 and M45 [9-11]. Such viral protein interventions (a pathological way of crosstalk) are a good example
for interference with the system pathways by many conceivable ways including also therapeutic intervention
such as siRNAs and different drugs. Again, the steady state
analysis following these modifications shows a system
with four steady states if neither M36 nor M45 are activated or expressed.

SQUAD samples the whole system and its stability which
is the key for biological system insights and thereby outweighs that it is semi-quantitative. Individual subnetworks do not offer the integrated system view and
analysis. Including these data this can be refined using
quantitative models with specific ODEs for each component. However, this requires detailed parameter estimates
often not (yet) available. Moreover, SQUAD additionally
allows for a systematic exploration of other influences
which lead to different system states.

However, when M36 or M45 are activated, only the
blocked apoptotic, continuous viable state remains. There
are two different ways to establish this system state:
(i) The cytomegalovirus protein M36 blocks the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by enhancing the survival
function of Bcl-2. The stable system state corresponding to
this inhibition is shown in Additional file 2: Table 4S and
predicts the following nodes to be active/inactive: Bcl-2/xL
(active), Bid, Casp-10, Casp-3, Casp-6, Casp-7, Casp-8,

Casp-9, DFF40, DFF45 (all inactive). Also this system state
nicely correlates with data from the literature [9-11].
(ii) M45 (blue in Figure 4) blocks the apoptotic pathway
via RIP1 (cyan, Figure 4), which is a crucial protein kinase
of the death receptor complex. M45 blocks the monoubiquitination of RIP1, which results in a second viral
intervention to prevent apoptosis in the infected cell if the
first break (enhancing the survival function of Bcl-2) is circumvented by the host defense. This activation of an alternative apoptosis block is simulated by our model (Figure
4A hepatocytes without virus versus Figure 4B with the
virus). M45 blocks in Figure 4B the TNFα-induced, caspase-independent cell death by binding to RIP1 and binding does not require TNF-R1 or TRAF2/5 as shown
previously [11]. M45 inhibits caspase-independent cell
death and as a consequence also the activation of p38
MAPK. Furthermore, the predicted readout (e.g. NFκB,
IκBα) fits well to experimental data obtained during viral
infection (e.g. Figure 3, pp 3095-3096, [11]). Note again
that no parameter fitting to the experimental values was
done or used for the time course prediction.

Discussion
System behavior
The hepatocyte provides a fascinating and complex model
to investigate cellular system states concerning apoptosis
and survival or proliferation. In several previous studies
on this topic, the authors either looked at the dynamics of
signaling cascades [1,4], at individual key signaling
switches [12] or at the possibility of a bistable apoptosis
system regarding caspase activation and the roles of Bax,
Bcl-2 and mitochondrial transition pores [2,3]. Here we
have chosen a different approach by first investigating system topology and individual nodes to establish a Boolean
network of the interacting components and then turning
these interactions into a dynamical simulation to answer
which stable system states are possible.

We started our analysis with FasL-mediated apoptosis signaling in primary hepatocytes. The network was then
extended and systematically explored. In particular, signaling crosstalks triggered by different growth conditions,
cell-cell contacts and the attachment to collagen monolayers were included. The survival signaling kinase AKT and
its up- and downstream partners PI3K, mTor, MEKK1 and
DAXX were considered. The inhibitory role of AKT on
apoptosis induction agrees well with recent cell biology
data [13]. Furthermore we looked at sub-networks acting
during early phases of FasL-mediated signaling (Fas, FasL,
FADD, caspase-8), during the effector phase of apoptosis
(XIAP, caspase-3 and feedback towards caspase-8), at
branching points between apoptosis and proliferation
(NFκB, IκBα, SUR, IKK), within the caspase signaling cascade (caspase-10, caspase-3, caspase-6), during type II

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/97

death receptor signaling (caspase-8, tBid formation, caspase-9, Bcl-2/xL) and during viral interference of apoptosis (proteins M36 and M45 from cytomegalovirus).
Thereby, we established an overview of surrounding network interactions modifying the classical FasL-mediated
apoptosis pathway. Besides network topology this step of
the analysis also included all protein sequences involved
as well as their specific domain compositions.
By applying the simulation tool SQUAD this network of
nodes was next turned into a Boolean network. As
detailed kinetic data on these numerous interacting components are not yet available, we instead applied a systems biology approach to study system stability. In
particular we systematically studied how many stable system states are available to the system and how these states
change with the alterations of the accessible nodes.
As stated above, the full network with 74 nodes could theoretically encode up to 274 states or roughly 1023 states.
However, we could show that in the hepatocyte model
there are only four stable system states predicted with reasonable robustness, 2 apoptotic and 2 non apoptotic
ones. We tried out different models [see Additional file 2:
Table S5] distinguishing between hub nodes (for example
tBid and PI3K) and less important nodes (for example
NIK). Addition or removal of hub nodes had influence on
the system robustness (it did change the number of steady
states) as well as an additional interaction between survival and apoptosis (inhibition of each other). Changes of
less important nodes had no influence on the systems
behavior and these predictions are robust (there is no variation if several nodes are added or removed). Errors in
Boolean logic did affect the network output, but again system stability and number and type of stable states did
only change if hub nodes were wrongly connected. In
steady state A1 we observed activation of the intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, characterized by a
caspase-dependent signaling cascade along with caspase-8
mediated tBid cleavage and cytochrome c release. Steady
state A2 is also apoptotic but bypasses mitochondrial
components and therefore leads to the direct activation of
caspase-3 by caspase-8. In state A2, both Bcl-2/xL and Stat3
seem to be active, while they are inactive in steady state
A1. One of the system's non-apoptotic states is steady
state A3. Hereby Akt is active and triggers a survival pathway via NFκB activation and other survival signals that
does not lead to apoptosis. In steady state A4, Akt is also
active inducing the same survival signaling pathway as in
A3, but whereas in A3 Bcl-2/xL and Stat3 are inactive, they
are active in A4.
Validation
System transitions which are modeled qualitatively and
semi-quantitatively agree well with the direct experimen-

tal system read-out data. We can achieve here only semiquantitative results as no exact kinetics are incorporated
in the SQUAD simulation. However, the simulations (Figure 2A, Figure 3A) qualitatively fit the experimental data.
Setting the time scale to hours the data even agree semiquantitatively, e.g. for the time course of cell survival (Figure 2B, Figure 3B) and, as known from further experiments, for the activity of caspase-8 and Bid as well as the
growth condition dependent time course of caspase-9
activation. Alternative models applying detailed parameter kinetics and focusing on different sub-networks provide results which nicely correspond to the experimental
data. However, these (e.g. [1,3,4]) did not consider different crosstalk possibilities and input from other system
nodes (e.g. viral proteins) as detailed and incorporated
here. The detailed kinetic SQUAD simulation, its data and
the Boolean network are available for any user for further
research and detailed comparisons.
After we saw that the model at least qualitatively encapsulates central system states, is robust, and agrees semiquantitatively with experimental data, we next studied
network modifications by viral interference. The predicted

system behavior is also well compatible with the experimental results obtained [11]. Our model considers the
system response of six receptors: Fas, IGFR, IL-3R, IL-1R,
TNF-R1 and TRAIL-R. As far as the variety of crosstalks
depicted above is concerned, they show distinct responses
to external signals. Furthermore, proliferation and apoptosis protein nodes are distinguishable and behave differently in states A1 to A4. A good example for this is Akt. It
is active in steady states 3 and 4 and inactive in steady
states 1 and 2. As a further control for the correct system
implementation we considered Bid KO cells (Table 3) and
the simulation result also corresponds with the experimental readout data.
Extensions
The strength of our model relies on the large scale exploration of networks by combining sequence/domain and
topological network analyses and applying SQUAD for
system state sampling. Further crosstalk behavior can be
easily simulated, as well as alternative and/or larger networks. It should of course be noted, that convergence
problems may occur with SQUAD regarding sampling of
very large networks (over 150 nodes). The domain analy-

sis (Additional file 2: Table 1S) allows to quickly detect
phylogenetic conservation of the numerous nodes as well
as key domains involved in the respective pathway and
function based extension of the Boolean network. Moreover, for a detailed refined model domains and sequences
can be used to check for potential modifications such as
phosphorylation and the formation of protein complexes
and regulatory interactions.
Enlargement of the network model did not lead to more
than 4 distinctive system states. Two types of apoptotic
pathways can be distinguished besides two non-apoptotic
pathways (state 1). The non-mitochondrial extrinsic pathway corresponds to state 2. The intrinsic pathway is active
in steady state 1. The survival pathway comes in two flavors, one involving activation by Bcl-2 and similar effectors (state 4) or without them (state 3). With regard to
interfering signals, AKT clearly seems to play the role of a
centrally located turntable in the system. Some AKT substrates are activated (mTOR, PI3K, MKK4 and ask1) but
others are inactive (DAXX and MEKK1) in the model. Further possibilities for cross-input involve receptors or the
titration of anti-apoptotic factors such as FLIP.

Conclusion
Apoptosis of liver cells is dependent on external signals
such as components of the extracellular matrix and cellcell-contacts, which are processed by a variety of numerous nodes of which several are examined here for their
system effects. Despite different input interferences and
presumably also due to natural selection, the system nevertheless appears to be optimized to adopt a small
number of clear and distinguishable states, and the various inputs and crosstalk mechanisms only optimize the
best choice between them. In our model we found two
non-apoptotic and two apoptotic states, although the
degree of activation at a node can differ widely until the
absolute system state is altered. The model is still an oversimplification of the complete cellular network and its different states, and operates independently of detailed
kinetic data and parameters for individual nodes. Nevertheless, it allows modeling the readout of apoptosis after
FasL stimulation with qualitative agreement and includes
crosstalks from collagen/integrin signaling, the effect of
genetic deletion of Bid and the consequences of viral
infection.
The complete simulation is freely available (executable,
source code, protein sequences, generated models). We
are confident that our simplified hepatocyte apoptosis
crosstalk model will be exploited for further investigations
which should include, besides a systems biology analysis,
a more detailed experimental analysis of the various crosstalks (viral infection, Bid KO, collagen/integrin crosstalk,
AKT substrates, FLIP titration).

Methods
Network setup
For the creation of the network, we used expert knowledge
and databanks such as KEGG for a collection of known
network nodes to get a basis model including 66 nodes
(Model C, see suppl. Material, all sequences and domains
are given). To get additional nodes we used Genbank
(adding nodes from literature and checking their
sequence), STRING (predict edges, i.e. interactions
between nodes) and network module analysis [14] to
expand the network. Besides the versions shown in Table
1 a number of further modifications tested network
robustness and behavior as well as system input and stability from different connections and crosstalk possibilities (see suppl. Material). The final model includes 74
nodes (Model A). Functional analysis of individual nodes
includes sequence and domain analysis [15] to determine
function, in particular activation and inhibition [see Additional file 2: Table 1S, Table 2S]. For the creation and visualization of the model we used Celldesigner Version
3.5.1 [16]http://celldesigner.org/.
Dynamic system stability analysis
The complete system for apoptosis has 74 nodes and 108
edges. This can be set up as a Boolean network, which is
given here in SBML format [see Additional file 3]. We
applied and used for this the output created from Celldesigner [16]. In order to systematically test the number of
stable states in the network we used the program SQUAD
[6] (accepts input as an xml or smbl file). With this program we converted our Boolean network into a dynamic
system. In the next step SQUAD uses an efficient heuristic
to calculate a reduced order binary decision diagram [7];
the required running time for convergence in each simulation was only 2 minutes on a 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
PC. Furthermore, the program converts the network into
a continuous dynamical system based on ordinary differential equations. SQUAD can operate here also in the
absence of detailed kinetic parameters as it simply interpolates a hysteresis curve (exponential function) between
the states completely "on" or completely "off" for each
node. As shown previously [6], this allows us to identify
the number and features of the stable systems states even
in rather complex networks without detailed knowledge
of the kinetic parameters. SQUAD therefore calculates first
the steady states found in the discrete Boolean network
model and then uses these states as a guide to localize the
stable steady states in the continuous model. The complete set of equations is automatically generated by
SQUAD upon reading in the SMBL file given in Additional
file 2: Table 3S and also available from the authors on
request. For validation and comparisons, values for individual nodes corresponding to different system states as
well as transition values and curves were directly read out
and calculated from SQUAD and plotted (see results).
