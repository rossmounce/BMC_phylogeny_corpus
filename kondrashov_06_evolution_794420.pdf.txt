Abstract
Background: The glyoxylate cycle is thought to be present in bacteria, protists, plants, fungi, and
nematodes, but not in other Metazoa. However, activity of the glyoxylate cycle enzymes, malate
synthase (MS) and isocitrate lyase (ICL), in animal tissues has been reported. In order to clarify the
status of the MS and ICL genes in animals and get an insight into their evolution, we undertook a
comparative-genomic study.
Results: Using sequence similarity searches, we identified MS genes in arthropods, echinoderms,
and vertebrates, including platypus and opossum, but not in the numerous sequenced genomes of
placental mammals. The regions of the placental mammals' genomes expected to code for malate
synthase, as determined by comparison of the gene orders in vertebrate genomes, show clear
similarity to the opossum MS sequence but contain stop codons, indicating that the MS gene
became a pseudogene in placental mammals. By contrast, the ICL gene is undetectable in animals
other than the nematodes that possess a bifunctional, fused ICL-MS gene. Examination of
phylogenetic trees of MS and ICL suggests multiple horizontal gene transfer events that probably
went in both directions between several bacterial and eukaryotic lineages. The strongest evidence
was obtained for the acquisition of the bifunctional ICL-MS gene from an as yet unknown bacterial
source with the corresponding operonic organization by the common ancestor of the nematodes.
Conclusion: The distribution of the MS and ICL genes in animals suggests that either they encode
alternative enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle that are not orthologous to the known MS and ICL or
the animal MS acquired a new function that remains to be characterized. Regardless of the ultimate
solution to this conundrum, the genes for the glyoxylate cycle enzymes present a remarkable
variety of evolutionary events including unusual horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to animals.

Background
Glyoxylate cycle is a distinct, anaplerotic variant of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle the net effect of which is the
conversion of two molecules of acetyl-CoA to succinate
gluconeogenesis. The glyoxylate cycle shares three of the
five involved enzymes with the TCA cycle. skips the two
rate-limiting decarboxylation steps of the latter, which are
catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase (Figure 1; [1,2]). The glyoxylate cycle deviates from the TCA cycle when isocitrate, instead of being
decarboxylated into α-ketoglutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase, is converted into glyoxylate and succinate by isocitrate lyase (ICL). Malate synthase (MS) completes the
shortcut by producing malate from glyoxylate and acetylCoA (Figure 1). Succinate produced by the glyoxylate
cycle is utilized, primarily, for carbohydrate synthesis.
Both ICL and MS are essential for the function of this
pathway and are thought to be dedicated, glyoxylate cyclespecific enzymes such that their activities are often considered to be signatures of this pathway [2].
It is widely accepted that the glyoxylate cycle operates in
bacteria [2], fungi [3], some protists [4,5], and plants [6];
in addition, recent reports [7,8] identified a bifunctional
enzyme in nematodes with both ICL and MS activities
that apparently evolved by the fusion of the respective
genes (see also [2]). Although several authors reported
ICL and/or MS activity in other Metazoa, including birds
[9], reptiles [10,11], and placental mammals [12-20], the
claim that the glyoxylate cycle functions in animals other
than nematodes remains controversial [21,22]. One of the
major problems with regard to the existence of the glyoxylate cycle in Metazoa is the failure to identify the ICL and
MS genes in metazoan genomes, except for those of the
nematodes. Here, we undertake a bioinformatic analysis
aimed at detection of orthologous genes for the two glyoxylate cycle-specific enzymes in the available complete
and draft genomes of various animals and reveal the existence of a MS pseudogene in placental mammals. We further examine the phylogenies of these enzymes and derive
evolutionary scenarios that include multiple horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) events.

Results
Isocitrate lyase and malate synthase genes and
pseudogenes in animals
In addition to the previously identified ICL homologs in
the nematodes Caenorhabditis and Strongyloides, a putative

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/31

ICL gene has been annotated in the mosquito Anopheles
gambiae and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, and
we also found an incomplete homolog in the mosquito
Aedes aegypti. However, the extremely high similarity of
the protein sequence of the mosquito and bacterial genes
(only 20% divergence between A. gambiae and E. coli) and
the lack of introns in the mosquito sequence strongly suggested a bacterial contamination. Indeed, such contamination appears to be common at least in the A. gambiae
genome (S. L. Mekhedov and EVK, unpublished observations). In contrast, the predicted sea anemone ICL
sequence contained introns and was identical to several
EST sequences. In addition, we identified ICL homolgos
among EST sequences for two other Cnidarians (Acropora
millepora, Hydractinia echinata) and several nematodes
(Ancylostoma ceylanicum, Globodera rostochiensis, Heterodera
glycines, Parastrongyloides trichosuri, Pristionchus pacificus,
Meloidogyne hapla, Meloidogyne javanica, Xiphinema index).
The high sequence conservation of ICL (Table 1) implies
that, if intact copies of this gene were present in other
completely sequenced metazoan genomes, we would
have been able to detect them easily. Thus, it appears that,
of all Metazoa with sequenced genomes, only nematodes
and Cnidaria encode ICL.
In contrast, apparent MS orthologs are readily identifiable
in several animal genomes including nematodes (C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. remanei), cnidarians (N. vectensis),
insects (A. gambiae, A. aegypti, Bombyx mori), echinoderms
(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), and vertebrates (Danio
rerio, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Fugu rubripes, Xenopus tropicalis,
Monodelphis domestica). The Ornithorhynchus anatinus
(platypus) and Oryzias latipes (fish) genomes also appear
to possess the MS gene. In addition, for an insect (Spodoptera frugiperda), two cnidarians (Hydractinia echinata, Acropora millepora), a variety of nematodes (Ancylostoma
caninum, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, Globodera rostochiensis,
Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Heterodera glycines, Heterodera schachtii, Meloidogyne arenaria, Meloidogyne incognita,
Meloidogyne javanica, Parastrongyloides trichosuri, Pristionchus pacificus, Trichostrongylus vitrinus, Trichuris vulpis,
Xiphinema index), a primitive chordate (Branchiostoma floridae, lancelet), and several vertebrates (Trichosurus vulpecula, Hippoglossus hippoglossus, Oryzias latipes, Salmo salar,
Pimephales promelas, Xenopus laevis, Gasterosteus aculeatus,
Fundulus heteroclitus), we detected at least one EST corresponding to the MS gene. However, these sequences were
excluded from further analysis because they did not cover
the entire coding sequence. None of the detected MS
homologs from animals have been characterized experimentally although some of them are annotated in Genbank as proteins similar to the nematode malate
synthase/isocitrate lyase bifunctional protein. In the
genome sequence of the sea anemone (a Cnidarian) N.
vectensis, we detected two distinct MS genes; however, we

strongly suspect that one of these is a contamination from
an animal source because ESTs corresponding to this
genes were not detectable, and it clustered with vertebrates and sea urchin in a phylogenetic tree that included
insect MS genes as an outgroup (data not shown).
Despite the lack of experimental evidence, there are several indications that animal MS homologs (in addition to
those from nematodes) are functional enzymes. Firstly,
the coding sequences of these genes do not contain nonsense or frameshift mutations or large insertions or deletions, and the protein sequences retain the conserved

motifs characteristic of bacterial MS (data not shown).
Secondly, the gene structure is preserved between closely
related species, and all introns have the canonical splicing
sites (GT...AG), suggesting that the transcripts of these
genes are properly spliced. Thirdly, most of these
sequences contain regions that are identical or nearly
identical to EST sequences. Finally, the rate of non-synonymous substitutions in these genes is substantially lower
than the rate of synonymous substitutions, which indicates that these genes are subject to purifying selection at
the level of the protein function (Table 2).

We have not found the MS gene in more than 15
sequenced genomes of placental mammals. Given the
substantial number of genomes searched, the high conservation of the MS sequence in other animals (Table 2), and
the fact that the closely related opossum sequence was
used as the query to search other mammalian genomes, it
seems most unlikely that we have missed this gene. A
TBLASTN search of the placental mammal genome
sequences using the opossum MS sequence as the query
showed several marginally significant hits to the same
genomic region where the MS is found in the opossum
genome. However, these searches detected only a small
portion of the MS sequence in placental mammal
genomes, and some of the identifiable sequences contained stop codons (Table 3). A comparison of the gene
orders in the corresponding genomic regions shows that
the sequences similar to MS were located in the exact position occupied by the MS gene in other animals (Figure 2).

Thus, it appears that these searches detect the true
orthologs of MS but the gene was inactivated and became
a pseudogene in the placental mammal lineage. Although
the general synteny conservation in this genomic region
extends to the chicken genome (Figure 2), we found no
evidence of a functional gene or a pseudogene in that
region in chicken. Thus, it appears likely that the MS gene
has been independently disrupted beyond recognition in
the chicken genome. Similarly, the gene order is conserved between A. gambiae and the numerous sequenced
genomes of Drosophila species (data not shown), however,
we have not been able to find any traces of a pseudogene
in Drosophila.
The presence of the detectable MS pseudogene in several
mammalian genomes seemed unexpected because pseudogenes are usually not recognizable after ~100 million
years that separate the mammalian orders from their com-

mon ancestor, as indicated by several studies of human
and mouse genome divergence [23,24]. However, the
rodent lineage appears to evolve substantially faster than
other mammalian orders [25-27], and indeed, the MS
pseudogene was not detected by genome-wide TBLASTN
searches of rodent genomes (Table 3). Thus, some ancestral pseudogenes might have evolved beyond recognition
only in the fastest evolving mammalian orders but remain
recognizable in others.
Horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of glyoxylate
cycle enzymes in eukaryotes
Several lines of evidence suggest that there was extensive
HGT of bacterial MS and ICL genes into several eukaryotic
lineages [28]. The two genes are fused to form a bifunctional gene in the nematodes and Euglena, but in the nematodes, the ICL domain precedes the MS domain, whereas
Euglena has the reversed domain order [5]. Since ICL and
MS are encoded in the same ace operon in many bacteria,
and the gene order in the operon also varies, it has been
suggested that nematodes and Euglena acquired these
genes via HGT from bacteria with the respective gene
orders in the ace operon [5]. This hypothesis predicts that,
in phylogenetic trees, the domains from the bifunctional
eukaryotic genes should cluster with homologs from bacteria that have the same gene order in the ace operon. In
practice, testing this prediction was not a straightforward
task. The ICL domain of the bifunctional enzymes of the
nematodes showed very high (>70% identity) sequence
similarity to the ICL of α-proteobacteria, in particular,
those of the genus Brucella, and clustered with these bacterial proteins in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). However, in the sequenced α-proteobacterial genomes, the MS
gene is located in a region distant from the ICL gene such
that there is no ace operon. Interestingly, the MS domain
sequence of the bifunctional nematode enzyme showed

by far greater similarity to the MS from a different assemblage of bacteria, in particular, several species of Grampositive bacteria of the genus Bacillus (~57% identity), in
contrast to the much lower similarity to the MS of Brucella
(~25% identity). In the phylogenetic tree of MS, the nematode sequences did not cluster with any specific bacterial
clade but rather was positioned at the root of the bacterial
subtree (Figure 3). This might result from acceleration of
evolution of the MS domain in the nematode lineage and/
or the absence of the actual bacterial source of the nematode gene in the current databases. Taken together, the evidence seems to be compelling for the horizontal transfer
of the ICL-MS gene from bacteria into the nematode lineage. The most likely scenario would involve HGT into the
nematode lineage of a "hybrid" ace operon containing a
"proteobacterial-type" ICL and a "Gram-positive-type"
MS; a bacterial genome with such a "hybrid" ace operon
(or the actual fusion of the two genes) remains to be discovered.
Interestingly, the ICL and MS genes in the cnidarian
genome appear to be encoded in tandem but on the opposite strands, in the convergent, 5'-5' orientation. However,
without further sequencing of this genomic region from
other cnidarians, it is unclear if the two genes originate
from an ancestral ace operon but one of them was
inverted in the sea anemone or the current gene organization is an assembly artifact. In the reconstructed phylogenies (Figure 3), the sea anemone ICL and MS genes cluster
within different sets of bacteria which, as in the case of
nematodes, might reflect acquisition of a "hybrid" ace
operon from an unknown bacterial source.
With regard to the bifunctional gene of Euglena, specific
phylogenetic inferences were not feasible because of the
extremely high rate of evolution in the Euglena lineage

The lower half of the table shows the rates of evolution in nonsynonymous sites, and the upper half shows the rates of evolution in synonymous
sites. Most of the synonymous evolution rates were at the saturation levels. However, in each case, the estimated nonsynonymous substitution rate
was significantly lower than the corresponding synonymous rate, which is indicative of purifying selection at the amino acid sequence level.

(Figure 3). Nevertheless, acquisition of a MS-ICL operon
via HGT remains a distinct possibility. In addition to the
apparent HGT of the bifunctional gene into the nematode
lineage, the phylogenetic tree of ICL suggests at least three
other independent instances of bacteria-to-eukaryotes
HGT – into the Nematostella,Dictyostelium and
Chlamydomonadaceaelineages (Figure 3a). The rest of
the eukaryotic ICLs, i.e., those from plants, fungi, and the
ciliate Tetrahymena, form a well-defined clade with one of
the two copies of the ICL gene from Mycobacteria and
Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans (Figure 3a). The monophyly of this clade is additionally supported by the pres-

ence of a distinctive inserted domain which seems to be a
derived shared character (Figure 4). Thus, considering all
the evidence, the most likely evolutionary scenario for ICL
seems to include the following events (Figure 5): i) early
acquisition of the ICL gene by an ancestral eukaryote from
bacteria, most likely, the mitochondrial endosymbiont,
ii) evolution of the insertion domain, possibly, by internal duplication with subsequent radical divergence, iii)
secondary, reverse HGT of the ICL gene from an early
eukaryote to a bacterium (possibly, an ancestral Mycobacterium), iii) loss of the ICL gene at the outset of animal
evolution, iv) at least five additional HGTs from bacteria

to eukaryotes, resulting in displacement of the ancestral
eukaryotic form of ICL by various bacterial forms in
chlamydomonads, Dictyostelium, Euglena, cnidaria, and
nematodes. In the case of nematodes and Euglena, and
possibly, cnidaria as well, HGT was accompanied by
fusion of ICL and MS genes, probably, facilitated by the
juxtaposition of these genes in the respective bacterial ace
operons (it is also conceivable that the fusion occurred
within a bacterial genome prior to the HGT). An alternative scenario would involve the origin of the eukaryotictype ICL in a distinct bacterial lineage (possibly, an ancestral Mycobacterium) with subsequent HGT into an early
prokaryote. Given that all bacteria that have the eukaryotic-type ICL also possess a second, typical bacterial ICL,
this scenario seems less likely. Regardless of the exact evolutionary scenario of ICL, the unusual, for animals, acquisition of the bifunctional ICL-MS enzyme by nematodes
via HGT from a bacterial source appears undeniable.

intron positions in eukaryotic genes. Many introns are
conserved in orthologous genes from plants and animals,
whereas independent gain of introns in the same position
in different lineages is unlikely [29,30]. Therefore, the
presence of even one shared intron strongly suggests
monophyly of the respective genes as opposed to origin
via independent HGT events. Indeed, although plants and
coelomate animals did not form a clade in the MS tree
(Figure 3b) and instead appeared to cluster with different
bacterial species, plant and coelomate MS genes shared
one intron in the same position (Figure 6), which is best
compatible with their origin from a common eukaryotic
ancestor. In contrast, the nematode and the cnidarian
gene do not share introns with other animal, fungi or
plant genes (or with each other), in either the MS and ICL
sequences, which is consistent with a history of HGT (see
above).

Discussion and conclusion
The MS phylogenetic tree is less well-resolved than the ICL
tree (Figure 3b), and the multiple alignment of MS has
not revealed any plausible derived shared characters, such
as lineage-specific large inserts (Figure 4), complicating
the inference of the evolutionary scenario. In order to
assess the monophyly of eukaryotic MS, we compared

The evolution of glyoxylate cycle enzymes, ICL and MS,
seems to have involved a remarkable array of events.
These include at least three independent gene fusions, in
nematodes, Euglena, and Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans,
multiple HGTs, and gene loss, in particular, in animals.

via HGT from bacteria in nematodes and cnidarians is of
special note because the very reality of acquisition of new
genes by animals via HGT from bacteria is a highly controversial topic, and there are very few strongly supported
cases [31-35]. The HGT of the bifunctional ICL-MS is supported by multiple lines of evidence, namely: i) unusually
high similarity between the respective animal and bacterial genes, at least, in the case of ICL, ii) confident placement of the ICL and MS domains of the animal
bifunctional enzymes within specific bacterial branches in
phylogenetic trees, iii) juxtaposition of ICL and MS that is
not seen in other eukaryotes but is common in bacteria
(ace operons), iv) absence of shared intron positions
between the bifunctional enzymes and the stand-alone
homologs from other eukaryotes. Collectively, these

observations seem to make the nematode and cnidarian
ICL-MS true "smoking guns" of HGT from bacteria to specific lineages of animals. We believe that this is an important proof of principle that justifies a systematic search for
other such cases.
Given that most archaea lack the glyoxylate cycle enzymes
(with a few exceptions that, in all likelihood, can be attributed to HGT from bacteria ([36], Figure 3)), it appears
most likely that eukaryotes originally acquired these genes
from the mitochondrial endosymbiont. The ICL gene was
lost early in metazoan evolution but was reacquired in the
nematode and cnidarian lineages. In contrast, the MS
gene was generally retained throughout the evolution of
the eukaryotes but became a pseudogene in placental

mammals. Combined with conflicting experimental data,
these observations stress the conundrum around the function of the glyoxylate cycle-specific enzymes in coelomate
animals. One possibility is that these enzymes, ICL and
MS, have been lost in Coelomates, but MS was recruited
to perform a new function. However, there is currently no
experimental evidence of any function of MS other than
its involvement in the glyoxylate cycle, and no indication

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/31

of acceleration of evolution of the MS gene in the Coelomate lineage, which would be expected in the case of a
substantial change of function. Alternatively, the ICL gene
might have been lost after a different, perhaps, distantly
related or unrelated gene evolved the isocitrate lyase function in the Coelomate lineage – a potential case of nonorthologous gene displacement, a fairly common evolutionary phenomenon [37]. This explanation is compatible with several experimental reports that demonstrate the
presence of the ICL and MS activities in Coelomates [920]. However, since the validity of these experimental
results has been challenged [21,22], determination of the
function(s) of the MS in Coelomates would be a major
step towards the resolution of the conundrum.
The functional significance of the pseudogenization of MS
in placental mammals and possible independent loss of
MS in birds is another enigma. One possibility is that the
generally higher transaminase activity in warm-blooded
mammals [38] enhanced the removal of the toxic glyoxylate through transamination by several glyoxylate-animotransferases ([39-43], Figure 1), rendering the MS activity
non-essential. The alternatives are that, even if other Coelomates possess the glyoxylate cycle, placental mammals
and birds have lost it entirely, or yet another gene evolved
the malate synthase function in an additional case of nonorthologous gene displacement.
The extreme evolutionary mobility of the glyoxylate cycle
enzymes might seem puzzling although, as far as prokary-

otic metabolic pathways are concerned, it is not entirely
unprecedented [44]. The key biological consideration
appears to be that the two enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle
comprise a compact, readily transferable functional unit,
especially, when the two genes are juxtaposed or fused.
Acquisition of this unit immediately endows the recipient
with new metabolic capabilities – to produce succinate
and to eliminate the toxic glyoxylate – which could be a
selective advantage, at least, under some metabolic
regimes.

Methods
We employed a series of similarity searches for isocitrate
lyases and malate synthases in GenBank, and complete
and draft genomes of all Metazoans available at NCBI and
EMBL. The genomes searched and the parameters of the
searches where identical for the two proteins.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequences (isocitrate lyase –
NC_001137; malate synthase – NC_001146) to the nonredundant protein sequence database at NCBI [45] using
the BLASTP program [46] in order to identify all Metazoan
homologues that have already been annotated in protein
sequence. This approach identified isotrate lyase genes
that were annotated in A. gambiae (XP_561347), C. elegans
(NP_503306), C. briggsae (CAE62276), Strongyloides ratti
(BAD89436) and S. stercoralis (AAF00535), and malate
synthase genes in A. gambiae (XP_315354), C. elegans
(NP_503306), C. briggsae (CAE62276), S. purpuratus
(XP_782946), D. rerio (XP_685378) and T. nigroviridis
(CAF91513). These homologues were identified unambiguously, with low expectation values (E < 1 × 10-30) and
with at least 40% identity.
All genes that were predicted from complete genomes
rather than obtained by direct sequencing of mRNAs
(genes from A. gambiae, D. rerio and T. nigroviridis in this
case) were checked for consistency of the annotation. To
do this, the predicted protein sequence were mapped to
the complete genomes available at the UC Santa Cruz
Genome Browser [47] using the BLAT program [48] and
checked for correct splice sites in introns (GT...AG), for
start and stop codons in the first and last exons, and for
the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in the
retrieved sequence. Where appropriate, the annotation
was modified to fit these criteria, and the resulting protein
sequence checked by alignment to closest homologues
that have been sequenced directly from an mRNA.
The next step of the sequence query was a recursive BLAST
search of the available draft and complete Metazoan
genomes. First, all isocitrate lyase and malate synthase
protein sequences, which were identified in the step
described above, were compared with the nucleotide
sequences of these genomes using the TBLASTN program

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/31

[46]. When a homolog was found in one of the genomes,
it was annotated according to the sequence similarity with
the respective protein sequence, and then checked for correct splice sites, start and stop codons, and the lack of
frameshift and nonsense mutations. To complete the
search cycle, the newly identified genes was then used as a
query in a new TBLASTN search of the Metazoan
genomes. The following genomes were queried: Homo
sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Cavia porcellus, Canis familiaris, Felis catus,
Bos taurus, Dasypus novemcinctus, Echinops telfairi, Loxodonta africana, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Sorex araneus, Myotis
lucifugus, Otolemur garnettii, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus,
Monodelphis domestica, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Gallus
gallus, Xenopus tropicalis, Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon negroviridis, Danio rerio, Ciona savignyi, Ciona intestinalis, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Bombyx mori, Aedes aegypti,
Anopheles gambiae, Tribolium castaneum, Nematostella vectensis, Caenorhabditis elegans, Cenorhabditis briggsae and
twelve Drosophila species. To marginalize the possibility
that the ICL and MS gene sequences are the result of bacterial contamination, we checked for the presence of an
introns by BLAT [48] and ESTs by a TBLASTN search [46]
in dbEST [49].
Finally, position-specific search implemented in PSIBLAST [50] was used to search for possible missed homologues among the annotated genes from human, mouse,
rat and Drosophila genomes and a ScanProsite [51] search
of all genes in the UniProt (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) [52]
and PDB [53] databases. This procedure has not revealed
any Metazoan isocitrate lyase or malate synthase
sequences that were not picked up with the BLASTP or
TBLASTN searches.
Syntenic regions of genomes revealed by BLAST and BLAT
searches of genes adjacent to the ICL and MS genes; only
assembled genomes were considered. Multiple protein
alignments were constructed using the MUSCLE program
[54] with default parameters and manually checked for
errors and for consistency of the alignment with the ScanProsite [51] ICL and MS amino acid patterns. Rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution were calculated
with the PAML package [55].
Phylogenetic trees were constructed by two methods, the
neighbor joining procedure with 10,000 bootstrap replicates using with the MEGA program [56] and the Bayesian
inference approach implemented in the MrBayes program
[57] run with a GTR model assuming a gamma-distribution of substitution rates across sites for 1 million iterations (mcmc ngen = 1000000 in MrBayes). The two
methods revealed, largely, congruent phylogenies.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Arcady Mushegian, Stowers Institute for Medical Research
(with additional contribution from Manisha Goel).

This is an interesting work, starting to trace the unusual
path of evolution of malate synthase and isocitrate lyase
in animal kingdom, with additional discussion of what
might have been going on with these genes in bacteria.
I suggest that the authors do the following:
1. Due diligence with the databases of unfinished
genomes: I did a quick tblastn against the environmental
sequence genomes at NCBI and saw at least one entry that
codes for the same domain tandem as the two-domain
nematode protein: is it one ORF or two, from a nematode
or perhaps from a bacterium? The unfinished bacterial
genomes – perhaps the donor of two genes to the nematode lineage can be identified among them?
Author response: We significantly expanded the scope of
searches in the revised version. Indeed, there are some very similar sequences of the ICL-MS fused nematode gene in the environmental sequence database. We find sequences that are
highly similar to the nematode gene in two different configurations, with ICL and MS or not fused. Unfortunately, however,
it is impossible to tell whether these sequences are from bacteria
or eukaryotes, and therefore, we cannot use this information to
resolve any of the issues regarding the potential donor of the
ICL-MS fused gene in the nematodes.
When the authors say 'gene transfer into the nematode
lineage', how do they know it is not an earlier event
(search Schmidtea genome traces perhaps, also Coelenterata)? The same databases, plus ESTs, are needed to
account for additional ICLs (I think I can see some in corals).
Author response: Since the submission of the first draft of
this manuscript, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis genome
draft has been completed, and now we have included the ICL
and MS gene sequences found in this genome into our analysis.
Interestingly, the sea anemone genes appear to cluster with bacterial genes as well, albeit with different lineages of bacteria
than the nematode genes. We believe that HGT of the fused

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/31

gene (or operon, with subsequent fusion) in the nematode lineage is the most parsimonious solution. An earlier HGT, e.g.,
to the common ancestor of Metazoa, would require genes losses
in addition.
Reviewer's report 2
Andrei Osterman, Burnham Institute for Medical Research

The strength of the manuscript by F. Kondrashov et al. on
Evolution of glyoxylate cycle enzymes in Metazoa is in the
detailed analysis of possible evolutionary scenarios that
included multiple horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events
from bacteria to eukaryotes beyond a symbiotic ancestor
of extant mitochondria. Such a case-study is a best possible contribution to the heated debates on this exciting
albeit highly controversial topic. Based on a solid comparative analysis of genomic sequences of multiple bacterial
and eukaryotic species, which included the delineation of
intron/exon structures and "pseudogenized" regions in
genomes of Metazoa, the authors presented several plausible scenarios. While differing in details, all of them inevitably include several independent cross-kingdom HGT
and gene fusion events. In that regard this paper is a
highly recommended reading and thinking material. A
weaker aspect of this study is a relatively low impact on
our understanding of a metabolic driving force behind
these amazing events. Despite a heroic attempt to build
on the existing fragmental and highly controversial biochemical data, an emerging picture remains largely
obscure. The above notion hardly argues against the
authors of this study, but rather provides another illustration of a profound disregard of the basic metabolic biochemistry by the overwhelming majority of the
experimental research community in the post-genomic
era. A juxtaposition of a monumental effort (and quite a
stunning progress) on elucidating minute details of signaling cascades, transcription machinery and other complex systems versus an apparent lack of any drive to finally
straighten out basic questions such as: (i) presence or
absence of malate synthase activity or (ii) actual function
of a malate synthase homologs in placental animals, can
hardly be reconciled other than by a popular misconception of the actual depth of our knowledge of basic metabolism. Contrasting this problem and putting it in a
fundamental evolutionary context is another (likely unintended) impact of this article.
Overall, I firmly support the publication of the submitted
article in "Biology Direct", and I believe that it is a perfect
fit for the mission of this distinguished Journal.
Author response: Actually, the original motivation behind
this article was to apply computational approaches in an
attempt to resolve the paradox of the glyoxylate cycle in mammals and birds: several laboratories have reported that this

Page 11 of 14

Biology Direct 2006, 1:31

pathway was functional but the participant enzymes could not
be identified. As it happens, the paradox only deepened as we
ascertained the presence of "orphan" MS in many animals and
pseudogenes in mammals. So it was very much our intent,
indeed, our primary goal, to attract attention to the mysterious
function of the animal MS, and hopefully, to stimulate relevant
biochemical experimentation. The discovery of interesting cases
of HGT was, in a sense, a by-product of our research, even if it
might have the greatest general impact of the observations
reported here.
Reviewer's report 3
Chris Ponting, Oxford University

This is an interesting study aiming at resolving the longstanding issue of whether malate synthase and isocitrate
lyase genes are functional in many animal genomes. It is
argued that the malate synthase gene is functional in noneutherian mammals, other vertebrates, echinoderms and
arthropods, but that eutherians have lost this gene
through pseudogenization. Meanwhile, the isocitrate
lyase gene appears to be absent from all animals with the
notable exception of nematode worms (where it is fused
with malate synthase). It is argued that these two genes
were transferred horizontally into several eukaryotic lineages.
One of the issues with which the authors had to contend
was of contamination. I agree that the homologues purported to be in mosquito genome sequences appear to
result instead from contamination from bacterial sources.
Certainly there is evidence that the mosquito genomes are
contaminated with these bacterial genes, particularly
because they appear to be single exon genes present
between clone gaps in unplaced sequence. Contamination might also be an explanation for the postulated horizontal gene transfer of ICL into Dictyostelium and
Chlamydomonas lineages, but this wasn't (but should have
been) considered by the authors.
Author response:Contamination can be a serious problem in
studies such as this one. We have done our best to exclude the
possibility of bacterial or other contaminations of Metazoan
sequences by examining gene structure, EST sequences, and
level of sequence similarity. We concluded that the ICL
sequence from the mosquito Anopheles gambeae and one of the
MS sequences from the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis are
likely contaminants. By contrast, other Metazoan ICL and MS
genes, including those of Dictyostelium and Chlamydomonas,
contained introns, and most have several independent EST
sequences in GenBank which effectively rules out bacterial contamination.
A main finding of this report is that the isocitrate lyase
gene is absent from "completely sequenced metazoan

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/31

genomes". Whilst this appears true, there are numerous
isocitrate lyase ESTs from cnidarians apparent in public
databases. The authors will need to determine whether
these represent independent horizontal or else vertical
acquisitions, or else consider whether they are contaminants of the type seen in mosquito genomes.
Author response:Indeed, these EST sequences are identical to
the ICL and one of the MS genes from the genome. Thus, we
have included the sequences from the recently completed
genome draft of Nematostella vectensis; however, we have not
included the EST sequences of other species with ESTs for which
we could not obtain the cognate genomic sequences.
Table 2 shows PAML non-synonymous and synonymous
substitution rates between diverse metazoans. The vast
majority of these estimates are not meaningful since saturation of substitution will have occurred, and so Table 2
should not be kept. If the authors believe me to be in error
here, they should demonstrate their point using classic
tests for saturation.
Author response: Indeed many of the values reported in that
table are beyond saturation. However, what is clear from this
table is that the nonsynonymous divergence (which is nowhere
near saturation levels) is much lower than the rate of synonymous divergence, thus demonstrating functional constraint.
Therefore, we opted to keep the table after adding a note of caution to the reader regarding the interpretation of the estimates
of the synonymous divergence.
I do not think the authors have presented sufficient evidence that there "was extensive HGT of bacterial MS and
ICL genes into several eukaryotic lineages". They imply
that these genes have been acquired independently from
separate bacterial sources before being fused in nematodes. They discount the possibility that the evolutionary
rate of nematode malate synthase might be particularly
high without explanation and instead choose a scenario
that the bacterial source is as yet unknown. I do not consider that this provides "compelling" evidence for horizontal transfer of both ICL and MS genes from bacteria,
which has implications for the title of the manuscript.
Author response: Suppose the genes in the nematode, as well
as Chlamydomonas, Dictyostelium and Nematostella (but not
other eukaryotic species) have experienced a substantial acceleration of the evolution rate. In order for such acceleration to
result in the nesting of these sequences within bacterial clades
(which is what we observe) this acceleration must have been
coupled with extensive convergent evolution as well. We believe
that such convergent mode of evolution is highly unlikely, to say
the least, and a much more parsimonious explanation for the
phylogenetic tree reported here is a series of HGT events. Thus,
we stand by our statement that the evidence for several cases of

Page 12 of 14

Biology Direct 2006, 1:31

HGT from bacteria to specific eukaryotic lineages, including
nematodes and Cnidaria, is compelling, and there was no reason to modify the title of the paper. Partly in consideration of
these comments, the discussion of HGT was expanded in the
revised version of the paper.

Moreover, if one considers that the horizontal acquisition
of ICL by slime mold and Chlamydomonas lineages might
instead be accounted for by contamination of sequences
by bacterial sources, there is even less evidence for the
"four additional HGTs from bacteria to eukaryotes" proposed.
Author response: As discussed above in our response to
Mushegian's comments, it is highly unlikely that the source of
ICL and MS sequences from Chlamydomonas, Dictyostelium
and Nematostella is bacterial contamination since the genes in
these species have introns and ESTs corresponding to these
genes are available for all three o fthese species. We mention
these observations in the revised text.
