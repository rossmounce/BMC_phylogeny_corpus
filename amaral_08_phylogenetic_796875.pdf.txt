Abstract
Background: Chromosomal painting, using whole chromosome probes from humans and
Saguinus oedipus, was used to establish karyotypic divergence among species of the genus Cebus,
including C. olivaceus, C. albifrons, C. apella robustus and C. apella paraguayanus. Cytogenetic studies
suggested that the species of this genus have conservative karyotypes, with diploid numbers ranging
from 2n = 52 to 2n = 54.
Results: Banding studies revealed morphological divergence among some chromosomes, owing to
variations in the size of heterochromatic blocks. This analysis demonstrated that Cebus species have
five conserved human associations (i.e., 5/7, 2/16, 10/16, 14/15, 8/18 and 3/21) when compared with
the putative ancestral Platyrrhini karyotype.
Conclusion: The autapomorphies 8/15/8 in C. albifrons and 12/15 in C. olivaceus explain the
changes in chromosome number from 54 to 52. The association 5/16/7, which has not previously
been reported in Platyrrhini, was also found in C. olivaceus. These data corroborate previous FISH
results, suggesting that the genus Cebus has a very similar karyotype to the putative ancestral
Platyrrhini.

Background
Taxonomy of the genus Cebus is a controversial subject.
Members of this genus display intense variations in fur
color and pattern depending on age, gender and geographical location [1]. Despite these variations, most
authors agree that Cebus comprises five species: C. apella,
C. albifrons, C. capucinus, C. olivaceus and C. kaapori [2-5].
Groves (2001) [6] published a new taxonomy for the
genus, where he recognizes four species with subspecies:

Cebus apella (C. a. apella, C. a. fatuellus, C. a. macrocephalus,
C. a. peruanus, C. a. tocantinus and C. a. margaritae), C.
libidinosus (C. l. libidinosus, C. l. pallidus, C. l. paraguayanus
and C. l. juruanus), C. nigritus (C. n. nigritus, C. n. robustus
and C. n. cucullatus) and C. xanthosternos. Silva Júnior
(2002) [7] classification has some differences. For
instance, Groves (2001) [6] recognizes robustus as a subspecies of C. nigritus while Silva Junior (2002) [7] recognizes it as a full species.

Cytogenetic studies on Cebus have shown that the diploid
number ranges from 52 to 54 chromosomes. The species
of this genus have large blocks of constitutive heterochromatin, mainly found in interstitial and distal regions,
which displays intraspecific variation, few biarmed chromosomes and secondary constrictions in two acrocentric
pairs [8-12]. To date, human chromosomal painting has
been used to analyze three species of Cebus: C. capucinus
[13]C. apella [14] and C. nigrivittatus [15].
Interspecies chromosomal comparisons of Cebus have
been performed using G- and Q-banding patterns. These
comparisons [16] suggest that C. capucinus, C. albifrons
and C. apella share 19 chromosome pairs, C. capucinus and
C. albifrons share 25 pairs and C. capucinus and C. apella
share 20 pairs. Among these three species, the karyotype
of C. capucinus most resembles the putative ancestor, as all
chromosomes found in C. capucinus are observed in C.
albifrons and C. apella. Furthermore, C. albifrons and C.
apella seem to have been independently derived from an
ancestor with a karyotype similar to C. capucinus. The C.
capucinus karyotype is closer to C. albifrons than to C.
apella.
Zoo-FISH comparative chromosome painting is a powerful method for detecting chromosome homologies
between species and for resolving phylogenetic controversies. This study compared the chromosome homologies
present among Cebus apella paraguayanus (2n = 54), Cebus
apella robustus (2n = 54), Cebus albifrons (2n = 52) and
Cebus olivaceus (2n = 52) using G-banding and chromosome painting with whole chromosome probes derived
from humans and Saguinus oedipus. Our results were compared with previous reports to propose a phylogeny for
these species, using chromosomal characters in a parsimony analysis.

G-banding was performed using the methods of Seabright
(1971) [19]. FISH experiments were performed in all species using S. oedipus whole chromosome probes [20] and
24 different whole chromosome probes taken from
humans (1–22 autosomes, X and Y). Probes were organized into four pools (H1-H4 and S1-S4, for human and S.
oedipus chromosome paints, respectively) as previously
described [21,20]. The probes were then labeled by DOPPCR [22] using biotin-dUTP, digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche)
and TAMRA-dUTP (Applied Biosystems/PE). In situ
hybridization and detection were performed using the
protocols of Neusser et al. (2001) [21] and De Oliveira et
al. (2005) [23]. Nomenclatures of chromosomes and
chromosome segments were consistent with Neusser et al.
(2001) [21] and De Oliveira et al. (2005) [23]. Human
and S. oedipus probes were applied to all of the taxa except
C. olivaceus, which was analyzed solely using human
probes.
G-banded metaphases were captured using a Zeiss III photomicroscope with Imagelink HQ film manufactured by
Kodak. FISH/DAPI metaphases were captured with a CCD
camera under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Images were
analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 7.01.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed by applying a cladistic method with parsimony criteria. A basic data matrix
was built by comparing chromosomal differences among
species, as determined by FISH or G-banding. Previously
reported chromosome painting data was used for C. apella
sp. [14] and C. capucinus [13]. Saimiri sciureus and Callithrix jacchus were used as outgroups. PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, 4.0b1 for Microsoft
Windows) software was used to build the cladogram,
which was then tested using the bootstrap method [24].

Results
Methods
Metaphasic chromosomes from four Cebus taxa (Table 1)
were obtained by lymphocyte [17] and fibroblast culture.
Karyotypes were organized following the protocol of
Matayoshi et al. (1986) [18].

Cytogenetic analysis
Diploid number analysis confirmed a range of 52 to 54
chromosomes in the genus Cebus. Cebus apella paraguayanus and C. a. robustus had 54 chromosomes (10 pairs were
biarmed and 16 pairs were one-armed). Cebus albifrons
had 52 chromosomes (9 pairs were biarmed and 16 pairs

were one-armed), as did C. olivaceus (10 pairs were
biarmed and 15 pairs were one-armed). Sex chromosomes were similar in all the species, with submetacentric
X chromosome and a small acrocentric chromosomes Y
chromosome.
With the exception of the human Y chromosome paint, all
human and S. oedipus probes painted chromosomes of C.
a. paraguayanus (CAP), C. a. robustus (CAR), C. albifrons
(CAL). Constitutive heterochromatin regions did not
show any signal of hybridization on any of the species.
Representative results from FISH experiments with
human probes are shown in Figures 1A1;A2;B1;2;C1;C2
and D(1 to 8), while experiments using S. oedipus probes
are shown in Figures 1A3;B3 and 1C3.
Cebus apella paraguayanus and Cebus apella robustus
Cebus apella paraguayanus and C. a. robustus displayed similar karyotypes. Human probes revealed 34 homologous
segments. Synteny was conserved in 12 human chromosomes: HSA 4, HSA 5, HSA 6, HSA 9, HSA 11, HSA 12,
HSA 13, HSA 17, HSA 19, HSA 20, HSA 22 and HSA X,
which corresponded to CAP 2, CAP 1, CAP 3, CAP 18,
CAP16, CAP 12, CAP 17, CAP 21, CAP 9, CAP 10, CAP 24
and CAP X in Cebus, respectively. Human associations
commonly found in other species of Platyrrhini were
found in these taxa, including 2b/16b, 3a/21, 5/7a, 8a/18,
10a/16a and 14/15a. SOE painting probes revealed 27
homologous segments. Eighteen conserved segments
were identified between these C. apella subspecies and S.
oedipus.

The SOE X and Y probes hybridized to the respective sex
chromosomes of both Cebus species. The G-banded karyotype of C. a. paraguayanus, together with a summary of
the chromosome painting results, is shown in Figure 2A.
Figure 2B shows the karyotype of C. a. robustus. The C. a.
paraguayanus male displayed a reciprocal translocation of
segments homologous to HSA 2a e 10a, which was confirmed using the SOE 10 and SOE 15 probes (Figure 2A,
inset). The two species differed in the distribution of constitutive heterochromatin, where the most obvious difference was the absence of the distal heterochromatic block
in chromosome 11 of C. a. robustus (Figure 3).
Cebus albifrons
Results of this study revealed the conservation of 11
human chromosomes (i.e., HSA 4, HSA 6, HSA 9, HSA 11,
HSA 12, HSA 13, HSA 17, HSA 19, HSA 20, HSA 22 and
X), corresponding to C. albifrons chromosomes CAL 2,
CAL 3, CAL 18, CAL 16, CAL 12, CAL 17, CAL 21, CAL 9,
CAL 10, CAL 24 and CAL X. Four human chromosomes
(i.e., HSA 5, HSA 14, HSA 18 and HSA 21) hybridized to
a single chromosome of C. albifrons, but associated with
other segments. We found seven human associations that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/169

were previously identified in Platyrrhini (i.e., 2b/16b, 3a/
21, 5/7a, 8a/18, 8b/15b, 10a/16a and 15/14a/15a/14a).
S. oedipus probes revealed 26 homologous segments (Figures 1C.1-C.3).
Cebus olivaceus
Results of this study revealed the conservation of nine
human chromosomes (i.e., HSA 4, HSA 6, HSA 9, HSA 11,
HSA 13, HSA 17, HSA 19, HSA 20 and HSA 22), corresponding to C. olivaceus chromosomes CGR 2, CGR 3,
CGR 18, CGR 16, CGR 17, CGR 21, CGR 9, CGR 10 and
CGR 24. We did not use human sex chromosome probes
on this species. Four human probes (i.e., HSA 5, HSA 12,
HSA 14 and HSA 18) hybridized to a single chromosome
of C. olivaceus, but associated with other segments. Seven
associations were found: 2/16, 3/21, 5/16/7, 8/18, 10a/
16, 14/15/14 and 15/12 (Figures D-1 to D-8). Of these, 5/
16/7 and 15/12 corresponded to autapomorphies.
Comparative analysis and phylogeny
Human and Saguinus oedipus painting results, in combination with the G-banding results, allowed for a detailed
comparison of chromosome homologies among members of the genus Cebus. A basic data matrix (BDM) was
built using alternative forms of the chromosomes as characters (Table 2). These characters were then used in a
binary matrix (Table 3). In this matrix the data of Cebus
apella sp are from Garcia et al. (2000) [14] and of C. capucinus are from Richard et al. (1996) [13]. PAUP analysis
resulted in a single cladogram (Figure 4) with 62 steps, a
consistency index of 0.968, a retention index of 0.926 and
a homoplasy index of 0.032.

Discussion
Many reports use morphological [25-28], molecular [2933] or chromosomal [34,35,21] data to dissect the phylogenetic relationships among New World monkeys at the
family level. However, ordering the species below the
genus level is a fundamental step toward reorganizing the
phylogenetic relationships among these taxa. This realization prompted us to analyze taxa from the genus Cebus to
better understand their chromosomal divergences and to
clarify their phylogenetic positions.
All of the syntenies in the putative ancestral Platyrrhini
karyotype (i.e., 3a/21, 5/7a, 2b/16b, 8a/18, 14/15a e 10a/
16a) were conserved in the Cebus species, consistent with
previous reports on C. apella sp. [14] and C. capucinus [13].
Our data in C. a. paraguayanus are quite similar with the
one described by Garcia et al. (2000) [14] on C. apella sp.
Interestingly, the 5/7a association was found in all but
one member of the genus Cebus. In C. olivaceus, this association possessed an additional segment homologous to
HSA16. This segment probably fused in tandem with
chromosome HSA7, followed by a paracentric inversion

that resulted in the association CGR 7/16/5, which has
not been reported before in New World primates. The
association 5/16 is found in Saimiri but not in the other
members of the genus Cebus. However, the segment
homologous to HSA16 has different sizes in these species,
which strongly supports the occurrence of a homoplasy.
Garcia et al. (2002) [15] described human chromosomal
painting in C. nigrivittatus, a synonymy for C. olivaceus.
They did not find the HSA16 fragment in pair 1 and also
the morphology of pair 10 is slightly different, with a
short arm in our sample. This can be a consequence of a
pericentric inversion or a heterochromatin heteromorphism.
Associations 2b/16b and 8a/18 were present without any
alterations in members of the genus Cebus. The association 14/15a is inverted in all Cebus species, revealing a
synapomorphy. In C. a. paraguayanus and C. a. robustus,
this association exists in a submetacentric pair. In C. albifrons, this association exists in a metacentric chromosome
due to a second inversion that gave rise to the association
15a/14/15a/14. A different inversion of HSA15a was
found in C. olivaceus, changing the morphology of
HSA15a from acrocentric to metacentric.

Associations 12/15 in C. olivaceus and 8/15/8 in C. albifrons, which was confirmed by the S. oedipus association
18/10/18, explain the reduction in diploid number from
54 to 52. An in tandem fusion, followed by a pericentric
inversion, occurred in C. albifrons. Conversely, a Robertsonian rearrangement occurred in C. olivaceus.
Chromosomal data were used to obtain a cladogram that
reconstructed a possible sequence of chromosome rearrangements leading to karyotypical differentiation into
the Cebus genus (Figure 4). The cladogram supports the
notion that the monophyly of Cebus. C. apella sp., C. a.
paraguayanus and C. a. robustus are closely related, sharing
two synapomorphic traits (i.e., the association 14/15/14
that resulted in a submetacentric chromosome and the
pericentric inversion that corresponded to the HSA8b
probe). C. capucinus occupies a more basal position, with
a chromosomal composition very similar to the putative
ancestral Platyrrhini karyotype, consistent with previous
reports by Richard et al. (1996) [13]. The phylogenetic
relationships of C. capucinus and C. albifrons, in relation to
the ancestral karyotype, are not clearly defined. However,
it is clear that the karyotype of C. albifrons differs from that
of C. capucinus by a pericentric inversion in the 14/15
association, which results in a metacentric association 15/

Cladogram obtained from an analysis of chromosome painting and G-banding data in Cebus taxa, with 62 steps
consistency index (CI) = 0.968, retention index (RI) = 0.926 and homoplasy index (HI) = 0.032.S. sciureus and C.
jacchus were outgroups.

14/15/14. We also identified an in tandem fusion, followed by a pericentric inversion involving the homologous human chromosomes HSA15b and HSA8b, in C.
albifrons. As C. olivaceus is closely related to C. apella, these
species share the chromosomal inversion homologous to
HSA20. Differentiation between C. olivaceus and C. apella
is possible via a pericentric inversion in the association
14/15/14 and a Robertsonian rearrangement in the chromosomes homologous to HSA12 and HSA15b on their
Figure 2c. Garcia et al. (2002) [15] left open two possibilities for chromosome 6 in the Cebus ancestral karyotype:
the ancestral form could be a metacentric like in CAL,
CCA, and CNI karyotypes or a submetacentric like in CAP.
Our cladistic analysis has shown that the ancestral form is
the metacentric.
This study used chromosome painting in conjunction
with G-banding to confirm the ability of these techniques
to generate consistent and reliable data. These data were
interpreted using a cladistic analysis capable of generating
a cladogram with a high degree of consistency. Future
studies should use molecular markers to further explore
the phylogeny described here.

Conclusion
Chromosome painting in several species of Cebus allowed
us to define all the rearrangements that ocurred during its
speciation. It was also possible to use FISH and G-banding

data, both from our results and from literature, to build a
cladogram that reconstructed a possible sequence of chromosome rearrangements leading to karyotypical differentiation into the Cebus genus.

Authors' contributions
PJSA carried out chromosome painting in Cebus olivaceus,
organized the data and wrote most of the paper. LFMF carried out chromosome painting in Cebus albifrons and contributed to the discussion of data. EHCO carried out
chromosome painting in C. a. robustus and contributed to
the discussion of data. AP collected the samples, classified
the species and discussed the phylogenetic implications of
the data. CYN carried out chromosome painting in Cebus
apella paraguayanus and performed the cladistic analysis.
JCP conceived of the study, participated of the techniques
development and coordinated the study. All authors read
and approved the final manuscript.
