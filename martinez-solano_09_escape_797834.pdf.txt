Abstract
Background: Island populations are excellent model systems for studies of phenotypic, ecological and
molecular evolution. In this study, molecular markers of mitochondrial and nuclear derivation were used
to investigate the evolution, structure and origin of populations of the California slender salamander
(Batrachoseps attenuatus) inhabiting the six major islands of San Francisco Bay, formed following the rising
of sea level around 9,000 years ago.
Results: There was a high degree of congruence in the results of analyses of nucleotide and allozyme data,
both of which strongly support the hypothesis that, for the majority of the islands, salamanders are
descended from hilltop populations that became isolated with the formation of the Bay ca. 9,000 years ago.
There are two exceptions (Alcatraz and Yerba Buena) where the evidence suggests that salamander
populations are wholly or in part, the result of anthropogenic introductions.
Comparison of the molecular data and the interpretations drawn therefrom with an earlier morphological
study of many of the same salamander populations show some of the same evolutionary trends.
Conclusion: In spite of marked differences between the evolutionary rates of the two kinds of molecular
markers, both indicate distinctive and similar patterns of population structure for B. attenuatus in the San
Francisco Bay Area and its islands. With the two noted exceptions, it is clear that most island populations
were established prior to the 9,000 years since the formation of the Bay. Results of coalescence-based
analyses suggest that for most island populations the mtDNA lineages from which they were derived date
from the Pleistocene.
It can be said that, based on observed values of genetic diversity, the last 9,000 years of evolution on these
islands have been characterized by relative stability, with the occasional extinction of some haplotypes or
alleles that were formerly shared between island and mainland populations but overall maintaining high
levels of variation (with the exception of Alcatraz). In contrast, there is some evidence for rapid
morphological changes between populations in some islands and their closest mainland counterparts. This
pattern of rapid morphological divergence (e. g., resulting from founder effects) is similar to that observed
in other studies about recent colonization of island habitats.

Background
Islands have long been the subjects of both theoretical
and empirical studies in Evolutionary Biology. They are
often regarded as "natural laboratories" for the study of
speciation because geographic isolation promotes morphological, ecological and genetic divergence of newly
established populations with respect to their mainland
counterparts and thus they offer an excellent opportunity
to identify key factors in species formation. In more recent
times, the use of molecular markers has added impetus to
the analysis of the complex processes involved in differentiation of island populations. The study of colonization
patterns and the effects of isolation on divergence may
allow identification of potential source populations either
from the mainland or other islands in a stepping stone or
sweepstake model of colonization. Characterization of
patterns of gene flow, with the addition of a temporal
component, especially in cases when geological information is available allows dating with some precision the
amount of time passed since populations have been isolated.
The islands of the San Francisco Bay (California, USA)
constitute an interesting system from an evolutionary perspective because their origin is relatively recent
(Holocene) and thus their study might provide clues to
understanding the consequences of population isolation
after the interruption of gene flow following the rising of
the sea level, especially in a short time scale (the last 9,000
years). The islands have been studied from different perspectives, including detailed geological, botanical and
faunistic surveys [1]. We note here that since the early days
of the European settlement of California, each of the
islands in our study region has been impacted by human
activities either by mining and/or building operations.
This has resulted in the establishment on the islands of
many non-native invertebrates, these are exemplified by
anthropochorus terrestrial isopods of European origin
where one to three species are flourishing on each of the
islands with the possible exception of Red Rock Island [2].
In the case of the latter island the robust population of the
native scorpion Uroctonus mordax may have prevented the
establishment of terrestrial isopods. However, on the
remaining islands where these isopods form a substantial
part of the slender salamander diet (pers. obs.) their presence is likely to have had a positive effect on salamander
populations.
Among the faunal surveys of the San Francisco Bay
islands, the salamanders in particular have been the subjects of thorough studies, including the description of
morphological variation and the collection of extensive
demographic data on these island populations [3]. This
study revealed an extraordinary variability within and
between islands as well as differences with respect to their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/38

closest mainland counterparts in both ecological and
morphological characters. However, a detailed genetic
study of the salamander populations on these islands,
which would provide a sound background from which to
view those previous studies and which would aid in producing robust hypotheses of the evolutionary processes
generating those patterns, has been lacking.
Of the two salamander species present on the islands of
the San Francisco Bay area, the most abundant is the California slender salamander (Batrachoseps attenuatus). Dispersal is very rare in this salamander, which has some of
the lowest reported home ranges in vertebrates and exhibits strong phylopatry, promoting isolation by distance.
Anderson [3] advanced two hypotheses to explain the
presence of salamander populations on the San Francisco
Bay islands. These two hypotheses can be tested by means
of data gathered from discrete molecular markers:
1) Populations were continuously distributed before sea
levels rose 9,000 years ago and were subsequently isolated
as hills or mountaintops became islands. In this case, we
would expect to find haplotypes that are exclusively found
on islands and similar values of genetic diversity on mainland and island populations.
2) Island populations were established more recently,
after sea levels rose, by rafting or by anthropogenic introduction. In this case, haplotypes found on islands would
include a subset of those found in nearby mainland populations and levels of genetic diversity would be lower on
islands due to founder effects.
Of course, each island constitutes a different "experiment", and test results may favor one or the other hypothesis, or combinations of both in different islands. For
instance, a third possibility would be that populations
were present before sea levels rose and were thereafter
augmented by occasional immigrants by rafting. However, with the data at hand it is problematic to discriminate between cases where we find a mixture of exclusive
(island) and widespread (mainland) haplotypes on
islands because of incomplete sorting of polymorphisms
(expected when population divergence times are recent, as
in our example) and cases where the same pattern is
caused by a long history of isolation followed by occasional immigration introducing mainland genetic variants in island populations.
A previous detailed phylogeographic study of B. attenuatus
[4] provides an historical context in which to analyze the
evolution of island populations of B. attenuatus in the
study region, including their most plausible evolutionary
origin. This phylogeographic study indicated that populations are geographically structured and exhibit a signifi-

cant pattern of isolation by distance, with populations in
geographic proximity generally exhibiting greater genetic
similarity, except in areas of narrow parapatry where some
of the five well-differentiated mtDNA lineages identified
in that study come into secondary contact. Several of these
mtDNA lineages within B. attenuatus coexist in the vicinity
of the San Francisco Bay, making more detailed examination necessary to understand the origin and evolutionary
affinities of the island populations. In this paper, we use
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and allozyme data (genetic
data of nuclear origin) to test hypotheses about the origin
of island populations and to reconstruct their evolutionary history. These results are then used to discuss the patterns of morphological differentiation between islands
and between island and mainland populations described
by Anderson [3].

Methods
Sampling
We compiled two independent, complementary datasets
to investigate the evolution of populations of B. attenuatus
on the islands of San Francisco Bay. Both of them include
samples from all islands studied originally by Anderson
[3] (Fig. 1): Angel (area = 445.1 hectares -ha-), Yerba
Buena (78.1 ha), Brooks (26.3 ha), East (11.7 ha) and
West (1.2 ha) Marin, and Red Rock (2.3 ha), as well as Alcatraz island (7.6 ha), which was not studied by Anderson
[3]. For West Marin island, only allozyme data was available for analyses. Details of collecting localities and sample sizes for mtDNA can be found in Table 1 and
Additional file 1.
mtDNA
Partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
were used to analyze patterns of genetic variation at different spatial scales in B. attenuatus. Details of DNA extrac-

tion, amplification and sequencing procedures are
reported in a previous paper [4]. The final dataset
included sequences from 711 individuals, of which 178
were already reported in that study and 94 were downloaded from GenBank (Accession Numbers: DQ348971–
DQ349064). The remaining 439 sequences were generated for this study and are also deposited in GenBank
(Accession Numbers: FJ417408–FJ417846).
Standard estimates of genetic variability in selected island
and mainland populations, including number of segregating sites, haplotypic diversity, nucleotide diversity and
average number of nucleotide differences within populations were estimated with the software package DNASP
[5].
At the broadest spatial scale, phylogenetic analyses were
used to identify the main mtDNA lineages within B. attenuatus and to investigate the phylogenetic affinities of
island populations (i.e., assign haplotypes found on
islands to the main mtDNA lineages identified in a previous study [4]). Sequences were collapsed to unique haplotypes with the computer program Collapse (D. Posada,
available at http://darwin.uvigo.es) prior to phylogenetic
analyses, which were based on Maximum Parsimony
(MP), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference
as implemented in the software packages PAUP, GARLI
and MrBayes v3.1.2 [6-8].
Because haplotypes found on islands did not form monophyletic groups in phylogenetic analyses, we further investigated population history by inferring population (rather
than gene) trees in the Southern_N clade, the most widespread in the study area. We used the "minimize deep coalescences" method [9] as implemented in Mesquite 2.01
[10] to recover the population tree that minimizes the

number of deep coalescences in the gene tree [11]. For this
analysis, we used as the preferred gene tree a ML tree estimated with PAUP with populations in ten predefined
groups based on geographic proximity. Each island conformed a group, whereas for mainland samples an arbitrary radius of three miles was used to delimit group
samples.
Finally, in order to estimate the temporal scale associated
with the evolutionary history of island populations, we
estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor
(TMRCA) of selected groups of haplotypes. These groups
include the five main mtDNA lineages identified in a previous study [4], reference mainland populations as well as
haplotypes found exclusively on islands. In the latter case,
TMRCAs represent a minimum colonization age for the

islands. When haplotypes occurring in mainland populations were also found on islands, we estimated the
TMRCA of those mainland + island haplotypes in order to
obtain further insight into the time of colonization. In
this case, TMRCAs represent a maximum time boundary
for island colonization. It must be kept in mind that TMRCAs estimate gene divergence and thus provide overestimates of population divergence, which are necessarily
more recent. The magnitude of this difference cannot be
assessed with single-locus methods, but it is the method
of choice for recent divergence time estimates [12]. The
software BEAST 1.4.8 [13] was used to estimate TMRCAs.
We used a GTR+I+G model of evolution on an un-partitioned dataset, and implemented an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock method [14]. We used a
normal distribution with a mean of 0.0075 and a standard

deviation of 0.0025 as a prior for mutation rate in cytochrome b to reflect a priori uncertainty in this parameter
based on the values reported by Mueller [15]. We also
used a lognormal prior for the root height parameter to
incorporate information from the fossil record (fossils
attributed to Batrachoseps dating from 5.3 million years
ago have been recovered in the vicinities of the San Francisco Bay Area [16], thus providing a minimum time estimate for the parameter root.height in BEAST analyses). Six
independent runs of different lengths and totaling 120
million generations were performed and subsequently
combined in LogCombiner (distributed as part of the
BEAST software package) to check for convergence of the
posterior distributions of parameters of interest and calculate 95% confidence intervals for selected TMRCAs.

number of genetic clusters in our dataset. Structure
assumes Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and uses Bayesian
algorithms to infer the assignment probability of any
given individual to each genetic cluster based on allele frequencies. It also identifies the number of genetic clusters
(K) with a highest posterior probability without taking
into account prior information on the number of sampling localities. We used an admixture model with correlated allele frequencies for values of K ranging from one
(panmixia) to eight clusters, and performed five runs for
each value of K, with a "burn-in" period of 500,000 iterations and posterior searches of 1,000,000 MCMC iterations. Individuals with 10% or more missing data were
excluded from the analyses, which included 949 individuals from the 14 populations sampled.

Allozymes
Approximately 1 to 2 mm of tissue excised from the tail
tip of the salamanders was mechanically homogenized in
an estimated five volumes of grinding buffer composed of
0.25 M sucrose containing 10 mM mercaptoethanol,
0.001 mM EDTA, 0.1 M MgCl2 and 0.01 M Tris adjusted
to neutrality with hydrochloric acid. Tissue homogenates
were stored frozen until needed for electrophoretic assay.

Results

For electrophoresis we used a standard horizontal starchgel system [17-19]. The gene products of a total of 21
enzyme-coding loci were assayed for electrophoretic variability, the loci scored are given in Additional file 2. Two
electrophoretic buffer systems were used. For Lactate
dehydrogenase we used the discontinuous Tris-citrateborate system [20] and for the remaining enzymes we
used a modification of the citrate-aminopropyl morpholine buffer [21] adjusted to pH 8.0. Electromorphs were
rendered visible for scoring using staining methods
[22,23]. Designation of loci followed Manchenko [24].
Alleles (electromorphs) were designated alphabetically
generally starting with the most common.
A total of 1148 individuals from 14 populations were
scored at 21 loci. Estimates of observed and expected heterozygosity (HO and HE), number of private alleles, and
allelic richness per population were calculated with the
software package Biosys-1 [25]. Tests of linkage disequilibrium and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were calculated
at each locus and population with Genepop [26].
We tested for genetic structure in the allozyme dataset
with three methods. First, we estimated pairwise FST values
[27] and their statistical significance in Arlequin version
2000 [28]. Additionally, we calculated Nei's genetic distances [29] with Biosys-1 and represented these values on
a bi-dimensional space through multidimensional scaling
[30] using the software package GenAlEx [31]. Finally, we
used the software "Structure" 2.2 [32] to infer the optimal

mtDNA
In the islands of San Francisco Bay we found mtDNA haplotypes corresponding to three of the five mtDNA lineages
identified in Martínez-Solano et al. (2007) [4]. The
remaining two lineages occur naturally only north of the
current study area and so their presence is not expected.
The most widespread of the lineages found in the Bay Area
is the Southern_N clade, present in the islands of East
Marin, Red Rock, Angel, Alcatraz and Yerba Buena. On
Yerba Buena Island, salamanders with haplotypes from
the Southern_S clade were found in sympatry with those
having haplotypes of the Southern_N clade in both of the
two localities sampled on the island. This is the only
instance so far identified over the range of B. attenuatus
where salamanders of two of the haplotype clades have
been found in sympatry. Finally, samples from Brooks
Island grouped with Martínez-Solano et al.'s (2007) [4]
Eastern mtDNA clade (Fig. 1).

In general, levels of mtDNA variability are high in all
islands studied, with unique haplotypes found on each
island with the exception of Alcatraz, where only one haplotype was found. This haplotype also occurs in the Angel
Island population. With this exception, all other haplotypes found on Angel Island and all from Red Rock are
unique to these two islands, whereas in the remaining
islands we found a mixture of exclusive island haplotypes
and those shared with mainland populations (Table 1).
For example, on East Marin we found haplotypes that are
also found in China Camp, on Yerba Buena there were
haplotypes also found in the populations of Pacifica and
Presidio and on Brooks island we found haplotypes that
are also present in the populations of Point Richmond,
Albany Hill, Point San Pablo, Berkeley and Oakland. Levels of haplotype diversity range from zero on Alcatraz to
0.901 in the mainland population of Marin Headlands.
Low diversity values are found in the populations of Presidio (mainland) with 0.189, only two haplotypes in 39

Kya = thousands of years ago. ISL, ISL1, ISL2 refer to groups of
haplotypes exclusively found on islands (see text for details).
Southern_N and Southern_S refer to haplotypes from these clades
found in sympatry on Yerba Buena Island.

haplotypes of the Southern_N clade, which is the most
widespread and genetically diverse in our dataset, recovered four groups having high support levels. The first of
these includes samples from the Point Reyes Peninsula
and vicinity. A second includes some haplotypes found in
East Marin Island as well as in North Bay localities. A third
includes haplotypes from several islands: Yerba Buena,
Angel Island, Alcatraz Island, as well as some from the
Marin Headlands population in the North Bay and others
from the northern end of the San Francisco Peninsula:
Presidio and Daly City. Finally, the fourth group includes
haplotypes from the North Bay (China Camp, San Rafael,
Tiburon, Belvedere, Strawberry Point) as well as haplotypes from the islands of Red Rock and East Marin.

The program "Mesquite" found 11 population trees that
minimized the number of deep coalescences in the best
ML gene tree for the pruned Southern_N dataset, including all island as well as reference mainland samples. Figure 3 represents a majority rule consensus of these trees.
The following relationships between populations were
recovered in all 11 trees: (China Camp+ East Marin), (San
Rafael + (China Camp + East Marin)), (Belvedere + Sausalito), (Presidio + Yerba Buena), and (Angel + (Presidio
+ Yerba Buena). The relationship between Marin Headlands and (Belvedere + Sausalito) was recovered in eight
out of 11 trees, whereas the relationship between (Red
Rock, Marin Headlands, Belvedere, Sausalito, San Rafael,
East Marin and China Camp) was recovered in six out of
11 trees.
Results of BEAST analyses are summarized in Table 3.
Median values for estimated time to most recent common
ancestors of gene copies (TMRCAs) date from the Pleistocene, with two exceptions: Yerba Buena and East Marin.
In the former, the estimated TMRCA of all haplotypes
sampled in the island indicates a coalescence time equivalent to that of the common ancestor of all haplotypes in
both the Southern_N and Southern_S clades and is therefore, on this measure, much older than the populations of
the remaining islands. Indeed, coalescence times for the
other islands individually correspond in age to each of
these clades separately and are more recent (Pleistocene).
The case of East Marin is different, because haplotypes
exclusively found on the island are part of two very divergent clades (ISL1 and ISL2, Figure 2 and Table 3), having
a common ancestor that may have originated in the
Pliocene. Within each of these clades, however, coalescence occurs in the Pleistocene. In other cases, TMRCAs
were very similar for islands and their closest mainland
populations (Angel vs Tiburon and Brooks vs Albany Hill,

correction [33] to results of global tests per locus and population, with the exception of locus sMDH (p = 0.0005).
This locus was therefore excluded in "Structure" analyses
in order to meet assumptions of this program. After
removal of this marker, all populations were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium.

found in each case. Note that Yerba Buena has mtDNA haplotypes corresponding to two clades.

Figure 4 shows the results of multidimensional scaling
based on pairwise Nei's [29] genetic distances. Three clusters are apparent: one composed of the populations of
Brooks Island and Albany Hill (East Bay), another
includes the mainland populations of the South Bay
(Stanford, Crystal Springs, Presidio) plus the islands of
Yerba Buena, Alcatraz and Angel; and a third group
includes populations in the North Bay (Marin Headlands,
Tiburon) as well as the islands of East and West Marin and
Red Rock. There is good agreement in pairwise genetic distances between populations based on mtDNA and allozymes (Mantel test, r = 0.711, p = 0.001).
Pairwise FST values between populations are significantly
different from zero in all cases (Table 5).

see Table 3). In any case, as indicated above, there are also
cases where TMRCAs between island and mainland populations differ substantially (see above and Table 3), making it difficult to extract conclusions about the potential
effects of founder events or population sizes in island
populations on TMRCA estimates.
Allozymes
Levels of polymorphism were also high in the allozyme
dataset, with values of mean number of alleles per locus
ranging from 1.4 in Alcatraz to 2.3 in Presidio and Marin
Headlands and percentages of polymorphic loci of 20–
45% (Table 4). All loci were in linkage equilibrium and
no significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilib-

The results of "Structure" analyses suggest that K = 3 is the
minimum number of clusters that best represents the
optimum population structuring in our dataset. The three
clusters correspond to three main groups of populations:
1) North Bay populations (populations with mtDNA of
the Southern_N clade of Martínez-Solano et al., 2007 [4]);
2) East Bay populations (populations with mtDNA of the
Eastern clade in Martínez-Solano et al., 2007 [4]); and 3)
San Francisco Peninsula populations (which include individuals with mtDNA from both the Southern_N and
Southern_S clades in Martínez-Solano et al. (2007) [4].
Assignment probabilities of each population to the three
clusters are shown in Table 6. Cluster 1 includes popula-

tions in the North Bay (China Camp, Tiburon and Marin
Headlands) plus the East and West Marin islands and Red
Rock. The second cluster includes populations bearing
mtDNA markers from the Eastern lineage in MartínezSolano et al. (2007) [4]: Brooks Island and Albany Hill.
These populations are consistently recovered as distinct
clusters in most analyses, with assignment probabilities
>85% in all cases. The third cluster includes populations
from the San Francisco Peninsula: Presidio, Stanford and
Crystal Springs as well as Alcatraz and Angel islands. This
group includes populations with mtDNA from the
Southern_N and Southern_S clades in Martínez-Solano et
al. (2007) [4], although, as indicated above, haplotypes
from these clades only occur simultaneously in the population of Yerba Buena island. The population from Yerba
Buena had assignment probabilities <70% to any of the
three clusters, although surprisingly the highest values
(62.3%) were associated with cluster 2 (East Bay). Other
populations with similar admixture values are East Marin
and Crystal Springs (Table 6). In both cases the populations involved are geographically close to areas where
major transitions in mtDNA are found.
A feature of the allozyme data that is in contrast to that of
the mtDNA findings for the island populations is the
infrequent occurrence of unique characters. Whereas each
island has one or more unique mtDNA haplotypes (Alcatraz Island excepted), private alleles, that is, alleles that
occur on a single island at very low frequency, are less
common than in the mainland samples (Table 4). There
are three private alleles for the Angel Island population
(loci LDH-A, PGM and AK) and one for East Marin Island

(GPI). Among the seven mainland localities sampled
there are 14 private alleles: five in Crystal Springs (sMDH,
LDH-B, PGDH, AAT-1 and SORDH), three in Tiburon
(PGM, PGDH and AAT-1), two in China Camp (GPI and
PGM) and Presidio (PGDH and GPDH) and one in Stanford (GPI). Conversely, where two or more alleles at a
locus occur at moderate to high frequencies, these alleles
are typically found throughout the study region in all populations, both island and mainland.

Discussion
Seawater is generally considered to be an effective barrier
retarding dispersal in amphibians. However, recent studies have shown that rafting is the only possible explanation for the presence of certain frog species on oceanic
islands far removed from any mainland source [34]. In the
case of Batrachoseps attenuatus, we have collected them at
the high tide mark in both East Marin and Red Rock
Islands, indicating some degree of salt tolerance in this
species (see [3], for a thorough discussion of this topic).
As suggested in that study, the genetic composition of
populations established by waifs would differ considerably from that observed in mainland populations that were
subsequently isolated by rising sea levels in that genetic
resources in the former would represent a highly selected
and limited portion of the gene pool of the parental mainland population [3]. Nevertheless, on none of the San
Francisco Bay islands is there any evidence from our data
for the establishment of Batrachoseps populations by
means of rafting. Indeed, the high levels of genetic variability occurring on most of the islands tend to argue
against this hypothesis. However, in the unlikely event
(because of the observed numbers of exclusive haplotypes
found on islands) that rafting was a common occurrence,
distinguishing between the two hypotheses could become
problematic because the impact of founder effects would
be diminished.
The patterns of genetic variation observed in slender salamander populations on the San Francisco Bay islands,
using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers, indicate
an early presence of the salamanders in the area rather
than recent colonizations. Levels of genetic diversity are
high, and in most islands exclusive mtDNA haplotypes
were found. Where island and mainland localities share
haplotypes the mainland populations are usually those
that are geographically closest to the island (Table 2). Estimated TMRCAs for island haplotypes clearly predate the
timescales associated with the formation of the Bay, 9,000
years ago. However, these estimates reflect gene divergence and thus necessarily predate the actual time of the
start of population divergence, although it seems safe to
hypothesize that populations were already established on
the hilltops that later became islands, probably before the
last interglacial period. Further, there was probably a sig-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:38

nificant pattern of genetic structuring prior to the formation of the Bay as we know it today.
There are exceptions to this pattern of early establishment
of differentiated populations: in the case of Alcatraz
Island, we found only a single mtDNA haplotype occurring in the 30 individuals sampled, with this haplotype
also occurring on Angel Island. In addition, levels of
genetic diversity in the allozyme data for Alcatraz Island
are also strikingly the lowest among the Bay islands (1.4
alleles per locus, 20% polymorphic loci, observed heterozygosity = 0.071, Table 4), and genetic distances are lowest with respect to Angel Island (DNei = 0.027). These
findings are consistent with a recent introduction involv-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/38

ing individuals from Angel Island, in keeping with the
proposal of previous studies [1]. This introduction event
could have taken place when land was taken from Angel
Island to level Alcatraz prior to construction of the prison
[1]. In the allozyme data, the fact that the same alleles are
observed in both populations, but sometimes in very different frequencies suggests the existence of a founder
effect in the Alcatraz population. This pattern is evident,
for instance, in the sMDH and ADA loci (Figure 5).
Genetic signals of a founder effect would be expected if
the hypothesis of a recent, anthropogenic introduction is
correct, and they might also explain why the Alcatraz population stands as genetically distinct in some analyses, as
reflected in high FST values (Table 5).
With respect to the evolutionary history of salamander
populations in the study region, data derived from both
mitochondrial and nuclear genes support the existence of
three distinct evolutionary units, although there are discordances with respect to their individual limits. The two
major barriers identified by both mtDNA and allozymes
seem to be associated with the Colma and Raccoon Straits
(Figs. 1 and 3, see below). According to mtDNA data,
three mtDNA clades coexist in close proximity in the
region, with the Southern_N clade being the most widespread and present in most of the island populations. The
deepest split between mtDNA haplotypes is that between
the Eastern and the Southern (including both the
Southern_S and Southern_N) clades, which might date as
far back as the Miocene [4]. This pronounced break is also
apparent in the allozyme data and is apparently unrelated
to any present geographic feature. Allelic frequencies at
some loci are markedly different in the Eastern populations of Brooks Island and Albany Hill with respect to
other populations (for example, in loci IDH-2 and PGDH,
Figure 5). Higher genetic distances are observed in comparisons between the two Eastern populations and the
remaining populations than in any other comparison
(Table 5). Results from "Structure" analyses recover the
two Eastern populations as a distinct cluster for most values of K (all analyses with K = 3 to K = 8), with high
assignment probabilities in all cases, also highlighting the
genetic distinctiveness of these populations among the
total. This is in agreement with Anderson's [3] conclusions regarding morphological differentiation of island
populations with respect to the mainland.

Morphometric variables studied by Anderson (1960) [3]
included: snout-vent length, tail length, head width, limb
length, number of vomerine teeth and number of costal
grooves. His results indicated mainland populations
grouped into two main types: a general "mainland" type
exemplified by populations in Marin Peninsula, Sonoma
and San Mateo counties, and a second group including
the populations of Berkeley and Point Richmond, in the

Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:38

East Bay. He found no evidence for an "island type".
Instead, he found the populations of Red Rock and
Brooks Island to be most differentiated morphologically
from mainland populations and from each other. But the
Brooks Island population was more similar to the Point
Richmond and Berkeley populations in his sample,
whereas that on Red Rock showed affinities to Angel
Island and East Marin in body proportions. This pattern of
morphological variation is totally concordant with
genetic data and thus the observed similarities between
populations probably reflect a shared evolutionary history rather than the effect of similar adaptive factors associated with evolution on the highly simplified island
environments [3].
The observed high genetic distances between the five
mtDNA clades identified in a previous study [4] raised the
possibility that B. attenuatus is in fact a complex of cryptic
species. However, values of DNei between the Eastern populations from Brooks Island and Albany Hill and the
remaining populations range from 0.079–0.142 (the
comparisons involving Alcatraz are outlier values of DNei
= 0.152–0.180, perhaps related to the existence of a
founder effect in this population, see above and Table 5).
These values are within the range observed in intraspecific
studies [35], suggesting that gene flow and balancing
selection for different alleles are major forces maintaining
genetic cohesion in B. attenuatus across very divergent
mtDNA boundaries.
Both the Eastern and the Southern_N clades show much
higher values of genetic diversity in populations north of
the San Francisco Bay, suggesting colonization of today's
islands as well as the San Francisco Peninsula was a comparatively recent event. This is evident in the relatively low
levels of haplotypic variation observed in the Presidio
population with respect to Marin County populations
(Table 1). On the contrary, the Southern_S clade shows
much higher levels of genetic diversity at the southern end
of its range, near the Santa Cruz Mountains, and it seems
likely that their establishment at the southern end of the
San Francisco Peninsula is also a recent event. The sharp
mtDNA break between the Southern_N and Southern_S
clades is correlated with the geological feature known as
the Colma Strait, a sea pass which was the main drainage
of the Bay before the opening of the Golden Gate. The
Colma Strait was open at a minimum between 570,000
and 125,000 years ago [36], and probably had a major
effect as a barrier to dispersal in slender salamanders.
Some authors have suggested that during the last interglacial, 125,000 years ago, Marin County and the San Francisco Peninsula north of the Colma Strait were connected
[36], which would have allowed colonization of this area
by the Southern_N clade at this time while preventing
gene flow between mtDNA clades Southern_S and
Southern_N. However, this sharp break in mtDNA haplo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/38

type distribution between the Southern_N and
Southern_S clades is not evident in the allozyme dataset,
where the two groups that are consistently recovered in
different analyses correspond to populations north of the
Bay (plus the Marin Islands and Red Rock) on the one
hand and populations in the San Francisco Peninsula
(plus Angel Island, Alcatraz and the admixed Yerba Buena
population) on the other (Figures 3 and 4). This suggests
extensive gene flow across mtDNA boundaries following
secondary contact after the Colma barrier ceased to exist.
In contrast, this allozyme split seems to be related to the
present configuration of the drainage of the SacramentoSan Joaquin rivers, with the two deepest channels in the
Bay being Raccoon Strait (separating Angel Island from
the formerly connected Tiburon Peninsula) and the
Golden Gate (separating Marin County from the San
Francisco Peninsula) (Fig. 3) [37].
An interesting pattern that demands further explanation is
that observed on Yerba Buena Island. On the one hand,
notwithstanding our extensive sampling, it remains the
only instance from across the species range where we
found coexistence of salamanders of two different mtDNA
lineages. However, in addition to the haplotypes from
both clades occurring on the island there are as well mainland haplotypes that are also found in the geographically
closest mainland populations (Presidio and Pacifica),
suggesting that this contact zone was established naturally
rather than being related to anthropogenic introductions.
However, the allozyme data for the Yerba Buena population suggest a complex history with discordant pictures
derived from the mitochondrial and nuclear data. This
population stands out from others as genetically distinct,
and although "Structure" analyses suggest that this is
clearly an admixed population with assignment probabilities to inferred clusters always <70%, some analyses,
including the preferred structuring into three clusters,
indicate a significant genetic input from populations in
the Eastern clade (Table 6). This is surprising because not
a single mtDNA haplotype of the Eastern clade was
observed in our sample. However, because we did not use
the same samples for mtDNA and allozyme analyses, it
remains to be tested whether this is an artifact of the sampling or whether the contact zone actually involves the
meeting of three rather than two mtDNA lineages, with
one of them having been extirpated from the contact
zone. The fact that salamanders of the two haplotype lineages occur in microsympatry and that the allozyme data
show a close correspondence between observed and
expected heterozygote classes and overall heterozygosities
(see Table 4) suggests that currently the Yerba Buena Batrachoseps population is panmictic. Another, perhaps more
plausible explanation for the presence of Eastern clade
allozyme characters on Yerba Buena Island is recent
anthropogenic introduction. The totally man-made artificial island, known as Treasure Island, which is narrowly

connected to Yerba Buena Island was constructed in part
of rock quarried on Brooks Island. Anderson [3] considered Yerba Buena Island to be the most likely of those he
studied to have had its salamander population influenced
by introductions from the outside and cited the decades of
house building and extensive landscaping as producing
the conditions for the introduction of Batrachoseps, possibly from multiple sources. None-the-less, if this explanation is accepted, the absence of an mtDNA Eastern
haplotype is puzzling.
Because of their small size, West Marin and Red Rock
Islands are the only two among the Bay islands on which
initial Batrachoseps populations may have been small
enough to have had their gene pools affected by detectable genetic drift. East Marin and West Marin Islands are in
close proximity, the channel separating them being only
170 m. wide and of shallow depth. It seems probable that
prior to their isolation from each other, and notwithstanding the low vagility of Batrachoseps, the two populations would have constituted a single deme. This
conjecture is bolstered by analyses of the allozyme data,
where values for pairwise Nei's genetic distances and FST
are, excepting those separating Brooks Island and Albany
Hill, the lowest in the dataset (Table 5) and allele frequencies at single loci are similar for the two islands (data not
shown).
The Red Rock Island Batrachoseps population presents a
different genetic picture. The closest mainland is to the
east, where genetic characteristics correspond to the East
Bay clade, typified by Brooks Island, Point Richmond,
Albany Hill, Oakland and Berkeley Hills populations.
Anderson [3], in his study of the Red Rock population
using morphometric and meristic characters found that
the means for each of these characters were most similar
to those of the west side of the Bay, typified by Marin
County and the San Francisco Peninsula, rather than
those of the East Bay. Moreover, means for these character
states were the most diverged of all populations and had
deviations from the mean strikingly lower than all other
populations. These findings were interpreted to indicate
that the Red Rock population was founded by waif dispersal, thereby resulting in a much-reduced gene pool for this
founder population [3]. Strong freshwater currents from
the San Joaquin – Sacramento Delta to the north and tidal
currents from the South Bay along with experimental evidence showing that gravid female Batrachoseps are capable
of surviving a period of rafting are cited as additional evidence in support of this hypothesis [3]. Further, the high
incidence of tail autotomy in the Red Rock Batrachoseps
population was conjectured to be the result of heavy predation by the salamander Aneides lugubris, another factor
which, together with competition for spatial resources
with the same species, have been suggested to have influ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/38

enced the fast evolution of morphological differences by
keeping the population small enough for genetic drift to
occur [3,38].
In contrast, if waif dispersal is the source of the Red Rock
Batrachoseps population, it seems more likely that the
strong tidal current through the Golden Gate sweeping
the shores of the Marin Headlands and the northern end
of the San Francisco Peninsula would be the mediator and
would account for the similarity between these populations and that of Red Rock Island. However, regardless of
tides and currents, our data suggest a different scenario for
the origin of the Red Rock Island Batrachoseps population.
In a sampling of only seven animals, two unique mtDNA
haplotypes were found. This is comparable with all other
island populations save that of Alcatraz (Table 1). In addition, allelic diversity found in our allozyme data (Table 4)
is not reduced relative to other populations, again excepting Alcatraz. This argues against the founding of the Red
Rock population by one or a few waifs. Rather, the genetic
marker characteristics of this population suggest the isolation of a pre-existing population typical of the
Southern_N clade [4] as the more plausible hypothesis.

Conclusion
In summary, our study provides a general picture of the
results of 9,000 years of independent evolution of salamander populations on at least four of the islands in San
Francisco Bay: East Marin, Red Rock, Angel and Brooks
Island. Additionally, signal of older historical events that
predate island formation is also prominent in our dataset;
genetic and morphometric data delineate well-differentiated lineages that diverged from a common ancestor in
the Miocene (Southern_N vs. Eastern, see [4]). These lineages meet in the proximity of San Francisco Bay and are
present on different islands (East Marin, Red Rock and
Angel: Southern_N; Brooks: Eastern). This indicates that,
contrary to findings in other taxa from areas that were
heavily affected by Quaternary glaciations, salamander
populations were genetically structured well before the
Bay islands were formed during the Holocene, and therefore the observed phylogeographic structure is old, rather
than a shallow, transient signal produced by recent stochastic factors [39]. In addition, the origin of haplotypes
that are exclusively found on certain islands exceeds considerably the age of those islands and therefore those haplotypes probably evolved in situ wellbefore sea levels rose.
Thus, from a genetic standpoint it can be said that the last
9,000 years of evolution on these islands have been characterized by relative stability, with the occasional extinction of some haplotypes or alleles that were formerly
shared between island and mainland populations but
overall maintaining high levels of variation (with the
noted exception of Alcatraz). In contrast, there is some
evidence for rapid morphological changes between popu-

lations in some islands and their closest mainland counterparts (Red Rock vs. Marin County populations, Brooks
Island vs. Point Richmond) [3]. This pattern of rapid morphological divergence (e. g., resulting from founder
effects) is similar to that observed in other studies of
recent colonization of island habitats [40-43].
