Abstract
Background: In 2005 huge epizooty of H5N1 HPAI occurred in Russia. It had been clear that
territory of Russia becoming endemic for H5N1 HPAI. In 2006 several outbreaks have occurred.
To develop new vaccines and antiviral therapies, animal models had to be investigated. We choose
highly pathogenic strain for these studies.
Results: A/duck/Tuva/01/06 belongs to Quinghai-like group viruses. Molecular markers – cleavage
site, K627 in PB2 characterize this virus as highly pathogenic. This data was confirmed by direct
pathogenic tests: IVPI = 3.0, MLD50 = 1,4Log10EID50. Also molecular analysis showed sensivity of
the virus to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. Serological analysis showed wide crossreactivity of this virus with sera produced to H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated earlier in South-East Asia.
Mean time to death of infected animals was 8,19+/-0,18 days. First time acute delayed hemorrhagic
syndrome was observed in mice lethal model. Hypercytokinemia was determined by elevated sera
levels of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-10.
Conclusion: Assuming all obtained data we can conclude that basic model parameters were
characterized and virus A/duck/Tuva/01/06 can be used to evaluate anti-influenza vaccines and
therapeutics.

Backgound
Influenza A (H5N1) virus now becomes a real threat for
humans. Since 1997, when first human case of H5N1
HPAI had been reported, more than 317 people were
infected and 191 died [1]. Before 2005 attention was
attracted to Thailand, Vietnamese and Indonesian viruses.
In the beginning of 2005 outbreak on Quinghai lake
occurred [2]. Later "Quinghai-like" viruses spreaded to
most part of Russia, European countries and Africa and
caused numerous outbreaks. Only in Russia more than 1
million of different species and sorts of poultry died and

been slaughtered [3]. Confirmed cases in Azerbaijan,
Egypt, Iraq, and Turkey was caused by Quinghai-like
viruses. Earlier HPAI viruses were investigated in mice
[4,5] and murine models were successively used for
reverse genetics made influenza vaccines [6]. It was shown
that H5N1 HPAI viruses could have different pathogenicity for mice [7]. Several molecular markers were choused
to explain differences. Multibasic cleavage site with 627K
in PB2 designate to highly pathogenic phenotype for
mice. Also important role of pulmonary cytokines elevation was highlighted [8]. Combination of adaptation for

wild waterfowl and high virulence for mammals makes
Quinghai-like viruses presumably pandemic. Also, in
future, because of ability for rapid spreading for long distances, this group of viruses can appear in North and
South America and cause outbreaks.
Human disease caused by HPAI viruses can be characterized as acute viral pneumonia aggravated by ARDS, toxic
shock and multiple organ failure. System dysfunction
mediated by hypercytokinemia and high viral load [9]. To
be ready for new influenza pandemy it is necessary to use
animal models, in vaccine and antivirals studies, which
most closely reflect human disease. Isolates from FRSI
SRC VB "VECTOR" repository which were characterized
previously were examined for MLD50, molecular markers
of pathogenicity, sensitivity to amantadines and neuraminidase inhibitors, to be candidates for murine model.
Among the investigated isolates A/duck/Tuva/01/06 has
best features to be used.

Results
Molecular characteristics
Genes of A/duck/Tuva/01/06 were sequenced and analyzed for molecular markers of pathogenicity. Also phylogenetic analysis was performed. Results are presented in
figure 1. A/duck/Tuva/01/06 belongs to group of Qinghailike viruses. HA contains 5 polybasic aminoacids
(PQGRRKKKR↓GL) in cleavege site of HA [15]. The receptor binding domen can be characterized as "avian" [16].
High pathogenicity to mammals in general correlates with
presence of 627K in PB2 [17].

The analysis of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) which also
could be contributed for high virulence of H5N1 viruses
revealed deletion of 5 amino acids similar to those in
H5N1 viruses of genotype Z which could be contributed
to increased expression of TNF-α and IP-10 protein in primary human macrophages [18]. A/duck/Tuva/01/06 con-

tained Glu92 in the NS1 and contained "avian-like" PDZdomain ligand ESEV [19]. It was shown that the most
recent H5N1 strains isolated in Southeast Asia were resistant to amantadine and rimantadine; antiviral drugs targeted the M2 ion channels of influenza A viruses [20,21].
It was also reported about Oseltamivir resistant H5N1
viruses isolation from humans [22,23]. To determine the
potential sensitivity of studied H5N1 viruses to these antivirals, amino acid sequences of the M2 and NA proteins
were analyzed.
Variants of influenza A viruses resistant to amantadine
possessed amino acid substitutions at one of 5 residues
(26, 27, 30, 31, and 34) in the M2 protein [24,25].
Sequence analysis did not reveal any mutations associated
with resistance to amantadine. Thus all A/duck/Tuva/01/
06 is potentially sensitive to this class of antiviral agents.
Amino acid residues 119, 274, 292 and 294 in the NA protein (numbering according to the HA of H2 subtype) are
crucial for the sensitivity of influenza A viruses to neuraminidase inhibitors [26]; substitution H274→Y in the
NA conferred resistance to Oseltamivir was observed in
clinical H5N1 isolates [25,26]. Sequence comparison of
the NA protein of A/duck/Tuva/01/06 aligned with the
NA of N2 subtype of A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2) influenza
virus showed phenotype potentially sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors.
Serological features
A/duck/Tuva/01/06 showed wide cross-reactivity with
sera against H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated earlier in SouthEastern Asia. HI results can be found in table 1. These features persuade to use this virus in studies of vaccines made
from various H5N1 influenza viruses.
Animal studies
First MID50 and MLD50 for A/duck/Tuva/01/06 were determined (table 2). To determine mean time to death (m.t.d)

5MLD50 was chosen to get 90–100% mortality rates. Disease can be characterized as violent. Within third and
fourth days p.i. all mice demonstrated severe sickness with
ruffling of the fur, anorexia and rapid weight loss (data
not showed). Also we observed lack of motion activity,
group forming. To day 6 mice showed breathlessness, cyanosis and in common – transition to terminal condition.

In case of infection by 5MLD50 m.t.d. was 8,19 ± 0,18
days. Animals which live till 8–9 days usually had paralyses and paresises (figure 2D, ARDS and figure 2A). Also
several atypical manifestations in infected mice were
occured during the duration of the experiment. We
observed several cases of acute delayed hemorrhagic syndrome with visible intestinal (3 animals totally), intracutaneous hemorrhages (4 animals totally), see figures 2B

and 2C. In several cases (9 animals totally) the disease was
complicated by severe intestine atony, which can independently lead to death or by pressuring on diaphragm
can intensify respiratory failure.
We also determined virus titers in several organ tissues. As
it was expected the highest titers was observed in lungs –
5,3 log EID50. Brain titers were also high – 3,4 log EID50.
In spleen, liver and kidney tissues virus titers were lower
then 1 logEID50 and considered not significant.
Cytokines
We investigated the involvement of several cytokines in
immunopathogenesis of experimental H5N1 HPAI infection in mice. Results of ELISA technique revealed alteration of expression both pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines after the challenge (figure 3). In
general, the most marked changes of cytokine levels were
observed before the death of mice.

The minimal concentration of IFN-γ was detected on day
5 (14.3 ± 10.8 pg/ml), however, its levels enlarged about
8-fold (256 ± 27 pg/ml) during the course of the infection
when compared with uninfected animals. On days 3 and
5 systemic production of TNF-α was below the detection
limit of the assay. A peak was reached on day 7 by the
cytokine (24 ± 3.2 pg/ml) and its levels remained elevated
on day 8. Interestingly, concentrations of IL-1β in mice
after the challenge were significantly lower in comparison
with the constitutive expression of the mediator in intact
animals. An abrupt decrease of IL-1β was detected on day
3 post infection, but was followed by step increase from
day 5. After the 2.5-fold enlargement on day 3 the levels
of IL-6 decreased dramatically on day 5, and the highest
levels of the cytokine were determined at the end of observation period (133 ± 12 pg/ml). The constitutive production of IL-10 was undetectable. The dynamics of IL-10
showed a gradual growth with the maximum level (92.1 ±
6.0 pg/ml) reached before the death of mice. We observed
statistically significant increase of IL-12 after the challenge. Concentrations of the cytokine retained constant in
infected mice, except the unexpected decline occurred on
day 7. The expression of IL-18 could not be detected
throughout the entire period of observation.

Discussion
Until 2005 avian influenza was regional problem of several Asian countries. It becomes endemic in Vietnam,
Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia and South part of China.
Main way of spreading was life poultry markets and later
after quarantine measures establishment life birds smuggling becomes one of the main ways. Even if H5N1 HPAI
could appear with chicken meet or life birds, dissemination of virus would be stopped by strait quarantine measures. But in 2005 completely adapted to wild waterfowl
virus appeared in Quinghai province of China and rapidly
speeded. In Russia 9 outbreaks among wild birds were
reported [4] and question "why had only some wild
waterfowl died?" is still unclear. Most of the outbreaks in
Russia associated with wild birds. The same time viruses
adapted to wild birds are extremely pathogenic for poultry
and mice. This "competitive advantage" makes Quinghailike viruses most probable candidate to be precursor for
new pandemic influenza virus. At the same time pathogenesis of different (phylogenetical clades) HPAI reveal
common causes. The principal causes of rapid mice death
after infecting with HPAI are primary viral pneumonia,
ARDS, lesions of central nervous system and multiple
organ failure. Our data suggest that A/duck/Tuva/01/06
strain of HPAI caused lethal pneumonia and spread systemically to the brain in BALB/c mice. Lesion of respiratory epithelium and following an activation of
monocytes/macrophages results in a release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) which are a hallmark of
ARDS in murine model [27]. Despite powerful anti-influenza virus effects of TNF-α in lung tissue, as it was
described previously [28], we consider that elevated production of the cytokines seems to be crucial in the pathogenesis of HPAI infection. Moreover, it was shown that
lethal H5N1 viruses are resistant to antiviral effects of
interferons and TNF-α [29]. Virus-induced overexpression
of TNF-α as well as high IFN-γ lead to activation of
endothelium and imbalance in blood coagulation system
[30]. This may explain the hemorrhagic syndrome as
observed in some of animals. To pay attention that IL-12
is a potent inducer of IFN-γ synthesis by blood mononuclear cells [31], we concluded the same cytokines hyperproduction reflects macrophage overactivation and
subsequent hypercytokinemia. This cascade of events

1,4EID50. Also molecular analysis showed sensivity of the
virus to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. Serological analysis showed wide cross-reactivity of this virus
with sera produced to H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated earlier
in South-East Asia. Mean time to death of infected animals was 8,19 ± 0,18 days. First time acute delayed hemorrhagic syndrome was observed in mice lethal model.
Hypercytokinemia was determined by elevated sera levels
of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10. Assuming all obtained data we can
conclude that basic model parameters were characterized
and virus A/duck/Tuva/01/06 can be used to evaluate
anti-influenza vaccines and therapeutics.

including inflammatory mediator production, changes in
blood coagulation system and microvascular permeability
was denoted as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [32]. On the other hand, we proposed that
the prominent production of IL-10 from the early stages
of the experimental HPAI infection was the compensatory
response to overproduction of proinflammatory
cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12. However, the
role of IL-10, which principle function seems to be containment and eventual termination of inflammation [33],
in HPAI pathogenesis is unclear. Also there is an uncertain
discrepancy between undetectable expression of IL-18 and
high levels of other Th1-cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-12).
Summing up, in our study BALB/c mice infected with
HPAI, strain A/duck/Tuva/01/06, appeared to be able to
produce the innate immune response, which culminated
to the development of shock and subsequent multiple
organ failure. The main characteristics of our model are
comparable to the previously described fatal cases of
H5N1 influenza in humans [10,11]. Proposed model
reflects lesions not only same organs but also mediating
levels of some (IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10) cytokines in terminal
conditions.
The implication of different cytokines in immunopathogenesis of experimental HPAI is beyond question. But to
understand exact mechanisms, which determine the disease outcome, further experiments remain to be done.

Materials and methods
All experiments were performed in BSL 3+ facilities of
FSRI SRC VB "Vector" of Rospotrebnadzor licensed for
working with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.
Stock of A/duck/Tuva/01/06 was produced in 9 days-old
chicken embryos. Allantoic fluid was aliquoted and stored
at -80°C. The infectivity of stock viruses was determined
in 10 days-old embryonated chicken eggs; titers were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench [10] and were
expressed as log10 of 50% egg infective dose (EID50) in 1
ml of allantoic fluid.
Viral RNA isolation RT-PCR and Sequencing
Viral RNA was isolated from virus-containing allantoic
fluid with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as
specified by the manufacturer. Uni-12 primer was used for
reverse transcription. PCR was performed with a set of
primers specific for each gene segment of Influenza A
virus [11]. PCR products were purified with the QIAquick
PCR purification (Qiagen).

Sequencing was done with Beckman Coulter GenomeLab™ Methods development kit Dye terminator Cycle
Sequencing according instructions of manufacturer. Primers for sequence were obtained from E. Hoffman (SJCRH,
Memphis, TN). Sequence products were analyzed on
automatic sequence analyzer Beckman Coulter CEQ2000.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Phylogenetical analysis was done on HA full gene
sequence DQ861291 using MEGA 2.1 software. Phylogenetical tree was built by Neighbor-Joining method; matrix
of distances was counted with p-distance algorithm. Reliability of clades was checked with bootstrap analysis with
500 replications. Other genes in GenBank DQ861291–
DQ861295.

Conclusion
A/duck/Tuva/01/06 belongs to Quinghai-like group
viruses. Molecular markers – cleavage site, K627 in PB2
characterize this virus as highly pathogenic. This data was
confirmed by direct pathogenic tests: IVPI = 3.0, MLD50 =

Serological characterization
Cross-reaction of A/duck/Tuva/01/06 was defined by
hemagglutination inhibition test (HI) with 0.5% CRBC
[12] with a panel of antisera against H5N1 HPAI.

Animal Studies
Six-week-old inbred male BALB/c mice (vivarium of FRSI
SRC VB "Vector"). Animals were placed to individual
cages with food and water available ad libitum. To determine the MLD50 and MID50, mice were anaesthetized by
diethyl ether inhalation and infected intranasally with 50
µl 10-fold serial dilutions of allantoic fluidin PBS (pH
7,2). Each group contained 10 animals. Animals were
observed daily for 15 days for mortality (MLD50) or sacrificed on day 5 after the challenge with following virus
detection in the lungs by inoculation of 10 days-old
embryonated chicken eggs (MID50). MLD50 and MID50
were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. Animals from group where 1MLD50 had been observed were
taken to determine virus titers in lung, spleen, kidneys,
and liver and brain tissues. Mind time to death (m.t.d)
was calculated as previously described [13]. Pathogenicity
to chickens was determined by IVPI test [14]. All animal
studies were performed according protocols approved by
Animal Care & Use committee of FSRI SRC VB "Vector".
Cytokines
To determine IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL1-β, IL-12 we
use ELISA R& D Systems kits (Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Serum levels of IL-18 were measured using commercial
Mouse IL-18 ELISA test kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Detection limits were as follows: TNF-α, less then 5,1 pg/ml;
IL1-β, 3,0 pg/ml; IL6, 3,1 pg/ml; IL10, 4,0 pg/ml; IL-18, 25
pg/ml. Sera was taken on 0,3,5,7,8 days and aliquots and
stored -80°C upon usage. Day 8 was chosen because m.t.d
defined earlier in the work was 8,19 ± 0,18 days. Statistics
was performed with Student t-test. Values p < 0,05 considered to be reliable.
