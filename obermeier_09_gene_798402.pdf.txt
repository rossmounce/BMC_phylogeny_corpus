Abstract
Background: Serial analysis of gene expression (LongSAGE) was applied for gene expression
profiling in seeds of oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. napus). The usefulness of this technique for
detailed expression profiling in a non-model organism was demonstrated for the highly complex,
neither fully sequenced nor annotated genome of B. napus by applying a tag-to-gene matching
strategy based on Brassica ESTs and the annotated proteome of the closely related model crucifer
A. thaliana.
Results: Transcripts from 3,094 genes were detected at two time-points of seed development, 23
days and 35 days after pollination (DAP). Differential expression showed a shift from gene
expression involved in diverse developmental processes including cell proliferation and seed coat
formation at 23 DAP to more focussed metabolic processes including storage protein accumulation
and lipid deposition at 35 DAP. The most abundant transcripts at 23 DAP were coding for diverse
protease inhibitor proteins and proteases, including cysteine proteases involved in seed coat
formation and a number of lipid transfer proteins involved in embryo pattern formation. At 35
DAP, transcripts encoding napin, cruciferin and oleosin storage proteins were most abundant.
Over both time-points, 18.6% of the detected genes were matched by Brassica ESTs identified by
LongSAGE tags in antisense orientation. This suggests a strong involvement of antisense transcript
expression in regulatory processes during B. napus seed development.
Conclusion: This study underlines the potential of transcript tagging approaches for gene
expression profiling in Brassica crop species via EST matching to annotated A. thaliana genes. Limits
of tag detection for low-abundance transcripts can today be overcome by ultra-high throughput
sequencing approaches, so that tag-based gene expression profiling may soon become the method
of choice for global expression profiling in non-model species.

Background
Seed developmental processes of plants are complex and
follow coordinated gene expression programs. Some
genes are exclusively expressed during seed development
[1]. Understanding the genetics of developmental proc-

esses and regulatory networks involved in embryogenesis
and seed development is crucial for improvement of seed
quality in crop plants. Gene expression during seed development has been studied intensively in the model plant
Arabidopsis thaliana using mutagenesis [2,3] and microarPage 1 of 16

ray analyses (e.g., [3,4]). These studies revealed major
gene expression changes during seed filling and desiccation, along with distinct expression patterns related to carbohydrate metabolism, lipid biosynthesis and storage
protein accumulation. However, the regulatory mechanisms that ensure the proper execution of seed development in A. thaliana and other plants remain largely
unknown. Furthermore, generalisation of findings regarding gene regulation from model to crop plants is difficult
because most major crops have considerably more complex genomes.
Oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. napus), the closest major
crop relative of A. thaliana, is the world's second most
important oilseed crop. The high-value nutritional oil is
also an excellent substrate for biodiesel production,
whereas the protein-rich seed meal remaining after oil
extraction is a valuable livestock feed. Oligonucleotide
microarrays constructed for A. thaliana have been used in
the past for expression profiling in B. napus, but have not
provided optimal signal intensity and reproducibility [47]. Recently the total number of ESTs from Brassica species
deposited in public databases has risen dramatically to
more than 800,000 entries with about 280,000 from seed
developmental stages. 67,000 ESTs from seed developmental stages have been used to develop a B. napus cDNA
microarray for analysis of seed gene expression patterns
[7].
An alternative for accurate, quantitative global expression
profiling is serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE; [8]),
which in contrast to microarray hybridization allows the
detection of new transcripts. SAGE is an expression profiling technique that simultaneously measures the levels of
thousands of genes expressed in a given tissue. The
method is based on the excision of short tags from poly
A+ RNAs and end-to-end ligation of ditags to form high
molecular weight concatemers. This allows cost-effective
high-throughput cloning and sequencing of concatemers.
Matching of tags to genomic sequences is a critical step in
SAGE data analysis, and normally this requires the availability of high quality genome annotation data [9]. SAGE
was first used for quantification of gene expression in
human using 13–15 bp tags [8]. Modifications of the original SAGE protocols producing 21 bp tags (LongSAGE;
[9]) and 26 bp tags (SuperSAGE; [10]) have been developed to enable more efficient and unambiguous tag-togene assignment in higher organisms with more complex
transcriptomes. SAGE is commonly used in animal
genomics, but has been increasingly used in plant species
and tissues [11]. The intention of the present study was to
adapt the LongSAGE technique for analysis of global gene
expression in B. napus and other similarly complex polyploid plant genomes where the complete genome
sequence and annotation are not yet available. A data
processing pipeline was adapted by matching B. napus tags

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/295

via Brassica ESTs to annotated A. thaliana gene loci, including detection of tags matching in sense and antisense orientation.

Results
B. napus seed LongSAGE libraries
Two LongSAGE libraries were produced from B. napus
seeds harvested at 23 and 35 DAP, respectively. A total of
3,136 clones from the 23 DAP library yielded 34,984 ditags (22 tags/clone), while 3,168 sequence traces from the
35 DAP library yielded 15,919 ditags (10 tags/clone)
(Table 1). The relatively low average number of tags per
clone resulted from a high number of cloned empty vector
plasmids (28.2% and 60.3% of all high-quality reads for
the 23 DAP and 35 DAP libraries, respectively). The vector
plasmid pZErO (Invitrogen) was designed to prevent
cloning of empty vector by using a LacZa-ccdB fusion
cDNA insert that should destroy bacteria containing only
the vector. However, as described by other authors (e.g.
[12]) we found that pZErO could efficiently re-ligate without containing inserts. Thus, PCR screening of plasmid
libraries for clones containing an empty vector might considerably reduce total Sanger sequencing costs and
increase total tag sample sizes in LongSAGE transcription
profiling experiments.

Table 1 summarises the numbers of accepted and rejected
tags in the two libraries. In total, 73,697 tags comprising
37,367 unique tags were extracted from both libraries.
Valid tags from 23 DAP and 35 DAP were deposited in the
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public domain under
accession number GSE14313. The total number of
accepted tags from the 23 DAP library was 48,514 comprising 24,654 unique tags. The total number of accepted
tags from the 35 DAP library was 25,183 tags comprising
12,713 unique tags. 67.0% and 64.9% of the accepted
total tags were represented by five or less copies in the 23
DAP and 35 DAP libraries, respectively.
Matching B. napus tags to the A. thaliana proteome via
Brassica ESTs
Table 2 summarises the results from the tag-to-gene
matching analysis of the two libraries. Initially, all ESTs
from a redundant database consisting of 834,732 Brassica
EST entries (from the A and C genome brassicas B. napus,
B. oleracea, B. rapa) were oriented by blastx alignment
against the A. thaliana TAIR7 proteome (cut-off value 1e6). Virtual tags were then extracted from all successfully
oriented ESTs and assigned via these ESTs to the annotated A. thaliana proteins. A total of 3,563,603 virtual 21
bp tags were extracted from all positions of the ESTs. From
the 32,395 different observed tags, 15,955 (49.3%) were
matched under the applied conditions to Brassica A or C
genome ESTs (Table 2). Matching success was reduced
about 30% for singleton tags compared to tags with
counts ≥ 2. For tags with counts ≥ 2 the matching success

Sage-phred.pl, including duplicated ditags

amounted to about 80% (Table 2). This discrepancy
might be due to the reduced numbers of ESTs in the database derived from transcripts expressed at low levels, compared to transcripts expressed at high levels within B.
napus seeds. Broadly different estimates exist on the proportion of errors within tag sequences caused by experimental artefacts, ranging from 1.67% to 15.6% of
LongSAGE tags [13,14] with at least one erroneous base-

pair introduced by sequencing. However, the singleton tag
category might contain a higher proportion of tags with
sequencing artefacts, also contributing to the different
ratio of successfully matched tags in the singleton and ≥ 2
count categories. 12,728 tags from library 23 DAP were
matched to 7,208 of 20,462 Brassica EST-matched A. thaliana proteins. 7,232 tags from library 35 DAP were
matched to 4,875 A. thaliana proteins (Table 2).

sity of tags was greater at 23 DAP than at 35 DAP. We
detected 48% (7,208 compared to 4,875) more expressed
genes at 23 DAP than at 35 DAP (Table 2), which is consistent with the number of different tags observed in each
of the two libraries.

Comparison of LongSAGE and Real-time RT-PCR analysis
A good correlation was observed between expression levels estimated by LongSAGE and Real-time RT-PCR for
most of the selected genes (Table 3), although some
minor differences in estimated fold-change were observed
(e.g. for CCR1). This could arise from the more selective
specificity of Real-time RT-PCR for transcripts derived
from closely-related gene loci, since specific RT-PCR primers were designed from contigs of B. napus ESTs putatively
derived from different B. napus gene loci. Furthermore,
Real-time RT-PCR may be more sensitive in detecting low
abundant transcripts than LongSAGE under the experimental conditions and sequencing depth applied in the
present study.

To validate the LongSAGE method and estimate the diversity of transcripts, LongSAGE tags derived from selected
tags with 2–32 counts in the 35 DAP library were used as
primers for RT-PCR in combination with anchored oligodT primers. In 17 out of 17 cases a PCR product was
amplified and sequenced that aligned in blastn analysis
with Brassica or A. thaliana ESTs or cDNAs. A further validation was performed with 9 different LongSAGE tags that
had 3 to 325 counts in the 35 DAP library and matched
members of the A. thaliana 2S storage gene family or ESTs/
cDNAs from the Brassica napin gene family. In all cases
the PCR amplification products, ranging from 75 to 457
bp in length, were related to Brassica napin genes or other
protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein
(LTP) family protein genes (56 to 100% identity). A high
diversity of 3' termini of clones were obtained using the
same napin tag primer, with up to 14% divergence, within
200–400 bp of the 3' untranslated region (UTR), from up
to 8 clones per amplicon. Interestingly, diverse 3'-UTR

Transcript diversity
Average tag frequencies for the two analysed seed libraries
differed significantly (Table 1). Whereas tags with
medium frequency (2–20) were more abundant in the 23
DAP library, the 35 DAP library was considerably more
enriched for high copy-number tags with a frequency
≥100. Nine unique tags with ≥100 counts each represented 3.2% of the total tag number at 35 DAP, whereas
the 8 tags with ≥100 counts each at 23 DAP comprised
only 2.1% of the total tags. Accordingly, the relative diver-

sequences were also obtained using different napin tag
primers, with up to 30% divergence, within 200 bp of the
3'-UTR, from 16 clones. These observations suggest that a
high number of distinct protease inhibitor/seed storage/
lipid transfer protein (LTP) family protein genes or transcript variants are expressed in B. napus seeds. Also these
data support the increasing recognition of the high complexity and variability of 3' UTR regions in genes from
higher organisms [13,15,16].
Based on the cDNA library production using polyA+
trapped mRNA, LongSAGE tags are expected to match at
the anchoring enzyme site closest to the 3' end of fulllength ESTs expressed in sense orientation (canonical
position). However, only 95.3% of the matched tags in
the sense EST dataset were matched in the last canonical
position. There are numerous possible explanations for
the high frequency of tags matching a non-canonical position. In particular, they could arise from (a) cloning artefacts caused by partial digestion with the anchoring
enzyme NlaIII during SAGE library preparation, (b) alternative transcript variants with varying length derived from
one gene locus, or (c) EST cloning artefacts creating chimeric EST molecules derived from two or more different
genes. Also, due to partial EST sequences present in the
dataset, a non-canonical position might be falsely annotated to the canonical position. Except in the third case,
non-canonical tags are still valid tags for accurate annotation. We attempted to reduce annotation artefacts (c) by
removing putative chimeric ESTs from analysis (see section 'Genes matched in sense and antisense orientation'
for details). This increased the ratio of tags matched to the
canonical position of oriented Brassica ESTs from 95.3%
to 98.3%. However, even after filtering out putative experimental artefacts using this approach, only 77% of all
243,528 ESTs matched by tags in the canonical position
are matched exclusively at this position. Instead, 23% of
these individual ESTs are additionally matched by tags at
other non-canonical positions (up to the 9th before last
position), suggesting that the usage of alternative transcripts (e.g. by alternative polyadenylation) is a common
mechanism. In other words, a high diversity exits in the 3'
UTR of many expressed transcripts, as has been described
before in humans [13]. No information exists about transcription start points for polyA+ containing transcripts
expressed in antisense orientation. Therefore different
proportions of matched antisense tags might be expected
at canonical and non-canonical positions. In contrast to
the tags matched in sense orientation, only 65.5% of tags
were matched to canonical positions for the tags matched
in antisense orientation.
Comparison of the most abundantly expressed tags and
assigned genes
Tag-to-EST matches based on 15,955 tags were assigned to
a total of 8,255 A. thaliana gene loci at both time-points

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/295

(Table 2). About 85% of the tags (13,641) were assigned
exclusively to a single A. thaliana gene locus. The other
15% of the tags matched 2 to 45 loci, with some tags
matching more than 10 genes exhibiting a polyA-like
homopolymer composition. Due to the positioning of the
anchoring enzyme restriction site close to the polyA tail in
some transcripts, these contained stretches with up to 16
adenosine bases derived from phylogenetically unrelated
genes. Other tags matching more than 2 genes were clearly
derived from groups of phylogenetically related genes. For
example, the tag CATGAACAGTTTCATCAACGA matched
to six different members of the histone gene family
(AT2G37470, AT3G53650, AT5G22880, AT5G59910,
AT1G07790 and AT5G02570).
On the other hand, some A. thaliana loci were matched by
up to 96 different B. napus tags via the Brassica ESTs. Moreover, some loci were not only matched by different tags,
but these tags also matched at different positions within
one particular matched EST molecule. These multiple
matches underline the complex paleopolyploid structure
of the B. napus genome in comparison to A. thaliana [17].
For example, the 4 A. thaliana gene loci of the 2S seed storage protein family were matched by 47 different tags,
including 9 of the 30 most abundant tags, at 35 DAP. Due
to this complexity, a three-step procedure was applied for
calculating average values of the relative abundance of
gene expression, based on the tag-to-gene matching
results for each single A. thaliana gene locus. In a first step,
the measured counts were evenly distributed to the
matched gene loci if a tag matched more than one gene
locus. In a second step, tag counts were added together if
different tags matched the same gene locus. In a final step
the summed tag counts for each gene locus were normalized to a total tag count of 1,000,000 for both libraries
and the relative abundances were calculated.
Average cumulative counts and frequencies for the 20
most abundantly expressed genes at 23 and 35 DAP are
shown in Table 4 and 5, respectively. The most abundant
transcripts at 23 DAP, with 1.59% of all matched tag
counts, correspond to the A. thaliana senescence-associated cysteine-type protease SAG12 (AT5G45890), which
was also among the 20 most highly-expressed genes at 35
DAP. Two protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer
family proteins (AT5G38195, AT1G48750) were also
among the 20 most highly expressed genes at both timepoints. Other highly expressed transcripts at 23 DAP are a
number of catalytic enzymes and other genes that are
involved in diverse biological processes. At 35 DAP, transcripts related to the four closely-related A. thaliana 2S
seed storage protein genes showed the highest counts,
with a cumulative abundance of about 10%. Other highly
expressed transcripts at 35 DAP are related to other storage
proteins (cruciferin, oleosin), protease inhibitor or lipid
transfer proteins and genes involved in fatty acid biosynPage 5 of 16

thesis. For many of the highly expressed genes several different tags were found (e.g. 44 for AT5G45890 at 23 DAP)
matching to a large number of different ESTs (e.g. 5,452
for AT5G45890 at 23 DAP) that were aligned to a particular A. thaliana gene at <1e-6.
Differentially expressed genes
620 tags showed differential expression at p ≤ 0.05
between 23 and 35 DAP. These represent only 1.7% of the
accepted unique tags, but 21.7% of all normalized tag
counts. 498 of 620 (80.3%) differentially expressed
unique tags were successfully matched to 490 A. thaliana
genes (5.9% of all 8,255 matched genes, Table 2), and
these differentially expressed genes were matched by
18.2% and 38.1% of all matched tags in 23 DAP and 35
DAP libraries, respectively (see additional file 1:
490_differentially_expressed_genes.xls). This indicates
that, in the 35 DAP library but not in the 23 DAP library,
many of the differentially expressed transcripts are highly
abundant. Of these 490 genes, 194 genes were upregulated at 23 DAP and 296 genes were upregulated at 35
DAP. The 20 most abundant differentially expressed genes
at 23 DAP include 6 genes encoding proteases, 5 genes
coding for protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer
protein (LTP) family proteins and 2 genes coding for
defensin-like family proteins. SAG12 is the most abundant differentially expressed gene at 23 DAP with 1.591%
and is down-regulated about 3-fold at 35 DAP with
0.566% total abundance. The 20 most abundant differentially expressed genes at 35 DAP cover a narrower range of
genes coding for 2S seed storage proteins, oleosins, cruciferins and protease inhibitor proteins. The 5 most abundant differentially expressed genes are the 2S seed storage
proteins 1 to 4 and cruciferin 3. The 2S seed storage protein 1 is the most abundant differentially expressed gene
with 2.657% abundance and is up-regulated 374-fold
compared to time-point 23 DAP. From all 490 genes
showing a significantly different expression level at the
two time-points, 23 were exclusively expressed at 23 DAP
and 54 at 35 DAP (see additional file 1:
490_differentially_expressed_genes.xls). A number of
cases were observed where different matched A. thaliana
genes with similar functional annotations were expressed
at the two different time-points, e.g. different A. thaliana
genes belonging to the large cysteine protease and lipid
transfer protein families were exclusively expressed at 23
DAP and 35 DAP, respectively. In contrast to cruciferin A
(CRA1) and cruciferin 3 (CRU3), cruciferin 2 (CRU2) was
exclusively expressed at 35 DAP.

Expression data produced by microarray hybridization for
79 developmental stages of A. thaliana were downloaded
from EBI ArrayExpress (accession number E-AFMX-9,
[18]) and expression profiles were compared with expression profiles obtained by LongSAGE for B. napus seeds
using hierarchical cluster analysis and Spearman's rank

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/295

correlations according to Lu et al. [19]. Both B. napus
SAGE data sets showed weak correlations with expression
value estimates from A. thaliana microarray data sets with
the highest correlation for the seed developmental stages
ATGE_77 (0.522 for 23 DAP) and ATGE_78 (0.440 for 35
DAP). Sample ATGE_77 was derived from A. thaliana seed
stage 4, early to late heart stage embryos and sample
ATGE_78 from seed stage 5, late heart to mid torpedo
embryos. Embryos dissected from sample 23 DAP were
classified to be at the mid torpedo stage and from sample
35 DAP to be at the early curled cotyledon stage. Genes
that were differentially expressed between two different A.
thaliana seed stages (ATGE_77 and ATGE_78) were identified at different stringencies and compared with the 490
genes identified to be differentially expressed between 23
DAP and 35 DAP in B. napus as described above. From the
490 genes identified by LongSAGE 76 (15%) were not
represented on the microarray chip. From the remaining
414 genes a maximum of 29% (122) overlapping genes
were detected that were mainly highly abundant genes
(e.g. 2S seed storage proteins). The percentage of overlapping genes identified here between the two different crucifer species during morphological similar seed
developmental stages appears to be high when taking into
account that the correlation of microarray hybridization
and LongSAGE data analysis has been found to be low
(below 0.5) even when using the same RNA preparations
and LongSAGE has been characterized to be more efficient
at identifying differentially expressed tags than microarray
technology [19].
Gene ontology enrichment analysis
A total of 7,208 of the 8,255 matched genes were
expressed at 23 DAP, while 4,875 genes were expressed at
35 DAP (Table 2). 3,828 of 8,255 genes (46.4%) were
expressed at both time-points. Figure 1 gives a comparison of GO categories that are statistically over-represented
for the genes expressed at 23 DAP compared to all other
A. thaliana genes. From the 490 genes matched by statistically significant differentially expressed tags between 23
and 35 DAP, 194 were up-regulated at 23 DAP and 296
were up-regulated at 35 DAP. Statistically enriched GO
terms found for the differentially expressed genes either
up-regulated at 23 or up-regulated at 35 DAP were calculated using GOEAST [20] and details of the results are provided
in
additional

.xls. Within the category 'Biological Process', the GO terms
'developmental process', 'localization' and 'metabolic
process' are enriched at both time-points. Generally, GO
terms that are statistically enriched at the highly general
information level 2 are similar for the two time-points.

targeting, photosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid
localization, storage and lipid metabolic processes at 35
DAP.
Genes matched in sense and antisense orientation
In the 23 DAP library, 6 of the 30 most abundant tags
matched in sense as well as in antisense orientation to the
Brassica EST dataset, oriented based on the A. thaliana proteome. The same was true for 10 of the 30 mosXt abundant tags at 35 DAP. In most of these cases 500 to 1,500
ESTs were matched by a single tag in one direction,
whereas only 1 to 13 ESTs were matched by the same tag
in the opposite direction. A detailed analysis of these
matches revealed that in all cases the smaller fraction of
matched ESTs were chimeric sequences composed of two
regions, derived from different gene loci, that aligned to
the A. thaliana proteome or to B. napus full-length cDNAs
in different orientations. These apparently chimeric ESTs
may represent cloning artefacts derived from tail-to-tail or

head-to-head ligations during cDNA preparation for EST
library production. In some cases a putative chimeric
composition was also found for individual ESTs, with two
different regions derived from different genes being
aligned in sense and antisense orientation to the A. thaliana proteome or to oriented B. napus full-length cDNAs.
To remove these putative chimeric ESTs from our analysis,
tag-to-EST-to-A. thaliana gene locus matches were only
accepted if at least 4 tag-matched Brassica ESTs matching a
particular A. thaliana locus were found. In addition, tagto-EST-to-gene matches of particular tags matching in
sense as well as in antisense orientation were only
included in the analysis if the frequency of ESTs matched
in one direction was at least 1% of the frequency of ESTs
matched in the other direction. After removal of putative
chimeric ESTs, the number of accepted tags that were successfully matched via Brassica ESTs to A. thaliana genes
was reduced strongly from 8,255 to 5,120 (Table 2), due
to the exclusion of many low-copy ESTs from the analysis.
The occurrence of chimeric ESTs in databases has been
documented previously. For example, Hillier et al. [21]
found chimeric ESTs in a dataset of 280,000 human ESTs
at a frequency of up to 1.04%. The strategy we applied

Page 9 of 16

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:295

resulted in removal of all 72 chimeric ESTs that were identified by manual analysis of the 47,446 ESTs matched by
the 30 most abundant tags in the two LongSAGE libraries.
Based on the tag-to-gene matching strategy described
above it was found that 24.3% of all matched tags
matched A. thaliana genes via oriented Brassica ESTs in
antisense orientation (corresponding to 1762 of 5,120,
34.4% of all matched genes, Table 2). In the 23 and 35
DAP libraries, only 68.3% and 74.6% of the respective
genes were matched exclusively by sense tags (Table 2).
On the other hand, 6.6% and 6.8% of all genes were
matched exclusively by antisense tags at 23 DAP and 35
DAP, respectively, while 25.1% (23 DAP) and 18.6% (35
DAP) of the genes were matched by both sense and antisense tags. Genes expressed with high abundance in sense
orientation, and particularly members of complex gene
families, often also showed coexpression of antisense
transcripts at a lower frequency (Figure 2, 275 differentially expressed genes matched in sense and antisense orientation). A detailed analysis of tags matching to the four
2S seed storage proteins of A. thaliana (AT4G27140,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/295

AT4G27150, AT4G27160, AT4G27170) was performed
by aligning them to Brassica spp. napin cDNAs and
genomic napin sequences. This revealed that some tags
matched in antisense orientation to highly conserved
regions of napin transcripts, derived from multiple B.
napus loci, whereas other tags matched in sense orientation to highly diverse regions of napin transcripts derived
from a limited number of B. napus loci.
Detection of napin-related sense and antisense transcript
expression by Real-time RT-PCR
At 35 DAP, a high number of tags matched in sense orientation to Brassica ESTs that were similar to A. thaliana proteins containing the AAI_SS domain (NCBI Conserved
Domain Database cd00261). This protein domain is
found in the alpha-amylase inhibitors (AAIs) and seed
storage (SS) protein subfamily including plant lipid transfer proteins, seed storage proteins and trypsin-alpha amylase inhibitors. At 35 DAP the most abundantly expressed
tags were matched via Brassica ESTs in sense orientation to
the four A. thaliana 2S seed storage proteins 1–4 (napins)

(37,182 to 41,806 tags per million). The four A. thaliana
2S seed storage proteins share 75–91% amino acid (aa)
sequence identity with each other. The four 2S seed storage protein genes and 7 other protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein (LTP) family protein genes were
also among the genes with the highest tag counts matched
in antisense orientation (see additional file 3:
All_matched_tags.xls).
For comparison of SAGE results with quantitative Realtime RT-PCR detection, two sets of primers and their antisense reverse-complemented sequences were derived
from SAGE primer amplified napin 3'-termini (see above)
and from assembled contigs of 8,977 B. napus ESTs aligning with an e-value cut-off of 1e-6 to A. thaliana 2S seed
storage protein 1 (AT4G27140). One primer set (napin)
was designed specifically for the major cluster of B. napus
assembled EST contigs most similar to the A. thaliana 2S
seed storage proteins 1–4 (59% to 70% on the aa level).
Another set of primers (napin-related) was designed specifically for the minor cluster of B. napus assembled EST
clusters grouping in-between the four A. thaliana 2S seed
storage proteins and the related protease inhibitor/seed
storage/lipid transfer (LTP) family protein AT5G54740
(about 47% to 57% identity on the aa level). AT5G54740
represents the next closely related protease inhibitor/seed
storage/lipid transfer protein (LTP) family protein gene in
A. thaliana, which like other more distantly related proteins of this large family (about 113 members in A. thaliana) exhibits an AAI_SS domain and shares about 53–
57% aa identity with the A. thaliana 2S seed storage proteins 1–4. Figure 3 shows the expression profile from days
17 to 70 after pollination from seeds for sense and antisense napin and napin-related transcript expression. The
coexpression of sense and antisense transcripts was confirmed for a minor subgroup of napin-related transcripts
by strand-specific Real-time RT-PCR, but not for the major
napin transcript group as indicated by LongSAGE.

Discussion
B. napus and A. thaliana are members of the Brassicaceae
family and exhibit around 87% conservation of their protein-coding sequences [22]. Based on this close phylogenetic relationship, the tag-to-gene matching strategy
applied in this study for LongSAGE expression profiling in
the non-model plant B. napus uses the information available for the well-annotated proteome of the model species
A. thaliana. Our results show that expression profiling can
be achieved for B. napus seeds using publically available
EST resources and the annotated proteome of A. thaliana
for tag-to-gene assignment.
Major factors influencing the accuracy of the first step of
the SAGE analysis are the sequencing error rate, the tag
length and the transcriptome complexity. The accuracy of
SAGE depends on the ability to unambiguously match the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/295

tags to the genes of origin. Theoretical calculations show
that >99.8% of 21 bp LongSAGE tags are expected to occur
only once in large genomes such as the human genome,
which is about twice the size of the B. napus genome, with
the remaining tags matching duplicated genes or repeated
sequences [9]. In a polyploid plant genome the proportion of duplicated genes is generally considerably higher,
and our strategy of matching tags via ESTs to a related
model plant proteome will not per se allow differentiation
between closely related duplicated genes. However,
matching to multiple members of gene families still
allows biological inferences from the LongSAGE data,
since the predicted function in each case is identical. In
our case only around 90% of LongSAGE tags were
assigned to a unique A. thaliana gene. This underlines the
highly duplicated nature of the B. napus and A. thaliana
genomes [17] and reflects the well-documented ancient
hexaploidization events in major angiosperm phyla [23].
Despite this we found no example where a B. napus tag
matched multiple A. thaliana genes with apparently unrelated functions. This suggests that the matching strategy
we applied is specific enough with 21 bp B. napus tags to
draw biological conclusions on the expression levels of
functionally related gene families in B. napus seeds. Raising the blastx e-value stringency to 1e-100 for matching of
Brassica ESTs to the A. thaliana proteome was found to
reduce the average number of genes per gene family to
which the observed tags were assigned. However, this also
resulted in a higher number of tags that could no longer
be assigned to A. thaliana genes and thus could not be
annotated (data not shown). For LongSAGE analysis from
B. napus we found an e-value of >1e-6 useful; this is also
the cut-off value used by NCBI in the UniGene database
for EST-to-protein matching to create clusters of transcript
sequences that are expected to come from the same transcription locus.
The development of oilseeds can be broadly divided into
three phases, (1) the pattern formation/cell proliferation
phase, (2) the maturation phase, with lipid and storage
protein accumulation, and (3) the desiccation phase. At
23 DAP B. napus seed has reached the end of phase 1 and
is beginning the transition to phase 2, while at 35 DAP the
seed is in the middle of the maturation phase. The most
abundantly expressed gene detected at 23 DAP, SAG12, is
a cysteine protease expressed during leaf senescence in A.
thaliana [24]. In B. napus SAG12 is encoded by two orthologous copies, BnSAG12-1 and BnSAG12-2, involved in
leaf senescence and seed development, respectively.
BnSAG12-2 and BnCysP1, a cysteine protease with
around 91% identity to BnSAG12-2, are expressed in the
early phase of B. napus seed development within the inner
integument of the testa and are predicted to function in
the disposal of proteins in the inner integument cells
committed to programmed cell death [25]. Other genes
encoding proteases and protease inhibitor genes are also

strongly represented within the 30 most abundantly
expressed genes at 23 DAP and 35 DAP, e.g. a δ-vascular
processing enzyme (δ-VPE) at 23 DAP. VPEs are cysteinetype proteases which were originally discovered to be
responsible for maturation of seed storage proteins. In A.
thaliana δ-VPE was found to be involved in developmental
cell death during embryogenesis [26]. In general, proteases are considered to be key regulators of plant development involved in post-translational modification or
activation of proteins and enzymes of diverse biological
processes. Proteases play a role both in general protein
turnover and in highly specific regulation of plant development. Dong et al. [27] also described an elevated
expression of genes coding for subtilisin-like protease and
vacuolar processing enzymes (VPE), consistent with seed
endosperm development, along with early expression of
lipid transfer proteins that are required for embryo pattern
formation [28,29]. The high transcription levels of genes
encoding seed storage proteins are also consistent with
the results of Dong et al. [27] based on cDNA cloning and
Northern blot expression profiling. On the other hand,
our LongSAGE analysis revealed that transcripts encoded
by the peroxidase gene AT4G21960 (Protein ID
CAA66957) had a high abundance at 23 DAP and a subsequent drop in expression at 35 DAP, whereas Northern
blot analysis appeared to reveal the opposite expression
pattern. Such differences might be due to different specificities and resolutions of the two techniques, e.g. cross-

hybridization of Northern blot probes with other closely
related peroxidase transcripts.
Antisense transcripts and sense-antisense transcript pairs
(natural antisense transcripts, NATs) were found to be
prevalent at both developmental stages investigated. Antisense transcripts were observed earlier in A. thaliana and
rice cDNA/EST databases and confirmed using tag-based
expression profiling approaches like SAGE or Massively
Parallel Signature Sequencing [30], with matching to the
sequenced genomes. In some of these studies it was noted
that the sense and antisense transcripts of an overlapping
NAT pair (cis-NATs) tend to be expressed in different tissues or different conditions. Furthermore, in cases where
the sense and antisense transcripts of a NAT pair were
expressed in the same library, one type of transcript was
usually more abundant than the other. One speculation is
that cis-antisense transcripts could be involved in downregulating the expression levels of their target mRNA to
achieve a low protein concentration by interfering with
the transcription of their sense transcript. Due to the
matching strategy we applied, the sense-antisense pair
matches we found to the A. thaliana proteome might
either indicate natural sense-antisense pair expression
from one B. napus gene, or a concurrent expression of
sense and antisense transcripts from paralogous B. napus
genes. Either way, the results clearly indicate that a significant number of antisense transcripts are expressed during

B. napus seed development. The coexpression of sense and
antisense transcripts was confirmed for a subgroup of
napin-related transcripts coding for proteins from the
large group of protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein (LTP) family by strand-specific Real-time RTPCR. Although Real-time RT-PCR confirms the detection
of antisense transcripts that are related to protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein (LTP) family proteins by LongSAGE, it also indicates that the use of the
proteome of A. thaliana for annotation of tag-matched B.
napus transcripts in case of diverse gene families limits the
resolution and the detailed analysis of the genome and
transcriptome structure and availability of more genetic
resources for B. napus will help to increase the resolution
in the future. The detection of transcripts for a diverse
number of genes in antisense orientation by LongSAGE at
both time-points suggests strong involvement of antisense
transcripts in regulatory processes during B. napus seed
development.

may soon become the method of choice for global expression profiling in non-model species.

The comparison of LongSAGE and Real-time RT-PCR data
suggests that the sequencing depth applied in this experiment limits the LongSAGE detection to transcripts with
medium to high copy numbers in B. napus seeds. On the
other hand, recent developments in next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies allow ultra-deep transcriptome profiling using transcript tag-based techniques
(e.g. DeepSAGE; [31]) that can realistically achieve transcriptome saturation and accurate quantification of lowcopy transcripts. The data analysis techniques developed
in the present study represent a valuable platform for
future NGS-based transcriptome tagging studies in
Brassica species. As suggested by Shendure [32], such
approaches may ultimately replace microarrays as the
method of choice for quantitative global transcriptome
profiling as a basis for genetical genomics or systems
genetics approaches. In the present study we have demonstrated that tag-based transcriptome profiling can also be
effectively applied in a non-model, complex polyploid
plant species.

LongSAGE library production
Total RNA extracted from two seed developmental timepoints, 23 DAP and 35 DAP, was processed using the ISAGELong Kit (Invitrogen) with several modifications to
allow more efficient library production and cloning. Briefly,
50 μg of polyA+ RNA was captured on the surface of magnetic oligo(dT) beads and double stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Double
stranded cDNA was digested for 2.5 hours with NlaIII, and
adapters containing MmeI recognition sites were ligated
overnight in ligation buffer with 15% polyethylene glycol
(PEG) to the 5' end of the cDNAs. Adaptor-linked tags were
released from the beads by restriction with MmeI overnight,
then precipitated and washed five times with 70% ethanol
before being ligated overnight in pairs to form adaptorlinked ditags. These were amplified by PCR and 200 PCR
reactions were pooled. Subsequently, 130 bp fragments were
purified from 20 lanes on 16% polyacrylamide gels. Purified
adapter-linked ditags were redigested overnight with NlaIII
to remove adapters and 34 bp ditags were purified from a
16% polyacrylamide gel. The ditags were ligated overnight
according to Kenzelmann and Mühlemann [33] to form
concatemers, then partially digested with 2 U of NlaIII for 1
min at 37°C according to Gowda et al. [34] to create linearized clonable concatemers of suitable sizes. The partiallydigested ligation mixture was separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. DNA fragments between 0.8 and 2.5 kb were isolated and 1.6 μg concatemers were ligated to 25 ng of
linearized pZErO-1 vector digested with SphI. For each of the
23 and 35 DAP libraries more than 3,000 plasmid clones
were sequenced in one direction by SeqWright (Houston,
TX, USA).

Conclusion
This study underlines the potential of transcript tagging
approaches for gene expression profiling in Brassica crop
species via EST matching to annotated A. thaliana genes.
The data processing pipeline adapted by matching B.
napus tags via Brassica ESTs to annotated A. thaliana gene
loci enabled differential expression profiling of during
seed development in the complex B. napus genome, and
furthermore detected an unexpectedly high proportion of
EST tags matching in antisense orientation. This suggests
a strong involvement of antisense transcript expression in
regulatory processes during B. napus seed development.
Limits of tag detection for low-abundance transcripts can
today be overcome by ultra-high throughput sequencing
approaches, so that tag-based gene expression profiling

Methods
Plant materials and RNA isolation
Plants of the homozygous male-sterile winter oilseed rape
maternal line 'MSL-Express' were cultivated under controlled growth chamber conditions (16 hour, 20°C day
and 8 hour, 16°C night, 60% relative humidity) and manually fertilised with pollen from plants of the isogenic
male-fertile line 'Express 617'. Pods were harvested weekly
from the main racemes of pollinated plants at time-points
14 days up to 70 days after pollination (DAP). The pods
were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C,
and seeds were collected by splitting the frozen pods.
Total RNA was extracted from seeds using RNA Reagent
(Invitrogen) and purified from DNA residues by incubation with RQ1 RNAse-free DNAse (Promega), according
to the manufacturer's recommendations.

SAGE data processing
Ditags were extracted from sequence traces using the perl
script sage-prhed.pl [35]. Due to the 1% error rate associPage 13 of 16

ated with single pass Sanger sequencing [14], Phred
sequence trace quality scores were used to remove all tags
of low sequence quality (containing bases with a Phred
score <20). 21 bp monotags were extracted from both
ends of all correctly-sized ditags. Contaminating linker
and vector sequences and low-complexity polyA tags were
identified and removed by screening a local tag database
using formatdb and blast (valid tags in Table 1; <0.06%
removed). A total of 819,455 Brassica ESTs were downloaded on Sept, 15th 2007, from NCBI dbEST http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/ using the keyword search
(Brassica napus [Organism] OR Brassica oleracea [Organism] OR Brassica rapa [Organism] AND EST [Keyword]).
About 30% of all Brassica ESTs downloaded from the
NCBI dbEST database were produced from seed developmental stages. The orientation of all Brassica ESTs was
determined by blastx analysis against the TAIR7 A. thaliana proteome accepting only matches with an e-value of
less then 1e-6. Any Brassica ESTs that did not match the A.
thaliana proteome using these criteria were removed from
the dataset. ESTs that did match the NCBI VecScreen vector database using blastn with pre-set parameters were
removed from the analysis. The remaining 834,732 ESTs
from NCBI and PBI were annotated based on the alignment with the A. thaliana proteome and orientated in
sense using ReadSeq [36]. Identitag perl scripts were modified so that virtual tags from all positions were extracted
from the Brassica ESTs, and the modified Identitag perl
scripts were used to create a MySQL database of virtual
tags [37]. To differentiate between tags that matched B.
napus seed transcripts in sense and in antisense orientation, the oriented sense EST dataset was used in combination with an oriented reverse-complemented EST dataset
(antisense EST dataset). For identification of differentially
expressed tags the online-tool DiscoverySpace (http://
www.bcgsc.ca/discoveryspace; [38]) was used and significance calculated according to Audic and Claverie [39]. The
online-tools WEGO (http://wego.genomics.org.cn; [40])
and GOEAST (http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/GOEAST;
[20]) were used for gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis with average linkage
(UPGMA) and Euclidean distance was performed for GCRMA processed, normalized data using the software program HCE 3.0 [41]. Spearman's rank correlations were
used to compare Affymetrix chip and LongSAGE [19]. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the software program SAM [42].
Cloning of 3'ends of transcripts using SAGE tag primers
For validation, the last 17 base pairs of observed LongSAGE tags (excluding the CATG restriction site) were used
as primers for RT-PCR amplification together with
anchored oligo-dT primers, as described by Xiao et al.
[43], and 2.5 μg total RNA from time-point 35 DAP.
cDNA synthesis was performed using ThermoX Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/295

turer's instructions. The PCR used 0.5 U Taq Polymerase
(Eppendorf) and 250 nM of each primer, with 2 min at
95°C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min 95°C, 1 min 50°C,
2 min 72°C and final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
Strand-specific Real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted as described above and additionally purified using RNAeasy columns (Qiagen). DNase
digestion was performed using RQ1 RNAse-free DNAse
(Promega) according to manufacter's recommendations.
cDNA was synthesized after denaturation for 10 min at
70°C using 1 μg of total RNA, 100 nM of gene and strandspecific reverse primer and Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations in a total volume of 10 μl. After the cDNA
synthesis reaction was finished the enzyme was inactivated for 15 min at 95°C. Real-time PCR was performed
using a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with a total volume of 10 μl using 1 μl of cDNA
(1:10 diluted), 5 μl of Power SYBR Green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems) and 100 nM each of the forward
and reverse primers. Amplification was for 2 min at 50°C,
10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C
and 1 min at 60°C. Controls included PCR amplification
reactions using cDNA preparations without adding the
reverse transcriptase enzyme to check for genomic DNA
contamination, and PCR amplification reactions without
adding reverse primers during cDNA synthesis to check
for a loss in strand-specificity by RNA self priming leading
to primer-independent cDNA synthesis [44]. Primers were
designed by using Brassica ESTs that were matched using
blastx at an e-value cut-off of 1e-6 with selected A. thaliana
proteins. All matched Brassica ESTs were assembled using
the software CAP3 [45] and edited manually. Alignments
of coding DNA were constructed from aligned amino acid
sequences using the software RevTrans [46]. Contigs from
these assemblies were used for primer design using the
software PrimerExpress (Applied Biosystems). Primer
pairs used for sense transcript detection were Napin_for
(5'ACGAGCTCCACCAGGAAGAG-3') and Napin_rev (5'ACGGCTTTGGATGCTCCTT-3'), which amplify position
320 to 383 relative to the coding region of gene napB
[GenBank:X14492], and Napin-related_for (5'-AACAAGCAGCCAAGTCAGTTAGG-3') and Napin-related_rev (5'GATGCGGGTGGACTGGAAT-3') which amplify position
323 to 384. For antisense transcript detection the reverse
complemented sequences of the primers were used.
Expression fold-changes were calculated relative to the
endogenous reference gene cyclophilin (GenBank accession M55018) according to the 2-ΔΔCt method using three
replicates [47].
