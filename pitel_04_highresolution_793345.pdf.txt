Abstract
Background: The resolution of radiation hybrid (RH) maps is intermediate between that of the
genetic and BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) contig maps. Moreover, once framework RH
maps of a genome have been constructed, a quick location of markers by simple PCR on the RH
panel is possible. The chicken ChickRH6 panel recently produced was used here to construct a high
resolution RH map of chicken GGA5. To confirm the validity of the map and to provide valuable
comparative mapping information, both markers from the genetic map and a high number of ESTs
(Expressed Sequence Tags) were used. Finally, this RH map was used for testing the accuracy of
the chicken genome assembly for chromosome 5.
Results: A total of 169 markers (21 microsatellites and 148 ESTs) were typed on the ChickRH6
RH panel, of which 134 were assigned to GGA5. The final map is composed of 73 framework
markers extending over a 1315.6 cR distance. The remaining 61 markers were placed alongside the
framework markers within confidence intervals.
Conclusion: The high resolution framework map obtained in this study has markers covering the
entire chicken chromosome 5 and reveals the existence of a high number of rearrangements when
compared to the human genome. Only two discrepancies were observed in relation to the
sequence assembly recently reported for this chromosome.

Background
Chicken is the first major agricultural species for which
the complete genome sequencing was undertaken. This is

partly due to its position as a model species in various
fields of biology including embryo development, oncology, immunology and evolution [1]. Moreover, as it is the

only bird species for which the genome study is so
advanced, very much is expected from its use in comparative genome analyses for annotation, including that of the
human genome, by detection of conserved sequences
[2,3]. Its intermediate phylogenetic position between
mammals and fishes will also certainly provide valuable
information on the evolution of vertebrate karyotypes.
Radiation hybrid maps have a resolution power intermediate to that of the genetic and BAC contig maps and are
also a powerful tool for the mapping of ESTs and genes by
simple PCR. They are thus useful at two levels: first, they
can be used constructively as scaffolds for a correct
genome assembly or for detecting and correcting misassembled portions of the genome; second, before obtaining whole annotated genome sequences, they are very
efficient tools for inter-species comparative genome analyses through the easy mapping of genes and ESTs [4-7].
The successful production of a RH panel in chicken is
quite recent [8], and therefore RH maps are only available
for a limited number of chromosomes [9-11]. Having
identified QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) for fatness on
chicken chromosome 5 [12], our objective was to build a
high-resolution and gene-rich RH map for this chromosome, as a basis for high precision comparative mapping
with human and for the development of new polymorphic markers.
The available human/chicken comparative mapping data
indicated conservation of synteny between GGA5 and
portions of HSA11, HSA14 and HSA15. In addition, two
genes from HSA1 had also been shown to be located on
GGA5 [13]. This information was used to develop markers from chicken EST sequence data orthologous to genes
in these human regions, in addition to the existing markers from the chicken chromosome 5 genetic map.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/66

straints on the design of primers were to avoid presence of
long introns, whose position and length was predicted on
the basis of the orthologous human gene structure, and to
design primers in the most divergent regions of the
human/chicken alignment, to limit cross-amplification
with the hamster DNA present in the hybrids. One hundred and thirty nine primer pairs out of 156 (89.1%) enabled a successful amplification and the subsequent
mapping of the corresponding genes, confirming the high
success rate obtained when using the ICCARE software for
designing chicken PCR primers based on EST data [10].
Construction of the GGA5 RH map
Altogether, genotyping data was obtained for a total of
169 markers, comprising 148 gene fragments (of which
139 developed using ICCARE) and 21 microsatellites
from the GGA5 genetic map. Two-point analysis using a
LOD threshold of 6 enabled to constitute a group of 134
markers, including all the microsatellite markers from the
genetic map. The remaining 35 markers correspond to the
external boundaries of the regions of conserved synteny
with human, from which ESTs were chosen for marker
development and map either to other chromosomes for
which RH maps were developed (GGA1, 10, 18 or 24) or
to unknown regions (data not shown). After multipoint
analysis, a 1000:1 framework map 1315.6 cR6000 long,
comprising a total of 73 markers including 12 microsatellites and 61 ESTs was obtained. The remaining 61 markers
are located relative to the framework map within confidence intervals, to build a comprehensive map (figure 1).

Results and discussion

To compare the RH and the genetic maps, the best possible position of the non-framework common markers had
to be estimated. That of the markers on the RH map was
computed by the Carthagene program and is indicated in
addition to the confidence interval. For the genetic map,
the central position of the marker's confidence interval
was used as their most probable position. As a result, the
order of the markers on the RH map matches exactly that
of the same markers on genetic map [13], with only one
notable discrepancy concerning the position of BRF1 (figure 1). However, when the position of this gene was
checked on the sequence assembly, the agreement was
with the RH map, suggesting the position of this gene on
the genetic map is erroneous.

Development of EST markers
In addition to the 21 microsatellite markers from the
genetic map, and 9 primer pairs chosen either from available primer data in the literature or designed using the
gene sequence deposited in Genbank/EMBL, 156 primer
pairs were chosen from chicken EST markers selected on
the basis of the known conservations of synteny between
human and chicken using the ICCARE (Interactive Comparative Clustering and Annotation foR Est) software
Conhttp://genopole.toulouse.inra.fr/bioinfo/Iccare/.

An average retention frequency of 21.4% was observed for
the 134 GGA5 markers studied here, although with a high
variation, with values ranging from 6.8% to 55.7%. This
finding is within the range observed in other studies
reported on this panel: 21.9% overall retention using 42
markers chosen genome-wise [8], 24 % for GGA4 [11],
20.1 for GGA7 [10] and 18% for GGA15 [9]. As already
noticed for several species including human [14,15] or
cow [16], but also for chicken chromosomes 4 and 7

While in the process of finishing our map, the first draft
sequence assembly of the chicken genome was released
(March 1st, 2004). The quality of both the GGA5 RH map
and of the sequence assembly was therefore checked by
alignment of all the markers by BLAST searches.

Comparison RH / genetic maps for chicken chromosome 5
Comparison RH / genetic maps for chicken chromosome 5. The framework RH map is 1315.6 cR6000 long. Position of
markers included only in the comprehensive map is indicated with error bars to the left of the framework map. Markers for
which the genetic position is known (Schmid et al, 2000) are indicated by links to the genetic map (middle). Retention frequency along the map is represented on the right.

[10,11], a centromeric effect is detected when observing
retention frequencies of markers along the map, with a
higher retention of markers in the region between 50 to
200 cR, in which the retention culminates at a value of
55.7%, whereas it is around 15% for the rest of the chromosome (400 cR downwards).

sequence, by using BLASTN searches and sequence alignments. The agreement between the RH framework map
and the sequence orders is almost perfect (figure 2),
although with a few discrepancies, most of them suggesting possible improvements to be made in the sequence
assembly.

Alignment of the RH map to the genomic sequence
A preliminary data set based on the first draft chicken
genome assembly has been deposited into public databases by a team led by R. Wilson and W. Warren, from the
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis
(1st
March,
2004,
http://www.ensembl.org/
Gallus_gallus/). We compared our data with the GGA5

First, a group of markers (GPR48, PAX6, SPON1 and
CSTF3), that we developed on the basis of the conservation of synteny between GGA5 and HSA11, is assigned to
GGA3 in the sequence assembly. Three of these markers
are on the framework map and for all four, the RH genotypings obtained are very similar to those obtained with
the flanking RH framework markers SLC17A6 and ARNTL

joins both positions (cR and Mb) together. Discrepancies or missing data are indicated. Unknown: sequence of unknown location in the assembly; absent: sequence not found (no BLAST hit); 5_random: sequence attributed to GGA5, but whose position
is unknown precisely in the assembly.

(two-point LOD scores ranging from 7.1 to 15.7), both
located on the GGA5 sequence assembly. Furthermore,
when two-point analysis of the four markers was computed with the flanking markers LOC134957 (1.2 Mb to
GPR48) and SLC22A3 (0.6 Mb to CSTF3) suggested in the
GGA3 sequence assembly, LOD scores were equal to zero.
This part of the genome assigned to a wrong chromosome
on the sequence assembly covers a region at least 50 cR
long, corresponding to a distance of 2 to 3 Mb, as estimated from the cR to Mb ratio. Indeed, the length of the
sequence between the two extreme markers CSTF3 and
GPR48 on the GGA3 assembly is 2.703 Mb. The retention
frequency of these four markers is amongst the highest of
all, suggesting that their location is close to the centromere and that the possible sequence assembly problems
are related to this proximity, perhaps due to repetitive
sequences.
Second, we observed an inversion of the gene order for a
segment in the upper part of the chromosome (first 86.2
cR or 3.08 Mb, figure 2) adjacent to the group we
described as wrongly assigned to GGA3 in the sequence
assembly. As the difference of likelihood between our
1000:1 framework map and the map order in this area
suggested from the assembly is higher than 1015, we considered that order of the RH map is the correct one. This
could also be due to assembly difficulties close to the centromere region.
Third, several markers absent in the sequence assembly
could be localised on the RH map (figure 2). Most of these
markers belong to regions for which sequence information is available, but that couldn't be incorporated in the
sequence assembly at all (Unknown) or that could be
assigned to GGA5, but without a clear location
(5_random). In addition, one gene (MAX) also appeared
to belong to a region with no sequence available (no blast
hit). This gene had previously been located on the cytogenetic map to the short arm of GGA5 [17], so we consider
our data as a confirmation.
Fourth, we observed a discrepancy in the local order of the
two framework map markers MCW238 and GTF2A1.
However, the difference of likelihood between our framework map and the same map with an inversion of these
two markers is only 103.7. It is therefore difficult to conclude as to which between the sequence and the RH map
presents the correct order.
From these data we conclude that radiation hybrid maps
can be useful to help detect errors in the draft sequence
assembly and for mapping genes either absent or of
unknown location in the assembly.

Comparison cR6000/cM/kb
The average cR/cM ratio is 6.5 when calculated over the
whole map length. This relatively high value, as compared
to the 4 cR/cM obtained for GGA7 [10], must be inflected
by the disparity observed along the chromosome (figure
1). This heterogeneity actually reflects disparities in the
recombination rate along the chromosome, with recombination events more frequent at the end of the long arm.

The agreement between the gene order found on RH map
and the sequence assembly is very high. Considering only
the q arm of the chromosome, the cR/Mb ratio is 22.9, or
43.7 kb per cR. This ratio, similar to that obtained for
GGA2 (S. Leroux, personal communication), is quite
lower than the 63 kb/cR and 61 kb/cR values obtained for
GGA15 [9] and GGA7 [10] respectively, suggesting a
higher resolution for the larger chromosomes. This result
can have two origins: first, the kb/cR ratio is not constant
from one chromosome to another, regardless of their
physical length [18,19,14]; second, the previous calculations were based on physical length values estimated from
cytogenetic studies: 21 Mb for GGA15 [20] and 41 Mb for
GGA7 [21]. If we consider the actual chromosome length
based on sequence assembly, these chromosomes are
shorter than previously estimated, with values of 12.4 and
37.3 Mb http://www.ensembl.org/Gallus_gallus/, the
ratio is thus now closer to the value we obtain here for
GGA5.
Comparative mapping
Figure 3 and figure 4 (see additional file 2) synthesize the
comparative maps generated by us between GGA5 and its
human and mouse counterparts. As indicated earlier
[13,22-28], conserved synteny was observed between this
chicken chromosome and portions of human chromosomes 11, 14 and 15. No correspondence was detected
with HSA1, as is also supported by the GGA5 sequence
assembly http://genome.ucsc.edu/. The results indicate a
high number of chromosomal rearrangements in the
chicken and human lineages in the region corresponding
to GGA5. The results presented in figures 3 and 4 make us
conclude that, as previously observed [10,29], the number
of synteny blocks is higher between chicken and mouse
than between chicken and human. The high number of
intra-chromosomal rearrangements within the regions of
conserved synteny between birds and mammals is in
accordance with results obtained for other chromosomes,
e.g., GGA7 [10], GGA10 [25], GGA15 [20], and chicken
regions homologous to HSA19 [30].

Conclusions
We have built a high resolution RH map of chicken chromosome 5 using the ChickRH6 panel. In doing this, we
fulfilled our objective of obtaining a detailed comparative

map of GGA5, providing jointly a source of potential polymorphic markers and of candidate genes for QTL mapping on this chromosome.
At the end of our work, the first draft chicken genome
assembly was released and we aligned it to our GGA5 RH
map. Although we detected a few errors to correct, this
allowed us to demonstrate the high quality of the
sequence assembly, which may have benefited from a low
frequency of repeated elements.
In the near future, the ChickRH6 panel will be used to
assist in improving the chicken genome assembly. This is
clearly needed in the regions for which the genetic map is
still not complete, such as some microchromosomes, but
also for parts of macrochromosomes, as shown in this
study.

Methods
Development of markers
Twenty one microsatellite markers distributed along
GGA5 were chosen from the genetic map. Their primer
sequences are available at http://www.zod.wau.nl/vf/.

Human and mouse genes from regions for which available comparative mapping data suggested a conservation
of synteny with GGA5 were selected for marker development. Except for CKB, IGF2 and RYR3 for which primers
were chosen from the literature, and 6 other genes for
which primers were designed from sequences deposited
in Genbank/EMBL, primers pairs were designed from the
available chicken EST sequence of orthologs defined using
the ICCARE (Interspecific Comparative Clustering and
Annotation foR ESTs) software (T. Faraut, http://genop
ole.toulouse.inra.fr/bioinfo/Iccare/). The exonic structure
of the genes was taken into account by extrapolating the
information available from an alignment to the human
genomic sequence. A link with the Primer3 software http:/
/www.genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/
primer3_www.cgi allowed us to design the primers.
Primer data for markers amplifying successfully and accession numbers of the sequences used as a basis for primer
design, are indicated in Table 1 (see additional file 1).
Radiation hybrids – PCR amplification
The generation of the RH panel has already been
described [8]. The final panel is composed of 90 clones
with an average retention frequency of 21.9%.

PCR amplifications were carried out for each marker in 15
µl reactions containing 25 ng DNA, 0.2 µM of each
primer, 0.3 U of Taq polymerase (Life TechnologiesGIBCO BRL), 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, 0.05%
W-1 detergent, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/66

Amplifications were carried out on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystem). The first 5
min denaturation was followed by 30 cycles, each of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at Tm for 30 s
and elongation at 72°C for 30 s. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels, electrophoresed in 1 X TBE
buffer, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Each marker was genotyped twice and a third genotyping
was performed in cases of discrepancies between the first
two experiments.
Map construction
The genotyping data obtained was analyzed with the
Carthagene software [31,32]. A group of GGA5 markers
was defined by two-point analysis using a LOD threshold
of 6. By using all the markers from this group, a 1000:1
framework map (a map whose likelihood is at least 1000
fold higher than the next possible highest likelihood
using the same markers in alternate orders) was built
under a haploid model. This framework was constructed
using a stepwise locus adding strategy, starting from the
triplet of markers whose order is the most likely
("buildfw" option). The framework map thus automatically built was further improved towards larger distance
coverage by removing markers that prevented its extension. The different provisional framework maps were
checked by using a simulated annealing greedy algorithm
testing for possible improvements of the map by inversion of large fragments, and a flips algorithm testing all
possible local permutations within a sliding window of
six markers. After validation of the framework map built
under the haploid model, the distances between markers
of the framework were re-evaluated under a diploid
model. Finally, markers not included in the framework
map were mapped relative to it, to determine their most
likely positions.

The human and mouse reference maps were built from
data available through EnsMart v19.1 (14th January 2004
– http://www.ensembl.org/EnsMart/). RH maps were
drawn with MapChart 2.0 [33].
Sequence comparison
Sequences for all the mapped fragments were used for a
BLAST search over the entire chicken genome assembly at
the Ensembl chicken site http://www.ensembl.org/
Gallus_gallus/ to determine their position in the
sequence. The sequence assembly map of our markers was
visualised with MapChart 2.0 [33].
