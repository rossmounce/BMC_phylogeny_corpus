Regulation patterns in signaling networks of cancer
Gunnar Schramm1,2, Nandakumar Kannabiran2, Rainer König1,2*

Abstract
Background: Formation of cellular malignancy results from the disruption of fine tuned signaling homeostasis for
proliferation, accompanied by mal-functional signals for differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis. We wanted to
observe central signaling characteristics on a global view of malignant cells which have evolved to selfishness and
independence in comparison to their non-malignant counterparts that fulfill well defined tasks in their sample.
Results: We investigated the regulation of signaling networks with twenty microarray datasets from eleven
different tumor types and their corresponding non-malignant tissue samples. Proteins were represented by their
coding genes and regulatory distances were defined by correlating the gene-regulation between neighboring
proteins in the network (high correlation = small distance). In cancer cells we observed shorter pathways, larger
extension of the networks, a lower signaling frequency of central proteins and links and a higher information
content of the network. Proteins of high signaling frequency were enriched with cancer mutations. These proteins
showed motifs of regulatory integration in normal cells which was disrupted in tumor cells.
Conclusion: Our global analysis revealed a distinct formation of signaling-regulation in cancer cells when
compared to cells of normal samples. From these cancer-specific regulation patterns novel signaling motifs are
proposed.

Background
Endogenous signal transduction in cancer cells is systematically disturbed to redirect the cellular decisions from
differentiation and apoptosis to proliferation and, later,
invasion [1]. Cancer cells acquire their malignancy
through accumulation of advantageous gene mutations
by which the necessary steps to malignancy are obtained
[2]. These selfish adaptations to independence can be
described as a result from an evolutionary process of
diversity and selection [3]. We were interested to observe
the resulting cellular signal transduction on a global
view. Experimental high throughput methods such as
gene expression profiling with microarrays enable investigating the pathogenic function of tumors on a mesoscopic level. Large-scale gene expression profiles were
successfully used to predict clinical outcome [4,5] and
improved risk estimation [6]. However these studies
didn’t relate genes and their expression to a functional
context. To gain an understanding on a systems view,

gene expression can be mapped onto cellular networks.
Several studies have been reported that used gene expression data from microarrays to describe specific characteristics of signaling networks in cancer. Discriminative
components of a protein-protein interaction network
were identified by comparing gene expression patterns of
metastatic and non-metastatic tumors in breast cancer
and suited as risk markers for metastasis of breast cancer
[7]. New genetic mediators for prostate cancer were
found with networks that were reversely engineered from
gene expression profiles [8]. Besides this, insights into
evolutionary principles were gained by the analysis of
gene expression profiles. Gene expression differences
were used to define phylogenetic relationships of several
Drosophila species [9] and a molecular clock for primates
[10]. Furthermore, the regulation of signaling in yeast
was investigated on a global scale to observe regulatory
adaptation to the cellular environment. Yeast responded
to exogenous signals by shorter regulatory cascades to
enable fast signal propagation [11].
The aim of our work was to detect characteristic signaling properties of cancer cells on a global scale. We
compared the regulation of signaling pathways in cancer
with normal cells and mapped gene expression data of

tumors and their corresponding non-malignant ("normal”) samples onto a comprehensive protein-proteininteraction network. For inferring regulation-principles
in cellular signal transduction, we used a graph searching algorithm that tracked pathways with the highest
correlation in regulation. We investigated twenty tumordatasets comprising acute myeloid leukemia, esophageal
squamos cell-, lung adeno- and renal clear cell carcinoma, breast-, cervical-, head-and-neck-, oral-tongue-,
pancreas- and prostate cancer, and vulva interstitial
neoplasia. The investigated tumors showed shorter pathways, but a larger extension of the network. The tumors
displayed lower frequency of central proteins and links
and a higher information entropy (Shannon’s information content) in their network. These findings were
embedded into a novel signal-regulation motif which
was observed considerably more often in normal cells
when compared to tumor cells (Figure 1). Similar to the
study of Cui and co-workers [12], central proteins
(hubs) were enriched with cancer mutations. We
observed that these proteins showed higher regulationintegrity in the normal samples whereas the tumor samples showed motifs of regulatory maintenance of the
neighbors of hubs.

Results
Constructing the signaling networks

We assembled our signaling network employing a comprehensive data repository of known protein-protein
interactions from the literature (HPRD: Human Protein
Reference Database [13,14] version 9 from April 13th,
2010). Proteins were represented by their coding genes
and will also be denoted as nodes of the networks in the
following. Gene expression data of each cancer dataset
(malignant cells) and the corresponding set of normal
samples (non-malignant cells) was mapped onto the
nodes of the network. Depending on the coverage of the
probes on the microarray chips, the intersection with
the HPRD network comprised of 5574 to 8651 nodes
including 559 to 706 receptors and 505 to 617 transcription factors (Table 1). Similar to Luscombe and coworkers, we assumed most likely signaling propagation
by high co-regulation of genes of two neighboring
proteins in the network [11]. We calculated proteinprotein-distances for each link (link-distances) by the
co-regulation (one minus the absolute value of Pearson’s
correlation) of the two interacting proteins (Additional
file 1: Supplemental Figure S1). The link-distances were
higher (lower absolute correlation) in cancer cells compared to normal cells (average of average link-distances
in normal: 0.34, and tumor: 0.52, P = 1.53E-05, Table
1). We defined pathways for each pair of receptors (signal-operator) and transcription-factors (signal-receiver)
by their shortest paths yielding a range of 282,295 to

Figure 1 Comparative cancer motif. Two different signals are
transmitted from two receptors (R1 and R2) to a transcription factor
(TF). Green and grey arrows indicate the pathways for normal and
cancer cells, respectively. The motif was defined for each pair of
pathways (from R1 to TF, and from R2 to TF) such that the
pathways of normal cells share at least one common link whereas
the pathways for cancer cells did not share any link.

435,602 pathways for each of the investigated cancer
datasets. The tumor cells showed a distinct higher coverage of the original protein-interaction network for
these pathways. Table 1 gives an overview of the network data for the different datasets we analyzed and
also the network-coverage of all receptor-transcriptionfactor pathways for the tumors and the reference samples. From these pathways we constructed specific networks for each tumor and reference sample. For each
tumor and normal sample, the constructed networks
consisted only of those links and nodes that appeared at
least once in their receptor-transcription-factor pathways. Not-appearing links and nodes were discarded
(Figure 2 shows the number of nodes in all constructed
networks of normal and cancer tissues). We were interested if these networks were specific for the respective
tumor type. For this, we extracted all somatically
mutated genes for specific cancer tissues from a database (COSMIC [15]) and tested if our tumor networks
contained genes which have been described specifically
for the respective tumors. We performed enrichment

tests (Fisher’s exact tests) and found that all tumor
networks showed a considerably significant enrichment
of their corresponding mutated tumor genes (Additional
file 1: Supplemental Table S1).
Tumors use shorter paths, more links and less hubs

We calculated a variety of different network-features to
characterize specific differences in signaling-regulation
of tumor cells and non-malignant cells. The results are
given in Table 2 and Table 3 and will be explained in
the following. For getting a reasonable estimate of the
general tendency of tumors, we calculated the average
out of all datasets for cancer and normal networks and
performed a significance test of the pair-wise differences
between tumor and normal (paired, non-parametric,
Wilcoxon-rank test).
The average path-length of cancer networks was less
than for non-malignant (average for cancer: 4.58, and
normal: 5.50, P = 3.82E-05). We wanted to know how
often the same links (interactions) were used for different signaling pathways. For this, we defined the

frequency of a link (link-frequency) as the number of
receptor-transcription-factor pathways it was involved
in. The average link-frequency was obtained by the
number of links used in each single pathway from each
respective receptor to each transcription factor, divided
by the number of all used links. The average link frequency was higher in normal cells (average of average
link-frequency for cancer: 122.6, and normal: 234.4, P =
1.53E-05). Similarly, the node frequency was calculated
and showed the same tendency (average for cancer:
524.3, and normal: 723.4, P = 2.29E-05). Hence networks of normal cells used more often the same central
proteins and interactions for different signaling tasks.
Such a hub-like structure is the central characteristic of
scale free networks [16]. We were interested if the networks for cancer and normal samples followed these
characteristics and if there were distribution differences
between them. In deed, the link-frequency distribution
of the networks of both entities followed a power law
(probability to draw a link with frequency f is proportional to f-a and a > 1). In comparison to the networks

Figure 2 Network characteristics. Number of nodes and path lengths for normal and tumor networks of all investigated cancer types. The
malignant signaling networks employed a higher number of nodes (average normal: 2973, tumor: 3324, P = 2.3E-03) and were more connected
with smaller paths (average normal: 5.4, tumor: 4.6, P = 9.54E-06).

from normal cells, the distributions of tumors showed a
steeper decline. We calculated the exponent a of the
distribution and observed larger exponents for cancer
networks (P = 1.91E-06). (exemplarily, Figure 3 shows
the distributions and the regression function for cervical
cancer 1, the distributions for all datasets are given in
Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S2). This agrees
with the lower average of their link-frequency. These
distributions also show that proteins of high connectivity (hubs) in the networks of normal cells are more
abundant (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S3
shows some illustrations of networks). The clustering
coefficient has been employed as a measure of connectedness of networks [16]. We calculated the clustering
coefficient and obtained lower values for the network of
cancer cells supporting our findings that cancer showed
a tendency for less centralized, less hub-dependent formation (average of cancer: 0.118, and normal: 0.125, P =
4.20E-04). Specifically, the number of nodes with a clustering coefficient greater zero was distinctively higher in
cancer cells (average for cancer: 2208 and normal: 1956,
P = 7.63E-05).

Frequently involved genes are enriched with cancer
mutated genes

Cui and co-workers compiled a selective list of 284 cancer mutated genes which were derived from large scale
sequencing and the literature (Supplementary Table S10
in [12]). We compared this list with the 50 most frequently involved nodes (our hubs) of each network and
found significant enrichment for 19 out of 20 normal
and tumor datasets (Additional file 1: Supplemental
Table S2). We then defined gene-lists of cancer mutated
hubs for every cancer by intersecting the hubs of our
network with the list of cancer mutated genes of Cui et
al. (Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S3). Interestingly, most of the genes which showed up in the tumor
networks were also present in the normal networks.
This may indicate that normal cells intrinsically pave
the way for their specific evolvement into malignancy.
Signaling-regulation in cancer is detached at cancer
mutated hubs but maintained in their vicinity

Uri Alon and his co-workers studied occurrences of direction-motifs in triangles and revealed a large variety of

Figure 4 Triangle motifs. The motifs were derived for each triple
of nodes consisting of a hub and two of its neighbors in the
network (n1, n2) which were also mutually connected. In the
integration motif (motif A) all nodes are pair-wise highly coregulated. Accordingly, the motif is defined by high correlations
(low distances) for links hub-n1, hub-n2 and n1-n2. In contrast, the
maintenance motif (motif B) consisted of a hub which was not coregulated with its neighbors n1 and n2. Counted were triangles
which pairs of hub-nodes (hub-n1 and hub-n2) showed high
correlation in one tissue type and no correlation in the other, while
the correlation of n1-n2 stayed in the same category. Motif C is a
consistent feed-forward loop, taken from the literature [21].

Figure 3 Link frequency distribution. The frequency distribution
of the links for the network of cervical cancer one (red circles) is
shown, in comparison to the distribution of the corresponding
normal network (blue crosses). Both networks (tumor and normal)
showed typical scale-free distributions. In comparison to the
network for normal samples, the cancer network had considerably
less hubs and showed a steeper decline of the frequency (higher
exponent a of the regression function).

substantial characteristics in signaling networks characterized by consistent and non-consistent feed-forward and
feedback loops [16]. We were interested in local regulation
patterns of the networks at cancer mutated hubs. For this,
we analyzed regulation motifs of every triangle consisting
of exactly one hub and two of its neighbors which on their
part also interact. We defined two regulation motifs. The
first motif reflected the degree of regulatory integration of
a hub and its network-vicinity and was defined by a high
correlation of all pairs of nodes in the triangle motif (integrated motif, motif A in Figure 4). We found this motif
significantly more often in normal cells (P = 1.7E-03,
Table 3). The second motif (maintenance motif, motif B in
Figure 4) described triangles which pairs of hub-nodes
(hub-n1, hub-n2) showed high correlation in one tissue
type and no correlation in the other, while the mutual correlation of nodes n1-n2 stayed in the same category (no,
low and high correlation). Such a scenario is reasonable
for a mutated cancer protein with loss-of-function leaving
their neighbors unaffected. Indeed, this motif occurred
more often in the cancer networks (P = 6.34E-04, Table 3).
Tumor networks are more robust against directed attacks

Albert and co-workers showed that scale free networks
are error tolerant only against attacks of randomly
selected nodes but not against directed removals of

central nodes (hubs) [17]. We were interested in the
robustness of the networks when removing their hubs.
For this, we removed the most frequently involved
nodes of every network and calculated the average of
pair-wise distances (average network diameter) as an
estimate of the fragility of the networks [17]. The relative increase of the network diameter due to the
removal was distinctively larger in normal cells compared to cancer cells (average for cancer: 1.59, average
for normal: 1.64, P = 0.021, Table 2) indicating higher
robustness of the tumor networks against directed
attacks at their hubs.
Lower information content in normal cells

We used the number of pathways each single link was
involved in (link-frequency) as an estimate of the probability that information (such as a phosphorylation) was
passed through this link. In this simplified model, every
pathway was treated equally. With this, we calculated
the information content for each network. As a measure
of disorder, Shannon’s information entropy [18] was calculated for each network. The cancer networks exhibited a higher information entropy (average for cancer:
11.98, average for normal: 11.38, P = 3.28-04, Table 3)
indicating their higher degree of dispersal.
A comparative network motif

Inspired by the results described above, we designed a
comparative network-motif which is illustrated in Figure 1.
We wanted to put up a model in which cancer cells
use different pathways for different tasks whereas normal
cells use common signaling interactions for different
tasks. Therefore a model was designed such that two pathways (two operator-receiver pairs, R1 - TF and R2 - TF in
Figure 1) of the normal tissue shared at least one common

Schramm et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:162
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/162

link, whereas the same operator-receiver pairs for the
tumor did not share any link. We compared the abundance
of this motif with the abundance of its counterpart in
which the cancer cells used at least one common link and
the normal cells did not share any link. We found a significantly higher number of our motif in which the normal
cells share a common link (average counts for cancer:
15,333,384, average for normal: 29,618,238, P = 9.54E-06,
Table 3).

Discussion
We investigated network properties of cancer signaling
by looking at co-regulation patterns of genes for different cancer types. We analyzed the general regulatory
behavior of correlating gene expression samples of one
tumor type and study, rather than analyzing the regulatory behavior of single patients. For this, we calculated a
gene to gene distance metric for all samples (patients)
of normal and cancerous tissues. The networks of the
investigated tumors showed distinctive mechanisms in
the regulation of signal transduction when compared to
normal cells and had shorter path lengths. Luscombe
and co-workers analyzed the dynamics of regulatory networks in yeast [11]. In comparison to endogenously
caused changes, they discovered a different topological
adaptation of the network when yeast responded to
environmental changes. For having quick responses,
yeast reacted to environmental changes (nutrition depletion, stress response) by short regulatory cascades. Our
investigated cancer cells showed a similar tendency as
yeast under stress at which fine tuned endogenous
homeostasis is of minor importance. Interestingly, for
yeast, Luscombe et al. discovered a higher frequency of
hubs for stress responses whereas we discovered that
the tumors used hubs less frequently. Cells of normal
sample had a more centralized network to regulate signals via common nodes and links. This was reflected by
a smaller network, higher frequency of hubs, lower
entropy and a higher number of our signaling motif in
which the number of pathway-pairs with common links
was counted. This makes sense, as fine-tuning and integrating diverse signals need to be coordinately transferred to the respective transcriptional response which is
substantial for fine grained signaling homeostasis of normal cells to co-ordinate their signals in accordance to
their cellular community in the tissue. Degenerated
tumor cells do not need this any more. In turn, the
tumors showed a higher connectedness of the whole
network which may strengthen their independency of
exogenic perturbations.
Similar to Cui and co-workers [12], we observed with
our model that cancer specific mutations occur distinctively more often at hubs for signal transduction. Such a
mutation can cause a loss of function. This is beneficial

Page 7 of 12

for the cancer if the protein gets insensitive to
upstream-signals and fires constitutively an oncogenic
signal as e.g. the ABL-BCR fusion protein in chronic
myelogenous leukemia [19]. If the protein acts as a
tumor suppressor, a complete loss of function is beneficial for oncogenesis. In both scenarios, the regulation
for signaling homeostasis of the local network environment is detached from this mal-functional protein and a
coordinated regulation between the environment and
this protein is not necessary any more. We observed
this by counting distinctively less integration-motifs in
tumors (motif A in Figure 4). Interestingly, tumors seem
to sustain the original signals between the environment.
We observed this by higher counts of the disruption
motif in tumors which reflects the disruption of co-regulation of the hub, but maintained regulation between
the neighbors of the hubs (motif B in Figure 4). Even
though tumors may exhibit de-regulation of malfunctional hubs with their neighbors, such a maintained
co-regulation of their neighbors gives evidence that
bypass regulations are still necessary. Ma’ayan and
co-workers observed an accumulation of feedback and
feed-forward loops at such hubs [20] which supports
this idea. Tumors need to maintain the direct signal of
e.g. a feed-forward loop which is necessary for the effect
of the constitutive signal of an oncogenic hub (Figure
4C). Such oncogenic signaling motifs may have implications to drug therapy. If an oncogenic hub is treated (as
e.g. ABL-BCR with imatinib [19]) resistance can occur
by mutations of the target protein which reduce the affinity of the drug to the target. A combined therapy may
avoid this evolvement by additionally blocking the signaling-maintenance of the neighbors. In addition, we
found that the observed cancer networks showed higher
error tolerance against directed attacks of hub removals.
Hence, some maintenance signals may not only support
cancer mutated hubs but also pave the way for the signaling network to get independent of them, specifically
for proteins of cancer mutated genes with loss-of-function. It is challenging but highly relevant to shed light
into these effects experimentally with cell lines exhibiting drug resistances at such hubs. We analyzed networks based on cohorts of patients and used the
correlation of expression between gene pairs for the
whole cohorts. This approach does not allow the analysis of a single sample and therefore can’t be employed
for diagnosis of a single patient, but rather for the analysis of tumor subgroups. It may be worthwhile developing distance metrics of gene pairs for single samples
with which the investigated topology features can be
employed supporting diagnosis.
We proposed a novel comparative signaling-motif for
malignant signaling-regulation which sums up our findings (Figure 1). There have been elaborated studies on

Schramm et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:162
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/162

network motifs [21]. Our comparative cancer motif is
different from these motifs in that it shows signalingregulation in cancer reflecting less centralized formation.
The comparative cancer motif agrees with our findings
of non-integration (motif A, Figure 4) but signalingmaintenance (motif B, Figure 4) of proteins with higher
involvement in signal propagation.

Conclusion
We analyzed network models that based on correlation
of gene expression between interacting proteins which
enabled us to track basic principles of signaling by its
regulation. The malignant signaling networks showed
more diverse signaling pathways (average number of
nodes in the networks of tumor: 3324, and normal tissue: 2973, P = 2.3E-03, Figure 2), shorter pathways
(average path-length for cancer: 4.58, and normal: 5.50,
P = 3.82E-05, Figure 2), the networks were less centralized (average clustering-coefficient of cancer: 0.118, and
normal tissue: 0.125, P = 4.20E-04) and less dependent
on hubs (average increase of network-diameter after
hub-removal, for cancer: 1.59, and normal tissue: 1.64, P
= 0.021). The cancer networks indicated signaling maintenance and increased error tolerance to punctual
attacks even at hubs which makes cancer treatment at
specific targets challenging.
Methods
The general workflow of our approach is outlined in
Figure 5. To investigate if our network features showed
a statistically significant difference we performed paired
Wilcoxon tests. We set the significance level to P ≤ 0.05
and considered all p-values below this threshold as statistically significant.
Gene expression analysis

We analyzed twenty different datasets of cancer and
their corresponding normal or reference samples. For
most of the tumors (8 tumors), we analyzed two datasets for each cancer type. We used two AML (acute
myeloid leukemia) datasets containing 18 normal and 25
tumor (AML-1) [22] and 4 normal and 52 cancer samples (AML-2) [23]. The first breast cancer dataset
(breast-1) was obtained from cancer and normal sample
of 43 patients each [24], breast-2 consisted of 143 normal and 42 cancer samples [25]. We analyzed two cervical cancer sets, cervical-1 [26] and cervical-2 [27]
comprising data from 8 and 24 normal and 20 and 31
cancer datasets, respectively. Data of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) was obtained from cancerous and normal tissue of 53 patients (taken from the
NCBI database Gene Expression Omnibus, accession
code GSE23400). We used a glioma data set containing
23 normal and 153 cancer samples [28]. A head-and-

for all pair-wise combinations of receptors and transcription factors.

neck dataset was taken from a study of head-and-neck
squamous carcinoma consisting of data from 22 normal
and cancer samples [29]. We used two lung cancer datasets, denoted as “lung-1” and “lung-2”. Lung-1 was taken
from a study by Bhattacharjee and co-workers [30] and
contained data from 17 normal and 13 cancer samples
of adenocarcinoma. Bhattacharjee and co-workers clustered the tumor datasets in their study. To obtain the
most relevant data subsets with the necessary homogeneity, we selected their cluster of highly aggressive adenocarcinomas (cluster C2 of their cluster analysis) for
our study. Lung-2 contained gene expression data of
normal sample and adenocarcinoma tumors from 27
patients [31]. We analyzed an oral-tongue-cancer datasets comprising of data from 26 normal and 31 cancer
samples (oral-tongue-1 [32]) and 12 and 26 normal and
cancer samples, respectively (oral-tongue-2 [33]).

We analyzed two datasets for pancreas cancer, pancreas1 consisting of 39 normal and tumor tissues [34] and
pancreas-2 having 15 normal and 36 cancer samples
[35]. The first prostate cancer dataset (prostate-1) comprised of data from 50 normal sample and 52 cancer
samples [36], and the second (prostate-2) consisted of
50 normal and 52 cancer samples (taken from the NCBI
database Gene Expression Omnibus, accession code
GSE17951). The dataset Renal-1 contained 23 normal
renal samples and 69 samples of renal cancer 69 [37]
and renal-2 had 5 normal and 62 cancer samples [38].
For the first renal datasets we selected homogenous
samples by performing hierarchical clustering (Euclidean
distance, complete linkage) yielding sets of nine clustered samples for normal tissue and 10 for cancerous
tissue. We analyzed data from vulva interstitial neoplasia
consisting of 10 normal and 9 cancer samples [39]. All
datasets were stratified by randomly deleting datasets of
the overrepresented class yielding an equal amount of
tumor and normal sample datasets. For breast-1, ESCC,
head-and-neck, lung-2, pancreas-1, and oral-tongue-1,
normal and cancer samples were from the same patients
(which was not the case for the other analyzed datasets).
The data had been obtained using microarrays from
Affymetrix of the following versions: HG-U133A for
AML-1, breast-1, cervical-2, ESCC, lung-2 and renal-1,
HG-U133 Plus 2 for breast-2, cervical-1, glioma, oraltongue-2, pancreas-1, pancreas-2, prostate-2, renal-2
and vulva; HG-U95Av2 for AML-2, head-and-neck,
lung-1, oral-tongue-1 and prostate-1. We normalized all
datasets by Variance Stabilization Normalization [40,41].
Network construction

The protein-protein-interaction network was constructed using the Human Protein Reference Database
[13,14] (version 9 from April 13 th , 2010). Interacting
proteins were represented by their coding genes. The
network was constructed for every gene that could be
mapped to a microarray probe-set using BioMart [42].
Interactions were not taken into account if probe information for at least one gene was missing. For a link
between node (gene) x and y, we defined a link-distance
dxy by Pearson’s correlation coefficient rxy from gene
expression values of the interacting proteins x and y

 xy =

∑

n
i =1

( xi − x ) ( yi − y )

(2)

for n samples (patients) and gene expression xi and yi
for gene x and y of sample i, respectively. These distances were calculated for each dataset of normal and
cancer tissues and used for the networks of the respective datasets. To equally handle induction and inhibition
events, we used the absolute values of all correlation
coefficients. Correlation values were subtracted from
one to obtain low distances for paths with high correlation. Genes with the molecular function term “receptor
activity” from the definitions of Gene Ontology [43]
were used as receptors in the network. The definitions
of transcription factors were taken from TRANSFAC
[44]. We used Dijkstra’s algorithm [45] for calculating
the shortest paths for every pair of receptors and transcription factors in the normal and tumor networks.
These shortest paths of all receptor-transcription factor
pairs served as the predicted pathways for each dataset
and defined our tumor-specific interaction networks.
Links and nodes that were not used by any shortest
path were removed. The analyses were then performed
on the largest connected component of the interaction
network.
Defining the network features

Path length, link and node frequency, and the signaling
motif are explained in the results. It is to note that link
(and node) frequency is similar to betweenness centrality, which is the number of shortest paths going through
the link (and node). While betweenness centrality considers shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, node
and link frequency as defined here, was the number of
shortest paths between pairs of receptors and transcription factors. The (average) network diameter has been
described as a measure for error tolerance of a network
against removals of nodes in scale free networks [17]
and was used here in a similar way. The diameters for
the networks were obtained by the average of the shortest paths of each pair of nodes in the network. The network diameter was calculated for undisturbed (whole)
networks and networks in which the top 10% of the
hubs were removed. The ratio of these values was calculated to yield the increase of the average network diameter after hub removal. The calculation of the
information content was based on the assumption that
signals enter the network at any receptor with equal
probability within a certain time interval. These signals
are passed by the links of the network to the transcription factors via the defined pathways from the receptors,
again with equal probability. We assumed that the signals vanish from the signaling network after having
entered the corresponding transcription factor at the
end of the path. Signals enter the receptors with a

Page 10 of 12

certain frequency, resulting in an equal distribution and
therefore we assumed uniform density of the signals in
each pathway. The probability of a signal to pass
through the link of node i and j is then proportional to
the number of pathways passing through this link. With
this, we calculated the information content by Shannon’s
definition [18]

(3)

i =1

in which n denotes the number of links and p i the
probability of a signal to be passed through link i. The
clustering coefficient Ci for node i was given by
Ci =

n links
k ( k −1)

(4)

in which nlinks is the number of links connecting the
neighbors of node i and k is the number of neighbors.
This feature described how well the neighbors were
mutually connected. If they were fully connected, the
clustering coefficient was one, if they were not connected at all, the clustering coefficient was zero.
Link-frequency distributions

The link-frequency distributions of normal and tumor
cells i followed a power law, i.e. the probability of links
P(f) with link-frequency f was approximately given by
P ( f ) ~ f −∝

(5)

To estimate the exponent a we applied the method
proposed by Newman [46] which determines the exponent of the cumulative distribution avoiding noisy data
at the tail of the original distribution (see tail of the link
frequency distribution in Figure 3). For visualization we
plotted the distribution and the corresponding linear
function with slope a on a log-log scale. The intersection with the y-axis of the plotted line was calculated
using a least squared fit (see Figure 3 and Additional file
1: Supplemental Figure S2).
Defining and counting the integration and the
maintenance motif

We defined three correlation categories based on intervals of the absolute values of the correlation coefficient |
rxy|: no correlation for the absolute value of correlation
coefficients between zero and 0.3, low correlation for
the absolute value of correlation coefficients between 0.3
and 0.5, and high correlation above 0.5. Hubs of cancer
mutated genes were defined by intersecting the list of
cancer genes from Cui and co-workers (Supplementary

Table S10 in [12]) with the nodes that appeared in both
tissue types (normal and tumor). From this intersection
we selected the top 50 most frequently involved nodes
from the normal and the tumor network resulting in
100 cancer mutated hubs for every cancer dataset. Hubs
that were selected in both tissue types and as such
appeared twice in the union set were used only once.
For each dataset, we collected all triangles in which one
node was such a cancer mutated hub and that appeared
in the normal and in the tumor network ensuring the
comparability of our motif counts. Out of these triangles, we selected triangles having the motifs for integration (motif A in Figure 4) and maintenance (motif B in
Figure 4). For motif A, we selected triangles in which
the absolute correlations |rxy| between all pairs of nodes
(hub-n 1 , hub-n 2 , n 1 -n 2 , n 1 and n 2 are the two other
nodes in the triangle) was high. For motif B, we counted
the abundance of triangles which pairs of hub-nodes
showed high correlation in one tissue type and no correlation in the other, while the correlation of n1-n2 stayed
in the same category (no correlation, low correlation or
high correlation).
