Newly recognized mosquito-associated viruses in
mainland China, in the last two decades
Hong Liu†, Xiaoyan Gao†, Guodong Liang*

Abstract
There are four principal arboviruses in mainland China. Two kinds of them are mosquito-borne viruses, namely
Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus, which lead to Japanese encephalitis, and dengue fever/dengue
hemorrhagic fever respectively; the other two are tick-borne viruses, namely tick-borne encephalitis virus and
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (also known as Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus), which contribute to tickborne encephalitis and Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever respectively. With exception of these four main arboviruses,
many other mosquito-associated viruses have been isolated and identified in recent years. These newly isolated
and identified mosquito-associated viruses are probably responsible for human and animal infections and diseases.
The purpose of this review is to describe the newly isolated mosquito-associated viruses in mainland China which
belong to five viral families, including their virological properties, phylogenetic relationships, serological evidence,
as well as to appeal the public health concentration worldwide.
Introduction
Arboviruses comprise a group of viruses that reproduce
in sensitive blood-sucking arthropods [1]. There are
more than 550 species listed in the international catalog,
of which more than 128 are known to infect humans
and livestock and most are mosquito borne [2]. At present, dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus
(JEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and other mosquitoborne viruses are major causes of infectious diseases
worldwide [3-6]. Therefore, arboviruses and their related
diseases not only are research subjects for virologists
but also raise social issues associated directly with public
health and attract great public concern [5,6].
Since the 1950 s, four kinds of arbovirus-related diseases have been confirmed to be endemic in China,
namely Japanese encephalitis (JE), dengue fever (DEN),
tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (also known as Xinjiang
hemorrhagic fever, XHF) [7-10]. The former two kinds
of arboviral diseases were caused by mosquito-borne
arboviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV), respectively. The latter two kinds of

and Prevention, Beijing, China

are arboviral diseases were caused by tick-borne arboviruses: tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) (also
known as Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus, XHFV). JE
and DEN are nationally notifiable communicable diseases in China while TBE and XHF are locally reported
communicable diseases [7-11]. These four arbovirus
infections contribute to a large disease burden in China
and have been reported previously and well evaluated
[7,12-14]. However, lots of arboviruses have been newly
found and identified in mainland China, and the diseases or infections due to these newly isolated arboviruses maybe underestimated.
This article focuses on the mosquito-associated viruses
isolated from variety of arthropods, humans and animals
that have been identified in mainland China in recent
years, which belong to 5 viral families, and a lot of them
are important zoonotic pathogens (Figure 1).
Bunyaviridae
Tahyna virus (TAHV)

A strain of virus (XJ0625) was isolated from Culex spp.
mosquitoes collected from corrals in Xinjiang, China, in
the summer of 2006 by Lu et al. [14]. Microplate plaque-reduction neutralization tests were performed using
BHK-21 cells and ascites fluid with immunity to prototype TAHV (Bardos 92; provided by the Centers for

These were completely inhibited at ascites fluid dilutions of
up to 1:3200. Phylogenetic analysis of XJ0625 from China
based on small (S) and medium (M) segments shows that
XJ0625 and the prototype of THAV (Bardos 92) are
included in the same phylogenetic group (Figure 2). The
isolate (XJ0625) was subsequently identified for the first
time in China as TAHV belonging to the Bunyaviridae
family by serological and molecular biology assays (Table
1). Serum samples from patients with fever of unknown
cause were collected in the local hospitals. Of the 323 samples, 5.3% (17/323) were IgM positive (detected by indirect
fluorescence assay, IFA), and 18% (59/323) were IgG positive. Ten paired serum specimens were assayed by serum
dilution neutralization testing with XJ0625 virus on BHK-

21 cells. All 10 samples showed neutralizing activity against
XJ0625 virus, indicating human infection by TAHV in this
region. This was the first report of THAV infection in
mainland China [14].
Two strains of viruses (QH07029 and QH07060) were
isolated from Ochlerotatus detritu collected in Geermu city
located in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau at an altitude of 2800
meters in August 2007, by Li et al [15]. The isolates were
subsequently identified as TAHV by serological and molecular biology assays (Table 1, Figure 2). A serosurvey
demonstrated IgG antibodies against TAHV in 4.4% (16/
366) of the residents of Geermu city. In addition, the incidences of TAHV IgG antibody-positive cows and sheep
were 16.7% (5/30) and 26.7% (8/30), respectively. This
represents the first evidence of TAHV infection in residents
and livestock in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Moreover, this

was also the first time that TAHV had been isolated from
Ochlerotatus detritu, adding the 13th TAHV-positive mosquito species to the known list [15]. These lines of evidence
suggest that TAHV transmission cycles involving mosquitoes and susceptible vertebrate hosts had been maintained
in the locality.
TAHV, a member of the California serogroup, genus
Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae, was first isolated
in the former Czechoslovakia in 1958 [2] and is widely
distributed in western Asia and central Europe [14-18].
TAHV has been isolated from various natural hosts and
vectors such as Culex pipiens, Aedes sp. mosquitoes and

febrile patients [19]. Anti-TAHV antibodies have been
observed in serum samples of healthy populations of cattle, sheep, bears, hares, rodents and a variety of birds
[17,18]. Human illness arising from infection with TAHV
has been reported as manifesting undifferentiated fever
and influenza-like symptoms and occasionally pneumonia-like central nervous system involvement [19].
Batai virus (BATV)

A strain of virus (YN92-4) was isolated from Anopheles
Philippines captured in Yunnan province in 1998 by Zhang
et al [20]. The isolate showed a high response against
ascites fluid carrying immune activity against Bunyavirus

and BATV (Table 1). Sequencing and analysis of a small
segment of YN92-4 indicated that it was a BATV [21].
The full coding region of YN92-4 has been sequenced
and analyzed by Wang et al. [22]. This is the first BATV
strain in the world to have had its full coding region
sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis of BATV based on
S, M and large (L) segments showed that BATV (YN924) together with the prototype of BATV (MM2222) and a
Japanese isolate (ON-7/B/01) are clustered in one phylogenetic group, further indicating that YN92-4 is a BATV
(Figure 2). The reconstructed phylogenetic tree shows
that Chinese YN92-4 and Ngari virus (a genetic reassortant virus) belong to two different phylogenetic groups,
indicating that no reassortment has occurred in YN92-4
(Figure 2). A serosurvey demonstrated that the BATV
specific antibody positive rate was 4.7% (5/120) in febrile

patients in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan province where the
virus was initially isolated, giving evidence of BATV infection in this locality [23].
BATV was first isolated from Culex pipiens in Malaysia in 1955 [2]. Additional BATV isolates have been isolated from mosquitoes, cattle, pigs and febrile patients
since then [24-26]. Human infections with BATV show
symptoms including headache, fever and occasionally
central nervous system involvement [27]. A large
hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreak occurred in 1997-1998
in eastern Africa, causing 89,000 human infections and
250 deaths [28,29]. Analysis showed that the Ngari virus
responsible for the HF outbreak is a genetic reassortant
virus with S and L segments derived from the Bunyamwera virus and an M segment derived from BATV. This
finding attracted great public concern worldwide [30].

Flaviviridae
Chaoyang virus (CV)

This virus was first isolated from Aedes vexans in rural
corrals in Chaoyang city in Liaoning province in China
[31]. CV induces CPE in C6/36 cells leading to cell deformation, disordered arrangement, aggregation and death.
The full coding region of CV has been sequenced and
analyzed (Table 1). The genome of CV is a positive-sense
single-stranded RNA molecule spanning 10308 base pairs
with a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding three
structural and seven nonstructural proteins. The nucleotide homology of the E gene between CV and the St.
Louis encephalitis virus belonging to the JE virus group
was the highest at 59.6%; that of the NS3 gene to the
Kedougou virus belonging to the DENV group was the
highest at 61.7% and that of the NS5 gene between CV
and the Sepik virus belonging to the yellow fever (YF)
group was the highest at 67.0%. The phylogenetic analysis
of CV together with other flaviviruses showed that CV
clusters in the mosquito-borne group but is located in
different phylogenetic branches from other mosquitoborne and tick-borne forms. These findings indicate that
CV is a new species of the genus Flavivirus within the
Flaviviridae family [31] (Figure 3). Notably, the phylogenetic relationships of CV with other medically important
flaviviruses are close, and Aedes vexans, the vector of CV,
is widely distributed around the world [2]. Hence, further
research on CV is highly recommended to determine its
potential virulence, its ability to invade new regions and
its potential public and veterinary health problems.
Togaviridae
Getah virus (GETV)

A strain of virus (M1) was isolated from Culex mosquitoes in Hainan province in 1964 by Yang et al [32]
(Table 1) and was subsequently identified as an isolate
of GETV by serological and genomic analyses [33].
Additional GETV isolates have been isolated from mosquitoes collected from Shanghai city and Hebei, Gansu
and Yunnan provinces [34,35] (Table 1). Ten strains of
GETV have been isolated from different mosquito species including Aedes vexans, Armigeres obturbans, Culex
spp. and unidentified mosquitoes from China, representing a wide geographic distribution and a long time interval. These have been sequenced and analyzed [35]. Fulllength genome sequences were determined for three isolates: M1, HB0234 and YN0540. The remaining seven
isolates have had the E2 gene and the 3’ untranslated
region (UTR) sequenced. The nucleotide (nt) homology
of the E2 gene between these 10 strains of virus is 97.799.9%. The nucleotide sequence identity of the fulllength genome sequences between the three Chinese
isolates ranges from 98.1% to 99.1%, while the amino
acid (aa) sequence identity ranges from 98.7% to 99.8%.

Page 6 of 13

The Chinese, Russian and Mongolian isolates show the
same deletion (10 nt) at positions 45-54 in the 3’ UTR,
making it a molecular marker for the GETV isolates in
these regions [35] (Figure 4).
GETV was first isolated from Culex gelidusin in
Malaysia in 1955 [2]. The virus is known as a pathogen
of horses and pigs [36,37]. Neutralizing antibodies to
GETV have been identified in serum samples from
humans and birds in Malaysia, northern Australia and
Hainan province in China [32,38,39]. Despite these findings, the virus has not been linked to illness in humans.
Sindbis virus (SINV)

Three new strains of this virus were isolated in China in
1987 (YN87448) [40], 1990 (XJ-160) [41] and 2005
(MX10) [Wang JL, Zhang HL, Sun XH, Fu SH, Wang
HY, Wang HQ, Liang GD: Distribution of mosquitoes
and mosquito-borne arboviruses in Yunnan Province
near the China-Myanmar-Laos border, Submitted],
respectively. SINV could be divided into three genotypes: Paleoarctic/Ethiopian (P/E), Oriental/Australian
(O/A) and Western/Australian (W/A) [42]. Phylogenetic
analysis suggested that YN87448 and XJ-160 belong to
the P/E genotype; however, XJ-160 virus was clustered
in a separate clade and must have evolved independently
[41]. The nucleotide homology between MX10 and
Malaysia isolate MRE-16 was 90.0%, and MX10 belongs
to the O/A genotype (Figure 4).
Since the isolation of XJ-160 in 1990, studies on XJ160 have been conducted including whole genome
sequence [41], full-length infectious cDNA cloning [43].
Based on the full-length cDNA clone of XJ-160, the
effects of aa substitutions in the nonstructural proteins
nsP1 and nsP2 on the infectivity and pathogenesis of
the virus have been investigated [44,45]. Packaging cell
lines (PCLs) of the XJ-160 virus have been constructed
to develop an XJ-160 virus-based vector system [46]. In
addition, the essential role of the E2 glycoprotein has
been confirmed in XJ-160 viral infections, especially the
145-150 aa domain acting through interaction with cellular heparan sulfate [47].
A serosurvey has demonstrated SINV-specific antibodies in humans and animals in several areas in China
[48]. Antibodies to SINV have been identified in healthy
individuals as well as febrile patients, and in dogs and
voles in Yunnan, Hainan and Guangdong provinces
[49,50]. In Fujian province, the seropositive rate in the
healthy individuals was 12.9% (27/210), and SINV IgG
antibodies could be detected in foxes, rabbits and dogs
[51]. In addition, IgG antibodies to SINV were detected
from patients with unknown fever and encephalitis and
leptospiral meningitis [52], indicating that SINV might
be a pathogen causing fever and viral encephalitis in
China, so enhanced surveillance of SINV and its infection are in dire need.

Figure 3 Phylogenetic analysis based on the full coding sequences of Chaoyang Virus (CV) together with arthropod-borne flaviviruses
and flaviviruses with not known vectors. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by the neighbor-joining method with MEGA software http://
www.megasoftware.net/. Bootstrap probabilities of each node were calculated with 1,000 replicates. Scale bars indicate a genetic distance of
0.05-nt substitutions per site. Note that the Chinese CV strains designated by boldface type in red are clustered in the mosquito-borne group
and have been separated into an independent evolutionary clade.

SINV was first isolated from a pool of Culex sp. mosquitoes in 1952 in the Nile river delta in Egypt [2]. The
virus was widely distributed in the world [53]. The primary hosts and vectors are birds and mosquitoes, and
large animals and humans act as definitive hosts [54].
SINV infection is called “Sindbis disease” and is clinically manifested by rash and arthritis; therefore, SINV
infections are of great public health importance [55].
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)

In 2008, five cases of CHIKV imported from Malaysia
were detected in Guangzhou city. All were confirmed by

laboratory testing, and four strains of CHIKV were recovered from the samples [56] (Figure 4). This evidence indicated that the introduction and spread of CHIKV
outbreaks in China is a potential threat. Recently, a
CHIKV outbreak occurred in Dongguan city, Guangdong
province in October, 2010. The lab testing showed that
10 out of 15 sera samples were confirmed to be CHIKV
nucleotide positive. Also about 91 suspected CHIKV
infection cases were tracked through epidemiological
investigation till 1th, October, 2010[57]. So long-term
surveillance and clinical attention are still important.

Figure 4 Phylogenetic analysis based on the full coding sequences of Alphavirus isolated in China together with those referred in this
review. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by the neighbor-joining method with MEGA software http://www.megasoftware.net/. Bootstrap
probabilities of each node were calculated with 1,000 replicates. Scale bars indicate a genetic distance of 0.05-nt substitutions per site. The
Chinese isolates are all shown in boldface in red.

CHIKV was first isolated from the blood of a febrile
patient in Tanzania in 1953 [2]. CHIKV infection can
cause an acute debilitating illness, most often characterized by fever, severe joint pain and rash [58]. CHIKV has
become the most prevalent Alphavirus infection in the
world, particularly prevalent in Africa and Southeast Asia
[59,60]. In 2005, there was an epidemic in India and in
countries around the southwest Indian Ocean [61].
Ross River virus (RRV)

A strain of this virus (HBb17) was isolated from brain
tissue of bat in Hainan province in China by Zhao et al.
[62] (Table 1). Immunofluorescence assays and crossneutralization testing demonstrated that the strain has a
close relationship with RRV. Molecular analysis of RRV
showed that the nucleotide homology of the 3’ UTR and
E1 gene between HBb17 and the RRV prototype (T48)
was 99.0%. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the
HBb17 strain was in the same phylogenetic branch as
RRV [63] (Figure 4). In experimental conditions, the isolate HBb17 could be replicated in mosquitoes and
caused mice to be infected and to die following bites
from infected mosquitoes [62].

RRV-specific IgG antibodies were detected in serum
samples of healthy individuals and rats in Hainan province by IFA. The positive rates were 1% (1/98) and 8%
(6/75) respectively, suggesting that RRV infections exist
in Hainan province [62].
RRV was first isolated from Aedes vigilax captured in
the Australian Ross River region in 1959 [2]. This virus
is mainly distributed in south Pacific regions such as
Australia and Fiji. RRV infection mainly manifests as
fever, rash and polyarthritis [64,65].
Reoviridae
Banna virus (BAV)

BAV was first isolated from patients with unknown fever
and encephalitis in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan province
located in southern China, 1987 [66] (Table 1). BAV is the
prototype species of genus Seadornavirus within the family
Reoviridae [67]. The BAV genome consists of 12 segments
of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), termed segments 1 to
segment 12 in order of decreasing molecular mass determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and
agarose gel electrophoresis. The PAGE profile of BAV is a

Liu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:68
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/68

6-6 pattern [66]. BAV isolates have been obtained from
mosquitoes including three genera and 10 species in
various provinces of China (Gansu, Shanxi, Liaoning,
Yunnan and Beijing) [68] (Table 1) and from mosquitoes in Indonesia and Vietnam [69,70]. Phylogenetic
analysis of BAVs isolated from southeast Asia (including Yunnan province in China, Vietnam and Indonesia)
based on segment 12 indicated that the BAV isolates
could be divided into two phylogenetically different
groups according to their geographic origin: south and
north [68].
A large-scale serosurvey has been conducted in several
provinces in China. Serum specimens of 1141 patients
who supposedly had JE or viral encephalitis were tested
for anti-BAV IgM antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the positive rate was 11.4%
(130/1141) [71]. Among the 63 serum specimens of
patients diagnosed clinically with viral encephalitis, 11
were anti-BAV IgM antibody positive, 37 specimens
were anti-JEV IgM antibody positive and 7 specimens
were detected as having JEV and BAV co-infections
[72]. Notably, all of the data reported on BAV infections
were only tested by indirect ELISA method. And no
four-fold or greater rise in BAV specific antibody by
neutralization test in serum collected during the acute
and convalescent phase of illness was available. In addition, except the first isolate of BAV from patients, no
secondary BAV has been isolated from patient again. So
it is important to conduct further investigation on BAV,
especially the association between BAV and human
diseases.
Liaoning virus (LNV)

This virus (LNV-NE9712) was first isolated from Aedes
dorsalis collected in Heishan in Jilin province in China
in 1997 [73]. LNV is a member of the genus Seadornavirus within the family Reoviridae and is composed of
12 segments of dsRNA [74]. The PAGE profile of LNV
is 6-5-1 which is different from that of BAV [75]. In
2005, a strain of virus (0507JSS60) was isolated from
corrals in Kashi in Xinjiang province and was identified
as LNV by serological and molecular biology assays [75]
(Figure 5). In 2007, a strain of virus (QH07130) was isolated from Culex modestus collected in reed ponds in
Minhe county in Qinghai province [15]. The PAGE profile of QH07130 strain is a typical 6-5-1 pattern.
Together with the results of serological and molecular
biology detections, QH07130 strain was identified as
LNV [15]. LNV could propagate in various mammalian
cell lines and caused hemorrhaging in mice, indicating
the potential threat to health of human and livestock
[76]. However, there has been no report that LNV is
associated with human or livestock diseases. Further
study of LNV especially on its virulence is highly
recommended.

Kadipiro virus (KDV)

KDV was first isolated from mosquitoes collected in
Indonesia [69]. KDV belongs to the genus Seadornavirus
within the family Reoviridae [74]. Five strains of this
virus were isolated from Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Anopheles sinensis and Armigeres obturbans in Yunnan province in China in 2005. A 758 bp amplicon was
obtained using KDV-specific polymerase chain reaction
primers for the five strains [77]. The nucleotide homology between the KDV Chinese isolates and KDV prototype (JKT-7075) was 90%, indicating that these five
isolates are indeed KDV (Figure 5). This was the first
report of KDV being isolated outside Indonesia [78]. At
present, there is no report that KDV is associated with
human or livestock diseases.
Yunnan Orbivirus (YUOV)

YUOV is a newly identified member of genus Orbivirus
within the family Reoviridae [79]. It was first isolated
from Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Lanchang County in
Yunnan province in southern China. Electron micrography of YUOV particles showed a defined surface structure, with ring-shaped capsomeres that are characteristic
of Orbivirus core particles [79]. The viral genome is
composed of 10 segments with conserved terminal
sequences similar to those of other Orbivirus species.
The agarose gel electrophoretic profile shows a 3-2-5
pattern. YUOV could replicate in Aedes albopictus mosquito cell lines C6/36 and AA23 but could not replicate
in mammalian cells. Intraperitoneal injections of YUOV
into mice resulted in productive, nonlethal virus replication and viremia, and could induce production of a protective antibody. The evolutionary relationship of YUOV
to 11 other species of the genus Orbivirus shows that it
is a newly identified species [79]. In recent years, six
strains of Orbivirus have been isolated from Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Anopheles sinensis, Culex fuscocephala
and Anopheles philippinensis. Serosurveys demonstrated
prevalence rates of 0.7% (1/135) of YUOV IgM antibodies and 5.9% (8/135) of IgG antibodies in febrile
patients in Yunnan province, giving evidence of YUOV
infection in the area [Wang JL, Zhang HL, Sun XH, Fu
SH, Wang HY, Wang HQ, Liang GD: Distribution of
mosquitoes and mosquito-borne arboviruses in Yunnan
Province near the China-Myanmar-Laos border,
Submitted]
Parvoviridae
Culex pipiens pallens densovirus (CppDNV)

During an investigation of arboviruses in China, a new
kind of virus with the same biological characteristics
and a genome sequence very similar to the viruses
belonging to the genus Brevidensoviruses within the
family Parvoviridae was firstly isolated from Culex
pipiens pallens in Liaoning province. Additional strains

of CppDNV were subsequently isolated from various
provinces of China (Table 1). The virus was designated
CppDNV after the vector from which it was isolated.
The virus was subsequently isolated from various kinds
of mosquitoes. Analyses of the phylogenetic relationships and the genomic nucleotide sequences of 16
strains isolated from Culex pipiens pallens (two strains),
Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus (two strains), Culex tritaeniorhynchus (three strains), Anopheles sinensis (one
strain), unclassified Culex mosquitoes (six strains) and
other miscellaneous mosquitoes (two strains) from the

Liaoning, Yunnan, Xinjiang and Guizhou provinces in
China demonstrated a nucleotide homology of more
than 98%. This confirmed that the virus was a newly
identified member of the species Aedes aegypti densovirus (AaeDNV) along with the previously identified
Aedes albopictus densovirus (AalDNV-2) [80].

Conclusions
In the last two decades, 12 species of viruses belonging
to five families have been newly identified in mainland
China. Four (TAHV, BATV, SINV and RRV) are

Liu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:68
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/68

pathogenic to humans and livestock. Four (BAV, LNV,
YUOV and CV) are initially isolated and identified in
China and are considered to be potential threats to
humans and livestock. One (CHIKV) is an imported
virus, and no autochthonous cases have been reported
in mainland China to date. One (GETV) is known as a
pathogen in horses and pigs. Two (KDV and CppDNV)
are associated with insects and are not pathogenic to
humans. These species of viruses have been isolated
from ten mosquito species in four genera, including
Culex pipiens pallens, Culex modestus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes (Och.) detritus, Aedes vexans, Aedes dorsalis, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles philippinensis,
Anopheles sinensis and Armigeres obturbans. Of this
growing list of arboviruses, most are mosquito borne.
The ability of such viruses to spread between geographic
regions through movements of people, animals and
goods means that addressing them clinically is of great
public health importance. Given the increasingly frequent international exchanges with China, the risk for
further introduction and exportation of the mosquitoborne viruses via human activity and transportation of
goods becomes greater, so enhanced monitoring and
long-term surveillance of these viruses are of great public health importance both in China and internationally.
