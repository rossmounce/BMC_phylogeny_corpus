silkworm, Bombyx mori

Abstract
Background: Apoptosis is regulated in an orderly fashion by a series of genes, and has a crucial role in important
physiological processes such as growth development, immunological response and so on. Recently, substantial
studies have been undertaken on apoptosis in model animals including humans, fruit flies, and the nematode.
However, the lack of genomic data for silkworms limits their usefulness in apoptosis studies, despite the
advantages of silkworm as a representative of Lepidoptera and an effective model system. Herein we have
identified apoptosis-related genes in the silkworm Bombyx mori and compared them to those from insects,
mammals, and nematodes.
Results: From the newly assembled genome databases, a genome-wide analysis of apoptosis-related genes in
Bombyx mori was performed using both nucleotide and protein Blast searches. Fifty-two apoptosis-related
candidate genes were identified, including five caspase family members, two tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
superfamily members, one Bcl-2 family member, four baculovirus IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) repeat (BIR) domain
family members and 1 RHG (Reaper, Hid, Grim, and Sickle; Drosophila cell death activators) family member.
Moreover, we identified a new caspase family member, BmCaspase-New, two splice variants of BmDronc, and
Bm3585, a mammalian TNF superfamily member homolog. Twenty-three of these apoptosis-related genes were
cloned and sequenced using cDNA templates isolated from BmE-SWU1 cells. Sequence analyses revealed that
these genes could have key roles in apoptosis.
Conclusions: Bombyx mori possesses potential apoptosis-related genes. We hypothesized that the classic intrinsic
and extrinsic apoptotic pathways potentially are active in Bombyx mori. These results lay the foundation for further
apoptosis-related study in Bombyx mori.

Background
Programmed cell death [1], as well as cell proliferation
and cell differentiation, has a crucial role in biological
growth and development. There are two primary programmed cell death signaling pathways [2], apoptosis [3]
and autophagy [4], of which apoptosis has been
researched more extensively. Apoptosis is characterized
by morphological changes and biochemical events such
as cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, phosphatidylserine extrusion, vacuolization, chromatin condensation,
DNA fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies
that are ultimately engulfed by surrounding cells or

macrophages [2]. Cell death by autophagy involves cell
degradation by internal lysozymes [4]. There are very
important connections between apoptotic cell death and
autophagic cell death, as they occur concurrently in
many processes [5].
Apoptotic mechanisms are being clarified in model
organisms using completed genome sequences, especially in nematodes, fruit flies and humans. Compared
to Drosophila and humans, the apoptosis network in
nematodes is much simpler [6]. There are several differences in apoptotic mechanisms between mammals and
nematodes. In mammals, two primary apoptotic signaling pathways have been described: the extrinsic pathway,
which is initiated by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/
nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors superfamily [7-11],
and the intrinsic pathway, which include the mitochondrial pathway, the endoplasmic reticulum pathway and

the DNA damage pathway [12-15]. The intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways are connected by caspase-mediated
activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member
BID and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), which converge on effector caspase activation [16-19]. Most insect
apoptosis research has used Drosophila. There are some
fundamental differences in apoptotic signaling pathways
between Drosophila and mammals. For example, the
absence of RHG (Reaper, Hid, Grim and Sickle) family
proteins virtually blocks apoptosis [20]. Although Smac/
Dablo and Htra2/Omi are functional homologs of the
RHG family, their apoptotic roles are not as critical in
vertebrates as RHG is in Drosophila [21]. Furthermore,
cytochrome-c is dispensable for caspase activation
[22-26] and it is unclear whether mitochondria participate in apoptosis [27,28] in Drosophila. Kumarswamya
and colleagues [29] recently used Sf9 cells to demonstrate that cyosolic cytochrome-c release is an essential
event for caspase activation during Lepidopteran apoptosis, and that cytochrome-c release might occur independent of mitochondrial membrane potential loss and
permeability transition pore formation. Furthermore,
cytochrome-c has been detected by Western blot in the
cytoplasm of UV-induced apoptotic silkworm cells,
BmE-SWU1 [30]. These all are distinctively different
from the mechanisms reported in Drosophila, but are
similar to mammalian apoptosis.
The domestic silkworm Bombyx mori (a representative
of Lepidoptera) has important economic value. Investigation into apoptosis in Lepidotera began at the same time
as Drosophila [31,32]. Since intersegmental muscle
apoptosis was studied in 1965 [31], apoptosis research in
silkworm has lagged far behind that of other organisms
until the 1990s. Now, apoptosis research in silkworms
mainly focus on two aspects. First, the morphological
changes in tissues and cells during apoptosis-induced by
extrinsic factors (such as ecdysone [33] or hemolymph
[34-41]) and intrinsic factors (such as actinomycin D,
ultraviolet light, and viruses [42-46]), the individual
organs (e.g. wing or palea) in Bombyx mori apoptotic
mutants [47] and tissues (midgut, silk gland) during
metamorphosis [48]. The second aspect is gene cloning
and identification. Tambunan [49] found that BmP109 in
Bombyx mori contains the four conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions, BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4. Huang and
colleagues [50] have cloned the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) homolog BmIAP from Bombyx mori BmN cells, and
found that BmIAP inhibits apoptosis induced by Bax, but
not Fas, in mammalian cells. Their biochemical data also
suggested that BmIAP is a specific inhibitor of mammalian Caspase-9, but not the downstream effectors caspase-3 and caspase-7. In the same year, Kim and
colleagues [34] reported that the 30 K protein from silkworm hemolymph inhibits virus- or chemical-induced

apoptosis in human cells as well as insect cells, although
the mechanism remains unknown. The first caspase
family member identified was BmCaspase-1 in BmN cells
[51]. Subsequently, the caspase family members BmICE
[52], BmICE-2 and BmICE-5 [53] were cloned from
Bombyx mori midgut and BmE cells. Recently, Bryant
and colleagues [54] demonstrated both Drosophila
DmReaper and its Bombyx mori ortholog BmReaper possessed conservative IAP binding and GH3 (Grim Helix 3)
motifs. The Bombyx mori homologs BmPkc [55], BmIcad
[56], and BmCdc2 [57] also have been cloned. However,
how these genes participate in apoptosis in the silkworm
is still unclear, and this area of research has been very
fragmented.
Apoptotic mechanisms in model organisms (such as
the nematode, Drosophila and mammals) can not accurately reflect the apoptotic mechanisms in silkworm. For
these reasons, comprehensive and in-depth apoptosis
research in Bombyx mori is urgent. Fortunately, the
completion of the silkworm genome sequence [58] and
a whole-genome chip [59] provide important tools for
apoptosis research in Bombyx mori. Herein we looked
for possible apoptosis-related homologs using information analysis in 9× genome sequencing data. Genes of
interest were cloned and verified using cDNA templates
isolated from the BmE cell line and different developmental stages of Bombyx mori. Finally, the potential
apoptotic pathways in which these genes may act in
Bombyx mori were analyzed.

Results
Identification of silkworm apoptosis-related genes

We have identified 52 apoptosis-related genes, including
five members of the caspase family (BmICE, BmICE-2
and BmICE-5 are splice variants of BmICE; BmDroncL
and BmDroncS are splice variants of BmDronc). We have
also identified one member of the Bcl-2 family, two
members of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF), and four
members of the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain
family in Bombyx mori (Table 1). Seventeen genes
(BmAkt, BmCaspase-1, BmICE, BmDredd, BmCdc2,
BmCyt C, BmErk, BmICAD, BmIAP, BmICE-2, BmICE-5,
BmJnk, BmPdk, BmPka, BmPkc, BmRas, BmReaper,
BmSir2, and BmStat) have been previously included in
NCBI, among which ten genes have been reported in
Bombyx mori including BmCaspase-1 [51], BmICE [52],
BmCdc2 [57], BmErk [60], BmICAD [56], BmIAP [50],
BmJnk [61], BmPkc [55], BmReaper [56], BmCyt C
[30], BmICE-2 and BmICE-5 [53] (Additional file 1
Table A). Thirty five apoptosis genes were identified
(Table 1) and accepted by the NCBI (Gene IDs are provided in detail in Additional file 1 Table B). These silkworm apoptosis-related genes are located on most of the
28 chromosomes, except the chromosomes 1, 6, 19, 24,

27, and 28. The number of exons in the genes varied
from one to dozens. The comparing key apoptosisrelated gene numbers in various species (Table 2) shows
that there are fewer homologous genes in insects than in
the higher eukaryotes. Many important genes in apoptosis pathways were cloned and identified, such as BmApaf-1, BmP53, BmHtra2, and BmEndo G (Table 1 and
Additional file 2). However, we did not find homolog hits
for many genes in our silkworm databases, including
almost all genes of the Bcl-2 and TNFSF families, and
caspase-6/-7, Hid, Grim, and Sickle of the RHG family
(detailed in Additional file 3 table A). Detailed analysis of
primary families and genes involved in apoptotic pathways follows.
Caspase family members in silkworm

Caspase are a family of cysteinyl aspartate proteinases
with two main branches: the pro-inflammatory ICE-like
subfamily, previously found only in vertebrates [62], and
the apoptotic caspase subfamily. All caspases, normally
present as inactive proenzymes in cells, have three different regions: N-terminal prodomains, a large catalytic
domain (approximately 20 kD, known as P20) and a
small catalytic domain (approximately 10 kD, known as
P10). Based on the length of the prodomain, caspases
are divided into two groups: class I (initiators), which
have a relatively long prodomain, and class II (effectors),
which have a short prodomain (Figure 1). Based on the
N-terminal prodomain, the initiators can be divided
further into two categories: one class containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), such as caspase-2
and -9 in mammals and DRONC in fruit flies, and the
other possessing a death effector domain (DED), such as
caspase-8 and -10 in mammals. The mammalian caspase-8 is replaced functionally by the Drosophila homologue DmDredd, while DmDredd does not have a DED
in its N-terminal prodomain [63,64] (Figure 1).
Five caspase family homologs were cloned from the silkworm, including 2 initiators (BmDredd and BmDronc),

and 3 effectors (BmCaspase-1, BmICE, and BmCaspase-N;
Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree of caspase family members in silkworm and other species showed that all the
intiator and effector homologs are clustered into group I
and group II, respectively. The initiator caspases containing DED domain are clustered into group I, while others
containing CARD domain and DmDecay into the other
subgroup (Figure 2). The results reveal that the caspase
family members are functionally conserved between
species.
Silkworm initiator caspase homologs BmDronc and
BmDredd

Caspase-9 has a crucial role during apoptosis from
nematodes to mammals. Recently, Dronc (Drosophila
Nedd2-like caspase) homologs have been identified in
the genomes of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae
(GenBank Accession: 1278470) [65]. The mammalian
caspase-9 homolog BmDronc was identified in silkworm,
which has two splice variants with common translation
initiation and termination sites, named BmDroncL (415
aa) and BmDroncS (183 aa) respectively, and verified by
cloning from silkworm BmE cells (Figure 1). Only
BmDroncS has a CARD domain and a small subunit,
while BmDroncL has the typical caspase family domains
(Figure 1). The sequence identities of silkworm
BmDroncL with homologs from Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, and Aedes aegypti are 24%, 29% and
35%, respectively.
An ortholog of Drosophila Dredd was also found in the
silkworm, named BmDredd (1950 bp, 543aa, figure 1),
consistent with the data submitted to NCBI (GeneID:
100141428). The result of domain prediction revealed that
BmDredd, AeDredd and DmDredd have long prodomains
but no domains that mark them as initiator caspases
(Figure 2), unlike mammalian caspase-8 with DEDs. The
genetic relationship between caspases from silkworm,
Aedes aegypti and Drosophila is much closer than with
other species (Figure 2). The sequence identities and

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of putative caspase family members in Bombyx mori. A diagrammatic representation of the domain
architecture of the initiator, executioner and putative apoptotic caspase proenzymes of the silkworm is shown here. The protein sequence
“QACXG” is in the small subunit of all caspase family members; X is usually R or Q. The numbers are the start and end of these domains in the
protein sequences.

similarities of BmDredd with DmDredd and AeDredd are
28% and 45%, 27% and 45%, respectively.
Silkworm effector caspases

Bmcaspase-1 is the first effector caspase reported in
Bombyx mori. Pei and colleagues [51] identified Bmcaspase-1 (GeneBank Accession: AF448494) from Bombyx
mori BmN cells. Bmcaspase-1 has only one exon, is
1291 bp long, coding for 293aa, and is located on chromosome 10 (Table 1). Bmcaspase-1 has the classic short
prodomain, with the characteristic QACXG sequence in
the large subunit (residues 56 - 179) and the small subunit (residues 197 - 292; Figure 1). From the evolutionary relationship, BmCaspase-1 clusters into the same
group with DmICE and DmDcp-1 of Drosophila melanoganster (Figure 2). Duan and colleagues [52] identified

BmICE (275 aa, GeneBank accession: AY88522) from
the Bombyx mori integumentum, and Song and colleagues [53] have cloned BmICE-2 (284 aa) and BmICE-5
(312 aa; GeneBank accession numbers DQ360829 and
DQ360830, respectively) according to the sequence submitted by Duan [52] from BmE cells. All these genes
have the characteristic QRCAG sequence and the typical large/small subunit configuration of caspase family
members (Figure 1). We aligned and analyzed the
sequences of these three coding sequences with the silkworm 9× genome database, and the result reveals that
BmICE, BmICE-2 and BmICE-5 have the same translation and termination sites (Additional file 4). BmICE
has seven exons, BmICE-2 has eight exons and BmICE5 has nine exons; the splicing differences occur after the
seventh exon (Additional file 4).

Figure 2 The caspase family tree and domain architecture. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using musle.exe. The neighborjoining tree was produced using MEGA4.0. The putative caspase family members identified in Bombyx mori are marked with large red dots. The
domain architectures and the full species names are listed in the black frame on the right.

Our results demonstrated that there is an additional caspase family member in Bombyx mori. Because it has not
been reported in Bombyx mori previously, we named it
BmCaspase-New (BmCaspase-N). Bmcaspase-N is 1071 bp
long, coding for 356 aa, and possesses the characteristic
structure of caspase effector subfamily members, including a
short prodomain and CASc domain with the QACXG
sequence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Bmcaspase-N
clusters into the effector group (Figure 2). Thus we propose
that BmCaspase-N belongs to the effector caspase subfamily.
Bcl-2 family members in silkworms

Bcl-2 family members participate at a crucial point in
apoptotic pathways. All members share at least one of
four BH domains (BH1, BH2, BH3 or BH4). Tambunan
and colleagues [49] identified BmP109 from samples

obtained during silk gland histolysis, a stage of Bombyx
mori metamorphosis. However, the function of BmP109
with all four conserved BH regions has not been confirmed in Bombyx mori.
We analyzed and cloned the other Bcl-2 family homolog BmBuffy, whose structure is more similar to Buffy of
Apis mellifera and bcl-2 of Pediculus humanus corporis
(Figure 3). BmBuffy lacks the BH4 domain. The completed BmBuffy cDNA is 1632 bp, coding for 292 aa,
and the relative predicted molecular mass is 32.38 kDa.
The sequence similarity and identity are 51% and 27%,
respectively, compared with DmBuffy.
BIR domain family members in silkworms

The BIR domain is a unique structure originally identified
in IAP proteins from baculoviruses. At least one BIR motif

is essential for the antiapoptotic activity of IAP family
members, but not all BIR-containing proteins (BIRPs) are
IAPs [56]. We identified four proteins containing BIR
domains in Bombyx mori, including two IAPs, one Bruce
and one survivin. Huang and colleagues [50] cloned the
first IAP family member BmIAP from Bombyx mori BmN
cells. BmIAP is a specific inhibitor of mammalian caspase9, but does not directly inhibit the downstream effector
proteases caspase-3 and caspase-7. BmIAP inhibits apoptosis induced by Bax but not Fas in vitro. However, the
function of BmIAP in vivo is not yet known. The other
IAP family member BmIAP2 is located on the same chromosome as BmIAP, is 561 aa long and possesses three BIR

domains and one Zn 2+-finger domain. Compared with
DIAP1 and DIAP2, BmIAP1 and BmIAP2 have two and
three BIR domains, respectively, also (Figure 4). The
BmBruce and survivin proteins each have one BIR domain,
with a sequence consistent with the online BIR sequence
(http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/nicedoc.pl?PS50143), and
are 4236 aa and 136 aa long, respectively (Figure 4).
Besides their size difference, BmBruce also has an ubiquitin-proteasome binding motif, which is homologous to
Drosophila Bruce protein [66].
RHG family members in Drosophila contain the IAPBinding-Motif (IBM) domain in their N-terminal, which
binds to and removes the inhibitory activity of IAP

[21,28,67] as well as their structural and functional
homologs Smac/Diablo in mammals [68]. However, RHG
family proteins connect many different signaling pathways, thereby having a central role in the regulation of
programmed cell death in Drosophila, which is very different from other species, especially compared to mammalian Smac/Diablo [69]. Another IAP inhibitor, Htra2/
Omi in mammals and its homolog protein DmHtra/Omi
in Drosophila, have a function similar to Smac/Diablo.
DmHtra2/Omi in Drosophila also has serine protease
activity. Interestingly, reducing DmOmi expression by
RNAi in the fly inhibits stress-induced apoptosis, while
the neurodegeneration is increased in the Htra2/Omi
knockout mouse [28]. The homolog BmReaper, an ortholog of Drosophila reaper, was found in silkworm [54].
BmReaper has both IBM and GH3 domain, which can
bind to BmIAP and induce apoptosis in insect cells. The
homolog BmHtra2 was also found in the silkworm and
cloned (Additional file 2).
TNFSF and their receptors in silkworm

TNF family ligands and their corresponding receptors
(TNFR) have pivotal roles in many important physiological processes, such as host defense, inflammation,

apoptosis, autoimmunity and immune system organogenesis. The TNF-related ligands are type II (intracellular N-terminus) transmembrane proteins containing a
TNF homology domain (THD) at the extracellular C
terminus. Protein sequences of 18 TNFSF ligands in
mammals [70] and the TNF ligand Eiger in Drosophila
[62] used as queries were aligned with the silkworm predicted protein database by BlastP. Two TNFSF members, Bm3585 and Bm3614, were identified. They are
located on chromosome 5 (Table 1). Bm3585 and
Bm3614 possess the typical THD as predicted (http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; Table 1), and demonstrated that
potential TNF ligands are present in Bombyx mori. The
phylogenetic tree of TNFSF between silkworm and
other species show that Bm3614 and the insect Eiger
homolog are in one cluster, while Bm3585 and TNFSF5
are classified close together, but the two TNF ligand
homologs are evolutionarily distant (Figure 5), all of
which indicate that a gene deletion or duplication event
might had happened.
Using sequence information from 31 TNFR superfamily (TNFRSF) proteins [70] from mammals and one
TNFRSF protein from insects, a search for possible TNF
receptors was performed in Bombyx mori, but no match

Figure 5 Phylogenetic tree of the TNF superfamily. This phylogenetic tree of the TNF superfamily was produced by neighbor-joining of
multiple sequence alignment of TNF superfamily sequences from insect and the homologous sequences of the TNFSF from higher animals
[including Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Monodelphis domestica, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmo salar and Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis]. Because
the silkworm TNFSF homologs were produced by alignment with TNFSF5 and TNFSF13, the TNFSF sequences used in this phylogenetic tree
were the TNFSF5 and TNFSF13 in different species. The TNFSF members predicted in Bombyx mori are marked with large red dots. The protein
names use an abbreviation of species and gene names. The full species names are listed in the black frame on the right.

to the TNFR domains was found. However, many predicted proteins (mainly transmembrane proteins, fiber
proteins, or mucous membrane proteins) possessed all
the structural motifs, such as a cysteine-rich domain,
Ca2+-binding site, and receptor/ligand interaction site
(data not shown), but did not meet our criteria. However, homologs containing DDs (death domains) such as
BmDaxx and BmFadd, were found in the silkworm.
Expression profiles of apoptosis-related genes
in silkworm
ESTs analysis

In order to detect the expression of the Bombyx mori
apoptosis-related genes, we searched the silkworm

dbEST database downloaded from GenBank using the
putative coding sequences as queries. Forty apoptotic
genes matched at least one EST. Nine genes had complete expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and the remaining
genes had incomplete ESTs (Table 1).
Microarray-based gene expression profiles in different
development stages

To analyze the expression of the silkworm apoptosisrelated genes in different developmental stages according
the chips, a BlastN alignment was performed using the
silkworm different developmental stage database. The
results indicated that all the apoptosis-related genes contained at least one oligonucleotide probes except
BmDredd, BmFadd, BmGsk3 (Table 1), for which no

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:611
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/611

probe was found. Only 26 apoptosis-genes show higher
expression than in the 3rd day of the fifth instar, when
almost all genes expressed in the silkworm are present
(Figure 6). The results revealed that the expressions of
apoptosis-genes are relative low in silkworm.
The identification of apoptosis-related genes in silkworm

To test the expression of the apoptosis genes, we
designed primers for 32 genes according to their predicted DNA sequences (Additional file 2) and carried out
RT-PCR using the cDNA isolated from the different
development stages of silkworm and BmE cells exposed
to different stressors as described in the Methods section.
Twenty three of all apoptosis-related genes tested were
cloned and sequenced, five apoptosis-related genes were
detected by RT-PCR but not sequenced successfully,
although the PCR product sizes were consistent with the
predicted sizes, and four silkworm apoptosis-related
genes were not detected (Additional file 2). Overall, the
expression of these genes, except a few, was relatively
much lower than BmActin3 expression (Figure 7). The
results show that most of the key apoptosis-genes in silkworm are expressed, which revealed that these potential
apoptosis-genes are present in Bombyx mori.

Discussion
The silkworm apoptosis-related genes

In this study, we identified and cloned 52 silkworm apoptosis-related genes, including homologs of almost all the
key genes involved in apoptosis pathways in other species. The fact that the BH3-only subfamily only existed in
vertebrates, while the RHG family is found only in
insects, reveals conservation within species and the variability among the species, although their functional homologs exist in mammals. Moreover, the main families of
apoptosis-related genes exist in all model organisms, but
the gene numbers in some species (such as the caspase
family in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) are much
higher, indicating that expansion might have occurred in
these species, most likely due to environmental stress.
The key genes involved in apoptosis pathways in Bombyx mori are described in detail in Table 1. Interestingly,
TNFSF members containing DDs, caspase family members involved in inflammation, and the BH3-only Bcl-2
family members are not found in Bombyx mori. However,
the silkworm not only has an insect Eiger homolog
Bm3614, but also has Bm3585, which is similar to mammalian TNFSF5, neither of which have been reported in
either Drosophila or mosquito. These results suggest that
some genes may be lost in evolution. The new putative
effector caspase Bmcaspase-N was found in silkworms,
but not in mosquitoes [71] or Drosophila, suggesting that
gene expansion occurred in Bombyx mori after the insect
diverged from the common ancestor. For example, since
BmDroncS only has a CARD and a small subunit that

Page 11 of 17

lacking the core active site, it may act as a caspase-like
decoy molecule [72]. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of caspase family members in Bombyx mori with
those involved in apoptotic pathways in other species
shows that caspase-8 homologs lacking DED domains in
insects are clustered into the same class, which suggests
that the caspase-8 homology gene mutation might have
occurred after divergence of animals and insects. In contrast, the presence of all caspase-9 homologs in the same
class suggests caspase-9 is highly conserved from insects
to mammals (Figure 2). In addition, BmBruce has an ubiquitin-proteasome binding motif, which suggests that the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be present in Bombyx
mori, as in Drosophila [69].
The possible apoptosis pathways of Bombyx mori

The apoptosis-related factors identified in silkworms
cover almost all the critical junctions in the apoptosis
pathways of other model organisms. Although Fas and
its receptor were not found, we found some proteins
predicted containing cysteine regions, Ca 2+ binding
sites, or the typical receptor/ligand interaction sites of
TNFRSF members (data not shown), downstream genes
such as BmTraf family members and BmFadd, which
contain DDs, and BmDredd. All these results suggest
that the death receptor pathway may be present in Bombyx mori. We hypothesize that the epidermal growth
factor pathway also exists in Bombyx mori, because
homologs of the mammalian members of this pathway
were cloned and identified in Bombyx mori, including
BmRaf, BmRas, BmPka, BmPkc, BmErk, BmPi3k,
BmStat, BmAkt, BmGsk3, and BmFkhr. The Bombyx
mori homologs of Cyt C, Apaf-1, Caspase-9, Aif, Endo
G, and Htra2 were identified and characterized in Bombyx mori, and Kumarswamy and colleagues [29] and the
Pan group [30] have demonstrated cytochrome C release
into the cytoplasm in stress-induced apoptotic Sf-9 and
BmE cells. Therefore, the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway may be functional in Bombyx mori. Furthermore,
the DmReaper orthologs found in Bombyx mori indicate
that this apoptotic gene is conserved between species. In
addition, key genes in the DNA damage response pathway, like BmP53 and BmSir2, are also identified, so we
hypothesize that the DNA damage pathway is also functional in Bombyx mori. In conclusion, the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways described in other models may
potentially exist in Bombyx mori.
In 1965 silkworm hemolymph was used as an additional agent in cell culture in vitro [73]. Rhee and colleagues confirmed that silkworm hemolymph inhibited
cell apoptosis not only in a baculovirus-induced insect
cell system [35] but also in a human cell system [36]. In
2002, this group reported that they isolated and characterized an apoptosis-inhibiting hemolymph component

[34]. Later they constructed a recombinant vector to
express the protein and purify it in vitro, and confirmed
this protein is one of the 30K proteins isolated from
silkworm hemolymph used to minimize cell death. They

speculated that the 30Kc6 protein inhibits the apoptosis
by involvement upstream of caspase3 activation [37,38].
Therefore, there might be differences between Bombyx
mori and other models in the regulation of apoptosis.

Questions remain as to the precise regulation of apoptosis in Bombyx mori: for example, the central role of
BmReaper, as well its homolog in Drosophila, and
whether BmCytC is released from the mitochondria as

in mammals. Also, the BH3-only Bcl-2 family members
that link the two primary apoptotic pathways are not
found in Bombyx mori and have not been reported in
insects. Identification of a surrogate protein that

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:611
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/611

performs the same function would provide great insight
into apoptosis in the silkworm.

Conclusions
Biochemical evidence and comparative genomic analyses
with mammals and other organisms show that many
apoptosis-related gene homologs are present in Bombyx
mori, and suggest that the typical apoptotic pathways
exist in Bombyx mori. The identification of these new
genes in Bombyx mori further supports the universality
of apoptotic mechanisms. The data in this study provide
an overview for putative apoptosis-related genes in Bombyx mori, which should contribute to mechanistic studies of apoptosis in Bombyx mori in the future.
Methods
Cell line and Bombyx mori

The BmE (Bombyx mori Embryo) cell line BmE-SWU1
[74] was cultured in Grace medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 27°C in an incubator. The Bombyx mori DaZao strain larvae were bred with fresh mulberry leaves at 25°C with a 12 h:12 h photoperiod.
Identification of silkworm apoptosis-related genes

The databases used for the Bombyx mori genomic information include Bombyx mori 9x genomic sequencing
database, Bombyx mori EST database, CDS database,
and predicted protein database (all found through http://
silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb/). The nucleotide and protein sequences of apoptosis-related homolog of different
species (including Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens) were
obtained from the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov) (described in detail in Additional file 3 Table B).
For the comparison analysis, the gene sequences,
mRNA sequences, and protein sequences of apoptosisrelated gene homologs in various sepecies were downloaded from NCBI. Three methods were used as follows:
1. The protein sequences of apoptosis-related genes as
queries were aligned with the predicted protein database by the BlastP program using amino acid sequence
homology and an E-value of 0 (to account for the large
differences between species). Predicted silkworm genes
in the comparison results were selected to compare
with the NCBI protein database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi) for further confirmation. If the predicted gene contained the same domains as its homolog and the first genes in the alignment result is the
homolog in other species, then the predicted gene was
considered a homolog in silkworm.
2. The sequences of the conserved domains of the
gene intercepted were used as queries to perform
BlastP searches against the silkworm predicted protein

Page 14 of 17

database and TBlastN searches against the silkworm
9x genome sequence using an E-value of 0. The identification is the same as described above. (TNFSF family
members, BH-3 only subfamily members and RHG
family members were analyzed using this method.)
3. Apoptosis-related genes not found in the silkworm database, were searched against the silkworm
EST database by TblastN program using an E-value
of 0. A method of cloning electronically was used,
and we confirmed the result as above. (BmBuffy was
checked using this method)
Finally, to acquire detailed information about the predicted gene, all the putative apoptosis-related genes in
Bombyx mori were aligned with the 9x silkworm genomic database, EST database, and the microarray chip
databases for different developmental stages using the
BlastN program.
Domain prediction, multiple sequence alignments and
phylogenetic tree construction

All the domains of the putative apoptosis-related genes
of the silkworm Bombyx mori are predicted (http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) or (http://www.expasy.org/
prosite/). Multiple sequence alignments were carried out
using Clustal W or Muscle.exe programs. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed using MEGA version 4.0 [75].
Treatments and RNA extraction

BmE cells were exposed to 200 ng/ml actinomycin D for
12 h or irradiated for 70 s with 30 J/m2 UV, and then cultured normally for another 12 h. Larva [approximately 48
hours after wandering (spinning just finished)], pupa
[approximately 96 hours after wandering (newly formed)
and on approximately the 9th day after wandering (the
day before becoming a moth)], and the adult moth were
collected, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen.
Total mRNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), and DNA contamination in the mRNA samples was digested with RNase-free DNase I (Takara,
Japan). The concentration of RNA was calculated by
spectrophotometry (Gene Spec V; HITACHI, Japan). The
first strand of cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg mRNA
using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, USA).
Verification of the putative silkworm apoptosis-related genes

The PCR primers were designed based on the coding
sequences of the putative silkworm apoptosis-related
genes identified by the bio-informatics analysis (Additional
file 2). Silkworm cytoplasmic actin A3 gene (forward primer: 5’-AAC ACC CCG TCC TGC TCA CTG-3’; reverse
primer: 5’-GGG CGA GAC GTG TGA TTT CCT-3’) was
used as an internal control. PCR amplification was

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:611
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/611

performed in a total reaction volume of 25 μl, containing
normalized cDNA (6 μg cDNA except BmActin3 using 3
μg cDNA), 15 pmol of each primer (1 μl), 2 mM MgCl2 (2
μl), 0.25 mM dNTP (2 μl), 1× buffer (2.5 μl), 2.5 units of
Taq DNA polymerase and distilled deionized H2O. PCR
was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for
3 min, followed by 25 cycles of 30 s each at 94°C, 1 min
annealing (at the temperatures listed in Additional file 2),
1-3 min extension at 72°C (the time depends on the length
of the gene), and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The
amplification products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels,
and sequenced and confirmed by the Ying Jun Company
and Bio-engineering (Shanghai, China).
Analysis of apoptosis-related genes of different
developmental stages

More than 184201 ESTs from Bombyx mori are available
in the NCBI database. To search transcripts for individual
apoptosis-related genes, a BlastN search was conducted
against the silkworm EST database. The putative coding
sequences were used as queries. A 95% or greater identity
and minimum cut-off E-value (less than or equal to e-20)
were employed to discriminate between duplicated genes.
Microarray data analysis was performed as described by
Xia and colleagues [59].
