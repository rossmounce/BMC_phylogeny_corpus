Abstract
Background: Sequence information on the 16S-23S rDNA internal spacer region (ISR) exhibits a
large degree of sequence and length variation at both the genus and species levels. A primer pair
for the amplification of 16S-23S rDNA ISR generated three amplicons for each of isolates of
Taylorella asinigenitalis (UCD-1T, UK-1 and UK-2).
Findings: Following TA cloning and sequencing, the three isolates of T. asinigenitalis were
demonstrated to possess three ISR units of different lengths. Although the three corresponding
ISRs (A, B and C) were identified to be identical to each other (UK-1 and UK-2 isolates), the ISRs
shared approximately 95.3–98.9% nucleotide sequence similarities between the UCD-1T and UK1/-2 isolates. A typical order of two intercistronic tRNA genes (5'-tRNAIle-tRNAAla-3') with the
different nucleotide spacers [44 through 51 base pairs (bp)] in length was identified among the
isolates. The consensus sequences of the antiterminators of boxB and boxA were also identified
in all ISRs. Thus, three ISRs were identified for each isolate, and therefore, at least three distinctly
different ribosomal RNA operons were suggested to occur in the genome of T. asinigenitalis. This
was also confirmed by Southern hybridization procedure.
Conclusion: The present study represents a dendrogram constructed based on the nucleotide
sequence data of 16S-23S rDNA ISR for T. asinigenitalis, which may aid in the phylogenetic
positioning of T. asinigenitalis within the genus Taylorella, and in the molecular discrimination of T.
asinigenitalis.

Background
Taylorella equigenitalis, a Gram-negative, non-motile coccobacillus β-Proteobacteria, is an important pathogen
responsible for contagious equine metritis (CEM) [1-4].
In late 1997 and in early 1998, three bacterial isolates
were isolated from donkey jacks (Equus asinus) in the USA

and a new second species of the genus Taylorella, T. asinigenitalis, was established for these atypical organisms
[5,6]. Additional T. asinigenitalis isolates (Bd3751/05 and
115/04) were obtained more recently and were identified
from the genital tract of stallions in Sweden (GenBank
accession No. DQ099547) and in Spain (DQ 393780).

these five isolates of T. asinigenitalis have already been
deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (AF297174 for UK-1,
AF297175 for UK-2, AF067729 for UCD-1T, DQ099547
for Bd3751/05 and DQ393780 for 115/04). It was demonstrated that the sequences were almost identical (>
99.8% similarity) among the three isolates obtained in
the USA [6]. However, no sequence information on the
16S-23S rDNA internal spacer region (ISR), which exhibits a large degree of sequence and length variation at both
the genus and species levels [7,8], of T. asinigenitalis have
yet been reported.

Random primer extension was performed in order to prepare the fragment using a DIG-High Prime kit (Roche
Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany).

Therefore, the aim of the present study is to clone,
sequence, and analyze the 16S-23S rDNA ISRs of three
isolates of T. asinigenitalis (UCD-1T, UK-1 and UK-2) and
to compare the ISRs sequence data.

Results and discussion

Methods
In the present study, three isolates of T. asinigenitalis
(UCD-1T, UK-1 and UK-2; [5,6]) were analyzed. The conditions for cell culturing have previously been described
by Matsuda and colleagues [9,10]. Genomic DNA preparation for the PCR amplification was carried out, as
described already [11,12].
The primer pair used for the 16S-23S rDNA ISR amplification of T. asinigenitalis isolates in the present study was
ISR-Tef (5'-CTGGGGTGAAGTCGTAACAAG-3') for the
forward primer and ISR-5r (5'-GCCAAGGCATCCACC-3';
the sequence of region 5 reported by Gurtler and Stanisich
(1996) [7,12] for the reverse primer. The ISR-Tef primer
was designed in silico in the present study for PCR amplification of full-length ISR of the genus Taylorella.
PCR mastermix contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM
KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM of each dNTP, 1 μM of each
primer and 0.5 unit of EX Taq™ DNA polymerase, which possesses 3'-5' exonuclease activity (Takara BioInc. Shiga,
Japan). PCR was performed in a 50 μl volume, for 25 cycles
at 94°C for 1 min, 65.4°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec and
finally 72°C for 7 min. Purification of the amplified PCR
products and TA cloning of the PCR amplicons were carried
out, as described previously [12]. Dideoxynucleotide
sequencing and sequence analysis were also performed, as
described previously [12]. For accurate sequencing, multiple
TA-cloned PCR products were sequenced. The sequence data
of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR of T. asinigenitalis determined in the
present study have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank
(AB264283–AB264291).
Southern blot hybridization analysis of the ISR was carried out using digoxigenin (DIG) labeled fragment of the
ISRA (nucleotide position 452–761:AB264283) prepared
from the T. asinigenitalis UCD-1T, as a probe with Pst I
digested whole genome DNAs, respectively, according to
the procedure described by Sambrook et al. (2001) [11].

Nucleotide sequences of the ISRs from the isolates of the
genus Taylorella were compared to each other using CLUSTAL W software [13], which was incorporated in the
GENETYX version 9 (GENETYX Co., Tokyo, Japan) computer software. Following this, a phylogenetic tree was
constructed by an unweighted pair group mean average
(UPGMA) method available on the GENETYX (version 9).

The PCR primer pair (ISR-Tef and ISR-5r) used for the
amplification of the segments containing the 16S-23S
rDNA ISRs of the three T. asinigenitalis isolates produced
three amplicons of approximately 930 to 1,050 bp in
length for the three isolates, respectively (data not
shown). This may imply that T. asinigenitalis possesses at
least three ISR units of different lengths. Subsequently,
nine purified and cloned fragments, containing the ISRs,
were subjected to TA cloning and sequencing. The
sequences corresponding to the PCR primers (ISR-Tef/-5r)
were excluded from the sequence data and further analysis
in the present study. The sequences containing the two
16S-23S rDNA ISRs from T. equigenitalis NCTC11184T
(AB113653 and AB113656) were also compared. The
genetic relatedness of the ISRs is shown in Figure 1.
The sequence corresponding to the CCUCCU sequence, a
highly conserved sequence close to the 3' end of the
mature 16S rRNA that is complementary to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on mRNA [14,15], was identified in the
sequences of the amplicons of T. asinigenitalis isolates
[nucleotide position 31–36; AB264283–AB264291], as
well as T. equigenitalis isolates (AF408197, AB066372,
AB069660, AB113653–AB113658). Thus, in the present
sequencing study of the ISRs of T. asinigenitalis, CCTCCT
sequences were observed in all isolates examined, where
the 3' end of some bases downstream of the CCTCCT
sequence may represent the probable 3' end of the 16S
rRNA gene.
In relation to the 3' end of the ISR of T. asinigenitalis isolates,
the probable 3' end of the ISR may represent the nucleotide
position 989 of the NISR-A of T. equigenitalis NCTC11184T,
since the nucleotide position 990 of the NISR-A of T. equigenitalis NCTC11184T [12] was previously deduced to be the
possible 5' end of the 23S rDNA sequence of T. equigenitalis
by the nucleotide sequence alignment and analysis of the ISR
sequences, with the 5' end sequences of the 23S rDNA from
several bacterial species (see Figure 2 in the paper described
by Kagawa et al. (2006) [12].
Consequently, the 16S-23S rDNA ISRs (A, B and C) from
the three isolates of T. asinigenitalis were estimated to be

sus sequences of the antiterminators of boxB (a stem-loop
structure with no apparent sequence conservation at
nucleotide position 486–500) and boxA (a conserved
sequence, TGTTCTTTAACA, at nucleotide position 576–
587 in AB264283 for the ISR-A of UCD-1T) were also
identified in all three kinds of ISRs (Fig. 3). As illustrated
in Figure 3, boxA occured with sequences among the 11
ISRs from the genus Taylorella examined. Although the
nucleotide sequence differences in the boxB were demonstrated at two loci between the UCD-1T ISR-A and -B/-C in
the 15–16 nucleotide sequence, boxB of UCD-1T ISR-A
was identical to those of UK-1 and -2. In addition, the two
ISR-A and -B from T. equigenitalis NCTC11184T were relatively divergent with respect to boxB (nucleotide position
487–509 in AB113653 for the ISR-A) from those of T.
asinigenitalis isolates, respectively, as shown in Figure 3.
When Southern blot hybridization analysis was carried
out in order to clarify how many ISRs occur in the genome
of the three T. asinigenitalis isolates, the occurrence of the
three was identified in all the three isolates, respectively
(Fig. 4).

approximately 837 to 955 bp. The ISR sequence data characteristically indicate that the three corresponding ISRs (A,
B, and C) were identified to be identical to each other
(UK-1 and UK-2 isolates). In addition, the ISR sequences
shared nucleotide sequence similarities of approximately
95.3–98.9% between UCD-1T and UK-1/UK-2 isolates,
respectively.
In addition, as shown in Figure 1, a dendrogram constructed, based on the nucleotide sequence information of
the ISRs, demonstrated that T. asinigenitalis isolates
formed a major cluster separating from T. equigenitalis isolates (Fig. 1). Thus, nucleotide sequence divergence with
16S-23S rDNA ISR for T. asinigenitalis could be useful to
discriminate among the isolates and between species
within the genus Taylorella.
A typical order of intercistronic tRNA genes with 44
through 51 nucleotide spacers of 5'-16S rDNA-tRNAIle
(nucleotide position 202–278 of the ISR-A of UCD-1T) tRNAAla (nucleotide position 325–399 of the ISR-A of
UCD-1T) -23S rDNA-3' was identified in all three kinds of
ISRs from the three T. asinigenitalis isolates. Figure 2
clearly demonstrates, that both genes for tRNAIle and
tRNAAla were almost identical among the ISRs from T.
asinigenitalis, as well as T. equigenitalis (Fig. 2). The consen-

Consequently, in the present study, it was demonstrated
that three isolates of T. asinigenitalis possess three kinds of
ISRs with different length, respectively. Thus, the present
results may possibly indicate that T. asinigenitalis isolates
carry at least three distinctly different ribosomal RNA
operons in the genome.
Jang et al. (2001) previously demonstrated that pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles after digestion
with Not I of the genomic DNAs from the two isolates
(UK-1 and UK-2) of T. asinigenitalis were the same, but
they differed from the other isolate (UCD-1T) [6]. The
present sequencing results of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR (A, B
and C) clearly identified that the three ISRs were quite
identical to each other [UK-1 and UK-2], but they were
different from those of the UCD-1T, respectively. Thus,
our present sequence informations of the ISRs are consistent with the result of PFGE analysis by Jang et al. (2001)
[6]. The two isolates (UK-1 and UK-2) of T. asinigenitalis
obtained from donkey jacks in Kentucky, USA, in 1998 [6]
gave the quite identical profiles of the PFGE and the 16S23S rDNA ISR sequences. Therefore, these two isolates
may possibly be identical.
Overall, this study is the first report of 16S-23S rDNA ISR
sequences and tRNA genes from T. asinigenitalis. This is
also first molecular comparison of the ISRs from T. asinigenitalis with those from T. equigenitalis.
