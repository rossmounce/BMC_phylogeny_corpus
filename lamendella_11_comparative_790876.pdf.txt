functional capacity of the swine gut

Abstract
Background: Uncovering the taxonomic composition and functional capacity within the swine gut microbial
consortia is of great importance to animal physiology and health as well as to food and water safety due to the
presence of human pathogens in pig feces. Nonetheless, limited information on the functional diversity of the
swine gut microbiome is available.
Results: Analysis of 637, 722 pyrosequencing reads (130 megabases) generated from Yorkshire pig fecal DNA
extracts was performed to help better understand the microbial diversity and largely unknown functional capacity
of the swine gut microbiome. Swine fecal metagenomic sequences were annotated using both MG-RAST and JGI
IMG/M-ER pipelines. Taxonomic analysis of metagenomic reads indicated that swine fecal microbiomes were
dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. At a finer phylogenetic resolution, Prevotella spp. dominated the
swine fecal metagenome, while some genes associated with Treponema and Anareovibrio species were found to be
exclusively within the pig fecal metagenomic sequences analyzed. Functional analysis revealed that carbohydrate
metabolism was the most abundant SEED subsystem, representing 13% of the swine metagenome. Genes
associated with stress, virulence, cell wall and cell capsule were also abundant. Virulence factors associated with
antibiotic resistance genes with highest sequence homology to genes in Bacteroidetes, Clostridia, and
Methanosarcina were numerous within the gene families unique to the swine fecal metagenomes. Other abundant
proteins unique to the distal swine gut shared high sequence homology to putative carbohydrate membrane
transporters.
Conclusions: The results from this metagenomic survey demonstrated the presence of genes associated with
resistance to antibiotics and carbohydrate metabolism suggesting that the swine gut microbiome may be shaped
by husbandry practices.

Background
The animal gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex
microbial network and its composition reflects the constant co-evolution of these microorganisms with their
host environment [1]. Uncovering the taxonomic composition and functional capacity within the animal gut
microbial consortia is of great importance to understanding the roles they play in the host physiology and
health. Since animal feces can harbor human pathogens,
understanding the genetic composition of fecal microbial communities also has important implications for
food and water safety. The structure and function of the

gut microbial community has received significant attention for decades, although most of the work was
restricted by the use of culture-based techniques.
Recently, sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene has
shed new light on the diversity and composition of
microbial communities within several animal gut systems [2]. While 16S rRNA gene-based techniques have
revealed impressive microbial diversity within gut environments, this approach offers only limited information
on the physiological role of microbial consortia within a
given gut environment.
Random sequencing of metagenomes has allowed
scientists to reveal significant differences in metabolic
potential within different environments [3], including
microbial populations associated with host-microbial
partnerships. Specifically, the publicly available database

IMG/M [4] contains 596 Mb of sequencing data, representing 1,424, 000 genes from 17 different gut microbiomes. Studying gut metagenomes has particularly
helped in uncovering several important biological characteristics of these microbiomes. For example, when 13
human gut metagenomes were compared, Kurokawa et
al [5] found that adult and infant type gut microbiomes
have enriched gene families sharing little overlap, suggesting different core functions within the adult and
infantile gut microbiota. This study also demonstrated
the presence of hundreds of gene families exclusively
found in the adult human gut, suggesting various strategies are employed by each type of microbiota to adapt
to its intestinal environment [5]. Other gut microbiome
studies support these significant differences in core and
variable gene content from different animal hosts and
environments [1,6-12]. Thus, comparing the gene content of multiple gut microbiomes can help elucidate the
ecological underpinnings of gut systems.
Thus far, the functional genetic potential of the pig
distal gut microbiota has not been studied using metagenomics, although it is reasonable to assume that the
swine gut supports similar genetic complexity to the
human gut system, as they both prefer omnivorous
feeding behavior and harbor similar bacterial groups as
determined by several phylogenetic studies [13-15]. In
this study we used metagenomic data analyses to characterize the swine fecal microbiome with respect to
species composition and functional content. In order
to search for the potential presence of unique gene
functions harbored by the swine gut microbiome, we
performed a comparative metagenomic approach, in
the context of phylogenetic and functional
composition.

Results
Taxonomic distribution of swine fecal metagenomic
sequences

Approximately 130 Mb of swine fecal metagenome
sequence data were retrieved using two different pyrosequencing platforms (454 GS20 and FLX), making this
study the first metagenomic survey of the swine gut
(Table 1). The average read length for the GS20 and
FLX runs were 156 bp and 230 bp, respectively. Taxonomic distribution of 16S rRNA gene sequences from
the GS20 and FLX swine fecal metagenomes revealed
similar taxonomic distributions (Figure 1). However,
some differences in classification of 16S rRNA genes
retrieved from the GS20 and FLX runs were noted.
Most interestingly, fewer Firmicutes and more Bacteroidetes were classified using the FLX 16S rRNA genes
(using both RDP and Greengenes databases). This finding suggests shorter read lengths may lead to misclassification of these two divergent phyla. Additionally, more

unclassified sequences were retrieved from GS20 metagenomic reads with e-values less than 0.01.
Both GS20 and FLX metagenomic swine fecal datasets
were dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla
(Figure 1), which is consistent with several molecular
phylogenetic studies of mammalian gut environments,
including the swine gut [2,8,10,14]. Archaeal sequences
constituted less than 1% of total rRNA gene sequences
retrieved in either swine metagenome, and were dominated by the Methanomicrobia and Thermococci, which
is consistent with previous molecular diversity studies of
pig manure [16]. While these populations are only a
very small fraction of the total microbiota [17], methanogens contribute significantly to the metabolic potential within in a gut environment [18]. The majority of
eukaryotic sequences derived from the swine metagenomes are related to Chordata (i.e., host phylum), fungi,
and the Viridiplantae (i.e., feed). Sequences sharing high
sequence homology to Balantidium coli were obtained
in both swine metagenomes. The latter is a protozoan
pathogen that causes balantadiasis in mammalian hosts,
including human and swine. Since the samples were collected from healthy animals, these sequences might be
associated with non-pathogenic B. coli strains or with
pathogenic strains in asymptomatic animals. Viral
sequences were rare, comprising less than 1% of the
total metagenomic sequences when compared to the
SEED database (Additional File 1, Fig. S1). The low
abundance of viral sequences retrieved from the swine
fecal metagenomes is consistent with viral proportions
retrieved in termite, chicken, and cattle gastrointestinal
metagenomes, and may be a direct result of limited
representation of viral genetic information in currently
available databases [8].
A closer look at the taxonomic distribution of the
numerically abundant bacterial orders derived from the
swine metagenomes revealed that Clostridiales, unclassified Firmicutes, Bacteroidales, Spirochaetales, unclassified gammaproteobacteria, and Lactobacillales were the
top six most abundant bacterial groups (Additional File
1, Fig. S2). At the genus-level taxonomic resolution, Prevotella species were the most abundant, comprising 1922% of 16S rRNA gene sequences within both swine
fecal metagenomes (Additional File 1, Fig. S3). Of the
classified Clostridiales, Sporobacter was the next most
abundant genus within both the swine fecal metagenomic datasets. Anaerovibro, Clostridium, and Streptococcus genera encompassed at least 5% of rRNA gene
sequences in either the GS20 or FLX datasets.

metagenomic datasets to reveal phylotype differences
between mammalian, avian, and invertebrate distal gut
microbiomes. The distribution of bacterial phyla from
swine feces appeared closest to that of the cow rumen
and chicken cecum, sharing more similar proportions of
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria (Figure 2). A statistical analysis comparing bacterial distribution between hosts revealed several
significantly different bacterial groups. (Additional File
2, Table S1 and S2). Human adult and infant distal gut
microbiomes had significantly higher abundances of
Actinobacteria (p < 0.05) than did the swine microbiome (Additional File 2, Table S2). The fish gut microbiome was comprised mostly of Proteobacteria and
Firmicutes, while the termite gut was dominated by
Spirochetes. Interestingly, the swine fecal metagenome
also harbored significantly more Spirochetes than many
other hosts. (Additional File 2, Table S3).
Among the Bacteroidetes, Prevotella were significantly
more abundant in the swine fecal metagenome when
compared to all other gut metagenomes (p < 0.05), with
the exception of the cow rumen, while Bacteroides species were more abundant in chicken and human distal
gut microbiomes (Figure 3). Additionally, Anaerovibrio
and Treponema genera were exclusively found within
the pig fecal metagenomes. Hierarchical clustering of

phylotype distribution (genus-level) from each gut
microbiome revealed that community structure of the
swine fecal microbiome was significantly different (p <
0.05) from the other gut microbiomes (Figure 4A). Of
all the microbiomes used in the comparative analysis,
the swine metagenomes exhibited the highest resemblance to the cow rumen, displaying 59% similarity at
the genus level. Surprisingly, swine fecal community
structure (genus-level) was less than 40% similar to any
of the human fecal microbiomes used in this study.
Diversity of swine gut microbiome

In order to assess diversity of each gut metagenome,
several statistical models were applied for measuring
genotype richness, evenness, and coverage of rRNA gene
hits against the RDP database. Overall, while coverage of
the GS20 pig fecal metagenome was slightly lower than
the FLX run (91% vs 97%), all diversity indices showed
that both swine metagenomes had similar genotype
diversity (Table 2). Swine fecal microbiomes appeared to
have higher richness and lower evenness as compared to
chicken, mouse, fish, and termite gut communities.
This trend was further supported by a cumulative kdominance plot, as both swine k-dominance curves are
less elevated than all other gut microbiomes (Additional
File 1, Fig. S4). Rarefaction of the observed number of

Figure 1 Taxonomic composition of bacterial phyla using 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from GS20 and FLX swine fecal
metagenomes. Using the âPhylogenetic Analysisâ tool within MG-RAST, the GS20 and FLX sequencing runs were searched against the RDP and
greengenes databases using the BLASTn algorithm. The percent of sequences assigned to each of the bacterial phyla from the pig fecal GS20 (A
and B) and FLX (C and D) metagenomes is shown. The e-value cutoff for 16S rRNA gene hits to RDP and greengenes databases was 1Ã10-5 with
a minimum alignment length of 50 bp.

OTUs (genus-level) indicated several of the individual
human microbiomes were under-sampled (Additional
File 1, Fig. S5), thus, we combined individual pig fecal,
human infant, and human adult rRNA gene hits, and
also performed diversity analyses on the total number of
rRNA gene hits (Table 2). While the number of rRNA
gene sequences in metagenome projects is low, comparison between available metagenomes showed that the
human adult and pig microbiomes shared similar diversity patterns, and were more diverse than human infant
microbiota.
Functional classification of the swine gut metagenome

To predict the metabolic potential within the swine fecal
microbiome, both the MG-RAST and the IMG/M-ER
annotation pipelines were used. The broad functional
classifications of the swine fecal metagenomic reads

were expected from previous metagenomic studies of
the chicken cecum, cow rumen, human distal gut, and
the termite gut. Similar proportions of broad level SEED
subsystem classification were retrieved for both the
GS20 and FLX swine fecal metagenomes (Additional
File 1, Fig. S6). However, only 10% of sequences
retrieved from the GS20 pig fecal metagenome were
assigned to 574 subsystems, while more than 25% of all
FLX reads were classified into 714 subsystems. This is
compatible with the longer reads produced by the latter
instrument, which allows for more robust gene predictions. When both pig fecal metagenomes were annotated using proxygenes within the JGI IMG/M ER
pipeline, nearly one third of all GS20 and FLX pig fecal
metagenomes were assigned to Pfams, and over 20%
were assigned to COGs. This finding suggests that the

using the âMetabolic Analysisâ tool within MG-RAST. The e-value cutoff for metagenomic sequence matches to this SEED Subsystem was 1Ã10-5
with a minimum alignment length of 30 bp. Resemblance matrices were calculated using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities within PRIMER v6 software
[38]. Clustering was performed using the complete linkage algorithm. Dotted branches denote that no statistical difference in similarity profiles

metagenomic studies is more robust than the direct
BLASTx assignment strategy. Diversity analyses of Subsystems, COGs, and Pfams retrieved from swine metagenomes and other gut metagenomes tested in this
study, revealed that larger sequencing efforts generate
significantly more functional classes (Additional File 2,
Tables S4 & S5). For example, an additional 150 Subsystems, 896 COGs, and 1271 Pfams were retrieved from
the FLX run as compared to the GS20 metagenome,
suggesting additional sequencing efforts for all gut

microbiomes are necessary to cover the high functional
diversity in gut environments.
Carbohydrate metabolism was the most abundant
SEED subsystem (MG-RAST annotation pipeline)
representing 13% of both swine fecal metagenomes
(Additional File 1, Fig. S6). Genes associated with cell
wall and capsule, stress, and virulence were also very
abundant in both metagenomes. Approximately 16%
of annotated reads from swine fecal metagenomes
were categorized within the clustering-based

subsystems, most of which have unknown or putative
functions. Additionally, 75% to 90% of metagenomic
reads were not assigned to subsystems, suggesting
the need for improved binning and coding region
prediction algorithms to annotate these unknown
sequences.
To improve the meaning of metagenomic functional
analysis, we applied statistical methods to compare the

less represented in the different microbiomes. As was
expected, all gut metagenomes were dominated by carbohydrate metabolism subsystems with amino acid, protein, cell wall and capsule, and virulence subsystems
represented in relatively high abundance as well. Protein
metabolism and amino acid subsystems were significantly more abundant in chicken, pig, and cow gut
metagenomes (Additional File 1, Fig. S7). Additionally,
the termite, fish, and pig gut had a higher proportion of

reads classified to the chemotaxis and motility subsystems as compared to other gut metagenomes.
Comparative gut metagenomics

In this study, we examined the functional similarity of
the Yorkshire pig fecal metagenome by comparing it to
currently available metagenomic projects. Hierarchical
clustering of functional profiles derived from gut metagenomes available in the MG-RAST database revealed
that the GS20 and FLX swine fecal datasets shared
approximately 70% similarity to other human metagenomes (Figure 4B). This analysis also showed the swine
gut metagenome clustered more closely with chicken
cecal and cow rumen metagenomes than to the human
gut metagenomes (Figure 4B).
We further investigated subsystems associated with
specialized cell wall and capsule enzymes, DNA recombination, and prophage genes since they were very abundant in the swine fecal metagenome (Additional File 1,
Fig. S8). Within the DNA recombination and prophage
subsystem, the swine fecal metagenome was enriched
for RstA phage-related replication proteins, terminases,
and portal proteins. Additionally, more than 30 metagenomic contigs (i.e., > 500 bp) shared high homology to
unknown phage proteins. For proteins involved in the
cell wall and capsule subsystem, unknown glycosyl
transferases, a phosphoglucosamine mutase, and a phosphotransferase were over abundant in the swine metagenome (Table 3). N-acetyl glucosamine-specific PTS
system, proteins involved in mannose uptake, and novel
capsular polysaccharide synthesis enzymes were exclusively found within the swine fecal metagenome. Hierarchical clustering of all genes retrieved from the cell

wall and capsule functional subsystem for each gut
microbiome revealed that swine fecal cell wall/capsule
profiles were greater than 60% similar to those of the
cow rumen. Additionally, cell wall and capsule profiles
in the swine samples were more similar to termite gut
than the human gut (Additional File 1, Fig. S9). When
carbohydrate subsystems were compared across gut
microbiomes, maltose and maltodextrin utilization were
the most abundant carbohydrate subsystem in the
swine, termite, and cow rumen. Analysis of carbohydrate
metabolism using the SEED subsystem approach,
revealed several proteins unique to the swine gut metagenome such as an outer surface protein part of the cellobiose operon, a beta-glucoside-specific IIA component
and a cellobiose-specific IIC component of the PTS system, and a protein similar CDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase.
Two-way hierarchical clustering of COGs retrieved
from swine, human, termite, and mouse gut microbiomes revealed several suites of gene families unique to
the swine distal gut (Figure 5). Additionally, the swine
fecal FLX run yielded a pool COGs unique to the FLX
run, suggesting the deeper level of sequencing uncovered a larger proportion of functional diversity. Interestingly, this analysis unveiled a large collection of COGs
unique to the swine fecal metagenome.

Discussion
The primary goal of this study was to characterize the
functional content of the swine fecal microbiome. We
also compared the pig distal gut samples to other currently available gut metagenomes, as a method for
revealing potential differences in gut microbial systems.

Figure 5 Two-way hierarchical clustering of functional gene groups from swine and other currently available gut metagenomes
within JGIâs IMG/M database. Hierarchical clustering was performed using a matrix of the number of reads assigned to COGs from each gut
metagenome, which was generated using the âCompare Genomesâ tool in IMG/M ER. COGs less abundant in a given metagenome are shown in
black/darkgreen, while more abundant COGs are shown in red.

study identified unique and/or overabundant taxonomic
and functional elements within the swine distal gut. It
also appears that the genes associated with the variable
portion of gut microbiomes cluster by host environment
with surprising hierarchical trends. Thus, our findings
suggest that while a majority of metagenomic reads
were associated with a relatively conserved core microbiome, the variable microbiome carries out many unique
functions [8]. The data also suggest that taxonomically
diverse gut organisms maintain a conserved core set of
genes, although it should be noted that the variable
microbiome is more abundant than previously anticipated. For example, of the 160 functional SEED Subsystems, DNA repair/recombination subsystems were
amongst the most abundant functions within all gut
microbiomes. Since the frequency of a gene encoding a
particular metabolic function is usually related to its
relative importance in an environment [8], transferable

elements are likely to be very important in shaping
microbiome composition and diversity in gastrointestinal environments. When comparing prophage and
transposon genes from each gut microbiome, the pig
distal microbiome examined in this study harbored an
abundant and diverse array of horizontal gene transfer
mechanisms. When putative transposases for all available gut metagenomes were retrieved using the IMG/M
annotation pipeline, the swine fecal metagenome harbored the most diverse transposase profiles (i.e., 26 different transposase families; Additional File 1, Fig. S10).
The potential importance of transposable elements was
further supported by the fact that 42% of large contigs
(> 500 bp) assembled from all pig fecal metagenomic
contained sequences that matched putative transposases
(Table 4). Additionally, 24% of all large contigs matched
to proteins associated with antibiotic resistance mechanisms. These results suggest that lateral gene transfer and

mobile elements allow gut microbial populations to perpetually change their cell surface for sensing their environment and collecting nutrient resources present in the
distal intestine [2].
Interestingly, a majority of these transposable elements
belonged to the Bacteroidetes genomes. These genetic
elements have been shown to aid in the adaptation of
this diverse group of bacteria to the distal gut environments [2]. Many of the genetic features unique to the
swine fecal metagenome encoded cell surface features of
different Bacteroidetes populations, suggesting the adaptation of Bacteroidetes populations to distinct niches
within the swine distal gut microbiome. While the precise role of diet, antibiotic usage, and genetics on shaping the ecology of the distal pig gut will require further
study, it should be noted that industrialization of the
swine industry has lead to the frequent use antibiotics
to supplement the pig diet to maintain and increase
meat production.
Studying the swine distal gut metagenome also shed
light on the diversity and high occurrence of antibiotic
resistance mechanisms employed by the microbiome
(Additional File 1, Fig. S11). Antibiotics are widely used
as additives in food or water within swine feeding operations to prevent and treat animal disease and to promote animal growth [19]. Seepage and runoff of swine
waste into both surface and groundwater with antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant
threat to public health. Nearly 6% of all assigned metagenomic reads retrieved from both swine fecal metagenomes were involved in antibiotic resistance mechanisms.
Interestingly, tetracycline resistance was the most abundant class of virulence subsystems within the swine fecal
metagenome, which may be explained by the fact that
this antibiotic class was used in the diet supplied to the
animals associated with this study. This antibiotic class
is reported as comprising nearly half of the total amount
of antibiotics used in commercial swine operations [20].
Resistance to fluoroquinolones was also well represented in the swine fecal metagenome, and may be
explained by the increase of its non-therapeutic use
within pig feed. While early studies indicated there was
a low risk of fluoroquinolone resistance, recent studies
are showing the use of fluoroquinolones is among the
most important factors associated with finding resistant
E. coli and Campylobacter in animal operations [21].
Interestingly, there was no history of fluoroquinolone
use on the swine farm from which these samples were
collected. Fluoroquinolone resistance has been found on
farms with no history of fluoroquinolone use, suggesting
that resistant organisms, such as Campylobacter have
the ability to spread between pig farms. Genes with high
sequence similarity to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus subsystem were also retrieved in this study. This

Page 11 of 17

finding is important considering MRSA carriage has
been elevated in swine and exposed farmers and veterinarians [22], suggesting that MRSA infection is a significant risk in swine farm resident and worker cohorts.
More than 12% of virulence subsystems identified in
the pig fecal metagenome were classified as multi-drug
resistance mechanisms, suggesting the pig gut could be
a hot-spot for multiple-antibiotic resistant bacteria. One
subsystem, the MexA-MexB-OprM multiple drug efflux
pump was found exclusively in the swine fecal metagenome. This antibiotic resistance mechanism has been
detected only in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains known
to carry resistance in cystic fibrosis patients [23] and
has not been previously described in distal gut environments. Additionally, more than 10% of virulence-associated sequences were assigned to yet-to-be-described
virulence subsystems, suggesting that unknown virulence mechanisms are at work within the distal gut.
Altogether, the high abundance of metagenomic
sequences assigned to known and unknown antibiotic
resistance subsystems suggests that functional metagenomics is an adequate tool for assessing the prevalence
of antibiotic resistance within high cell density
environments.
Pair-wise comparisons of each gut metagenome (MGRAST SEED database) with the swine gut revealed 15
SEED subsystems that were significantly different in
abundance for the swine fecal metagenome (Figure 6
and Additional File 1, Fig. S12). Two subsystems in particular were statistically significantly overabundant in
the swine gut metagenome, as compared to all other gut
metagenomes: the UDP-N-acetylmuramate from fructose-6-phosphate biosynthesis and folate biosynthesis.
UDP-N-acetylmuramate is a peptidoglycan-derived muropeptide that as a group are considered to be potential
virulence factors of several gut pathogens [24] specifically involved in biofilm colonization. Higher abundances of genes related to folate biosynthesis may be a
direct result of supplemental amounts of folic acid in
swine feedstuff or an increased production by the swine
microbial consortia [25]. The impacts of food additives,
such as folic acid, on the microbial ecology of the swine
gut warrants further study.
Comparative metagenomics of proteins involved in the
cell wall and capsule subsystems revealed several unique
glycosyl transferases and carbohydrate uptake systems.
This unique pool of glycosyl transferases may provide a
capacity for diversification of surface polysaccharide
structures helping shape the genetic functional potential
of this gut ecosystem. For example, the acquisition of
new types of carbohydrate-binding proteins, transporters, and degradation enzymes through horizontal gene
transfer may allow for the utilization of a wider array of
substrates that may be utilized for energy harvesting [2].

calculated for the pig fecal metagenome versus (A) lean mouse cecum (B) cow rumen (C) human adult (D) termite gut (E) human infant (F) fish
gut (G) and chicken cecal metagenomes is shown. Each point on this exploratory plot represents a different SEED Subsystem and itâs relative
abundance within the pig fecal metagenome compared to other available gut metagenomes within the MG-RAST database. Points closer to yaxis represent functions more abundant in the swine gut metagenome, while points closer to the x-axis are more abundant in other gut
metagenomes. Points laying on or near the dotted midline have equal or very similar abundances within both metagenomes. A matrix of the
abundance of sequences assigned to each SEED Subsystem from each gut metagenome was generated using the âMetabolic Analysisâ tool in
MG-RAST. The number of reads from each individual pig, human infant, and human adult metagenomes were each combined since there was
more than one metagenome for each of these hosts within the MG-RAST database. The e-value cutoff for metagenomic sequence matches to
SEED Subsystems was 1Ã10-5 with a minimum alignment length of 30 bp. Fisher exact tests were used with the Benjamin-Hochberg FDR
multiple test correction to generate a list of significantly different SEED Subsystems using STAMP v1.0.2 software [39]. The Newcombe-Wilson
method was used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals.

Pfams and COGs related to virulence factors such as
adhesions were numerous within the gene families
unique to the swine fecal metagenomes (Additional File
2, Table S6). Proteins involved in carbohydrate transport
and attachment were both abundant and unique to the
distal swine gut with more than 50 metagenomic contigs
sharing high sequence homology to putative carbohydrate membrane transporters. Other proteins involved
in carbohydrate metabolism were unique to the swine
metagenome including glycosyl hydrolases, cellobiohydrolases, gluconolactonases, maltodextrin metabolism,
and pectin lyases. The identification of unique gene
families provides one line of evidence that the variable
microbiome is a result of the microbial interaction with
its surrounding environment. Because the environment
surrounding gut microbes can vary among host species,
a direct result of this level of functional diversity may be
the generation of swine-specific microbiomes. Many
proteins of unknown functions were also unique to the
swine fecal metagenome, suggesting that some of them

may be engaged in novel functions that have important
biological meaning.
The high functional similarity between the pig and
human metagenome is not surprising in light of the fact
that they are mammalian omnivores with similar digestive tract structures and functions. Results from 16S
rRNA gene sequence analyses suggest that bacterial gut
communities are similar among omnivorous mammals
[2]. Similarities at the phylogenetic level between pig
and human guts include the large presence of Firmicutes and members of the Bacteroidetes as the most
abundant Gram-negative bacteria in their gastrointestinal tracts [14]. While differences in the relative abundance of Lactobacilli phylotypes have been noted, our
data provides for the first time a functional perspective
on how similar pigs and humans gut systems in spite of
the differences in microbial community structure. In
contrast, the functional similarities shared between the
swine fecal metagenome and the termite gut was surprising and suggestive of previously unknown shared

Lamendella et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:103
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/103

metabolic capabilities between these gut environments.
For example, the pig and termite were the only two
hosts possessing a suite of functions involved in archaeal
lipid biosynthesis (Additional File 2, Fig. S13), suggesting
an intimate relationship between the swine and archaeal
gut populations [26]. Swine-specific methanogenic populations have been demonstrated in previous studies
[17,27]. Similarities in cell wall and capsule profiles
between the swine samples and termite gut may indicate
that these functions can endow the swine gut with
diversification of surface polysaccharide structures,
allowing the host immune system to accommodate a
diverse microbiota [2]. Presence of novel carbohydrate
binding proteins and transporters also suggest the swine
gut is capable of exploiting a diverse array of substrates.
Similarities in functional gene profiles (SEED subsystem abundance) among swine, chicken cecal and cow
rumen metagenomes as compared to human gut metagenomes were unexpected considering the similarity
shared between pig and human gut anatomy and physiology. These results suggest that that some microbial
functions within the swine gut are shared among other
agricultural animals, with arguably very different gastrointestinal anatomy and physiologies. For example, the
elevated abundance of genes associated with protein
turnover in pigs, chicken, and cow gut metagenomes is
consistent with an increased use of amino acids for protein accretion in food production animals and is also
consistent with the high protein diet fed to the pigs in
this study. Additionally, the high abundance and diversity of carbohydrate utilization subsystems found in this
swine metagenome may be a result of the high level of
complex polysaccharides found in the diet. Altogether
these data suggest that agricultural animal husbandry
practices can impose significant selective pressures on
the gut microbiota, regardless of gut type.
Surprisingly, this pig fecal metagenome revealed the presence of motile Treponema and Anaerovibrio genera. The
presence of sequences associated with Treponema in this
study (i.e., 3-4% of all sequences swine fecal metagenome)
suggests an order of magnitude higher abundance than a
previous study in which swine gut microbiota revealed a
very low abundance of Spirochetes using a culture independent method (i.e., 0.3% of all phylotypes) [14]. This
genus has been previously detected in swine colonic samples but their presence in elevated levels is normally associated with swine dysentery. Discrepancies in community
composition between cloning-based methods and noncloning based methods have been reported in the literature, primarily attributed to PCR amplification biases
[28,29]. While many mammalian gut microbial communities are dominated by non-motile microbes, the termite
hindgut and the fish gut harbor motile populations of bacteria, which are known to possess complex social

behaviors [12,30,31]. This study revealed the pig gut may
harbor previously unknown social dynamics, which may
be relevant for maintaining compartmentalization and
promoting niche selection within monogastric systems.

Conclusions
Herein, we report the first shotgun metagenomic pyrosequencing approach to study the microbiome of the swine
distal gut. The overall goal of this study was to characterize the swine fecal microbiome with respect to species
composition and functional content. Comparative metagenomic analyses identified unique and/or overabundant
taxonomic and functional elements within swine distal gut
microbiomes. These genetic attributes may help us better
understand the microbial genetic factors that are relevant
to swine health. Genes associated with the variable portion
of gut microbiomes clustered by host environment with
surprising hierarchical trends, suggesting that the variable
microbiome content of a given host species may be reflective of the host ecology. While a larger metagenomic database that includes information on intra-host variation is
needed for swine and other gut systems, this study provides a baseline for understanding the complexity of the
swine gut microbial ecology, while also highlighting striking similarities and differences when compared to other
animal gastrointestinal environments.
Methods
Fecal Sample Collection

Fecal samples were collected from eight, six-month old
Yorkshire pigs from a large swine operation located in
Northeastern Ohio, which housed more than 1,000 head
of swine at the time of collection. Swine were weaned
eight weeks after birth. Their diets consisted of a highenergy corn-soybean meal diet containing 14.00% crude
protein, 0.63% lysine, 3.00% crude fat, 4.00% crude fiber,
0.55%- 0.70% calcium, 0.52% phosphorus, 0.35%-0.50%
salt, 0.3 ppm selenium, 80 ppm zinc. (Kalmbach Feeds,
OH). In addition, swine were supplemented with feed
grade antibiotics for improvement in growth performance. Antibiotics consisted of chlortetracycline and
penicillin at the concentration of 20 g per ton of feed.
Fecal samples were transported to the laboratory on ice
within four hours of collection, and stored at -20Â°C until
further processing. Fecal DNA was extracted with the
FastDNA SPIN Kit (MP Biomedicals, Inc., Solon, OH)
according to the manufacturerâs instructions using 0.25
g of each fecal sample. Total DNA was quantified using
a NanoDropÂ® ND-1000 UV spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).
Pyrosequencing and Gene Annotation

A total of 24 Î¼g (3 Î¼g of each fecal DNA extract, n = 8)
were pooled and sent for pyrosequencing to 454 Life

Sciences, where two different sequencing runs were performed. The first run was performed using Genome
Sequencer GS20 platform while the Genome Sequencer
FLX instrument was used for the second run. Each pig
fecal metagenomic sequencing run was assembled de
novo using the Newbler assembly software by 454 Life
Sciences. The metagenomes used in this paper are freely
available from the SEED, JGIâs IMG/M, and NCBI Short
Read Archive. The NCBI genome project ID and GOLD
ID for swine fecal GS20 and FLX metagenomic sequencing runs generated in this project are 39267 and
Gm00197, respectively.
Raw sequencing reads from both datasets were submitted to the Joint Genome Instituteâs IMG/M-ER
annotation pipeline using the proxygene method for
gene annotation [4,32]. Additionally, both metagenome
runs were annotated using the âPhylogenetic Analysisâ
tool within the MG-RAST pipeline [33]. The BLASTn
algorithm (e-value less than1 Ã 10 -5 and a sequence
match length greater than 50 nucleotides) was used to
identify small subunit rRNA genes from RDP [34],
SILVA SSU [35], and Greengenes databases [36]. Within
the MG-RAST pipeline, the âMetabolic Analysisâ tool
was used to search sequences from pig fecal metagenomes against the SEED database using the BLASTx
algorithm (e-value less than 1Ã10 -5 and a sequence
match length greater than 30 nucleotides) [37].
Comparative Metagenomics and Statistical Analyses

Comparative metagenomics was performed using both
the IMG/M and MG-RAST pipelines. GS20 and FLX
pig metagenomic runs were compared to the current
publicly available gut metagenomes within each of these
databases. Within the IMG/M pipeline, the two pig
metagenomic runs were compared against three lean
mouse (Mus musculus strain C57BL/6J) cecal metagenomes (Metagenome names: Mouse Gut Community
lean1-3), two healthy human fecal metagenomes (Metagenome names: Human Gut Community Subject 7-8),
and one termite (Nasutitermes sp) hindgut metagenome
(Metagenome name: Termite hindgut). Descriptive
information about these mouse, human and termite
metagenomes can be found in the GOLD database
under Gm00071, Gm00052, Gm00013 GOLD IDs,
respectively. Within IMG/M the âCompare Genomesâ
tool was chosen to extract COG and Pfam protein profiles from the swine, mouse, human, and termite gut
microbiomes. These profiles were then normalized for
sequencing coverage by calculating the percent distribution, prior to downstream statistical analysis. To find
over-abundant or unique functions to a given metagenomic dataset, a two-way hierarchical clustering of normalized COG and Pfam abundances was performed
using the Bioinformatics Toolbox with Matlab version

Page 14 of 17

2009a. Additionally, to determine if unique or overabundant functions were statistically meaningful, the binomial test within the Shotgun FunctionalizeR program
was employed [38].
The GS20 and FLX pig fecal datasets were also compared against gut metagenomes available within the
MG-RAST metagenomic annotation pipeline. The two
pig fecal metagnonomic datasets were compared against
the following MG-RAST metagenomic projects: cow
rumen (Cow Rumen Project: 444168.3), chicken cecum
(FS-CAP Project:4440285.3), human infant subjects InA, In-B, In-D, In-E, In-M and In-R (Human Faeces Projects: 4440946.3, 4440945.3, 4440948.3, 4440950.3,
4440949.3, 4440951.3), human adult subjects F1-S, F1-T,
F1-U, F2-V, F2-W, F2-X, and F2-Y (Human Faeces Projects: 4440939.9, 4440941.3, 4440940.3, 4440942.3,
4440943.3, 4440944.3, and 4440947.3), healthy fish gut
(Fish Gut Project: 4441695.3), and lean mouse cecum
(Human Faeces Project: 4440463.3). Within MG-RAST,
phylogenetic information was extracted from these gut
metagenomes using RDP [31], SILVA SSU [32], and
Greengenes[33] databases (e-value less than 1 Ã 10 -5
and a sequence match length greater than 50 nucleotides). These taxonomic profiles were then normalized
for differences in sequencing coverage by calculating
percent distribution, prior to downstream statistical analysis. A non-parametric Wilcoxon exact test was used to
statistically compare the taxonomic composition in any
two metagenomes.
Additionally, within MG-RAST, the functional annotations (hits to SEED Subsystems) were extracted (e-value
less than 1 Ã 10-5 and a sequence match length greater
than 50 nucleotides) to compare functional attributes
across these gut metagenomes. In order to identify statistically significant and biologically meaningful differences between the swine gut and other endiobiotic
microbiomes, we employed the two-way Fisherâs exact
test with a Benjamin-Hochberg FDR multiple test correction within STAMP v1.0.2 [39].
Diversity Indices

Observed richness, Chao1 estimator, abundance-based
coverage estimator (ACE), jackknife estimator, and
bootstrap estimator were used to evaluate community
richness. Community diversity was described using
Shannon, non-parametric Shannon, and Simpson
indices within Mothur v 1.5.0 [40]. Sampling coverage
was calculated using Goodâs coverage for the given
operational taxonomic unit (OTU) definition, while the
Boneh estimate was used to calculate the number of
additional OTUs that would be observed for an additional 500 SSU reads. The aforementioned rRNA diversity indices and rarefaction curves were calculated
using Mothur v 1.5.0 program with default parameters

Lamendella et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:103
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/103

[40] and calculations for each index can found in
the Mothur manual (http://www.mothur.org/wiki/
Mothur_manual). Functional diversity was assessed
using SEED Subsystems [41], COG, and Pfam abundances from all available gut metagenomes. Diversity
estimators used included Shannon-Weiner, Simpsonâs
lambda, and Pielouâs evenness analyses for measuring
species richness and evenness. Functional diversity
estimates, K- dominance plots, Principal Components
Analysis, and clustering were performed using the PRIMER-E ecological software package [42].
