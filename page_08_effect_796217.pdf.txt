Abstract
Background: Thyroid hormones (TH) induce gene expression programs that orchestrate
amphibian metamorphosis. In contrast to anurans, many salamanders do not undergo
metamorphosis in nature. However, they can be induced to undergo metamorphosis via exposure
to thyroxine (T4). We induced metamorphosis in juvenile Mexican axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum)
using 5 and 50 nM T4, collected epidermal tissue from the head at four time points (Days 0, 2, 12,
28), and used microarray analysis to quantify mRNA abundances.
Results: Individuals reared in the higher T4 concentration initiated morphological and
transcriptional changes earlier and completed metamorphosis by Day 28. In contrast, initiation of
metamorphosis was delayed in the lower T4 concentration and none of the individuals completed
metamorphosis by Day 28. We identified 402 genes that were statistically differentially expressed
by ≥ two-fold between T4 treatments at one or more non-Day 0 sampling times. To complement
this analysis, we used linear and quadratic regression to identify 542 and 709 genes that were
differentially expressed by ≥ two-fold in the 5 and 50 nM T4 treatments, respectively.
Conclusion: We found that T4 concentration affected the timing of gene expression and the shape
of temporal gene expression profiles. However, essentially all of the identified genes were similarly
affected by 5 and 50 nM T4. We discuss genes and biological processes that appear to be common
to salamander and anuran metamorphosis, and also highlight clear transcriptional differences. Our
results show that gene expression in axolotls is diverse and precise, and that axolotls provide new
insights about amphibian metamorphosis.

Background
Amphibian metamorphosis is generally characterized by
dramatic and conspicuous developmental changes that

are necessary for larvae to function as terrestrial adults.
The morphological, behavioral, and physiological
changes that occur during metamorphosis are associated

with increases in thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3
and thyroxine, T4; TH) [1,2] and RNA synthesis [3]. These
events are interconnected; at metamorphosis, tissue-specific concentrations of TH activate and repress transcriptional networks within target cells that in turn regulate
new patterns of development [4]. Many genes that are
associated with molecular and morphological events during metamorphosis have been identified from studies of
anurans, and in particular Xenopus laevis. In contrast, little
is known about patterns of gene expression during salamander metamorphosis.

microarray experiment that induced metamorphosis
using a much lower concentration of T4 (5 nM). Using 5
and 50 nM T4 microarray datasets, we describe the temporal transcriptional response of T4 induced metamorphosis
and specifically address the following question: Does T4
concentration affect morphological metamorphosis and
gene expression in the axolotl? We discuss the biological
significance of some of the differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) that were identified and the relationship between
salamander and anuran metamorphic gene expression
programs.

Although anuran and salamander metamorphosis are regulated by many of the same endocrine factors, there is
considerable developmental variation between these
groups. Most conspicuously, some salamanders do not
undergo a complete metamorphosis in nature. These salamanders are called paedomorphs because they retain larval characteristics into the adult stage, and because genetic
and phylogenetic evidence suggests that they evolve from
metamorphic ancestors [5,6]. Paedomorphosis in the
Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is associated
with low hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) activity
and differential sensitivity of tissues to TH that results in
some cryptic biochemical and molecular changes, but not
the complete suite of morphological changes seen in
related, metamorphic tiger salamanders. Interestingly, A.
mexicanum can be induced to undergo anatomical metamorphosis by administering TH and endocrine factors
that function upstream of TH synthesis [7,8]. The axolotl
provides an excellent alternative to anuran systems
because metamorphosis can be precisely induced and
studied in juveniles or adults that are not developing
toward a metamorphic outcome.

Results

Functional genomic approaches are beginning to reshape
the way transcription is conceptualized during amphibian
metamorphosis [9-11]. The transcriptional program for
tissue regression, remodeling, and organogenesis is significantly more complicated than was initially predicted for
Xenopus [12-15]. Previously, we used microarray technology to identify keratin biomarkers for T4 induced metamorphosis in the integument (epidermis) of the Mexican
axolotl [11]. We showed that 50 nM T4 induces a complex
transcriptional program and axolotls complete metamorphosis with no mortality. Interestingly, this T4 concentration is known to affect gene expression and mortality in
anurans [16-18] and it is higher than T4 concentrations
estimated in the serum of spontaneously metamorphosing salamanders. For example, Larras-Regard et al. [2]
reported 28 nM as the maximum serum T4 level in
Ambystoma tigrinum, a close relative of the axolotl that typically undergoes metamorphosis. To further investigate
the effect of T4 concentration on induced metamorphosis
in the Mexican axolotl, we report the results of a second

Effect of T4 concentration on morphological
metamorphosis
During T4 induced metamorphosis, Mexican axolotls
progress through developmental stages (0–IV) [19] that
are defined by the resorption of the upper and lower tailfins, dorsal ridge, and gills. We staged all axolotls after 0,
2, 12, and 28 days of T4 treatment. No metamorphic
changes were observed after two days of T4 treatment and
thus axolotls from both T4 treatments were assigned to
Stage 0. At Day 12, morphological changes were observed
in 50 nM T4 treated axolotls (Stages I and II) but 5 nM T4
treated axolotls were indistinguishable from control animals (Stage 0). At Day 28, axolotls reared in 50 nM T4 had
fully resorbed tailfins and gills, and thus had completed
morphological metamorphosis (Stage IV). Between Days
12 and 28, 5 nM T4 treated axolotls initiated metamorphosis but did not complete all morphological changes by
Day 28 (Stage III). On average, individuals complete metamorphosis after 35 days in 5 nM T4 (unpublished data).
Thus, a low concentration of T4 delays the initiation timing of morphological metamorphosis but not the length
of the metamorphic period.
Gene expression in the absence of T4
Our first set of statistical analyses tested control axolotls
for temporal changes in mRNA abundance that were independent of T4 treatment [see Additional files 1, 2]. Temporal changes are expected if patterns of transcription (gene
expression) change significantly over time as salamanders
mature, or if there are uncontrolled sources of experimental variation. After adjusting the false discovery rate (FDR)
to 0.05, none of the probe-sets (genes) on the custom
Ambystoma GeneChip were identified as significantly differentially abundant as a function of time. Thus, we found
no statistical support for differential gene expression
among control animals.
Gene expression in the presence of T4: 5 versus 50 nM
At each of the times that we estimated mRNA abundances
during T4 induced metamorphosis, the number and diversity of genes that were differentially expressed between the
5 and 50 nM T4 treatments differed (Figure 1A) [see Addi-

tional files 3, 4]. A total of 402 DEGs that differed by ≥
two-fold at one or more of our sampling times were identified among all day by T4 treatment contrasts (Figure 1A)
[see Additional files 3, 4]. We identified 30 DEGs as early
as Day 2 (Table 1), and eighty percent of these DEGs were
up regulated in 50 nM T4 relative to 5 nM T4. This small
group of early response genes was statistically associated
with the amino acid transport and amine transport ontology terms. Additional gene functions of these early
responding genes include epithelial differentiation, ion
transport, RNA processing, signal transduction, and apoptosis/growth arrest. We note that no differentially
expressed transcription factors were identified as DEGs at
Day 2, and neither thyroid hormone receptor (TR; alpha
and beta) was identified as differentially expressed at any
time point in our study. At Day 12, when axolotls in 50
nM T4 were undergoing dramatic tissue resorption events
and axolotls in 5 nM T4 were indistinguishable from controls, we identified the greatest number of DEGs between
the T4 treatments (n = 319; Figure 1A). An approximately
equivalent number of up and down regulated DEGs were
identified [see Additional files 3, 4]. These genes were

enriched for functions associated with epidermis development, carbohydrate metabolism, ectoderm development,
response to chemical stimulus, negative regulation of cell
proliferation, response to abiotic stimulus, negative regulation of biological process, development, and organ
development. By Day 28, when axolotls in 50 nM T4 had
completed metamorphosis and axolotls in 5 nM T4 were
continuing to show morphological restructuring, we identified 216 DEGs that differed between the T4 treatments
(Figure 1A). Of the identified DEGs, 76% were down regulated in 50 nM T4 relative to 5 nM T4 [see Additional files
3, 4]. DEGs identified at Day 28 were associated with
response to pest, pathogen, or parasite, negative regulation of cellular process, positive regulation of physiological process, response to stress, response to stimulus,
transition metal ion transport, di-, tri-valent inorganic cation transport, response to other organism, immune
response, development, organismal physiological process, muscle contraction, response to biotic stimulus, and
response to bacteria. The functional categories that we
identified show that the axolotl epidermal transcriptional
response to T4 is complex, involving hundreds of DEGs.
To further explore the effect of T4 on gene expression and
morphological metamorphosis we conducted a principal
component analysis (PCA). This analysis shows that global gene expression and morphological metamorphosis
are strongly correlated, but there is little or no correlation
between gene expression and T4 treatment (Figure 2).
This suggests that after metamorphosis was initiated
within T4 treatments, molecular and morphological
events were coordinately regulated. T4 concentration
affected the onset timing of metamorphosis in axolotls,
but not the sequence of transcriptional and morphological events that define this process.
Modeling the transcriptional response of genes during
induced metamorphosis
To further investigate the effect of T4 concentration on
induced metamorphosis, we modeled mRNA abundance
estimates from the 5 and 50 nM T4 treatments using quadratic and linear regression. The regression analyses identified 542 and 709 DEGs that changed by ≥ two-fold
relative to Day 0 controls, in the 5 and 50 nM T4 treatments respectively [see Additional files 5, 6, 7, 8]. Given
our previous analyses, we expected to observe different
regression patterns (expression profiles; Figure 3) for
DEGs from each treatment because metamorphic initiation timing was delayed in 5 nM T4 and metamorphosis
was only completed in 50 nM T4. Indeed, most DEGs
identified by the 5 nM regression analysis exhibited linear
expression profiles during metamorphosis (e.g., linear
down, LD; linear up, LU; Figure 3) while the majority of
the DEGs identified by the 50 nM regression analysis
exhibited curvilinear and parabolic expression profiles

(e.g., quadratic linear convex down, QLVD; quadratic linear concave up QLCU; quadratic convex QV; quadratic
concave, QC; Figure 3; see the methods for a summary of
the biological interpretations of these expression profiles
in the context of our experiment). Thus, biological processes known to be fundamental to tissue remodeling and/
or development were identified from both T4 treatments,
however they were statistically associated with different
regression patterns (Figure 3). For example, four collagendegrading matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) genes
(MMP13, MMP9, MMP1) exhibited linear up regulated
responses in 5 nM T4 and were categorized as LU. However, under 50 nM T4, these genes were categorized among
the QC and QLCU profiles. Several genes associated with
organ development (transgelin, mitogen-activated protein
kinase 12, distal-less homeo box 3, actin binding lim protein 1,
collagen type VI alpha 3, and msh homeo box homolog 2) were
up regulated in a linear fashion in 50 nM T4 and were categorized as LU. In 5 nM T4, several of these genes (mitogenactivated protein kinase 12, actin binding lim protein 1, and
msh homeo box homolog 2) were statistically significantly up
regulated (LU and QLVU) but failed to eclipse our twofold change criteria. A single gene (collagen type VI alpha 3)
was not statistically significant and categorized as "Flat" in
5 nM T4. However, this gene did not appreciably deviate
from base-line expression levels until Day 28 in 50 nM T4
(Figure 4A). We attribute these differences between the
T4treatments to the delayed onset timing of metamorphosis in the 5 nM T4 treatment. Overall, the same generalized
direction of expression was observed for 457 of 463
(99%) DEGs that were commonly identified from both T4
treatments (Figure 1B). The six genes (calponin 2, ethyl-

that genes classified as QLCD trend upward at the early

4B). These results show that T4 concentration affected the
shape of temporal gene expression profiles but essentially
all epidermal DEGs that were identified in both T4 treatments were regulated in the same direction by 5 and 50
nM T4.
The regression analyses identified a number of DEGs that
only met both of our criteria (statistically significant and
≥ two-fold change) in one of the T4 concentrations (5 nM,
n = 79; 50 nM, n = 246; Figure 1B). Of the 79 genes unique
to 5 nM T4, 36 (46%) were statistically significant in 50
nM T4 but did not eclipse our two-fold change criteria. Of
the remaining 43 genes unique to 5 nM T4, 25 exhibited
≥ two-fold change in 50 nM T4 at one or more sampling
times but were not statistically significant. Inspection of
the 50 nM T4 regression patterns and fold change data
associated with the 79 genes unique to 5 nM T4 revealed
that all of these genes exhibited similar directional trends
(up versus down regulation) in 5 and 50 nM T4 [see Additional files 9, 10]. Of the 246 genes unique to 50 nM T4,
96 (39%) were statistically significant in 5 nM T4, but
failed to eclipse our two-fold change criteria. An additional 48 genes exhibited ≥ two-fold change for at least
one sampling time in 5 nM T4, but were not statistically
significant. Inspection of the 5 nM T4 regression patterns
and fold change data associated with the 246 genes
unique to 50 nM T4 demonstrated that 209 (85%) of
these genes exhibited similar directional trends in 5 and
50 nM T4 [see Additional files 11, 12]. An additional 22
genes unique to 50 nM T4 did not exhibit > 1.5 fold

changes relative to Day 0 controls until Day 28 (at which
time they were differentially regulated by ≥ two-fold), suggesting that they are expressed during the terminal stages
of metamorphosis [see Additional files 11, 12]. Presumably, these genes were not detected in 5 nM T4 because we
did not sample latter time points for this concentration.
These results reiterate the point that essentially all genes
identified by our study were similarly, directionally
expressed in the 5 and 50 nM T4 treatments.
To address similarity in terms of magnitude, we compared
maximum fold level values for genes that exhibited QLVD
and QLCU expression profiles in both T4 treatments (Figure 3; Table 2). We assumed that genes exhibiting these
profiles had achieved maximum/minimum mRNA levels
during the experiment, and thus could be reliably compared between treatments. No statistical differences were
observed for fold level values of 13 QLVD and QLCU
genes between the 5 and 50 nM T4 treatments (Wilcoxon
signed rank test, Z = -1.293, P = 0.1961) [20], and the fold
level values were highly correlated (Table 2; Spearman's
rho = 1.00, P < 0.0001) [20]. Although this analysis was
performed on a small subset of genes, the results suggest
that mRNA abundances are similar for genes that are differentially expressed in 5 and 50 nM T4.

Xenopus [10] to DEGs identified from our study of axolotl.
Of the 59 genes that were reported as differentially up regulated by ≥ 1.5 fold in limb, brain, tail, and intestine from
metamorphosing Xenopus, 23 (39%) are represented by at
least one of the 3688 probe-sets analyzed in our study. Of
these, only two (FK506 binding protein 2 and glutamatecysteine ligase modifier subunit) were identified as statistically significant and differentially expressed by ≥ two-fold
in our study [see Additional files 13, 14]. FK506 binding
protein 2 was up regulated in axolotl and Xenopus. However, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit was down
regulated in axolotl and up regulated in Xenopus. Thus, <
5% of the 'core' DEGs that are commonly expressed
among Xenopus tissues during metamorphosis, were identified as DEGs in our study using axolotl.
We also conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics comparison between DEGs from axolotl epidermis and DEGs
from T3 induced Xenopus intestine [10]. Gene expression
similarities may exist between the Xenopus intestine and
axolotl epidermis because both organs undergo extensive
extracellular remodeling that is associated with apoptosis
of larval epithelial cells and the proliferation and differentiation of adult cell types. The presumptive orthologs of
111 of the 820 non-redundant DEGs from our study correspond to DEGs from Xenopus intestine [see Additional
files 13, 14]. Of these 111 genes, 50 (45%) exhibited the
same direction of differential expression in axolotl epidermis and Xenopus intestine. This list includes genes that are
known to be associated with metamorphic developmental processes in amphibians. For example, two MMPs
(MMP9 and MMP13) that are associated with extra cellular matrix turnover were up regulated in Xenopus intestine
and axolotl epidermis. However, other genes were regu-

lated in opposite directions. For example, keratin 12 and
keratin 15 were down regulated in axolotl epidermis but
up regulated in Xenopus intestine. These results show that
there are similarities and differences in gene expression
between Xenopus and axolotls when comparing tissues
that undergo similar remodeling processes.
Biological, technical, and statistical replication
In order to validate a subset of genes that were identified
as DEGs in our microarray experiment, we conducted a
second experiment in which we used quantitative realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) to generate expression profiles for five candidate
genes (Table 3). These genes were chosen because they are
involved in a variety of biological processes including
cytoskeleton organization (desmin), cell-cell adhesion
(desmocollin 1), tissue remodeling (matrix metallopeptidase
13), and ion transport (solute carrier family 31 member 1).
In addition, we investigated SRV_10216_s_at in order to
verify results from a gene with unknown function. Results
of the regression analyses performed on the Q-RT-PCR
data are presented in Figure 5 alongside plots of the analogous microarray data. Residuals from the models fit for
desmocollin 1 and solute carrier family 31 member 1 exhibited significant departures from normality (Shapiro-Wilk
test, P < 0.05). Overall, there was very good agreement
between the expression profiles obtained from microarray
and Q-RT-PCR analyses. The fact that the Q-RT-PCR
results are biologically and technically independent of the
microarray data strongly suggests that these patterns are
repeatable and unlikely to be experimental or technical
artifacts.

N/A refers to a gene that does not have an established orthology with human. Probe-set ID represents the unique identifier for each probe-set on
the custom Ambystoma GeneChip. Forward and reverse primers are denoted by the extensions 5.1 and 3.1 respectively.

Previously, we used stringent statistical criteria (one-way
ANOVA, FDR = 0.001, and ≥ two-fold change) to identify
123 annotated genes that exhibited robust responses to 50
nM T4 [11]. In that study, we focused on the potential of
several keratin loci to serve as biomarkers of early metamorphic changes that precede changes in gross morphology. In this study, we used less stringent criteria to identify
DEGs and more fully explore temporal gene expression
responses when T4 concentration is varied. Of the 123
DEGs previously identified in the epidermis of metamorphosing axolotls, 116 genes were statistically significant
and differentially regulated by ≥ two-fold in the 50 nM
regression analysis. Of these, 91 (78%) were statistically
significant and differentially expressed by ≥ two-fold in
the 5 nM regression analysis. Only one of these 91 genes
was expressed in opposite directions between the T4 treatments (3' repair exonuclease 2). However this gene was
classified as LU in 5 nM T4 and QLCD in 50 nM T4, and
represents another example of a transiently up regulated
gene that was categorized as QLCD [see Additional files 7,
8]. The 25 genes identified in 50 nM T4 but not 5 nM T4
(Table 4) may function in late stage metamorphic processes that were only attained within 28 days under 50 nM
T4. For example, keratin 17 is known to be a marker of proliferating basal epidermal stem cells in mammals [21];
this gene may be expressed late during metamorphosis in
terminal cell populations of axolotl epidermis that give
rise to adult epithelial cells. Other genes associated with
tissue stress, injury, and immune function (ferritin heavy
polypeptide 1, ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2, and
cathespin S) also appear to be late response genes although
we can't rule out the possibility that these genes may be
differentially expressed as a toxic response to 50 nM T4.
The majority of the DEGs identified previously using 50
nM T4 and very strict statistical criteria were similarly identified using 5 nM T4 and different statistical methods/criteria. These findings further emphasize that the
metamorphic gene expression programs of A. mexicanum

are similar even when TH concentration is varied by an
order of magnitude.

Discussion
Paedomorphic Mexican axolotls can be induced to
undergo metamorphosis by administering TH. We found
that axolotls initiate metamorphosis at least one week earlier in 50 nM versus 5 nM T4 and complete morphological
transformations in 28 days. The lower 5 nM T4 concentration was sufficient to induce metamorphosis but the initiation timing was delayed and this proportionally delayed
the time to complete metamorphosis. The same sequence
of morphological changes was observed between T4 treatments and the majority of DEGs were identified in both T4
treatments, although their expression profiles were temporally shifted. Nearly all DEGs exhibited similar directional trends between treatments, and the subset of genes
that were directly compared between the T4 treatments
exhibited similar relative abundances. Our results show
extremely similar changes in gene expression and morphology in the axolotl when varying T4 by an order of
magnitude. This is an interesting result because T4 concentrations within this range are toxic to anurans and are
known to affect tissue-specific abundances of transcription factors that regulate metamorphic gene expression
programs [16]. Below, we discuss the axolotl's precise
transcriptional response to the range of T4 concentrations
examined in this study. We then discuss the epidermal
gene expression program of the axolotl, noting gene
expression similarities and differences between salamander and anuran metamorphosis.
TH levels are known to increase in larval amphibians as
they mature and reach maximal levels during metamorphic climax. When the concentration of TH reaches a critical intracellular level, transcriptional changes are
initiated that bring about new patterns of development.
Because the TH concentration required to alter transcription is cell-specific, tissues are often described as having

different sensitivities to TH. The sensitivity of cells to TH
involves multiple factors that affect the intracellular concentration of TH and the ability of TH to affect transcription, which is determined in part by the number of
nuclear TH binding sites (TRs) [22]. Mexican axolotls
have functional TRs [23], but TH levels are apparently too
low to initiate metamorphosis [24]. Direct hypothalamic
application of T4, using a dose that is insufficient to initiate metamorphosis via intraperitoneal injection, is sufficient to initiate metamorphosis in the axolotl [7] and
related paedomorphic tiger salamanders [25]. Thus, axolotls are capable of synthesizing TH in sufficient quantities
to initiate and complete metamorphosis. However, the
pituitary doesn't release a sufficient amount of thyrotropin to trigger the metamorphic process [24]. Axolotl epidermis can be stimulated to initiate metamorphic changes
in vitro, in isolation of endogenously synthesized TH [26].
Thus, the metamorphic timing delay that we observed
between the 5 and 50 nM T4 treatments probably reflects
the time required to autonomously activate gene expression within TH responsive cells of the epidermis and the
time required to stimulate the HPT axis. Rosenkilde [27]
showed that this latency period is TH concentration
dependent and above a critical dose (37.5 nM T3) there is

no variation in latency. After accounting for an estimated
one-week difference in the initiation timing of metamorphosis between the T4 treatments, there was not a difference in the length of the metamorphic period. Thus,
endogenous TH levels were functionally, if not quantitatively similar between 5 and 50 nM T4 treated axolotls
after metamorphosis was initiated. This idea is also supported by the precise gene expression response that we
observed between the T4 treatments: essentially all of the
genes were expressed in the same direction, and a subset
of genes that could be reliably compared showed the same
magnitude of gene expression.
The precision of the transcriptional response between T4
treatments indicates that axolotls are surprisingly tolerant
to T4 levels that dramatically affect anuran mortality and
gene expression. Others before us have also noted the tolerance of axolotls to high levels of T4 [27,28]. Because
anuran metamorphosis involves a more extensive and
integrated set of remodeling events that are accomplished
over a shorter time frame, there may be greater overlap in
the sensitivities of cells to TH among tissues that causes
metamorphic remodeling events to occur out of sequence.
The fact that salamander metamorphosis encompasses

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:78

fewer morphological changes and that many of the
changes are not as integrated (hindlimb development
occurs months before tail metamorphosis) may explain
why axolotls are so tolerant to high T4 concentrations.
However, failure to observe an increase in thyroid hormone
receptor beta transcription in axolotl suggests there may be
fundamental regulatory differences between anuran and
salamander metamorphosis.
The larval epidermis of axolotls is extensively remodeled
during T4 induced metamorphosis [29-31]. Application of
TH to paedomorphic axolotls induces many of the same
epidermal changes that occur during natural and induced
metamorphosis in anurans, including apoptosis of larval
cells, proliferation of adult cell types, and epidermal keratinization. Our results show that TH induces a diversity of
transcriptional changes that are associated with specific
remodeling processes. We observed significant gene
expression changes between the T4 treatments at Day 2,
prior to observable morphological changes at the wholeorganism level. Most of these genes were up regulated in
the higher T4 concentration relative to the lower T4 concentration. Day 2 gene expression changes may reflect
direct transcriptional activation via the binding of exogenous TH to TRs, which are functional in axolotls [23]. For
example, the human ortholog of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, a primary target for transcriptional regulation
of gluconeogenesis, is known to have a thyroid hormone
response element [32]. Early up regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, as well as fructose 1,6 bisphosphotase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, and 70 kD heat
shock protein 5 at Day 12, indicates a biochemical response
at the cellular level that includes activation of key regulatory enzymes of the gluconeogenic pathway. This is an
interesting finding for the epidermis because such
responses are generally associated with hepatic cell functions. Several other interesting gene expression changes
were detected at Day 2. These include ATP binding cassette,
subfamily B, member 4, and transglutaminase 1. ATP binding
cassette family genes are up regulated in mammals during
epidermal lipid reorganization and keratinocyte differentiation [33], and transglutaminase 1 encodes an enzyme
that functions in the formation of the cross-linked, cornified envelop of keratinocytes [34]. The early expression of
these genes is curious because keratinization is assumed
to be a terminal differentiation event in the metamorphosis of amphibian epidermis. Our results suggest that the
process of keratinization is initiated very early. As a final
example, two proteins that are specific to the mammalian
inner ear were identified as significantly down regulated:
otogelin and otoancorin. The head epidermis of the axolotl
contains mechanoreceptors that are homologous to hair
cells of the mammalian ear [35]. Our results suggest
remodeling of these and other neural components in the
axolotl skin at metamorphosis. There are many additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/78

examples that could be highlighted from our gene lists
that have not been previously discussed within the context of amphibian metamorphosis.
The most gene expression changes and the greatest
changes in transcript abundances were observed at Day 12
in 50 nM T4. For example, keratin 14, a prototypical
marker of proliferating keratinocytes in mammals [36],
was up regulated 1146 fold in 50 nM T4. This also marks
the time of the greatest morphological remodeling. After
this time, gene expression levels of many genes decreased.
Thus, as has been described in anurans, many gene expression changes in axolotl are transient, increasing initially
and then decreasing. For example, apoptosis is activated
and terminated during anuran [37] and salamander [38]
metamorphosis to regulate the death and replacement of
larval epithelial cells. When statistically significant genes
were analyzed in the absence of a two-fold change criterion, genes that were transiently up regulated (i.e., exhibited QC profiles) were statistically associated with
apoptosis and proteolysis functional ontologies (data not
shown). As another example of the similarities between
the metamorphic gene expression changes that occur in
the epidermis of frogs and salamanders, we identified
three distinct probe-sets with established orthologies to
human uromodulin that are dramatically down regulated
in the epidermis of metamorphosing A. mexicanum. Furlow et al. [39] have observed analogous results in X. laevis
and have shown that Xenopus uromodulin orthologs are
exclusively expressed in the apical cells of the larval epidermis. These and other genes that are similarly expressed
between urodeles and anurans will provide useful
biomarkers for comparative studies of metamorphosis
between these two groups.
Our informatics comparison between DEGs identified
from axolotl epidermis and Xenopus intestine identified >
100 genes that are commonly expressed in these organs
during metamorphic remodeling. However, over half of
these genes were differentially expressed in opposite directions in axolotl and Xenopus. For example, several genes
associated with immune function (CD74 antigen, chemokine ligand 5, interferon regulatory factor 1, proteasome beta
subunit 9, and class I-related major histocompatability complex) were down regulated in axolotl epidermis and up
regulated in Xenopus intestine. This is not too surprising
because it is well established that the axolotl immune system is fundamentally different from that of other vertebrates, including Xenopus [40]. Additionally, genes
expressed in opposite directions in these comparisons
may reflect fundamental differences that exist between
intestinal and epidermal remodeling. Genes that exhibited similar transcriptional patterns between Xenopus
intestine and axolotl epidermis were associated with
many different functions. For example, DNA methyltrans-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/78

ferase 1 and 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 8 were
down regulated in axolotl epidermis and Xenopus intestine
during induced metamorphosis. In mammals, DNA methyltransferase 1 functions to maintain DNA methylation
patterns that influence gene transcription [41] and 17-beta
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 8 preferentially inactivates
androgens and estrogens, [42,43]. This later example suggests a transcriptional response to increase gonadal steroid hormone levels during epithelial remodeling in
amphibians. As a final example, a presumptive ortholog
to human keratin 24 (SRV_13498_s_at) that was up regulated by > 1000 fold in axolotls exposed to 50 nM T4 was
also up regulated in Xenopus intestine, albeit by a comparatively modest four-fold increase. These comparisons
emphasize similarities and differences in gene expression
during metamorphic epithelial tissue remodeling in
anurans and salamanders.

ments and reared in 40% Holtfreter's solution with or
without T4, (Sigma T2376, St. Louis, MO). One hundred
μM stock T4 solutions were made as described in Page et
al. [11]. Five and 50 nM T4 were made fresh for each water
change by mixing 2.5 or 25 mL of 100 μM stock with 40%
Holfreter's solution to a final volume of 50 L. Water was
changed every third day.

Conclusion

RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted for each tissue sample with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol; additionally, RNA preparations were
further purified using a Qiagen RNeasy mini column
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). UV spectrophotometry and a
2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) were used to quantify and qualify RNA preparations. Three high quality RNA isolations from each
treatment and sampling time combination were used to
make individual-specific pools of biotin labeled cRNA
probes. Each of the 30 pools was subsequently hybridized
to an independent GeneChip. The University of Kentucky
Microarray Core Facility generated cRNA probes and performed hybridizations according to standard Affymetrix
protocols.

Recent microarray analyses of anurans and salamanders
show that amphibian metamorphosis involves thousands
of gene expression changes, involving many biological
processes that have previously received little attention
[9,10]. Our results show similarities and differences in the
metamorphic transcriptional programs of anurans and
salamanders. We expected to identify similarly expressed
genes because epidermis was included in anuran tissue
preparations that were used for microarray analysis, and
because tissue remodeling that occurs during metamorphosis appears to involve some evolutionarily conserved
biological processes. We also expected to observe transcriptional differences because anuran and salamander
lineages diverged > 300 million years ago. Our results suggest that amphibian metamorphosis cannot be fully
understood from the study of a few anuran species. We
show here that axolotls offer several advantages (inducible metamorphosis, robust transcriptional response, less
complex integration of remodeling events) that can be
exploited to provide complementary and novel perspectives on amphibian metamorphosis.

Methods
Study animals for microarray analyses
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
University of Kentucky Animal Care and Use Guidelines
(IACUC #00609L2003). Salamanders (A. mexicanum)
were obtained from a single genetic cross, using adults
from an inbred strain. Embryos and larvae were reared
individually at 20–22 C in 40% Holtfreter's solution. After
hatching, larvae were fed freshly hatched brine shrimp
(Artemia sp., Brine Shrimp Direct, Ogden, UT) napuli
until they were large enough (3 weeks) to eat California
blackworms (Lumbriculus sp., J.F. Enterprises, Oakdale,
CA). At approximately eight months of age, 30 salamanders were randomly assigned to each of 10 different treat-

Skin tissue was collected from salamanders following 0, 2,
12, and 28 days of T4 treatment. These time points were
sampled to test for early gene expression changes that
might precede morphological metamorphosis, and
because 28 days is a sufficient period for complete metamorphosis of 50 nM T4 induced A. mexicanum [11]. To
obtain tissue, salamanders were anesthetized in 0.01%
benzocaine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and ≈ 1 cm2 of skin tissue was removed from the top of the head.

Microarray platform
A custom Ambystoma Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) GeneChip was designed from curated expressed sequence tag
assemblies for A. mexicanum and A. tigrinum [44,45]. The
array contains 4844 probe-sets, 254 of which are controls
or replicate probe-sets. Detailed descriptions of this
microarray platform can be found in Page et al. [11] and
Monaghan et al. [46].
Quality control and low-level analyses
We used the Bioconductor package affy [47] that is available for the statistical programming environment R [48]
to perform a variety of quality control and preprocessing
procedures at the individual probe level [49,50]. These
procedures included: 1) generating matrices of M versus A
plots for all replicate GeneChips (n = 3 GeneChips for 10
treatment/sampling time combinations), 2) investigating
measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and
the distributions of all 30 GeneChips via boxplots and
histograms, 3) viewing images of the log2(intensity) val-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:78

ues for each GeneChip to check for spatial artifacts, and 4)
viewing an RNA degradation plot [50] that allows for visualization of the 3' RNA labeling bias across all GeneChips simultaneously. In addition, we used ArrayAssist
Lite software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to assess several
quality control measures that are recommended by
Affymetrix such as average background (minimum =
48.36, maximum = 59.28, n = 30) scale factors (minimum
= 0.404, maximum = 0.629, n = 30), and percent present
(minimum = 81.5, maximum = 86.5, n = 30). Next, we
processed our data by implementing the robust multiarray average (RMA) algorithm of Irizarry et al. [51].
Assessment of GeneChip precision
To obtain estimates of between GeneChip repeatability,
we generated correlation matrices for the hybridization
intensities across all probe-sets among replicate GeneChips. Very high and consistent mean r-values were calculated for each of the 10 treatment by sampling time
combinations (range of mean r ± standard error = 0.966 ±
0.002 to 0.986 ± 0.001). These results demonstrate that
we were able to obtain a high level of repeatability
between replicate GeneChips. Our data are MIAME compliant and raw data files can be obtained at Sal-Site
[45,52].
Data filtering
Microarray platforms may not accurately or precisely
quantify genes with low intensity values [53,54]. Because
low intensity genes contribute to the multiple testing
problem that is inherent to all microarray studies, we filtered probe-sets whose mean expression values across all
GeneChips (n = 30 per gene) were smaller than or equal
to the mean of the lowest quartiles (25th percentiles)
across all GeneChips (n = 30, mean = 6.53, standard deviation = 0.04; data presented on a log2 scale). Upon performing this filtration step, 3688 probe-sets were
available for significance testing. We then performed PCA
on the centered and scaled data from these probe-sets.
This analysis allowed us to visualize the relationships
between GeneChips within and across treatments.
Temporal gene expression in the absence of T4
We investigated whether genes exhibited differential
expression as a function of time in the absence of T4 (control animals sampled at Days 0, 2, 12, and 28) via linear
and quadratic regression [55]. We corrected for multiple
testing by evaluating α0 according to the algorithm of Benjamini and Hochberg [56] with a FDR of 0.05. α1 was set
to 0.05.
Detecting and classifying DEGs
We conducted three analyses to investigate the effect of T4
on epidermal gene expression. For the first analysis, we
used limma [57,58] to identify genes that were differen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/78

tially expressed as a function of T4 concentration. The
limma package couples linear models with an empirical
Bayes methodology to generate moderated t-statistics for
each contrast of interest. This approach has the same effect
as shrinking the variance towards a pooled estimate and
thus reduces the probability of large test statistics arising
due to underestimations of the sample variances. Operating limma requires the specification of two matrices. The
first is a design matrix in which the rows represent arrays
and the columns represent coefficients in the linear
model. The second is a contrast matrix in which the columns represent contrasts of interest and the rows represent coefficients in the linear model. For this analysis, the
design matrix specified a coefficient for each unique treatment by sampling time combination (10 coefficients) and
the contrast matrix specified the calculation of contrasts
between the two T4 concentrations (5 and 50 nM) at each
of the non-zero sampling times (Days: 2, 12, and 28). In
addition to moderated t-statistics, limma also generates
moderated F-statistics. These moderated F-statistics test
the null hypothesis that no differences exist among any of
the contrasts specified by a given contrast matrix. A FDR
correction [56] of 0.05 was applied to the P-values associated with the moderated F-statistics of the contrast matrix.
In order to further reduce the number of false positives,
we required that all "identified" DEGs be differentially
regulated by ≥ two-fold at one or more of the contrasted
time points.
The last two analyses were conducted using the regressionbased approach of Liu et al. [55] to detect genes that
exhibit differential expression as a function of days of T4
treatment. This approach also classifies DEGs into nine
categories based on their temporal expression profiles as
determined via linear and quadratic regression. In the
context of our experiment, these profiles have specific biological interpretations. However, exceptions to these
interpretations exist (see results for examples). In general,
genes that exhibited LD, LU, QLCD, and QLVU expression
profiles were still actively undergoing changes in their
expression levels when the study was terminated. In contrast, genes that exhibited QLVD and QLCU expression
profiles underwent down and up regulation respectively
but reached steady state expression levels before the experiment was terminated. Finally, genes that exhibited QC
and QV expression profiles were transiently up and down
regulated respectively before returning to baseline expression levels. Null results are described by the 'Flat' category.
Separate analyses were conducted for the 5 and 50 nM
datasets with α0 evaluated at a FDR of 0.05 according to
the algorithm of Benjamini and Hochberg [56] and α1 =
0.05. DEGs were required to exhibit ≥ two-fold changes
relative to Day 0 controls at one or more sampling times
before they were categorized as "identified".

Over representation analyses for genes with established
orthologies
Biological process gene ontology categories that are over
represented in our lists of DEGs (statistically significant
and ≥ two-fold change) were identified using the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [59]. In all analyses, the 3085 probe-sets on
the Ambystoma GeneChip with established orthologies
were used as the background for generating expected values. The EASE threshold was always set to 0.05, and the
count threshold was always set to two.
Bioinformatic comparison with Xenopus
In a recent microarray study, Buchholz et al. [10] presented "a core set of up regulated genes". These genes have
been identified as up regulated in response to T3 treatment
by ≥ 1.5 fold in every tissue that has been examined in
metamorphosing X. laevis via microarray analysis (limb,
brain, tail, and intestine) [9,10]. We determined the
orthologies of these genes to human as described in Page
et al. [11] and Monaghan et al. [46]. We then identified
genes listed by Buchholz et al. [10] that were also differentially expressed in our experiment. The same approach
was used to compare our gene lists to the 2340 DEGs
identified by Buchholz et al. [10] from the intestine of
metamorphosing X. laevis.
Biologically and technically independent verification
We conducted a second experiment using Q-RT-PCR to
investigate the temporal expression patterns of five genes
identified as differentially expressed by microarray analysis (Table 3). Animals used in our second experiment were
raised as described for the animals used in the microarray
experiment, with the exception that T4 treatment (50 nM)
was initiated at 120 days post-fertilization. Tissue samples
from two or three individuals were collected as described
above beginning on Day 0 (prior to initiating T4 treatment) and were collected every two days for 32 days (i.e.,
Day 0, Day 2, Day 4... Day 32).
Q-RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from integument as described for
the microarray experiment with the exception that all
samples were treated with RNase-Free DNase Sets (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each sample, the Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis
kit (Hercules, CA) was used to synthesize cDNA from 1 μg
total RNA. Primers (Table 3) were designed using Primer3
[60], and design was targeted to the same gene regions
that are covered by Affymetrix probe-sets. All PCRs were
25 μL reactions that contained: cDNA template corresponding to 10 ng total RNA, 41 ng forward and reverse
primers, and iQ SYBR-Green real-time PCR mix (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Reaction conditions were as follows: 10
minutes at 50 C, five minutes at 95 C, 45 cycles of 10 sec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/78

onds at 95 C followed by 30 seconds at 55 C, one minute
at 95 C, and one minute at 55 C. Melting curve analysis
was used to ensure the amplification of a single product
for each reaction. All reactions were run in 96 well plates
and blocked by sampling time (i.e., each of the 17 sampling times was equally represented for each gene on each
plate). PCRs were performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ
Multi-Color Real Time PCR Detection System (Hercules,
CA). All plates contained template free controls [61].
Primer efficiencies were estimated via linear regression
and relative expression ratios (R) were calculated according to Pfaffl [62]. All expression ratios are relative to the
average of the Day 0 animals, and normalized to transcriptional intermediary factor 1 (probe-set ID: L_s_at). This
gene was selected as a control because it had an extremely
small standard deviation across all treatment regimes in
the microarray experiment (n = 30, mean = 14.44, standard deviation = 0.03; data presented on a log2 scale).
Statistical Analysis of the Q-RT-PCR Data
Log2 transformed R-values for each gene were analyzed
separately via linear and quadratic regression models in
which days of T4 treatment was the predictor variable.
These analyses were carried out using JMP, Version 5 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). We decided whether to use a linear or
quadratic model for a given gene via forward selection
[20]. In short, quadratic models were accepted when the
polynomial terms were significant (P < 0.05) and resulted
in an increase in the proportion of variation in the data
explained by the model (adjusted R2) of ≥ five percent relative to the linear model. The residuals of all models were
inspected graphically. In addition, the residuals of all
models were checked for normality. In cases where the
assumption of normality was violated, regression analyses
were run to obtain equations that describe the response of
these genes to T4 as a function of time. However, such
analyses were conducted with the understanding that a
strict hypothesis testing interpretation could prove problematic.
