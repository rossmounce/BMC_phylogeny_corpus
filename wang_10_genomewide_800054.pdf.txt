and tandem repeats in the compact placozoan
genome

Abstract
: The placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens has a compact genome with many primitive eumetazoan characteristics. In order
to gain a better understanding of its genome architecture, we conducted a detailed analysis of repeat content in this
genome. The transposable element (TE) content is lower than that of other metazoans, and the few TEs present in the
genome appear to be inactive. A new phylogenetic clade of the gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons was identified, which
includes the majority of gypsy-like elements in Trichoplax. A particular microsatellite motif (ACAGT) exhibits
unexpectedly high abundance, and also has strong association with its nearby genes.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Dr. Jerzy Jurka and Dr. I. King Jordan.
Findings
Placozoans are arguably the simplest free-living multicelluar animals, and may represent an extant example of the
ancestral metazoan body plan [1]. A recent comprehensive phylogenetic study suggests that placozoans are basal
relatives to all other non-Bilaterian animals [[2], but see
[3]]. It has been suggested that the placozoan Trichoplax
adhaerens is an excellent model for the study of early evolution of metazoans [4,5]. The recent analysis of the
Trichoplax genome has revealed a lack of the frequent
intron loss and genomic rearrangement that characterize
other small metazoan genomes (e.g. flies and worms), and
many structural aspects (e.g. introns, local gene order and
larger-scale linkages) are thought to represent ancestral
eumetazoan characteristics [1]. In order to gain a better
understanding of the evolution of the Trichoplax genome
architecture, it may be interesting to investigate the abundance and types of repetitive sequences in the Trichoplax
genome, because repetitive sequences, especially transposable elements (TEs), are major evolutionary contribu* Correspondence: swang@mail.utexas.edu

tors that drive genome evolution by enhancing genome
plasticity [6-8].
We adopted both homology-based and ab initio methods to search for putative TEs. A full description of these
methods is available in additional file 1. The ~95 Mb
Trichoplax genome sequence was compared with the
Repbase database 14.04 [9] using tblastx [10] with an evalue threshold of 10-4, revealing 139 putative elements
with significant similarity to known TEs (available in
additional file 2). These elements accounted for only
0.13% of the Trichoplax genome, which is much lower
than TE content of other small metazoan genomes (Table
1). The low TE content of the Trichoplax genome
reported here is consistent with the previous report [1],
in which 665 putative TEs were identified using the
RepeatMasker program although no data curation and
TE characterization were performed. The scarcity of TEs
may explain why this genome has undergone the fewest
rearrangement among metazoan genomes [1], because
TEs are generally believed to be the major facilitators of
this process [6-8]. The putative TEs we identified
included representatives of three major TE classes: long
terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons (Table 2). DNA
transposons were the most abundant TEs in the Trichoplax genome, and included diverse superfamilies such as
helitron, piggyBac, hAT, mariner/Tc1, polinton and

MuDR. LTR retrotransposons were the second most
abundant TEs in the Trichoplax genome, and the majority of these belonged to the gypsy superfamily. Non-LTR
retrotransposons were rare in the Trichoplax genome,
and were represented by only three superfamilies. Most
of the elements we identified contained frequent stop
codons or/and frameshifts in the coding regions, and
appeared fragmented. Putative complete open reading
frames (ORFs) were identified in only 6 elements (additional file 2), of which half belonged to hAT, and half to
mariner/Tc1. However, further investigation revealed that
these lacked terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and that
each was present as only a single copy in the genome
(blastn, e ≤ 10-4). Overall, none of the elements we identified contain all the features required for functional activ-

≤ 10-4). In an effort to identify novel TEs in the Trichoplax genome, we conducted searches for LTR retrotransposons and miniature inverted-repeat transposable
elements (MITEs) based on their respective structural
features. Ten putative LTR retrotransposons were identified using the LTR_FINDER program [11], and none of
them showed protein homology to known LTR retrotransposons or other TEs. Moreover, none of them
were present in the genome with more than two copies,
so it's unlikely that these are true LTR retrotransposons.
MITEs belong to nonautonomous DNA transposons, and

are usually present in eukaryotic genomes in very high
copy numbers [12]. MITE analysis was carried out using
the MUST program [13]. We considered a potential
MITE family by requiring at least 3 elements in this family with the same perfect TIRs and target site duplications
(TSDs). MITEs turned out to be quite rare in the genome,
with only a single family represented by ~20 copies altogether. This is anticipated since no functional autonomous TEs, upon which MITEs rely for their transposition
and persistence, were identified in the Trichoplax
genome. Indeed, in a search of Trichoplax TEs in the
Repbase database [9], only five putative nonautonomous
DNA transposons with low copy numbers have been
reported so far [14].
Further investigation of phylogenetic relationships
within each TE superfamiliy was generally hampered by
the low abundance and degenerated state of TEs representing the identified TE superfamilies. However, eleven
gypsy-like elements (Ta1-11) shared a recognizable
reverse transcriptase (RT) region, thus enabling investigation of their phylogenetic relationships. No outgroup
was included in the phylogenetic analysis because we
could not obtain a well-defined phylogeny based on the
limited RT protein sequences when outgroup sequences
were added. To date, nine phylogenetic clades have been
identified in the gypsy group [15,16]. Our phylogenetic
analysis of placozoan gypsy-like elements revealed a new
clade (named Tag), which was formed by eight elements,
Ta1-8 (Fig. 1, additional file 3). Since most of placozoan
gypsy-like elements belong to the Tag clade, and this new
clade has not been identified before in other metazoan
genomes, this may suggest that much of the diversity
among gypsy-like clades emerged after the divergence of
Trichoplax from other metazoan lineages. It is also possible that Tag clade may represent an ancestral gypsy clade
which was still preserved in the Trichoplax genome. Further identification and characterization of full-length elements belonging to the Tag clade from other eukaryotic
organisms may provide new insights into the origin and
diversification of the gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons.
Two elements (Ta9 and Ta10) were grouped into the previously identified Mag clade [15]. The element Ta11 may
represent another new clade, but more data from other
animal genomes are needed to verify this.
In contrast to the extremely low TE content, tandem
repeats including microsatellites and minisatellites, represented a major source of repeat sequences, and
accounted for 2.7% of the Trichoplax genome. The tandem repeat content of the Trichoplax genome is thus
comparable to those of other small metazoan genomes,
and even the huge human genome (Table 1). Using the
SciRoko program [17], 11,697 microsatellites (repeat
units within 1~6 bp) were identified in the Trichoplax
genome based on criteria described in a previous study

(perfect repeats > 12 bp long), which had surveyed and
analyzed the abundance and distribution of microsatellites in diverse eukaryotic taxonomic groups [18]. Surprisingly, we found that pentanucleotides were the most
abundant repeat type in the Trichoplax genome, and
accounted for 61.8% (i.e. 7233) of total microsatellites
(additional file 4). This is unusual because mono-, di- and
trinucleotides are usually the most abundant repeat types
of microsatellites investigated in eukaryotic genomes so
far [18-21]. To our knowledge, this finding represents the
first report of pentanucleotide as the most abundant
repeat type of microsatellites in a eukaryotic genome.
More interestingly, further investigation revealed that
majority (78%) of the pentanucleotide repeats were
accounted for by a single motif (ACAGT). If this particular motif is discounted, other pentanucleotides only
account for 13.8% of total microsatellites, which is slightly
lower than the abundance (14.2%) of dinucleotides, suggesting the unusual pentanucleotide abundance in the
Trichoplax genome is driven by the highly abundant
ACAGT motif. Investigation of microsatellite abundance
in the Trichoplax EST sequences revealed that as
expected, trinucleotides, other than pentanucleotides,
were the most abundant repeat type (52.4%), although
ACAGT motif was still the most abundant pentanucleotide motif. Many studies have shown that microsatellites
can serve as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) to
regulate gene expression [for a review, see [19]]. In order
to evaluate if ACAGT motif could be a potential TFBS,
we investigated the association pattern of ACAGT motif
and its downstream nearby genes (Fig. 2, more info in
additional file 5). Strikingly, 54% and 85% of ACAGT
motif located within 1 kb and 5 kb upstream of nearby
genes respectively, suggesting the potential role of
ACAGT motif in regulation of nearby gene expression.
Further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of
ACAGT associated genes (GO term level = 6 and distance threshold = 5 kb) revealed that 58 genes significantly enriched in the GO term of translation (adjusted p
< 0.021), and 155 in the protein modification process
(adjusted p < 0.0064). Most of the translation genes are
ribosomal proteins, and most of the protein modification
genes are kinases. Kinases are known to regulate the
majority of cellular pathways, especially those involved in
signal transduction. Previous study has shown that
Trichoplax genome encodes a rich array of transcription
factors and signaling pathways that are typically associated with eumetazoan developmental patterning and celltype specification [1]. It would therefore be interesting to
explore the potential roles of ACAGT motif in these biological processes in the future.
Minisatellites (repeat units usually within 7~2000 bp)
were detected using the program Tandem Repeat Finder
4.03 [22]. In total, 9208 minisatellites with repeat units

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationships of T. adhaerens gypsy-like elements (Ta1-11) and other elements from the gypsy group based on a
Bayesian analysis of reverse transcriptase (RT) protein sequences. Posterior probability exceeding 0.90 are shown. The sequences of most elements are derived from the EMBL online database [EMBL:DS36733] [15], while the others are as follows: CsRn1 [GenBank:AAK07487], Gulliver [GenBank:AF243513], Fugitive [GenBank:BK005226] and Jule [GenBank:AF278691]. RT sequences were aligned using the ClustalW method [32]. The protein
alignment is available in the additional file 3. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the program MrBayes 3.1 [33]. The appropriate model of evolution was identified as WAG+G+I [34] using the MCMC model-jumping method. The MCMC chain was run for 1,000,000 generations with a sample
frequency of 200. In total, 5000 trees were produced, of which the first 4500 were discarded as burn-in while summarizing the data.

ranging from 7 bp to 1204 bp were identified in the
Trichoplax genome, and accounted for 2.4% of the
genome size. In general, the smaller the repeat unit, the
higher the repeat abundance (additional file 6a). Minisatellites with repeat units ranging from 7 bp to 25 bp contained highly abundant of repeats (usually >100 repeats).
Similar distribution patterns have previously been
observed in a scallop genome [23]. The average copy
number of these repeats was generally low in the Trichoplax genome (< 4 copies for 94% of minisatellite repeat

types) (additional file 6b), which may also account for the
lack of frequent genomic rearrangements in the Trichoplax genome.
In summary, we conducted a detailed analysis of repeat
content in the Trichoplax genome. The TEs in the Trichoplax genome are scarce and apparently lack functional
activity. A new phylogenetic clade (Tag) of the gypsy-like
LTR retrotransposons was identified. The unexpectedly
high abundance of ACAGT motif in the Trichoplax
genome represents an intriguing topic for future investi-

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer 1 (Dr. Jerzy Jurka, Genetic Information
Research Institute, USA)This paper analyzes repetitive
DNA in an interesting metazoan. Of particular interest is
the predominance of the (ACAGT)n microsatellite. However, it is difficult to evaluate the analysis of TEs. The
authors should include all the identified TE sequences in a
supplemental file.
Authors' response: Done. All identified TE sequences
and annotations are included in the additional file 2.
Furthermore, they should include analysis of non-autonomous elements if they are present. The paper needs a second review.
Authors' response: We have used the MUST program
to search for miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), which belong to nonautonomous DNA
transposons, and are usually present in eukaryotic
genomes in very high copy numbers. We considered a
potential MITE family by requiring at least 3 elements in
this family with the same perfect TIRs and TSDs. MITEs
turned out to be quite rare in the genome, with only a single family represented by ~20 copies altogether. This is
anticipated since no functional autonomous TEs, upon
which MITEs rely for their transposition and persistence,
were identified in the Trichoplax genome.
Reviewer 1's second review:
Here are putative non-autonomous DNA transposons
published in October issue of Repbase Reports.

Authors' response: We appreciate the reviewer kindly
providing this information. It is now mentioned and cited
in the revised MS.
Reviewer 2 (Dr. I. King Jordan, Georgia Institute of
Technology, USA)This manuscript describes an analysis
of the short tandem repeat and long interspersed repeat,
i.e. transposable element (TE), content of the Trichoplax
adhaerens genome. An analysis of the repeat content of
this genome is potentially interesting because the organism
has a small compact genome and it occupies a basal position in the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree. Indeed, it has been
claimed previously that Trichoplax likely resembles an
ancestral eukaryotic genome. As such, genomic studies of
this organism may reveal insight into the origin and evolution of eukaryotic genomes. The paper reports on a
straightforward analysis, and it is well written and easy to
follow. However, it is not clear what truly new or relevant
insight into eukaryotic genome evolution is provided by
these data. In addition, the methods used to search for
repeats are not sufficiently rigorous to justify the conclusions that are made regarding the repeat content of the
genome. I elaborate on these points and provide more specific comments below.
The most pressing point here is related to the authors'
contention that Trichoplax represents an ancestral
eukaryotic genome and therefore its repeat content can be
understood to resemble that of the earliest eukaryotes. The
problem is that repeats are notoriously dynamic genomic
elements. Tandem repeats are highly unstable, and TEs
are typically the most lineage-specific sequences in
eukaryotic genomes. In fact, TEs are known quickly evolve
beyond the ability to be recognized with homology based
methods. Thus, the interspersed repeats that exist in the
genome today, in particular those that can be found by the
methods used here, were certainly not around in at the
origin of the eukaryotes. Indeed, many of the TEs identified here seem to have been recently acquired and are rapidly decaying. It does not seem possible, based on the
analysis of a single genome as reported here, to determine
whether the low repeat content of Tichoplax is due to low
repeats in the eukaryotic ancestor or secondary loss of
repeats and genome streamlining over time.
Authors' response: We agree with this comment. The
corresponding discussion has been removed from the
MS.
Given the small size of the Trichoplax genome, along
with its basal phylogenetic position in the eukaryotic tree,
it is perhaps unsurprising that the authors turn up so few
TEs. However, the overall lack of TEs reported here places
a burden of proof on the authors that has not been met. It
is up to them to demonstrate that they have exhaustively
searched the genome sequence for TEs using a wide variety
of available methods. The report indicates that BLAST

Wang et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:18
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/18

was used to search for encoded protein sequences and a
single ab initio method was used to search for MITEs.
There are of course numerous tools available to search for
TEs and repeats in genome sequences (e.g. see Bergman
and Quesneville 2007 Brief Bioinform 8: 382). In fact, the
most rigorous efforts at genome annotation now involve
pipelines that combine the use of many tools - including
both homology based detection methods based on comparisons between genome sequences and TE consensus
sequences and ab initio methods that rely on specific
structural features of the elements (e.g. see Estill and Bennetzen 2009 Plant Methods 5: 8; Quesneville et al. 2005
PLoS Comput Biol. 1: 166). A deeper analysis of the repeat
content of this genome would require such a combined
approach.
Authors' response: The low TE content of the Trichoplax genome has been first reported in the previous study
[1] where 665 putative TEs were identified using the
RepeatMasker program although no data curation and
TE characterization were performed. In a search for nonautonomous TEs in the Trichoplax genome, only five
putative nonautonomous DNA transposons with low
copy numbers have been identified so far [14]. Besides
our tblastx comparison and MITE analysis, we also performed an additional analysis to search for novel LTR retrotransposons based on their structural features. Ten
putative LTR retrotransposons were identified using the
LTR_FINDER program [11], and none of them showed
protein homology to known LTR retrotransposons or
other TEs. Moreover, none of them were present in the
genome with more than two copies, so it looks unlikely
that these elements are true LTR retrotransposons. Overall, we conclude that the TE content of the Trichoplax
genome is indeed very low, and that this observation is
robust across a variety of methods.
Only a cursory description of the methods used to search
for repeats are provided in the body of the manuscript. An
additional description of the methods was provided by the
authors upon request. These methodological details need
to be included with the submission (perhaps as a supplement?) so that interested readers can more carefully evaluate the research design and the results.
Authors' response: We have now provided a complete
description of methods in the additional file 1.
There are several statements regarding the relevance
and the impact of the findings that are never substantiated or followed up on. For instance, in the abstract the
authors state that "the unexpected abundance of [the
ACAGT] motif makes this an attractive target for future
studies into animal development and genome evolution."
And in the body of the manuscript they claim that "Identification of the new phylogenetic clade, Tag may provide
new insights into the origin and diversification of the
gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons in metazoan genomes." It

Page 7 of 9

is not clear what either of these strictly descriptive findings
regarding Trichoplax genome repeats reveals about the
organisms evolution or development. How does the abundance of a short tandem relate to the development of this
organism? What does the discovery of a new gypsy clade,
nested squarely within the diversity of existing gypsy-like
sequences, tell us about the origin and diversification of
the group?
Authors' response: 1) We added more analyses to
explore the potential functions of ACAGT motif. We
have rewritten the discussion in the light of new results.
See the following:
Many studies have shown that microsatellites can serve
as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) to regulate
gene expression [for a review, see [19]]. In order to evaluate if ACAGT motif could be a potential TFBS, we investigated the association pattern of ACAGT motif and its
downstream nearby genes (Fig. 2, more info in additional
file 5). Strikingly, 54% and 85% of ACAGT motif located
within 1 kb and 5 kb upstream of nearby genes respectively, suggesting the potential role of ACAGT motif in
regulation of nearby gene expression. Further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of ACAGT associated
genes (GO term level = 6 and distance threshold = 5 kb)
revealed that 58 genes significantly enriched in the GO
term of translation (adjusted p < 0.021), and 155 in the
protein modification process (adjusted p < 0.0064). Most
of the translation genes are ribosomal proteins, and most
of the protein modification genes are kinases. Kinases are
known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways, especially those involved in signal transduction. Previous
study has shown that Trichoplax genome encodes a rich
array of transcription factors and signaling pathways that
are typically associated with eumetazoan developmental
patterning and cell-type specification [1]. It would therefore be interesting to explore the potential roles of
ACAGT motif in these biological processes in the future.
2) The phylogenetic tree of gypsy group presented in
this study is an unrooted tree, and thus no ancestry information could be inferred from this tree. No outgroup was
included in the phylogenetic analysis because we could
not obtain a well-defined phylogeny based on the limited
RT protein sequences when outgroup sequences were
added. However, since most of placozoan gypsy-like elements belong to the Tag clade, and this new clade has not
been identified before in other metazoan genomes, this
may suggest that much of the diversity among gypsy-like
clades emerged after the divergence of Trichoplax from
other metazoan lineages. It is also possible that Tag clade
may represent an ancestral gypsy clade which was still
preserved in the Trichoplax genome. Further identification and characterization of full-length elements belonging to the Tag clade from other eukaryotic organisms
would help clarify this situation, and may also provide

Wang et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:18
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/18

new insights into the origin and diversification of the
gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons.
In summary, given the abundance of new genomes that
are constantly being sequenced, one has to wonder about
the need to publish a description of the repeat content, or
other specific aspects of genome architecture, in each case.
It would seem that to justify such an exercise, the work
must provide some fundamental new insight or at the very
least clearly address a specific hypothesis. This report does
not meet those standards, and so I am left to wonder as to
the potential impact and overall relevance of the work.
Authors' response: In the revised MS, we present new
analyses and discussion to expand on the previous statements. We feel that the unusual features of repeat content
in Trichoplax are noteworthy, and that our analysis provides a useful review of those features and calls attention
to a particular sequence motif that appears to be significantly associated with translation and signaling genes.
We hope the reviewer will find that our MS has been
improved enough to justify its publication as a Discovery
Note.
Reviewer 2's second review:
I am satisfied with the authors' responses to my comments and support publication of the revised manuscript
as a Discovery Note in Biology Direct.
