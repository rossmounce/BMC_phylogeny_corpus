Abstract
Background: Microcystins are small cyclic heptapeptide toxins produced by a range of distantly
related cyanobacteria. Microcystins are synthesized on large NRPS-PKS enzyme complexes. Many
structural variants of microcystins are produced simulatenously. A recombination event between
the first module of mcyB (mcyB1) and mcyC in the microcystin synthetase gene cluster is linked to
the simultaneous production of microcystin variants in strains of the genus Microcystis.
Results: Here we undertook a phylogenetic study to investigate the order and timing of
recombination between the mcyB1 and mcyC genes in a diverse selection of microcystin producing
cyanobacteria. Our results provide support for complex evolutionary processes taking place at the
mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation domains which recognize and activate the amino acids found at X and
Z positions. We find evidence for recent recombination between mcyB1 and mcyC in strains of the
genera Anabaena, Microcystis, and Hapalosiphon. We also find clear evidence for independent
adenylation domain conversion of mcyB1 by unrelated peptide synthetase modules in strains of the
genera Nostoc and Microcystis. The recombination events replace only the adenylation domain in
each case and the condensation domains of mcyB1 and mcyC are not transferred together with the
adenylation domain. Our findings demonstrate that the mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation domains are
recombination hotspots in the microcystin synthetase gene cluster.
Conclusion: Recombination is thought to be one of the main mechanisms driving the
diversification of NRPSs. However, there is very little information on how recombination takes
place in nature. This study demonstrates that functional peptide synthetases are created in nature
through transfer of adenylation domains without the concomitant transfer of condensation
domains.

Background
Planktonic cyanobacteria often form heavy scums or
blooms in freshwater lakes, ponds and reservoirs world-

wide [1]. Cyanobacterial blooms constitute a health-risk
for human beings via recreational or drinking water
through the production of a range of hepatotoxins and

neurotoxins [1]. Microcystins are a diverse group of low
molecular weight cyclic heptapeptides and are the most
common hepatotoxins produced by cyanobacteria. They
are potent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein phosphatases 1
and 2A [2] and are linked to the deaths of wild animals
and livestock worldwide [1].
There are over 65 structural variants of microcystins differing in modifications to the peptide backbone or the type
of amino acids incorporated into the microcystin [1]. The
general structure of microcystins can be summarized as
cyclo-D-Ala1-X2-D-MeAsp3-Z4-Adda5-D-Glu6Mdha7where X and Z are variable L-amino acids (Figure
1). Many of these microcystin variants are synthesized
simultaneously by the producing cyanobacterium [1].
Structural variation has been encountered at all seven
positions, but the highest degree of structural variation is
found at the X and Z positions (Figure 1). The two most
common microcystin variants, microcystin-LR and microcystin-RR, contain L-Leu or L-Arg at the X position and LArg at the Z position in the final cyclic heptapeptide. However, microcystins may also contain other proteinogenic,
non-proteinogenic and dicarboxylic acids at these positions [1]. Structural variants of microcystin do not have
the same toxicities and microcystin-LR is an order of magnitude more toxic than microcystin-RR [1].
Microcystins are mainly produced by planktonic strains of
the distantly related cyanobacterial genera Anabaena,
Microcystis and Planktothrix [1]. Microcystin production is
also known from a small number of planktonic, benthic
and terrestrial strains of the genera Nostoc [3-5], Hapalosi-

the highly variable second and fourth positions. Microcystins
may contain L-Ala, L-Arg, L-Glu, L-Hil, L-Hph, L-Hty, L-Leu,
L-Met, L-Phe, L-Try, L-Tyr, or L-Val at the X position and LAba, L-Ala, L-Arg, L-Glu, L-Har, L-Leu, L-Met, L-Phe, L-Try,

phon [6], and Phormidium [7]. Insertional mutagenesis has
demonstrated that all microcystin variants produced by
Microcystis aeruginosa S-70, K-139 and PCC 7806 are synthesized by an enzyme complex encoded in a single 55-kb
gene cluster [8-10]. The enzyme complex which directs
the biosynthesis of microcystins includes peptide synthetases, polyketide synthases, mixed peptide synthetasespolyketide synthases, and tailoring enzymes [9-13]. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the microcystin synthetase
gene cluster was present in the last common ancestor of
all present-day producer organisms [14]. The sporadic distribution of microcystin synthetase gene clusters among
cyanobacteria is proposed to be the result of gene loss
rather than recent horizontal gene transfer [14,15].
Many important antibiotics, siderophores and toxins are
synthesized on NRPS enzyme complexes [16]. NRPSs possess a highly conserved modular structure with each module being comprised of catalytic domains responsible for
the adenylation, thioester formation and in most cases
condensation of specific amino acids [16]. The arrangement of these domains within the multifunctional
enzymes determines the number and order of the amino
acid constituents of the peptide product [17]. Additional
domains for the modification of amino acid residues such
as epimerization, heterocyclisation, oxidation, formylation, reduction or N-methylation may also be included in
the module [16-18]. The modular structure of NRPSs
allows the rational design of novel peptides by targeted
replacement of these catalytic domains [19]. The adenylation domain appears to be the primary determinant of
substrate selectivity in NRPSs [[17] and others]. High
structural conservation of the adenylation domain allows
prediction of amino acids lining the putative binding
pocket which determines substrate specificity [20]. However, recent studies predict an editing function for the condensation domain suggesting that condensation and
adenylation domains in artificial junctions may be
incompatible and block peptide synthesis [17]. This finding lead to the hypothesis that in nature condensation and
adenylation domains may act as an inseparable couple
and be transferred together during natural rearrangements
of NRPS gene clusters [18,21].
The amino acids incorporated at the X and Z positions in
structural variants of microcystin are recognized and activated by the McyB1 and McyC adenylation domains (Figure 2). Recombination between the adenylation domains
of mcyB1 and mcyC is linked to the production of microcystin-RR by strains of the genus Microcystis [22]. Recombination is thought to be an important factor contributing
to the genetic diversity of the microcystin synthetase gene
cluster in strains of the genus Microcystis [23]. However, it
is not clear how widespread this phenomenon is in other
microcystin producers or if the condensation domain is

acids found at the X and Z positions in the microcystin
respectively [11]. The McyB1 and McyC condensation

undertake a multigene phylogenetic study in order to
investigate the number and timing of recombination
events during the evolution of the microcystin synthetase
gene cluster in a variety of microcystin producing cyanobacteria. We show clear evidence for the recurrent
exchange and replacement of the adenylation domain
without the concomitant transfer of the condensation
domain in a broad range of microcystin producing cyanobacteria.

Results
Structural characterization of the identified microcystins
We documented the simultaneous production of 3 to 47
microcystin variants in these strains (see additional file 1).
The microcystin variants produced by these strains differed in the methylation of the Î±-amino group of Mdha,
the Î²-carboxyl of D-MeAsp and the C9 hydroxyl of Adda.
However, most structural differences lay in the type of
amino acid incorporated at the X position. Most strains
produced microcystins that contained L-Leu at the X position (Figure 3a). The strains included in this study also
produced microcystins which contained L-Arg, L-Hil, LHph, L-Hty, L-Phe, L-Try, L-Tyr, or L-Val at the X position
(see additional file 1). Most strains produced microcystins
that contained L-Arg at the Z position (Figure 3b). However, almost half of the microcystin variants contained LHar at the Z-position in Nostoc sp. 152 (Figure 3b). Almost
all variants produced in Hapalosiphon hibernicus BZ-3-1
contained L-Ala at the Z-position but this strain also produced minor microcystins variants in trace amounts that
contained L-Leu or L-Val at this position (see additional
file 1). The strains included in this study produced a wide
range of common and rare microcystins. A large number
of minor microcystin variants were identified through

nucleotide sequences of mcyB1 and mcyC identified
recombination breakpoints in the adenylation and thiolation domains using six different methods to detect recombination (Figure 5). The recombination area extended
across the entire adenylation domains spanning conserved core motifs A1â10 into the middle of the thiolation domain (Figure 5). Additional sets of breakpoints
were identified within the adenylation domain in Anabaena sp. 18B6 replacing the adenylation domain elements A2âA10 (data not shown). In the case of Microcystis
aeruginosa PCC7806 a second set of breakpoints were also
identified spanning the substrate conferring portions of
the adenylation domain between the core motifs A3âA8
(data not shown).

received robust bootstrap support (Figure 6). Maximumlikelihood trees based on the amino acid sequence of the
condensation domain from McyB1 and McyC are also
broadly congruent with the phylogeny of the producer
organism (Figure 7a). McyB1 condensation domains were
monophyletic and grouped together with condensations
domains with a D-peptidyl donor (Figure 7a). Interestingly the McyC condensation domains were also monophyletic but grouped with condensation domains with an
L-peptidyl donor (Figure 7a) despite having D-MeAsp as
the donor amino acid.
Maximum-likelihood trees based on the amino acid
sequence of the condensation domains and the A3âA8
substrate conferring portion of the adenylation domain of
McyB1 and McyC differed considerably (Figure 7b). The
mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation domain nucleotide
sequences of Anabaena spp. 90, 18B6, 66A and Hapalosiphon hibernicus BZ-3-1 were all more similar to one
another than they were to other mcyB1 or mcyC sequences
(Figure 7b). The nucleotide sequence similarity between
each of these pairs of condensation domains was very low
and ranged from 27 to 28% (Table 1). However, the
nucleotide sequence similarity between each of these pairs
of adenylation domains was very high and ranged from
93 to 97% (Table 1). There was no clear evidence for such
recent recombination between mcyB1 and mcyC in Microcystis viridis NIES 102, Planktothrix agardhii NIVA 126/8,
213 or Nostoc sp. 152 (Figure 7b). The sequence divergence between mcyB1 and mcyC from these strains is

higher than the sequence divergence between housekeeping genes and other microcystin synthetase genes within
these genera [5,23,24]. In the case of Nostoc sp. IO-102-I
and Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 the amino acid
sequence of the McyB1 adenylation domain differed considerably from other McyB1 adenylation domains. This
region of dissimilarity extended across the entire adenylation domain (A1âA10) in Nostoc sp. IO-102-I but was limited to the A3âA8 region of the adenylation domain in
Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806. This is reflected in the
phylogenetic position of these two adenylation domains
in maximum-likelihood trees based on the A3âA8 portions of the adenylation domain (Figure 7b).
Substrate specificities of the mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation
domains
The L-Asp residue at position 235 and the L-Lys residue at
517 which interact with the Î±-amino and the carboxyl
groups, respectively, to lock orientation of the L-Î±-amino
acid upon activation [20] were conserved in all strains
included in this study (Table 2). The McyB1 and McyC
adenylation domain binding pockets differed between 1
and 6 amino acids in pairwise comparisons in most
strains (Table 2). However, the amino acids lining the
putative binding pockets of McyB1 and McyC in Anabaena
sp. 18B6 and Hapalosiphon hibernicus BZ-3-1 were identical (Table 1).

Discussion
We did not find separate congruent clusters of McyB1 and
McyC adenylation domain sequences (Figures 6, 7) as
might have been anticipated under an evolutionary scenario in which all microcystin synthetase genes share the
same evolutionary history [14]. Instead we found intermixed clusters of McyB1 and McyC adenylation domains
(Figure 7b). In some instances we identified very low levels of sequence divergence in pairwise comparisons of the

nucleotide sequences of mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation
domain from the same strain (Table 1). This discordance
together with the low levels of sequence divergence is consistent with multiple recent independent recombination
events. Recombination would lead to the overwriting of
the mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation domains contributing to
sequence homogenization and explain the low divergence
of the mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation domains relative to
the mcyB1 and mcyC condensation domains in Anabaena
spp. 90, 18B6, 66A and Hapalosiphon hibernicus BZ-3-1
(Table 1). However, in addition to these recent recombination events our phylogenetic analysis reveals evidence
for replacement of the mcyB1 adenylation domain in Nostoc sp. IO-102-I and Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 (Figure 7). The high sequence divergence between the
adenylation domains of mcyB1 in these two strains and
other mcyB1 adenylation domain sequences included in
this study (Table 1) could be explained by two independent replacement events involving a non-homologous adenylation domain from another peptide synthetase gene
cluster. A recombination event has been proposed to
replace the adenylation domain of mcyB1 and mcyC of
Planktothrix agardhii NIVA 126/8 [12]. However, the
McyB1 and McyC adenylation domains of Planktothrix
agardhii NIVA 126/8 and 213 as well as Nostoc sp. 152
clustered separately suggesting that the recombination
event precedes the divergence of these two genera.
Together, our results indicate that these two adenylation
domains are recombination hotspots within the microcystin peptide synthetase gene cluster.
The recombination events at the mcyB1 and mcyC are limited to the adenylation domain and the condensation
domains in mcyB1 and mcyC are highly divergent and
group in separate clusters (Figure 7a). Recombination
breakpoints are all limited to the adenylation domain
(Figure 4, 5). The phylogenetic discordance between the

adenylation and condensation domains is inconsistent
with the hypothesis that adenylation and condensation
domains are transferred together as a unit. Two rounds of
peptide chain elongation are catalyzed by McyB, which
typically activates and condenses L-Leu and D-MeAsp into

the growing peptide chain [11]. This protein directs the
transfer of D-peptidyl intermediates involving a carboxyterminal epimerase domain of McyA and the condensation domain of McyB1 [11]. Peptide bond formation is
achieved between the Î±-amino group of D-Ala and the Î±-

McyC does not group with previously described D-L condensation domains but group instead with condensation
domains with L-peptidyl amino acids as donors (Figure
7a). However, the McyC condensation domain also lacks
the typical HHxxxDG his motif in its active site typically
present in the condensation domains with D- and L-peptidyl donors [25]. Although adenylation domains are the
primary determinants of substrate specificity in NRPSs
condensation domains are also reported to exhibit moderate to high substrate selectivity [18]. It may be that differences in the substrate specificities of the condensation
domains from McyB1 and McyC mean that the co-transfer
of the adenylation and condensation domains would
result in a non-functional peptide synthetase. Non-compatible adenylation and condensation domains are predicted to cause a drastic reduction of catalytic competence
or even a complete failure to synthesize the desired peptide by the engineered NRPS [21]. Replacement of condensation domains in mcyB1 and mcyC may lead to a
disruption of the overall integrity of the peptide assembly
process, in particular the order and timing of condensation reactions.

putative binding pocket of the adenylation domain are
known to have an effect on the type of amino acid that is
recognized and activated by the adenylation domain [20].
Single amino acid change (VâI) in McyC could be
responsible for shifting the incorporation of L-Arg
towards L-Har in Nostoc sp. 152 (Table 2). Similarly a single amino acid change in (DâY) in McyB1 could be
responsible for shifting the incorporation of L-Arg
towards L-Hty in Anabaena sp. 66A. Experimental expression and mutation of the adenylation domains in each
case could verify this hypothesis.
Determining the amino acids lining the substrate conferring portions of the adenylation domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters can yield invaluable
predictions of substrate specificities of unknown peptide
synthetases [27]. The putative binding pocket of the adenylation domains of McyB1 and McyC in Hapalosiphon
hibernicus BZ-3-1 are identical (Table 2). However, this
strain incorporated 91% L-Leu at the X position and 99%
L-Ala at the Z position (Figure 3). Our results suggest that
caution should be taken when inferring substrate specificity given the general lack of knowledge about how widespread adenylation domain replacement is in nature.
Many important antibiotics, antimicrobial compounds,
siderophores and toxins are synthesized on non-ribosomal peptide synthetase enzyme complexes [16]. There is
much current interest in engineering non-ribosomal peptide synthetases in order to create new peptides with
potential biological activities [17]. It has been suggested
that peptide synthetase would gain most effectively
through transfer of entire modules [18,21]. Some artificial
combinations of adenylation and condensation domains
result in non-functional products [21]. This led to the
hypothesis that non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules evolve as a unit [18]. Here we have clear evidence for
the exchange and replacement of the adenylation domain
without the concomitant transfer of the condensation
domain.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that the mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation domains are recombination hotspots in the
microcystin synthetase gene cluster. We show clear evidence for the recurrent exchange and replacement of the
adenylation domain in a broad range of microcystin pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/183

ducing cyanobacteria. Our results show that functional
peptide synthetases can be created in nature through
transfer of adenylation domains without the concomitant
transfer of condensation domains.

Methods
Taxon sampling and LC-MS
We selected representative producers of microcystins from
the genera Anabaena, Hapalosiphon, Microcystis, Nostoc, and
Planktothrix (see additional file 1). To obtain sufficient
biomass for LC-MS analysis 10 cyanobacterial strains were
grown at a photon irradiance of 20â27 Î¼mol m-2 sec-1 in
2.7 liters of Z8 medium aerated with filter sterilized compressed air. Cells from 21 day old cultures were homogenized with 425â1180 Î¼m diameter glass beads and 1 ml
of 85% acetonitrile. The mixture was shaken in a FP120
FastPrep cell disruptor (Savant Instruments Inc.) and then
centrifuged at 10,000 Ã g for 3 min. The supernatant was
passed sequentially through two-solid phase extraction
cartridges (StrataX Polymeric Sorbent) equilibrated with 1
ml of 85% acetonitrile and a 0.2 Î¼m pore-size filter (GHP
Acrodisc).

Microcystins were analyzed by injecting 10 Î¼l of this
extract into an Agilent 1100 series modular HPLC system
(Agilent technologies) equipped with a diode array detector and a mass spectrometer (Agilent XCT Plus Ion Trap).
A Luna-C18 (2) column (5 Î¼m, 2 Ã 150 mm, Phenomenex) at 40Â°C and a mobile phase gradient of 5% (0 min)
to 100% (50 min) isopropanol (+0.1% formic acid) in
0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.15 ml min-1 were used.
Microcystins were distinguished from other peptides
based on their characteristic UV maximum absorbance at
238 nm and on their mass spectral characteristics as MH+
values corresponding to the range of published microcystins, loss of neutral fragment 134 in the ion source,
occurrence of ions m/z 585/599/627/641 [(MeAsp)(H)ar-(DM/ADM)Adda-(Glu)+H+] and m/z 375/361
(Adda -134-Glu-(M)dha) in the MS2 spectrum. Comparison of LC-MS properties of reference strain microcystins
aided assignment of structure to the microcystin. Electrospray ionization was performed in positive ion mode.
Nebulizer gas (N2) pressure was 30â50 psi (lb/in2) (207â
345 kPa), drying gas flow and temperature 8â12 L min-1
and 350Â°C, respectively. The capillary voltage was set to
3270 V, capillary exit offset to 317 V, skimmer 1 potential
to 41.5 V with a trap drive value 82.8. Spectra were
recorded as averages of 4 using ultra scan mode and a scan
range from 50 to 1200 m/z. MS2 spectra were recorded as
averages of 3 with manual and auto MS mode with fragmentation amplitude of 0.50 V. In auto MS mode 5 precursor ions from ion range 800 â 1200 m/z were detected
with an isolation width of 4.0 m/z.

PCR and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted from 40 ml of cyanobacterial cultures using a hot phenol method [28]. We
amplified portions of the 16S rRNA, rpoC1, rpoB, tufA, and
rbcL genes using sets of specific oligonucleotide primers
(see additional file 1). These 5 housekeeping genes are
present in all cyanobacteria and are thought to be largely
unaffected by horizontal gene transfer. PCR reactions
were performed in a 20 Î¼l final volume containing
approximately 20â100 ng of DNA, 1 Ã DynaZyme II PCR
buffer, 250 Î¼M of each deoxynucleotide, 0.5 Î¼M of each
oligonucleotide primer, and 0.5 units of DynaZyme II
DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). The following protocol was used: 95Â°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94Â°C for 30 sec, annealing at 56Â°C for 30
sec and elongation at 72Â°C for 1 min, followed by a final
elongation of 72Â°C for 10 min. To study the evolution of
the microcystin biosynthetic system in these strains we
chose 5 regions of the microcystin synthetase gene cluster,
mcyD, mcyE, mcyG, mcyB and mcyC using sets of specific
oligonucleotide primers (see additional file 1). PCR reactions were performed as before but with primer concentration increased to 0.7 Î¼M and a 3-minute elongation
time to amplify the 3.5 kb mcyB and mcyC PCR products.
The size of the PCR amplification products was checked in
agarose gels and PCR products were purified using Montageâ¢ PCR Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA). The purified PCR products were Sanger
sequenced with the external primers used in PCR and
where necessary sets of internal primers (see additional
file 1). Cycle sequencing products were purified and separated on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. Chromatograms were checked and edited with CHROMAS 2.2
program (Technelysium Pty Ltd.). Contig assembly and
alignment of the sequences were performed with the
BIOEDIT Sequence Alignment Editor.
Detection of recombination
We screened mcyB1 and mcyC sequences using the program TREEORDERSCAN [29]. The TREEORDERSCAN
program provides a rapid method to detect intergenotype
recombination among individual sequences. Based on the
alignment of mcyB1 and mcyC genes from 10 strains of
toxic cyanobacteria, the phylogenetic compatibility
matrix was constructed through comparing congruence
between subtrees of whole alignment. At first, 67 alignment fragments were obtained by moving a 300 nucleotide window along the alignment with a step of 50 bases,
and neighbor-joining tree of each fragment was constructed by PHYLIP [30]. Then phylogenetic violations of
any two different subtrees were calculated by TREEORDERSCAN (Simmonic 2005 version 1.5), and presented
proportionally as a colour gradient.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/183

Detection of potential recombinant sequences, identification of likely parent sequences, and localization of possible recombination breakpoints were done in RDP3 [31].
The RDP3 package uses a mixture of statistical and phylogenetic methods to both identify probable recombination
events within individual sequences and a minimal subset
of unique events detectable within an entire alignment.
To investigate the extent of recombination within the data
set, the aligned sequences were examined using RDP3
[31], GENECONV [32], BOOTSCAN [33], MAXIMUM
CHI SQUARE [34], CHIMAERA [33], and SISTER SCAN
[35] recombination detection methods as implemented
in RDP3 [33]. Standard settings in RDP3 for all methods
were that sequences were considered as linear, the P-value
cutoff was set to 0.05, the standard Bonferroni correction
was used, consensus daughters were found and breakpoints were polished. With the set of unique recombination events identified by these 6 detection methods a
breakpoint map containing the positions of all positively
identified breakpoints was constructed by moving a 200
nucelotide window and counting all the identified breakpoints falling within each window. A breakpoint density
graph was created by plotting these numbers at the position of the centre of the window. For each window, a permutation test was made for breakpoint clustering analysis
and to define the thresholds areas.
Phylogenetic analyses
We investigated competing hypotheses concerning the
origin and timing of the recombination events in the
microcystin synthetase gene cluster by reconstructing the
evolutionary history of both the microcystin synthetase
gene cluster and the producer organisms. We amplified
and sequenced portions of genes from both the microcystin synthetase gene cluster and housekeeping genes. In
order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the microcystin synthetase gene cluster we assembled a 3199 bp
data set comprised of a mixed polyketide synthase/peptide synthetase gene (mcyE) and polyketide synthase genes
(mcyD and mcyG) (see additional file 1). The phylogenetic
analysis was rooted as described previously using homologues identified in BLAST (blastp) searches [14]. We used
random taxon addition (10 replicates), tree-bisectionreconnection branch-swapping, and heuristic searches
with 100,000 repartitions of the data. The data from all 3
genes was concatenated in order to increase the amount of
information available in phylogenetic analyses. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of the producer organisms by assembling a 3586 bp data set comprised of 16S
rRNA, rpoB, rpoC1, tufA and rbcL gene sequences (see additional file 1). These genes are involved in carbon fixation,
transcription and translation, conserved and widely used
as tools for phylogenetic classification. The 16S rRNA,
rpoB, tufA, rpoC1 and rbcL gene sequences of the early
branching cyanobacteria Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421

(BA000045) and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1
(BA000039) were used as outgroups. The 16S rRNA, rpoB,
tufA, rpoC1 and rbcL sequence data were concatenated into
a single data set. Phylogenetic analyses of these two datasets were conducted using PAUP*4.0 [36]. Priming sites
and ambiguous regions of the alignment were excluded.
Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum-likelihood optimization criteria. Maximum-likelihood analyses were performed with ten heuristic searches, random
addition-sequence starting trees, and tree bisection and
reconnection branch arrangements. The GTR model of
DNA substitution with a gamma distribution of rates and
constant sites removed in proportion to base frequencies
was used in maximum-likelihood analyses. We analyzed
1000 bootstrap replicates to test the stability of monophyletic groups.

of the amino acid into the binding pocket where it is
bound by the remaining 8 amino acids lining the pocket.
Manual substrate specificities predictions were confirmed
using the automated NRPSpredictor tool [37].

In order to investigate recombination between the adenylation domain of mcyB1 and mcyC we obtained
sequence data from mcyB1 (3494â3566 bp) and mcyC
(3581â3593 bp). The mcyB1 PCR product contained the
condensation, adenylation and thiolation domains of the
first module as well as a fragment of the condensation
domain from the second module. The mcyC gene PCR
product contained the condensation, adenylation, thiolation domain as well as part of the thioesterase domain.
Sequence data was partitioned into adenylation and condensation domain sequences and analyzed separately. We
obtained a selection of condensation and adenylation
domains from NCBI and aligned them against the McyB1
and McyC adenylation and condensation domains amino
acid sequences in BIOEDIT (see additional file 1). Regions
of ambiguous alignment were excluded and we considered 352 aa of the condensation domain and 197 aa of the
adenylation domain (A3âA8) for phylogenetic analyses.
Protein maximum-likelihood phylogenies of each dataset
were inferred using PROML implemented in the PHYLIP
3.6 package [30] with a JTT substitution model. Ten random additions with global rearrangements were used to
find the optimal tree. We performed 1,000 distance bootstrap replicates using the SEQBOOT, PROTDIST (JTT substitution model), and CONSENSE programs of the
PHYLIP 3.6 package [30].

Substrate specificities of the mcyB1 and mcyC adenylation
domains
Manual alignment against the GrsA primary amino acid
sequence between the core motifs A4 and A10 allowed
extraction of the 10 amino acids predicted to line the
binding pocket of the adenylation domain for both
McyB1 and McyC [20]. According to this model, the L-Asp
residue at position 235 and the L-Lys residue at 517 interact with the Î±-amino and the carboxyl groups, respectively, to lock orientation of the L-Î±-amino acid upon
activation [20]. This configuration projects the side chain
