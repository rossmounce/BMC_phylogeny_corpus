Abstract
By looking at drug addiction from an evolutionary perspective, we may understand its underlying
significance and evaluate its three-fold nature: biology, psychology, and social influences. In this
investigation it is important to delve into the co-evolution of mammalian brains and ancient
psychotropic plants. Gaining an understanding of the implications of ancient psychotropic substance
use in altering mammalian brains will assist in assessing the causes and effects of addiction in a
modern-day context. By exploring addiction in this manner, we may move towards more effective
treatment early prevention, treating the root of the issue rather than the symptoms.

1. Introduction
As we find ourselves in the beginning of a new millennium, we are faced with challenges to our survival as a
human population. Some of the greatest threats to our
survival are sweeping epidemics that affect millions of
individuals worldwide. Drug addiction, although often
regarded as a personality disorder, may also be seen as a
worldwide epidemic with evolutionary genetic, physiological, and environmental influences controlling this
behavior. Globally, the use of drugs has reached all-time
highs. On average, drug popularity differs from nation to
nation. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
identified major problem drugs on each continent by analyzing treatment demand [1]. From 1998 to 2002, Asia,
Europe, and Australia showed major problems with opiate addiction, South America predominantly was affected
by cocaine addiction, and Africans were treated most
often for the addiction to cannabis. Only in North America was drug addiction distributed relatively evenly
between the use of opiates, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, and other narcotics. However, all types of drugs are
consumed throughout each continent. Interpol reported
over 4000 tons of cannabis were seized in 1999, up 20%

from 1998, with the largest seizures made in Southern
Africa, the US, Mexico, and Western Europe [2]. Almost
150 tons of cocaine is purchased each year throughout
Europe and in 1999 opium production reached an estimated 6600 tons, the dramatic increase most likely due to
a burst of poppy crops throughout Southwest Asia. This
rapid increase in drug use has had tremendous global
effects, and the World Health Organization cited almost
200,000 drug-induced deaths alone in the year 2000 [3].
The Lewin group for the National Institute on Drug Abuse
and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimated the total economic cost of problematic use
of alcohol and drugs in the United States to be $245.7 billion for the year 1992, of which $97.7 billion was due to
drug abuse [4]. The White House Office of National Drug
Control Policy (ONDCP) found that between 1988 and
1995, Americans spent $57.3 billion on drugs, of which
$38 billion was on cocaine, $9.6 billion was on heroin
and $7 billion was on marijuana.
Among the different approaches for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of drug addiction, exploring the evolutionary basis of addiction would provide us with better

understanding since evolution, personality, behavior and
drug abuse are tightly interlinked. It is our duty as scientists to explore the evolutionary basis and origins of drug
addiction so as to uncover the underlying causes rather
than continuing to solely focus on the physiological signs
and global activity of this epidemic. Too often the treatment of addiction simply works to alleviate the symptoms
of addiction, dealing with overcoming the physiological
dependence and working through withdrawal symptoms
as the body readjusts to a non-dependent state of homeostasis. However, we must not only concentrate on this
aspect of addiction when considering global treatments
and preventative programs. We must take into consideration that it is not purely the physiology of addiction we
are battling.
Drug addiction is thought of as an adjunctive behavior, or
a subordinate behavior catalyzed by deeper, more significant psychological and biological stimuli. It is not just a
pharmacological reaction to a chemical but a mode of
compensation for a decrease in Darwinian fitness [5].
There are three main components involved in substance
addiction: developmental attachment, pharmacological
mechanism, and social phylogeny including social inequality, dominance, and social dependence [6]. Developmental attachment created by environmental influences,
such as parental care or lack thereof, may influence children's vulnerability to drug addiction. Evolutionarily
speaking, children that receive care that is more erratic
may focus more so on short-term risks that may have
proved to be an adaptive quality for survival in ancient
environments. Compounding that attachment, the pharmacological mechanism describes the concept of biological adaptation of the mesolimbic dopamine system to
endogenous substance intake. These factors combined
with the influence of social phylogeny create a position
for predisposition to drug addiction. They attribute to the
common belief that many substances of abuse have great
powers to heal, and that is often the driving motivation
for overuse and addiction. Evolutionary perspective
shows an intermediate and fleeting expected gain associated with drug addiction correlated with the conservation
in most mammals of archaic neural circuitry [7], most
often being a falsified sense of increased fitness and viability related to the three components of drug abuse [5,8].
The chemical changes associated with fitness and viability
are perceived by mammals as emotions, driving human
behavior.
Human behavior is mediated primarily by dopaminergic
and serotonergic systems, both of ancient origins probably evolving before the phylogenetic splits of vertebrates
and invertebrates [9]. 5-HT (serotonin), stimulated by a
small range of drugs, mediates arousal. It is believed to be
inhibited by hallucinogens and also helps control want-

http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/8

ing for ethanol and cocaine consumption. The corticomesolimbic dopaminergic system, on the other hand, is
believed to be the target of a wide range of drugs, including marijuana and cocaine, increasing the transmission of
dopamine to the nucleus accumbens [10]. This system
mediates emotion and controls reinforcement, and is the
primary pathway acted on by antipsychotic drugs such as
chlorprothixene and thioridazine. Problematic use of
drugs develops into addiction as the brain becomes
dependent on the chemical neural homeostatic circuitry
altered by the drug [7]. No matter the theory of drug
addiction, there remains one constant: withdrawal is inevitable. As a drug is administered continuously and an
individual becomes addicted, the brain becomes dependent on the presence of the drug. With an absence of the
drug, withdrawal symptoms are experienced as the brain
attempts to deal with the chemical changes. There are
believed to be evolutionary origins of drug addiction,
which will be discussed further, as well as a link between
physiological addiction and the evolution of emotion.

2. Drugs distribution and use in ancient
environments
When examining the distribution of natural drugs in
ancestral environment we see that there was often a limited amount of resources, meaning there was little overactivity of salient (wanting) behavior, causing no need for
the adaptive development within the cortico-mesolimbic
dopaminergic system of a built-in regulatory system of
salience [6,11]. Genetic and environmental factors
increasing substance abuse liability may have been of no
consequence in ancestral environments due to their limitations. We originally relied on the limitations of ancient
environments in that same manner, so when we are introduced to excessive amounts of salience in modern environment, we have no internal control. Basically, our
ancient-wired bodies have not yet evolved to adapt to
modern environment, leaving us vulnerable to addiction.
A common belief is that psychotropic plant chemicals
evolved recurrently throughout evolutionary history [12].
Archaeological records indicate the presence of psychotropic plants and drug use in ancient civilizations as far
back as early hominid species about 200 million years
ago. Roughly 13,000 years ago, the inhabitants of Timor
commonly used betel nut (Areca catechu), as did those in
Thailand around 10,700 years ago. At the beginning of
European colonialism, and perhaps for 40,000 years
before that, Australian aborigines used nicotine from two
different indigenous sources: pituri plant (Duboisia hopwoodii) and Nicotiana gossel. North and South Americans
also used nicotine from their indigenous plants N. tabacum and N. rustica. Ethiopians and northern Africans were
documented as having used an ephedrine-analog, khat
(Catha edulis), before European colonization. Cocaine

Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:8

(Erythroxylum coca) was taken by Ecuadorians about 5,000
years ago and by the indigenous people of the western
Andes almost 7,000 years ago. The substances were popularly administered through the buccal cavity within the
cheek. Nicotine, cocaine, and ephedrine sources were first
mixed with an alkali substance, most often wood or lime
ash, creating a free base to facilitate diffusion of the drug
into the blood stream. Alkali paraphernalia have been
found throughout these regions and documented within
the archaeological record. Although the buccal method is
believed to be most standard method of drug administration, inhabitants of the Americas may have also administered substances nasally, rectally, and by smoking.
Many indigenous civilizations displayed a view of psychotropic plants as food sources, not as external chemicals
altering internal homeostasis [12]. The perceived effects
by these groups were tolerance to thermal fluctuations,
increased energy, and decreased fatigue, all advantageous
to fitness by allowing longer foraging session as well as
greater ability to sustain in times of limited resources. The
plants were used as nutritional sources providing vitamins, minerals, and proteins rather than recreational psychotropic substances inducing inebriation. Due to limited
resources within ancient environments, mammalian species most probably sought out CNS neurotransmitter
(NT) substitutes in the form of psychotropic allelochemicals, because nutrient NT-precursors were not largely
available in the forms of food. Therefore, drugs became
food sources to prevent decreased fitness from starvation
and death. It is believed that early hominid species
evolved in conjunction with the psychotropic flora due to
constant exposure with one another. This may be what
eventually allowed the above civilizations to use the flora
as nutritional substances, therefore increasing both their
fitness and viability.
Over time, psychotropic plants evolved to emit allelochemical reactivity to deter threats from herbivores and
pathogenic invasions. These allelochemical responses
evolved to imitate mammalian NT so as to act as competitive binders and obstruct normal CNS functioning. The
allelochemical NT analogs were not anciently as potent as
forms of abused substances used in modern environments, but instead were milder precursors that had an
impact on the development of the mammalian CNS. The
fit of allelochemicals within the CNS indicates some coevolutionary activity between mammalian brains and psychotropic plants, meaning they interacted ecologically
and therefore responded to one another evolutionarily.
Basically, series of changes occurred between the mammalian brain and psychotropic plants allowing them affect
one another during their processes of evolving. This
would have only been possible with mammalian CNS
exposure to these allelochemicals, therefore to ancient

http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/8

mammalian psychotropic substance use. The evidence for
this theory is compelling. For example, the mammalian
brain has evolved receptor systems for plant substances,
such as the opioid receptor system, not available by the
mammalian body itself. The mammalian body has also
evolved to develop defenses against overtoxicity, such as
exogenous substance metabolism and vomiting reflexes.

3. Evolutionary advantage of emotion
The evolution of brain systems brought about indicators
of levels of fitness in the form of chemical signals perceived as emotion [7,8,11,13]. These emotions help direct
physiology and behavior of an individual towards increasing Darwinian fitness. They essentially were tools chosen
for by the mechanisms of natural selection. Positive emotions, such as euphoria and excitation, motivate towards
increased gain and fitness state, whereas negative emotions, for instance anxiety and pain, evolved as defenses
by motivating towards managing potential threats or
decreases in fitness level.
Mammalian drive to escape danger is fueled by a capacity
to feel negative emotions [14]. Negative emotions can be
defenses, and in their suppression we may find ourselves
unarmed and unprepared to deal with problems much
more detrimental than the original warning emotions.
Those individuals that lack the capacity to suffer, including the inability to experience pain, are unable to put up
basic physiological and behavioral defenses and often
find themselves dying at relatively young ages. Negative
emotions (pain, fear, stress, anxiety, etc.) have evolved in
mammals to allude to even the slightest, most harmless
potential indicator of a more serious problem, leading to
what may be known as a modern-day personality disorder. Personality disorders can be characterized as anything
from over-anxiety to schizophrenia [13]. Many emotional
disorders that drugs mask, such as anxiety disorders,
develop from the ancient adaptive mechanisms expressed
by the evolved mode of personality, and may in fact not
be disorders but hypersensitive neural adaptations. Since
personality evolved as an information gating mechanism
to transmit culture among people, as well as within an
individual from external environmental stimuli to internal neural circuitry for personal regulation, negative emotion may be simply transmitted and can be enhanced
through personality [15].
There are two defined types of positive emotion [7]. The
first includes feelings of anticipation and excitation
induced by a promise of an increase in fitness (+ Positive
Affect, or PA), while the second includes emotions of
relief and security due to a removal of a threat to fitness (Negative Affect or NA). + PA emotions fall into the behavioral activation system, or the BAS [16]. The BAS attempts
to propagate positive emotions and appetitive condition-

Page 3 of 7

Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:8

ing, resulting in a motivation to reach goals and, essentially, the positive affect. â NA emotions fall into the
behavioral inhibition system (BIS), which attempts to regulate and compensate for negative emotions and aversive
conditioning. As mammals expose themselves to fitnessincreasing situations and avoid fitness-decreasing situations, they tend to motivate towards pleasure-inducing, or
+ PA, stimuli that indicate these increases in fitness. Even
if unrelated to fitness in modern environment, emotions
continue to process events in the same archaic way. Many
pleasant feelings may now not indicate an increase in fitness at all, but the evolutionary brain may still correlate
the two.
Modern environments include medical and social technologies that bring comfort and longer living than was
experienced in ancient environment, so much of modern
human emotion does not serve the same function as was
evolutionarily performed. As our emotions become less
indicative of fitness and more superfluous, there comes to
be confusion within the intended signals of emotion. The
pursuit of "happiness" involves gain, and while evolutionarily these gains were increased fitness, the emotion of
happiness is no longer directly related to fitness. While
one may become happy due to a casual and pleasing relationship, the euphoric emotion may have evolutionarily
corresponded with an indication of successful reproduction and therefore a gain in fitness and viability. This can
also be applied to the euphoria associated with wealth,
which in ancient environments may have been an indicator of increases in fitness due to plentiful food and water
resources, but now may indicate status.

4. Effects of drugs on emotion
Psychoactive drugs induce emotions that at one point in
mammalian evolutionary history signaled increased fitness, not happiness [11]. In ancient environments positive emotion correlated with a sign of increased fitness,
such as successful foraging sessions or successful breeding.
Mammals would feel euphoric only during times where
fitness levels were high, the euphoria being indicative of
survival and not a superfluous feeling of "happiness."
Mammals would otherwise feel negative emotions when
fitness levels were low. The effect of many psychoactive
substances provided the same euphoric feeling, and may
have had some increasing effects on fitness levels in
ancient mammalian species. However, drug use today
does not carry the same predicted increases in fitness, and
in fact may act as a pathogen on neural circuitry. Yet, these
same drugs continue to target archaic mechanisms of the
brain with the intent of inducing positive emotion, essentially blocking many neurological defenses.
Drugs that stimulate positive emotion virtually mediate
incentive motivation in the nucleus accumbens and the

http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/8

neural reward system [11]. Modern drug addiction fundamentally indicates a false increase of fitness, leading to
increasing drug abuse to continue gain, even if the gain is
realized as being false. This is the quintessential paradox
among drug addicts. The motivation towards gain begins
to take precedence over adaptive behaviors among
addicted individuals. Some stimuli that simulate
increased fitness may become greater priorities than true
adaptive stimuli necessary for increased fitness, such as
food and sleep [7]. Individuals can, in turn, decrease their
fitness by ignoring necessary behaviors for survival and
fitness and focusing on a false positive emotion. The appetite for a drug may also override the drive to consummate,
causing a drastic decrease in viability. Their emotional systems are now concentrated on drug-seeking rather than
survival.
In modern humans, drugs that may block negative emotions may be more useful than the endurance of ancient
warnings of harm, like pain and fever [11]. Certain drugs
can aid in pathology treatment, and while negative emotions may have been entirely necessary for the survival of
ancient mammals, they may no longer be exclusively
indicative of nociceptive or otherwise harmful stimuli
[11,13]. Hypersensitivity of our bodies' defense mechanisms has evolved, leading to unnecessary negative emotions for non-nociceptive stimuli as preventative defense.
When there is a threat towards an individual's fitness, the
modern body often responds with several different warning signs, perhaps several different types of negative emotions (pain, fever, and hallucination, for example).
Therefore, blocking a few of the negative emotions will
ideally not disrupt the message. I emphasize the word
"ideally" for this is not always the case. Frequently there
are situations in which drugs that block these defenses,
such as anxiolytics, may contribute to the decreases in fitness by temporarily removing a small negative emotions
but leaving the individual vulnerable to a much larger
harm [17].
Emotional disposition has shown to specifically correlate
with problematic use of alcohol [16]. If the perceived
emotion before alcohol consumption is negative, the
individual most likely is drinking to cope, with less control over his/her own use. In the case of a positive disposition before consumption, the user is said to drink to
enhance, with more greatly controlled use of the substance. Since alcohol consumption alters normally functioning cognitive processes, it does not prove to be equal
to evolutionarily superior internal coping mechanisms.
Instead, alcohol mediates not only negative feelings by
their suppression, but also encourages the habituated continuance of positive emotion. Recovering alcoholics often
document reasons of relapse surrounding the drive to

Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:8

compensate for negative feelings, resulting in a motivation to cope and therefore to drink.

5. Physiology of addiction and reward
Mammalian brains work heavily on a motivational system with two types of motivation: like and want [11]. Like
is controlled by opioid and brain stem systems, and refers
to pleasure upon receiving a reward, whereas want (salience), mediated by the cortico-mesolimbic dopaminergic
system, is an anticipatory motivation to pursue reward.
We receive "pleasure" through intracellular signaling of
adaptive chemical pathways of a reward system that bring
our attention to what we need. The nucleus accumbens
(NAcb) and globus pallidus are involved in reward pathways for alcohol, opiates, and cocaine [18]. NTs involved
in these pathways are dopamine (primarily within the
NAcb and hippocampus), serotonin (hypothalamus),
enkephalins (ventral tegmental area and NAcb), GABA
(inhibitory â ventral tegmental area and NAcb), and norepinephrine (hippocampus). When there is a disturbance
within the reward intracellular cascade, a chemical imbalance occurs that triggers negative emotions to be indicative of the disturbance. This is referred to as "reward
deficiency syndrome," where the chemical imbalances
within the intracellular cascade manifest themselves as
behavioral disorders, indicating a deficiency within the
adaptive reward pathway. Drug addiction may initially
cause and then further proceed to exacerbate "reward deficiency syndrome."
Another theory of drug addiction, the "drugs for reward"
theory, states that addiction is the malfunctioning collision of both motivational systems (like vs. want), stimulating pursuit of a substance that most probably no longer
provides pleasure and in fact may be pathogenic [11]. Different drugs stimulate different types of positive emotion
[7]. Opioids contribute to â NA states, while dopaminereleasing drugs contributes to + PA states. In this theory,
dopamine is believed to mediate a state of addiction
through the activation of the cortico-mesolimbic system
passing through the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus
accumbens, all regulating reward-seeking motivation. It is
also involved in withdrawal from psychostimulants, as
the sudden removal of a chemical drug stimulant from the
body causes a massive alteration within the dopaminergic
system, leading to negative emotions. Opioids are
believed to mediate the consumption of reward, with opioid addiction following a well-defined route: 1) first
ensues as a pleasure-seeking behavior, 2) tolerance to the
opioid builds and pleasure resulting from drug use
reduces, yet use is increased in an attempt to regain the
hedonic pleasure, and 3) withdrawal may occur with a
cessation of the opioid substance differing from withdrawal from psychostimulants, but also leading to negative emotions. With the "drugs for reward" theory,

http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/8

adaptive hard-wired (physiologically determined to serve
a specific role) dopamine function is believed to induce a
feeling of reward for a particular action that indicates an
increase in the level of fitness of an individual [6]. It
encourages the continuation of habit that increases
dopamine release, therefore leading to a perception of
increased levels of fitness (although often falsely when
referring to drug use). Problems with this theory are
encountered when we take into consideration that
dopamine also signals negative reinforcement, not just
positive reinforcement through reward. Dopamine is
therefore referred to as simply altering an emotional state
from one to another, even if it means going from positive
emotion to negative emotion.
Dopamine is otherwise argued to be a mediator of salience [6]. Although dopamine is believed to control the
cortico-mesolimbic system, it does not rule the consummatory/satiatory/seeking behavior in this particular theory. It instead mediates appetitive/approach behavior,
placing an importance on things by demanding attention
on either their strength (positive emotion) or their potential harm (negative emotion), then increasing the motivation to move towards an action to change, not to satiate
(stop). If upregulated, a feeling of "wanting" is induced
for a specific substance, leading to addiction with overuse
[10]. This explains dopamine action as integrated activity
rather than hard-wired function, and best explains how
drug addiction is obsessively saliatory without ever reaching satiation. This concept is referred to as IS, or incentive
salience. Earlier theories discussed unconditioned stimuli,
such as a specific drug, as stimulants of an unconditioned
response of neural regulation [19]. In this model, the drug
is not the unconditioned stimulus causing guaranteed
changes of the CNS, as was previously thought, but the
chemical activity caused by the drug within the CNS is the
unconditioned stimuli. The brain then becomes adapted
to the chemical response of the drug, producing a salient
conditioning response within the brain's association context. The prefrontal cortex directs associative context, in
turn regulating the cortico-mesolimbic dopamine system
to induce an amalgamation of abnormal behavior and
salience; the individual is now driven by uncontrolled
craving and wanting. We originally relied on the limitations of the ancestral environment to be the regulatory
influences as we used drugs for food, and our bodies still
remain adapted to ancestral environments in that aspect.
Therefore, when we are introduced to excessive amounts
of salience, we have no internal control.
Candidate gene polymorphisms within the above pathway receptors may contribute to substance abuse [20].
Substance abuse tendencies and liabilities (the vulnerability to a disease and the possibility of becoming affected
due to genetic and environmental susceptibility) may be

Page 5 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)

Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:8

inherited through phenotypic liabilities. The expression
of substance abuse is therefore dependent on this phenotypic liability and environmental influences. The phenotypic liability may be a result of a genetic polymorphism
within the DRD2 dopamine receptor gene (A.sub.1 allele)
[18]. The DRD2 dopamine receptors are targeted by antipsychotics [9]. This particular receptor gene polymorphism
correlates with alcohol and substance addiction as well as
obsessive compulsive disorders. The DRD4 dopamine
receptor has documented polymorphisms within a 48
base pair variable number tandem repeat, and also correlates with substance addiction, for it is believed to be
involved in reducing sensitivity to methamphetamines,
alcohol, and cocaine. In Israeli and Arab heroin-dependent populations, there was data collected displaying a
DRD4 gene polymorphism in exon 3 consisting of sevenrepeat alleles not present in non-addicted control groups.
This was also observed in a study of heroin-addicted Han
Chinese. In a study done with Native American alcoholics,
a linkage on chromosome 11 near the DRD4 gene was
documented. With these phenotypic liabilities, an individual may be considered to be addicted to a substance
after passing a threshold of which there is no diagnostic or
solid definition. Dependence is often continued because
of temporary positive effects with the denial of the more
permanent, negative pharmaceutical effects. There have
been documented significant relationships between drug
and alcohol dependence and certain genetic factors, with
the same genetic correlation to smoking, displaying a significant cohesion between different substance use disorders. Individuals addicted to substances may, therefore,
be genetically predisposed to the situation and are then
pushed past threshold by environmental stimuli.

6. Social-cultural impact
We have discovered that the nature of addiction is not
solely based on free will to use, or an individual's conscious choice to use, but may have deeper influences. The
nature of drug addiction is three-fold: biological, psychological, and social. Although humans may be biologically
and psychologically predisposed to drug use and addiction, they may often be driven towards that state by social
and cultural influences. To what extent environmental
stimuli affect a person's vulnerability to addiction is
unknown and may be varying. However, we cannot
ignore the great impact of environmental and mental
stimuli in the progression towards addiction. It has been
found that certain environmental variables breed higher
vulnerability [21]. Family dysfunction and disruption,
low social class rearing, poor parental monitoring, and
rampant social drug-use exposure may greatly contribute
to an individual's movement from substance abuse predisposition to addiction. Both acute and chronic stresses
have been linked with substance abuse as well, with acute
stress being one of the main influences of relapse in reha-

http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/2/1/8

bilitated drug addicts. The widespread availability of
drugs in certain areas also may affect susceptibility [22].
This is exceptionally notable in low socioeconomic areas
in which overcrowding and poverty have been associated
statistically with increased substance abuse. In addition,
repeated exposure to successful high-status role models
who use substances, whether these role models are figures
in the media, peers or older siblings, is likely to influence
children and adolescents. Similarly, the perception that
smoking, drinking or drug use is standard practice among
peers also serves to promote substance abuse.
When examining drug addiction through this triple-perspective, we are forced as a global society to re-evaluate
the criminalization of drug use and addiction throughout
world. In general, social drug policies have been conservative and unyielding. Most often, addicts are left to feed
their addiction through illegal means of acquiring drugs.
As a result of conservative influence in national politics, a
"tough on drugs" philosophy that stresses zero tolerance,
law enforcement, and abstinence has been adopted. This
philosophy neglects the need for medical and psychological treatment of substance addiction.
Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse report over 75% of state penitentiary
inmates require drug abuse treatment, but the disconcerting fact is that under 20% of those individuals actually are
provided with proper treatment programs [23]. If treatment is provided, it is often times extremely short-term
and non-intensive, and even less frequently offered to jail
inmates. In addition, the Bureau of Justice Statistics stated
that only 1 in 10 state prison inmates were provided drug
abuse treatment in 1997, down from the 1 in 4 inmates
offered treatment in 1991. This is astonishingly low, considering the correctional institution holds more substance
abusers than any other national institution. Also commonly noted are the incredibly high comorbidity rates
between mental illness and drug addiction within the
prison system. It is vital to view substance addiction as a
medical condition when dealing with criminal charges,
making sure that addicts are provided with treatment for
the root of their affliction rather than simply punishing
the active symptoms of addiction.

7. Conclusion
Drug use and addiction seem to have been a part of mammalian society since ancient times. Researchers have evidence and reason to believe that the evolution of
mammalian brains and psychotropic plants might be
related to each other, connected by ancient drug use.
Regardless of the possible co-evolution of drugs and
mammalian brains, abuse of drugs inevitably causes longterm disadvantages. Drug addiction could be extremely
detrimental for any individual, not only because of the

Page 6 of 7

Harm Reduction Journal 2005, 2:8

various health problems involved, but also due to the fact
that it abolishes negative emotions, such as pain, which in
turn shuts off basic defense mechanisms against potential
threats. While the origins for drug addiction may indeed
be genetically founded, abuse is most likely caused by a
combination of both external and internal stimuli.
Although a person may be pre-disposed to addiction,
environmental and emotional stimuli may act as a catalyst
towards the state of actual substance addiction. It is suggested that the motivation towards drug abuse comes
from reward systems within the mammalian brain causing an initial "like" for a substance and leading to the insatiable "want" that correlates with abuse. Although there
has been a distinction made between a possibility of a
reward-based abuse and a salience-based abuse, it may be
possible to see a combined effort of the two proposed systems working towards eventual drug addiction.
More research spanning the evolutionary history of mammalian brains might give us a greater awareness of the
physiological wiring of the mammalian brain. For example, is there a combined influence of the salience and
reward systems? Are these systems in fact hard-wired, indicating a hard-wired and possibly genetic underlying origin
of liability to drug abuse? What is the true reason all
humans are vulnerable to drug abuse? Are these tendencies towards drug abuse preventable or simply treatable?
These and other questions may, in turn, allow us a deeper
understanding of how to effectively prevent and treat drug
abuse without simply placing a bandage over it by relieving the superficial symptoms accompanying it. Essentially, we must investigate what may universally cause this
internal affliction before we can move on to examine
external environmental stimuli that may be associated
with individual cases.
