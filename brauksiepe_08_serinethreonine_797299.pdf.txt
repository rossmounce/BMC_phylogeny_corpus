Abstract
Background: Colocalization of Stk33 with vimentin by double immunofluorescence in certain
cells indicated that vimentin might be a target for phosphorylation by the novel kinase Stk33. We
therefore tested in vitro the ability of Stk33 to phosphorylate recombinant full length vimentin and
amino-terminal truncated versions thereof. In order to prove that Stk33 and vimentin are also in
vivo associated proteins co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. For testing the
enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated Stk33 we incubated precipitated Stk33 with recombinant
vimentin proteins. To investigate whether Stk33 binds directly to vimentin, an in vitro cosedimentation assay was performed.
Results: The results of the kinase assays demonstrate that Stk33 is able to specifically
phosphorylate the non-α-helical amino-terminal domain of vimentin in vitro. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments employing cultured cell extracts indicate that Stk33 and vimentin
are associated in vivo. Immunoprecipitated Stk33 has enzymatic activity as shown by successful
phosphorylation of recombinant vimentin proteins. The results of the co-sedimentation assay
suggest that vimentin binds directly to Stk33 and that no additional protein mediates the
association.
Conclusion: We hypothesize that Stk33 is involved in the in vivo dynamics of the intermediate
filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylating vimentin.

Background
STK33/Stk33 is a serine/threonine kinase discovered in
the course of sequencing the human chromosome 11
region 11p15 and mouse chromosome 7 [1]. The Stk33
gene in the mouse (and also STK33 in human) is
expressed differentially in a number of specific tissues and
cells like testes, lung epithelia, alveolar macrophages, and

horizontal cells in the retina. In mouse embryos Stk33
expression is found in the developing heart, brain and spinal cord [2]. Based on sequence comparison with other
kinases the STK33/Stk33 protein was classified as a member of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase family
(CAMK) [1,3-5].

The CAMK group is a family of multifunctional kinases:
CAMK I, CAMK II and CAMK IV. Among the most well
characterized CAMKs is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. CAMK II can phosphorylate a wide range of
substrates and regulates numerous cellular functions
including cell division, differentiation, cardiac contraction, and synaptic plasticity [6]. CAMK II is abundantly
expressed in the brain [7] and a major effector for calcium-dependent signaling in neurons. The important
neuronal function of CAMK II α has been demonstrated
by analysing mice with certain mutated forms of CAMK II
α [8-11]. In comparison with CAMK II α little is known
about the CAMK II β subunit despite its prevailing appearance in the central nervous system. Alternative splicing
variants of CAMK II β in brain with different kinase activity were identified [12]. In contrast to α and β isoforms
predominantly expressed in neural tissues, the δ isoforms
of CAMK II prevail in the heart [13]. The CAMK II γ isoform is mainly expressed in differentiated smooth muscle
cells (dSMC). A novel variant of the γ isoform, CAMK II γ
G-2, can be found in several smooth muscles, in heart and
brain, but not in skeletal muscle and liver [13]. In unstimulated dSMCs it colocalizes with vimentin. Activation
with a depolarizing stimulus leads to autophosphorylation of CAMK II and phosphorylation of vimentin at
CAMK II specific sites. As a consequence CAMK II bound
to cytoskeletal vimentin is now translocated into the
cytosol. This targeting is essential for signaling in differentiated smooth muscle cells because prevention of CAMK II
targeting by antisense knockdown of CAMK II γ G-2 leads
to inhibition of ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase)
activation as well as to inhibition of muscle contraction
[13]. Anchoring CAMK II γ G-2 to vimentin in unstimulated cells is discussed as a prerequisite for optimal kinase
activation or for spatial separation of the kinase and its
substrate [13].
Serine 38 and serine 82 of vimentin are the major in vitro
and in vivo phosphorylation sites by CAMK II [14]. In cells
infected with the cytoplasmatic DNA virus ASFV (African
Swine Fever Virus) viral DNA replication resulted in activation of CAMK II and phosphorylation of vimentin on
serine 82 by CAMK II. Incubation of cells with an inhibitor of CAMK II, KN93, prevented phosphorylation of
vimentin and blocked both viral DNA replication and late
gene expression. This underlines that CAMK activation is
required for late ASFV gene expression, but the precise role
played by CAMK II in ASFV DNA replication is still
unknown. In virus infected cells vimentin phosphorylated
on serine 82 disassembles into aggregates which are transported along microtubules and are reorganized into a cage
like structure around virus assembly site. This vimentin
cage has on the one hand a cytoprotective function by preventing the diffusion of viral components into cytoplasm

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/25

and on the other hand it concentrates late structural proteins at site of virus assembly [15].
The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state regulates
the dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament
cytoskeleton. The major vimentin phosphatase in vivo is
type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) [16]. PP1c is in vivo
associated with vimentin and dephosphorylates the
CAMK II-specific phosphorylation sites of vimentin Ser38
and Ser82. Phospho-Ser82 of vimentin is dephosphorylated much slower than phospho-Ser38 by PP1c [17].
This delayed Ser82 dephosphorylation might influence
the dynamics of vimentin filament assembly/disassembly.
A requirement for cell division during mitosis is the reorganization of the intermediate filament system through
phosphorylation of vimentin as demonstrated by site-specific mutation of vimentin [18]. In the case of Polo-like
kinase 1 (Plk1), a kinase which also phosphorylates
vimentin Ser82 [19], elevated Ser82 phosphorylation by
Plk1 may play a role in efficient segregation of vimentin
filaments during mitosis [19] as phospho-Ser82 on
vimentin is hardly dephosphorylated by PP1 in mitosis.
Phospho-Ser82 may act as a memory phosphorylation
site [17].
The different sites available for serine/threonine phosphorylation in vimentin are targeted by different kinases [18].
Since we found the striking colocalization of vimentin
and Stk33 in various cell types and tissues (manuscript in
preparation), we were prompted to investigate whether
Stk33 might be another kinase to phosphorylate vimentin.
Stk33 is a serine/threonine kinase of so far unknown function. In the present study we used bacterially expressed
recombinant mouse Stk33 with several artificial vimentin
deletion mutant polypeptides also expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli for in vitro phosphorylation
assays. In addition we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with protein extracts obtained from the
mouse Sertoli cell culture SerW3. We know from previous
studies (manuscript in preparation) that Stk33 and
vimentin are coexpressed and colocalized in Sertoli cells
of mouse testes. So, Sertoli cells should be an ideal
resource for gaining native interacting Stk33 and vimentin.
However, from our previous studies it is also clear, that
Stk33 is not always expressed in cells together with vimentin. We find Stk33 in vimentin-negative cells, too.
The differential expression pattern of Stk33 in mice and
men resembles those of some members of the CAMKGroup [2]. Stk33 and CAMKII might have similar functions for example in the dynamic regulation of the inter-

mediate filament system by phosphorylation in the
course of the separation of daughter cells during mitosis.
Stk33 is expressed very specifically in some organs of the
developing mouse embryo [2]. Thus, Stk33 could play
also a role in organ development in addition to its function in phosphorylating vimentin. In this study, however
we show that vimentin is a target for phosphorylation by
Stk33 in vitro and that Stk33 and vimentin can be coimmunoprecipitated indicating a close interaction also in
vivo.

Results
Kinase assay
The recombinant Stk33 enzyme was expressed in E. coli
and affinity purified [2]. It contains all canonical kinase
subdomains and signatures [20] and also the epitope for
the anti-Stk33 antibody used in this study, which is
located N-terminal to the kinase domain (Figure 1). In
addition to nearly full length enzyme, a naturally occurring splice variant of Stk33, Stk33δ was also tested in the
assay. This splice variant was cloned and expressed as

described for recombinant nearly full length Stk33 [2]
[GenBank:AM056057]. In this splice variant, there are 27
base pairs within the kinase domain missing. Parts of the
missing amino acid sequence include the DFG-triplet [20]
(Figure 1C). It is known, these amino acids are responsible for anchoring the phosphate donor ATP [20]. So this
splice variant should produce an inactive form of Stk33
kinase. The recombinantly expressed Stk33δ isoform was
tested for both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of substrates such as vimentin wildtype and casein. As
a positive control PKA catalytic subunit was used because
it readily phosphorylates casein. This PKA catalytic subunit is not able to phosphorylate itself. Recombinant
vimentin wildtype protein and different deletion derivatives expressed in E. coli were used as major targets in the
assay. One technical problem had to be circumvented:
Recombinant Stk33 and wildtype vimentin have a very
similar electrophoretic mobility, and as we could show
Stk33 is able to perform autophosphorylation. Thus on
normal PAGE a discrimination between autophosphorylated Stk33 and phosphorylated wildtype vimentin is
hardly possible. Therefore, the vimentin wildtype monomer was treated with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde [21] to form crosslinked vimentin tetramers
with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 180
kDa (Figure 2B). This tetramer form of vimentin was
included in the phosphorylation assay. Furthermore a
number of vimentin mutants with different molecular
weights were used in the kinase assay (Figure 2A, lane 2–
6 and Figure 3). The deletion variants of human vimentin
used are Δ12, Δ 20, Δ 30, Δ 42 and Δ 50, the numbers indicate how many amino acids were deleted from the aminoterminus (Figure 3). In addition, a mutant vimentin missing the entire non-α-helical amino-terminal domain
("head") was employed.
Recombinant mouse Stk33 kinase was incubated with γ
32P ATP with the various substrates under optimized conditions tested previously. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by direct
autoradiography. The results clearly demonstrate (autoradiographs shown in Figure 2C, D, E) that: i) Stk33 (complete
kinase
domain)
is
able
to
perform
autophosphorylation. The incubation of Stk33 without
any other substrate (lane Stk33 only; Figure 2C, lane 6;
Figure 2D, lanes 3, Figure 2E, lane 12) leads to a strong
radiolabeled band with an apparent molecular weight
corresponding to the one of Stk33 (black arrowhead); ii)
The derivative of Stk33, Stk33δ in which part of the kinase
domain is deleted is not able to perform autophosphorylation (Figure 2C, lanes 1–3; white arrowhead). Furthermore, Stk33δ is not able to phosphorylate any of the
tested substrates (Figure 2C, lane 2 and 3) in contrast to
Stk33 (Figure 2C, lane 4); iii) Stk33 clearly phosphorylates vimentin in vitro (Figure 2D, lane 5 and 7; Figure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/25

2E, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9; arrows). By using the vimentin
tetramer as substrate, differentiation between autophosphorylated Stk33 and phosphorylated vimentin wildtype
is clearly possible (Figure 2D, lane 5; arrow).
When Stk33 is incubated together with wildtpye vimentin
and the deletion variants Δ12 to Δ50, a preferred phosphorylation of vimentin over Stk33 is observed, however,
there is always a basic autophosphorylation of Stk33 recognizable (black arrowhead in Figure 2E, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7,
9). So far it is not clear, whether the autophosphorylation
is a prerequisite for the kinasing activity of Stk33 or
whether also unphosphorylated Stk33 is able to phosphorylate vimentin. The limited resolution of deletion variants Δ30 and Δ42 in the gel might be related to a different
extent of phosphorylation in truncated vimentin Δ30
compared to Δ42 and therefore a changed electrophoretic
mobility might be the consequence, but this is speculation.
Notably, the truncation mutants Δ12, Δ20 and Δ30 are
phosphorylated to a higher extent than Δ42 and Δ50 (Figure 2E). Therefore we conclude that, since headless
vimentin is not phosphorylated at all, only the head
domain of vimentin is phosphorylated and furthermore
that sites both on the first 30 amino acids and sites after
amino acid 30 up to the end of the head domain are phosphorylated.
As seen in Figure 2E, lane 11 it is difficult to visualize the
only minute different position between autophosphorylated Stk33 and vimentin on an autoradiograph as Stk33
and vimentin have the same electrophoretic migration
behaviour in a PAGE. The samples on the gel of the autoradiography 2 D were electrophoretically resolved by a
longer running time than 2 E to achieve a better separation. Therefore, in lane 11, Figure 2E (shorter running
time) the resolution is not good enough to resolve the two
proteins of nearly identical molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility. Vimentin phosporylated by Stk33
(lane 7, Figure 2D) or by PKA (lane 9, Figure 2D) appears
to migrate slightly different. The extent of phosphorylation might be different inducing a phosphorylationdependent mobility shift on gels.
Immunoprecipitation
In order to prove that Stk33 and vimentin are also in vivo
associated proteins co-immunoprecipitation experiments
were carried out. As a positive control recombinant nearly
full length Stk33 protein was precipitated using protein A
sepharose and anti-Stk33 antibody [2]. For all co-immunoprecipitation experiments Sertoli cell culture SerW3
was used. All protein samples (total protein extract from
SerW3, samples of washing steps, precipitated proteins
and recombinant proteins as positive controls for Western

detection) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after preheating in
non-reducing Laemmli buffer. Therefore, the main portion of IgG molecules is still present. The appearance of a
band corresponding to the IgG heavy chain is perhaps
explainable because of heating during probe preparation.
Cellular Stk33 could be readily immunoprecipitated from
protein extracts of cultured Sertoli cells SerW3 (Figure 4B,
lane 5; arrow). The apparent molecular weight of the
immunoprecipitated Stk33 is obviously the same as the
Stk33 protein detected in unprecipitated SerW3 total protein extracts (Figure 4B, lane 1; arrow). The additional
bands (very strong signals, filled and open arrowheads)
probably arise from the IgG molecules not removed from
the reactions mixtures (upper band, filled arrowhead –
whole IgG; lower band, open arrowhead – IgG heavy
chain).
To analyse whether vimentin was co-precipitated by the
precipitation with anti-Stk33, a Western Blot analysis was
carried out with the identical material as used for the
Western blot in Figure 4B but for the detection an antivimentin antibody was used. Recombinant human
vimentin wildtype protein was included in the analysis as
a positive control (Figure 4C, lane 6). Co-immunoprecipitation from cellular extracts suggests that Stk33 and
vimentin could be associated in vivo (Figure 4C, lane 5;
arrow). In addition to the detection of vimentin in the
precipitate, there was some vimentin in the washing
buffer of the first washing step (Figure 4C, lane 2). The following washing steps did not show any vimentin in the
washing buffer (Figure 4C, lane 3 and 4), and hence it is
highly improbable that insufficient washing of the precipitate is responsible for the vimentin content. The results
indicate clearly, that Stk33 and vimentin are in vivo associated proteins.
Co-sedimentation assay
To test whether Stk33 binds directly to vimentin, an in
vitro co-sedimentation assay was performed. By analyzing
the sedimented proteins via Western Blotting experiments
we could show, that recombinant Stk33 precipitated (Figure 5A, lane 5) and that vimentin is successfully co-sedimentated (Figure 5B, lane 5) using anti-Stk33 for
precipitation. This suggests that vimentin binds directly to
Stk33 and that none intermediate protein mediates the
association.
Testing enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated Stk33
by a kinase assay
The incubation of radioactive γ 32P ATP and recombinant
vimentin protein with the co-immunocomplex obtained
by co-precipitation of Stk33 and vimentin shows that
immunoprecipitated Stk33 has kinase activity (Figure 6C,
arrowhead) and is able to phosphorylate recombinant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/25

vimentin (Figure 6C, arrow). The enzymatic activity of the
precipitated enzyme might be reduced by storing the
immunocomplex at 4°C during time for Western Blotting
experiments to check for successful co-immunoprecipitation which is a prerequirement for testing the enzymatic
activity of Stk33. A third protein with an apparent molecular weight of about 35 kDa seems to be also co-precipitated by anti-Stk33 since a radioactively labelled
additional band appears after autoradiography (Figure
6C, asterisk). As this additional band is not visible after
anti-Stk33 reaction it is probably not a splice variant of
Stk33.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether
the novel serine/threonine kinase Stk33 phosporylates the
intermediate filament protein vimentin. The motivation
to test this was a striking colocalization of vimentin and
Stk33 in various tissues and differentiated cells (manuscript in preparation). The results of the in vitro kinase
assays and of the co-immunoprecipitation studies are very
clear:
Stk33 is able to phosporylate vimentin in vitro and vimentin and Stk33 form a complex in vivo which can be readily
co-precipitated by the use of an anti-Stk33 antibody.
Stk33 binds directly to vimentin as determined by the cosedimentation assay. Therefore, none intermediate protein mediates this association. We conclude that Stk33
plays a specific role in the dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of
vimentin. It is known that phylogenetically related genes
often have similar functions. Thus it is not too surprising
that Stk33 -a member of the family of Ca2+/calmodulindependent protein kinases [1]- is able to phosphorylate
vimentin. CAMKII among other kinases is one of the
major kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of the
cytoskeletal protein vimentin [22]. In that respect it is
interesting that Stk33 undergoes autophosphorylation.
Whether the autophosphorylation of Stk33 is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of vimentin is not known.
However, it is known, that autophosphorylation is the key
event in the phosphorylation process of other members of
the CAMK group [23,24].
Intermediate filament proteins form the largest family of
cytoskeletal proteins in mammalian cells. Intermediate
filament proteins can be classificated into six types based
on their gene structure, sequence homology and immunological and/or assembly properties [25]. Vimentin
belongs to type III of intermediate filament proteins
which also comprises desmin, GFAP and peripherin.
IF proteins are composed of an amino-terminal head, a
central rod and a carboxy-terminal tail [26,27]. The rod

30, d = Δ 42, e = Δ 50, f = Δ H). The numbers indicate how many amino acids were deleted from the amino-terminus. Phosphorylation sites in the vimentin head domain are indicated as reviewed in [33]. Black dots represent phosphorylation sites on
human vimentin as mentioned in [26,35]. Open circles indicate phosphorylation sites in the mouse vimentin head domain
according to [34]. Vimentin phosphorylation sites found in the hamster are symbolized by black squares [21]. B: A hypothetical

domain is subdivided into further segments by non-α-helical regions, called linker. The head domain is essential for
IF assembly and the tail for the control of lateral association. Dimerization is mediated by the rod-domain.
Most of the kinases phosphorylate sites on IF proteins
located in the amino-terminal non α-helical head domain
(e.g. cdc2 kinase [28], cAMP-dependent protein kinase
(protein kinase A) [29], protein kinase C [29], CaMKII
[22], p21-activated kinase (PAK) [30-32]). Stk33 shows
similar head domain specificity: It phosphorylates different head domain deletion derivatives, but is not able to
phosphorylate vimentin in which the head domain is
deleted completely. Vimentin with 50 amino acids missing from the animo-terminus is still phosphorylated by
Stk33 in contrast to vimentin missing 80 amino acids.
Therefore we conclude that Stk33 phosphorylates one or
more of the phosphorylation sites known from other
kinases. The potential phosphorylation sites beyond the

head domain (downstream of amino acid 81) [33,34] and
in the tail domain of vimentin [21,33,35] are not phosphorylated by Stk33. We can therefore be rather confident
that the phosphorylation sites for Stk33 are located in the
vimentin head-domain.
In spite of the differentiation- and tissue-specific expression patterns, the function of the intermediate filament
proteins has long been considered to be just structural. By
forming a continuous network stretched from the nuclear
surface to the cell membrane and associated in tight interaction with the nuclear lamina and the nuclear cytoskeleton, it is assumed that intermediate filaments modulate
and control signal transduction [25]. The dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton is under
control of kinases and phosphatases leading to structural
changes of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton like
reorganization, solubilization or collapse. Various types
of serine/threonine protein kinases phosphorylate inter-

mediate filament proteins in vitro leading to disassembly
of the filament structure [14]. Up to now we do not yet
know whether phosphorylation of vimentin by Stk33
causes disassembly albeit this is conceivable because high
levels of vimentin phosphorylation often lead to structural alterations of the filament system.
The remodelling between polymerized intermediate filaments (long filaments and short filaments called squiggles) and non-filamentous particles is regulated by
kinases [36]. Among the different structural filament
forms the non-filamentous precursors (particles) are the
most interesting [37]. It has been reported that these particles can move long distances at high speed along microtubules with the help of molecular motors [38-40].

directional movement of vimentin intermediate filaments
along microtubule enables a kinase signaling over long
distances within a cell. This is of special interest in neurons, where signals generated in axonal or dendritic processes have to travel long distances to the cell body
(retrograde transport), especially to the nucleus, where
the kinase can affect gene expression. The transport complex consisting of phosphorylated MAP kinase Erk1/2,
importin β and dynein requires vimentin particles for
movement along microtubule fibres in injured neurons
[41]. Normally, adult neurons express only terminally differentiated neuronal intermediate filament proteins like
neurofilament proteins, but translationally silenced
vimentin mRNA is activated and synthesized in lesioned
nerves. As only soluble vimentin particles are capable of
binding a kinase, de novo synthesized vimentin protein
has to be disassembled into particles by phosphorylation
or by modification through proteolysis [37]. De novo synthesized vimentin is therefore exposed to high calcium
concentrations that prevent assembly of vimentin particles to filaments due to vimentin phosphorylation by
CAMKII [42] or due to calpain-mediated cleavage of
vimentin [41]. The creation of the kinase/vimentin complex is only possible with a phosphorylated kinase and it
is promoted at high Ca2+concentrations (e.g. near site of
nerve injury). On the contrary, the complex dissociates
near the cell body where the Ca2+ concentrations are low
[41]. During the retrograde transport dephosphorylation
of pErk is avoided as long as vimentin stays bound to the
kinase. Vimentin hides phosphorylated residues in the
kinase and therefore confines the access of the phosphatase to these residues [37]. Furthermore, other interacting partners are not capable of binding to the kinase,
which in turn guarantees the specificity of the transmitted
signal. Interestingly, this kinase transport mechanism
described for lesioned nerves is not possible in vimentin
null mice [41]. Besides several defects (e.g. in cerebellar
glia [43]) vimentin-null mice show a defective wound
repair [44], which might be related to the deficit of vimentin-dependent signaling as described for lesioned nerves
[37].
The dynamic changes of the intermediate filament organization are particularly prominent during cell movement
or mitosis and cell division. There is a constant state of
flux between non-filamentous components, short filaments and long filaments. In some but not all cell types,
vimentin filaments disassemble into aggregates and short
filaments during metaphase [45]. The organizational
changes observed during mitosis are accompanied by a
significant increase in the phosphorylation state. Site-specific mutation of vimentin and therefore changes in
potential phosphorylation sites have been demonstrated
to induce the formation of intermediate filament bridges
between unseparated daughter cells [18]. To elucidate the

precise molecular function of Stk33 in vimentin phosphorylation, it is important to determine the specific phosphorylation sites on vimentin by Stk33 which is planned
for the future.

Conclusion
Our results show that the serine/threonine kinase Stk33
phosphorylates the intermediate filament protein vimentin in vitro specifically in the vimentin head domain. Stk33
undergoes obligatory autophosphorylation, which might
be a prerequisite for its kinasing activity. By co-immunoprecipitation we were able to co-isolate vimentin together
with Stk33 using a polyclonal anti-Stk33 antibody. From
this result we conclude that Stk33 and vimentin are interacting protein partners also in vivo. This conclusion is
strongly supported by the observation that Stk33 and
vimentin can be found together in many very specialized
cells and tissues (manuscript in preparation). We propose
that Stk33 is involved in the dynamics of intermediate filament assembly/disassembly through a specific and regulated phosphorylation of vimentin.

Methods
Kinase assay
The kinasing activity of Stk33 was determined in an in
vitro kinase assay. 0.32 μg recombinant Stk33 and 1.75 μg
vimentin/vimentin deletion derivatives were incubated
with 10 mM MgCl2 in 1× kinase buffer (Na-Hepes pH 7.0,
0.05% Briji). In order to use crosslinked vimentin tetramers as a substrate for Stk33 increasing concentrations of
glutaraldehyde (0; 0.005; 0.01; 0.02; 0.04; 0.06%) [21]
were used to form these complexes. As a substrate positive
control casein phosphorylated by both Stk33 and Protein
kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (Sigma) was applied to
the assay. As a control for a contamination with any
endogenous kinase, negative controls (assay without
additionally applied Stk33 or PKA) were carried out. The
reaction was initiated by adding 20 μCi γ 32P ATP. After
incubation for 2 hours at 30°C, the reaction was stopped
by adding SDS-sample buffer (125 mM Tris, 4% SDS, 20%
Glycerol, 10 mM β-Mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.04%
Bromphenol blue, pH6.8). Samples were boiled for 5 min
prior to loading onto polyacrylamide gels and separation
by SDS-PAGE. Gels were finally autoradiographed by
exposure to Kodak X-AR films.
Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting
For immunoprecipitation, SerW3 cells (kindly provided
by Prof. Dr. Oesch, University Hospital Mainz) were
washed twice with PBS, scraped off, and solubilized in icecold lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, 2
mM PMSF in PBS (pH 7.4) by incubation at 4°C in a
shaker for 1 h. Lysed cells were centrifugated to remove
particles for 20 minutes with 14 000 rpm at 4°C. AntiStk33 [2] was added to the supernatant. After incubation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/25

for 2 h, protein A sepharose (Amersham Bioscience
Europe GmbH, Freiburg) was added for 1 h under constant agitation. After a centrifugation step (500 rpm, 4°C,
30 seconds) the pellet was washed three times with 1 ml
washing buffer (0.1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA in PBS, pH
7.4). The final pellet was suspended in non-reducing Laemmli buffer, heated to 95°C for 3 minutes and subjected
to SDS-PAGE. Western Blotting experiments were carried
out as described previously [2] using PVDF-membrane
(Roth) and Immobilion Western-HRP chemiluminescence substrate (Millipore). For the detection of immunoprecipitated proteins, a polyconal anti-vimentin antibody
kindly provided by Prof. Leube, University of Mainz, Germany was applied (1:15000). Anti-guinea pig-HRP as secondary antibody was used at 1:24000 dilution in PBS-T.
Co-sedimentation assay
For an in vitro co-sedimentation assay, recombinant Stk33
and vimentin ΔN50 protein were incubated in phosphate
buffered saline for 2 h at 4°C under gentle agitation.
Recombinant Stk33 was precipitated from the solution by
using anti-Stk33 antibody and protein A sepharose
(Amersham Bioscience Europe GmbH, Freiburg). After
centrifugation the sedimented material was washed 3
times with 1 ml washing buffer (0.1% Nonidet P40, 5 mM
EDTA). Aliquots of all washing samples and the final pellet were suspended in non-reducing buffer, heated and
electrophoretically resolved by gel electrophoresis. To test
whether Stk33 and vimentin sedimented together, Western Blotting experiments were carried out using anti-Stk33
and monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate
clone RG-96 (Sigma) and anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) for the detection of anti-vimentin Ab-2
(Dianova).
Testing enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated Stk33
by kinase assay
In order to test whether the immunoprecipitated Stk33
has enzymatic activity we incubated precipitated Stk33
with recombinant vimentin proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out as described before. As a discrimination between autophosphorylated Stk33 and
phosphorylated vimentin is hardly possible we used
recombinant vimentin with a deletion of 50 amino acids
for the phosphorylation studies. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 μCi γ 32P ATP. After 1 hour at 30°C the
reaction was stopped by adding non-reducing Laemmli
buffer. Further steps were carried out as already described
in the kinase assay protocol.
