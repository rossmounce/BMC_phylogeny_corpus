Abstract
Background: Elodea canadensis, Egeria densa and Lagarosiphon major are dioecious clonal species which are invasive in
New Zealand and other regions. Unlike many other invasive species, the genetic variation in New Zealand is very
limited. Clonal reproduction is often considered an evolutionary dead end, even though a certain amount of genetic
divergence may arise due to somatic mutations. The successful growth and establishment of invasive clonal species
may be explained not by adaptability but by pre-existing ecological traits that prove advantageous in the new
environment. We studied the genetic diversity and population structure in the North Island of New Zealand using
AFLPs and related the findings to the number of introductions and the evolution that has occurred in the introduced
area.
Results: Low levels of genetic diversity were found in all three species and appeared to be due to highly
homogeneous founding gene pools. Elodea canadensis was introduced in 1868, and its populations showed more
genetic structure than those of the more recently introduced of E. densa (1946) and L. major (1950). Elodea canadensis
and L. major, however, had similar phylogeographic patterns, in spite of the difference in time since introduction.
Conclusions: The presence of a certain level of geographically correlated genetic structure in the absence of sexual
reproduction, and in spite of random human dispersal of vegetative propagules, can be reasonably attributed to postdispersal somatic mutations. Direct evidence of such evolutionary events is, however, still insufficient.
Background
Invasive plants are of evolutionary interest because they
are successful in areas where they have been introduced,
sometimes in spite of limited genetic variation compared
to their native range. One reason for this success may be
multiple introductions, representing genetically distant
genotypes. Further, an introduced species can overcome
the negative effects of genetic bottlenecks and create
genetic variation in the introduced range when genotypes
from different geographical areas are brought together,
giving rise to genetic combinations resulting in novel
genotypes not present in the native range. In the case of
Phalaris arundinacea L. in North America, the genetic
variation is even comparable to that found in the native
European range [1]. Apparently, however, many plant
species become successful invaders in spite of very limited or non-existing genetic variation. This is the case in

perennial clonal species, which establish themselves and
disperse by vegetative propagation. Examples are the
tropical American aquatic species Alternanthera philoxeroides (C. Martius) Griseb. [2] and Eichornia crassipes
(C. Martius) Solms-Laub. [3] in their introduced range in
China.
Clonal growth is often considered an evolutionary dead
end, as defined by Stebbins [4] for self-fertilized plants.
Somatic mutations do occur, although not frequently, and
their role in the evolution of clonal species has been
extensively modelled [5].According to the somatic mutation theory of clonality of Klekowski [6,7] plants accumulate mutations in meristematic cells with age. Such
mutations reduce the likelihood of sexual reproduction
and after a certain time, evolutionary changes depend
exclusively on somatic mutations with advantageous phenotypes. It is assumed that sexual reproduction reduces
genetic diversity by preventing somatic mutations from
being transmitted to the offspring [8]. In this respect the
structure and organization of meristems (monopodial vs.
sympodial branching) affects the somatic mutation load

that can be transferred to gametes [8]. The concept of
population as a group of interbreeding individuals is not
obviously applicable to clonal species. A "population" of a
clonal species could be said to be represented by a group
of stands of which each may consist of one or more genotypes (clones). In contrast to the situation in obligately
outbreeding sexually reproducing organisms, monoclonal
"populations" are common [9] and even in the case of
clonal diversity, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium cannot be
expected to occur, as sexual reproduction may occur sporadically, if at all.
The North Island of New Zealand (NZ) is a suitable
area for the study of genetic variation patterns of invasive
species because, being an island, it is naturally delimited,
and the site of many plant invasions that have been thoroughly monitored and documented. In addition, NZ has
only recently been colonized by Europeans and therefore
provides a unique opportunity to study recent invasion
pathways and spread, as well as habitat adaptation. Elodea canadensis Michaux, Lagarosiphon major (Ridley)
Moss and Egeria densa Planchon are invasive in NZ and
in many other parts of the world. They are all dioecious
Hydrocharitaceae and, like many submerged clonal macrophytes, rarely achieve sexual reproduction even in the
native range [10]. Elodea canadensis is native to North
America and was introduced in NZ in 1868 [11]. Egeria
densa is native to South America (Brazil, Argentina and
Paraguay) and was introduced in NZ in 1946 [12]. Lagarosiphon major is native to South Africa and was first
recorded in NZ in 1950 [12]. Only female plants of E.
canadensis [13] and L. major [14] and male plants of E.
densa [14] have been found in NZ. One single record
from 1988 (I.M. Johnstone, NZ Electricity Department,
pers. comm.) also reported male plants of E. canadensis
from the Waingaro River (Waikato Region, Central North
Island) but this appears to be an isolated record, as male
plants have not been featured in subsequent surveys of
the aquatic vegetation throughout NZ. Even though both
E. canadensis sexes might potentially co-exist in some
waters, seeds have never been observed in any of the
three species [14]. This limits interbreeding opportunities and excludes the possibility of hybridization between
the three not so distantly related species, as well as agamospermy. The similar histories, the shared geographical
setting and the apparent absence of sexual reproduction
make this system suitable for the study of differentiation
in invasive clonal species. The distribution and history of
spread of these species in the North Island, documented
by historical floristic records of first introduction date,
suggest one single introduction for both E. densa and L.
major [12], but this has never been critically tested with
molecular markers. The same is true also for E. canadensis [11,13], but in this case the floristic records are less
complete, and historical scenario for the history of the

species in NZ is even more speculative. The possibility of
multiple introductions of E. canadensis was pointed out
by Thomson [15] who provided evidence for repeated
introduction of live fresh-water fish to New Zealand from
Tasmania, where E. canadensis was already established at
the time. In this study we attempt to determine the number of introductions and evaluate the role of somatic
mutations and dispersal as possible sources of the genetic
variation patterns observed. We have used AFLPs
(Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism; [16]),
because of the high number of DNA markers that this
technique is able to detect. This aspect is important when
identifying identical genotypes, and when assessing small
genetic differences between clones. We employed some
precautions to recognize and exclude possible AFLP artefactual polymorphic fragments.

Results
Similar pairwise genetic difference ranges were found in
the three species (0- 11 in E. canadensis, 0-10 in E. densa
and 0-8 in L. major), whereas their frequencies showed
different patterns (Figure 1). In E. densa and in L. major
most of the samples belonged to the same genotype (0
pairwise differences) and most of the different samples
had one pairwise difference. In E. canadensis a few samples were genetically identical and the spectrum of pairwise difference frequencies showed a normal distribution
with highest frequency of samples differing from each
other in 5 DNA fragments. Pairwise genetic differences
with a genotype of E. canadensis from Denmark ranged
between 14 and 20 DNA fragments, indicating an higher
extent of genetic differentiation between the European
genotype and all the NZ samples, and a net separation of
their pairwise difference frequencies in the spectrum.
The analysis of molecular variance showed higher percentages of genetic variation within populations than
among populations in all species. Similar levels of population differentiation were found in E. densa (average Fst
= 0.27; p-value = < 0.001) and in L. major (average Fst =
0.23; p-value = 0.02), whereas E. canadensis populations
showed higher genetic structure (average Fst = 0.32; pvalue < 0.001). The population specific Fst indices (Figure
2) show how much the Fst of each population contributes
and deviates from the weighted average Fst. Monoclonal
populations showed the highest specific Fst, but these
values are affected by the clonal nature of the populations. Heterozygosity, calculated as covariance component of the total variance, is "zero" in monoclonal
populations and Fst corresponds to the total heterozygosity of the sample set, or is very close to it, depending on
the algorithm used. Even though Fst values cannot be
interpreted in terms of gene flow among populations, the
different average Fst values in the three species give an
idea of differences in genetic structure at the population

0.75 (p-value = 0.05), indicating that the NZ genotypes
were more similar to each other than they were to the
Danish clone. Nei's unbiased minimum genetic distances
ranged between 0 and 0.01 between all pairs of populations in L. major. In E. densa they ranged between 0 and
0.06; however, only one population (McLaren) had
genetic distances over 0.02 with all the other populations.
By excluding McLaren, the range decreased to 0 - 0.02.
Pairwise genetic distances among E. canadensis populations ranged between 0.01 and 0.08. Nei'unbiased minimum genetic distance was 0.17 between the NZ E.
canadensis clones and the Danish genotype. The genetic
distance values appeared to better reflect the genetic similarities among the populations than the Fst values and
confirmed differences in genetic structure in the populations of the three species.
The relationships among the clones of the three species
are shown in the networks and Neighbour Joining (NJ)
trees of Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The size of the terminal
nodes in the network are proportional to the frequency of

the genotypes and comparable in the three species.
Although the samples of E. canadensis and E. densa
showed similar levels of polymorphism (respectively
21.6% and 22.8% of the number of DNA fragments analysed) and higher than those of L. major (9.8%), the genetic
pattern was different in the three species. In L. major the
samples from the geographically close populations of
Otamangakau and Taupo South appeared as a monophyletic group differentiated from a dominant genotype
spread in every location (Figure 3). The interrelationships
of Otamangakau and Taupo South clones, involving all
samples from these populations, were supported by jackknife values in the NJ tree (Figure 4). The other supported
relationship in the NJ tree between two apparently very
different and geographically distant clones collected at
Rotoaira and Tikitapu lakes was also detected by the network, which introduced two common ancestral genotypes to explain their genetic affinities. The network of E.
densa (Figure 5) showed a complex pattern of relationships and introduced a number of ancestral genotypes to

connect the most different samples to the most spread
clone, indicating a higher extent of differentiation than in
L. major, as also evident by the larger number of polymorphic fragments. Apart from two clones collected at
McLaren lake, whose relationship was confirmed also by
jack-knife and bootstrap support in the NJ tree (Figure 6),
E. densa populations did not appear to be genetically distinct. The network of E. canadensis showed a better
defined structure than in E. densa and a number of
monophyletic relationships among clones, including in
many cases pairs of samples from the same populations
or groups of genotypes from geographically close locations (Figure 7). As in L. major, the populations of Otamangakau and Taupo South appeared as a monophyletic
group evolved from an ancestral genotype. The NJ tree
provided jack-knife and/or bootstrap support for some of
the relationships and showed a continuum of genetic differences among the samples and the populations of Otamangakau, Taupo South and Pongakawa (Figure 8).

Considering the low level of polymorphism observed in
the three species, we assumed that individuals sharing the
same polymorphic DNA fragments were either once integrated in the same clone or were closely related. We studied the distribution of polymorphic fragments
throughout each dataset in order to track possible dispersal paths (Figure 9). This analysis showed many instances
of polymorphic fragments shared between populations. It
was not, however, possible to determine in which direction diaspores have been transported. In addition, samples with different combinations of polymorphic
fragments were present in the same populations, indicating possible multiple introductions in lakes/rivers from
different sources. In L. major (Figure 9a), four dispersal
events could be reconstructed between Rotoaira and
Tikitapu, Rotoaira and Tarawera, Tikitapu and Tarawera,
and Tarawera and Kaituna. One polymorphic fragment
was also shared by Otamangakau and Taupo South, indicating dispersal opportunities also between these two

populations. The remaining polymorphic fragments were
found in single samples only.
A larger number of polymorphic fragments was present
in E. canadensis and E. densa and the interpretation of
their patterns was less straightforward than in L. major.
In E. canadensis (Figure 9c) the populations of McLaren,
Oraka, Rotorua, Awakaponga and Pongakawa showed
more frequent exchanges between each other than with
the more distant, upstream populations of Otamangakau
and Taupo South, which, likewise, were genetically more
similar to each other than to the other populations.
McLaren and Awakaponga had the highest number of
polymorphic fragments shared with the other populations and appear to be important nodes for the dispersal
and/or recruitment of this species. McLaren was found to
be an important dispersal node also for E. densa (Figure
9b), and Parkinsons Lake for E. densa populations located
in the NW part of the island. The Ngakeketa population
from Northland shared polymorphic fragments with the

neighbouring population of Swan and with Parkinsons
Lake, but also with McLaren-connected populations,
revealing long-distance dispersal. Long-distance dispersal
appeared, however, less frequent than dispersal between
neighbouring populations.
The UPGMA trees (Figure 10) show the genetic similarities between the populations of the three species. The
lack of bootstrap support means that it cannot be
excluded that the relationships shown are merely due to
random "noise". However the topology of the trees did
not change whatever the order of the samples in the data
matrix, an indication that it is at least not entirely due to
chance, but is a result of a history of several dispersal
events and of genetic differentiation. In agreement with
the higher Fst and Nei's unbiased minimum genetic distances calculated in E. canadensis, maximum genetic distances between E. canadensis populations were five times
greater than between L. major populations and more
than twice that between E. densa populations (excluding

genetic structure in E. canadensis populations. The trees
also supported the distinction between the upstream
Otamangakau and Taupo South populations and the
downstream populations both in E.canadensis and in L.
major.

Discussion
AFLPs

The DNA quality, the reproducibility of AFLP chromatograms, the different patterns observed in E. canadensis
compared to E. densa and L. major and the similar geographical separation of Otamangakau and Taupo South
populations both in E. canadensis and in L. major, indicate that AFLPs are appropriate for the study of genetic
variation in these clonal species. If the observed genetic
patterns were due to artefacts of the AFLP technique,
similar results would have been expected in the three species, considering the similarly low levels of genetic variation.
Number of introductions

Low levels of genetic diversity were found in all three species, which suggest one introduction or multiple introductions of similar genotypes for each of the three species
in the northern part of the North Island, NZ. High levels
of genetic diversity in invasive species may be the result
of multiple introductions [1,17]. However it is not possible to exclude multiple introductions even in cases with
low genetic diversity, as the introduced genotypes might
be highly similar to begin with. The genetic variation pattern in the native range is an important reference point of
the natural variability within an invasive species and can
support the hypotheses of single vs. multiple introductions. The situation in invasive species can, however, be
more complicated than this, as they may be derived from
areas in the introduced rather than the native range,
which can be expected to give rise to different patterns.
Such a high level of genetic similarity as that observed in
this study was unexpected and is an important finding for
further genetic research in these and other invasive species. A geographically wider set of samples, including
many native and introduced populations, would need to
be analysed to conclusively address the number of introductions in NZ. In the case of L. major, genetic variation
within and between populations in the native range in
South Africa was studied by Triest [18] using isozymes.
Most of the populations were unisexual and monoclonal.
Low variation levels were recorded also between populations, indicating predominant vegetative propagation.
Evidence of sexual reproduction was provided by the
presence of one heterozygotic clone in an otherwise
homozygotic, bisexual population. The polymorphism
between this clone and the most spread one was 9.5%,

Page 13 of 18

which, interestingly, is comparable with the level of polymorphism found in our study (9.8%). However, in the NZ
populations this level of diversity was based on the whole
sample set. The two most different genotypes had a polymorphism of 5.6%, and it decreased to 3.5% and 2.1% if
differences between these clones and the most widespread one were considered. Our study shows lower levels of polymorphism than between the two different
genotypes in the native range; however some more samples from South Africa should be analysed to estimate the
variability in the native range. In addition, the different
markers applied in the two studies (isozyme vs. AFLPs)
are not totally comparable because the amount and the
parts of the genome analysed in the two studies are very
different and AFLPs are designed to detect higher levels
of intraspecific polymorphism than isozymes.
Genetic diversity was studied in introduced populations of E. densa in Oregon (USA) and Chile using
RAPDs by Carter and Sytsma [19]. Very little variation
was found in these populations, and surprisingly the
same genotypes were found in Oregon and Chile, suggesting low genetic diversity in the native source populations and/or similar introduction histories in the new
ranges. Clones were genetically very similar to each other
and the very short genetic distances between strains, as
indicated by the UPGMA tree suggest a situation siMilar
to that in the present study even though the molecular
techniques used are different. The study of Carter and
Systma [19] shows that multiple introductions of E. densa
cannot be ruled out in the North Island, NZ. A steppingstone model of colonization could, however, explain the
similar genetic patterns in Oregon and Chile and hide
higher levels of genetic diversity in the native range. In a
study using allozymes, Kadono et al. [20] found genetically uniform populations of E. densa throughout Japan,
but as in the case of isozymes, the technique yields a limited resolution compared to RAPDs and AFLPs.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of
the genetic variation pattern of E. canadensis populations. In the congeneric invasive species Elodea nuttallii
(Planchon) St John, both multiclonal [21] and monoclonal populations [20] were found in introduced ranges. In
the Moder catchment (France), 2.7% AFLP polymorphism was detected in populations of E. nuttallii [22]. A
single introduction was hypothesised and the low level of
variation that did exist was attributed to somatic mutations. Interestingly, two different mutants were found in
two of the ten investigated populations and, like in our
study, the UPGMA tree showed geographical structure in
the distribution of genetic variation. Multiple introductions in NZ from Tasmania were discussed by Thomson
[15] for E. canadensis. If this is correct, genetic diversity
had to be very limited in the source populations, suggesting a stepping-stone model of invasion in NZ. We do not

Lambertini et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/52

know the genetic pattern in Tasmania and how many
source populations were involved. We can only move the
discussion about the number of introductions from NZ to
Tasmania. The differences with the Danish genotype suggest that higher levels of DNA variation are present
within the species, but E. canadensis is invasive also in
Europe and different evolutionary patterns could explain
the divergence of allopatric gene pools.
Not knowing the genetic variation of these species in
their native range, we cannot draw conclusions about the
number of introductions to NZ (or Tasmania). Two possible scenarios emerge, however, from this study: multiple
introductions of genetically similar genotypes, or one single founding event (consisting either of one genotype or a
set of genetically similar genotypes) and evolution in situ
by somatic mutations. The first scenario would entail
either low genetic diversity in the native range or a stepping-stone model of colonization from other areas of the
introduced range, as appears to be the case for E.
canadensis. The second scenario, involving evolution of
genetic diversity in NZ by somatic mutations is consistent
with our results. A third model, which parsimoniously
combines the previous two, limiting both the number of
dispersal events and the number of mutations to have
occurred in NZ, is that of ancestral polymorphisms
retained in the three species [23].
Sources of genetic variation

Several results of this study indicate that evolutionary
processes occurred after these species were introduced in
the northern part of NZ's North Island. The measures of
population differentiation show that the time elapsed
since introduction is reflected in the genetic structure of
the populations. Elodea canadensis was the first of the
three species to be introduced in 1868 and its populations
have higher Fst values and Nei's genetic distances than
the later-established populations of E. densa and L.
major. Also, the pattern of E. canadensis differs from that
of the other species in showing more monophyletic
groups, a continuum of genetic differences between individuals and populations, and differentiation between the
geographically close populations of Taupo South and
Otamangakau from the downstream locations. Strikingly
the populations of Taupo South and Otamangakau were
found to be a monophyletic group also in L. major, which
was introduced in NZ as recently as in 1950. This can be
explained either by recent "co-dispersal" of the two species (after 1950), or by independent dispersal histories
shaped by the same geographic/physical constrains. In
both cases multiple independent introductions appear
very unlikely, as those would have blurred any common
pattern. Considering that only one sex is present, or dominant, in each species, the absence of seeds and evident
outcrossing events (recorded in the spectrum of pairwise

Page 14 of 18

genetic distances), somatic mutations seem to be a plausible source of genetic diversity in these clonal species.
The spectrum of pairwise genetic distances has previously been utilized to study genetic diversity in populations of clonal outcrossing plant species, as it may be
helpful in distinguishing between genetic variation produced by somatic mutations and genetic variation due to
outcrossing. The spectrum of clonal outcrossing populations of the marine submerged Posidonia oceanica (L.)
Del. [24] shows a bimodal distribution, with a large peak
at zero pairwise distance (α peak) indicating clonal reproduction, followed by decreasing frequencies in pairwise
distances, due to somatic mutations. The second peak of
the spectrum (β peak) is the mode of an almost normal
distribution of frequencies in pairwise distances, which
has been attributed to genetic diversity produced by outcrossing events. The same spectrum was obtained in outcrossing populations of the clonal tree Populus
tremuloides Michaux [25]. Compared to these studies,
the spectra of L. major and E. densa populations show the
same pattern that has been considered indicative of
clonal reproduction and somatic mutations. Contrastingly, the spectrum of E. canadensis populations does not
fit with this model. The normal distribution of pairwise
differences points to outcrossing genotypes, whereas the
limited range of polymorphism, which is comparable to
that of E. densa, points to somatic mutations. The comparison with a genotype from Europe shows higher numbers of polymorphic fragments with all NZ genotypes. In
addition if the spectrum was the result of outcrossing
events between the NZ genotypes, outcrossing would be
more frequent than clonal propagation, as the frequency
of "zero" pairwise differences is very low, and seeds would
be common in the populations. Seeds have, however,
never been observed in E. canadensis in the northern
part of NZ's Northern Island [14]. However, the lack of β
peak is not a conclusive evidence of absence of outcrossing. Sexual reproduction between clonal stands with the
same or highly similar genotypes is not supposed to produce a β peak. Pairwise difference frequencies are also
affected by somatic mutation rates as well as by population sizes at the time of introduction and at present, and
by genetic diversity at the time of introduction. Several
factors might interact in E. canadensis's spectrum, such
as a pool of genetically similar/closely related founders,
possible mutation-drift disequilibria and a longer introduction time.
Genetic diversity levels are different in the three species, in relation to the initial gene pools, possible ancestral polymorphisms, different somatic mutation rates and
establishment times. Egeria densa, which in the North
Island of NZ has the typical spectrum of a clonally reproducing species that has accumulated somatic mutations,
has more genetic diversity than the other macrophytes.

Lambertini et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/52

This makes E. densa more adaptable. In invasive populations of the clonal aquatic species Hydrilla verticillata (L.
f.) Royle, Albrecht et al. [26] demonstrated that herbicide
resistance evolved by somatic mutations.
Dispersal

In the absence of evident sexual reproduction, the distribution of genetic diversity in the populations documented in this study is found to be due to the dispersal of
vegetative propagules, moderated by the presence of possible geographic/ecological barriers. The analysis of the
geographic distribution of DNA polymorphic fragments
showed more frequent dispersal events between neighbouring populations, even though long-distance dispersal
was also common. Multiple introductions in lakes and
rivers appeared also to be a recurring phenomenon, as
well as down- and up-stream dispersal. The co-occurrence of more invasive species in the same localities and
similarly complex dispersal routes in all three species suggest that human dispersal had a major role in the distribution of the genetic diversity. Johnstone et al. [27] ruled
out bird-mediated dispersal because the distribution patterns of these species in NZ were not random in nature,
but linked to fishing and boating activities. Considering
that the populations sampled in this study were from a
wide range of different habitats [28], dispersal opportunities combined with an empty niche [29] rather than suitable environmental conditions, explain the distribution of
these species in the northern part of NZ's North Island,
as also found by de Winton et al. [12]. As discussed by
Howard-Williams [30], NZ has no native canopy-forming
submerged aquatic plants. Some kind of barrier seems,
however, to limit recruitment and dispersal from Otamangakau and Taupo South from/to downstream populations in E. canadensis and L. major. Surprisingly, in L.
major, these populations are isolated also from Lake
Rotoaira, which is geographically close and connected by
waterways to Otamangakau. A wider set of samples and
populations covering also the southern part of the North
Island and the South Island, combined with historic
records of first introduction date in each location would
help better understand the relationships between populations and reconstruct the introduction history of these
species in NZ with higher resolution. It would also greatly
enhance interpretation of nodes of dispersal vs. recruitment, providing a valuable tool for the local management
of these aquatic weeds.

Conclusions
Very low levels of genetic diversity were found in three
invasive aquatic species in the northern part of North
Island, NZ. Even though it is not possible to quantify how
much of the genetic variation can be attributed to each
founding event, this study provides some evidence that

Page 15 of 18

evolutionary changes have occurred in the introduced
range, even though sexual reproduction is not frequent or
does not occur at all. Post-introduction evolution is supported by population genetic structure and similar phylogeographic patterns in E. canadensis and L. major.
Considering the lack of seeds and the random dispersal of
vegetative propagules, which appears to be human-mediated, somatic mutations are supposed to be a potential
source of genetic diversity in these clonal species. However, this study does not provide direct evidence of such
evolutionary events. Genetic variation should be analysed
in the native populations to conclusively shed light on the
evolution of these species in the North Island of NZ.

Methods
Sampling

We sampled populations of the three species in a number
of locations in the northern part of the North Island, NZ
(Figure 9). This sampling area was chosen based on floristic and ecological records which indicate that all three
species were established in this area at early stages of
their introductions and from here their rapid spread was
followed throughout the North Island [12]. We focused
on this region to test to what extent, in the absence of
sampling across continents, a set of molecular data collected from a restricted geographic area can be informative about introduction history, and specifically the
number of introductions. We used a sample of E.
canadensis collected in Denmark as a reference to evaluate the genetic similarities of the NZ populations against
a different genotype.
At each location three samples were collected from different macrophyte beds randomly chosen at an average
distance of about three metres. As clonal propagation is
the main (or exclusive) form of reproduction in these species in North Island, we considered a geographical extension of the sampling area more informative than an
increased number of samples collected at each location.
The term population is used in this study in a broader
sense, which includes perennial clonal stands that are not
necessarily in a gene flow relationship. From each specimen we sampled the top shoot and stored it in a sealed
bag with silica gel. Samples from the same locations were
considered representative of one population. In total 21
specimens of E. canadensis , representing 7 populations,
42 specimens of E. densa (14 populations) and 30 specimens of L. major (10 populations) were AFLP fingerprinted.
DNA Extraction

DNA was extracted with the E.Z.N.A. plant kit from the
apical parts of shoots. DNA quality was checked on a
0.8% agarose gel, run for 1 h at 120V. DNA consisted of a
sharp band of the size of about 20.000 bp compared to the

Lambertini et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/52

Lambda DNA, Hind III marker 2 (MBI Fermentas) and
no signs of DNA digestion were visible.
DNA concentration was measured with the Nano Drop
Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Saveen Werner) at 280 nm
wavelength and was between 50 and 200 ng/μl in all samples, eluted with 50 μl E.Z.N.A. elution buffer.
DNA restriction and ligation

20 ng DNA were used for DNA restriction with 1.25 units
each of EcoRI and MseI enzymes and ligation to 2.5 pmol
EcoRI and 25 pmol MseI nucleotide adapters with 335
NEB cohesive end ligation units. Restriction and ligation
were carried out simultaneously in a PCR (Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200 - MJ Research). The program was 37
˚C for 4 h followed by 0.1 ˚C decrease in 2 h and 10 min at
70 ˚C. Restricted and ligated DNA was diluted 4x prior to
pre-amplification.
Pre-amplification

2 μl of template DNA were added to 18 μl mastermix consisting of 10 μl 2x Mastermix (VWR Ampliqon), 6 picog
EcoRI primer, 6 picog MseI primer and sterile water to
reach the final volume of 20 μl. EcoRI primer and MseI
primer consisted of one-nucleotide selective base. The
PTC-200 PCR was programmed for 20 cycles, each with a
30 s DNA denaturation at 94 ˚C, 1 min primer annealing
at 56˚C, and 1 min extension at 72 ˚C. Preamplified DNA
was diluted 4x prior to selective amplification.
Selective amplification

2 μl of template DNA were added to 18 μl mastermix consisting of 10 μl 2x Mastermix (VWR Ampliqon), 1 picog
EcoRI primer, 6 picog MseI primer and sterile water to
reach the final volume of 20 μl. EcoRI primer was Cy (fluorochrome) labelled. The PCR program was 94˚C for 30
s, 65 ˚C for 30 s decreased by 0.7 ˚C/cycle for the subsequent 12 cycles, 72 ˚C for 1 min, followed by 23 cycles at
94 ˚C for 30 s, 56 ˚C for 30 s and 72 ˚C for 1 min. Several
primer combinations were tested and many did not show
polymorphism. Three primer combinations were selected
for E. canadensis (E-ACTcy+M-CTC, E-ATGcy+MACG, E-CGTcy+M-AGC) and E. densa (E-ACTcy+MCTC, E-ATGcy+M-ACG, E-CAGcy+M-TAC) and four
primer combinations for L. major (E-ACTcy+M-CTC, EATGcy+M-ACG, E-CGTcy+M-AGC , E-CAGcy-MGCA) based on the presence of polymorphic DNA fragments and the scoring possibilities.
Electrophoresis

was run on a 7% acrylamide gel (Reprogel - Long Read)
with 50-500 bp external sizers (GE Healthcare), in an ALF
Express II DNA Analysis System (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) at 1500 V, 55˚C for 400 min. 5 μl amplified DNA
were added to 3 μl loading dye (GE Healthcare) and DNA

Page 16 of 18

was denatured in the PTC-200 PCR for 5 min at 94˚C
prior to loading on the gel.
AFLPs scoring

DNA fragments between 50 and 500 bp were scored for
presence or absence with the program ALFwin Fragment
Analyser Software package (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Only peaks clearly above the detection limit (set
with a peak shape of 10 and a minimum height of 1%),
well amplified and resolved in all samples were scored for
polymorphism. The AFLP chromatograms were virtually
identical within each species, with the exception of some
samples in which a few peaks were absent (or, in a few
cases, present) compared to the rest of the sample set.
DNA was extracted, digested, ligated and amplified twice
from these samples, to make sure that missing DNA fragments were due to polymorphism and not to DNA fragmentation. The complete reproducibility of AFLP
chromatograms excluded possible ligation [31] and PCR
[32] artefactual DNA fragments. A few samples of each
species produced interrupted chromatograms and were
excluded from the dataset. In total 102 DNA fragments
were scored in 22 samples of E. canadensis , 127 DNA
fragments were scored in 38 samples of E. densa and 142
DNA fragments were scored in 27 samples of L. major.
The scored polymorphic loci clearly showed either high
peaks or no peaks. Low intensity peaks occurred in a very
limited number of polymorphic loci and were scored as
question marks. They corresponded to 1.5% of the peaks
scored in E. canadensis, 1% of the peaks scored in E.
densa and 0.7% of the peaks scored in L. major. These
levels of ambiguity are comparable to or lower than those
quantified by Bonin et al. [33] as typical systematic genotyping errors associated with the scoring of AFLP data. In
E. canadensis nine polymorphic fragments, out of 22, had
a frequency over 0.20 and one fragment had a frequency
of 0.44. Polymorphic fragments were in most cases missing or present in all samples from the same population. In
E. densa and L. major datasets only 3 and 1 DNA fragments respectively had a frequency over 0.20 and it was
not possible to recognize any "population pattern" by
scoring the gels.
Data analysis

The resulting binary matrix was analysed for each species
with the program Arlequin ver. 3.11 [34] to estimate the
extent of genetic variation contained within and among
populations and the extent of genetic differentiation of
the populations. Question marks in the matrix were
treated as missing data. AMOVA and population comparison test were based on pairwise differences and were
tested respectively with 1000 and 100 permutations [35].
The exact test of population differentiation, based on
haplotypic frequencies, was calculated with a Markov

Lambertini et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/52

chain of 100,000 steps and 10,000 dememorization steps
[35]. The same analyses were carried out between all NZ
samples of E. canadensis, considered as one population,
and the Danish genotype. Population differentiation was
also evaluated based on Nei's [36] unbiased minimum
genetic distances, which are limitedly affected by differences in sample size [37] and unbiased by small sample
sizes [36]. The genetic distances were calculated with the
program TFPGA ver. 1.3, 2000 (Tools For Population
Genetic Analyses; [38]). Question marks in the matrix
were treated as missing data.
Genetic relationships among clones were calculated
with PAUP ver. 4.0b10 (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony; [39]) and with Network ver. 4.5.1.6 Phylogenetic
Network Constructions (Copyright 2004-2010 Fluxus
Technologies Ltd.). PAUP NJ analysis were carried out
based on both mean character difference in number of
polymorphic fragments and genetic distances [40]. Question marks were fitted by the program, either as present
or absent fragments, in order to minimize tree length
(lowest mean character difference or shortest genetic distance). Jack knife support was obtained with 37% character deletion [41] with 1000 replicates, "emulate jacresampling" and random number seed. Bootstrap was set
with 100 character resampling. The Danish genotype of
E. canadensis was used as the outgroup for the NZ samples. For E.densa and L. major the NJ trees were calculated as unrooted phylograms.
The network of all maximum parsimonious trees was
constructed with the reduced median algorithm [42].
This algorithm, originally developed for binary matrices
obtained by haploid sequence data, could be used for
AFLP data because all characters could be entered with
the same weight which is possible when the number of
samples does not exceed 50. Question marks were processed by the program either as present or absent fragments to reach the shortest tree, estimated as lowest
number of mutations. Using a parsimony criterion, the
program introduces hypothetic missing haplotypes to the
network, represented as median vectors (nodes).
We used the program TFPGA also to calculate
UPGMA trees of the populations. Nei's genetic distances
(unbiased minimum genetic distances) are based on pairwise common DNA polymorphic fragments and similarities between populations can be assumed to reflect a
possible common vegetative origin and/or dispersal
opportunities between populations. Statistical support
was assessed with bootstrap analysis based on 1000 permutations and by changing the order of the samples several times in the data matrix, in order to alleviate the
taxon entry-order problems associated with UPGMA
method, as pointed out by Backeljau et al. [43].
