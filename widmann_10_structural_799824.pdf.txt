Structural classification by the Lipase Engineering
Database: a case study of Candida antarctica
lipase A
Michael Widmann, P Benjamin Juhl, Jürgen Pleiss*

Abstract
Background: The Lipase Engineering Database (LED) integrates information on sequence, structure and function of
lipases, esterases and related proteins with the a/b hydrolase fold. A new superfamily for Candida antarctica lipase
A (CALA) was introduced including the recently published crystal structure of CALA. Since CALA has a highly
divergent sequence in comparison to other a/b hydrolases, the Lipase Engineering Database was used to classify
CALA in the frame of the already established classification system. This involved the comparison of CALA to similar
structures as well as sequence-based comparisons against the content of the LED.
Results: The new release 3.0 (December 2009) of the Lipase Engineering Database contains 24783 sequence
entries for 18585 proteins as well as 656 experimentally determined protein structures, including the structure of
CALA. In comparison to the previous release [1] with 4322 protein and 167 structure entries this update represents
a significant increase in data volume. By comparing CALA to representative structures from all superfamilies, a
structure from the deacetylase superfamily was found to be most similar to the structure of CALA. While the
a/b hydrolase fold is conserved in both proteins, the major difference is found in the cap region. Sequence
alignments between both proteins show a sequence similarity of only 15%. A multisequence alignment of both
protein families was used to create hidden Markov models for the cap region of CALA and showed that the cap
region of CALA is unique among all other proteins of the a/b hydrolase fold. By specifically comparing the
substrate binding pocket of CALA to other binding pockets of a/b hydrolases, the binding pocket of Candida
rugosa lipase was identified as being highly similar. This similarity also applied to the lid of Candida rugosa lipase in
comparison to the potential lid of CALA.
Conclusion: The LED serves as a valuable tool for the systematic analysis of single proteins or protein families. The
updated release 3.0 was used for the evaluation of a/b hydrolases. The HTML version of the database with new
features is available at http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de and provides sequences, structures and a set of analysis tools
including phylogenetic trees and HMM profiles

Background
Lipases (triacylglycerol hydrolases E.C. 3.1.1.3) are a versatile group of enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis or
synthesis of a broad range of water insoluble esters.
They belong to the class of a/b-hydrolases which also
contains esterases, acetylcholinesterases, cutinases, carboxylesterases and epoxide hydrolases. Despite their high
diversity in sequence and function, the a/b-hydrolases
share a common architecture, the a/b-hydrolase fold [2]

and conserved active site signatures, the GxSxG and
GxDxG motifs [3,4]. Two conserved features found in all
a/b-hydrolases are the active site, consisting of the catalytic triad of S-D(E)-H, and the oxyanion hole. Depending on the amino acids involved in forming the oxyanion
hole, the enzymes can be classified into three classes, the
GGGX-, GX-, and the Y-class [3]. The Lipase Engineering Database (LED) [5] is a resource of fully and consistently annotated superfamilies and homologous families
of a/b hydrolases including multisequence alignments of
all families. The curation and annotation process for the
LED is supported by DWARF [1], an inhouse data

de. It can be browsed on the level of families, organisms,
or structures, and BLAST searches can be performed
against all sequence entries.
Prominent members of the a/b hydrolases are the two
lipases from Candida antarctica. Lipase B is a versatile
and well characterized biocatalyst in many organic
syntheses and biotransformations [6-8] and shows a low
sequence similarity to other a/b hydrolases. The second
lipase from Candida antarctica, lipase A (CALA), shows
a number of unique biocatalytic properties among
hydrolases, e.g. high thermostability and stability at
acidic pH ranges and the acceptance of tertiary and
sterically hindered alcohols [9]. CALA also has a low
sequence similarity to other members of the a/b hydrolase fold including lipase B. Therefore it was not
included in previous versions of the LED. Only after its
structure was recently determined [10], a detailed analysis of its structure identified CALA unambiguously as a
member of the a/b hydrolase family. However, in this
structure the active site is not accessible to a substrate,
therefore the molecular details of substrate binding or
the existence of a possible lid are still elusive.

Results
Database content and layout

Release 3.0 of the Lipase Engineering Database (LED)
contains 18585 proteins with 24783 sequence and 656
structure entries of which about 14000 protein and 489
structure entries are new. Six new homologous families
and one new superfamily (the “Candida antarctica lipase
A like” superfamily) have been added to the LED in the
update process. Seed sequences for the new “Candida
antarctica lipase A like” superfamily (LED identifier:
abH38) included the sequence from the resolved crystal
structure (gi: 160286179) and three sequences of homologous lipases from other organisms (Kurtzmanomyces
sp. - gi: 20429169, Malassezia furfur - gi: 73765555,
Ustilago maydis - gi: 71018653) which showed high
sequence similarity to Candida antarctica lipase A
(CALA) [10]. Most of the sequences of the superfamily
abH38 have already been assigned to a common protein
family in other protein family databases. In the Pfam
database [11] they are included in the LIP (PF03583)
family, in the InterPro database [12] in the family
IPR005152, and in the ESTHER [13] database in the
Fungal-Bact_LIP family. Because we included only
sequences of high sequence similarity to guarantee a
good alignment of all sequences of individual families,
especially of active site residues, our family abH38 contains less sequences than the respective protein families
of the other databases. The four largest superfamilies in
release 3.0 contain 50% of all proteins in the LED: The

“Cytosolic Hydrolases” superfamily (LED identifier:
abh08) with 3188 proteins, containing epoxide hydrolases and haloalkane dehalogenases, the “Carboxylesterases” superfamily (LED identifier: abh01) with 2998
proteins, containing a wide range of carboxylesterases,
such as acetylcholine esterases and bile salt activated
lipases, the “Moraxella lipase 2 like” superfamily (LED
identifier: abh04) with 1781 proteins containing mainly
lipases and carboxylesterases, and the “Microsomal
Hydrolases” superfamily (LED identifier: abh09) with
1336 proteins, containing microsomal epoxide hydrolases and peptidases. The “Cytosolic Hydrolases” and
“Microsomal Hydrolases” superfamilies (abh08 and
abh09) belong to the GX-class of a/b hydrolases, the
“Carboxylesterases” and “Moraxella lipase 2 like” superfamilies (abh01 and abh04) belong to the GGGX-class
of a/b hydrolases.
Candida antarctica lipase A protein family

The “Candida antarctica lipase A like” superfamily contains one crystal structure and 39 sequences, assigned to
32 proteins. They were grouped into four homologous
families based on sequence similarity. Homologous
families were named by the organism of origin of the
dominating proteins in the respective family (Figure 1):
The “Candida antarctica lipase A like” homologous
family consisting of Lipase A from C. antarctica, the
“Malassezia lipase like” homologous family consisting
entirely of lipases and esterases from Malassezia globosa
or Malassezia furfur, the “Candida albicans lipase like”
homologous family consisting of various isoforms of the
secretory lipase from Candida albicans, and the “Aspergillus lipase like” homologous family consisting mainly
of hypothetical or putative lipases, mostly from Aspergillus. All 32 proteins are from organisms belonging to the
subkingdom Dikarya of the kingdom Fungi. 12 proteins
are classified as either lipases or esterases in GenBank
[14] while 20 proteins are classified as putative or
hypothetical. The only structure entry in this superfamily is from the recently resolved crystal structure of
CALA [10]. Based on the structure of the oxyanion
hole, CALA can be classified as a Y-class lipase, and Tyr
93 was identified as the oxyanion hole forming amino
acid. A structural comparison with other structures
from the LED identified a structure from the deacetylase
superfamily (LED identifier: abH26) as most closely
related. A detailed structural alignment of CALA (PDB:
2VEO) with the structure of the Bacillus subtilis deacetylase (PDB: 1L7A) from the deacetylase superfamily
showed a superimposition of the common a/b hydrolase
fold including the catalytic triad (2VEO: Ser184, Asp334,
His366; 1L7A: Ser181, Asp269, His298), despite having a
low overall sequence identity of only 15%. Structural differences between the two structures are found in the

cap and the C-terminal region. The cap region, located
between b-strands 6 and 7, often confers substrate specificity or additional functions to the enzyme [15]. In
the case of CALA, the cap region is involved in forming
the tunnel like binding site for the acyl moiety [10]. For
B. subtilis deacetylase, the cap region partially shields
the active site from the solvent [16]. The cap region of
CALA consists of six a-helices, while the cap region of
B. subtilis deacetylase consists of only four a-helices
(Figure 2). Three a-helices in both proteins are found at
identical positions. CALA shows an insert of three additional a-helices after the first two conserved a-helices
and is missing the last a-helix of the cap present in B.
subtilis deacetylase (Figure 2). In order to identify residues in the cap region which are conserved between the
“Candida antarctica lipase A like” and “Deacetylases”
superfamilies, a multisequence alignment of each family
was performed. The two family alignments were aligned
using a structural alignment of the two protein

structures (Figure 3). The alignment demonstrated that
despite the high structural similarity, there are no conserved residues in the cap region of both protein
families. Two hidden Markov models of the three
inserted a-helices of CALA and the a-helices shared by
both proteins were created and used to search against
all other protein families of the LED. No sequences with
a significant similarity were found in the entire database,
demonstrating that the sequence of the cap region of
the “Candida antarctica lipase A like” superfamily is
unique.
In comparison to the B. subtilis deacetylase, CALA
has two additional b-strands (9 and 10) in the C-terminal region (Figure 2). They are positioned directly
above the active site and prevent a direct access of the
substrate to the active site. We assume that the
b-strands 9 and 10 perform a lid like function for CALA
since movement of the two b-strands would allow substrate access to the active site of CALA from a similar

direction as for the B. subtilis deacetylases [16]. A comparison of the substrate binding sites of both proteins
showed that the alcohol binding site is similar in both
proteins and provides ample space for alcohol moieties
of substrates (Figure 4). Therefore, both proteins are
expected to accept a variety of bulky alcohols. The binding sites for the acyl moieties are highly different. CALA
has a long, tunnel like binding site, while the B. subtilis
deacetylase has a small cavity which is part of a cleft on
the protein surface. Therefore, the acyl moieties of the
substrates are expected to differ significantly between
both enzymes. CALA is expected to accept mediumt to
long chain fatty acids, while the B. subtilis deacetylase is
limited to short-chain acyl moieties. Thus, despite the
overall similarity between CALA and the B. subtilis deacetylase, the acyl binding site is fundamentally different.
However, the binding site of CALA shows surprising
similarity to another lipase, Candida rugosa lipase
(CRL). For CRL, two different structural confirmations
have been resolved, an open conformation (1CRL) [17],
and a closed conformation (1TRH) [18] where the lid of
CRL is blocking the substrate access to the active site.

CRL has a cap region between b-strands 6 and 7, consisting of four a-helices (Figure 2). The substrate binding site of CRL consists of a long tunnel for the acyl
moiety of the substrate and provides ample space for
the alcohol moiety of the substrate (Figure 4). Despite
having a lower overall structure similarity to CALA than
the B. subtilis deacetylase, the binding sites of CALA
and CRL are highly similar (Figure 4). Both provide
space for large, bulky alcohol moieties of the substrate
and have a tunnel like binding site for the acyl moiety.
Both proteins posses a lid which covers the active site
and prevents direct access to the substrate binding site
in its closed state. The lid of CRL lipase is formed by a
a-helix between b-strands 1 and 2 and is located
in the N-terminal region while the putative lid in CALA
is formed by the two C-terminal b-strands 9 and 10
(Figure 2).

Discussion
The LED contains annotated and systematically classified protein families of a/b hydrolases. It has been
shown to be a useful tool for the systematic analysis of

protein families. Previous work employed the LED and
BLAST in order to identify novel enzymes belonging to
the a/b hydrolase fold [19,20]. A model for the prediction of protein solubility was developed and refined by
performing a comprehensive analysis of the protein
families of the LED [21]. A further study involved the
systematic analysis of protein families of the LED in
regard to the distribution and conservation of functionally relevant rare codons [22].
Since the first release of the LED [3], more than 14000
new a/b hydrolases became available and were integrated in the release 3.0. As a case study for the utility
of the highly enriched and annotated database, the
newly introduced superfamily of CALA was analysed
and compared to other protein structures in the LED.
The goal was to characterise the sequence and structure
of CALA in comparison to other a/b hydrolases despite
its low sequence similarity and to understand the molecular basis of substrate recognition.
While CALA shows structural similarity to the deacetylase family, the substrate specificity of both enzymes
differs, which is consistent with the differences observed
in the substrate binding sites of both proteins. In contrast, the lipase from C. rugosa (CRL), which shows a
lower overall structural similarity to CALA, is remarkably similar in regard to the substrate binding site. The
structural similarities and differences are in accordance
with experimentally observed substrate specificities of
the three enzymes. All three proteins have a spacious
alcohol binding site. The B. subtilis deacetylase accepts
a wide variety of bulky substrates like cephalosporin C
and xylose [16]. CALA and CRL also accept bulky substrates, ranging from primary alcohols to sterically hindered secondary alcohols and even tertiary alcohols
[23,24].
The tunnel like binding site of CALA allows the
enzyme to accept esters of long chain fatty acids [23,25].
The similar tunnel like acyl binding site of CRL also
accepts fatty acids up to a chain length of 18 [25]. In
contrast, the small acyl binding site of the B. subtilis
deacetylase is unable to accept large acyl groups and is
restricted towards acetyl moieties [16]. Experimentally,
CALA and CRL have been shown to display interfacial
activation [26,27]. While a lid in CRL has been localized
and the open and closed form of CRL has been crystallized ([17,18]), the lid function of the b-strands 9-10 in
CALA remains to be experimentally verified. However,
the similarities to CRL suggest a substrate access involving the movement of b-strands 9-10.

Conclusions
The analysis of the newly introduced protein family of
Candida antarctica lipase A demonstrates the strength
of our database approach by providing a large set of

Page 7 of 8

protein families which share a common protein fold
despite an overall low sequence similarity. By combining
both, structural and sequential information of a large
number of proteins a thorough analysis and classification of proteins of interest is made possible. The Lipase
Engineering Database (LED) is online accessible at
http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de. All information on
families of sequence and structure data, as well as alignments, phylogenetic trees, and family-specific profiles
can be accessed by manual download.

Methods
Structural comparisons and alignments

Comparison of structures were carried out using DALI
[28]. The structure of CALA was compared against 28
representative structures from all superfamilies. To identify the most closely related superfamilies, only structures which could be aligned to more than 50% of the
residues of CALA were considered. Structural alignments of proteins were performed by STAMP [29].
For superfamilies which share a close structural relationship but a low overall sequence identity, a two step
strategy was used in order to obtain a more significant
multisequence alignment. First, a multisequence alignment for each of the two superfamilies was carried out
separately. Then a structural alignment, between reference structures from each protein family was performed
using STAMP [29]. The multisequence alignments
where then aligned against the structure from their
respective protein family.
Sequence analysis

Multisequence alignments for all protein families were
generated using ClustalW [30] with a gap opening and
extension penalties of 10 and 0.2, respectively. Hidden
Markov models were created using HMMER [31].
Database model

The implemented data model is based on Firebird [32]
and is based on the previously published [1] data model
(Figure S1, Additional file 1). Protein families are organised on the level of homologous families and superfamilies based on their sequence similarity. The database
is updated by an automated Perl [33] script. It performs
a BLAST [34] search against the current version of the
non-redundant sequence database an NCBI [14] for
each sequence entry with an E-value cut-off of 10-50 .
Crystal structure information referring to new sequence
entries is updated as well. New sequence and structure
entries are assigned to homologous families and superfamilies based on sequence similarity. New families which
consisted of only one putative protein entry where not
included. Annotation information of residues is either
taken directly from the according GenBank entry or is

transferred to new sequences using the DWARF graphical user interface. Annotation information is then transferred to the newly integrated sequences.
