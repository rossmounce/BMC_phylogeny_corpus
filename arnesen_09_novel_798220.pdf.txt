Abstract
Background: Protein acetylation is among the most common protein modifications. The two
major types are post-translational Nε-lysine acetylation catalyzed by KATs (Lysine
acetyltransferases, previously named HATs (histone acetyltransferases) and co-translational Nαterminal acetylation catalyzed by NATs (N-terminal acetyltransferases). The major NAT complex
in yeast, NatA, is composed of the catalytic subunit Naa10p (N alpha acetyltransferase 10 protein)
(Ard1p) and the auxiliary subunit Naa15p (Nat1p). The NatA complex potentially acetylates Ser-,
Ala-, Thr-, Gly-, Val- and Cys- N-termini after Met-cleavage. In humans, the homologues hNaa15p
(hNat1) and hNaa10p (hArd1) were demonstrated to form a stable ribosome associated NAT
complex acetylating NatA type N-termini in vitro and in vivo.
Results: We here describe a novel human protein, hNaa16p (hNat2), with 70% sequence identity
to hNaa15p (hNat1). The gene encoding hNaa16p originates from an early vertebrate duplication
event from the common ancestor of hNAA15 and hNAA16. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass
spectrometry identified both endogenous hNaa15p and hNaa16p as distinct interaction partners of
hNaa10p in HEK293 cells, thus demonstrating the presence of both hNaa15p-hNaa10p and
hNaa16p-hNaa10p complexes. The hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex acetylates NatA type N-termini in
vitro. hNaa16p is ribosome associated, supporting its potential role in cotranslational Nα-terminal
acetylation. hNAA16 is expressed in a variety of human cell lines, but is generally less abundant as
compared to hNAA15. Specific knockdown of hNAA16 induces cell death, suggesting an essential
role for hNaa16p in human cells.
Conclusion: At least two distinct NatA protein Nα-terminal acetyltransferases coexist in human
cells potentially creating a more complex and flexible system for Nα-terminal acetylation as
compared to lower eukaryotes.

Background
About 80% of all mammalian proteins and 50% of yeast
proteins are estimated to be cotranslationally acetylated at
their N-termini [1-6]. This clearly makes N-terminal
acetylation one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotic cells. In yeast, three complexes, NatA,
NatB and NatC, express different substrate specificities
and are responsible for the majority of N-terminal acetylation [6]. At present, the nomenclature of this class of
enzymes is not coherent and later this year a revised
nomenclature of this enzyme class will be presented
(Polevoda B, Arnesen T and Sherman F, unpublished). In
brief, for the proteins mentioned in this study the following names will apply: Naa10p (Ard1), Naa11p (Ard2),
Naa15p (Nat1), Naa16p (Nat2) and Naa50p (Nat5). The
yeast NatA complex contains the structural subunit
Naa15p mediating ribosome association and the catalytic
subunit Naa10p [7,8]. Deletion of yNAA15 and yNAA10
results in a number of common defects including lack of
Go entry, reduced cell growth, and inability to sporulate
[9-11]. The subunit Naa50p is also physically associated
with Naa10p and Naa15p, but the function of hNaa50p is
unknown [7]. The human NatA, NatB and NatC complexes were recently characterized [12-15]. The human
NatA complex contains the human homologues of the
yeast NatA components hNaa10p, hNaa15p and
hNaa50p [13,16]. The function and substrate specificity
of hNatA in vivo and in vitro were found to resemble that
of the yeast NatA complex [1]. The yeast NAA10 gene is
duplicated in mammals. In humans, the NAA10 duplication has lead to the generation of a novel protein designated hNaa11p [17]. Similarly to hNaa10p, hNaa11p
potentially interacts with hNaa15p implying that two distinct NatA complexes may exist in human cells: both
hNaa15p-hNaa10p and hNaa15p-hNaa11p [17]. However, an endogenous hNaa15p-hNaa11p complex has not
yet been detected, thus the functional importance of
hNaa11p remains to be elucidated. hNaa10p and
hNaa15p were previously demonstrated to be important
for normal cellular viability. RNA interference-mediated
knockdown of hNAA10 or hNAA15 induced apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest in human cell lines [18-20], thus
hNaa10p has been proposed to be a novel cancer drug target [21]. On the other hand, it has also been reported that
hNaa10p is essential for the induction of apoptosis since
knockdown of hNaa10p protected cells against doxorubicin induced apoptosis [22].
In order to identify novel interaction partners of
hNaa10p, we performed immunoprecipitation of
hNaa10p from HEK293 cells, followed by trypsin digestion of immunoprecipitated proteins and peptide analysis
by mass spectrometry. We here demonstrate the existence
of an endogenous hNaa16p protein, encoded by a human
paralogue of the hNAA15 gene representing a new ortho-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/15

logue of the yeast NAA15 gene. hNAA16 mRNA is generally expressed in human cells. The hNaa16p protein
associates with ribosomes, and interacts with hNaa10p to
form a novel human NatA complex.

Results
Identification of hNaa16p and the hNaa16p-hNaa10p
complex
We used an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry
approach to identify novel interaction partners of
hNaa10p. Endogenous hNaa10p was collected from
HEK293 cell extracts using a hNaa10p-specific antibody.
The immunoprecipitates were analysed by LC/MS/MS
after trypsin digestion. In addition to hNaa10p, hNaa15p
and hNaa50p [13,16], we identified a novel protein,
hNaa16p (hNat2/Entrez gene official symbol: NARG1L),
in each of four parallel affinity extractions obtained using
anti-hNaa10p. Both hNaa15p and hNaa16p were identified by several unique peptides. Neither hNaa10p nor
hNaa15p nor hNaa16p were present in four negative controls using unspecific immunoglobulins. The identified
hNaa15p and hNaa16p specific peptides are presented in
Figure 1 and in Additional File 1. The MS/MS spectra of
two of these peptides, RAIELATTLDESLTNR (uniquely
identifying hNaa15p) and DLESFNEDFLK (uniquely
identifying hNaa16p) are shown in Figure 2. From the
alignments (Figure 1 and Additional File 2) it is obvious
that the two proteins hNaa15p and hNaa16p are highly
similar. According to NCBI bl2seq [23], hNaa15p and
hNaa16p share 70% identity and 85% similarity at the
amino acid level. In Figure 3, hNaa15p and hNaa16p
structural domains as identified by SMART [24] are presented. Both proteins contain several Tetratricopeptide
(TPR) domains which are degenerate 34 amino acids
repeats containing a helix-loop-helix presumed to be
involved in protein-protein interactions. hNaa15p is predicted to contain 4 TPRs while hNaa16p is predicted to
have 5 TPRs. This difference results from program threshold values chosen, and since both proteins are highly similar in this region, it is likely that also hNaa15p may have
a fifth TPR domain in the same region. Both proteins contain coiled-coil domains (Figure 3). Also the exon-intron
organisation for the two genes is highly similar (Figure 3).

The interaction between hNaa16p and hNaa10p appears
to be independent of the hNaa15p-hNaa10p complex
since hNaa16p-specific peptides were not present in antihNaa15p immunoprecipitates analysed in parallel. Since
both hNaa15p and hNaa16p interact with hNaa10p, it is
of interest to determine the approximate ratio of hNaa15p
versus hNaa16p in complex with hNaa10p. To make a
rough and qualitative estimate of the amounts of
hNaa15p and hNaa16p complexed with hNaa10p, the
protein abundance index [25] was calculated for each protein as the number of LC/MS/MS-observed tryptic pep-

tides (unique to each protein) divided by the total
number of tryptic peptides that could be identified by
SEQUEST under the exact search conditions used. For
hNaa15p, this number was 0.0858, while for hNaa16p it
was 0.0138. hNaa15p-hNaa10p complexes thus appear to
be roughly 6-fold more abundant than hNaa16phNaa10p complexes in HEK293 cells. As an additional
verification of the hNaa16p-hNaa10p interaction, we
expressed tagged hNaa16p-FLAG and hNaa10p-V5 in
HeLa cells and demonstrated that hNaa16p-FLAG was coimmunoprecipitated with hNaa10p-V5 (Figure 4A). In
conclusion, these observations clearly support the presence of an endogenous hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex in
human cells. Furthermore, we also wanted to test whether
hNaa16p could interact with hNaa11p, since the latter
protein is very similar to hNaa10p. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments using hNaa16p-FLAG and
hNaa11p-V5, demonstrated that this indeed is the case
(Figure 4B).
Expression of hNAA15 and hNAA16 in human cell lines
To investigate the expression of these two human homologues of the yeast NAA15 gene, we analysed the expression of hNAA15 and hNAA16 mRNA by quantitative RTPCR in 10 human cell lines of various origin (Figure 5A)
and 10 human cell lines originating from the thyroid
gland (Figure 5B). Both genes are highly expressed in
HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), HEK293 (kidney adenocarcinoma), and SK-MEL2 (malignant melanoma) cell
lines. Our results demonstrate that hNAA16 is expressed
in all cell lines analyzed, and hNAA15 is the most abundant species of the two. The expression level of hNAA15
mRNA is 2–3 times than that of hNAA16 mRNA in cell
lines like TAD-2 and HepG2, while it is 7–11 times more
abundant in GaMG, SK-N-MC, HeLa, and B-CPAP cells.
Interestingly, in HEK293 cells, hNAA15 mRNA is 5 times
more abundant as compared to hNAA16 mRNA.
Although there is not necessarily a direct relationship
between the level of a specific mRNA and the level of the
corresponding protein, this agrees with our rough estimates that hNaa15p-hNaa10p complexes appear to be 6fold more abundant than hNaa16p-hNaa10p complexes
in HEK293 cells, thus suggesting that the level of the various NatA complexes present is proportional to the presence of their single subunits. Tissue expression profiles for
hNAA15 and hNAA16 mRNA also indicate that hNAA15
mRNA is generally more abundant as compared to
hNAA16 (NCBI-UNIGENE-EST PROFILE VIEWER). However, in certain tissues like adrenal gland, mammary
gland, heart, testis and thymus, hNAA16 appears to be the
dominant species (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Uni
Gene/ESTProfileViewer.cgi?uglist=Hs.715706
and
http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/ESTProfileV
iewer.cgi?uglist=Hs.512914). Previously, it was demonstrated that hNAA15 was overexpressed in papillary thy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/15

roid carcinomas as compared to non-neoplastic thyroid
tissue [26,27]. The current data support these observations since hNAA15 is slightly or significantly overexpressed in all types of thyroid cancer cell lines tested as
compared to the primary thyroid cells (TAD-2/Nthy ori
3.1): follicular thyroid carcinoma (CGTH-W-1), papillary
thyroid carcinoma (NPA/B-CPAP/ONCO-DG-1/BHT101) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (8305C/CAL-62/
ARO) (Figure 5B). On the other hand, we are not able to
make similar conclusions with respect to hNAA16 which
appears to be expressed equally in tumour- and nontumour thyroid cell lines.
Evolution of the hNAA16 gene
The hNAA15 gene (Entrez gene official symbol: NARG1)
is located to chromosome 4 (4q31.1) while the hNAA16
gene (Entrez gene official symbol: NARG1L) is located to
chromosome 13 (13q14.11). hNaa15p and hNaa16p
belong to a protein family with members in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster, fish, frog and several higher mammals (Family ENSF00000002142 from Ensembl v38,
April 2006 [see methods]). The phylogenetic tree of this
family (Figure 6) suggests that the duplication that
resulted in hNAA15 and hNAA16 occurred at some point
after the speciation that resulted in the higher chordates
(i.e. after the divergence of Ciona), but before the speciation of mammals into eutheria and metatheria. The exact
timing is confused by Ciona branching before Drosophila,
and by the fish (zebrafish, fugu, tetraodon) appearing in
only the NAA15 clade (possibly suggesting loss of NAA16
in fish). The duplication therefore occurred before the
duplication that resulted in hNAA10 and hNAA11, which
we previously narrowed down to some time shortly after
the divergence of eutheria and metatheria [17].

Additional File 2 presents an alignment of hNaa15p and
hNaa16p protein sequences from human, mouse, and
opossum, together with their homologues from Ciona,
zebrafish and yeast. With the exception of the yeast protein, the sequences are highly similar until approximately
100 residues from their C-termini. The similarity of the
zebrafish protein to the Naa15ps rather than the Naa16ps
is obvious from the alignment.
hNaa16p associates with ribosomes and hNaa16phNaa10p acetylates NatA-type N-termini in vitro
The characterized hNaa15p-hNaa10p hNatA complex
interacts with ribosomes [13] and N-terminally acetylates
polypeptides with Ser-, Ala-, Thr-, Val- and Gly- N-termini
[1]. Analyses of isolated polysomes demonstrated that
hNaa16p-FLAG, as well as hNaa15p and hNaa10p, were
both present in the polysomal and the soluble fractions
(Figure 7) supporting a model where hNaa16p dynamically associates with ribosomes, and is involved in

Phylogenetic tree of NAA15 genes
Phylogenetic tree of NAA15 genes. A phylogenetic tree showing that the duplication leading to hNAA15 and hNAA16
occurred at some point after the divergence of Ciona from the other chordates, and before the speciation that resulted in the
amphibia. This is before the duplication resulting in the NAA10s [17]. All identifiers are from Ensembl. Branches highlighted with
a black dot are those where the probability of the split represented by the branch is > 0.95. Probable NAA15 and NAA16 clades
are indicated. In-paralogues in this tree represent alternative transcripts, which are possibly artefacts of the genome annotation. See Methods for details.

cotranslational Nα-terminal acetylation. To assess
whether the hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex expresses acetyltransferase activity, we performed in vitro N-terminal
acetyltransferase assays using immunoprecipitated
hNaa16p-hNaa10p and synthetic oligopeptides as substrates. A synthetic oligopeptide representing an
acetylated protein N-terminus in HeLa cells, SESS-, was
acetylated in vitro by hNaa16p-hNaa10p, while an oligopeptide representing an N-terminus not acetylated in
HeLa cells, SPTP-, carrying an inhibitory Pro in the second
position [1], is not efficiently acetylated in vitro (Figure 8).
These results suggest that hNaa16p-hNaa10p and
hNaa15p-hNaa10p have overlapping substrate specificities, since also the hNaa15p-hNaa10p complex showed a
similar in vitro reactivity towards these peptides [1]. It
should be noted, however, that in order to properly define
the substrate specificity of the hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex, a more comprehensive approach is required.
hNAA16 knockdown downregulates hNaa10p and
induces cell death
Previously, we demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of hNAA10 or hNAA15 induced apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest in human cell lines [18]. Using siRNA pools
specific for hNAA15 and hNAA16, we knocked down
either gene in HeLa cells. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that both siRNA pools specifically reduced the
expression of the targeted gene (Figure 9A). Western blot-

ting analysis of cell lysates harvested 72 hours post siRNAtransfection showed, as expected, that only sihNAA15, not
sihNAA16, reduced the protein levels of hNaa15p (Figure
9B). On the other hand, all three siRNAs sihNAA15,
sihNAA16 and sihNAA10 significantly reduced protein
levels of hNaa10p. The dependency of hNaa10p for
hNaa15p has previously been described [26,28], but the
present results also indicate that a fraction of endogenous
hNaa10p depend on hNaa16p for stability, albeit to a
lesser extent as compared hNaa15p. This is in agreement
with the relative presence of hNaa15p-hNaa10p versus
hNaa16p-hNaa10p complexes described above.
Knockdown of hNAA10 and hNAA15 induces apoptosis
in HeLa cells [18], and in the case of these cells, we demonstrated that hNAA16 knockdown reduced cell viability
at comparable levels to hNAA15 knockdown as determined by a WST-1 assay (Figure 10A). In order to investigate this phenotype, we analysed knockdown cells by live
microscopy and observed the appearance of dead cells:
cells detaching from monolayer had characteristic features
of apoptosis (condensation of nucleus, shrinking of cytoplasm, formation of apoptotic bodies). Furthermore, by
Hoechst staining we observed a significant increase of pycnotic nuclei in hNAA15 and hNAA16 knockdown cells as
compared to control cells (Figure 10B). A similar observation was made using a TUNEL assay to detect DNA fragmentation further supporting that knockdown of

N-terminal acetyltransferase activity of the hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex. HeLa cells were transfected with
phNAA16-FLAG and phNAA10-V5, and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (+) or a negative control antibody (-). The immunoprecipitated hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex was subjected to an in vitro N-acetylation assay by the addition of acetylation buffer,
a synthetic oligopeptide, [14-C]-Acetyl coenzyme A. The radioactivity incorporated into the peptide was determined by scintillation counting. The peptides used are [H]SESSSKSRWGRPVGRRRRPVRVYP [OH] (SESS) and [H]SPTPPLFRWGRPVGRRRRPVRVYP [OH] (SPTP). An equal level of immunoprecipitated material (input enzyme) was verified by Western-blotting
analysis. Results are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments.

hNAA16 induces cell death, most likely apoptosis (Figure
11).

Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis provides strong support for a vertebrate gene duplication resulting in the two copies of the
NAA15 gene, possibly followed by loss of the second copy
in fish. The presence of hNaa16p specific peptides in four
of four parallel anti-hNaa10p immunoprecipitates is a
strong indication of the presence of endogenous hNaa16p
protein and of the presence of hNaa16p-hNaa10p complexes. Both hNaa15p and hNaa16p are orthologues of
the yeast Naa15p. The simultaneous presence of hNaa15p
and hNaa16p in anti-hNaa10p immunoprecipitates, and
the lack of hNaa16p in anti-hNaa15p immunoprecipi-

tates, indicate that hNaa15p-hNaa10p and hNaa16phNaa10p make distinct NatA complexes in the cells.
Recently, we also demonstrated the presence of a second
human orthologue of the yeast NAA10 gene [17]. Thus,
two human orthologues of the yeast Naa10p protein exist,
hNaa10p and hNaa11p. However, to date there is no evidence of the presence of endogenous complexes consisting of hNaa11p and hNaa15p or hNaa16p. In mouse, two
homologues of yeast NAA15, mNAA15 and mNAA16
(named mNAT1 and mNAT2), were detected at the
mRNA level [29]. In this study, mNAA16 (mouse homologue of hNAA16) was found to be expressed at a lower
level as compared to mNAA15 (mouse homologue of
hNAA15), in agreement with our results suggesting that
hNAA15 is the dominant species as compared to hNAA16.

Knockdown of hNAA16 downregulates hNaa10p. (A) HeLa cells cultured in 6 cm dishes were transfected with 50 nM
unspecific (Ctr), hNAA15 or hNAA16 siRNAs. ZVAD-fmk (5 μM) was added 24 hours post transfection to prevent any induction of apoptosis. After 48 hours total RNA was isolated and processed by RT-PCR with specific primers to hNAA15, hNAA16
and β-actin. (B) HeLa cells cultured in 6 cm dishes were transfected with 50 nM unspecific (Ctr), hNAA15, hNAA16 or hNAA10
siRNAs. ZVAD-fmk (5 μM) was added 24 and 48 hours post transfection to prevent any induction of apoptosis. After 72 hours
cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. The membrane was incubated with anti-hNaa10p, anti-hNaa15p and
anti-β-tubulin. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Protein levels were quantified using FUJIFILM IR LAS 1000 and Image Gauge 3.45. Protein levels in siCtr (-) samples were set to 1.0 and protein levels in sihNAA15,
sihNAA16 or sihNAA10 treated cells were estimated relative to this and normalized to β-tubulin levels.

Despite the lower abundance of hNAA16 mRNA as compared to hNAA15 mRNA, we find that hNAA16 is generally expressed in a number of human cell lines (Figure 5)
and that knockdown of hNAA16 induces apoptosis (Figure 11), thus suggesting an important role for this novel
gene. Whether the hNAA16 knockdown phenotype is
resulting from lack of N-terminally acetylated hNaa16phNaa10p substrates or whether it is coupled to another
unknown function of hNaa16p remains to be investigated.

Conclusion
In summary, we have identified hNaa16p, a novel
hNaa10p interactor. hNaa16p and hNaa10p most likely
represent a novel human NatA complex complementing
the role of the hNaa15p-hNaa10p complex in protein Nαterminal acetylation in human cells. The fact that hNAA16
is widely expressed and that hNAA16 knockdown induces
apoptosis points to hNaa16p as an essential human protein.

Methods
Cell culture and transfection
HEK293 cells (embryonal kidney, ATCC CRL-1573) and
HeLa cells (human cervix carcinoma, DSMZ no. ACC 57)
were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 3% l-glutamine. Plasmid transfection
was performed using Fugene6 (Roche) according to the
manufacturers instructions. Plasmid expressing hNaa16p
(NARG1L)-FLAG was purchased from Origene

were incubated in TUNEL Label reaction without enzyme.
Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry
Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry were essentially performed as previously described [13], but omitting the crosslinking of antibodies to Protein AG Agarose
beads. Rabbit polyclonal peptide specific antibodies
against hNaa15p (anti-NATH) and hNaa10p (antihARD1) were produced by Biogenes GmBH. The immunogens correspond to amino acids 853–866 of hNaa15p
and amino acids 204–217 of hNaa10p. Anti-hNaa10p
does not crossreact with hNaa11p since these two proteins
are significantly different in the antibody binding region
[17]. A Thermofinnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus and an Agilent
1100 Nanoflow hplc were used for microcapillary LC/MS/
MS analysis of tryptic peptides. Data analysis utilized
SEQUEST [30], Medusa [31] and support vector machine
learning [32]. Approximately 5 × 107 HEK293 cells were
used per sample. Four samples were immunoprecipitated
in parallel using anti-hNaa15p, four samples using antihNaa10p and four samples were immunoprecipitated
using rabbit Ig (DAKO) as negative controls. Peptides
present in the negative controls were subtracted from the
peptides present in the anti-hNaa15p and anti-hNaa10p
samples using Medusa [31].
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Approximately 2 × 106 cells were harvested for each sample. Cells were lysed in 300 μl IPH lysis buffer (50 mM Tris
pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 1 mM Pefabloc (Roche)) and incubated for 5
minutes on ice. Cell membranes and organelles were
removed by centrifugation at 15700 × g for 30 seconds,
and the cell lysate was transferred to a new tube. To
remove proteins that bind unspecifically to the agarose
beads, Protein A/G Agarose (Santa Cruz) was added, and
the lysate was incubated on a roller for 30 minutes at 4°C.
The beads were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for
4 minutes. The cell lysate was then incubated with 2 μg
specific antibody on a roller for 1 – 4 hours at 4°C, before
adding 50 μl Prot A/G Agarose beads. The lysate was then
incubated on a roller at 4°C for 4 – 10 hours. The beads
were collected by centrifuging as above, and washed with
1 × PBS. The supernatant was removed, and the samples
were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western
Blotting as described [21]. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies
against hNaa10p and hNaa15p described previously [13],
were used at 1:500 dilution, anti-V5 (Invitrogen) at
1:2000, anti-FLAG (Sigma) at 1:2000. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse and anti-rabbit were from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, Bucks., U.K.).

In vitro Nα-acetyltransferase assay
HEK293 cells were transfected by plasmids as described
above and indicated in Figure 8, harvested and lysed in
300 μl IPH lysis buffer. Typically, 5 × 106 cells were used.
40 μl Protein A/G Agarose (Santa Cruz) was added to the
lysates and incubated for one hour at 4°C. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min, the supernatants were collected and incubated for another 2 hours at 4°C with antiFLAG or unspecific antibody (2 μg). The samples were
centrifuged as above and 50 μl Protein A/G Agarose was
added to the supernatants. After incubation for 16 hours,
centrifugation and three times of washing in 2 × PBS and
once in acetylation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1
mM DTT, 800 μM EDTA, 10 mM Na-butyrate, 10% Glycerol), the samples were subjected to an in vitro acetylation
assay. 10 μl peptide (0.5 mM, custom made peptides from
Biogenes), 4 μl [14C] Acetyl-CoA (50 μCi, 2.07 GBq/
mmol, GE Healthcare) and 250 μl acetylation buffer was
added to pellets of Protein A/G-Agarose bound hNaa16pFLAG-hNaa10p-V5 complexes. The mixture was incubated for 2 hours at 37°C with rotation. After centrifugation the supernatant was added to 250 μl SP Sepharose
(50% slurry in 0.5 M acetic acid, Sigma) and incubated on
a rotor for 5 min. The mixture was centrifuged and the pellet was washed three times with 0.5 M acetic acid and
finally with methanol. Radioactivity in the peptide-containing pellet was determined by scintillation counting.
All custom made peptides contains 7 unique amino acids
at the N-terminus, since these are the major determinants
for N-terminal acetylation. The next 17 amino acids are
identical to the ACTH peptide (corticotrophin amino acid
1–24) sequence to maintain a positive charge facilitating
peptide solubility and effective isolation by cation
exchange Sepharose beads. The ACTH derived lysines
were replaced by arginines to minimize any potential
interference by Nε-acetylation. Peptide sequence information: High mobility group protein A1 (P17096): [H]SESSSKSRWGRPVGRRRRPVRVYP [OH], THO complex

Isolation of polysomes
Total ribosome isolation was performed as a modification
of previously described methods [33,34]. Approximately
2 × 107 HEK293 cells were used per experiment. Prior to
harvesting, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 5 minutes at 37°C. Cells were harvested,
and lysed with KCl ribosome lysis buffer (1.1% (w/v) KCl,
0.15% (w/v) triethanolamine, 0.1% (w/v) magnesium
acetate, 8.6% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% (w/v) Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X100, 0.25% (v/v) Pefabloc), and
incubated on ice for 15 minutes. After removing nucleus
and membranes by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min,
700 μl cell lysate was ultracentrifuged at 436,000 × g for
25 minutes on a 0.4 ml pillow of 25% sucrose in KCl

ribosome lysis buffer using a MLA-130 rotor (Beckman,
Geneva, Switzerland). Pellets were resuspended in ribosome lysis buffer with the indicated KCl concentrations,
followed by ultracentrifugation as described above. Pellets were resuspended in KCl ribosome lysis buffer, and
prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.
RNA purification and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.
RNA was subsequently dissolved in DEPC-treated doubledistilled water. Single-strand cDNA was synthesized from
1 μg total RNA using Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and oligo(dT)15 primer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Real-time Quantitative PCR
Relative gene expression levels of hNAA15 and hNAA16
in thyroid cell lines and cell lines from different tissues
were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR).

To amplify hNAA15 and hNAA16 cDNA the following
primers were used: hNAA15 primer set 1 (forward
TTGGCACGTTTATGGCCTTCT and reverse CGTTTCCCTGTAACCCTCAAGA), hNAA15 primer set 2 (forward
TGTATGGAGGTATTGGAAGCC and reverse CTCTTCATATCCAGGAGGCAT); hNAA16 primer set 1 (forward TCTTCCAGACATTGTGAGCAAAG
and
reverse
AGGTAGCGTTACGTTTCAGAAAA) and hNAA16 primer
set 2 (forward CAAGATGATTCTGTCGAACCCA and
reverse AACGCTGCAAGAGTCCATATAC). For data normalization two reference genes were used independently:
large ribosomal protein P2, RpLP2 (GeneID: 6181) and
RNA polymerase II, RPol2 (GeneID: 5430). Primers for
amplification of reference genes were as following: RpLP2
(forward GACCGGCTCAACAAGGTTAT and reverse
CCCCACCAGCAGGTACAC); RPol2 (forward GCACCACGTCCAATGACAT and reverse GTGCGGCTGCTTCCATAA). Templates (equal amount of cDNA) and primers
were mixed with components from the LightCycler 480
SYBR Green I Master mix kit (Roche Applied Science).
Reactions in triplicate were carried out in the LightCycler
480 real-time PCR machine (Roche Applied Science)
under the following conditions: initial denaturation at
95°C for 5 min, and then 40 cycles of denaturation at
95°C for 10 s, annealing at 57°C for 10 s, and extension
at 72°C for 10 s. Melting curves were obtained to examine
the purity of amplified products. Absolute quantitation
data and CP values were obtained by analysis with LightCycler 480 Software 1.5 by 2nd derivative method. By the
use of plasmids encoding hNaa15p (phNAA15-V5His)
and hNaa16p (phNAA16-Flag), we could verify the specificity of the primers used. The relative amount of hNAA15/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/15

hNAA16 PCR in each sample was normalized to that of
RpLP2 PCR and RPol2 independently.
Alignment and tree building
Homologues to human hNaa15p and hNaa16p were
identified using them to search Ensembl version 38, April
2006 [35]. Ensembl peptide identifiers for hNaa15p and
hNaa16p
are
ENSP00000296543
and
ENSP000000368716/ENSP00000310683
respectively.
The two identifiers for hNaa16p represent two possible
alternative transcripts in the Ensembl genome annotation.
Both hNaa15p and hNaa16p are members of Ensembl
protein family ENSF00000002142. All the peptide
sequences from this family were aligned using Muscle
[36] with the default settings. Coding sequence alignments were produced by aligning the coding sequences
with reference to the alignment of the corresponding peptide sequences. A tree was built from the coding sequence
alignment using MrBayes [37] with different rates for transitions and transversions, and running for 250,000 generations. The first 100,000 generations were discarded as
burn-in, after which the likelihood scores had converged.
A consensus tree was built from the remaining 150,000
generations by sampling every 100th generation, and
summarising as a majority-rule consensus tree. The resultant unrooted tree was rooted by treating Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAA15 (identifier: YDL040C) as an outgroup.
Figure 6 was created with iTOL [38].
