Abstract
Background: 'Systems-wide' approaches such as microarray RNA-profiling are ideally suited to the study of the
complex overlapping responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, commercial microarrays are only
available for a limited number of plant species and development costs are so substantial as to be prohibitive for most
research groups. Here we evaluate the use of cross-hybridisation to Affymetrix oligonucleotide GeneChip® microarrays
to profile the response of the banana (Musa spp.) leaf transcriptome to drought stress using a genomic DNA (gDNA)based probe-selection strategy to improve the efficiency of detection of differentially expressed Musa transcripts.
Results: Following cross-hybridisation of Musa gDNA to the Rice GeneChip® Genome Array, ~33,700 gene-specific
probe-sets had a sufficiently high degree of homology to be retained for transcriptomic analyses. In a proof-of-concept
approach, pooled RNA representing a single biological replicate of control and drought stressed leaves of the Musa
cultivar 'Cachaco' were hybridised to the Affymetrix Rice Genome Array. A total of 2,910 Musa gene homologues with
a >2-fold difference in expression levels were subsequently identified. These drought-responsive transcripts included
many functional classes associated with plant biotic and abiotic stress responses, as well as a range of regulatory genes
known to be involved in coordinating abiotic stress responses. This latter group included members of the ERF, DREB,
MYB, bZIP and bHLH transcription factor families. Fifty-two of these drought-sensitive Musa transcripts were
homologous to genes underlying QTLs for drought and cold tolerance in rice, including in 2 instances QTLs associated
with a single underlying gene. The list of drought-responsive transcripts also included genes identified in publicly-available
comparative transcriptomics experiments.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that despite the general paucity of nucleotide sequence data in Musa and only
distant phylogenetic relations to rice, gDNA probe-based cross-hybridisation to the Rice GeneChip® is a highly promising
strategy to study complex biological responses and illustrates the potential of such strategies for gene discovery in nonmodel species.

Background
Bananas and plantains are large herbaceous monocots
from the genus Musa of the family Musaceae. The vast
majority of cultivated bananas are hybrids derived from
natural inter- and intraspecific crosses between two diploid wild species, Musa acuminata (designated by genome
A) and M. balbisiana (designated by genome B) [1]. These
diploid, triploid or tetraploid hybrids are of great economic importance in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America and Asia, where they are a staple food for an
estimated 400 million people. Although Musa spp. are
mainly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, rain
water supply is often far from uniform so that more or
less-pronounced dry seasons exist which have an impact
on fruit quality and yields. To date there have been few
comparative studies on Musa drought stress tolerance, but
field observations suggest that B-genome confers greater
tolerance to drought than the A-genome [2,3].
Plants display a wide range of overlapping responses to
biotic and abiotic stresses, and the diversity of physiological, biochemical and molecular strategies adopted during
adaptation to unfavourable environmental conditions
(including drought), creates particular problems for the
scientist wishing to study and understand them [4-6].
Non-biased, 'systems-wide' approaches such as transcriptomics and microarray RNA-profiling are well-suited to
the analysis of this type of problem and have provided
many insights into the pathways of (a)biotic stress
response and adaptation in a variety of model plant systems [7-11]. However, while cDNA and oligonucleotide
microarrays are now routinely used for transcriptomic
analyses in plants, the number of species for which commercial microarrays are available is very limited. For nonmodel plant species such as Musa where little sequence
information is available, microarray development costs
are so substantial as to be prohibitive for most groups
working in the area. However it has been recently demonstrated that commercially available high-density oligonucleotide microarrays from closely related, heterologous
species can be used to probe the transcriptomes of nonmodel plants. For example the Arabidopsis Affymetrix
ATH-1 Genome Array has been used to study the transcriptome of Brassicacea species such as Arabidopsis halleri
[12,13], Thlaspi caerulescens [14,15], Thelungiella halophila
[16,17], Brassica oleracea [18] and Brassica napus [19]. In
addition a tomato array has also been used to study fruit
ripening and development in tomato, aubergine and pepper [20], as well as in potato [21].
In spite of the economic and social importance of banana
and plantains and its relatively small haploid genome size
(amongst the monocots) of 560 - 600 Mbp [22,23], little
sequence information is publicly accessible. Available
published data includes the complete sequencing of two
BAC clones from a wild diploid banana cultivar [24], the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/436

analysis 6,252 BAC end-sequences [25] and recently the
sequencing of 13 BAC clones and the analysis of 17 BAC
clones collectively containing a total of 443 predicted
genes [26]. In addition, 5,292 unique foliar 24 bp transcript sequences were sequenced and identified in the cultivar Musa acuminata following SuperSAGE [27]. The only
transcriptomics study published to date however,
describes the creation of cDNA libraries from Musa plants
subjected to temperature stress. This lead to the identification of 2,286 high-quality sequences, of which 715 where
considered to be full-length cDNA clones representing a
set of 149 unique genes. [28]. The aim of the work presented here therefore was to determine the feasibility of
using commercial heterologous oligonucleotide microarrays to probe the Musa transcriptome in response to
drought stress in the relatively drought-tolerant Musa triploid cultivar 'Cachaco' (ABB genome composition). The
use of highly standardized, commercial Affymetrix GeneChips® arrays allows comparisons to be made with probeset data sets from other plant species and helps to reduce
cross-laboratory errors. Because of the phylogenetic relationship between target and probe, this work with Musa
necessarily involves cross-hybridising to species that are
evolutionarily much more distant than has previously
been attempted.
Clearly the success in identifying differentially-regulated
transcripts via cross-hybridisation depends on the degree
of similarity between the target and probe sequences.
With the Affymetrix GeneChip® Genome Array, the expression level of any one particular gene transcript is generally
calculated as the mean of the expression levels of the 11 16 perfect match (PM) 25 bp probe-pairs that make up the
'probe-set' for each individual transcript. Therefore inefficient hybridisation of transcripts from the test species of
interest to the GeneChip® target probes, due for example
to the presence of sequence polymorphisms, will affect
the overall signal calculated across a probe-set, reducing
the number of 'present' calls, and as a consequence the
mean strength of the signal for that transcript's probe-set
[14,29]. To eliminate non-hybridising probes, Hammond
et al, first carried out a cross-hybridisation with gDNA
from the test organism. The results allow a 'probe mask' to
be created by which weak- or non-hybridising probes can
be discarded without discarding the signal for the entire
probe-set for a particular transcript in subsequent analyses
[18]. The disadvantage of this method is that it can realistically only be used on microarray platforms that contain
multiple probes per gene. Applying it to arrays with only
one probe per gene (cDNA microarrays) will result in a
much lower number of genes for which expression levels
can be determined. An alternative approach is to create a
'Global Match File' or a list of 'highly reliable' GeneChip®
probe-sets for analysis based on alignment to EST-derived
clusters/singletons. This latter heterologous hybridisation
approach has been used to study cold-induced sweetening

gDNA cross-hybridisations and creation of probe mask

Each individual gene transcript on the Affymetrix Rice and
Arabidopsis ATH-1 GeneChip® microarray, is represented
by a set of eleven, 25 bp 'probe-pairs' that make up a
'probe-set', and it is the average hybridisation intensity
across this probe-set that is used to calculate expression
levels for that gene. To identify and eliminate oligonucleotide GeneChip® probes with low or no-hybridisation to
Musa transcripts, we used the gDNA probe-masking strat-

for important monocotolydenous crops, including maize,
wheat, barley and sugar cane, but the Affymetrix Rice
Genome Array contains many more probe-sets (~57,000),
and covers a larger portion of the transcriptome than these
other arrays.

Here we report on work to evaluate the use of commercial,
high-density Affymetrix Rice and Arabidopsis ATH-1 GeneChip® microarrays to analyse complex plant responses in
a distantly-related, non-model plant species. Using a
gDNA probe-based cross-hybridisation approach we were
able to rapidly profile the response of Musa transcriptome
to chronic drought stress, and to identify a range of structural and regulatory Musa gene-homologues previously
found to be associated with the water-deficit response in
other (model) plants. Further, despite the large phylogenetic difference between Musa target and the Rice or Arabidopsis probes, comparisons to publically available
transcriptome-profiling experiments identified a range of
common drought-responsive genes, supporting the
assigned Musa gene identities and descriptions. This
approach outlines the potential of this strategy for the
characterization of stress-resistance in banana and plantain varieties for which relatively little sequence information is currently available.

egy of Hammond et al [14,30]. Here, 'Cachaco' genomic
DNA (gDNA) was first hybridised to both the Arabidopsis
ATH-1 and the Rice GeneChip® Genome Array using
standard Affymetrix hybridisation protocols. From the
resultant gDNA cell intensity file (.cel) file, perfect match
probe-pairs showing a high hybridisation signal to Musa
gDNA were selected and probe masks (a chip definition
file, or .cdf file) then created to exclude non-hybridising
probe-pairs within each transcript probe-set. The hybridisation intensity threshold for probe exclusion is set arbitrarily and ranges from 0 (no probe selection) to 1000.
The minimum requirement for a probe-set to be called
'present' therefore is hybridisation to at least one probepair within that probe-set. [14,18]. The resultant probe
mask (.cdf) files are then used to analyze gene expression
levels following cross hybridisation of Musa RNA samples
to the GeneChip®. The influence of hybridisation intensity
thresholds on probe and probe-set retention for both the
ATH-1 and Rice Genome Arrays following cross hybridisation to Musa gDNA is shown in Figure 1

of potato tubers using the Affymetrix tomato microarray
[21], but its success depends on the availability of extensive EST sequences to create the Global Match File, and
these are not yet available for Musa. Interestingly, gDNAbased probe selection has recently been shown to also
improve the analysis of differentially expressed genes in
homologous species, again by accounting for the impact
of differences in the physical hybridisation characteristics
of individual probes on probe-set signal intensities
[18,30].

Following hybridisation of 'Cachaco' gDNA to the ATH-1
Genome Array, only 1,321 probe-sets were retained at a
CDF value of 0 (no filtering). This corresponds to ~5.7%
of the total available Arabidopsis transcriptome. However
at a CDF value of 500, 3,594 or 15.8% of the available
Arabidopsis transcriptome was retained. Unsurprisingly,
hybridisation of 'Cachaco' gDNA to the Rice Genome
Array produced far better results, with over 78,000 probepairs corresponding to over 36,000 probe-sets (64.4%)
being retained at a CDF value of 550. These results therefore broadly confirm the phylogenetic relationships
between Musa and either Arabidopsis or Oryza with current
estimates indicating that Musa and Oryza diverged at the
level of the order Zingiberalae some 65 Mya, while the
closest evolutionary link between Arabidopsis and Musa
occurs at the point that the eudicots diverged some 145 208 Mya [31]. Interestingly the existence of regions of
microsynteny between rice, Arabidopsis and Musa have
recentlybeen demonstrated [26]. For example, even
though Musa genes generally have a GC structure more
closely resembling rice than Arabidopsis, out of 443 Musa
predicted proteins, 268 and 224 had hits with an E-value
threshold of 1e-10 to rice and Arabidopsis respectively.
On the basis of the gDNA hybridisation results presented
here and the closer synteny of Musa gene sequences to rice
rather than Arabidopsis [26,31], transcriptomics experiments were carried out with the Rice GeneChip® array
rather than with the Arabidopsis ATH-1 GeneChip Array.
RNA hybridisations - measuring transcript abundance
The response of the Musa transcriptome to chronic
drought stress was examined by challenging Rice Genome
Arrays with 'Cachaco' foliar RNA, isolated and pooled
from plants subjected to either 3 weeks water-deficit con-

ditions or to control conditions, as described in 'methods'. The ability to detect differentially-expressed
transcripts depends upon the hybridisation intensity
threshold cut off values (CDF values) used to create the
probe mask (.cdf) files as summarised in Figure 2. As can
be seen, there is a significant loss in the number of probesets retained at higher CDF values, but the number of differentially-regulated genes identified is still greater than
when no probe-masking is used [14,18]. Indeed at the
optimum CDF value, over 40-fold more >2-fold droughtresponsive transcripts are identified than is the case without masking (CDF = 0).
As shown in Figure 2, the maximum number of differentially-expressed transcripts was detected using a CDF value
of 550. At this cut off level, a total of 5,292 (RMA normalized expression value >20) of the maximal 33,696 probesets hybridised to Musa RNA at levels above background
suggesting that ~16% of the available Musa genome was
being expressed at any one time. Based on a single biological replicate, 2,910 transcripts of these transcripts displayed a >2-fold difference in expression levels in
response to drought conditions, representing ~8% of the
total available transcriptome [see Additional file 1].
This value is similar to values reported in other transcriptomic studies of plant drought stress-responses. For example Talame et al [32] using a cDNA microarray found 173
barley genes out of the 1654 genes tested (~10%), to be
differentially regulated following 7 days dehydration
stress and Seki et al [33], found that 277 genes from a

9000

genes

As can be seen in Figure 1, the number of probes retained
decreases rapidly with increasing hybridisation intensity
threshold (CDF) values, while the number of probe-sets
(transcripts) retained decreases relatively slowly and only
at higher CDF values. As a result the number of probe-sets
retained for transcriptome analysis within a probe mask
file remains high, even as more probes are excluded. For
example after cross hybridisation to the Rice Genome
Array, a probe mask created at a CDF value of 550,
excludes 87.6% of the total PM probes, even though some
64.4% of the probe-sets are still represented by at least one
probe-pair and can be used for subsequent transcriptome
profiling. This is similar to the results obtained by Hammond et al following cross-hybridisation of B. Oleracea
and Thlaspi arvense sp. gDNA to the ATH-1 Genome Array
[14,18]. In our case the average number of probes present
per probe-set at an optimum CDF value of 550 was 2.0,
with a total of 16,416 probe-sets being represented by a
single probe-pair.

cDNA array of 7,000 genes (~4%), were drought-responsive in Arabidopsis. Clearly these responses are dependent
on the tissue, the severity and length of exposure to stress,
as well as the sampling time points [33,34].
Of the 2,910 differentially-regulated putative droughtresponsive transcripts detected, 1,671 were up-regulated
(57.4%), with the most responsive transcript (Affymetrix
probe-set ID Os.53488.1.S1_at; GenBank AK072922,
'expressed protein'), increasing 15.7-fold in relation to the
control. The remaining 1,239 (42.6%) transcripts were
down-regulated, with the transcript coding for a putative
chlorophyll a apoprotein (Affymetrix probe-set ID
Os.26751.1.S1_s_at; GenBank AK062299), being downregulated over 100-fold.
Gene Ontologies
The rice descriptions and annotations for these 2,910
drought-responsive Musa transcripts were obtained from

the list of Rice GeneChip® probe-set i.d.s using the HarvEST software available at http://www.harvest-web.org/.
From this list, 1,512 genes (54.9%) could also be assigned
an Arabidopsis annotation using the same software. These
Arabidopsis annotations were then used for gene ontology
(GO) classifications using the 'Gene Ontology' function at
the TAIR website http://www.Arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/
go/index.jsp. Results are summarised in table 1.
As shown in table 1, the distribution of >2-fold differentially-regulated transcripts between GO classes is similar
for both up- and down-regulated transcripts, with in both
cases the largest proportion (~67%) being represented by
'other biological', 'other metabolic' or 'other cellular'
groups. However in agreement with models for plant
water-deficit stress responses, there was a general up-regulation of genes involved in 'abiotic stress' responses,
'transport' and 'cell organisation and biogenesis', and a
down-regulation of transcripts associated with 'electron

transport and energy processes'. Of the functional genes,
137 (5.2%) were assigned to the group 'response to abiotic or biotic stimulus' and 85 (5.0%) to the category
'response to stress'.
Because of their potential importance for crop improvement programs, there is much interest in identifying regulatory genes such as transcription factors (TFs) which are
responsible for the coordinate regulation of the large gene
sets involved in stress response and adaptations. The
group of drought-responsive Musa transcripts included 72
genes (2.7%) involved in 'transcription' processes. Within
this group there are 8 members (homologues) of the AP2/
EREBP TF family, including two DREB family TFs (TAIR:
At1g19210, At1g78080). Members of this family have
been implicated both in the regulation of both dehydration and cold stress adaptation [35]. Additionally there
are homologues of 9 NAC-domain transcription factors
(TFs), as well as 4 bZIPs, 8 bHLHs and 7 MYB-domain TFs.
Again, members of these families have all been demonstrated to be involved in dehydration and/or temperaturestress-responsive gene expression and to have binding
sites in the promoter region of stress-inducible Arabidopsis
and/or rice genes - for reviews see [5,6,36]. In addition,
and in common with results from other groups, we also
observed the induction of TFs associated with biotic stress
responses including for example several up-regulated
members of the WRKY superfamily (TAIR:At5g56270,
At4g01720, At4g01250, At5g01900) a family of genes
known to be involved in the regulation of plant pathogen
responses and senescence - for review see [37]. The differential regulation of transcripts involved in both biotic and
abiotic stress-response pathways is a characteristic of plant
(drought) stress responses in part due to the role of stresshormone signalling in coordinating common, overlapping responses and can lead to the phenomenon of 'crosstolerance' [38,39]. For example the early gene responses
to both drought and salt stress are nearly identical, and
members of the DREB TF family are involved in the ABAindependent transduction of both drought and cold signals [4-6].
GOs for the list of Musa putative drought-responsive
genes were also assigned using the Genespring GX 7.3
software (Agilent Technologies, USA), based on Affymetrix NetAffx annotation http://www.affymetrix.com, the
HarvEST rice transcript annotations as well as the HarvEST
annotations for the equivalent Arabidopsis homologues.
From these data, the GO classes that were over-represented in response to drought stress relative to the entire
genome were identified. From this list of GO classes, the
expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and phenylpropanoid metabolism were amongst the classes most
greatly affected by drought conditions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/436

Visualising cellular responses to drought
To visualize the effects of drought stress in Musa on a cellular level, the Affymetrix Arabidopsis codes for the list of
>2-fold differentially expressed homologues on the Rice
GeneChip were used to run the 'MapMan' software [40].
Although only 1,430 of the 2,910 rice transcripts had an
Arabidopsis code, the results nonetheless generate an overview of Musa cellular responses to drought. As shown in
Figure 3, the Arabidopsis homologues of the droughtresponsive sensitive Musa transcripts map to a range of
pathways and functions consistent with plant abiotic
stress responses [see Additional file 2]. These include
'biotic' (bin = 20.1; p = 0.1908), 'abiotic stress' (bin =
20.2; p = 0.7611), 'hormone response', 'development'
(bin = 33; p = 0.5379) and 'cell wall metabolism'(bin =
10.1; p = 0.3212). Although these mappings to the pathways are not statistically significant, probably due to the
cross-species nature of the analysis, they do indicate the
range of processes that may be involved in the response of
Musa to drought stress.

Interestingly only one Arabidopsis homologue (TAIR:
At3g05890) was present in the drought/salt-responsive
BIN. Rather, the majority of 'stress-related' transcripts
were found in the 'heat', 'biotic stress', and 'development'
BINs (Figure 3b). This again reflects the overlapping and
redundant nature of plant responses to water-deficit
stress. Other functional transcripts of interest were a
number of homologues classified in 'redox responses',
including for example a cytoplasmic Cu-Zn SOD (TAIR:
At1g08830), known to be up-regulated in response to oxidative stress [41], as well as an up-regulated dehydroascorbate reductase transcript (TAIR: At1g75270,
DHAR2), which is important for the maintenance of Lascorbate pools, and which again is central to general
stress adaptation responses [42,43]. Interestingly, two
transcripts encoding for a putative trehalose-6-phosphate
synthase (TPS) were also up-regulated 2.2 and 2.4-fold
respectively, and TPS overexpression has been shown to
confer drought tolerance in several plant species [44].
Rice drought QTLs
To help assess the biological relevance of these results, the
list of drought-responsive Musa transcripts was compared
to the list of genes underlying known QTLs for abiotic
stresses in rice, obtained from the Gramene website http:/
/www.gramene.org/. Of the 2,910 differentially regulated
Musa genes, 52 co-localised to a total of 6 QTLs responsible for either drought or cold-response. These results and
the functional annotations of all of the identified putative
drought-responsive genes present at each QTL are summarised in table 2.

Interestingly, in two cases the genetic determinants
responsible for the QTL phenotype have been linked to a

single underlying gene and homologues of these two
genes were both present in the list of putative droughtresponsive Musa transcripts. These two genes are (TIGR:
LOC_Os04g23890) and (TIGR: LOC_Os11g03794)
underlying QTLs-2 (drought susceptibility, trait symbol
AQA045/CQ148) and QTL-5 (cold-tolerance, trait symbol CQP8) respectively. LOC_Os04g23890 encodes for
the protein PHOT2 (non-phototrophic hypocotyl 1-like)
which is a membrane-bound protein serine/threonine
kinase functioning as a blue light photoreceptor in redun-

dancy with PHOT1. PHOT2 is responsible for the trait
'drought susceptibility' and was 2.2-fold up-regulated in
response to drought in Musa. Both PHOT1 and PHOT2
are thought to help optimize photosynthesis by capturing
light energy efficiently and by reducing photodamage
[45]. LOC_Os11g03794 encodes for 'Aladin', a structural
constituent of ribosomes and is identical to the cDNA
'Huellenlos' (HLL). In wheat, the HLL homologue
appears to be involved in plant development, including
development of the floral organs [46].

It is tempting when looking at the list of other droughtresponsive genes present at these stress-responsive QTLs
to try and link gene functions with the overlying trait
response, not least because these are potential candidates
for explaining the QTL trait, and could therefore be candidates for marker assisted selection programs. Of particular
interest at QTL-1 (cold-tolerance) are genes encoding for
a Cyt P450 (possibly involved in ABA degradation), and a
K+ channel, at QTL-3 (drought-tolerance), a MYB TF (MYB
36) and chaperonins, while at QTL-6 (drought susceptibility) a bHLH protein, a Na/H+ antiporter could clearly
have roles in regulating plant drought stress responses. An
up-regulated putative carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase
(CCD1, TIGR:LOC_Os12g44310) is a member of a gene
family believed to be involved in ABA synthesis in Arabidopsis and which in rice are associated with the negative
regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds [47]. Clearly
such interpretations need to be confirmed through additional experiments including confirmation of gene identities and gene expression analysis. Nonetheless it is
interesting to note that 5 of the transcripts common
between transcriptomic studies of rice-seedling dehydration stress (see 'Meta-analyses' later), and the Musa putative drought stress experiments also colocalize to rice
abiotic stress QTLs (table 2), providing further incidental
support for the quality of the data and the annotations
generated here.
Meta-analyses
To date, the only published comparative gene expression
study carried out in banana is the work of Santos and coworkers [28], who prepared enriched, full-length cDNA
libraries from leaves of the cultivar M. acuminata spp. burmannicodes var. Calcutta 4, subjected to temperature
stress. Fortunately however large-scale studies of the
response of the transcriptome to abiotic (drought) stress
in other plants species are available e.g. [32-34]. Of particular interest is the work of Tyagi et al [48] who examined
the responses of rice to abiotic stresses using the Affymetrix Rice Genome Array. In this work, desiccation stress
was imposed by drying seedlings between folds of tissue
paper for 3 h at room temperature. The expression data
sets for the results of these studies were downloaded from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at the
NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ accession number: GSE 6901). This data set contained 6,253
genes that were significantly (>2-fold, p < 0.05) differentially expressed in response to desiccation. Despite fundamental differences in the experimental design and in plant
developmental status, 330 of the rice seedling transcripts
overlappedsignificantly (p = 0.024) with the list of Musa
putative drought-responsive genes, including 5 that colocalised again with the abiotic stress QTLs outlined in table
2. Of these 330 Musa transcripts, 53.4% were up-regulated
and 46.6% down-regulated [see Additional file 3].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/436

297 of the 330 transcripts could further be assigned an
Arabdiopsis annotation with the HarvEST program, and
these annotations were again used to assign functional
classifications with the GO software function on the TAIR
website. These results are summarised in Figure 4
Looking at the distribution of gene classes we can see that
the up-regulated transcripts common to the rice seedling
and Musa drought-stress experiments, contain proportionally more genes involved in 'transport', 'response to
(a)biotic stimulus', 'stress response' and 'transcription',
while the classes involved with 'cell biogenesis' and 'electron transport and energy production' are down-regulated. This again agrees with generally-accepted patterns
of plant responses to drought/desiccation stress. Within
the list of functional genes there is an up-regulation of
membrane proteins involved in water transport and
osmoregulation, as well as proteins for the detoxification
of stress-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as glutathione S-transferases, hydrolase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase etc.. The list of common regulatory genes contains
members of the homeodomain proteins (2), pathogeninduced (1), MYB (3), ERF-family (2) and one heat stress
factor (HSF) TF with proposed functions again characteristic of TFs involved in regulating plant (a)biotic stressresponses.
Comparison with the results of the AtGenExpress
Finally, the list of Musa putative drought-responsive transcripts was compared to the results obtained from dehydration stress experiments in Arabidopsis carried out as
part of the AtGenExpress consortium [34]. In these experiments, dehydration stress was imposed by exposing Arabidopsis plants to a dry air stream for 15 minutes on the
bench until 10% of their fresh weight was lost [34]. From
the list of 518 Arabidopsis differentially expressed genes
(>2 fold, p < 0.05), 37 (p = 0.06) and 55 (p = 0.003) Musa
gene homologues overlapped with the drought responsive Arabidopsis transcripts from shoot and root tissues
respectively. In addition there were 12 Musa transcripts
common to all 3 data sets (Musa severe drought stress, and
Arabidopsis root and Arabidopsis shoot desiccation stress).
Therefore despite substantial differences in experimental
design, the results of this meta-analysis indirectly support
the provisional gene identities assigned to the drought
responsive transcripts in Musa and illustrate the degree of
conservation of the pathways of plant stress responses
across plant species, even when they are as distantly
related as Arabidopsis and Musa.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR
The identity of the Musa transcripts is based on crosshybridisation with at least of one 25 bp probe per Rice
GeneChip® transcript probe-set. To help confirm the validity of the gDNA probe-based approach and the identity of

the differentially-regulated transcripts, primers were
designed to a number of drought-responsive transcripts.
To do this we used an in-house, proprietary database of
Musa unigene sequences. For primer design we preferentially used Musa sequences which were 'best hit' in a reciprocal BLASTN query of rice unigene sequences
(downloaded from the HarvEST website) versus the Musa
unigene database. In total, primers to 14 sequences were
used, and the results from the relative expression levels in
control and drought stressed foliar tissue are summarised
in Figure 5.
As shown in Figure 5, the RT-PCR results generally showed
the same trends, and expression levels generally agreed
well with the results from the microarray hybrisation
experiments. This has previously been demonstrated in
other heterologous cross-hybridisation experiments utilising more closely-related plant species [14,21]. In this
work however there were also several cases where the
expected Musa relative transcript expression values based
on the microarray results significantly differed from the
RT-PCR results. These discrepancies probably relate to the
difficulty in assigning strict functional annotations and
designing primers for (Musa) transcripts based on homologies to the relatively short oligonucleotide probes of
quite distantly-related heterologous species. In addition,
the Musa unigene collection we used contains only 22,205
unique transcript sequences, which extrapolating from

the gene densities of one gene per 4.1 kb reported by Lescot et al [26] and a haploid genome size of 560 - 600 Mb
[22,23] corresponds to a maximum of only around 16%
of the total predicted number of genes present in the Musa
genome. This means that in some cases it is possible that
the 'true' sequence, with highest homology was simply
not present in our unigene collection. In support of this,
the sequences that produced relative expression results
that were not in agreement with the microarray data generally also had lower E-values, or were transcripts derived
from large gene families. Undoubtedly the availability of
additional EST and genome sequence data will improve
the reliability of transcript identification.

Conclusion
Despite the economic and social importance of Musa spp
for large sections of the world's population, there have
been few systematic studies into banana and plantain
responses to abiotic stress [28,49-51] and none to
drought. There are also no published genome-wide stressstudies in Musa and relatively little sequence data is available particularly when compared to other important
crops. Further, despite the large number of drought stressassociated genes identified in both model and non-model
plant species, there is still no consensus as to the key processes that determine plant tolerance and survival, and in
only a few cases has gene function been defined. Therefore
it is likely that the study of bananas and plantains, will
result in the identification of additional, novel stress
adaptation mechanisms and could represent a powerful
resource in the search for plant stress-tolerant genes and/
or markers. The aim of this work therefore was to evaluate
the use of a heterologous microarray approach to profile
the transcriptome of the relatively drought-tolerant Musa
cultivar 'Cachaco' to chronic drought stress. In contrast to
other transcriptomic studies in which short, 'shock-like'
treatments have been applied [10,33,52] experimental
conditions here were chosen to more closely mimic field
conditions and thus to identify genes involved in the
long-term adaptation and survival of plants to water deficit.
Cross-hybridisation of Musa gDNA to the ATH-1 and Rice
GeneChips® showed that the number of probes and
probe-sets retained decreased much more rapidly with
increasing CDF-values on the ATH-1 array than on the
Rice GeneChip®. Nonetheless there was still a sufficient
degree of homology between Musa and Arabidopsis to be
able to profile a significant proportion of the Musa
expressed genome using the ATH-1 GeneChip®. This
would thus tend to support the results of comparative
sequence studies in Musa, Oryza and Arabidopsis that indicate that Poacea and eudicot genomes share microsyntenic
regions [26,53].

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:436

Cross-hybridisation of Musa RNA to the Rice GeneChip®
identified 2,910 transcripts (probe-sets) displaying a >2fold difference in expression levels in response to drought.
Gene annotations based on rice and Arabidopsis databases
indicated that many of these transcripts were involved in
cellular pathways and processes typically involved in
plant (a)biotic stress responses, including a number of
genes with TF activity. Importantly, our results share significant overlaps with transcriptome studies in other
(model) species, with the list of drought-responsive Musa
genes including homologues known to be involved in the
dehydration stress responses of both rice and Arabidopsis.
Furthermore, the list also contained a number of transcripts that co-localized to known rice QTLs for both
drought and cold responses, including 2 QTLs for which
the underlying genetic determinant has been localized to
a single (up-regulated) gene. These could therefore be a
good target for marker development and could directly
incorporated into Musa breeding and selection programs.
These QTL results further suggest that the Musa gene
annotations and functionalities assigned on the basis of
cross-hybridisation to rice probes are correct and have
biological significance. This conclusion is further supported by the results of the RT-PCR results, which largely
agreed with the expression results derived from the microarray, except for those cases where homology to available
Musa unigenes was very low or where multiple gene models were available.
Therefore cross-species (heterologous) microarray studies
using gDNA-based probe selection allows the profiling of
up to ~58% of the total Musa genome despite the absence
of substantial sequence data for this species and the large
phylogenetic distance from the target species. This is a
substantially larger proportion of the transcriptome than
has previously reported for this species and as far as we are
aware, the largest phylogenetic distance used in a crosshybridisation study. gDNA probe-based selection thus
represents a powerful tool for the study of complex biological responses in a non-model species. While gene
ontologies and function of key transcripts have to be carefully validated, the results here underline the potential of
this methodology for the identification of (new) mechanisms and pathways of expression control. In the long
term this information can lead to the development of new
tools and strategies for the development and breeding of
important new crop varieties with improved (a)biotic
stress tolerance.

Methods
Plant Material
All plant material used was obtained as sterile tissue culture from Bioversity's International Transit Center (ITC)
located in the Laboratory of Tropical Crop Improvement
of Division of Crop Biotechnics, Katholieke Universiteit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/436

Leuven, Belgium. These in vitro plants were first transplanted into 7.5 litre polyethylene pots containing equal
volumes of an autoclaved mixture of enriched commercial
peat soil and sand (2:1, v/v), and allowed to grow and stabilise for approximately three months before the onset of
the experiment.
Experimental setup, growth conditions and sampling
Plants were grown at a density of 24 plants per table under
a standardised light/dark regime of 12/12 h at 26/23°C
respectively with a light intensity of around 10,000 lux
(300 watts/m2) and a relative humidity of 75%. At the
onset of the experiment, all plants were hand-watered
until water drained freely from the base of the pots. The
control plants were then watered once a day by flooding
the tables with a fertigation solution [see Additional file 4]
and allowing the pots to stand for 30 min.

Water-deficit (drought) conditions were imposed by withholding water supply for in total up to five weeks. Leaf
samples consisted of a 5 - 8 cm wide strip (~3 g fresh
weight) removed from one side of the middle of the second, fully expanded leaf down from the top of the plant.
Samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80°C until analysis. All sampling took place between
14:00 and 17:00 pm. For transcriptome analysis, equal
quantities of RNA from 2 replicate plants grown at each
time point per treatment were pooled to give a single biological replicate.
Musa genomic DNA Extraction
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from young leaves
which had been kept in the dark for 48 h to deplete starch
and polysaccharide levels using a modified CTAB method
essentially as according to Michiels et al [54]. Contaminating RNA was removed by addition of 2.5 μl of a 10 μg/ml
stock solution of RNase and incubation at 37°C for 30
min. To check the quality and quantity of DNA, 1 μl samples of isolated DNA were run on a 1% agarose gel in TAE
buffer (0.04 M Tris-acetate; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) as outlined by Sambrook et al [55]. After staining of the gel with
ethidium bromide for 15 min, DNA concentrations were
visually estimated by comparison to different amounts of
λ-DNA run at the same time. gDNA quality was determined spectrophotometrically using the AU absorbance
ratios at 260/280 nm. Samples with a 260/280 ratio of 1.9
- 2.0 were considered as 'pure'.
Musa RNA Extraction
RNA was extracted using a modified Tris-LiCl method,
based on the work of Tattersall et al [56]. The modifications involved a DNAse treatment and an additional phenol:chloroform cleanup step. RNA concentrations and
purity were determined using a MultiScan Spectrum
microtitre plate scanning UV-VIS spectrophotometer

(Multiskan Spectrum, Thermolabsystems, Brussels, Belgium). For purity assessment, the AU 260/280 and AU
260/230 ratios were measured and samples with a ratio of
~2.0 were considered as 'pure'. One microgram of total
RNA sample was also run on a 1% agarose gel containing
ethidium bromide in TAE buffer to check for possible degradation [55]. Gels were imaged using a GelDoc 1000 gel
imaging system and Molecular Analyst v1.5 image analysis software version 4 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
gDNA Hybridisation and construction of probe mask files
gDNA hybridisation was carried out essentially as
described by Hammond et al [14]. In brief, Musa gDNA
was labeled using the Bioprime DNA hybridisation System (Invitrogen) and subsequently hybridised to either
the Arabidopsis ATH1 or Rice, Genome Arrays for 16 h at
45 C, using standard Affymetrix hybridisation protocols.
This was then followed by the Affymetrix eukaryotic wash
protocol that included antibody staining. The GeneChip®
Genome Arrays were then hybridised with 0.5 μg of target
Musa gDNA and scanned on a G2500A GeneArray scanner. Only one gDNA hybridisation was performed, as replicate gDNA hybridisations all challenge the GeneChip®
arrays with the whole genome.

From these results a gDNA cell intensity file (.cel file) was
generated using the Microarray Analysis Suite software
(MAS, v5.0, Affymetrix). This .cel file contains the hybridisation intensities between Musa gDNA fragments and all
the A. thaliana or Rice GeneChip® oligonucleotide probes.
The .cel files have been submitted to GEO (Accession ID =
GSE16865) and are also available from the NASC Xspecies webpage http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/xspecies/.
Probes showing a suitably strong cross-hybridisation signal were selected from the .cel file using a .cel file parser
script (Xspecies v 1.1, available with instructions at http:/
/affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/xspecies/) written in the Perl
programming language http://www.perl.com. This Perl
script creates a probe mask (.cdf) file, which is compatible
with a range of microarray analysis software packages and
provides the template for the generation of a signal across
the probe-set when analyzing the test (Musa) transcriptome (i.e. the RNA .cel files). Specifically it allows information to be extracted from the RNA .cel files for only
those probe-pairs whose perfect-match (PM) probe gDNA
hybridisation intensity value is above a user-defined
hybridisation intensity threshold (CDF value). In practice
the optimal gDNA CDF is determined systematically and
empirically using probe masks created with CDF values of
between 50 and 1000 (see 'Results'). A probe-set is
retained for analysis when it is represented by at least one
PM probe-pair per probe-set. Therefore one 25 bp probe,
identical in sequence to a Musa gDNA fragment is the
minimum requirement for inclusion of that probe-set in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/436

the subsequent transcriptome analysis of the target Musa
RNA.
cRNA Synthesis, Hybridisation and Interpretation of Musa
transcriptome data using gDNA-based probe selection
The transcriptional responses of the Musa cultivar 'Cachaco' to severe drought were determined by challenging
rice GeneChip® Genome Arrays with Musa foliar RNA, isolated and pooled from two replicate plants subjected to
either 3 weeks water-deficit conditions or to control conditions. Approximately 5 μg of Musa total RNA was reverse
transcribed at 42°C for 1 h to generate first strand cDNA
using 100 pmol oligo dT(24) primer containing a 5'-T7
RNA polymerase promoter sequence, 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 10 mM dNTPs and 200 units SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Following
first strand cDNA synthesis, second strand cDNA was synthesised using 10 units of Escherichia coli polymerase I, 10
units of E. coli DNA ligase and 2 units of RNase H in a
reaction containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM
KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM (NH4)SO4, 0.15 mM β-NAD+
and 10 mM dNTPs. This second strand synthesis reaction
proceeded at 16°C for 2 h before 10 units of T4 DNA
polymerase was added and the reaction allowed to proceed for a further 5 min. The reaction was terminated by
adding 0.5 M EDTA. Double stranded cDNA products
were purified using the GeneChip® Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix). The synthesised cDNAs were transcribed
in-vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Enzo BioArray High
Yield RNA Transcript Labelling Kit, Enzo Life Sciences
Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA) and biotinylated nucleotides
to generate biotinylated complementary RNAs (cRNAs).
The cRNAs were then purified using the Affymetrix Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix) and randomly fragmented at 94°C for 35 min in a buffer containing 40 mM
Tris-acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mM potassium acetate, and 30
mM magnesium acetate to generate molecules of approximately 35 to 200 bp. Affymetrix A. thaliana ATH1
Genome or Rice Genome Arrays were then hybridised
with 15 μg of fragmented, labeled cRNA for 16 h at 45°C
as described in the Affymetrix Technical Analysis Manual.
GeneChip® arrays were then stained with StreptavidinPhycoerythrin solution and scanned with an Affymetrix
G2500A GeneArray scanner. The Microarray Analysis
Suite (MAS Version 5.0; Affymetrix) was used to generate
.cel files for each of the RNA hybridisations by scanning
and computing summary intensities for each probe without the use of probe mask files. The .cel files have been
submitted to GEO (Acession ID = GSE16865) and are also
available from the NASC Xspecies webpage http://affyme
trix.arabidopsis.info/xspecies/. These .cel files were then
loaded into the GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies) analysis software package using the Robust Multichip Average

(RMA) pre-normalisation algorithm [57]. During .cel file
loading and pre-normalisation, .cel files were interpreted
using either, (1) the respective A. thaliana or rice .cdf files
(i.e. with no probe-selection used), or (2) using .cdf files
generated from the Musa gDNA .cel file with CDF values
ranging from 0 to 1000. Following RMA pre-normalisation and masking of individual probes, each probe-set signal value from treated (drought stressed) samples was
standardised relative to the probe-set signal value of its
corresponding control, to give the relative gene expression
ratios between the two conditions.
Gene ontology's and functional characterisation
Rice and Arabidopsis gene annotations (GO ontology's;
http://www.geneontology.org) for >2-fold differentiallyregulated Musa transcripts cross-hybridising to oligonucelotide probes on the Rice GeneChip®, were assigned using
the NetAffx web tools software http://www.affyme
trix.com/analysis/index.affx from Affymetrix, or the HarvEST program http://www.harvest-web.org. Functional
classifications of the genes were assigned using the gene
ontology (GO) function at the TAIR website http://
www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp, or the
GeneSpring software. The significance of these classifications was calculated using a hypergeometric distribution
test http://stattrek.com/Tables/Hypergeometric.aspx. The
AGI codes of the Arabidopsis equivalents the Musa transcripts were obtained from the Affymetrix website, and
used to allow expression data to be loaded and analysed
in MapMan software for visualization of the cellular pathway responses [40,58].
Microarray meta-analysis
Results were compared with publicly available comparative transcriptome studies of plant abiotic stress responses
in rice (Oryza sativa) and A. thaliana. The list of droughtresponsive Musa transcripts obtained at a probe mask
hybridisation intensity of CDF-550, were compared to the
list of A. thaliana dehydration stress-responsive genes
identified by the AtGenExpress consortium [34] using the
MetaAnalyzer tool of Genevestigator [59]. In addition,
data from a recent large scale comparative transcriptomics
study of the response of rice seedlings to abiotic stress
using the Affymetrix Rice Genome Array by Tyagi et al is
also available [48]. In these studies, desiccation stress was
imposed by drying seedlings between folds of tissue paper
for 3 h at room temperature. The expression data sets for
these studies were downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database at the NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ accession number GSE
6901), and the list of differentially expressed genes overlapping with the list of drought responsive Musa transcripts identified that were >2 fold different between
treated and control samples and using an ANOVA test (p
< 0.05). The significance of gene list overlaps was calcu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/436

lated using a hypergeometric distribution test http://stat
trek.com/Tables/Hypergeometric.aspx. Finally, the list of
differentially drought-regulated Musa genes was compared to genes located at known QTLs for drought and
other abiotic stresses localized on the physical genetic
map of rice. The position of the QTLs were viewed in
Gramene http://www.gramene.org/ and the list of underlying genes present at each QTL compared to those
present in the CDF-550 list.
Semi-Quantitative PCR
To verify GeneChip® array expression data, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on first strand cDNA prepared
from the same 'Cachaco' 3-week, control and drought
RNA samples used for the microarray cross-hybridisation
experiments. One μg of total RNA from pooled leaf samples derived from 2 individual plants per condition, was
used for reverse transcription using the SuperScript II
Reverse Transciptase using conditions recommended by
the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesis reaction was carried out using oligo-dT(18) primers (50 μg ml1). PCR amplification of the first strand cDNA was carried
out using gene specific primers for a number of transcripts
showing >2-fold difference in expression. Primers were
designed using an in-house database of Musa EST
sequences created from available on-line GenBank
sequences and a 3' EST database donated to the Global
Musa Genomics Consortium by Syngenta. From the original 48,445 EST sequences, 33,038 were clustered to give
9,251 contigs which together with the remaining singletons produced a final collection of 22,205 unique Musa
unigene sequences. To link the Musa EST sequences with
the transcripts identified by cross-hybridisation to the
Rice GeneChip® microarray, a local BLAST search of the
Musa unigene sequences versus the entire rice Unigene set
(Assembly 1.09), downloaded from the HarvEST website
was carried out at E-value stringency settings of both 10
and 0.1. In addition rice Unigene sequences corresponding to the differentially drought-regulated Probe-sets were
BLASTed against the Musa unigene dataset. Primers for
semi-quantitative PCR were designed to the cDNA
sequences of those Musa gene homologues localized
within the QTLs for abiotic stress responses in rice as well
as a Musa Actin-1 control transcript (GenBank accession
AF285176). Primers were designed using the Primer3
primer design tool [60]; http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/
primer3/primer3.cgi and initial primer sequences were
checked for secondary structures using the netprimer program,
http://www.premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/
index.htm. PCR reactions were carried out using 25 μl per
reaction consisting of 2 ng of cDNA sample, 1 μM of 5'and 3'-primer and 7.5 μl of master mix. The reaction conditions were 94°C (2 min) for one cycle, and then 94°C
(30 s) and 55°C (30 s) and 72°C (30 s), for 24 - 32 cycles,
before a final extension of 72 C for 10 minutes. Transcript
