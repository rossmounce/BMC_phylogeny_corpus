Mito-nuclear genetic comparison in a Wolbachia
infected weevil: insights on reproductive mode,
infection age and evolutionary forces shaping
genetic variation
Marcela S Rodriguero1*, Analía A Lanteri2, Viviana A Confalonieri1

Abstract
Background: Maternally inherited endosymbionts like Wolbachia pipientis are in linkage disequilibrium with the
mtDNA of their hosts. Therefore, they can induce selective sweeps, decreasing genetic diversity over many
generations. This sex ratio distorter, that is involved in the origin of parthenogenesis and other reproductive
alterations, infects the parthenogenetic weevil Naupactus cervinus, a serious pest of ornamental and fruit plants.
Results: Molecular evolution analyses of mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (ITS1) sequences from 309 individuals of
Naupactus cervinus sampled over a broad range of its geographical distribution were carried out. Our results
demonstrate lack of recombination in the nuclear fragment, non-random association between nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes and the consequent coevolution of both genomes, being an indirect evidence of
apomixis. This weevil is infected by a single Wolbachia strain, which could have caused a moderate bottleneck in
the invaded population which survived the initial infection.
Conclusions: Clonal reproduction and Wolbachia infection induce the coevolution of bacterial, mitochondrial and
nuclear genomes. The time elapsed since the Wolbachia invasion would have erased the traces of the
demographic crash in the mtDNA, being the nuclear genome the only one that retained the signal of the
bottleneck. The amount of genetic change accumulated in the mtDNA and the high prevalence of Wolbachia in all
populations of N. cervinus agree with the hypothesis of an ancient infection. Wolbachia probably had great
influence in shaping the genetic diversity of N. cervinus. However, it would have not caused the extinction of
males, since sexual and asexual infected lineages coexisted until recent times.

Background
Parthenogenetic reproduction is fairly common in Curculionidae [1,2]. Many cases have been reported in three
different subfamilies: Scolytinae (bark beetles), Listroderinae and Entiminae (broad-nose weevils), especially in
species from the Old World (e.g. [1,3-6]). Although less
studied, weevils from South America also concentrate a
huge number of asexual species. For instance, Lanteri
and Normark [7] provided a list of more than 30 parthenogenetic or presumptive parthenogenetic species within

the tribe Naupactini (subfamily Entiminae). There is no
direct evidence of parthenogenesis for the majority of
these species. However, Floyd F. Smith and colleagues
from the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) proved this reproductive mode through rearing
experiments for the species Naupactus cervinus and
N. leucoloma respectively (see [8]), and Marvaldi [9] did
the same with N. ruizi.
Parthenogenesis in Curculionidae is thelytokous and
apomictic (i.e. ameiotic) [2]. Apomixis was confirmed
for several Old World broad-nosed weevils [3,10],
although nothing is known for South American species.
As a consequence of this kind of reproduction, progeny
would result in a group of females genetically identical
to their mothers [11]. Nevertheless, the absence of

recombination would originate heterozygote genotypes,
as rare mutations accumulate [12,13]. The lack of meiosis could be detrimental in the short term [14-16],
although heterozygosity could explain the higher dispersion and adaptation ability of some parthenogenetic species over the sexual ones in the long term [1].
Traditionally, hybridization and polyploidy were the
main traits invoked to explain the origin of asexuality in
weevils [2,17]. However, the report of the parthenogenesis inductor bacterium Wolbachia pipientis (hereafter
“Wolbachia“) in several species of the tribe Naupactini
[18,19] and also in the genera Cathormiocerus (Entiminae, Trachyphloeini) [20] and Otiorhynchus (Entiminae,
Otiorhynchini) [21], suggested another possible explanation for the origin of this reproductive mode in broadnosed weevils.
Wolbachia infection can produce drastic consequences
on the evolution of its host species, such as extinction
or sex role reversal [22,23]. However, it can also affect
the population genetics and molecular evolution of the
vertical transmitted genomes (mitochondrial, and for
apomictic species also nuclear DNA), because of the
linkage disequilibrium among these cotransmitted molecules [24-26].
When an arthropod population is invaded by a Wolbachia strain that rapidly spreads, the host mtDNA
(and perhaps the nDNA) associated to the initial
infection (i.e. in linkage disequilibrium with the bacterial genome) will hitchhike through the population
to fixation [26,27]. Consequently, this selective sweep
("indirect selection on the mtDNA”) will lead to a loss
of mtDNA/nDNA diversity in part of the host species
distribution. Since the expected coalescent time of
mtDNA in an uninfected species is twice the effective
population size of females (Nf), a decrease in mtDNA/
nDNA diversity will be evident for ca. 2Nf generations
after the Wolbachia invasion [25]. Then, current
levels of genetic diversity in infected arthropod populations should be analyzed in the context of the infection age.
The spread and prevalence of the infection can also be
related to other important factors. For instance, the success of the infected females in producing more daughters than uninfected females [28]. If infected females
have a higher fitness than unifected ones, a perfect
transmission of the endosymbiont will lead to a high
prevalence or to its fixation [23].
From the considerations stated before, we formulate
the following hypotheses:
i) If parthenogenesis is apomictic, the lack of meiosis
precludes the occurrence of recombination;
ii) Then, asexuality can generate linkage disequilibrium among mitochondrial and nuclear genomes;

Page 2 of 15

iii) Vertical transmission of Wolbachia can generate
linkage disequilibrium among mitochondrial, nuclear
and bacterial genomes;
iv) Infection with Wolbachia can sweep the genetic
variation on both mitochondrial and nuclear DNAs
of the hosts;
v) Infection age correlates with recovery of genetic
diversity of host genomes and also with the high
prevalence of Wolbachia in its populations.
To test these hypotheses we carried out a study on the
genetic diversity of the species Naupactus cervinus, as
part of a broader research project on the evolution of
parthenogenesis in South American weevils of the tribe
Naupactini. This pest insect, commonly known as the
Fuller’s rose weevil, is very attractive for studying the
evolution of asexuality, because it is worldwide distributed and it is very abundant in nature. Although probably
native to Northeastern Argentina, Southern Brazil and
Uruguay, in currently occurs in Australia, Azores
Islands, Canary Islands, Chile, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Spain, USA, etc. as a consequence of commercial trade of several crops, especially
ornamental and fruit plants [29-31].
Naupactus cervinus reproduces by parthenogenesis,
although some sexual lineages have been recorded from
Northeastern Argentina and Southern Brazil in the
1940’s (see [32]). Rodriguero et al. [19] and Rodriguero
[33] reported that all asexual lineages of this species are
infected with the Wolbachia strain wNau5, which
belongs to the supergroup B.
The main goal of this contribution is to understand
the conquences of Wolbachia infection and asexuality
on the genomes of N. cervinus through a mito-nuclear
genetic comparison. To test the hypotheses previously
formulated, particularly the occurrence of apomixis, we
will quantify the minimum number of recombination
events and the linkage disequilibrium between both genomes. Additionally, the estimation of the number of
Wolbachia strains, their prevalence and the infection
age, will bring insights on the influence of this endosymbiont on both host genomes, and will contribute to
explain the distribution of their genetic variation.

Results
Genetic variation estimates

Three hundred and nine individuals from 38 different
locations were screened for genetic variation in a 748 bp
fragment of the COI gene. All of them were females.
Seventeen mitochondrial haplotypes (arbitrarily named
A-R [GenBank: GQ406827 - GQ406843]) and 25 segregating sites were identified, of which only three were
singletons. Some haplotypes were found in multiple
locations (e.g. haplotype B, Table 1), while others

occurred at a single site (e.g. haplotypes A, D, E, G, H, J,
L, N, P, Table 1).
Alignment of the translated COI sequences showed a
distribution of the genetic variation similar to that
reported by Lunt et al. [34]. The absence of stop codons
and mutations that alter the reading frame excluded
numt amplifications. The total proportions of nucleotides were 31.8% A, 17.0% C, 15.7% G and 35.6% T,

with a strong A + T bias (67.4%), which is higher in the
third codon position. Estimates of genetic variation for
the total sample were θπ = 0.007 ± 0.001, θW = 0.007 ±
0.002 and Hd = 0.844 ± 0.011. Maximum parsimony
search yielded 13 most parsimonious trees 113 steps
long. A strict consensus tree is shown, where two main
clades have been recovered (Figure 1). One of these
clades includes mitochondrial haplotypes from forests

("forest clade”), and the other one mitochondrial haplotypes from open vegetation areas ("grassland clade”),
except “F”, “G” and “H” that come from a transition
zone along the Uruguay River (Figure 1, Table 1). The
most parsimonious trees differentiate in minor changes
in the relationships among haplotypes within the “grassland clade”, yielding a highly unresolved consensus tree
with several branches of zero length (i.e. a large
polytomy).
Sequencing of ITS1 in 282 individuals yielded a fragment of ca. 1,100 bp, 155 bp of it belonging to the
highly conserved 18 S rDNA region, and the remaining
to the ITS1 region. Most specimens analyzed were a
subsample of those sequenced for COI. Twenty three of
these individuals showed chromatograms with double
peaks ("double string sequences”) (Table 1). This finding
was indicative of at least two simultaneously amplified
sequences from the same individual.
Forty-four segregating sites were identified for ITS1
(only four singletons) yielding eight different nuclear haplotypes (arbitrarily named I-VIII [GenBank: GQ406818 GQ406825]). Unlike COI, insertion/deletion events were
frequent in this dataset. However, based on a gap insertion:substitution cost ratio 10:1, primary homologies
could be unambiguously established. Nuclear haplotype
distribution depicted a pattern similar to COI (e.g. haplotypes VI and VII are widely distributed, and haplotypes I,
II and III are restricted to a single site, Table 1). The
following values of genetic variability were obtained: θπ =
0.026 ± 0.001, θ W = 0.013 ± 0.002 and Hd = 0.574 ±
0.028. The Hd value was remarkably lower than that
obtained for COI, in agreement with the minor number

of ITS1 haplotypes. Maximum parsimony search yielded
one most parsimonious tree 153 steps long (Figure 2). In
agreement with the mitochondrial dataset, two divergent
clades were recovered: one from open vegetation areas
("grassland clade”) and the other from forests ("forest
clade”), although the later includes a single haplotype
(VI) from the transition zone previously mentioned.
Linkage Disequilibrium Analysis

Direct analysis of multilocus genotypes (COI and ITS1)
in 282 individuals shows that in most cases, nuclear and
mitochondrial genotypes cosegregate (Table 1). In fact,
ten out of 17 mitochondrial haplotypes (A, D, G, H, I, J,
K, M, N and P) from 104 individuals are exclusively
associated with a single nuclear haplotype. For instance,
20 individuals bearing the mitochondrial haplotype “K”
always carry the nuclear haplotype “VII”, 11 individuals
with “P” always carry “IV”, 22 individuals with “M”
always carry “VII”, and so on (see Table 1). Additionally,
the most frequent haplotypes “B” and “F” are linked
with nuclear haplotypes “VII” and “VI” respectively, in
118 out of 126 individuals (Table 1).
Moreover, the analysis of congruence between COI and
ITS1 gene trees reveals signatures of coevolution between
both genomes. For instance, eight mitochondrial haplotypes belonging to the “grassland clade” ("A”, “B”, “D”, “I”,
“J”, “K”, “M” and “N”) share the grassland nuclear haplotype “VII” (Figure 3). The remaining haplotypes from this
same clade “F”, “G” and “H, which occur in a transition
zone between forests and grasslands (Table 1), are linked
to the nuclear haplotype “VI”. More interestingly, within
the mitochondrial “forest clade” the sister haplotypes “P”
and “Q” share the forest nuclear haplotype “IV”, and the

“R” haplotype bears the nuclear genotype “I”, phylogenetically related to “IV” (Figure 3). The inverse association
was also observed, since some related nuclear haplotypes
are linked to the same mitochondrial haplotype. For example “II”, “III” and “IV” are linked with “Q”, whereas “V”
and “VII” are associated with “B” (Figure 3).
Only four individuals show traces of recombination.
They are those carrying the haplotype combinations
“B-VI” (N = 2), “C-II” (N = 1) and “F-VII” (N = 1).
Moroever, ITS1 double strings sequences were found in
three mitotypes ("C”, “E” and “R”), a fact that could be
the consequence of hybridization events.
The hypothesis of mito-nuclear coevolution is also
supported by the result of the statistical assessment of

the genetic linkage between both genomes. In fact, the
1,403 comparisons of nuclear vs. mitochondrial sites
yielded 772 significant values of linkage disequilibrium
(see Additional File 1, Table S1). After Bonferroni’s correction, the number of significant associations decreased
to 606. This led to the rejection of the null hypothesis
of linkage equilibrium between the nuclear and mitochondrial fragments herein sequenced.
Analysis of recombination in nuclear sequences

The estimation of the recombination parameter according to RM indicates lack of recombination in the nuclear
sequence under study (RM = 0, p = 0). Although ITS1 is
a small fragment in comparison with the whole nuclear

genome, this result may be regarded as an indirect evidence of apomixis. Then, the null hypothesis of apomixis cannot be rejected.
Selective sweeps

The MK test, based on polymorphism and divergence,
showed a significant deficit of fixed non-synonymous differences in COI (G = 8.199; p < 0.01). Then, purifying or
negative selection penalizes the non-synonymous substitutions between N. cervinus and N. dissimulator. The NI
and the a parameter support this conclusion (NI = 9.474;
a = -8.474). Tajima’s DT and Fu and Li’s F were nonsignificant (DT = 0.183, p > 0.05 and F = 1.151, p > 0.10),
suggesting that genetic variation of COI is under selective
neutrality or in drift-mutation equilibrium.
The models selected by MrModelTest were GTR + G
[35,36] for the mitochondrial dataset, and HKY85 + I
[37,38] for the nuclear dataset. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses converged after 100,000 generations, based on the
inspection of the burn-in plot of log-likelihood scores, tree
lengths, all model parameters, and the analysis of cumulative posterior probabilities and the standard deviation of
split frequencies. Therefore, the first 250 samples from
each analysis were discarded, resulting in two posterior
distributions containing 750 samples each. A plot of the
posterior probabilities of all splits from the two separate
MCMCMC runs demonstrated a linear relationship, suggesting that these analyses were not restricted to local
optima. The ITS1 sites were optimized onto this phylogram. The likelihood ratio tests obtained were LRT1 =
1.001 (p = 0.606) for test 1, and LRT2 = 2.001 (p = 0.317)
for test 2. Therefore, the null hypothesis of no positive
selection could not be rejected for the nuclear dataset. In
fact, out of the 838 nuclear sites examined, 837 were
under negative selection (0.99 >p > 0.50) and only one was
under positive selection (p > 0.99) (data not shown). On
the other hand, Tajima’s DT and Fu and Li’s F were significantly positive for ITS1 (D T = 2.979, p < 0.01 and F =
2.193, p < 0.02), not accounting for a selective sweep.
Demographic analysis

ModelTest selected the GTR model for ITS1 [35]. The
values of the parameters and confidence intervals (a =
0.05) were: g = -1.748 [(-4.950)-(-0.289)] and θ = 0.004
[0.002-0.008]. The sign of g indicates that N. cervinus
most likely passed through a bottleneck (i.e. a decline in
population size). In turn, the equation of g implies that
θ was higher in the past.
Prevalence and diversity of Wolbachia in Naupactus
cervinus

A total of 247 individuals of N. cervinus from different
locations were screened by PCR assay using Wolbachia

Page 6 of 15

16 S rDNA gene-specific primers. All of them were positive for Wolbachia infection, as it was demonstrated by
the amplification of a product of approximately 800 bp.
This fragment size was similar to that of the positive
control. No PCR band was obtained from the negative
control.
To investigate multiple infections within N. cervinus,
we focused on 16 sampling sites, including weevils from
both the “forest” and the “grassland” clades (Brazo Largo,
Cerro Azul, Chajarí, El Palmar, Isla Talavera, Oberá, Pergamino, Río Cuarto, Salto Grande, Tandil and Yapeyú
from Argentina, and Alegrete, Laranjeiras do Sul, Santa
Maria, São Sepé and Toledo from Brazil, Figure 4). Sixteen randomly chosen gene fragments wsp, coxA and
fbpA were amplified (one from every sampling site)
and sequenced. All the individuals assayed yielded
identical gene sequences (wsp: ca. 580 bp in length
[GenBank: GQ402145]; coxA: ca. 400 bp in length [GenBank: GU079631.2]; fbpA ca. 430 bp in length [GenBank:
GU079632.1]). Based on these results, we concluded that
only one Wolbachia strain infects this weevil species.
Therefore, although multiple infections could have
occurred, only one would have succeded.
Divergence time estimation

The age of the demographic event (i.e. moderate bottleneck) was calculated through a molecular clock, using
both the nuclear and the mitochondrial datasets.
Table 2 shows a matrix of uncorrected genetic distances among all the nuclear haplotypes (I-VIII). The
relative rate tests indicate that all these nDNA lineages
may have split at a constant substitution rate (p > 0.10
for all comparisons). The average pairwise divergence
among them was D = 0.03198, so the divergence time
for this dataset would be ca. 1.9 Myrs.
Table 3 shows a matrix of uncorrected genetic distances among all the mitochondrial haplotypes (A-R).
As in the former case, the relative rate test indicate that
all these mtDNA lineages may have splitted at a constant substitution rate (p > 0.10 for all comparisons).
Divergence time among all mitochondrial haplotypes is
more recent than that obtained for the nuclear dataset.
Based on an average distance D = 0.00962, it was
400,000 years. The difference between both markers will
be discussed later.
The wsp is the most rapid evolving gene in Wolbachia
[39], but strickingly, it remains invariant in all the individuals assayed. Assuming 0.002 changes per site per
Myrs, the wsp sequence should have accumulated
0.0008-0.0036 changes per site in 0.4-1.9 Myrs. In a
sequence ca. 580 bp in lenght, we should have found
0.46-2 changes. Therefore, invariancy is not an unexpected result.

Discussion
The estimates of mtDNA genetic variation of N. cervinus are similar to those reported for other species of
Curculionidae having similar life history traits (e.g.
[40-42]). There is a remarkable bias in the nucleotide
proportions of mtDNA toward A/T, mainly in the third
positions, which is very common in insects [43,44],
including weevils (e.g. [41,45-49]).

The comparison of the haplotype diversity between
the two markers herein investigated suggests that the
substitution rate of the nuclear genome would be slower
than that of the mitochondrial genome, as it has been
reported for several animal species (see [50] for a
review), including N. cervinus [51].
Apomixis implies clonal transmission of all genomes
and lack of recombination. As a consequence, this kind

of asexual reproduction will induce cosegregation of
mitochondrial and nuclear genotypes and the consequent linkage disequilibrium among all genetic markers
[52,53]. The cosegregation of nuclear and mitochondrial
haplotypes seen in most individuals herein analyzed provides evidence of the clonal transmission of both genomes in N. cervinus. Furthermore, the congruence
between ITS1 and COI phylogenetic trees indicates that
coevolution between these genomes have occurred,
since many phylogenetically related mitotypes share the
same nuclear genotype or viceversa. This phylogenetic
congruence suggests that an ancestral mitochondrial
haplotype and all its derived lineages evolved along with
the same nuclear haplotype across evolutionary times,
possibly as a consequence of the higher substitution rate
for the mitochondrial gene. Therefore, the hypothesis of
ancient linkage disequilibrium and long history of mitonuclear genomic association is strongly supported.
Only a few number of individuals (1.4%) showed signals of recombination. Besides, traces of hybridization
were inferred from individuals carrying at least two
nuclear haplotypes or “double strings” ITS1 sequences
(8.2%) (a more detailed study of this exciting finding is
currently being undertaken). These individuals could be
either remnants of historical gene flow, or the consequence of occasional crosses between parthenogenetic
females of N. cervinus and males of the same or other
related species (as it was reported by Saura et al. [17]
and Stenberg et al. [54] for other weevils with similar
reproductive behavior). However, these sporadic sexual
events would not invalidate the hypothesis of apomixis
for this weevil, since there is clonal transmission of
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, lack of recombination (RM = 0) and non-random association for several
mitochondrial and nuclear sites.
The cytoplasmic location of the Wolbachia endosymbiont and the mitochondrial organelle will naturally
induce linkage disequilibrium among all their genetic
markers. Furthermore, the non-random association
among mitochondrial and nuclear markers would indicate that the nuclear genome is also linked with the
other two. Then, the selective sweep on mtDNA
induced by Wolbachia should have affected also the
nuclear genome.
If the initial Wolbachia infection have sweeped the
mitochondrial diversity, a significant and negative
Tajima’s DT, and a significant and negative NI should be
expected. However, the first statistics suggests selective
neutrality and the second, negative selection. The neutral result from Tajima’s DT test could be explained by
the antiquity of the infection. Most probably, the time
elapsed since this event had been long enough to
recover the genetic variation to levels prior to the initial
selective sweep, increasing Hd and θW values. A similar

Page 9 of 15

result was reported by Shoemaker et al. [55], Keller
et al. [56] and Marshall [57], who proposed ancient
infections for Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera, Formicidae), Chelymorpha alternans (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) and Allonemobius fasciatus-socius species complex
(Orthoptera, Gryllidae). On the other hand, the apparent
contrasting result of the MK test (i.e. negative selection)
might be interpreted under the Nearly Neutral Theory
[27,58-62]. In fact, the value for this statistic would indicate an excess of deleterous mutations, which according
to the mentioned theory, would be fixed by chance only
if the effective population size is small. In other words,
the selective pressure coefficients that operate on the
COI gene would be so small (i.e. nearly neutral), that
elimination cannot occur.
Low nucleotide diversity in the mitochondrial genome
is expected in recently infected species [25,26]. However,
a comparison with the related sexual species Naupactus
xanthographus, which is unifected [19], would indicate
that both species exhibit comparable levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity [63]. This result is interpreted as
another evidence of the ancient Wolbachia infection in
N. cervinus.
Regarding the nuclear gene, even though ITS1 is a
non-functional region, it does not evolve freely in
insects [64]. In sexual species, ca. 40% of nucleotide
sites are implied in complex secondary structures, and
hence under natural selection [65]. Among the 838
sites analyzed herein, 837 showed evidence of negative
selection, which is overwhelming in comparison with
the result of Schlötterer et al. [65]. This bias in the
sites under negative selection could be explained by
the genetic linkage among the three genomes, in agreement with Schön et al. [52]. Then, the negative selection operating on bacterial, mitochondrial or nuclear
genes could also drive other linked nuclear sites to a
similar fate.
The positive Tajima’s D T obtained for the nuclear
gene may suggest a balancing selection, a spatial population structure of the genetic variation or a moderate
bottleneck (after Depaulis et al. [66]). The fact that
directional negative selection was detected for ITS1
rules out the first possibility and points to a demographic phenomenon as the most likely explanation for
the DT result. Indeed, the LAMARC analysis supported
this conclusion, suggesting that N. cervinus could have
suffered a bottleneck, probably as a consequence of the
Wolbachia invasion [67]. The moderate perturbation in
the population size of the initial uninfected population
could have allowed some lineages to survive this
invasion.
Why this demographic phenomenon was not detected
for the mitochondrial gene? The mitochondrial genome
usually undergoes faster evolution than the nuclear

Rodriguero et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:340
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/340

genome (e.g. [68,69]). Thus, the signatures of the bottleneck could have been erased in N. cervinus mtDNA.
Then, the significant Tajima’s DT suggests that the bottleneck was probably ancient, since the traces of this
demographic event are still recovered from the nuclear
dataset, but not from the mitochondrial one.
The fact that all the individuals tested were infected
with the same Wolbachia strain (identified by three
genes of rapid evolution) favors the hypothesis that the
infection of N. cervinus occurred once, and that all
extant haplotypes of this weevil species are descended
from a single ancestral infected female. However, the
positive Tajima’s DT for nDNA suggests a different scenario, according to which at least two genetic lineages
had been infected with the same strain.
The divergence time estimated from mitochondrial and
nuclear datasets allowed us to infer that the bottleneck in
N. cervinus population occurred between 400,0001,900,000 years ago, i.e. during the Plio-Pleistocene, a
geological period of enormous cyclical changes in the
South American forests and grasslands [70,71]. The older
age obtained for nDNA can be attributed to those
lineages that survived the demographic event, which
could produce an overestimation of the calculated age.
On the other side, the younger age inferred for the mitochondrial dataset can be attributed to the faster accumulation of genetic variation, which yielded younger
lineages that decreases the mean distance, leading to an
underestimation of the age. Therefore, nDNA and
mtDNA estimates can be considered as the upper and
the lower age limits of the demographic crash.
The amount of evolutionary change accumulated in
mtDNA is very high in contrast to the lack of change in
wsp, which is the most rapidly evolving gene known in
Wolbachia [39]. However, according to the age estimated for the infection in N. cervinus, wsp might have
accumulated ca. 0.46-2 substitutions in 0.4-1.9 Myrs. So,
lack of variation is not an unexpected result. A similar
wsp invariant pattern was found in other organisms like
sandflies, leaf beetles and fruitflies (e.g. [25,56,72]. An
alternative explanation could be that substitution rates
for mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are different
from those assumed herein, due to asexual reproduction.
In fact, acceleration [73] and deceleration [52] of substitution rates have been reported for species with clonal
reproduction. The first alternative implies a more recent
infection, in agreement with the lack of variation of wsp
Wolbachia gene. However, a decelerated substitution
rate would indicate an age of infection much older than
that herein estimated.
Although our present data do not allow an accurate
inference of the infection age, the high prevalence of
Wolbachia in the whole species distribution contradict
the hypothesis of a recent invasion. In fact, although

Page 10 of 15

prevalence of Wolbachia is usually related to different
phenotypes [74], it can also be associated to the infection
age [23]. As Wolbachia was detected in 100% of the individuals of N. cervinus assayed, its high prevalence is compatible with the hypothesis of an ancient infection.
Our results suggest that Wolbachia “lived together”
with its host N. cervinus at least for a third of its lifespan
[see [33]]. If the origin of the apomictic lineages were
related to this infection, could Wolbachia be responsible
for the extinction of all the bisexual populations of
N. cervinus? Given that some males were collected in
1945 and 1947 in the forests of Northern Argentina and
Southern Brazil [32], it is unlikely that this bacterium
caused their extinction. Rather, the intense deforestation
of the Paranaense forest that occurred during the last 40
years [75] is the most important factor to explain the
extinction of the bisexual populations of this weevil.

Conclusion
We provide first genetic evidence of apomixis for the
weevil Naupactus cervinus. This kind of parthenogenesis, in addition to Wolbachia infection, induces linkage
disequilibrium among three genomes: the nuclear and
mitochondrial weevil genomes and the bacterial genome.
Hence, the mito-nuclear genetic variation of the host
would have been shaped by apomictic reproduction, the
moderate bottleneck probably caused by the initial Wolbachia infection, the long time passed since then, and
the high prevalence of the unique Wolbachia strain
infecting this weevil.
Even if Wolbachia accounts for the origin of parthenogenesis in N. cervinus, this infection would have not
caused the extinction of the bisexual population. The
current absence of males and the lack of sexual reproduction during the last 50 years would be a consequence
of the destruction of the native forest where these populations occurred.
Methods
Sampling and specimens examined

Adults of N. cervinus (Entiminae: Naupactini) were collected during the summers of 2004-2007, on wild and
cultivated plants from several geographic locations of
Argentina, Southern Brazil and Uruguay. Samples from
the countries where the species has been introduced
were also included (see Figure 4 and Table 1) (N =
309). Specimens were collected using a beating sheet (55
cm × 55 cm) and stored at -80°C or in 100% ethanol at
4°C for molecular analyses.
PCR assay and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted following the protocol of Reiss et al. [76]. The negative controls were samples lacking DNA template.

Rodriguero et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:340
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/340

A segment of ca. 700 bp of the Cytochrome Oxidase I
(COI) mitochondrial gene of N. cervinus was amplified
using the specific primers S1718 (5’-GGA GGA TTT
GGA AAT TGA TTA GTT CC-3’) and A2442 (5’-GCT
AAT CAT CTA AAA ATT TTA ATT CCT GTT GG3’) [77] and a nuclear region of ca. 1100 bp using the
primers rDNA2 (5’-TTG ATT ACG TCC CTG CCC
TTT-3’) [78] and rDNA 1.58 S (5’-ACG AGC CGA
GTG ATC CAC CG-3’) [79], which are suitable for
amplifying the region 3’ of the 18 S rDNA gene, plus
the complete ITS1 region (Internal Transcribed Spacer
1) and the 5’ region of the 5.8 S rDNA gene.
Search of multiple Wolbachia lineages within N. cervinus was accomplished through amplification and sequencing of the wsp gene fragment using the primers brought
by Braig et al. [80]: wsp 81F (5’-TGG TCC AAT AAG
TGA TGA AGA AAC-3’) and wsp 691R (5’-AAA AAT
TAA ACG CTA CTC CA -3’), and the most variables
MLST genes for the B supergroup coxA and fbpA, using
the primers designed by Baldo et al. [81]: coxA F1 (5’TTG GRG CRA TYA ACT TTA TAG-3’), coxA R1
(5’-CTA AAG ACT TTK ACR CCA GT-3’), fbpA F1 (5’GCT GCT CCR CTT GGY WTG AT-3’) and fbpA R1
(5’-CCR CCA GAR AAA AYY ACT ATT C-3’).
Prevalence of Wolbachia infection was studied through
amplification of 16 S rDNA gene in ten weevils (whenever it was possible) from every sampling site, using the
primers designed by O’Neill et al. [82]: forward (5’-TTG
TAG CCT GCT ATG GTA TAA CT-3’) and reverse (5’GAA TAG GTA TGA TTT TCA TGT-3’).
Total genomic DNA from Drosophila melanogaster
naturally infected with Wolbachia was used as a positive
control. Negative controls consisted of samples lacking
DNA template from insects and D. melanogaster treated
with tetracyline. D. melanogaster DNA was kindly provided by Dr. Scott O’Neill (Queensland University, Australia). All experiments were repeated at least twice.
Amplification was carried out in a 50 μl volume reaction with 50-100 ng of DNA used as template, 0.5 μM
of each primer, 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 3.0 mM MgCl2,
0.05 units of Taq polymerase and reaction buffer 1×
(Invitrogen). The reactions were performed in a GeneAmp® PCR System 2700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) under the conditions described by Scataglini et
al. [48] for COI and Szalanski and Owens [83] for ITS1
fragments.
Double-stranded PCR products were separated by
electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel with TAE buffer
containing 0.5 mg⁄ml of ethidium bromide. The bands
were excised from the gel and the DNA was purified
with a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc.). DNA
was sequenced using a 3130-XL Automatic Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems).

Sequence analysis

Standard chromatographic curves of forward and reverse
sequences were edited using the Bioedit program [84].
Sequences were translated with the program MEGA v.
4.0.1 [85] to check for the presence of stop codons or
frame shifts which might indicate the amplification of
pseudogenes [86-89]. Aminoacid sequences were
inferred according to the invertebrate mitochondrial
code [34]. Alignment was done using CLUSTAL W [90]
and adjusted by eye.
Quantifying genetic variability

Nucleotide diversity for each gene region was estimated
using Watterson’s (θW) [91] and Tajima’s (θπ) [92] estimators. Haplotype diversity (Hd) was also estimated
according to Nei [93]. All the calculations were performed with DnaSP v. 5.10.00 [94].
Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear
haplotypes were performed by maximum parsimony
using haplotypes as “terminal taxa” with the program
NONA v. 2.0 [95], executed through the interface WinClada v. 1.00.08 [96]. The implicit enumeration search
option was used to get the most parsimonious trees
(number of taxa < 25). All characters were regarded as
unordered and unweighted. For the nuclear dataset, gaps
were treated as fifth state. Clade stability was assessed by
10,000 parsimony bootstrap replications [97]. Naupactus
dissimulator was sequenced to use it as outgroup [GenBank: GQ406844 for COI and GQ406826 for ITS1].
Detecting Linkage disequilibrium

Significant associations between mtDNA and nDNA
sites were tested using linkage disequilibrium analysis
based on the D parameter [98]. This parameter was
obtained with DnaSP v. 5.10.00 [94]. Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons [99,100] was used for
avoiding spurious rejections of the null hypothesis (i.e.
linkage equilibrium).
Detecting Recombination

The population recombination parameter was estimated
with the method of Hudson and Kaplan [101] based on
the minimum number of recombination events in a
sample (RM ) using DnaSP v. 5.10.00 [94]. The significance of the test was calculated by performing 10,000
coalescent simulations based on a Monte Carlo process
with no recombination [102].
Investigating selective sweeps

Tajima’s DT [103] and Fu and Li’s F [104] test statistics
were applied to evaluate whether the frequency spectrum of segregating sites departs from neutral expectations [105] for both datasets. In addition, the MK test

Rodriguero et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:340
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/340

[106] was applied to evaluate a possible correlation
between polymorphism and divergence for the synonymous to non-synonymous variation ratio predicted by
the Neutral Theory [105] only for the mtDNA dataset
(coding sequences). The neutrality index (NI) [107] and
the a parameter [108] were used as indicators of the
degree and direction of departures from neutrality; NI =
1 indicates strict neutrality and NI < 1 suggests an
excess of non-synonymous fixation (i.e. adaptive evolution). The a parameter reflects the proportion of fixed
mutations by positive selection. Unlike DT, MK is highly
recommended when demographic factors can obscure
the results of neutrality tests [27,109,110]. These estimations were performed with DnaSP v. 5.10.00 [94], using
the same outgroup species as mentioned above.
For the non-conding nDNA dataset, the approach
developed by Wong and Nielsen [111] was used. It is a
maximum likelihood method for inferring positive selection in non-coding regions, by comparing non-coding
divergence vs. synonymous divergence. This approach
assumes that synonymous mutations are neutral and
occur at a constant rate within a coding fragment. The
ratio of the estimated nucleotide substitution rate in the
non-coding region to the estimated synonymous substitution rate from the coding region (ξ), provides a
numerical approach to assess whether a non-coding
region has evolved by positive selection. The unit of
evolution is one nucleotide, and ξ is the nucleotide substitution rate in the non-coding region normalized by
the synonymous nucleotide substitution rate in the coding region. Therefore, when a site is subject to neutral
selection, ξ = 1. Similarly, ξ > 1 indicates positive selection, while ξ < 1 suggests the occurrence of negative
selection.
Three models are implemented in the EvoNC software
[111]. The neutral, the two-category, and the threecategory models were used in two different tests to
determine whether a non-coding region is under positive selection. The Test 1 compares the neutral vs. the
three category model, and the Test 2, less conservative,
compares the neutral vs. the two-category model [111].
The two mentioned tests were applied to identify noncoding sites under positive selection, with the coding
sites of the mtDNA being considered as linked to the
ITS1 sites. Therefore, mitochondrial sites were used to
estimate the synonymous evolution rate because nuclear
and mitochondrial genomes were assumed to be linked
to each other and also to Wolbachia genome.
For obtaining ξ, the nucleotide positions must be
optimized on a phylogenetic tree which includes the
sequences under analysis (i.e. the mitochondrial and
nuclear haplotypes concatenated). A matrix of concatenated sequences was built whenever the COI and ITS1
fragments came from the same individual. This matrix

Page 12 of 15

had 21 terminals (including N. dissimulator as
outgroup) of 1,521 bp in length (683 bp COI + 838
bp ITS1).
The phylogenetic tree was estimated through Bayesian
inference. MrModeltest software v. 2.2 [112] was used
to infer the most appropriate model of molecular evolution for each dataset based on the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) [113,114], as suggested by Posada and
Buckley [115].
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed using
the “Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo”
(MCMCMC) algorithm implemented in MrBayes ver.
3.1.2 [116,117]. A partitioned algorithm was used to
account for heterogeneity between the two datasets.
Program defaults were used for estimation of priors.
Two independent analyses were run using a random
starting tree with three heated chains and one cold
chain over 400,000 generations, with sampling every 100
generations.
The tree space was explored using four chains: one
cold chain and three incrementally heated ones, heat
being set as 1/(1 + (i -1) T), where i is the chain number (i.e. 1-4) and T is used as default.
Stationarity of the Bayesian analysis was evaluated
with the methodologies and statistics implemented in
Tracer [118] and AWTY [119,120] and with the standard deviation of the split frequencies. All posterior
samples of a run prior to this point were discarded as
burn-in. Remaining trees were used to construct a 50%
majority-rule consensus tree with mean branch length
estimates. The frequency of all observed bipartitions
was used to assess the level of support for each
node [116,117].
Analyzing demographic structure

Tajima’s test DT [103] results can reveal either selective
or demographic events. To disentangle the demographic
factors for the interpretation of this test, it was necessary to demonstrate that a population bottleneck had
occurred. For this purpose we use the program
LAMARC [121] to estimate the relative effective population size parameter (θ) and the exponential growth rate
(g) by maximum likelihood, as well as the calculation of
95% confidence intervals. Since the maximum likelihood
estimation procedure is computationally intensive, 60
individuals were selected randomly from each dataset
because results do not change significantly at this sample size [122]. Positive values of g indicate population
growth, while negative values indicate shrinkage. The
estimation of the parameters was done using the
MCMCMC sampling algorithm for ITS1 implemented
in LAMARC v. 2.0 [121]. The analysis consisted of two
simultaneous searches with heating temperature
adjusted automatically with 10 initial chains of 5,000

steps sampled every 20 steps, followed by two final
chains of 50,000 steps sampled every 20 steps. Final
most likely estimates (MLEs) were calculated using parameter estimates from two replicated analyses.
The evolution model was selected using the program
ModelTest [123] as previously described. According to
Kuhner et al. [122], the inclusion of unlinked loci
reduces the bias in estimating g with a small amount of
individuals. As the reproductive mode of N. cervinus
makes this recommendation meaningless, the sign of g
was analyzed without taking into account its absolute
value.
Estimating divergence times

Molecular clock estimates were calculated through the
mean divergence time among all nuclear and mitochondrial haplotypes found for N. cervinus. Relative-rate tests
were performed to test the equality of evolutionary rates
between lineages [124] using MEGA v. 4.0.1 [85]. The
divergence times were calculated from the average of
the uncorrected pairwise genetic distances among haplotypes with MEGA v. 4.0.1, using the equation T = D/2k
(where T is the mean divergence time, D is the mean
number of pairwise differences per site, and k is the estimated rate of nucleotide substitution). We decided not
to apply substitution models to correct the pairwise distances, because we considered that the levels of divergence among haplotypes within the same species is low
enough to deserve a correction. In order to estimate
these divergence times, we used a nucleotide substitution rate of 0.85% per site per Myrs for ITS1 [68] and
1.2% per site per Myrs for COI [125].
Additionally, we calculated the expected variation for
Wolbachia wsp gene assuming a nucleotide substitution
rate of 0.2% [126].
