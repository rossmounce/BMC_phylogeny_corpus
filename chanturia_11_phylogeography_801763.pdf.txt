Abstract
Background: Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, displays subspecies-specific differences in
virulence, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity. F. tularensis subsp. holarctica is widely distributed
throughout the Northern Hemisphere. In Europe, F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates have largely been assigned
to two phylogenetic groups that have specific geographic distributions. Most isolates from Western Europe are
assigned to the B.Br.FTNF002-00 group, whereas most isolates from Eastern Europe are assigned to numerous
lineages within the B.Br.013 group. The eastern geographic extent of the B.Br.013 group is currently unknown due
to a lack of phylogenetic knowledge about populations at the European/Asian juncture and in Asia. In this study,
we address this knowledge gap by describing the phylogenetic structure of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates
from the country of Georgia, and by placing these isolates into a global phylogeographic context.
Results: We identified a new genetic lineage of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica from Georgia that belongs to the B.Br.013
group. This new lineage is genetically and geographically distinct from lineages previously described from the B.Br.013
group from Central-Eastern Europe. Importantly, this new lineage is basal within the B.Br.013 group, indicating the
Georgian lineage diverged before the diversification of the other known B.Br.013 lineages. Although two isolates from
the Georgian lineage were collected nearby in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, all other global isolates assigned to this
lineage were collected in Georgia. This restricted geographic distribution, as well as the high levels of genetic diversity
within the lineage, is consistent with a relatively older origin and localized differentiation.
Conclusions: We identified a new lineage of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica from Georgia that appears to have an
older origin than any other diversified lineages previously described from the B.Br.013 group. This finding suggests
that additional phylogenetic studies of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica populations in Eastern Europe and Asia have
the potential to yield important new insights into the evolutionary history and phylogeography of this broadly
dispersed F. tularensis subspecies.

Background
Francisella tularensis is a highly clonal, recentlyemerged pathogen that causes tularemia, which presents
in several main forms: pneumonic (30%-60% mortality),
ulceroglandular, and oropharyngeal [1]. The latter two
are associated with lower mortality. F. tularensis is

currently divided into three subspecies (tularensis,
holarctica and mediasiatica), with F. novicida recognized as a very closely related species, or as another subspecies by some authors [2-4]. These taxa vary in
virulence, geographic distribution, overall genetic diversity, and host/vector associations [3,5-9]. Human tularemia is a disease at which the clinical severity depends
upon the route of infection, subspecies of the infection
strain, and timely therapeutic response [9]. Cases in Europe are caused by F. tularensis subsp. holarctica, and in

many rural areas of the Balkans and countries further
east outbreaks are water-borne, resulting in oropharyngeal tularemia [10-12]. No known cases by F. tularensis
subsp. mediasiatica are known and only a few by F.
novicida have been documented [13,14]. F. tularensis
subsp. tularensis is restricted to North America, whereas
F. tularensis subsp. holarctica is found throughout the
Northern Hemisphere [3,15]. Despite its wider geographic distribution F. tularensis subsp. holarctica has
markedly lower genetic diversity than F. tularensis
subsp. tularensis [5,7,8].
Significant gains toward deciphering the evolutionary
history of F. tularensis overall and, in particular, F. tularensis subsp. holarctica have been made by using whole
genome comparisons for single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) discovery coupled with subsequent canonical SNP
(canSNP) analysis [15,16]. Numerous new groups were
identified within F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (Figure
1A) [15,16], two of which, B.Br.013 (includes subclades B.
Br.013/014 and B.Br.LVS in [15]) and B.Br.FTNF002-00,
were predominant in Europe but geographically segregated [15]. In the Western European countries of Spain,
France, and Switzerland almost all isolates belong to the
highly monomorphic B.Br.FTNF002-00 group [15-18]. In
contrast, in large portions of Central and Eastern Europe,
from the Czech Republic to Russia, most F. tularensis
subsp. holarctica isolates are assigned to various lineages
within the B.Br.013 group [15,16].
Additional analyses of the B.Br.013 group are crucial
for fully understanding the phylogeography of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica in Europe and Asia. This group
contains significant genetic diversity based upon multilocus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis
(MLVA) [15], indicating that considerable phylogenetic
structure may exist that could be revealed with additional analyses. In addition, this group is widely distributed, extending from Eastern Europe into the border
regions of the European/Asian continents. Importantly,
the eastern geographic extent of the B.Br.013 group is
very poorly understood. This is because, to date, it has
not been possible to place F. tularensis isolates from
countries at the boundary of the European/Asian continents and Western Asia, including Georgia, into a larger
phylogeographic context. Based on growth characteristics, biochemical analyses, basic PCR methods, and
DNA sequencing, we know that F. tularensis subsp.
holarctica is the predominant subspecies in Georgia and
in regions further east [11,19-21], but more specific
genetic information is limited. Some isolates from the
European/Asian juncture regions and East Asia have
been genotyped with a subset of VNTRs but have not
been part of any global analyses [10,22,23]. Although
valuable for regional studies, homoplasy associated with

Page 2 of 10

these rapidly-evolving markers restricts their value for
global phylogenetic analyses [24].
In this study, we determined the phylogenetic structure of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates from the
European/Asian juncture country of Georgia by sequencing the genome of a Georgian isolate, comparing that
genome to other available whole genome sequences to
discover SNPs, and screening a subset of the resulting
SNPs across 25 isolates from Georgia. We examined
diversity within the subclades defined by these SNPs
using a multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat
analysis (MLVA) system [25]. To place the Georgian
isolates into an existing global phylogeographic framework [15], we also screened a canonical subset of the
newly discovered SNPs across a large panel of European
isolates belonging to the B.Br.013 group.

Results
Georgian isolate whole genome sequence

Initial analyses with previously described canSNP
assays (See Additional file 1, [15]) revealed that all 25
Georgian isolates belong to the B.Br.013 group. One of
the Georgian strains (F0673) was sequenced using the
Illumina Genome Analyzer II sequencing platform
resulting in very high sequence coverage (averaging
1,076X) when aligned to the LVS genome (See Additional file 2, [26]). Subsequent whole genome sequence
(WGS) comparisons among three published B.Br.013
group genomes (FSC 200, LVS, and RC503), the genome of strain F0673 generated for this study, and the
published OSU18 genome (as an outgroup) revealed
650 putative SNPs. Most of these putative SNPs (n =
470) were phylogenetically located on the branches
separating OSU18 from the genomes in the B.Br.013
group (data not shown). Maximum parsimony analysis
of the putative SNPs produced a phylogeny (Figure 1B)
with a very low homoplasy index (0.02), consistent
with the highly clonal nature of F. tularensis. The phylogenetic topology of the FSC 200, LVS, and RC503
genomes is consistent with previous publications
[15,16], and the small number of putative SNPs unique
to the Georgian strain is consistent with the low
genetic diversity observed among other lineages within
F. tularensis subsp. holarctica [3,6,27,28]. The new
branch (B.Br.027) leading to the Georgian strain arises
from a common ancestor that is basal to the previously
described diversified lineages within the B.Br.013 group
and is separated from them by only 45 putative SNPs,
with 39 of these putative SNPs leading to the Georgian
strain (B.Br.027 in Figure 1B) and the other six putative
SNPs along a branch (B.Br.026 in Figure 1B) defining a
monophyletic lineage containing the other sequenced
strains from this group.

Identification of new lineages and subclades

We designed assays targeting 21 of the 39 putative SNPs
leading to the sequenced Georgian strain (Table 1) and
screened them across the 25 Georgian isolates (Table 2)
to reveal additional phylogenetic structure among these
strains. All 21 SNPs were determined to be real and
assigned the 25 strains to a monophyletic lineage (B.
Br.027; also referred to below as the Georgian lineage)
that includes six new subclades (Figure 2A). We also
designed an assay (Table 1) targeting one of six putative
SNPs along the branch (B.Br.026 in Figure 1B) leading
to the other sequenced strains (FSC 200, LVS, and
RC503) and screened it across DNA extracts from these

three sequenced strains, as well as the 25 strains in the
Georgian lineage. Consistent with the bioinformatics
analyses, DNA extracts from the three sequenced strains
all possessed the derived state for this SNP, whereas the
25 strains in the Georgian lineage all possessed the
ancestral state for this SNP. This confirmed that the
SNP was real and also branch B.Br.026, which leads to
the lineage that gave rise to the previously known subclades within the B.Br.013 group [16]. Altogether, we
identified a total of 7 new branches (B.Br.026-B.Br.032,
Figure 2A) and designated a single canSNP for each of
these branches with corresponding SNP genotyping
assays (Table 1). Designating a single SNP as canonical

for each branch maximizes phylogenetic information
while minimizing the number of required assays by
eliminating redundant SNPs, thus providing a highly
efficient means of determining the phylogenetic positions of isolates for highly clonal pathogens such as F.
tularensis [15,24]. In addition, canSNPs represent standardized phylogenetic positions for comparison in future
studies performed by different research groups.
To understand the relationship of the Georgian lineage to other Eastern European lineages, we genotyped
132 geographically diverse group B.Br.013 isolates collected in Central and Eastern Europe across the B.
Br.026 and B.Br.027 canSNP assays (Figure 2A, see
additional file 3). All resulting genotypes from this
analysis were phylogenetically consistent with no
observed homoplasy. With just two exceptions, all of
these isolates were assigned to the B.Br.026 lineage.
The exceptions were two isolates from the Crimean

region of Ukraine that were assigned to the Georgian
lineage. Subsequent, additional canSNP analyses
assigned these two isolates to the basal B.Br.027/028
subclade within the Georgian lineage. These results
indicate that the Georgian isolates, as well as the two
isolates from Crimea, are phylogenetically distinct from
the previously described F. tularensis subsp. holarctica
subpopulations.
The subclades within the Georgian lineage did not display a differentiated phylogeographic pattern but, rather,
were spatially dispersed in a mixed fashion throughout
Eastern Georgia and the Crimean region of Ukraine
(Figure 2B). The assignment of the Crimean isolates to
the basal B.Br.027/028 subclade within the Georgian
lineage (Figure 2A) confirms that this lineage is not geographically restricted to Georgia, and is suggestive of a
north to south dispersal pattern. That said, the overall
geographic extent of the Georgian lineage is currently

unknown due to the limited sampling in adjacent
countries.
Further discrimination using MLVA

MLVA was used to examine genetic variation within
each identified subclade of the Georgian lineage (Table
2; Additional file 4). Five unique MLVA genotypes were
identified among the 25 Georgian isolates (Table 2) that
were distinct from the MLVA genotypes of strains
found north of Georgia. Calculations of MLVA diversity
(D = G/N) within each subclade (see methods for calculation) showed decreasing levels of diversity within
higher resolution subclades (Figure 2A). The most basal
Georgian subclade, B.Br.027/028 (D = 0.67) (Figure 2A),
was comprised of a single Georgian isolate that was distinguishable from the two Crimean isolates in the same
subclade due to a distinct MLVA genotype. There were
three MLVA genotypes among the seven Georgian isolates within subclade B.Br.028/029 (D = 0.43). A single
MLVA genotype was shared by all seven Georgian isolates in subclade B.Br.029/030 (D = 0.14), and the two
other intermediate subclades (B.Br.030/031 and B.

Br.031/032) contained only a single isolate each. Only a
single MLVA genotype was observed among these two
isolates and the eight isolates in the terminal subclade
B.Br.Georgia (D = 0.13 in subclade B.Br.Georgia) (Figure
2A, Table 2). In general, MLVA diversity trended
towards lower values nearer to the branch tip, consistent
with shorter evolutionary times to generate diversity.

Discussion
The low number of SNPs found globally among F.
tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates suggests that this
subspecies only recently emerged through a genetic bottleneck and then rapidly dispersed across the Northern
Hemisphere [3,7,8,29,30]. The phylogeographic model of
Vogler et al. [15] suggests a North American derivation
for the main F. tularensis subsp. holarctica radiation
that spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere. However, previous analyses of the spread throughout Europe
and Asia were hindered by a lack of isolates from the
regions along the European/Asian juncture and in East
Asia. This study begins to address this knowledge gap
by describing additional phylogenetic structure based

upon 25 isolates from the European/Asian border country of Georgia through the use of SNPs discovered from
whole genome comparisons.
Whole genome sequencing of a Georgian strain
revealed SNPs that placed the Georgian lineage basal to
the diversification of the subclades of the B.Br.026 lineage within the B.Br.013 group [15,16] (Figure 1B). In
addition, a relatively large number of subclades (phylogenetic topology) within the Georgian lineage were discovered amongst a relatively small number of Georgian
isolates. This is fortuitous, and perhaps a consequence
of the selection of Georgian strain F0673 for sequencing
[31,32].
Georgian (B.Br.027) lineage isolates are geographically
distinct from the B.Br.026 lineage isolates. Georgian
lineage isolates appear restricted to regions of the
Ukraine and Georgia, whereas the B.Br.026 lineage isolates are concentrated in Central-Eastern Europe, based
upon the isolates examined here. However, the true geographic extent of the Georgian lineage could not be fully
determined due to the lack of a comprehensive set of
isolates from regions neighboring Georgia. That said, it
is clear that the Georgian lineage is absent from Central
Europe. The geographic division of the B.Br.013 and B.
Br.FTNF002-00 groups into Eastern and Western Europe, respectively, suggests that the common ancestor to
these two lineages, and possibly the Georgian and north
of Georgia lineages (B.Br.027 and B.Br.026, respectively),
existed west of Georgia, although the lack of a comprehensive set of Asian isolates limits our ability to draw
conclusions about the F. tularensis subsp. holarctica
radiation that spread throughout Eurasia. Likewise, data
from our current collection of isolates suggest that F.
tularensis was introduced into Georgia from the north,
though we unfortunately lack comparable isolates from
the Middle East. For the entire F. tularensis subsp.
holarctica radiation in Eurasia, a Scandinavian origin
remains the most robust hypothesis given that Sweden
contains the most phylogenetically diverse set of isolates
in Eurasia, including isolates found in the subclade
immediately basal to the B.Br.013 group [15].
Interestingly, at this regional scale, canSNPs and
MLVA exhibited considerable congruence in identifying
genetic groups. Specifically, canSNPs identified six subclades and MLVA identified five, albeit with slightly different but not phylogenetically inconsistent membership
due to the nature of the two different marker types.
SNPs discovered from whole genome sequences will
typically provide greater discrimination than MLVA, as
seen in subclades B.Br.030/031, B.Br.031/032 and B.Br.
Georgia (Table 2), and can even be used to identify specific strains [33]. However, discovering these rare SNPs
requires whole genome sequencing whereas MLVA can
identify nearly the same number of genetic groups by

Page 7 of 10

simply surveying a few highly polymorphic portions of
the genome. At this regional scale, homoplasy does not
appear to be much of a factor in obscuring phylogenetic
signal for identifying genetic groups using MLVA,
although the relationships among those groups are less
resolved as isolates from adjacent groups share MLVA
genotypes. Together, SNPs and MLVA provide complementary approaches, by first accurately placing isolates
in a phylogeny using SNPs and then discriminating
among isolates within SNP-determined subclades using
MLVA. This step-wise approach has been termed Progressive Hierarchical Resolving Assays using Nucleic
Acids (PHRANA) [24].

Conclusions
We describe a new subpopulation in the B.Br.013 group
from Georgia that is genetically and geographically distinct from the other B.Br.013 group subpopulations
found in Europe. Members of this new lineage are endemic to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia,
though the complete geographic range remains
unknown. The basal positioning of the Georgian lineage
and its restricted geographic distribution illustrates the
need for studies on additional Asian and East European
isolates to gain a better understanding of the clonal
expansion of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica.
Methods
Whole Genome Sequencing

We sequenced a single Georgian isolate (F0673), representing the most common MLVA profile type of F.
tularensis subsp. holarctica found in the country of
Georgia (Chanturia, unpubl. data), using Illumina’s Genome Analyzer II (San Diego, CA). DNA from F0673 was
prepared using a standard chloroform extraction protocol [34]. Library preparation for this isolate involved
sonication of 5 μg genomic DNA to an average fragment
size of 350 bp, followed by sample preparation and cluster generation protocols for paired-end reads from Illumina. The library was quantified using SYBR-based
qPCR and primers modified from the adaptor sequence.
The library was then run in two lanes of the flow cell to
increase overall coverage. Read lengths were ca. 40 bp,
with a final yield of 32 Gb of sequence for the entire
run. Image analysis for base calling and alignments followed the methods of Craig and colleagues [35]. The
entire Sequence Read Archive of F0673 was deposited
to GenBank (SRP003002.2).
SNP Discovery and Analysis

To identify putative SNPs, the Georgian isolate WGS
was aligned with LVS (F. tularensis subsp. holarctica
LVS NC_007880) and was compared to four other
WGSs available from GenBank (F. tularensis subsp.

Chanturia et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:139
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/139

holarctica FSC 200 NZ_AASP00000000, F. tularensis
subsp. holarctica LVS NC_007880 and F. tularensis
subsp. holarctica OSU18 NC_008369) and the Human
Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine (F. tularensis subsp. holarctica RC503 http://www.
hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/microbial-detail.xsp?project_id=144).
Three of these WGSs (FSC 200, LVS, and RC503) were
selected because of their membership in the B.Br.013
group, whereas the OSU18 WGS was selected as an outgroup. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis SCHU S4
(NC_006570) was used for referencing SNP positions.
Two independent approaches were used for SNP discovery, the MAQ algorithm [36] and a custom SNP calling
pipeline. The in-house pipeline used for SNP discovery
first compares WGSs in a pairwise fashion using MUMmer [37] to identify putative SNPs and then uses PERL
and Java Scripts for grouping the discovered SNPs by
shared location, comparing SNPs across all taxa and
tabulating the final putative SNP set according to certain
criteria. Specifically, SNPs from repeated regions, including paralogous genes, apparent tri-state SNPs and SNPs
with an adjacent SNP closer than 11 bp away were
removed from analysis. Furthermore, the SNP locus
must be present in all of the genomes to be included in
the analysis. The software package PAUP 4.0b10 (D.
Swofford, Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA) was
used to construct a whole genome SNP phylogeny (Figure 1B) using maximum parsimony.
CanSNP Selection and Analysis

Thirty-nine putative SNPs specific to the Georgian lineage were identified in the whole genome sequence analysis. Of these, twenty-one were incorporated into meltMAMA genotyping assays, as previously described [15],
except that only GC- rich tails were used on one allele
specific primer [38]. A melt-MAMA assay was also
designed for branch B.Br.026 within the B.Br.013 group.
Allele-specific melt-MAMA primers were designed
using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) (Table 1). All other assay reagents and
instrumentation were as previously described [15]. DNA
templates were extracted using either chloroform [34]
or DNeasy blood and tissue kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Reactions were first raised to 50°C for 2 min to activate
the uracil glycolase, then raised to 95°C for 10 min to
denature the DNA and then cycled at 95°C for 15s and
55°C for 1 min for 33 cycles (Table 1). Immediately
after the completion of the PCR cycle, amplicon melt
dissociation was measured by ramping from 60°C to 95°
C in 0.2°C/min increments and recording the fluorescent intensity. The genome locations, primer sequences
and annealing temperatures for the seven canSNP assays
can be found in Table 1. We screened a geographically
diverse panel of 132 European isolates belonging to the

Page 8 of 10

B.Br.013 group and a geographically diverse panel of 25
Georgian isolates across lineage-specific assays to determine whether they were in the B.Br.026 or the Georgian
(B.Br.027) lineages (see additional file 3, Table 2).
MLVA

All 25 Georgian isolates were screened with an 11-marker MLVA system (Additional file 4) [25]. This was
done in order to determine the level of genetic diversity
within each identified subclade. The MLVA Diversity
(D) was calculated for each subclade using the following
equation: G/N (G = MLVA genotypes; N = number of
isolates). Diversity was not calculated for subclades with
a single isolate.
