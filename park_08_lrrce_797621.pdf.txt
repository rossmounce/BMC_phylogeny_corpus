Abstract
Background: The small leucine-rich repeat proteins and proteoglycans (SLRPs) form an important
family of regulatory molecules that participate in many essential functions. They typically control
the correct assembly of collagen fibrils, regulate mineral deposition in bone, and modulate the
activity of potent cellular growth factors through many signalling cascades. SLRPs belong to the
group of extracellular leucine-rich repeat proteins that are flanked at both ends by disulphidebonded caps that protect the hydrophobic core of the terminal repeats. A capping motif specific to
SLRPs has been recently described in the crystal structures of the core proteins of decorin and
biglycan. This motif, designated as LRRCE, differs in both sequence and structure from other, more
widespread leucine-rich capping motifs. To investigate if the LRRCE motif is a common structural
feature found in other leucine-rich repeat proteins, we have defined characteristic sequence
patterns and used them in genome-wide searches.
Results: The LRRCE motif is a structural element exclusive to the main group of SLRPs. It appears
to have evolved during early chordate evolution and is not found in protein sequences from nonchordate genomes. Our search has expanded the family of SLRPs to include new predicted protein
sequences, mainly in fishes but with intriguing putative orthologs in mammals. The chromosomal
locations of the newly predicted SLRP genes would support the large-scale genome or gene
duplications that are thought to have occurred during vertebrate evolution. From this expanded
list we describe a new class of SLRP sequences that could be representative of an ancestral SLRP
gene.
Conclusion: Given its exclusivity the LRRCE motif is a useful annotation tool for the identification
and classification of new SLRP sequences in genome databases. The expanded list of members of
the SLRP family offers interesting insights into early vertebrate evolution and suggests an early
chordate evolutionary origin for the LRRCE capping motif.

Background
The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) is a widespread structural
motif of 20–30 amino acids easily identifiable at the primary structure level by the characteristic 11-residue hallmark sequence LxxLxLxxNxL, where x means any amino
acid and the consensus Leu and Asn positions are often
substituted by other hydrophobic residues such as Ile, Val,
Phe, Cys, etc [1-5]. Proteins with LRR-architecture typically contain two or more LRRs in tandem and have been
identified in all life forms, from viruses to eukaryotes [6].
The continuously expanding LRR superfamily includes
intracellular, extracellular and membrane-attached proteins characterized by a common modular architecture
specially suited to favour protein-protein interactions [13,5,7-9]. These proteins participate in a variety of important biological functions, including among others cell
adhesion and signalling, platelet aggregation, neural
development, extracellular matrix assembly, bacterial
pathogenicity, disease resistance and immune response
[10-20]. LRR-containing proteins and domains form
curved solenoid structures where each repeat is a turn of
the solenoid. The concave side of the solenoid is defined
by a parallel β-sheet interwoven with a variety of structures in the convex side which include α helices, 310 helices, polyproline II helices, tandems of β turns and short β
strands [1-5,9,21]. The biological roles of LRR proteins
and domains typically relate to their ability to engage in
protein-protein interactions. However, some family members recognize other ligand types such as nucleic acids,
lipopolysaccharides, lipopeptides, and even small compounds such as auxins [19,22-27]. The sites for ligand recognition map preferentially but not exclusively to the
concave sites of the LRR arched structures, as demonstrated by several crystal structures of LRR proteins in
complex with their ligands (see [5] for a recent review).
Recently, some LRR proteins have been shown to form
highly stable dimers through their concave side [28-31]
raising the possibility of alternative scenarios where LRR
dimers are either the functional units or latent forms that
require dissociation prior to ligand binding [32].

A distinct group of LRR proteins from the extracellular
matrix forms the family known as small leucine-rich
repeat proteins and proteoglycans (SLRPs) [10,32-34].
These molecules are emerging as an important family or
regulatory proteins with still undiscovered functions.
They typically control the correct assembly of collagen
fibrils, regulate mineral deposition in bone, and modulate
the activity of potent cellular growth factors through signal transduction [10,33-35]. SLRPs have in common clusters of cysteine residues flanking their LRR domains at
both N- and C-termini. The crystal structures of the two
most studied SLRPs, decorin and biglycan, have been
recently determined [29,31].
SLRPs have been traditionally classified into three classes
(I, II and III) depending on their gene organisation,
number of LRRs and spacing of cysteine residues at the
amino-terminal cluster [10,32,33]. Other LRR molecules
have been subsequently added to the family and two additional, non-canonical classes IV and V have been defined
[34]. Class IV and V SLRPs show clear differences with
those of the three first classes in number of repeats and
internal repeat structure [32,34,36-39]; their classification
as SLRPs is due to functional similarity with canonical
SLRPs, extracellular location, and presence of cysteine
clusters flanking the LRR domain.
Many LRR proteins other than SLRPs are flanked at the Nand C-termini by disulphide-bonded caps that are
thought to protect the hydrophobic core of the first and
last LRRs [2,3]. Both N-terminal and C-terminal capping
motifs are described in databases for protein domain
identification and analysis such as SMART [40], Pfam [41]
and InterPro [42] (Table 1). In the LRR N-terminal capping motif (LRRNT), a single β-strand runs antiparallel to
the main β-sheet and is followed by a short LRR of 20 or
21 residues (Figure 1a). The consensus sequence contains
4 cysteines in a CxnCxCxmC pattern, with n and m being
variable numbers.

The cysteines form a disulphide knot that connects the
antiparallel β strand to the first LRR. This motif is characteristic of all proteins from the SLRP family as well as
secreted or membrane-bound LRR proteins. Its main
structural elements appear to be maintained irrespective
of the number and spacing of cysteines [32]. A variation
of the LRRNT capping motif specific to plants has also
been described (LRRNP, Table 1). Its architecture and
disulphide-bonding topology differs from that of LRRNT,
as observed in the crystal structure of a polygalacturonase
inhibitor from Phaseolus vulgaris [43].
The LRR C-terminal capping motif (LRRCT) contains normally four cysteines that stabilize the local structure with
two disulphide bonds [44-47]. Characteristic of this motif
is an α helix that covers the hydrophobic core of the last
LRR (Figure 1b). This capping motif seems to occur
slightly less often than LRRNT (Table 1) and appears to be
exclusive to animal proteins. Many cysteine-capped LRR
proteins have been automatically annotated as having
either N-terminal or C-terminal capping structures,
although close inspection of their sequences shows that in
many cases both capping motifs are actually present.
In early sequence analyses, Kajava and Kobe classified the
disulphide-bonded C-terminal capping motifs in four different subfamilies, named CF1 to CF4 [2,3]. Sequences
from the CF1 subfamily contain four cysteine residues
and are the ones typically detected by current LRRCT database descriptors in automatic sequence annotation (Table
1). The CF2 subfamily is characterized by only two
cysteines and was defined for some members of the SLRP
family. The CF3 and CF4 subfamilies are specific to G-protein coupled receptors and plants, respectively. Protein
sequence databases do not include separate descriptors
for these four subfamilies, and sequences from the CF2
subfamily are not recognized by current LRRCT descriptors. The structure of the C-terminal capping motif from
the CF2 subfamily was elucidated in the crystal structures
of the protein cores of decorin and biglycan [29,31], both
being representative members of the SLRP family. This
capping motif is structurally quite different from LRRCT
[32]. It extends to the last two LRRs, which are connected
by a single disulphide bond (Figure 1c). The second-to-

last LRR appears to be longer than all the other ones, and
in the crystal structures of decorin and biglycan is
extended laterally from the main LRR fold [29,31]. We
have previously named this longer, extended repeat as the
"ear" repeat, and we will use the term LRRCE throughout
this paper to designate the ear-containing LRR C-terminal
capping motif. All extracellular LRR proteins currently
classified as members of the SLRP family have N-terminal
capping motifs of the LRRNT type, but their C-terminal
motifs show variability. While chondroadherin and nyctalopin C-terminal sequences correspond to that of a typical
LRRCT motif, the SLRPs from the canonical group (which
here refers to classes I, II and III plus extracellular matrix
protein 2, ECM2) show the LRRCE capping motif [29,32].
Podocan, a recent addition to the SLRP family and class V
representative, does not have any C-terminal capping
[32,36].
To investigate if the LRRCE motif is a common structural
feature in other LRR proteins, we have defined characteristic sequence patterns based on a set of sequences from
class I, II and III SLRPs and we have used those patterns in
genome-wide searches. We present in this paper the
results of this analysis.

Results and discussion
A comprehensive list of LRRCE-containing sequences
The final regular expression pattern for the LRRCE capping motif and its mapping to the three-dimensional
structure of bovine decorin are shown in Figure 2. Using
the LRRCE regular expression pattern, a total of 175
sequences were retrieved by ScanProsite from the UniProt
database (Swiss-Prot release 55.1, TrEMBL release 38.1)
[48]. Splice variants were excluded from the search and
sequence duplicates were filtered, resulting in a nonredundant set of 110 UniProt sequences. Figure 3 shows a
selection of aligned LRRCE sequences from this nonredundant set (an extended list of sequences including
accession codes is available in Additional File 1), plus two
sequences from urochordates (discussed later). The
LRRCE regular expression pattern was accurate: all
sequences in this UniProt set were of proteins with LRR
architecture and had a repeat structure that identified
them as canonical SLRPs, with the LRRNT capping motif

Mapping2ofskeletal representation of the LRRCE structure
Mapping of the regular expression pattern of the
LRRCE motif on a skeletal representation of the
LRRCE structure from bovine decorin [29]. The motif
includes the laterally extended ear repeat, shown as a Cα
trace in blue, the following LRR (in green Cα trace), and the
final β-strand closing the domain (red Cα trace). The regular
expression pattern used in this study, written in PROSITE syntax [79], was: [LIV]-X(2)-[LVIYFMA]-X-[LIFM]-X(2)-[NH]-X[ILVF]-X(2)-[VIMFLY]-X(4)-[FIMLV]-C-X(7,20)-[LYIMV]X(2)-[ILVTMF]-X-[LVMI]-X(2)-N-X-[IVLMAFT]-X(8,9)[FYMPVAIS]-X-C. In PROSITE syntax each conserved position is shown either as a single amino acid (e.g. C, N) or all
possible amino acids for that position enclosed within brackets (e.g. [ILVF] indicates that such position is occupied by Ile,
Leu, Val or Phe); each variable position is shown with a letter
X. Numbers in parentheses indicate stretches of variable
positions (e.g. X(7,20) indicates a stretch of between 7 and
20 variable amino acids). Amino acid preferences for each
position are shown in two boxes in "weblogo" form [87].
The conserved sequence positions for the ear repeat on the
LRRCE motif are designated as P1, P4, P6,..., P20, and those
for the following LRR as Q1, Q4, Q6,..., Q23. The side chains
show the amino acids occurring at these conserved positons

at the N-terminus and the LRRCE capping motif at the Cterminus. The pattern was also comprehensive: all proteins known to belong to the canonical group of SLRPs or
annotated as similar to them were retrieved in the search.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/599

Sequences of LRRCE motifs from the UniProt non-redundant set were used in similarity searches with BLAST to
retrieve additional LRRCE-containing sequences (see
Methods). For most SLRPs, the LRRCE motifs are largely
coded by the last exon from their corresponding genes.
Thus, probe sequences just encompassing different
LRRCE motifs were useful for quickly locating SLRP genes
in genomes at early stages of annotation or for searching
new SLRPs on the genomes of invertebrates and early
chordates (see below). The extended list of 280 hits with
their LRRCE sequences and accession codes, including
those obtained from the NCBI and ENSEMBL databases,
is provided in Additional File 1. The LRRCE regular
expression pattern discussed earlier is consistent with all
but seven of the sequences in this extended list. Three of
these exceptions are incomplete sequences due to missing
genomic data, and two more are predicted sequences with
only one change with respect to the LRRCE pattern. Probably the only significant exceptions were the LRRCE
sequences for the chicken and lizard homologues of
ECM2, which contain an additional insertion (see Additional File 1). Many of the sequences found in similarity
searches are from predicted model assemblies from
genomes in early stages of annotation, and therefore some
of the assignments should be considered preliminary.
Structure of the LRRCE capping motif
The LRRCE motif encompasses the ear repeat, which is
extended laterally, the LRR following it, and the final βstrand closing the domain (Figure 2). The regular expression pattern runs from the beginning of the ear repeat to
the second cysteine residue. Sequence conservation in
LRRCE motifs across the different SLRPs follows largely
structural dictates, with the highly conserved positions
mainly corresponding to the core hydrophobic or asparagine residues characteristic of the LRR architecture, plus
the two cysteine residues that are connected by a disulphide bond (Figure 2). Several additional positions show
distinct preferences for polar or charged amino acids. The
corresponding residues in the bovine decorin structure
participate in a network of stabilizing charge-charge and
hydrogen-bonding interactions between repeats. Thus, it
is likely that similar interactions will be conserved in the
other LRRCE-containing proteins to impart stability to the
capping motif. Residue conservation in the ear itself is
comparatively poor between closely related proteins (for
example, between decorin and biglycan), but higher for
the same protein across species (see examples in Figures 3
and Additional File 1). This pattern of conservation suggests that the ear extension contributes to the functional
specialisation of the canonical SLRPs. For most sequences,
the ear extension is 11–13 residues long (from the first
cysteine to the first residue of the second LRR), and only
keratocan and PRELP sequences show consistently long
extensions. A buried lysine residue shown to stabilize the

ear conformation in the crystal structure of decorin [29] is
conserved as lysine or arginine in all class I and III
sequences, whereas in class II sequences the same position
is occupied by an aromatic or leucine residue. Fibromodulin, osteoglycin and epiphycan sequences show conserved N-linked glycosylation sites in their ear extensions.
Additional potential N-linked glycosylation sites appear
with varying degrees of conservation on different regions
of the two repeats forming the LRRCE motif.
LRRCE motifs are always C-terminal
The LRRCE motif is a genuine C-terminal motif, with no
instance of an equivalent architecture in the middle of an
LRR domain or protein. The C-terminus is typically 9–15
residues away from the conserved second cysteine. The
exception is the group of OMD sequences, which contain
an extended C-terminal tail of about 60 residues after the
LRRCE motif. This tail contains a stretch of negatively
charged residues that presumably shares some functional
role with the negatively charged glycosaminoglycan
chains attached to the N-termini of decorin or biglycan, or
the polyanionic stretches seen in the N-terminal region of
asporin or preceding the LRR domain in ECM2.

The LRRCE motif can be related structurally to internal,
disulphide-bonded LRR pairs that occasionally occur in
LRR proteins. These LRRs do not show the lateral extensions characteristic of the LRRCE motifs. These intradomain, disulphide-bonded LRR pairs are much more
widely distributed than LRRCE, as they occur in different
LRR protein families from bacteria to humans. One such
linkage can be seen in the three-dimensional structure of
the ectodomain of Toll-like receptor 3 [49,50]. This structure is formed by a tandem of 25 LRRs capped by LRRNT
and LRRCT motifs, and contains one internal disulphidebonded LRR pair.
The LRRCT and LRRCE structural motifs appear to be
unrelated
There is no obvious relation between the LRRCT and
LRRCE motifs, at least from sequences available to date. A
conserved feature in the LRRCT capping motif is the presence of two or more Trp residues that contribute to maintain the hydrophobic core at the C-terminal end. A
common sequence at the beginning of LRRCT motifs is
NPWxCxCx3Wx3W, where the second and third Trp residues are located on the inner side of the α-helix characteristic of the LRRCT structure (Figure 1b). Conversely, Trp
residues are not particularly conserved in the LRRCE
sequences (Figure 3 and Additional File 1), and the only
Trp residue in the structure of bovine decorin [29] is
exposed to the solvent and does not participate in the
hydrophobic core of the C-terminal end of the LRR structure.

A new class of canonical SLRPs, with sequences similar to
ECM2
A cluster analysis of the extended set of LRRCE-containing
sequences is shown in the form of a phylogenetic tree
inferred from a multiple sequence alignment of the
LRRCE motifs (Figure 4 and Additional File 2). The
sequences group themselves in the canonical SLRP classes
(I, II and III), plus an additional cluster containing ECM2
and related sequences. Class I includes asporin (ASPN),
decorin (DCN) and biglycan (BGN) sequences. Class II
contains two groups and could in fact be subdivided into
IIa with lumican (LUM) and fibromodulin (FMOD)
sequences, and IIb with osteomodulin (OMD), keratocan
(KERA) and prolargin (PRELP) sequences. Class III
includes sequences for opticin (OPTC), epiphycan
(EPYC) and osteoglycin (OGN), also known as mimecan.
The new "class A" is discussed later and includes the
sequences of extracellular matrix protein 2 (ECM2),
ECM2-like protein from the X chromosome (ECMX),
ECM2-like predicted proteins upstream of the DCN gene
in fish genomes (ECMZ), and the small leucine-rich
repeat protein from Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi
(SLRP1) (see below). The same clustering was obtained
using the complete SLRP sequences (not shown), indicating that the LRRCE sequences on their own are useful for
canonical group SLRP classification.
The LRRCE motif is unique to chordates
Given the exclusive vertebrate lineage of all sequences
obtained in the UniProt set, searches with LRRCE
sequences were carried out against several invertebrate
genomes including Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Apis
mellifera (honeybee) [51], Anopheles gambiae (malaria
mosquito), Aedes aegypti (yellowfever mosquito) [52],
Caenorhabditis elegans (worm) and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) [53]. Of particular interest was the
genome of the sea urchin, as this organism appears to
have retained some of the genes later observed only in vertebrates [53]. All the genomes investigated have large
numbers of LRR proteins, many of those with LRRNT capping motifs. However, the searches failed to produce any
true match of LRR proteins containing LRRCE motifs in
these invertebrate genomes. Two LRR protein sequences
from mosquito (Q16VM2_AEDAE and Q17NB1_AEDAE
in TrEMBL) are currently annotated (incorrectly) as putative lumicans, although they lack recognizable LRRNT
caps and neither their repeat lengths nor amino acid
sequences correspond to those of lumican proteins. Nonchordate LRR protein sequences are often homologous to
non-SLRP proteins such as toll-like receptors or slit proteins, and C-terminal disulphide-capping often occurs
through the more common LRRCT type.

Unrooted phylogenetic tree of an expanded set of LRRCE-containing sequences, including those from UniProt, NCBI and ENSEMBL databases. Sequences group themselves in four main SLRP classes, and the class II branch has
been split into two subclasses IIa and IIb. See text for the abbreviations describing each SLRP type. The positions of several
sequences specifically discussed in the text are indicated with bold-type numerals: 1, SLRP1 sequences from Ciona intestinalis
and Ciona savignyi; 2, biglycan-like (BGL) and decorin-like (DCL) sequences from sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus; 3, keratocanlike (KERAL) sequence from lamprey; 4, epiphycan-like (EPYL) sequence from lamprey; 5, cluster of second copies of fibromodulin (FMOD2) exclusive to fish genomes; 6, cluster of second copies of lumican (LUM2) exclusive to fish genomes; 7, cluster of second copies of osteoglycin (OGN2) exclusive to fish genomes. This tree was calculated based on the sequence
alignment of the LRRCE motifs. A larger version of this figure, with legible sequence names at the end of the phylogenetic tree
branches, is provided as Additional File 2.

LRRCE motifs in early chordates: implications for SLRP
evolution
Similarity searches using LRRCE sequences were then carried out against the genomes of the early chordates
amphioxus (lancelet), Branchiostoma floridae [54], and the
ascidians Ciona intestinalis [55] and Ciona savignyi [56].

Only one gene containing the LRRCE motif was found for
each Ciona species. This gene, referred to here as SLRP1,
has been proposed as representative of the ancestor of all
modern canonical SLRPs [57]. Two model assemblies
have been proposed for the Ciona intestinalis gene resulting in proteins with different numbers of LRRs (Figure 5).

Figure 5
Two different gene assembly models for the only LRRCE-containing sequence in Ciona intestinalis
Two different gene assembly models for the only LRRCE-containing sequence in Ciona intestinalis. Sequences
encoded by separate exons are shown in different colours (red-black-blue) for clarity. The long model assembly (left) contains
8 exons and 15 LRRs in its LRR domain. The same gene assembly model is used for the homologous protein in Ciona savigny.
The short model assembly on the right contains 7 exons and 12 LRRs in its LRR domain; one and a half exons are skipped
resulting in the removal of the underlined amino acids from the long form. Both models were generated using prediction algorithms. The short model was part of the first draft for the Ciona intestinalis genome [55] (JGI assembly version 1.0, ci148160),
but was later withdrawn in JGI version 2.0 in favour of the longer model. Available EST data (see gene and transcript entries
ENSCING00000012194, ENSCINT00000023142 in the ENSEMBL database), has confirmed the long assembly model with 15
LRRs.

These two assemblies only differ in the prediction of one
additional exon-intron boundary in the short model,
which results in the skipping of one and a half exons from
the long model. The long model assembly for the Ciona
intestinalis SLRP1 gene has been confirmed by EST data
(Figure 5). The resulting protein sequence has 15 LRRs in
which repeats alternate their lenghts following a predominant 21-24-26 pattern; this repeat structure is very similar
to that seen in the ECM2 sequences from vertebrates [32].
The cluster analysis of LRRCE motifs (Figure 4) places the
SLRP1 sequences of Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savigny in
the same group as ECM2 and related sequences. The alternating pattern of repeat lengths (21-24-26) is common to
SLRP1 as well as a Ciona gene representative of the podocan ancestor [57], suggesting that such an alternating
repeat sequence was already present in a common precursor of these two lineages. This observation is consistent
with the concept of tandem LRR supermotifs characteristic
of the evolutionary history of the SLRP family [58].

An interesting possibility is that shorter, 12-LRR SLRPs
(such as these from classes I and II), originated by exon
skipping from an ancestral SLRP gene with 15 LRRs similar to SLRP1 from Ciona, in a manner illustrated by the
short model assembly shown in Figure 5. Such exon skipping would have occurred after duplication of this ancestral SLRP gene. The two genes could have later evolved
after additional tandem and large-scale duplication events
into two independent lineages, one for ECM2 and ECM2like proteins (discussed below), and another for the class
I and class II SLRPs. Class III SLRPs would have originated
by further exon skipping on the class I and II ancestor,
after its divergence from the ECM2 lineage ancestor.
No gene containing an LRRCE motif could be detected in
the currently available release of the amphioxus genome
(Branchiostoma floridae, JGI version 1.0) [54]. Sequence
similarity searches using the protein sequences of the
three SLRP proteins from Ciona (Figure 5 and [57]) pro-

duced putative orthologues of podocan and chondroadherin (data not shown), and partial hits to many nonSLRP protein sequences with LRR architecture (several
cell-surface receptors, slit-like proteins, etc). However, the
searches failed to return any clear orthologues of the
canonical SLRPs or any sequence containing a LRRCE
motif. Queries using sequences conforming to LRRCE
motifs from Ciona yielded no hits either. The apparent
absence of LRRCE-containing genes in Brachiostoma is
intriguing. Cephalochordates (amphioxus) have been traditionally considered to be the primitive chordates that
most resemble vertebrates, but this view has been very
recently contradicted by the genome sequence data that
suggests that tunicates (which include the ascidians), are
more closely related to vertebrates than cephalochordates
[59]. This finding raises the possibility that the first
LRRCE-containing SLRP genes appeared after the divergence of cephalochordates from the rest of the tunicatevertebrate lineage. Alternatively, the gene equivalent to
SLRP1 from Ciona was already present in a common
ancestor of all chordates but may have been lost in the
cephalochordate lineage.

Agnathans show already an expanded set of SLRP
sequences
Searches for LRRCE motifs against the current release of
the sea lamprey genome Petromyzon marinus (Genome
Sequence Center, Washington University) produced six
LRRCE-containing sequences. Two of them correspond to
previously reported biglycan-like proteins [60], whereas
the four additional hits correspond to predicted partial
sequences similar to decorin (two sequences), epiphycan
(one sequence) and keratocan (one sequence). We have
named these sequences biglycan-like proteins 1 and 2
(BGL1 and BGL2), decorin-like proteins 1 and 2 (DCL1
and DCL2), epiphycan-like protein (EPYL) and keratocan-like protein (KERAL) (Table 2). Although these data
should still be considered preliminary, the sequences represent the earliest examples to date of class I, II and III
SLRPs, suggesting that the divergence of the SLRP ancestor
into three classes, following gene duplication, occurred
before the lamprey-gnathostome split. Completion of the
lamprey genome and possible identification of additional
copies of EPYL and KERAL genes will clarify the relation
between individual SLRP gene duplications and the largescale gene or genome duplication that is thought to have

occurred before the divergence of lampreys from gnathostomes [57,61,62].
The LRRCE motif is a useful annotation tool for extending
the SLRP family
The LRRCE capping motif is useful in sequence annotation as it appears to be exclusive to the canonical group of
SLRPs. The presence of an LRRCE motif in a newly predicted protein sequence is sufficient for its quick identification and classification as a member of the canonical
group of SLRPs (and also into one of its classes). The
amino acid sequences of LRRCE motifs can be used as
probes in similarity searches against translated genomic
databases (TBLASTN). These searches can identify the
locations and partial sequences of new putative SLRP
genes in genomes at different levels of completion (as
shown with the lamprey example). Using these probes, it
is also possible to detect exons or domains that are missing in current assembly models of SLRP genes but nevertheless present in the genome (data not shown).

Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 show partial phylogenetic trees for
each SLRP class, inferred from multiple sequence alignments of LRRCE-containing sequences from a subset of
genomes (see Methods). Not all SLRP sequences have
been found in all genomes. This could be owing to incomplete coverage in some of these genomes or to genuine
absence of particular genes due to gene loss. For example,
it has been known for some time that chickens do not
have a BGN gene [63], and unsurprisingly no such gene
has been found in searches against the chicken genome.
Interestingly, the BGN gene is present in fishes, reptiles
and mammals. The genomes of ray-finned fishes
(zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, and the pufferfishes)
appear to have an extended set of SLRPs, with additional
copies of fibromodulin (FMOD2), lumican (LUM2), osteoglycin (OGN2) or biglycan (BGN2) genes (Figures 6, 7,
8, 9), and yet seem to have mostly lost the genes for OMD
and OPTC (with the exception of zebrafish, which appears
to have retained a particularly complete set of SLRP
genes).
Newly predicted SLRP sequences related to ECM2 in fishes
and mammals
Several ECM2-like genes have also been predicted both in
fishes and mammalian genomes (Figures 4 and 10; see
also Additional File 1 for sequences and accession codes).
A particularly interesting example is that of a protein
sequence similar to ECM2 that was first predicted in the
genome of zebrafish (Danio rerio, accession codes
Q1LYN3, XP_690561).

This sequence, referred to here as ECMX for reasons
explained later, is predicted upstream of the biglycan gene
(Figure 11), in a completely analogous manner to the

them) in vertebrates, and have not been retained in mammals, birds or reptiles. Given the number of ECM2-like
sequences and their own clustering with the SLRP1 Ciona

from which all the canonical SLRPs derived, we name this
new class "class A", for ancestral SLRPs. The similarity

between the ECM2-ASPN gene tandem and the predicted
ECMX-BGN and ECMZ-DCN tandems (Figure 11)
strongly supports the notion of SLRP evolution by tandem
and large-scale gene duplications as well as tandem gene
migration [57,64]. The duplicate copies of SLRP genes
exclusive to ray-finned fishes (LUM2, FMOD2, OGN2,
BGN2) appear in the same chromosomes as other SLRP
sequences (Figure 11). These duplicates may be survivors
of the proposed, fish-specific large-scale gene or genome
duplication that would have occurred after the divergence
between the actinopterygian (ray-finned fishes) and sarcopterygian (coelacanth, lungfish and all land vertebrates) lineages [65-68]. Not all the zebrafish SLRP genes
shown in Figure 11 have been identified in the other fish
genomes, reflecting the fact that different teleost fishes
have retained different sets of duplicate genes [69,70].
Comparison of the zebrafish and fugu genomes have

revealed that despite a high degree of synteny and retention of a similar number of duplicates, in a significant
number of cases, different paralogues have been preserved
[70].
Finally, the chromosomal organization of the canonical
SLRP genes in mammals follows the order shown in Figure 11 for the human and bovine genomes, where the
class A paralogue is followed downstream by those from
classes I, IIa, IIb and III. This organization would suggest
that the ECMX-BGN pair might have been initially part of
the FMOD-PRELP-OPTC gene cluster that currently is
located in the chromosome 1 in humans, and later
migrated to the X chromosome (as postulated for the BGN
gene in [64]). A hypothetical class IIa gene downstream of
ASPN would have disappeared completely, potentially by
pseudogenisation. The fish SLRP genes share in part this

chromosomal organization (Figure 11), and the class A
SLRP upstream of the DCN gene can still be recognized in
the predicted ECMZ sequences. An exception is presented
by the LUM2 (class IIa) sequence in fishes, which appears
intercalated between the FMOD (IIa) and PRELP (IIb)
genes but is missing in non-fish genomes. The LUM2
sequence could have originated from additional local
gene duplication in fishes or could have migrated from a
different SLRP gene cluster. The presence of the additional
fish SLRP duplicates (BGN2, FMOD2 and OGN2) points
towards a complex history of local and large-scale duplications as well as gene migration for the surviving set of
fish SLRPs.
Possible biological roles for LRRCE motifs
Probably the main role of the LRRCE motifs is to stabilize
the LRR structures of the SLRPs by providing a disulphidebonded C-terminal capping structure, in a similar manner
to the LRRCT capping motifs present in many sequences
of extracellular or membrane-associated LRR proteins.
The requirement of disulphide-bonding integrity for SLRP
biological actitvity has been demonstrated for decorin
[71] and fibromodulin [72]. Furthermore, thermal denaturation of decorin appears to be completely reversible as
long as the disulphide bonds are not reduced [31].

Several diseased states have been associated to mutations
occurring in the LRRCE regions of some SLRPs. Two different frame shift mutations on the decorin gene due to
single base pair deletions in the LRRCE coding region
have been linked to congenital stromal dystrophy of the
cornea [73,74]. Both mutations are predicted to result in
a truncated decorin protein missing the last 33 C-terminal

amino acids. Another mutation resulting in a premature
stop codon in the ear extension of keratocan (R313X) has
been linked to autosomal recessive cornea plana [75,76].
These two truncations would eliminate most of the
LRRCE structure in decorin and keratocan. Three amino
acid substitutions in the LRRCE motif of opticin have
been linked to high myopia [77], probably through disruption of the local tertiary structure. In all these examples, the predicted truncation or alteration of the LRRCE
structure is likely to have a detrimental effect in the stability of the entire LRR domains of these SLRPs.
A direct role of the ear extensions in ligand binding
remains an attractive yet still hypothetical scenario. The
expanded set of LRRCE sequences presented here shows
clear conservation trends across species in the ear extensions of a given SLRP, whereas these extensions are poorly
conserved between closely related SLRPs. Thus, the ear
extensions could help to differentiate the roles of SLRPs
belonging to the same class. In known structures of LRR
domains or proteins it is not uncommon to find extended
repeats where the polypeptide chain loops out from the
expected path of a regular LRR to rejoin it some residues
later [5]. These extensions may have functional significance, as shown for example by the so-called β-switch and
β-finger in the structure of glycoprotein Ibα [44,45].
Future biochemical and mutagenesis analyses on the SLRP
ear extensions will be necessary to elucidate any functional role of these structures in ligand recognition and
binding.

Conclusion
The LRRCE capping motif identified in the structures of
the representative SLRPs decorin and biglycan appears to
be a structural element exclusive to the main group of
SLRPs, which includes the previously described classes I,
II and III, plus a new class of ancestral genes that includes
ECM2, the SLRP1 sequences from Ciona, and other ECM2like sequences present mainly in fishes but with intriguing
orthologues in mammals, including a yet uncharacterized
new SLRP in the human X chromosome. The LRRCE motif
appears to have evolved during early chordate evolution
and is not found in non-chordate LRR protein sequences.
Such evolutionary history is probably related to the
known interactions of SLRPs with fibrilllar collagens and
their regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis [10,33,34].
Given its exclusivity to the SLRP family, the LRRCE motif
is a useful annotation tool for the identification and classification of new SLRP sequences in genome sequencing
efforts. Analysis of LRRCE-containing sequences of organisms located phylogenetically between critical evolutionary events will provide useful clues for understanding the
history of large-scale gene and genome duplications that
appear to have occurred during vertebrate evolution. The
expanded list of SLRP sequences, provided here for the
first time, will facilitate the analysis of residue conservation trends in functionally significant sequence motifs,
and ultimately will be useful for the elucidation of the full
range of biological functions of this important family of
extracellular matrix molecules.

Methods
Regular expression pattern and sequence retrieval
An initial set of 58 protein sequences annotated as SLRPs
from classes I (21 sequences), II (24 sequences) and III
(12 sequences) plus ECM2 (1 sequence) were selected
from the Swiss-Prot database (52.1 release, http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot) and aligned using CINEMA
[78]. This alignment was used together with the crystal
structures of decorin and biglycan (PDB codes 1XKU and
2FT3 respectively), to define a characteristic regular
expression pattern using PROSITE syntax [79]. This pattern, designated as LRRCE hereupon, was used to retrieve
additional sequences from the UniProt database (SwissProt release 55.1, TrEMBL release 38.1) [48] using the
ScanProsite tool [80]. The LRRCE regular expression pattern was refined in iterative cycles until no further
sequences were obtained. The final LRRCE expression pattern, in PROSITE syntax [79], was: [LIV]-X(2)-[LVIYFMA]X-[LIFM]-X(2)-[NH]-X-[ILVF]-X(2)-[VIMFLY]-X(4)[FIMLV]-C-X(7,20)-[LYIMV]-X(2)-[ILVTMF]-X-[LVMI]X(2)-N-X-[IVLMAFT]-X(8,9)-[FYMPVAIS]-X-C.

[81] and ENSEMBL [82] databases. Sequences of LRRCE
motifs from different organisms were used to query the
different databases. Given the early stages of annotation
of some of the genomes, some predicted sequences were
manually corrected using supporting genome and EST
data. The sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW [83]
as implemented in the Kyoto University Bioinformatics
Center http://align.genome.jp.
Phylogenetic analyses
The phylogenetic analysis shown in Figure 4 was inferred
from a multiple sequence alignment of the LRRCE motifs
of the 280 sequences retrieved by ScanProsite and the similarity searches described above. The complete list of
sequences used in this study and their accession numbers
are provided in Additional File 1. Separate phylogenetic
analyses were performed for each SLRP class on a reduced
set of sequences from two mammals (human and bovine
or horse), two birds (chicken and quail), lizard (anole),
frog (Xenopus), four teleost fishes (zebrafish, stickleback,
fugu and Tetraodon), lamprey, and the two Ciona species
(Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). For each class, phylogenetic analyses were inferred from a gap stripped multiple alignment
of the selected sequences generated using CLUSTALW
[83] and analyzed by three different independent phylogenetic methods. Neighbour-joining (NJ) trees and bootstrap replicates were generated using SEQBOOT,
PROTDIST, NEIGHBOR and CONSENSE from the
PHYLIP package [84] using default settings. Maximum
Likelihood trees were inferred using PROML from the
PHYLIP package using default settings. Bayesian tree inference values were produced using the MrBayes programme
[85], where Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis was performed for 100,000 generations using 6 chains. Cladecredibility values indicating statistically probable clades
(>60%) are indicated from the three methods on the NJ
trees (Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), and UniProt organism abbreviations are used for sequence identification: XENTR,
Xenopus tropicalis (western clawed frog); ANOCA, Anolis
carolinensis (anole lizard); CHICK, Gallus gallus (chicken);
COTJA, Coturnix japonica (Japanese quail); DANRE, Danio
rerio (zebrafish); GASAC, Gasterosteus aculeatus (stickleback); TETNG, Tetraodon nigroviridis (green pufferfish);
FUGRU, Fugu rubripes (Japanese pufferfish); PETMA,
Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey); CIOIN, Ciona intestinalis (transparent sea squirt); CIOSA, Ciona savignyi (Pacific
transparent sea squirt).
