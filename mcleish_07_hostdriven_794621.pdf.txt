Abstract
Background: Insects that feed on plants contribute greatly to the generation of biodiversity.
Hypotheses explaining rate increases in phytophagous insect diversification and mechanisms driving
speciation in such specialists remain vexing despite considerable attention. The proliferation of
plant-feeding insects and their hosts are expected to broadly parallel one another where climate
change over geological timescales imposes consequences for the diversification of flora and fauna
via habitat modification. This work uses a phylogenetic approach to investigate the premise that the
aridification of Australia, and subsequent expansion and modification of arid-adapted host flora, has
implications for the diversification of insects that specialise on them.
Results: Likelihood ratio tests indicated the possibility of hard molecular polytomies within two
co-radiating gall-inducing species complexes specialising on the same set of host species. Significant
tree asymmetry is indicated at a branch adjacent to an inferred transition to a Plurinerves ancestral
host species. Lineage by time diversification plots indicate gall-thrips that specialise on Plurinerves
hosts differentially experienced an explosive period of speciation contemporaneous with climatic
cycling during the Quaternary period. Chronological analyses indicated that the approximate age
of origin of gall-inducing thrips on Acacia might be as recent as 10 million years ago during the
Miocene, as truly arid landscapes first developed in Australia.
Conclusion: Host-plant diversification and spatial heterogeneity of hosts have increased the
potential for specialisation, resource partitioning, and unoccupied ecological niche availability for
gall-thrips on Australian Acacia.

Background
Determining the driving forces behind the diversification
of phytophagous insects remains a central challenge to
biology. Increases in insect species numbers can be
expressed as an outcome of their feeding on plants [1,2].
The evolution of this type of ecological relationship
between specialists and patterns of host-plant affiliation

has been well documented [3-12]. The majority of phytophagous insect species are specifically associated with,
and generally show preference for, single plant families,
and this relationship is presumed to be evolutionarily
conservative. This association is displayed in the narrow
food specialisation and life habits of the majority of insect
species. The mechanisms responsible for the generation of

diversity in plant-insect systems are usually thought to
result from cospeciation, or frequent host switches followed by specialisation. Host range expansion is believed
to provide opportunities for vicariance, and the subsequent effects of selection or drift fuels the diversification
of specialists [13]. This is in line with predictions that
reciprocal radiations should occur for some insect-plant
associations [4,14,15] where the proliferation and distribution of endoparasites and their hosts are expected to
emulate one another.
The evolution of endemic biodiversity in contemporary
Australia has primarily arisen over a period of increasing
aridity during the late Tertiary period [16-20]. Truly arid
landscapes appear some time towards the end of the
Miocene, and more recently, dramatic changes to the terrestrial environment occurred during the Quaternary
period, when glacial-interglacial cycling drove a rapid
increase in desertification. The aridification of Australia
modified habitat enhancing the evolution of flora, including sclerophylly. Range expansion and contraction of sclerophylly during glacial cycling [21-23] would be expected
to provide opportunity for explosive speciation [1517,24-31]. However, the proposal that faunal and floral
diversification in Australia has been partly driven by climatic glacial-interglacial cycling effects over the last 2–3
million years remains a point of conjecture and is difficult
to test [32].
Global patterns of gall-inducing species richness are
believed to increase from mesic to xeric environments
across transitional vegetation gradients from mesophytic
to sclerophyllous plants [29,33-36]. Species-specific gall
induction by thrips (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) on
closely related desert Acacia (Leguminosae) trees has
likely evolved as a consequence of the developing arid
landscape [27,37-39]. Acacia is a prominent endemic Australian xeromorphic plant genus [39] and the most speciose plant genus on the continent, distributed throughout
arid and semi-arid regions that cover over 70% of the Australian landmass [26,40]. The presence of sclerophyllous
phyllodes (leaf-like modified petiole) is characteristic of
Acacia on which gall-thrips induce galls [41] and are an
adaptation to conserve water and to low nutrient environments [18,42-44]. Acacia population subdivision is partly
determined by soil type mosaics [45-48] and this patchwork of nutrient poor sand dunes, sand plains and rocky
ranges provided the sclerophylly habitat and opportunity
for speciation [16,24,32]. Patchy distributions of Acacia
are expected to contribute to heightened extinction and
speciation rates [49]. This type of environmental heterogeneity can potentially also provide a foundation for
increased specialisation and resource partitioning [50].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/3

Acacia gall-thrips are a monophyletic group, distinct from
other gall-inducing groups in Australia, implying that gall
induction had a single origin in this case [51]. Acacia gallthrips have likely undergone diversification as a result of
cospeciation, highly restricted host-plant switching, or
both processes [52,53]. The beginning of extensive aridification in Australia dates from the Late Miocene approximately 10–15 million years ago. The origin of Acacia gallthrips likely arose in conjunction with the drying of Australia during this period [53]. In this study, we argue that
host-specific gall-inducing thrips have diversified in close
accordance with evolution of highly-related host Acacia in
the subgenus Phyllodineae (DC.) Seringe, comprising more
than 960 species largely confined to the Australian aridzone [40]. Using a phylogenetic approach, we demonstrate that net increases in gall-thrips diversification are
closely linked with host range expansion and aridification
in Australia, particularly during the Quaternary period.
Gall-thrips diversity partly depends on a highly specialised affiliation with host Acacia species, where all
described species are monophagous [53]. Galls are paramount in providing food, shelter, and a vessel for reproduction. The development and growth of galls has been
widely correlated with the feeding activity and nutritional
requirements of the galler [27]. Single females, or a
female-male pair, induce a gall on the phyllode of a specific host plant and become fully enclosed within a few
days after initiation. Extreme host specificity is evident in
the morphologies of galls induced on different host species, and are invariant in appearance given any particular
host species affiliation. Gall morphology amongst a species takes a generalised form of either an elongate or
pouched structure, with more discrete characteristics evident for galls induced on specific hosts [28]. Elongate and
pouched gall-types vary in appearance by the presence/
absence of either spiky protrusions or prominent longitudinal ridges. Gall induction by founders is only permitted
when new phyllode growth is available for inoculation.
This event is usually dictated by local, infrequent, and
unpredictable arid-zone rainfall patterns.
Sections Plurinerves and Juliflorae of the subgenus Phyllodineae, host to all but one gall-thrips species, do not appear
to represent monophyletic groups but remain closely
related to one another [54,55]. Species within these sections are believed to be relatively young compared to
other sections in the subgenus Phyllodineae and more susceptible to speciation during the Pleistocene climatic
cycling [54]. Semi-arid transitional climatic zones on the
periphery of the interior arid zone have been proposed as
having been particularly favourable for floral [21,31,32]
and faunal [23,56,57] speciation. The lack of sequence
divergence within the chloroplast genome of host Acacia
and their close relatives, as well as evidence of a rapid

BMC Biology 2007, 5:3

morphological radiation among Acacia in subgenus Phyllodineae, is symptomatic of a relatively young group [54].
Speciation in the Plurinerves is believed to have occurred
over a relatively short period as widespread aridity developed in the late Tertiary and early Quaternary periods
[16,17] and that tropical section Juliflorae is more ancient
than the Plurinerves section [58].
The addition of 29 undescribed taxa are added to all
described Acacia gall-thrips species [51] to infer diversification hypotheses. These new taxa have previously been
considered cryptic species (also referred to hereafter as
morphotypes) and more recently believed to be groups of
monophagous sister-species [52,53,59]. Recent work has
raised one of these morphotypes to species status [59].
The extension of the gall-thrips phylogeny with the addition of these taxa is now believed to include a great majority of known types, although formal species delimitation
is yet to be undertaken. We approached this study in two
steps. First, to infer biogeographical processes acting on
the genesis of diversity in gall-thrips/Acacia interactions,
we made the assumption that gall-thrips diversification
and host radiations were closely linked, and used specieslevel phylogenetic analyses and penalised likelihood
approaches to date gall-thrips lineage diversification. Second, to address hypotheses of rate increase in gall-thrips
diversification, expected as an outcome of Acacia radiations, we used likelihood ratio tests to identify latebranching molecular polytomies correlated with periods
of explosive radiation, and tree asymmetry methods to
identify rate changes.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis
The Bayesian phylogenetic inference shows a high level of
support for each of the clades containing the Kladothrips
rugosus (Froggatt) and Kladothrips waterhousei (Mound &
Crespi) comb. n. species complexes (Figure 1). The clade
comprising Kladothrips acaciae (Moulton), Kladothrips ellobus (Mound), Kladothrips maslini (Mound, Crespi, &
Kranz) and the K. rugosus complex, closely mirrors host
exploitation (see Discussion) by the clade comprising Kladothrips harpophyllae (Mound, Crespi, & Kranz), Kladothrips hamiltoni (Mound & Crespi), Kladothrips rodwayi
(Hardy) and the K. waterhousei complex. This is consistent
with previous phylogenies [51], where gall-thrips species
from each of these clades specialise on Acacia cambadgei
(Baker) and Acacia harpophylla (Muell, Benth) and the K.
rugosus and K waterhousei complexes share the same set of
host species (Figures 1, 2, 3).

The monophyly of the K. waterhousei complex is apparently violated by K. rodwayi, K. habrus, and K. intermedius; similarly, K. rugosus is not monophyletic due to the
presence of K. maslini and K. nicolsoni. The inclusion of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/3

these described species within the complexes is suspected
to result from phylogenetic uncertainty, an artifact of host
switching [52,53], and that the undescribed taxa in each
complex are species. Genetic divergence and substantial
variation in gall structure amongst each of the complex
members suggests that at least some of the group comprises species. Unpublished work (MJ McLeish & BJ
Crespi) indicates COI pairwise uncorrected "p" distances
between a majority of species complex taxa is similar to
those between described species. Although such distances
should be treated cautiously when inferring species-level
divergence, in one case at least the divergence has been
shown to be at the species level. For example, the recent
elevation of a K. rugosus host race inhabiting Acacia papyrocarpa (Benth) to species status, K. nicolsoni [59], is consistent with the complexes comprising putative species.
The genetic distances between taxa belonging to each of
the species complexes, host species-specific gall morphology, and cospeciation [52] between gall-thrips and Acacia
is consistent with monophagy operating for these morphotypes. Regardless of the presence of some phylogenetic uncertainty, the high support for each clade that
includes either the K. rugosus or K. waterhousei complexes provides the ability to assess the validity of a
hypothesized increase in the rate of diversification for
each of them, as the clades are expected to have co-radiated and therefore have radiated contemporaneously.
Chronology
Penalised likelihood analysis using our Bayesian inference revealed contemporaneous radiations of two gallthrips clades, one comprising the K. rugosus complex and
the other K. waterhousei, Kladothrips intermedius (Bagnall),
and Kladothrips habrus (Mound) complexes. We explored
outcomes of r8s tests by assigning different combinations
of fixed and constrained ages to the root and an internal
node corresponding to the most recent common ancestor
of the clade containing the K. rugosus group (Table 2), to
assess the ratio (or fit) between each of our calibration priors. When the root node was fixed at 25 million years ago
(mya), approximating the appearance of fossil Acacia pollen in Australia, the internal node corresponding to the
presumed period of rapid speciation of Plurinerves, was
dated at nearly 9 mya. This date approaches the period
when arid-adapted Acacia are believed to have originated
and therefore 25 mya was regarded as an upper limit for
the age of the root node.

Fixing the age of the root node at 15 mya, and then constraining the age between 10–15 mya in two separate tests
resulted in the age of the appearance of the common
ancestor of the K. rugosus and K. waterhousei complexes
being dated at between 3.3 and 5.3 mya (Table 2). Furthermore, we enforced a fixed divergence time of 5 mya at
this node in one analysis and constrained this point

between 2 mya and 5 mya in another test. The root node
date estimates were 9.3 mya and 13.7 mya respectively
(Table 2). Therefore, the ratio of the age of the root node
and the common ancestor of the K. rugosus and K. waterhousei complexes were consistent with one another
between the independent analyses.
To generate our chronogram (Figure 2), we used a gamma
shape distribution value of 0.5316 generated using Modeltest 3.0 [60]. The age at the root and at the common
ancestor of the K. rugosus complex was constrained
between 10 and 15 mya and 2 and 5 mya respectively. The
cross-validation analysis yielded a smoothing value of
3.981072. The chronogram indicated that the common
ancestors of the K. rugosus and K. waterhousei complexes
arose at approximately the same time between 3.38 and
6.05 mya. The age of the root of the phylogeny was dated
at between 10.00 and 10.43 mya. Host affiliation inferred
using a stochastic character mapping approach implemented in SIMMAP indicated a host switch to a Plurinerves
ancestor (the probability of a Plurinerves ancestor at this
node = 99.9%) at approximately 7.5 mya.
Diversification rate
We used likelihood ratio tests to detect branch lengths
that were not significantly different than zero to assess the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/3

possibility of hard molecular polytomies. The genetic data
were divided into six partitions to generate Bayesian inferences. As different partitions showed branch length variation, we mapped branch lengths not significantly different
from zero (at the α = 0.05 level) for 6/6 partitions, 5/6
partitions, 4/6 partitions, and no partitions onto our
Bayesian consensus phylogram (Figure 1). There was a
high density of internal and terminal branch lengths not
significantly different from zero for 6/6, 5/6, and 4/6 partitions within the K. rugosus and K. waterhousei complexes.
For the 5/6 partitions of branch lengths not significantly
different from zero, the non-zero length partition was
always derived from the mitochondrial DNA data (COI
and 16S), which might be expected given that these gene
regions have higher substitution rates than the other partitions. When the data were pooled together (i.e. no partitions), branch lengths not significantly different from zero
always coincided with all or a high proportion of branch
lengths not significantly different from zero indicated by
the partitioned analyses.
SYMMETREE performs seven slightly different alternatives
of diversification rate tests, each progressively more sensitive to different nodal depth scales [61]. When testing for
rate variation within a tree, significant tree asymmetry
(Figure 1) was detected through the most to least sensitive
test-statistics (single-tree 0.0001 < P < 0.0315; batch
processing 0.000 < P < 0.000). Whole-tree analysis for the
detection of tree asymmetry indicated that lineages within
the gall-thrips phylogeny diversified at significantly different rates. Diversification rate shifts inferred from the best
Bayesian consensus phylogeny are conditional on its
accuracy and also implicitly assume full representation
and/or random sampling of gall-thrips taxa. The phylogeny was lacking some gall-thrips taxa but increased the
representation of known taxa from approximately 35%
[51] to 90% and was assumed not to compromise the
analysis.
Given significant levels of tree asymmetry, branches along
which putative rate shifts occurred can be identified. The
significant rate shift identified in a branch in the singletree analysis coincides with the node of the most recent
ancestor of the Kladothrips antennatus (Moulton) lineage
(PΔ1 = 0.0363636 and PΔ2 = 0.0476392). Substantial but
not significant rate shifts were identified at the most
recent ancestral branch to the Kladothrips morrisi (Mound,
Crespi, & Kranz) lineage (PΔ1 = 0.0583 and PΔ2 = 0.075)
and most recent ancestral branch to the K. rodwayi lineage
(PΔ1 = 0.066 and PΔ2 = 0.066). Of the 100 replicates in our
batch processing analysis used to account for phylogenetic uncertainty, the significant diversification rate shift
at the ancestor of K. antennatus, was consistently identified
along the same branch although slight tree-topology
changes occur among the replicate sample.

The lineage by time diversification plot (Figure 4) shows
differential rates between gall-thrips that specialise on
Plurinerves and Juliflorae. Known taxa that inhabit Juliflorae
hosts not represented in the phylogeny (approximately
5% of known types) comprise a small proportion of the
total known types, and therefore the general trend in
diversification rates would not alter substantially. The plot
indicates lineages that specialise on Plurinerves host species diversify at a higher rate than those on Juliflorae hosts
and this is contemporaneous with a period of exaggerated
aridification during the Quaternary period over the last 4
million yeayrs (myr).

Discussion
On the assumption that gall-thrips and Acacia co-radiated,
chronological conclusions indicate the common ancestor
of gall-thrips arose during the commencement of longterm and widespread desertification in Australia towards
the end of the Miocene epoch. The colonisation of a novel
ancestral host, related to the extant Plurinerves, occurred
before the inferred onset of climatic cycling and more
rapid desert expansion over the Quaternary period. This
host switch appears to have afforded greater opportunity
for gall-thrips diversification on Plurinerves compared to
species specialising on an alternative host section.
Sequence divergences amongst gall-thrips specialising on
Plurinerves suggest this group has been subject to a rapid
and relatively recent diversification episode and this is

consistent with processes of climatic cycling during the
Quaternary period.
Phylogenetics
Bayesian inference indicated two well-supported, wellresolved monophyletic clades: one comprising K. ellobus,K. acaciae, and the K. rugosus complex, and the other
comprising K. hamiltoni, K. harpophyllae, and the K. waterhousei, K. habrus and K. intermedius complexes (Figure 1).
These taxa are all affiliated with Plurinerves hosts; however, each of the clades includes either K. maslini or K. rodwayi, lineages that have likely undergone a host-switching
event [52,53] (Figure 2). Other data [52] and phylogenetic patterns [53] indicates these gall thrips clades have
diversified in parallel via some combination of cospeciation, highly restricted host-plant switching, or both processes. The less than strict form of cospeciation between
these gall-thrips clades and the host species they share
implies that underlying processes impacting diversification might act in tandem for both clades on highly-related
Plurinerves. This is in contrast to lineages inhabiting more
distantly-related host species.

Indications of processes driving gall-thrips diversification
acting on the K. rugosus and K. waterhousei complexes
might be expressed differently in K. rodwayi and K. maslini
as a consequence of host switching. These two species
inhabit phylogenetically distant host taxa [48,62], are
mesic-zone distributed [51,63], and share secondarily
acquired plesiotypic life history strategies. The inferred
host switches of the K. rodwayi and K. maslini lineages
might represent a shift to enemy free space [1,38]. Phylogenetic inference suggests Koptothrips species specialise on
gall-thrips species [38] and that as a consequence might
also diversify in parallel with the host thrips after the host
switch [64,65] and this is consistent with the presence of
Koptothrips parasitising K. rodwayi galls. Very little life history information has been collected for K. maslini in contrast to that for K. rodwayi discussed below.
The inferred host switch of an ancestor of K. rodwayi
apparently resulted in a loss of soldiers (sociality), the
retention of small gall size, small brood sizes similar to
social species, and adult eclosion in the gall before dispersal [63]. The striking life history shift and presumed subsequent bottleneck effects resulting from the host switch
would be expected to influence the level of sequence
divergence observed in the K. rodwayi branch. The phylogram (Figure 1) shows a terminal branch for the K. rodwayi
lineage similar to those of many other branches leading to
described gall-thrips species. The relative level of differentiation, assuming the sampled genetic change reflects
observed phenotypic change (Figure 1) might help
explain why K. rodwayi has retained some features of
closely related social species in this clade, including small

BMC Biology 2007, 5:3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/3

brood numbers and small gall sizes (the social species
include those from K. harpophyllae down to K. intermedius
except for K. rodwayi and K. xiphius in Figure 1).

ation in the sclerophyllous taxa was partly due to population fragmentation and lability induced by these
upheavals [19,25,26].

Life history shifts appear to be more acute subsequent to
a host-switching event [52]. Dramatic life history shifts
appear to have coincided with gall-thrips association with
Plurinerves hosts. For example, gall-thrips on Plurinerves
have evolved behaviourally and morphologically specialised defensive castes, cofounding between male and
female, and adult eclosion outside of the natal gall [38].
The proliferation of gall-thrips lineages on Plurinerves
hosts, under the assumption that the extinction rate for
each group is more or less equivocal, contrasts with those
on Juliflorae hosts and suggests that each group was subject to variation in processes affecting diversification that
might be linked to host evolution. Host-related races
present in the species complexes inhabiting Plurinerves do
not occur for the K. maslini and K. rodwayi lineages on
more distantly-related hosts distributed in non-arid climates. Host-plant diversity has been found to play a key
role underlying the rates at which host-switching, and
therefore insect diversification, can take place [66,67].
However, the opportunity for increased diversification
after the successful colonisation of a novel niche need not
necessarily follow, and perhaps the processes driving
diversification might differ between host groups. Taken
together, these patterns suggest that diversification in gallthrips is closely linked to host evolution in addition to
host affiliation.

Diversification rate changes
Our evidence supports Hopper and Gioia's [32] prediction that phylogenetic pattern showing unresolved relationships towards the terminal branches of a tree attests to
rapid increase in diversification/speciation. The high incidence of molecular polytomies and short branch lengths
towards the terminal ends of the phylogeny generally
occur for gall-thrips lineages that specialise on Plurinerves
and not Juliflorae. The presence of hard molecular polytomies indicated that low support within the K. rugosus and
K. waterhousei complexes (Figure 1) might be the outcome
of rapid diversification in these lineages [68,69].

Chronology
We estimated absolute timing of lineage diversification
and mapped host affiliation onto our Bayesian consensus
tree (Figure 1). In the absence of direct evidence of gallthrips divergence times, co-radiation between thrips and
Acacia has been treated as an assumption and the ratio of
timing between the origin and radiation of gall-thrips specialising on Plurinerves hosts tested. Independent analysis
of each calibration point supported the timing of the alternative calibration date and a chronogram was generated
using both constraints. Penalised likelihood estimates
and ancestral host affiliation inferences show a host
switch to a Plurinerves ancestor approximately 7.5 mya,
before more extreme arid-zone expansion during the Quaternary period. The common ancestors of the K. rugosus
and K. waterhousei complexes both occurred at approximately the same time approximately 3.6 mya. The coincidental diversification of the two complexes, each
specialising on the same set of Plurinerves host species
(Figure 3), suggest that a component of diversification
opportunities for gall-thrips was a consequence of host
range expansion and host speciation. Floral communities
on desert margins in Australia would have been sensitive
to glacial extremes and climatic cycling [21-24] and speci-

Furthermore, diversification rate variation analyses identified significant tree asymmetry at a branch believed to represent the transition from gall-thrips lineages that display
a plesiotypic life history (Figure 2). The four species, Kladothrips zygus (Mound, Crespi, & Kranz), Kladothrips pilbara (Mound, Crespi, & Kranz), Kladothrips schwarzi
(Mound, Crespi, & Kranz), and K. antennatus are considered to be similar in biology to ancestral gall-inducing
thrips. These species display the most primitive morphology and gall structure, inhabit Juliflorae hosts, and are distributed in the most arid regions of northwestern and
central Australia [38]. Juliflorae such as Acacia aneura (F.
Muell ex. Benth), supports K. antennatus and three other
centrally distributed species, Kladothrips arotrum (Mound),
Kladothrips sterni (Mound, Crespi, & Kranz), and Kladothrips tepperi (Uzel).
The underlying causes of the diversification rate change
before the origins of the K. rugosus and K. waterhousei complexes are difficult to test. The inferred rate change
occurred early in the evolution of gall-thrips Acacia (Figure 1), and therefore might represent a footprint of central
arid-zone expansion before the proposed Plurinerves host
range expansion on the arid-zone periphery (Figure 3)
resulting from climatic cycling. The central Australian
desert is known to have originated as severe aridity developed during the Pliocene from approximately 7 mya
[15,16,18,70]. Truly arid-zone host populations might be
less evolutionarily labile than populations in semi-arid
regions. Phenotypic diversity and species richness appear
to have been amplified on the Plurinerves lineage compared to lineages supported by centrally distributed Juliflorae (Figure 4) over the last 4 myr assuming our
chronogram is a reasonable approximation. It is possible
that fragmentation featured more prominently in the
Plurinerves during the most recent and extensive speciation event. The Juliflorae might have been able to maintain

gene flow sufficient to arrest fragmentation effects apparently experienced by the Plurinerves.

Conclusion
This work has addressed hypotheses connecting gallthrips phylogeny with host-plant evolution and suggests
that host expansion and climate change have important
consequences for gall-thrips diversification. A pronounced diversification episode for gall-thrips lineages
affiliated with Plurinerves hosts appears to have commenced between 3 and 6 mya. The inferred host-plant
switch to a Plurinerves ancestor relatively early in the evolution of gall-thrips, preceded the onset of pronounced
diversification for this lineage. In addition to the cospeciation and host switching evident for this group, Acacia
cladogenesis would provide an expanding resource and
unoccupied ecological niches to exploit. These patterns
agree with the climatic cycling during the Quaternary
period contriving an opportunity for some phytophagous
insects, associated with a particular flora, to diversify at
heightened rates with respect to others. This work suggests
a component of the plant-feeding insect diversity in Australia has been passively driven by host evolution.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analyses included a great majority of
known morphotypes and all described species [51]. No
isolates were available for the types not included in the
analyses. A comprehensive explanation of DNA extraction, PCR, and alignment protocols, and choices for substitution models is given in McLeish et al. [59]. Up to
1,245 bp of the cytochrome oxidase one (COI) mitochondrial gene, 444 bp of the elongation factor one alpha (EF-1α)
gene, 472 bp of the 16S (ribosomal RNA subunit) gene,
and 549 bp of the wingless gene were amplified. Sequence
data for the K. waterhousei complex at EF-1α and wingless
gene regions was not available and absent for all analyses.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX 1.81.1sa software
([71]; ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX/ accessed
24 June 2005). Insertions and deletions were removed
from the sequence alignment before analyses. All nucleic
acid sequence data has been lodged with GenBank under
the
accession
numbers
AY827474–AY827481,
AY921058–AY921069,
and
AY920988–AY921000,
DQ246453–DQ246516. Bayesian inferences were implemented in PAUP*b4.10 [72] and MrBayes (MrBayes
3.0b4, [73]).

To accommodate differences in substitution rate parameters and heterogeneity of base composition in our multiple gene fragment dataset, we fitted separate models to
different gene partitions in the Bayesian analysis [74,75].
The sequence data used in the MrBayes analysis was
divided into six partitions comprising 1st, 2nd, and 3rd

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/3

codon positions of the COI mitochondrial data, with single partitions for each of EF-1α, wingless, and the 16S gene
fragments. We used a general time reversible (GTR) DNA
substitution model with gamma distributed rates with a
proportion of invariant sites. Posterior probabilities and
mean branch lengths are derived from 3,000 trees taken
from generations 3.5–5.0 million, sampling every 500th
generation. The sampled trees were derived from postburnin generations after the chains had reached apparent
stationarity. We ran the Bayesian analysis three times to
verify the repeatability of the phylogenetic outcome using
the same priors as above and obtained consistent and stable posterior values. There was a 0.16% difference in the
arithmetic mean of posterior probabilities between the
three MrBayes runs.
The outgroup, Rhopalothripoides Bagnall, is the most
closely related sister-genus to Kladothrips Froggatt [30].
The K. rugosus and K. waterhousei species complexes were
chosen as ingroup taxa, as data strongly implies that these
taxa have diversified recently and in parallel [52,53] and
constitute the majority of known gall-thrips morphotypes
remaining to be sampled. The approximation for the origin of each of these complexes is therefore expected to be
contemporaneous.
Construction of chronograms
The molecular clock hypothesis [76] of equal rates across
lineages can be examined using a likelihood-ratio test. The
GTR + I + G model for all gene regions in a DNA sequence
data set was assumed in the analysis. The null hypothesis
is that the likelihood is maximized under the constraint of
equal rates across lineages (L0), that is, an enforced molecular clock model. The alternative hypothesis relaxes the
clock constraint by assigning a different rate to each of the
lineages; the likelihood under the alternative hypothesis is
L1. The likelihood-ratio test statistic (twice the difference
in the loge likelihood, -2 loge Λ; Λ = L0/L1) between the
null and alternative models is approximately χ2 distributed with s – 2 degrees of freedom. The molecular clock
hypothesis was rejected at the α = 0.05 level (logeL0 = 16,925.01, logeL1 = -16,811.27, -2 loge Λ = 227.48, P <
0.0001).

To better accommodate unequal substitution rates among
lineages, a semi-parametric penalised likelihood (PL) rate
smoothing with a truncated Newton algorithm was
implemented to estimate relative ages of nodes using r8s
[77]. Penalised likelihood imposes constraints on rate variation combining a model allowing substitution rate variation among branches with a roughness penalty that
mediates rate changes from branch to branch. A "smoothing parameter" that determines the relative contribution
of each was determined by a cross-validation procedure.
To generate a PL chronogram, we used MrBayes to gener-

ate a consensus phylogeny using the same priors as
described above. Modeltest 3.0 [60] was used to determine the appropriate nucleotide substitution model (GTR
+ I + G) and gamma shape required for r8s analysis. The
outgroup Rhopalthripoides was pruned prior to analyses
using r8s. The 95% central distribution intervals for nodeage estimates were generated by filtering post-burnin
trees, retaining only those that had an identical topology
to the consensus tree produced by our Bayesian analysis.
This resulted in 258 sampled trees from the MCMC run.
We used r8s to generate chronograms for each of these filtered trees. The resulting branch length estimates were
used to calculate the ages of key nodes for each tree and
the 2.5% right and left tails were then removed, leading to
95% central distribution limits that could be used as a
measure of confidence for the point estimates [78].

[24,40]. Therefore, the appearance of gall-thrips hosts presumably coincided with the appearance of an ancestor of
these arid-adapted Acacia during the Miocene; therefore
we constrained the root node between 10–15 mya. A
rapid increase in fossil Acacia pollen co-occurs with a
period of pronounced arid-zone expansion in Australia
over the last 3 myr [30,79]. Evidence indicates speciation
in host Acacia section Plurinerves occurred over a relatively
short period as widespread aridity developed in the early
Quaternary over the last 2–5 myr [15,16,53,80,81]. The
common ancestor of the K. rugosus species complex specialising on extant Plurinerves species was therefore constrained to between 2–5 mya. The K. waterhousei species
complex specialises on the same group of host species as
K. rugosus and was therefore expected to have radiated
contemporaneously.

Clock calibration
In the absence of even a modest amount of evidence bearing directly on gall-thrips divergence times, fossil Acacia
pollen and biogeographical evidence was used to calibrate
the phylogeny. Therefore, chronological conclusions are
only valid under the assumption that gall-thrips radiations must have coincided with host radiations. This is a
reasonable proposal given that gall-thrips specialising on
Plurinerves display a less-than-strict form of cospeciation
between insect and host [52,53] and are therefore tightly
affiliated with this resource. In addition, we aimed to
show that the 'ratio' of the ages of two calibration points
in the gall-thrips phylogeny is similar regardless of the
absolute timing of these events.

To provide a convenient visualisation of historical host
utilisation by gall-thrips, as gall-thrips are highly host specific [38], and to indicate the relative age of the transition
from Juliflorae to the novel ancestor of host section Plurinerves, ancestral states were also inferred using a stochastic
character mapping approach (SIMMAP: [82]). SIMMAP is
a post-tree analysis program for making inferences about
character evolution and implements a Bayesian method
for mapping characters using stochastic substitution models [83]. To avoid potentially spurious inferences based on
a single topology, character histories were sampled from
the posterior distribution of 1,000 trees obtained from
our MrBayes analyses. We used a data matrix of host utilization to calculate the probability of a host switch to a
Plurinerves ancestor. Gall-thrips host species assignments
for the data matrix were taken from Crespi et al. [53].
Plurinerves, Juliflorae, or Phyllodinae host affiliation was
coded from 0 to 2 respectively.

Divergence events were calibrated using combinations of
fixed and/or constrained maximum and minimum times
at the root node and an internal node based on fossil Acacia pollen records and biogeographical evidence. Each of
the calibration points used was individually assessed in
separate analyses to compare the appropriateness of the
other calibration point, and thereby determining the ratio
(or fit) of calibration points. That is, the root node or an
internal node was calibrated independently as a fixed age
or constrained between two ages. For these tests, the root
node was fixed at 25 mya and 15 mya and the internal
node at 5 mya. Additionally, the root was constrained
between 10–15 myr or the internal node between 2–5
myr. Constrained calibration points were presumed to be
a more realistic prior because the biogeographic and fossil
evidence are given in approximate terms.
Calibration points were nominated in accordance with
the following evidence. The appearance of fossil Acacia
pollen the fossil record in Australia 25 mya [79] and the
distribution of the Acacia subgenera Phyllodineae hosts to
which gall thrips are confined, indicate that radiations of
this group occurred in Australia no more than 15 mya

Diversification rate
To investigate diversification rate changes we used a
whole-tree asymmetry approach implemented in SYMMETREE [61]. The approach is appropriate for use with
trees including taxa below species-level and it is robust to
polytomies. Divergences were expected to be marginal as
mtDNA COI uncorrected "p" distances were below that
between other gall-thrips species in some instances
[38,52]. Detection of among-lineage diversification rate
variation compares observed differences in sister-group
diversity to a null distribution of sister-group diversity.
Diversification rate variation within the phylogeny is
reported by a range of test statistics that vary in their sensitivity to nodal depth scales [61].

Diversification rate change along a branch can also be
inferred. Two different diversification rate change P-statistics are calculated. Each calculation considers the detection of a shift along an internal branch of a three-taxon

tree in different ways [84]. The first, PΔ1, accounts for the
differences between rate models and the second, PΔ2, for
the possibility that the ingroup diversity might not be subject to a rate shift. The 'batch processing' option in SYMMETREE was applied using posterior probability
distribution of 1,000 Bayesian trees thinned from 10,000.
We used a random-resolution algorithm taxon-size sensitive (TTS) ERM branching model. The number of random
resolutions was set to 100,000 whole trees. To test the reliability of the single-tree analysis and the potential phylogenetic uncertainty associated with it, we batch processed
a random sub-sample of 100 trees generated from posterior probability replicates of the Bayesian analysis.
To test the hypothesis of diversification rate change further, we also used a method for detecting multifurcations,
or molecular polytomies, using likelihood ratio tests
[68,69], expecting a reasonable coincidence of branch
lengths not significantly different from zero with regions
of diversification rate change. Low-level node support of
internal branches in phylogenies can be a result of insufficient data or an artifact of short periods of rapid speciation, during which little or no informative signal is
trapped. We suspected a series of poorly supported
branches corresponded to rapid diversification as inclusion of additional markers did not improve node support
at these nodes in several instances. We used Modeltest
[60] to estimate the substitution rate characteristics of
each partition used in our phylogenetic analysis and used
likelihood ratio tests implemented in PAUP* to detect
branch lengths not significantly different from zero for
separate and all partitions combined.
A lineage by time diversification plot was used to show
differential rates of gall-thrips lineage diversification that
specialise on either Plurinerves or Juliflorae. Lineage frequencies per time were counted using the Penalised Likelihood chronogram generated by Sanderson's r8s
program [77]. The plot includes taxa most likely below
that of species status where a large majority of known yet
undescribed gall morphotypes [59] have been included.
We assume equivocal extinction rates between the two
groups and presume that several known morphotypes

specialise on Juliflorae host species, that were not sampled,
are only marginally underrepresented (see above).
