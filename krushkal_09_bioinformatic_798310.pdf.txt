Background
Geobacteraceae are a family of microorganisms from the
delta subdivision of Proteobacteria. They have potential for
environmental bioremediation and electricity generation.
In this presentation, we describe our recent bioinformatic
analyses of gene regulation in Geobacter sulfurreducens, a
model representative of this family.

Results and conclusion
We have developed an online database, GSEL (Geobacter
Sequence Elements), which compiles regulatory information for G. sulfurreducens. We have recently completed the
development of a new, significantly expanded and
updated, relational version 2 of the GSEL database and its
accompanying online query system, which compiles manually curated information on operon organization and
transcription regulatory elements in the genome of G. sulfurreducens. GSEL v. 2 incorporates a graphical browser
and provides significantly expanded search capabilities. It
also includes new information on predicted and/or experimentally validated genome regulatory sites and provides
links to information from microarray experiments stored
in public gene expression databases, and to original publications describing how particular regulatory interactions
were identified.

Using sequence and gene expression analyses, we investigated target genes and promoters regulated by RpoN, an
alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor, which regulates
a variety of important cellular processes in G. sulfurreducens. Our current studies are focusing on an investigation
of several transcription regulatory systems involved in
RpoN-dependent regulatory pathways. We have investigated target regulatory sites for an enhancer binding protein, PilR, which participates in RpoN-dependent
transcriptional regulation of the pilA gene encoding structural pilin. We predicted multiple PilR-regulated sites
upstream of operons related to biosynthesis, assembly,
and function of pili and flagella, type II secretory pathways, and cell wall biogenesis.
We also investigated sequence changes and molecular
classification of the TetR family of transcriptional regulators. In G. sulfurreducens, we identified RpoN-regulated
promoters upstream of several operons containing tetR
family genes. The genome of G. sulfurreducens contains
nine tetR family genes. Some of them are located
upstream of operons encoding functionally important ctype cytochromes. In order to better understand the roles
of TetR family members in the ability of Geobacteraceae to
participate in electron transfer, we investigated phylogenetic relationships among TetR proteins in Geobacteraceae

and in other microbial species. We identified their conserved and variable domains, which may be important for
the diversity of their functional roles, and classified them
into subgroups based on sequence similarities.
