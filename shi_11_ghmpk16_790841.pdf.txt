GhMPK16, a novel stress-responsive group D
MAPK gene from cotton, is involved in disease
resistance and drought sensitivity
Jing Shi, Liang Zhang, Hailong An, Changai Wu* and Xingqi Guo*

Abstract
Background: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play pivotal roles in mediating biotic and abiotic
stress responses. In plants, MAPKs are classified into four major groups (A-D) according to their sequence
homology and conserved phosphorylation motifs. Members of group A and B have been extensively characterized,
but little information on the group D MAPKs has been reported.
Results: In this study, we isolated and characterised GhMPK16, the first group D MAPK gene found in cotton.
Southern blot analysis suggests GhMPK16 is single copy in the cotton genome, and RNA blot analysis indicates that
GhMPK16 transcripts accumulate following pathogen infection and treatment with multiple defense-related signal
molecules. The analysis of the promoter region of GhMPK16 revealed a group of putative cis-acting elements
related to stress responses. Subcellular localization analysis suggests that GhMPK16 acts in the nucleus. Transgenic
Arabidopsis overexpressing GhMPK16 displayed significant resistance to fungi (Colletotrichum nicotianae and
Alternaria alternata) and bacteria (Pseudomonas solanacearum) pathogen, and the transcripts of pathogen-related
(PR) genes were more rapidly and strongly induced in the transgenic plants. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis
showed reduced drought tolerance and rapid H2O2 accumulation.
Conclusion: These results suggest that GhMPK16 might be involved in multiple signal transduction pathways,
including biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways.

Background
Stresses such as drought, high salinity and fungal infections constitute a major limitation to crop productivity.
Plants have developed sophisticated defense mechanisms
to deal with diverse unfavorable environmental factors.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades
are conserved pathways through which extracellular stimuli are transduced into intracellular responses in all
eukaryotes [1,2]. Plant MAPK cascades have been
shown to regulate a number of essential biological processes, including growth, development and stress
responses [3].
MAPK cascades are composed of three interlinked
protein kinases: MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs or

Biology, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong 271018, China

MAP3Ks), MAPK kinases (MAPKKs, MAP2Ks or
MEKs) and MAPKs. MAPKs are the terminal components in this cascade, and they are regulated by the dual
phosphorylation of the conserved T-X-Y motif located
in the activation loop by upstream kinases (MAPKKs).
There are 20 MAPK genes identified in Arabidopsis, and
a similar repertoire of genes have been found in other
plants, such as rice (Oryza sativa), poplar (Populus sp.)
and grapevine (Vitis vinifera) [3-5]. The MAPKs can be
categorised into four major groups (A, B, C, and D)
based on the phylogenetic analyzes of amino acid
sequences and phosphorylation motifs (TEY and TDY).
The TEY subtype can be classified into three groups (A,
B and C), whereas the TDY subtype is found in the
more distant group D [4,5].
In Arabidopsis, three particular MAPKs in groups A
and B (MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6) have been extensively

studied. Both biochemical and genetic analyzes have
been performed for each of these isoforms, which
appear to work in multiple signaling pathways and play
crucial roles in many distinct processes ranging from
stress responses to developmental processes [3]. Information about group C MAPKs has recently emerged.
Three members of group C, MPK1 and MPK2 in Arabidopsis and PsMPK2 in pea (Pisum sativum L.), are transcriptionally induced by a variety of stresses [6,7]. More
recently, Arabidopsis group C MAPKs, including MPK1,
MPK2, MPK7 and MPK14, were reported to be activated by MKK3, and MKK3-MPK7 participates in
pathogen signaling [8]. Cotton GhMPK7 may play a role
in pathogen resistance, plant growth and development
[9].
Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, it has been proposed that the rice genome contains more MAPKs with
a TDY phosphorylation motif (11 members) than with a
TEY motif (6 members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis
genome contains more MAPKs with a TEY motif (12
members) than with a TDY motif (8 members) [10].
Detailed functional data about TDY MAPKs was first
obtained from a monocot plant. Overexpression of
OsBWMK1 (also known as OsMPK12) in tobacco
resulted in constitutive PR gene expression and
enhanced resistance to fungal and bacterial infections
[11]. In maize, ZmMPK6 is able to interact with a 14-33 protein, and these data represent the first evidence of
the possible involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of MAPK cascades in plants [12]. More recently,
Arabidopsis MPK9 (a group D MAPK) and MPK12 (a
group B MAPK) were found to be preferentially
expressed in guard cells, share functional redundancy
and function as positive regulators downstream of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cell abscisic acid
(ABA) signaling [13]. Moreover, Arabidopsis MPK18
helps to mediate cortical microtubule functions in plant
cells [14].
Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is one of the most
important fibre and oil crops, and its growth and yield
are severely impaired in various biotic/abiotic stress
conditions. The biological significance of cotton group
D MAPKs has not yet been described. In this study, a
cDNA clone, GhMPK16, encoding a putative group D
MAPK gene was isolated and characterised. Our results
indicate that the expression of GhMPK16 is induced by
chemical and biological signals. Ectopic expression of
GhMPK16 in Arabidopsis results in enhanced disease
resistance against fungi and bacteria pathogen. Moreover, GhMPK16 transgenic plants were obviously more
drought-sensitive than control plants. We deduced that
GhMPK16 may play important roles in regulating pathogen resistance and drought signaling.

Results
Cloning and characterisation of the full-length GhMPK16
cDNA

Based on the conserved region of plant group D MAPK
genes, the degenerate primers MP1 and MP2 were
designed and synthesized to clone the internal conserved region of MAPKs from cotton, and a putative
MAPK fragment (476 bp) was cloned. Next, rapid
amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (RACE-PCR) was performed, and the full length sequence was retrieved. A
3’-end fragment of about 1500 bp and a 5’-end fragment
of about 360 bp were obtained with the specific primers.
The full-length cDNA sequence was PCR amplified
using the gene-specific primers (FL1 and FL2), and it
showed a high degree of homology to group D MAPKs
especially Arabidopsis AtMPK16. According to the
nomenclature for plant MAPKs, the novel cotton MAPK
gene was named GhMPK16 [4,5], and is the first group
D MAPK identified in cotton. The full-length cDNA
sequence of GhMPK16 (GenBank accession number:
FJ966889) was 2030 bp with a 78 bp 5’ untranslated
region (UTR) and a 287 bp 3’ UTR. The cDNA contains
a 1665 bp open reading frame (ORF) that is predicted
to encode a protein of 554 amino acids with a predicted
molecular mass of 63.18 kDa and an isoelectric point
(pI) of 8.61.
A BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
BLAST) and multi-alignment analysis revealed that
GhMPK16 is highly related to other group D MAPKs,
sharing a homology of 81.48% to AtMPK16, 72.18% to
TaMAPK2, 74.56% to OsMPK16-1 and 76.02% to
ZmMPK6 (Figure 1A). Moreover, as with other known
plant group D MAPKs, GhMPK16 has the same family
signature of 11 conserved subdomains, an activation
loop (T-loop), a phosphorylation motif (TDY motif) in
the T-loop, and an extended C-terminal region relative
to groups A, B and C. Additionally, GhMPK16 also
lacks a C-terminal CD domain, a feature conserved in
MAPKs belonging to the other groups (A, B, C) [4].
To reveal the evolutionary relationship of GhMPK16
with other MAPKs from various plant species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using amino acid sequences
derived from the GenBank database (Figure 1B). Our
results indicate that GhMPK16 has high similarity with
AtMPK16 and a close genetic relationship with many
monocot (rice, corn, and wheat) group D MAPKs, such as
OsMPK16-1, OsMPK15, ZmMPK6 and TaMAPK2, which
suggests that these genes may have a similar function
across species including dicotyledons and monocotyledons.
Genomic structure and Southern blot analysis of
GhMPK16

To isolate a genomic GhMPK16 clone, two pairs of
specific primers, FL1/Z1 and FL2/Z2, were designed

based on the GhMPK16 cDNA sequence, and the cotton genomic DNA was used as the template to generate two PCR fragments. These two fragments were
further linked together through their overlapping
region and the full-length GhMPK16 genomic
sequence of 5520 bp (GenBank accession number:
FJ966896) was deduced. A comparison between the
GhMPK16 genomic and cDNA sequences indicated
that ten introns were present in the gene (Additional
file 1: supplementary Figure S1). Interestingly, exon 8
was only 5 bp, intron 7 did not contain a 3’-splice
acceptor AG signal, and intron 8 did not contain the
conserved 5’-splice donor GT signal. A comparative
analysis of the homologous genes from Arabidopsis
thaliana, Oryza sativa and Vitis vinifera was performed (Additional file 1: supplementary Figure S1).

This analysis indicated that the size of the exons was
conserved, but the length of the introns for each member was different. To date, the most noticeable difference in GhMPK16 was the number of exons.
GhMPK16 has 11 exons, and the others have 10.
Southern blots were used to investigate the genomic
organization of the GhMPK16 gene. Genomic DNA was
completely digested with EcoR V, Xba I, Hind III and
EcoR I and hybridised to the 3’ partial sequence of
GhMPK16, which contains no restriction sites of EcoR
V, Hind III and EcoR I and only one Xba I site presents
in the probe region. As shown in Figure 2, only one
band was observed for the EcoR V, Hind III and EcoR I
digestions, and two bands were observed for the Xba I
digestion. These results imply that there is a single
GhMPK16 gene in the cotton genome.

by GFP fluorescence, using DAPI staining to detect the
nuclei and interference contrast images to detect wholecell structures. As shown in Figure 3B, the 35SGhMPK16::GFP construct localized to the nucleus, and
the 35S-GFP control construct showed GFP signals in
both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In addition, a program that predicts the subcellular localization of proteins (http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/SubLoc/)
predicted that GhMPK16 is localized in the nucleus
with an expected accuracy of nearly 74%. These results
indicate that the GhMPK16 protein is likely localized in
the nucleus.

biotic stresses in cotton

genome. Genomic DNA (30 mg/sample) was digested with EcoR V,
Xba I, Hind III and EcoR I respectively, followed by hybridization with
the partial a-32P -labeled genomic GhMPK16 fragment. Molecular
weight marker is shown on the right.

Subcellular localization of GhMPK16

To reveal the cellular localization of GhMPK16, a reporter gene encoding GFP was fused to GhMPK16 and
placed under the control of the CaMV35S promoter,
and immunoblot analysis indicated that GhMPK16::GFP
was an integrated fusion protein (Additional file 2: supplementary Figure S2). The biolistic transformation system was used for a transient assay in onion epidermal
cells. The nuclear localization of GFP-conjugated
GhMPK16 was confirmed in individual transgenic cells

To determine whether GhMPK16 expression is triggered
by abiotic stresses, cotton seedlings were exposed to low
and high temperatures, mannitol, NaCl and wounding
treatments. GhMPK16 showed a slightly response to low
and high temperatures (Figure 4A, B, C). GhMPK16 transcripts accumulated within 6 h following mannitol treatment, and the induction was still present 12 h after
treatment (Figure 4D). As shown in Figure 4E, GhMPK16
expression increased and reached the maximum at 8 h
after the NaCl treatment. Wounding rapidly and transiently enhanced the expression level of GhMPK16 (Figure
4F). Taken together, the expression profiles indicate that
GhMPK16 is induced by various abiotic stresses.
To explore the roles of GhMPK16 in plant biotic stresses, cotton seedlings were inoculated with pathogens,
including Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum
(X. campestris pv. malvacearum), Colletotrichum gossypii
(C. gossypii) and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum
(F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum). As shown in Figure 4
(G, H, I), infection by all of these pathogens elevated the
transcription level of GhMPK16, although the induction
kinetic was variable. There was no significant change in
GhMPK16 transcript level without pathogen treatment
during 7 days (Figure 4J). These results indicate that
GhMPK16 may be intimately involved in the plant pathogen defense response.
Additionally, we examined the response of GhMPK16
to exogenously applied salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and ABA, which are plant signaling molecules involved in plant defense signaling pathways. The
expression of GhMPK16 was induced by all of these signal molecules (Figure 4K, L, M). Furthermore, the solvent control (Ethanol) did not significantly induce the
expression of GhMPK16 (Figure 4N)

sequence. In order to find cis-acting elements, the PlantCARE databases were analyzed. Sequence analysis
revealed that the GhMPK16 promoter contains TATA
and CAAT motifs located at nucleotides -38 and -64
relative to the transcriptional start site, respectively,
which is characteristic of eukaryotic gene promoters. As
shown in Figure 5, the 785 bp promoter region contains
several motifs probably related to pathogen and drought
signals, such as a Box-W1 element (fungal elicitor
responsive element), an ERE element (ethylene-responsive element), two TCA-element (cis-acting SA-responsive element) and a MBS element (MYB binding site
involved in drought-inducibility). This suggests that
these putative cis-acting elements are responsible for
enhanced expression of GhMPK16 during stress
conditions.
Enhanced resistance of GhMPK16 transgenic plants to
pathogenic infections

In order to further explore the function of GhMPK16 in
plant defense, the coding sequence of GhMPK16 was

cloned into the plant binary vector pBI121 and transformed into Arabidopsis. A total of 32 independent
transgenic lines were obtained by kanamycin-resistance
selection and confirmed by PCR (data not shown). RNA
blot analysis was performed to determine the transgenic
expression levels in 7 randomly selected lines (Figure
6A). Two representative lines (#2 and #5) exhibiting different expression levels were selected and their T3 transgenic plants used to evaluate disease resistance.
To analyze bacterial resistance responses in wild-type
and GhMPK16-overexpressing plants, 3-week-old plants
were inoculated with P. solanacearum and monitored
daily for the appearance of typical disease symptoms. P.
solanacearum caused more severe chlorotic symptoms
in the wild-type plants compared to the transgenic
plants 6 d after inoculation (Figure 6B). As shown in
Figure 6C, the bacterial titres in the inoculated leaves of
the transgenic plants were significantly reduced as compared to those in wild-type plants at 3- and 6-day postinoculation, which is consistent with the observed symptoms. The rate of bacterial growth in the inoculated

leaves was lower for transgenic line #2 than for transgenic line #5. These results indicate that GhMPK16 can
enhance resistance to P. solanacearum in a dose-dependent manner in transgenic plants. In order to better
understand the role of GhMPK16 in disease resistance
in transgenic plants, three marker genes associated with
pathogen responses (AtPR1, AtPR4, and AtPDF1.2) were
selected, and the transcript levels of those genes were
analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The
expression of the three marker genes, especially AtPR4
and AtPDF1.2, was more rapidly and strongly induced
by the P. solanacearum infection in transgenic plants
than in wild-type plants (Figure 6D). These results
demonstrate that the overexpression of GhMPK16 activates defense-related gene expression when plants are
challenged with P. solanacearum.
As shown in Figure 7, GhMPK16-overexpressing
plants were evaluated for their resistance to fungal
pathogens (C. nicotianae and A. alternate). Detached
leaves were inoculation with C. nicotianae and A. alternate, and after 5 days, the lesions in the wild-type leaves
were larger than those in the transgenic leaves, and line
#2, which displayed the highest level of GhMPK16
expression, exhibited the least severe disease symptoms.
To quantify the lesions, the diameters of the disease
spots were measured, and the data were consistent with

the visual observations. These results indicate that
GhMPK16 can enhance resistance to infections by
pathogenic fungi in transgenic plants. After inoculating
whole plants with C. nicotianae and A. alternate, the
expression of AtPR1, AtPR4 and AtPDF1.2 was observed
at 3- and 6-day post-infection in both the wild-type and
transgenic plants, and the expression patterns of the
three marker genes were similar to those observed with
the P. solanacearum challenge (data not shown).
Reduced drought tolerance and rapid H2O2 accumulation
in GhMPK16-overexpressing plants

Compared with wild-type plants, the GhMPK16-overexpressing plants exhibited obvious drought sensitivity. As
shown in Figure 8A, the leaves began to turn yellow and
curl in both the 3-week-old wild-type and transgenic
plants after a 15-day drought treatment. Additionally,
drought treatment led to more serious damage in the
transgenic plants than in the wild-type plants. Under normal conditions, no overt morphological differences were
observed between wild-type and transgenic plants (data
not shown). We tested the seed germination capacity on
1/2 MS agar medium with 50 mM mannitol to mimic
drought conditions and found that the germination percentage was higher for wild-type plants than for transgenic
plants (Figure 8B, C). The root lengths of both wild-type

and transgenic plants were used as indicators of drought
stress tolerance. Root growth was inhibited by mannitol
treatment to a greater extent in transgenic seedlings than
in wild-type seedlings (Figure 8D, E). These results suggest
that the overexpression of GhMPK16 in Arabidopsis
results in reduced drought tolerance.
One of the important responses of plants under osmotic stress is the accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Among the different ROS, only H2O2 can cross
plant membranes and thus directly function in cell-tocell signaling. Therefore, we examined endogenous
H2O2 accumulation in wild-type and transgenic plants
in response to mannitol treatment. Mannitol (200 mM)
was used to treat one-week-old seedlings, and the leaves
were collected after 0, 1, 3 and 6 h. Staining with 3,3’diaminobenzidine (DAB) revealed different levels of
H2O2 production in the leaves of wild-type and transgenic plants after osmotic stress treatment. Specifically,
H2O2 accumulated in transgenic plants at a significantly
faster speed than that in wild-type plants (Figure 9).
These results suggest that the overexpression of
GhMPK16 leads to the rapid production of ROS or ineffective scavenge of excess ROS after osmotic stress.

Discussion and Conclusion
In this study, we isolated and characterised GhMPK16, a
gene whose product belongs to the family of group D
MAPKs. GhMPK16 is the first characterized MAPK
gene from cotton belonging to the group D MAPKs.
The corresponding protein is characterized by the presence of a TDY activation motif in its T-loop, the lack
of a CD domain and an extended C-terminal region
compared to the TEY subtypes of MAPKs (Figure 1A).
These structural differences suggest that group D
MAPKs may function differently from other MAPKs.
The subcellular localization of group D MAPKs has
not been established. OsBWMK1, a group D MAPK
from rice, is found in the nucleus and mediates pathogenesis-related gene expression by activating the OsEREBP1 transcription factor [11]. Intriguingly, the
alternative splicing of OsBWMK1 generates three different transcriptional variants that produce proteins with
different subcellular localizations [15]. In Arabidopsis,
AtMPK18 is located in the cytoplasm [14]. Analysis of
the subcellular localization of a GFP-tagged GhMPK16
protein in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells
revealed that GhMPK16 is likely localized in the nucleus

act as a transcriptional activator by activating the
expression of a set of target genes in the nucleus.
Gene expression patterns are usually an indicator of
gene function. Notably, GhMPK16 can be induced by
various pathogens, including X. campestris pv. malvacearum, R.solani and C. gossypii. RNA blot analyzes
revealed that the expression of GhMPK16 could be
induced by signal molecules such as SA, MeJA, and
ABA (Figure 4). These results imply that GhMPK16
may play a role in plant defense responses and in the
regulation of certain components of multiple stress-signaling pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis,
sequence analysis of the GhMPK16 promoter revealed
several motifs, such as Box-W1 element, ERE element
and TCA-element, related to motifs with important
roles in defense signaling.
Recently, a variety of MAPK genes have been identified and subsequently explored by both genetic and biochemical approaches. Increasing evidence has shown
that the MAPK cascade is an important pathway in
pathogen-triggered signal transduction [16,17]. Signal
molecules such as SA, jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene
(ET), regulate distinct sets of pathogenesis-related (PR)

genes in different pathogen defense pathways. SA and
MeJA are involved in two major defense signaling pathways, the SA-dependent and JA/ET-dependent defense
mechanisms, which act against different types of pathogens [18]. In Arabidopsis, AtMPK4 responds to the balance between SA and MeJA through the EDS1/PAD4
module and regulates the SA and JA/ET-related defense
responses [19]. When GhMPK16 is ectopically expressed
in Arabidopsis, the transgenic Arabidopsis show
enhanced disease resistance against bacteria (P. solanacearum) and fungi (C. nicotianae and A. alternate) (Figure 6, 7). PR1 is known as a marker gene for the SA
signaling pathway, and AtPR4 and AtPDF1.2 are markers for the JA/ET signaling pathway. Along with the
enhanced disease resistance in GhMPK16-overexpressing plants, the expression of the examined defenserelated genes AtPR1, AtPR4, and AtPDF1.2 was elevated.
Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that GhMPK16 may
be involved in the crosstalk between the SA- and JA/
ET- mediated pathogen defense pathways.
GhMPK16 showed a response to various abiotic stresses, such as low or high temperatures, mannitol and
NaCl (Figure 4). Interestingly, transgenic plants overexpressing GhMPK16 exhibited obvious drought sensitivity

Figure 9 DAB coloration assay of H2O2 accumulation in wild-type (WT) andGhMPK16-overexpressing transgenic plants after 200 mM
mannitol treatment. Mannitol was used to treat one-week-old plants for 0, 1, 3 or 6 h.

(Figure 8). GhMPK16 overexpression resulted in a significant reduction in both germination percentage and
root growth after mannitol treatment, and seedling
growth was more severely inhibited by drought stress in
GhMPK16-overexpressing plants than in wild-type
plants. ABA responds to the environmental signals to
protect plants from abiotic stresses, such as cold,
drought and salt stresses [20,21]. The expression of
GhMPK16 was strongly induced by exogenous ABA and
the GhMPK16-overexpressing plants were sensitive to
drought tolerance comparing with wild-type Arabidopsis, suggesting that GhMPK16 may be involved in ABA
signaling and caused negative function for drought

tolerance. DAB staining revealed that H 2 O 2 rapidly
accumulation in GhMPK16-overexpressing transgenic
plants after drought treatment (Figure 9). Excessive ROS
can injure plants. GhMPK16 accelerates the accumulation of H2O2, and this may be the reason that drought
causes more serious damage in the transgenic plants. In
Arabidopsis, MPK9 and MPK12 function downstream of
ROS to regulate guard cell ABA signaling positively
[13]. Guard cell-specific inhibition of Arabidopsis MPK3
expression causes abnormal stomatal responses to ABA
and H 2 O 2 [22] . More physiological, biochemical and
molecular experiments are needed to elucidate the
mechanism of GhMPK16 in response to drought stress.

Shi et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/22

On the basis of these observations, we propose that
GhMPK16 functions in at least two signaling pathways,
one that responds to pathogens and another that is
involved in drought stress. GhMPK16 may serve as a
point for crosstalk between biotic and abiotic stress
response signaling. Further studies on the function and
regulation of GhMPK16 are required.

Methods
Plant materials and treatments

The cotton cultivar Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Lumian 22
was used for all of the experiments. Germinated seedlings
were grown by aquaculture in tissue culture pots (sterile
water) under greenhouse conditions at 25°C with a 16 h
light/8 h dark cycle. The following treatments were performed on seven-day-old cotton seedlings: 10 mM Salicylic acid (SA), 100 μM methyl jasmonate (MeJA)
(ethanol as a solvent control) or 100 μM abscisic acid
(ABA) was sprayed onto leaves of cotton seedlings; seedling roots were placed in 200 mM NaCl and 200 mM
mannitol solutions for salt and drought stresses, respectively; seedling leaves were cut with scissors for wound
treatment; seedlings were placed in a growth chamber at
37°C or 12°C for the high and low temperature treatments, respectively; roots were dipped into suspensions
of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv.
malvacearum (X. campestris pv. malvacearum) (OD =
0.001) to cause a bacterial infection and the fungal pathogens Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum) and Colletotrichum gossypii
(C. gossypii) conidial suspensions (105 conidia/ml) in 1%
glucose were dropped onto plant leaves to cause the fungal infections. The plants treated with 1% glucose were
considered as mock. The leaves, roots and stems were
harvested at the appropriate time points as indicated and
frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analyzes.
Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia, Col-0) and transgenic
Arabidopsis seeds were planted directly in soil or transplanted after germinating on 1/2 MS agar medium and
grown in a chamber under SD (8 h light/16 h dark) or
LD (16 h light/8 h dark) conditions at 23°C. All seeds
were treated at 4°C for 2 d before being transferred to a
growth chamber. Arabidopsis were grown in SD conditions for 2-week and then transferred to LD conditions.
3-week-old Arabidopsis plants were used for the disease
resistance assays. The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas
solanacearum (P. solanacearum) was cultivated in
King’s B medium at 30°C for 2 days, and the bacterial
cells were resuspended in 10 mM MgCl2 to a concentration of 10 5 colony-forming units/ml (cfu/ml). Plants
were infected using the dipping method, and bacterial
titres were assessed by plating a dilution series of leaves
ground in 10 mM MgCl 2 on King’s B medium as
described by Liu et al. [23]. Infected leaves were

Page 12 of 15

sampled immediately and at 3- and 6-d after inoculation. To evaluate resistance against the fungal pathogens
Colletotrichum nicotianae (C. nicotianae) and Alternaria
alternate (A. alternate), two methods were used: the
detached leaf inoculation assay and the whole plant
inoculation assay. A spore suspension (106 conidia/ml)
was prepared in 1% glucose. In the detached leaf inoculation assay, leaves were inoculated with a 10 μl droplet
of conidial suspension. In the whole plant inoculation
assay, a vaporiser was used to inoculate the plants with
the conidial suspension. The inoculated leaves and
plants were kept in a moist chamber under dark conditions at 25°C for 48 h and then incubated under LD
conditions at 25°C.
For the drought stress tolerance analysis, Arabidopsis
were grown in SD conditions for 2-week and then transferred to LD conditions. For 15 d, 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants were completely withheld from water.
Additionally, Arabidopsis seeds were germinated in 1/2
MS agar medium or 1/2 MS agar medium supplemented
with 50 mM mannitol. Analysis of the growth of transgenic Arabidopsis after mannitol treatment, Arabidopsis
seeds germinated in 1/2 MS agar medium and incubated
for 3 d. The seedlings were then carefully transferred into
1/2 MS agar medium supplemented with 100 mM mannitol, and root lengths were measured over the next 10 d.
Cloning of the GhMPK16 gene

Total RNA was extracted from cotton seedling leaves
using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The fulllength GhMPK16 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of
cDNA ends-PCR (RACE-PCR).
The first cDNA strand was synthesised using approximately 2 μg of total RNA, the Oligo(dT)18 adaptor primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) for 1 h at 42°C. To clone the internal conserved fragment, primers MP1 and MP2 were
designed and synthesised based on the conserved amino
acid and nucleotide sequences of the plant group D
MAPK genes. Cloning was performed as described previously [24], and the primer sequences are provided in
Table 1.
Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of other plant
MAPK genes were retrieved from GenBank (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank). Amino acid sequence
alignments were performed using the DNAman 6.0 program. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the
Neighbour-Joining method using MEGA 4.
Amplification of the GhMPK16 genomic sequence

Total genomic DNA was extracted from cotton seedlings using a modified cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium

Shi et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2011, 12:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/12/22

bromide (CTAB) method [25]. The genomic DNA of
cotton was isolated to clone the DNA sequence and the
5’-flanking region of GhMPK16.
Two genomic DNA fragments were PCR amplified
with primers designed according to the GhMPK16
cDNA sequence. The first fragment was amplified with
primers FL1 and Z1, and the second fragment was
amplified with primers FL2 and Z2.
The promoter region was cloned using the inversePCR (I-PCR) method. Five restriction endonucleases
(Bam I, Bgl II, Dra I, Hind III and Xba I) were used to
digest the genomic DNA. Using T4 DNA ligase
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China), the DNA fragments were selfligated to form circles that were used as the template to
amplify the GhMPK16 promoter region. The 5’ flanking
region of GhMPK16 was obtained from the template
digested with Dra I. The exterior primers Wup1 and
Wdra1 and the interior primers Wup2 and Wdra2 were
used for the first and second rounds of PCR, respectively. The sequences of the primers used in this study
are provided in Table 1. The PlantCARE program
(http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/
html) was used to analyze the GhMPK16 promoter
sequences, which used default parameters.
Subcellular localization and Histochemical Analysis

To observe the cellular localization of GhMPK16, the
GhMPK16::GFP fusion construct was prepared. The
GhMPK16 coding region was amplified with primers
Wbd-1 and W-GFP, containing an Xba I site upstream
and an Xho I site downstream of the deleted stop codon,
respectively. The resulting fragment was inserted into the
Xba I/Xho I site of the binary vector pBI121-GFP, and
the fragment was fused to GFP and placed under the
control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Particle bombardment was performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (PDS-1000, Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA), using gold particles (1.0 μl)
and 1350 psi helium pressure. After bombardment, tissues were incubated on MS agar medium under dark
conditions at 23°C for 12 h. Nuclei were stained with 100
μg/ml of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Solarbio,
Beijing, China) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min.
GFP fluorescence and DAPI fluorescence were examined
with a laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META,
ZEISS, Germany) using excitation wavelengths of 488 nm
and 350 nm, respectively.
Immunoblot analysis

The GhMPK16::GFP recombinant plasmid was introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
GV3101. The A. tumefaciens strains were grown overnight in YEB media. Pellet and resuspended cells was

Page 13 of 15

performed as described by Guo [26]. Resuspended cells
were infiltrated into leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana
benthamiana plants as described previously [27,28]. Epidermal cell layers of plant leaves were assayed for fluorescence with a fluorescence microscope (BX51, model
7.3; Olympus) 3 d after injection. Total plant proteins
were extracted as Silverstone described [29]. The proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (12%) and
analyzed on immunoblots using a 1000-fold dilution of
anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Beyotime, Haimen,
China) and a 5000-fold dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beyotime). The
signals were detected by chemiluminescence.
Southern blot hybridisation

Genomic DNA (30 μg/sample) was digested with EcoR
V, EcoR I, Xba I or Hind III then separated on 0.8%
agarose gels by electrophoresis and transferred onto a
Hybond-N+ Nylon membrane (Amersham, Pharmacia,
UK). A gene-specific dCTP-[a-32P]-labelled probe was
synthesised with the GhMPK16 fragment (primers FL1
and 5P2) using the Primer-a-Gene ® Labeling System
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The hybridisation was carried out
for 24 h at 42°C. After the hybridisation, the blots were
washed two times with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and three
times with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min each at 42°
C, and the radioactive signal was visualised using a
FLA-7000 phosphorimager (FUJIFILM).
RNA blot hybridisation and semi-quantitative RT-PCR
analyzes

Total RNA was isolated from cotton seedling leaves
using the method described above. Total RNA (15 μg)
from each sample was separated on a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond-N + Nylon
membranes (Amersham, Pharmacia, UK). Gene-specific
dCTP-[a-32P]-labelled probe was synthesis (primers FL2
and 5P3) and RNA blot hybridisation were performed
using the methods described for the Southern blot
hybridisation.
To analyze gene expression in transgenic plants by
RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from wild-type and
transgenic plants using the method described above for
gene cloning. Amplifications were performed at 94°C for
5 min, followed by 25-30 cycles of amplification (94°C
for 50 s, 50°C for 50 s, and 72°C for 40 s). The PCR
products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and
visualised after ethidium bromide staining. To ensure
that equal cDNA amounts were used in each reaction,
EF-1a was used as a loading control. The gene-specific
primers used in RT-PCR analyzes are listed in Table 1.

Vector construction and plant transformation

The GhMPK16 coding region was amplified using primers Wbd-1 and Wbd-2 (Table 1). The amplified fragment was then subcloned into the binary vector pBI121
under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The
recombinant plasmid was introduced into the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. Arabidopsis was transformed using
the floral dip method [30]. Transformants were selected
on 1/2 MS agar medium containing 30 μg/ml of kanamycin. The transgenic T 3 lines were used in the
experiments.
Histochemical detection of H2O2

The substrate, 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB), was used to
visually detect H2O2 in plants [31]. Arabidopsis plants
(one-week-old) were treated with 200 mM mannitol for
0, 1, 3, and 6 h. The samples were incubated in 1 mg/
ml DAB solution (pH 3.8) for 6 h, and then treated with

3’ RACE reverse primer, outer

95% ethanol to remove chlorophyll. In the presence of
H2O2, DAB is locally polymerised and produces visible
brown stain.
