Abstract
Background: Methanogenic Archaea play key metabolic roles in anaerobic ecosystems, where
they use H2 and other substrates to produce methane. Methanococcus maripaludis is a model for
studies of the global response to nutrient limitations.
Results: We used high-coverage quantitative proteomics to determine the response of M.
maripaludis to growth-limiting levels of H2, nitrogen, and phosphate. Six to ten percent of the
proteome changed significantly with each nutrient limitation. H2 limitation increased the abundance
of a wide variety of proteins involved in methanogenesis. However, one protein involved in
methanogenesis decreased: a low-affinity [Fe] hydrogenase, which may dominate over a higheraffinity mechanism when H2 is abundant. Nitrogen limitation increased known nitrogen assimilation
proteins. In addition, the increased abundance of molybdate transport proteins suggested they
function for nitrogen fixation. An apparent regulon governed by the euryarchaeal nitrogen
regulator NrpR is discussed. Phosphate limitation increased the abundance of three different sets
of proteins, suggesting that all three function in phosphate transport.
Conclusion: The global proteomic response of M. maripaludis to each nutrient limitation suggests
a wider response than previously appreciated. The results give new insight into the function of
several proteins, as well as providing information that should contribute to the formulation of a
regulatory network model.

Background
Methanogenic Archaea (methanogens) occupy a distinct
position in phylogeny, ecology, and physiology. Occupying much of the phylum Euryarchaeota, and widespread
in anaerobic environments, these organisms produce
methane as the product of energy-generating metabolism
[1]. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens specialize in the use

of H2 as electron donor to reduce CO2 to methane. The
pathways of methanogenesis are well characterized and
the proteins that catalyze steps in the pathways are
known.
We are engaged in a long-term effort to understand regulatory networks in hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Our

studies focus on Methanococcus maripaludis, a model species with tractable laboratory growth characteristics and
facile genetic tools. Previous studies in M. maripaludis
have begun to reveal both mechanisms of regulation and
global patterns of gene expression. Many of these studies
have concentrated on the effects of certain nutrient limitations. For example, at the mechanistic level, transcription
of genes encoding nitrogen assimilation functions is governed by a repressor, NrpR, which is found in many Euryarchaeota as well as certain Bacteria and mediates the
organism's response to nitrogen limitation [2-4]. However, a global assessment of the response to nitrogen limitation has not previously been conducted in
hydrogenotrophic methanogens. At the global level, our
previous studies have addressed the effects on the transcriptome of H2-limitation, phosphate-limitation, and
leucine-limitation [5,6]. The effects of these nutrient limitations at the proteome level have not previously been
studied. We have also determined the effects on the transcriptome and proteome of a mutation in a hydrogenase
gene [7,8].
Here we focus on the effects of certain nutrient limitations
on the proteome of M. maripaludis. We report on the effect
of limiting H2, the electron donor of hydrogenotrophic
methanogenesis, and of limiting basic nutrients of biosynthesis: nitrogen and phosphate. Key aspects of our
approach include the use of continuous culture for maintaining defined nutrient conditions [9], and exhaustive
sampling of the proteome to obtain statistically reliable
quantitative information (Xia Q, Wang T, Hendrickson
EL, Leigh JA, Hackett M, manuscript in preparation).

Results and discussion
Approach
We used chemostats to grow M. maripaludis under three
different nutrient limitations (nutrient-controlled
growth) [9]. Thus, growth was limited by the supply of H2,
ammonia, or phosphate to grow cultures that were H2limited, nitrogen-limited, or phosphate-limited, respectively. The dilution rate (and hence growth rate) was held
constant, and the limiting nutrient was provided at a level
that limited cell density to a similar value in each case. As
before [5,6], this approach allowed us to obtain a rigorous
assessment of the effect of each nutrient limitation without complications arising from variations in growth rate
or cell density.

Diagrams are provided that show the experimental design
for sample handling and mass spectrometry analysis (Figure 1) and nutrient limitation comparisons (Figure 2). To
assess the effect of each nutrient limitation, the proteome
from that nutrient limitation was directly compared to the
proteome from the two other nutrient limitations. For
example, the effect of H2 limitation was determined from
the comparison of H2-limited samples (H) to nitrogen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/149

limited samples (N) and phosphate-limited samples (P),
yielding H/N ratios and H/P ratios respectively. Similarly,
the effect of nitrogen limitation was determined from N/
H and N/P ratios, and of phosphate limitation from P/H
and P/N ratios. This approach avoided comparison of a
nutrient-limited culture to a non-nutrient-limited culture,
which would introduce complications arising from variations in growth rate or cell density. Each comparison was
conducted by mixing a 14N-labeled (natural abundance)
sample with a 15N-labeled sample after digestion into
tryptic fragments but prior to proteomic analysis (Figure
1). As a result of this approach, each nutrient limitation
was assessed in a total of four comparisons, using two biological replicates with "flipped" metabolic labels for each
nutrient limitation (Figure 2). Proteomics were conducted
by 2-D capillary HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry as before [8], with modifications as noted in
Methods. Extensive proteome pre-fractionation by HPLC
prior to 2-D capillary HPLC as described previously [8]
and the modest size of the M. maripaludis proteome led to
greater sampling depth and proteome coverage (91% of
the annotated ORFs were observed experimentally) than
is typical for studies of this type [10], essentially saturating
each sample in terms of protein identifications. Further
repeated replicates would not have led to any significant
increase in identifications at the protein level, although a
few additional peptides might potentially have been
matched with the database. The average number of
unique peptide sequences assigned to each detected protein-encoding ORF was 10. The average number of redundant heavy/light and light/heavy peptide pairs recovered
for each detected ORF in each comparison of two nutrient
limitation states, for purposes of abundance ratio generation, was 198. (Here the term "redundant" refers to measurements that include repeated sampling of the same
peptide pair where each observed pair is an estimator of
the relative change in protein abundance as in our previous work [8,10].) However, such statistical power is a
mixed blessing in that one must then distinguish between
real regulatory trends and minor random changes in the
system. With so many redundant measurements, it
becomes possible to detect very small abundance changes,
of magnitude 10% or less, that may or may not have biological meaning [10]. Biological relevance was inferred in
part by looking at the consistency of change observed
across nutrient limitation comparisons and biological
replicates (isotopic flips), as well as the magnitude of the
q-values for each abundance ratio and the criteria given
below.
All ratios and statistical values are provided in Additional
file 1. Protein abundance was considered to be affected by
a particular nutrient limitation only if a significant difference (log2 ratio ≠ 0, q-value ≤ 0.01) was seen in all four
comparisons described above, except in a few cases where
manual inspection of the data suggested that one of the

four determinations was an outlier, in which case it was
disregarded. qRT-PCR was used to assess mRNA abundance ratios for selected ORFs. These measurements confirmed the proteomic trends in each case tested, and also
contributed data supporting the concept that proteomic
abundance ratios generated using shotgun methods are
compressed [8,10], that is, they tend to underestimate the
magnitude of the ratios, especially for highly expressed
proteins or high ratios as shown in Tables 1 and 2 and discussed below. The observed compression is consistent
with the dynamic range limitations associated with both
shotgun proteomics (~102 to ~103) and mRNA microarray
analysis, relative to qRT-PCR [10].

H2 limitation
The abundance of 141 proteins (8% of the 1722 annotated ORFs) was significantly affected by H2-limitation; 59
had increased abundance and 82 decreased. H/N and H/
P ratios and their averages are shown in Additional file 2.
The functional category of proteins that most frequently
increased was methanogenesis (Table 1). In a previous
study at the transcriptome level [5], only a subset of the
mRNAs encoding the proteins of methanogenesis was
seen to increase significantly; these included the F420reducing hydrogenase (fru), methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer), and methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (mtd), all encoding enzymes

that reduce or oxidize coenzyme F420. In contrast, in the
current study of the proteome, many enzymes in methanogenesis that do not metabolize F420 increased as well.
Another difference between the results of the previous
transcriptome study and the current proteomics study was
in the magnitude of the increase for the F420-metabolizing
enzymes; whereas these mRNAs were previously seen to
increase markedly (4–22 fold), the magnitude of change
in protein abundance in the current study was at most 2.5fold. The lower magnitude of change in the current study
held at the mRNA level, since qRT-PCR of mtd revealed an
average log2 ratio of only 0.89 (1.9-fold), compared to 4.3
(19.7-fold) in the previous study.

There are several possible reasons why the current study
reflects more widespread but less marked changes than
the earlier study of the transcriptome. First, our measurement of abundance changes and the significance of those
changes have different limitations for the transcriptome
and the proteome. Much of the proteome was very heavily
sampled in this study, so statistically significant differences are more easily discerned as discussed above. Second, even if the transcriptome study were statistically
robust, effects on protein abundance could occur at a
post-mRNA level. It should be noted that these first two
explanations may apply to the non-F420-metabolizing
enzymes, but for the F420-metabolizing enzymes it is

insufficient, based on our qRT-PCR measurements of mtd.
Third, a caveat to the comparison of the two studies is that
growth conditions were different, since the previous study
was conducted with a richer medium and at a higher
growth rate than the current study. Finally, it should be
noted that the strain used in the current study differs from
the strain used previously. Mm900, the strain used in the
current study, contains a deletion of the hpt gene encoding
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase [11], while S52,
the strain used in the previous study, is a leucine auxotroph containing a deletion of the leuA gene [9]. While the
known differences lie outside of hydrogen metabolism or
methanogenesis, it is conceivable that there were
unknown consequences for methanogenesis. In any case,
the results of the current study show that effects of H2-limitation occur widely for proteins of methanogenesis. The
overall increase in methanogenic proteins with H2 limitation likely reflects a regulatory response that maintains
flux through the methanogenic pathway when the electron donating substrate is limiting.
One protein decreased strikingly with H2-limitation, the
H2-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehy-

drogenase, Hmd (Table 1). The previous study of the transcriptome [5] indicated an increase in hmd mRNA with
faster growth, but no change with H2-limitation. The discrepancy could be explained by any of the factors discussed above. In any case, the results indicate that Hmd
has a decreased role under H2-limitation. In hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Hmd catalyses the reduction of
methenyltetrahydromethanopterin to methylenetetrahydromethanopterin, using H2 directly as electron donor. As
such, Hmd provides an alternative to F420-reducing hydrogenase (Fru or Frc in M. maripaludis) and F420-dependent
methylenetetrahydromethanopterin
dehydrogenase
(Mtd) working together: Fru or Frc reduces F420 using H2,
and Mtd reduces methenyltetrahydromethanopterin to
methylenetetrahydromethanopterin using reduced F420.
Hmd is an unusual [Fe] hydrogenase that has a lower
affinity for H2 than the F420-reducing hydrogenases
[12,13], and could be preferred when H2 is in excess,
while Fru or Frc with Mtd could be preferred when H2 is
limiting. Other proteins that decreased were a hypothetical protein (encoded in a putative operon with Hmd), a
putative iron transporter subunit, glutamine synthetase,
and an S-layer protein (MMP0875). An additional S-layer

protein (MMP0383) was not significantly affected by any
nutrient limitation.
Nitrogen limitation
The abundance of 106 proteins was significantly affected
by nitrogen limitation; 79 had increased abundance and
27 decreased. N/H and N/P ratios and their averages are
shown in Additional file 3. Of the 79 proteins with
increased abundance, 13 have known functions in nitrogen assimilation (Table 2). These are the nitrogen fixation
(Nif) proteins, glutamine synthetase (GlnA) which assimilates ammonia, ammonia transporters (Amt), and nitrogen sensor/regulators (GlnK).

Since the Nif proteins showed a consistent and relatively
marked increase in abundance, the mRNA encoding one
(nifK) was selected for qRT-PCR to determine whether the
effect occurred with similar magnitude at the transcriptome level. The magnitude was much greater, with an
average log2 ratio of 7.09 (136-fold) for the mRNA compared to 2.03 (4.1-fold) for the protein. Previous measurements of nif transcription using lacZ fusions also showed
a greater magnitude of regulation (5–100 fold, [14,15]).
The results suggest that for proteins that are present at
high levels under derepressed conditions, the proteomic
ratios may be compressed as noted above. In nitrogen-fixing organisms in general, Nif proteins are present at high

levels under nitrogen-fixing conditions when fixed nitrogen species are not available or are present at limiting
amounts, but are absent when available fixed nitrogen is
in excess.
Other proteins were not previously predicted to function
in nitrogen assimilation, yet increased in abundance with
nitrogen limitation (Table 2). Three such proteins were
predicted subunits of three molybdate transporters, and
their response to nitrogen limitation suggests that they
function to transport molybdate for conversion into the
iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoCo) of nitrogenase. A
protein belonging to the NifB-NifX family of FeMoCo synthesis proteins also increased.
Surprisingly, several proteins that play central roles in carbon assimilation also increased: subunits of pyruvate oxidoreductase and oxoisovalerate oxidoreductase, as well as
acetyl-CoA synthetase (AMP-forming). In hydrogenotrophic methanogens, pyruvate oxidoreductase and oxoisovalerate oxidoreductase each reductively assimilates
CO2. In addition, ATPase increased moderately (Additional file 3). Proteins that decreased with nitrogen limitation included flagellins, chemotaxis proteins, certain
proteins of methanogenesis, and HmdII, a homolog of
the H2-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin

dehydrogenase Hmd. HmdII is not known to have the catalytic activity of Hmd and its function is unknown.
A known transcriptional nitrogen regulator, NrpR, binds
to operators with consensus sequence GGAAN6TTCC
[3,4]. The intergenic regions in M. maripaludis that contain
this sequence are upstream of the following genes: the nif
operon, the glnK-amtB operon, glnA, two of the three
molybdate transporter operons (MMP0205–0207 and
MMP0504–0507), and a gene encoding a Na+-alanine
symporter (MMP1511). (The Na+-alanine symporter may
function in nitrogen assimilation since alanine is a nitrogen source for M. maripaludis, [11].) Data presented above
suggest for all of these genes except the Na+-alanine symporter that nitrogen regulation indeed occurs. Furthermore, NrpR-dependent regulation of nif and glnA has
been documented previously [3,4,16]. Since the proteomics data for the Na+-alanine symporter was inconclusive,
we tested for nitrogen regulation by growing batch cultures on the preferred, intermediate, and non-preferred
nitrogen sources ammonia, L-alanine, and N2, using a
promoter-lacZ fusion. β-galactosidase activities were
1060, 2147, and 3122 (standard deviations 21, 193, and
178) respectively, indicating that the gene for the Na+alanine symporter is also regulated by nitrogen. Hence,
the following genes are likely regulated directly by NrpR:
nif and glnA as documented previously, the glnK-amtB
operon, the two molybdate transporter operons
MMP0205–0207 and MMP0504–0507, and the Na+alanine symporter gene. The remaining proteins affected
by nitrogen limitation, including the NifB-NifX homolog
and the third molybdate transporter MMP0514–0516,
may respond indirectly to NrpR or may be influenced by
different mechanisms.
Phosphate limitation
The abundance of 163 proteins was significantly affected
by phosphate limitation; 80 proteins increased and 83
decreased. P/H and P/N ratios and their averages are
shown in Additional file 4. The proteins that increased the
most markedly were those of a phosphate ABC transporter
(Table 3). Homologous phosphate transporters are
present in a wide variety of Bacteria, where they are similarly affected by phosphate limitation [17]. Also affected
were a homolog of a phosphate transport regulator
(PhoU) encoded adjacent to another set of ABC transporter subunits, and a putative Na+-phosphate cotransporter. All of these were also affected by phosphate
limitation at the mRNA level, with the phosphate ABC
transporter (MMP1095–1099) the most markedly regulated [6]. These results suggest that M. maripaludis has
three different phosphate transporters, all of which are
regulated by phosphate conditions. Proteins that
decreased with phosphate limitation included the CO2assimilating carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetylCoA

synthase, acetyl-CoA synthetase (AMP-forming), and certain proteins of methanogenesis (Additional file 4).
Proteins affected by multiple factors
Several proteins were affected by two nutrient limitations
(Table 4). A variety were negatively affected by H2-limitation and positively affected by nitrogen limitation. Others
(proteins encoded in an operon involved in nickel transport and coenzyme M biosynthesis) were negatively
affected by H2-limitation and positively affected by phosphate limitation. AMP-forming acetylCoA synthetase was
affected positively by nitrogen limitation and negatively
by phosphate limitation. Flagellins were affected negatively by nitrogen limitation and positively by phosphate
limitation. A study in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii
observed a different effect, where H2 limitation resulted in
an increase in flagella [18]. That study is not easily compared to the present one, since batch culture was used.
However, it is possible that motility and chemotaxis in the
two organisms have evolved to increase access to different
vital nutrients. Another factor may lie in the ability of M.
maripaludis but not M. jannaschii to fix nitrogen. Nitrogen
fixation is an energy-demanding process and M. maripaludis under nitrogen fixing conditions may decrease
other energy-demanding processes such as motility in
order to conserve energy.

Conclusion
From this study we have gained new insights into the
response of M. maripaludis to nutrient limitations. H2 limitation affected the proteins of methanogenesis more
widely than we had previously appreciated. Many proteins of methanogenesis increased in abundance, in an
apparent regulatory response to maintain flux through the
methanogenic pathway when H2 is limiting. In contrast,
the H2-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin
dehydrogenase (Hmd) decreased. Under H2-limitation
the function of Hmd may be replaced with the F420-

dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Mtd) together with F420-reducing hydrogenase
(Frc or Fru).
Many proteins that increased with nitrogen limitation
have known functions in nitrogen assimilation and have
similarly regulated counterparts in Bacteria and other
Archaea [19,20]. Other proteins that increased apparently
function in nitrogenase FeMoCo synthesis or to import
molybdate for FeMoCo, or to import alanine when used
as a nitrogen source. The results help to identify the regulon that is directly regulated by the nitrogen repressor
NrpR.
The response to phosphate limitation supports the
hypothesis that M. maripaludis has three alternative phosphate transporters, all of which increased under phosphate limitation.

Methods
Culture conditions
Methanococcus maripaludis strain Mm900 [11] was grown
in chemostats as described [9], with the following modifications. Amino acid stocks were omitted from the
medium, resulting in a defined medium that contained
acetate, vitamins, and cysteine as the sole organic constituents. NH4Cl was added to the medium after autoclaving
from a sterile anaerobic stock. Ar replaced N2 in the gas
mixture. For growth of nitrogen-limited cultures, NH4 +
was decreased to 3 mM in the medium that was pumped
into the chemostats, and for growth of phosphate-limited
cultures, PO4 2- was decreased to 0.15 mM (for sample 31)
or 0.13 mM (for sample 82). For growth of H2-limited cultures, H2 was decreased to 20 ml/min and the difference
made up with Ar. The dilution rate in every case was 0.083
h-1, and the OD660 at harvesting was between 0.62 and
0.71. Two cultures were obtained for each nutrient limitation, one grown with 14NH4 + (natural abundance) and
the other with 15NH4 + supplied as 15NH4Cl. Sample col-

lection from the chemostats for proteomics was as
described [5].
Proteomics
Proteomic analyses were conducted as described [8], with
the primary exception that a Thermo LTQ linear ion trap
mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher, San Jose, CA) has
since replaced the LCQ Classic mass spectrometer for all
work reported here. Details of the proteome extraction,
trypsin digestion, solution volumes, off-line HPLC fractionation and 2-D capillary HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry, AKA MudPIT [21], Sequest database searching
[22], DTASelect 1.9 in silico mapping of peptides to M.
maripaludis protein-encoding ORFs [23], software and
database release dates and versions were as described.
Briefly, protein was extracted from each of the six cultures
depicted in Figure 1. The six protein extracts were digested
with trypsin and then combined pair wise as shown in Figure 1, such that equal amounts of heavy (15N) and light
(14N) total protein were used for each condition being
compared, as determined by Bradford assay [24,25]. Each
of the six combined heavy/light proteolysates shown in
Figure 1 were pre-fractionated and analyzed twice by 2-D
capillary HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry. The data from
the two technical replicates were pooled, yielding a single
dataset for each heavy/light mixture. These mass spectrometry datasets (see Additional data files) were labeled
in the Hackett Lab archive as AH30-31-104 (14N phosphate, 15N ammonia), AH30-31-49 (14N phosphate, 15N
hydrogen), AH30-49-98 (15N hydrogen, 14N ammonia),
AH30-54-104 (14N hydrogen, 15N ammonia) AH30-8254 (15N phosphate, 14N hydrogen) and AH30-82-98 (15N
phosphate, 14N ammonia). To ensure that equimolar
amounts of total protein were being compared, the Bradford assay results were confirmed by inspecting the calculated abundance ratio frequency distribution histograms
for zero centering (log2 scale) and making slight adjustments in the ratios where necessary [8]. In no case did the
normalization of the ratios exceed a 5% change in the

total signal observed in either channel (14N or 15N). Raw
data from the six heavy/light mixtures (Figure 1) were
processed as described previously, except as noted below,
to yield abundance ratios reported in Additional file 1.
Figure 2 illustrates the use of the abundance ratios derived
from the six unique mixtures (Figure 1) of isotopic flips to
calculate the total of 12 two-condition comparisons with
four abundance ratios for each of the three limiting nutrient conditions, as reported in Additional files 2, 3, 4 for
proteins showing significant abundance change. Statistical analysis differed from that reported previously [8] in
that a q-value [26,27] cut-off of 0.01 was used for all significance testing for abundance change between paired
conditions, rather than p-values. The q-value is based on
the concept of FDR (false discovery rate) and contains an
explicit correction for multiple hypothesis testing that is
lacking in an uncorrected p-value calculation [26]. At the
level of qualitative peptide identifications, the estimated
FDRs for the work reported here were ~3%, based on
matches with reversed protein sequences in the decoy portion of the database [28,29]. Along with a minimum
requirement of three unique peptide sequences required
for each identification, this estimate suggests a low
number of false positive protein level identifications. The
composition, release dates, and other details of the FASTA
database were the same as those reported previously [8],
with the exception that the database has been approximately doubled in size to 40 Mbytes by addition of
reversed sequences to the forward protein sequences for
M. maripaludis (Genbank™ Accession BX950229) and
addition of about 25% of the human subset of the nrdb
[30]. For purposes of validating protein derived abundance ratios, qRT-PCR was conducted as described [8].
