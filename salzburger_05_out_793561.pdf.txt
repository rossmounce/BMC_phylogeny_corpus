Abstract
Background: The adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes in East Africa are well known for their
spectacular diversity and their astonishingly fast rates of speciation. About 80% of all 2,500 cichlid
species in East Africa, and virtually all cichlid species from Lakes Victoria (~500 species) and Malawi
(~1,000 species) are haplochromines. Here, we present the most extensive phylogenetic and
phylogeographic analysis so far that includes about 100 species and is based on about 2,000 bp of
the mitochondrial DNA.
Results: Our analyses revealed that all haplochromine lineages are ultimately derived from Lake
Tanganyika endemics. We find that the three most ancestral lineages of the haplochromines sensu
lato are relatively species poor, albeit widely distributed in Africa, whereas a fourth newly defined
lineage – the 'modern haplochromines' – contains an unparalleled diversity that makes up more
than 7% of the worlds' ~25,000 teleost species. The modern haplochromines' ancestor, most likely
a riverine generalist, repeatedly gave rise to similar ecomorphs now found in several of the species
flocks. Also, the Tanganyikan Tropheini are derived from that riverine ancestor suggesting that they
successfully re-colonized Lake Tanganyika and speciated in parallel to an already established cichlid
adaptive radiation. In contrast to most other known examples of adaptive radiations, these
generalist ancestors were derived from highly diverse and specialized endemics from Lake
Tanganyika. A reconstruction of life-history traits revealed that in an ancestral lineage leading to
the modern haplochromines the characteristic egg-spots on anal fins of male individuals evolved.
Conclusion: We conclude that Lake Tanganyika is the geographic and genetic cradle of all
haplochromine lineages. In the ancestors of the replicate adaptive radiations of the 'modern
haplochromines', behavioral (maternal mouthbrooding), morphological (egg-spots) and sexually
selected (color polymorphism) key-innovations arose. These might be – together with the
ecological opportunity that the habitat diversity of the large lakes provides – responsible for their
evolutionary success and their propensity for explosive speciation.

With estimated numbers of about 1,000 and 500 species
respectively the assemblages of cichlid fishes of East African lakes Malawi (LM) and Victoria (LV) are, by far, the
most species-rich species flocks [1-6]. In Lake Tanganyika
(LT), Africa's oldest lake, "only" about 200 to 250 cichlid
species occur, but they are phenotypically, behaviorally
and genetically more diverse [7-9]. Remarkably, almost
100% of the species of all of these flocks are endemics and
the three East African Great Lakes do not have a single
cichlid species in common [10]. While in LT at least
twelve eco-morphologically distinct tribes can be clearly
distinguished phylogenetically [7,9,11], the species flocks
of LM and LV are entirely comprised of cichlids assigned
to only one of these tribes, the Haplochromini
[1,4,10,12]. Additionally, several less species-rich flocks
of haplochromines are found in smaller lakes in East
Africa [10], some of which have been combined with the
LV radiation into a "superflock" of closely related species
[4,12,13].

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the adaptive
radiations of cichlids in general and the formation of East
African cichlid species flocks in particular, several crucial
questions still remain to be answered: (i) What evolutionary lineages from which geographic ranges make up the
diversity of haplochromines? (ii) Which were the founding lineages of the lacustrine adaptive radiations and were
they riverine generalists? (iii) Can particular behavioral
and/or morphological key-innovations be identified that
might be causally related with the diversification of haplochromines? With the aim of addressing these questions,
we conducted the most extensive phylogenetic and phylogeographic study of haplochromine cichlids so far, analyzing a portion of up to 2,000 bp of the mitochondrial
genome of about 100 species. We included representatives
of relevant cichlid tribes from LT [7,9,15] as well as members of all major riverine and lacustrine haplochromine
lineages and all but one haplochromine genus (following
[12]).

Not all haplochromines are lacustrine, however, and
some 200 species inhabit rivers and occur in northern-,
eastern-, southern- and central-Africa but are virtually
absent from West Africa [10,12] (Fig. 1). Traditionally, it
was believed that riverine haplochromines seeded the
cichlid radiations in all East African Great Lakes [8,10].
Molecular-based phylogenies indeed uncovered haplochromine lineages that are ancestral to the species flocks
of LM and LV (see e.g., [1,4,9,14]. In contrast, the primary
radiation of LT's cichlid assemblage was found to predate
the origin of haplochromine lineages [9,15,16] suggesting
a close phylogenetic affinity of the ancestor(s) of the haplochromines to other tribes in LT [9]. However, only a relatively small fraction of the genetic and geographic
diversity of the haplochromines has been included in previous phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies.

Results

That the haplochromines have a particularly strong propensity for explosive speciation among cichlids is best
illustrated by their unparalleled species-richness and
diversity. With the exception of two LT lineages (Lamprologini: ~70–100 species; Ectodini: ~25–30 species), discrete adaptive radiations of non-haplochromines are
comprised by about a dozen species at most. Thus, which
evolutionary novelties might be causally related to the
explosive speciation that distinguish the haplochromines
from all other cichlid lineages remains a crucial question
for the understanding of the explosive patterns of cichlid
evolution in East Africa. Haplochromines furthermore
represent prime examples for parallel evolution, and it is
particularly the lacustrine haplochromine species flocks
that independently evolved morphologies and color-patterns that are convergent between species of different lakes
[2,17,18].

The neighbor-joining analysis based on 304 complete
mitochondrial control region sequences (Fig. 2) could not
resolve the phylogenetic relationships between haplochromine lineages and the LT lineages with convincing
bootstrap support. However, this analysis, which primarily aimed to provide a basis for the selection of taxa for
the second set of analyses, already indicated the existence
of a monophyletic clade that is comprised by the Tanganyikan Tropheini, sister-group to a clade consisting of the
LM cichlids plus several East African riverine and lacustrine lineages and the representatives of the LV region
superflock [4].
In the maximum likelihood tree of the dataset including
100 taxa (Fig. 3) the LT Eretmodini were placed as sister
group to the LT Lamprologini, followed by a clade comprised by the two representatives of the Limnochromini
(Limnochromis auritus, Triglachromis otostigma) plus Cyphotilapia frontosa, and all remaining taxa. Among these, a
clade that includes four LT tribes (Cyprichromini, Ectodini, Limnochromini, Perissodini) plus the Orthochromis
species from the Malagarasi drainage, which had so far
been considered to belong to the Haplochromini, was
recovered as sister group to the remaining haplochromine
representatives. The latter, the haplochromines sensu lato,
clustered into four distinct groups, with a Congolese/
South-African lineage (CSA) sister to the Pseudocrenilabrus, the Astatoreochromis-lineage, and the 'modern haplochromines' (i.e. a clade comprised by the LT Tropheini sister to the LM representatives, several East-African riverine
lineages and the members of the LV region superflock).
Bayesian inference revealed the same branching order for
the different lineages. In the strict consensus topology of
the 78,617 most parsimonious trees (unweighted tree

resolved as sister group to the Lamprologini, the Limnochromini plus C. frontosa, four LT tribes plus the Malagarasi Orthochromis and the haplochromines sensu lato. Here,

lineage, and as sister group to a clade comprised by the

Figure 2
50% majority-rule bootstrap consensus tree of 304 cichlid fish specimens based on 862 bp of the mitochondrial
control region (neighbor-joining, HKY85 model with gamma substitution correction, 5,000 replicates). Relevant bootstrap
values are depicted on the respective branches. The branches colored in red indicate the taxa that were chosen for the phylogenetic analyses combining the control region with sequences of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit II gene (see Fig. 3; for Ctenochromis oligacanthus from GenBank no control region sequence was available). The colors of the boxes that indicate the major
clades refer to Figs. 1 and 3, the labels of the clades correspond to Table 1 [see Additional file 1]. Note that Haplochromis
bloyeti (marked by an asterisks) had a control region sequence identical to H. sp. 1533 of [25], which was collected in the Malagarasi River, and grouped – together with other fishes from the Malagarasi area and from the Lake Edward/George region –
into their group VII. Likewise, our H. sp. Tanzania I (marked by a circle) was identical to H. sp. 1738 of [25], which was collected in Lake Chala and clustered with other taxa from Tanzania into their group VI. In addition to Haplochromis gracilior
(endemic to Lake Kivu), which was recently identified as close relative of the Lake Victoria superflock [4], we found another
sister group to the superflock. This lineage includes Haplochromis paludinosus that occurs in the Malagarasi, as well as undescribed species from Tanzania and Lake Edward (see also Fig. 3). Like Haplochromis gracilior from Lake Kivu, all these taxa have
the diagnostic character state 'Adenine' in position 630 of the control region alignment and root to the Lake Victoria superflock through the central rift valley haplotype [4], corroborating the view that Lake Kivu is the main reservoir from which the
Lake Victoria superflock evolved [4].

based on 100 taxa. Numbers above the branches represent Bayesian posterior probabilities obtained with Mr. Bayes, numbers
below the branches represent maximum-likelihood bootstraps (100 replicates, obtained with PAUP*). Boulengerochromis microlepis and Oreochromis tanganicae, two tilapiine cichlids in LT, were used as outgroup taxa [9, 15, 16, 63]. In accordance to previous studies [9, 15] we find that within the LT species flock the Eretmodini (Ere.) are placed as sister group to the Lamprologini
(Lampr.) plus several LT tribes ("Tanganyika") including the Orthochromis assemblage from the Malagarasi plains, and the haplochromines sensu lato. The latter clade combines four distinct lineages, a Congolese/South-African- (CSA; ~150 species), the
Pseudocrenilabrus- (3 species), the Astatoreochromis-lineage (3 species), and the modern haplochromines (~1,800 species). The
modern haplochromines combine the LT Tropheini, the species flock of LM, several riverine lineages as well as the LV region
superflock according to [4]. The haplochromines sensu lato are characterized by their breeding behavior; true egg-spots (ocelli)
are likely to have evolved in the ancestor of the Astatoreochromis-lineage and the modern haplochromines. By contrast, the
Malagarasi River Orthochromis are biparental caregivers [34] providing behavioral support for our molecular-based classification
that excluded these fish from the haplochromines sensu lato. We note that several genera are polyphyletic and major taxonomic revisions will be required in the future to take our phylogenetic results into consideration. For example, Orthochromis of
the Malagarasi River plains form a clade outside the remaining haplochromines in close affinity to the LT Ectodini (see also [9])
whereas Orthochromis polyacanthus and O. stormsi, which share derived features [12], fall – in accordance to their distribution –
into the Congolese/South African clade. Other polyphyletic genera are Astatotilapia, Ctenochromis, and Haplochromis. The grey
arrows next to some species names refer to the pictures on the right, the asterisk symbol marks the ancestor of the haplochromines sensu lato, the circle symbol marks a "piebald" ("orange blotched") form as found in the modern haplochromines
only.

lato. In the neighbor-joining tree, the Pseudocrenilabrus-lineage occupied the most ancestral branch in the haplochromines sensu lato, followed by the Congolese/SouthAfrican clade, the Astatoreochromis-lineage and the modern haplochromines. A Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [19]
revealed that there are no significant differences between
the topologies obtained with the different algorithms (P <
0.05). Similarly, in the four-cluster likelihood mapping
analysis [20] none of the three possible alternative
branching orders among the four main lineages of the
haplochromines sensu lato received support greater than
50%.
The dating of the major cladogenetic events (Fig. 4) found
an age of 2.4 MYA (1.22 – 4.02 MYA) for the most recent
common ancestor of the four lineages of haplochromines,
and about 1.8 MYA (0.66 – 3.78 MYA) for the most recent
common ancestor of the modern haplochromines. This
latter value was smaller in all resampling replications
pointing to a younger age of the modern haplochromines
compared to the remaining three lineages of haplochromines sensu lato. The most recent common ancestor
in the CSA-clade was estimated to have lived about 2.0
MYA (1.15 – 3.89 MYA), the split of the CSA lineage from
the common ancestor with the Pseudocrenilabrus-, Astatoreochromis-, and modern haplochromine lineage was dated
to about 2.4 MYA (1.22 MYA – 4.02 MYA). The test for
shifts in the probabilities of speciation in the haplochromines sensu lato according to [21] suggested increased
rates of lineage diversification (pc < 0.01) along three
branches in the maximum likelihood, the Bayesian inference and the neighbor-joining trees: (i) the branch leading to Astatoreochromis-lineage plus the modern
haplochromines; (ii) the branch leading to the modern
haplochromines; and (iii) the branch leading to the LV
region superflock (see Fig. 4c for the maximum likelihood
tree). In the maximum parsimony strict consensus tree an
increased rate of lineage diversification was found: (i) for
the branch leading to the modern haplochromines; and
(ii) for the branch leading to the LV region superflock.
The maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood character state reconstructions revealed that the characteristic
maternal mouthbrooding behavior, where only the
females incubate their fry in their buccal cavities, evolved
in the common ancestor of the CSA lineage, the Pseudocrenilabrus-, the Astatoreochromis-lineage, and the modern
haplochromines (see asterisk in Fig. 3). The true haplochromine-like egg-spots [10,22,23] are likely to have
evolved in the common ancestor of the Astatoreochromislineage and the modern haplochromines (Fig. 3). Some
members of the CSA lineage also show yellow or reddish
markings on their anal fin. However, these markings do
not represent real haplochromine-like egg-spots, which
are characterized by an inner yellow or orange ring and an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/17

outer transparent and colorless ring [10,22,23]. Instead,
the more homogenous markings seen in the CSA lineage
might be viewed as an intermediate character state in the
evolution of the species-specific egg-spots as found in the
Astatoreochromis-lineage and in the modern haplochromines. The mapping of riverine versus lacustrine lifestyle onto the maximum likelihood topology suggested
that the ancestor of the modern haplochromines was riverine (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Phylogeny and evolutionary origin of haplochromines
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data have a long
and successful history in the study of East African cichlid
evolution (see e.g., [1,4,9,17,24,25]). Limitations with
mtDNA have only been encountered when focusing on
the phylogeny among extremely closely related species
due to the possibility of the persistence of ancestral polymorphism (see e.g., [26]), or because of hybridization
events (see e.g., [27-29]). Nevertheless, mtDNA sequences
proved to be particularly suitable for the reconstruction of
the East African cichlid phylogeny at the tribal level and
for tribal assignments [9,15]; for phylogenetic reconstruction within older tribes [30,31]; and for phylogeographic
analyses [4,32]. Also, because of the extremely fast rate of
lineage formation in cichlids, nuclear and even some
mitochondrial genes [1] are too slowly evolving to contain phylogenetic information (reviewed in [6]).

The different phylogenetic algorithms, with which we
analyzed our data, revealed largely congruent results. In
all analyses, and in agreement with previous results [9],
we found that the Eretmodini are placed as sister group to
the substrate spawning Lamprologini – with an estimated
number of up to 100 species the most species-rich tribe in
LT – plus several LT tribes and all haplochromine representatives (see Fig. 3 for the maximum likelihood tree).
The molecular phylogenies thus corroborate that all haplochromines are ultimately derived from LT cichlids and
that their ancestor(s) are likely to have left LT secondarily.
We consider all species that belong to the monophyletic
group descending from this ancestor (asterisk in Fig. 3), to
being haplochromines sensu lato. These are further divided
into four distinct groups, a Congolese/Southern African
lineage (CSA), the genera Pseudocrenilabrus (Ps.) and Astatoreochromis (As.), and the modern haplochromines
(MH). While the respective monophyly of these four lineages was supported by high bootstrap values and Bayesian
posterior probabilities, our analyses could not unambiguously resolve the exact relationships between these four
lineages [maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference
(see Fig. 3): (CSA, (Ps., (As., (MH)))); maximum parsimony: (As., ((Ps., CSA), (MH))); neighbor joining: (Ps.,
(CSA, (As., (MH))))]. An evaluation of these alternative

The "out of Tanganyika" scenario of haplochromine evolution in Africa
The "out of Tanganyika" scenario of haplochromine evolution in Africa. (a) Several haplochromine lineages independently left Lake Tanganyika and colonized large parts of Africa via past and present river connections. Some of these lineages seeded cichlid radiations in distant lakes. The phylogeographic scenario is in agreement with palaeo-geological
reconstructions of the evolution of the East African Rift region. LT is the oldest of the rift lakes. Its central basin began to form
between 9 and 12 MYA, the northern (8-7 MYA) and the southern basin (2–4 MYA) began to fill at later periods [76]; deepwater conditions exist since about 5–6 MYA [78]. LM (2–4 MYA) and LV (750,000 years) are considerably younger. (b) Proposed
lake level of Lake Tanganyika during the last four million years [76, 77, 79] indicating major low- and high-stands. (c) Chronogram of the haplochromine evolution in Africa as reconstructed with r8s [72, 73] based on the maximum likelihood topology.
The size of each clade represents its species number. The modern haplochromines are a recent and rapidly speciating lineage.
Our molecular clock calibration suggested about 2 MYA (1.15 – 3.89 MYA) for the most recent common ancestor in the Congolese/Southern African lineage and ca. 2.4 MYA (1.22 – 4.02 MYA) for their split from the common ancestor with the Pseudocrenilabrus-, Astatoreochromis-, and modern haplochromine lineage. This lies in the range of the proposed high lake-level stand of
LT between the minima at 3.5 MYA and 1.1 MYA (650–700 m below present level) [76, 77] making an overflow through the
Lukuga valley possible, thus opening the connection between LT and the Congo drainage. The asterisks mark nodes with a significant burst of lineage diversification (pc < 0.01) [21]. Aa... Astatoreochromis alluaudi, CSA... Congolese/South African lineage,

Figure 5
Maximum parsimony reconstruction of habitat type
Maximum parsimony reconstruction of habitat type (lake versus river) using MacClade (the maximum likelihood reconstruction with Mesquite revealed analogous results) based on the maximum likelihood topology (see Fig. 3). The ancestor of
the modern haplochromines (marked by a circle) is likely to have been a riverine species. This implies that also the Tanganyikan
Tropheini originated from a riverine ancestor and re-colonized the lake where they presently form an abundant group in the
rocky littoral zones.

hypotheses by means of a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [19]
and a four-cluster likelihood mapping analysis [20]
indicated that none of these alternative branching orders
receives significantly more support than the others. This
suggests that the four lineages of the haplochromines
sensu lato evolved almost contemporaneously from a common ancestor. This is further supported by the observation of relatively short branches interrelating these four
lineages and the generally low bootstrap values and
Bayesian posterior probabilities supporting the corresponding relationships proposed by the different
algorithms.
The CSA lineage is composed of several widespread and
moderately species-rich groups of the Congo drainage and

Southern Africa and consists of two main clades: A clade
with a species from the Congo drainage (Ctenochromis
oligacanthus) ancestral to Southern African genera (Serranochromis, Sargochromis, Pharyngochromis) was resolved as
sister group to a clade comprised by solely Congo drainage taxa (Orthochromis, Haplochromis sp. nov., Cyclopharynx
and Thoracochromis). Within the Pseudocrenilabrus- and
Astatoreochromis-clades, branch lengths were relatively
short and a more detailed phylogeographic sampling
would be necessary to resolve the relationships between
the different geographic lineages.
The modern haplochromines consist of species flocks of
an unparalleled diversity. They include the endemic LT
tribe Tropheini (~25 species) sister-group to a clade

Page 8 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:17

comprised by the entire species flock of LM (~1,000 species) and several East African riverine and lacustrine lineages (~200 species) plus the LV region superflock (~600
species). With approximately 1,800 species this – here
phylogenetically defined – monophyletic lineage makes
up about 7% of all known teleost fish.
Astatotilapia, Thorachochromis, and Orthochromis
are polyphyletic genera
Our phylogenies show that several genera are in fact
polyphyletic, and major taxonomic revisions will be
required in the future to take our phylogenetic results into
consideration. For example, and in agreement with previous studies (see e.g., [4,14,33]), Astatotilapia emerges as
polyphyletic genus, with representatives assigned to both
the East African riverine clade in the modern haplochromines and the LV region superflock.

The genus Thoracochromis, represented in our analysis by
T. brauschi, has also been shown to be polyphyletic before
[14], with T. brauschi from the Congo drainage as a more
ancestral lineage, and T. petronius and T. pharyngealis from
the Nile drainage with affinities to the LV region superflock (note that the Nile River Thoracochromis of [14] are
consequently listed as Haplochromis in [34]). The placement of T. brauschi as sistergroup to T. petronius and T.
pharyngealis plus the remaining representatives of the LV
region superflock in the AFLP based phylogeny of [14]
seems to contradict our mtDNA based results in which T.
brauschi was identified as member of the CSA lineage.
However, the reported branching order did not receive
considerable bootstrap support in [14]. Also, the choice of
Astatoreochromis alluaudi (mislabeled as Astatotilapia alluaudi in [14]) as single outgroup species seems problematic, as our present analyses (see above) and former results
[4] indicate that A. alluaudi and not T. brauschi is more
closely related to the modern haplochromines (and, thus,
also to the LV region superflock). Further analyses including nuclear DNA sequence data and more taxa assigned to
the genus will be necessary to address this problem.
Based on the phylogeny it is apparent that the
Orthochromis lineage, which is confined to the Malagarasi
River system and two isolated rivers, East of LT [35], is not
part of the radiation of haplochromine cichlids. This is
further supported by the breeding behavior of these fish:
While the Malagarasi River Orthochromis are biparental
caregivers [35], the haplochromines sensu lato are all
maternal mouthbrooders. Thus, the Orthochromis-species
from the Malagarasi area, a group of exclusively riverine
fish, should be placed into its own tribe. The name
Orthochromis is, however, also used for riverine species
from the Congo drainage. In our analyses, Orthochromis
polyacanthus and O. stormsi from the Congo River system
fall – according to their distribution – into the CSA-clade

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/17

leaving also the genus Orthochromis polyphyletic (see also
[9]). We suggest to using Orthochromis for the CSA lineage
representatives, since O. polyacanthus was the first species
of the genus to be described [36], and Schwetzochromini
(as tribe name) and Schwetzochromis (as genus name) for
the Malagarasi area species, since this name was repeatedly used for some species of that complex (see e.g.,
[9,34,35]).
Phylogeography and phylochronology
We note that the application of a molecular clock for estimating divergence times has the potential of not being
without problems for several reasons (see e.g., [37,38]).
However, a molecular-clock-based time estimate does
surely provide an approximate framework for phylogeographic inferences. Our phylogeographic scenario (Fig.
4a), which is derived from the maximum likelihood phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses, suggests that several lineages independently left LT to colonize
surrounding river systems and consequently other lakes in
East Africa. The molecular clock calibration based on the
chronogram generated with r8s [39] (Fig. 4b,c) yielded
about 2.4 MYA (1.22 – 4.02 MYA) for the split of the CSA
lineage from the common ancestor of the haplochromines sensu lato, and about 2 MYA (1.15 – 3.89 MYA)
for the first branching events within the CSA clade. The
spread of Congo drainage taxa into southern river systems
occurred at a later stage, most likely at the relatively shallow watershed between upper branches of the Congo
River and the Zambezi River – a scenario that is also supported by the placement of Serranochromis sp. (from Lake
Mweru in the upper Congo) as sister group to the Zambezi/Southern African genera Sargochromis and Pharyngochromis in our phylogenies. However, further sampling in
that area would be necessary to reconstruct the southward
spread of the CSA lineage.

At essentially the same time as the CSA lineage, the ancestors of the Pseudocrenilabrus- and the Astatoreochromis-lineage diverged from their common ancestor. Despite their
large distributional ranges – they also colonized the LV
(both lineages) and LM (Pseudocrenilabrus) region – the
genera Astatoreochromis and Pseudocrenilabrus never underwent considerable speciation. The three described Astatoreochromis species occur in the LV region including Lakes
Edward and George (A. alluaudi), in the rivers Rusizi and
Lukuga (A. straeleni), and in the Malagarasi River (A.
vanderhorsti). The three species of Pseudocrenilabrus occur
from the Nile system to the LV region (P. multicolor), in
Eastern- and Southern Africa including LM (P. philander),
and in the central Congo basin (P. nicholsi). All analyzed
representatives are relatively closely related suggesting a
recent spread of these lineages in East Africa. However, we
did not include P. nicholsi, which is morphologically different from P. multicolor and P. philander and would – if it

really belonged to the Pseudocrenilabrus-lineage – represent the only haplochromine in the Congo drainage that
is not a member of the CSA lineage.
The most recent common ancestor of the modern haplochromines was dated to have existed about 1.8 MYA (0.66
– 3.78 MYA) (Fig. 4). This ancestral lineage forms the crucial phylogenetic and biogeographic link between the species flocks of all three East African Great Lakes, and its
discovery documents the existence of much earlier
hypothesized fish-accessible waterways between these
waterbodies [40,41]. Apparently, the Malagarasi River
(and possibly the Rusizi) played a major role for the dispersal of these fishes, since many modern haplochromine
lineages occur in these drainages and in lakes South-Eastern and North of LT exclusively, which argues against the
view that LM haplochromines originated from Zambezi
River stocks [41]. Whether or not Lake Rukwa has ever
acted as link between the faunas of LT and LM [41] cannot
be answered by our data. Lake Rukwa seems to have overflowed at its maximum levels into LT several times. However, Lake Rukwa has also become very shallow in recent
geological times and it might have dried up completely
[41] eradicating its original fauna. At present, Lake Rukwa
harbors haplochromines that belong to the East-African
riverine clade in Figs. 2, 3[4,25].
Our analyses also recovered another closely related lineage to the LV region superflock in the East-African riverine
clade, in addition to Haplochromis gracilior form Lake Kivu
[4]. This lineage includes H. paludinosus that occurs in the
Malagarasi (which was already suggested by [33]), as well
as undescribed species from Tanzania and Lake Edward
(Figs. 2, 3). It is, however, unclear by which waterway haplochromine cichlids once colonized Lake Kivu. The flow
of the Rusizi, presently from Lake Kivu into LT with the
Panzi falls as strong barrier for fish migration, might actually have been reversed before the uplift of the Virunga
volcanoes north of Lake Kivu as suggested by deposits of
fossil LT mollusks and fluviatile sands in the upper Rusizi
valley [41,42]. This connection could possibly explain
how haplochromines of LT origin were able to colonize
Lake Kivu about 1.5 million years ago (Fig. 4).
Evolutionary key-innovations of haplochromines
One of only few synapomorphies of the haplochromines
sensu lato is the particular type of cranial apophysis for the
upper pharyngeal bones [12]. The distinctive organization
of the pharyngeal apophysis, a second set of jaws that is
functionally decoupled from the oral ones [43], is characteristic to all cichlids and has been interpreted as prominent feature that – because of its adaptability –
contributes to the cichlids' evolutionary success
[2,3,10,43]. It is, however, not evident how the relatively
minor morphological modification of part of that struc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/17

ture in the haplochromines [12] might function as an evolutionary key-innovation. Interestingly, however, all
haplochromines sensu lato are maternal mouthbrooders
with the females alone incubating the eggs in their buccal
cavities [10,12]. Mouthbrooding, which is regarded as an
adaptation to predation pressure [44-46], has evolved several times independently and in diverse behavioral modes
in cichlids [10,22,47,48]. The characteristic maternal
mouthbrooding behavior displayed by haplochromines is
believed to being a derived character state [35,46,47].
Mouthbrooding strongly limits the number of eggs and
fry that can be raised and might have led to generally
much smaller population sizes, which has, for example,
population genetic implications on fixation of alleles, and
might result in smaller effective population sizes. Furthermore, mouthbrooding species may be considered to being
promising colonizers of new habitats, since only a single
mouthbrooding female is necessary for the founding of a
new population.
An eminent feature of several female mouthbrooding
cichlid genera is the occurrence of egg-spots on the anal
fins of males. In some species also females show such
ovoid markings, but these are smaller and much less conspicuous than in males. Also, some species of the modern
haplochromines, e.g., some deep-water lineages of LM,
have lost their egg-spots secondarily. In mimicking real
eggs to attract females, these egg-spots function as natural
releasers [22,23], or intra-specific sexual advertisement
[44], apparently serving to ensure a greater fertilization
success of the eggs by bringing about greater proximity of
the female's mouth to the male's genital opening. Based
on the molecular phylogeny, we could trace the origin of
the characteristic egg-spots (ocelli) [10,23] to the common
ancestor of the Astatoreochromis-lineage and the modern
haplochromines. There are other cichlid species in which
males display yellow or red marks on their pelvic, dorsal
or anal fins, but only in these lineages true egg-spots on
the males' anal fins with a yellow, orange or red center and
a colorless/transparent outer ring [10,22] are found. Interestingly, the branch leading to the Astatoreochromis-lineage
and the modern haplochromines is the one with a pronounced potential for an increased rate of speciation (see
Fig. 4c). Based on the character state reconstructions (Fig.
5) it seems likely that this ancestor was riverine. Thus, it
may be concluded that the egg-spots first evolved in a haplochromine cichlid that inhabited a turbid riverine environment, where these conspicuous markings would seem
to be particularly effective and necessary for intra-specific
communication.
Another innovation that further distinguishes the exceptionally species-rich modern haplochromines from all
other cichlids is the occurrence of numerous color
morphs, often accompanied by sexual color dimorphism.

Inter- and intra-specific polychromatism combined with
maternal mouthbrooding involving egg-spots as releasers
can be hypothesized to being permissive for sexual selection through female choice and, hence, the
haplochromines' propensity for species formation, as sexual selection is probably a major causal factor in the origin
of isolating mechanisms and the maintenance of reproductive isolation [18,49-53]. These distinctive features of
the modern haplochromines, that have arisen just in their
ancestor, in combination with the numerous ecological
niches that are provided by the large East African lakes
might thus have induced a considerable increase of the
haplochromines' evolutionary potential. The importance
of large waterbodies for the evolution of the modern haplochromines is reflected by the fact that these cichlids only
radiated in lakes (and species number rather correlates to
the size, but not to the age, of a lake), whereas the riverine
lineages are all species-poor albeit often widespread (Figs.
1, 3).
Replicate adaptive radiations of the 'modern
haplochromines'
A common feature of many adaptive radiations is that
their founders are believed to have had a more generalist's
lifestyle, while adaptive radiations themselves are defined
by being composed of highly specialized species with narrower niche widths [54,55]. Theory predicts that generalists more likely have better dispersal abilities and are
expected to be able to adapt readily to novel environmental settings [55]. A generalist ancestor scenario fits well
with the diversification of haplochromine cichlids. Generalist riverine species of the genera Astatoreochromis, Astatotilapia, Pseudocrenilabrus, and Haplochromis (e.g., bloyeti),
are ancestral to the adaptive radiations of the Tropheini of
LT, and/or the radiations of LM and the LV region superflock. These genera are widely distributed and not confined to Eastern Africa, and they are the only ones that
could inhabit the waterways that – over geological time
spans – connected the lakes of Eastern Africa.

The phylogeny presented here (Fig. 3) reveals that modern
haplochromines gave rise to several major adaptive radiations; the most prominent ones are those of LM and LV.
Interestingly, it uncovers that also the radiation of the
Tropheini from LT [30] must now be considered as an
additional radiation of the modern haplochromines, corroborating the much older perception that LT accommodates several independent species flocks [56]. It is further
suggested by mapping the fishes' lifestyle onto our molecular phylogeny that the highly specialized Tropheini are
descendents of a river-living species. This implies that the
ancestor of the Tropheini successfully re-entered the lake
habitat and evolved into the presently dominant group in
the rocky littoral zone of LT. Thus, this lineage of modern
haplochromines managed to occupy "empty niches" in an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/17

apparently "full" ecosystem, as all remaining tribes, which
now account for about 200 species, had already been
established when the ancestor of the Tropheini secondarily entered LT (Figs. 2, 3). The observation that these fish
underwent an independent adaptive radiation in LT
underlines the haplochromines' propensity for
speciation.
In an apparent contrast to most other known examples of
adaptive radiations [55] is the finding that the generalist
ancestors of the haplochromine species flocks were
derived from already highly diverse and specialized LT
endemics (Fig. 3). Therefore, specialization may not be an
"evolutionary one-way street", but rather some lineages
have reversed their level of specialization, i.e., generalists
arose from highly specialized lineages, yet, apparently
retained their high propensity for speciation and level of
evolvability (see [57]). The faunal revolution of LT's radiation of cichlids was thus not confined to the lake habitat
itself (see also [8,9,58]), but it effectively involved large
parts of Africa via the intermediate step of repeatedly
evolving generalist riverine lineages – in much the same
way as the adaptive radiation in LV produced haplochromine species that secondarily colonized surrounding
rivers [4].
Our phylogeny of haplochromines provides strong support for replicate adaptive radiations in East African cichlids. The concept of replicate radiations, in which the
same sequence of adaptations to ecological niches
evolved repeatedly in lineages that inhabit similar environments, has been developed based on sympatric species
pairs of fishes in postglacial lakes and on the Anolis lizard
ecomorphs on different islands of the Greater Antilles [5961]. Our inclusive phylogenetic and phylogeographic
study shows that similar ecological types of cichlids in the
different East African lakes evolved independently (see
also [2,17]), yet it also shows that the convergent ecotypes
in the species flocks of LM, LV, Lake Kivu as well as in the
Tropheini [2,10,12,13,17] arose from the same ancestral
phenotype in the ancestor of the modern haplochromines. We suggest that a combination of behavioral
(maternal mouthbrooding) and morphological innovations (egg-spots, color polymorphisms, pronounced sexual dichromatism) as well as ecological opportunities
(after the colonization of large lakes) might have predestined this particular lineage to give rise to these replicate
adaptive radiations.
It has been noted before that lineages of LT origin have left
the lake secondarily (there are, for example, about five
lamprologine species that are found in the Congo and
Malagarasi Rivers) [9,58]. Here, we show that the entire
haplochromine diversity has its origin in LT corroborating
the view that ancient lakes not only preserve biodiversity

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:17

but also act as biodiversity hotspots, genetic reservoirs and
cradles from which new lineages evolve [4,8,9]. What
remains to be answered is where the LT cichlids originated
and to what extent a proposed and meanwhile desiccated
Pliocene lake in the Congo plains [41,42] was the source
of the ancient LT lineages, pushing back even further the
onset of replicate adaptive radiations in East African
cichlids.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/17

Sample preparation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification and DNA sequencing have been performed
as described elsewhere [9] for both mitochondrial DNA
segments the complete non-coding control region and the
entire NADH Dehydrogenase Subunit II (ND2) gene.
Forward and reverse sequences have been assembled
using the computer programs Sequence Navigator
(Applied Biosystems, USA) and Sequencher (GenCodes,
USA).

Conclusion
Our phylogenetic analyses that include representatives of
all major haplochromine lineages show that all haplochromines are derived from Lake Tanganyika cichlids.
While the Orthochromis species of the Malagarasi area
apparently do not belong to the radiation of the haplochromine cichlids and should be placed into a new tribe,
we defined four new lineages within the haplochromines
sensu lato: A clade combining Congolese and South-African genera (CSA-lineage), the Pseudocrenilabrus-, the Astatoreochromis-lineage, and the exceptionally species-rich
modern haplochromines. The ca. 1,800 species of modern
haplochromines are comprised of the entire haplochromine species flocks of Lake Malawi and the Lake Victoria region, some 200 riverine and lacustrine species, as
well as the Tanganyikan Tropheini, which are likely to
have evolved from a riverine ancestor and secondarily colonized Lake Tanganyika. This proposed "out of Tanganyika" scenario of haplochromine evolution is in
agreement with the geological and palaeo-geological history of East Africa. Based on a character-state reconstruction from this new phylogeny, we were able to discover
the evolution of several key-innovations that arose in the
lineage leading to the modern haplochromines. These
character reconstructions suggest that a combination of
behavioral (maternal mouthbrooding) and morphological characteristics (egg-spots, color polymorphisms, pronounced sexual dichromatism) as well as ecological
opportunities (after the colonization of large lakes) might
have predestined this particular lineage to give rise to replicate adaptive radiations and, therefore, be causally
related to the extraordinary success of these particular
cichlid fish radiations.

Methods
Specimen information and DNA methods
For this study, a total of 304 specimens were analyzed. We
combined all available GenBank entries from previous
studies [4,9,15,25,62] with 180 newly determined DNA
sequences. Table 1 [see Additional file 1] lists specimen
information, geographic origin of the specimens, names
of collectors, and GenBank accession numbers. When
available, voucher specimens have been deposited at the
Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, Belgium.

Phylogenetic reconstruction and hypotheses testing
The complete sequences of the mitochondrial control
region (895 bp) and the ND2 gene (1,047 bp) were
aligned using the computer program Clustal W [63];
alignments have been further adjusted by eye. Up to 34
gaps had to be included in the control region alignment,
which were coded as indels. Due to missing data on the 5'end of the control region in about one quarter of the taxa,
a terminal section of 34 bp has been excluded from the
phylogenetic analysis, leading to an alignment of 1,908
bp for the combined dataset.

For phylogenetic reconstruction we performed maximum
likelihood, maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining
methods in parallel using the computer program PAUP*
4.0b10 [64]. Two taxa belonging to tilapiine cichlids were
included as outgroup based on previous phylogenetic
analyses using mitochondrial DNA [9,15,16], nuclear
DNA [65] and SINE insertion patterns [66,67] demonstrating that the Tilapia-lineages are ancestral to all
remaining LT tribes (but excluding Tylochromis, which is
ancestral to the Tilapiini). We did not include representatives of three LT tribes – the Bathybatini, Trematocarini
and Tylochromini -, as these ancient lineages were shown
to have existed before the primary radiation of mouthbrooders in LT [9,15,67]. After an initial neighbor-joining
analysis including the control region sequences of all 304
specimens, we reduced the dataset to 100 taxa based on
the obtained topology. This reduction was necessary to
allow computational feasibility for maximum likelihood
and maximum parsimony analyses. The optimal model of
molecular evolution for the maximum likelihood analysis
was determined in a likelihood-ratio test running the
computer program Modeltest v3.06 [68]. For the heuristic
maximum likelihood search of the combined dataset we
used the general-time-reversible model of molecular evolution, with a gamma shape parameter of 0.7937 and a
proportion of invariable sites of 0.3426. Due to the many
closely related taxa in the dataset, maximum parsimony
analyses were completed for 1010 rearrangements. For
neighbor joining, we used the HKY model and conducted
a bootstrap analysis with 5,000 replicates. Bootstrap
analyses for maximum likelihood were performed with
100 replicates and for maximum parsimony with 1,000
replicates. We also applied Bayesian inference of

phylogeny with Mr. Bayes 3.0b4 [69] running four
Metropolis Coupled Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chains in parallel for 250.000 generations, using the general-timereversible model with gamma correction (six types of substitutions), and excluding 5 % of the trees as burn-in. The
obtained topologies from the different phylogenetic algorithms were evaluated by means of a nonparametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [19] under a resamplingestimated log-likelihood as implemented in PAUP* [64].
To estimate the support for distinct internal branches critical for our interpretations, we performed a four-cluster
likelihood mapping analysis with the program PUZZLE
5.0 [20,70] in which we grouped the taxa of the haplochromines sensu lato into four groups according to the
four lineages that were recovered from the phylogenetic
analyses (CSA-, Pseudocrenilabrus-, Astatoreochromis-lineage, and modern haplochromines).

available at periods of high lake level stands only. The
Lukuga channel, the only outlet of LT, was dry when first
seen in 1874 by Cameron, but four years later the lake
overflowed. Since then, the Lukuga was repeatedly
flooded. Intermittent connections with the Congo River
system in the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene were suggested on the basis of large lake level fluctuations in LT
during periods with increased precipitation [41,76-79].
The resulting molecular clock rate fits well with previously
used rates in East African cichlids [4,75].

To test whether or not shifts in the probabilities of speciation occurred on certain branches of the obtained phylogeny, we quantitatively tested the fit of this tree to a
Markovian null model in which the probability of speciation is equally distributed along branches. Therefore, we
calculated the cumulative probability pc [21] for relevant
branches based on the different trees. We then mapped
lifestyles (riverine versus lacustrine), breeding behavior,
and the occurrence of true egg-spots on the maximum
likelihood tree using MacClade 4.0 (Sinauer, Sunderland,
MA) for maximum parsimony character state reconstructions and Mesquite [71] for maximum likelihood reconstructions. To tentatively date the major cladogenetic
events in the haplochromines, we constructed a chronogram based on a maximum likelihood tree with constraint
molecular clock (see above for search parameters). Therefore, we used the computer program r8s [72] applying the
local molecular clock method and an optimization via the
truncated newton method [73]. Confidence intervals were
assessed by means of a bootstrap approach. We simulated
25 bootstrap matrices with Mesquite and, for each matrix,
constructed a maximum likelihood tree (general-timereversible model; model parameters, gamma shape correction and proportion of invariable sites being estimated
from each matrix; rearrangements limited to 1,000). The
resulting trees were then analyzed with r8s as described
above, and in addition with the minimum and maximum
values of geological datings separately, in order to define
upper and lower bounds. As calibration points, we used
an age estimate for the LM species flock of about one million years [74,75], the maximum age of 200.000 years for
the LV region superflock [1,4,25] as well as the time window for the Lukuga connection between LT and the
Congo system (between the minima at 3.5 MYA and 1.1
MYA) [76,77]. An escape of LT lineages into river systems
draining into the lake was possible at any time, whereas
the only connection to the Congo system, the Lukuga, was
