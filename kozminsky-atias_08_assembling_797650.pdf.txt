Abstract
Background: For survival, scorpions depend on a wide array of short neurotoxic polypeptides.
The venoms of scorpions from the most studied group, the Buthida, are a rich source of small, 23–
78 amino acid-long peptides, well packed by either three or four disulfide bridges that affect ion
channel function in excitable and non-excitable cells.
Results: In this work, by constructing a toxin transcripts data set from the venom gland of the
scorpion Buthus occitanus israelis, we were able to follow the evolutionary path leading to mature
toxin diversification and suggest a mechanism for leader peptide hyper-conservation. Toxins from
each family were more closely related to one another than to toxins from other species, implying
that fixation of duplicated genes followed speciation, suggesting early gene conversion events. Upon
fixation, the mature toxin-coding domain was subjected to diversifying selection resulting in a
significantly higher substitution rate that can be explained solely by diversifying selection. In
contrast to the mature peptide, the leader peptide sequence was hyper-conserved and
characterized by an atypical sub-neutral synonymous substitution rate. We interpret this as
resulting from purifying selection acting on both the peptide and, as reported here for the first time,
the DNA sequence, to create a toxin family-specific codon bias.
Conclusion: We thus propose that scorpion toxin genes were shaped by selective forces acting
at three levels, namely (1) diversifying the mature toxin, (2) conserving the leader peptide amino
acid sequence and intriguingly, (3) conserving the leader DNA sequences.

Background
The order Scorpiones constitutes one of the most ancient
groups of animals on earth (more than 400 million years
of evolution), represented today by approximately 1500
different species [1,2] which can be divided into four
groups. The venoms of scorpions from the most studied
group, the Buthida, are a rich source of small, 23–78
amino acid-long peptides, well packed by either three or

four disulfide bridges, that affect ion channel function in
excitable and non-excitable cells [1,2]. Typically, toxin
peptides contain a structural signature defined by the
presence of a cysteine-stabilized α/β motif, in which two
disulfide bridges covalently link a α-helical segment with
one strand of a β-sheet structure [3-5]. The dense core typically contains the sequence motifs, CXXXC and CXC
(where C stands for cysteine and X stands for any amino

acid residue), shown to be essentially conserved [1,2,6].
Toxins are mainly neurotoxic peptides, interacting specifically with various ionic channels (i.e. Na+, K+, Cl- and
Ca2+ channels). The Na+ channel toxins are gating modifiers that can be divided into two families, according to
their pharmacological effect: α- and β-toxins. α-toxins
bind in a voltage dependent mode and slow channel inactivation [7,8]. β-toxins bind to a separate site, independently of membrane potential, and shift the channel
activation to the hyperpolarizing direction [7,8]. β-toxins
can be further divided, according to their amino acid
sequence and selectivity, into "true" β, excitatory and
depressant toxins. As opposed to all others, the excitatory
and depressant toxins are not toxic to mammals. Short
chain toxins form a large family of peptides that block K+
or Cl- channels [5,9].
Within each toxin family, the amino acid sequence of the
leader peptide is conserved, while the mature toxin-coding domain displays hyper-diversification, especially in
those residues exposed to the surface of the molecule and
which affect toxin activity [2,10]. These characteristics (i.e.
conserved cysteine scaffold, conserved leader peptide and
hyper-variable mature toxin) are shared with toxic peptides from other animal orders, such as snakes and cone
snails [6,11,12]. In all these animals, evolution shows an
apparent preference for toxin-diversifying processes
[11,13].
Scorpions feed on insects, spiders and other small invertebrates. Consequently, scorpion venom contains toxins
which effectively paralyze this type of prey. The venom,
however, also serves a defensive function, and is, therefore, highly lethal to vertebrates, including mammals.
This has been suggested as the driving force for the apparently accelerated rate of evolution displayed by mature
toxins [14]. Although a number of studies have considered conopeptides and snake toxins from an evolutionary
perspective [11,13], thus far, the mechanisms leading to
accelerated evolution of scorpion toxins have not been
thoroughly addressed.
Accordingly, to study the evolution of scorpion toxin gene
families, in the present report we have unraveled the
venom gland content of the Israeli scorpion, Buthus occitanus israelis (Boi). In all identified toxin families, the
leader peptide sequences displayed remarkable conservation, owing to purifying selection forces aimed at conserving both the amino acid and nucleotide sequences, while
the mature toxin-coding sequences have undergone diversifying selection. These observations provided the unique
opportunity to study the evolutionary fate of gene families
simultaneously undergoing opposite selective pressures in
separate domains. The data obtained provide insight into
the evolutionary pathways leading to the diversification of
the mature toxin and imply the existence of a novel mech-

anism leading to family-specific leader peptide hyper-conservation.

Results
The venom gland contains a vast variety of neurotoxins
To study the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the
diversity of scorpion toxins, a database of all major transcripts expressed in the venom gland of the Israeli scorpion, B. occitanus israelis (Boi), was constructed. In
addition, a venom-gland based cDNA library was established. To increase the chances of identifying rare toxin
cDNA (i.e. frequency < 0.005), approximately 450 clones
were isolated and sequenced. To identify putative toxinencoding clones, translated cDNA sequences were first
compared to those of known toxins. Next, all other open
reading frames (ORFs) were inspected for the presence of
a putative leader sequence or a known cysteine-based pattern. This sequencing effort showed 78% of the clones to
have sequence attributes of toxins, leading these
sequences to be termed putative scorpion toxin cDNAs.
Of these, seventy two novel individual toxin-like transcripts were identified (GenBank accession numbers

relationships
FJ360768–FJ360843).
between the toxins cDNAs were examined by the construction of a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A) based on alignments of both cDNA and predicted protein sequences.
The Na+-channel toxin family and some of the K+-channel
toxins could be clearly dividable into distinct sub-families
on the basis of conserved elements present in the precursor sequences. Since the cDNA and protein trees presented
highly similar topologies, only the protein tree is shown
(Fig. 1A). As shown in figure 1B, over 50% of Boi toxin
sequences are predicted to be Na+ channel modifiers and
can be divided, by sequence similarity, into 4 sub-families
(Fig. 1B). The predicted K+ channel blockers comprise
28% of the total transcripts and can be divided into
numerous sub-types (Fig. 1B). This diverse toxin family is
characterized by its star-shaped phylogenetic tree pattern
(Fig. 1A). Four putative transcripts were predicted to
belong to the chlorotoxin-like family. Eight additional
ORF-containing putative transcripts, were identified as
possessing toxin-like characteristics, i.e. a leader sequence
and multiple cysteine residues, yet showed no similarity
to known toxins. All Boi toxin precursors possessed the
known two-domain structure, corresponding to the leader
and mature peptide regions [5,15,16].

Striking differences in the transcription levels of different
toxins could also be observed (Fig. 1C). Order-of-magnitude differences were observed between the relative
expression levels of different transcripts from the same
family, such as α-toxins, excitatory toxins as well as Cl-and K+-channel toxins. Seventy five percent of the transcripts had relatively low transcript representation (≤ 2
independently isolated clones). Whereas, on the other
hand, 5% of the transcripts had relatively high transcript

identity and BoiTx651 and BoiTx458, putative β-like toxins exhibiting 94.4% identity. The homologous pairs were
subjected to PCR amplification using primers designed to
identify both tested sequences. The templates for these
experiments were the genomic DNA of all 10 scorpions
from whence the cDNA library was generated. Individual
cDNA clones served as control. In addition, the homologous cDNA pairs were digested with restriction enzymes
directed against a recognition site found on only one of
the clones in each pair (i.e. NcoI, HindIII, and LweI for
pairs 1, 2 and 3, 4, respectively). Analysis of the amplification and restriction digestion products on agarose gel
revealed that gene pairs 2, 3 and 4 exhibited digestion of
only one partner of the pair in all 10 scorpions. On the
other hand, clone pair 1 (97% identity) exhibited a single
digestion pattern (i.e. heterozygous) in some individuals
or no digestion at all in others. This digestion pattern
implies that the BoiTx1 and BoiTx260 transcripts (i.e. pair
1) represent allelic variants of the same transcript, while
all other sequences most likely correspond to separate
genes.

Toxin families are highlighted according to their estimated
blocking targets, i.e. Na+, K+, Cl- or Ca2+ channels, based on

known homologs were termed 'other toxins'. Only fulllength distinct cDNA sequences were used for the protein

representation (≥ 10 clones). Hence, related scorpion toxins may be expressed at vastly different levels in the
venom gland.
Are similar cDNA transcripts distinct genes or allelic
variants?
Since the cDNA library was constructed from the pooled
RNA from 10 different individuals, it was imperative to
assess whether the observed transcript variety constituted
the presence of multiple genes or was an outcome of the
sample containing a much smaller number of multi-allele
genes. To this end, all homologous transcript pairs with a
percent identity of greater than 90% were studied. These
correspond to four homologous cDNA pairs, namely:
BoiTx1 and BoiTx260, putative K+ channel toxins exhibiting 97% identity; BoiTx492 and BoiTx475, putative
depressant toxins exhibiting 92.8% identity; BoiTx611
and BoiTx357, putative Cl- channel toxins exhibiting 99%

Toxin divergence occurred after speciation
An attempt to decipher the relative time frame in which
gene duplication events led to toxin divergence was next
undertaken. At this point in time, a transcript dataset of
the venom gland content from only a single scorpion species, namely Buthus martensi Karsch (BmK), gradually
obtained over the course of the last few years [16], was
available. cDNA sequences coding for the depressant
toxin families from the two scorpions, i.e. Boi and BmK,
were thus aligned and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, most sequences in both
families are more similar to others from the same species
than to any of the sequences of the other species. Similar
pattern was observed for the α-toxin family (not shown).
If speciation was linked only to the evolution of the
mature toxin one would expect the disappearance of the
segregation when only the leader-coding sequence is considered. When examining separately the phylogenetic
trees of the mature and the leader-coding domains (Fig.
2B, C), the leader-coding domain seemed to segregate
even earlier than the mature toxin-coding domain. This
will be further elucidated in the Discussion. Thus, these
data can be interpreted as indicating that the two species
diverged from a common progenitor before the duplication and diversification of toxins from the two families
had occurred.
Leader peptide conservation and mature toxin hyperdiversification
A high diversification of the mature toxin amino acid
sequence was observed in several toxin families from cone
snail and snake species [11,17-20]. To assess whether this
pattern also held true for Boi, the most distinct toxin family, i.e. the depressant toxins, was first examined. The

entire pool of coded peptides was aligned and is displayed
according to the degree of conservation, as determine by
Jalview (Fig. 3A). Such sequence alignment revealed high
conservation of the leader domain, as opposed to the
hyper-diversification of the mature domain. As expected,
some highly conserved regions, such as those containing
cysteine residues and other structurally important residues, were found within the hyper-diverse mature
domain.
To examine whether other toxin families (e.g. α-, β-like
and Cl- channel toxins) possess the same pattern of conservation versus hyper-diversification, an unrooted neighbor-joining tree diagram of the different domains was
plotted (Fig. 3B). While segregation of the different gene
families is clearly observed in the leader domain (Fig. 3B,
left plot), most transcripts diverge directly from the origin
of the mature domain tree (Fig. 3B, right plot). The tight
cluster of the leader domain tree, versus the star-like shape
of the mature domain tree, demonstrates that the same
pattern of conserved leader and diverse mature peptide
sequence exists in all of the distinctive toxin families.
These data thus demonstrate that scorpion toxins gene
families can be defined primarily on the basis of their
highly conserved leader domains, in combination with
distinctly conserved cysteine patterns, as was previously
suggested for other scorpion species [16].
The toxin gene domains experience opposite selective
patterns
Positive selection has been suggested as playing a decisive
role in the diversification of mature toxins in gene families
of cone snails, snakes and scorpions [11,13,17,19,21-23].
Accordingly, it was hypothesized that in scorpions, selection could underlie both hyper-diversification of the
mature toxin and conservation of the toxin leader
domain. Therefore, the number of synonymous (dS) and
non-synonymous (dN) substitutions per site in the toxin
sequences, was assessed. Such analysis was performed on
the two main toxin families identified within Boi venom
gland, namely the α- and depressant toxin families. dN/dS
values of 0.6 to 1.0 are indicative of neutral selection
forces. Using the MEC model [24], the majority (55%) of
the mature domain residues showed very strong positive
selection, with 34% being under very strong negative
selection and only 11% revealing a pattern interpreted as
neutral selection. A similar degree of positive selection
was found in both the Boi and BmK α-toxin families (not
shown). Atypically, the degree of diversification within
the BmK depressant toxin family was significantly low,
leading to a small number of positively selected sites
within the mature toxin sequence. This could be a result
of a partial representation of the full variety of this specific
toxin family in the databases and/or an indication of unusual evolutionary forces. Opposite to the mature toxin res-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/333

idues, the majority of the leader domain residues showed
very strong (62%) negative selection, with only 5% being
under the effect of positive selection forces and 33% being
neutrally selected. The same pattern was obtained by the
more promiscuous M5 and M8 models (p < 0.001) for
both the depressant and α-toxin families (not shown). To
establish the correlation between synonymous substitution rates and dN/dS ratios, DNAsp software was utilized.
Again, the majority of the leader data points (Fig. 4B, left
plot) argue in favor of a purifying selection (dN/dS < 0.6),
while the majority of the mature domain data points (Fig.
4B, right plot) are indicative of diversifying selection (dN/
dS>1). In addition, an apparent decrease in the synonymous mutation rate within the leader domain was
observed, in comparison to the rate observed within the
mature toxin (Fig. 4B) and will be discussed in the following sections.
Apparent position-specific codon conservation in strong
negatively-selected sites
Positions in the mature peptide that experience purifying
selection not only show a strong conservation of the
amino acid but also a position-specific codon conservation pattern. This phenomenon was observed within the
depressant toxins family (Fig. 5), as well as in other families (not shown). Codon conservation appears not to be a
consequence of codon usage bias as different codons are
conserved at different positions. For example, for the
cysteine at positions 3, 5 and 6, the conserved codon is
TGT, while at all other cysteine-coding positions, the TGC
codon is conserved (Fig. 5). In addition, analysis of the
entire Boi transcript data set and assessment of codon
abundance shows that the conserved codon is often not
the most abundant codon in the transcript library.
Nucleotide diversity is greater within the mature toxincoding domain than in other gene domains
Selective forces are expected to impose a higher substitution rate per site within the mature-coding domain than
within the leader sequence. Indeed, when analyzing the
depressant toxin gene family by the Jukes and Cantor
parameter model [25], more than 3-fold higher nucleotide diversity was observed within the mature-coding
domain than in the other coding and non-coding
domains (Fig. 6A). This pattern was repeated when analyzing the depressant toxin gene family from BmK and the
α-toxins gene family from Boi.

Can this difference in substitution rates between the
leader and the mature domains be attributed solely to the
influence of selective forces? To assess this possibility, the
nucleotide sequences of all Boi depressant toxin introns
were isolated and determined. One of the depressant toxins genes lacked an intron. All other genes possess a 298
to 327 bp-long intron, located near the 3' end of the
leader-coding sequence, at a position similar to other

scorpion toxins genes [26,27]. This intron domain is
thought to reflect a neutral nucleotide mutation-fixation
rate. Indeed, Boi toxin intron nucleotide diversity exceeds
that of the leader-coding domain but is much lower than
that of the mature toxin coding domain (Fig. 6A, B). To
assess the neutral substitution rates affecting the coding
domains while eliminating the effects of protein-shaping
selective forces, the substitution rates per site in the wobble (3rd codon) position of the negatively-selected sites

were determined (Fig. 6A). The neutral substitution rate
within the mature toxin coding region was similar to that
of the intron. On the other hand, the neutral substitution
rate within the leader-coding region was significantly (~2fold) lower (Fig. 6A). This can be interpreted as an indication of a decrease in the synonymous substitution rate
and of position-specific codon bias in the leader-coding
domain.

Transition preference in the leader toxin coding domain
We further characterized Boi's toxin genes dataset by
examining the transversion/transition (Tv/Ts) ratios in
depressant and α-toxins. We found a two-fold excess of
transitions in the leader sequence in comparison with that
of the mature-coding domain (Fig. 6C). To ascertain the
neutrally selected Tv/Ts ratio, we examine this ratio within
the intron region. The Tv/Ts ratio of the mature-coding
domain was very similar to that of the intron while the
leader was found to be under a strong transition bias.

Discussion
Scorpion venoms have evolved during the last 400 million years to constitute an arsenal of high affinity ion
channel modulators. Here, we investigated evolutionary
pathways leading to the establishment of this pharmaco-

logical wealth by constructing and analyzing a Boi toxin
cDNA library. The cDNA library transcripts exemplify the
tremendous variety of toxin genes prevalent in an old
world scorpion. The apparent hyper-diversity within each
toxin family could be explained, in part, by the presence
of multiple alleles per gene. Our comparison of genomic
DNA versus cDNA sequences in several scorpion individuals indicates that in all but one of the cDNA clone pairs,
diversity is not likely to reflect allelic variants but rather
the existence of distinct genes. The degree of diversification within the different toxin families was versatile. Boi
putative K+ channel blockers are much more diverse than
Na+ channel modifiers, within the same activity sub-type
(i.e. depressant, excitatory, α- and β-toxins) (Fig. 1A). We
thus speculate that the high divergence of K+ channel toxins is due to the higher variance in possible targets (e.g.

mammals have ~10-fold more K+ channel sub-types than
Na+ channels).
Gene duplications upon speciation
The number of toxin genes in a single scorpion species
indicates that several gene duplications occurred during
scorpion evolution. Gene duplication is typically a consequence of unequal crossing-over, retro-positioning or

chromosomal duplication [28]. In another species, the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis, it was recently suggested
that toxin gene duplication was achieved by unequal
crossing-over [29]. Although most scorpion toxin genes
could have arisen via gene duplication, we have identified
here, for the first time, a Boi depressant gene lacking the
conserved intron located within the leader sequence coding domain. This molecular feature is indicative of the

retro-positioning which occurs when an mRNA is retrotranscribed to cDNA and then inserted into the genome.
Following examination of toxin diversity in several venomous animals (snakes and cone snails [11,17,18,20]) it
was suggested that duplication of the toxin genes followed
speciation. Our inter-species examination of depressant
and α-toxin families in Boi and BmK scorpions revealed
that most of the toxin subfamilies are unique to each species, suggesting again that speciation preceded gene duplication.
Here we suggest a possible evolutionary mechanism enabling fixation of toxin gene duplicates upon speciation.
Similar to point mutations, duplications occur in an individual, which can be either fixed or lost in the population.
If the new allele is selectively neutral, as compared with
pre-existing alleles, that allele has only the small probability of 1/2 N of being fixed in a diploid population [30],
where N is the effective population size. This suggests that
the vast majority of the duplicated genes will be lost. The
speciation process entails a vast decrease in the new effective population size, thus opening a short window of time
enabling an increase in the fixation rate of gene duplication. Therefore, the association of duplication with speciation could be due to a rise in the duplication fixation rate
upon speciation, caused by a decrease in the effective population size. For those duplicated genes that do become
fixed, fixation is time-consuming. On average, it takes 4 N
generations for a neutral allele to become fixed in a population of N individuals [30]. Furthermore, the number of
toxins in each family is similar in the two scorpions, as is
the overall number of toxins in the venom. The latter was
shown to also be the case in other scorpions [31], as well
as with other species [11,32]. Such observations imply
that upon a dramatic change in the environment that promotes speciation, rapid fixation rate of duplicated toxin
genes occurs so as to allow the introduction of novel toxic
phenotypes. At the same time, a similar number of toxin
genes are lost. This may allow for adaptation to novel ecological niches and pray, while maintaining a minimal
concentration of each of the toxins within the limited
venom pool, as was recently suggested for the PLA2 genes
of snakes [23].
Could gene conversion cause the intra-species toxin similarity? In the sea anemone N. vectensis [29], as well as in
two species of sea snakes [33,34], a very high degree of
conservation has been reported within certain toxin families, suggesting the involvement of concerted evolution
processes [29]. Here, the degree of diversity among paralogous genes roles out the possibility of recent gene conversion, although the higher degree of similarity between
paralogous genes, as compared with orthologous genes,
can not rule out the occurrence of early gene conversion
events [35].

Mature toxin gene diversification
Protein neofunctionalism after gene duplication is
believed to have played a major role in evolution [36],
although the mechanisms by which this process occurs
remains controversial. When comparing the amino acid
sequences of protoxins from all families, hyper-diversification of the mature toxin and conservation of the leader
peptide were observed (Fig. 3). In this study, we examined
the Boi depressant toxin gene family to evaluate the evolutionary processes leading to this phenomenon. Within
the mature-coding region, diversifying forces (Fig. 4) are
sufficient to explain the high observed substitution rate
(Fig. 6A, B) given that the neutral substitution rate within
the synonymous sites (i.e. substitution rate at the wobble
position at negatively-selected sites) is the same as that of
the mostly neutral intron (Fig. 6A). The high substitution
rate of the positively-selected sites gave rise to alleged
position-specific codon conservation at adjacent negatively-selected sites (Fig. 5).
Leader toxin hyper-conservation
Toxin family-specific amino acid conservation within the
leader peptide is apparent in the venoms of scorpions,
cone snails [11,18], snakes and spiders. This is surprising
as in most secreted proteins, only very basic biochemical
characteristics of the leader peptide are maintained, with
the amino acid sequence being variable [37]. We thus proceeded to elucidate a possible rationale for the amino acid
conservation within the leader peptides of toxins. A strong
negative selection was observed for most leader peptide
residues within Boi toxin genes, specifically at the amino
terminal (Fig. 4A). Is this the only force imposing strong
nucleotide conservation in this gene domain? Examining
the neutral substitution rate of the leader (within the wobble position at negatively selected sites) revealed a substantially lower rate than that of the neutral intron (Fig.
6A), implying the existence of purifying selection against
synonymous sites. This is probably not the consequence
of a recent exon-specific gene conversion, as certain residues within this region are relatively variable (Fig. 4A).
We examined the codon usage within the leader of each of
the two main toxin families (depressant and α-toxins)
and identified a family-specific pattern. This pattern was
unique to each family and different from that of the
mature-coding domain of each family and of the combined data set of all Boi mature toxin-coding regions. This
observation was statistically significant (chi square-test, p
< 0.001). On the other hand, the codon usage of the
mature toxin coding domain of each of the families was
not significantly different than that of the entire Boi
mature toxin coding regions data set. For example, the
most frequently used codon for leucine, the most abundant amino acid within the leader, for α-toxin is UUG. By
contrast, this codon is hardly used in the depressant toxin
leader sequence (Fig. 7). The rarely used codons, CUG and

CUC, are abundant within the depressant and α-toxin
leader sequences, respectively (Fig. 7).
The strong inter-species leader conservation, as indicated
by their defined segregation between Boi and BmK scorpions within depressant (Fig. 2B) and α-toxin families (not
shown), supports our suggestion for a codon usagedependant translational regulatory mechanism. This
implies that a transcriptional regulatory mechanism may
be at work that differently affects the toxin families tested
and is species-specific (Fig. 2B), as expected. Although, we
can not rule out other mechanisms for non-neutral evolution at synonymous sites, such as regulation of mRNA stability and/or intron splicing [38], here we propose that the
expression levels of toxin families are differentially controlled via regulation at the translation level. Our suggested mechanism exploits the relative abundance of
different tRNA species to either restrict or enhance translation rates.
In addition, a clear bias for transitions over transversions
was observed in the leader-coding domain in comparison
to the Tv/Ts ratio within the intron and the mature toxincoding domain (Fig. 6C). This could be attributed to
strong negative selection forces inflicted upon this region,
as at the most variable site, i.e., the wobble position, a
transition would be preferred since in 94% of cases, this
would result in a silent synonymous mutation.

In summary, positive selection upon mature toxin residues
was reported in the venoms of other venomous organisms,
such as snakes [12,13,39], cone snails [11,17] and spiders
[32], suggesting a common diversifying evolutionary
mechanism. Indeed, hyper-variability in gene families is
apparent in systems evolved to recognize foreign molecules, whether those genes encode venom-derived toxins,
gene families of the immune system or antigenic parasite
surface proteins [40]. In cone snails, a hyper-variabilitygenerating molecular mechanism relying upon an error
prone-like DNA polymerase was suggested [11].
In this work, by constructing and analyzing a dataset of
toxin transcripts from the venom gland of the scorpion
Boi, we were able to follow the evolutionary path leading
to scorpion toxin diversification. Duplicated genes encoding toxin peptides were fixed within the genome mainly
following speciation. Upon such fixation, the mature
toxin coding domain was subjected to diversifying selection to increase species fitness. This resulted in alleged
position-specific codon conservation at adjacent negatively-selected sites. On the other hand, the leader peptide
is characterized by a conservation of the amino acid
sequence, a sub-neutral synonymous substitution rate
and a strong transition bias. This was explained by purifying selection forces acting to conserve both the peptide
and DNA sequences. This suggests the presence of a family-specific, codon-sensitive translational regulatory
mechanism for toxin genes.

Methods
cDNA library construction and screening
Buthus occitanus israelis (Boi) scorpions were collected at
Sde Boker, Israel. Total RNA was extracted from the
venom glands of 10 scorpions using an EZ RNA extraction
kit (Promega), 2 days after electrical 'milking' of the
venom. mRNA was purified with a PolyATract mRNA Isolation System (Promega). Double-stranded cDNA was
synthesized from 2 μg of mRNA using the Universal Riboclone cDNA Synthesis System (Promega). Blunt end
cDNA clones were cloned into the pBluescript KS+ (pBS)
plasmid digested with SmaI and transfected into
Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Electro-transformation of the
cDNA ligation yielded a library comprising approximately
5 × 104 primary clones. To determine insert size, individual clones were amplified by PCR using T7 and T3 primers. To avoid sequencing through the poly A tail, insert
orientation was determined by PCR using the T3, T7 and
poly T primers. Four hundred and twenty randomly chosen cDNA clones, ranging in length from 250 to 600 bp,
were then sequenced to obtain a reliable representation of
the toxin content in the venom gland.
Molecular biology
Plasmid DNA was purified using a Wizard plus SV Miniprep kit (Promega). Restriction enzyme digestions, DNA
ligations and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
reactions were performed according to manufacturer
instructions (Fermentas or New England Biolabs). Competent E. coli DH5α cells were transformed by either heat
shock or electroporation procedures. Polymerase chain
reactions (PCR) were performed with a PTC-2000 apparatus (MJ Research), using Pfu (Fermentas) or Taq
(Promega) enzymes, as indicated.
Differentiation between genes and alleles
Genomic DNA was isolated from the same 10 scorpions
used for the cDNA library construction. Four pairs of
homologous genes exhibiting over 90% identity were
selected for analysis. As such, four PCR primer pairs were
designed, according to the cDNA sequence, to amplify
each gene pair. To distinguish between the clones, digestion by a restriction enzyme direct against a recognition
site found on only one of the genes in each pair was preformed.
Sequencing the introns of depressant toxins genes
Introns from the depressant toxin family were amplified
using Pfu DNA polymerase with Boi genomic DNA as
template. PCR forward primers were constructed to match
a highly conserved sequence of the 5' UTR and leader
regions. Reverse primers were designed to match a hypervariable region within the mature toxin-coding domain to
ensure specificity. PCR amplification products were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/333

cloned into a SmaI-digested pBS vector. Positive clones
were then sequenced to retrieve the intron sequence.
Evolutionary analysis
Toxin classification and homology identification was
achieved using the BLASTN and BLASTP programs [41].
Individual transcripts were aligned using MUSCLE algorithm [42]. Alignments were refined manually by the
Jalview program [43]. Unrooted phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the neighbor-joining method and maximum likelihood algorithms [44] using MEGA4 software
[45] and then visualized with TreeView [46]. Synonymous
versus non-synonymous substitution rates were analyzed
using the DNAsp [47] and Selecton [24] programs. Transitions versus transversion rates, as well as codon usage
profiles, were drawn using MEGA4 software. Nucleotide
diversity rates were estimated by the DNAsp program.
