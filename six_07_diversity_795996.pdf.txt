Abstract
Background: Marine Synechococcus owe their specific vivid color (ranging from blue-green to
orange) to their large extrinsic antenna complexes called phycobilisomes, comprising a central
allophycocyanin core and rods of variable phycobiliprotein composition. Three major pigment
types can be defined depending on the major phycobiliprotein found in the rods (phycocyanin,
phycoerythrin I or phycoerythrin II). Among strains containing both phycoerythrins I and II, four
subtypes can be distinguished based on the ratio of the two chromophores bound to these
phycobiliproteins. Genomes of eleven marine Synechococcus strains recently became available with
one to four strains per pigment type or subtype, allowing an unprecedented comparative genomics
study of genes involved in phycobilisome metabolism.
Results: By carefully comparing the Synechococcus genomes, we have retrieved candidate genes
potentially required for the synthesis of phycobiliproteins in each pigment type. This includes linker
polypeptides, phycobilin lyases and a number of novel genes of uncharacterized function.
Interestingly, strains belonging to a given pigment type have similar phycobilisome gene
complements and organization, independent of the core genome phylogeny (as assessed using
concatenated ribosomal proteins). While phylogenetic trees based on concatenated
allophycocyanin protein sequences are congruent with the latter, those based on phycocyanin and
phycoerythrin notably differ and match the Synechococcus pigment types.
Conclusion: We conclude that the phycobilisome core has likely evolved together with the core
genome, while rods must have evolved independently, possibly by lateral transfer of phycobilisome
rod genes or gene clusters between Synechococcus strains, either via viruses or by natural
transformation, allowing rapid adaptation to a variety of light niches.

Background

Since their discovery almost 30 years ago [1,2], marine representatives of the Synechococcus genus have been found in the
upper illuminated layer of most marine ecosystems, from
coastal to offshore waters as well as from low to high latitudes
[3-5]. Besides being ubiquitous, Synechococcus are often
abundant, with cell densities ranging from a few hundred to
over one million cells per milliliter of seawater [6-10].
Synechococcus cells owe their vivid colors mainly to their
photosynthetic antenna, called phycobilisomes (PBSs). These
water-soluble macromolecular complexes comprise rods surrounding a central core and are made of phycobiliproteins,
which covalently bind chromophores (phycobilins) by
thioether bonds to cysteinyl residues (for reviews, see [1115]). All phycobiliproteins in cyanobacteria consist of two distinct subunits, α and β, organized either as trimeric (αβ)3 or,
in most cases, as hexameric discs (αβ)6. The PBS core of
marine Synechococcus is made of allophycocyanin (AP),
which binds only the blue-colored chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB; Amax = 620 nm). In some strains, phycocyanin
(PC) may constitute the whole rod, as it does in many freshwater cyanobacteria (for example, Synechococcus elongatus
PCC 7942, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803). In that case, it binds
only PCB and is of the C-PC type [15]. However, in most phycoerythrin (PE)-containing marine Synechococcus characterized so far, PC makes up the basal disc at the core-proximal
end of the rods. It binds both PCB and the red-colored
chromophore phycoerythrobilin (PEB; Amax = 550 nm) at a
molar ratio of 1:2 and thus belongs to the R-PCII type [16]. In
strain WH7805, however, the base of the rods is thought to
consist of a so-called R-PCIII, an optically unusual PC that
binds PCB and PEB at a molar ratio of 2:1 [15,17].
In most PE-containing Synechococcus strains isolated to
date, the distal part of the PBS rods is composed of two types
of PE (PEI and PEII). PEII always binds both PEB and the
orange colored phycourobilin (PUB; Amax = 495 nm), whereas
PEI binds either only PEB or both PEB and PUB [18,19].
However, Everroad and Wood [20] have recently suggested
that some marine Synechococcus strains may contain rods
with a single type of PE that binds only PEB chromophores.
In addition, the higher order structure of PBSs is stabilized by
linker polypeptides that contribute to the building of a protein environment around the phycobilins [14,21]. These linkers have very variable sizes (8-120 kDa) but most are in the
27-35 kDa range. In the rods, only those associated with PEII
are chromophorylated with PUB [19,21].
Although the Synechococcus genus itself is polyphyletic,
marine Synechococcus characterized thus far form a welldefined branch within the cyanobacteria radiation, together
with the Prochlorococcus and Cyanobium genera [22-25].
This grouping, called 'Cluster 5' by Herdman and coworkers
[26], is a combination of the former Marine Clusters A and B
previously defined by Waterbury and Rippka [27]. Cluster 5

Volume 8, Issue 12, Article R259

thus gathers coastal, euryhaline Synechococcus strains as
well as strictly marine strains (that is, with elevated growth
requirements for Na+, Mg+ and Ca++). Subclusters 5.1 and 5.2
have also been tentatively defined by Herdman and coworkers [26] in order to separate the strictly marine PE-containing
strains (5.1) from a group of euryhaline strains lacking PE
(5.2), including WH5701 and WH8007. However, Fuller and
coworkers [23] have shown that one clade within the subcluster 5.1 (clade VIII) gathers euryhaline strains lacking PE and
Chen and coworkers [25] have isolated several new members
of subcluster 5.2 into culture that do contain PE. Furthermore, the latter authors suggested that WH5701 and
WH8007 might actually belong to two distinct clusters.
Among the strains containing two PE types, there is a clear
consistency between phylogenies based on different molecular markers, including rpoC1 [28], ntcA [29], the 16S rRNA
gene [23] and the 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer
[24]. However, none of these phylogenies is congruent with
the whole cell ratio of PUB to PEB. This chromophore ratio is
known to vary according to the light niche, with open ocean
strains predominantly displaying a high PUB:PEB whereas
mesotrophic or coastal strains generally have lower ratios or
no PUB [6,7,30-32]. Some strains even display a variable
PUB:PEB depending on the ambient light quality, that is, they
are able to chromatically adapt [33]. These so-called type IV
chromatic adapters are not confined to a particular phylogenetic clade within Cluster 5 [34]. This raises the question of
the molecular basis of differences in whole cell PUB:PEB
between Synechococcus strains. More generally, one might
wonder whether PBS components have undertaken a different evolutionary trajectory compared to the core genome.
In order to address these questions, we studied 11 Synechococcus strains, belonging to various phylogenetic clades
according to Fuller et al. [23] and representing the whole
variety of PBS pigmentations known so far within Cluster 5.
We compared the PBS gene complements of these strains, an
approach that revealed a number of novel PBS genes, including putative lyases and linker polypeptides. By combining
these genomic data with biochemical and optical properties of
isolated phycobiliprotein complexes, we identified several
marine Synechococcus pigment types and we propose putative, structural models for their corresponding PBSs. We also
examined the phylogeny of each phycobiliprotein type, yielding new insights into the evolution of PBS complexes within
the marine Synechococcus group.

Results
Synechococcus pigment types
Despite the apparently large diversity of pigmentation existing among marine Synechococcus, these can be partitioned
into only three major types based on the phycobiliprotein
composition of the rods: type 1 representatives have only PC,
type 2 have PC and PEI and type 3 have PC, PEI and PEII.

Photograph of representative cultured strains of the major pigment types
(1-3) and subtypes (3a-c) of marine Synechococcus grown under low white
light and (b) corresponding absorption properties of whole cells. Pigment
subtype 3d corresponds to type IV chromatic adapters, which are able to
modify their PBS pigmentation from subtype 3b when grown under white
or green light to subtype 3c when grown under blue light. The different
colors of stars in panel A are a code for the different pigment types.

Type 3 can be further subdivided into four subtypes (3a
through 3d) based on the ratio of the two chromophores (PEB
and PUB) bound to PEs, a ratio that can be low, medium, high
or variable. Figure 1a illustrates these different pigment types
or subtypes and their corresponding colors. The 11 fully
sequenced marine Synechococcus strains cover the whole
range of PBS pigmentation known so far in this group
[6,23,33]. Pigment type 1 is represented by the blue-green,
PE-lacking strains WH5701 and RS9917. These strains
absorb light optimally in the wavelength range 600-660 nm,
that is, red and orange light (Figure 1b). The genome of the
fuchsia pink WH7805 strain (pigment type 2) contains a single set of PE genes encoding a PEI-like complex, as detailed
below. The whole cell absorption maximum of this form of PE
devoid of PUB (Amax = 570 nm, corresponding to yellow-green
light) is red-shifted relative to other PEs (Figure 1b).

Volume 8, Issue 12, Article R259

Six et al. R259.3

All strains displaying pigment type 3 possess both PEB and
PUB chromophores. Subtypes 3a through 3c differ from one
another in their whole cell ratio of PUB to PEB (hereafter
PUB:PEB), as assessed by their fluorescence excitation
maxima (F495 nm : F550 nm) with emission at 580 nm (Table 1).
Note that the use of this fluorescence excitation ratio is preferable to using the corresponding absorption ratio (A495 nm:
A550 nm) to characterize these different subtypes in vivo, since
the carotenoids zeaxanthin and β-carotene have a notable
contribution to the wavelength range of the PUB absorption
peak (Figure 1b). The PUB:PEB can be either low (approximately 0.4) in type 3a strains such as WH7803, medium
(approximately 0.8) in type 3b strains such as RCC307 or
high (>1.7) in type 3c strains such as in WH8102 and CC9605
(Table 1). Depending on this ratio, PBSs of these strains preferentially harvest either green light (550 nm) or blue-green
light (495 nm) (Figure 1b). Finally, pigment type 3d includes
strains with a variable PUB:PEB (0.7-1.7), depending on
whether these cells are grown under white/green or blue light
[33,34]. These type IV chromatic adapters include the strains
CC9311, RS9916, BL107 and CC9902 as well as a number of
other strains that have not yet been sequenced (including
WH8020, M16.17, M11.1, RCC61 (a.k.a. Minos 11) and
RS9911; Table 1 and data not shown). To this suite of pigment
types can be added a 'moderately high' PUB:PEB subtype
(PUB:PEB approximately 1.2), represented by strain
WH8103 and which is indistinguishable by eye from, and
included within, type 3c (Figure 1a). Though as yet unsequenced, the genome of WH8103 has been screened, in part,
by suppression subtractive hybridization [35].

Optical properties of phycobiliproteins
The color and specific absorption properties of whole Synechococcus cells (Figure 1) are mainly determined by the major
phycobiliprotein form occurring in the PBS rods. Isolated PC
and/or PE complexes have been previously characterized in a
few marine Synechococcus strains, including WH7803,
WH7805, WH8102, WH8103 and the chromatic adapters
WH8020 (under white light only), M11.1 and M16.17 [13,1619,34,36], as summarized in Table 1. In order to explore further the diversity and possible combinations of these phycobiliproteins in the different Synechococcus pigment types, we
have used sucrose density gradients and isoelectric focusing
to isolate PC, PEI and/or PEII from a number of other strains
and then have determined their optical properties (Figures 2
and 3 and Table 1).
The PC present in WH5701 and RS9917, which formed a sky
blue band on isoelectric focusing gels (not shown), had
absorption (Amax = 621 nm) and fluorescence (Fmax = 648 nm)
properties typical of C-PC (Figure 2a), that is, known to bind
only PCB chromophores [15]. We also found C-PC in the PEcontaining, PUB-lacking strain WH8018, whereas WH7805
(which, like WH8018, displays pigment type 2) is known to
possess R-PCIII [17]. R-PCIII has a molar PCB:PEB of 2:1,
like the R-PCI of red algae, but a different spectrum, with an

Subcluster and clade numbers are as defined in [23]. Strains are ordered by pigment type (1-3), as defined by their PBS rod composition, and subtype
(3a-d) as defined by their whole cell PUB to PEB fluorescence excitation ratio (PUB:PEB ± standard deviation; n = 2 to 4). Phycobiliproteins have
been classified into different forms, based on their respective chromophorylation (see text). References in the last column specify which PBP is

Amax at 555 nm and a shoulder at 590 nm [17]. Our isolation
protocol did not allow us to obtain a pure PC fraction from
any of the PEII-containing strains, because the PC band was
always contaminated by variable amounts of PEII. It is
known, however, that Synechococcus sp. WH7803, like
WH8020 and WH8103, possesses a R-PCII type PC with a
molar PEB:PCB of 2:1; it has absorption peaks at 533, 554 and
615 nm and maximal fluorescence emission at 646 nm [16].
Several types of PEI can be distinguished based on their different optical properties. The major phycobiliprotein found in
WH7805 and WH8018, a PEI-like phycobiliprotein, exhibited an Amax at 556 nm and an Fmax at 577 nm (Figure 2b). We

have called it PEI-A* to distinguish it from the PEI-A found in
Synechococcus strains displaying the 3a and 3b pigment
types. PEI-A has blue-shifted optical properties (Amax = 550
nm; Fmax = 572 nm; Figure 2c) compared to PEI-A*, though
both forms bind only PEB chromophores. PEI-B, which has a
molar PUB:PEB of 2:3 [18], has been found in all strains
exhibiting pigment type 3c examined thus far, as well as in
some chromatic adapters, including M11.1 and M16.17 [34]. It
has maximal absorption at 493 and 563 nm and fluorescence
at 573 nm (Figure 2d).
Similarly, one can distinguish three optical types of PEII differing by their PUB:PEB. All have two absorption maxima (or

M16.17 [34] and RS9916 (this study). Its molar PUB:PEB is
2:4. PEII-C (Figure 3c) is found in Synechococcus pigment
type 3c, including WH8103 [18], WH8102 [19], Oli31 and
CC9605 (this study) as well as in the blue light-grown chromatic adapters [34]. The molar PUB:PEB of this PEII has
been shown to be 4:2 [18].

Comparative analysis of the phycobilisome gene
regions
After careful annotation, we compared PBS gene complement
(Additional data file 1) and organization in the 11 different
genomes. One remarkable trait of marine Synechococcus is
that most of the PBS genes are gathered into a few gene clus-

ters [19,37]. As in several other cyanobacteria, a first small
cluster groups together four AP core genes, in the order apcEA-B-C, while two other core genes, apcD and apcF (encoding
the minor α-B and β-18 AP subunits, respectively) have no
PBS gene in their close vicinity. Most of the PBS rod genes are
located in a much larger cluster, the size of which increases
with the complexity of the rod structure from approximately
9-10 Kbp in pigment type 1 up to 27-28.5 Kbp in chromatic
adapters (Figure 4). Interestingly, the gene organization in
this region is very similar for strains belonging to a given pigment type. It is also similar between the chromatic adapters
and the medium PUB:PEB strain RCC307.
In most genomes, the 5'-end of the PBS rod gene region starts
with a short gene of unknown function (unk1). In RCC307,
however, the unk1 ortholog is found elsewhere in the genome.
The 3'-end of the region consists of a well conserved gene predicted to encode a low molecular weight phosphotyrosine
phosphatase. In the blue-green, PE-lacking strains, the rest of
the region is mainly composed of two identical cpcB-A operons encoding the C-PC α- and β-subunits and of genes encoding three rod linkers, one rod-core linker and two types of
phycobilin lyases (CpcT and CpcE/F; see below). Both

Figure 4 of PBS rod gene regions of the different pigment types of marine Synechococcus
Comparison
Comparison of PBS rod gene regions of the different pigment types of marine Synechococcus. Rectangles above and below the lines have a length
proportional to the size of ORFs and correspond to the forward and the reverse strand, respectively. In several genomes, the sense of the rod region was
inversed so that the regions all appear in the same direction. For the group formed by the chromatic adapters and RCC307, a few variations can be found
with regard to the region shown here, which corresponds to BL107. First, the lyase-encoding gene(s) located near the 3'-end can either be a rpcE-F operon
or rpcG, a pecEF-like fusion gene (see text). Second, the gene organization at the 5'-end can vary: unk1 is located elsewhere in the genome of RCC307 and
the gene following unk2 is either the lyase gene cpcT in RS9916 and RCC307, unk3 in BL107 and CC9902, or none of these in CC9311. Colored stars
indicate the pigment type of each strain (see Figure 1 for color code).

RS9917 and WH5701 have an additional cpcB gene copy outside the PBS rod gene region but, surprisingly, no additional
cpcA.
A part of the PC gene cluster found in the blue-green strains
(cpcCI-D-B-A-CII) is replaced in the fuchsia pink strain
WH7805 by a set of 19 genes, likely involved in the synthesis
and regulation of a PEI-like complex (Figure 2). The pebA and
pebB genes, located at the 3'-end of this insertion, are known
to be involved in the synthesis of PEB chromophores [38].
This PE region can also be found in all PEII-containing
strains, but it is interrupted by an additional sub-region
containing 5 to 9 genes, between the PE regulator cpeR [39]
and the putative lyase gene cpeY in WH7803 (or cpeZ in the
other strains). This inserted sub-region includes genes encoding the PEII α- and β-subunits, two phycobilin lyases, one
linker polypeptide and two or three uncharacterized proteins.

Volume 8, Issue 12, Article R259

Six et al. R259.8

In addition, all PEII-containing strains have, upstream of
cpcGII, an ortholog of aplA. Its product, AplA, which shows
homology to the AP α-subunit (ApcA), was recently described
in Fremyella diplosiphon as belonging to a new class of
cyanobacterial photosensors of unknown function [40].
In the following sections, we have analyzed more specifically
the phyletic profile (that is, the different patterns of occurrence of orthologs in the set of Synechococcus genomes) and
characteristics of three gene categories: genes encoding linker
polypeptides (Table 2), genes encoding putative phycobilin
lyases (Table 3) and genes of unknown function specifically
located in the PBS rod gene region and, therefore, potentially
involved in PBS metabolism or regulation (Table 4).

Synechococcus except strains CC9311 and RS9916, in which
LCM has four such domains. RCC307 has the shortest LCM
sequence (953 amino acids) compared to the other strains
due to shorter Arm2 and Arm3 regions (see [15,41] for details
on LCM domains). Besides the PC-associated linker genes
found in the rod gene region of both blue-green strains (Figure 4), WH5701 has a third cpcC homolog (cpcCIII) located
elsewhere in the genome that potentially encodes a chimeric
protein since it has an extended carboxyl terminus showing
strong similarity to CpcD. None of the PE-containing strains
possesses cpcC and cpcD homologs. In all marine Synechoc-

occus genomes, the rod-core linker gene cpcGII is found in
the PBS rod region whereas cpcGI is found outside this cluster. A third cpcG gene copy, which we refer to as cpcGIII, is
present elsewhere in the genomes of BL107, CC9902, CC9311
and CC9605.
The total number of putative PE-associated linker genes varies from zero in the blue-green strains to six in the group
constituted by the chromatic adapters and RCC307 (Table 2
and Figure 4). The location of the mpeE linker gene appears
more variable than the other PEII genes, as it can be found

In order to compare further the linker composition of marine
Synechococcus strains and determine whether they are all
present in the PBSs, we performed a lithium dodecyl sulphate
(LiDS)-PAGE analysis of intact PBSs. The Coomassie stained
gel shown in Figure 5 displays the PBS proteins of two to three
strains per pigment type. For WH7803 and RCC307, a Tristricine running buffer provided a better separation of the
linker polypeptides than Tris-glycine (Figure 5, right). For
strains WH5701, WH7805, WH7803, RCC307 and RS9916,
all linker polypeptide bands (except ApcC and CpcD, which
are not detectable under these electrophoresis conditions)
were cut out from the gel and then identified by mass spectrometry (Table 2). In all five strains, the upper band proved

the PBS core region, an additional gene potentially encoding
a PEII-associated linker (Table 3). In phylogenetic trees made
with all PEII linkers (Additional data file 3), these sequences
are both related to the amino terminus of MpeD but are split
between two distinct gene clusters, one gathering BL107,
CC9311 and CC9902, which we propose to name MpeF, and
the other gathering RS9916 and RCC307, which we propose
to name MpeG.

Surprisingly, the PEII-lacking strain WH7805 possesses a
homolog of mpeD, a gene known to encode a chimeric protein
made of a PEII-associated linker (amino terminus) and a PEIassociated CpeD-like linker (carboxyl terminus) [19]. However, closer examination of the amino-terminal part of this
protein in WH7805 reveals a relatively low similarity with
other MpeD sequences and a notable deletion of the region
corresponding to amino acids 43-59 in Synechococcus sp.
WH8102 [19] that is conserved in all other MpeD sequences
(Additional data file 2). This region includes two cysteinyl
residues involved in linking a PUB chromophore via a Δ2,3
double bond, a type of chromophorylation typical of PEIIassociated linker polypeptides [21]. Synechococcus sp.
WH7803 also lacks the mpeC gene, which encodes the distal
PEII-associated linker polypeptide in other strains [19,21].
Finally, both chromatic adapters and RCC307 have, outside

to be the core-membrane linker LCM, often accompanied by
its degradation product LCM', making a band of lower apparent molecular weight. As expected, RS9916, which has an
extended apcE gene sequence, possesses the LCM band of lowest electrophoretic mobility. Although the rod-core linker
CpcGI was systematically present in all four strains, no
CpcGII was detected by mass spectrometry, suggesting either
that the cpcGII gene is expressed at a much lower level than
cpcGII or that CpcGII is not present in the PBS fraction of
these strains. It is worth noting though that we previously
observed CpcGII (co-migrating with CpcGI) in a PBS fraction
from Synechococcus sp. WH8102 [19]. Interestingly, we identified all three predicted PC rod linkers in WH5701, including
the CpcCD-like protein, which is not found in the RS9917
genome. Furthermore, all PEII linkers predicted in WH7803,
RCC307 and RS9916 were detected by mass spectrometry,
except the products of the mpeF gene of RS9916 and of the
mpeG gene of RCC307 (Table 1). This suggests that either
these two potential linker genes are not expressed in our
standard culture conditions or their products are
undetectable on Coomassie-stained LiDS-PAGE gels due to
some inherent biochemical properties.

Lyases, lyase-isomerases and related genes
Four types of phycobilin lyases, enzymes involved in the
chromophorylation of phycobiliproteins, have been characterized so far. One of these, the heterodimeric CpcE/F complex, reversibly ligates a PCB molecule to Cys-84 of the αsubunit of C-PC [42,43]. Two genes with strong homology to
the characterized cpcE and cpcF genes of Synechococcus spp.
PCC 7942 [44] and PCC 7002 [45] are found near the 3'-end
of the rod gene region in 7 out of the 11 marine Synechococcus
genomes. We have called these cpcE-F in the two C-PC-containing strains (RS9917 and WH5701) and rpcE-F in
WH7803, CC9311 and CC9902, in agreement with the
nomenclature proposed by Wilbanks and Glazer [37]. Indeed,
Synechococcus sp. WH7803 (as well as WH8020 and
WH8103) possesses a R-PCII type PC that has a PEB at α-84
[16]. Though we have called these genes rpcE/F in strains
WH7805 and RCC307 as well (Additional data file 1), it is
worth noting that in phylogenetic trees made with concatenated CpeE-F or RpcE-F protein sequences using Gloeobacter violaceus as an outgroup, these two strains cluster
with RS9917 and WH5701, with only moderate bootstrap
support (Additional data file 4). Both CpeE/F and RpcE/F
lyases from marine Synechococcus possess all sites described
by Zhao and coworkers [46] to be important for the activity of
CpeE/F in Fischerella sp. PCC 7603 (a.k.a. Mastidocladus
laminosus), so they cannot be differentiated on this basis. In
the four other Synechococcus genomes, including the high
PUB:PEB strains WH8102 and CC9605 and the chromatic
adapters BL107 and RS9916, these two lyase genes are
replaced by a single fusion gene that we propose to call rpcG
(Table 3). The amino- and carboxy-terminal parts of the rpcG
gene product show strong homology to the PecE and PecF of
Fischerella sp., respectively, the two subunits of a PCB lyase-

isomerase, which binds a PCB to Cys84 of the phycoerythrocyanin α-subunit and concomitantly isomerizes it into phycoviolobilin [47,48]. A conserved motif 'NHCQGN' shown to be
crucial for the isomerase activity of Fischerella PecF is
present in the carboxyl terminus of the four marine Synechococcus RpcG sequences (for example, positions 361-366 of
SYNW2005 in WH8102). This suggests that RpcG is also a
phycobilin lyase-isomerase, although several other sites
defined as potentially important for the activity of the PecE/F
enzyme in Fischerella sp. [49] are not conserved in those
sequences.
An ortholog of cpcT, shown in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
to encode a lyase catalyzing the binding of PCB at Cys153 of
the C-PC β-subunit [50], is found in WH5701, RS9917,
WH7805, RCC307 and RS9916 (Table 3). This gene belongs
to a family of three paralogs, including cpeT, first described in
the PE gene cluster of F. diplosiphon [39] and located at a
similar position in all PE-containing marine Synechococcus
(Figure 4). An uncharacterized gene located near the 5'-end of
the PBS rod gene cluster of all PE-containing strains except
RCC307 also belongs to this family. We propose to name this
gene rpcT, since it is present in the PC-specific gene region of
WH7803, which possesses R-PCII. Thus, most marine Synechococcus strains possess either cpcT or rpcT. Surprisingly,
the RS9916 strain possesses both genes, confirming their paralogous nature (Additional data file 5).
Marine Synechococcus possess another family of three paralogous lyase genes. One of them encodes a lyase that was first
characterized in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 as catalyzing the binding of PCB at β-84 of both C-PC and phycoerythrocyanin [51].
More recently, this enzyme was shown to have an even larger
spectrum of activity, since it is also able in vitro to bind PCB
at Cys84 of all AP subunits (that is, ApcA, B, D and F) from
Nostoc sp. as well as PEB at Cys84 of both α- and β-PE subunits (that is, CpeA and B) from F. diplosiphon [52]. Surprisingly, Zhao and co-workers have called this lyase 'CpeS1'
though there is no PE in PCC 7120 and its best hit in the
marine Synechococcus protein databases is not the product of
the cpeS gene (located immediately upstream of cpeT in the
PE gene sub-region; Figure 4), but the product of a gene
found in tandem with cpcGI in all Synechococcus strains,
including blue-green, PE-lacking strains. So, we suggest to
rename it cpcS (Table 3, Figure 4 and Additional data file 6).
Surprisingly, the cpcS gene is split into two different reading
frames in WH5701. This is likely a sequencing error, because
absence of chromophorylation at Cys84 in all AP and in β-PC
subunits would likely render the energy transfer through
these phycobiliproteins very poorly efficient. An uncharacterized gene located upstream of the pebA-B operon (Figure 4)
constitutes the third member of this family of paralogous
lyase genes (Additional data file 6), and we propose to name
it cpeU.

Genome Biology 2007,

PE-containing Synechococcus possess several genes in the
PEI or PEII gene sub-regions that encode proteins showing
homology to other types of lyases, likely involved in binding
phycobilins to one or both PEs. These lyases include CpeY and
CpeZ, which in F. diplosiphon were presumed to be subunits
of a heterodimeric lyase, binding PEB to PE α- or β-subunits
[53], but the precise site specificity of this enzyme is hitherto
unknown. The mpeU and mpeV genes, which were first
observed in Synechococcus sp. WH8020 by Wilbanks and
Glazer [37], likely encode two additional lyases. These paralogous genes are both present in the chromatic adapters and in
RCC307, whereas WH7803 and WH7805 have only mpeV
and the high PUB:PEB strains only mpeU (Table 3). Finally,
we found two novel, paralogous lyase genes, again closely
related to one another and more distantly related to cpeY. We
propose to name these genes mpeY and mpeZ. Contrary to
CpeY and CpeZ, the products of these putative lyase genes
likely do not form heterodimers, given their distinct phyletic
profiles (Table 3). Indeed, mpeY is found in the PEII-specific
sub-region of all PEII-containing strains (Figure 4) whereas
mpeZ is found only in the genomes of the chromatic adapters
and of RCC307, outside the PBS gene clusters.

Conserved hypothetical genes located in the
phycobilisome gene region
Table 4 reports the phyletic profile of 13 conserved hypothetical genes associated with the PBS rod region of all (or a
majority of) strains. Many of them are seemingly specific to
marine Synechococcus while some are found in other cyanobacterial genera, including Prochlorococcus and/or Gloeobacter. It is worth noting though that there are still very few
genomes of phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria in current databases and it is likely that homologs will be found in
those as they become available. In this study, we have given
these genes the provisional names unk1-13, until a more complete characterization is performed.
As already mentioned, the unk1 gene is located upstream of
the PBS rod region in all strains except RCC307, in which
unk1 is located elsewhere in the genome. Another unknown
gene (unk2) immediately follows unk1 in most PE-containing
strains (in RCC307, it is the first gene of the PBS rod gene
region). The unk2 gene is found three genes downstream of
unk1 in the two blue-green strains. The predicted Unk2 protein sequence generally shows a fairly large variability among
the different Synechococcus strains, although the BL107 and
CC9902 sequences are very closely related (91% identity at
the amino acid level). Both Unk1 and Unk2 are short proteins
with no recognizable motifs. The unk3 gene is associated with
the PBS rod region in only four out of the eleven genomes and
encodes a protein with six putative transmembrane helices. It
is therefore probably not directly related to PBS structure.
The unk4 gene is present upstream of aplA in all PE-containing strains and directly upstream of cpcGII in WH7805,
which lacks aplA. The unk5 gene, generally located downstream of cpcGII, has the same phyletic profile as unk4 (Table

Volume 8, Issue 12, Article R259

Six et al. R259.12

4) and its product possesses pentapeptide repeat motifs.
Though very short (57-61 amino acids), the Unk6 protein is
very well conserved among the PE-containing Synechococcus. A cluster of three consecutive short and conserved hypothetical genes (unk7-9) is found only in PEII-containing
strains. Localization of these genes in a PEII-specialized subregion strongly suggests that they are involved in some still
unknown function specifically related to PEII. The predicted
proteins Unk7 and Unk8 both possess a motif of unknown
function (PF07862) also found in the product of a gene
located in the nif cluster of several cyanobacteria as well as in
the nitrogen-fixing proteobacterium Azotobacter vinelandii
[54]. Surprisingly, in WH7803, unk7 and unk8 are fused and
reversed with regard to unk9. This suggests that these genes
encode two subunits of the same heterodimeric complex. In
the high PUB:PEB strains WH8102 and CC9605, the PEIIspecialized region ends with unk10, which is strongly conserved between these strains (90% identity at the amino acid
level). Homologs of unk10 are also found in the genomes of
the chromatic adapters and in RCC307 but outside the PBS
rod gene region and have only about 49% identity with
sequences of the high PUB:PEB strains. Located in the PEIspecific region, the translated unk11 gene is very variable in
length and sequence (especially the 3'-end) among marine
Synechococcus strains. In contrast, the neighboring gene
unk12 displays low sequence variability between strains.
Finally, the unk13 gene, though strongly conserved, was not
correctly modeled in WH8102, in which a wrong open reading frame (ORF; SYNW2018) was predicted in a different
reading frame. The unk12 gene was previously known and
was called orf140 in WH8020 by Wilbanks and Glazer [37],
who sequenced the 3'-end of the PBS rod gene region from
mpeB to the phosphatase. By remodeling this region, we confirmed that the unk11 and unk13 genes are also present in this
strain and were incorrectly assigned by these authors.
Though partial, the organization and gene content of this
region in WH8020 [37] is clearly similar to that of chromatic
adapters (Figure 4), and this is confirmed by the ability of this
strain to chromatically adapt (Table 1; see also [33]).

Phylogeny of phycobilisome genes
Both PBS gene complement and organization in the genome
are very similar for strains belonging to a given pigment type,
independent of their position in phylogenetic trees based, for
instance, on the 16S rRNA gene [23,34]. Thus, we wondered
whether the phylogeny of PBS genes could differ from the
core genome phylogeny. To answer this question, we built
phylogenetic trees based on concatenated protein sequences
of each phycobiliprotein type and compared them with reference trees made with all concatenated ribosomal proteins,
which are good representatives of the core genome (Figure 6).
Concatenation generally allows building phylogenies that are
more robust when sequences are strongly conserved, as is the
case for phycobiliproteins. Still, maximum parsimony (MP)
analyses generally provided more variable results than maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor joining (NJ) analyses due

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R259

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/12/R259

Genome Biology 2007,

to a relatively low number of informative sites. Whenever
possible, we used the primitive, PE-containing, freshwater
cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus as an outgroup to root
our trees, in order to better understand evolution of PBSs
within the marine Synechococcus group.
The phylogenetic trees obtained with concatenated proteins
encoding the AP components (ApcA-B-C-D-F; Figure 6b)
share many characteristics with those based on ribosomal
proteins (Figure 6a). In both cases, RCC307 and WH5701 are
isolated on two long branches well apart from all other
strains. Furthermore, WH7803 and WH7805 on the one
hand, and CC9902 and BL107 on the other, appear closely
related to one another. The only variable positions are those
of the closely related strains RS9916 and RS9917, which cluster on the same branch as WH7803, WH7805 and CC9311 in
the ribosomal tree, and at the base of the branch bearing
BL107, CC9902, CC9605 and WH8102 in the AP tree, but
with relatively low bootstrap support in the second case.
The phylogenetic trees of concatenated PC α- and β-subunits
(CpcGII was not included because mass spectrometry analyses suggested it may not be part of the PBS; Table 2) show a
number of differences relative to the AP tree, including the
fact that the two blue-green strains group together (with high
bootstrap support) apart from all others (Figure 6c). This is
consistent with the fact that they both have C-PC (binding
only PCB), whereas all other strains have a PC form binding
both PCB and PEB. The relative positions of WH7805 and
RCC307 varied between phylogenetic methods. WH7805 is
known to contain R-PCIII [17] and this is probably the case
for RCC307 as well, based on their similar PC lyase gene content, including cpcS, cpcT and rpcE-F (Table 3). All strains
containing R-PCII (or possibly another, unidentified PC
form, for those strains possessing rpcG; Table 3) formed a
well-supported cluster with both ML and NJ methods, though
the relative positions of CC9311 and RS9916 were variable
within this cluster.
The phylogeny obtained for the concatenated PEI proteins
CpeA-B-Y-Z - addition of Unk12 did not significantly alter the
tree topologies, but gave lower bootstrap support (data not
shown) - fits well with the pigment types, as defined in Table
1. Indeed, the two high PUB:PEB strains group together, well
apart from the other PE-containing strains. RCC307 is found
at the base of a cluster formed by chromatic adapters (Figure
6d), consistent with the fact that all these strains share a similar PBS gene complement and organization. Likewise, strains
WH7803 and WH7805 group together, consistent with the
similar organization of their PEI-like region, with cpeZ being
located downstream of mpeV instead of upstream of cpeY as
in all other PE-containing strains (Figure 4).
Phylogenetic trees obtained with the concatenated PEII proteins MpeA-B-Y and Unk7-9 - inclusion of Unk7-9 does not
alter the tree topologies obtained with the sole MpeA-B-Y

sequences but provides better bootstrap support - are shown
without an outgroup, since this phycobiliprotein form is not
found in freshwater cyanobacteria. Still, these trees are globally similar to those obtained with PEI proteins, with three
main clusters, one gathering the medium PUB:PEB strain
RCC307 and the chromatic adapters, one gathering the two
high PUB:PEB strains, whereas the low PUB:PEB strain
WH7803 clusters apart from all others.

Discussion
Comparative genomics reveal novel genes involved in
phycobilisome metabolism
We have identified and compared a number of genes potentially involved in the synthesis and chromophorylation of
PBSs in a variety of sequenced marine Synechococcus strains
spanning all PBS pigment types known so far in this group.
Strains displaying different pigment types have different gene
complements with a considerable increase in complexity
from type 1 (WH5701 and RS9917) to type 3d (chromatic
adapters). Synthesis of rods entirely composed of PC, as
found in the first type, requires at least 15 genes. This includes
two cpcB-A operons encoding C-PC α- and β-subunits, two
rod-core linker genes (cpcGI and cpcGII), two cpcC and one
cpcD rod linker genes (in WH5701, an additional cpcC gene,
cpcCIII, was in fact found to be a cpcC/D gene chimera), four
genes encoding three different lyases (CpcE/F, CpcS and
CpcT) and the PCB biosynthesis gene pcyA, which encodes
the PCB:ferredoxin oxidoreductase [55]. Whether unk1 and
unk2, usually found at or near the 5'-end of the PBS rod gene
region (Figure 4), are also involved in PC metabolism awaits
experimental checking. An additional cpcB gene, absent from
other blue-green cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus sp.
PCC 7942 or Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, is found unlinked
to other PBS genes in both WH5701 and RS9917. While the
three cpcB copies are almost identical in RS9917, the isolated
copy is somehow divergent from the other two in WH5701.
This may indicate a recent change in function. All PEII-containing strains possess an AP-like gene encoding a protein
derived from a phycobiliprotein, the homolog of which, aplA,
was shown in F. diplosiphon to encode a photoreceptor not
linked to the PBS [40]. So it is possible that the additional
CpcB found in the blue-green strains might have a similar
function though, contrary to AplA, this protein appears to
have retained the ability to interact with the α-PC subunit.
Indeed, amino acids involved in maintaining these interactions [56] are conserved in all CpcB copies.
By comparing the PBS gene complement of strain WH7805
with that of blue-green strains, it appears that the occurrence
of a single PEI-like PE type in the rod necessitates at least 19
genes. This includes one set of PE α- and β-subunit encoding
genes, three linker genes (cpeC, cpeE and a mpeD-like gene),
six putative lyase genes, two genes involved in PEB synthesis
(pebA and pebB) and a number of novel genes of yet unknown
function, including unk5, 6, 12, 13 and perhaps unk11. Indeed,

from the primitive, freshwater cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus, taken as an outgroup. The PEII tree is unrooted since these proteins are specific for
marine Synechococcus spp. Numbers at internal branches correspond to bootstrap values for 1,000 replicate trees obtained with ML/NJ/MP methods.
Colored stars indicate the pigment type of each strain (see Figure 1 for color code).

all these unk genes are specific to PE-containing Synechococcus and all but unk11 are well conserved. Despite its tiny size,
explaining why it has often been missed by annotation
software, unk6 is likely a true gene since it is also present in
all Prochlorococcus strains (data not shown). In both
Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus spp., unk6 is
located upstream of the putative phycobilin lyase gene cpeS.
Acquisition of a second PE type, PEII, involves comparatively
few additional genes, from six in WH7803, including unk7/8
and unk9, up to twelve genes in type IV chromatic adapters
and RCC307 (mpeA, B, C, D, E, F or G, U, Y, Z and unk7, 8,
and 9), among which the seven underlined genes are novel
PEII genes. The fact that PEII synthesis and regulation processes require fewer genes than for PEI implies that several
genes involved in these processes are common to both PE
forms. This obviously includes the PEB synthesis genes pebA/
B, but likely also a number of lyase genes.

Predicting lyase gene function
Examination of the number, phylogenetic relatedness and
phyletic profiles of all predicted lyase genes (Table 3) can give
us clues about the possible functional specificity of these
enzymes. The number of chromophore binding sites on the αand β-subunits of phycobiliproteins varies from seven in pigment type 1 - that is, four in AP (ApcA, B, D and F subunits
have one each) and three in PC (one in CpcA/RpcA, two in
CpcB/RpcB) - up to eighteen in PEII-containing strains - that
is, four in AP, three in PC, five in PEI (two in CpeA, three in
CpeB) and six in PEII (three in MpeA, three in MpeB) -. Furthermore, it is thought that type IV chromatic adapters can
have either PUB or PEB at two chromophore binding sites of
MpeA [34]. Finally, while the chromophorylation of LCM with
PCB is thought to be auto-catalyzed and, thus, likely does not
require any lyase activity [49], chromophorylation with PUB
of the two to four PEII rod linkers (Table 2) probably requires
one or several specific PUB lyases (or PEB lyase-isomerases).
By comparison, the number of predicted proteins showing
homology to known lyases varies from 3 in blue-green strains
up to 12-13 in RCC307 and chromatic adapters.
All three phycobilin lyases identified in the genomes of Synechococcus spp. WH5701 and RS9917 (Table 3) have characterized homologs in freshwater cyanobacteria. This reduced
set of lyases is most likely sufficient to catalyze the chromophorylation with PCB of all AP and C-PC binding sites.
Indeed, the CpcS lyase (named 'CpeS1' by Zhao and coworkers [51,52]) is active on almost all α-84 and β-84 cysteinyl res-

idues. The only exception is C-PC α-84, chromophorylation of
which is under the control of the heterodimeric lyase CpeE/F
[42,43]. Chromophorylation of the last cysteinyl residue, that
is, C-PC β-155, is catalyzed by another specific lyase, CpcT
[50]. A fairly large difference exists between the sequences
and active sites of the CpcE/F lyase, which binds PCB (a type
1 chromophore carrying a Δ3,31-ethylidene group and a single
bond between C-2 and C-3) to C-PC α-84, and those of the
lyase-isomerase PecE/F, which binds phycobiliviolin (a type
2 chromophore carrying a 3-vinyl group and a Δ2,3-double
bond) to the homolog position of α-phycoerythrocyanin
[47,48]. Thus, the replacement in four Synechococcus strains
(BL107, RS9916, CC9605 and WH8102) of cpeE and cpeF
genes by a fusion gene encoding a PecE/F-like protein (that
we have called RpcG) is quite significant and it is possible that
the PC synthesized by these strains binds a type 2 chromophore at α-84. This interesting hypothesis suggests that a better biochemical characterization of the PC found in these
strains is needed. Finally, in all PEII-containing Synechococcus strains except RCC307 and RS9916, the cpcT gene is
absent (Table 3) and seemingly replaced by a gene of the same
family of paralogs, located in the PC-specific gene cluster
(Figure 4), that we have called rpcT. Given the presence of the
rpcT gene (and absence of cpcT) in Synechococcus sp.
WH7803 in which a PEB is bound at β-153 of R-PCII [16],
RpcT is a plausible candidate for catalyzing this specific
chromophorylation. Surprisingly, RS9916 possesses both
CpcT and RpcT paralogs, suggesting it may either bind PCB or
PEB at this site.
Predicting the function of lyase genes potentially involved in
bilin attachment to PEI and PEII is much more difficult than
for PC, given the larger number of binding sites on these phycobiliproteins. The only lyase gene specific to all PEII-containing strains is mpeY (Table 3 and Figure 4). The PEII αsubunit has one chromophore-binding cysteinyl residue that
has no homolog in its PEI counterpart, α-75. In WH8103 and
white light-grown WH8020, α-75 has been shown to bind a
PUB [18]. We hypothesize that MpeY could be a PUB lyase (or
a PEB lyase-isomerase) involved in the chromophorylation of
PEII α-75 with PUB. However, another specific feature of
PEII complexes is that they are held together with two to four
PUB-chromophorylated linkers (Table 3) so, alternatively,
mpeY might encode a lyase involved in the PUB chromophorylation of one (or several) PEII rod linker(s).
The presence of two additional lyase genes in chromatic
adapters compared to strains exhibiting either pigment types

Genome Biology 2007,

3a or 3c (Table 2) suggests that this more complex lyase complement is required for type IV chromatic adaptation. Indeed,
this process is thought to consist of the reversible exchange of
both PEII α-83 and α-140 chromophores from PEB to PUB
[34], and not in the differential expression of several sets of
phycobiliprotein genes, like in type III chromatic adaptation
(see, for example, [57] for a review). The presence of only one
set of genes encoding PEI and PEII α- and β-subunits in all
genomes of chromatic adapters supports this hypothesis.
Because type IV chromatic adaptation implies the conversion
of a PEII-B into a PEII-C under blue light (and conversely
under white light; Table 1), it is reasonable to assume that
chromatic adapters need two more PUB lyases (or PEB lyaseisomerases) than pigment type 3a strains, which permanently
have PEB at PEII α-83 and α-140, and two more PEB lyases
than pigment type 3c, which permanently have PUB at these
two positions. The phyletic pattern of the mpeV gene (Table
3) which, besides its occurrence in chromatic adapters, is also
present in WH7803 and WH7805 and absent in the high
PUB:PEB strains, suggests it could encode a PEB lyase. Conversely, mpeU has the reverse phyletic profile and, thus, could
encode a PUB lyase (or PEB lyase-isomerase). The specificity
of the putative lyase MpeZ is harder to interpret. Surprisingly,
the complex PBS gene set found in chromatic adapters is
shared by RCC307, which is the sole strain to have pigment
type 3b of all marine Synechococcus strains screened so far.
Indeed, we have determined that all strains except RCC307
described as having a PUB:PEB of approximately 0.7-0.8 by
Fuller et al. [23] are actually chromatic adapters. This
includes strain RCC61 (data not shown), which belongs to the
same phylogenetic clade as RCC307 (that is, clade X) [23].
Therefore, we suggest that RCC307 may have lost the ability
to chromatically adapt, perhaps due to a mutation in a
domain important for lyase activity or the inactivation or loss
of some regulatory gene(s) required for this process.

Predicted models of PBS structures
Most sequenced Synechococcus strains have typical PBS
cores with three AP cylinders. The presence of an additional
LCM domain in CC9311 and RS9916 suggests that their PBS
core may have two additional half-cylinders, as previously
observed in freshwater species such as Nostoc sp. PCC 7120
[58]. It is thought that up to eight rods can be bound to such
a PBS core (Figure 7). The presence of an extended LCM was
previously reported from another chromatic adapter, Synechococcus sp. M16.17 [34] and one may wonder whether such
PBS cores might only occur in this pigment type. An answer
to this question awaits screening of apcE genes (or of the LCM
linker size on LiDS-PAGE gels) in a much wider range of
strains, as well as direct evidence from electron microscopic
images of isolated phycobilisomes.

A through C) (Table 1). The number and nature of rod linker
polypeptides present in the different Synechococcus strains
can help predict the structure of their PBS rods. Given the
striking similarity in pigmentation and gene complement
between the freshwater strains Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942
or Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp.
RS9917, the latter strain likely has a very similar PBS rod
structure [59,60], that is, three C-PC hexamers (Figure 7a,
left). Since Synechococcus sp. WH5701 has one more
(CpcCD-like) rod linker than RS9917 (Table 2), it is possible
that this strain has rods with one additional PC disc (Figure
7a, right).
Like all PE-containing strains, WH7805 lacks the CpcC and
CpcD rod linker polypeptides, the absence of which implies it
has only a single PC hexamer at the base of each PBS rod. This
PC can be of two types depending on strains, C-PC or R-PCIII
(Table 1 and Figure 7b). WH7805 has three PE linkers,
including a homolog of the long, chimeric rod linker MpeD
(Figures 4 and 5) instead of a shorter, CpeD-like linker, like in
F. diplosiphon [61]. Its amino-terminal moiety is very divergent, however, and does not possess the ability to bind a PUB
chromophore, a characteristic common to all PEII rod linkers
(Additional data file 2). In the type III chromatic adapter F.
diplosiphon grown under green light, PBS rods are composed
of one PC and three PE hexamers [15,57]. Since they have a
MpeD-like rod linker equivalent to two typical rod linkers in
length, we suggest that Synechococcus pigment type 2 strains
might have one more PE disc in their rods than F. diplosiphon
(Figure 7b).
In a previous paper, we have proposed a model for the structure of PBS rods of the pigment type 3c strain WH8102, which
we have predicted to have six hexamers: one PC, two PEI and
three PEII [19]. The other high PUB:PEB strain CC9605
appears to have similar PBS rods (Figure 7d). Because it is
missing the (distal) linker gene mpeC, we assume that the
type 3a strain WH7803 has only two PEII hexamers (Figure
7c). Despite the presence of an additional, PEII rod linker
gene (mpeF or mpeG) in chromatic adapters and in RCC307,
we found no evidence by mass spectrometry of any such linkers in PBS preparations from RCC307 and RS9916 (Table 2).
So, it is very unlikely that these strains have more than three
PEII hexamers. Indeed, in this case, they would have a higher
whole cell PUB:PEB under blue light than WH8102 or
CC9605, whereas this ratio is similar or even lower in chromatic adapters (Table 1). It is possible though that under
some specific culture conditions, mpeF or mpeG could be
expressed and that their products could then replace some
other PEII linker in the PBS rods.

New insights into PBS evolution
The large diversity of PBS rod pigmentation observed so far
within the marine Synechococcus group rests on combinations of at least three PC types (C-PC, R-PCII, R-PCIII), two
PEI types (PEI-A/A* and PEI-B) and three PEII types (PEII-

One major finding from our comparative analyses is that the
PBS rod gene complement is highly similar for strains having
the same pigmentation (Figure 4 and Tables 2, 3, 4), independent of their position in 16S rRNA [23], 16S-23S rDNA

Figure 7
Proposed models of PBS structure for the different Synechococcus pigment types and subtypes. PBS cores are generally composed of three cylinders, but in
some chromatic adapters possessing an extended LCM, it is likely composed of two additional half cylinders (see, for example, [58]). In pigment type 1, rods
are composed of C-PC only; in pigment type 2, rods are composed of either C-PC, or R-PCIII and a PEI-like phycobiliprotein; in pigment type 3, rods
comprise R-PC and two PE types (PEI and PEII). Cells of the latter pigment type bind PEB and PUB at a low (3a), medium (3b), high (3c) or variable (3d or
type IV chromatic adapter) ratio. Colored stars indicate the pigment type of each strain (see Figure 1 for color code).

internal transcribed spacer [24] or ribosomal protein phylogenies (Figure 6a), the latter being a proxy for the core genome
phylogeny. This is particularly striking for the two blue-green
strains RS9917 and WH5701 which, though belonging to different subclusters (5.1 and 5.2, respectively, according to
Herdman and co-workers [26]), have a similar gene set and
organization of their PBS rod gene region (Figure 4). Phylogenetic trees based on concatenated PC α- and β-subunit
sequences from all marine Synechococcus also group these
two strains together, well apart from all others, in contrast to
those obtained with concatenated AP protein sequences,
which are globally more consistent with the ribosomal protein phylogeny (Figure 6). Similarly, phylogenies based on
PEI and PEII proteins are congruent with the separation of
PE-containing strains into pigment types 2 and 3 and subtypes 3a-d, as defined in Table 1. Indeed, they group all
chromatic adapters (subtype 3d) together (Figure 6d,e). Furthermore, RCC307 (subtype 3b), which has a similar PBS
gene complement and organization, is always found at the
base of the chromatic adapter group in PE trees, whereas it
appears very distantly related to them in AP trees. Finally,
subtypes 3a and 3c strains are found on distinct branches in
PE trees and are well separated from chromatic adapters.
Altogether, these data suggest that the different components
of the PBS have evolved almost independently from each
other in the marine Synechococcus group. Indeed, the core of
the PBS has seemingly evolved together with the core
genome, suggesting that light energy transport from the PBS
core to photosystem II is an evolutionarily ancient and
conservative mechanism that has not allowed much phenotypic variability during the course of evolution. In contrast,
the rod components appear to have evolved through complex
episodes of gene duplication, lateral gene transfer and/or
gene loss. The latter hypothesis is consistent with recent data
from Haverkamp and co-workers [62] showing that phylogenies based on the cpcB-A and cpeB-A gene sequences notably
differ from phylogeny based on 16S rRNA sequences for a
variety of Synechococcus strains. Acquisition of the first PE (a
PEI-like phycobiliprotein) dates back to before the separation
of the marine Synechococcus/Prochlorococcus branch from
other cyanobacteria and was likely accomplished by duplication and divergence of ancestral PC genes [63]. In contrast,
acquisition of PEII components must have occurred after the
differentiation of the marine Synechococcus lineage, by
duplication and divergence of some PEI genes. Thereafter,
transfer of the PEI and/or PEII rod gene cluster might have
occurred from one lineage of marine Synechococcus to
another, possibly by lateral transfer via natural transformation or viruses. The occurrence of photosynthetic genes is frequent in cyanophages [64] and this may include PBS genes,
such as the putative lyase cpeT gene found in the S-PM2 and
Syn9 genomes [65,66] or the pebA and pcyA genes found in
the P-SSM2 and P-SSM4 genomes [67,68]. So far, only individual photosynthetic genes have been found in such phage
genomes, not gene clusters. However, it is quite possible that,

Volume 8, Issue 12, Article R259

Six et al. R259.18

in some rare cases, much larger genome chunks (for example,
covering the whole PEII sub-region) could be conveyed by
cyanophages between Synechococcus spp. cells belonging to
distinct lineages.

Conclusion

The dazzling colors of marine Synechococcus rely on the combination of a few phycobiliprotein forms, which can be assembled into a variety of PBS structures (Figure 7). The variable
part of these photosynthetic antennae (that is, PBS rods) is
encoded and regulated in large part by a specialized genomic
region, which includes a number of genes of unknown function, but rapid progress in elucidating these functions is
envisaged using a combination of genetic and biochemical
approaches. During the course of evolution, marine Synechococcus appear to have acquired more and more sophisticated light-harvesting complexes, from simple C-PC rods to
elaborate rod structures comprising three distinct phycobiliprotein types. As a further sophistication, some marine
Synechococcus strains are able to modulate their PBS absorption capacity to harvest efficiently a larger range of visible
light quality. In the present study, we show that these type IV
chromatic adapters are much more frequent in culture
collections than previously thought, and this might be the
case in nature as well, since the distribution of this pigment
type in the field is currently unknown. The large diversity of
PBS pigmentation found among marine Synechococcus, as
well as the likely occurrence, during evolution, of PBS gene
exchanges between lineages ensuring that this diversity is
maintained to some extent at the level of individual lineages,
have allowed members of this genus to thrive in almost every
possible illuminated marine environment. This may be one of
the key reasons explaining the ecological success of the Synechococcus group in the marine environment.

Materials and methods
Synechococcus strains and culture conditions
For biochemical analyses, marine Synechococcus spp. strains
Almo3, BL107, CC9605, Oli31, RCC307, RS9912, RS9916,
RS9917, WH5701, WH7803, WH7805, WH8018 and
WH8102 were grown in 8 l polycarbonate flasks (Nalgene,
Rochester, NY, USA) in PCR-S11 medium [69] supplemented
with 5 mM NaNO3. Cultures were grown at 22°C under
approximately 15 μmol photons m-2 s-1 white light (Sylvania
daylight fluorescent bulbs). To determine their PUB:PEB
ratio and their eventual ability to perform type IV chromatic
adaptation [34], two to four duplicate 10 ml cultures of a
number of strains possessing two PEs were grown in parallel
under 15 μmol photons m-2 s-1 white or blue light, prior to
spectrofluorometric analyses made during the exponential
growth phase. Blue light was obtained by wrapping tube racks
with blue filter sheet (filter no. 183 'moonlight', Lee Filters,
Andover, England). The origin of strains has been described
previously [23] except for RCC307 and BL107, which were

respectively isolated from the Mediterranean Sea in June
1999 at 6° 10'E, 39° 10'N at a depth of 15 m by F Partensky and
in September 2000 at 13° 33'E, 41° 43'N at the very deep
depth of 1,800 m by Laure Guillou (Roscoff, France). All these
strains are available from the Roscoff Culture Collection
(RCC), Roscoff, France.

In vivo spectrometry
Room temperature excitation fluorescence spectra (with
emission at 580 nm) of whole Synechococcus cells grown
under standard light conditions were recorded with a spectrofluorimeter LS-50B (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA),
as previously described [32], in order to measure the PUB to
PEB fluorescence excitation ratio. In vivo absorbance spectra
of whole cells were also recorded from 400 to 750 nm with a
double monochromator spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3310)
equipped with a head-on photomultiplier detector. Spectra
were recorded with a 1 nm interval and 5 nm slit width and
normalized at 439 nm (blue absorption peak).

Phycobiliprotein purification and characterization
PE purification was carried out as described previously [19].
Briefly, after cell breakage in a cooled French press system, a
soluble extract devoid of chlorophyll a was obtained by differential ultracentrifugation in a buffer containing 10 mM phosphate pH 7.2 and the protease inhibitors EDTA,
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aminocaproic acid and benzamidine, each at 1 mM final concentration. The soluble protein
extract was then loaded onto a 0-30% sucrose density gradient and run overnight at 130,000 × g at 12°C.
Phycobiliproteins were separated from the different colored
sucrose gradient fractions on 7% acrylamide isoelectric focusing gels containing ampholyte carriers pH 4-6.5 (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). PE bands were cut out of
the gel and crushed with an electric grinder in 10 mM tricine
buffer pH 7.8. Acrylamide remnants were eliminated by centrifugation. When necessary, samples were concentrated
using 30 kDa cut-off membranes (Centricon, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Absorption and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded and corrected as described earlier [19].

Biochimie et Structure des Protéines', Jouy en Josas, France.
Briefly, each gel sample was digested overnight at 37°C in 25
μl trypsin (at 8 μg ml-1). Mass spectra were acquired with a
MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems model Voyager DE super
STR, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with a nitrogen laser
with an emission wavelength of 337 nm and run in reflectron
mode with an extraction delay of 130 ns. The matrix used was
α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid at 4 mg ml-1. Internal calibration was performed with trypsin peptides (842.5090 and
2,211.1040 Da).

Comparative genomics
Eleven genomes of marine Synechococcus spp. were used for
this study: The WH8102 (NC_005070), CC9902
(NC_007513) and CC9605 (NC_007516) genomes have been
sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute, the CC9311
(NC_008319) genome by The Institute for Genome Research
(TIGR), the WH7803 (NC_009481) and RCC307
(NC_009482) genomes by Genoscope (Evry, France) at the
request of a consortium of European scientists coordinated by
F Partensky, the RS9916 (NZ_AAUA00000000), RS9917
(NZ_AANP00000000), BL107 (NZ_AATZ00000000),
WH7805
(NZ_AAOK00000000)
and
WH5701
(NZ_AANO00000000) genomes by the J Craig Venter
Institute in the framework of the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation Marine Microbial Genome Sequencing Project at
the request of an international consortium coordinated by DJ
Scanlan.
Gene families from the 11 marine Synechococcus were delineated using BLAST [70] with an e-value of 10-12 and the
TribeMCL algorithm [71]. Families of orthologous genes
either located in the PBS region and/or involved in PBS biosynthesis or regulation were extracted and manually annotated. Non-modeled genes, missed by ORF finding software,
were added to the dataset. The corresponding protein
sequences were aligned using ClustalW [72] with default
parameters and their amino terminus was corrected (that is,
extended or shortened) if needed.

Phylogenetic analyses
Intact phycobilisome extraction
PBSs were isolated on discontinuous sucrose density gradients in 0.75 M phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitors by the classic sucrose density gradient method [19].
Colored bands were precipitated with 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 3% (w/v) LiDS denaturation
buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out overnight using a 1020% continuous gradient LiDS-PAGE at low amperage (10
mA). After migration, the gel was immersed in 20 mM zinc
acetate in order to enhance phycobiliprotein fluorescence,
washed with water and visualized under UV light, then
stained with Coomassie blue G250. For some selected strains
for which genome sequence was available, bands of linker
polypeptides were cut out of the gel and identified by mass
spectrometry, using the facilities of the 'Unité de Recherche

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using a variable
number of concatenated protein sequences depending on
each phycobiliprotein type (see results), allowing the use of
longer sequences to reduce the variance in the distance estimates [73]. These sequences were automatically aligned
using ClustalW [72]. Alignments were then manually refined
and all gaps and highly variable regions (if any) were
removed. Phylogenetic trees were generated using three different reconstruction methods: NJ (with PHYLO_WIN [74]),
ML (with PHYML v2.4.4 [75]) and MP (with PHYLO_WIN).
ML analyses were performed using the Jones Taylor Thornton model and the variability of substitution rates across sites
and invariables sites was estimated. Bootstrap values (1,000
replicates) were calculated for all three methods in order to
estimate the relative confidence in monophyletic groups and
