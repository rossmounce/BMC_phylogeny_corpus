Abstract
Background: Synonymous sites are freer to vary because of redundancy in genetic code.
Messenger RNA secondary structure restricts this freedom, as revealed by previous findings in
mitochondrial genes that mutations at third codon position nucleotides in helices are more
selected against than those in loops. This motivated us to explore the constraints imposed by
mRNA secondary structure on evolutionary variability at all codon positions in general, in
chloroplast systems.
Results: We found that the evolutionary variability and intrinsic secondary structure stability of
these sequences share an inverse relationship. Simulations of most likely single nucleotide evolution
in Psilotum nudum and Nephroselmis olivacea mRNAs, indicate that helix-forming propensities of
mutated mRNAs are greater than those of the natural mRNAs for short sequences and vice-versa
for long sequences. Moreover, helix-forming propensity estimated by the percentage of total
mRNA in helices increases gradually with mRNA length, saturating beyond 1000 nucleotides.
Protection levels of functionally important sites vary across plants and proteins: r-strategists
minimize mutation costs in large genes; K-strategists do the opposite.
Conclusion: Mrna length presumably predisposes shorter mRNAs to evolve under different
constraints than longer mRNAs. The positive correlation between secondary structure protection
and functional importance of sites suggests that some sites might be conserved due to packingprotection constraints at the nucleic acid level in addition to protein level constraints.
Consequently, nucleic acid secondary structure a priori biases mutations. The converse (exposure
of conserved sites) apparently occurs in a smaller number of cases, indicating a different
evolutionary adaptive strategy in these plants. The differences between the protection levels of
functionally important sites for r- and K-strategists reflect their respective molecular adaptive
strategies. These converge with increasing domestication levels of K-strategists, perhaps because
domestication increases reproductive output.

Background
The structure of the genetic code imposes constraints on

the evolutionary variability of a nucleotide in a gene
sequence, depending on its codon position. The third

codon positions are almost freely variable, because of the
redundancy in the genetic code. The excess variability at
the third codon positions, after accounting for the replication-caused effects could be explained by mRNA secondary structure, in mitochondrial genes [1,2].
Therefore, a third codon position nucleotide in a loop is
more variable than that in a helix. This suggests additional
evolutionary constraints imposed by the mRNA secondary structure, which motivated us to study its relationship
with evolutionary variability. Note that the specific structure of the genetic code maximizes the capacity of coding
regions to form helices in their secondary structure, while
simultaneously also maximizing occurrences of off-frame
stops [3]. While maximizing numbers of off frame stops
minimizes costs of ribosomal slippages [4,5], the rationale for maximizing propensity for secondary structure is
not known. We suggest that it might protect from mutations, and test this hypothesis.
We chose a dataset of chloroplast mRNAs for our secondary structure analyses. This is because regulation of plastid
gene expression during development and in response to
light is of substantial interest in plant biology. Understanding the key factors underlying these processes can
yield important insights that can be used to engineer and
transform plastids [6]. We use mFold, a free-energy minimization algorithm that uses sequence-dependent thermodynamic parameters, for evaluating the sub-optimal
range of secondary structures for chloroplast mRNAs.
We found that the secondary structure stability correlated
negatively with the percentage of variable sites in the gene.
In order to gain further insight on the mRNA secondary
structure and sequence relationship, we decided to simulate sequences by mutating mRNAs at each site according
to their most likely substitution rate category. This categorization for each site was calculated using the 'dnaml' tool
from PHYLIP v. 3.8.0. package. Our simulation analyses
revealed mRNA size as an important factor, which acts as
a flip-flop switch control on how these mutations affected
the secondary structure.
Transcript length has already been reported to be negatively correlated with gene expression level (mRNA abundance), positively with protein divergence in Drosophila
[7] and metabolic cost minimization of protein synthesis
[8], and other factors relevant to molecular evolutionary
ecology [9]. We found that for shorter sequences, a greater
percentage of the secondary structure of mutated mRNAs
is composed of helices, than that for the natural mRNAs.
Whereas for longer sequences, the secondary structure of
mutated mRNAs is composed of lesser percentage of sites
in helices, than that for natural mRNAs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

It is possible that secondary structure (i.e. being part of
helices) usually protects functionally important sites from
mutations. This possibility is also ascertained by the fact
that spontaneous mutations occur more rapidly on singlestranded DNA than double-stranded DNA [10]. This
could bias the mutational spectrum of a gene towards
micro-adaptive changes, as mutations at less important
sites are more likely to produce functional proteins with
slightly altered optima. The opposite is also a potential
adaptation, to increase adaptability to more drastic environmental changes and in life-history. The former fits better species considered as overall K-strategists because it
increases micro-adaptations and niche-specialization,
while the latter fits overall r-strategists, as its costs of
decreasing survival are more likely to be bearable by
organisms with high numbers of off-spring. Our results fit
these general principles, and justify further adequate analyses. This approach towards molecular processes and evolution converges with that described for r- and Kstrategists at whole organism level by Skulachev [11].

Results
Secondary structural folding stability of nucleic acid
sequences modulates their evolutionary variability
We tested for correlations between the length-adjusted
residual stability measure for each gene (see Methods)
and that gene's relative fit to four pre-defined substitution
rate categories (M1, M2, M3 and M4). This estimate of stability correlated positively (Pearson correlation coefficient
r = 0.55, P = 0.0006; rs = 0.54, P = 0.0007; Figure 1A) with
the corresponding gene's percent fit to the slowest substitution rate category M1 and negatively with the percent
fits to faster substitution rate categories M2 (r = -0.60, P =
0.0006; rs = -0.59, P = 0.0002; Figure 1B) and M3 (r = 0.39, P = 0.0408; rs = -0.34, P = 0.05; Figure 1C). Correlations of residual RNA stability with percent fit to the highest rate category M4 were also positive but not statistically
significant (r = 0.30, P = 0.17; rs = 0.37, P = 0.08; Figure
1D) because only 24 out of 35 genes contain sites fitting
M4 category. Overall, these results indicate that the chloroplast sense strand RNA sequences with highly variable
sites fold into less stable secondary structures, and corroborate similar findings in primate mitochondrial protein
coding genes [1,2,12]. The slight differences between the
correlation coefficients for parametric and non-parametric analyses are mainly due to minimization of extreme
data point effects by non-parametric analyses. All P-values
are according to 2-tailed t-tests.

The DNA stability of the sense-strand sequence bore similar significant results with percent fits of the genes to two
among four rate categories (Figure 2). The correlation
coefficients of DNA stability with percent fits to M1, M2,
M3 and M4 were 0.50, P = 0.0024; -0.53, P = 0.0013; 0.34, P = 0.0513 and 0.161, P = 0.474 respectively. Non-

structures that were within 50% optimality of the most stable structure; these average stabilities were further averaged across
all seventeen species. Residuals were calculated by treating length as the independent variable and the negative of stability (ΔG) as the dependent variable (see Methods).

parametric Spearman's rank correlation analyses yielded
significant results for percent fits to M1 (rs = 0.484, P =
0.003), M2 (rs = -0.464, P = 0.005) and M3 (rs = -0.361,
P = 0.033) but not to M4 (rs = 0.224, P = 0.291). It is not
clear whether these subtle differences in the strength and
significance of correlations for the RNA and DNA strands
are due to an inherent difference in the robustness of the
respective folding programs or indeed reflects different
genuine evolutionary interactions between RNA and DNA

secondary structures and sequences. However, the similarity between the trends for RNA and DNA strands confirms
that this correlation is due to effects specific to underlying
single-strandedness. DNA-specific effects might associate
with protection from mutations during single stranded
periods, such as during DNA replication [1,2] or mRNA
transcription [13-17]. The notably stronger RNA-associated effects could relate to protection from decay [18], as

well as alterations of the sequence that would change the
coding properties of the mRNA.
Variability Distribution at Synonymous and Nonsynonymous sites
In order to clearly interpret the above results in the light
of synonymous/non-synonymous site variation, we analyzed the distribution of sites at all three codon positions
among the four chosen substitution rate categories (Figure
3A). The percentage fits to these four categories were aver-

aged across genes, individually for each codon position.
We have plotted these averages along with the standard
deviation bars of these estimates. The non-synonymous
sites, i.e. sites at first or second codon position, are more
prevalent as M1-fitting sites. Second codon positions fit
the M1 category better than first codon positions, as
expected by its greater functional relevance [19]. The third
codon positions are relatively more prevalent as M2-, M3and M4-fitting sites.

Chloroplast mRNAs are GC-rich, more at first and second
codon positions, than at third codon positions, which
contain more A's and T's (Figure 4). The average GC content at the first and second codon position of mRNAs correlates positively with their residual length-adjusted
stability (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rs = 0.65
and 0.48 (P = 0.000 and 0.003, 2-tailed t-tests)) as shown
in Figure 4. The GC content at the third codon position
does not correlate with the residual stability. Overall, this
is compatible with previous finding that a negative correlation exists between substitution rates at the first two
codon positions versus the third codon position, for GC
content [20]. These results confirm that variability that
negatively affects mRNA stability primarily arises at synonymous sites because these sites tend to fit M2, M3 and
M4 more than the non-synonymous sites. The argument
becomes circular: the synonymous sites being GC-poor, a
priori contributed lesser to mRNA stability and thereby,
have lesser evolutionary conservation constraints.
There is considerable variation among genes in the distribution of variability levels at the synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, as indicated by the standard deviation
bars. Our conclusion qualitatively remains the same even
after separately analyzing this average distribution for
individual genes (Figure 3B). However, the variability distributions for individual genes reveal slightly distinct patterns between the photosystem subunits and the

genes, 71% and 86% of first and second codon position
sites fit M1, whereas in ribosomal protein and ATPase
subunits, these are 55% and 63% respectively. As a result,
fits to the higher variability categories M2 and M3 were
approximately 1.5–2 and 1.9–6 fold respectively, at the
first and second codon positions, for the ATPase and
ribosomal protein subunits than for the photosystem
genes (M2; M3 fits for the ATPase and ribosomal proteins:

Local changes in secondary structure upon mutations in
Psilotum nudum and Nephroselmis olivacea: Effects of
mRNA size
We compared helix-forming propensities from nine
mRNAs of different lengths in Psilotum nudum and Nephroselmis olivacea among natural, mutated and randomized
sequences (see Methods for details). These comparisons
were performed after considering all the sites together as
well as separately, based on the rate category of sites: M1, M2-, M3-, and M4-fitting (see Figures 5A–D and Additional File 1). Only three genes (psbA, petA and rpS3)
contained sites that fit the M4 category, and therefore, it
was not possible to show the trend in this case.

In general, for all types of sequences (natural, mutated
and random), the helix-forming propensities of mRNAs
increase with length of the mRNA up to a given length and
then saturate for longer mRNAs, as indicated by the gradual logarithmic trend (see Figures 5A–D and Additional
File 1). The overall integral stabilities (-ΔGs) of mRNAs
follow a linear trend versus the size of the mRNA (see
Additional File 2) but the average percentage of sites in
these mRNAs that form helices correlate logarithmically
with integral mRNA stability (see Additional File 2). This
explains the saturation effect we observe in Figure 5 (and
Additional File 1; see Discussion). Upon mutating mRNA
sequences under the four site-specific substitution rate
categories (M1, M2, M3, and M4) and imposing transition: transversion bias of 2:1, we found that the difference
between the overall helix-forming propensities of
mutated and natural mRNAs varies according to their size.
The mutated mRNA helix-forming propensity is greater
than that of the natural mRNAs for shorter transcript sizes,
and the trend reverses for longer mRNAs thus generating
a crossover point in the correlation trend (see Figures
5A–D and Additional File 1). The difference between the
natural and mutated helix-forming propensity curves is
significant for all sites considered together (t = 3.155, P =
0.016; 2-tailed t-test) as well as for M1-fitting sites (t =
2.719, P = 0.030; 2-tailed t-test), but not for the sites fitting the remaining rate categories. The differences
between natural and random or between random and

mutated helix-forming propensities are not significant for
any of the cases, not even for the entire mRNA. This is particularly interesting, considering that mutating sequences
results on average, 17% nucleotide changes, whereas randomizations result in 73% nucleotide changes (very close
to the expected 75% changes when considering each
nucleotide as equi-probable) as compared to the original
mRNA sequence. These length-dependent randomization
effects on RNA secondary structures might explain contradictions in the field on effects of sequence randomization
on RNA folding stabilities. Some report greater stability
for natural than randomized mRNA sequences [21], while
some report contrarily [22].
Protection from mutations at gene levels
The correlations between evolutionary variability of sites
and stemminess of those sites for the 35 homologous
genes in all seventeen chloroplast genomes are described
in a table (see Additional File 3). In a statistically significant majority of genes (23 among 35, P < 0.05 according
to 1-tailed sign test), conserved sites form more secondary
structure than variable sites. This tendency was significant
for 11 specific genes (atpH, clpP, psaA, psaB, psbA, psbB,
psbC, psbD, rps19, rps2, rps8), which is more than 6
times the 1.75 statistically significant results expected
according to the multiplicity of tests at P < 0.05. In four
genes (petA, rpl14, RNApolB, rps18), the opposite was
true: in most plant species, evolutionary conserved sites
had lesser helix-forming propensity than other sites. This
number is also twice more than the expected number of
false positive results at P < 0.05. Hence, results suggest that
in a majority of cases, sites coding for functionally important (low variability) protein regions are protected from
mutations by mRNA secondary structure (high stemminess, see Methods section for definition), but that in specific cases, also the opposite occurs. Statistically, positive
and negative associations between site conservation and
formation of stems can be considered as existing and are
not artifacts.

We did not detect significant differences between these
associations for genes coded on the sense strand versus
those coded on the anti-sense strand, not even for any particular species, despite the differences between the nucleotide contents for these strands.
The correlations between site variability and helix-formation was significant at P < 0.05 (2 tailed tests, both directions) in 51 among 595 (8.57%, 36 cases negative
(protecting conserved sites), 15 cases positive (exposing
them)) mRNA-species combinations, which is twice the
2.5% expected by pure chance for negative, but barely
more (2.752%) for positive correlations. If hypotheses
were available for expecting the direction of these correlations and one tailed tests were used, 27 and 58 cases

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

would be significantly positive and negative, respectively.
This number is more than expected by pure chance for
negative correlations, but not for positive ones. However,
it is clear that some mRNAs have more significant correlations than expected, and others avoid them, including for
positive ones. Indeed, a binomial distribution would
expect in these conditions, 16.6% of the mRNAs to have
no significant correlation in any of the 17 species, but in
fact 34.28% (12 out of 35) of the mRNAs had no significant correlations in any species. On the other hand, there
were several specific mRNAs, for which more species bore
significant (p < 0.05) correlations than expected by a
binomial distribution. This result suggests that in some
mRNAs, evolutionary pressures tend to create such correlations, and in others, pressures prevent them. Considering that results suggest the existence of two forces, one
occasionally causing positive, and another occasionally
negative associations at the level of whole mRNA
sequences, one should not be surprised that in a larger
than expected number of cases, balance between forces
results in no or low, non-significant correlations between
site-specific mRNA secondary structure and variability levels. These principles were also qualitatively correct while
considering numbers of significant cases according to one
tailed tests, separately for positive and negative associations. Hence, some specific mRNAs tend towards negative
(protecting conserved sites against mutations), a smaller
group towards positive (exposing conserved sites to mutations), and a third group towards no association between
secondary structure and site conservation (which could
also mean a mixture of the two previous strategies for different regions of the same mRNA). Investigating the
rationale behind this trimodal distribution of mRNAs is
beyond the scope of this project, but suggests different
adaptive strategies for different protein groups, and for
different types of sites or amino acids. Results also suggest
that the pressures causing associations between mRNA
secondary structure formation and site conservation are
ubiquitous, and exist also in mRNAs where no association
is detected due to balancing forces.
Protection from mutations at species levels
At the level of species, evolutionary variability of sites
associated negatively with stemminess in a statistically significant majority of mRNAs for 14 among 17 species (sign
test, P < 0.05). At the level of single species, this tendency
was significant at P < 0.05 (1-tailed test) for
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris, Mesostigma
viride, Physcomitella patens patens, Triticum aestivum and
Psilotum nudum, which is more than the number of species
expected by pure chance. There was no species for which
a significant number of mRNAs had the opposite association. Calycanthus floridus was the most extreme in this
direction, with 40% of its mRNAs showing the positive
association between evolutionary variability at a site and

Page 8 of 18

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:48

stem formation by that site. There was no species for
which no mRNA had a significant correlation between site
variability and helix-formation, which is less than what
would be expected. There were more species with no significant positive correlations between site variability and
helix-formation than expected, which suggests that in
some species, strong positive correlations are avoided
(exposing conserved sites to mutations is avoided). There
were lesser species with no significant negative correlations between site variability and stem formation than
expected, which suggests that some species tend to have
many strong negative correlations (protection of conserved sites from mutations). These results suggest that
protein types and plant species vary with respect to correlations between site conservation and helix-formation. In
some cases, exposure to, rather than protection from
mutations, is evolutionary adaptive, at least in some
mRNAs, such as RNApolB, where there was a positive correlation in 15 among 17 species, statistically significant at
P = 0.05 (2 tailed t-test) for 7 species.
We found that overall, protection from mutations
decreases with gene length by calculating the correlation
between gene length and the correlation coefficient
between site variability and helix-formation for that gene.
This correlation was positive for 31 among 35 mRNAs (p
< 0.05, sign test), and significant according to a two tailed
test for 6 mRNAs, among which none is negative. Hence,
overall, for homologous genes, the extent of protection of
conserved sites decreases with gene length. A superficial
look at these results could suggest that the lower correlations for longer mRNAs are due to lower accuracy of
mFold predictions for longer sequences. According to this
rationale, the longer mRNA homologues would have the
least negative t values for correlations between site variability and helix-formation, and these would be close to
zero (meaning low statistical significance, presumably
due to prediction inaccuracies).
However, this rationale does not hold; in several mRNA
species where the decrease with gene length was significant, the longer mRNA homologues do not have t statistics that are closer to zero or have low statistical
significances, but they are often positive and sometimes,
even statistically significant (see for example rpl20 and
petL). This result is not compatible with random errors
due to folding inaccuracies, and hence the hypothesis that
prediction inaccuracies increasing with sequence length
can explain these results seems less likely than the one
indicating that these results reflect biological phenomena.
It is possible that the decreased correlations for longer
homologues reflect that their greater lengths are not due
to additions of functionally necessary regions, such as catalytic sites, but perhaps, due to addition of sites with spe-

cies-specific regulatory functions, or with no or little
functional importance.
At the level of single species, across genes, the level of protection of conserved sites decreased with gene length in 11
species, significantly so, for Spinacea oleracea and Adiantum capillus-veneris. This was more the case for larger "vascular" plants that can be considered broadly as Kstrategists as compared to "micro" plants (algae, bryophytes, etc..., t test, P < 0.05). Within vascular plants, these
tendencies decreased with levels of domestication for 20
among 35 genes, significantly so at P < 0.05 for 7 genes
and increased significantly only in one mRNA (Spearman
rank correlations, 2 tailed tests).
This suggests that artificial selection made genes of these
relatively K-strategy oriented plants resemble more those
of r-strategists. Overall, these tendencies are clearer while
considering data across species for specific mRNAs than
while analyzing across mRNAs for specific species, but the
same principles are valid at both levels, although weaker
for species-specific analyses. Hence, results suggest more
mRNA-specific adaptations than species-specific ones.

Discussion
Accuracy and inaccuracy of Folding Prediction Programs
The assumption that secondary structure predictions are
essentially accurate is central to this study, and hence it is
worth dwelling on some evidence justifying it. We will
also discuss subsequently how the known inaccuracies of
folding prediction programs are unlikely to bias our
results.

Real functional RNAs are known to and also predicted to
have fewer alternative structures than randomized
sequences [23,24]. This already establishes a level of realism in the details of the predictions. A prediction accuracy
of 90% reported for intermolecular hybridization of
RNAs, indicates at least a similar accuracy for our simpler
case of intra-molecular RNA hybridization [25,26]. Combinations of free energy minimization and comparative
sequence analysis as used here, are more effective in
enhancing structure prediction accuracy by finding a common low free energy structure [27-29].
Inaccuracy in secondary structure prediction algorithms is
more prominent while having to predict a unique functional structure and is in fact minimized while considering a distribution of sub-optimal secondary structures.
Nevertheless, at least in some cases where secondary structure was experimentally authenticated, specific local stemloop structures are accurately predicted by folding programs for functionally important secondary structure
components in chloroplast mRNAs [30]. In addition,
structural predictions become more inaccurate with

increase in the length of the sequences because of the concomitant increase in possible folds for longer RNAs and in
particular, when the contact distance between the base
pairs exceeds 100 nucleotides [31]. In theory, a Boltzmann's ensemble of secondary structures, predicted by
programs such as Sfold [32,33] and Vienna [34,35] would
better reflect the population of structures for any given
mRNA. However, the temperature of plants is widely
determined by their environment. The properties of the
distribution of secondary structures are determined by
temperature. Hence, precise calculations using Boltzmann's distribution should integrate temperatures over
the range and frequency encountered by each plant species in its natural environment. Therefore, while calculations using Sfold's Boltzmann distribution predictions are
more precise and preferable for homeotherms, less accurate calculations apparently perform equally well for
poikilotherms: predictions of tRNA structures by mFold
and Sfold in poikilothermic lizards yield similar results
[36].
There are other factors that are not accounted by classical
secondary structure prediction algorithms. One of them is
the formation of protein-mRNA complexes (including in
chloroplasts, [37]). The other is the formation of noncanonical base pairs participating in the functional secondary structure of crucially important RNAs [38]. These
considerations are important and not considering them
probably adds noise to the analyses we present. In other
words, if it was possible to integrate in our analyses accurate information on secondary structure stabilization via
complex formation with proteins, and/or on non-canonical base pairs, we would detect more statistically significant results than what we can detect now. It is much less
likely that including that information would prevent
observing the patterns we describe. However, if it was so,
this would mean that these additional interactions (such
as complex formation with proteins) are designed to prevent the patterns we describe. In that case, these would be
two counter-balancing mechanisms, each important for
RNA function and worth describing. It is also clear that
even RNAs that form complexes with proteins are only
part of the time in such complexes, and hence our results
might be relevant in this more restricted context for some
of the RNAs. The relevance of non-canonical base pairings
to our specific issue is lesser: such base pairings have been
described until now mainly in rRNAs and other RNA molecules where RNA and its secondary structure play a prime
functional role. It is unlikely that this is a major factor for
typical mRNAs, because their function is probably less
confined to specific secondary structures, but rather more
to group of alternative, closely related secondary structures with relatively low folding stabilities. However, it
makes sense to consider that in yet not described specific
cases, non-canonical base pairings may play an important

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

role in determining the secondary structure and therefore,
function of the mRNA. The roles for mRNA secondary
structure that we detect, while considering the simpler scenario without non-canonical base pairings, only ascertain
that further accurate secondary structure predictions
would be very valuable to better understand RNA biology,
especially while integrating cellular and whole organism
level physiologies with evolutionary perspectives.
Secondary structural stability modulates Sequence
Variability
We do not detect significant correlations between integral
mRNA stability and transcript's evolutionary variability.
This might be because evolutionary variability, quantified
by a percentage is already size-adjusted, while integral stability is not.

However, integral and length adjusted residual stabilities
increase with the absolute number of sites fitting each
substitution rate categories (see Additional File 4; integral
stability: Spearman's rank correlation coefficients rs =
0.952, 0.821, 0.797 and 0.905; residual stability: rs =
0.684, 0.578, 0.531 (P = 0.001) and 0.535 (P = 0.001) for
M1, M2, M3 and M4 respectively). This result, for the
least, stresses that the evolution of RNA stability is in part
explained by length, and mostly by the content and context-dependent component of the RNA. It is very unlikely
that qualitatively our conclusions are due to artifacts
(increase in inaccuracies of mFold predictions with RNA
length), because correlations between evolutionary variability and both stabilities (integral and size adjusted) yield
similar results.
Evolutionary variability (percentage of sites fitting M2 and
M3 categories) of nucleotide sequences decreases with
residual, length-adjusted stability of the gene, when
folded as RNA and DNA. This would indicate that the
helix-forming regions accumulate lesser mutations than
loops [1,2,12], which is in agreement with the positive
correlation observed between presence of structural
motifs and thermodynamic secondary structure stability
[39]. The M1-fitting sites are significantly over-represented at the first and second codon positions than at the
third codon positions, whereas the M2-, M3-, and M4-fitting sites are relatively over-represented at the third codon
positions (Figure 3A). The relatively high GC content at
the first and second codon positions (Figure 4), explains
well the positive correlation between the % M1-fitting
sites and secondary structural stability. Similarly, the negative correlations of secondary structure stability with M2and M3-fitting sites can be explained by the lower G+C
content at the third codon positions. The relative AT richness at the third codon positions has been reported to be
caused by codon usage bias in newly reported chloroplast
genomes of Nuphar advena and Ranunculus macranthus

species [40] as well as in angiosperms like Oryza sativa, Zea
mays, Triticum aestivum and Arabidopsis thaliana [41].
Codon usage bias is known to impose a variety of functional constraints by favoring increase mRNA stability
[42], altered splicing [43,44], hidden stop-codon formation [45] and translational efficiency/gene expression
often in relation to codon-anticodon matching frequencies from existing tRNA pool [46-51]. It is also known to
be controlled by genome-wide mutational constraints,
probably due to underlying molecular processes [52,53].
This suggests that codon usage bias may also be acting as
a concerted component in shaping the positive association between RNA secondary structural stability and evolutionary variability.
Although our analyses yield similar negative correlations
between sequence variability and folding stabilities for
both RNA as well as DNA, we will be primarily discussing
our results in the context of RNA. We do this because the
steady state level of RNA in a cell is likely to be much
higher than that of single-stranded DNA. Further, the
DNA folding program of mFold server [54,55] is currently
not as well developed as the RNA version in terms of its
incorporation of thermodynamic parameters and hence,
stabilities obtained from the two versions are not comparable. In a study testing the mutational robustness of over
1000 naturally and artificially selected RNA structures,
mutation-proneness correlated negatively with thermodynamic stability in the selected RNA molecules [56]. Our
observed negative correlation of sequence variability with
secondary structure stability is highly consistent with their
results. These non-intuitive results suggest the acquisition
of DNA mutations by the RNA during transcription,
thereby affecting its intrinsic stability, half-life, and ultimately, protein turnover. These properties strongly suggest that RNA stability is intimately connected with the
functional regulation of the molecule in the cell.
Effects of mRNA length on mutational stability of
secondary structure
We examined the effect of mRNA length on its mutational
stability in a randomly chosen species, Psilotum nudum,
and for assessing generality of results, a species distantly
related to it, Nephroselmis olivacea. In both species, mRNA
length associates with mutational stability (see Figure 5
and Additional File 1). Structural RNAs such as ribosomal
and nucleolar spliceosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs have
a lower stability than a random RNA sequence with the
same dinucleotide frequency [57]. In our analyses of the
mutational stability of chloroplast mRNAs and the nonrandomness in intrinsic mRNA stability, it is possible that
the smaller mRNAs behave like tRNAs or structural RNAs
and yield a similar stability response. This speculation is
because of the lower helix-forming propensity of the natural short sequences as compared to the mutated ones

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

(Figure 5A–D). In Drosophila, mRNA abundance was
found to be negatively correlated with transcript size [7].
It is possible that these shorter chloroplast mRNAs are
also more abundant and their relatively low stability
works in down-regulating their half lives, thereby enabling their pool sizes to stoichiometrically match with
those of the lesser abundant but more stable longer transcripts in the same functional complexes. Another interesting component of this result is the logarithmic
relationship of average helix-forming propensity of
mRNAs with overall mRNA stabilities as well as mRNA
lengths (see Figure 5, Additional Files 1 and 2). This
means that for mRNAs with lengths beyond a certain
limit, the excess length does not contribute towards
increasing the helical component of the mRNA, reflecting
the need for a certain critical portion of the sequence in
loops such that a dynamic structural state can be established vis-à-vis the function. This result has to be considered with caution, because secondary structure
predictions are less accurate for long sequences. However,
a similar saturating relationship between the integral stability of the mRNA with the helix-forming propensity of
that mRNA suggests that this is less likely to be an artifact
due to inaccuracies in folding prediction. One could reason that the pattern we observe is species-specific and that
other plant genomes might follow different trends, but
then the probability of observing a similar response in
two phylogenetically distant species is very low. Saturation levels of helix-forming propensity are consistently
around 60–65% in both species. Based on this, we surmise that the logarithmic trend is likely to be general.
Additionally, the thermodynamics of secondary structure
folding are such that helix-formation decreases enthalpy
of the system and is therefore, favored. This is seen in the
form of increasing helix-forming propensity with transcript length. Helix-formation, however, also decreases
the entropy of the intermediate looped out regions, which
becomes the limiting factor at certain mRNA lengths. Further, the kinetics driven by the folding thermodynamics
would less favor base-pairing between nucleotides distantly placed from one another on the linear sequence.
Pairings between such distantly placed nucleotides might
occur but would be unstable and therefore, will not hold.
This explains the saturation limit on helix-forming propensity in long mRNAs. Indeed, studies have shown that
conformational order present in evolved structures need
not arise due to evolutionary optimization, but simply
due to intrinsic folding rules of RNA polymers [58]. This
is reiterated by the overall similarity between logarithmic
trends in helix-forming propensities of mutated and natural mRNAs versus their lengths, despite differences in the
details of the trends.

Protection from Mutations
The simplest explanation for the positive correlation
between secondary structure and evolutionary conservation of a site is that being part of helices protects those
nucleotide regions from mutations. This mechanism is
most critical in the functionally important parts of the
protein. This protection may occur both in mRNAs and, as
indicated by results, single-stranded DNA during replication. There exists the possibility of a feedback loop: sites
that are conserved due to functional constraints will tend
to have more secondary structure. This in turn will lead to
fewer mutations and therefore, greater conservation. This
would result from stabilizing selection for optimal secondary structure(s) because detrimental mutations
(resulting in sub-optimal structures) are selected against.
In addition, some sites should also be more constrained
than others because they are complementary to functionally conserved sites. Hence, some highly conserved sites
might be so, not because of their functional importance in
the protein, but as part of packing-protection constraints
in the mRNA or DNA during single stranded periods. This
probable effect at the level of DNA suggests that substitutions are non-randomly distributed with respect to their
functional impacts. Hence, the protecting mechanisms
that we describe here bias the distribution of mutations
towards favorable ones. If correct, this mechanism results
in a pattern of adaptive evolution where the secondary
structure of nucleic acid sequences, prior to natural selection, filters mutations, a pattern that follows neo-Lamarckian principles because the spectrum of potential
mutations is a priori biased. This likelihood of this mechanism especially increases while viewing our observation
in light of the fact that spontaneous chemical changes
occur at a greater rate on single- than double-stranded
RNA, quite analogous to mutations on DNA [10]. This
means that secondary structure simply by virtue of causing certain regions to be duplex versus certain others,
results in low and high mutation regimes. This scenario,
where secondary structure also involves evolutionary conservation, is therefore, a relatively adaptive one, as compared to one where this association was absent, where
detrimental mutations are not only minimized but also
certain beneficial mutations are allowed. Thereby, a
mechanism evolves where structure biases the mutational
distribution in a way that the positive effects of mutations
are more likely. We term this as 'Lamarckian'. It is interesting to note that this pattern could arise, as noted above,
from stabilizing selection for an optimal secondary structure, which secondarily would result in a functionally
biased mutation spectrum for RNA or DNA coding for
proteins.
Molecular aspects of life history strategies
We found three types of mRNA species in respect to associations between site conservation and formation of sec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

ondary structure: those protecting conserved sites from
mutations, a smaller group exposing them, and a group
where presumably the pressures leading to the former two
types are balanced, resulting in more than expected statistically non-significant cases. This suggests that in all
mRNAs, and especially in the latter group, both types of
strategies exist at different sites in the same mRNA. These
might associate with amino acids and protein domains, as
well as their function. More detailed analyses at this level
could reveal the adaptive strategies for different types of
sites and proteins, whether adaptive evolution occurs
there by drastic or gradual changes. It is possible that protection of conserved sites promotes gradual adaptive evolution. Their exposure probably causes mutations that are
very detrimental, majority of which are filtered out by natural selection and the remaining few which are likely to
affect function, might promote saltatory evolution. Since
ample sequence data are available, future explorative
analyses focused on this issue will surely lead to deeper
insights into mRNA and protein functions, and their
adaptive evolutionary strategies.
While at the level of mRNA species, we do not yet understand the rationale behind the different types of correlations observed between site variability and stemminess,
our preliminary analyses reveal some clues at the level of
plant species. However, note that in principle, analyses
considering phylogenetic relatedness and larger species
numbers are required for assessing the phenomena we
preliminarily describe here below. We find that for 66% of
mRNAs, 'r-strategist' species protect the conserved sites
more than 'K' species. This tendency is significant at P <
0.05 (2 tailed t tests) for one mRNA, psbL, but reversed in
psbK. These results indicate that minimization of mutations are higher in relatively smaller plants (r-strategists),
following the general principles of minimization of metabolic costs [8]. In the same plants, this tendency is particularly strong for large mRNAs, which suggests that cost
minimization is enhanced for synthesis of costly (large)
proteins. The opposite is true for plants which are relatively more K-strategists. If one considers that exposing
functionally conserved sites to mutations is a strategy that
favors saltatory evolution, and that small proteins have
more regulatory and large ones more catalytic, basic maintenance functions, then this suggests that r-strategists
maximize evolutionary potential for regulatory functions,
but are relatively conservative at the level of house keeping functions. We find that the opposite is true for K-strategists. These results are in line with the view that the large
numbers of offspring in r strategists enable many unsuccessful evolutionary "experiments" to be done at the level
of regulatory functions, while this approach is not tenable
for large plants with low offspring numbers.

Page 12 of 18

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:48

Experimenting with large proteins is however more cost
effective in K-strategists with large body sizes, because
they have the reserves that enable them to cope with such
costs, including the death of body parts, without killing
the individual. The results on associations with domestication level, which suggest that the molecular evolutionary strategy of naturally K-selected plants becomes more rlike by domestication, presumably because domestication
increases reproductive output, are more speculative. This
is not only because our rankings of domestication levels
between different species are difficult to justify in a formal
way, but also because these analyses should be done separately on different groups of plants, such as eudicotyledons and others, or plants grown for their seeds versus
those grown for other edible body parts. However, as the
majority of domesticated plants are selected for increased
reproductive output, the convergence between natural rstrategists and domestication in K-strategists seems plausible. It also strengthens the hypothesis that molecular
adaptive evolutionary strategies (protecting or exposing
functionally important sites to mutations) associates with
relative investments in reproduction.

Conclusion
1. High sequence variability, particularly at third codon
positions, inversely correlates with length adjusted messenger RNA stability, highlighting the functional and nonneutral aspects of synonymous site variation. This is also
in line with synonymous codon usage bias which favors
AT-richness at third codon positions.
2. In silico mutations of mRNAs results in destabilization
of longer mRNAs but not of shorter mRNAs, which could
explain apparently contradictory results in change in folding stabilities upon randomization of RNAs.
3. Our analyses also reveal transcript length as an important factor, which coupled with evolutionary variability
controls secondary structure stability. This insight could
substantially contribute to RNA sequence and structure
optimization studies that did not consider the effects of
RNA length.
4. Some highly conserved sites might be so not because of
their functional importance in the protein, but as part of
packing-protection constraints at the nucleic acid level.
5. Protection by secondary structure from mutations
results in a pattern of adaptive evolution where the secondary structure of nucleic acid sequences prevents detrimental mutations, prior to or in addition to stabilizing
selection on optimal secondary structures, a pattern that
follows neo-Lamarckian principles.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

6. In specific mRNAs for some plants, functionally conserved sites are exposed to smutations, which might lead
to saltatory adaptive evolution.
7. Protection from mutations at conserved sites is more
widespread in r-strategists than K-strategists, perhaps
because of greater mutation minimization pressures in
smaller organisms.
8. The above point is enhanced in r-strategists for large
proteins, and for smaller proteins in K-strategists. This
might reflect adaptive strategies, the first leading to saltatory evolution in r-strategists, the other to gradual adaptive specialization in K-strategists.
9. Among K-strategists, domestication causes them to
resemble r-strategists in terms of molecular adaptive strategies.

RNA-synthesis (sense) strand sequences were extracted
from NCBI [59] using in-house PERL scripts for thirty-five

psbA, psbD, psaJ, clp, atpF, psbC, rpl32, psbI, and rps8) of
17 plant species (Oryza sativa (japonica cultivargroup)
(NC_001320; [60]); Triticum aestivum (NC_002762;
[61]); Zea mays (NC_001666; [62]); Calycanthus floridus

oleracea (NC_002202; [75]) and Adiantum capillus-veneris
(NC_004766; [76]) belonging to the family Viridiplantae.

We considered as the anti-sense (coding) strand, the
strand that coded for a majority of 23 out of 35 sampled
genes. For the 12 sense-stranded coded genes (clpP, psbE,
psbF, petL, petA, psaJ, psbC, psbB, psbD, psbK, psbH,
rps18), we considered the sequence as it is and for the
remaining genes (atpI, atpF, atpH, atpB, atpE, psaA, psaB,
psaC, psbA, psbL, psbN, psbI, rpoB, rpl14, rpl16, rpl20,
rpl32, rps11, rps19, rps2, rps3, rps7, rps8), we analyzed
the reverse complementary sequence. This combination
of 17 species and 35 genes was chosen because it consists
of an ample number of species and at the same time, a sufficiently large number of homologous genes (concatenated alignment of 27,465 nucleotides) for building the

chloroplast phylogeny. We used ClustalW [77] for individually aligning the protein-coding genes, and further,
concatenated them to create the necessary dataset for
building a phylogeny. Our homology definition criteria
included both paralogous as well as orthologous genes,
and were judged purely on the basis of NCBI annotations
of genes. The phylogeny we used here is shown in Figure
6 along with bootstrap values.
mRNA secondary structure and stability
The sense strand (RNA-like) sequences of all thirty-five
genes were folded as RNA as well as DNA using RNA and
DNA folding programs, respectively, from mFold server
[54,78]. We recorded the negative of the free energy (-ΔG;
delta-G in kcal/mol) of the folded structures, which we
will refer to as integral stability. All alternative structures
within 50% sub-optimality of the most stable structure

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

were considered and the average ΔG over all these structures was computed.
We assumed that doing so would yield a fairly realistic
ΔG, minimize the effects of inaccurate predictions by
mFold and reduce sampling bias. This average estimate
was further averaged across all the seventeen species, for
each mRNA. The secondary structure stability of the
mRNA is highly correlated with mRNA length (r = 0.99,
see Additional File 2). Therefore, we calculated residual
ΔG by performing linear regression between mRNA
length as the independent variable and average (-ΔG) as
dependent variable. We deducted the value predicted by
this linear relationship of -ΔG with mRNA length from the
observed average (-ΔG). This residual ΔG quantifies the
intrinsic stability due to the information contained in the
mRNA or DNA sequence, independent of the length of the
sequence. It is therefore, comparable across mRNAs of dif-

Chloroplast phylogeny of seventeen plant species. Phylogeny was calculated by using nucleotide sequence alignments of
35 genes from dataset IV. The branch lengths indicate the relative number of substitutions per site. Non-embryophytic land
plants (Mesostigma viride, Chaetosphaeridium globosum, Nephroselmis olivacea, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Chlorella vulgaris)
were defined as out groups and phylogeny was rooted using them. Bootstrap values indicating branch support are marked next
to the branches. Bootstrapping was done by generating 100 replicates of the dataset using "seqboot" program in PHYLIP v.3.67.
Phylogenies were generated from these replicates again using the "dnaml" criterion and then drawing a consensus using "consense" option.

ferent lengths. This is the estimate of stability which we
use for all our analyses and we will refer to it as lengthadjusted residual stability. The evolutionary significance
of residual over integral stability is further clarified in the
Discussion section.
Site-specific evolutionary variability measures for genes
Phylogeny was inferred using "dnaml" program in
PHYLIP v 3.8.1 [79] on the concatenated nucleotide
sequence alignment of thirty-five genes across 17 species.
The bootstrapped phylogeny used to infer site-specific
evolutionary variability levels is shown in Figure 6). Four
average substitution rate categories were chosen: M1 (λ =
0.1); M2 (λ = 0.2); M3 (λ = 0.3) and M4 (λ = 0.4) based
on prior probabilistic indications of site-specific average
rates by Hidden Markov Models while inferring the phylogeny. We obtained individually for each gene, the relative most likely fits to these four rate categories for all the
35 genes using the maximum likelihood approach of
"dnaml" program. The read-out we got from this tool was
for example, as follows: 30% of the sites in a gene fits rate
category M1 while 50% of the gene fits category M2.

We also compared these substitution rate category fits to
read-outs obtained using another model available within
a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain framework [80,81].
This approach accounts for scenarios where sites can
evolve in qualitatively different ways, i.e. follow pattern
heterogeneity in addition to evolving at different rates. We
found that the fits of sites to these substitution patterns
correlated significantly in the expected direction with
%fits of sites to the above mentioned rate categories from
PHYLIP (see Additional File 5)
We used Pearson's correlation coefficients to estimate the
strength of the correlation between site variability and secondary structure (termed "stemminess") at the site, for
each gene in each species. We also used the more robust
and conservative Spearman's non-parametric rank correlation test, in addition to the parametric test, to estimate
correlations between sequence variability and folding stability.
Simulating evolution of mRNA sequences
In order to study the effect of sequence variability on
mRNA stability, specifically, in terms of helix-forming
propensity, we introduced mutations in the mRNAs of a
randomly chosen species, Psilotum nudum and of another
species, phylogenetically distant from it, Nephroselmis olivacea. We chose to calculate the helix-forming propensity
in our primary measure of stability (ΔG) in order to
explore how mutations affect sites with different levels of
evolutionary variability in terms of their propensities to
form helices or to be part of loops. Mutations were introduced in silico by changing the nucleotide at each site with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/48

a probability proportional to a substitution rate category
that it best fits to (M1, M2, M3 or M4), obtained from
PHYLIP v 3.8, along with a transition:transversion bias of
2:1. Fifty such mutation rounds were performed for each
mRNA to yield fifty mutated sequences. Helix-forming
propensities were averaged across all the fifty mutants to
generate a single value representing the mutated mRNA
helix-forming propensity. This process mutated on average 17% of the nucleotides in each sequence.
We compared the helix-forming propensities of natural
mRNAs with those of the mutants, vis-à-vis mRNA length,
for all sites as well as separately for each variability category of sites for the two species, Psilotum nudum and Nephroselmis olivacea. For these analyses, we sampled nine
mRNAs of different lengths: psbF (120 bases), psbK (177
bases), rps18 (227 bases), rps9 (278 bases), rpl14 (368
bases), rps3 (641 bases), petA (965 bases), psbB (1526
bases) and psaA (2244 bases) and studied the change in
helix-forming propensity upon mutations across different
mRNA lengths. We also include in our comparisons,
helix-forming propensities of randomized mRNAs of the
same length.
Fifty mononucleotide randomizations were performed
for each of the nine mRNAs and their helix-forming propensities were averaged over these fifty simulated
sequences (see [54] for a justification of single base-shuffling randomization approach)
Life history strategies and domestication
We defined all species belonging to Spermatophyta as relatively fitting the K-strategists life history strategy, due to
their larger sizes, longevities, and lower offspring numbers.

This group also includes the large fern species of our sample. Other non-Spermatophyte plants, which were of relatively smaller sizes and longevities, and larger offspring
numbers, were considered from an ecological point of
view as relatively r-strategists (see for review of the concepts [82]). Body size, as a factor for classifying K- and rstrategists among plant species, was also used by Barradas
et al. [83]. The usage of longevity and offspring numbers
as classification factors for life-history strategies in plants,
is adapted from the microbial framework provided by
Andrews and Harris [84]. For analyses exploring associations with levels of domestication, we only considered
Spermatophyta. Species were crudely ranked from no
domestication to high domestication in an increasing
order, according to the level of alteration in the plant as
compared to ancestral wild plants (i.e. maize got the highest level of domestication, and wild pines the lowest. Triticum aestivum got a relatively high level due to its hybrid
origins).

Authors' contributions
NMK conceived the idea of exploring chloroplast gene
sequence-structure relationship, carried out correlation
and simulation analyses and drafted the manuscript. BJR
added the idea to perform simulations which would
reveal exactly how mutations affect secondary structure.
HS contributed the idea of exploring variation in molecular strategies with respect to ecological life-styles. NMK,
HS and BJR have read and given final approval of the version to be published.

Correlation between stem-forming propensities of mRNAs vs.
length of the mRNA for natural, random and mutated sequences
of Nephroselmis olivacea Nine mRNAs of varying lengths
(psbF (120 bases), psbK (177 bases), rps18 (227 bases), rps9
(278 bases), rpl14 (368 bases), rps3 (641 bases), pet A (965
bases), psbB (1526 bases) and psaA (2244 bases)) belonging to
the species Nephroselmis olivacea (NC_000927) are analyzed
here. For mutated mRNAs, each point represents average stemforming propensity over fifty such mutated sequences and over at
least 50% sub-optimal alternative structures for each mutated
sequence. The random mRNA stability is an average over stabilities of fifty mononucleotide randomizations while maintaining
the sequence length.

Relationship between A. Integral Stability (-ΔG) and mRNA size
and B. Average stem-forming propensity (%) and integral stability. In A., the y-axis is the length of the mRNA and x-axis is the
negative of the folding stability (ΔG) in kcal/mol. The dataset
consists of seventeen species and thirty-five genes (see Methods).
For each mRNA, alternative structures that were at least half as
stable as the most stable structure were considered and stabilities
were averaged across all these structures. Further, the ΔGs were
averaged across all the seventeen species. Similarly, the relative
propensity of mRNA regions to form helices were averaged over
the top 50% sub-optimal alternative structures and further across
all the seventeen species (y-axis in B.)

t statistics of the regression slopes between stem formation at sites
and variability level of the site, for each mRNA in each plant species. The second row indicates the strand on which the genes are
encoded: AS (anti-sense) or S (sense). The third last row indicates
the number of plant species for which this association is negative
in that mRNA. The row before last indicates the correlation
between the negative of ΔG of the mRNA (as a proxy of gene
length) and the t statistics in the column above. The last row indicates the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for association
between the t-statistics for correlations of stem-formation with
variability level of each mRNA with the domestication level of species. The fourth last column indicates the number of negative t statistics in that plant; the third last column indicates the correlation
between the ΔG of the mRNA and the t statistics in that plant species, the second last column indicates the presumed life strategy of
that plant species (r or K), and the last column indicates the presumed level of domestication in Spermatophyta, estimated based
on the level of alterations from the wild plant. The numbers in
bold are significant according to two-tailed tests for correlations,
and according to sign tests when numbers of negative correlations
are counted.

Evolutionary variability effects on integral and residual, lengthadjusted stability. Correlations between the absolute numbers of
sites fitting the four variability categories: M1, M2, M3, and M4
(Y-axis) and A. integral stability (-ΔG) and B. residual, lengthadjusted stability (-ΔG) are shown here. Negative of mRNA stabilities were averaged over the top 50% sub-optimal alternative
structures and further across all the seventeen species. Residuals
were calculated by treating length as the independent variable and
the negative of stability (-ΔG) as the dependent variable (see
Methods).
