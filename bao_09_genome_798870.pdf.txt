Abstract
Background: Our aim is to improve knowledge of gene regulatory circuits important to dedifferentiation,
redifferentiation, and adventitious meristem organization during in vitro regeneration of plants.
Regeneration of transgenic cells remains a major obstacle to research and commercial deployment of most
taxa of transgenic plants, and woody species are particularly recalcitrant. The model woody species
Populus, due to its genome sequence and amenability to in vitro manipulation, is an excellent species for
study in this area. The genes recognized may help to guide the development of new tools for improving
the efficiency of plant regeneration and transformation.
Results: We analyzed gene expression during poplar in vitro dedifferentiation and shoot regeneration
using an Affymetrix array representing over 56,000 poplar transcripts. We focused on callus induction and
shoot formation, thus we sampled RNAs from tissues: prior to callus induction, 3 days and 15 days after
callus induction, and 3 days and 8 days after the start of shoot induction. We used a female hybrid white
poplar clone (INRA 717-1 B4, Populus tremula × P. alba) that is used widely as a model transgenic
genotype. Approximately 15% of the monitored genes were significantly up-or down-regulated when
controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.01; over 3,000 genes had a 5-fold or greater change in
expression. We found a large initial change in expression after the beginning of hormone treatment (at the
earliest stage of callus induction), and then a much smaller number of additional differentially expressed
genes at subsequent regeneration stages. A total of 588 transcription factors that were distributed in 45
gene families were differentially regulated. Genes that showed strong differential expression included
components of auxin and cytokinin signaling, selected cell division genes, and genes related to plastid
development and photosynthesis. When compared with data on in vitro callogenesis in Arabidopsis, 25%
(1,260) of up-regulated and 22% (748) of down-regulated genes were in common with the genes regulated
in poplar during callus induction.
Conclusion: The major regulatory events during plant cell organogenesis occur at early stages of
dedifferentiation. The regulatory circuits reflect the combinational effects of transcriptional control and
hormone signaling, and associated changes in light environment imposed during dedifferentiation.

Background
In vitro regeneration is a common research tool and
important method for plant propagation. It is also essential for most forms of genetic transformation, which
require the regeneration of single transgenic cells into
non-chimeric organisms [1,2]. Both embryogenic and
organogenic regeneration pathways are widely employed,
with the system of choice varying among species and
research or propagation goal.
Organogenesis systems are more widely applied than
embryogenic systems, particularly in dicotyledenous
plants, because the explants and in vitro conditions are less
complex and more robust. During organogenesis,
explants are generally subjected to four sequential stages:
direct or indirect callus induction, adventitious shoot (or
root) formation, adventitious root (or shoot) formation,
and micropropagation using axillary or apical meristem
containing tissues based on either shoot or root cuttings.
About a half century ago, the developmental fates of in
vitro explants were shown to be largely controlled by the
balance of cytokinin and auxin [3]. When cytokinin is
high relative to auxin, shoots are induced; when the
reverse is true, roots are induced. When both hormones
are present, but usually with dominance of auxin, undifferentiated growth of callus usually occurs. Although there
has been a great deal of progress in identification of key
genes that regulate embryogenesis and organogenesis [46], as well as genome scale studies of in vitro regeneration
[7-9], the studies have focused on only a few species and
specific regeneration systems.
Array studies of regeneration in Arabidopsis have focused
on indirect regeneration via root explants rather than
shoot explants [8], and used the Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip which represents 22,810 genes. Root explants were
pre-incubated on callus induction medium (CIM) for a
few days, and then transferred to a cytokinin-rich shoot
induction medium (SIM), an auxin-rich root induction
medium (RIM), or fresh CIM, respectively. Nearly half
(10,700 out of 22,810) of probe sets exhibited regulated
expression profiles (FDR<0.01) across the time points of
sampling. During early shoot development, 478 and 397
genes were specifically up-regulated and down-regulated,
respectively. In rice, a monocot, somatic embryos regenerated from cell culture were used to induce shoots. By comparing gene expression at 7 days on SIM with somatic
embryos using a 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray containing 37,000 probe sets, 433 and 397 genes were up-or
down-regulated, respectively [9].

lus trichocarpa (Torr. & Gray) produced by the USA Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute [11]. The value of
poplar as a model tree results from its modest sized
genome, facile transformation of selected genotypes, high
capacity for in vitro propagation, rapid growth, extensive
natural diversity, many natural and bred interspecific
hybrids, and diverse environmental and economic values
[12-14]. Its natural ability for vegetative regeneration,
even from mature tissues, and its amenability to organogenic regeneration and transformation in vitro, has motivated a large number of studies of the biology and
management of regeneration systems [1,2].
Microarrays have successfully identified many of the genes
and regulatory factors related to specific physiological
states in poplar. Wood formation has been intensively
studied using microarrays. For example, changes in gene
expression induced by gibberellic acid (GA) in the developing xylem was studied using a cDNA-based microarry
analysis [15]. By comparing gene expression among stem
micro-sections, the roles of many genes in xylem, phloem,
and cambium development were characterized [16]. Subsequent to the completion of the poplar genome, two
commercial oligonucleotide genome-scale microarrays
were designed. One was produced by NimbleGen and
another by Affymetrix. In STM-homolog over-expressing
poplars, 102 and 173 genes were identified as up- or
down-regulated by two-fold or greater, respectively, using
a NimbleGen platform [17]. In a genome-wide expression
analysis using the NimbleGen microarray platform, of
Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) and Auxin Response
Factor (ARF) in Populus (Populus trichocarpa clone Nisqually-1), the genes in a subgroup of Aux/IAA showed differential expression among different tissue types [18].
The goal of this study was to characterize the changes in
gene expression that accompany dedifferentiation and
organogenic regeneration in Populus, and compare them
to results from Arabidopsis and other species. Characterization of the regulatory networks from poplar--with its distinct in vitro system and phylogeny compared to the other
species studied to date--should give new insights into the
conserved mechanisms for maintenance and regulation of
plant stem cells. We conducted a genome-scale transcriptome analysis using the Affymetrix Poplar Genome GeneChip. It monitors more than 56,000 transcripts based on
poplar genome and EST sequences. In this report, we
describe the identities and biological roles of more than
9,000 unique regulated genes observed over five stages of
regeneration.

Results
The genus Populus has emerged as a model system for
plant and tree biology [10]. Its utility is likely to expand as
a result of the publication of a complete genome of Popu-

formation of Populus and many other plant species. Two
biological replicates were used for each of five time points
from pre-induction to shoot regeneration, and the RNAs
hybridized to genome-scale arrays.
Callus and shoot development during regeneration
To determine the time points for taking tissue samples
during in vitro shoot organogenesis, we carried out a preliminary regeneration experiment where 3 to 4 mm internodal stem segments (Figure 1A) were placed on auxinrich CIM in dark for 15 days, then transferred them to
cytokinin-rich SIM following our optimized transformation protocol (described under methods). No obvious
morphological changes occurred during the first three
days on CIM (Figure 1B). The explants began to form callus at the two ends starting at 7 days on CIM, and the size
of callus continued to grow (Figure 1C and 1D). Individual or multiple shoot buds emerged from callus beginning
from 8 days on SIM. Shoots were observed in approxi-

mately 10% of explants by 10 days on SIM (Figure 1E),
and the percentage grew to around 20% at 20 days on
SIM. Based on the above observations, explants were collected at 3 days both on CIM and SIM to detect early
genetic regulation of callus induction and shoot induction, respectively. For the 8 day sample from SIM, only
explants that had visible emerging shoots were chosen in
an effort to ensure that transcriptional changes related to
shoot regeneration could be detected.
Quality assessment of array data
We inspected graphical images of the raw hybridization
intensity for each of the 10 arrays, and found no severe
spatial artifacts (See Additional File 1A) that would likely
prevent accurate estimation of transcript expression levels
over the 11 randomly located probes per transcript [19].

(B) 3 days after placement on CIM; (C) 15 days on CIM; (D) 3 days on SIM after CIM treatment; and (E) 8 days on SIM after
CIM treatment.

controls, and hybridization controls -- indicated that no
significant flaws were detected (See Additional File 1B-G).
Approximately 48,000 transcripts out of over 56,000 had
detectable expression for at least one time point. The
squared correlations between the two biological replicates
ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 for each sample time (See Additional File 1H).
Identification of differentially expressed genes
The number of differentially expressed genes identified by
LIMMA (described under methods, see Additional File 2
for a list of the regulated genes at each stage identified by
LIMMA) was 12,513, of which 9,033 had expression levels
above those flagged as absent or marginal in the Affymetrix data quality reports at the stages when they are regulated. These 9,033 genes were considered in further
analyses.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/132

When expression at each stage was compared to that prior
to regeneration (Figure 2A), we found up to 4,312 genes
were up-regulated, and up to 4,772 genes were down-regulated. The largest number of regulated genes was identified at the earliest stage of callogenesis, though
morphological changes were not yet visible at this time
point. When comparing the expression at each time point
with that of the previous time point, the difference among
the numbers of differentially expressed genes declined
nearly an order of magnitude with sequential time points
(Figure 2B). In contrast to the thousands of regulated
genes during early callogenesis, there were only 132 and
90 genes up- and down-regulated, respectively, during the
early stages of shoot induction.
Gene ontology categorization of differentially expressed
genes
To identify the over-represented molecular functions and
biological processes at each stage, we categorized the
groups of the up-or down-regulated genes at each stage by
their Gene Ontology (GO) class (See Additional File 3).
Due to incompleteness of poplar GO annotations and the
conservation of gene families between poplar and Arabidopsis, we used the Arabidopsis matches of the identified
differentially expressed poplar gene as surrogates for GO
categorization. We used normalized frequencies
(described under methods) to test if a functional class was
over-represented; when the normalized frequency of a
functional class was larger than 1, this functional class was
presumed to be over-represented in a group of genes.

Most of the GO biological process categories classes had
similar numbers of genes that were up- and down-regulated (Table 1). However, at the onset of callogenesis-where the large majority of regulated genes were detected-there was a preponderance of up-regulated genes for the
GO cellular components related to ribosome, cytosol,
mitochondria, cell, wall, and endoplasmic reticulum
functions. In contrast, there was strong down-regulation
for chloroplast and plastid functions. For GO molecular
function categories, a preponderance of up-regulation
during the start of callogenesis was observed for structural
molecule activity, nucleotide binding, and nucleic acid
binding.

Clustering of differentially expressed genes
To identify genes with similar expression patterns during
regeneration, we clustered the 9,033 genes identified by
LIMMA that had expression levels above those flagged as
absent or marginal in the Affymetrix data quality reports.
At least five major clusters were visible (Figure 3). Prior to
callus induction, about half of the regulated genes were
strongly expressed, but most of these were shut down or
repressed immediately and permanently upon callogenesis (Cluster 1, 5,434 genes). Only small numbers of genes

formed the next three clades. One group included genes
that were very weakly expressed prior to callogenesis, activated during late callogenesis, then sequentially shut
down as shoot induction proceeded (Cluster 2, 587
genes). Another group's genes were strongly expressed
then largely shut down throughout the rest of regeneration (Cluster 3, 1,028 genes); others were mostly turned

off, further reduced in expression during initial callogenesis, then activated late in callogenesis and subsequently
turned off during shoot induction (Cluster 4, 734 genes).
Finally, a very large group of genes had very weak expression prior to regeneration, were activated rapidly and
strongly during early callogenesis, then were largely
down-regulated for the remainder of regeneration (cluster

strongly expressed, but mostly shut down or repressed
immediately and permanently upon callogenesis (Cluster
1, 316 genes). A small group of genes were also expressed
prior to callogenesis and then shut down, but then were
mostly reactivated during later stages of shoot induction
(Cluster 2, 35 genes). Another small group of genes were
largely unexpressed prior to callus induction, but then
strongly up-regulated during early callogenesis and then
largely deactivated again thereafter (Cluster 3, 52 genes).
A large heterogeneous group had genes that were variably,
but generally weakly, expressed prior to callus induction,
but then reactivated at various times in callus and shoot
induction (Cluster 4, 132 genes). Finally, a small group of
genes were conspicuously and strongly expressed during
late callogenesis, but weakly and variably expressed at
other stages (cluster 5, 45 genes). As with the full gene set,
there does not appear to be a cluster of genes that are specifically up-regulated during shoot induction.

5, 3,525 genes). There did not appear to be a cluster of
genes that were specifically up-regulated during shoot
induction.
Clustering of differentially expressed transcriptional
factors
We found that 588 transcriptional factors (23% of total)
distributed in 42 families were differentially expressed
(Table 2, see Additional File 4 for a list of the regulated
transcription factors). Transcription factors involved in
auxin signaling are among the most abundant regulated
transcription factor families. Approximately 70% of Aux/
IAA and 40% of ARF genes were up- or down-regulated
during at least one stage. Other abundant families-involving at least 40% of its members--included the SRS,
TLP, CCAAT-HAP2, GRF, and C2C2-Dof families.

When only transcription factors were considered in cluster
analysis, several distinct clusters emerged, but were somewhat different in their patterns from the full gene list (Figure 4). Similar to the complete gene list, prior to callus
induction more than half of the regulated genes were

Auxin, cytokinin, and cell-cycle associated genes
Two F-box genes were differentially regulated upon callus
induction, and are closely related to Arabidopsis TIR1
(Transport Inhibitor Response 1) (Figure 5A, see Additional
File 5 for a list of the regulated auxin signaling genes).
After the early callus induction stage, their expression stabilized for the remainder of the regeneration period. A
number of F-box genes are thought to take part in auxin
signaling [20-22]. Twenty-three Aux/IAAs and fifteen
ARFs were differentially expressed during at least one stage
(Figure 5B and 5C). The majority of both classes of genes
were down-regulated at the onset of callus induction and
throughout subsequent regeneration, but specific groups
of Aux/IAA genes were then up-regulated late in callus and
during shoot development, or up-regulated during early
callus induction and then down-regulated thereafter (Figure 5C).

A number of genes that take part in cytokinin signaling
were regulated during regeneration (Figure 6, see Additional File 6 for a list of the regulated cytokining signaling
genes). Key components of the cytokinin signaling and
reception pathways include receptor kinases, phosphotransfer proteins, and various response regulators [23,24].
A putative cytokinin receptor histidine kinase gene was
down-regulated upon callus induction. Three differentially expressed histidine phosphotransfer genes were
down-regulated during callus induction, then up-regulated during subsequent growth and shoot regeneration.
All three A-type response regulator genes were up- then
down-regulated during callus development, then strongly
up-regulated during shoot induction. Only one of two Btype response regulator genes was substantially down-regulated upon callus induction.

The JGI gene model IDs were downloaded from the Database of Poplar Transcription Factors (DPTF) and were searched against the list of the
differentially expressed genes identified by LIMMA. The list is ranked by the percentage of the total number of each transcription factor class in
poplar. The total number of regulated transcription factors were corrected for redundancy among the array probes; the number of up-or downregulated transcription factors at each stage were not corrected for redundancy (i.e., multiple probe sets targeting the same transcript may be
present).

those of a similar microarray experiment in Arabidopsis [8]
(See Additional Files 8, 9, 10, 11 for a list of the common
genes). They reported changes in expression after four
days on CIM to pre-induction root tissues, and found
5,038 up-regulated and 3,429 down-regulated genes at an
FDR of 0.02. Our comparison revealed that 16% to 22%
of down-regulated genes were in common, and 25 to 27%
of up-regulated genes were in common, depending on the
direction of comparison (poplar to Arabidopsis, or the
reverse; Figure 8). Thus, approximately 2,000 genes were
conserved in their basic roles among the two species. Of
these genes approximately 8% were transcription factors.
The largest GO classes of genes that were common and
up-regulated include those related to cell growth, such as
ribosome expression and DNA/RNA metabolism (Figure
9A). By far the largest common down-regulated class was
genes related to plastid development (Figure 9B).

Figure 4
Clustering of regulated transcription factors
Clustering of regulated transcription factors. The
ratios of the gene expression at each time point and the highest level of expression of that gene among the five time
points (i.e., a within-gene scale) were used for scaled clustering. Five distinctive expression patterns are labeled and discussed in the text (1-5). Expression scaling is indicated below
clusters.

Cell cycle genes are of obvious importance for regeneration, as slow growing explant tissues must be reactivated
to grow rapidly during callus and shoot development. The
cell cycle genes showed complex patterns of regulation,
some being up- and others down-regulated at various
points in regeneration (Figure 7, see Additional File 7 for
a list of regulated cell cycle genes). A group was rapidly upregulated, then mostly down-regulated after callus induction. Another group was not up-regulated until late in callus induction, but then was also mostly reduced in
expression during shoot induction; some of these genes,
however, did reactivate later in shoot induction. A third
major group was strongly expressed prior to callus induction, then showed diverse patterns of reduced expression
in subsequent stages.
Comparison of regulated genes to Arabidopsis and rice
To identify genes whose function in regeneration is conserved among plant families, we compared our results to

By using data on shoot regeneration from rice [9]and Arabidopsis [8], were able to compare up-regulated genes
among all three species. Of approximately 500 genes from
each species, only 6 were common among all three (Figure 10). There were more than 10-fold fewer genes in
common between poplar and rice than there were
between poplar and Arabidopsis. Among the 6 common
genes, three are putative oxidoreductases with an NADbinding domain.

Discussion
Although some spatial variation in variability in hybridization intensity was visible on our arrays, we found that
they gave a high degree of precision for estimates of gene
expression. For example, 31,939 genes (out of a total
61,413 genes on the array) were flagged "present" for the
both biological replicates prior to callus induction (i.e.,
above background, as determined by the Affymetrix software). Based on variance between biological replications
after normalization and exclusion of any genes flagged
"non-present" for one of the biological replicates, the
mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of
signal intensity over biological replicates was 7.70, 0.20,
and 3.18%, respectively. The mean standard error over
biological replicates was 0.14 (1.84% relative to the
mean). Thus, the precision in our estimates of approximately 2% is very small in relation to the large changes of
gene expression observed, which often exceeded several
hundred percent.
From the sequential comparisons of regulated genes, we
found that there was a massive reorganization of gene
expression shortly after the start of callus induction, but
before visible changes in explant morphology were obvious. Changes in gene regulation after this point were far
smaller, and decreased over time. Surprisingly, there were
no substantial changes in gene expression observed after

transfer to shoot induction medium. It may also reflect
the observation that even after callus induction there was
some meristematic activity observed in a number of
explants, including the production of root initials. This
may have coincided with a large and complex set of alterations in gene expression that are not substantially or
simultaneously reset with the increase in cytokinin provided by the SIM medium.
The changes in GO categories reflect the large reorganization that tissues are undergoing during regeneration.
Genes related to mitochondria, cell wall, ER, cell organization, and biogenesis were highly up-regulated during
callus induction. This is a likely consequence of increased
protein synthesis to support cell division and wall formation during callus induction. In contrast, chloroplast/plastid genes are strongly down-regulated gene during callus
induction, which likely corresponds to the transition from
autotrophy to heterotrophy at this developmental transi-

tion. It also likely reflects the suppressive effect of callus
development in the dark in our regeneration system on
light regulated, photosynthesis associated genes.
Two F-box proteins were regulated during regeneration.
TIR1 and other three auxin F-box proteins have been suggested as auxin receptors involved in the regulation of
auxin-responsive genes [20-22]. Auxin binds to TIR1 that
is contained in SCF-like complex (SCFTIR1), which promotes the interaction between TIR1 and AUX/IAAs
(reviewed by [25,26]. By comparison to auxin associated
genes, only a small number of genes related to cytokinin
signaling appear to be regulated in our dataset. However,
the A-type response regulators and the pseudo-response
regulator appear to be specifically induced during shoot
induction, suggesting a direct role in cytokinin signaling.
The type-A ARRs, are considered negative regulators of
cytokinin signaling that are rapidly up-regulated in
response to cytokinin [27].

There was strong and complex regulation of cell-cycle
genes. In the JGI annotation, 110 genes have been
assigned to GO:0007049, the cell cycle category [28]. Of
these, 21 were differentially expressed during our regener-

ation treatments. Approximately half of these are hypothetical proteins, and 6 are cyclin genes. As expected given
the rapid tissue growth that occurs during callogenesis,
the majority (17 out of 21) were up-regulated around the
time of callus induction. Among the four genes that were
down-regulated
during
callus
induction,
estExt_fgenesh4_pg.C_LG_V0508 was identified as a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor [29].
MYB proteins are a large group of transcription factors
that have a wide variety of roles in development. For
example, expression of many Myb genes is correlated with
secondary wall formation, both in Arabidopsis and poplar
[10,30]. During regeneration, we found that 41 (19% of
the 216 poplar MYBs) showed regulated expression, and
the number of down-regulated MYBs were roughly double
the number of up-regulated MYBs at any stage. Not surprisingly, it appears that many Mybs play important roles
in organogenesis.

File 7 for a detailed list of the genes and their corresponding

The catalogs of regulated genes we have identified provide
candidates for further analysis of their roles in in vitro
development, and for modifying development for better
control of regeneration. For example, many new gene
family members and unknown genes could be characterized biochemically or via reverse genetic screens such as
with RNAi or overexpression to identify their roles in con-

tially expression during the onset of callus induction. A
much smaller number of differentially expressed genes
were detected at subsequent regeneration stages. A total of
588 transcription factors that were distributed in 45 gene
families were differentially regulated. Genes involved in
auxin signaling, cytokinin signaling, and secondary meristem regulation (eg. MYBs) were among the most abundantly regulated classes of transcription factors. Genes
related to auxin signaling were highly regulated during
regeneration. Two auxin F-box receptors, and more than a
dozen Aux/IAAs and ARFs, showed differential expression. Differential expression of genes associated with cytokinin signaling included regulation of cytokinin histidine
kinase receptors, two phosphotransfer proteins, and A-, Btype, and pseudo response regulators. Most of the identified cell cycle genes were up-regulated during callus
induction. Substantial components of the regulatory circuits were conserved between Arabidopsis and poplar during callus induction, though different explants (stems vs.
roots) were employed. Approximately one-fourth of the
regulated genes in Arabidopsis were shared with poplar.

trol of regeneration. Induced expression of genes that
appear to regulate cell cycle such as the cyclins, or of transcription factors that are associated with dedifferentiation
such as some of the MYBs, might be useful for promoting
regeneration of transgenic plants [31]. Microarray analysis
of transgenic plants with these misexpressed genes would
also provide insight into the regulatory networks in which
they play a part. The modest level of conservation of the
regulated gene sets between poplar and Arabidopsis, and
the low level of conservation between poplar and rice, are
not surprising given the considerably larger phylogenetic
distance between rice, a monocot, and poplar and Arabidopsis, two dicots. Most important, however, is the likelihood that organogenesis in poplar was based on
redifferention from shoot explants, whereas root explants
were employed in Arabidopsis; and in rice, the distinctive
embryogenic regeneration pathway was studied. These
results suggest that transcriptome studies of a number of
species and regeneration systems are needed in order to
more fully understand--and thus to more rationally modify--the diverse in vitro regeneration pathways important
to plant biology and biotechnology.

Conclusion
The major transcriptional events in regulation of in vitro
organogenesis in poplar occurred during the early stages
of dedifferentiation. Nearly 10,000 genes were differen-

Methods
Plant material and culture conditions
Hybrid poplar clone INRA 717-1 B4 (female, Populus tremula × P. alba) was used for all experiments. Plants were
propagated in vitro according to published protocols
[32,33]. In brief, inter-nodal stem segments (3-4 mm in
length) from in vitro micropropagated plants were cut and
incubated on callus induction medium (CIM, MS containing 10 μM Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) and 5 μM N6-(2-isopentenyl) adenine
(Sigma) at 22°C in darkness for 15 days. Shoots were
induced by culturing explants on shoot induction
medium (SIM, MS containing 0.2 μM TDZ) (NOR-AM
Chemical Co., Wilmington, DE).

RNAs were extracted separately from two batches (biological replications) that had been grown under the same
growth conditions but three weeks apart in February
2007. For both, samples were collected at five time points:
prior to callus induction, 3 days on CIM, 15 days on CIM
(then transferred to SIM), and 3 days and 8 days on SIM.
Approximately 10-15 stem explants from the same plate
(~3 to 4 mm in length, with nodes removed) were pooled
for RNA extraction for each biological replication
Microarray platform
The Poplar Genome Array was designed by Affymetrix. It
contains more than 61,000 probe sets representing over
56,000 transcripts and gene predictions. The probes are
based on content from UniGene Build #6 (March 16,
2005), GenBank mRNAs, and ESTs for all Populus species
(up to April 26, 2005) from the predicted gene set v1.1
from the Populus genome project (U.S. Department of

Energy, Joint Genome Institute, http://genome.jgipsf.org/Poptr1_1/[34]. The genome sequence is based on
reads from a single tree of black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa) of the pacific northwestern USA [11].
RNA extraction and quality examination
Total RNA was isolated and purified according to the RNeasy Mini Protocol for Isolation of Total RNA from Plant
Cells and Tissues and Filamentous Fungi (QIAGEN Inc.,
Valencia, CA). A260/A280 ratios of RNA samples dissolved in 10 mm Tris pH 7.6 ranged from 1.9 to 2.1. The
integrities of RNA samples were examined by the Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer; their RINs (RNA Integrity Number)
ranged from 8.6 to 10.0, and they showed no evidence of
degradation.
Array hybridization and quality assessment
The arrays were labeled and hybridized at the Center for
Genomics and Biocomputing at Oregon State University
[35] according to Affymetrix protocols. The quality of data
was assessed by a series of parameters associated with
assay and hybridization performance developed by

Affymetrix. These include probe array image inspection,
B2 oligo performance, average background, and noise values, poly-A controls (lys, phe, thr, dap), hybridization controls (bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre), internal control genes (3'
to 5' ratios of β-actin and GAPDH), percent present, scaling, and normalization factors. The reliability and repeatability of this microarray platform was also evaluated by
the correlations between the two biological replicates.
Quantitative analysis
The probe-level data were normalized and summarized
using the GC Robust Multichip Average (GCRMA) [36]
algorithm using affylmGUI [37]. The algorithm computes
gene expression summary values for Affymetrix data in
three steps: a background adjustment using sequence
information, quantile normalization, and finally expression value summarization. The summary values are based
on a log2 scale.

Differentially expressed genes were identified by LIMMA
(Linear Models for Microarray Data) [38,39]. LIMMA
identifies differential expression via a modified t-test of

Hierarchical clustering was performed using MeV 4.0
(MultiExperiment Viewer) [42] with the Pearson correlation and average linkage model. The ratios of expression
of a gene at each time point with its highest expression
value among the five time points were used for scaled
clustering.

gene expression between two treatments, using B statistics
to rank differentially expressed genes. The BH P-value
adjustment (Benjamini and Hochberg's FDR) was
applied, using an adjusted P-value of 0.01 as a cutoff.
To reveal both global expression changes compared to the
starting explant developmental state, and the specific
expression changes taking place at each stage, two sets of
contrasts between time points were used. First, the expression during each of the stages was compared with the
baseline explant (CIM0). Second, the expression at each
stage was compared with that of the previous time point.
Because of the well-established precision of the Affymetrix
platform, and that our goal was to broadly cataloging patterns of gene expression, not to precisely estimate expression changes for specific genes, we did not conduct RTPCR validation studies. Quality control studies have
shown that results from RT-PCR are in agreement with
microarray for genes with medium and high expression,
and is not substantially more precise than the array platform employed itself [25].
Biological interpretation
All annotation information for the Affymetrix Poplar
Genome Array was retrieved from PopARRAY [40]. The
annotation for each Affymetrix probe set ID consists of
corresponding public ID, JGI poplar gene models, predicted Arabidopsis homolog, and functional annotation.

The JGI gene model IDs of all transcription factors were
download from the Database of Poplar Transcription Factors (DPTF) [41]. DPTF catalogs known and predicted
transcription factors from Populus trichocarpa. DPTF currently contains 2,576 putative transcription factors gene
models, distributed in 64 families.

GO annotation and categorization were done at the BioArray Resource for Arabidopsis Functional Genomics [43]
with predicted Arabidopsis matches. The normalized frequencies were calculated as frequency of the class in the
input data set divided by the frequency of the class in the
whole genome. The class frequency was calculated as the
ratio of the number of regulated genes in that class
divided by the total number of genes in the class in the
input data set, and the frequency of the class in the
genome was calculated as the ratio of the total number of
genes for that class in the genome divided by the total
number of genes in the genome. The approximate reliability of over- or under- representation was evaluated by
graphical presentation of standard errors based on 100
bootstraps of the input set. Because of the lack of a
detailed genome annotation and associated statistics for
poplar, the percentage of each functional class in the poplar genome was assumed to be approximately equal to
that in Arabidopsis.
Comparative studies were carried out by comparing the
regulated Arabidopsis homologs to a group of regulated
poplar or rice genes detected under similar conditions.
Data on Arabidopsis and rice was downloaded from the
online supporting materials of the relevant publications
[8,9]. For Arabidopsis, root explants had been preincubated
on CIM for 4 days and then transferred to cytokinin-rich
SIM. Among the monitored 22,810 transcripts on the
Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip, 5,038 (up-regulated) and
3,429 (down-regulated) genes exhibited regulated expression profiles with a false discovery rate of 0.01. During
early shoot development, 478 and 397 genes were specifically up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. For
rice, somatic embryos generated from cell culture were
used to induce shoots. By comparing gene expression 7
days on SIM with somatic embryos with a 70-mer long
oligo microarray containing 37,000 probe sets, 433 and
397 gene were found up-or down-regulated, respectively
(p-value < 0.05, ≥ two-fold change) [9]. For comparison
of regulated genes identified between species, the Arabidopsis homolog ID (identification) numbers of the rice
genes that were given in the online supporting tables [9],
and the preferred Arabidopsis homolog IDs of the poplar
genes from the PopArray database, were compared with
the Arabidopsis IDs in [8,9]. A gene is considered to be in
common with Arabidopsis if their Arabidopsis homolog ID
matches the Arabidopsis ID.
