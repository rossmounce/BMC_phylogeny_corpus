Abstract
Background: Class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a distinct group of the
GPCR family, which structurally possess a characteristically distinct extracellular domain inclusive
of the Venus flytrap module (VFTM). The VFTMs of the class C GPCRs is responsible for ligand
recognition and binding, and share sequence similarity with bacterial periplasmic amino acid binding
proteins (PBPs). An extensive phylogenetic investigation of the VFTMs was conducted by analyzing
for functional divergence and testing for positive selection for five typical groups of the class C
GPCRs. The altered selective constraints were determined to identify the sites that had undergone
functional divergence via positive selection. In order to structurally demonstrate the pattern
changes during the evolutionary process, three-dimensional (3D) structures of the GPCR VFTMs
were modelled and reconstructed from ancestral VFTMs.
Results: Our results show that the altered selective constraints in the VFTMs of class C GPCRs
are statistically significant. This implies that functional divergence played a key role in characterizing
the functions of the VFTMs after gene duplication events. Meanwhile, positive selection is involved
in the evolutionary process and drove the functional divergence of the VFTMs. Our results also
reveal that three continuous duplication events occurred in order to shape the evolutionary
topology of class C GPCRs. The five groups of the class C GPCRs have essentially different sites
involved in functional divergence, which would have shaped the specific structures and functions of
the VFTMs.
Conclusion: Taken together, our results show that functional divergence involved positive
selection and is partially responsible for the evolutionary patterns of the class C GPCR VFTMs. The
sites involved in functional divergence will provide more clues and candidates for further research
on structural-function relationships of these modules as well as shedding light on the activation
mechanism of the class C GPCRs.

Background
The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane receptors coupled to G proteins and represent
a major group of cell-surface receptors that constitute
3.5% of the genome in vertebrates [1]. These receptors
play a major role in intercellular communication and act
as receptors for most hormones and neurotransmitters.
The GPCRs are involved in the perception of the environment, being activated by taste compounds, pheromones,
odorants and even photons [2]. Several classes of the
GPCRs have been defined based on sequence similarity
[1,3,4]. The class C GPCRs are mainly composed of
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), gammaaminobutyric acid type B receptors (GABABRs), Ca2+-sensing receptors (CaSR), taste receptors (T1R), pheromone
receptors (V2R) and olfactory receptors[1,2]. They play a
key role in the physiology of various types of epilepsy as
well as in nociception and drug addiction [5]. These receptors structurally possess an extracellular Venus flytrap
module (VFTM) where agonists bind and a heptahelical
transmembrane domain (HD) which is responsible for G
protein activation [6-11]. For most receptors, with the
exception of GABABR, the cysteine-rich domain (CRD)
can act as a molecular link between the VFTD and HD
domains. Moreover, the VFTMs share structural similarity
with bacterial periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins
(PBPs), such as the leucine-binding protein (LBP) and the
leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding
protein
(LIVBP)
[7,8,12-14]. Interestingly, the bacterial PBPs show extensive ligand-binding properties and can transport small
nutritional molecules such as amino acids and vitamins
[15,16]. In contrast, the class C GPCR VFTM's physiological function is involved in shaping ligand-binding specificity and GB2 has even lost the ability to bind ligands
(Figure 1). The class C GPCRs can form homodimers
whereas GABABR is a heterodimer and is composed of two
homologous subunits, GABAB1 (GB1) and GABAB2 (GB2)
[17-21].
Although ligand-binding ability are a typical character of
the class C GPCR VFTMs, different receptors have different
ligand-binding specificities. Moreover, the GB2 receptors
have lost the ability to bind ligands but have maintained
their function to can activate G proteins [22]. The overall
structural similarity between GPCRs and bacterial PBPs
imply that there is a common origin among class C
GPCRs via internal domain duplication. As a result, the
VFTMs provide an interesting evolutionary case to investigate gene duplication and functional divergence events.
Unlike the bacterial PBPs which can bind various different
ligands, most class C GPCRs expressed in the central nerve
system can bind only one kind of natural ligand, implying
that the VFTMs of class C GPCRs have undergone partial
loss of function such as the ability to bind different lig-

ands as well as gaining other unknown functions. Meanwhile, it would be interesting to know whether functional
alterations in the VFTMs were the result of extensive
changes in selective constraints (different evolutionary
rate) at those sites involved.
In the present study we undertook an extensive phylogenetic analysis for the VFTMs of five typical groups of class
C GPCRs. By inspecting the amino-acid sites, we report
that altered selective constraints derived from positive
selection resulted in the functional divergence in the
VFTM domains of class C GPCRs (and this occurred after
three continuous gene duplications). Our study provides
a new insight into understanding the ligand-binding specificity and how the activation or modulation mechanism
is refined in the class C GPCRs.

Results
Phylogeny inference of the VFTMs
A phylogenetic analysis of the aligned protein sequences
showed that the VFTMs of class C GPCRs fell into three
major classes: the mGluR class, a second sensing receptor
class consisting of the CaSR and the T1R, and a third less
related class consisting of two homologous subunits of
the GABABR, GB1 and GB2. A distinct group of bacterial
PBPs was used to root the tree dendrogram (Figure 2). In
order to validate the tree, the ML dendrogram was inferred
based from the reduced protein sequences. The results
show that the NJ tree and the ML tree had similarly identical phylogenetic topology (see additional file 1). The
monophyletic topology of the VFTMs suggests that there
is a common originating ancestor for the class C GPCRs.
The average sequence identity between GB1/GB2 VFTMs
with bacterial PBPs is lower (7.5% and 8.5%, respectively), however, it's medium (30.6%) between GB1 and
GB2. These phenomena implied that the VFTMs of
GABABR being related to the bacterial PBPs and were distant homologous group of the class C GPCRs.
Type I functional divergence of the VFTMs
In order to determine shifted selective constraints in the
VFTMs of class C GPCRs, the coefficients of functional
divergence (θ) were calculated and based on pairwise
sequence comparisons (Table 1). The results show that all
θ values were significantly greater than zero (p < 0.05),
supporting the hypothesis of altered selective constraints
had occurred in the VFTMs of class C GPCRs. Moreover,
the functional branch lengths (bF) of each VFTM group
were estimated according to the functional distance
matrix, arbitrarily constraining bF(PBP) = 0 was used to
root the scale. The result statistically rejected the null
hypothesis of equal functional branch lengths (p < 0.05),
which implies that the functional role of the VFTMs was
different to their ancestral role. The rejection result statistically provides evidence for functional divergence in the

Schematic representation of class C GPCRs
Schematic representation of class C GPCRs. Class C GPCRs share structural similarity with bacterial PBPs but have
higher ligand-binding specificity. These receptors have a common structure consisting of an N-terminal extracellular VFTM, a
transmembrane HD connected with VFTM via CRD, and a variable C-terminal intracellular tail. The bacterial PBPs have extensively ligand-binding properties, which are involved in transporting small nutritional molecules such as amino acids and vitamins.
The class C GPCRs have a physiological function in shaping ligand-binding specificity. The GB2 group lacks the ability to directly

VFTMs of class C GPCRs. In particular, bF(GB2) produced
the highest value suggesting that GB2 maintained a larger
shifted evolutionary rate since the duplication events.
The three continuous duplication events showed varying
effects on shaping the site-specific altered selective constrains of the class C GPCR VFTMs. The result of functional divergence on each duplication event show that the
first and second duplication events significantly induced
site-specific altered selective constraints to generate the
GABABR and mGluR groups, but the third duplication
separating the sensing-receptors and the homologous

subunits of GABABR group failed to significantly change
the site-specific shift of evolutionary rate (Table 2).
For refining the sites involved in altered functional constrains in the VFTMs, the site-specific profile included 269
sites based on posterior probability (Qk) was used to identify the critical sites responsible for the functional divergence. The percentage distributions of Qk frequencies
showed that mass altered functional constraints existed
between the class C GPCR VFTM domains and bacterial
PBPs (Figure 3). The ad hoc high probability components

ity of contribution to functional divergence were variable
between different pairwise comparisons. By comparing
mGluR and GB1 with bacterial PBPs, 32 sites (11.9%)
were detected, while CaSR, T1R and GB2 had 8 sites
(3.0%), 12 sites (4.5%) and 7 sites (2.6%) respectively.
Interestingly, comparisons within the class C GPCRs
showed that GB2 showed significant change in altered
functional constraints, but little difference was observed
between the GB1 and GB2 groups (see additional file 2).
By comparing with bacterial PBPs, the sites involved in
altered functional constraints with Qk > 0.9 were conserved in specific groups and generally determined the
structural characteristics of the VFTMs. These sites were
extremely variable for each different group but all were
located around the ligand-binding pocket (Figure 3).
Moreover, there was little variation within a group and
variability with bacterial PBPs. Accordingly, all 7 sites with
Qk > 0.9 in GB2 were excluded under this criterion. These
phenomena imply that GB1 and GB2 possessed dramatically different characteristics for altered functional constraints, with GB1 showing similarity with class C GPCRs,
and GB2 showing similarity for bacterial PBPs.
These results suggest that these sites probably played an
important role in defining ligand-binding specificity for
the VFTMs in class C GPCRs. In contrast, radical amino
acid substitutions with very different chemical properties

were found at the same positions in bacterial PBPs, thus
indicating that altered selective constraints is related to
the functional divergence between bacterial PBPs and the
VFTMs in class C GPCRs.
The site-specific profiles were used to identify the sites that
had functionally diverged after duplication events. The
results showed that the majority of sites had undergone
shifted rates after the first duplication event, as indicated
by the high posterior probabilities. However, a small proportion of sites had undergone shifted rates after the second duplication event, while after the third duplication
event there was no effect on shifted rates (Figure 4). These
results imply that the first and second duplicate events
were mainly responsible for functional divergence and
characterizing the different groups, while the third duplicate separated different members within a group as exemplified by the GABABR group and sensing receptors group.
Positive selection in the VFTM-coding DNA sequences
The nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio
(ω = dN/dS) of the VFTMs in class C GPCRs, measures the
selective pressure exerted at the protein level and thus
indicates its evolutionary characteristics, was conducted
by pairwise comparison of the human and mouse VFTMcoding sequences. The LRT comparison for variability in
the selective pressure among VFTM sites showed large

variability in selective pressure amongst the VFTM sites
(Table 3). With the selective pressure variation among
VFTM sites established, positive selection was tested by
two model comparisons. In each comparison, the null
model does not allow the presence of sites under positive
selection, while the alternative model allows for selection.
The test statistics of both comparisons showed high significance and resulted in the rejection of the null models.
This indicates that the presence of these sites evolved
under positive selection in the VFTMs. Note that type I
functional divergence may be detected under diversifying
selection or a loss of selective constraints, which is known
to be an important process affecting many GPCRs, these
functional sites evolved positive selection may be not
totally driven by positive selection, however, the model
comparisons confirmed that positive selection contributed the functional divergence without doubt.
Molecular time scale estimation of the VFTMs
The linearized NJ tree of the orthologous VFTMs under the
global clock model suggests that three continuous duplication events had occurred in early stages of vertebrates.
Based on the calibration of GrlJ in Dictyostelium discoideum, the first duplication event occurred at 899 Mya (T1)
resulting in the split of the GABABR group and other class
C GPCRs. The mGluR group resulted from the second
duplication, occurred at 638 Mya (T2). The third duplication estimated at 573-565 Mya (T3) gave rise to a split
resulting in the sensing-receptors (CaSR and T1R) and the
GABABR subunits (GB1 and GB2) (Figure 5). Note that

many tissue-specific gene families follow similar patterns,
raising the possibility of a large-scale duplication in early
vertebrates [23,24]. Because of differential selection pressures on different duplicate genes or groups, the time estimation in terms of the molecular clock was taken as an
approximation.
Reconstruction of the ancestral VFTMs
Nine extinct ancestral amino acid sequences were derived
from on 38 aligned present-day sequences and the NJ tree
topologies. To examine how sequence changes in the
VFTMs during the evolutionary process might affect the
chemical properties and the ligand-binding pockets, the
ancestral three-dimensional (3D) structures were homologous modelled on rat VFTM mGluR1 (Figure 6). The
results show that some of the sequence changes in the
VFTMs during evolution could cause substantial alterations between the interfaces of the ligand-binding pockets. Considering the structural changes within the VFTMs
and the different structural variation between groups
together, the correlation between structure and function
of the VFTMs suggests that molecular adaption was a
result of functional divergence. These radical changes
could affect the binding between specific ligands and the
class C GPCRs.

Discussion
Gene or domain duplications have long been thought to be
the primary driving events for producing evolutionary
novel genes. In our study we have shown that gene duplica-

tion plays an important role in the evolutionary process of
class C GPCRs. After undergoing three continuous duplications, the GB2 group retained their original structure and
functions and are similarly related to bacterial PBPs except
for their ligand-binding abilities. In contrast, the other class
C GPCR groups under relaxed evolutionary constraints and
functional divergence, lead to the diversification and formation of the mGluR, CaSR, T1R and GB1 groups. Because
of freely accumulating amino acid replacements, type I
functional divergence events resulted in shaping the unique
characteristics of each group within class C GPCRs. When
sites at the periphery of the ligand-binding pockets were
replaced by different amino-acids there was no serious deleterious effects on the survival, the rudiments of each group
were fundamentally shaped. In contrast, the well-conserved
sites in the ligand-binding pockets are highly variable,
which may result in diversification and different ligand
specification. In particular, the VFTMs of GB1 and CaSR
groups appear to have acquired novel functions for binding
new types of ligands, thus explaining the dramatic difference in amino acid composition. Meanwhile, the GB2
group may have functionally diverged through gene duplication events, which would lead to the acquisition of
unknown or loss of intrinsic functions.

on how the role of positive selection has a strong effect on
the development on the evolutionary process of the class
C GPCR VFTM domains.

Although the VFTMs of class C GPCRs were distant originated from bacterial PBPs, their basic ligand-binding ability was intrinsically identical. However, the role was
changed from transporting nutrient substances in bacteria
to initiating signal transduction in class C GPCRs. The
functional alterations under the positive selected functional divergence evolved the complexity of the VFTMs of
class C GPCRs.

Conclusion

According to Darwinian theory, complexity derived by a
stepwise process of elaboration and optimization under
natural selection [25,26]. The VFTMs of the class C GPCRs
provides an illustration of this theory. Our results indicate
that the functions of VFTMs were generated by molecular
exploitation, which recruit of older molecules (PBPs), previously constrained for a different role, into a new functional complex (class C GPCRs). The complexity in the
class C GPCR VFTMs consequently arose the biological
complexity by a stepwise Darwinian process. In addition,
further evidence indicate that positive Darwinian selection played an indispensable role in the origin and evolution of the genes involved in brain development and
perception [27]. Our results provide an important insight

Finally, the functional divergence rates shift for the class C
GPCR HD domains show a similar pattern of stepwise
change in amino acid replacement resulting in changes in Gprotein coupling ability and different ligand recognition.
Despite the lack of experimental evidence for the origination
of the HD domains, we observed a group of sites that was
highly conserved in class C GPCRs, implying their common
origination of seven transmembrane domains. According to
the evolutionary pattern of class C GPCRs and the related
duplicate events, we propose that an ancestor composed of
the bacterial PBP-like domain and a rhodopsin-like transmembrane domain acted as the precursor for the class C
GPCRs. The GABABR group arose through a series of point
mutations after the first duplicate event. Consequently, two
possibilities can result from the selective constraint differences for gene duplication: one being that it may become
more conserved in groups such as mGluR, CaSR, T1R or
GB1, which induced new functions; the other one may
become more variable in groups such as GB2, which resulted
in functional relaxation or loss of functions.

Our results demonstrate that type I functional divergence
involved positive selection is partially responsible for
driving the evolution of class C GPCRs. Moreover, three
internal duplication events had occurred within the class
C GPCR VFTMs at the early stage of vertebrates, resulting
in the present class C GPCRs. The sites involved in functional divergence may provide extra clues and widen our
search for more candidates for further research on the relationship between structures and function, as well as shedding light on the activation mechanism of class C GPCRs.

Multiple alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction
Multiple alignments were conducted by ClustalW program [30] with default parameters, followed by manual
editing using BioEdit [31]. The phylogenetic trees were
produced by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [32] with
the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) probability model and
gamma-distributed (a = 1.0) rates among the sites were
inferred by using MEGA4 software [33]. Bootstrap with
1000 repetitions was carried out to assess the confidence
degree of nodes in the phylogenetic trees. The maximum
likelihood (ML) method was used for the phylogenetic
reconstruction to validate the tree topology. By using
Proml program in PHYLIP package [34] with hidden
Markov model (HMM) rates, gamma-distributed rates
approximated by 5 rate categories, with coefficient of variation of rates = 1.0. For estimation of divergence time, a
linearized NJ tree was used to convert the average distance
of protein sequences to the molecular time scale under the
global clock model [24,35,36]. In this study, a GABAB-like

was used as the root (1085 million years ago, Mya) to calibrate the time scale [37,38].
Analysis of type I functional divergence
Type I functional divergence analysis was carried out as
previously described [39-42] by DIVERGE software [43].
Coefficients of functional divergence (θ), an indicator for
the level of type I functional divergence among two
homologous gene clusters, were calculated by DIVERGE
with null hypothesis θ = 0. The sites (k) with critical contribution to overall functional divergence were predicted
according to their posterior probabilities (Qk), an indicator for the level of functional constraints [39]. The sites
with Qk > 0.67 were only meaningful for type I functional
divergence in the present study. A matrix of type I functional distance (dF), defined as dF = -ln(1 - θ), was created
by using all θ values of all pairwise clusters. As the independence assumption, dF(A, B) = bF(A) + bF(B), the functional branch length of a given cluster, bF, was estimated
by non-negative least-square method implemented by
MATLAB software.
Homologous molecular modelling
The homologous models of the VFTMs of class C GPCRs
were generated using x-ray crystal structures of rat
mGluR1 [PDB: 1EWK] and two PBPs from Escherichia coli

[PDB: 2LIV and 2LBP] as templates. Models were manually refined with ViTO [44] using the sequence alignment
of the rat mGluR1 VFTM. Final models were built using
Modeler9v3 [45] and evaluated using dynamic evolutionary trace as implemented in ViTO. The figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera software [46].
Test of positive selection on the VFTMs
In order to estimate positive selection of the VFTMs, three
models, M0 (one ratio), M1 (near neutral) and M2 (positive selection), were conducted by the CODEML program
implemented in PAML4b package [47] based on the
codon of VFTMs-coding sequences. The nonsynonymous/
synonymous substitution rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) indicating
the difference of selective constraints was also calculated.
Assuming that the synonymous substitution is virtually
neutral, ω > 1 indicates positive selection, ω < 1 indicates
negative selection, and ω ≈ 1 indicates neutral evolution
[39]. If the alternative model indicates that an estimated
ω > 1 and the likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, 2Δ< =
2(<1-<0), is greater than the corresponding critical values
of the χ2 distribution, then positive selection can be
inferred [48].

Additional File 2
The percentage distribution of sites involved in altered functional constrains within class C GPCRs. Using class C GPCRs, 269 sites were
investigated based on posterior probability (Qk). Compared with other
groups, GB2 showed significant changes in altered functional constrains
while GB1 did not reveal variable change. T1R and CaSR showed no
altered functional constrains as they belong to the same group of sensing
receptors in class C GPCRs.

Reconstruction of ancestral sequences
The ancestral amino acid sequences were inferred by distance-based Bayesian method implemented by the Ancestor program [49]. The alignment of present-day sequences
and the NJ tree topologies were used to estimate each
ancestral node based on the branch length and the JTT
model of amino acid substitution. The result was evaluated by the average accuracy.
