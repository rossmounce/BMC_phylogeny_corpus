Abstract
Background: Lily symptomless virus (LSV) is widespread in many countries where lily are grown or planted, and causes
severe economic losses in terms of quantity and quality of flower and bulb production. To study the structure-function
relationship of coat protein (CP) of LSV, to investigate antigenic relationships between coat protein subunits or intact
virons, and to prepare specific antibodies against LSV, substantial amounts of CP protein are needed.
Results: Thus, full-length cDNA of LSV coat protein was synthesized and amplified by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from
LSV Lanzhou isolate. The extended 33.6 kDa CP was cloned and expressed prokaryoticly and then purified by Ni-ion
affinity chromatography. Its identity and antigenicity of recombinant CP were identified on Western-blotting by using
the prepared anti-LSV antibodies.
Conclusions: The results indicate that fusion CP maintains its native antigenicity and specificity, providing a good
source of antigen in preparation of LSV related antibodies. Detailed structural analysis of a pure recombinant CP should
allow a better understanding of its role in cell attachment and LSV tropism. This investigation to LSV should provide
some specific antibodies and aid to development a detection system for LSV diagnostics and epidemiologic surveys.
Background
Lanzhou lily (L. davidii Duch.var) is an important bulb
edible crop which mostly distributes in middle area of
Gansu province in China. Virus infection caused serious
reduction in production of Lanzhou lily and other economic corps in recent years [1,2]. Lily symptomless virus
(LSV; family, Genus Carlavirus, species) is the most prevalent virus infecting Lanzhou lily [2], and it has been
reported in USA, Europe, Australia and Asia [3-7]. It is
also one of the most harmful viruses of lilies that causes
severe losses in terms of quantity as well as quality of bulb
and flower production[8]. The host range of LSV is
mostly distributed in genus Lilium, however, in one case
reported in Alstroemeria[9]. The observed abnormalities
such as growth reduction, smaller flowers and lower bulb
yield can be caused by combined infection with LSV and

cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) [8] which threatens the
yield and commercial production of lily plants.
LSV contains a filamentous viral particle, 640 nm in
length and 17-18 nm in diameter. The genomic RNA of
LSV is constituted of 8,394 nucleotides (excluding the
poly (A) tail) and contains six open reading frames
(ORFs) coding for proteins of Mr 220 kDa (1,948 aa), 25
kDa (228 aa), 12 kDa (106 aa), 7 kDa (64 aa), 32 kDa (291
aa) and 16 kDa (140 aa) from the 5' to 3' end respectively,
composed of monopartite, single-stranded, plus sense
RNA molecules. The ORF5 (7140-8015 nts) encodes a CP
of 291 aa and genomic RNA of LSV is encapsidated by the
single type of CP with a Mr of 32 kDa [10,11]. The 3' terminal of carlavius group is linked with a poly (A) tail
[12,13].
In this study, we cloned, expressed and purified a complete coat protein of LSV and prepared polyclonal antibodies for the recombinant protein. As a result this
experiment was to demonstrate the antigenicity of
recombinant LSV CP and to aid to further development
of an efficient immunoassay for LSV diagnostics and epidemiologic surveys for Lanzhou lily.

Results and discussion
RT-PCR and construction of expression vector

The expected 900 bp cDNA encoding LSV CP was amplified by RT-PCR from isolated RNA. The constructed
plasmid for expression has been checked by gene
sequencing.
Expression, Purification and identification

Colonies presenting the strongest amplicon of the
expected size were chosen for small-scale expression trials to determine the best harvesting time. Shows one such
experiment, in which maximum expression was attained
at 5-6 h after IPTG induction. By 1 h after induction, an
additional remarkable band of approximately 34.5 kDa
could be detected among the endogenous bacterial proteins in Coomassie blue stained gel, becoming increasingly evident during the following 6 h. The purified
protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and a western blotting was carried out with anti-LSV polyclonal antibody.
Specific blotting bands were detected at the corresponding positions (Fig.1a and 1b). Apparently molecular mass
of the purified protein was about 34.5 kDa as expected.
These results demonstrated an intact immunologic reactivity of the recombinant CP of LSV. The yield was about
8.32 mg purified LSV CP from 1000 ml of bacterial culture after a single step of Ni2+ affinity chromatography.
The recovery of LSV CP was about 26%. A NcoI site containing a ATG codon was used so that the N-terminal of
the recombinant protein without surplus amino residues
was finally obtained. However a downstream hexahistidine stretch of pET28a(+) was taken advantage of and a
13-amino acid residues C-terminal extension was followed the native LSV coat protein. Recombinant LSV CP
obtained in this way has an only 13-amino acid extension
in C-terminal.
MALDI-ToF MS and phylogenetic analysis

The MALDI-ToF mass spectrum of tryptic digest of the
gel band of His-CP was shown in Fig.2a. The achieved
peptide masses were searched against NCBInr database
without any species limitation and with peptide mass tolerance of ± 0.1 Da by using the Mascot search engine.
The first candidate protein, with a score of 192, was coat
protein of LSV isolated from India (Genbank CAE51028).
The second to the 23th candidate proteins had scores
from 82 to 178, those were all coat proteins of various isolates of LSV, and protein scores greater than 67 were significant (p < 0.05). 15 of 28 mass values of searched
peptide fragments were matched with tryptic digested
peptides of LSV CP, and the sequence coverage was 58%.
After BLAST searches against protein sequence databases in GenBank, significant levels (98-80%) amino acid
sequences identity among CP of LSV and some other
virus was clearly revealed. A high level of identity was
found with some LSV isolates which had been reported
([11,14] and considerable similarities were found with

scorch virus [Genbank: AAY18407], Potato Virus P [Genbank: ABF59717], Potato rough dwarf virus [Genbank:
ABG21368], Ligustrum necrotic ringspot virus [Genbank:YP_002985640], Potato latent virus [Genbank:
YP_002302561] (Fig.3). Multiple alignments of the CP
sequences among the above-mentioned virus revealed an
overall homology among isolates.
Antigenicity analysis of recombinant CP

The antigenicity based on primary structure and partly
putative secondary structure was analyzed by software
ANTHEPROT V 4.3c (Fig.4). There are some obvious differences in antigenicity between two analysis which
derived by these two methods described by Parker et al.
and Welling et al. respectively. The former shown a stronger antigenicity of from N terminal to 100 aa of the LSV
CP, although from 260 aa to 300 aa of the LSV CP shown
a relative stronger antigenicity also, while the later indicate that antigenicity almost distributed evenly of the
whole protein sequence of LSV CP. From the prediction
of secondary structures, the LCP contains 38% α-Helix,
10% β-Sheet, 4% β-Turn and 48% Coil structures. By analysis
of
antigenicity,
peptides
1-37
(MESRPAQESGSASETPARGRPTPSDAPRDEPTNYNNN), 50-59(IEKLNAEKHN), 67-87(FEIGRPSLEPTSAMRRNPANP),194-201(MLVRNQPP),253275(QLALDRSNRNERLGNLETEYTGG),
281290(IVRNHRYANN) of all 304 amino acid residues are
located in antigenic determinants dense regions. These
peptides mostly belong to Coil structures. All of these
antigenic determinants dense regions sum up 109 amino
acid residues, account for 36% of the whole protein. It can
be predicted that most antibodies contained in the polyclonal antibodies are specific against antigenic determinants presented among these peptides of the protein.
After completion of renaturation, tertiary structure conformation of recombinant LCP should be farthest similar
to that of native CP, as a consequence, it will keep most of
antigenicities of native one. An intact viral particle of LSV
is assembled by a viral RNA molecule and about 1800 CP
subunits. Intact virus contains total, or at least most antigenicities of coat protein, but part of these antigenic
determinants are blocked due to hindrance from space
conformation among subunits, whereas some new antigenic determinants which are derived from more complex structure of aggregated subunits are brought about.
Thus, cross-antigenicities occurred between intact virus
and individual subunits are those antigenic determinants
which are not blocked by hindrance from space conformation.
Charaterzition of Antibodies

By double immunodiffusion test, titres of anti His-CP of
LSV antibodies can reach to a 1/1024 dilution, this result

knowledge, LSV degraded by pyrrolidine are small fragments or even subunits for coat protein. Here we take
advantage of ultrasonic degraded fragments of intact LSV
as antigenic components in double immunodiffusion.
However, there aren't substantial differences between
pyrrolidine degraded and ultrasonic degraded LSV. It can
be demonstrated that ALCP is able to react satisfyingly
with both of intact virus and degraded viral fragments. As
an excellent result, the recombinant LSV CP can undertake an antigenic reagent for providing valuable resources
for LSV diagnostics and epidemiologic surveys.

Conclusions
The results indicate that fusion CP maintains its native
antigenicity and specificity, providing a good source of
antigen in preparation of LSV related antibodies.
Detailed structural analysis of a pure recombinant CP
should allow a better understanding of its role in cell
attachment and LSV tropism. This investigation to LSV
should provide some specific antibodies and aid to development a detection system for LSV diagnostics and epidemiologic
surveys.

also verified the strong specificity to components of
native LSV in respect with the antibody. By bleeding and
separation of antiserum and DEAE cellulose column
purification, anti-LSV CP IgG (ALCP) was isolated.
A 34.5 kDa specific blotting band was detected at the
corresponding position by Western blotting (Fig.5). The
results showed that the native coat protein of LSV also
reacted positively to ALCP raised against recombinant
His-tagged CP. Furthermore, both results of double
immunodiffusion and Western blotting demonstrate that
ALCP does have a high specificity to native and denatured CP of LSV. As a result, antigenicity of recombinant
LSV CP has also been identified. These results seem to
have some contradictions with conclusion that intact LSV
and pyrrolidine degraded LSV have very few antigenic
determinants in common or none at all [15]. To our

The E. coli strains DH5α and BL21(DE3) were used for
cloning experiments and protein expressions, respectively. Both strains were purchased from Invitrogen
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The plasmid pUCm-T
vector was used for cloning and amplification of LSV CP
cDNA and the plasmid pET28a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt,
Germany) was used for protein expression. The plasmids
were from Sangon and Novagen, respectively. Restriction
enzymes, MMLV reverse transcriptase Taq DNA polymerase, and T4 ligase were purchased from Promega and
used according to supplier's recommendations.
Sample preparation for DAS-ELISA

Naturally infected Lanzhou Lily were sample in Xiguoyuan (Lanzhou, China) then tested by DAS-ELISA kit
(Agdia, USA) according to manufacturer's instruction. 20
g of LSV positive tissue of leaves was crashed and put into
liquid nitrogen, 40 ml of Extraction Buffer and 30 ml of
chloroform was subsequently added. By completing
homogenization, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 g
for 15 min. When supernatant was filtered by a sterile filter, 8% (w/v) of PEG 6000 was slowly added to the preparation and then stored overnight at 4°C. Then a
centrifugation at 5000 g for 30 min was carried out and
the precipitate was collected and resuspanded in 1 ml
pH7.2 0.1 mol/L PB.
RNA isolation, Reverse transcriptase-PCR and cDNA cloning

The viral RNA of LSV was extracted with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction.
The first strand cDNA was synthesized by the MMLV

the protocol described by 15 Nie and Singh (2000). Two
primers LCP1 (5'-CACCATGGAATCAAGACCAGCAC-3') and LCP2 (5'-ATAAGCTTTCCATAATTTGCGTATCG-3') were designed according to DQ531052
of NCBI (Wang et al., 2007). The sequences underlined
are the recognition sites of the restriction enzymes NcoI
and HindIII. Takara Ex taq (Takara, Japan) DNA polymerase was used in amplification (94°C for 45 s, 57°C for
45 s and 72°C for 1 min, 35 cycles). The amplicon was
introduced into the pUCm-T vector (BBI) and named
pLCP312, analyzing and quantification have been carried
out in agarose gel electrophoresis and in comparison with
the

marker.
Construction of CP expression plasmid

The plasmid pLCP312 was digested with NcoI and HindIII restriction enzymes and ligated into NcoI/HindIIIdigested pET28a(+) vector for 1 h at 16°C through a standard T4 DNA ligase procedure. The obtained plasmid
pLCP319 which carrying a His-tagged cp gene were
transferred to E. coli BL21(plys) and selected in LB plates
supplemented with 50 μg/ml of kanamycin.
Expression and Purification

The expression plasmid, pLCP319, containing the
expected sequence was used to transform competent E.

coli BL21(DE3). The bacterial cells were cultured in LB
broth contained 50 μg/ml kanamycin and shaken overnight at 37°C. Then culture was transferred into 50 ml
fresh LB medium and grown at 37°C with vigorous shaking. The following induction and identification of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) induced CP was
munupulated with standard procedure according to manufacture instructions. The lysate of cultured bacteria was
clarified at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and both the soluble
fraction and the pellet containing the insoluble fraction
(inclusion bodies) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The pellet of inclusion bodies was washed with 5 ml 0.01 M pH
8.0 Tris-HCl containing 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer,
and 2 M urea, and incubated at room temperature for 30
min. Then the purified inclusion bodies were solubilized
in denaturing buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer, and 8 M urea, pH 8.0), and incubated
on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min,
the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined.
The supernatant was filtered by a 0.45 μm filter and
then applied to an 5 ml His-Trap HP pre-packed column
(Amersham Biosciences) using an ÄKTA basic 100 Purification System (GE Healthcare, USA) followed by washing
the column with Wash Buffer (8 M urea, 25 mM imida-

zole in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0), the protein of interest
was then eluted with Elution buffer (8 M urea 250 mM
imidazole in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). The purified protein solution was quantified as described of Lowry et al
(1951) in respect to standardization with bovine serum
albumin, and estimated by its molar extinction coefficient
at 280 nm.
SDS-PAGE and Western-blotting analysis

Samples from induced bacterial culture and purified HisLSV CP were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized
by Coomassie blue R250 staining and then electroblotted
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) using a SemiDry Transfer System (Bio-Rad) at 100 mA for 1 h. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubating the
membrane in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20)
and 5% slim milk at room temperature overnight. The
blot was incubated 1 h at 37°C in PBST containing rabbit
anti-LSV (intact virus preparations) polyclonal antibodies
(1:200). Finishing washing with PBST, the membrane was
incubated with digoxigenin-dUTP-linked goat anti-rabbit
IgG for 90 min. Signal detection was performed with
anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugated Fab

fragments and CSPD-star ready-to-use From Roche
Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN, USA). All
experiments were performed at least three times with
similar results.
MALDI-ToF MS, Database searching for His-CP

His-CP of LSV containing band was cut from the gel and
destained overnight with a solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 40% ethanol. The protein was digested
in gel with trypsin (Promega). Peptide mass mapping was
performed by matrix assisted laser desorption-ionisation/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) using a Proteomics System I (ABI, USA). The peptide map was acquired in reflectron positive-ion mode
with delayed extraction at a mass range of 600-4000 Da.
Peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and MS/MS data from
MALDI-TOF-MS were analyzed by searching against an
NCBInr database using GPS (Matrix Science, London)
search software. The relative molecular mass (Mr) range:
15-80 kD (1 Da mass tolerance), a minimum of four peptides must be matched and a maximum of one missed
tryptic cleavage point.

Antibody characterization
Figure 5 Antibody characterization. Characterization analysis of
polyclonal Antibodies against His-tagged LSV CP with Western blotting using native coat protein of LSV as antigen.

Production of Anti-LSV CP polyclonal antibodies

By using prepared His-tagged LSV CP to immunize rabbits, antisera were produced. Immunization was carried
out by subcutaneously injecting several sites into rabbits
with 1 mg of purified His-LSV CP, emulsified with an
equal amount of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma,
USA). Boost was followed in the same dosage with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma, USA) injecting subcutaneously or intramuscularly at every two weeks for 4
times. 10 days after last injection, titres of blood were
determinated by a double immunodiffusion, 0.1 mg/ml of
purified LSV (Lanzhou isolate) was employed as antigen
in this test. When the titres reached to more than 1/64
dilution, terminal bleeding and isolating the antisera were
performed. Polyclonal antibodies were purified by precipitation with ammonium sulphate and passaged
through a column of DEAE cellulose, and designated as
ALCP.
