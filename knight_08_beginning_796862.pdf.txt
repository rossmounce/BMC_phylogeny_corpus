Abstract
The advanced sensory, psychological and social abilities of chimpanzees confer upon them a
profound ability to suffer when born into unnatural captive environments, or captured from the
wild – as many older research chimpanzees once were – and when subsequently subjected to
confinement, social disruption, and involuntary participation in potentially harmful biomedical
research. Justifications for such research depend primarily on the important contributions
advocates claim it has made toward medical advancements. However, a recent large-scale
systematic review indicates that invasive chimpanzee experiments rarely provide benefits in excess
of their profound animal welfare, bioethical and financial costs. The approval of large numbers of
these experiments – particularly within the US – therefore indicates a failure of the ethics
committee system. By 2008, legislative or policy bans or restrictions on invasive great ape
experimentation existed in seven European countries, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In
continuing to conduct such experiments on chimpanzees and other great apes, the US was almost
completely isolated internationally. In 2007, however, the US National Institutes of Health National
Center for Research Resources implemented a permanent funding moratorium on chimpanzee
breeding, which is expected to result in a major decline in laboratory chimpanzee numbers over
the next 30 years, as most are retired or die. Additionally, in 2008, The Great Ape Protection Act was
introduced to Congress. The bill proposed to end invasive research and testing on an estimated
1,200 chimpanzees confined within US laboratories, and, for approximately 600 federally-owned,
to ensure their permanent retirement to sanctuaries. These events have created an unprecedented
opportunity for US legislators, researchers, and others, to consider a global ban on invasive
chimpanzee research. Such a ban would not only uphold the best interests of chimpanzees, and
other research fields presently deprived of funding, but would also increase the compliance of US
animal researchers with internationally-accepted animal welfare and bioethical standards. It could
even result in the first global moratorium on invasive research, for any non-human species, unless
conducted in the best interests of the individual or species.

Introduction
Ending US chimpanzee experimentation
On 17th April, 2008, a bi-partisan political group introduced The Great Ape Protection Act to US Congress. The bill
proposed to end invasive research and testing on an estimated 1,200 chimpanzees confined within US laborato-

ries – some for over 40 years. For approximately 600
federally-owned, the bill would also ensure permanent
retirement to sanctuaries [1].
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett, who – along with others –
introduced this new bill, stated: "As a scientist who worked

with chimpanzees on research projects, I believe the time has
come to limit invasive research on these animals and rigorously
apply existing alternatives."
Within the US, laboratory chimpanzee numbers had previously soared when the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) implemented a breeding program in 1986 to meet
the demands of researchers seeking to study the newlyemergent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
epidemic. Following the failure of the chimpanzee model
to produce clinically useful outcomes, however, in 2007
the NIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)
made permanent a breeding moratorium temporarily
implemented in 1995 [2,3]. Numbers steadily declined
thereafter, and by October 2006, 1,133 chimpanzees
remained within six US primate centers [2].
Finances played a large role in the NCRR decision to
reduce chimpanzee numbers. With captive chimpanzees
living an average of 30 (males) to 45 (females) years, the
lifetime costs of supporting them are estimated as
between $300,000 and $500,000 [3]. NCRR figures indicate that 650 federally-funded chimpanzees will cost a
total of $325 million to support [2]. Although privatelyfunded research chimpanzees remain unaffected, the
NCRR decision is nevertheless expected to result in a
major decline in laboratory chimpanzee numbers over the
next 30 years, as most are retired or die.
Hence, whether through legislation or budgetary restriction, invasive chimpanzee research may be drawing to a
close within the US. Furthermore, these events may herald
the beginning of the end for chimpanzee experimentation
internationally. Although around half a dozen other
countries also conducted chimpanzee experiments 15
years ago, by 2008 the US stood virtually alone. Every
other country except perhaps Gabon – whose future plans
were unclear – had ceased invasive chimpanzee experimentation. Should the US and Gabon also terminate such
research, it would effectively result in the first global moratorium on invasive research for any non-human species,
unless conducted in the best interests of the individual or
species.
International bans on great ape experimentation
The NCRR decision followed a campaign by the Humane
Society of the US which resulted in nearly 22,000 letters to
the NCRR [4]. Other US animal protection organizations
such as the New England Anti-Vivisection Society [3] and
In Defense of Animals [5], and international organizations such as the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection [6], have similarly initiated campaigns against
chimpanzee or great ape (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas
and orang-utans) experimentation, in recent times. This
increasing focus of animal protection organizations is

http://www.peh-med.com/content/3/1/16

mirrored by increasing public concern about invasive
experimentation on chimpanzees and other great apes,
given their relatively advanced sensory, psychological and
social capabilities. This concern has contributed to a
growing number of national bans against invasive experiments on great apes.
In the UK, special justifications for experiments on great
apes became necessary under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and in 1997 a policy ban was placed on
such experiments by the Home Office [7-9]. Great ape
experimentation has also been banned in Sweden (regulatory restrictions since 2003, with the exception of noninvasive behavioral studies), and Austria (since 2006,
unless conducted in the interests of the individual animal). Unusually, the Austrian ban also protects gibbons,
which is in line with current taxonomic classification
including gibbons within the family Hominidae [3,9].
The Netherlands was the last European country to conduct invasive research on chimpanzees. It outlawed great
ape experimentation from 2004 [3,9].
In countries such as Italy and Norway, great apes have not
been used for years, although national bans have yet to be
passed. Since 1992 (personal communication: Kolar R,
German Animal Welfare Academy, Neubiberg; 17 Apr.
2008), great apes have not been subjected to invasive
research within Germany, although non-invasive cognitive and behavioral studies do occur. In 2002, the Belgian
minister responsible for animal welfare announced that
Belgium would be working toward a ban on all primate
experiments, and a Swiss state ethics commission recently
demanded that the Swiss government ban great ape experimentation [3,6,9-14].
Japan ceased invasive research on chimpanzees in 2006
[15]. In Australia and New Zealand, great ape experimentation is restricted by policy (Australia) [16], or legislation
(New Zealand, since 1999) [9,17]; unless in the best interests of the individual animal or species.
Related developments continue to occur internationally.
The European Principality of Liechtenstein imposed a
total ban on animal experiments in 1989 [18]. In 2007,
the Republic of San Marino similarly banned all animal
experiments [19-21], and the Balearic Islands – one of the
Autonomous Communities of Spain – granted basic legal
rights to great apes. Due to the popularity of this development, the Spanish government was considering expanding it to include all of Spain [22].
In late 2007, 433 Members of the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) signed Parliamentary Written Declaration 40/2007, calling for urgent action to end the use of
great apes and wild-caught monkeys in experiments, and

Page 2 of 14

Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine 2008, 3:16

for the establishment of a timetable for the cessation of all
European primate experiments. This number of signatories was the highest recorded for any Written Declaration
on an animal protection issue, and the third highest for a
Declaration of any kind, since 2000. The Declaration
must be formally considered by European Commission
officials when drawing up applicable legislation. It calls
for changes to European Directive 86/609/EEC on the Protection of Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific
Purposes, which governs animal use within European
Union (EU) member states. By mid 2008, a formal revision of Directive 86/609/EEC was nearing completion. The
Directive presently allows experiments on all non-human
primates (NHPs), around 10,000 of which are subjected
to experiments within Europe annually, with the greatest
recorded use occurring within the UK, followed by France
and Germany [23,24].
Stated UK MEP Dr Caroline Lucas, "The EU is currently
reviewing its rules on laboratory animals, and we must use this
opportunity to immediately ban the use of primates in experiments anywhere in the EU, in favour of more modern and effective alternatives like computer modelling, tissue or cell cultures
and micro-dosing" [24].
Swedish MEP Jens Holm similarly stated, "It is time to end
experiments on primates. Primates are sentient beings and are
fully capable of having feelings like humans: joy, happiness or
anger. Their interests must be fully taken into account, and cruelty against them must stop." [24].
Chimpanzee 'personhood'? A legal challenge
In Austria a noteworthy campaign to grant legal protection to an individual chimpanzee was being hotly contested in 2007 – 2008. Based on scientific argument that
chimpanzees possess a 'theory of mind,' and ought to be
classified within the genus Homo, advocates sought recognition under Austrian law of the 'personhood' of a chimpanzee named Matthew Pan.

Matthew has passed a mirror self-recognition test, demonstrated tool use and understanding, drawn pictures, and
played with human caretakers. His advocates assert that
chimpanzees in general, and Matthew in particular, have
demonstrated ample evidence consistent with a theory of
mind [25-29].
However, theories of mind are scientifically controversial
for animals [30]. Recent evidence that suggests that in
many respects chimpanzees possess the necessary mental
characteristics, whereas in others they might not. Solid
evidence exists that chimpanzees understand the goals,
intentions, perception and knowledge of others. Nevertheless, despite several apparently valid attempts, evidence remains lacking that they understand false beliefs.

http://www.peh-med.com/content/3/1/16

It therefore appears chimpanzees may understand others
in terms of a perception-goal psychology, as opposed to
the belief-desire psychology more characteristic of
humans [31]. Ongoing scientific interest within this field
is evidenced by recent symposia [32].
It nevertheless remains clear that chimpanzees in general,
and Matthew in particular, possess the ability to reason,
and to recognize the interests of others, which are key
requirements, Matthew's advocates argue, for recognition
of 'personhood' under Austrian law.
The proposed re-classification of chimpanzees within the
genus Homo rests on the very high degree of similarity
between chimpanzee and human DNA [33,34]. Advocates state that the similarities are roughly equivalent to
those of some other species classified within the same
genus, such as certain equines [29]. However, critics assert
that the remaining differences result in neuroanatomical,
other morphological, cognitive, behavioral and additional phenotypic variation sufficient to justify the unique
taxonomic classification of humans [35,36].
If Matthew's advocates ultimately succeed on his behalf,
Matthew could no longer be legally considered property.
He would also become eligible for legal guardianship, on
the basis that he was abducted as an infant, involuntarily
confined in an alien environment for most of his lifetime,
and is consequently unable to fend for himself, or safeguard his own interests. Through such a guardian Matthew would be able to receive donations toward his living
costs, and even – potentially – sue those responsible for
his capture in West Africa in 1982, for AIDS and hepatitis
research [29,37,38]. Matthew's case is highly controversial, and the legal and philosophical ramifications would
be enormous, should his case be upheld.
By early 2008, Matthew's legal advocates had not succeeded within the Austrian courts, and were planning to
pursue his case within the European Court of Human
Rights. Whether or not they are ultimately successful, rapidly growing interest in this field – including the publication of detailed legal foundations supporting the legal
'personhood' of chimpanzees [39] – strongly suggests that
Matthew's case is unlikely to be the last of its kind.
Retirement of laboratory chimpanzees
Opinion is also growing that chimpanzees should be
retired at the end of their involvement in biomedical
research, into sanctuaries capable of providing for their
social and psychological well-being, for the remainder of
their natural lives [5,40-43]. The US Chimpanzee Health
Improvement, Maintenance and Protection Act 2000, for
example, requires that chimpanzees no longer needed for
biomedical research be retired to sanctuaries. The US

Chimp Haven is Home Act 2007 repealed provisions of the
Public Health Service Act 1946 that had permitted the
removal of chimpanzees from the federal sanctuary system, for research purposes. The Chimp Haven is Home Act
prohibits the use of such chimpanzees for research, other
than within noninvasive behavioral studies [44].
Perhaps the first large-scale retirement of laboratory chimpanzees occurred in 2002, when Baxter Healthcare Corporation transferred over 40 chimpanzees, and more than 80
monkeys, from its Hans Popper Primate Center (HPPC)
outside of Vienna, Austria, to the Home of Primates –
Europe, Safaripark, Gänserndorf, Austria. For many years
the Center had used these primates to test putative vaccines for viruses such as hepatitis B and C (HBV and
HCV), HIV, and therapeutic plasma proteins such as Factor VIII. Both the advent of alternative testing systems and
a change in research focus led to Baxter's 1998 decision to
end non-human primate testing at HPPC and seek a permanent retirement site [45].
In 2002 the Netherlands agreed to fund the re-homing of
chimpanzees by the charitable foundation Stichting Aap
[42]. The Dutch national colony of over 100 chimpanzees
were relocated to sanctuaries, zoos and safari parks. In
2007 similar efforts were underway in Japan [3].
Within the US, the New York Blood Centre (NYBC) plans
to retire 74 chimpanzees used in its hepatitis research programs at its Vilab laboratories in Robertsfield, Liberia. The
chimpanzees will be retired to six remote African islands,
purchased from the Liberian Government to provide a
sanctuary [46]. The NYBC no longer considers such chimpanzee experiments acceptable on ethical and welfare
grounds, believing that "there are new methods for doing this
kind of research." [3,47].

the US. Although US animal research is governed by international, federal, and state laws, regulations, rules, guidelines, and standards [50], contrary to the legislation of
other key countries, the US Animal Welfare Act 1966 (most
recently amended in 1990) does not require the use of
non-animal alternatives, even when scientifically validated alternatives exist. Unsurprisingly, therefore, US primate use is more than five times in excess of the number
used in the entire European Union (approximately
58,000 vs. 11,000 annually; [13]).
Advancements in biomedical knowledge?
When assessing the merits of invasive chimpanzee experimentation, a necessary first step is to obtain a definitive
overview of the disciplines investigated by such research.
Accordingly, I recently surveyed three major biomedical
bibliographic databases and examined published studies
conducted worldwide from 1995 – 2004 [51].

I sought to assess the value of research on captive chimpanzees, particularly when invasive – that is, involving the
entry of a needle, catheter or other instrument within the
body, by puncture or incision – because such research
incurs the greatest bioethical and social concerns. I
included studies of captive chimpanzees or their tissues,
and excluded studies of free-living populations, veterinary
medical case reports of naturally-ill chimpanzees –
whether or not in captivity, most genome studies, studies
of skeletal anatomy – which frequently used museum
specimens, and studies of cell lines (although I did
include cell samples, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, obtained from captive chimpanzees).
749 studies of chimpanzees or their tissues were located
that met my inclusion criteria, of which 48.5% (363/749)
were biological experiments, and 41.5% (311/749) were
virological experiments (Figure 1).

Calls for increased chimpanzee use
Apparently seeking to counter increasing international
opinion against invasive chimpanzee experimentation,
advocates have recently begun extolling its alleged benefits, calling for its continuation. In a recent, prominent
plea in Nature for increased funding for such research, several heads of US primate research centers stated that chimpanzee experimentation has been of critical importance
during struggles against major human diseases [48]. Similarly, British scientists recently called for the right to conduct such research on chimpanzees, contrary to the
existing UK ban, in rare scenarios, such as the investigation of dangerous emerging infectious diseases [49].

Discussion
Rapid international developments within this field justify
a re-examination of the merits of invasive chimpanzee
experimentation. Such a reappraisal is most applicable to

Biological studies were conducted within nine broad disciplines (Figure 2), of which the most common were cognition/neuroanatomy/neurology (36.6%, 133/363), and
behavior/communication (20.7%, 75/363).
41.5% (311/749) of all chimpanzee experiments were
virological studies. Thirty viruses were investigated, of
which the most frequent were HCV and HIV (both 31.2%,
97/311) (Figure 3).
The remaining experiments comprised therapeutic investigations (3.5%, 26/749) – namely, pharmacological, toxicological and anesthesiological investigations, and the
testing of surgical techniques or prostheses; investigations
of eight parasitic species (3.1%, 23/749) – of which the
most frequent were the malaria protozoa Plasmodium falciparum and P. ovale (26.1%, 6/23), the roundworm
Onchocerca volvulus (21.7%, 5/23), and the flatworm
Schistosoma mansoni (17.4%, 4/23); and other diseases
and miscellaneous experiments, which jointly comprised
3.5% (26/749) of all chimpanzee experiments.

comprehensive bibliographic databases. 49.5% (47/95;
95% CI = 39.6 – 59.4%) were not cited by any subsequent
papers (Figure 4).
Given that almost all of these chimpanzee experiments
would have been approved by at least one institutional
ethics committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee – IACUC – within the US), entrusted with
ensuring that their welfare-related, bioethical and financial costs were reasonably likely to be exceeded by their
expected benefits, it is disturbing that half of these randomly-selected experiments were not cited by any subsequent papers. The year of publication did not appear to
substantially affect this outcome, as citation frequencies
were similar across the decade, with more recent papers
cited approximately as often as older papers.
Citation frequencies are not, of course, a definitive indication of the benefits or lack thereof, of scientific research.
Uncited studies may also contribute to the advancement

On the face of it, these studies appear to have contributed
toward a large array of biomedical disciplines. However,
not all knowledge has significant value, nor is worth the
bioethical, financial or other costs that may be incurred in
gaining that knowledge. To gain a more critical assessment of the utility of invasive chimpanzee research in
advancing biomedical knowledge, I randomly selected a
statistically-significant subset of 95 experiments, and
determined the frequency with which they were cited by
papers subsequently published and included within these

statistically-significant subset of 95 randomly-selected
chimpanzee studies had been cited by papers describing
prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic methods efficacious in combating human diseases.

of biomedical knowledge, through a variety of mechanisms. However, citation frequencies do generally provide
a quantifiable and reasonably objective approximation of
utility, or lack thereof. Research that makes a significant
contribution to a field – such as by confirming or refuting
hypotheses – is very likely to be cited by future papers, as
is research that produces interesting or controversial outcomes. On the other hand, research that is inconclusive,
or of little interest or significance, is much less likely to be
cited.
The disappointing citation rate of these chimpanzee studies is therefore cause for considerable concern. It is unreasonable to conclude that a large number of studies made
a significant contribution, if none were cited by any future
publication, as occurred for half of these randomlyselected chimpanzee studies.
Given that much research of lesser significance is not published, these published chimpanzee experiments can generally be assumed to be those with the greatest potential
for advancing biomedical knowledge. Consequently,
these results indicate that the majority of invasive chimpanzee studies generate data of questionable value, which
makes little obvious contribution toward the advancement of biomedical knowledge.
Advancements in human healthcare?
Most would consider that the greatest justifications for
invasive chimpanzee research involve attempts to advance
human health. As stated, advocates of such research claim
it has been of critical importance during our struggles
against major human diseases [48]. To critically assess
such claims, I determined the frequency with which the

Only 14.7% (14/95; 95% CI = 8.9 – 23.4%) of all invasive
chimpanzee studies were cited by a total of 27 papers
describing well-developed diagnostic methods (5) or prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods (22) for combating
human diseases (Figure 4). Diseases examined included
cancer (non-specific), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis viruses A through G,
hepatocellular carcinoma, HIV, malaria, organ transplant
rejection, respiratory syncytial virus, rheumatoid arthritis,
rhinovirus colds, systemic lupus erythematous, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
As stated, citation rates are not a definitive indication of
utility or lack thereof. Invasive chimpanzee studies may
have contributed to medical advances through various
indirect means, such as by stimulating investigation of
certain lines of inquiry in humans – although it is unlikely
that any medical papers subsequently published would
not cite the chimpanzee studies that provided such inspiration. Alternatively, chimpanzee studies may have contributed to investigations of disease etiology, or to papers
describing prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic methods for combating human diseases in early stages of development – although potential human benefits, in such
cases, remain speculative.
However, it is reasonable to expect that if chimpanzee
research had truly been of critical importance during
struggles against major human diseases, as claimed by
advocates, such chimpanzee studies would, in fact, be
cited by papers describing methods efficacious in combating those diseases. The only alternative is that none of the
struggles to which chimpanzee research purportedly made
major contributions, resulted in effective, published solutions.
In fact, 27 papers describing well developed prophylactic,
diagnostic or therapeutic methods for combating human
diseases did cite chimpanzee studies. However, detailed
examination of these medical papers revealed that in vitro
studies, human clinical and epidemiological studies,
molecular assays and methods, and genomic studies, contributed most to their development.
The randomly-selected chimpanzee studies proved to be
of peripheral importance to most of these medical papers,
for a variety of reasons. 63.0% (17/27) were, in fact, wideranging reviews of 26–300 (median 104) references, to
which the cited chimpanzee study made a very small contribution.

Page 6 of 14

Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine 2008, 3:16

In 12 cases the chimpanzee studies appeared redundant,
as humans or human sera were studied concurrently, or
because they served only to confirm previous human
observations. In seven cases the method explored in the
cited chimpanzee study was not developed further, sometimes because later clinical trials in humans failed to demonstrate safety or efficacy, contrary to positive
chimpanzee results. In five cases the chimpanzee study
examined a disease or method of only peripheral relevance to the medical method described. In three cases the
chimpanzee study merely illustrated an historical finding,
or was cited only during historical discussions of attempts
to combat the disease in question. In another three cases
the chimpanzee studies yielded results inconsistent with
data from other NHP studies, and in two cases they
yielded results inconsistent with human data. In two more
cases only the human outcomes from human studies concurrently described within the cited chimpanzee studies
were discussed. In one case the chimpanzee study may
have helped establish the need for a new diagnostic
method, but did not contribute further to its development.
In fact, none of these cited chimpanzee studies demonstrated an essential contribution, or – in most cases – a significant contribution of any kind, toward the
development of the medical method described.
Limitations on the medical utility of chimpanzee models
These results suggest a lack of utility of chimpanzees as
experimental models for studying human diseases. On the
face of it, this appears counter-intuitive, given the genetic
similarities of chimpanzees and humans. Our two species
shared a common ancestor just 5–7 million years ago [52]
– a very short period in phylogenetic terms.

A 2005 draft of the chimpanzee genome confirmed it to
be 98.77% identical to the mean human genome in terms
of base pairs [53]. When considering only the most functional DNA – that is, bases that cannot be altered without
a consequent change in the amino acid coded for by the
gene, as distinct from bases that may be altered without
such changes, or so-called 'junk' DNA outside coding
regions – Wildman and colleagues [33] found a 99.4%
correlation between chimpanzees and humans. However
insertions, deletions and consequent misalignments raise
the total estimated difference to around 4–5% [54,55].
While a minority of these genetic differences lie within
structural genes, most are now known to lie within the
regulatory regions of our DNA. By controlling the activities of structural genes, regulatory genes can exert an 'avalanche' effect upon hundreds of other genes.
Consequently, a small difference may have profound
effects [56]. Striking differences have been found in the

http://www.peh-med.com/content/3/1/16

levels of gene expression between chimpanzees and
humans, within the brain and liver, for example [57].
Although chimpanzees and humans differ in only 4–5%
of their DNA, that difference is sufficiently important to
result in a difference of around 80% in protein expression
[58], yielding marked phenotypic differences between the
species.
Additionally, systemic responses to disease agents and test
chemotherapeutics within laboratory chimpanzees may
be distorted by the neurological, endocrinological and
immunological abnormalities that may result from a variety of experienced stressors. Although when between studies chimpanzees may be housed within social groups,
with access to enlarged, environmentally-enriched enclosures, during study participation laboratory housing may
be small, barren and standardized, and chimpanzees may
experience isolation, trauma, chronic boredom, and a
variety of stressful laboratory procedures [59].
The substantial differences in protein expression between
chimpanzees and humans, and the further distortions of
normal physiology that may result from stressful laboratory environments and procedures, confer differences in
the susceptibility to, etiology and progression of various
diseases; differing absorption, tissue distribution, metabolism and excretion of chemotherapeutic agents; and differences in the toxicity and efficacy of pharmaceuticals.
Whilst it is true that interspecies differences in response
may sometimes be illuminating – for example, during elucidation of disease mechanisms – it is generally more
desirable that experimental models mimic human
responses as accurately as possible, within experiments
aimed toward the development of prophylactic, diagnostic, or therapeutic methods for combating human diseases. The lack of fidelity, or accurate reproduction, of key
human characteristics and responses, is the most likely
cause of the demonstrable lack of utility of chimpanzee
models during the development of methods efficacious in
combating human diseases.
Bioethically-relevant chimpanzee characteristics
Chimpanzees possess a range of advanced sensory, psychological and social characteristics, which may enhance
their potential for suffering, and are therefore morally relevant when considering the ethics of subjecting them to
invasive experimentation.
Pain perception
Whilst chimpanzees lack some of the most advanced
human neurological and cognitive capacities [60], it nevertheless remains true that they possess well-developed
neuroanatomical mechanisms common to vertebrates –
including nerve endings ('nociceptors') and peripheral

Page 7 of 14

and central neuroanatomical architecture – that confer the
ability to detect and perceive as painful a variety of noxious stimuli, including mechanical, chemical and thermal
insults. Such mechanisms evolved partly to encourage
avoidance of natural agents capable of causing tissue damage. These same mechanisms may result in pain perception when chimpanzees are exposed to invasive
procedures, noxious stimuli, or tissue damage secondary
to artificially-inflicted diseases or toxic agents.
Most – if not all – invasive experiments result in at least
mild physical discomfort, for example, during restraint
and venipuncture, and some may result in marked discomfort or pain. Whilst analgesic provision is adequate in
some cases, it is less so in others, partly due to concerns –
well-founded or otherwise – that experimental outcomes
may be altered by drug use. Whilst anaesthetic and analgesic use undoubtedly alters normal physiology, claims
that such alterations are sufficiently important to hypotheses under investigation, to warrant their exclusion,
require careful scrutiny. Despite increasing recognition
[61,62] that pain relief improves both animal welfare and
research quality – via minimization of pain-related physiological, psychological, behavioural or other animal
model distortion – pain monitoring and analgesic provision remains less than optimal within many animal
research protocols [63,64].

their complex natural environments and social structures
[66].
Social characteristics
Chimpanzees are highly social animals, and the disruption of social networks when animals are captured from
the wild – as many older research chimpanzees once were
– or when subjected to confinement or translocation during biomedical research, may add to their suffering. The
social relationships of chimpanzees appear to encompass
prolonged rearing of offspring, close and affectionate family bonds, friendship, and mourning behavior following
the deaths of companions [66]. Anecdotal accounts of
consolation of victims of aggression, and solicitous treatment of injured individuals, suggest that chimpanzees feel
empathy [80,81]. Chimpanzees plan for the future and
interact in a variety of cooperative activities, including territorial patrols, coalitionary aggression, cooperative hunting, food sharing and joint mate guarding [72,73,81].

Chimpanzees possess well-developed communicative
skills. Facial expressions [82] and sophisticated vocalizations [83-85] convey information, for example, about
identity [83], emotional states [82] and social status [84].
Chimpanzees kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the
back, embrace, tickle, punch and swagger [66], with gestural dialects varying between communities [86].

Emotional capacity
The potential suffering of laboratory chimpanzees is compounded by their relatively advanced emotional capabilities. They appear able to experience a range of emotions,
similar to those we label as happiness and sadness, fear
and anxiety, irritation, rage and despair [65-67], and
appear able to suffer emotional, as well as physical, pain
[59]. Psychological stress is likely to result both from aversive experiences directly, and from the inability of laboratory chimpanzees to escape them. Such considerations are
of greatest concern where pain or discomfort are substantial or prolonged.

Although chimpanzees appear to lack the ability to explicitly teach [60], they have some ability to learn through
observation, emulation and practice [87], although limitations on learning capacity have been recorded [88]. At
least 39 behavior patterns, including courtship, grooming, tool manufacturing and use, essentially comprising
discreet 'cultures,' are passed from generation to generation through such learning. As with human cultures and
customs, these have been shown to vary substantially
between chimpanzee communities [8,89], in ways that
cannot be attributed solely to ecological or genetic variation [90].

Psychological abilities
The relatively advanced capacities of chimpanzees to
understand and remember that certain people, tools or
procedures are likely to cause pain and distress, and their
ability to anticipate future aversive experiences, is likely to
compound the distress such events may cause. Chimpanzees have some capacity to anticipate and understand the
intentions and psychological states of others [68-71], and
have long memories [67,72-75]. The psychological abilities of chimpanzees may encompass abstract reasoning
[76], self-awareness (although mirror self-recognition
may decline with age) [66,77,78], and simple problem
solving [67,79]. These relatively advanced abilities most
probably evolved to enable chimpanzees to cope with

De Waal [91,92] asserted that the social sophistication of
chimpanzees is similar to that of humans, and that reciprocity among them is influenced by a similar sense of
moral 'rightness' and justice. Chimpanzees may reject
exchanges in which they value potential gains less than
potential losses, for example, but, as with humans, there
is no evidence that they are averse to interactions from
which they benefit [81].
Despite the relatively advanced sensory, psychological
and social sophistication of chimpanzees, certain morally-relevant dissimilarities with humans do exist. Recent
research suggests that human altruistic behavior – that is,
a willingness to incur costs to assist genetically-unrelated

http://www.peh-med.com/content/3/1/16

strangers, in the absence of any personal gain ('otherregarding preferences') – provides a key example. In contrast, assistance offered by chimpanzees and other NHPs
appears mainly limited to biologically-related or reciprocating individuals, and is rarely extended to unfamiliar
individuals [81,93], although such behavior has been
observed in common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) [94].

When applied in isolation, each of these viewpoints represents a diametrically opposite position, consistent with
ideological viewpoints that consider the interests of animals, or people, respectively, as overwhelmingly more
important than those of each other. Such viewpoints are
but two of a diverse range of religious, cultural and philosophical viewpoints about our moral duties toward animals and people that could be applied [96-98].

Bioethical considerations
During study participation chimpanzees may be individually confined within small, relatively barren, standardized cages [67], on the assumption that these facilitate
cage cleaning, minimize infection risks, and facilitate ease
of access, such as for blood sampling. They may be housed
in buildings lacking windows, without access to natural
lighting [66]. They may be involuntarily subjected to
potentially harmful experiments, including the artificial
induction of diseases, and tests of the toxicity and efficacy
of chemotherapeutic agents.

It is the opinion of this author, however, along with various philosophers [98,99], that achieving a reasonable and
rational balance between the interests of people and those
of laboratory animals requires balanced consideration of
the interests of both groups: primarily, the likely benefits
accruing to humans, and the probable costs incurred by
animal experimental subjects. Such a 'utilitarian' position
aims to achieve the 'greatest good for the greatest number,'
and considers the interests of all affected, whether human,
or other creatures likely to be capable of experiencing
states as 'good,' or less desirable.

It is reasonable to expect that the relatively advanced sensory, psychological and social characteristics of chimpanzees may enhance their capacity for suffering during
involuntary participation within invasive research protocols – and particularly, overtly harmful research. In the
opinion of some experts, such chimpanzee characteristics
render it impossible to provide laboratory environments
that satisfactorily meet their minimum physiological and
behavioral requirements [8,95].

Fortunately, in the case of invasive chimpanzee experimentation, it is possible to achieve a reasonable weighting
of interests, because concrete evidence about the likely
human benefits, and costs to chimpanzees, does exist.
Invasive chimpanzee experimentation allows investigation of a virtually limitless number of scientific questions.
However, as previously demonstrated, the majority of
such experiments appear to generate data of questionable
value, which makes little obvious contribution toward the
advancement of biomedical knowledge. Additionally,
such studies rarely – if ever – make significant contributions toward the development of methods efficacious in
combating human diseases [51]. The resource and financial burdens incurred by such research are also considerable – issues of no small importance, within a climate of
ever-increasing competition for scarce research resources.

Unanswered questions about the precise psychological
abilities of chimpanzees inevitably result in a degree of
uncertainty about the nature and magnitude of the suffering likely to result from such protocols and procedures.
However, where such doubt exists, it seems reasonable to
apply a precautionary principle – assuming that suffering
may occur, and considering restrictions on procedures
likely to cause such suffering – until proven otherwise.
Such precautionary principles are, after all, enshrined
within other fundamental social institutions, because
they are considered to be rational, reasonable and
humane. The Western legal system, for example, generally
assumes innocence until guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt. Where such doubt remains, judicial punishment is withheld.
Conversely, however, a precautionary principle might
also be applied in favor of human patients or consumers
that may potentially benefit from laboratory animal
experimentation: where healthcare advances or other
human utility may result, perhaps such experiments
should proceed, until lack of potential benefit is proven
beyond reasonable doubt.

The costs to chimpanzees enrolled in such experiments
include involuntary confinement within laboratory settings, social disruption, and participation within potentially-harmful research protocols. Recent studies have
established beyond any reasonable doubt that the effects
of laboratory confinement and procedures, especially
long-term, can be severe. Many captive great apes show
gross behavioral abnormalities, such as stereotypies, selfmutilation or other self-injurious behavior, inappropriate
aggression, fear or withdrawal [100,101], including
among chimpanzees recently retired from US laboratories
[102]. It is increasingly acknowledged that such abnormal
behaviors resemble symptoms associated with human
psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder,
and that pharmacological treatment modalities similar to
those applied to human patients may be appropriate, and

Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine 2008, 3:16

indeed, morally compelled, for severely disturbed animal
patients [100,103]. Long-term therapeutic combination
with positive reinforcement training, environmental
enrichment, and social and environmental modification
may be necessary in severe cases [101].
The analogous legal scenario is once again illuminating.
Although these highly sentient creatures are in no way
responsible for any human grievance, such as the serious
diseases we attempt to induce in them, we sometimes subject chimpanzees to conditions that would cause widespread social outrage if used to punish the most heinous
of human criminals – for years on end, and in some cases,
for decades. Bradshaw and colleagues [102] observed that:
"The costs of laboratory-caused trauma are immeasurable in
their life-long psychological impact on, and consequent suffering of, chimpanzees." As stated, humans are not usually
punished until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. It
is not altogether unreasonable to assert that the lack of
humanity highlighted by this difference in standards
applies less to chimpanzees, than to ourselves.
The logic of Bradshaw and colleagues' corollary is elementary, yet compelling: "In human traumatology, the first step
in treatment is to arrest its causes. This implies that prevention
and treatment of chimpanzee psychopathology entails considering the factors and institutions that have brought chimpanzees
to the point of irreversible distress: in simple terms, desisting
from using apes as biomedical subjects in lieu of humans is
compelled if trauma is not to be perpetuated."
The unique biological characteristics of chimpanzees –
which are rare in their own right – and their advanced sensory, psychological and social characteristics – which have
some similarities with those of humans – all create a
strong ethical basis for acknowledging the necessity of
respecting at least the most basic and essential interests of
chimpanzees, such as their interests in avoiding death,
pain, suffering and captivity [104,105]. When according
due consideration to the interests of both humans and
chimpanzees, it cannot be concluded that invasive chimpanzee experimentation is generally ethically justifiable.
Acceptable chimpanzee research?
Potential chimpanzee research protocols range from field
studies of free-living (wild) populations, through noninvasive behavioral or psychological studies of sanctuary
or laboratory populations, to mildly-harmful invasive
experimentation, more-harmful experimentation, and
finally, to include research protocols resulting in major
harm or death. According due respect to chimpanzee characteristics and associated bioethical considerations does
not require the termination of all chimpanzee research.
Bioethical concerns are minimized within non-invasive

http://www.peh-med.com/content/3/1/16

observational, behavioral or psychological studies of freeliving or sanctuary populations.
It is precisely the advanced psychological abilities of
chimpanzees that may incur marked welfare-related and
bioethical burdens during biomedical experimentation,
that also place chimpanzees at risk of boredom and associated pathology within sanctuary settings, unless highly
enriched. Offering such chimpanzees the choice to participate within behavioral or psychological studies, may, in
fact, constitute a valuable form of environmental enrichment [106]. Whilst participation remains truly voluntary,
rather than coerced through conditional provision of
essential needs, such as sufficient food, water, or social
contact with compatible conspecifics, bioethical concerns
are minimized. As stated, such studies are consistent with
existing bans on great ape experimentation in countries
such as Sweden, and consistent with the US Chimp Haven
is Home Act 2007, which prohibits further research on
chimpanzees retired to federal sanctuaries, other than
non-invasive behavioral studies [44].
Limiting chimpanzee experimentation to non-invasive
observational, behavioral or psychological studies of freeliving or sanctuary populations would inevitably restrict
the range of scientific questions that might be investigated. It would, however, strike the correct ethical balance
between satisfying the interests of chimpanzees, and those
of human beings.
Ecological considerations
Alarming declines in wild chimpanzee populations [107]
have led some to call for the maintenance of experimental
chimpanzee populations for conservation reasons. However, chimpanzees maintained in captive environments
other than very expansive, naturalistic settings, are
unlikely to retain the full range of abilities, characteristics
and behaviors demonstrated by wild chimpanzees. It is
not only the physical characteristics of chimpanzees that
are of scientific interest, or worthy of preservation, after
all. For reasons such as these, the ultimate objective of
genuine conservation programs is the maintenance or reestablishment of wild populations. Unfortunately, the
capacity of chimpanzees to recover from disturbance is
limited, and the reinforcement of wild populations with
captive-born individuals is rarely a realistic option [108].
Conservation efforts are therefore most appropriately
directed toward addressing the factors responsible for
declining wild chimpanzee populations – particularly,
habit destruction, hunting and the spread of Ebola haemorrhagic fever – through aggressive investments in law
enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention [107].

Conclusion
Few research issues generate as much controversy as invasive chimpanzee experimentation. The unequalled phylogenetic proximity of chimpanzees to humans makes them
potentially superior to all other laboratory species for use
as human models within toxicity experiments and pathological or therapeutic investigations it would be hazardous to conduct on humans. However, chimpanzees are
also associated with perhaps the greatest animal welfare
and bioethical concerns of any laboratory species, due to
their advanced sensory, psychological and social characteristics. These confer a marked ability to suffer when born
into unnatural captive environments, or captured from
the wild – as many older research chimpanzees once were
– and when subsequently subjected to confinement,
social disruption, and involuntary participation in potentially harmful biomedical research.
The justifications proposed for invasive chimpanzee
experimentation rely upon the important contributions
advocates claim it has made toward the advancement of
biomedical knowledge, and, in particular, toward combating major human diseases. However, a recent largescale citation analysis of the medical utility of chimpanzee
experimentation indicated that the benefits conferred are
significantly less than sometimes claimed. Half of the randomly-selected published chimpanzee studies were not
cited by any subsequent papers, apparently generating
data of questionable value, which made little obvious
contribution toward the advancement of biomedical
knowledge. Additionally, closer examination failed to
identify any chimpanzee study that made an essential
contribution, or, in a clear majority of cases, a significant
contribution of any kind, toward papers describing methods efficacious in combating human diseases [51].
Almost all of these chimpanzee experiments would have
been approved by at least one institutional ethics committee ethically obliged to allow only those experiments
likely to result in substantial benefits, given the considerable animal welfare, bioethical and financial costs integral
to chimpanzee experimentation. Whilst the concept of
ethical review is sound, these results demonstrate that its
implementation is presently flawed. This flaw appears to
have resulted from an over-reliance on the assumption
that these chimpanzee experiments were likely to be of
substantial use in advancing biomedical progress. The
approval of large numbers of these experiments, despite
their questionable value, indicates a widespread failure of
the ethics committee system. By approving these experiments on the basis of unfounded assumptions about their
likely benefits, the ethics committees responsible failed in
their duty to society, and to the animals they were charged
with protecting.

Numerous experts have previously called for the banning
of great ape experimentation [6,8,95,109,110]. By 2008,
legislative or policy bans or restrictions were in place
within seven European countries, Japan, Australia and
New Zealand. The revision of Directive 86/609/EEC on the
Protection of Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes may result in the extension of such restrictions to include the remainder of Europe.
In continuing to conduct invasive experiments on chimpanzees and other great apes, by 2008 the US was almost
completely isolated internationally. However, the 2007
NCRR permanent moratorium on chimpanzee breeding
[2,3], and the 2008 congressional introduction of The
Great Ape Protection Act [1], may signal a noteworthy
change in policy, and have provided an unprecedented
opportunity for US legislators, researchers and others, to
work toward a future global ban on invasive chimpanzee
research.
Previous NIH support of invasive chimpanzee research
has been dogged by controversy [5], and chimpanzee
experimentation consumes enormous resources that are
consequently unavailable to other, potentially more beneficial research fields. Ending such research within the US
would uphold the best interests of chimpanzees and other
fields presently deprived of research funding, and would
also increase the compliance of US animal researchers
with internationally-accepted animal welfare and bioethical standards. It could even result in the first global moratorium on invasive research, for any non-human species,
unless conducted in the best interests of the individual or
species.
