Transcription of the T4 late genes
E Peter Geiduschek*, George A Kassavetis*

Abstract
This article reviews the current state of understanding of the regulated transcription of the bacteriophage T4 late
genes, with a focus on the underlying biochemical mechanisms, which turn out to be unique to the T4-related
family of phages or significantly different from other bacterial systems. The activator of T4 late transcription is the
gene 45 protein (gp45), the sliding clamp of the T4 replisome. Gp45 becomes topologically linked to DNA through
the action of its clamp-loader, but it is not site-specifically DNA-bound, as other transcriptional activators are. Gp45
facilitates RNA polymerase recruitment to late promoters by interacting with two phage-encoded polymerase subunits: gp33, the co-activator of T4 late transcription; and gp55, the T4 late promoter recognition protein. The
emphasis of this account is on the sites and mechanisms of actions of these three proteins, and on their roles in
the formation of transcription-ready open T4 late promoter complexes.
Introduction
T4 late genes are transcribed from simple promoters
consisting of an 8-base pair TATA box placed ~1 helical
DNA turn upstream of the transcriptional start site (the
location of the bacterial s 70 -family RNA polymerase
(RNAP) promoter -10 site). A significant AT base pair
preponderance characterizes the segment immediately
downstream of the TATA box that strand-separates
when the late promoter opens for initiation of transcription; there is no sequence conservation at the position
corresponding to the bacterial promoter -35 site.
Fifty of these sites are listed for the T4 genome [1,2].
The consensus first proposed by Christensen and Young
[3] is tightly adhered to overall (Figure 1), perfectly so at
32 sites, with A(-13) in place of T at nine sites and
other single deviations from consensus at the remaining
sites, with two exceptions, (one a TA®AT change). Variant T4 late promoters are used for (basal) transcription
in vitro [4] and a number of variant promoters have also
been associated with RNA 5” ends in vivo [5,6] (Three
cautionary notes: 1) these 50 sites have not all been
identified as promoters that are active in vivo; 2) some
of the RNA 5” ends that have been mapped to putative
promoters were specified by primer extension analysis,
which does not distinguish between 5” ends generated
by bona fide initiation and endonucleolytic processing;
3) the relative rates of initiation at consensus and

California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0634, USA

variant T4 late promoters in vivo have not been determined.) While all early and middle transcripts have the
same polarity, that is, counterclockwise in the standard
representation of the T4 genetic map, and complementary to the DNA l strand [7], late transcripts have either
polarity. At several sites, both T4 DNA strands are
transcribed at different times of the multiplication
cycle [8,9].
Transcription initiating at these simple promoters
requires the function of T4 genes 33 and 55. These two
genes hold a special place in the history of molecular
biology, because they are the first master regulators of a
developmental program of gene expression to have been
discovered [10]. Both genes encode RNAP-binding proteins [11,12]: the gene 55 protein (gp55) is the smallest
and one of the most highly divergent members of the
s 70 family [13-15], while gp33 has no recognizable
homology with s proteins. The phenotypes of cells
infected with 33- and 55- phage are, however, not the
same. In the absence of gene 55 function, late genes are
not transcribed. In contrast, some late transcription
eventually materializes, and late proteins are also made
at reduced levels, in cells infected with gene 33-defective
phage. These differences of phenotype of gene 33 and
gene 55 mutants reflect the different mechanisms of
action of gp33 and gp55 in transcription, as discussed
below. Late transcription normally also requires DNA
replication [10,16] and is, in fact, coupled to concurrent
DNA synthesis [17].

Figure 1 The T4 late promoter sequence logo.

The coupling of late transcription to DNA replication
is enforced by the action of gp30, the T4 DNA ligase
[18]. Single-strand breaks make T4 DNA subject to
nucleolytic attack, but protecting against that degradation by knocking out the exonuclease function encoded
by gene 46 generates a situation in which late transcription occurs in the absence of DNA replication (e.g., in
the absence of T4 DNA polymerase (gp43) function)
[19,20]. Thus, the just-specified gene 30-/43-/46- triple
mutant serves as a platform for finding proteins that are
not only required for T4 DNA replication but have an
additional direct role in late transcription. Those experiments clearly identify the involvement of gp45, the sliding clamp processivity factor of the T4 DNA polymerase
holoenzyme, in T4 late transcription [21]. (That this
approach does not equally clearly identify the involvement of the gp44/62 clamp loader complex in T4 late
transcription is puzzling, as discussed further on.)
In summary, the primary direct roles in T4 late transcription are played by three proteins–gp55, gp33 and
gp45–and by a transient form of the T4 DNA template
that is generated in the process of replication. The focus
of the rest of this account is on explaining the mechanisms of action of these components.
Gp55

Gp55 is a very small, highly diverged s70-family protein
(Figure 2). The s70/sA subunits of the bacterial RNAPs
comprise 4 globular domains (s1, s2, s3 and s4; Figure
3) that are widely separated on the surface of the RNAP
holoenzymes. When s detaches from the RNAP core,
these domains swap their sites of interaction with the b
and b” RNAP subunits for internal contacts and assume
a compact structure [22,23]. The s structural domains
also correspond with segments of sequence conservation
(segments 1.1, 1.2; 2.1-2.4; 2.5 and 3.1; 4.1 and 4.2;[15]).
Discernible similarity of gp55 with s70 is confined to
domain 2 [13-15], which provides the principal RNAP
core-binding and -10 DNA site-recognition functions of
s proteins (involving conserved sequence segments 2.2

and 2.4, respectively) [24-26]. Since a direct determination of gp55 structure is not yet at hand, what follows
pieces together the information that can be derived
from site-directed mutagenesis, analysis of function and
interactions in vitro, and consideration of amino acid
sequence conservation.
Gp55 is the promoter recognition subunit of the T4
late gene-transcribing RNAP holoenzyme [27] and confers the ability to execute basal level accurately initiating
transcription on unmodified and exhaustively s-stripped
E. coli RNAP core. This basal transcription by
gp55•RNAP is sensitive to ionic strength, and greatly
reduced at lower temperature or when relaxed DNA is
used as template in place of supercoiled plasmid DNA
[27-31].
Initial binding of gp55•RNAP to DNA is not highly
specific, in the sense that it does not greatly favor promoters relative to non-promoter sequence. (What this
means operationally is that, for example, DNase I footprints of initially forming closed T4 late promoter
complexes are not discernible above the background of
non-specific DNA binding under conditions that are
satisfactory for analysis of closed s70•RNAP promoter
complexes) [32,33]. In contrast, open T4 late promoter
complexes are site-specific, stable and readily detected
by footprinting [32,34]. The acquisition of additional
sequence discrimination on promoter opening implies
sequence-specific recognition of some feature of the
open promoter (perhaps its separated non-transcribed
DNA strand) by gp55, but this has not been demonstrated directly.
The s segment 2.2-equivalent RNAP core-binding
motif of gp55 has been inferred on the basis of alaninescan mutants analyzed for RNAP core-binding, basal
and activated transcription [35]. This segment of gp55 is
highly conserved (Figure 2). Extension of the alignment
and secondary structure prediction suggests that residues ~42-122 constitute the s2 -equivalent domain of
gp55. Conservation of sequence among gp55 homologues extends outside this segment (Figure 2). In

Figure 2 Amino acid sequence conservation of gp55. All T4-related phage genomes sequenced to date (see [59], which is a review by
Petrov, et al., in this series) contain readily identifiable gp55 homologues [81]. Four segments of sequence conservation can be noted. The
central and largest segment 2 allows the distant relationship to domain 2 of s70 to be discerned, primarily through correspondence with s70
conserved segments 2.1 and 2.2 and secondary structure. The presumption that segment 2.4 harbors the late promoter recognition element of
gp55 is speculative. Conserved segment 4 is the sliding clamp-binding epitope. Conserved segments 1 and 3 share no recognizable sequence
similarity with s70. Whether they correspond functionally with s segment 1.1/1.2 and 3.1, respectively, is not known. The numbering of residues
is continuous for the T4 protein. Amino acid sequences of the T4, RB14 and RB32 proteins are identical; only T4 is listed. RB49 and phi-1 gp55
are also identical except for Q30 (RB49)®E30 (phi-1); only RB49 is listed. A secondary structure prediction from HHpred, with a-helices as
cylinders, is shown below the alignment. Vertical lines at the side cluster phages infecting (top to bottom): E. coli (133 was isolated as an
Acinetobacter phage); Aeromonas species; and Vibrio species. The more divergent S-PM2 protein is the only representative of the completely
sequenced cyanobacterial phages that has been included for this presentation. (The cyanobacterial RNAPs constitute a separate clade in the
phylogeny of the multisubunit enzymes, as do the archaeal RNAPs and the individual eukaryotic nuclear RNAPs I-V.)

particular, absolute conservation of aromatic residues at
N-proximal positions 10 and 23 of segment 1 is notable,
as is conservation of sequence for residues ~141 - 156
(segment 3; numbering refers to the T4 protein) implying essential gp55 functions that might be related to s70
segments 1.1 and 3.1, respectively. Sequence of a short
hydrophobic and acidic C-terminal segment of gp55 is
also conserved. This is the sliding clamp-binding epitope
of T4 gp55 [36,37] and its conservation suggests that
ability of the late gene-transcribing RNAP holoenzyme
to bind the sliding clamp is a widely shared function of
T4-related family phages. A 17-residue segment

connecting the C-terminal epitope of gp55 to the rest of
the protein is highly divergent in sequence and of varying length even among phages infecting E. coli. In the
case of the T4 protein, extensive amino acid substitutions as well as insertions of a flexible (Ser-Gly) linker
and small deletions do not eliminate the ability to support sliding clamp-activated late transcription [33]. This
gp55 segment may be an unstructured linker connecting
the sliding clamp-interacting C-terminus with the RNAP
core-bound rest of the protein, somewhat comparable
with the flexible linker that connects the N- and Cterminal domains of the RNAP a subunits [38].

their C-terminal domains) and ω (cyan) subunits are identified, and the b subunit flap (red), which is the attachment site of s domain 4 and
gp33, as well as the b” coiled-coil (green), which is the docking site of s domain 2 and gp55, are emphasized. s domains 1.2, 2, 3 and 4 (dark
blue) are identified. B. The same, with s removed (i.e., RNAP core, but with the coordinates of the holoenzyme) (Adapted from [26]).

Gp33

The 112-residue gp33 binds to the flap tip of the RNAP
b subunit [39]. This is also the RNAP core attachment
site of s domain 4, which recognizes the -35 promoter
element. Thus, gp33 can be thought of as a s4 mimic,
and gp55 together with gp33 as a split s. On the other
hand, the b flap, which juts out over the RNA exit pore
of the elongating transcription complex, is also the
attachment site of other effectors of transcription, notably the phage lQ protein and other regulators of transcriptional elongation and termination. Moreover, gp33
does not recognize DNA sequence (and no sequence
recognition is required since T4 late promoters do not
have an upstream/-35 element). Instead, gp33 represses
basal transcription [40,41] by diminishing promoter as
well as general non-specific DNA binding. Binding of
RNAP to DNA ends and DNA end-initiating transcription is exempt from this inhibition [42].
Conservation of amino acid sequence among gp33
homologues is primarily confined to individual residues
in the C-terminal two-thirds of these proteins, which
include the RNAP core binding site and the C-terminal
sliding clamp-binding epitope (Figure 4). A recently
completed determination of the structure of a gp33
complex with the E. coli RNAP b flap [43] and modeling
into the Thermus RNAP structures [24,25] accounts for
this conservation in terms of protein-protein contacts in
this complex, suggests additional gp33:RNAP core
interactions [43] and rationalizes extensive mutational
analysis of gp33:RNAP binding and function [33,39].
The N-proximal one-third of gp33 is highly variable,
entirely missing in homologues from other E. coli-infecting T4-related phages. There is no discernible similarity

of amino acid sequence between gp33 and s proteins,
but the new structure allows functional correspondences
between individual gp33 and s70 domain 4 residues to
be seen.
It has been proposed that when it binds to the b flap,
gp33 occludes a non-specific DNA-binding site on
RNAP core, that this RNAP core site also interacts nonspecifically with DNA upstream of the T4 late promoter’s -10 element and, in so doing, contributes to the
promoter affinity of gp55•RNAP without contributing to
selectivity [42]. The exemption of DNA-end-initiating
transcription from inhibition by gp33 is presumed to be
a direct consequence of its mechanism: binding to, and
initiating transcription at, linear DNA template ends
involves threading those ends through the downstream
DNA channel for access to the catalytic center of
RNAP, out of contact with b flap-bound gp33 and the
upstream-facing part of RNAP.
Gp45

Gp45 is the T4 representative of the sliding clamp proteins. Sliding clamps are six-domain rings with a central
hole large enough to accommodate a DNA helix: headto-tail homodimers of 3-domain subunits in the case of
the E. coli replisome’s b protein; homotrimers of 2domain subunits in the case of gp45 and the eukaryotic
PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen); homo- or heterotrimers of 2-domain subunits in the case of archaeal
PCNA (for a review, see [44] and [45], which is an article by Mueser, et al., in this series). a-helices with a net
positive charge line the central cavity and antiparallel b
sheets with a net negative charge form the periphery of
sliding clamps. Pseudo-6-fold symmetry axes run

through the centers of the sliding clamps, except for the
case of gp45, whose C-proximal domain of each protomer is somewhat shorter than the N-proximal domain,
generating a form that is closer to triangular than hexagonal (i.e., with 3-fold symmetry instead of 6-fold
pseudo-symmetry) [46,47].
The lateral faces of the sliding clamp are chemically
distinctive; notably, the lateral face with the protruding
C-terminus presents a hydrophobic patch on each protomer that serves as a binding site for the numerous
and functionally diverse ligands that sliding clamps
tether to DNA. (The sliding clamps are, for that reason,
also aptly referred to as sliding toolbelts.) The ligands of
the T4 sliding clamp include its clamp loader, the gp44/
62 complex, and the highly similar hydrophobic and
acidic C-termini of gp43, gp55 and gp33. For gp43, this
interaction establishes processive DNA chain elongation

(by confining DNA polymerase to the one-dimensional
space of the DNA thread (see [45], by Mueser, et al.,
this series).
Crystal structures of sliding clamps show them all as
closed rings. In contrast, detailed analysis shows that the
gp45 trimer in solution is open at one monomer interface and out of plane, somewhat like a split-ring lock
washer [48]. All sliding clamps require loading factors
that mount them on to DNA at double-strand-singlestrand/primer-template junctions in an ATP hydrolysisrequiring process. The gp44/62 complex is the T4
clamp loader and it also loads gp45 on to DNA at nicks.
Since their lateral faces are not identical, there are two
distinguishable orientations of sliding clamps on DNA.
The DNA strand with the 3"OH end determines the
orientation of the clamp loader and, in turn, of the
loaded sliding clamp. Thus, in the case of clamp loading

Geiduschek and Kassavetis Virology Journal 2010, 7:288
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/288

at a DNA nick, for example, switching the strand that is
interrupted reverses the orientation of the sliding clamp
on DNA and therefore the polarity of its protein interactions. The same face of gp45 that attaches to the
clamp loader also binds gp43 and, as argued below, the
gp55- and gp33-containing T4 late RNAP holoenzyme.
The RB69 sliding clamp (81% identity of amino acid
sequence with the T4 protein) has been co-crystallized
with its ligand, the 11 C-terminal residues of the DNA
polymerase [47]. The structure of the complex shows
attachment of the hydrophobic 11-mer to the already
referred to hydrophobic patch on the gp45 face with the
protruding C-end of the protein (the C face), with only
one of the three available sites occupied in each gp45
trimer. This is also the ligand-interaction mode of other
sliding clamps [44,47,49]. In contrast, the preferred
binding site of the C-terminal epitope of T4 gp43 in
solution is the open gp45 inter-monomer interface [50].
(The gp45 ring being closed in crystals, that site would
not be available for complex formation.) Thus, at least
two different attachment sites on gp45 are apparently
available for its gp43, gp55, gp33 and clamp loader partners. These sites do not offer the same affinity to their
ligands, but they may both play roles in clamp loading,
replication and/or transcription.
Gp45 sliding along DNA can be detected by DNAprotein photochemical cross-linking as occupancy of
interior DNA sites that is dependent on a DNA-loading
site, a clamp loader and ATP [51]. Experiments of that
type show that gp55 tracks along DNA as a gp45 ligand
[52]. This implies an ability of the sliding clamp to confer a mode of promoter searching that is dominated by
processive one-dimensional scanning along the DNA
thread. A snakes-and-ladders game model has dominated thinking about how proteins find their sites on
genomes [53]. Sliding clamp-facilitated promoter searching is more-snakes-less-ladders. Whether facilitating
promoter searching increases transcriptional activity
depends on whether it is rate-limiting. This is unlikely
to be the case for basal (gp33-independent) transcription, for which promoter opening is slow, as described
below, but is not excluded for activated transcription,
which is marked by very rapid promoter opening [32].
T4 sliding clamps must be loaded onto DNA by their
clamp loaders in order to execute their functions in
DNA replication and transcription. It is puzzling, therefore, that gene 44 and 62 amber mutations are clearly
and nearly absolutely replication-defective (D0 phenotype) [10], but that the requirement for gp44/62 complex function in T4 late transcription was not clearly
identified by the analysis that established the essential
role of gp45 [21]. As referred to below, macromolecular
crowding agents, such as poly(ethyleneglycol), allow
gp45 to escape total reliance on the clamp loader for

Page 6 of 12

activating DNA replication by gp43 and T4 late transcription [54,55]. The bacterial cytoplasm is a macromolecularly crowded medium, suggesting that these
observations may have some physiological relevance, but
they do not account for differences of effect of clamploader mutations on replication and late transcription
[21]. The explanation of these differences may instead
reside in the existence of additional interactions of the
T4 clamp loader with the T4 replisome.
Other genes and functions

The T4 genome encodes more than 300 proteins, many
with unknown or barely explored function. Several of
these genes and functions relate to viral transcription and
they have been most recently referred to in the detailed
2003 overview of the T4 genome [2]. As pointed out
there, the functions of most of these proteins probably
relate to early and middle viral transcription (see [56],
which is a review by Hinton in this series) and to shutting
off host transcription under conditions (such as nutrient
limitation and stress) that are very different from those
that were used for the classical analysis of the T4 multiplication cycle in early log phase cells. There is nothing
new regarding them to report in the context of this chapter, with the possible exception of DsbA. dsbA, which
first came to attention as the immediately upstream-lying
and translationally coupled ORF to gene 33 [40], encodes
an ~10 kDa DNA-binding protein, for which specific A/
T rich DNA-binding sites overlapping two late promoters
were identified but with surprisingly low affinity (in the
μM range for K d at moderate ionic strength) [57,58].
Finding dsbA to be a non-essential gene [2] has not
encouraged further analysis in the T4 late transcription
in vitro system, but genome sequencing in the T4-related
phage family (see [59], which is a review by Petrov, et al.,
in this series) brings an interesting feature of dsbA to
light. As already mentioned, the N-terminal 1/3 of gp33
is highly divergent among T4-related phages; even homologues from phage that are all capable of infecting E. coli
lack the N-terminal 20-30 codons of the T4 protein.
Nevertheless, dsbA genes are widely distributed and the
dsbA-gene 33 ORF overlap, indicating translational coupling, is conserved, suggesting a significant role for dsbA,
possibly relating to gene 33 and late transcription, that
remains to be discovered. Our tentative examination of
this issue has not been encouraging: under the standard
conditions of the in vitro transcription system [32,33] no
effect of DsbA on gp33-repressed or gp33/sliding clampactivated transcription was discerned (V. Jain, unpublished observation).
The mechanism of activation

The 8-bp T4 late promoter resembles s70 extended -10
promoters in that DNA sequence recognition is

Geiduschek and Kassavetis Virology Journal 2010, 7:288
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/288

confined to the downstream site at which promoter
opening is initiated and proceeds in the absence of a s4equivalent domain (in the case of the T4 late RNAP)
and without requiring s4 participation (in the case of
s 70 •RNAP). Gp55 dictates specifically initiating transcription at late promoters by unmodified E. coli RNAP
core (RNAP U ) and by the T4-modified core enzyme
(RNAP T4 ), whose a subunits are ADP-ribosylated in
both C-terminal domains (CTD) at Arg265. As already
mentioned, transcription is more active on supercoiled
than on relaxed (nicked circular or linear) DNA, at
higher temperature and at lower ionic strength [27-31],
generally in keeping with the activities of most weak
bacterial promoters. Kinetic analysis of transcriptional
initiation by gp55•RNAP T4 at the consensus gene 23
promoter in linear DNA (limited to a single temperature
and in a single reaction medium) indicates weak promoter binding and relatively slow promoter opening [32].
Promoter opening by s70 family RNAPs is temperature-dependent, to a significant degree adjusted to bacterial lifestyle in the sense that it operates at higher
temperature in thermophiles than in mesophiles [60],
and it is a reversible process [61,62]: when the lPR and
gal P1 promoters (to take one example each of a strong
-35/-10 promoter and an extended -10 promoter) are
opened at 37°C and brought to 0°C they close (although
that process can be relatively slow, implying the existence of a significant kinetic barrier). In contrast, the T4
late promoter opens thermo-irreversibly: while it does
not open at 0°C (even on a multi-hour time scale) it
does not close at 0°C once it has been opened at higher
temperature. The kinetic block has been suggested to lie
on the promoter-closing pathway [63].
Activated transcription requires the participation of
DNA-mounted gp45 and RNAP-bound gp33. The critical
observations leading to the current understanding of activated transcription were made with an in vitro system
that was designed to allow concurrent leading-strand
DNA synthesis and late transcription, using a plasmid
DNA template with a uniquely placed single-strand break
serving as the initiation site for DNA synthesis. It was
relatively promptly found that transcriptional activation
in this in vitro system does not require DNA replication
but does require the participation of three T4 replication
proteins, the gp44/62 complex and gp45, ATP or dATP
hydrolysis (ATP-g-S, the very slowly hydrolyzing ATP
analog blocking activation), and RNAP from T4-infected
cells. Activation is not supported by gp55•RNAPU, and
absolutely requires gp33 [41].
The DNA template’s single-strand break, which is
essential for transcriptional activation, has the properties
of an enhancer in that it can be placed close to, or at
kbp separation from the promoter, but with the special
constraint that the DNA break has to be in the non-

Page 7 of 12

transcribed strand of the activated promoter, so that
switching the nicked strand switches the polarity of
transcriptional activation [30]. The general mode of
action of the enhancer was established by showing that
it acts strictly in cis and that it requires a continuous,
unobstructed path to the promoter [64]. The gp44/62
complex having been established as the non-processive
DNA-loading factor for gp45 at about the same time
[65-68], and DNA nicks being candidate loading sites
for gp45, it was probable at this point [64] that the
required continuous DNA path allows gp45 to slide
from its DNA-loading site to the promoter. That this is
the case was established by showing that gp45 becomes
a stably bound part of the activated promoter complex,
and is located at its upstream end [34], tethered there
by the C-termini of gp55 and gp33 [36], as already
mentioned.
Loading gp45 onto DNA at nicks does not require the
gp32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein. However,
primer-template junctions are more efficient gp45-loading sites in the presence of gp32 than are DNA nicks.
The transcription-activating primer-template junction
also has a polarity constraint: it must be located downstream of its target promoter [69]. The existence of this
constraint establishes that the same lateral face of the
sliding clamp interacts with T4 DNAP and with the late
gene-transcribing gp55•gp33•RNAP holoenzyme. In
contrast, the DNA-nick gp45-loading site can be located
upstream or downstream of its target promoter [64].
This is a reflection of the ability of the gp45 clamp to
slide across a DNA break, whereas it does not slide efficiently across single-stranded DNA [69]. In the presence
of macromolecular crowding agents such as high molecular weight poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG), gp45 can activate transcription and replication in the absence of the
clamp loader [54,55]. Activation under these conditions
also dispenses with the need for a nick or primertemplate loading site as well as ATP hydrolysis, and
functions with relaxed closed circular as well as bluntend linear DNA. The requirement for gp33 and gp55 is
retained. Needless to say, this finding also establishes
gp45 as the activator of late transcription [55].
These facts about the sliding clamp-activated T4 late
promoter complex suffice for the construction of a composite partial molecular model (Figure 5) based on the
structure of the Thermus aquaticus (Taq) RNAP-fork
junction complex [26], the just-recently determined
structure of gp33 in complex with the b subunit flap
domain and ~100-residue dispensable region (DR)II of
E. coli RNAP [43], and gp45 [46]. The DNase I footprint
of the activated and basal open promoter complexes differ by a 13 bp extension at the upstream end, almost

Figure 5 A composite partial molecular model of the sliding clamp docking on an RNAP:promoter complex. The structure of the RB69
sliding clamp [47] has been docked against a Taq RNAP holoenzyme fork junction promoter DNA complex [25]. Evidence from site-specific
DNA-protein photochemical cross-linking and DNA footprinting [34] specifies that the sliding clamp abuts RNAP. Gp33 is placed in the model in
accordance with the recent determination of its structure in complex with the E. coli b flap and DRII (amino acids 831-1057) by K-A.F. Twist and
S.A. Darst [43][K-A.F. Twist, P. Deighan, S. Nechaev, A. Hochschild, E.P. Geiduschek & S.A. Darst, in preparation] and a complete structural model of
E. coli RNAP based on a combination of approaches [82]. Placement of the C-end of gp33 in proximity to DNA is consistent with evidence from
site-specific DNA-protein cross-linking [34]. The rotational orientation of gp45 is arbitrary, but is likely to be constrained by the interacting RNAP
surface and also by the short tether to gp33. The location of the C-end of gp33 on the sliding clamp in the T4 late promoter complex is not
known; a C-terminal 11-mer of phage RB69 DNA polymerase from the structure in [47] has not been removed and is barely visible, but its
relevance to the late promoter complex is unclear, as discussed in the text. Residues 44-123 of gp55, comprising its RNAP core- and DNA-biding
sites, have been modeled based on homology with s70 domain 2 [26] and docked onto the b” subunit coiled-coil. Colors of components are
indicated in the Figure. (Images provided by K.-A. Twist and S.A. Darst and reproduced with their permission.)

RNAP core on DNA, with the a subunit C-terminal
domains pushed out of the way. The only segment of
gp55 that is represented in Figure 5 is region 2.1-2.4
(amino acids 44-123, Figure 2, modeled by homology
with Taq s70 domain 2 [26]) attached to the b” subunit
coiled-coil. The model is consistent with gp33 (presumably in a C-proximal segment) lying within cross-linking
proximity of DNA (~1 nm) at bp -39 and -36/-35 of the
activated T4 late promoter complex [71], although it
does not bind sequence-specifically to it.
The functional consequences of attachment of the
sliding clamp to the upstream end of RNAP in the activated late promoter complex through its interactions
with hydrophobic and acidic motifs at the C-termini of
gp55 and gp33 are a greatly increased overall rate of
promoter opening. Kinetic analysis within a simplified
2-step framework for bacterial promoters [61,62,72]
(Figure 6) indicates that the sliding clamp increases the
effective affinity of the initially forming closed promoter
complex (KB) and the phenomenological first order rate
constant for the subsequent step(s) of promoter opening
(k2) for a combined ~300-fold activation (measured at
30°C, with RNAP T4 ) [32]. Basal transcription is
repressed about one order of magnitude by gp33 (e.g.,
[42]); relative to this lowest activity of the

formation of initiation-ready open promoter complexes.

gp33•gp55•RNAPT4 holoenzyme, the sliding clamp mediates a >1,000-fold activation [32] (Footnote 1, which is
embedded in the text below). The notion that tethering
the promoter complex to DNA would increase its effective affinity is intuitively uncomplicated; that gp45 also
lowers the activation energy barrier for promoter opening by holding on to gp55 and gp33 is less so; what follows suggests that this effect is probably mediated by
gp33. Changes of promoter activity of this magnitude
generate the emergence of qualitatively new properties.
For example, avid association of the gp45-activated
RNAP complex with DNA allows open promoter complexes to form in competition with high concentrations
of the polyanionic competitor heparin [33].
(Footnote 1, A technical note: the above kinetic scheme
adequately describes basal transcription with its characteristically slow promoter opening, and serves to parametrize a simple kinetic analysis of the just-cited work [32].
The principal result of that analysis–that the activator
increases the second order rate constant for forming the
open promoter complex by several hundred-fold relative
to basal transcription and even more relative to gp33repressed transcription, and that this increase results
from a combination of tighter promoter binding and faster promoter opening–is not in question. However, the
kinetic scheme is probably an inadequate representation
of gp45-activated transcription, which is characterized by
very rapid promoter opening and low selectivity, so that
formation of the closed but precisely positioned promoter complex may not come to equilibrium.)
The highly similar C-terminal sliding clamp-binding
motifs of gp55, gp33 and DNA polymerase (gp43) can

Geiduschek and Kassavetis Virology Journal 2010, 7:288
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/288

be freely interchanged; replacing both C-terminal motifs
of gp55 and gp33 with the C-terminal motif of gp43
leaves transcriptional activation in vitro quantitatively
unchanged [33]. While this eliminates the possibility
that their C-ends direct gp55 and gp33 to different
binding sites on gp45, it does not settle the question of
where, on the sliding clamp, these sites are located. The
open interface of the gp45 trimer is the preferred binding site of gp43; while a sliding clamp cannot be simultaneously open at two sites, binding by both the gp55
and gp33 termini to separate clamp subunit interfaces is
conceivable if at least one ligand seals its opening. Alternatively, even identical C-terminal motifs might occupy
non-identical binding sites on gp45 (e.g., one ligand
inserted into a monomer interface and the other
attached to a lateral face hydrophobic patch) under the
steric constraint that is imposed by gp33 and gp55
attachment to RNAP core.
The sliding clamp activator is held by two “arms” that
extend from the gp33•gp55•RNAP. Separately detaching
each of these arms has drastically different consequences
for transcriptional activation: gp33:clamp binding is absolutely essential, while eliminating gp55-binding reduces
but does not eliminate activation [33,36]. Conversely,
gp45 exerts little or no activating effect on basal transcription by gp55•RNAP (Footnote 2, which is embedded
in the text below). “One-armed” partial activation of transcription by gp45 (i.e., in the absence of the gp45:gp55
interaction) is also sensitive to inhibition by heparin [33].
This probably reflects a loss of late promoter binding affinity (KB) due to the lost gp45:gp55 interaction.
(Footnote 2. Another technical note: these effects are
more readily noted with RNAPT4 than with the unmodified E. coli RNAP, most probably because of the effect
of modifying the aCTD after T4 infection: ADPribosylation at Arg265 in the DNA-binding helix of the aCTD
eliminates or at least reduces DNA binding; DNA binding by the aCTD may interfere with gp45 access to
gp33 more effectively in the case of “one-armed activation” (that is, activation by the sliding clamp connected
to the RNAP holoenzyme only through the C-end of
gp33) than in the case of bivalent attachment to the Cends of both gp55 and gp33; ADPribosylation may eliminate or diminish the competition.)
Gp45 is the least stable of the sliding clamps [73,74]
perhaps reflecting the fact that it is partly open in solution, and its DNA-tracking state is accordingly relatively
transient [51,73]. This is proposed to be the mechanistic
basis of the coupling of T4 late transcription to concurrent DNA replication in vivo [75]. The DNA-loading
sites of sliding clamps are transient intermediates of
replication: they are continuously created, predominantly by lagging strand DNA synthesis, and consumed
as DNA discontinuities are sealed by ligation.

Page 9 of 12

Interrupting ongoing DNA replication quickly leads to a
loss of clamp-loading sites, followed soon thereafter by a
loss of DNA-loaded sliding clamps as they fall off DNA.
This can be prevented if DNA ligation is also blocked
and the resulting DNA breaks are stabilized against
degradation–precisely the conditions under which T4
late gene expression becomes independent of DNA
replication in vivo, as already described.
It is a common cellular strategy to make the expression of certain genes contingent on genome replication.
Linking these separate processes involves symbolic communication provided by signaling pathways. Employing
the DNA-loaded sliding clamp as the activator of T4
late transcription instead allows the state of DNA replication to be communicated directly through the availability of sliding clamp-loading sites, and dispenses with
symbolically mediated signaling. One can think of the
strategy as an instance of elegant streamlining or as a
primitive relic.
Phages of the T4 family

Sequenced genomes of T4-related phages (see [59],
which is a review by Petrov, et al., in this series) infecting a wide range of bacterial hosts (E. coli, Acinetobacter, Vibrio, Aeromonas, marine cyanobacteria) permit a
glance at the prevalence of the transcription system of
which T4 is the prototype. Gene 45 and 55 homologues
are members of the core gene set of this family of
phages [76,77]. Strong conservation of amino acid
sequence for extended segments of gp55, including its
putative s domain 2, have been commented on above;
the hydrophobic C-terminal motif is also retained in
gp55 homologues (Figure 2). Thus, it appears probable
that a late transcription system based on gene 55 and
the sliding clamp is a general feature of the multiplication cycles of the T4-related family of phages. Indeed
highly similar consensus sequences have been identified
(in silico) for Vibrio phage KVP40, Aeromonas phage
44RR, and the marine cyanophage S-PM2, and a closely
related consensus (a/gC at positions -13/-12 in place of
TA) has been found for the Aeromonas phage Aeh1
[77-79]. The role of gp33 homologues (Figure 4) is less
obvious. Bivalent tethering of the late RNAP holoenzymes of the T4-related phages to their sliding clamps
should suffice to generate activation by increasing the
effective avidity of promoter binding. The coliphage
gp33 homologues are identifiable as RNAP core- and
sliding clamp-binding proteins and so are the Aeromonas phage homologues, with the exception of phage 65.
Whether the two vibriophages, phage 65, and cyanobacterial phage SPM-2 homologues bind their conjugate
sliding clamps is not made obvious by their sequences
and consequently the mechanism of their participation
in late transcription cannot be guessed by inspection.

Geiduschek and Kassavetis Virology Journal 2010, 7:288
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/288

Speculation about coupling of late transcription to
concurrent DNA replication as a general feature of the
multiplication cycles of these phages is on even shakier
ground. Coupling is proposed to arise as a consequence
of the instability of the DNA-mounted state of T4 gp45.
The T4-related sliding clamps are all 3-domain PCNAlike rather than 2-domain bacterial type proteins, but
whether they generally fall off DNA equally readily
remains to be determined. Another feature of the T4
late transcription system is the high sequence similarity
of the C-termini of gp43, gp55 and gp33 [69]. This is
not a conserved feature of all the phages of this family.
Thus, the sites of attachment of gp55, gp33 and DNA
polymerase homologues to their conjugate sliding
clamps may vary.
If gp55 and gp33 are primarily “merely” deviant s
domains 2 and 4, why are they invariably encoded by
widely separated and separately regulated genes? Why is
there no fused late-transcription s? Some suggestions
for why this hypothetical fusion protein does not exist
in nature or, at any rate, has not been found, can be
offered: 1) Physically separating these two domains
weakens their competitive advantage for binding to
RNAP core, and modulates the competition between
middle and late transcription. If a hypothetical gp55gp33 fusion protein has a great RNAP core-binding
advantage over s 70 and AsiA (the co-activator of T4
middle gene expression), then the dosage and timing of
its production relative to the initiation of DNA replication become critical design elements of the viral multiplication cycle. In the extreme case, sufficiently
premature and abundant production of the fusion protein might prevent DNA replication and shut down
transcription. 2) The “split-s” gp55/gp33 combination is
a device for bivalent tethering of the sliding clamp to
the late promoter, which optimizes late transcription.
One way of approaching these questions is to design
appropriate composite proteins and examine their
modes of action and interaction in vitro. Experiments
along those lines favor the first of these explanations
and tend to discount the second: 1) Fused gp55-gp33
proteins with the gp55 sliding clamp-binding domain
consequently internal instead of C-terminal are functional for sliding clamp-activated T4 late transcription
so long as the length of the connector joining gp55 to
the RNAP b flap-binding domain of gp33 is optimized.
2) The corresponding RNAP holoenzyme with its fused
pseudo-s subunit is almost completely inactive for basal
transcription as a consequence of repression by its
C-terminal gp33 domain. In that sense (essentially
complete activator-dependence), the gp55-gp33 fusion
version of the T4 late RNAP holoenzyme resembles
s54•RNAP. 3) When gp33 is covalently linked to gp55,

Page 10 of 12

suppression of basal transcription still depends on ability
to bind to the b flap. 4) Fusing gp33 to gp55 generates
an effective competitor against s70•RNAP transcription
at a strong -35/-10 type promoter [V. Jain & EPG,
unpublished observations].
Coupling transcription of selected genes to specific
states of the cell-division cycle, including S phase, is a
ubiquitous strategy of cells and it ubiquitously engages
signaling pathways, that is, molecular systems for generating messengers and interpreting messages. The
mechanism that couples transcription of the viral late
genes to replication in the T4 multiplication cycle elegantly dispenses with (or, depending on perspective, is
too primitive for) symbolic communication, instead
directly using universal components of cellular DNA
replication, the primer-template junction and the clamploading factors, as generators of activation and the ubiquitous sliding clamp as the activator. It is puzzling that
this efficient and direct regulatory device should be
restricted to T4 and perhaps other members of the T4related phage family. In fact, it has been possible to
design a sliding clamp-activation domain fusion protein
that generates clamp loader-dependent transcriptional
activation of eukaryotic RNAP II in vitro [80]. Nevertheless, other instances of the use of this direct and simple
mechanism for coupling transcriptional regulation to
DNA replication in nature have not been found.
