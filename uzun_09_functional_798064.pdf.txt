Abstract
Background: Embryonic genome activation (EGA) is a critical event for the preimplantation
embryo, which is manifested by changes in chromatin structure, transcriptional machinery,
expression of embryonic genes, and degradation of maternal transcripts. The objectives of this
study were to determine transcript abundance of HMGN3a and SMARCAL1 in mature bovine
oocytes and early bovine embryos, to perform comparative functional genomics analysis of these
genes across mammals.
Results: New annotations of both HMGN3a and SMARCAL1 were submitted to the Bovine
Genome Annotation Submission Database at BovineGenome.org. Careful analysis of the bovine
SMARCAL1 consensus gene set for this protein (GLEAN_20241) showed that the NCBI protein
contains sequencing errors, and that the actual bovine protein has a high degree of homology to
the human protein. Our results showed that there was a high degree of structural conservation of
HMGN3a and SMARCAL1 in the mammalian species studied. HMGN3a transcripts were present
at similar levels in bovine matured oocytes and 2–4-cell embryos but at higher levels in 8–16-cell
embryos, morulae and blastocysts. On the other hand, transcript levels of SMARCAL1 decreased
throughout preimplantation development.
Conclusion: The high levels of structural conservation of these proteins highlight the importance
of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of gene expression, particularly during early mammalian
embryonic development. The greater similarities of human and bovine HMGN3a and SMARCAL1
proteins may suggest the cow as a valuable model to study chromatin remodeling at the onset of
mammalian development. Understanding the roles of chromatin remodeling proteins during
embryonic development emphasizes the importance of epigenetics and could shed light on the
underlying mechanisms of early mammalian development.

Background
Early embryonic development is initiated when mature
oocytes (MII) are fertilized by spermatozoa. Maternal factors, such as mRNAs, microRNAs and proteins stored in
the oocyte, provide the means of support for the first few
days of development. The transition from a maternal to a
zygotic control of development, called maternal to zygotic
transition (MZT), and the activation of the embryonic
genome involve chromatin structural modifications that
take place during the first few embryonic cell cycles [1].
Embryonic genome activation (EGA) sets the stage for
later development [2,3]. Changes in chromatin structure
have been characterized throughout the transition from
transcriptional incompetence to the minor activation of
the zygotic genome at the 1-cell stage and through the
major genome activation at the 2-cell stage in murine
embryos [4]. In bovine embryos EGA occurs at the 8- to
16-cell stage with extensive programming of gene expression. However, the regulation of chromatin remodeling
during EGA still remains a mystery.
Chromatin remodeling is an extensive process occurring
during early embryogenesis. An essential property of the
embryonic chromatin structure is to prevent the access of
the transcriptional machinery to all of the promoters in
the genome. The expression of some genes may be mediated by chromatin remodeling proteins. Chromatin
remodeling complexes may change the overall pattern of
expression of mammalian genes, allowing transcription
factors and signaling pathways to produce different
genomic transcriptional responses to common signals [5].
This is particularly important for preimplantation
embryos starting cell differentiation cascades that will
lead to tissue and organogenesis. These changes in chromatin structure generate activation of the transcriptional
machinery and gene expression occurring during early
embryo development, leading to a unique chromatin
structure capable of maintaining totipotency during
embryogenesis and differentiation during postimplantation development [3].
The High Mobility Group Nucleosomal (HMGN) protein
family is the only group of nuclear proteins that bind to
the 147-base pair long nucleosome core particle with no
sequence specificity [6]. HMGN proteins are present in
the nuclei of all mammalian and most vertebrate cells at
approximately 10% of the abundance of histones [7].
They bind as homodimers to the nucleosome and cause
chromatin modifications that facilitate and enhance several DNA-dependent activities, such as transcription, replication and DNA repair. This protein family is composed
of 3 members, HMGN1 (also known as HMG-14),
HMGN2 (also known as HMG-17), and the most recently
discovered HMGN3, initially named TRIP7 for its ability
to bind the thyroid hormone receptor [8].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/183

In the mouse HMGN1 and HMGN2 have been detected
throughout oogenesis and preimplantation development
and are progressively down-regulated throughout the
entire embryo, except in cell types undergoing active differentiation [9]. Reduction in the levels of HMGN1 and 2
mRNA also occurs during myogenesis in rat, suggesting
that down-regulation of HMGN mRNA may be associated
with tissue differentiation [10]. Depletion of HMGN1 and
HMGN2 in one- or two-cell embryos delays subsequent
embryonic divisions. Cells derived from HMGN1-/- mice
have an altered transcription profile and are hypersensitive to stress [9]. Experimental manipulations of the intracellular levels of HMGN1 in X. laevis embryos cause
specific developmental defects at the post-blastula stages.
Furthermore, HMGN proteins regulate the expression of
specific genes during X. laevis development [11]. Several
lines of evidence implicate HMGN1 and 2 in transcriptional regulation. Chromatin containing genes that are
actively being transcribed has two- to three times more
HMGN1 and 2 compared with total chromatin [9].
The human HMGN3 transcript produces two splice variants HMGN3a the long isoform with 99 amino acids, and
HMGN3b with 77 amino acids that arises due to a truncation of the fifth exon. Although no HMGN3b protein has
been identified in the rat and cow, ESTs with high identity
to it suggest that this splice variant may also exist in these
species. The cow, mouse, and rat HMGN3a proteins share
more than 81% identity with the human HMGN3a protein [8]. The role of HMGN3a has not been studied in
mammalian development. Our previous data show that
HMGN3a is expressed at similar levels in oocytes and 8cell bovine embryos [3]. We have detected high HMGN3a
mRNA levels in IVF produced bovine blastocysts. Furthermore, HMGN3a was significantly higher in IVF derived
blastocysts compared to blastocysts produced by somatic
cell chromatin transfer (SCCT), which had lower levels of
HMGN3a transcript similar to those detected in somatic
cells (unpublished data). Although the exact function of
HMGN3a during early embryonic development has not
been determined, its role in facilitating chromatin modifications and enhancing transcription, replication, and
DNA repair is critical for early embryo development [8].
Another important mechanism in regulation of chromatin structure in the early embryo is mediated by nucleosome repositioning factors, which are ATP-dependent
chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Nucleosome repositioning factors use energy released by ATP hydrolysis to alter
histone-DNA contacts and reposition nucleosomes to create chromatin environments that are either open or compact. These factors do not involve sequence specific DNA
binding sites, but rather are recruited onto promoter
regions by specific transcription factors. Nucleosome
repositioning factors typically exist as multi subunit pro-

tein complexes, like the SWI/SNF (from SWItching and
Sucrose Non-Fermenting in yeast) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex [12]. SWI/SNF complexes are
thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around them with their helicase and ATPase activities [13,14]. In mammals, each
SWI/SNF complex has any of two distinct ATPases as the
catalytic subunit of SMARCA2 (also known as BRM or
Brahma) and SMARCA4 (also known as BRG1 Brahma
related gene 1) [15]. Both ATPases have important developmental functions. In primates, expression of both subunits remains constant and low throughout
embryogenesis until the blastocyst stage [16]. In mouse
embryos, Smarca4 transcripts remain at stable levels
throughout preimplantation development, while
Smarca2 transcripts remain low until the blastocyst stage,
when its mRNA levels increase [17]. In porcine embryos,
SMARCA2 transcripts are most abundant in germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes and decline progressively during
embryo development to blastocyst stage [18]. Mutant
mice lacking the Smarca4 gene dye at preimplantation
while the Smarca2-null mouse mutant is viable and shows
a mild overgrowth phenotype [19,20].
Another member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins
involved in chromatin remodeling is SMARCA1 (SWI/
SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator
of chromatin, subfamily a member 1), considered a global
transcription activator and also called SNF2L1. Like other
SWI/SNF members, the SMARCA1 protein has a helicase
ATP-binding domain. However, since the rest of its motifs
diverge from other members of the SWI/SNF family, it has
been classified in the ISWI (for Imitation SWItch) subfamily of ATPases, together with SMARCA5. Decreasing
levels of SMARCA5 were found during Rhesus monkey
embryogenesis from GV oocytes until blastocyst stage.
The same study reported low levels of SMARCA1 throughout all stages of embryogenesis except for the 8-cell stage
[16].
Members of the SNF2 subfamily of SWI/SNF proteins are
characterized by its seven motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V and VI)
[21]. SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF related, matrix associated,
actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like
1) is one of the SNF2 members and shows high sequence
similarity to the E. coli RNA polymerase-binding protein
HepA [21]. Recent reports have linked mutations in the
SMARCAL1 gene with Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD), a human autosomal recessive disorder with
the diagnostic features of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia,
renal dysfunction, and T-cell immunodeficiency [22]. The
ability of SMARCAL1, to interact primarily with nucleosomes was demonstrated using protein interaction microarrays. SMARCAL1 transcripts are ubiquitously expressed
in different human and mouse tissues, suggesting a role in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/183

normal cellular functions or housekeeping activities, such
as transcriptional regulation [21]. Although no studies
have reported the expression of SMARCAL1 during early
embryogenesis in mammals, we previously detected a 7fold increase of the SMARCAL1 mRNA in 8-cell embryos
as compared with MII oocytes by using oligonuclotide
microarray gene expression analysis and Real Time PCR
validation [3].
Additionally, studies on the SWI/SNF complex associated
factor SMARCC1 (also called SRG3 and BAF155), a core
subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, have highlighted the
importance of the ATPase subunits and the whole complex during embryogenesis. In the absence of Smarcc1,
mouse embryonic development ceased during periimplantation stages, indicating that Smarcc1, as well as
the chromatin-remodeling process, plays an essential role
in early mouse development [23]. SMARCC1 mRNA was
found in high levels in GV stage Rhesus monkey oocytes
and at very low levels throughout early embryogenesis but
was higher later at the hatched blastocyst stage [16].
The limited availability of fully annotated bovine genes
has been a limitation for bovine genomic studies. Many
bovine proteins are only partially annotated or are based
on computational prediction. The objectives of this study
were to determine transcript abundance of HMGN3a and
SMARCAL1 in mature bovine oocytes and early bovine
embryos, to perform comparative functional genomics
analysis of these genes across mammals, including
humans, annotate and analyze the conserved/non conserved regions of them on the comparative modeled structure.

Results and discussion
HMGN3a and SMARCAL1 transcripts are highly expressed
in bovine oocytes and early embryos
The mRNA isolated from oocytes and early embryos
exhibited typical ribosomal RNA band ratio (28S:18S).
Blastocysts showed a ratio of 28S:18S bands closer to 2.0,
similar to somatic cells. Using real time PCR, we demonstrated the presence of HMGN3a in bovine MII oocytes,
2–4-cell embryos, 8–16-cell embryos, morulae and blastocysts. HMGN3a transcript abundance was significantly
lower in MII oocytes and 2-cell embryos compared to 8cell, morula and blastocyst stage embryos (Figure 1A).
SMARCAL1 transcript abundance was similar in MII
oocytes and 8-cell embryos. However we observed significantly higher levels of SMARCAL1 mRNA in 2-cell
embryos. SMARCAL1 transcripts decrease significantly in
the morula and blastocyst stages (Figure 1B). This result
differs from our previous microarray and Real-Time PCR
gene expression analysis, which showed that SMARCAL1
was expressed at significantly higher levels in 8-cell
embryos compared to bovine oocytes [3]. This difference

other tissues, could suggest involvement of these proteins
in the specialized chromatin remodeling process occurring during embryo development.
Smarcc1 (SRG3) expression during mouse oogenesis and
preimplantation stages was studied using immunofluorescence and western blot assays. Smarcc1 was present in
the nuclei of oocytes during growth and maturation. Following fertilization, Smarcc1 was detected in higher levels
in the male pronucleus compared to the female pronucleus. Expression of Smarcc1 was accompanied by expression of Smarca4 and Ini1, other core subunit of the SWI/
SNF complex. The expression of these chromatin remodeling factors could suggests a role for remodeling factors in
chromatin structure and function during early development [23]. These findings suggest that although the ISWI
proteins are widely expressed and play important roles in
promoting cellular proliferation and differentiation, they
may not play a prominent role during blastocyst formation and may only become key factors during postimplantation life [16].

might be due to the fact that in the current study we have
pooled 8- and 16-cell embryos where expression of
SMARCAL1 transcripts might be decreasing at the 16-cell
stage. The present results confirm the expression of
HMGN3a and SMARCAL1 in the bovine oocyte and early
embryo. Their confirmed role in chromatin remodeling in

Comparative functional genomics analyses of HMGN3a
across mammals
Seven mammalian species were used in the construction
of a HMGN3a phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A). The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) is shown
next to the branches. All positions containing gaps and
missing data were eliminated from the dataset. There were
a total of 95 positions in the final dataset, of which 18
were parsimony informative. The most significant observation in multiple sequence alignment of HMGN3a was
the insertion of alanine, in the fifth exon of the Bos taurus
protein, (highlighted in red on Figure 2B). Several substitutions in the bovine sequence were shared by other
mammals in the alignment.

HMGN3a constitutes a family of relatively low molecular
weight non-histone components of about 100 amino acid
residues. Macaca mulatta and Canis familiaris HMGN3a
proteins have longer sequences with regions not shared
with the other species. We focused on the regions of the
protein shared by all species. Also we showed other
alanine substitutions in the alignment (marked with
stars) (Figure 2B).
Comparative functional genomics analyses of SMARCAL1
across mammals
SMARCAL1 has four conserved domains (Figure 3). The
first and the second are two HARP (HepA-related protein)
domains of approximately 60 residues long, with singlestranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The third conserved domain is a helicase like domain named SNF2 Nterminal domain and the fourth is a helicase C-terminal
domain [21].

SMARCAL1 has 4 distinctive domains. The starting and ending residue numbers are 245–299, 342–396, 437–727, and
741–818.

We used the whole SMARCAL1 protein sequences from 9
mammalian species to construct the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 4). Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed.
The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated
taxa clustered together in the bootstrap analysis (500 replicates) is shown next to the branches. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the
dataset. There were a total of 856 positions in the final
dataset, of which 198 were parsimony informative. We
used each one of the four SMARCAL1 conserved domains
to build separate multiple sequence alignments and construct separate phylogenetic trees for each domain (Figures 5A, Six part A, Seven part A and Nine part A).
Phylogenetic analysis shows that while Homo sapiens, Pan
troglodytes, Macaca mulatta are clustering together, Equus
caballus, Canis familiaris and Bos taurus have relatively distant position in the tree. Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus separated these organisms in the tree. Monodelphis
domestica becomes the most distant species among 9
mammals in the tree.

delphis domestica was the most distantly related mammal
with respect to this domain. Substitutions were observed
in 24 positions. On the 4th substitution, glutamate, a
medium size acidic amino acid was substituted by
alanine, a small size hydrophobic amino acid in Bos Taurus. On the 8th substitution, while Bos Taurus, Equus caballus, and Canis familiaris have a serine, it is substituted for
asparagine in Pan troglodytes, and Homo sapiens, and for
arginine in Macaca mulatta and Rattus norvegicus. Additionally Mus musculus has a histidine, and Monodelphis
domestica has a lysine at this position. On the 10th substitution, while Bos Taurus, Equus caballus, Canis familiaris,
and Monodelphis domestica have an alanine, a small size
hydrophobic amino acid, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens,
and Macaca mulatta have aspartate, a medium size acidic
amino acid. Both Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus have
phenilalanine at this position. For the second HARP
domain, there were 34 positions with amino acid substitutions in at least one of the species studied. These substitutions are highlighted in the alignment (Figure 6B).
Again Monodelphis domestica was the most distant species
for this domain.
In phylogenetic tree analysis of HARP1 domain, significantly higher bootstrap values were observed for Rattus
norvegicus, Mus musculus, Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens.
In the second HARP domain, high bootstrap values conserved only in Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus. For both
domains Monodelphis domestica observed as the most distant
mammalian among 9 species. When we compared first and
second domain of HARP in SMARCAL1 also there was a
separation which can easily be identified between the
group of Canis familiaris, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus
and the group of Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens, and Macaca
mulatta. Equus caballus was observed closer to the second
group in the first HARP domain.
The phylogenetic tree of SNF2N which is the third domain
of SMARCAL1 shows similar composition like the first
two phylogenetic trees (Figure 7). But the most significant
difference is Canis familiaris is getting closer to Bos taurus.
For the last domain of SMARCAL1, one of the clearest
observations is lowering of bootstrap values between Bos
taurus and GLEAN 20241, when it is compared to the

sequence related analysis 11 parsimony informative sites
detected and 46 of the sites are conserved among the species (Figure 8).
The multiple sequence alignment for the SNF2 family Nterminal domain is shown in Figure 8, with Monodelphis
domestica as the most distant organism among the other
mammals. Positions with insertions and deletions are
marked with stars. The first insertion comprises 3 additional amino acids (glutamate, leucine, and lysine)
present only in the Equus caballus, protein. There is a deletion of the amino acid arginine, present in all species,
except for the NCBI bovine sequence. However the
GLEAN_20241 does not have the deletion. The amino
acid threonine is also absent in both Rattus norvegicus and
Mus musculus. The bovine NCBI sequence showed significant mutations of the third conserved domain marked in

red on the alignment. However the sequenced official
gene set for this protein (Bovine Genome Database http:/
/racerx00.tamu.edu/bovine) shows a higher homology to
all species, differing in only 2 amino acids from the horse
and human protein. These findings indicate sequencing
errors in the currently available bovine SMARCAL1 protein. These errors will likely be corrected with the completion of the bovine genome annotation effort. The bovine
helicase C-terminal domain protein shows a deletion
(marked with a star) and several substitutions highlighted
in red (Figure 9B) that do not exist in GLEAN_20241.
These observations point to the need for an update in
SMARCAL1 protein sequence currently available at NCBI.
In addition to our analysis, we applied disparity index, ID

Annotation of HMGN3a and SMARCAL1
The official gene model for HMGN3a (GLEAN_08006)
was exactly identical to the NCBI protein
(NP_001029676.1) with 6 exons and a total of 100 amino
acids. No changes were annotated for this protein.

The official gene model for SMARCAL1 (GLEAN_20241)
with 937 amino acids differed from the bovine NCBI protein (NP_788839.1) with 941 amino acids, particularly in
2 of the 16 exons. The official gene model for SMARCAL1
showed a higher level of sequence similarity to the human

SMARCAL1 protein (NP_054859.2) compared to the
available bovine SMARCAL1 protein at NCBI. These
results are presented in Table 1. The differences between
GLEAN_20241 and NP_788839.1 were caused by an
incorrect translation start and several sequencing errors
that included 3 amino acid substitutions in exon three,
one amino acid substitution in exon five, a sequencing
error of 18 amino acids in exon ten, and a sequencing
error of 13 amino acids in exon thirteen.
Annotation of SMARCAL1 mRNA showed that the first
HARP conserved domain in SMARCAL1 is composed of
the last part of the first exon, the second exon and the first
part of the third exon. The second HARP conserved
domain is composed of the end of the third exon, the
fourth exon and the first part of the fifth exon. The third
conserved domain, a helicase like domain named SNF2
family N-terminal domain is composed of the end of the
fifth exon and exons 6–12. The fourth conserved domain,
the Helicase C-terminal domain is composed of the last
part of the twelfth exon and exons 13 and 14. The NCBI
protein sequence for the Helicase C-terminal domain may
also contain several sequencing errors.
Analysis of the conserved/non-conserved regions on the
comparative modeled structure of SMARCAL1
Since the protein structures for SMARCAL1 are available
for helicase like and helicase domain, a comparative
homology model was built on covering only these
domains. The percentage similarity between template and
protein sequence was 24%. Depending on the multiple

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/183

sequence alignments, all non-conserved residues were
mapped on the modeled structure (Figure 12). SNF2N
and helicase C domains have nucleotide binding and ATP
binding residues. There are 9 residues responsible for
nucleotide binding and 8 residues for ATP binding which
were retrieved from the literature [25,26]. These locations
were mapped on the modeled structure. In our analysis we
showed that all ATP binding residues exist in the conserved regions. Although Threonine781 is among the residues that are responsible in nucleotide binding, falls into
the non-conserved region in protein sequence. Multiple
alignment results show that in this specific location only
one species (in Mus musculus) has variation which is Proline (Figure 12). This substitution creates a difference in
amino acid side chain polarity as well as hydrophobicity
and size at that specific position.

Conclusion
In our analysis, the bovine HMGN3a and SMARCAL1
showed a higher degree of homology in all studied mammals. This high structural conservation highlights the
importance of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of
gene expression, particularly during early embryonic
development. Understanding the interactions between
these proteins and their roles could improve our understanding of epigenetics in reproduction and disease.
Appropriate models for the study of chromatin remodeling proteins are essential to understanding this process,
particularly in the case of diseases like Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD), caused by a mutation in the
SMARCAL1 gene. The greater similarities of the HMGN3a
and SMARCAL1 proteins in human and bovine could suggest that more attention should be paid to a bovine model
in the study of chromatin remodeling.

Methods
Production of bovine matured oocytes and early embryos

Chemicals and culture media
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise stated. The
synthetic oviduct fluid (SOF, Specialty Media) was used as
a base media for embryo culture.
In vitro maturation (IVM)
Oocytes were collected from 2–8 mm follicles of bovine
ovaries obtained from a local slaughterhouse in Wisconsin. Only oocytes containing several layers of cumulus
cells and homogenous cytoplasm were selected. Oocytes
were washed three times in TL-HEPES and matured in Tissue Culture Medium (TCM) 199 (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.2 mM pyruvate, 0.5 μg/ml folliclestimulating hormone (FSH; Sioux Biochemicals, Sioux

gen), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin
(Gibco/Invitrogen). Ten oocytes in each 50 μl maturation
drop were covered with mineral oil and incubated for 24
h at 39°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 [27].
After 24 hours, mature oocytes were washed twice with
TL-HEPES. Mature oocytes were randomly selected for
either RNA isolation or fertilization. Pools of 100 oocytes
were frozen at -80°C on RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen Valencia,
CA) until RNA isolation.
In vitro fertilization (IVF)
Groups of 10 oocytes washed with TL-HEPES were transferred into 44 μl drops of fertilization medium (glucosefree TALP supplemented with 0.2 mM pyruvate, 6 mg/ml
fatty acid-free BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin). Percoll gradient was used for separation of
live spermatozoa in frozen-thawed semen [28]. Briefly,
sperm was thawed at 36°C for 1 min, and then carefully
layered on top of the Percoll gradient system. Sperm was
diluted in TL-HEPES to 5.0 × 107 cells/ml and 2 μl of
diluted sperm were added to the 44 μl fertilization drops,
which produced a final sperm concentration of 2.0 × 106
cell/ml. Fertilization drops (50 μl) were supplemented
with 2 μl of 5 μg/ml heparin and 2 μl of PHE solution (20
μM penicillamine, 10 μM hypotaurine, 1 μM epinephrine) and 2 μl of semen (50 × 106 sperm cells/ml) into
the 44 μl fertilization drops [29].
In Vitro Culture (IVC)
Following 18 hours co-culture of oocytes and sperm,
cumulus cells were removed by vortexing the presumptive
zygotes in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube at high speed for 3
minutes. The cumulus free presumptive zygotes were
washed three times in TL-HEPES and approximately 30
cumulus free presumptive zygotes transferred into a 50 μl
drops (SOF) under mineral oil for embryo culture. At 72
hpi, 10% FCS was supplemented to each drop except that
the 2–4-cell stage embryos were collected earlier than
serum addition. In this study, the amount of embryos
cleaved was 76.0% while the amount developing to the
blastocyst stages was 21.8%.
Collection of embryos
Developing embryos of 2–4-cell, 8–16-cell, morulae and
blastocysts stages were collected at 44, 100, 120, and 168

hpi, respectively. At the beginning of the embryo culture,
the drops were randomly assigned to each developmental
stages to collect embryos at the corresponding time.
Therefore, the embryos were collected from each drop
only for one developmental stage mentioned above. Once
the embryos were removed for a specific cell stage, the
drops were crossed out to prevent duplicate collection
from the same drop. Embryos developing to the corresponding stage were removed from culture drops and
washed four times with TL-Hepes with PVP (3 mg/ml).
The number of embryos pooled for the development
stages of 2–4-cell, 8–16-cell, morulae and blastocysts
stages were 50, 50, 20 and 5 per tube, respectively. Total
of four tubes were collected from 2 replicates for each
development stages. The pooled embryos were frozen at 80°C on RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen Valencia, CA) until RNA
isolation.
Isolation of RNA
Total RNA was isolated from pools of 100 oocytes, 100 2to 4-cell embryos, 100 8- to 16-cell embryos and 10
expanded blastocysts (evaluated and graded according the
International Embryo Transfer Society (IETS) guidelines
[30]. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Micro Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Quality of total RNA was estimated using the Bioanalyzer
2100 RNA 6000 picochip kit (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA,
USA). RNA quantity and purity were determined using a
NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Total RNA from all
groups was normalized to 4 ng and used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III Platinum Two Step qRT-PCR kit
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cycling temperatures and times were 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 50 min,
and 85°C for 5 min.
Real time reverse transcriptase PCR to determine
transcript abundance of HMGN3a and SMARCAL1
Complementary DNA was generated using the SuperScript III Platinum® Two-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen

random hexamers for cDNA generation. Primers were
designed using Primer Premier 5 software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA) spanning 2 exons

melting curve was performed starting at 55°C with 0.5°C
increase for 10 sec in 80 cycles. Expression values were calculated using the relative standard curve method. Standard curves were generated using 10-fold serial dilutions
for GAPDH and the target gene by measuring the cycle
number at which exponential amplification occurred.
Results from different groups were analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) by SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute
inc. Carey, NC). Relative expression software tool (REST)
was used to compare all samples of each group. The mathematical model used by REST is based on the PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation between samples
[31].

to avoid genomic DNA amplification (Table 2). Real-time
quantitative PCR was performed to assess transcript abundance of HMGN3a and SMARCAL1 relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Quantitative assessment of RNA
amplification was detected by SYBR® GreenER™ qPCR
SuperMixes for iCycler (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, 11761-100). Five μl cDNA were used for
quantitative Real-time PCR reactions according to the iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR instrument (BIO-RAD). Primer
concentration was adjusted to 10 μM. The cycling parameters were 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 8 min 30 sec for denaturation, 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, and 30 sec at 60°C

Comparative functional genomics analyses of HMGN3a
and SMARCAL1 across mammals
We retrieved the protein sequences of SMARCAL1 from
NCBI by performing protein BLAST [32] against mammalian database using Bos taurus SMARCAL1(NP_788839) as
our query protein. Sequence data were manipulated with
the Friend software [33], a bioinformatics application
designed for simultaneous analysis and visualization of
multiple structures and sequences of proteins, DNA or
RNA. Multiple sequence alignment of 9 mammalian
SMARCAL1 protein sequences that are listed in Table 3
were created by using Clustal W [34] under Friend Software. We defined conserved regions based on domains
listed in the Pfam [35] database which has conserved
amino acid sequence regions. The same steps were applied
for constructing HMGN3a phylogenetic tree, for which we
used the only available Reference Sequence protein for Bos
Taurus (NP_001029676). Since the availability of mammalian HMGN3a sequences is limited, we excluded Monodelphis domestica from the HMGN3a phylogenetic
analyses, which were conducted in MEGA 4 [24]. There
are 7 mammalian species used in our analysis of
HMGN3a which are shown in Table 4. The Maximum Parsimony method was used for inferring the evolutionary
history when creating the phylogenetic trees for both
SMARCAL1 and HMGN3a.
Comparative modeling of SMARCAL1
Since the availability of possible templates for comparative modeling, model was created for only SMARCAL1.

PDB-file 1z63 chain A was used as a template for comparative modeling which was sharing 24% with SMARCAL1
protein sequence of Bos taurus. The template that was
including the residues from 422 to 869 covered two
domains of SMARCAL1 and these were helicase like and
helicase domains. Comparative modeling was performed
by Modeller 9v1 [36]. Structural analysis was done under
Friend and model picture was created with Chimera [37].
Annotation of HMGN3a and SMARCAL1
Annotations were performed using the Apollo software,
an interactive tool that enables gene annotators to inspect
computationally obtained gene predictions, and edit
them by evaluating all the data supporting each annotation [38]. Apollo was successfully used to annotate the
Drosophila melanogaster genome [39], and was the tool recommended by the Bovine Genome Sequencing Consortium for manual annotation of bovine genes. Apollo
software was used to confirm the protein sequence accuracy by transcribing, and translating the DNA, identifying
untranslated regions (UTR), translation start, exons,
introns, and translation stops. Previous protein information from NCBI or Ensembl, was compared to the GLEAN
sequence and errors in the proteins were analyzed in
detail. The GLEAN identification number for HMGN3a
was GLEAN_08006, and for SMARCAL1 was
GLEAN_20241. Annotation of SMARCAL1 and HMGN3a
were submitted to the Bovine Genome Annotation Submission Database at BovineGenome.org.
