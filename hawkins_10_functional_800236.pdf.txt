Abstract
Background: A new paradigm of biological investigation takes advantage of technologies that produce large high
throughput datasets, including genome sequences, interactions of proteins, and gene expression. The ability of
biologists to analyze and interpret such data relies on functional annotation of the included proteins, but even in
highly characterized organisms many proteins can lack the functional evidence necessary to infer their biological
relevance.
Results: Here we have applied high confidence function predictions from our automated prediction system, PFP, to
three genome sequences, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). The number
of annotated genes is increased by PFP to over 90% for all of the genomes. Using the large coverage of the function
annotation, we introduced the functional similarity networks which represent the functional space of the proteomes.
Four different functional similarity networks are constructed for each proteome, one each by considering similarity in a
single Gene Ontology (GO) category, i.e. Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function, and another
one by considering overall similarity with the funSim score. The functional similarity networks are shown to have higher
modularity than the protein-protein interaction network. Moreover, the funSim score network is distinct from the single
GO-score networks by showing a higher clustering degree exponent value and thus has a higher tendency to be
hierarchical. In addition, examining function assignments to the protein-protein interaction network and local regions
of genomes has identified numerous cases where subnetworks or local regions have functionally coherent proteins.
These results will help interpreting interactions of proteins and gene orders in a genome. Several examples of both
analyses are highlighted.
Conclusion: The analyses demonstrate that applying high confidence predictions from PFP can have a significant
impact on a researchers' ability to interpret the immense biological data that are being generated today. The newly
introduced functional similarity networks of the three organisms show different network properties as compared with
the protein-protein interaction networks.
Background
The recent paradigm shift in molecular and systems biology to characterization of large sets of genes and proteins
has been enabled by continual technological innovations,
including fast sequencing technologies [1-3], arrays for
measuring gene expression patterns [4], and high
throughput screens that identify various types of molecu* Correspondence: dkihara@purdue.edu

lar interactions [5-7]. Data sets produced by these new
technologies have also spurred development of computational tools to assist in their analysis [8-10]. Of particular
importance is function assignment to genes in a genome
or any system of interest, as functional information is
indispensable for both biological interpretation of the
behavior of the system and generation of hypotheses for
designing subsequent experiments [11]. To this end,
many function prediction methods have been developed
recently to meet the urgent needs [12]. They include
those which employ information from sequence database
search [13-17] more thoroughly than conventional

homology searches [18,19], those which use protein tertiary structure information [20-23], methods that consider conservation of gene locations in genome sequences
[24,25], and methods which utilize protein-protein interaction (PPI) data [26-28]. Please refer to recent reviews
for thorough discussion of recent function prediction
methods [9,29].
We previously introduced PFP as a method for predicting Gene Ontology (GO) functional terms [30] for individual protein sequences with empirically derived
confidence scores [14,31]. PFP has been shown to outperform other sequence-based methods [32-34] and has
been enormously successful in international assessments
of methods for function prediction (AFP-SIG '05 [35] and
Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure
Prediction CASP7, the function prediction [FN] category
[36]). In the previous studies, we have demonstrated that
PFP is superior to the other methods not only in terms of
the accuracy of function assignment but also in its larger
coverage for genome-scale annotation [14].
Here, we examine the utility of applying PFP predictions to genomes of three organisms, Escherichia coli,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). The malaria genome is used
as an example of a poorly annotated organism for which
new annotation provides extensive interesting and useful
functional knowledge. Taking advantage of PFP's larger
function annotation coverage, more than 90% of proteins
encoded in each genome are annotated. In order to investigate the structure of the functional space occupied by
each proteome, we represented the mutual functional
similarity of proteins in a form of network named the
functional similarity network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind introduced to investigate
the structure of protein function space. Weston et al. proposed to consider the pairwise sequence similarity of
many proteins in a database, which is named the protein
similarity network, to improve the database search accuracy [37]. However, the focus of their work is to improve
the database search accuracy but not the investigation of
the network property of the protein similarity. Four different functional similarity networks are generated by
using the function annotation in the three GO categories,
namely, Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component
(CC), Molecular Function (MF), and also by using the
funSim score, which evaluates the overall functional similarity among the three GO categories. funSim uses the
hierarchical structure of GO and information content of
common ancestors of predicted and actual terms [14,38].
Analyses of the network properties of the functional similarity networks in comparison with the PPI networks
(Fig. 1) revealed interesting characteristics: First, most of
the functional similarity networks as well as the PPI networks are scale-free, following the power-law distribu-

tion. However, the functional similarity networks are
distinct from the PPI networks by their modularity as
indicated by the average clustering coefficient. Moreover,
the funSim network distinguishes itself from the single
GO-score networks by showing a higher clustering
degree exponent value and thus exhibiting a higher tendency to be hierarchical, although the clustering degree
exponent value seems to be sensitive to the similarity
threshold value used to construct the funSim score network. Interestingly, the hierarchy of the biological network was first observed in metabolic pathway networks
[39]. This might imply that the funSim score of the three
organisms studied somewhat captures the structure of
relationships between proteins in pathways. Additionally,
we analyze functional similarity of proteins in sub networks in PPI networks and local regions of the genomes.
We present several interesting and potentially useful individual cases from each of the analysis, and provide extensive supplementary data for all of the methods discussed.

Results
Enrichment of function annotation by PFP

We have previously shown that PFP can make more accurate function prediction than existing methods and also it
can significantly increase the coverage of the function
assignment to a genome [13,14]. The summary of function assignments to the three genomes used in this study,
Escherichia coli K-12, S. cerevisiae, and P. falciparum, is
shown in Table 1. PFP provides high confidence function
prediction (i.e. prediction with the confidence score ≥
0.8) to a significant number of genes with unknown function even to the two very well annotated genomes, E. coli
and yeast. As for the malaria genome, which is less well
annotated, the number of genes with annotation is doubled by PFP's function prediction. Consequently, more
than 90% of genes in all the three genomes have function
information.
Figure 2 shows functional enrichment by PFP in the
context of PPI networks of the three organisms. On a
broad scale, the increase in functional knowledge for a
PPI network can be described by the enrichment of annotated individual interactions. These interactions can be
either (1) fully enriched, where both of the proteins
involved are annotated with some functional term, (2)
partially enriched, where only one of the two proteins is
annotated, or (3) not have any functional terms annotated
to either of the interacting partners. The increase of fully
enriched interactions in yeast is nominal; around 1% for
all the GO categories, since interactions in this organism
have been already well annotated (around 80% for all the
GO categories have been annotated) (Fig. 2, middle). For
the cases of E. coli, about 10% increase of fully enriched
interactions is observed in each GO category (Fig. 2, left
panel). For the malaria genome, we see a significant

increase in the number of fully enriched interactions in
the three GO categories (Fig. 2, right panel): In the BP
category, the fully enriched interactions increased from
10.8% to 69.2% (58.4 percentage point increase), while
50.7 percentage point increase is observed in the MF category. The increase is largest in the CC category (68 percentage point, from 17.6% to 85.6%). The magnitude of
the increase in malaria interactions compared to E. coli or
yeast interactions is attributed to the fact that only ~40%
of the proteins encoded in the malaria genome were previously characterized, whereas upwards of 75-80% were
such in both E. coli and yeast (Table 1).
Functional similarity network by PFP

The previous section shows that PFP significantly
enriches the function annotation in the three genomes,
which facilitates analysis of the whole landscape of the
functional space occupied by the genomes. In this work,
we represent the functional similarity of genes in a
genome as a network which is named the functional similarity network (Fig. 3). In the functional similarity network, nodes represent proteins with function assignment
and edges between proteins denote functional similarity

between them. For each genome, four networks are constructed by considering the similarity scores in the three
individual GO categories, i.e., BP-score, CC-score, and
MF-score separately (Eqn. 11), and the funSim score (Eqn.
12). Figure 3 visualizes functional similarity networks in
which protein pairs with a similarity score of 0.95 or
higher are connected by edges. We also analyze networks
with two different threshold values of the similarity score,
0.8 and 0.99. These networks intuitively represent overall
functional space of proteins in a genome. The structure of
the functional similarity networks changes as different
threshold values are used. Obviously, the number of
edges in a functional similarity network increases and the
network becomes denser as a smaller threshold value is
used for connecting edges. Table 2 shows the number of
edges for the functional similarity networks using three
threshold values, 0.80, 0.95, and 0.99. Here we first discuss the functional similarity networks using the threshold value of 0.95 (Fig. 3) and later analyze how the
network properties change by using different threshold
values. In Table 3, the parameters of the functional similarity networks for a threshold of 0.95 are underlined.

and 0.99 (bottom) are shown. Only edges with the threshold value or higher are considered.
c) The average clustering coefficient C(k) relative to the degree k is fit to the clustering-degree function, C(k) ~k-β. For the PPI, the data with k
≥ 10, while data with k ≥ 100, k ≥ 30, and k ≥ 10 are used for the functional similarity networks with the similarity score threshold value of 0.80,
0.95, and 0.99.

The functional similarity network using the 0.95 for the
similarity threshold value

In all of the functional similarity networks (Fig. 3), a
majority of the proteins are included in the largest connected component, which holds 74.0% (the CC-score network of E. coli) to 97.5% (The BP-score network of yeast)
of the proteins. The degree distribution of the networks,
i.e. the fraction of proteins, P(k), with a given number of
connections, k, (Fig. 4) shows that most of them, except
for a couple of networks, follow the power-law, P(k) ~ k-γ
[40]. The degree exponent γ ranges from 0.21 (the network for MF-score in P.falciparum) to 1.37 (the funSim
score network in E. coli), which indicates that there are a
small number of "hub" proteins with functional similarity

to many other proteins (Table 3, top rows). The degree
exponent values (γ) of the functional similarity networks
of the BP-, CC-, and MF-score are smaller than those of
the PPI networks shown in Figure 1, which means that
the GO-score networks have larger clusters (i.e. hub proteins with a larger degree) and less proteins with a small
degree than the PPI networks. Moreover, small R2 value
of the CC-score networks (shown in the legend of Fig. 4)
indicates that they do not fit well to the power-law. This is
visually evident, for example, in the CC-score network of
E. coli and the MF-score network of malaria (Fig. 3). The
funSim networks have smaller dominant hub proteins
than the BP-, CC-, and MF-score networks as shown by
their larger γ values (Table 2). This is natural as a hub

Nodes represent individual proteins and edges represent a category GOscore or funSim of ≥ 0.95. Individual clusters in the functional similarity networks are highlighted in color to show functional category of proteins. For the BP-score networks (left panels), green nodes represent proteins involved
in transcription (GO:0006350 and its children nodes), blue nodes represent proteins involved in transport (GO:0006810), purple nodes represent proteins involved in pathogenesis (GO:0009405) (for P. falciparum, Fig. 3C) or signaling (GO:0007165) (for E. coli and yeast, Fig 3A,B), and red nodes represent proteins involved in protein modification (GO:0043687). For the CC-score networks (the second panels from the left in Fig. 3), yellow nodes
represent proteins localized in the membrane (GO:0016020), orange nodes represent proteins localized in the ribosome (GO:0005840), and blue
nodes represent proteins localized in the cell wall (GO:0005618) (for E. coli) or in the nucleus (GO:0005634) (for malaria and yeast). For the MF-score
networks (the second panels from the right), light green nodes represent proteins which bind ATP (GO:0005524), pink nodes represent proteins which
bind rRNA (GO:0019843), light purple nodes represent proteins which bind ions (GO:0043167), and olive nodes represent proteins exhibiting transporter activity (GO:0005215). For the FunSim networks (the panels on the right), burgundy nodes represent proteins which bind ATP (GO:0005524),
blue nodes represent proteins localized in the ribosome (GO:0005840), and light green nodes represent proteins exhibiting transmembrane receptor
activity (GO:0004888).

protein in the funSim network needs to have similarity in
all of the BP-, CC-, and MF-score with neighboring proteins and thus tends to have fewer edges.
The middle rows in Table 3 show the clustering coefficients for the networks computed as per the description
in methods section. We found that the PPI and the functional similarity networks are clearly distinguished by the
clustering coefficient with the latter having larger modularity (i.e. larger values in the clustering coefficient). Single GO-score networks have larger modularity as
compared with the funSim networks. The malaria CC-

score network has the largest clustering coefficient value
(0.86), which is also evident from how it looks (Fig. 3C,
the second network from the left). The funSim networks
have slightly lower modularity than the single GO-score
networks for the same reason that they have fewer hub
proteins, i.e. the edges need to satisfy the more severer
condition of functional similarity.
We further investigated the fit of the networks to the
hierarchical model proposed by Ravasz et al. [39]. The
hierarchy in their model is quantitatively characterized by
comparison of the clustering coefficient of a node with k

links to the scaling law, C(k) ~ k-1. The last rows in Table 3
show the clustering degree exponent (β; C(k) ~ k-β) of
each network. Consistent with previous studies [41-43],
the PPI networks of E. coli and yeast show hierarchy, indicated by a β value close to 1.0 (Fig. 5A). It is rather interesting to notice that the PPI network of malaria does not
show the hierarchy. The apparent dissimilar behavior of
the malaria PPI network might be due to the smaller cov-

erage of the proteins in its PPI network. Compared to the
E. coli and yeast PPI networks which include more than
55% of total known proteins, the malaria PPI network
covers only 23.1% of its proteins. The individual GO-score
networks show less dependency of the C(k) value to the
degree k and thus do not exhibit hierarchy as shown by
their small clustering degree exponent values. However,
the clustering coefficient of the funSim network is well

approximated by C(k) ~ k-1 (Fig. 5B). It is an interesting
observation that hierarchy of the network arises for the
funSim score that integrates single GO-scores, which do
not show hierarchy individually. It might imply that the
funSim score somewhat captures properties of the metabolic networks. Although both the PPI and the funSim
network show hierarchy, they are different in the range of
the clustering coefficient values (i.e. the y-value in Fig. 5),
with the latter having larger values.
Effect of changing the similarity threshold value for
connecting edges

In addition to the networks with the similarity threshold
value of 0.95 which are discussed above, we examine the
networks using a smaller threshold value, 0.80, and a
higher threshold value, 0.99 to understand how the network structure changes. The total number of edges significantly increases by using a more permissive threshold
value (0.80) for connecting edges and decreases with a
larger threshold value (0.99) (Table 2). As the networks
become denser with more edges (using the threshold
value of 0.80), the number of highly connected nodes
increases, which reflects to the decrease in the degree
component (γ). This trend is evident especially for the
CC-score networks, for which the degree component values are too small for them to be power-law networks. The
funSim networks of the three organisms constantly have
high degree exponent values. The average clustering coefficient values (middle rows in Table 3) are relatively less
affected by the change of the similarity threshold values
for drawing edges. Thus all networks with all three similarity threshold values examined are modular.
Looking at the clustering degree exponent values, β,
(the last rows in Table 3), none of the single-GO score
networks exhibits significant hierarchy (i.e. the β value of
around 1.0) by changing the similarity threshold value.
The funSim networks of malaria consistently show hierarchy for all the similarity threshold values. The β value
for the E. coli funSim networks drops to around 0.5 by
changing the similarity threshold value from 0.95 to a
smaller (0.80) and also to a larger (0.99) value. In the case
of yeast funSim network, lowering the similarity threshold value still keeps a high β value but raising the threshold value to 0.99 drops it to 0.67. Thus, referring to the
originally proposed scaling law for the hierarchical network [39], which has the β value of 1.0, E. coli funSim networks with the similarity threshold value of 0.80 and 0.90
as well as the yeast funSim network with the similarity
threshold value of 0.99 may not be fully qualified as hierarchical. However, as Figure 6 and Table 3 show, the funSim networks have a higher β value, and thus tend to be
more hierarchical than the single GO-score networks.
To summarize, both PPI and most of the newly
described functional similarity networks are scale-free.

similarity networks relative to the number of edges in the networks. A, E. coli; B, S. cerevisiae; C, P. falciparum.

The PPI network and functional similarity networks
(namely, funSim, BP-score, CC-score, and MF-score networks) are distinguished by their modularity, with the latter networks showing significant modularity with high
clustering coefficient values while the PPI does not.
Lastly, the funSim network is different from the single
GO-score networks by exhibiting a higher tendency to be
hierarchical (i.e. showing a higher β value). However, note
that the β value of funSim networks seem to be sensitive
to the similarity threshold value and E. coli and yeast fun-

Sim networks drop their β value to less than 1.0 when the
similarity threshold value is changed to 0.80 and 0.99.
Annotating PPI subnetworks

Next, we examine subnetworks in the PPI networks to see
how many edges in them are present in the functional
similarity networks. Here, the functional similarity networks with the similarity threshold value of 0.95 are used.
We compare the number of edges in subnetworks connecting nodes with common annotations assigned in the
GOA database and edges with nodes with common predictions by PFP (Table 4). Edges with common annotations for both nodes did not increase much in E. coli and
yeast by PFP's prediction. Particularly, there is no
increase in the number of edges with common annotations in yeast. This is because yeast PPI networks have
been already well annotated as shown in Figure 2. In contrast, 131 out of 155 subnetworks of malaria are enriched
by the PFP prediction. The number of edges with common annotations increased four times (from 241 to 972
edges) in malaria.
Since malaria has the largest annotation enrichment
among the three organisms (Fig. 2, right panel and Table
4), below we focus on annotations given to the malaria
PPI network. Following a previous work [44], we examine
annotation given to subnetworks of the PPI. A subnetwork is identified as all proteins connected to a common
centroid protein and the edges among them. The statistical significance of the number of edges in a subnetwork is
tested by computing the connectivity coefficient (Eqn. 5)
compared with 100 randomized networks. Those subnetworks with a p-value of below 0.05 by the t-test (Eqn. 6)
are identified as targets for discussion. We identified 155
subnetworks which hold 716 (97.3%) of the proteins in
the entire PPI network.
Each target subnetwork is tested for overrepresentation
of GO terms using only previously known annotations
and then using known and predicted terms by PFP. The

false discovery rate (FDR) correction of the hypergeometric distribution (Eqn. 15) is used to evaluate the statistical
significance of overrepresented GO terms in a subnetwork. For malaria, we found six subnetworks in which no
functional terms were overrepresented in the original
annotation in the GOA database. To these we assigned
422 new annotations. In 146 other subnetworks we were
able to identify a total of 6,391 new overrepresented GO
terms, with an average annotation gain of 591%. To evaluate the consistency of newly predicted annotations with
previously known annotations, we used the funSim score
(Eqn. 12) to compare all of the terms within each subnetwork. It is a general assumption that interacting proteins
are involved in the same or coordinating biological pathways and coexist in the same locations within the cell
[45,46]. For malaria, newly predicted functional terms
had a positive effect on the majority of the subnetworks
as shown in the histograms (Fig. 7). On an average, BPscore, CC-score, MF-score, and funSim score similarity
increased by 0.198, 0.189, 0.195, and 0.108, respectively.
Thus, not only does the addition of predicted terms effect
in an increase in the functional information available for
annotating a subnetwork, but it also tends to refine the
overall annotation for that subnetwork.
Below we present six individual cases of interesting new
annotations to subnetworks in P. falciparum. The previous and new annotations for each of these examples are
provided in Table 5, and visual representations of the analyzed subnetworks are provided in Figure 8. The subnetwork centered by the protein Q8I1Q4 (Fig. 8A) contains
20 proteins, 14 of which are newly annotated by PFP prediction. Among the six previously annotated proteins,
representative functionality by our analysis deals with
chromosome/chromatin packing. When new high-confidence predicted annotations are considered, some new
functional terms arise as statistically overrepresented in
the subnetwork. These include several functions relating

to the cytoskeleton (actin binding and myosin, cytoskeleton-dependent transport) and nuclear-directed transport. The theme of these new annotations tends to
suggest that interactions among this group of proteins
may reveal a transport mechanism, potentially for moving proteins involved in chromosome packaging into the
nucleus. Next, protein Q8I206 centers a subnetwork of
proteins which we were unable to characterize using only
known annotations (Fig. 8B). Nine of the 15 proteins are
annotated with high-confidence predictions, revealing
two related groups of functional terms as potential representatives of the overall function of the subnetwork. The
first of these groups is related to nucleic acid binding and
transport and localization, and the second is related to
carbohydrate metabolism.
The next two examples are potentially more interesting,
especially with regard to the known pathogenicity of the
Malaria plasmodium. The group of 21 proteins centered
on Q8I255 was previously annotated with terms directly

related to pathogenesis (pathogenesis, extracellular, signal transduction) (Fig. 8C). After providing predicted
annotations for 13 of those 21 proteins, several other
functions that may be related to particular pathogenic
mechanisms were revealed. Particularly interesting are
the terms "translation regulator activity", "negative regulation of lymphocyte activation", "microtubule cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis", and "peroxisome
degradation". Although the proteins in this subnetwork
could already be associated with pathogenesis, new predicted annotations for uncharacterized proteins add
direction for designing experiments to test for specific
mechanisms that may be responsible for the pathogenic
behavior. The interaction subnetwork around Malaria
protein Q8I562 (Fig. 8D) also has some potential interest
in the molecular mechanisms that contribute to apoptosis. Again, over half of the included proteins (14 of 25)
were initially uncharacterized but could be assigned high
confidence PFP predictions. Before taking new predic-

tions into account, the cluster was annotated as being
related to "cellular protein metabolism" and "protein folding". Several more interesting and specific functional
terms were brought to light after including predictions.
These terms are related to the cytoskeleton and protein/
RNA transport and localization. Specifically, the terms
"anterior/posterior pattern formation", "RNA localization", and "cell death" are closely related and signify that
the protein interactions in this subnetwork are likely to be
involved in the programmed re-organization of the cell
leading to death, or apoptosis.
Identifying clusters of functionally related protein-coding
genes in genomes

Genome proximity is known to be related to conservation
of protein function, most notably in the cases of coordinately regulated groups of protein-coding genes in operons or regulons [47] and among some membrane
transport proteins [48]. Similarity of phylogenetic profiles
[25] and stability of local genome organization between
species [49] have also revealed functional conservation
among groups of genes. Here we scanned the three
genomes using a window of a certain size (10 kb for E. coli
and 30 kb for yeast and malaria genome) to identify
groups of neighboring genes with significant function
similarity. Windows of genes that have an overall categorical similarity (one or more of MF-score, BP-score, or CCscore) of greater than 0.7 or a comprehensive similarity
(funSim) of greater than 0.49, including new functional
terms predicted by PFP, were considered for analysis. The
threshold values, 0.7 and 0.49, are chosen to roughly
match the number of windows to be selected with the
number of known regulons in E. coli. According to the
RegulonDB database (June 2009 release) [47], there are
374 regulons in the E.coli genome. Using 0.7 in MF, BP,
and CC score selects 339 (14.7%), 377 (16.4%), and 779
(34.1%), respectively, and 0.49 in the funSim score selects
437 (18.8%) windows (Fig. 9). For example, the windows

with regulons of ribosomal subunits (rplQ, rpoA, rpsJ,
etc.), flagellar proteins (two windows: flgA, flgB, etc. and
fliE, fliF, etc.), his operon (hisL, hisG, etc.), and psp
operon (pspF, pspA, etc.), satisfy these threshold values.
Figure 10 illustrates the functional similarity scores along
the E. coli genome. Some of the known operons are
marked in color.
As with the PPI subnetworks, each genome window
identified as a target was tested for overrepresentation of
GO functional terms using only previously known annotations and then using known and predicted terms by
PFP using the hypergeometric distribution (Eqn. 15). The
percent difference between these two scenarios is used as
our standard measure of annotation gain. The summary
of the increase of the annotation to the genome windows
is shown in Table 6. Again, as was the case with annotation of PPI subnetworks, we would expect to find that
applying predicted terms to groups of proteins in E. coli
and yeast would yield some, but not an extensive, degree
of annotation gain. This indeed turned out to be true. For
E. coli and yeast, we were able to annotate 38 and 29 previously unannotated windows, respectively, in each
genome. The average annotation gain computed for previously annotated windows are 49% and 14% for E. coli
and yeast, respectively. Analysis of annotation gain
among windows in the malaria genome again yielded significantly higher increases. 37% (2418 out of 6539) of
windows with no previously known functional annotation were assigned with predicted GO terms by PFP. The
remaining 2,735 windows for which some annotation
already existed, we observed an average annotation gain
of 289% (Table 7).
Here, we also present several individual cases of new
annotation to regions in the genomes of each of the three
organisms. A summary of the new annotation is shown in
Table 7. The 30 kb region of malaria chromosome 3 starting at position 906,000 contains six proteins with an average GO biological process similarity of 0.722. The 30 kb

Hawkins et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/265

region of malaria chromosome 3 starting at position
906,000 contains six proteins with an average GO biological process similarity of 0.722. After annotating four of
the five previously uncharacterized proteins coded here
with high confidence predictions, we found that the proteins may share involvement in phosphorylation or
dephosphorylation ("phosphotransferase activity" and
"transferase activity, transferring phosphorous-containing groups"). This may indicate that these neighboring
proteins are involved in a common signaling or metabolic
pathway. Similarly, the region of malaria chromosome 7
starting at position 1,296,000 (five proteins, average biological process similarity of 0.891) was assigned several
receptor-like activities. The overrepresented terms
related to several types of receptor activity give a strong
indication that this region contains proteins that form
complex or interact closely as part of a membrane signaling receptor. Membrane receptors and complexes of
membrane proteins are well characterized as sharing
genome proximity [48]. The four proteins between positions 492,000 and 522,000 of the minus strand of Malaria
chromosome 10 (average biological process similarity of
0.860) were assigned several functional terms that all
relate to the intrinsic cellular response to nutrients. The
terms "intracellular transport", "response to nutrients",
"negative regulation of transcription by carbon catabolites", and "mitotic cell cycle" could all indicate a common
process involving metabolism and cellular signaling
response to the presence of nutrients under particular
conditions, perhaps akin to the well known lac operon in
E. coli.
E. coli is one of the most well-characterized model
organisms in terms of coordinately regulated expression
in the form of operons and regulons [47]. As such, we
would not expect to find many regions of the genome that
could represent new examples of these molecular phenomena relating to specific pathways. However, we did
find several examples including the following two where
annotation of previously uncharacterized regions might
indicate common involvement in processes. First, the 11
proteins within 10 kb of position 1,212,000 (average biological process similarity of 0.792) share broad annotations of "regulation of biological process" and
"intracellular membrane-bound organelle". Second, the
seven proteins within 10 kb of position 3,016,000 (average
biological process similarity of 0.711) share similarly
broad annotations of "transport" and "localization". In
either case, these annotations might indicate involvement
in a common complex or process in a particular membrane-bound organelle or localization pathway, and
might be enough to warrant further investigation into the
biological reason for the shared function.
Yeast is similarly well characterized, but we again found
some examples of genomic windows where application of

Page 13 of 22

new high confidence predictions revealed a shared function or related functions. There are two particularly interesting examples. First, the 15 kb region of the plus strand
of Yeast chromosome 14 starting at position 141,000 contains three proteins (average cellular component similarity of 0.749) that share the annotations "chromatin
silencing at telomere" and "telomeric heterochromatin
formation". Second, the six proteins located in 15 kb
region of chromosome 15 starting at position 342,000
(average cellular component similarity of 0.760) share the
related functions of "signal transducer activity" and
"transmembrane receptor activity".
Details of individual protein interaction subnetworks
and genomic windows, and previous and new annotations for each subnetwork and window can be found in
the supplementary data.

Discussion
In this analysis, we enriched functional annotation to the
three genomes by PFP's high confidence predictions and
represented the functional space occupied by the proteomes in the functional similarity network, where edges
between proteins (nodes) denote significant functional
similarity between them. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that structure of functional space is
analyzed as a network. Taking advantage of the PFP's
large annotation coverage [14], more than 90% of proteins
in each genome are included in the functional similarity
network (Table 1). This is a significant enrichment especially for the malaria genome, as previously only 41.9% of
proteins were annotated. We defined the functional similarity of proteins using their annotated GO terms rather
than other possible functional similarity metrics, e.g. the
conventional sequence similarity, because GO terms can
compare proteins in different aspects of functions (i.e. in
different GO categories and their combinations), which
may be more relevant to protein activity in the cell. Moreover, proteins with a high sequence similarity shows significant similarity in the annotated GO terms as well in
majority of the cases, so protein sharing GO term similarity can be considered a superset of those sharing
sequence similarity [38,50].
Our study revealed interesting characteristics of the
functional similarity networks of the three organisms
contrasted with the PPI networks. We analyzed the global
topology of the functional similarity network by computing the degree exponent, the clustering coefficient, and
the clustering degree exponent of the networks (Table 3).
In general, both functional similarity networks and PPI
networks follow the power-law, but they are distinct in
the former showing the network modularity but the latter
does not. Among the four functional similarity networks
constructed by considering individual GO-scores and the
funSim score, the funSim score network is different from

the others by exhibiting a higher tendency to be hierarchical (i.e. higher clustering degree exponent value) similar to the metabolic pathway networks. However, the
clustering degree exponent value seems to be sensitive to
the similarity threshold value used to construct the networks and the E. coli and yeast funSim score networks

values are used.

static view of protein interactions, the functional similarity networks change their topology as the similarity
threshold value is changed. Functional similarity net-

Together with the introduction of the functional similarity networks and functional coherence of individual
subsets of genes, we have demonstrated the usefulness of
computational function prediction by PFP. The same
methods can be applied to any biologically related group
of proteins. High-throughput technologies such as
microarrays and mass spectrometry that identify clusters
of proteins linked by common expression patterns or
conditions produce datasets that would also be relevant
for such an application. In the end, as PFP is a sequence
similarity-based prediction method, utilizing its high
confidence predictions takes a minimal time and energy
commitment (~1 day to run all uncharacterized proteins
for P. falciparum) and can have a significant impact on a
researcher's ability to interpret the complex datasets that
have now become the norm.

score and individual GO scores are shown.

works of a different similarity threshold value represent
different levels of granularity of the gene function space
in a genome. Investigation of the global and local structure properties of dynamically changing functional similarity networks is left as an important future work.
It is reminded that the currently available PPI networks
have several limitations; they are usually incomplete and
potentially include false positive and false negative interactions [51,52]. However, we expect that such limitations
will not affect to this work too much since the focus of
this work is the construction of the functional similarity
networks and the functional enrichment by PFP. We analyzed the PPI networks as to contrast to the newly introduced functional similarity networks. As a future work, it
may be interesting to compare the network properties of
the functional similarity networks with other types of
biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks
[53,54] or gene functional networks constructed by considering different types of experimental information [55].
Individual annotation to subnetworks in the PPI networks and genome local windows identified numerous
interesting cases where proteins in the subset show high
coherence with other members. These results provide
examples of how computational prediction can be utilized in interpreting or building hypotheses on the proteins sharing such functional association. Interestingly,
there are several cases where proteins in a genome window are functionally coherent with PFP's assignment of
broader, less-specific functional terms. These may not be
regulons or operons, where functional roles of component genes are usually better defined. Rather, these local
windows of genes may imply existence of a new type of
gene clusters where genes are inter-related by much
broader, higher-level functional category.

Conclusion
We assigned function to previously uncharacterized protein genes in Escherichia coli K-12, Saccaromyces cerevisiae, and Plasmodium falciparum with high-confidence
function prediction by the PFP method. Using the
enriched function annotation, we introduced the functional similarity network which provides an intuitive representation of the functional space of a proteome.
Comparison with the PPI networks revealed distinct features of the functional similarity networks. In addition,
PFP's function assignment identified functionally coherent subnetworks in the PPI and local regions in the
genomes. All together, this work demonstrated usefulness of the computational functional predictions by PFP.
Methods
Data sources

The genome sequence and annotation data for Escherichia coli K-12, Saccaromyces cerevisiae, and Plasmodium
falciparum were obtained from the website of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Annotations qualified as "previously known" were extracted from EBI's
GOA proteome datasets http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/.
PPI data for E. coli was obtained from Arifuzzaman et al.
[5], for S. cerevisiae was obtained from MIPS [56], and for
P. falciparum was obtained from the paper by LaCount et
al. [44]. Genome position data was obtained from the
website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/.
Computing Clustering Coefficient

The clustering coefficient of a node indicates how well
the neighboring nodes to the central node are interconnected and it is used to measure the modularity of a network [39,40]. Concretely, it is computed as follows for a
given node:

Function Prediction by PFP

GO functional terms were predicted for each sequence
without any previously assigned GO terms from E. coli, S.
cerevisiae, and P. falciparum using PFP under its optimal
parameter settings, which are described below. Refer to
the previous work [14] for detailed analyses of the effect
of using different parameter values. Only terms predicted
with high confidence (≥ 0.8) were assigned to each query
sequence. The detailed description of the algorithm as
well as thorough benchmark results of PFP have been
reported in the previous papers [13,14]. Here we will
briefly overview the PFP algorithm for readers' convenience.
The PFP algorithm predicts GO function annotations
in three categories, i.e. MF, BP, and CC, with a statistical
significance score (p-value) and the expected accuracy.
For each sequence hit retrieved by a PSI-BLAST search
[32], associated GO terms are scored according to the Evalue provided by PSI-BLAST. Then the scores of a GO
term are summed up over all the sequence hits considered. This scoring system ranks GO terms by considering
both (1) their frequency of association to sequence hits
and (2) the degree of similarity those sequences share
with the query. A GO term, fa, is scored as follows:

s( f a ) =

∑∑
i =1

P( f a | f j ) =

j =1

⎛ (− log(E _ value(i)) + b) ⎞
⎜
⎟
⎝ P( f a | f i )
⎠

c( f a , f j )+ e
c( f j )+ m ⋅e

,

(2)

(3)

where s(fa) is the final score assigned to the GO term, fa,
N is the number of the similar sequences retrieved by
PSI-BLAST, Nfunc(i) is the number of GO terms assigned
to sequence i, E_value(i) is the E-value given to the
sequence i, and fj is a GO term assigned to the sequence i.
P(fa | fj) is to take into account the association of two GO
terms, i.e. the co-occurrence of the two GO terms in the
same sequences. It is the conditional probability that fa is
associated with fj. c(fa, fj) is number of times fa and fj are
assigned simultaneously to each sequence in UniProt
[57], and c(fj) is the total number of times fj appeared in
UniProt, μ is the total number of unique GO terms considered in the associations, and ε is the pseudo-count,
which is set to 0.05. Note that the conditional probability
is asymmetric, i.e. P(fa | fj) ≠ P(fj | fa).
For running PSI-BLAST, the default E-value threshold
for inclusion in multiple iterations (-h 0.005) is used and
the maximum number of iterations is set to three (-j 3).
By shifting the scoring space by a constant (b), individual
annotations from weakly similar sequences (E-value > 1)
can be considered and scored. Here we use b = log(125) to
allow the use of sequence matches to an E-value of 125.
We also employed the score propagation by considering
hierarchical relationship of the GO terms. Each GO term
in the GO hierarchy (a directed acyclic graph) follows the

a) The direction of the DNA strands on which the genes are located.
b) The P-value of the overrepresentation of the GO term in the genes in the window

true path rule; that is, any gene associated with a GO
term must also be associated with the ancestors of that
term leading back to the ontology root. Following this
rule, we score ancestors of any predicted GO term
according to the number of genes associated to the predicted term relative to the ancestor term:
Nc

s( f p ) =

∑
i =1

⎛
⎛ c( f c )
i
⎜ s( f c ) ⎜
i ⎜
⎜
c( f p )
⎝
⎝

⎞⎞
⎟ ⎟,
⎟⎟
⎠⎠

(4)

where s(fp) is the score of the parent term fp. Nc is the
number of child GO term which belong to the parent
term fp and s(fci) is the score of a child term fci. c(fci) and
c(fp) is the number of known genes which are annotated
with function term fci and fp, respectively. The final raw
score of a GO term is given by summing up the score
which is directly computed by Eqn. 2 and those from the
ancestral score propagation by Eqn. 4.
Finally, for each predicted GO term, the p-value of the
raw score is computed by using the term-specific raw
score distribution obtained by running PFP on the benchmark dataset [14]. Then, the expected accuracy is
assigned to the prediction by referring to the correlation
of the p-value and the actual accuracy computed for each
GO term (see 6 in our previous paper [14]).
PPI network enrichment

To evaluate enrichment of annotations in the interaction
network, we compared the number of fully (both interaction partners annotated) and partially (one of the interaction partners annotated) annotated interactions before
and after application of PFP to unannotated proteins in

the dataset (Fig. 2). We considered only GO predictions
with high confidence for the node enrichment.
Partitioning PPI subnetworks

We used a randomization approach to partition the PPI
networks into significant subnetworks. Subnetworks
were created from the original dataset using each protein
as a centroid, and including all directly interacting proteins and the edges between them. The original dataset
was then randomized 100 times, maintaining the number
of interactions for each protein while changing specific
interacting partners. For each subnetwork i, the connectivity coefficient (ci) was calculated as the ratio of edges
(gi) to nodes (ni) in the interaction subnetwork:
c i = g i / ni

(5)

Statistical significance of the connectivity coefficient of
each real subnetwork was calculated using Student's T
statistic (α = 0.05):
t i = (c i − n ) / s ,

(6)

where ν is the average value of the connectivity coefficient for the set of all subnetworks of the same centroid,
and s is the variance of the connectivity coefficient values
for the same set. This method of determining statistically
significant subnetworks was used by LaCount et al. [44]
for the malaria interaction network.
Functional similarity network

Our novel concept of the functional similarity network
uses individual proteins as nodes and scored functional

Hawkins et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/265

Page 20 of 22

similarities between proteins as edges. We have used the
Schlicker method for calculating the similarity score
between two sets of GO terms that uses the structure and
information content of nodes in the GO hierarchy[38].
Using this method, the similarity of two individual GO
terms c1 and c2 is
⎛ 2 log p(c)⋅(1− p(c)) ⎞
sim(c1 , c 2 ) = max ⎜
⎟
c∈S(c1 ,c 2 ) ⎝ log p(c1)+ log p(c 2 ) ⎠

(7)

where p(c) is the annotation frequency of term c relative to the frequency of the ontology root, and S(c1, c2) is
the set of common ancestor terms between terms c1 and
c2. The similarity of two sets of terms, GO iA and GO B , of
j
respective sizes N and M is calculated by constructing an
all-by-all similarity matrix Sij.
S ij = sim(GO iA , GO B ),
j
∀i ∈ {1, … , N}, ∀j ∈ {1, … , M}

(8)

Row vectors compare the similarity of set A (protein 1)
to set B (protein 2), while column vectors compare the
similarity of set B (protein 2) to set A (protein 1).

(10)

To calculate an overall similarity score for the two term
sets, we combined these two terms for each GO category:
GOscore = max{Sim( A, B), Sim( B, A)},

(11)

where GOscore is any of the three category scores (MFscore, BP-score, CC-score). We differentiate from the
Schlicker method only to include cellular component
similarity into the overall score, which is calculated as

(12)
max(GOscore) is set to 1 (maximum possible GOscore)
and the range of the funSim score is [0,1]. To construct

the function similarity networks for each organism, we
performed an all-by-all pairwise comparison to find the
funSim and category GOscore values for each unique protein pair.
In the functional similarity networks, pairs with the
GOScore or funSim score of 0.95 or higher are connected
by edges. The networks are visualized with Cytoscape
[58].
Identifying significant genomic windows

To identify functionally similar regions of a genome, we
used a sliding window approach. For each organism we
used a unique window size (10 kb for E. coli, 30 kb for P.
falciparum, 15 kb for S. cerevisiae) and a slide value equal
to 1/5 the window size. The window sizes were determined such that the number of genes for both strands in
any window averaged between eight and ten. Genes
included in the window were taken from the plus and
minus strands individually and also from both strands
together. Windows for which the category GO score was
above 0.7 or the funSim was above 0.49 were analyzed for
overrepresentation of GO functional terms by the
method described below.
Identifying significantly overrepresented terms in groups
of proteins

Functional analysis of the PPI subnetworks and the
genome windows is performed by identifying overrepresented GO terms in the subset relative to the annotation
set of the entire proteome. Overrepresented terms are
found essentially by applying the hypergeometric distribution to all terms annotated to proteins in the cluster
[59]. The probability of a GO term X being annotated to a
protein in the cluster is computed by:
⎛ m ⎞⎛ N −m ⎞
⎜ ⎟⎜
⎟
k
n−k ⎠
f (k ; N , m, n) = ⎝ ⎠⎝
,
⎛N⎞
⎜ ⎟
⎝ n ⎠

(13)

where k is the number of proteins in the cluster annotated with X, N is the number of annotated proteins in the
organism, m is the number of proteins in the organism
annotated with X, and n is the number of annotated proteins in the cluster. To calculate a p-value for overrepresentation of a term, we use this probability for annotation
of k or more proteins in the cluster:
n

Phg ( X ) =

∑ f (i; N , m, n).

(14)

i=k

Because we are analyzing overrepresentation of several
GO terms, we use the false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple hypothesis testing:

⎛ q +1 ⎞
p _ corrFDR( X ) = ⎜
⎟ ⋅ p hg ( X ).
⎝ 2⋅q ⎠

Page 21 of 22

8.

(15)

where q is the number of unique GO terms annotated
to proteins in the cluster.
The annotation gain for a subset of proteins is calculated as the percentage increase in the number of unique
new statistically overrepresented annotations as compared to the number of previously known annotations.
