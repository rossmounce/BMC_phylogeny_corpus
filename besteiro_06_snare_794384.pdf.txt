Abstract
Background: Leishmania major is a protozoan parasite with a highly polarised cell shape that
depends upon endocytosis and exocytosis from a single area of the plasma membrane, the flagellar
pocket. SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor adaptor proteins receptors) are key
components of the intracellular vesicle-mediated transports that take place in all eukaryotic cells.
They are membrane-bound proteins that facilitate the docking and fusion of vesicles with
organelles. The recent availability of the genome sequence of L. major has allowed us to assess the
complement of SNAREs in the parasite and to investigate their location in comparison with
metazoans.
Results: Bioinformatic searches of the L. major genome revealed a total of 27 SNARE domaincontaining proteins that could be classified in structural groups by phylogenetic analysis. 25 of these
possessed the expected features of functional SNAREs, whereas the other two could represent
kinetoplastid-specific proteins that might act as regulators of the SNARE complexes. Other
differences of Leishmania SNAREs were the absence of double SNARE domain-containing and of
the brevin classes of these proteins. Members of the Qa group of Leishmania SNAREs showed
differential expressions profiles in the two main parasite forms whereas their GFP-tagging and in
vivo expression revealed localisations in the Golgi, late endosome/lysosome and near the flagellar
pocket.
Conclusion: The early-branching eukaryote L. major apparently possess a SNARE repertoire that
equals in number the one of metazoans such as Drosophila, showing that the machinery for vesicle
fusion is well conserved throughout the eukaryotes. However, the analysis revealed the absence of
certain types of SNAREs found in metazoans and yeast, while suggesting the presence of original
SNAREs as well as others with unusual localisation. This study also presented the intracellular
localisation of the L. major SNAREs from the Qa group and reveals that these proteins could be
useful as organelle markers in this parasitic protozoon.

Background
Eukaryotic cells contain many internal organelles surrounded by membrane boundaries, where specialised and

essential functions are performed. The traffic between
these different organelles is mainly mediated by vesicular
transport [1]. The mechanism required for this type of

transport involves a complex and specifically regulated
machinery that allows budding of vesicles from a donor
compartment, followed by their translocation to their target, to which they have to dock and then fuse. Among the
lipid and protein factors that are thought to be involved in
these processes, a large family of proteins called soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) adaptor proteins
(SNAPs) receptors (SNAREs) are considered essential (see
[2-4] for a review).
SNAREs were originally classified according to the membrane component where they were required, as v-SNAREs
(associated with the vesicles) or t-SNAREs (associated
with the target compartment) [5]. These proteins have a
helical structure and the interaction between v-SNAREs
and t-SNAREs leads to the formation of a trans-SNARE
complex consisting of four SNARE motifs in a parallel
four-helical bundle catalysing the docking and fusion of
the vesicle with the target compartment [6,7]. Tethering
factors and regulators such as Rab or Sec1/Munc family of
proteins allow a fine spatial and temporal control of
SNARE-mediated fusion and might as well monitor specificity [8]. One possible contradiction with the original
SNARE hypothesis is that the same SNARE might be
involved in several targeting events and be required either
on a vesicle or a target membrane [9]. Thus, rather than
being functionally classified in v- and t-SNAREs, these
proteins can also be structurally distinguished. Indeed,
the SNARE motif involved in the formation of the helical
bundle of the SNARE complex is conserved but bears
unique features allowing the classification as Q- and R-,
according to the residue present in the centre of the motif
[10]. The Q group can be further divided into three subgroups according to their overall homology in the SNARE
domain: Qa (or syntaxins), Qb (or SNAP N-terminal) and
Qc (or SNAP C-terminal) [11].
Kinetoplastid parasites, such as Trypanosoma or Leishmania
are very polarised cells that contain a dense and complex
membrane network around the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the plasma membrane where the flagellum
emerges from the cell body and where most of the
exchanges with the external milieu occur [12]. The exocytic and endocytic pathways are contained within the
anterior region of the Leishmania cell and the polarised
organelles include the endosomal and lysosomal systems,
the Golgi complex, but not the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) that is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Kinetoplastids are among the earliest-branching eukaryotes possessing a mitochondrion. Indeed, recent analyses
combining taxon-rich nuclear small subunit rRNA gene
trees and protein phylogenies confirm that they are
related to euglenoids [14], with whom they form one of
the eight eukaryotic group called discicristates [15]. Thus,
kinetoplastids constitute an interesting model to study the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/250

features of the vesicular and membrane transport systems
that could have been conserved from more primitive
eukaryotes [13]. More importantly, the very function of
intracellular traffic has obvious implications for parasites,
which depend extensively on endocytic and exocytic pathways, whether it is to get nutrients from the host or secrete
virulence factors.
The recent availability of the complete genome sequence
from Leishmania major [16] has allowed us to conduct a
genome-wide analysis of the potential SNAREs present in
the parasite. We have particularly focused on the members
of the syntaxin subfamily to analyse their expression and,
using GFP-tagged expression, elucidate their location
within Leishmania.

Results and discussion
Classification of SNARE domain-containing L. major
predicted proteins
As SNARE proteins share a conserved functional domain,
we used sequence homology searches to identify proteins
bearing this SNARE coiled-coil domain in the L. major predicted proteome. We found 27 putative proteins and used
a phylogenetic analysis to classify them after multiple
sequence alignments of their SNARE domain [10,11].
When analysed, the Leishmania sequences segregated to
four different groups (Qa, Qb, Qc and R, Fig. 1) in accordance with genome-wide classifications performed with
other organisms [2,11,17]. The identification of each
structural group was performed by including sequences
from already characterised members of the Qa (human
syntaxin 5a) Qb (yeast Vt1p), Qc (human Bet1) and R
(human Vamp1) groups. Group clustering was then further checked by including more sequences from characterised human or yeast proteins and performing amino acid
alignments of the SNARE domains (Additional file 1, Fig.
S1A–D). We could then confirm that the Qa group, bearing members of the syntaxin family (see [18] for a review),
is comprised of seven proteins in Leishmania, that the
same number of proteins are clustered in each of the Qb
and Qc groups, whereas the R group comprises six members.
General and structural features of L. major SNAREs
The L. major putative SNAREs generally appear to have the
conserved features observed for these proteins (see Additional file 2 and Figure S2 of Additional file 1). Most of
them are small (between 100–360 amino acids), and bear
a C-terminal hydrophobic region that could act as membrane-anchoring domain. A few proteins (LmjF28.1480,
LmjF33.1340, LmjF32.2160 and LmjF35.2120) do not
have any predicted transmembrane domain or GPIanchor and thus might rely on a different process to bind
to the membranes. Indeed, LmjF33.1340 and
LmjF35.2120 have predicted prenylation sites (in posi-

from Additional file 1) from L. major predicted SNARE proteins was aligned using the Clustal W algorithm and a phylogenetic
tree was generated as described in the Methods section. Selected characterised members from the Qa, Qb, Qc and R groups
were included in the analysis (boxed). They are, respectively, human Syntaxin 5A (NP_012262), yeast Vti1p (Q04338), yeast
Bet1 (NP_012262) and human Vamp1 (CAA88760). Branches with bootstrap values > 45 in green and > 90 in red. The scale

tions 272 and 202, respectively) and the same C-terminal
cysteine residue of LmjF35.2120 could also be palmitoylated. Protein lipidation has been shown before to be
a way of linking SNAREs to membranes, for example the
human SNAREs syntaxin 11 [19] and Ytk6, can be both
prenylated and palmitoylated [20]. The other two proteins lacking predicted transmembrane domains
(LmjF28.1480, LmjF32.2160), also appear to be lacking
putative lipidation sites, so their membrane attachment
may be mediated by binding to another SNARE, as suggested for human SNARE SNAP-25 [21].
All the identified sequences contained a single SNARE
motif, generally located at the C-terminal end of the proteins. Animals, higher plants and fungi contain SNAP-25like proteins bearing two SNARE motifs, at their N- and Ctermini (i.e. SNAP-25, SNAP-23 and SNAP-29 in humans,
Sec9p and Spo20p in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
Their N-terminal motif belongs to the Qb group and the
C-terminal one to the Qc group. However, we could not
identify any protein containing two SNARE motifs in L.
major, which is consistent with the observation made previously for other early-branching eukaryotes such as
Trypanosoma brucei and the diplomonad Giardia lamblia
[13].
Most of the putative SNAREs we identified were found to
possess specific N-terminal domains (see Additional file 2
and Figure S2 of Additional file 1). The Qa/syntaxins
group is usually characterised by the presence of a N-terminal helical bundle (named Habc, as it contains three
helical regions Ha, Hb and Hc) that can in some cases fold
back into a closed conformation to interact with the
SNARE motif [22,23] and be opened by regulator proteins. Using secondary structure prediction programs, we
could identify the presence of such a bundle in all the
members of the Qa group of L. major (see Additional file
2 and Figure S2 of Additional file 1). A similar series of
helixes could as well be unambiguously predicted in
sequences from L. major SNARE members of the Qb and
Qc groups (see Additional file 2 and Figure S2 of Additional file 1). This is not surprising, as human syntaxin 6
(belonging to the Qc group) and vti1 (belonging to the
Qb group) have also been shown to possess this feature
[22,24]. Another characteristic feature identified in L.
major SNAREs was found in the members of the R group.
R-SNAREs can be subdivided into short VAMPs (vesicleassociated membrane proteins), also called brevins, and
long VAMPs, or longins, depending on whether they contain a short and variable domain or a conserved longin
domain (of up to 150 amino acids) at their N-terminus
[25]. Brevins seem to be absent from the L. major SNARE
repertoire, as indeed they are from Plasmodium falciparum
and Arabidopsis thaliana [25]. All of the six identified L.
major proteins with a putative R-SNARE domain pos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/250

sessed a N-terminal extension, which could be clearly
identified, for most of them, through sequence homology
with the longin domain (see Additional file 2 and Figure
S2 of Additional file 1).
SNARE-interacting proteins
The N-terminal domains of SNAREs are known to be
involved in their regulation through interaction with several factors. As SNAREs play a crucial role in membrane
fusion, these events need to be tightly regulated in space
and time and a variety of SNARE-interacting proteins have
already been identified. We searched the L. major genomic
database and identified some of the key factors that might
help regulate the SNARE machinery (Table 1).

Some of the most essential regulators of SNARE complexes are the human SNAP and NSF proteins (Sec17 and
Sec18 in S. cerevisiae). NSF is an AAA-ATPase that functions as an hexameric complex to dissociate the SNARE
complex through hydrolysis of ATP [26,27]. NSF is bound
to the SNARE complex through an association with several α-SNAP proteins whose positively charged residues
are linked to acidic charges of the SNARE complex [28].
Humans also express a neurons-specific β-SNAP isoform
and a related ubiquitous γ-SNAP, which might not be able
to interact directly with the SNARE complex but interacts
with NSF [29]. The L. major database contains a putative
NSF (LmjF20.0810) bearing a predicted AAA-ATPase
domain (residues 254–453). We also found two isoforms
of the α/β-SNAP family (LmjF20.1690, LmjF32.2890)
and one orthologue of γ-SNAP (LmjF34.0540). This
would be consistent with the presence of well-conserved
SNARE complex dissociation machinery in L. major.
Another family of SNARE-regulating proteins is the Sec1/
Munc18 (SM) family, for which there is still controversy
as to their putative SNARE-inhibiting or activating function [30]. However, recent data shows a potential role for
mouse Munc18-1 in establishing a strongly tethered state
of the SNARE complex and also in regulating the vesicle
delivery rate [31]. The mode of interaction of SM proteins
with their cognate SNARE proteins also appears to be
complex, and there could be distinct mechanisms at different stages in the SNARE assembly/disassembly cycle
[32]. Proteins of the SM family appear to function at different intracellular membrane compartments, have generally a high specificity for one SNARE protein and are
thought to act as chaperone-like molecules [30]. For
example, S. cerevisiae has four SM proteins: Sec1p, located
at the plasma membrane; Sly1p, involved in cis-Golgi traffic; Vps45p, involved in trans-Golgi traffic; Vps33p,
located at the vacuole/lysosome. In L. major, we found five
putative SM proteins: one Sly1-like, two Vps45-like, one
Vps33-like and one Sec1/Munc18-like. This suggests that
all the classes of SM proteins are present in L. major.

List of identified putative L. major SNARE-interacting orthologues with their BLAST E value and their predicted size in amino acids (AA).

There are other proteins that have been shown to interact
with SNAREs and several of which are present only in certain species, or even specialised cell types in metazoans.
Most of these factors could not be identified in L. major,
but some proteins orthologous to human SNARE-interacting proteins, including a putative epsin [33] or a GATE16 orthologue [34] could be found (LmjF25.0670 and
LmjF25.0670, respectively). Similarly, orthologues to
SNARE-interacting proteins from S. cerevisiae known as
DNA-damage inducible protein DDI1/Vsm1 [35] and
members of the Vtc complex [36], are apparently also
present in the L. major genome.
The Qa/syntaxin sub-family: gene expression
Characterisation of a neuronal endosomal SNARE complex showed it contained Syn7 (Qa), Vti1b (Qb), Syn8
(Qc) and VAMP8 (R) [37] and it is now generally believed
that one member of each SNARE motif group (Qa, Qb,
Qc, R) is involved in the formation of a single SNARE
complex. Thus, we analysed more thoroughly members of
the Qa/syntaxin sub-family only, to gain some general
insights on the expression or localisation of Leishmania
SNAREs.

First, to determine if the genes coding for the members of
the Qa group were transcribed, we isolated total RNA
from L. major promastigote and amastigote forms and performed semi-nested reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)
using a mRNA-specific "splice-leader" (SL) primer to
amplify syntaxin transcripts (Fig. 2). In kinetoplastids,
one of the major mechanisms regulating gene expression
is at the level of translation [38], thus the presence of
mRNA does not systematically account for the expression
of the corresponding protein. However, we could detect
transcripts for all genes belonging to the Qa group in L.

major promastigotes (Fig. 2A) and/or amastigotes (Fig.
2B), except LmjF19.0120, which might be expressed at a
very low level, or in another developmental form. The
identity of the DNA fragments was confirmed by sequencing or restriction digest and all were as expected except for
LmjF32.0070 in promastigotes, which was a PCR artefact
(* in Fig 2A). LmjF28.1470, LmjF29.0070 and
LmjF33.1340 expression was only detected in promastigotes, LmjF32.0070 only in amastigotes, LmjF28.1480 and
LmjF35.2720 in both life cycle stages. Overall, these data
suggest that, rather than being constant and ubiquitous,
the expression of some of the SNAREs in Leishmania could
be stage-regulated, which might reflect different trafficking requirements of different forms of the parasite.
The analysis of the mRNA-derived PCR products also
allowed us to determine the SL addition site and therefore
the likely ATG start codon for several of the genes. This
was then compared with the automatic annotation carried
out on the L. major genome [39]. A putative upstream inframe start codon could be found for syntaxin 1-like gene
LmjF28.1470, suggesting the production of a corresponding protein that would be longer than the one originally
predicted. This is of importance as the additional N-terminal sequence lengthens the first two of the Habc helixes
that are proposed to have a role in the targeting and function of syntaxin 1 [23,40]. In contrast, the product corresponding to LmjF28.1480 yielded a putative first start
codon that was followed by three early stop codons
shortly after, suggesting that the corresponding extended
protein would not be produced and that LmjF28.1480
could be a pseudo gene. Finally, sequencing of the 5' end
of the product obtained for LmjF32.0070 in amastigotes
identified a start codon potentially used that is upstream
of the one annotated in the L. major genome. However,

the N-terminal extension of the predicted protein, in this
case, did not significantly modify the structure of the Habc
helixes as verified by software analysis (data not shown).
The Qa/syntaxin sub-family: protein locations
To identify the intracellular locations of SNARE complexes in L. major, we systematically tagged with GFP the
N-terminal end of the seven Qa members that we have
identified and expressed them in L. major promastigotes
in order to localise them by fluorescence microscopy.
Such an approach has been used successfully before, for
example to determine the localisation of A. thaliana
SNAREs [17]. The seven genes coding for putative Qa
members were amplified from L. major genomic DNA by
PCR, cloned into a GFP-fusion expression vector [41],
transfected into L. major promastigotes. Expression of the
predicted fusion proteins for each gene was confirmed by
Western blot with an anti-GFP antibody (Figure S3 from
Additional file 1) and the cells were then observed by fluorescence microscopy. As overexpression of the fusion
proteins can potentially lead to a mistargeting to
improper locations, great care was taken in analysing the
localisations and looking for consistency of the obtained
signals in cells displaying either weak or strong fluorescence.

A variety of fluorescence patterns were obtained and colocalisation with established cellular markers was used to
tentatively identify the labelled compartments. With the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/250

exception of LmjF28.1480, all the constructs yielded
localised signals, consistent with a presence in organelles
of a vesicular nature and the probable membrane association of L. major Qa SNAREs. GFP-fused LmjF19.0120 and
LmjF29.0070 produced similar types of signals, they were
usually found to label a vesicular population concentrated
at the anterior part of the cell (Fig. 3A). We used the
lipophilic marker FM4-64 as an endocytic tracer in the
GFP-LmjF19.0120-expressing cell line and found that
after short incubation times (5–10 minutes), the GFP signal and FM4-64 were not co-localising, whereas longer
incubation times (20 minutes-1 hour) with the dye led to
a co-localisation (Fig. 3A). This suggests that the GFPfused protein was present in the late endosomes or lysosomes. Similar results were obtained with the cell line
expressing GFP-LmjF29.0070 (data not shown). Furthermore, in stationary-phase cultures from both cell lines,
the signal could sometimes be seen extending in a characteristic tubular shape that was co-localising with FM4-64
(Fig. 3B). This probably represented a tubular type of
endosome or the MVT-lysosome compartment [42,43].
GFP-fused LmjF33.1340 and LmjF35.2720 displayed
comparable signals, consisting of a variable number of
puncta located throughout the cell body and often displaying a strong labelling at the anterior part of the cell,
close to the mitochondrial DNA (also called the kinetoplast) (Fig. 4, arrowheads). LmjF33.1340 was generally
found to display less of these puncta than LmjF35.2720
(Fig.4, compare A and B). As both proteins are somewhat
similar in sequence to syntaxin 16 (see Additional file 2),
which is a Golgi syntaxin, and as the Golgi apparatus is
known to be located at the anterior part of the cell in kinetoplastids, we performed co-localisation studies with an
antibody raised against T. brucei Rab1, a characterised
kinetoplastid Golgi apparatus marker [44]. The results
show that, although closely located, the syntaxins and
Rab1 are in distinct locations (Fig. 4, right). Kinetoplastids possess a single Golgi apparatus, but as this
organelle has a complex architecture with multiple cisternae and a typical cis-trans organisation, the GFP-fused proteins could still be in a part of the Golgi where Rab1 is not
present. The complex signal pattern, however, could be
suggestive of a localisation within multiple cellular compartments. The presence of some punctate labelling in a
part of the cell between the kinetoplast and the flagellar
pocket zone might suggest an association with early endosomal compartments, but the lack of co-localisation with
endocytosed dye FM4-64 (data not shown) argue against
this. The other GFP-stained structures in the rest of the cell
body also remained unidentified, as no co-localisation
could be shown with markers of the vesicular organelles
acidocalcisomes (vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase, VH+-PP [45]) and glycosomes (phosphofructokinase, PFK
[46]) (data not shown).

DNA) in the enlarged images. Co-localised signal is shown in yellow. Scale bar = 10 µm.

GFP-fused LmjF32.0070 was found in a compartment
next to the kinetoplast (Fig. 5A). The labelled structures
appeared to be duplicated in dividing cells before segregating during cytokinesis (Fig. 5A), similarly to what was

observed for the generation of a new Golgi stack in dividing trypanosomes [47]. Moreover, when the cells were
also stained for Rab1, there was a close association of the
two signals (Fig. 5B), although they do not totally overlap.

Arrowheads point the predominantly fluorescent signal located close to the Golgi staining. Scale bar = 10 µm.

Hence, it appears that GFP-LmjF32.0070 is present in the
Golgi system but might not be in the same sub-compartment as Rab1. This correlates well with the fact that
LmjF32.0070 appears to be a Leishmania orthologue of
syntaxin 5 (see Additional file 2), a Golgi syntaxin.
When the GFP-fused predicted syntaxin 1 homologue
LmjF28.1470 (Fig. 6A, top panel) was expressed, all the
cells displayed a very localised GFP signal at the very end

of the anterior part of the cell body (Fig. 6A, bottom
panel), and some cells also showed in addition an ER-like
reticulated staining pattern. We used the lipophilic tracer
FM4-64, known to accumulate in the flagellar pocket of
kinetoplastids when incubated at 4°C [48], to label this
compartment. Co-localisation between the GFPLmjF28.1470 and FM4-64-labelled flagellar pocket
revealed that the two signals were in distinct locations, but
closely associated (Fig. 6B bottom panel). This would be

indicative of the presence of the GFP-fused protein in a
compartment spatially close to the flagellar pocket. Given
the highly polarised organisation of the trafficking in
kinetoplastids around the flagellar pocket, this would be
consistent with a role of LmjF28.1470 in the cellular
exchanges with the external milieu. Cells transfected with
the construct producing the GFP-fused short version of
LmjF28.1470 (Fig. 6B, top panel) displayed a reticulated
signal of internal membranes, especially dense in the peri-

nuclear zone (Fig. 6A, middle panel). In kinetoplastids,
the ER comprises a nuclear envelope and a connected system of cisternal or tubular membranes that extends
throughout the cell body. We performed co-localisation
experiments between GFP-short LmjF28.1470 and ER-resident protein LmLCB2 [49] and found that there was an
extensive co-localisation of the two signals (Fig. 6A, bottom panel). This would be consistent with a localisation
of this version of GFP-LmjF28.1470 in a sub-compart-

ment of the ER. The N-terminal series of Habc helixes
from syntaxin 1 is proposed to be able to bind the coiledcoil region of the SNARE motif to prevent the protein
from interacting with unwanted partners during its trafficking to the plasma membrane [23,40]. In a mammalian
cell type not expressing the SNAP-25 SNARE protein, Nterminally-truncated chimeras of syntaxin 1A localise to
the ER, whereas the full-length protein is targeted to the
plasma membrane [40]. This would appear to be similar
in L. major, as the parasite lacks SNAP-25 homologues and
we could localise the short form of LmjF28.1470 in the
ER.

Finally LmjF28.1480, which only differs from the short
LmjF28.1470 in its C-terminal part with the absence of a
predicted transmembrane domain, displayed a cytoplasmic fluorescent signal once fused with GFP (Fig. 7). No
prenylation or palmitoylation site could be predicted for
this protein (see Additional file 2) and the localisation of
GFP fusions seems to confirm that it is not membraneassociated.
For several GFP-fusion proteins, some cells had labelling
in more than one compartment. For instance, in some
cells GFP-short LmjF28.1470 could apparently be seen in

the Golgi in addition to the ER and, in a few cases, GFPLmjF19.0120 was present on the plasma membrane in
addition to the endo-lysosomal system. Clearly, these
could be artefactual mislocalisations due to an overexpression of the GFP-fused proteins, but might also represent the fact that some SNAREs, although present in main
organelle at steady-state levels, are cycling between two
different compartments.
Identifying L. major SNAREs
When putative homologues of the L. major SNAREs were
searched for using BLAST, the returned results yielded E
values generally higher than 10e-20 (see Additional file 2).
In most cases, the homology was significant within the
SNARE domain, but not throughout the whole sequence.
The analysis of the SNARE domain allowed us to classify
L. major SNAREs into groups, but that is not sufficient to
assign a function and a localisation to each individual
SNARE. The localisation itself can be an additional clue to
the identification of a SNARE, but as seen with the systematic GFP tagging of the members of the Qa group, sometimes it does not clearly match the expected BLAST result,
such as with LmjF33.1340 and LmjF35.2720. The signals
that drive the localisation of SNAREs are not well understood and can vary a lot: in some cases both the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain are of crucial
importance, such as with syntaxin 5, and sometimes only
the cytoplasmic tail bears the targeting signal, like the dileucine motif used by endosomal syntaxins 7 and 8 [50].

When combining manual sequence alignments and analysis (looking for the presence of certain features, such as
an absence of a transmembrane domain) and information on their localisation, we can only confidently annotate a few of the Leishmania SNARE proteins out of the 27

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/250

as orthologues of other known SNAREs. These are Qa
SNARE LmjF32.0070, which shares 23% overall protein
sequence identity with human syntaxin 5A and also localises to the Golgi and Qa SNARE LmjF28.1470 (along with
related LmjF28.1480), which shares 38% and 39% identity in the SNARE domain with plasma membrane
SNAREs such as S. cerevisiae Sso1p and human Syntaxin
1a, respectively and whose localisation in Leishmania
shows it could be involved in a similar role. Finally,
although we did not study its localisation, R syntaxin
LmjF35.2120 can be identified thanks to its sequence features, as it shares 37% overall protein sequence identity
with human Ytk6 and, like its orthologue, lacks a predicted transmembrane domain, but has a putative prenylation/palmitoylation site (Ytk6 is known to be able to
mediate its own palmitoylation thanks to an activity
located in the longin domain [51]). However, in general,
there is poor sequence conservation, which presumably
reflects the great sequence divergence of SNAREs between
evolutionarily distant organisms. For instance, mammalian and yeast Bet1 are short (less than 150 amino acids)
SNAREs from the Qc group and only share 17.5% amino
acid sequence similarity between them. Two of the three
short putative L. major Qc SNAREs (LmjF25.0090 and
LmjF29.0630) share between 19 and 22%, respectively,
amino acid identity with human Bet1. The remaining L.
major short Qc SNARE (LmjF21.0560) did not return any
significant BLAST result but shares 14.5% amino acid
identity with Bet1-related mammalian GS15, also a Qc
SNARE. Bet1 and GS15 are not the only proteins involved
in vesicle fusion in the Golgi apparatus, but they are complexed to the same SNARE partners, although they act in
an opposite directions for vesicle transport [52]. Hence,
beyond the information given by the sequence, or even
the location of the protein, functional studies are crucial
to clearly assign a function and a name to each individual
SNARE.
Peculiarities of L. major SNAREs
The difficulty in clearly identifying SNARE homologues in
L. major could also be due to the presence of a few novel
SNAREs in L. major. This suggestion is supported by the
fact that several members of the groups gave plant
SNAREs as best BLAST hits (see Additional file 2), and
plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana have a large number of
SNAREs, some of which have a specialised and original
role [17]. Our bioinformatic analysis of the predicted L.
major SNAREs indeed reveals some peculiarities. First,
Leishmania seem to be lacking several types of SNAREs
including SNAP-25-like, large proteins bearing two
SNARE motifs that can be found in fungi, plants and animals. Similarly, our analysis did not reveal the presence of
any brevin-like proteins in the R group. However, Leishmania seem to possess a reasonably big SNARE repertoire
(27) compared to the size of its genome and to the

Page 11 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:250

SNAREs numbers of yeast (21) or even metazoan like
Caenorhabditis elegans (23) or Drosophila melanogaster (26)
[11]. Also, the SNARE hypothesis implies an involvement
of one member of each SNARE group into a complex and
interestingly in this regard, with the exception of the R
group, Leishmania possesses quite comparable numbers of
proteins in the different groups. This suggests that the
functions carried out by the missing SNAREs can be performed by structurally different ones in Leishmania.
Indeed, L. major might also possess SNAREs not commonly found in other organisms. For instance, no homologue could be found for LmjF06.0820 (see Additional
file 2), which is quite big for a SNARE (397 amino acids)
but yields a predicted C-terminal transmembrane domain
and, more importantly, a bona fide SNARE motif of the Qc
type.
Two other putative L. major proteins bearing a SNARE
domain were also special in the fact that they did not seem
to contain any predicted transmembrane domain or lipidation site for attachment to the membrane
(LmjF32.2160 and LmjF28.1480, see Additional file 2).
Not only does LmjF32.2160 not possess a predicted membrane attachment motif, but it is also very larege (over
1300 amino acids) for a SNARE protein and, despite having an apparent R-SNARE motif, is unlikely to be functional. It has been shown that several syntaxin-binding
proteins, such as tomosyn, possess a SNARE-like coiledcoil domain that would allow them to bind to and regulate a SNARE complexes [10]. Indeed, tomosyn regulates
in space and time the release of neurotransmitters in neuronal tissues from mammals [53] and also C. elegans [54].
Interestingly, like LmjF32.2160, tomosyn is a large protein (over 1000 amino acids), lacking a C-terminal membrane anchor, and possessing a R-SNARE motif. However,
LmjF32.2160 bears no significant sequence similarity and
lacks the N-terminal WD40 repeats (generally involved in
protein complexes formation) present in tomosyns. We
could also find LmjF32.2160 homologues in two other
kinetoplastids Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi, which suggests a conserved role for the protein in these parasites.
However, it remains to be determined whether
LmjF32.2160 is associated with the regulation of SNARE
complexes. GFP-fusion of the predicted LmjF28.1480
showed that, indeed, it appeared to be soluble within the
cytosol of cells (Fig. 7). However, as the LmjF28.1480 gene
is located in the Leishmania genome in tandem with
LmjF28.1470, which codes for a non-soluble Qa SNARE
and only differs in its predicted version by the last 40
nucleotides of its 3' sequence, it might have arisen by gene
duplication but have lost functionality. Indeed, a corresponding mRNA could be detected, but was longer than
expected and contained several stop codons in the 5' UTR,
suggesting that LmjF28.1480 could be a pseudogene.
However, whether Leishmania can still possibly produce

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/250

the short soluble version of LmjF28.1480 remains to be
determined.
The LmjF28.1470/LmjF28.1480 genes represent a good
illustration of both the conservation and additional complexity of the SNARE function in Leishmania. 5' mapping
of the LmjF28.1470 mRNA-derived product amplified by
PCR suggests that the protein can be produced, however a
shorter version, potentially produced from an in-frame
ATG, has a different cellular localisation. LmjF28.1470 is
located near to the flagellar pocket, consistent with a role
for a syntaxin 1 homologue, whereas N-terminally truncated LmjF28.1470 is found in the ER, where artificially
produced syntaxin 1 chimeras have been found in mammalian cells. If only the full-length version of syntaxin 1 is
produced, this raises the question as to what SNARE(s)
would be involved in vesicular fusion in the ER in Leishmania, as no other member of the Qa group was found to
localise to this compartment. Vesicular fusion in the ER
could be mediated in a different way in Leishmania or,
although in contradiction with the SNARE hypothesis,
this function could be complemented by a member from
different group. Even if the phylogenetic analysis of the
SNARE domains was quite clear, there could also have
been a misannotation of one of the Qa members, or it
might be so divergent that it was not found in the genome
database. The syntaxin 1 repertoire seems to be increased
by alternative splicing in other organisms [55,56] with tissue-specific expression profiles and functions. Thus,
another hypothesis is that Leishmania could produce both
LmjF28.1470 isoforms to act in different compartments as
a part of different SNARE complexes. In any case, our findings only lay the groundwork for future functional studies
and the analysis of the native SNARE proteins of Leishmania could possibly unveil a few surprises.

Conclusion
We have identified 27 SNARE domain-containing putative proteins encoded in the genome of L. major, which
could be classified into the four major groups of SNAREs
based on the sequence of their SNARE motif. The SNARE
repertoire is more than can be found in organisms such as
S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Additionally, we identified several putative regulatory proteins of the SNARE complexes.
Systematic GFP-fusion and in vivo expression of the members of the Qa/syntaxin group also revealed targeting of
some to specific intracellular compartments. Together,
these data suggest that L. major, and kinetoplastids in general, have a well-developed vesicle-fusion machinery of
which features appear to be conserved throughout the various eukaryotic lineages. The amenability of these proteins to N-terminal GFP fusion should make some of the
proteins useful markers for specific intracellular compartments that are currently lacking for the cell biology studies
of kinetoplastid parasites. The SNAREs are generally very

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:250

divergent in sequence and, for most it has not been possible to ascribe a function in Leishmania based solely on
sequence similarity. To this end there is a need for targeted
functional studies, especially because L. major also has
some predicted SNAREs that appear very peculiar in structure and so analyses of these could give insights into new
functions and cellular mechanisms. Our data suggest that
the expression of certain SNAREs may be stage-regulated
in Leishmania, and as the trafficking machinery is important for the virulence of these parasites, future studies may
reveal some interesting opportunities to discover ways of
interfering with critical pathways.

Methods
Genome searches
We retrieved all previously identified SNARE proteins
sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens
genomes from the NCBI protein database [57]. These
sequences were used in BLASTP searches against the Leishmania major genome at GeneDB [39]. BLAST hits having
log E values of < 0.1 were used for further analysis. The
Pfam motif search utility within GeneDB was also used to
detect annotated SNARE domain-containing proteins. S.
cerevisiae and H. sapiens sequences from each SNARE
group (Qa, Qb, Qc and R) were used to create an Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) profile for each of the subgroups,
using the HMMER package [58], and each profile was
used to search against the GeneDB L. major predicted proteins database (10/05/05 release) to identify any additional candidate. As a last control, the SNARE domain
only of each identified L. major sequence was used for a
BLASTP search of the L. major GeneDB database to try to
identify any other possible candidate.

All the obtained L. major protein sequences were searched
against the Pfam [59] and PROSITE [60] domain databases to confirm their homologies and locate the identified domains. Domains used for identification were Pfam
domains PF05739 (SNARE), PF05008 (V-SNARE),
PF00957 (Synaptobrevin) and PROSITE domains
PS50192 (SNARE), PS50892 (V-SNARE), PS50859
(longin).
Putative functions were assigned to the identified predicted proteins by BLASTP search against the NCBI nr
database when we obtained a good score (E value usually
less than 10-20) with a corresponding functionally characterised protein from another eukaryote and a reciprocal
BLASTP search in the GeneDB database with the characterised protein sequence also gave the L. major protein as
the best match.
Sequences alignments and phylogenetic analyses
Amino acid sequences of the SNARE domain only were
aligned using the Clustal W algorithm with AlignX pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/250

gram included in the Vector NTI 7.1 package (Invitrogen).
The set of data was exported as a multiple sequence file
(MSF) format and used to build a phylogenetic tree with
the MEGA3 software [61,62]. The tree was made using the
UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages) algorithm and Poisson-corrected amino acid
distance was used. The tree was then unrooted and radiation representation was used to visualise it. The reliability
of clustering patterns in the tree was tested by bootstrapping (1000 pseudoreplicates).
Sequences analyses
Transmembrane domains and protein topologies were
predicted using the Sosui algorithm [63,64]. Secondary
structures in the N-terminal parts of syntaxins were predicted using the Jpred algorithm [65,66]. Putative prenylation sites were predicted using the PrePS prenylation
prediction suite [67,68] and putative palmitoylation sites
were identified using the CSS-Palm algorithm [69], with a
cut-off value of 4 [70].
Parasites
L. major (MHOM/JL/80/Friedlin) promastigotes were
grown in modified Eagle's medium (designated complete
HOMEM medium) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated foetal
calf serum at 25°C as described previously [71]. Amastigotes were isolated from mouse lesions as described previously [72].
Cloning and expression of putative Leishmania syntaxin
genes
The genes coding for putative syntaxins were amplified
from L. major DNA using primers in which restriction sites
used for subsequent cloning were incorporated (Table 2,
in bold). The obtained fragments (sizes displayed in Table
2) were cloned into the pNUS-GFPnNeo vector [41],
allowing the in-frame insertion of the gene of interest at
the 3' end of the GFP gene. Different cloning strategies
and restriction sites were used according to the ones
already present in the genes, BglII/KpnI for LmjF29.0070,
BglII/EcoRV for LmjF28.1470, LmjF28.1480, LmjF19.0120
and LmjF32.0070, BglII/XhoI for LmjF33.1340 and KpnI/
EcoRV for LmjF35.2720. The digested fragments were
ligated into the pNUS-GFPnNeo vector previously
digested by the appropriate enzymes. Log phase L. major
promastigotes were transfected with 20 µg of plasmid and
selected with 50 µg/ml of G418. Drug resistant populations were checked by PCR for the presence of the plasmids.
RNA extraction and mapping of 5'-end using RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from ~108 promastigotes or
amastigotes by the phenol-chloroform-guanidine isothiocyanate method using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer.

Specific primers used to amplify the specified L. major genes to give products of which the sizes are indicated on the right. Restriction sites used for
cloning are in bold.

Samples were then subsequently treated with RQ1 RNasefree DNase (Promega) to remove any contaminating
DNA. After a phenol-chloroform extraction, RNA was precipitated and 5 µg used to synthesise first strand of cDNA
with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth of the
final material was used as a template for separate PCR
reactions using an upper strand splice-leader primer
(OL1760, Table 3) and specific 3' reverse primers for the
seven L. major Qa genes (see Additional file 2). 1% of each
reaction was used as a template for a round of semi
nested-PCR amplification using internal primers: spliceleader oligonucleotide (OL1760) was still used as the 5'
primer, together with specific internal 3' reverse primers
for the genes (Table 3). Products of both series of reactions were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and fragments
from selected genes were, once excised from the gel,
cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), allowing them
to be sequenced to precisely map the 5' trans-splicing
acceptor sites.

Fluorescent staining of cells
107 L. major promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in serum-free HOMEM. For FM4-64
labelling, the cells were incubated with 40 µM of FM4-64
(from a 12 mM stock solution in DMSO; Invitrogen) for
15 min at 4°C and then washed in fresh medium and
incubated for various times at 25°C. Cells were then
washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and processed for microscopy.

For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were processed as
described previously [73]. Briefly, after fixation, the solution was adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for
10 min; glycine (0.1 M) was added for 10 min. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in PBS and allowed
to dry onto glass slides. Primary antibodies were incubated at the appropriate dilution (1/200 for mouse antiLmLCB2 [49], 1/2000 for rabbit anti-TbRab1 [44], 1/1000
for rabbit anti-TbV-H+-PP [45], 1/500 for rabbit antiLdPFK [46]) in PBS with 0.1% BSA for 30 min, followed

by three washes in PBS and subsequent incubation with
fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells
were viewed with a Zeiss UV microscope and images were
captured by an Orca-ER camera (Hammamatsu) and
Openlab software v 4.0.3 (Improvision). The "volume
deconvolution" module from Openlab was used to
remove background staining when using the anti-TbRab1
antibody.
