Abstract
Background: The imprint of natural selection on gene sequences is often difficult to detect. A
plethora of methods have been devised to detect genetic changes due to selective processes.
However, many of those methods depend heavily on underlying assumptions regarding the mode
of change of DNA sequences and often require sophisticated mathematical treatments that made
them computationally slow. The development of fast and effective methods to detect modifications
in the selective constraints of genes is therefore of great interest.
Results: We describe UVPAR, a program designed to quickly test for changes in the functional
constraints of duplicate genes. Starting with alignments of the proteins encoded by couples of
duplicate genes in two different species, UVPAR detects the regions in which modifications of the
functional constraints in the paralogs occurred since both species diverged. Sequences can be
analyzed with UVPAR in just a few minutes on a standard PC computer. To demonstrate the power
of the program, we first show how the results obtained with UVPAR compare to those based on
other approaches, using data for vertebrate Hox genes. We then describe a comprehensive study
of the RBR family of ubiquitin ligases in which we have performed 529 analyses involving 14
duplicate genes in seven model species. A significant increase in the number of functional shifts was
observed for the species Danio rerio and for the gene Ariadne-2.
Conclusion: These results show that UVPAR can be used to generate sensitive analyses to detect
changes in the selection constraints acting on paralogs. The high speed of the program allows its
application to genome-scale analyses.

Background
A major problem in biology is how to convert the data
provided by DNA or protein sequences into functional
information. For this reason, a significant fraction of
molecular evolution studies are focused on the statistical
characterization of the patterns of change of DNA or protein sequences. They are based on the general idea that

modifications in the function of a gene are often related to
changes in the selective regime acting on it, in such a way
that a characteristic imprint is generated in its sequence.
For example, if a gene is modifying its function by a process that involves positive selection, we would expect to
find very rapid changes in the amino acid sequence of the
encoded protein, at a rate much higher than expected

under neutral evolution. On the contrary, if regions of a
gene become functionally constrained, under negative
selection, change in those regions will be very slow [1].
Different methods have been proposed to determine how
selection acts on biological sequences (reviewed in [2,3]).
Several of them have been devised to compare the synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) rates of change in
coding regions, often with the purpose of testing whether
positive selection has been acting upon those regions [46]. However, relative values of Ka/Ks > 1, that are strong
evidence for positive selection – being higher than the
expected rates under the null hypothesis of neutral evolution (Ka/Ks = 1) – are rarely found. Most frequently, it is
determined that sequences are under strong negative
selection. For example, in a recent work in which 4706
orthologous genes were compared in human and mouse,
it was estimated that, in average, Ka/Ks = 0.107 [7]. Other
methods are focused on non-synonymous changes alone,
and try to model whether amino acid changes occur
homogeneously or, alternatively, are concentrated on particular positions or regions of the proteins [2]. Several
other methods have been proposed to explore whether
the rates of change of genes vary among different lineages,
especially among species or groups of species [8,9]. Specific tools devised to analyze functional divergence
between duplicate genes have been also developed [1013]. This is due to the fact that functional shifts occur
especially often in association with gene duplication
events. Either by acquisition of new functions by one of
the duplicates (neofunctionalization) or by division of
the functions of the original gene between the two paralogs (subfunctionalization), duplication is often expected
to radically alter the selective forces acting on the duplicate genes [14].
However, most of the approaches developed so far have
some serious limitations. First, many of them are computationally cumbersome. Authors often have to choose
between using the simplest tools available, that are relatively insensitive, or performing more precise analyses,
but with a limited number of genes. A second problem is
that many of the methods devised are based on complex
mathematical models of how DNA sequences change, and
it is often unknown how deviations from the assumptions
implicit in those models may affect the conclusions
obtained. In fact, there are considerable discussions in the
literature on whether certain types of analyses tend to generate spurious significant results [e. g. refs. 15–20]. Therefore, there is a general need for tools that combine the
features of being intuitive (i. e. with simple and reasonable underlying assumptions), fast and also sufficiently
sensitive.

In this study, we describe a new bioinformatic tool, called
UVPAR, which may be used to detect regional changes in
constraints in the protein sequences of duplicate genes.
The UVPAR algorithm is a substantial refinement of an
analytical strategy devised before by one of us and already
successfully used for characterizing ancient functional
changes in a family of ATPases/ATP synthases [13]. The
basis of that strategy is to determine, combining slidingwindow analyses of the degree of amino acidic conservation and permutation tests, the regions of duplicate genes
that have evolved at different rates in two species.
In its current implementation, UVPAR allows for the fully
automatic analysis of a large number of protein sequences
in a short period of time. As examples of its potential, we
show the results of two analyses. First, we performed
UVPAR comparisons for Hox7 duplicate genes in six vertebrate species. We demonstrated that some Hox7 genes suffered in the past positively selected changes in their
sequences associated to functional shifts after gene duplication events [21]. Here, we compare these previous
results with the ones obtained with UVPAR in order to
establish how our novel method relates to other
approaches. As a second example, we generated a comprehensive study of the RBR gene family [22-24] that involves
several hundreds of analyses, to show how the program
can be used at a large scale. In summary, UVPAR is a useful
novel tool for studies focused on the characterization of
functional shifts in proteins, most especially in cases in
which the genes of interest are part of complex gene families.

Implementation
Let us consider the case in which the phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of certain genes has established that a
duplication occurred, generating two paralogous genes,
before two lineages of organisms split (Figure 1A, left).
After both lineages became separated, the two genes accumulated differences until the present day (Figure 1A,
right). The question that we want to tackle is whether
sequence changes have accumulated differently in those
genes in both lineages since their separation. This often
can be visualized as a difference in rates in one or several
of the genes in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1B). UVPAR is
a program specialized in analyzing these situations. It
takes into account the previous knowledge of orthology/
paralogy generated by these phylogenetic analyses. Moreover, UVPAR analyses are based on the multiple-sequence
alignments used to generate the phylogenetic trees.
UVPAR is written in C and we have compiled versions for
Windows and Linux operating systems. In its simplest
implementation, the program uses as input a text file containing the sequences of the proteins encoded by four
genes – two duplicate genes in two different species, such

value, C(k)12 = Blk1 - Blk2 [13]. C(k)12 is thus a value
obtained for "gene quartets", defined as pairs of duplicates in two different species.

as A1, B1, A2 and B2 in Figure 1 – in Fasta format. However,
the program also accepts larger datasets, in which pairs of
duplicates of multiple species are included in a single text
file. In this case, the program automatically performs
analyses for all the possible combinations of species in the
dataset. The program interprets the sequences in the text
file as the output of a multiple-sequence alignment (i. e.
the amino acid in position k in each sequence refers to a
characteristic residue, common for all proteins). Once
imported, the dataset is filtered, in such a way that positions in which gaps are present are eliminated from all the
sequences. The program then detects the sequence with
smallest size (N) and from then on, all the analyses are
performed with the first N amino acidic positions of each
sequence. After these two filters, UVPAR progressively
reads the sequences of the first two proteins (i. e. the
duplicates in the first species such as A1 and B1 in Figure 1)
and calculates a value of similarity for each amino acid
position of the two sequences, Blk1, according to a given
amino acid substitution matrix. The user may choose
among the following matrices: Pam30, Pam70, Pam250,
Blosum45, Blosum62 and Blosum90. Blosum62 is the
one that we use by default. Then it does the same for the
two duplicates of the second species and calculates a sim-

If both duplicates are equally different in the two species,
the constraint value should be about zero for all the positions. The key of the strategy implemented in UVPAR is to
analyze the distribution of C(k)12 values observed to
determine whether some positive or negative values are
significantly clustered together. To do so, the vector of
C(k)12 values is randomly shuffled a number T of times
(according to the algorithm described by Weir [25], p.
386) and the shuffled vectors are compared with the one
determined for the real paralogs. The comparison is performed for windows of increasing size (w), from w = 2 to
w = N - 1. For each window size, the maximum and minimum sums of C(k)12 values, that we call S(k, w), are
determined for both the original and the shuffled
sequences. Then, UVPAR compares the maximum and
minimum sum in the original sequence with those in the
set of shuffled sequences. This set provides a distribution
of maximum (or minimum) values against which the values obtained in the real sequence is contrasted. Two
hypotheses must be tested for each window size (the first
referred to maximum values, the second to minimum values), and therefore it is convenient to use Bonferroni's
correction. Thus, when the value in the original sequence
is found beyond the top or bottom 2.5 % of the values of
the simulated sequences, it is considered significant and
UVPAR selects the corresponding window for further
analyses.
The second part of the analysis performed by UVPAR is
the comparison of all significant windows for a given gene
quartet. UVPAR often detects multiple windows of different sizes that are significant. In many cases those windows
are nested and therefore they refer in part to the same
positions in the analyzed sequences. The biological interpretation of the significant results requires establishing
the windows that best explain the detected constraint
changes. This problem can be tackled in different ways. In
our previous study [13], we solved the problem of nested
windows in the simplest way, just choosing the window
with the largest (or smallest, for windows of negative sign)
value of S(k, w) and discarding the rest. This approach was
appropriate for the particular cases analyzed in that study,
but it has been determined to be insufficient for complex
cases found in our subsequent analyses. This is due to two
reasons. First, we have found that ties in the S(k, w) values
often appear in significant windows of different sizes. Second, we have found significant partially overlapping windows, a case that was never detected before. Therefore, in
UVPAR we have implemented a much more precise way

Page 3 of 12

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:174

of dealing with multiple significant windows of different
sizes. This is a major improvement on the strategy
described on our previously published work
The method is as follows: the program separates the significant windows into two groups, corresponding to those
significant in the analyses involving minimum values and
those derived from the analyses of maximum values.
Within each group, windows are ordered according to
their sizes. The program then compares, for one of those
two groups, all the significant windows, starting with the
smallest one and moving progressively to larger windows.
Every time that a window contained in a larger one is
found that has an absolute S(k, w) value equal or higher
than that in the larger window, the latter is eliminated.
When this process has finished, the program performs the
same search for all the significant windows in the other
group. The goal of this iterative screening is to eliminate
all the large windows that are significant simply because
they contain a small highly deviant region. For example,
we found cases in which short regions had such positive
C(k)12 values that even when negative values were added,
the larger windows that contains both the highly positive
"seed" and the additional negative values were still significantly positive. Those larger windows are eliminated after
the comparisons described.
At the end of this first screening, we are left with all the
nested significant windows in which an increase of length
is associated with an increase of absolute S(k, w) value
plus all non-nested windows. Then, UVPAR performs a
second screening with the remaining windows, this time
starting with the largest significant window and comparing it with all the smaller ones. Now, all windows contained in a larger one and at the same time with absolute
S(k, w) value lower than that found in the larger window
are eliminated. The program keeps repeating this search
until all windows of both groups (minimum and maximum) have been analyzed. This second screening allows
the elimination of all windows that can be extended to
larger ones. Logically, the larger windows have to be preferred if their S(k, w) values are higher. After these two
screenings, we are left with sets of non-nested significant
windows, that may or may not partially overlap. As a final
step, UVPAR analyzes all the remaining windows and
eliminates those with an absolute average C(k) value –
obtained by dividing the absolute S(k, w) value by the
window size – lower than 0.1. This last step is devised to
eliminate a perverse effect that occurs in rare cases in
which a few highly positive or negative C(k)12 values are
clustered together in one of the extremes of the vector.
Then, it occasionally occurs that this region not only produces, as expected, a small highly significant window of a
particular sign, but also generates a very large complementary window of the opposite sign that often spans the rest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/174

of the sequences. This happens even when the C(k)12 values outside of the short significant region are randomly
distributed around zero or, more often, are almost all of
them zero. The few cases that we have found in which this
effect was present were eliminated when the 0.1 cutoff
value was used, and therefore we have considered it to be
a logical last filter to be implemented by default in the
UVPAR algorithm.
After all the searches are finished, the program generates
an output file that details all the relevant parameters: 1)
the number of times (T) that the sequences have been
shuffled to generate the distribution of S(k, w) values; 2)
the sequences analyzed; 3) the detailed amino acidic
alignment, with all the corresponding C(k)12 values; 4) all
the significant windows, before the filtering process; and,
5) all the significant windows, after the filtering process is
completed.
Thus, the algorithm can be summarized quite simply as
follows:
Import file with the number of pairs of duplicates to be
analyzed and corresponding sequences in Fasta format
Read T value
Filter sequences to eliminate gaps, estimate final size N
Repeat (for each gene quartet)
Calculate C(k)12 values
If (C(k)12 == 0 for all k) then skip gene quartet
Else:
For (each window size) from w = 2 to w = N -1
Estimate maximum, minimum S(k, w) values for
the original sequences
Shuffle C(k)12 values, T times
Generate distribution of maximum, minimum S(k,
w) values from the shuffled sequences
Compare maximum, minimum S(k, w) values for
the original and the shuffled sequences, select windows
according to a significance level p < 2.5 %
Filter significant windows, increasing size
Filter significant windows, decreasing size

Simulations to determine the reliability and sensitivity of
UVPAR searches
To check for the number of false positives and false negative results generated by UVPAR under different conditions, we explored, using simulations, a tree containing
four species, with two paralogs each (details in Figure 2).
We used CovTree [26] to apply different changes in the
rates of a particular region of one of the paralogs in the
branch previous to the split between two of the species
(species 1 and 2 in Figure 2). Then, we used UVPAR to

Results
Speed and performance
The software that we used in our original study was very
slow, what precluded both to use large T values and the
analysis of large datasets. Due to several highly significant
algorithmic improvements, UVPAR is about 104 times
faster. This makes possible to perform the same searches
several times and with different T values to determine the
degree of error associated to each number of permutation
tests. When we checked for the impact of T values, we
determined that to obtain a reasonably precise estimation
of the probability associated to a particular value in the
distribution of shuffled S(k, w) values, it is convenient to
choose values of T larger than 103, which we previously
used due to computational limitations. We have fully
repeated the analyses presented in [13] using UVPAR and,
although all the conclusions of the work are correct, we
have found that the error associated to the estimation of p
values with T = 103 was considerable (about ± 0.5 %).
UVPAR analyses are fast enough as to easily handle values
of T = 104, which we consider now to be the minimum
number of permutation tests to be used in this type of
studies. If the sequences are short enough,T may be
increased to 105 or even 106. As examples, using T = 104
and a standard PC computer (Intel Pentium IV 2.8 GHz
processor with 1 GB RAM memory), sequence quartets of
150 amino acids can be analyzed in about 16 seconds,
quartets of 500 amino acids in about 6 minutes and quartets of long sequences of 1000 amino acids in about 26
minutes. Time only vary slightly depending on the
number of significant windows found. These results mean
that UVPAR can be used at a large scale. As an example,
the analysis of a whole family of proteins that we will
detail in section 4.3, that involved more than 500 individual UVPAR searches (protein length = 142 amino acids, T
= 105) required a computation time of only 22 hours,
about 2.5 minutes per analysis.

search for coherent significant windows, i. e. windows
that included at least part of the region in which the rate
shifts were applied and that were present in all the four
comparisons in which we would expect to find significant
results after the rate shifts (species 1 vs. species 3; species
1 vs. species 4; species 2 vs. species 3; and species 2 vs. species 4). Simulations were performed using sequences with
different degrees of heterogeneity of evolutionary rates
among sites. Heterogeneity was modeled as a gamma distribution with a variable α parameter. Values of α from
0.2 (highly heterogeneous rates among amino acids) to α
= 3 (highly homogeneous rates) were used, to cover the
range of results detected for real proteins [ref. [27]; the
average α detected in that study was 0.71]. Results are
shown in Table 1 for windows of size w = 5 (i. e. at least
10% of the size of the modified region; these are about
95% of the significant windows found in the simulations). We found only 2 – 3% of cases in which coherent
windows are present in the control simulations (in which
no rate shift was applied) no matter the value of α. When
the rate of evolution for the region of interest is increased,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/174

more cases are detected, and an increase in the average
C(k)12 is also observed. If rates are increased ten times and
α values are relatively large (α ≥ 0.7), coherent windows
are detected in 35% to 55% of the cases (Table 1). Negative results in these simulations are caused by random
changes that obscure the effect of the rate increase. Very
low α values (α = 0.2) in general precluded the detection
of regional shifts by UVPAR. These results suggest that, in
cases in which multiple sequences can be analyzed, systematic positive UVPAR results most likely will correspond to real regional changes. They also indicate that
UVPAR losses sensitivity when α values are very small and
that the program does not detect small shifts in evolutionary rates; changes must be strong to generate a significant
signal for UVPAR analyses.
Functional shifts in Hox7 genes
Hox genes are critical in many basic developmental processes, most especially in the determination of cell fates
along the anterior-posterior body axis [28,29]. Vertebrates
have a large number of Hox genes, generated by gene and
genome duplications [30-32]. In a previous work, we
showed that episodes of positive selection affected Hox7
genes in vertebrate species [21]. More precisely, we determined that both the ancestral duplication that gave rise to
the paralogous Hox-a7 and Hox-b7 genes and the tetraploidization that occurred in the amphibian lineage that
includes the model species Xenopus laevis radically altered
the selective regime acting on those genes. In the first case,
the duplication was followed by a period of time in which
Hox-a7 genes diversified under positive selection. In the
second case, one of the Hox-b7 genes that were produced
in the Xenopus ancestor by the genome duplication process (called Hox-b7b) also changed under positive selection. The ratios of non-synonymous vs. synonymous
substitutions in the branches affected by those two selective shifts were estimated to be about eight to ten times

larger that the average ratio for the rest of branches of the
tree [21]. Three distinct types of analyses suggested that
positive selection acted on the regulatory N-terminal
region of the HOX7 proteins, while the highly conserved
homeodomain was not affected [21].
The large shift in evolutionary rates and the relative high
values of α for these sequences (α = 0.65 for the whole
sequences, and α = 1.92 for the N-terminal region; data
calculated according to [33]) mean that this is a favorable
case to test whether UVPAR is able to generate results
comparable to those found with more complex methods.
Figure 3 shows the results for UVPAR analyses (T = 105)
for the six vertebrates in which both duplicates, Hox-a7
and Hox-b7, were analyzed in our previous work (Xenopus laevis, Gallus gallus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Papio hamadryas and Homo sapiens). Alignments
were the same used in [21]. UVPAR results are congruent
with two of the main conclusions of our previous work.
First, comparisons involving the Xenopus Hoxb7-b gene
showed significant shifts when compared with Hox7
genes of other vertebrates in 4 out of 5 comparisons (Figure 3). The exception, the comparison involving Mus
musculus, is mainly due to a few homoplastic residues in
the Mus musculus Hoxb7 sequence which preclude the
overall values to become significant. Second, all significant windows were found outside of the homeodomain
(see scheme for the proteins in Figure 3, top). It must be
noted that the third main result – the rapid differentiation
after the Hox-a7/Hox-b7 duplication – could not be possibly detected here because that process occurred before
all lineages that can be analyzed with UVPAR became separate. In summary, these UVPAR results agree with our
previous findings and show that UVPAR is able to provide
sensitive evidence for functional shifts comparable to
those obtained by more complex and time-consuming
mathematical approaches.

UVPAR analysis of RBR ubiquitin ligases
We decided to demonstrate the ability of the program to
handle large datasets by analyzing proteins of a family,
called RBR, that we defined some time ago [22]. RBR proteins are ubiquitin ligases with important roles in the control of protein degradation and several of them are known
to be involved in human diseases (reviewed in [23]). RBR
proteins are characterized by having the RBR supradomain, that is composed by two RING fingers (RING1 and
RING2; although RING2 is actually quite different from a
canonical RING finger, see [34]) that are separated by an
IBR domain [35].

We checked for modifications in the functional constraints by analyzing the RBR supradomain of multiple
RBR proteins in several model organisms. We took advantage of the recent completion by our group of a comprehensive analysis in which we generated protein
alignments for 347 RBR proteins and phylogenetic trees
that allowed us to determine the orthology/paralogy relationships for all members of the family [24]. From that
analysis, we selected all the available sequences for 14
RBR genes (ARI1, ARI2, ANKIB1, Parc, Paul, IBRDC1, Parkin, XAP3, RNF144, IBRDC2, Dorfin, IBRDC3, ARA54 and
Triad3, according to their human nomenclature) in seven
model organisms (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Ciona intestinalis, Danio rerio, Gallus gallus, Mus
musculus and Homo sapiens). The estimated average value
of α for these sequences is 1.08. Therefore sites evolve
homogeneously enough for UVPAR analyses. We took
into account that not all the genes are present in all the
species analyzed (e. g. some are vertebrate-specific), and
some of the genes had species-specific duplications. Once
these peculiarities were sorted out, we performed all the
possible combinations of gene quartets for the seven species. A total of 529 analyses were generated. In 138 cases
(26.1 %), we found significant results. They are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, according to, respectively, the species and genes involved (see details in [Additional file 1]).
Table 2 shows that a single species, the fish Danio rerio,
present a number of significant results that are well above
the average found for the set of species. We think that,
similarly to what occurred for the Xenopus Hox7 genes
shown above, this may be related to the genome duplication that happened in the evolutionary lineage in which
Danio emerged [36]. If we compare the data for the different RBR genes (Table 3), we observe that the significant
cases appear quite homogeneously. ARI2 is the only gene
with a number of significant results that is in average
higher than that of the rest of RBRs. This is in part
explained by the large number of analyses (15 out of 20)
in which the ARI1/ARI2 comparisons were significant.
Figure 4 shows the results for those comparisons. It
becomes evident examining this figure that many of the
positive results are correlated. In Drosophila melanogaster

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/174

there are two ARI1 genes, ari-1a and ari-1b (the slightly
different gene nomenclature is the official one for Drosophila genes). Significant shifts in the IBR domain are
observed between the pair ari-1a/ari-2 of Drosophila melanogaster and the ARI1/ARI2 genes of all vertebrate species.
Also, we see important changes along the whole RBR
supradomain when genes of the urochordate Ciona intestinalis are compared with vertebrate genes. Therefore all
these results can be explained by a few major changes in
particular evolutionary lineages. In favorable cases, we
can establish in which lineage the changes must have
occurred. For example, considering that D. melanogaster/
vertebrate comparisons involving the D. melanogaster ari1b gene are in general non-significant, we can conclude
that a functional shift in the IBR domain of the D. melanogaster ari-1a gene occurred since the ari1-a/ari1-b duplication that has made ari-1a different from their vertebrate
orthologs. In summary, the results shown in Figure 4 suggests that functional diversification between the RBR
supradomains of the ARI1 and ARI2 genes has occurred
just a few times and that those changes most frequently
affected the RING1 and IBR domains. This result points
towards an important role of the N-terminal domains of
the RBR supradomain in acquisition of novel functional
properties in some species, perhaps to act on new ubiquitination substrates, while the non-canonical RING2
would be less significant.
In Figure 5, we show the distribution of maximum and
minimum values in the shuffled sequences and the relative position in this distribution for one of the significant
values observed. Bell shaped, quasi-symmetrical distributions as those shown in that figure are common. They correspond to the typical extreme value distributions that are
expected for large T and w values ([37], p. 151). We have
however observed in some cases highly asymmetrical distributions, often with multiple peaks, when window sizes
are small.

Discussion
We have shown that the UVPAR program to may be used
to quickly detect modifications in the functional constraints of duplicate genes. Favorable circumstances for
the program are a reasonably homogenous rate of amino
acid substitution among sites and an intense change in the
selective regime acting on one of the paralogs. Considering that under positive selection Ka/Ks > 1 while in real
proteins, the average value is much lower (e. g. Ka/Ks =
0.107 for the large sample of human/mouse comparisons
already mentioned [7]), we may expect UVPAR to be particularly useful to detect positive selection, most especially
associated to functional shifts after gene duplication. In
respect to other related methods, that often rely on debatable a priori assumptions and difficult mathematical calculations, UVPAR results are easy to obtain and highly

intuitive. UVPAR analyses depend on just two a priori suppositions. First, that protein changes can be measured
with a matrix such as Blosum62. Second, that the shifts
affect contiguous amino acids, i. e. regions of the proteins,
and therefore they can be detected by examining their primary sequences, using a sliding-window approach. There
is strong evidence that regional shifts in proteins
sequences often occur, in genome-scale analyses [38].
UVPAR advantages are most obvious when the goal is to
quickly explore, across many species, complex gene families that include several duplicate genes. This is clearly
shown by the analysis of the RBR family described above.
We have also demonstrated that general conclusions
about what genes or species are more prone to suffer functional shifts can be deduced from the comprehensive
study of gene families (Tables 2 and 3). The fact that many
genes can be examined in a very short time opens up the

possibility of performing genome-scale studies, impossible to generate with any other related method.
An obvious statistical problem is that, when a large
number of quartets are examined with UVPAR tests, the
quite permissive significance level used (5%) is expected
to generate a number of false positive results. Our experience, as well as the simulations shown above, suggests
examining three aspects of the data to obtain conclusions
not affected by that problem. These three aspect are: 1)
The significance level of each positive result and the average value of C(k)12 for the significant windows. In our
simulations, false positive windows have low average
C(k)12 values (Table 1). If it is deemed necessary, the analyses can be made more strict by either changing the significance level or by increasing the conventional cutoff value
C(k)12 > |0.1|; 2) The logic in structural or functional

terms of the results obtained (e. g. to observe whether they
refer to known domains of a protein, regions in close
proximity in its three-dimensional structure, etc.); and, 3)
The systematic consistency of the results for multiple species. In our opinion, internal consistency of the data is a
particularly useful way to filter the data for real positives.
This is clearly observed in our simulations, in which we
checked for the consistency of UVPAR results for multiple
analyses, finding that false positive coherent results are
rare (2 – 3% under the conditions tested). Thus, when it
is found, as we have shown for the ARI1/ARI2 data (Figure
4), that the genes of multiple species of a lineage (e. g. vertebrates such as fishes, birds and mammals) generate the
same results when compared with genes of an outgroup
species (Drosophila, Ciona), it is good evidence for a real
shift to have occurred. This means that UVPAR finds several times the same imprint even although the analyzed
sequences are considerably distinct. After all, orthologous
genes of fishes, birds and mammals are separated by hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution.
The combination of UVPAR results for multiple species
may be often used to trace with precision the moment and
the lineage in which a change in functional constraints
occurred. In this study, we have shown that the duplication of Hox7 genes in Xenopus laevis and of ari-1 genes in
Drosophila melanogaster were associated with modifications in the constraints of at least one of the duplicates.
These conclusions can be easily deduced when the data
are presented in a favorable format, as that shown in Figures 3 and 4. Our approach may thus complement other

analytical methods devised to detect selective processes
acting on particular branches of a phylogenetic tree
[8,9,21].

Conclusion
UVPAR generates very fast and still sensitive information
about modifications of the selective constraints in duplicate genes. It can be used at a large scale, to analyze complex gene families in multiple species. Its speed, simplicity
of use and also the fact that its mathematical assumptions
are very intuitive makes UVPAR an excellent tool for all
groups interested in analyzing the impact of natural selection on gene sequences, especially at a genomic scale.
