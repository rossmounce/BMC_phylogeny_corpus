Abstract
Background: Cytochrome P450 enzymes play critical roles in fungal biology and ecology. To
support studies on the roles and evolution of cytochrome P450 enzymes in fungi based on rapidly
accumulating genome sequences from diverse fungal species, an efficient bioinformatics platform
specialized for this super family of proteins is highly desirable.
Results: The Fungal Cytochrome P450 Database (FCPD) archives genes encoding P450s in the
genomes of 66 fungal and 4 oomycete species (4,538 in total) and supports analyses of their
sequences, chromosomal distribution pattern, and evolutionary histories and relationships. The
archived P450s were classified into 16 classes based on InterPro terms and clustered into 141
groups using tribe-MCL. The proportion of P450s in the total proteome and class distribution in
individual species exhibited certain taxon-specific characteristics.
Conclusion: The FCPD will facilitate systematic identification and multifaceted analyses of P450s
at multiple taxon levels via the web. All data and functions are available at the web site http://
p450.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/.

Background
Cytochrome P450 is the collective name for a super family
of heme-containing monooxygenases. P450 enzymes not
only participate in the production of diverse metabolites
but also play critical roles in organism's adaptation to specific ecological and/or nutritional niches by modifying
potentially harmful environmental chemicals. In fungi,
P450 enzymes have contributed to exploration of and
adaptation to diverse ecological niches [1,2].

Rapidly accumulating genome sequences from diverse
fungal species, including more than 80 species with more
currently being sequenced [3], offer opportunities to
study the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms underpinning different fungal life styles at the genome level [47]. To support such studies with the focus on cytochrome
P450s, we constructed a new platform named as the Fungal Cytochrome P450 Database (FCPD), which archives
P450s in most sequenced fungal and oomycetes species
and allows comparison of the archived data with previously published datasets, such as the Cytochrome P450

Engineering Database [8], a manually curated P450 database at http://drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450
html (referred as the Nelson's P450 database herein), and
P450 datasets derived from extensive phylogenetic analyses of selected fungal taxon groups [9,10]. The FCPD also
supports multifaceted analyses of P450s using various
web-based bioinformatics tools supported by the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP; http://
cfgp.snu.ac.kr/) [3]. The FCPD, in combination with highthroughput experimental approaches, will advance our
understanding of the roles and evolution of P450s.

Construction and content
Pipeline for identifying and classifying fungal P450s
To identify P450 proteins from genome sequences, standardized genome databases managed by CFGP (http://
cfgp.snu.ac.kr/) [3] and annotated information of each
ORF by InterPro scan [11] were used. The pipeline for the
identification and archiving of P450s consists of four
steps (Figure 1). In the first step, all proteins carrying one
or more of 16 InterPro terms associated with cytochrome
P450 were identified and classified according to associated InterPro terms. Domain information of P450 proteins was also retrieved from the InterPro scan results. To
filter out potential false positives (i.e., those carrying a
very short domain), the minimum length for IPR001128
(Cytochrome P450) was set at 25 amino acid (aa). Since
some of these potential false positives might indeed
belong to novel P450s, rather than discarding them, they
were labelled as "questionable P450" in FCPD. Secondly,
using the collection of putative P450 sequences, cache
tables, especially for results from several statistical analyses, were created to speed up data retrieval. BLAST datasets
were also generated to support BLAST searches of P450s
via the FCPD web site and cluster analysis. Thirdly, classspecific and cluster-specific neighbour joining phylogenetic trees that show relationships among P450s within
individual phylogenetic groups (e.g., Figure 2) were constructed (bootstrapped with 2,000 or 10,000 repeats),
which are displayed by Phyloviewer (http://www.phy
loviewer.org/; Park et al., unpublished) on the FCPD web
site. Using the BLAST dataset, fungal P450s were clustered
using tribe-MCL [12], and compared with the data in
three publicly available databases: the Cytochrome P450
Engineering database [8], the Nelson's P450 database,
and a set of phylogenetically analyzed P450s in multiple
fungal species [9,10]. Results from this comparison were
stored in the FCPD for viewing via the FCPD web site. For
species with multiple versions of genome annotation,
data generated using different versions were linked to provide the history of annotation.

As the fourth step, using BLAST all P450s archived in
FCPD were matched to the corresponding families in the
Nelson's P450s database, which contains manually

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/402

curated data based on the P450 International Nomenclature [13,14]. For each P450, the assigned family name was
considered highly confident ('> = 44% identity' in the
site), when the degree of aa sequence identity was 44% or
higher. When no match at that level could be found in the
Nelson's P450 database, the best hit in BLAST search was
chosen to assign the family name and labelled as low confidence ('< 44% identity' in the site). Considering that
P450s are very diverse and that the Nelson's P450 database covers less fungal species than FCPD, it is highly
likely that some of the P450s with low confidence represent novel families that have yet to be registered in the
Nelson's P450 database (Figure 3). This annotation result
was stored in FCPD and can be viewed through the FCPD
web site.
In the genomes of 66 fungal and 4 oomycete species,
4,538 putative P450 genes were identified. Although
oomycete species belong to the kingdom Stramenophila
and show closer phylogenetic relationships to brown
algae and diatoms [15], they have been traditionally studied by mycologists due to their morphological similarities
with true fungi, and their P450s were included in FCPD.
Evaluation of the accuracy of annotation via the
automated pipeline in FCPD by comparing with data
archived in the manually curated Nelson's P450s database
The automated annotation process of P450 in FCPD may
result in some false-positives and negatives. To evaluate its
accuracy, all 886 P450s identified using the pipeline in 12
fungal species were compared with manually curated data
in the Nelson's P450 database. The positive predictive
value (PPV; the proportion of the predicted P450s in
FCPD to P450s that have been archived in the Nelson's
P450 database) was 0.894 (792 out of 886 P450s in FCPD
were matched to P450s in Nelson's P450 database). Some
putative false positives in FCPD appeared to be pseudo
genes. Another factor that contributed to the discrepancy
between the two sources is that some data in the Nelson's
P450 database were based on a version earlier than what
was used for FCPD (e.g., version 4 of Magnaporthe oryzae
genome having been used for the former, while FCPD
being based on version 5). Gene prediction models
employed to analyze different versions might have had
different predictions. In contrast, 1,032 out of 1,034 fungal P450s curated in the Nelson's P450 database were
identified as P450 by the FCPD pipeline (99.8% sensitivity), supporting the reliability of the FCPD pipeline. The
two P450s not identified as P450 by FCPD came from
Phytophthora sojae and P. ramorum, respectively and corresponded to truncated sequences (34 and 89 aa, respectively, and were labelled as fragment of P450 in the
Nelson's P450 database). Detailed analyses of the underlying reasons for the inconsistency between the two

pipeline of FCPD.
Notable features in fungal P450s in the taxonomic context
The numbers of P450s in individual species exhibited certain taxon-specific features (Table 1). Within the phylum
Ascomycota, members of the subphylum Pezizomycotina
typically carry around 100 P450s with the exception of
four species (Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum,

Uncinocarpus reessi and Neurospora crassa) that only carry
22 to 46 P450s. The proportion of P450s in the total proteome in the subphylum Pezizomycotina (0.63% in average) is twice as large as that of vertebrates (0.33%) but is
less than that of plant species (0.82%). In contrast to the
Pezizomycotina, species in the subphyla Saccharomycotina and Taphrinomycotina have a very few P450s (e.g.,
only 3 P450s in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 2 P450s in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Within the phylum Basidio-

mycota, Postia placenta carries 353 P450s (2.06% of the
total proteome), while strains of Cryptococcus neoformans
have 5 to 6 P450s (0.08% ~ 0.09% of the total proteome).
Interestingly, Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Antonospora
locustae, species in the phylum Mycosporodia, do not
appear to have any P450s, probably reflecting their obligate, intracellular parasitic life style. Four oomycete species, including Phytophthora infestans, P. sojae, P. ramorum
and Hyaloperonospora parasitica, also carry relatively low
numbers of P450s (9 to 35 and 0.06 to 0.2% of the total
proteome).
Three P450 classes defined by InterPro terms, including
group I in E-class P450, group IV in E-class P450 and
Cytochrome P450, contain 3,866 out of 4,538 (85.2%)
fungal/oomycete P450s. Only 8 out of 16 classes have
fungal/oomycete P450s. Among other classes, P450s
belonging to the pisatin demethylase (PDA)-like class are
present only in the subphylum Pezizomycotina (phylum

Ascomycota) and in the phylum Basidiomycota, suggesting the possibility that PDA-related P450s might have
emerged twice independently during fungal evolution.
Distribution patterns of fungal P450s among clusters and
clans
When fungal/oomycetes P450s were combined with
5,447 P450s extracted from 40 other eukaryotic and
prokaryotic species and clustered using tribe-MCL (with
inflation factor of 5.0; the most strict condition for clustering based on sequence similarity), 141 clusters were identified. Among these, 74 clusters contain only fungal
P450s, suggesting that many fungal P450s have a configuration unique to fungi. The taxonomic origins of fungal
P450s in the 26 clusters that contain more than 10 fungal
P450s were analyzed (Figure 4). P450s in the phylum
Ascomycota are dominant because of abundant genome
sequences from members of this group. Cluster 19.1 is
dominated by P450s encoded members of the subphylum

to specific families with high confidence, while 1,468
P450s (33.02%) were assigned to families with low confidence (Figure 3). In the phylum Ascomycota, the assignment of 1,007 P450s (29.24%) was supported with low
confidence. In the phylum Basidiomycota, the proportion
was 44.56% (352 out of 790 P450s). More than 90%
P450s (104 out of 110) in the phylum Zygomycota and
100% P450s in the phylum Chytridiomycota did not
closely match with any families in the Nelson's P450 database. These results strongly suggest that new fungal families need to be defined.

the number of P450 in each class.

Agricomycotina (phylum Basidiomycota) and Clusters
3.1 and 4.1 are Zygomycota-specific. Cluster 8.1 contains
101 out of 106 oomycetes P450s (95.3%). Nine P450s
encoded by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the only
sequenced species in the phylum Chitridiomycota, are
scattered to 8 clusters, suggesting that they likely have distinct functions and evolutionary origins. Sequences of
additional genomes are needed to further investigate the
evolution of P450s in this phylum.

Update of FCPD
Considering the rapid increase in fungal genome sequencing [3], timely update of FCPD is critical to present the latest information to users. The BLAST dataset, bootstrapped
phylogenetic trees specific for individual classes and clusters, results from clustering analysis and annotation of
P450s based on the international P450 nomenclature will
be updated automatically once new P450s have been
identified via the identification pipeline. Since the identification of P450s depends on the accuracy of a gene model
employed to annotate the genome, as a new version of
previously released genome sequences becomes available,
FCPD will be updated with the data based on earlier versions being tagged as an "Old putative P450 sequences."
Links between new and old versions will be provided.

Utilities and discussion

To compare the relationship between P450 clusters and
clans, 115 clans identified in four species (including 375
P450s in total), including M. oryzae, Fusarium graminearum, N. crassa and Aspergillus nidulans [9], were collected
and analyzed. Interestingly, only 4 out of 115 clans
(6.1%) are scattered to more than one P450 clusters. For
example, P450s included in clan FF59 were distributed to
four P450 clusters (Clusters 4.1, 8.1, 31.1 and 73.1). However, each of the remaining clans belongs to one specific
cluster, supporting a good correlation between two classification systems.

Accessing lists and sequences of fungal P450s based on
species of origin and taxonomic position
To support efficient search and retrieval of sequences of
P450s, data archived in FCPD can be browsed and
searched through multiple methods. Upon selecting a
species of interest, general information about the species
and a list of its P450s can be viewed. From this list, any
P450 sequences can be stored in a personal data repository called the Favorite, in which six useful bioinformatic
tools can be utilized to analyze the stored data. The
Favorite is a virtual space for storing sequences archived in
CFGP [3]. A list of P450s belonging to each class defined
by InterPro terms or cluster can also be displayed. Taxonomical distribution of P450s, resulted from comparison
with data in the Cytochrome P450 Engineering Database
(CYP450ED) [8] and two previous studies on fungal
P450s [9,10], can be browsed. P450 sequences in FCPD
can also be searched by gene name.

Assignment of P450s archived in FCPD to individual P450
families based on the international nomenclature scheme
The Nelson's P450 database classified 1,016 (98.26%) out
of 1,034 fungal/oomycete P450s into 276 P450 families.
Most P450s in FCPD (4,446 out of 4,538; 97.97%) were
matched to corresponding families in the Nelson's P450
database (see above). 2,978 P450s (66.98%) were tagged

BLAST search of all or subsets of P450s
In FCPD, five different databases of P450s, including all
P450s (including those from plants and animals), all fungal/oomycete P450s and three fungal phylum-specific
databases of P450s, can be searched using BLAST. Additionally, fungal P450 sequences in the Nelson's P450
database can also be searched. From BLAST search results,

Analyses of P450s using tools in the Comparative Fungal
Genomics Platform
Many on-line databases that archive gene families allow
downloading of all or part of data to user's computer but
often do not provide data analysis tools via the database
site. Consequently, to conduct desired analyses, users may

have to visit multiple websites to access desired data analysis tools and/or install programs in personal computer.
In FCPD, sequences of one or more fungal P450s can be
selected by clicking check boxes next to each P450 and
stored them into the Favorite. The Object Browser in
FCPD supports the transfer of chosen sequences from the
Favorite to CFGP in which the data can be analyzed using
six useful bioinformatics tools [3]. These tools include
BLAST, ClustalW, InterPro Scan, PSort, SignalP 3.0 and

Distribution pattern of 25 major P450 clusters
Distribution pattern of 25 major P450 clusters. Cluster names are shown below the X-axis, and the names of fungal
phyla are shown at the y-axis. Non-fungi indicate P450s in plants and animals. The Z-axis indicates numbers of P450s in individual groups.

BLASTMatrix. The BLASTMatrix is a novel tool for surveying the presence of genes homologous to a query in multiple species simultaneously. Once any new analysis tool
has been added to CFGP, users of FCPD will be able to use
the tool immediately.
Visualization of chromosomal distribution patterns of
P450s via SNUGB
To aid for the visualization of chromosomal distribution
pattern of P450s for species with available physical chromosome map information, FCPD provides a diagram
illustrating position of P450s on individual chromosomes
(Figure 5), which are drawn by a newly developed
genome browser called SNUGB (http://genome
browser.snu.ac.kr/; Jung et al., submitted). Currently,
chromosomal maps of 13 fungal species are available.

ble fungal and oomycete genomes (65 fungal and 4
oomycete species) through a systematic identification
pipeline. The reliability of the pipeline in retrieving fungal
P450 sequences was evaluated by comparing resulting
data with other established datasets, and the data from
these sources were archived in FCPD for comparison and
search. The pipeline also links annotated information
from different versions of fungal genome sequences.
Numbers of P450s in individual fungal species vary
widely, and fungal specific P450 clusters were found via
clustering analysis. In combination with other bioinformatic platforms, such as CFGP http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/[3],
Phyloviewer (http://www.phyloviewer.org/; Park et al.,
unpublished),
and
SNUGB
(http://genome
browser.snu.ac.kr/; Jung et al., submitted), FCPD provides
a highly integrated platform supporting systematic studies
on fungal P450s.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, FCPD is the most comprehensive database that archives and classifies P450s in publicly availa-

Chromosomal distribution of P450s on the genome of Aspergillus fumigatus. On eight chromosomes of A. fumigatus,
P450s identified in FCPD were displayed as red bars with their names. When mouse cursor moves on each name, a yellowish
label will appear, which provides link to information page of chosen P450. This display is supported by SNUGB http://genomebrowser.snu.ac.kr/.
