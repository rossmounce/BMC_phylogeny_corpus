Abstract
Background: Coronaviruses cause a broad range of diseases in animals and humans. Human
coronavirus (hCoV) NL63 is associated with up to 10% of common colds. Viral plaque assays enable
the characterization of virus infectivity and allow for purifying virus stock solutions. They are
essential for drug screening. Hitherto used cell cultures for hCoV-NL63 show low levels of virus
replication and weak and diffuse cytopathogenic effects. It has not yet been possible to establish
practicable plaque assays for this important human pathogen.
Results: 12 different cell cultures were tested for susceptibility to hCoV-NL63 infection. Human
colon carcinoma cells (CaCo-2) replicated virus more than 100 fold more efficiently than
commonly used African green monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2). CaCo-2 cells showed
cytopathogenic effects 4 days post infection. Avicel, agarose and carboxymethyl-cellulose overlays
proved suitable for plaque assays. Best results were achieved with Avicel, which produced large and
clear plaques from the 4th day of infection. The utility of plaque assays with agrose overlay was
demonstrated for purifying virus, thereby increasing viral infectivity by 1 log 10 PFU/mL.
Conclusion: CaCo-2 cells support hCoV-NL63 better than LLC-MK2 cells and enable
cytopathogenic plaque assays. Avicel overlay is favourable for plaque quantification, and agarose
overlay is preferred for plaque purification. HCoV-NL63 virus stock of increased infectivity will be
beneficial in antiviral screening, animal modelling of disease, and other experimental tasks.

Background
Coronaviruses are large enveloped plus-strand RNA
viruses that are currently classified in three groups or presumptive genera [1-3]. Group 1 is further divided into two
phylogenetic clades exemplified by the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), respectively. The latter clade contains
two prototypic human coronaviruses (hCoV), termed
hCoV-229E and -NL63 [4,5]. Like group 1, group 2 contains mammalian CoV. These include two human patho-

genic prototypes, termed hCoV-OC43 and -HKU1, several
important animal pathogens such as the bovine CoV and
the murine hepatitis virus, as well as the SARS-CoV [6-8].
Group 3 contains foremostly avian CoV [9].
HCoV-229E and OC43 as well as the more recently identified hCoV-HKU1 and – NL63 are major causes of common colds in wintertime [10]. HCoV-NL63 was isolated
in African green monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2) from a
seven month old infant with bronchiolitis and conjunctiPage 1 of 9

vitis [4]. In further investigations the virus was predominantly detected in children with respiratory infections
[11-14]. Up to 10% of children with respiratory disease
yielded hCoV-NL63 [10,11,15-17].
Because of its relatively high prevalence hCoV-NL63 could
become an important model in screening for anti-coronaviral agents [12,18]. Several studies have suggested, e.g.,
that hCoV protease inhibitors would be cross-reactive
among different hCoV [19-21]. Antiviral screening relies
on the detection of replicating virus in cell culture. For this
and other experimental tasks, plaque assays have proven
to be simple in application and efficacious in representing
virus viability.
Plaque assays make use of viscous overlays to cover cells
immediately after infection, thus limiting virus spread
and restricting virus growth to foci of cells at the sites of
initial infection. If virus contributes no or low cytopathic
effects to cells, these foci may be visualized by immunostaining [22,23]. If virus induces strong cytopathogenic
effects (CPE), cells in plaques are lysed and plaques can be
visualized by staining of the residual intact cells.
Cytopathogenic plaque assays are compatible with high
throughput screening [24,25] and facilitate plaque purification and cloning of virus. This in turn is helpful in
obtaining virus stocks of optimized infectivity, e.g., by
decreasing the amount of defective interfering (di) particles that accumulate during serial passaging of CoV [26].
Important technical achievements have been made in
studying NL63 replication, including, most recently, the
development of an infectious cDNA clone [27]. Still it is a
major obstacle that hCoV-NL63 replicates slowly and at

relatively low titres in all current cell cultures, such as LLCMK2 and Vero-B4 cells [4,28,29]. Because the virus contributes very weak and diffuse CPE to these cells, there is
no cytopathic plaque assay available for non-recombinant
virus [28].
Although hCoV-NL63 seems to replicate in the upper and
lower airways, there are many CoV that predominantly
infect the enteric tract, such as TGEV, PEDV, the feline
enteric CoV, and the bovine coronavirus [30,31]. SARSCoV was detected in faecal swabs from SARS patients [32].
SARS-CoV was shown to replicate in colon carcinoma
cells (CaCo-2) [33] that are routinely used for growing
entero- and adeno-, and astroviruses [34]. Interestingly,
SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63 were shown to use the same
receptor for virus entry, the angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) [35].
We show here that CaCo-2 cells are highly susceptible for
hCoV-NL63 infections and that virus propagation in these
cells is much more efficient than in LLC-MK2 cells. By testing different overlays and assay formats we developed
cytopathogenic NL63 plaque assays that can be used for
analytical and preparative purposes.

Results and discussion
Susceptibility of different cell lines to hCoV-NL63 and
cytopathogenic effects
LLC-MK2 and Vero cells do not cause clear CPE on infection with hCoV-NL63. Because this virus uses the same
receptor as the SARS-CoV, 12 different cell cultures susceptible to SARS-CoV infection were tested for susceptibility to hCoV-NL63 [34,36,37] (Table 1). Cells in six-well
plates were infected with 10e4 plaque-forming units of

hCoV-NL63 virus stock LLC-MK2 NP. RNA concentrations in supernatants were measured short after virus
adsorption (i.e., in fresh medium after washing off of the
infection supernatant), and 7 days later (Table 1). Increase
of virus RNA was less than 1000-fold in seven of 12 cultures. Interestingly, this included LLC-MK2, the prototype
cell culture for NL63. In spite of a low amplification factor
these cells showed the usual weak CPE that is typically
observed when infected with hCoV-NL63.
Vero cells seemed to support virus growth efficiently but
produced no CPE. Interestingly, there was a remarkable
difference between Vero E6 and Vero FM cells (Table 1).
In our hands these cells also showed differences in growth
of SARS-CoV. Vero FM consistently showed more pronounced CPE than Vero E6 but there were no significant
differences in RNA amplification (not shown).
CaCo-2 cells amplified virus RNA most efficiently, and
showed a clearly visible CPE starting from day 4 after
infection. Cells became rounded, detached from the surface, and showed morphological signs of cell death (Figure 1).
For confirmation of differential replication efficiencies,
CaCo-2 and LLC-MK2 cells were infected in parallel. Both
cell lines were seeded in 25 cm2 flasks, and infected at
multiplicities of infection of 0.005. Samples of supernatants were taken daily from day 0 to 7 and analyzed by real
time RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 2, CaCo-2 cells replicated virus more efficiently than LLC-MK2. From day 3

onward, RNA concentrations were more than 100 fold
higher in CaCo-2 cells. Because of the clear CPE observed
in CaCo-2 cells, these cells were tested for their utility in a
cytopathogenic plaque assay.
Comparison of different overlays
Three overlay techniques commonly used for plaque
assays were tested for their suitability [23]. CaCo-2 cells
were infected in 6-well plates with hCoV-NL63. After one
hour, supernatants were removed, cells washed with PBS,
and overlaid as follows.

For CMC overlays, 1 mL fresh DMEM was added to each
well. Subsequently 1 mL of 1.6% CMC solution was
slowly added per well. Agarose overlays (1% final concentration) were prepared by melting 2% agarose at 70°C,
cooling it in a water bath to 42°C, and mixing it immediately before application with an equal volume of 2 ×
DMEM stored at room temperature. Two mL of the mixture were carefully applied to each well. Avicel overlays
were made by mixing 2.4% Avicel solution with an equal
volume of 2 × DMEM. 2 mL of the mixture were immediately added to each well.
Plaque assays were incubated without disturbing at 37°C
and 5% CO2. Overlays were removed on day five and cells
were fixed with a solution of 4% formaldehyde in PBS.
After 30 min the formaldehyde solution was removed,
cells were washed twice with PBS, and stained with a 0.2%
crystal violet solution. As shown in Figure 3, plaques were

visible with all three overlays, but staining was clearest
with Avicel.
Incubation times
HCoV-NL63 culture with LLC-MK2 cells takes more than
7 days until first signs of weak CPE become visible. In
order to test whether incubation times could be reduced
with CaCo-2 cells, five plaque assays on virus dilution
series were done with Avicel overlays and terminated by
fixation after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days, respectively. On days
1 and 2, no plaques were visible (not shown). Termination at day 3 yielded plaques only at high virus concentration (Figure 4). From day 4 onward, plaques were visible
in the lowest detectable virus concentration. Plaques on
day 5 were larger, but did not increase in number.
Plaque preparation
Work with hCoV-NL63 is complicated by low infectious
titers in virus stock solutions. In order to obtain more

infectious virus solutions, our standard virus stock LLCMK2 NP (see Materials and Methods section) was plaquepurified using the agarose overlay. Because life staining of
cells with neutral red solution was not successful on
CaCo-2 cells (not shown), we used an alternative technique of plaque preparation.
Limiting dilution infections were done on 6-well plates.
After 5 days, cytopathic foci were identified by scanning
through the wells with an inverted microscope at low
magnification, lighting through the clear agarose overlay.
The positions of CPE foci were marked with a permanent
marker (it was helpful to turn up the microscope light for
this). The agarose overlay was penetrated with a pipette
and 10 to 20 μl of fluid was aspirated underneath the
overlay. This fluid was resuspended in 100 μl of Opti Pro
serum-free medium, which served as the starting solution
for a new limiting dilution infection series in the next 6well plate plaque assay. Three rounds of purification were

To compare the infectivity of the plaque-purified virus
with the original LLC-MK2 virus stock (see Materials and
Methods section), viral titres were determined by Avicel
plaque assay as shown in Figure 5. CaCo-2 PP was about
10-fold more infectious than LLC-MK2 NP. Plaque assays
were repeated three times (not shown). Mean titres were
determined to be 1.4 × 10e6 PFU/mL and 1.3 × 10e5 PFU/
mL, respectively, for CaCo-2 PP and LLC-MK2 NP. Absolute quantification of virus RNA by real-time RT-PCR
yielded 4.8 × 10e11 RNA copies/mL for CaCo-2 PP and
5.3 × 10e10 copies/mL for LLC-MK2 NP.
It was interesting to note that both virus stocks had rather
high RNA concentrations as opposed to their infectivities.
PFU/RNA ratios were 2.92 × 10e-6 for CaCo-2 PP and
2.45 × 10e-6 for LLC-MK2 NP. This high excess of RNA
over infectious units might be attributable to the virus
harvesting procedure, possibly releasing nonpackaged
RNA along with virus particles during freeze-thawing.
Because PFU/RNA ratios were very similar for both stocks,
it appeared unlikely that elimination of defective interfering particles had contributed the gain of infectivity. It will
be interesting in future studies to see whether hCoV-NL63
might have adapted to CaCo-2 cells during plaque purification.

done. After the last round, aspirated fluid was inoculated
in 5 mL of Opti Pro serum-free medium, which was then
overlaid on confluent CaCo-2 cells in a 25 cm2 flask for
infection. After infection for one hour and washing, 5 mL
DMEM were added and flasks were incubated at 37°C,
5% CO2 for four days. Stocks were harvested and stored as
described for the original LLC-MK2 stock in the Materials
and Methods section. The purified virus is hereafter
referred to as CaCo-2 PP (for plaque-purified).

CaCo-2 cells seem to support hCoV-NL63 replication significantly better than hitherto used culture cells. Their
application for a cytopathogenic plaque assay facilitates
quantification of infectivity and enables studies using
plaque morphology. Short incubation time of 4 days is
compatible with high-throughput applications such as
drug screening. The use of Avicel as an overlay is favourable for plaque quantification, whereas agarose overlays
are preferred for plaque purification. Virus stock of
increased infectivity will be beneficial for antiviral screening, animal modelling of disease, and other experimental
tasks.

Methods
Cell cultures
All cells were cultivated in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified
Eagles Medium) (PAA, Cölbe, Germany) with 4.5 g/L Glucose (PAA), supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum
"GOLD" (PAA), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin 100 × concentrate (Penicillin 10000 U/mL, Streptomycin 10 mg/
mL) (PAA), 1% L-Glutamine 200 mM, 1% Sodium Pyruvate 100 mM (PAA), 1% MEM nonessential amino acids
(NEAA) 100 × concentrate (PAA). Utilized cell cultures are
identified in Table 1. For passaging, cells were detached
using trypsin-EDTA (PAA), except CaCo-2 cells. These
were routinely subcultured by scraping and pipetting for
mechanical re-suspension.

HCoV-NL63 virus stock solution
An eighth passage virus stock of hCoV-NL63 was kindly
provided by Lia van der Hoek, AMC Amsterdam. It was
grown in LLC-MK2 cells in limiting dilution series, recovering it three times from the last well of a dilution series
still showing diffuse CPE. Subconfluent LLC-MK2 monolayers were infected in 75 cm2 flasks with virus supernatant
from the last round of limiting dilution culture at a ratio
of 1:100 (200 μl virus supernatant in 20 mL of fresh
medium). This concentration was the highest virus dilution still infectious in this culture format. The flasks were
incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, and harvested on day four.
For harvesting, flasks were frozen at -70°C and thawed.
Cells and supernatant were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000
rpm. Cleared supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 70°C. This virus stock is hereafter referred to as LLC-MK2
NP (for non-purified).
Infection of cells
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at approximately 4 ×
10e5 cells per well and incubated until the monolayer was
70–80% confluent. CaCo-2 cells were grown to 100%
confluence. Prior to infection cells were washed with 1 ×
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Virus inoculum in 900
μL GIBCO Opti Pro serum free medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) plus 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (PAA)
and 1% L-Glutamine (PAA) was added to each well. Inoculum was removed after one hour of incubation. Cells
were washed twice with 1 × PBS and supplemented with 2
mL DMEM per well.
RNA extraction and real time RT-PCR
Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant
with the QIAamp Viral RNA mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). Real time RT-PCR for hCoV-NL63 with absolute virus RNA quantification was performed as described
previously [38].
Media and overlays for plaque assays
A 2.4% (w/v) suspension of Avicel RC-581 (FCM BioPolymer, Brussels, Belgium) was prepared in distilled water
and autoclaved (20 min 121°C)[23]. A 2% (w/v) suspension of agarose (Plaque Agarose, Biozym, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany) was prepared in distilled water and
autoclaved. A 1.6% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solution was prepared by autoclaving CMC powder (BDH,
Poole, UK) with a magnetic stirrer. Autoclaved powder
was hydrated in DMEM at 1.6% (w/v) and stirred overnight until homogenous.

Double concentrated Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) was prepared by mixing DMEM (PAA) with 9.48
g/L DMEM Powder (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 20% Foetal Bovine Serum "GOLD" (PAA),
2% Penicillin/Streptomycin 100 × concentrate (Penicillin

10000 Units/mL, Streptomycin 10 mg/mL) (PAA), 2% LGlutamine 200 mM, 2% Sodium Pyruvate 100 mM
(PAA), 2% MEM NEAA 100 × concentrate (PAA). Medium
was sterilized by filtration.
