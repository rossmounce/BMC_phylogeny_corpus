Abstract
Background: The zinc finger (ZF) protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is highly conserved in
Drosophila and vertebrates where it has been shown to mediate chromatin insulation at a
genomewide level. A mode of genetic regulation that involves insulators and insulator binding
proteins to establish independent transcriptional units is currently not known in nematodes
including Caenorhabditis elegans. We therefore searched in nematodes for orthologs of proteins
that are involved in chromatin insulation.
Results: While orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all 35 analysed nematode
species, we find orthologs of CTCF in a subset of nematodes. As an example for these we cloned
the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and revealed a genomic structure very similar to the
Drosophila counterpart. To investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we
performed phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced nematodes. We
show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster together with known CTCF
proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans and other derived nematodes does so.
Conclusion: Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are present in basal
nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived
nematodes like C. elegans. We propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during
nematode evolution, from the common vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting
regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in
more derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead operons,
polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes, seemingly adopted their
function.

Background
Chromatin insulation plays a profound role in regulating
gene expression and is mediated by the binding of insulator proteins to specific DNA sequence elements. So far, in
only a limited number of organisms insulator function
has been demonstrated: in yeast [1-3], sea urchin [4,5],

Drosophila (e. g. [6,7]), and vertebrates (e. g. [8,9]). D. melanogaster and vertebrates are the only metazoan systems
where insulator binding proteins have been identified. In
Drosophila, Suppressor of Hairy Wing [Su(Hw)], Boundary
Element Associated Factors (BEAF-32A and BEAF-32B),
Zeste-white 5 (Zw5), GAGA Binding Factor (GAF), and,

most recently, CTCF (dCTCF) have been described as
functional insulator proteins. In contrast, there is only
one known insulator protein in vertebrates, CTCF, which
is associated with all known insulators [10,11].

lethality and a homeotic phenotype [21]. The relevance of
CTCF for normal development was also illustrated in vertebrates as its elimination in mice resulted in early embryonic lethality [22].

CTCF was initially described as a transcriptional regulator
of the chicken c-myc proto-oncogene [12]. Besides its
function as a transcription factor, CTCF is important for
several other cellular processes, e. g. genomic imprinting,
X-chromosome inactivation, control of DNA methylation
state, or long-range chromatin interactions (for review see
[13]). The link between CTCF and chromatin insulation
was established in 1999 with the discovery that the borders of the chicken -globin locus have insulator activity
and resemble CTCF binding sites necessary for insulating
the -globin genes and maintaining their distinct regulatory programs [14,15].

These reports from vertebrates and flies highlight the
importance of chromatin insulation and insulator binding proteins on a global genomic scale in both systems
(for recent reviews, see [13,23]). Moreover, the work
about dCTCF showed that a key player of chromatin insulation is conserved from fly to man. We reasoned therefore that chromatin insulation might also be a relevant
mechanism of regulating gene expression in nematodes
and conducted a systematic computational survey of all
available nematode genomes and EST data sets to detect
orthologs of the presently known insulator binding proteins.

Recently, a systematic computational search for conserved
noncoding elements revealed a highly enriched CTCF
binding motif occurring at nearly 15.000 positions within
the human genome [16]. Nearby genes separated by predicted CTCF sites exhibited a markedly reduced correlation in gene expression, consistent with the hypothesis
that CTCF insulator sites partition the genome into independent domains of gene expression. A similar number of
potential insulator sites was found by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (ChIP) against CTCF and,
strikingly, the CTCF binding consensus motif deduced
there was virtually identical to the enriched conserved element defined in the first study [17]. In addition, it was
shown that the sites of CTCF-binding sequences in the
human genome are highly conserved in other vertebrates,
consistent with a widespread and fundamental role of
CTCF in different organisms. More evidence of CTCF
function in the establishment of discrete chromosomal
domains was provided by [18] who showed that interactions between genome and nuclear lamina take place
abundantly with CTCF sites preferentially demarcating
the identified lamina associated domain borders. These
data suggest that CTCF is an essential organiser of longrange chromatin interaction and transcription across species.

In the following we will frequently refer to «basal» and
«derived» nematodes. In a recent publication, the phylum
Nematoda has been divided into 12 clades [24]. According to this classification we define members of clades 1
and 2 as «basal» nematodes, while members of clades 3 –
12 including C. elegans (clade 9) are designated «derived».
This view of the Nematoda being divided into two major
groups corresponds to their partition into the classes Enoplea (basal, paraphyletic) and Chromadorea (derived,
monophyletic; see Discussion for further arguments supporting this view) [25,26].

In 2005, presence of a CTCF ortholog outside the vertebrates was reported for the first time [19]. This Drosophila
CTCF had a binding site specificity similar to vertebrate
CTCF and conveyed insulator activity to one known insulator in the Drosophila Abdominal-B locus of the Bithorax
complex. ChIP-chip experiments of the whole Bithorax
complex revealed that dCTCF is directly associated with
almost all known or predicted insulators in this region
[20]. Binding of dCTCF to the insulators of the Bithorax
complex is relevant in vivo because dCTCF null mutations
in the fly affect expression of Abdominal-B, cause pharate

Results
Known insulator binding proteins are not found in
nematodes except CTCF
We searched whole genome sequence databases of seven
nematode species for orthologs of the known insulator
proteins Su(Hw), BEAF-32, GAGA factor, Zw5, and CTCF.

With dCTCF as query, a high scoring predicted open reading frame (ORF; e-113) was identified in the genome
assembly of the basal nematode Trichinella spiralis, but not
in the genomes of other, more derived nematodes (Table
1). Reciprocal BLAST searches of this ORF in the NCBI
database confirmed a high similarity to CTCF proteins of
insects and vertebrates. The same approach, when conducted with the reported hits from other nematode
genomes, resulted in non-CTCF zinc finger proteins (data
not shown).
When we searched for Su(Hw) or Zw5 orthologs, relatively high BLAST scores were generated in some nematode genomes (Table 1). Reciprocal BLAST analysis at the
NCBI website however showed that, in all cases, these
could be attributed to a number of adjacent C2H2 zinc
finger domains and never traced back to an insulator protein query.

Results of BLAST searches for five known insulator proteins in seven
nematode genomes (clade numbering after [24], see Figure 4A).
Numbers represent the reported BLASTP score of the three best hits
in a given genome. Only CTCF can be detected in the basal nematode
T. spiralis (bold). See text for further explanation.

In contrast to the Caenorhabditis species, an annotated set
of the protein coding regions is not yet available for the
Ascaris suum and Pristionchus pacificus genomes, restricting
our data set to the possible ORFs derived from the preliminary sequence assembly. Therefore, BLAST analysis can
reveal only single similar ORFs and not whole annotated
proteins, explaining the lower average scores in these
organisms (Table 1).
We noticed that BLAST analysis with the ZF proteins
Su(Hw), Zw5, and CTCF generated the following partially
overlapping gene matches in the C. elegans genome:
F25D7.3; Y55F3AM.14; Y38H8A.5; C55B7.12; F45B8.4;
R12E2.1; R11E3.6; T27E9.4 (for information see [27]).
For three of these proteins, the function is known, e. g. as
a transcription factor in specific cells [28-30]. For the
remaining proteins no functional data or mutant alleles
exist and their RNAi-mediated knockdown did not result
in observable phenotypes (except in F25D7.3) [27].
Therefore, the available information about the above
mentioned C. elegans proteins gives no indication that
they might act as insulator proteins [27]. The same conclusions also apply to the C. briggsae and C. remanei
genomes.
To extend our data set, we conducted BLAST searches with
the same five insulator protein sequences in all available
nematode ESTs (http://www.nematode.net[31]). Consistent with our previous results (Table 1), we could not
obtain candidates for any of the known insulator proteins
after reciprocal BLAST tests (data not shown) except for
CTCF. We identified CTCF orthologs in two out of three
other basal nematodes, in Xiphinema index (clone
XI00686, 5.9e-73) and Trichuris muris (clone TM01708,
1.6e-62), but not in the ESTs of 32 derived nematode species.

The insulator proteins BEAF-32A and B, which do not
contain ZFs, and GAGA factor, having a single ZF, did not
produce significant hits in our nematode data set, suggesting the general absence of a related protein in nematodes
(Table 1).

Taken together, our results suggest that the whole nematode phylum apparently does not possess known insulator proteins, except orthologs of the genome organiser
and insulator protein CTCF which seems to be restricted
to basal nematodes.

Searches for Su(Hw), Zw5, and CTCF orthologs in Brugia
malayi resulted in considerably higher scores compared to
other nematode genomes (Table 1). But again, reciprocal
best BLAST could not unveil a link to known insulator
proteins (data not shown). Remarkably, however, these
scores are produced from a family of ZF proteins consisting of at least 15 extraordinary similar members with multiple adjacent ZFs whose most similar sequences in
humans are the KRAB containing ZF proteins 235 and 93
(Q14590 and NP_004225). A similar family of nearly
identical ZF proteins is absent in other nematode
genomes (PH, unpublished data).

Cloning and characterisation of CTCF from the basal
nematode T. spiralis
To confirm our computational identification of putative
CTCF orthologs in basal nematodes, we cloned the mRNA
of the T. spiralis CTCF ortholog (tsCTCF). Comparison
with the unpublished T. spiralis genome sequence assembly (accession number ABIR01000000) revealed that
tsCTCF lies on a 6.5 kb genomic locus. The primary transcript contains four exons, with the first and last being
untranslated, and three introns, with a large second intron
(1.7 kb). The resulting 4.6 kb mRNA has a 414 bp 5'UTR
and a 1328 bp 3'UTR, both harboring a small intron of

about 100 bp. The deduced protein coding region (948
AA) is a fusion of two exons, a small first one and a large
second exon carrying the entire ZF region (Figure 1B).

A comparison of the genomic structure reveals remarkable
similarities between Trichinella and Drosophila CTCF, the
most closely related published CTCF ortholog (Figure 1A,

ten small exons are scattered over a large genomic locus in
all vertebrate CTCFs (Figure 1C). The entire ZF region of
the invertebrate CTCFs is located on a large exon comprising 80% of the coding region while it is composed of
seven short exons in vertebrates [32]. The 5'UTR, interrupted by an intron, is leading in frame to the translation
start in both, Trichinella and Drosophila CTCF. However,
unlike dCTCF the Trichinella gene carries a larger 3'UTR
(1328 bp versus 320 bp) that is also present in vertebrate
CTCFs (1413 bp for the chicken CTCF 3'UTR [33]).

cosylation (6 instances), N-myristoylation (14 instances),
and phos-phorylation (22 instances, including cAMPdependent kinase, Casein kinase II, Protein kinase C, and
Tyrosine kinase sites) were also predicted for tsCTCF, the
latter being consistent with the presence of functional
phosphorylation sites in vertebrate CTCF [40]. In addition, pronounced Glutamine-rich regions (AA 148 – 168
and 252 – 338), a Serine-rich region (AA 698 – 723), and
an Asparagine-rich region (AA 736 – 766) are present in
Trichinella, but not in other CTCFs (Figure 1D).

The central region of the protein contains ten C2H2 ZFs
conserved in all reported CTCF sequences [19,32]. Within
vertebrates, the eleventh ZF is of the C2HC-type. In Drosophila however, ZF11 is a C2H2-type finger and displays
only weak conservation of the critical DNA binding residues as well as a small insertion (Figure 2). In tsCTCF,
ZF11 is missing entirely, and neither 3'Race PCR nor the
genomic sequence at this locus gave indications for its
presence. These observations suggest that conservation of
ZF11 is not a strict requirement for functional CTCF proteins.

Despite minor differences, the similar genomic organisation of Trichinella CTCF and Drosophila CTCF as well as the
remarkable conservation of the ZF domain and DNA
binding residues point to a conserved function of this protein in the basal nematode Trichinella spiralis. This
assumption is further supported by our work in progress
that demonstrates a specific binding of Trichinella CTCF to
known Drosophila CTCF target sites in electric mobility
shift experiments, indicating that the binding preferences
of the two proteins are very similar (M. Bartkuhn and P.
Heger, unpublished data).

Figure 2 depicts an alignment of the ZF region of human,
Trichinella, and Drosophila CTCF. Most of the crucial DNA
recognition residues at positions -1, 2, 3, and 6 are identical between at least two of the three species. Variations in
position 6 for ZF6 and ZF9 generate a change from
alanine or serine to methionine, which does not alter the
DNA recognition code of the finger [19,34]. The identity
within the ZF region between the human and Trichinella
proteins is 52%, exceeding the rate of 44% between Drosophila and vertebrates (Table 2). Flies, however, belong to
a highly derived insect order with rapid evolution [35,36].
We therefore extended our analysis to CTCF sequences
from more «basal» insects, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum. The CTCFs from both, basal nematodes and basal
insects, are more similar to the human counterpart and to
each other than Drosophila CTCF (Table 2). The lower similarity of Drosophila CTCF is therefore probably due to the
rapid evolution of the fly insect order.

Loss of CTCF during nematode evolution
In our initial survey we identified several putative CTCF
orthologs in basal nematodes while in derived nematodes
like C. elegans or B. malayi a protein with a high similarity
to CTCF could not be detected. This raises the possibility
that originally CTCF was present in nematodes, but was
lost during nematode evolution.

CTCFs contain conserved motifs in the N- and C-terminal
domains which are important mainly for protein-protein
interaction [37]. Prominent candidates for such motifs
could not be found in the Trichinella N- and C-terminal
domains. In particular, an AT hook motif described for
Drosophila and vertebrate CTCFs is absent in Trichinella.
Nevertheless, scanning the coding region in the PRINTS
[38] and PROSITE databases [39] generated several
matches. Consistent with the presumed DNA binding
function of the protein, a putative RCC1 chromatin binding motif was detected near the C-terminus (AA 869 –
886) that is not present in other known CTCFs. Commonly found post-translational modifications like N-gly-

To test this hypothesis we performed a phylogenetic analysis with a C2H2 ZF protein alignment that contained (i)
three putative CTCF orthologs from basal nematodes (Trichuris muris, Xiphinema index, and Trichinella spiralis), (ii)
17 annotated CTCF proteins from insects and vertebrates
(including «Boris» sequences, a vertebrate CTCF paralog),
and (iii) 89 selected C2H2 ZF proteins (see Methods)
derived from the Trichinella spiralis and Caenorhabditis elegans genome sequences (Figure 3).
Irrespective of the method of tree reconstruction, our phylogenetic analysis recovered all known and putative CTCF
orthologs as a well-supported gene family, the CTCF/
Boris-clade (Figure 3). A single sequence of the basal nematode T. spiralis clustered to the CTCF/Boris-clade,
whereas all remaining ZF proteins of the Trichinella
genome formed many independent branches/gene families, separate from the CTCFs. Putative CTCF sequences
from two other basal nematodes, Trichuris muris and
Xiphinema index, were also resolved as members of the
CTCF/Boris-clade. The phylogenetic position derived for
the three nematode CTCFs is nearest to insect CTCFs,
emphasising the close genomic similarity observed
between Trichinella and Drosophila CTCF. These data con-

firm that our isolated Trichinella protein is indeed a member of a unique group of CTCF proteins in invertebrates.
In contrast, ZF proteins from the derived nematode and
standard model system Caenorhabditis elegans behave differently. Here, all ZF proteins are clearly apart from the
CTCF/Boris-clade, indicating that a CTCF ortholog is not
present in C. elegans (Figure 3). We wanted to confirm
these findings with corresponding ZF protein data sets
from two closely related Caenorhabditis species, C. briggsae
and C. remanei, and, in both cases, no ZF protein clustered
to the CTCF/Boris-clade (data not shown).
When we included in our analysis a ZF set derived from
the Drosophila melanogaster genome, only the single
known CTCF ortholog of this species joined the CTCF/
Boris-clade as in Figure 3 (data not shown).
Non-CTCF ZF proteins of the nematodes Trichinella and
Caenorhabditis displayed high sequence diversity, and
thus, our phylogenetic analysis largely failed to resolve the
ancestral diversification of non-CTCF ZF proteins. Nevertheless, it recovered many significantly supported terminal clades (gene families) with two to several members,
respectively (Figure 3). Most non-CTCF gene families are
present in both, Trichinella and Caenorhabditis («Ts/CE» in
Figure 3), whereas some others are confined to only one
genome («Ts» or «CE» in Figure 3). These results suggest
an early diversification of ZF protein families, which significantly predated the split between basal and derived
nematode lineages.
Derived (e. g. Caenorhabditis) and basal nematode clades
(e. g. Trichinella) are separated by about 700 million years
of evolution [41,42]. To more precisely determine when
CTCF was lost during nematode evolution, we included
ZF sets from nematodes positioned between Trichinella

and Caenorhabditis. However, we did not find CTCF-like
proteins in B. malayi and A. suum (clade 8; data not
shown), which are separated from C. elegans by an estimated 350 million years [43].
Inclusion of additional CTCF-like proteins from various
invertebrates confirmed the position of the nematode
CTCFs within the CTCF/Boris-clade, close to insect CTCFs
(data not shown).
Taken together, our phylogenetic results indicate that a
CTCF ortholog is present in nematodes, but only in their
most basal clades.

Discussion
The fundamental role of chromatin insulation in the regulation of gene expression is increasingly being recognised in vertebrates and fly [16,20,44,45]. However,
whether the underlying mechanisms and proteins are
conserved throughout the animal kingdom is not known.
Therefore, we conducted a first systematic approach to
detect orthologs of known insulator proteins in a phylum
more primitive than vertebrates and insects, in nematodes. While we could not find orthologs of other known
insulator proteins, we detected orthologs of CTCF in
basal, but not in derived nematodes.
As two of these basal nematodes, Trichinella spiralis and
Trichuris muris, are vertebrate parasites, a simple explanation for the presence of CTCF could be horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) from host to parasite.
However, our phylogenetic analysis clearly rejects this
possibility (Figure 3). The nematode CTCFs do not cluster
to the vertebrate CTCF proteins as one would expect for a
HGT scenario. Instead, they are positioned at the root of
the fly CTCF cluster. Implementation of additional CTCFlike sequences from other arthropods reinforces this finding (data not shown). Furthermore, we show that Xiphinema index, a basal plant parasitic nematode, contains
CTCF. But BLAST searches indicated that a CTCF-like protein is not present in available plant genome sequences
including Arabidopsis thaliana and grapevine (Vitis vinifera), a common host of Xiphinema index (not shown).
Therefore, we assume that CTCF was originally present in
nematodes. Our finding of a CTCF ortholog only in basal
nematodes allows several possible scenarios for the evolution of gene expression in the phylum Nematoda. One
possibility is that the original function of CTCF is not
related to chromatin insulation, but that insulation properties appeared later in evolution. As both, fly and vertebrate CTCF, are insulator proteins, this event then must
have happened independently twice or CTCF must have
lost insulator activity in nematodes. To ultimately answer

Presence of CTCF in basal nematodes
Presence of CTCF in basal nematodes. Phylogenetic analysis of ZF proteins from nematodes, insects, and vertebrates.
The tree topology resulted from protein maximum likelihood, using the model WAG+I+G. To test the robustness of the
branching pattern, three bootstrap analyses were performed with protein maximum likelihood (WAG+I+G), neighbor joining,
and maximum parsimony methods. Bootstrap support values >50% are shown. Bayesian posterior probabilities, resulting from
a Bayesian analysis (model: WAG+I+G), served as additional measure for the confidence of branches. Posterior probabilities
>0.94 were considered as significant, lower values were ignored. Ts000x: sequence from T. spiralis, CEx: sequence from C. elegans. All putative as well as annotated CTCF and Boris orthologs form a single, well-supported clade. Note the paralogous
clusters of vertebrate CTCF and vertebrate Boris [32] within this clade. No ZF protein of the derived nematode C. elegans
clusters to the known CTCFs, whereas a single ZF protein of T. spiralis and CTCFs of two other basal nematodes do so. Several significantly supported clades of non-CTCF zinc finger proteins contain orthologs of both nematode genomes analysed
here (Ts/CE), indicating an early diversification of ZF proteins.

this question functional data for nematode CTCFs are
required. However, our work in progress argues for a functional conservation of CTCF in nematodes as the DNA
binding properties of Trichinella CTCF are very similar to
Drosophila CTCF (M. Bartkuhn and P. Heger, unpublished
data).
In a second scenario the identified protein is a true CTCF
ortholog with insulator and genome organiser activity like
the vertebrate and Drosophila counterparts. If CTCF performs these essential functions in basal nematodes, how
can we explain its loss in derived nematodes like C. elegans? It is conceivable that during nematode evolution
CTCF was not lost, but has been altered to an extent that
prevents its recognition, especially as C. elegans and other
members of the nematode crown clades 8 – 12 are fast
evolving organisms [24]. As the great majority of the analysed nematode genome and EST data belongs to fast
evolving species, we cannot rule out this scenario. Nevertheless, explaining the absence of CTCF with a single
event like a gene loss or chromosomal deletion early in
nematode evolution appears more likely than independent evolutionary loss of CTCF in so many derived nematodes.
There are CTCF-dependent functions beyond chromatin
insulation which are as much as important for the viability of an organism, e. g. X-chromosome inactivation, DNA
methylation, or genomic imprinting. However, several
arguments support the conclusion that the loss of a central player in these functions is not deleterious for C. elegans. Instead of random X-chromosome inactivation
involving CTCF, like in mammals, C. elegans uses an alternative dosage compensation mechanism to repress Xlinked genes which is studied in detail (for review see
[46]). DNA methylation and genomic imprinting are
unknown in C. elegans and other derived nematodes [4750]. A transcription factor activity of CTCF could have
been passed on to other proteins. Therefore, also these
additional functions of CTCF are compatible with the
absence of CTCF in derived nematodes.

If CTCF and therefore CTCF-mediated chromatin insulation are absent in those nematodes, could other proteins
have acquired insulator function? Presently, no data are
available to support or reject this hypothesis as chromatin
insulation in C. elegans or other nematodes is unknown,
so far. However, it has been suggested that generally gene
expression in C. elegans is controlled by regulatory elements located immediately upstream of the transcription
unit [51-53]. This seems to be different to Drosophila and
vertebrates where long-range interactions with distant regulatory elements over more than 10 kb have been
reported [54,55].
Thus, our finding of the insulator protein CTCF in basal
nematodes and the available data from C. elegans open
the possibility that chromatin insulation is absent in
derived, but present in basal nematodes. This would be in
line with several other reports that underscore substantial
differences between basal nematodes and the derived
model organism C. elegans. Here, four examples are given.
(i) Embryogenesis of C. elegans and other derived nematodes is characterised by a unique type of gastrulation not
found elsewhere in the animal kingdom while in the basal
nematode Tobrilus diversipapillatus (clade 1) gastrulation
resembles the «classical» pattern found all over the animal
kingdom [56]. (ii) Hedgehog and Smoothened, parts of
the Hedgehog signaling pathway, are not present in C. elegans and other derived nematodes [57], but recent studies
identify a bonafide hedgehog gene in the basal nematodes
Trichinella spiralis and Xiphinema index [58]. (iii) C. elegans
contains a greatly reduced Hox gene complement [59]
while in the basal nematode T. spiralis several additional
Hox genes were identified, suggesting Hox gene loss during nematode evolution [60]. (iv) Embryogenesis of
Romanomermis culicivorax, like Trichinella a representative
of the basal nematode clade 2, has revealed several fundamental differences to C. elegans, for example with respect
to cell division patterns and tissue formation [61,62].
Looking at these prominent differences, it appears not
unlikely that a fundamental difference in the regulation of

Page 9 of 14

BMC Molecular Biology 2009, 10:84

gene expression exists between basal and derived nematodes. In support of this view an additional argument can
be made that directly points toward such a difference in
genome organisation.
C. elegans has operons, clusters of closely spaced genes
under the control of a single regulatory signal. A genomewide survey revealed more than 1.000 operons in the C.
elegans genome comprising about 15% of all genes [63].
Therefore, operons have to be considered a major mode of
transcriptional regulation. Although structurally different,
operons are functionally similar to chromatin domains
demarcated by insulator proteins as both ensure coordinated expression of enclosed genes, independently from
other transcriptional units.
Operons have been shown to exist not only in C. elegans
[64], but also in several distantly related nematodes [65-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/84

70]. However, these species all belong to the more derived
nematode clades 8 – 12 (Figure 4B). Whether basal nematodes like T. spiralis also have their genome arranged in
operons, remains to be determined. However, analysis of
spliced leader trans-splicing gave no evidence that operons exist in T. spiralis [71].
Based on our findings and supported by other major differences between basal and derived nematodes, we propose the following model (Figure 4): In ancestral
nematodes, genome organisation and transcriptional regulation were similar to the situation in Drosophila and
operons were not present like in the great majority of
eukaryotes. To ascertain coordinated gene expression,
CTCF-mediated chromatin insulation was used. Transsplicing already existed in these ancient nematodes
[71,72]. Therefore, the availability of a trans-splicing
machinery allowed formation of operons by providing a

mechanism to express their downstream genes. As operon
gains outbalance operon losses [73], they eventually
became a major mode of transcriptional organisation in
nematodes, superseding chromatin insulation. With
decreasing selection pressure, CTCF, the mediator of chromatin insulation, finally got lost. As all analysed representatives of clades 8 – 12 have operons (Figure 4B), but
presumably not Trichinella, a clade 2 nematode, we place
that event to the split between basal (Enoplea) and
derived (Chromadorea) nematodes (Figure 4C).

Conclusion
Chromatin insulation is a fundamental feature of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic genomes. Despite its
importance, it is not known so far, whether chromatin
insulation also exists in nematodes. By identifying CTCF,
a mediator of chromatin insulation in vertebrates and
Drosophila, our study reports for the first time that chromatin insulation might also be used for gene regulation in
nematodes. We show that CTCF is restricted to the most
basal nematode clades. From the absence of CTCF in
derived nematodes we conclude that alternative gene regulation mechanisms developed early in nematode history
allowing the loss of CTCF and possibly CTCF-mediated
chromatin insulation. Attractive candidates for such a
mechanism are operons, multicistronic transcription
units that appear to be present in all derived nematodes.
The striking correlation between presence of operons and
absence of CTCF in nematodes suggests that operons
replaced traditional transcription units based on chromatin insulation and CTCF.

Methods
Sequence database construction
For searching insulator proteins in C. elegans, Wormpep
version 165 was downloaded from http://www.worm
base.org[27]. For analysis of the B. malayi and P. pacificus
genomes, the respective published whole genome
sequence assemblies [69,74] were downloaded and translated into the six ORFs using Emboss [75] omitting very
short ORFs of less than 28 amino acids, the approximate
size of a ZF. The same procedure was applied to the C. elegans genomic sequence, to exclude the possibility of a protein missing in the annotated Wormpep data set, to the
unpublished T. spiralis whole genome assembly version
1.0, and to the unpublished A. suum whole genome
assembly. For control purposes, the genomes of C.
briggsae [67] and C. remanei (unpublished) and the proteome set of the fly Drosophila melanogaster (downloaded
from NCBI) were included.

To detect possible CTCF orthologs, the sequence sets were
scanned directly with multiple CTCF tailored HMM profiles (see below). In addition, standard BLASTP searches
were conducted with known insulator proteins as queries

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/84

after constructing BLAST databases from the ORF
sequence sets using the BLAST suite [76]. Based on these
results, we included at least the best scoring 50% of the
C2H2 ZF repertoire of a genome in our data set.
Generation of HMM profiles
A recent publication suggested that only four of CTCF's 11
ZFs are essential for strong binding [77]. Therefore we
considered ZFs 4 – 7 an adequate marker for this protein
and constructed an HMM profile of this region with
sequences from eight organisms as input (five arthropods,
two nematodes, one mammal). The profile was used to
scan the available nematode genomes for matching ZF
proteins. In addition, a second profile representing a single ZF motif was constructed from CTCF ZFs 4 – 8 of the
same organisms. The hits obtained with both profiles
were included into the data set for phylogenetic analyses.
As a threshold, a HMMer score of 1 was defined to
include virtually all multiple C2H2 ZF proteins of the
respective organsim. For HMM profile generation and
genomic scans the HMMER software was employed
(http://hmmer.janelia.org, [78]).
Multiple sequence alignment
BLAST and HMMer hits were combined into a non-redundant set of ZF sequences for each organism. Initial tests
showed that a meaningful alignment was not possible
using the raw data set due to the heterogeneity of the
included proteins. We therefore restricted the data set to
the ZF regions. If a protein had two or more contiguous ZF
domains separated from each other, only the domain
with the higher BLASTP and HMMer score was retained.
Sequences with less than three ZFs were excluded from
analysis. Proteins with more than 11 ZFs were trimmed to
retain the 10 – 12 most similar ZFs. Although the known
CTCFs have 11 ZFs, proteins with three to thirteen ZFs
were ultimately allowed in the analysis. Multiple
sequence alignment of the resulting data was performed
using the Muscle program [79]. Alignments were viewed
and edited using SeaView and TEXshade [80,81].
Phylogenetic Analyses
Our phylogenetic data sets contained sequences representing virtually all multiple C2H2 ZF proteins of the
respective nematodes. As a positive control, eight vertebrate CTCF and six Boris (Brother of Regulator of
Imprinted Sites, a CTCF paralog in vertebrates) sequences
were included that formed distinct clusters in a previous
study [32]. In addition, three published CTCF sequences
from insects were incorporated [19,82]. An outgroup was
not defined.

Phylogenetic trees resulting from the alignments were
computed using four different methods of tree reconstruction: maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, maximum

parsimony, and a Bayesian analysis. At first, the optimal
model of sequence evolution was determined by ProtTest
version 1.4 [83] according to the Akaike Information Criterion. The resulting optimal model (WAG+I+G) was used
for maximum likelihood (with 100 bootstrap replicates)
as well as Bayesian analyses with the programs PhyML version 3.0 [84] and MrBayes version 3.1.2 [85]. For Bayesian
analyses, two MCMC chains with 500.000 generations
were performed, and the first 100.000 generations discarded as «burnin». To determine Bayesian posterior
probabilities, a 90% majority-rule consensus of the
remaining 400.000 generations was calculated. Neighbor
joining and maximum parsimony bootstrap analyses
(each with 100 bootstrap replicates) were performed with
the program PAUP version 4.0b10 [86]. The likelihood
tree was initially visualized with TreeViewPPC version
1.6.6 [87], and then graphically edited with Adobe Illustrator software.
Cloning of tsCTCF
A BLAST database containing the ORFs of the unpublished Trichinella genome assembly was constructed.
Herein, BLASTP searches with known CTCF queries
revealed a remarkably similar ORF in Contig10.39 (e-89
for homo/mouse, e-113 for Drosophila). To clone this
putative CTCF, RNA from adult T. spiralis (kindly provided by David Guiliano, Imperial College, London, UK)
was used for cDNA synthesis followed by a modified
Smart Race PCR protocol (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). 3'
Race PCR with a gene specific primer (ccgaagggtaactgcgagtcgatgg) resulted in a 3.1 kb fragment. To clone the
5' end, PCRs were performed with a common reverse
primer and a set of forward primers situated upstream of
the cloned 3' fragment in Trichinella Contig10.39 and
spaced 200 – 250 bp apart from each other. The largest
amplified fragment was sequenced, and this information
was used to obtain the full length cDNA of tsCTCF via
PCR. With primers (ataagatctatgcagcatgacacggccac) and
(atactcgagacaaggaccggaccaaccgac) the entire coding
sequence of tsCTCF was amplified from cDNA, resequenced and verified to be correct. Using sequence information from the unpublished T. spiralis genome we
cloned and resequenced also the genomic DNA corresponding to our tsCTCF mRNA and found 100% agreement with the unpublished genome sequence.
Amplification products were cloned into pJet1 vector (Fermentas). For plasmid preparation, XL1-Blue bacteria
(Stratagene) were grown at room temperature (25°C) to
prevent plasmid loss. For sequence annotation, the
Artemis program was employed [88]. Sequence assembly
was performed with the Phred/Phrap/Consed package
[89,90]. Primers were designed using the Primer3 program [91]. The sequences of the Trichinella CTCF genomic
locus and the corresponding mRNA were deposited in the
