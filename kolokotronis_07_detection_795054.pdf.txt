Abstract
Background: Nuclear insertions of mitochondrial sequences (NuMts) have been identified in a
wide variety of organisms. Trafficking of genetic material from the mitochondria to the nucleus has
occurred frequently during mammalian evolution and can lead to the production of a large pool of
sequences with varying degrees of homology to organellar mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
sequences. This presents both opportunities and challenges for forensics, population genetics,
evolutionary genetics, conservation biology and the study of DNA from ancient samples. Here we
present a case in which difficulties in ascertaining the organellar mtDNA sequence from modern
samples hindered their comparison to ancient DNA sequences.
Results: We obtained mitochondrial hypervariable region (HVR) sequences from six ancient
samples of tundra muskox (Ovibos moschatus) that were reproducible but distinct from modern
muskox sequences reported previously. Using the same PCR primers applied to the ancient
specimens and the primers used to generate the modern muskox DNA sequences in a previous
study, we failed to definitively identify the organellar sequence from the two modern muskox
samples tested. Instead of anticipated sequence homogeneity, we obtained multiple unique
sequences from both hair and blood of one modern specimen. Sequencing individual clones of a >1
kb PCR fragment from modern samples did not alleviate the problem as there was not a consistent
match across the entire length of the sequences to Ovibos when compared to sequences in
GenBank.
Conclusion: In specific taxa, due to nuclear insertions some regions of the mitochondrial genome
may not be useful for the characterization of modern or ancient DNA.

Background
NuMts have been characterized in numerous species [1].
Various genome sequencing projects have demonstrated
that many copies ranging in length from parts of genes to
nearly full copies of the mtDNA genome exist in most
mammalian genomes [2,3]. When identified correctly,
older NuMts can be used as a constructional source of
phylogenetic outgroups [4]. However, they are better
known for their negative impact on the interpretation of
collected data. For example, a series of mutations originally thought to be correlated with Alzheimer's syndrome
were in fact NuMts [5]. A well publicized sequence
obtained from a dinosaur fossil was in fact a NuMt from a
human contaminant [6]. Using elephant hair, Greenwood
and Pääbo [7] demonstrated that in some species and in
some tissues, NuMts may be preferentially retrieved over
mtDNA by PCR. More recently, it has been shown that in
some primates, specific mtDNA loci may be unusable for
phylogeny reconstruction because of NuMts [8-10].
Methods that depend on the circularity of the mtDNA
genome, including amplification of long fragments or the
entire mtDNA genome, could exclude linear integrated
NuMts. However, this generally requires a good source of
intact DNA and is not commonly practiced. Given that
most non-invasive techniques for retrieving sequence
from wild animals require using tissues such as hair or
dung containing low concentrations of DNA, often of
poor quality, high copy sequences such as those present in
mtDNA are often the preferred target for analysis. The
problem also applies to degraded DNA such as DNA from
ancient samples. Although nuclear DNA is expected to be
harder to retrieve from ancient samples, NuMts have been
detected therein and such studies are not free from the
risks presented by NuMts [11]. For all these reasons,
NuMts present a serious challenge.
In our experiments, two primer pairs amplifying overlapping PCR fragments (270 bp and 162 bp, respectively)
were applied to both ancient muskox extracts and modern
muskox DNA. The sequences were largely uniform among
the ancient samples muskoxen although in one sample,
among several clones sequenced, one unequivocal NuMt
sequence was detected. In contrast to the ancient materials, the same primers yielded multiple distinct sequences
from modern muskox hair and blood. Thus, unlike proboscideans, hair and blood both yielded large numbers of
NuMts.
An additional PCR product was amplified from the modern materials encompassing the entire HVR. This yielded
sequences that were more uniform; however, outside of
the region being compared to the ancient samples, the
sequences did not match Ovibos as well as it matched
other related bovids. Phylogenetic analysis of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/67

sequences obtained did not provide clear separation of
NuMts into a clade separate from that for organellar
mtDNA. Thus, for the specific HVR sequence under study,
the organellar mtDNA sequence could not be determined
with absolute certitude.

Results
Ancient DNA Experiments
The original intent of our study was to extend the amount
of sequence that could be compared between ancient and
modern muskoxen beyond what was accomplished by
MacPhee et al. [12]. Six ancient muskox samples, all deriving from the Taimyr Peninsula (Russian Federation), and
ranging in age from 2,970 ± 40 to 44,760 ± 1700 yrbp
(radiocarbon years before present), yielded DNA and
were amplified with two PCR primer pairs. In one case,
OMTai23658, the larger amplification product could not
be obtained. This is consistent with the observed poorer
quality of the DNA extracted from this sample in previous
experiments [12]. For the other specimens, fragments
overlapped by 49 bp. Each sample was amplified for each
fragment twice and multiple clones per fragment were
sequenced (Figure 1). DNA damage is a feature of many
ancient DNA samples [13]. However, limited interclone
variation was observed. A possible explanation for the
lack of interclone variation is that relatively large amplification products could be retrieved reproducibly from
other loci such as cytochrome b (377 bp) as well, demonstrating the relatively good preservation state of most of
the ancient materials used in this study [12].

One clone of sample OMTai46 (clone 2.3 in Figure 1) was
highly divergent (differing from the consensus sequence
at 32 nucleotide positions). A BLASTN search of this
sequence resulted in a highest similarity score to a roe deer
control region sequence (Capreolus capreolus, e-value = 1e51) [14]. This finding is typical for a phylogentically older
NuMt, such that the sequence divergence from the target
taxon's mtDNA sequence places it as more similar, though
not identical, to the outgroup. Given the likely age of the
NuMt, as suggested by its large divergence from the other
clone sequences and its similarity to other caprines, the
clone is not a human contamination and likely represents
an old NuMt. However, the clone was unique among
clones from the same animal, and did not appear in other
samples. On the whole, then, NuMt retrieval from the
ancient specimens was minimal. This is not surprising as
it is expected that, given the high copy number of mtDNA
compared to nuclear DNA, in most subfossil samples
mtDNA will be greatly in excess over single copy sequence
nuclear DNA and therefore preferentially amplified by
PCR.
Several indels observed in the ancient samples were not
identified in an earlier investigation of modern muskox

Figure 1
Clone sequences used to determine ancient muskox mtDNA sequence
Clone sequences used to determine ancient muskox mtDNA sequence. MMO1-8 represent the 8 haplotypes already
identified in modern muskoxen [15]. The modern samples are also shaded. Samples are indicated by name (following the naming system in [12]) followed by the PCR repetition number followed by clone number i.e. 1.1 is the first clone sequence from
the first PCR amplification. Indels that are in conflict with the published sequences are indicated "*". Base changes that were
found only in samples from Taimyr but were not fixed are designated "§". Fixed differences between ancient Taimyr samples,
with the exception of OMTai23564, are also indicated "#".

DNA by Groves [15]. As noted by MacPhee et al. [12],
these indels are probably artifacts produced by Groves'
[15] single-strand direct sequencing protocol. By contrast,
when both strands of multiple cloned sequences are
investigated, no indels appear (Figure 1). Methodological
improvements in sequencing methodology that have
taken place since the original publication of the data
could explain the discrepancy.
Modern DNA Experiments
Having observed a NuMt sequence in the ancient DNA,
we performed two additional experiments using modern
DNA samples. In the first, the same primers used in the
investigation of the ancient DNA specimens were applied
to samples from two modern muskoxen (both hair and
blood from the first, blood only from the second, unrelated individual). In the second experiment, the primers
used by Groves [15] to generate her modern muskox database were applied to the ancient samples, which resulted
in > 1 kb product (see Additional file 1). Thus, three
primer pairs, two tissue types and two individuals were
each tested for the presence of NuMts using the same protocol.

All PCR products were cloned and multiple clone
sequences determined. The sequences were curated by
removing the vector sequence from the reads and the
beginning comparisons from the first base following the
3' end of the primers. The most consistent sequences
obtained came from the largest fragment investigated (see
Additional File 2). Some sequence heterogeneity was
observed in the region of overlap for all sequences compared with the exception of one highly divergent clone
(CHL.8). Two additional clone sequences, CBL.10 and
CHL.5 however, were almost identical to the majority of
clones in the region overlapping the shorter PCR products
retrieved from ancient DNA but were more divergent in
the 5' end of the HVR (see Additional File 2). This
extended into the region of the HVR not covered by any of
the database muskox sequences. The alignment of the
sequences to an outgroup sequence (Taiwanese serow,
Nemorhaedus swinhoei) and to the database did not generate a consistent alignment across the entire fragment covered by Groves' [15] sequences and those generated in this
study. The 3' end of the first fragments from GenBank
(U47061, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73 and 75) aligned poorly to
the sequences generated in this study and to the outgroup
sequence. Similarly, the 5' end of the second fragment
sequences from GenBank aligned poorly to the outgroup
and to the sequences generated from this study. Thus, the
sequences generated in this study aligned consistently to
each other, except where noted, and to the outgroup; yet
the database muskox sequences did not. Thus, sequence
heterogeneity suggesting NuMts were detected among the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/67

long fragment sequences and odd behaviour of the database muskoxen was also observed.
Tests for recombination and gene conversion were negative. In addition, whereas in the Groves [15] study 37
muskoxen yielded only 8 distinct haplotypes, the ~1.1 kb
fragment analyzed in this study of two individuals yielded
two new haplotypes not previously observed. It should be
noted that the indels tend to inflate the divergence of the
sequences. Most of the differences were base substitutions. Given the presence of insertions and deletions
among the ~1.1 kb fragment clones and alignment issues
with muskox sequences in the database, we conclude that
correct organellar mtDNA sequences cannot be unambiguously determined from the sequencing of the longest
PCR product amplified in this study.
More extreme discrepancies were observed with the PCR
products generated with the primers used to amplify from
the ancient DNA extracts. The shortest amplified fragment
yielded a sequence identical to the database of muskox
sequences, and one fixed difference compared to each of
the Taimyr muskoxen. Although the sequence obtained
for the ~1.1 kb fragment and sequences from the smaller
of the two amplification products were very similar to one
another, allowing for minor interclone variation, it is not
clear whether the smaller fragment is collinear with the
~1.1 kb sequences obtained in this study or one matching
the sequence in the database (see Additional File 2). Particularly considering the fact that two of the long fragment
clones were almost identical to the database muskoxen
and most of the other long clone sequences yet diverged
in other portions of the HVR. Also, a relatively recent
NuMt sequence might be very similar to sequence in the
organellar mtDNA. Conversely, the longer of the two
smaller fragments yielded multiple distinct sequences differing from the reference sequence (Figure 2). This result
was obtained regardless of the tissue of origin: both hair
and blood yielded multiple distinct sequences, with no
single type predominating. In addition, none of the
sequences in the overlapping region between the two
small fragment primer sets matched (data not shown). In
contrast, the second muskox blood sample yielded a predominant sequence (6 of 10 clones) that did match in the
overlap and matched the sequence obtained with the ~
1.1 kb fragment for this portion of the HVR. Thus, intraindividual variation in NuMt detection was observed and
unlike the case of proboscideans, blood did not yield
fewer NuMts than hair [7].
Evolutionary analyses
In order to determine if the bona fide mtDNA sequence for
Ovibos moschatus could be determined from our material
despite the presence of NuMts, various methods of tree
reconstruction and different statistical tests were per-

formed. Our main analytical conclusions, with their supporting analyses, are as follows:
1. The chromosomal rearrangement feature enabled in
POY is a powerful tool for the establishment of homology
between loci differing in their physical arrangement.
However, no clone sequence clusters resulted from rearrangement analysis as all combinations had the same cost
in a maximum parsimony framework. In addition, no
recombination was detectable in this sequence dataset.
Thus, the multiple clones derived from different individuals cannot be explained as a PCR artefact or the presence
of recombinant mtDNA.
2. The nucleotide frequency distribution across all haplotypes did not reveal any shifts in base composition, so as
to hint at a pseudogenization (i.e. the process leading to
loss of function of a locus following duplication or transposition), which is mostly expected for coding loci (graph
not shown). Up to date, shifts in base composition of Dloop Numts have not been studied, as cases of noncoding
Numts have rarely been reported [4,9,10,16-18].
3. Phylogenetic analyses of these results using the alignment in Figure 2 are shown in Figure 3. Sequences CH.1.4
and CB.1.1 were not the most divergent, but they were the
only ones sharing a TCCCC insertion at positions 198–
202. All phylogenetic analyses -albeit with moderate support- identified two main clades, each with various subclades. The most haplotype-rich clade grouped clones
MMO, CHL, CBL, EL, E, OMTai, and a few CB and CH
sequences. All three optimality criteria provided strong
support (1.00/99.4/100 for BI/ML/MP; see Figure 3 for BI/
ML; MP trees not shown) for the clade containing clone
sequences CH.1.3, CH.1.9, CH.1.1, and CH.1.2. There
was no consensus reached, though, on the phylogenetic

position of clades (CB.1.69, E.1.5) and (CHB, CB.1.3).
Clade (CB.1.69, E.1.5) was associated with the highly
divergent hair clone sequences (CH) with the exception of
weighted parsimony that placed it at a basal position
within the most haplotype-rich clade. The position of
clade (CHB, CB.1.3) was basal but ambiguous, as Bayesian inference and weighted parsimony placed it with the
larger clade, while ML placed it with the divergent CH
haplotypes, and unweighted parsimony differentiated it
as a third clade by itself. We believe this inconsistent clustering is a consequence of the low support at the root of
the main clades (53–83% in all methods). Overall, the
relationships among haplotypes appear more or less consistent across optimality criteria by maintaining the two
main clades with some highly supported subclades.
4. The Pairwise Relative Rates Test identified clones
CH.1.3, CH.1.9, CH.1.1, and CH.1.2 to be evolving faster
than all other sequences, when compared to all other
clones, using the serow as outgroup (see Additional file
3). The RRT also returned significant results for other
sequences of the divergent clade, but also for haplotypes
of the greater clade. For instance, CH.1.4 evolved at a different rate than same-tissue CH.1.6, CB, or CHB -to name
a few- and CB.1.1's rate differed from that of other blood
CB and E clones.
5. The unusual haplotype structure and phylogenetic
divergence of some CH hair clones, as well as their different evolutionary rate, suggest these sequences are control
region fragments transposed to the nucleus. That said,
there are other haplotypes that exhibit signs of differential
evolution, although they are placed in the main clade and
their base composition seems standard, such as CH.1.4,
CB.1.1, CHB, CB.1.3. Among the sequences from the long
fragment, not all of the clone sequences grouped together.

mtDNA sequence or for rDNA the proper secondary structure [19,20].

In sum, our results are similar to those obtained by Thalmann et al. [9], who noted that, in gorillas, NuMts were
distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree of HVR
sequences. These authors concluded that non-invasive
studies relying on the portion of HVR1 examined would
not yield reliable results.

• Overlapping PCR strategies using multiple independent
primers operates on the principle that the chances of
detecting the same NuMts with independent PCR primers
is low. However, this method is not infallible [9].

Although we were able to identify a set of clones as more
divergent even than the outgroup Nemorhaedus swinhoei,
we were not able to cluster together all clones with unusual sequences, a proof that NuMts may be distributed
throughout the phylogenetic tree, rendering phylogenetic
detection not the most powerful diagnostic tool.

Discussion
NuMts are not an insurmountable problem if one is dealing with high quality DNA. Several methods have been
suggested for determining correct sequences when confronted by NuMts:
• For mtDNA coding sequences, it is possible to determine
the organellar sequence by determining the transcribed

• Phylogenetic and substitution rate analyses can be used
to identify NuMts. However, this may only detect highly
divergent NuMts and, as seen in this study, the distribution of sequences did not clearly separate a NuMt clade
from an organellar mtDNA clade (Figure 3).
• Amplifying large fragments of mtDNA that overlap from
high quality genomic DNA or samples enriched for
mtDNA are a good way of detecting organellar DNA. Most
NuMts are short, containing one or a few genes. This technique, however, requires a source of high quality DNA or
the possibility of enriching samples for mtDNA.
By contrast, studies of ancient DNA or non-invasive sampling often require the use of DNA of substandard quality.
In addition, the hypervariable region is often particularly
critical for determining variation among individuals that
Page 6 of 10

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:67

are closely related (i.e., intrapopulation variation). The
results of this study demonstrate that even when high
quality DNA from fresh blood extractions is available, difficulties in establishing the correct organellar mtDNA
sequence may be encountered. In fact, in our example the
modern samples proved to be more intractable than the
ancient DNA samples.
In the muskoxen samples reviewed here, the frequency of
NuMt detection varied among the individuals tested.
However, unlike the case with proboscideans [7], both
hair and blood from the same individual yielded abundant NuMt sequences. NuMts were also detected, though
at lower frequency, in the ancient DNA samples. This
makes sense: since only the highest-copy DNA generally
remains in significant amounts, the incidence of NuMts
should be reduced in ancient samples. Indeed, this inference remains the basic justification for the continued use
of mtDNA in most ancient DNA studies. However,
because NuMts have also been detected in nuclear DNA
derived from ancient samples, there is no avoiding the
conclusion that NuMts are a potential problem for all
sample types, irrespective of their origin or condition [21].
Direct sequencing of the PCR products would not alleviate the problem: if a NuMt predominates, then the NuMt
sequence will be retrieved. Furthermore, the presence of
multiple distinct sequences would make direct sequencing impossible. In our example, the largest fragment
sequenced demonstrated inconsistent homology with the
8 muskox haplotypes deposited in GenBank [15], despite
the fact that the same primers were used throughout.
Because of this inconsistency, even though one of the
blood samples yielded matching sequences in all overlapping PCR fragments, it cannot be definitively stated that
the sequence represented is actually organellar mtDNA.
Nor did phylogenetic analysis distinguish NuMts from
organellar mtDNA sequences.

Conclusion
Mitochondrial sequences have proven to be useful in a
wide variety of contexts. However, there are some often
overlooked risks associated with their use. We have
observed significant differences in the retrieval of NuMts
from modern and ancient DNA samples of the muskox
Ovibos moschatus. These differences, which occurred
among independent PCRs using different primer pairs,
among individuals and among tissues of individuals,
challenge our ability to correctly characterize organellar
mtDNA sequences in this taxon. Ovibos joins proboscideans, some primates, and several other major taxa in which
the high incidence of NuMts complicates proper sequence
identification. Caution should be exercised in interpreting
the results of any mtDNA study that relies on limited or
degraded DNA samples or single PCR primer pairs. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/67

extreme cases, the pervasive presence of NuMts may
render some loci useless for the purpose of modern and
ancient DNA studies.

Methods
Samples and DNA extraction
Ancient muskox samples OMTai 14, 38, 39, 46, 95, and
23564, localities, carbon dates and museum identification numbers are described in detail in our previous study
(see Table 1 in [12]). Hair and blood from a modern
muskox male was sampled from Tierpark Hellabrunn
(Munich, Germany). Blood from a second muskox was
kindly provided by E. Willerslev (University of Copenhagen, Denmark). Ancient samples were extracted as
described in [22]. Modern blood and hair extractions were
performed using QIAamp Mini DNA kits (QIAGEN, Germany) and eluted in 500 µl of distilled water.
PCR, cloning, and sequencing
PCR primers used in this study were designed to amplify
the mitochondrial HVR of muskoxen based on the
sequences for Ovibos in GenBank [15]. To amplify the
entire HVR from modern muskoxen, the primers from
[15] were used. For both ancient and modern DNA two
overlapping PCR fragments were used to obtain an
approximately 276 bp fragment of the HVR. Primer
sequences were HV.1L 5'-AAAGAATTCTGCTGTCATACATTT-3', HV.1H 5'-AAAGGATCCAGGGATGAGTGTGTT-3',
HV.2L
5'AAAGAATTCTATCATATATGCTCTTCGTA-3', HV.2H 5'AAAGGATCCTATCTTGGTTGGAGTGCAGA-3'. Ancient
DNA PCR buffer and reaction conditions are described in
[22]. Modern PCR reactions were performed using 0.8
pmol of each primer and Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega). The re-amplification procedure, cloning of
PCR products and sequencing of clones was done using
standard methods and has already been described [22].
Alignment and sequence analysis
Sequences were aligned in MUSCLE 3.6 [23] and manually adjusted in Se-Al 2.0a11 [23] before being collapsed
into haplotypes in COLLAPSE 1.2 [24] treating gaps as 5th
state (see Additional file 4). Previously published control
region sequences [15] were also included in the alignment
(GenBank:U47061–U47076). The haplotype alignment
was used in evolutionary analyses. Sequences were submitted to GenBank (GenBank:EF057069–EF057098). The
Taiwanese
serow
Nemorhaedus
swinhoei
(GenBank:AY149639) was used as outgroup, as a closely
related caprine [25].

We attempted to cluster homologous clone sequences, so
as to differentiate true mitochondrial sequences from
Numts, by applying two different classification schemes:
(i) clones were categorized by each muskox individual

Page 7 of 10

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:67

regardless of the number of clones per individual, resembling to a multiple-partitions dataset; the inequality of the
number of clones per individual was corrected by coding
missing clones as partitions with missing data. (ii) clones
were categorized by individual and by tissue type, e.g. hair
(H) and blood (B), knowing from previous research [7]
that hair may be more Numt-rich than blood. The homology assessment analysis was done in POY [26] using the chromosome -n2reorder command.
In recent years, evidence has burgeoned for the occurrence
of mitochondrial recombination in a wide variety of animal taxa [27,28], and more specifically in members of the
family Bovidae, such as Cephalophus spp. (duikers), Ovis
spp. (sheep), Tragelaphus spp., and Kobus spp (see Table 1
in [28]). Recombination should not produce misleading
interpretations of populations with limited or nonexistent
gene flow; however, it can mimic the traces of population
size expansion, underestimate divergence times, and
mask ancient polymorphisms as recurring mutations
[27,29]. In the particular case of caprines, in which
mtDNA recombination is an acknowledged issue [28], it
should be routine to search for evidence of recombination
before making evolutionary inferences.
In order to examine the possibility of detecting HVR
recombinant sequences, we employed several recombination detection methods, such as Bootscan, Chimaera,
Geneconv, MaxChi, RDP, and SiScan, as implemented in
the program RDP2 2b08 [30], using the automated scan
option, and 1,000 permutations and 1,000 bootstrap replicates where applicable.
We tried to detect changes in base composition across
sequences by plotting the relative compositions of individual bases, purines, and pyrimidines across all haplotypes, using a sliding window of 50 bp and a step of 10 bp
in Treefinder [31].
The substitution model suggested by MrModeltest 2.2
[32] in conjunction with PAUP* 4b10 [33] using Akaike's
Information Criterion (AIC) [34] was the general timereversible model [35-37] with substitution rates following
a Γ-distribution (GTR+Γ4) with shape parameter α =
0.3732.
Bayesian inference (BI) of phylogeny was performed for
all haplotypes of the short alignment in MrBayes 3.1.2
[38, 39] on a 9-node dual G5 processor (2.0 GHz, 18 GB
RAM) XServe cluster at AMNH, using the model suggested
by MrModeltest (GTR+Γ, with a flat prior on base frequencies following a Dirichlet distribution and six rate categories). Two simultaneous analyses were run for 107
generations each, on two separate occasions, starting from
different random trees, and the resulting trees were saved

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/67

every 1000 generations. One "cold" and three "heated"
chains were run with heating scheme fine-tuning; temperature parameters ranging from 2 to 0.03 were used and the
latter was chosen, as it was leading to better mixing. The
heat applied to all chains except for the "cold" one, was
0.97, 0.94, and 0.92, respectively. Successful chain swaps
were in the range of 33–75%. Following visual inspection
in Tracer 1.3 [40], stationarity of the Ln-likelihood (i.e.
the Ln-probability of the data given the parameter values)
was reached before 106 generations. Similarly, we examined the average standard deviation of split frequencies
and confirmed it approached zero (0.003418), indicating
a satisfactory run length. Subsequently, the first 1,000
trees were discarded as burn-in and a 50% majority-rule
consensus tree [41] was built with 18,002 optimal trees.
The proportion of resulting trees presenting a given clade,
in other words, the posterior probability of this clade, represents clade support in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis
[42].
Phylogeny was also estimated in a maximum likelihood
(ML) framework in Treefinder using the GTR+Γ4 model.
Approximate bootstrap support was estimated by applying the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test with RELL
approximation [43] to all local rearrangements around an
edge on the topology (also referred to as edge support or
LRSH) and 50,000 replicates. For every edge on the tree,
all its adjacent branch nearest-neighbor interchanges are
computed and edge lengths are re-estimated by fixing all
other parameters, and finally the SH test is applied. LRSH
support values are the complement of the worst p-values
from the SH test. A support value of 99 means this clade
is significant at the 0.01 level, a value of 95 at the 0.05
level, and so on.
We employed unweighted and weighted maximum parsimony (MP) in PAUP* with a heuristic search using 100
random addition sequence replicates and TBR branch
swapping. Given the number of transitions and transversions as calculated in MacClade 4.08 [44] (88 transitions
and 22 transversions) yielding a transition-transversion
ratio of 4:1, we downweighted transitions four times
using a step-matrix. In unweighted parsimony, gaps were
treated as missing data and as a 5th state. Clade support
was provided with 500 bootstrap replicates [45] and strict
consensus trees [46] were built using all equally most parsimonious trees.
We used a Pairwise Relative Rates Test [47] to detect
sequences with significantly different evolutionary rates,
as implemented in HyPhy 0.99b [48] with a GTR+Γ substitution model and a "Local" model. Given a predefined
outgroup sequence, the maximum likelihood estimate
(MLE) for each 3-taxon tree is calculated, followed by the
MLE calculation for the 3-taxon trees with evolutionary

rates along the ingroup sequences constrained to be
equal. A likelihood-ratio test (LRT) is then performed to
examine if rates are equal or independent. The desired
precision (absolute error) in the calculation of the Ln-likelihood value was set at 0.001.
