Abstract
Background: Death receptors on the cell surface and the interacting cytosolic molecules,
adaptors and initiator caspases, are essential as core components of the extrinsic apoptotic
signaling pathway. While the apoptotic machinery governing the extrinsic signaling pathway is well
characterized in mammals, it is not fully understood in fish.
Results: We identified and characterized orthologs of mammalian Fas, FADD and caspase-8 that
correspond to the death receptor, adaptor and initiator caspase, from the Medaka fish (Oryzias
latipes). Medaka Fas, caspase-8 and FADD exhibited protein structures similar to that of their
mammalian counterparts, containing a death domain (DD), a death effector domain (DED) or both.
Functional analyses indicated that these molecules possess killing activity in mammalian cell lines
upon overexpression or following activation by apoptotic stimuli, suggesting similar pro-apoptotic
functions in the extrinsic pathway as those in mammals. Genomic sequence analysis revealed that
the Medaka fas (tnfrsf6), fadd and caspase-8 (casp8) genes are organized in a similar genomic
structure as the mammalian genes. Database search and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the fas
gene, but not the fadd and casp8 genes, appear to be present only in vertebrates.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that the core components necessary for the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway are evolutionarily conserved in function and structure across vertebrate species. Based on
these results, we presume the mechanism of apoptosis induction via death receptors was
evolutionarily established during the appearance of vertebrates.

Background
Apoptosis, a major form of cell death, is a significant biological phenomenon that removes unnecessary, superfluous, damaged or harmful cells in multicellular organisms.
Apoptosis is important for tissue morphogenesis during

development, maintenance of homeostasis in adulthood,
and defense and immune responses [1-5]. In apoptosis,
activation of a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases induces the proteolytic cleavage of many critical
proteins, leading to cell suicide [6]. In mammals, 15 casPage 1 of 15

pases have been identified. Of these, caspases-2, -8, -9 and
-10 play roles as initiators, while caspases-3, -6 and -7
function as downstream effectors. The activation of effector caspases is the converging point of two major signal
pathways: the extrinsic pathway initiated by ligation of
cell surface receptors called "death receptors", including
Fas (APO-1/CD95) and receptors for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and the
intrinsic pathway triggered by cytochrome c release from
mitochondria into the cytosol.
The extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway following Fas
ligation has been well characterized [7,8]. Oligomerization of Fas by its natural ligand or an agonistic antibody
recruits the adaptor molecule FADD (Fas-associated death
domain protein, also termed MORT1) [9,10] to the death
domain (DD) of the Fas intracellular region. Procaspase8 (also known as FLICE/MACH1/Mch5), which is an inactive zymogen, associates in turn with FADD by interactions between their death effector domains (DED)
[11,12]. Within the Fas-FADD-procaspase-8 complex,
called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) [13],
procaspase-8 undergoes auto-cleavage to convert to an
active form. Through cleavage, activated caspase-8 activates downstream effector caspases and Bid, a member of
the Bcl-2 family, eventually leading to cell death [14-16].
Deficiency in caspase-8 leads to suppression of Fas-mediated apoptosis [17-19].
Although most studies examining the extrinsic apoptosis
pathway have utilized mammalian systems, homologs of
the apoptosis signaling molecules, including death receptors and caspases, have recently been identified in
zebrafish (Danio rerio), including two death receptors, the
zebrafish hematopoietic death receptor (ZH-DR) and the
ovarian TNFR (OTR) [20,21]. Caspase-3 and two additional caspases that are homologous to human caspases-1
and -5 have been characterized in zebrafish [22,23]. Caspases-3, -6, -7 and -9 are also identified and characterized
in salmon and sea bass [24,25]. Several genes with homology to mammalian regulators of apoptosis, including caspase-8, bid and fadd, have been identified in the zebrafish
[26-28]. Thus, the apoptotic machinery appears to be conserved between fish and mammals. No extensive functional analyses of these apoptotic regulators have been
performed in fish.
To understand the general mechanisms regulating cell
death in vertebrates, we studied the apoptotic machinery
governing the extrinsic signaling pathway in fish. In this
study, we identified and characterized orthologs of mammalian Fas, FADD and caspase-8 that might be indispensable for extrinsic apoptotic signaling in Medaka fish
(Oryzias latipes). We report that these molecules act as proapoptotic molecules and are able to substitute for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/141

functions of their mammalian counterparts in mammalian cells. These results suggest the evolutionary conservation between fish and mammals of the core components
essential for the extrinsic pathway. We also discuss the
development of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway
in conjunction with the appearance of vertebrates during
evolution.

Results
Primary structure of Medaka Fas, FADD, and Casp8
molecules
We searched the GenBank DNA database for the fish
homologs of mammalian FAS (TNFRSF6), FADD and caspase-8 (CASP8), three essential components of Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling. We identified an expressed
sequence tag (EST) clone ([GenBank: AU176749]) similar
to FAS, an EST clone ([GenBank: AU242372]) similar to
FADD and two EST clones ([GenBank: BJ006125] and
[GenBank: AV670945]) similar to CASP8 in the Medaka
cDNA library. Sequencing of these EST clones confirmed
that the full-length cDNAs encoded open reading frames
of 306, 192, and 481 amino acids, exhibiting homology
to Fas, FADD and caspase-8, respectively, by a BLAST
search [29]. Protein structure analysis using the Pfam
database [30] showed that the predicted Fas-like molecule
contained a DD in the cytoplasmic region, the FADD-like
molecule possessed both DED and DD, while the caspase8-like molecule contained two DEDs and a protease
domain. Therefore, these proteins might be orthologs to
mammalian Fas, FADD and caspase-8; we termed the
molecules encoded by these cDNA clones Medaka Fas,
FADD and caspase-8. Alignments of the Medaka and
human Fas, FADD and caspase-8 molecules revealed 24%,
34% and 34% identity and 42%, 52% and 52% similarity
at the amino acid sequence level, respectively (Figure 1).
Comparison of Medaka Fas to the zebrafish death receptors, zebrafish hematopoietic death receptor (ZH-DR) and
ovarian tumor necrosis factor receptor (OTR) [20,21]
identified 22% and 20% identity at the amino acid level,
respectively. These results suggest that Medaka Fas is more
similar to human Fas than to fish ZH-DR and OTR. Thus,
we identified structurally similar molecules potentially
orthologous to mammalian Fas, FADD and caspase-8,
core components of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, in the Medaka fish.
Genomic structure of the Medaka fas, fadd and casp8
genes
To confirm that the isolated Medaka Fas, FADD and caspase-8 are orthologs of their mammalian counterparts, we
examined the genomic structure of the fas (tnfrsf6), fadd
and caspase-8 (casp8) orthologous genes in fish, mammals
and birds. By comparing the genomic and the cDNA
sequences, we determined the organization of the Medaka
fas, fadd and casp8 genes. The Medaka fas gene consisted of

9 exons and 8 introns, corresponding to those in the
human and chicken FAS gene with coincident splice junction sites (Figures 2A, 2B). The nucleotide sequences of
the exon-intron boundaries in the Medaka fas gene [see
Additional file 1] completely conformed to the GT-AG
rule [31]. The Medaka fadd gene possessed two exons,
identical to that of the human gene (Figure 2C). Additionally, search of the GenBank and Ensembl genome databases revealed that the fadd genes in the human (Homo
sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), chicken (Gallus gallus),
West African clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) and two species of fish, stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and
zebrafish (Danio rerio) consisted of two exons (Figure 2D).
In the Medaka fadd gene, the GT-AG rule was also
observed at the exon-intron boundaries [see Additional
file 2]. By comparing genomic sequences to the obtained
Medaka casp8 cDNA sequence, we confirmed that the
casp8 gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns (Figures 2E,
2F). The nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron boundaries of the Medaka casp8 gene agree with the GT-AG rule
[see Additional file 3]. The genomic organization of the
Medaka casp8 gene was similar to that of the human and
chicken CASP8 genes with mostly coincident splice junction sites, but additional exons comprising a portion of
the first DED and the protease domain were present in the
Medaka casp8 gene (Figure 2F). We also determined the
genomic structure of the stickleback and zebrafish casp8
genes, and detected additional exons in the stickleback
casp8 gene but not the zebrafish casp8 gene (Figure 2F).
This corresponded to the phylogenetic relationships, indicating that Medaka and stickleback are more closely
related to each other than either of them is to zebrafish
[32]. Thus, these conserved structures of the Fas, FADD
and Casp8 genes within vertebrates strongly suggest that
these genes share their origin respectively.
Genomic organization of the Medaka fas, fadd and casp8
genes
To understand the evolutionary divergence or conservation of the core molecular components required for the
extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, we next examined
the genomic location of the fas gene in vertebrates by
computational analysis. The human FAS gene localizes to
chromosome 10 (Chr. 10), according to LocusLink (Figure 3A). Search of the zebrafish genome sequence in the
Ensembl database identified a fas-like gene on scaffold862
that was highly homologous to the human and Medaka
FAS genes [see Additional file 4]. Within the assembly,
this scaffold corresponds to chr. 17, and we found a syntenic relationship between this zebrafish genomic region
and the human chromosomal segment including the
human FAS gene. Putative orthologs of PAPSS2, PTEN
and IFIT2, which co-localize with the FAS gene on human
Chr. 10 are found in close proximity to the fas-like gene in
the zebrafish genome. This gene organization was also

Analyses
Analyses of the genomic structure of the Medaka fas, fadd and casp8 genes. (A) Genomic organization of the Medaka
and human FAS (TNFRSF6) genes. Both Medaka and human FAS are composed of nine exons. The coding and non-coding
regions are indicated by black and white boxes, respectively. The majority of the exons of the Medaka fas gene were identified
in the genomic sequence from scaffold1622 (exon 1: 72, 135-72, 214), scaffold28293 (exons 3 and 4: 5, 721-5, 396; exons 7–9:
4, 964-2, 872) and scaffold100324 (exons 5 and 6: 405-121). (B) Comparison of the splice junction sites in Medaka, human and
chicken Fas. Arrowheads on amino acid alignment indicate the splice junction sites in the Medaka, human and chicken genes,
respectively. (C) Genomic organization of the Medaka and human FADD genes. Both the Medaka fadd and human FADD genes
contain two exons. The black and white boxes correspond to the coding and non-coding regions, respectively. The fadd gene
was detected from the genomic sequence (23, 960-15, 238) of scaffold7231. (D) Comparison of the splice junction sites of
FADD from several vertebrates. An arrowhead indicates the splice junction site, defined by the comparison of the cDNA and
the genomic sequences of human (H. sapiens), mouse (M. musculus), chicken(G. gallus), frog (X. tropicalis), zebrafish (D. rerio),
stickleback (G. aculeatus) and Medaka (O. latipes). (E, F) Genomic organization of the Medaka and human CASP8 genes. The
Medaka casp8 gene was identified in the genomic sequence (1, 102, 834-1, 096, 083) of scaffold169 (E). The Medaka casp8 gene
is composed of 12 exons, while the human CASP8 gene is 9 exons. The coding and non-coding regions are indicated by black
and white boxes, respectively. Comparison of the splice junction sites in Medaka, stickleback, zebrafish and human caspase-8 is
shown in (F). Arrowheads on amino acid alignment indicate the splice junction sites in the Medaka, stickleback, zebrafish and
human genes, respectively. Abbreviations: CRD, cysteine repeat domain; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; TM,

conserved in the chicken chr. 6 and at least partially in the
Medaka and fugu (Takifugu rubripes) genomes (Figure 3A).
In addition, comparative mapping analysis predicted the
presence of the fas gene in the frog genome [see Additional files 5, 6]. Therefore, the genomic organization
around the Fas gene locus exhibits synteny throughout
vertebrates.
Genomic organizations around the FADD gene were also
well conserved among the vertebrate genomes (Figure

3B). In the human genome, the CCND1, ORAOV1,
FGF19, FGF4, FGF3, TMEM16A, FADD, PPFIA1 and
CTTN genes are encoded in this order on Chr. 11. This
gene order is also conserved in the chicken genome. In the
fish genomes, the gene order from ccnd1 to fadd is also
conserved [33], although the ppfia1 and cttn genes, which
are 3' neighbors of the fadd gene, were replaced with npsn
and mtch2. The only exception we found was the X. tropicalis genome. In this genome, the chromosomal segment
from oraov1 to tmem16a is translocated and thus the

Chromosomal analyses of the Medaka fas, fadd and casp8 genes and their orthologs
Figure 3
Chromosomal analyses of the Medaka fas, fadd and casp8 genes and their orthologs. (A) A physical map of the
region containing the FAS gene was generated for human, chicken and fish. In human and chicken, the FAS gene localizes to a
locus on Chr. 10q24.1 or chr. 6. In Medaka, the fas gene resides close to the pten gene in the genome. In the zebrafish genome,
the fas-like gene is located between the ptena and ifit2 genes. The fugu fas-like gene is also found near the pten gene. (B) A physical map of the region containing the FADD gene was generated for human, chicken, frog and fish. In human and chicken, the
FADD gene localizes to a locus on Chr. 11 or chr. 5. The Medaka fadd gene is located between the tmem16a and npsn genes on
chr. 3. In stickleback, the region containing the fadd gene shows a similar synteny. (C) A physical map of the region containing
the casp8 gene was generated for Medaka, fugu and stickleback. The casp8 gene localizes between the card-casp8 and mcm6
genes in both Medaka and fugu genomes. In the stickleback genome, the casp8 and card-casp8 genes also localize in tandem. (D)
Multialignment of the Medaka Casp8-like molecule (CARD-Casp8) and its homologs identified in fish. The card-casp8 genes
from fugu, catfish ([GenBank: AY555576]) and zebrafish were identified by database search. Human ICEBERG ([GenBank:
P57730]), which is a CARD-only molecule, was cited for reference. Identical and similar amino acids in all alignments are indicated in black and shaded boxes, respectively. The underline and a box indicate the CARD motif and the protease domain,
respectively. Asterisks represent the amino acids essential for catalytic activity.

gene order in this genome is ccnd1-fadd-ppfia1-cttn. This
data suggests the overall syntenic conservation of the
genomic regions around the fadd gene within the vertebrates and that a chromosomal rearrangement event in a
genomic region downstream of the fadd gene has
occurred after the divergence of fish and other vertebrates
(the rearranged organizations are also conserved in each
lineage).
We investigated the genomic organization of the casp8
gene in fish and other vertebrates, and the chromosomal
segment around this gene is conserved between fish and
other vertebrates [34]. In the Medaka genome, a putative
ortholog of the mcm6 gene, which localizes close to the
CASP8 gene on human Chr. 6, resides near the casp8 gene
(Figure 3C). The orientation and position of casp8 and
mcm6 genes were consistent with those identified in the
fugu genome database. Moreover, upstream of the casp8
gene, a casp8-like gene was identified with a region encoding the protease domain possessing the caspase specific
active site QACQG (Figure 3D). The predicted amino acid
sequence of the Casp8-like molecule was highly similar to
the protease domain of mammalian caspase-8 proteins
(Casp8) by BLASTP searches. Phylogenetic studies also
suggested that the protease domain of the Casp8-like molecule is most similar to that of CASP8 but not to that of
other caspases [34]. The putative orthologous genes for
this Medaka casp8-like gene were also found in the fugu,
stickleback and zebrafish genomes, localizing next to the
casp8 gene (Figure 3C and [34]). These gene products similar to Casp8 lack two DED motifs in its N-terminus but
contain a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which
were revealed by the InterProScan program using the
Interpro database (Figure 3D). In the present study, this
casp8-like gene was tentatively termed as card-casp8. Therefore, we suggest that the card-casp8 gene is derived from a
copy occurred by a tandem duplication of the ancestral
casp8 gene in the fish lineage, and that one of the duplicated copies might acquire a CARD and probably a new
function at the same time.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis of Fas, FADD and Casp8
Domain organizations, genomic structures and syntenies
between the vertebrate genomes strongly suggest that
these Medaka genes identified in this study are true
orthologs for Fas, FADD and Casp8. Molecular phylogenetic analyses for these genes also reinforced the orthologies of these genes. For constructing a molecular
phylogenetic tree for FAS and FADD proteins, we used Fas
and FADD sequences manually predicted from the
chicken, zebrafish and stickleback genomes together with
published catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), frog, human and
mouse Fas and FADD sequences [9,10,35-40] [see Additional file 7]. A molecular phylogenetic tree for the Fas
and FADD families based on an alignment of the death
domain indicated that Medaka Fas and FADD were most
similar to fish Fas and FADD, respectively (Figure 4A). The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/141

generated tree suggests that Medaka Fas is closest to
zebrafish Fas-like molecule (bootstrap value = 44%), and
supports its orthology for Fas proteins encoded in the
genome of amphibians and amniotes (bootstrap value =
61%). Additionally, we could not find any typical death
receptors bearing a DD in invertebrates from the public
databases (data not shown). This was supported by
reports describing no orthologs of the death receptors in
spite of extensive screens of decoded genomes, even in the
genome of Ciona intestinalis, a close relative of vertebrates
[41,42]. Therefore, these lines of evidence suggest that the

(Danio rerio) were included in this tree. (B) Multialignment of

death receptor such as Fas appears early during vertebrate
evolution.
Similarly, the molecular phylogenetic tree suggested that
fish FADD proteins including Medaka FADD are monophyletic (bootstrap value = 84%), and these proteins are
orthologous for FADD proteins encoded in the genome of
amphibians and amniotes (bootstrap value = 78%). However, alignment of the C-terminal amino acid sequences
of these FADD molecules revealed diversity among mammals and other vertebrates including fish (Figure 4B). In
the C-terminal portion of the molecule neighboring the
DD, human and mouse FADD are phosphorylated at Ser
residues (194 in human and 191 in mouse) for the regulation of mitosis [43,44]. This C-terminal extension is not
present in birds, frogs, or fish. A gene encoding a putative
FADD is also found in an ascidia, Molgula tectiformis.
Although the Molgula FADD molecule certainly possesses
both DED and DD motifs, it is highly divergent from that
of vertebrates (Figure 4A). Moreover, a gene for FADD was
identified in Drosophila, but the structure of Drosophila
FADD is distinct from those of chordate FADD molecules
because of lacking a definite DED [45]. Therefore, the origin of FADD, which might be present in a common ancestor of chordates, is older than that of Fas, which may have
arisen in the vertebrate lineage. Similarly, Medaka casp8 is
suggested to be a member of the caspase-8 and caspase-10
family, (caspase-10 is a putative paralogous gene of caspase-8). Thus, the genes encoding core components of the
extrinsic signaling pathway, Fas, FADD and Casp8, are
present in the fish genome but are not completely in the
non-vertebrate chordate and other invertebrate genomes.
Pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka Fas, FADD and Casp8
As the predicted amino acid sequences of Medaka Fas,
FADD and Casp8 exhibit homology to their mammalian
counterparts, these proteins likely play an equally critical
role in the regulation of apoptosis. To confirm the universal function of Fas, FADD and Casp8 in vertebrates, we
investigated the killing activity of these Medaka molecules
following exogenous expression in mammalian cells. We
generated several expression constructs coexpressing
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Figure 5A)
and transiently introduced them into mammalian cell
lines. The cell viability of transfectants expressing Medaka
molecules was examined by monitoring EGFP expression
by microscopy. The pME18S-h/oFas and pME18S-hFAS
plasmids, carrying the chimeric h/oFas gene and human
FAS cDNA, respectively, or the control pME18S empty
vector were cotransfected with a construct carrying the egfp
gene into mouse NIH3T3 cells. After 48 h, transfected cells
were stimulated with the agonistic anti-human FAS antibody CH11, a potent apoptotic stimulant specific for
human FAS-expressing cells [46], for 14 h. The viability of
transfectants bearing the control empty vector was unaffected by the presence of CH11, which does not recognize
mouse Fas on NIH3T3 cells (Figure 5B, panel b). In con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/141

trast, treatment with CH11 induced cell death in transfectants expressing chimeric h/oFas molecules. Both a
reduction in the numbers of EGFP-positive cells and an
increase in the numbers of apoptotic bodies were
observed (Figure 5B, panels d and e), comparable to those
changes seen in human FAS-expressing transfectants (Figure 5B, panel g). To confirm that the cell death induced by
chimeric h/oFas is apoptotic cell death, we examined caspase-3 (Casp3) activation, which occurs during apoptosis,
in transfectants. The pME18S-h/oFas or pME18S-hFAS
plasmid was cotransfected with a construct carrying the
lbr-egfp fusion gene into NIH3T3 cells. After 48 h, transfected cells were stimulated with or without CH11 for 12
h. Activation of Casp3 in cells expressing EGFP in the
nucleus was analyzed by immunocytochemical staining
with an anti-cleaved Casp3 antibody. Following proteolytic processing of the inactive zymogen, Casp3 forms
subunits and becomes active. Following treatment with
CH11, we detected activated Casp3 in EGFP-positive cells
coexpressing either h/oFas or hFAS (Figure 5C). However,
no Casp3 activation was observed in EGFP-negative or
untreated cells (Figure 5C). These data indicate that chimeric h/oFas is a functional molecule with killing activity;
the putative death domain in Medaka Fas cytoplasmic tail
is capable of transmitting apoptotic signals to mammalian cells in response to exogenous stimuli.
To test the pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka FADD, we
transfected pME18S-Flag/oFADD-EGFP into two mammalian cell lines, human HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells, in the presence or absence of
the pan-caspase inhibitor, carbobenzoyl-Val-Ala-Aspfluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) (Figure 5D). As HeLa
cells preserve the Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway, they are suitable for examining the potency of proapoptotic molecules such as FADD and caspase-8. Exogenous expression of Medaka FADD induced cell death in
HeLa transfectants, resulting in reductions in the numbers
of EGFP-positive cells associated with increased apoptotic
bodies (Figure 5D, panel a). The addition of zVAD-fmk,
however, inhibited the killing activity of Medaka FADD,
permitting the survival of the majority of EGFP-positive
cells (Figure 5D, panel b). Using MEF cells isolated from
both wild-type and Casp8-deficient embryos [47], we
examined the pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka FADD. We
assumed that Casp8-deficient MEF cells, but not wild-type
MEF cells, are unable to transmit apoptotic signals triggered by Medaka FADD. Indeed, ectopically expressed
Medaka FADD induced cell death in wild-type MEFs, as
evidenced by the reduced numbers of EGFP-positive cells
and the appearance of apoptotic bodies (Figure 5D, panel
c). In contrast, Medaka FADD failed to induce cell death
in Casp8-deficient MEF cells, as the majority of EGFP-positive cells survived and retained normal morphology (Figure 5D, panel d). To confirm the pro-apoptotic activity of
Medaka FADD, we examined the DNA content of cells
expressing Medaka FADD by flow cytometry (Figure 5F).

were washed, fixed, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Viable cells were defined as EGFP-positive cells. Surviving cells

staining with PI. The percentage indicates the cellular population with sub-G1 DNA content.

Overexpression of Medaka FADD in HeLa cells increased
the cellular population in a sub-G1 fraction (Figure 5F,
16.0% in panel b), one indicator of apoptosis [48]. In
contrast, coexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecule p35,
a known pan-caspase inhibitor [49], with Medaka FADD
reduced this population of cells (Figure 5F, 3.6% in panel
c). These data indicate that Medaka FADD is able to transmit apoptotic signals into transfected cells via activation
of mammalian caspase-8.
To assess the pro-apoptotic activity of Medaka caspase-8,
the EGFP/oCasp8 fusion protein was expressed in HeLa
cells in the absence or presence of either zVAD-fmk or
cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) (Figure 5E). Exogenous expression of Medaka Casp8 induced cell death in
transfected cells. However, Casp8-induced killing was
inhibited by both zVAD-fmk and CrmA. Following transfection, the number of EGFP-positive cells was reduced
(Figure 5E, panel a), while the number of EGFP-positive
cells increased after culture in zVAD-fmk or following
CrmA coexpression (Figure 5E, panels b and c). As CrmA
acts as a specific inhibitor by blocking the protease activity
of mammalian caspase-8 [50], our data indicate that protease activity is absolutely required for Medaka caspase-8mediated cell death. Aggregates of death-effector filaments, identified in a previous report [51], were observed
in the surviving cells that expressed EGFP/oCasp8 in the
presence of either zVAD-fmk or CrmA (Figure 5E, panel d
and data not shown). As shown in Figure 5F, expression
of Medaka caspase-8 led to an increase in the sub-G1 fraction in transfected HeLa cells, but this was abrogated by
the co-expression of p35 (12.8% and 3.5% in panels d
and e). These data suggest that Medaka caspase-8 is a proapoptotic molecule requiring homotypic oligomerization, a characteristic shared by mammalian DED-containing molecules.

Discussion
In this study, we identified and characterized the DISC
components Fas, FADD and caspase-8 from Medaka fish.
Our determination of the genomic structure of the fas,
fadd and caspase-8 genes revealed that the genomic organization of these genes is preserved between fish and mammals. These gene products also exhibited similar protein
structures and functions to their mammalian counterparts. In cytotoxic assays, Medaka Fas, FADD and caspase8 exhibited pro-apoptotic activity even in mammalian
cells. Thus, these results clearly showed that the apoptotic
machinery downstream of cell surface death receptors is
functional in fish as well as mammals.
Six death receptors have been identified in mammals [52],
and it was assumed that at least one fish ortholog of mammalian death receptors could be found. Indeed, two death
receptors, ZH-DR and OTR have been previously identified in zebrafish [20,21]. A recent report proposed that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/141

they are counterparts of mammalian TRAIL receptors, but
not Fas [28]. In this study, we identified a molecule exhibiting the closest homology to mammalian Fas. We concluded that this molecule is a bone fide fish ortholog for
mammalian Fas by several lines of evidence: its domain
structure (Figure 1), similarity of its genomic structure
(Figure 2), the conservation of synteny of the Fas genecontaining genomic region between humans and Medaka
(Figure 3), a molecular phylogenetical evidence (Figure 4)
and the functionality of the Medaka Fas death domain for
the transmission of apoptotic signals (Figure 5). Thus, fish
possess several death receptors including Fas that show
similar protein structures and potencies to mammalian
receptors. In contrast to the fish, no death receptors containing a DD motif have yet been identified in the insect,
ascidian and sea urchin genomes [41,42,53,54]. Therefore, we argue that death receptors, such as Fas, appear to
be unique to vertebrates (Figure 6). Additionally, further

Summary of evolutionary insights provided in this
study. The constructed molecular phylogenetic trees for
Fas, FADD and Casp8 colored with green, red and blue lines,
respectively, are shown together. Gene rearrangements and
the appearance of divergent genes, domains, or domain
architectures are indicated by an arrow at the appropriate
evolutionary timepoint. Death receptors including Fas appear
to be unique to vertebrates because no orthologs of death
receptors have been identified in the decoded genomes of
non-vertebrates [41,42,53,54]. Gene rearrangements of the
segment including the fadd gene were detected by comparative gene mapping in the present study. In addition, the
extended C-terminal portion of FADD, which is phosphorylated for the regulation of mitosis [43,44], is uniquely
detected in mammals. Early during vertebrate evolution, the
casp8 and related genes arose from tandem duplication
events of an ancestral casp8 gene as described [34]. Based on
our computational analysis, it was hypothesized that the cardcasp8 gene was originally generated in the fish lineage by local
duplication.

analysis in the genome of jawless vertebrates such as lamprey will be helpful for confirming our inference.
Members of the FADD protein family have been identified
and characterized in mammals, amphibians and insects.
Although Drosophila FADD (dFADD, also termed
CG12297-PA) [45] physically interacts with and activates
DREDD, a Drosophila counterpart of caspase-8, it does not
interact with mammalian death receptors or caspase-8 in
mammalian cells [45]. There are no orthologs of the death
receptor in Drosophila [41]. It was recently reported that
dFADD acts in concert with DREDD in immune defenses
against bacterial infections [55,56], indicating a functional difference in FADD molecules between these species. We determined that Medaka FADD is able to induce
apoptosis of mammalian cells. In addition, mammalian
caspase-8 is required for the pro-apoptotic activity of
Medaka FADD (Figure 5), which demonstrates that FADD
function is conserved between fish and mammals. We
previously demonstrated that Xenopus FADD could substitute functionally for mammalian FADD [36]. There is an
evolutional divergence in the function of these proteins
between vertebrates and insects. We identified fadd-like
genes in the ascidian Molgula tectiformis, sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and cnidaria Hydra magnipapillata in
the GenBank database ([see Additional file 7] and data
not shown). The predicted amino acid sequences of these
gene products reveal conservation of the DED and DD,
but not the C-terminal extension present in mammals.
This might be a universal function of FADD that has been
conserved from simple Metazoans to vertebrates during
evolution. We hypothesize that the adaptor molecule
FADD has two functions; one is required for the extrinsic
apoptotic signaling pathway in vertebrates, while the second has not yet been defined, but is broadly conserved in
bilaterian.
In humans, the CASP8, caspase-10 (CASP10) and CFLAR
(also termed c-FLIP) genes, which localize in a cluster at
the same chromosomal region [57], are thought to be
arisen by duplication of an ancestral gene because of their
common unique protein structure consisting of two DEDs
and a protease domain and high similarity in amino acid
sequences. In both birds and amphibians, these casp8,
casp10 and cflar genes, which map to the same chromosome, have been identified [34]. We have searched for
casp10 and cflar genes in fish, identifying casp10-like and
cflar genes in the genomic database of zebrafish, Tetraodon and fugu. In these fish, the casp10 and cflar genes are
uniquely segregated to distinct chromosomes [34]. In
Medaka, the casp10-like and cflar-like genes were also
found in the genome database, but they localized in the
contigs distinct from the casp8 gene (data not shown),
suggesting the chromosomal segregation of these three
genes in Medaka. Interestingly, we identified a gene,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/141

which encodes a protease domain highly similar to that of
Casp8, next to the casp8 gene in the Medaka chromosome
(Figure 3C). Based on the full-length sequence data for the
casp8-like gene, we concluded that this gene represents a
distinct caspase type containing the CARD motif from caspase-8 and caspase-10 (Figure 3D) and termed as cardcasp8. Moreover, this gene product exhibited pro-apoptotic activity similar to Casp8 [see Additional files 5, 8].
Although the present study does not fully address the
function of CARD-Casp8, our data suggest that the casp8
and card-casp8 genes diverged from an ancestral gene by
local duplication (Figures 3, 6 and [34]). The mechanisms
by which caspase-8 and caspase-10 act independently or
compensate for each other in these organisms and by
which cflar regulates the activation of these caspases are
important to understand the biological significance of
these molecules in vertebrates. Further functional analyses
of caspase-8 and its related molecules including CARDCasp8 in fish will help resolve the relationship of caspase
function to the divergence observed throughout evolution.
In the catfish, fas-, fadd- and casp8-like genes have been
identified [35,39]. As the amino acid sequences predicted
from the catfish fas-like and fadd-like genes exhibited 37%
and 43% identities to the Medaka counterparts, these
genes are probably also orthologs of mammalian Fas and
FADD. The functions of these catfish molecules, however,
have not yet been defined. The catfish casp8-like gene is
not likely to be an ortholog of mammalian caspase-8
because this gene product has no DED but possesses a
CARD (Figure 3D). Regardless, our study strongly suggests
the evolutionary conservation of the pro-apoptotic ability
of Fas, FADD and caspase-8, the core components of the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway, in Medaka fish. Our data is
further supported by a recent report indicating that
zebrafish components required for extrinsic pathway
induce cell death in embryos when overexpressed [28].
In addition to the fas, fadd and caspase-8 genes, the caspase3 and bid genes, whose products play roles as effector and
amplifier, respectively, downstream of caspase-8, were
identified in the database ([GenBank: BAC00948], [GenBank: BAC00949], and [GenBank: BJ707272]). The
Medaka fas ligand-like gene was also detected in the
Ensembl
genome
database
([Ensembl:
UTOLAPRE05100113859]), and its predicted amino acid
sequence was highly similar to Fas ligand previously identified in zebrafish and flounder [28,58]. Thus, the molecular machinery required for the extrinsic pathway fully
exists in Medaka fish, and Medaka is a representative
model vertebrate suitable for studies of gene function and
development [59-61]. Medaka will serve as a powerful
tool in which to dissect both the basic mechanisms and

the complexities of apoptosis induction throughout evolution.

Conclusion
Our study clearly demonstrated that Medaka Fas, FADD
and casapse-8 are functional molecules possessing proapoptotic capacity. As shown in Figure 6, Medaka and
probably other fishes have completed these core components essential for the extrinsic pathway while chordates
and other invertebrates lack one or more components in
their genomes. Therefore, it reaches the conclusion that
the apoptotic signaling machinery is evolutionarily conserved throughout vertebrates and this novel apoptotic
system has been established after the divergence between
vertebrates and non-vertebrates.

Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Caspase-8-deficient embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from caspase-8-deficient mouse [47], mouse
NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and human cervical carcinoma HeLa
cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. An
anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody, CH-11, was prepared as described [46]. Anti-cleaved caspase-3 and Alexa
Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly,
MA) and Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR), respectively. The VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI
and the peptide caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk were purchased from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA)
and MBL (Nagoya, Japan), respectively. The pEGFP-C1
and pIRES-EGFP plasmids were purchased from BD-Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).
Computational analyses and DNA sequencing
To search for Medaka homologs of Fas, FADD and caspase-8 in the GenBank database, we utilized the BLAST
program [29] using the human counterparts as a query.
Medaka EST clones corresponding to human FAS
(TNFRSF6), ([GenBank: AU176749]), human FADD
([GenBank: AU242372]) and human caspase-8 (CASP8)
([GenBank: BJ006125] and [GenBank: AV670945]) were
identified. The nucleotide sequences of these four clones
were confirmed for both strands using DyeDeoxyterminator Cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster
City, CA) on automated DNA sequencers (PRISM™ 3100,
Applied Biosystems Inc. and LI-COR 4000, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Similarly, we confirmed the nucleotide sequences of Medaka card-casp8, Xenopus tropicalis fas
and
Molgula
tectiformis
fadd
cDNA
clones
(MF01SSB040F15, IMAGE:8956885 and mtgd021e23),
which were identified by searching the EST databases.

To determine the genomic structure of the Medaka fas,
fadd and casp8 genes, we searched for genomic sequences
of these three genes in the Medaka genome database [62]
created by the National Institute of Genetics and the University of Tokyo. In scaffold28293, scaffold100324 and
scaffold1622, the fas gene was partially detected, while the
fadd and casp8 genes were identified in scaffold7231 and
scaffold169, respectively. By comparison of the genomic
and cDNA sequences, we determined the number of
exons and the exon-intron boundaries in these three
genes. Similarly, we examined the exon-intron boundaries for the human and chicken FAS genes, the human,
mouse, chicken, West African clawed frog and two species
of fish, stickleback and zebrafish FADD genes and the
human, stickleback and zebrafish CASP8 genes by searching the GenBank (genome sequences for human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and cow) and Ensembl [63],
(contig9.25, contig98.102 and contig75.50 for chicken
fas, fadd and casp8, scaffold82 for frog fadd, and contig459
and contig8586 for stickleback fadd and casp8) databases.
We also included the fugu genomic sequence (scaffold263
for casp8), taken from the Ensembl database, in our comparative mapping. The fish npsn (nephrosin) and mtch2
(mitochondrial carrier homolog 2) genes and the human
CCND1 (cyclin D1), CTTN (cortactin), IFIT2 (interferoninduced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2), MCM6
(minichromosome maintenance protein 6), PAPSS2 (3'phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthethase 2),
PPFIA1 {protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, f
polypeptide (PTPRF), interacting protein (liprin), α1},
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and TMEM16A (transmembrane protein
16A) genes and their non-mammalian orthologs, listed in
Supplementary Table S4 [see Additional file 4], were used
to generate the physical maps.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis
To determine the splice acceptor and donor sequences
adjacent to exon 2 of the fas gene, we isolated genomic
DNA from adult fish and amplified the desired sequence
by PCR using following primer sets; to amplify the 1st
intron, we utilized a forward primer (5'-AGTGAAGTTGATCATGGCGAC-3') from the 1st exon and a reverse
primer (5'-CACGTTTTACCGTCGTGTGTGTAG-3') from
the 2nd exon, while to detect the 2nd intron, we used a forward primer (5'-TGGAAGCTACACACACGACGGTAA-3')
from the 2nd exon and a reverse primer (5'-TTCTTCGCAGAAGCCACATTCACC-3') from the 3rd exon. Following
an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, we performed
30 cycles of PCR at 96°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 15 sec and
72°C for 8 min in the presence of LA Taq DNA polymerase (TAKARA Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). Amplified PCR products were subcloned into thepCRII plasmid (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses
The amino acid sequences for the Fas proteins from catfish, chicken, human, mouse and zebrafish published in
the GenBank database were included for analysis as listed
in Supplementary Table S5 [see Additional file 7]. Similarly, we selected the amino acid sequences of the FADD
proteins from catfish, chicken, human, mouse and
zebrafish [see Additional file 7]. In addition, we predicted
the amino acid sequence for FADD from West African
clawed frog and stickleback in the Ensembl genome database [see Additional file 7]. To confirm correct tree construction, we also cited the human, chicken and zebrafish
TRADD (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated
death domain protein) sequences including a death
domain and compared the amino acid sequences of Fas
and FADD in our analysis. We aligned the death domains
of these proteins using T-COFFEE program [64] and manually removed gaps to construct the phylogenetic tree.
Based on this alignment, a molecular phylogenetic tree
was constructed using the neighbor-joining method
implemented in the MEGA program [65,66].
Construction and transfection of expression vectors
To express Medaka FADD and caspase-8 in mammalian
cell lines, we generated two mammalian expression plasmids encoding these proteins. The pME18S-Flag/oFADDEGFP plasmid was generated by cloning the Medaka fadd
cDNA, amplified by PCR, into the modified pME18S plasmid [67] containing a Flag-tag in the 5' region and an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-EGFP in the 3' region.
The pCMV-EGFP/oCasp8 plasmid was created by inserting the Medaka caspase-8 cDNA, amplified by PCR, into
pEGFP-C1. To test the killing activity of Medaka Fas, we
generated a chimeric gene h/oFas by PCR amplification.
The DNA fragment encoding the extracellular region of
human Fas was ligated to the DNA fragment encoding the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of Medaka Fas.
This fragment was cloned into pME18S to generate
pME18S-h/oFas. The viral gene encoding CrmA, the kind
gift of Dr. D. J. Pickup (Duke University), was cloned into
the pCAGGS expression vector [68] to generate pCXCrmA. The pCX-p35 plasmid was generated by cloning
the baculovirus p35 gene into the mammalian expression
vector pCAGGS as described previously [36]. The
phLBR1TM-EGFP plasmid, which encodes a nuclear
fusion protein consisting of LBR and EGFP (a kind gift of
Dr. J. Ellenberg, EMBL), was used for both immunocytochemical and flow cytometric analyses.

Transfection of these plasmid constructs into cells was
performed using LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/141

Cytotoxicity assays
After transfection with pME18S-Flag/oFADD-EGFP or
pCMV-EGFP/oCasp8, HeLa and Casp8-deficient MEF cells
were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 100
µM zVAD-fmk or with or without viral protein CrmA. Following fixation in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde, we
examined the number of EGFP-positive cells by fluorescence microscopy (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany). Magnified fluorescent images of transfectants
were obtained on a confocal laser scanning microscope
(TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems). We transfected the
pME18S-h/oFas and pME18S-hFAS plasmids, which
encode chimeric h/oFas or human FAS, respectively, with
pEGFP-C1 into NIH3T3 cells. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, we examined the killing activity of h/oFas
and human FAS following treatment for 14 h with 500 ng/
ml of anti-human Fas antibody CH11.
Immunocytochemical analysis
To confirm that the h/oFas-mediated death signal activates the apoptotic signaling pathway, we examined caspase-3 activation in transfected cells using an
immunocytochemical method. Briefly, 48 h post-transfection with pME18S-h/oFas or pME18S-hFAS together with
phLBR1TM-EGFP, which was used for detection of transfected cells, NIH3T3 cells were treated for 12 h without or
with 500 ng/ml of CH11 and fixed in PBS containing 4%
paraformaldehide for 10 min. After washing once with
PBS, cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS
for 5 min, washed three times for 5 min each with PBS and
quenched in PBS containing 0.1% sodium borohydride
for 5 min. After washing once with PBS, cells were
immersed in blocking buffer {PBS containing 10% goat
serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)} for 1 h.
Cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with an
anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody in 1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4°C. After washing three times for 5 min each
with PBS, cells were incubated with the fluorescentlylabeled secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594 goat antirabbit antibody) in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h, washed three
times for 5 min each with PBS and mounted with a coverslip using VECTASHIELD mounting medium. Caspase-3
activation in cells expressing EGFP in the nucleus was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan, Carl Zeiss
GmbH, Jena, Germany).
Flow-cytometric analysis
Twenty-four hours after transfection with pME18S-Flag/
oFADD-EGFP or pCMV-EGFP/oCasp8 with or without
pCX-p35, HeLa cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at -20°C
for 1 h as described previously [36]. For selection of transfected and untransfected cells, we co-transfected cells with
phLBR1TM-EGFP. Following fixation, cells were washed
with PBS, treated with RNase A (50 µg/ml) in PBS at 37°C
for 30 min and stained with 50 µg/ml of propidium

iodide (PI) in PBS for 30 min. The DNA content of cells
expressing EGFP in the nuclei was then analyzed by flow
cytometry (XL™, BECKMAN-COULTER, Miami, FL).
