Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic analyses of protein families are used to define the evolutionary
relationships between homologous proteins. The interpretation of protein-sequence phylogenetic
trees requires the examination of the taxonomic properties of the species associated to those
sequences. However, there is no online tool to facilitate this interpretation, for example, by
automatically attaching taxonomic information to the nodes of a tree, or by interactively colouring
the branches of a tree according to any combination of taxonomic divisions. This is especially
problematic if the tree contains on the order of hundreds of sequences, which, given the
accelerated increase in the size of the protein sequence databases, is a situation that is becoming
common.
Results: We have developed PhyloView, a web based tool for colouring phylogenetic trees upon
arbitrary taxonomic properties of the species represented in a protein sequence phylogenetic tree.
Provided that the tree contains SwissProt, SpTrembl, or GenBank protein identifiers, the tool
retrieves the taxonomic information from the corresponding database. A colour picker displays a
summary of the findings and allows the user to associate colours to the leaves of the tree according
to any number of taxonomic partitions. Then, the colours are propagated to the branches of the
tree.
Conclusion: PhyloView can be used at http://www.ogic.ca/projects/phyloview/. A tutorial, the
software with documentation, and GPL licensed source code, can be accessed at the same web
address.

Background
Phylogenetic trees based upon multiple sequence alignments of proteins from many species are commonly used
to determine the evolutionary relationships between
homologous sequences, which can give insights into the
evolution of a protein family and the functional specificity of the members of the family [1].

It is expected that the phylogenetic tree reflects the events
of duplication and speciation of proteins. Through speciation, related proteins in different organisms are generated that reflect the taxonomic relations of those
organisms. However, cases of phylogenetic associations
being at odds with known taxonomy can be interesting
anomalies worthy of investigation, perhaps indicating

levels present in the tree (with number of sequences in each within brackets) that can be expanded and contracted at will. A
colour picker allows the association of a colour with any taxonomic level. Right: interpretation of a tree. In this example, a multiple sequence alignment of putative transcription initiation factor 2, gamma subunit, and related sequences, is used to illustrate
PhyloView (the example is available at the web site). Colouring chosen is: Archaea:red; Bacteria:pink; Cyanobacteria:light pink;
Eukarya:blue; Viridiplantae:green; Mammals:light blue. Repeating phylogenetic structures make obvious the existence of two
subfamilies (IF2G, and a hypothetical IF2P), and the presence of three outliers (top: three GTPases of unknown function,
wrongly included in the alignment). The plant sequence that groups with the Cyanobacteria (IF2C_ARATH) is a chloroplast
IF2G. The eukaryotic members that group with bacteria (IF2M) are mitochondrial IF2Gs. Recent duplications of mammalian
IF2Gs are also apparent.

problems in the generation of the multiple sequence
alignment or events of lateral gene transfer [2]. Also,
events of gene duplication (that may define subfamilies
with subtle variations of the common functional theme of
the family) can be observed by the repetition of a taxonomic structure at multiple places in the tree.

represented in the tree, or of graphically representing arbitrary taxonomic properties of trees, thus allowing the
study of the relation of a phylogenetic tree with the taxonomic relations between the species represented in the
tree. PhyloView was developed in an attempt to address
this limitation and provide a simple and generic means of
doing this.

Unfortunately, available software for rendering phylogenetic trees does not provide a simple means of automatically retrieving taxonomic information for the sequences

Implementation
PhyloView was written as a web application in Perl 5.6.1
using the Perl modules BioPerl [3], Parse::RecDescent,
SVG and CGI. Full source code for the program is available at the PhyloView web site [4], has been deposited at
SourceForge.net [5] and is licensed under the GPL [6].

Results and discussion
Upon initial loading the script provides a form where the
user may upload a phylogenetic tree in Newick (New
Hampshire) format, used by most phylogenetic packages
(e.g., [7]). The tree should contain SwissProt, SpTrembl
[8], or GenBank GI protein identifiers [9] in the leaf node
names. The associated records are then dynamically
retrieved from the appropriate database online over the
internet and the associated taxonomic information is
extracted. Processing times for the initial upload of a tree
vary with the number of sequences in the tree, the load on
the server and the response speed of the public databases
queried. For example, a tree with 600 sequences (which in
our experience is pretty large for a phylogenetic tree) takes
about one minute to load. Subsequent processing times
for the same tree tend to be much shorter as the taxonomic information associated with the protein sequence
identifiers is cached and no further queries of public databases are required.
To allow users to show their own identifiers in the tree, we
use the following internal format for names:
"DBID*YOURID" where DBID is the database identifier
used by PhyloView to extract the taxonomic information,
YOURID is the identifier to be displayed in the tree, and *
is a user defined separator (the default symbol is "/").
Optionally, the DBID can be removed from the rendered
tree leaving the user identifiers.

tie between assignments, the more specific one is given
precedence (for example, Viridiplantae over Eukarya).
Colouring of a given branch only happens if more than
50% of the sequences under that branch belong to a single
taxonomic group with an assigned colour.
Mouse-over of the phylogenetic tree leaf nodes in SVG
mode creates floating tool-tip type output with full taxonomic information for the sequence. The preferred form
of output for the tree is an SVG image. SVG is an XML
based standard for vector graphics. Though not natively
supported by most browsers, a number of plug-ins is
freely available, for example the Adobe SVG viewer [10].
We plan to extend PhyloView as a visualization framework for enhancing sequence phylogenetic tree images
with associated data. We welcome feedback and proposals
for additional features from users.

Conclusion
PhyloView is the first web server dedicated to colouring
according to taxonomy of phylogenetic trees. There is
other software that may be used to attain similar results
but with considerably more effort. For example, Mesquite
[11] (an open source modular software system for evolutionary analysis written in Java) and MacClade [12] (a
commercial computer program for phylogenetic analysis
that runs only on MacOS), allow the manual colouring of
the branches of a phylogenetic tree, but these are complicated general purpose programs and achieving this is a
laborious and complicated process. PhyloView is
intended to streamline and simplify this, allowing the
user to rapidly explore different combinations of colours
and taxonomic partitions for the best visual result.

Availability and requirements
The provided Newick tree is parsed by the Perl RecDescent
module. The protein IDs of the Newick tree leaves are
extracted and the associated taxonomic identities are
extracted from the SwissProt, SpTrembl, and GenBank
databases. A taxonomic tree is then generated containing
the aggregate taxonomic information of the tree leaves
and represented on the resulting web page as clickable tree
menu with a JavaScript colour picker at every node (see
Figure 1). This mechanism allows the user to associate colours to arbitrary taxonomic groups, with the initial
defaults being Eukarya:blue, Bacteria:green, Archaea:red,
and unknown:black.
Once the colours have been chosen, resubmitting the
form will render a new tree where the various nodes and
branches are coloured based upon the above choice. The
taxonomic colouring algorithm is such that every branch
of the tree receives the colour assigned to the taxonomic
group with most members under that branch. In case of a

PhyloView requires Internet Explorer with the Adobe SVG
viewer plug-in and can be used at [4]. Source code is available from that location as well.
