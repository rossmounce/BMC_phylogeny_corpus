Abstract
Background: Our previous work indicated that novel analogs of choline have cytoprotective effects in vitro that
might be useful in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, two lead
compounds (JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33) from a library of more than 50 improved cognitive performances in a
transgenic mouse model of AD. The purpose of these experiments was to more specifically investigate the
neuroprotective capabilities of these lead compounds both in vitro and in vivo.
Results: We used N2a cells which express a Swedish mutation in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1
genes to investigate the effect of JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33 on b-amyloid (Ab) levels and found that both
compounds significantly reduced Ab levels. JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33 also protected rat primary cortical neurons
from Ab toxicity. Subsequently, we utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as an in vivo model
organism to identify potential molecular targets of these compounds. In the C. elegans model of Ab toxicity,
human Ab is expressed intracellularly in the body wall muscle. The expression and subsequent aggregation of Ab
in the muscle leads to progressive paralysis.
Conclusion: We found that JAY2-22-33 (but not JWB1-84-1) significantly reduced Ab toxicity by delaying paralysis
and this protective effect required both the insulin signaling pathway and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs).

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is believed to be caused by the
abnormal aggregation of harmful proteins including
b-amyloid (Ab) peptide and microtubule-associated protein tau [1,2]. The treatment of AD is currently limited
to the symptomatic approaches with 2 classes of FDA
approved drugs, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs)
and NMDA receptor antagonist [3]. The Alzheimer’s
Association estimates that by the year 2050, without
better ways to prevent the disease, the number of AD
patients will be increased to between 11 and 16 million

in the United States and more than 100 million worldwide [4]. This leads to the need for the development of
effective compounds that can provide disease-modifying
property.
Nicotine has been shown to improve performance on
attention and memory tasks both in humans and animal
subjects [5]. In addition, many studies have indicated
that nicotine could have a potential therapeutic benefit
in treating AD since it has been shown to reduce Ab
levels in both rat and mouse models of AD [6,7]. The
neuroprotective effects of nicotine are thought to be
mediated via effects at a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) [6]. This receptor is involved in learning
and memory and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. It has been reported that the brain of AD
patients and animal models of AD exhibit marked

deceases in nAChRs especially a7- and a4b2-nAChRs
[8] and the loss of these receptors is correlated with
learning and memory deficits [9]. Therefore, nAChRs
should be one of the therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD. This leads to a reasonable rationale for
designing drugs with activity at nAChRs especially the
a7 subtype.
Choline, a precursor of acetylcholine (ACh) and a product of acetylcholine hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase
(AChE), is a selective agonist of a7 nAChR [10,11].
Choline, like nicotine, exhibited a protective effect
against cytotoxicity induced by growth factor deprivation in differentiated PC-12 cells [12]. So far, we have
developed over 50 choline analogs with similar or
greater potency than nicotine. These compounds produced cytoprotective effect with differences in potency
and efficacy [13]. Among the series of synthetic choline
analogs, two lead compounds, JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-2233 (Figure 1) were also studied for other pharmacological properties. JWB1-84-1 improved cognitive performance in a transgenic mouse model of AD and
significantly reversed distractor-impaired accuracies in
an attention deficit model in young macaques [14].
JAY2-22-33 exhibited similar properties in this model
(unpublished data).
In this paper, we studied the effects of JWB1-84-1 and
JAY2-22-33 in both in vitro and in vivo models of AD.
We used N2a cell which expresses a Swedish mutation in

amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 genes to
study the effect of compounds on Ab levels and we used
rat primary cortical neuron to study the neuroprotective
effect of compounds on Ab toxicity and we used the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model
organism to identify the potential molecular targets of
these compounds. C. elegans is a useful model to study
the molecular mechanisms of drug action and has been
used as a model for various age-associated neurodegenerative diseases [15], including Alzheimer’s disease [16],
Parkinson’s disease [17] and Huntington’s disease [18].
The transgenic C. elegans model of Ab toxicity has been
developed by expressing human Ab in the muscle. The
expression and subsequent aggregation of Ab in the muscle lead to progressive paralysis [19]. The Ab being
expressed in this transgenic C. elegans is not full-length
1-42 but rather a 3-42 truncation product. In vitro analysis demonstrates that Ab3-42 self-aggregates like Ab 1-42,
but more rapidly, and forms fibrillar structures [20]. By
using this model, we could examine the protective effect
of JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33 via the potential reduction
of Ab toxicity. Then, we could identify the molecular targets of these compounds by taking advantage of genetic
amenability in this model.
In C. elegans, the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway
controls many biological processes such as life span,
metabolism and stress response. This pathway is comprised of many proteins including insulin/IGF-1 receptor

Keowkase et al. Molecular Neurodegeneration 2010, 5:59
http://www.molecularneurodegeneration.com/content/5/1/59

(DAF-2), PI3-kinase (AGE-1) and FOXO transcription
factor (DAF-16) and heat shock factor (HSF)-1.
Recently, it was reported that modulation of the insulin/
IGF-1 signaling pathway delayed the onset of Ab toxicity
in C. elegans expressing human Ab [21,22]. To alleviate
proteotoxicity, the insulin signaling requires HSF-1 to
modulate Ab disaggregation process, while DAF-16 regulates the less toxic high molecular aggregation process.
In this study, we sought to determine whether JWB184-1 and JAY2-22-33 protects against Ab toxicity by
regulating these target genes, and whether the observed
protective effect (if present) would be absent in nAChR
mutants. Such information would begin to identify
potential multitarget mechanisms that mediate the neuroprotective effect of choline analogs.

Results and Discussion
Nicotine and choline analogs protect primary cortical
neuron from Ab toxicity

The results of experiments designed to assess the potential neuroprotective effects of nicotine and the choline
analogs against the compromised neuronal viability
induced by the Ab1-42 peptide are illustrated in Figure 2.
As illustrated, 24 hr incubation with the Ab1-42 peptide
(100 nM) decreased cell survival by about 40% in each
series of experiments. Nicotine and each of the choline
analogs significantly protected against Ab-induced neurotoxicity. In fact, all of the concentrations of nicotine
evaluated (1.0 nM to 100 μM) offered some degree of
protection (p < 0.05). Likewise, in the case of JWB1-841, all of the concentrations evaluated above 3.0 nM
levels offered protection (p < 0.05). For both nicotine
and JWB1-84-1 there was an inverted U concentrationeffect relationship with maximum levels of protection
observed at 300 nM and 1.0 μM, respectively. In the
case of JAY2-22-23, all of the concentrations higher
than 30 nM produced statistically significant neuroprotective effects (p < 0.05). JAY2-22-23 did not produce
an inverted U concentration-effect relationship and the
highest concentration evaluated (100 μM) produced the
highest degree of protection of approximately 92% cell
survival.
JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33 reduced Ab in medium of
Ab-expressing neuroblastoma cells

To test the hypothesis that JAY2-22-33 and JWB1-84-1
may have a possible role in modulating the amyloid peptide species as a mechanism underlying their beneficial
effects in improved cognitive performance in transgenic
mice model of Alzheimer’s disease [14], N2a neuroblastoma cells which express the Ab transgene after the
addition of sodium butyrate were used. After induction
by sodium butyrate, these mutant neuroblastoma cells
were able to process the amyloid precursor protein to

Page 4 of 14

produce Ab. N2a cells were treated with increasing concentration of either JAY2-22-33 or JWB1-84-1. Then the
effect of JAY2-22-33 and JWB1-84-1 Ab levels were
determined by using ELISA. We found that JAY2-22-33
at concentration 0.5 and 1 μM and JWB1-84-1 at concentration 0.125, 0.25, 1 and 2 μM significantly reduced
the level of Ab in the medium (Figure 3A and 3B).
Nicotine and JAY2-22-33, but not JWB1-84-1, delayed
Ab-induced paralysis in C. elegans strain CL2006

According to the amyloid hypothesis, AD is thought to
be caused by the production and deposition of neurotoxic Ab-peptide in the brain [2]. The deposition of Ab
in the brain leads to many consequences such as the
formation of neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, inflammation, neuronal cell
death and eventually the clinical symptoms of AD
[3,23]. In transgenic C. elegans model of AD, human
Ab42 protein has been expressed intracellularly in the
body wall muscle and the expression and subsequent
aggregation of Ab in the muscle lead to progressive
paralysis. To investigate the protective effect of nicotine,
the worm strain CL2006 which produces Ab constitutively in the muscle was used. The worms were treated
with nicotine at concentration ranging from 1 nM to
1 mM. We found that nicotine at concentration 10 and
100 nM significantly delayed Ab-induced paralysis in
this transgenic worm (p= 0.02 and 0.04, respectively,
Figure 4A and 4B).
The worms were also treated with either JAY2-22-33 or
JWB1-84-1 at concentration ranging from 10 nM to 100
μM. JAY2-22-33 at concentration 100 μM significantly
delayed Ab-induced paralysis (p= 0.01, Figure 5A). However, none of any concentrations of JWB1-84-1 delay
Ab-induced paralysis (Figure 5B).
Investigate mechanism of action of JAY2-22-33 using
RNAi experiment

To identify the role of insulin signaling pathway and
nAChRs in mediating the protective effects of JAY2-2233 against Ab toxicity, we performed RNAi knock-down
of daf-16, hsf-1, acr-16, and unc-38 in transgenic C. elegans expressing human Ab. It has been revealed recently
that DAF-16, HSF-1 and insulin signaling pathway play
a role in the protection against Ab toxicity [21,24]. It is
also well known that C. elegans FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is a key mediator for regulating longevity
and stress resistance [25-27]. To test whether DAF-16
and HSF-1 are required for the protective effect of
JAY2-22-33 against Ab toxicity, we performed the
experiment by using RNAi knock down of DAF-16 or
HSF-1 expression. We found that JAY2-22-33 at concentration 100 μM significantly delayed Ab-induced
paralysis in worms grown on bacteria containing empty

significantly reduced secreted amount of Ab monomers using ELISA (p < 0.05) based on one way ANOVA analysis. Posthoc dunnette test

vector (p = 0.02, Figure 6A) and daf-16 RNAi (p =
0.002, Figure 6B) but not on hsf-1 RNAi bacteria (p =
0.69, Figure 6C). This result indicated that reducing the
activity of HSF-1 abolished the protective effect of
JAY2-22-33, suggesting the requirement of HSF-1 for
protective effect of JAY2-22-33. On the other hand,
JAY2-22-33 at dose 100 μM still significantly delayed
Ab-induced paralysis in worms fed with daf-16 RNAi
bacteria, indicating that DAF-16 is not required for the
protective effect of JAY2-22-33.
We also found that JAY2-22-33 at a concentration
100 μM did not delay Ab-induced paralysis in worms
fed with bacteria containing either acr-16 (p = 0.23,
Figure 6D) or unc-38 RNAi bacteria (p = 0.82,
Figure 6E), indicating that both nAChRs were required
for the protective effect of JAY2-22-33.
In this study, we investigated the effects of JAY2-22-33
and JWB1-84-1 on Ab levels in an in vitro model using
a mouse neuroblastoma N2a cell which can express Ab
in an inducible manner [28]. We found that both JAY222-33 and JWB1-84-1 significantly reduced Ab levels in
this mutant cell line. This result indicated that these
compounds may have the effect on Ab processing or
clearance. In addition, JAY2-22-33 and JWB1-84-1 also
protected against Ab toxicity in rat primary cortical
neurons. In a previous study, we found that these compounds showed the potential effect on improving cognitive function in Ab transgenic mice [14]. The data
presented here support the idea that these compounds
may have potential benefit in Alzheimer’s disease models in addition to their potent cytoprotective effect
found in vitro [13].
We then evaluated the effect of JAY2-22-33 and
JWB1-84-1 in a C. elegans model of Ab toxicity. C. elegans is a genetically and functionally well characterized
organism that is easy to maintain, can be cultivated in
large numbers and it has a relatively short life span,
allowing AD-related studies to be performed in a relatively brief period of time. C. elegans does not produce
endogenous Ab, thus, providing the opportunity to
express and study human Ab specifically. Human Ab
has been expressed in the body wall muscle cells in
C. elegans [19]. After the expression and deposit of Ab
in the muscle cells, the worms became progressively
paralyzed indicating deterioration in the function of the
body wall muscle cells expressing Ab. We used nicotine
as a positive control because of its effectiveness in reducing Ab levels in previous studies [6,7,29] and its neuroprotective effect against Ab toxicity in rat primary
cortical neuron shown in this study. Our results showed
that nicotine reduced Ab toxicity by significantly
delayed Ab-induced paralysis. However, this beneficial
effect of nicotine was only observed with lower

Page 9 of 14

concentrations. Higher concentrations of nicotine may
be toxic to the worm and in other studies found that
high concentrations have been associated with spastic
paralysis [30]. Our results are thus in agreement with
other study showing that nicotine has benefit effects in
various models of AD [6,7,29,31], although one study
indicated the absence of effect of nicotine in transgenic
mice model of AD [32]. Similar to nicotine, JAY2-22-33
significantly delayed Ab-induced paralysis indicating its
protective effect in this model of Ab toxicity. However,
JWB1-84-1 at concentrations up to 100 μM did not
show the protective effect in this model. We further
investigated whether the protective effect of JAY2-22-33
is relevant to the reduction of toxic species Ab oligomer.
We found that JAY2-22-33 did not reduce the level of
Ab oligomer suggesting that protective effect of JAY222-33 involves other mechanisms (data not shown).
Another advantage of C. elegans is that it can be used
as a tool to identify the potential targets of active compounds. Despite its phylogenetic differences, C. elegans
shares a large number of genes and biological pathways
with mammalians. About 50-60% of the C. elegans
genes are homologous to human genes [33]. Additionally, double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) is useful
method for gene disruption in C. elegans. So we took
these advantages to identify the mechanism of action of
JAY2-22-33 on delaying Ab-induced paralysis. Significant evidence indicates that insulin receptor/IGF-1
receptor signaling plays a role in AD [34] and has direct
effect on the metabolism and clearance of Ab [35,36].
Cohen and coworkers showed that knocking down
DAF-2, the homolog of the mammalian IR/IGF-1R,
reduced Ab toxicity [21,24]. DAF-16 and HSF-1, which
are down-stream components of insulin signaling pathway, have been shown to play an important role in
reducing Ab toxicity. DAF-16, which is homologous to
human FOXO1 [37], regulates the less toxic high molecular aggregation process whereas HSF-1 modulates Ab
disaggregation process. By knocking down these genes
using RNAi method, our results indicated that HSF-1 is
required for the protective effect of JAY2-22-33 whereas
DAF-16 is not required.
The heat shock transcription factor, HSF-1, regulates
expression of many different heat-inducible target genes
such as heat shock proteins. HSF-1 has been implicated
in modulating both longevity [38-40] and proteotoxicity
[21,24,38]. Reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling protects
worms from proteotoxicity associated with the aggregation of Ab. To alleviate proteotoxicity in worms, insulin/
IGF-1 requires HSF-1 to modulate the disaggregation
process of Ab. Our results showed that HSF-1 is required
for the protective effect of JAY2-22-33, so it is possible
that JAY2-22-33 may mediate the activity of HSF-1

through the insulin signaling pathway. However, further
studies will be necessary to clarify how JAY2-22-33 act
on this pathway.
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are a family
of highly conserved pentameric channels used extensively
in both vertebrate and invertebrate neurotransmission.
This receptor accounts for a major component of the
synaptic response at the C. elegans neuromuscular junction [41]. In this study we asked the role of nAChR in
mediating protective effects of JAY2-22-33 against Ab
toxicity by using mutant acr16, which is homologous to
human a7 nAChR, and unc-38, which encodes a acetylcholine receptor subunit [41-43]. We reasoned that if
protection against Ab toxicity by JAY requires either of
the proteins, then the observed delaying of paralysis
would be abolished. We found that both ACR-16 and
UNC-38 were required for the protective effect of JAY222-33. However, the relationship between nAChR and
Ab metabolism in C. elegans has not been established
yet. In contrast, it has already been shown that the loss of
nAChRs enhances Ab toxicity in a mouse model of AD
[9]. Our results in C. elegans indicated that the presence
of nAChRs were necessary to mediate the protective
effect of JAY2-22-33.
Insulin signaling pathway is a key regulator of aging
and longevity in worms [44], flies [45], mice [46] and
human [47-49]. Since we found that the protective effect
of JAY2-22-33 is mediated through the insulin signaling
pathway, we further investigated whether JAY2-22-33
prolongs life span. Our result showed that JAY2-22-33
did not extend life span (data not shown)

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study provided information for
decoding potential multitarget mechanism that mediates
neuroprotective effect of choline analog, JAY2-22-33.
Via the use of C. elegans as a model of Ab toxicity, we
determined that JAY2-22-33 significantly delayed Abinduced paralysis and that this protective effect required
both the insulin signaling pathway and nAChRs. It
should be noted that none of the choline analogs we
have evaluated to date (including JWB1-84-1 and JAY222-33) exhibit a potent ability to displace a7 ligands in
competition binding assay. JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33
were also recently evaluated in a neurotransmitter
screen (ligand displacement assays) at a single 10 μM
concentration at 40 additional (potential) drug targets.
There were no potent interactions at any of the receptors/ion channels evaluated (as would be indicated by >
90% displacement). These data (not shown) were generously provided by the National Institute of Mental
Health’s Psychoactive Drug Screening Program, Contract # HHSN-271-2008-00025-C (NIMH PDSP). Thus,

Page 11 of 14

the molecular mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects
of JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33 are not fully resolved at
this time. Potential effects at allosteric receptor sites and
other signaling pathways will be the focus of future
experiments.

Methods
JWB1-84-1 and JAY2-22-33 synthesis

The detail for synthesis of N-(2-hydroxyethyl-N’-(3-pyridylmethyl)-piperazine JWB1-84-1 and 2(N-methyl, Nmethyl-3-pyridoamino) ethan-1-ol (oxalate salt) JAY222-33 was previously described [50].
Cell culture
N2a cells (Ab expressing mutated cell line)

The N2a cell line expresses a Swedish mutation in APP
695 and another mutation in PS1 whereby exon-9 is
deleted. These double mutations are similar to the ones
seen in early stage familial Alzheimer’s disease [51]. N2a
cells produce high levels of Ab upon stimulation with
sodium butyrate. This cell line was a gift from Dr. H.

Primary cortical neurons

Cortical neurons were harvested from rat pups (postnatal day 0) and plated at the density of 100,000 cells per
well in 96 well plates. The cells were maintained in neurobasal media with supplement of B27, 1% pen/strep
and 0.5 mM Glutamine. The cell cultures were incubated in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator at 37°C. The
media was changed every three days.
Quantitation of Ab using ELISA

Ninety six-well plates were coated with 100 μl 6E10
(capture antibody) 20 μl/10 ml in PBS overnight with
rocking at 4°C. The plates were then washed with PBST
(0.05% Tween 20) 5 times. Blocking buffer (PBS with 1%
BSA and 5% horse serum) 200 μl was added and incubated 2-4 hr at room temperature. Increasing concentration of the conditioned medium or Ab standard 50 μl
was added to the plates and incubated overnight at 4°C.
After 3 washes, 100 μl of 4G8 biotinylated antibody
(5 μl/10 ml in PBS containing 1% w/v BSA) was added
and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. After
washing 5 times with PBST, 100 μl of Streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase (1:200 dilution in PBS with 1%
BSA) was added and incubated for 30 minutes at room
temperature. One hundred microlitre of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) which is a substrate for HRP was added
to the well and incubated at room temperature for

15 min. Stop solution (2 N H2SO4 or 1 M H3PO4) 50 μl
was added and the absorbance of the well was read at
450 nm.
Cell viability assay

This assay was performed using Invitrogen Vybrant®
MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Invitrogen V-13154).
The cortical neurons were cultured for 7 days before
the experiment. On the day of experiment, the primary
cortical neurons were incubated with vehicle or with
various concentrations of compound Nicotine, JWB184-1 or JAY2-22-23 for 24 hours. The cells were washed
and challenged with 100 μM Ab for 24 hours. Cells
were then washed with fresh Neurobasal media and
100 μl of fresh Neurobasal media plus 10 μl of 12 mM
MTT stock solution were added to each well. Cells were
incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. 100 μl of the SDS-HCl
solution were added to each well and mixed thoroughly
and incubated for another 4 hours. The absorbance was
measured at 570 nm.
Drug treatment (in C. elegans)

Page 12 of 14

E. coli HT115 strains expressing dsRNA specific to daf16, hsf-1, acr-16 and unc-38 gene. After 3-4 h, worms
were removed and eggs were permitted to mature to L4
young larvae. These worms were considered as the first
generation (F1). Then, the L4 larvae (F1) were transferred to another plate containing dsRNA and allowed
to lay eggs. The resultant adult worms were considered
as the second generation (F2) and were used for the
paralysis assay.
Data analysis

Each of the data points depicted in the figures represents the mean ± S.E.M. Significant differences between
groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance
with statistically significant differences accepted at the
p < 0.05 level. Post hoc analysis was performed using
Dunnett’s method. GraphPad Prism 5 software was used
for the paralysis and survival analysis. p value calculations were made between treated and untreated animals
using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

Nicotine (Nicotine hydrogen tartrate salt; Sigma-Aldrich,
USA), JWB1-84-1 (N-(2-hydroxyethyl-N’-(3-pyridylmethyl)-piperazine HCl) and JAY2-22-33 (2 (N-methyl,
N-methyl-3-pyridoamino) ethan-1-ol (oxalate salt)) were
added to the OP50 bacteria to a desired final concentration. The treatment was given to the transgenic worm
from egg stage onward.

C. elegans strains

1

The wild type C. elegans strain N2, the transgenic strain
CL2006 were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetic
Center (University of Minnesota). The construction and
characterization of transgenic C. elegans strain CL2006
has been described previously [52]. Maintenance of all
strains was routinely performed at 20°C on Nematode
Growth Medium (NGM) plates with Escherichia coli
strain OP50 as a food source as previously described.
Paralysis assay

The reproductive adults of transgenic C. elegans strain
CL2006 maintained at 20°C were transferred to the 35 ×
10 mm culture plates containing either a vehicle or
drug, and allowed to lay eggs for 4-6 h, producing agesynchronized groups. The worms were tested everyday
for paralysis. To identify the paralysis, each worm was
gently touched with a platinum loop. The worms were
scored as paralyzed when they displayed no body movement when prodded with a platinum loop.
RNA interference (RNAi)

RNAi was performed in C. elegans by feeding the worms
with dsRNA-containing bacteria. C. elegans was fed with
