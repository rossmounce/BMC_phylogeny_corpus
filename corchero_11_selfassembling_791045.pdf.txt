Self-assembling, protein-based intracellular
bacterial organelles: emerging vehicles for
encapsulating, targeting and delivering
therapeutical cargoes
José L Corchero1,2,4* and Juan Cedano2,3

Abstract
Many bacterial species contain intracellular nano- and micro-compartments consisting of self-assembling proteins
that form protein-only shells. These structures are built up by combinations of a reduced number of repeated
elements, from 60 repeated copies of one unique structural element self-assembled in encapsulins of 24 nm to
10,000-20,000 copies of a few protein species assembled in a organelle of around 100-150 nm in cross-section.
However, this apparent simplicity does not correspond to the structural and functional sophistication of some of
these organelles. They package, by not yet definitely solved mechanisms, one or more enzymes involved in specific
metabolic pathways, confining such reactions and sequestering or increasing the inner concentration of unstable,
toxics or volatile intermediate metabolites. From a biotechnological point of view, we can use the self assembling
properties of these particles for directing shell assembling and enzyme packaging, mimicking nature to design new
applications in biotechnology. Upon appropriate engineering of the building blocks, they could act as a new family
of self-assembled, protein-based vehicles in Nanomedicine to encapsulate, target and deliver therapeutic cargoes
to specific cell types and/or tissues. This would provide a new, intriguing platform of microbial origin for drug
delivery.
Keywords: self-assembling proteins, protein delivery, nanoparticles

Introduction
Our view of the intracellular bacterial cell organization
has significantly changed over the past years. Once
taken simply as reaction vessels containing a homogeneous solution of proteins, bacteria are now seen as
organisms with an intricate subcellular architecture in
which individual proteins localize to particular sites
within the cell, often in a dynamic manner [1-4]. Protein-based microcompartments are particularly intriguing intracellular bacterial organelles. They are large
macromolecular complexes consisting of metabolic
enzymes encapsulated within multiprotein, polyhedral
shells, reminiscent of the viral capsids structures. A
common feature of such bacterial microcompartments

(BMC) is a thin shell primarily (composed by a few
thousand protein subunits, so-called BMC shell proteins) that encapsulate the enzymes while allowing
transport of substrates and products. Several studies
indicate that the general role of the protein shell is to
seclude toxic or volatile metabolic intermediates, while
allowing enzyme substrates, products and cofactors to
pass. Polyhedral organelles had been identified and
visualized by electron microscopy in cyanobacteria and
some chemoautotrophs, and were first isolated in 1973
and determined to contain the CO 2 -fixing enzyme
RuBisCO [5,6]. They were named carboxysomes, and
are now recognized as the first member of a diverse
group of microcompartments. BMC proteins were later
found to be encoded in the propanediol utilization
operon (pdu operon) of the heterotroph Salmonella [7]
and by an operon for metabolizing ethanolamine (eut
operon) in enteric bacterial species, including

Salmonella and Escherichia [8]. Until recently, the diversity of these structures had been overlooked because
many of them are not formed on standard growth
media and because their observation requires the use of
electronic microscopy techniques. However, recent genome analyses have detected seven functionally distinct
organelles distributed among over at least 40 bacteria
genera. Searches for homologies with shell proteins in
protein sequence databases have emphasized the widespread occurrence of microcompartments across bacteria species, and the likely horizontal gene transfer for
their genetic determinants spread [9].
Main polyhedral organelles in bacteria
Carboxysomes

Isolated in the early 1970s, carboxysomes were the first
bacterial polyhedral organelle identified [5,6]. They are
polyhedral inclusions of approximately 100-150 nm in
cross section, and with a 3-4 nm protein shell composed
of six to ten different protein species. These organelles
have been identified in cyanobacteria and in many chemoautotrophic bacteria, but not in eukaryotes [10-12].
Their distribution and composition has been investigated by genomic and phylogenetic analyses [13]. Their
structure varies among different producing bacteria, and
according to their constituent proteins, they can be
divided into subtypes a and b. The a-type carboxysome
is that of the facultative chemoautotroph Halothiobacillus neapolitanus. Type b carboxysomes are found in the
b subdivision of the cyanobacteria, where carboxysome
proteins are designated CCM because of their role in a
carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism. The function
of carboxysomes is to enhance autotrophic CO2 fixation
at low CO2 levels. This role is supported by the findings
that carboxysome formation is induced by CO2 limitation [14], and that mutant strains of cyanobacteria and
chemoautotrophs unable to properly form carboxysomes
require high CO2 levels for autotrophic growth [15,16].
The carboxysome is filled with the ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) enzyme [6], which
catalyzes the CO2 fixation step in the Calvin cycle. Also
associated with the carboxysome is the carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme, responsible of the conversion of
HCO-3 (that is not used by RuBisCO) to CO2, the substrate for RuBisCO [17-19].

on other carbon sources [20,21]. Microscopy analysis
showed that coenzyme B12-dependent diol dehydratase
(DDH) is a major component of the pdu organelles, and
that the PduA protein is a shell component [20,22],
together with other 14 different polypeptides. Genetic
studies showed that genes specifically involved in 1,2-PD
utilization encode homologs of the carboxysome shell
proteins [7], but that their enzyme cargo and physiological functions are clearly different [21-23]. The pdu organelles function is to minimize the harmful effects of a
toxic intermediate of 1,2-PD degradation (propionaldehyde) [21-23]. Mutants unable to form pdu organelles
undergo a 20-h period of growth arrest during degradation of 1,2-PD, whereas wild-type S. enterica grows normally under similar conditions [21]. The length and
severity of growth arrest increases at higher 1,2-PD concentrations, suggesting that it results from the accumulation of a toxic metabolite derived from 1,2-PD [21].
Organelles involved in coenzyme B12-dependent
ethanolamine degradation (eut)

It has also been described a polyhedral organelle
involved in ethanolamine utilization (eut operon) by S.
enterica [8]. The Eut and Pdu microcompartments share
some homologous enzymes: both metabolic pathways
proceed via aldehyde intermediates, propionaldehyde in
the case of Pdu and acetaldehyde in the case of Eut [2].
The Eut microcompartment function is to metabolize
ethanolamine without allowing the release of acetaldehyde into the cytosol, thus alleviating the potentially
toxic effects of excess aldehyde in the bacterial cytosol
[24-26] and also preventing volatile acetaldehyde from
diffusing across cell membrane and leading to a loss of
carbon [27]. The initial step of this process is catalyzed
by coenzyme B12-dependent ethanolamine ammonia
lyase, which converts ethanolamine to acetaldehyde.
Subsequently, acetaldehyde is converted to ethanol and
acetate by a series of reactions analogous to those used
for 1,2-PD degradation [28]. This suggests that Eut and
Pdu organelles might have the common function of protecting cells against aldehyde toxicity [29]. In addition,
recent studies (referring to the Eut organelles as metabolosomes) suggest that these structures function concentrating both enzymes and their substrates to allow a
more efficient growth while minimizing acetaldehyde
toxicity and maintaining coenzyme A balance [30].

Organelles for 1,2-propanediol utilization (pdu)

Carboxysomes were the only known polyhedral organelles for many years. However, Salmonella enterica was
found to form a polyhedral organelle during growth on
1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) as a sole carbon and energy
source [20]. Electron microscopy showed that S. enterica
forms structures (similar in size and shape to carboxysomes) during growth on 1,2-PD but not during growth

BMC shell structure

At present, about 1700 proteins containing BMC
domains have been identified, covering at least 10 different bacterial phyla. Multiple paralogs of the shell proteins are essentially always found together. The typical
BMC domain consists of 90 amino acids in length with
an alpha/beta fold pattern [9,31]. BMC proteins self-

assemble to form disc-shaped hexamers, the basic building blocks of the shell (Figure 1, light blue proteins).
Each hexamer typically presents a narrow pore through
the middle, along the six-fold axis of symmetry. Crystal
structures show that such hexamers further assemble
side-by-side, forming a molecular layer [9,32,33], with 4to 6-Å-wide gaps between hexamers. Both central hexamer pores and the gaps between hexamers potentially
serve as gates for metabolites, selectively allowing passage of negatively charged molecules such as the substrates and products of RuBisCO while restricting
uncharged molecules such as CO2 and O2 [9]. A notable
feature of the hexagonal layer of the carboxysome shell
is the presence of a bowl-shaped depression or concavity
on one side of the hexameric building block, side where
both N-termini and C-termini are usually located. This
molecular layer appears to represent the flat facets of
the shell.
Electron microscopy studies have confirmed that carboxysomes are approximately icosahedral in shape. The
construction of large icosahedral structures typically
requires a combination of hexameric and pentameric
units. Pentamers generate curvature in an otherwise flat
hexagonal sheet, occupying the vertices of the icosahedral shell. In agreement with this vision, homologous
proteins CcmL and CsoS4A from two different types of
carboxysomes self-assemble to form pentamers (Figure
1, orange proteins), whose size and shape are compatible
with their placement at the vertices of an icosahedral
shell containing 12 pentamers [32]. Both CcmL and
CsoS4A proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and
an atomic model was built and refined at a resolution of

Page 3 of 8

2.4 Å and 2.15 Å for CcmL and CsoS4A, respectively.
The study of such crystal structures confirmed that both
CcmL and OrfA formed symmetric pentamers [32].
This model of CcmL or CsoS4 pentamers occupying the
icosahedral vertices is in agreement with their low abundance in the shell, and with mutational experiments in
which deletion of the genes led to failure to form closed
shells [34]. However, there is not a total consensus on
the role of CcmL or CsoS4 proteins with respect to provide the needed curvature in order to form icosahedral,
closed shells. Some studies [35] have shown that CsoS4
proteins are apparently not essential determinants of
carboxysome shape: a Halothiobacillus neapolitanus
knockout mutant that does not produce CsoS4 predominantly forms carboxysomes of normal appearance, in
addition to some elongated microcompartments. However, and despite their normal shape, mutant carboxysomes are functionally impaired (in the absence of
CsoS4 protein, the carboxysome shell loses its permeability to CO2).
This scenario of hexamers forming flat facets and pentamers providing the needed curvature in the overall
icosahedral structure (as shown in Figure 1) is not universal for all types of bacterial microcompartments. For
example, the homologous protein of CcmL and CsoS4
in the Eut microcompartment is EutN, whose structure
is hexameric rather than pentameric. The difference
between the oligomeric state of EutN, compared to
CcmL and CsoS4, presumably reflects structural differences between the Eut microcompartment and the carboxysome. Another alternative is that the Eut
microcompartment could lack pentamers, which would

Figure 1 Model for the hierarchical assembly of a typical bacterial microcompartment. The facets of these icosahedral nano-cages are
made of one type of protein (in light blue) that further self-assemble to give hexamers. On the other hand, the vertices are formed by
pentamers resulting of the self-assembly of a different protein (in orange). Pores allowing traficking of molecules are located at the center of
each hexamer and pentamer. Sizes can range from 20-25 nm for the encapsulin shell to 100-150 nm for carboxysomes.

explain why enteric bacteria BMC tend to have less-regular icosahedral shapes than carboxysomes. Purified Pdu
microcompartments contain two major BMC-domain
proteins (PduA and PduJ) that are closely related in
sequence to the hexamers proposed to form the faces of
the carboxysome [22]. The pdu operon also encodes a
homolog (PduN) of the pentamer proposed to from the
vertices of the carboxysome [32]. These analogies suggest that Pdu shell may have flat faces formed by PduA
and PduJ hexamers, and vertices made from PduN pentamers. However, and as seen for the Eut microcompartment, electron microscopy shows that Pdu
microcompartments are more irregular in shape than
carboxysomes: Pdu (and Eut) microcompartment does
not resemble a regular icosahedron as closely as the carboxysome does, fact that may correlate with the different behaviors of the CcmL/CsoS4/EutN/PduN family of
proteins.
Encapsulating therapeutic proteins into protein-based
bacterial organelles

As the number of therapeutics requiring parenteral
administration increases, delivery vehicles improving
therapeutic efficacy will find increasing use [36-39].
Among all the currently available vehicles, the utility of
nanoparticles to deliver chemotherapeutics in vivo is
now well established, with several formulations and
synthesis protocols available [40-42]. They can be
synthesized from a range of materials, being the most
common ones based on biocompatible, and preferably
biodegradable, lipids or polymers [40]. In general, nanoparticles are designed to minimize limitations of conventional drug delivery systems, including nonspecific
biodistribution and targeting, low aqueous solubility,
poor bioavailability and low therapeutic effects due to
insufficient drug concentration at disease sites. Moreover, nanoparticles of submicrometer size offers clear
advantages over microparticles as they are best suited
for intravenous delivery [43].
Macromolecular self-assembly has been exploited
recently to engineer materials for the encapsulation and
controlled delivery of therapeutics. Self-assembled structures can be formed by a variety of building blocks,
both organic and inorganic [44]. Peptides and proteins
are among the most useful organic building blocks,
since they are stable and robust and can spontaneously
associate to form nanotubes, nanospheres, nanofibrils,
and other ordered nano-sized structures [45,46]. For
example, since it was described that protein aggregation
as bacterial inclusion bodies does not necessarily mean
the inactivation of the forming proteins [47], such structures incorporated to the list of self-assembling materials with putative biotechnological and biomedical
applications [48]. When protein self-assembling does

not occur spontaneously, some strategies to promote it
can be used. For example, fusion of self-assembling or
arginine-rich peptides has been reported to promote the
formation of active protein aggregates in E. coli [49,50]
or of structured nanodisks [51], respectively.
Protein-based capsids (also known as protein nanocages or nano-containers) are appealing vehicles for
drug delivery [52,53]. Their biocompatibility, biological
fabrication, functional diversity and versatility of design
though protein engineering (assisted by in silico instruments) make them extremely powerful materials. A
well-studied example of natural protein nano-cage is ferritin, a 450 kDa protein assembly of 24 subunits. Ferritin, ubiquitous in cells and in extracellular matrices, is a
cage-like protein with an inner space of 8 nm in diameter. This inner space allows storage of up to 4500 Fe
atoms as ferric oxyhydroxide clusters, serving as a reservoir providing Fe atoms for metabolic use [54]. Viral
capsids, and other protein cages, are increasingly being
used as multivalent, multifunctional nano-containers.
Mimicking viral structures as models, several proteinonly nano-cages have been explored for materials applications [55].
Mechanisms directing enzyme encapsulation within
protein-based bacterial organelles have been studied and
revealed during the last years. In some cases (Figure 2,
pannel A), a stretch of a few (~15-20) aminoacids at the
N-terminus of the inner cargo protein directs and binds
it to specific sites on the inner surface of the shell protein. When such directing peptide is not present, the
strategy is to synthesize the cargo protein together with
the shell-forming domain from one unique gene (Figure
2, pannel B).
As an example of the first strategy (shown in Figure
2, pannel A), in b carboxysomes the protein CcmM is
used as a scaffold to form interactions between both
shell proteins and enzymes [56,57], through a CcmM
C-terminal region with homology to the small subunit
of RuBisCO [58], and probably mimicking the native
interactions of small and large subunits of RuBisCO
inside the carboxysome. In Pdu microcompartments
some of the internal enzymes are also directed to the
interior by special N-terminal targeting sequences
[34,59]. Fan and colleagues [59] demonstrated that a
short N-terminal peptide is necessary and sufficient for
packaging enzymes into the Pdu microcompartment.
Deletion of 10 or 14 amino acids from the N-terminus
of the PduP enzyme (normally found within this
microcompartment), significantly impaired its packaging, without affecting its enzymatic activity. On the
other hand, fusion of the 18 N-terminal amino acids
from PduP to GFP, GST, or maltose-binding protein
resulted in the encapsulation of these proteins within
the Pdu microcompartment. It is worthy to note that

Figure 2 Targeting and encapsulation of proteins into BMCs nano-cages. In some cases (panel A), a stretch of ~15-20 aminoacids (in
green) located at the N-terminus of the inner cargo protein (in red) directs and binds it to specific sites on the inner surface of the shell protein
(in blue). For other bacterial microcompartments (panel B), the cargo protein (in red) is synthesized together with the shell-forming domain (in

the Pdu shell can be assembled heterologously in the
absence of native interior enzymes [34], and that carboxysomes can self-assemble in vivo when RuBisCO
has been deleted [60], offering appealing opportunities
to manipulate such nano-cages in the laboratory in
order to fill them with therapeutic molecules. Also in
this line, another landmark study about enzyme encapsulation was provided by Sutter and colleagues [61].
They described the smallest (20-24 nm of diameter)
known protein-based organelle (found in the
hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima).
The protein family was initially named linocin [62],
but it was renamed by the authors as “encapsulins”. In
many bacteria, the encapsulin gene is positioned downstream within an apparent two-gene operon, being preceded by the gene for either an iron-dependent
peroxidase (DyP) or a protein closely related to the
iron transporter ferritin (Flp). Sequence alignment of
DyP and Flp genes revealed that only those followed
by the encapsulin gene carry a C-terminal extension
with a conserved amino acids sequence responsible for
the protein’s physical interaction with the encapsulin
protein, by binding to distinct pockets on the interior
of the nanocompartment surface.

Support for the existence of the second strategy (Figure 2, pannel B) to encapsulate cargo proteins is provided by the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus
furiosus, where a Flp coding sequence (without any targeting sequence directing its encapsulation by physical
interaction with BMC proteins) is fused in frame with
an encapsulin gene [61]. In this situation, cargo and
encapsulin proteins are synthesized as a fusion that
further self-assembles to form a nano-cage containing
the cargo protein.
Specific targeting sequences could be of use in biotechnological applications to package proteins inside the
stable self-assembled icosahedral shell of encapsulin. As
an example of the utility of such approach, an icosahedral enzyme complex, lumazine synthase, was engineered to encapsulate target molecules by means of
charge complementarity. The lumazine synthase from
Aquifex aeolicus (AaLS) represents the container component, as it forms icosahedral capsids large enough to
encapsulate proteins. To engineer the charge environment within the capsid, four residues of each monomer
that project into the lumen (Arg83, Thr86, Thr120, and
Gln123) were mutated to glutamates, introducing extra
negative charges to the inner surface of the protein

cage. The hypothesis of the authors was that adding a
short stretch of positively charged amino acids to a
cargo protein should promote its specific encapsulation
within this modified proteinaceous nano-container, as
was demonstrated by using a modified GFP containing
ten arginine residues [63].

titanium, silicone oil, etc.) are not naturally processed by
cells, sometimes remaining forever in the body of the
patients and triggering unwanted reactions. On the contrary, due to its proteic nature, recycling by the cells of
the BMC carrier would be relatively easy, only requiring
the use of one of their multiple proteolytic pathways.

Use of protein-based bacterial organelles as drug delivery
system

Conclusions
In protein-based therapies, there are several known
issues to be carefully considered, like a short protein
half-life in vivo, side effects caused by the multiple or
high doses that must be administered in order to reach
the desirable concentration in the cell, or possible protein denaturation during manipulation. To address such
problems, carriers act as a vehicle loaded with high concentrations of therapeutics, providing simultaneously a
protective environment, either for local or systemic
delivery, thus increasing the drug lifetime. The use of
protein cages of non-viral origin as nanomaterials for
biomedicine and biotechnology provides a number of
unique advantages over other types of vehicles for drug
delivery. Their biological origin makes them both amenable to genetic modification and large-scale production.
Genetic modification enables the site-specific introduction of chemical and/or structural functionality onto
highly symmetric protein cage platforms. By either chemical and/or genetic subunit alterations, it is feasible to
simultaneously add new functions to different particle
surfaces to direct cage assembly, encapsulation of a synthetic cargo, or targeting to a specific surface or cell.
Regions not directly involved in vehicle assembly are
generally more suitable to such modifications without
losing the desired cage-like architecture. On the other
hand, studies like those performed by Sutter and Seebeck pinpoint cargo protein features necessary for its
encapsulation, paving the way for future development of
protein-based nano-compartments for several nanotechnological applications. The discovery and understanding
of signal sequences able to direct enzyme encapsulation
into BMC and the underlying mechanisms of such process are key milestones in our understanding of BMC
assembly, and leads the way for the development of
these bacterial organelles toward biotechnological and
biomedical applications. The simplicity of this system
makes it attractive for engineering studies aimed at
encapsulating distinct enzymes in order to create new
vehicles to encapsulate, target and deliver therapeutic
cargoes. There is still a long way ahead to explore in
this area, but one can envision a great potential for
BMC as drug delivery systems. Nowadays, the pharmaceutical industry is having trouble in discovering new
drugs to treat a wide variety of diseases. This problem is
being a serious limitation in conditions like cancer.
Many of the substances that have proven to be highly

Once the BMC is loaded with a therapeutic cargo protein, its administration would depend on the target to
reach, adopting for each case the most appropriate way.
A parenteral administration should be the most common choice to administrate this therapeutic agent, but
not the only one. For mouth or throat cancer, oral
administration would be a more appropriate method.
On the other hand, to treat myeloblastomas the way
would be the cerebrospinal fluid.
The field of cell-specific targeting has been significantly advanced, identifying targeting peptides that target their cargos to the vasculature of a variety of tissues,
organs, and tumors [64,65]. It would be possible to add
on the surface of BMC nanocages any type of specific
binding domain, including targeting peptides or antibodies, providing the desired specificity. In this line, it was
shown [66] that genetic addition of a targeting peptide
(RGD-4C) or chemical conjugation of an anti-CD4
monoclonal antibody onto the surface of the small Hsp
cage structure conferred specific cell targeting capacity.
In addition, authors were able to load a cargo molecule,
a fluorescent imaging agent (fluorescein), within the
interior cavity of the Hsp cage, demonstrating the multifunctional capacity of protein nanocage architectures
and their potential uses in medicine.
After reaching target cells, release of the cargo is
another important issue for drug delivery. One strategy
for particle disassembly and drug release is to take
advantage of the increase in acidity once these macromolecules are taken up by the endocytotic pathway,
where drug release would take place after BMC degradation in the lysosome [67]. In this line, it has been investigated the potential of using histidines for introducing
pH-dependent disassembly [68,69]. The results demonstrated that modulating the degree of electrostatic repulsion through changing the number of histidine
interactions at subunit interfaces could be a generally
applicable strategy for designing pH-triggered assembly/
disassembly in protein macromolecular structures.
The use of BMC as a drug delivery system arises some
general concerns, like its putative antigenicity. It could
be modulated not only by engineering the exposed
sequence/s of the constructs, but also by means of posttranscriptional or chemical modification (like pegylation
[70]). Other materials used as a carriers (like Teflon,

Corchero and Cedano Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:92

efficient in removing tumor cells have been lately discarded due to its high toxicity or lack of specificity. The
possibility of having a vehicle providing such specificity,
by binding to a specific receptor, opens a wide range of
possibilities for the rescue of these substances of low
specificity.
The use of protein-based architectures is an exciting
and fruitful scenario in the design of nano-cages for
drug delivery, based on both protein engineering and
the use of microbial cell factories. And although the
understanding and putative engineering of protein
assembling have a long way ahead, novel principles and
promising strategies of protein manipulation point out
the possibility of the rational construction of nanoscale
protein cages as a viable concept.
