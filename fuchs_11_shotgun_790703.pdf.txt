Shotgun sequencing of Yersinia enterocolitica
strain W22703 (biotype 2, serotype O:9): genomic
evidence for oscillation between invertebrates
and mammals

Abstract
Background: Yersinia enterocolitica strains responsible for mild gastroenteritis in humans are very diverse with
respect to their metabolic and virulence properties. Strain W22703 (biotype 2, serotype O:9) was recently identified
to possess nematocidal and insecticidal activity. To better understand the relationship between pathogenicity
towards insects and humans, we compared the W22703 genome with that of the highly pathogenic strain 8081
(biotype1B; serotype O:8), the only Y. enterocolitica strain sequenced so far.
Results: We used whole-genome shotgun data to assemble, annotate and analyse the sequence of strain W22703.
Numerous factors assumed to contribute to enteric survival and pathogenesis, among them osmoregulated
periplasmic glucan, hydrogenases, cobalamin-dependent pathways, iron uptake systems and the Yersinia genome
island 1 (YGI-1) involved in tight adherence were identified to be common to the 8081 and W22703 genomes.
However, sets of ~550 genes revealed to be specific for each of them in comparison to the other strain. The
plasticity zone (PZ) of 142 kb in the W22703 genome carries an ancient flagellar cluster Flg-2 of ~40 kb, but it lacks
the pathogenicity island YAPIYe, the secretion system ysa and yts1, and other virulence determinants of the 8081
PZ. Its composition underlines the prominent variability of this genome region and demonstrates its contribution
to the higher pathogenicity of biotype 1B strains with respect to W22703. A novel type three secretion system of
mosaic structure was found in the genome of W22703 that is absent in the sequenced strains of the human
pathogenic Yersinia species, but conserved in the genomes of the apathogenic species. We identified several
regions of differences in W22703 that mainly code for transporters, regulators, metabolic pathways, and defence
factors.
Conclusion: The W22703 sequence analysis revealed a genome composition distinct from other pathogenic
Yersinia enterocolitica strains, thus contributing novel data to the Y. enterocolitica pan-genome. This study also
sheds further light on the strategies of this pathogen to cope with its environments.

Background
The genus Yersinia currently comprises three human
pathogens (Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica), and at least 14 species considered harmless
for humans, namely Y. aldovae, Y. bercovieri, Y. frederiksenii, Y. intermedia, Y. kristensenii, Y. mollaretii, Y.

biotype 1B strains are highly pathogenic and lethal for
mice. They form a geographically distinct group predominately isolated in North America and carry a highpathogenicity island (HPI) [11]. Biotype 2-5 strains
mainly found in Europe and Japan compose a weakly
pathogenic group unable to kill mice [12].
We have recently shown that strain W22703 (biotype 2,
serotype O:9) confers lethality towards nematodes and
Manduca sexta larvae upon oral infection, and that this
insecticidal activity is correlated with the presence of the
so-called pathogenicity island TC-PAIYe [13,14]. This 20
kb-fragment is present in the biotype 2-5 strains, but
absent in most biotype 1A and B strains, and carries the
toxin complex (TC) genes tcaA, tcaB, tcaC and tccC with
homology to TC genes of Photorhabdus luminescens.
However, the absence of TC-PAIYe is not reflected by a
loss of toxicity in case of subcutaneous infection, indicating the presence of yet unknown insecticidal determinants in Y. enterocolitica [15].
To investigate the genomic heterogeneity of the species Y. enterocolitica, we have chosen to sequence the
genome of the low-pathogenicity strain W22703. We
report the annotation of this second genome sequence
of a Y. enterocolitica strain, and a detailed comparative
genome analysis of the W22703 genome with that of
strain 8081, a representative of the highly pathogenic
biotype 1B group. The data obtained provide novel
insights into the biology, metabolism, adaptation strategies and evolutionary relationships of Y. enterocolitica.

Results
General features

The shotgun sequencing of the Y. enterocolitica strain
W22703 genome revealed a total number of 243656
reads with an average read length of 363. Assembly of
232502 reads resulted in 305 contigs larger and 705
contigs shorter than 1,000 base pairs (bp) with a median
level of coverage in contigs > 5 kb of 16.49 (Additional
file 1); one contig (1796) exceeds this coverage level
more than twice (40x). The genome has an average G +
C content of 46.9% (Table 1). Upon PEDANT based
annotation [16] and search against a non-redundant
protein database, 4003 genes corresponding to a coding
density of 84.4% could be identified, but an unknown
number of genes might have been missed due the short
contigs not assembled (Additional file 2). The analysis
also revealed at least 68 tRNA genes. The fewer number
of tRNA genes compared to finished Yersinia genomes
is probably due to collapsing of reads of the repeat
sequences into fewer contigs[17]. The exact number of
rRNA operons could not be estimated from this draft
assembly, as reads from identical copies probably assemble into the same contigs. The risk of frameshifts due to
sequencing errors in longer homo-oligomers was

Page 2 of 14

reduced by the high coverage of the assembly. We have
determined 111 pairs of consecutive ORFs having best
similarity to the same protein. However, this number
also includes real pseudogenes not affected by any
sequencing error.
Genome comparison with strain 8081

Y. enterocolitica 8081 is one of three strains of this species whose sequences were available until February 2011
[18-20]. It belongs to the biotype 1B group with higher
pathogenicity potential to humans than the biotype 2-5
group. To delineate the most relevant features of the
W22703 genome, we decided to base our further analysis on a genome comparison between the shotgun
sequence of strain W22703 and the linear genome
sequence of Y. enterocolitica strain 8081. The alignment
of both genomes using Mauve [21] shows long syntenic
regions with few rearrangements and a general high
sequence conservation, but also regions in both genomes that are not shared with the other (Additional file
3). Upon automatic and manual BLAST analysis, we
revealed 550 genes present in the 8081 genome but
absent in that of W22703, and 551 genes that are specific for W22703 with respect to strain 8081. The virulence plasmid pYV [22] was not considered here. Figure
1 shows the categories under which the W22703 genes
absent in 8081 are summarized. Besides hypothetical
genes and those of unknown function, the largest numbers of gene-encoded factors fall into the functional
groups transporter, metabolism and DNA/RNA processing. The latter group comprises 18 regulatory genes.
The motility and phage sections are mainly composed
of the ancestral flagellar locus flgII (see below) and one
specific prophage.
Regions of difference

We then searched for regions of difference (ROD)
between the genome sequences of 8081 and W22703. By
definition, those ROD genes do not belong to the core
genome of the two Y. enterocolitica strains compared
here, but might constitute additional metabolic or virulence-associated properties contributing to the overall
strain fitness. Twelve ROD present in strain W22703 are
shown in Figure 2A. While the average GC-content of
the W22703 genome sequence is 46.9%, the ROD on
contigs 1240, 1162, 1764, 1812, and 1280 show an at
least 2% higher or lower GC-content, suggesting their
acquisition by lateral gene transfer (LGT) [23]. Phylogenetic tree analysis, however, revealed closely related
genes of these contigs in other Yersinia strains, with the
exception of contig 1280 that harbours phage related
genes. The 8081 genes flanking the ROD might give additional information about the underlying recombination
events. For example, a glycosyltransferase operon of 8081

(YE3070-YE3087) might have been replaced by a related
operon on contig 1878 (or vice versa) that possibly contributes to O-antigen synthesis. A substitution of
hypothetical genes by a non-homologous cluster of functionally unknown genes is observed in contig 1764. The
ROD on contigs 1186, 1240, 1280 and 1973 obviously
interrupt gene linearity with respect to the 8081 genome,
indicating that loss and substitution, or insertion, of
genes might have taken place in these cases. Contig 1280
harbours several phage-related genes and is therefore
assumed to represent a second prophage region. Transposase genes were found in the 8081 genome between

YE2773 and YE2779, a region covered by the LPS synthesis in W22703 (contig 1162), and a similar observation
was made for the PTS encoding cluster on contig 1884.
More functional details on these ROD are described
below.
Virulence genes or cluster present or absent in W22703
compared with 8081

While YGI-1, which is responsible for adhesion and
includes a T4SS, is completely encoded on contig 1802,
the high pathogenicity island (HPI) encoding yersiniabactin [24] is missing in the genome of strain W22703.

two-component response regulator, the gene left of it a multi-sensor hybrid histidine kinase. Different GC contents were determined for the
regions left and right of YE0312.

In contrast, we identified 18 functions probably involved
in defence or virulence mechanisms present in W22703,
but absent in 8081 (Table 2). Two autotransporter or
type V secretion proteins (contig 1177), one of them
with homology to an AidA-like adhesin, might play a
role in (non-mammalian) host-recognition by W22703.
The insecticidal pathogenicity island TC-PAIYe is characteristic for biotype 2-5 strains, but absent in biotype
1A and 1B strains with the exception of WA314

(biotype 1B, serotype O:8) [14,15]. Another homology
group of TC genes was found to be prevalent among
clinical biotype 1A strains [25]. Beside a second, nonclustered tccC2 locus [15], no further factors with
homology to toxin complex genes could be identified in
W22703.
To survive within its host organisms, Y. enterocolitica
needs to overcome both cellular (hemocytic) and peptide-mediated components. A candidate of the former

group is the exported repeats-in-toxin RtxA, a cytolytic
toxin of approximately 3200 amino acids length encoded
by contig 1867. It clusters with a putative Rtx activating
protein, RtxC, and a peptide chain release factor 1,
RtxH (Table 2). Among the yersiniae, only one Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3 strain and Y. kristensenii carry
homologs of these proteins. The genome of W22703
encodes three two-partner secretion (TCS) systems
involved in hemolysin release, one of which is absent in
the 8081 genome. Three peptidases of W22703 might
play a role in resistance towards antimicrobial peptides.
W22703 also produces an antibacterial protein or bacteriocin that is absent in 8081. The pyocin locus on contig 1216 probably encodes killer proteins and a dual type
immunity protein with domains similar to pyocin-E2
and colicin (S2). Its biological function, as well as that
of a small toxic polypeptide (contig 1810), is yet
unknown.
Secretion/transfer systems and transporters

Two distinct, chromosomally located type three secretion systems (T3SS) mark one of the most striking differences between the two genomes. While ysa of 8081 is
absent in W22703, this strain harbours another T3SS,
which we termed ysa2, located on contigs 1804 and
1807 (Figure 2B). PCR targeting the flanking regions
resulted in a ~200 bp fragment, justifying the link of
both contigs. Sequence analysis of ysa2 revealed a
mosaic structure with a G/C content of 49.4% between
the flanking genes YE0315 and YE0312, and a G/C

Page 6 of 14

content of 40.9% between YE0312 and YE0311, indicating two independent LGT events. The whole cluster is
collinear to respective regions in apathogenic yersiniae
such as Y. frederikseni and Y. intermedia. We found
homologs of the plasmid-encoded T3SS of Y. pestis and
Y. pseudotuberculosis, and partial collinearity, with
respect to the left part of this 29 kb island. The right
part carries yscC and yscD homologs, but no homologs
of YopB, YopD or LcrV involved in translocon formation [26]. The functionality of ysa2 is unknown. Of the
two type 2 secretion system (T2SS) cluster yst1 and yst2
in 8081, only yst2 responsible for a general secretion
pathway (GSP) is present in strain W22703. Contig
1170 encodes factors involved in conjugal DNA-transfer,
namely TraD, a MobA/MobL protein, and a putative
type IV prepilin that might contribute to LGT.
As iron is often a rate-limiting factor for pathogenic
bacteria during infection, W22703 requires iron-scavenging systems for survival in the host. Beside the two
iron and enterobactin transport systems within the PZ,
those comprise a hemophore cluster for heme binding
and uptake (Table 2), and a putative iron binding protein (contig 1360), the latter one absent in 8081.
We also identified eight ABC transporters in W22703,
two phosphotransferase systems (PTS), four permeases,
two major facilitators, a sodium:bile acid symporter, and
other transporters listed in Table 2 or mentioned in the
sections on metabolism and virulence. All of these are
without counterparts in the genome of strain 8081. A
glucitol/sorbitol-specific transporter (contig 1884;
YE1093-YE1098) and a sorbose uptake system are also
present in 8081, but not in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, and have homologs in all or most non-pathogenic species sequenced so far. A cellobiose uptake
system was also identified (contig 1882). In total, our
analysis identified a higher number of putative transporters with respect to strain 8081.
Plasticity zone (PZ)

The plasticity zone of strain 8081 ranges from YE3447
to YE3644 and has a total length of approximately 199
kb with 186 coding sequences (CDS). It was defined by
Thomson et al. [18] as the largest region of species-specific genomic variation among Y. enterocolitica biotypes,
and it is absent from Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis.
Four contigs revealed to carry PZ genes. We linked contigs 1088/1891 and 1803/1802 due to the presence of
truncated hypF and fepG genes, respectively, at their
ends. The primer combination 5’-GTTTCTTTATGGGC
GCG-3’/5’-TTGGCATGGAGGCCTG-3’ hybridizing to
the ends of contigs 1891 and 1803 resulted in a PCR
product of approximately 1500 bp, thus allowing the linear reconstruction of the W22703-specific PZ (Figure 3).
With a total length of ~ 142,000 kb, it is significantly

shorter than that of 8081 and exhibits a comparably
low density of virulence genes. Many discrete functional units of the 8081 PZ are indeed missing in the
W22703 genome as confirmed by BLAST search of
any PZ-encoded protein against the translated shotgun
sequence. The most prominent ones are (i) the pathogenicity island YAPIYe of 66 CDS including a putative
hemolysin, a toxin/antitoxin system ccdA/ccdB, and a
type IV pilus operon, (ii) the T3SS ysa important for
pathogenicity in an mouse oral infection model [27]
and (iii) the T2SS yst1 required for full virulence [28].
Further 8081 PZ genes absent in W22703 are the two
putative two component-systems (TCS) YE3561/
YE3563 and YE3578/YE3579, a chitinase (YE3576), a
putative lipase (YE3614), a putative copper/silver efflux
system (YE3626-YE3630), and the arsenic resistance
operon. However, it is also worthy of note that PZ loci
assumed or known to play a role in pathogenicity

towards invertebrates or vertebrates are present in the
W22703 genome. Examples are the YGI-1 mentioned
above, the hydrogenase 2- (hyb-) locus, fecBCDE
encoding an iron transporter, the ferric enterbactin
transport system fepBDGC/fes, and proP encoding a
betain/proline transporter involved in osmoprotection
and osmoregulation.
The recently identified flagellar cluster Flg-2 [29]
within the PZ of W22703 is absent in the genome of
8081. It comprises 44 genes encoding factors for the flagellar motility apparatus and for flagellar biosynthesis,
but lacks chemotaxis genes (Figure 3). A region of
approximately 11,300 bp flanked by a transposase gene
and the replicon of an IncF plasmid RepFIB comprises
an ABC transporter and a regulatory gene; however, the
functionality of this region, which is unique with respect
to all Yersinia sequences available so far, is in doubt due
to its low coding density.

Surface components

The main flagella and chemotaxis gene cluster I (flg-1)
of 8081 is present in W22703 (contigs 1361, 1428, 1469
and 1890), but only one of two type-1 fimbrial operons
was found (contig 1271; YE0782-YE0786). The surfaceexposed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule constituting
the serotype O:9 O-antigen is synthesized by the Opolysaccharide gene cluster (contig 1162) [30]; a second
glycosyltransferase gene cluster is located on contig
1878 (Figure 2A). The role of the O-polysaccharide and
the outer core hexasaccharide in resistance of Y. enterocolitica to human complement and polymyxin B has
been described recently [30].
Metabolism

Several enzymatic activities common to both Y. enterocolitica genomes compared here are involved in nitrogen
metabolism. Examples are the capability to catalyse
urease that is encoded by seven genes on contig 1225.
The assimilation of the urease product ammonia for
amino acid and nucleotide synthesis is then achieved by
glutamine synthase. Two ornithine decarboxylases forming putrescine, and a putrescine/ornithine antiporter are
encoded on the PZ and also contribute to amino acid
metabolism.
Like 8081, strain W22703 carries the cel gene cluster
for cellulose production (contig 1798) and the genes
mdoC, mdoG and mdoH for osmoregulated periplasmic
glucan (OPG) biosynthesis (contig 1967). Both the capability to produce cellulose and to synthesize OPGs
have been lost or inactivated in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. OPG mutants exhibit deficiencies in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance, as
well as hypersensitivity towards bile salts [18].
The capability to utilize propanediol in a cobalamin
(vitamin B12)-dependent manner is encoded on contigs
2012, 1667, 1476, 1555, 1999, and 1235, and the respective cob/cbi/pdu genes are collinear to the 8081 genes
YE2707-YE2750. In line with the yersiniae core genome,
ttr genes responsible for tetrathionate reduction are present (contig 1975), and the eut genes allowing B 12 dependent ethanolamine utilization are absent. The mtn
genes located on contig 1812 are involved in methionine
salvage. This cobalamin-dependent pathway recycles
methylthioadenosine derived from sperimidine, spermin
and N-acylhomoserine lactone synthesis. The hydrogenases Hyd-4 encoded within the hyf locus (contigs 1162,
1947) and Hyd-2 within the hyb locus (PZ; contig 1891,
Figure 3) are also present in W22703.

Page 8 of 14

(contig 1812). The reductases encoded on contigs 1186
and 1976 suggest that W22703, but not 8081, is able to
use nitrate and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as alternative
electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, pathways for trimethylamine and thiosulfate oxidation are present in both genomes. Beside the DMSO
reductase, contig 1186 harbours another ROD encoding
an ABC transporter, a putative nitrilase or cyanide
hydratase that catalyzes nitrile into amino acids and
ammonium or hydrogen cyanid into formamide, and a
putative acetamidase or formamidase. Contig 1973 carries a gene cluster enabling W22703 to uptake N-acetylgalactosamine that is then isomerized to tagatose. In
addition to YE0550A-YE0555, we identified a second
operon for sucrose utilization on contig 1240.
Metabolic pathways lost in W22703

We identified few enzymes or capabilities that are missing in W22703 in comparison to 8081 (Table 3). Examples are the absence of a chitinase, and of the lipase
YE3614 that is probably responsible for the lipase negative reaction of W22703 as a biotype 2 strain [31]. In
addition to the arsenic resistance operon on YAPI Ye ,
homologs of a second operon with this function
(YE3364-YE3366) are absent in W22703.
Dynamic genomes: further regions absent in W22703 or
8081

Whole genome comparison allows to follow the
dynamic processes by which genomes separate from a
common ancestor. In addition to genomic islands or
clusters already mentioned above, the genomes of the
two Y. enterocolitica strains compared here differ by a
set of regions, indicating the dynamic of sequence acquisition and loss. The prophage regions YE98 (YE0854YE0888), YE185 (YE1667-YE1693), YE200 (YE1799YE1819) and YE250 (YE2292-YE2363) of strain 8081 are
absent in strain W22703 that, however, carries another
prophage of 37 CDS in contig 1796. Then, the Yersinia
genome islands YGI-2, YGI-3 and YGI-4 [18] are missing in W22703. YGI-2 carries genes for the synthesis,
modification, and export of an outer membrane
anchored glycolipoprotein. Of this island, only homologs
of YE0912 encoding a 2,5 diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase B and of YE0911 encoding a 3-oxo-acyl-(acyl carrier
protein) synthase II are present in W22703. On contig
1854, we identified two homologs of YE0979, which
encodes a DNA-binding protein, and the hypothetical
gene YE0980 from YGI3 harbouring a putative integrated plasmid.

Distinct metabolic properties of W22703

W22703 is endowed with several metabolic enzymes
that are unique in comparison to strain 8081 (Figure
2A), among them a serine-pyruvate transaminase
involved in glycine-, serine- and threonine-metabolism

Discussion
The genome analysis and genome comparison performed here intended to contribute to a better understanding of the ecology, pathogenicity and evolution of

Y. enterocolitica. Adding, rearranging and reducing or
losing DNA has been proposed as the general recipe for
Yersinia genome evolution when eight less-pathogenic
strains had been compared [17].
Several ROD shown in Figure 2A-B and Figure 3
might be recent acquisitions due to the significant deviation of their G/C content, while others might have been
acquired early after separation of both strains, or indicate regions that have been lost or substituted in 8081.
Beside the virulence plasmid, the PZ is a second example for the acquisition of virulence genes. Remarkably,
this region is approximately 55 kb shorter in W22703
and lacks several determinants proposed or known to
contribute to pathgenicity towards humans. Together
with the presence of a large ancient flagellar gene cluster and a region of obvious genetic degeneration, this
finding strongly reflects the lower virulence potential of
W22703 in comparison to 8081 [32], and confirms the

YE0510A, YE1110
YE3515

importance of this region for the manifestation of virulence properties of Y. enterocolitica [18].
Other (virulence) regions absent in W22703 might
have been acquired by 8081 after separation of both
strains. The novel T3SS (ysa2) that is absent in the
pathogenic species Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis,
but present in apathogenic species such as Y. intermedia, Y. frederiksenii and Y. kristensenii, might play a role
in the interaction with non-mammalian hosts. The TC
proteins have been shown to be secreted upon activity
of the plasmid-encoded T3SS of Y. pestis [33]. Since we
used a pYV-free W22703 derivative to demonstrate TCbased insecticidal activity of this strain [13], ysa2 is a
candidate for TcaA secretion by W22703. This finding
supports the assumption that T3SS are not unique vehicles for delivering anti-vertebrate factors but ancient
secretion systems for the transport of effector molecules
across host membranes, with the potential to play a role

Fuchs et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:168
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/168

in a wide range of bacteria-host interactions [34].
Together with a number of putative virulence factors of
W22703 (Table 2), ysa2 contributes to the pathosphere
of yersiniae, a concept hypothesizing that all of the
pathogenic genes shared by enteric bacteria form a
“pool” [35].
The pathogen Y. enterocolitica has a complex life cycle
encompassing aquatic and biological environments. Due
to its known capability to interact with invertebrates
and mammals, it exhibits a multiphasic phenotype upon
colonizing and potentially killing more than one host
species [36]. Although little is known about putative signals and regulatory circuits required to switch or modulate necessary changes from one state to the other,
candidates are genes listed in Table 2 or induced at low
temperature [37].
Although some of their functions remain to be experimentally confirmed, the metabolic pathways present in
strain W22703 confirm the relevance of several metabolic traits for gut-adapted Y. enterocolitica. Examples
are cobalamin-dependent utilization of propanediol,
hydrogenase activities, cellulose production, tetrathionate reduction and ornithine decarboxylase activity, all
of which are absent, lost or inactivated in systemic Y.
pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis [17,18]. Interestingly,
tetrathionate that acts as a terminal electron acceptor
during anaerobic degradation of 1,2-propanediol or
ethanolamine is formed in the inflamed gut upon infection [38]. The hydrogenases Hyd-4 and Hyd-2 might
contribute to the adaptation of yersiniae to gut environments [39,40]. Two additional reductases of W22703
allowing to use nitrate and DMSO are in line with this
assumption. A potentially insect-specific resistance
mechanism and/or catabolic trait of strain W22703 is
provided by the ROD of contig 1186 (Figure 2A)
inserted between YE0815 and YE0816. It encodes an
acetamidase/formamidase, a branched chain amino acid
transporter, an ABC transporter and a putative nitrilase/
cyanide hydratase. These predicted functions point to a
role of this chromosomal region in the acquisition of
nitrogen sources. Indeed, insects such as Zygaena filipendulae produce cyanogenic glucosides that might
then be used by W22703 as nitrogen source via a metabolic route of bacteria that includes cyanide nitrilase,
hydratase and formate dehydrogenase activities [41-43].
Although speculative so far, the functions of contig
1186 might represent a further determinant contributing
to invertebrate host adaptation of strain W22703. The
operon on contig 1973 including a PTS is responsible
for tagatose utilization; this metabolic trait is not only
common to human intestinal bacteria, but was found to
be specifically induced during insect infection by P.
luminescens [44,45]. Interestingly, the PZ gene bsh
encodes a chologlycin hydrolase or bile salt hydrolase

Page 11 of 14

(Figure 3) that catalyzes the deconjugation of conjugated
bile salts to liberate amino acids and free primary bile
acids [46].
Recently, a genome comparison between the genomes
of the insect pathogen P. luminescens and Y. enterocolitica 8081 revealed a huge number of common genes
that might contribute to the adaptation of yersiniae to
invertebrate hosts [37]. Interestingly, we identified nearly
all of these factors also in the genome of W22703,
underlining the assumption that Y. enterocolitica strains
share the capability to interact with nematodes or
insects.

Conclusion
Although further genome sequences are required to
learn more about the evolution of Y. enterocolitica
strains, this study indicates that beside the Yersinia virulence plasmids, the highly flexible PZ indeed contributes
to the acquisition of determinants that might increase
the pathogenicity towards humans. On the other hand,
insecticidal toxins, the novel T3SS or specific metabolic
properties might play a crucial role for the adaptation of
Y. enterocolitica strains to non-mammalian hosts.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Y. enterocolitica W22703(pYVe227) is a nalidixic acidresistant (NalR) restriction mutant (Res-Mod’) isolated
from strain W227 [47]. A plasmidless isogenic derivative
(W22703 pYV-) was used. To avoid contaminations and
to validate the strain cultured for DNA isolation, strain
W22703 pYV - was streaked from a glycerol stock on
Yersinia selective agar plates (CIN agar base; Becton
Dickison, Heidelberg, Germany). A single colony was
used for inoculation of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (10 g l-1
tryptone, 5 g l-1 yeast extract, and 5 g l-1 NaCl) containing 20 μg ml-1 nalidixic acid, and the culture was grown
for twelve hours at a selective temperature of 15°C.
When the culture had reached stationary phase, aliquots
were plated in parallel on LB and Yersinia seletive agar
plates. PCRs targeting W22703-specific genes tcaA, tcaC
and two genes of Flg-2 were performed as a further
control.
General molecular techniques

DNA and RNA manipulation was performed according
to standard procedures [48]. To isolate chromosomal
DNA, 1.5 ml of a bacterial culture was centrifuged, and
the sediment was resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer
(100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl).
After incubation for 15 min on ice, 10 μl of 10% SDS
and 5 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) were added, and
the sample was incubated overnight at 55°C. The chromosomal DNA was then precipitated with 500 μl of

isopropanol, washed in ethanol, dried, and dissolved in
500 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA,
pH 7.4) containing 1 μl of RNase (10 mg/ml). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out with Taq
polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithunia) and the following programme: one cycle at 95°C for 2 min; 30
cycles at 95°C for 10 sec, at the appropriate annealing
temperature for 30 sec, at 72°C for 45 sec to 180 sec
depending on the expected fragment length; one cycle
at 72°C for 10 min. 4 μl of chromosomal DNA (100 ng
ml-1) was used as template for PCR amplification, and
the GeneRuler DNA mix (Fermentas) served as DNA
ladder. For gap closure, the following oligonucleotides
were used (targeted contigs): 5’-CAACATTAAATCACGAAGG-3’/5’-TTAGTACAAATACCGATGG-3’ (1804/
1807); 5’-GTTTCTTTATGGGCGCG-3’/5’-TTGGCATGGAGGCCTG-3’ (1891/1803); 5’-TAACCTCTAGCGCGG-3’/5’-CCCCGATAGTTCTGG-3’ (1088/
1891).

uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/yersinia). The criterion
applied was an 80% identity of the amino acid sequence.
Incomplete proteins encoded on contig ends were considered to be present in strain W22703 if the lacking
sequence could be identified on another contig. Genome
sequences of Yersinia strains were obtained from the
NCBI database and compared using the homepage
http://www.microbesonline.org/. Protein sequence alignment was done with the ClustalW program [57]. Phylogenetic trees for ROD and T3SS have been automatically
calculated using the the software PhyloGenie [58] and
the default parameters according to its documentation.
We used NCBI nr [59] as reference database and
excluded proteins of unclassified taxa.

Additional material
Additional file 1: FR accession numbers of all W22703 contigs.
Additional file 2: W22703 gene names, locus tags, and protein
accession numbers.
Additional file 3: Mauve-type genome alignment between the
reference genome of strain 8081 (chromosome and plasmid; top)
and draft genome of strain W22703 (contigs; bottom). Red lines
indicate chromosome and contig borders. Similar regions are indicated
by frames and assigned to each other by connecting lines. The degree
of sequence similarity is shown within each region as similarity plot.

Genome sequencing and accession

High throughput sequencing of a shotgun library was
done on the GS FLX system (Roche, 454 Life Sciences,
Branford, USA) using the Titanium series with approximately 20-fold coverage, and assembly were performed by
Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany. According
to the newly defined standards for classification of genome
sequences [49], the Y. enterocolitica genome sequence
belongs to the category “Annotation-Directed Improvement”. The EMBL accession numbers for the sequences
reported in this paper are FR718488-FR718797. The raw
sequence data files are deposited in the ENA trace archive
as ERP000495. The annotated sequence is available under
the URL address http://pedant.gsf.de.
Genome annotation and analyses

The PEDANT software system (http://pedant.gsf.de;
[50]) was used for automatic genome sequence analysis
and annotation [16]. Protein coding genes were predicted using the GeneMarkS software program using
default settings [51]. Biochemical pathway prediction
and reconstruction were performed using the KEGG
[52], BRENDA [53], and Microbes online [54] databases.
tRNAs were identified using tRNAscanSE [55], rRNA
homologs with blastn [56]. Additional manual homology
searches of predicted proteins were performed by
BLAST analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)
to ascribe a protein function or domain.
Comparison with the genome sequence of Y. enterocolitica 8081 (EMBL accession numbers are AM286415 for
the chromosome and AM286416 for the virulence plasmid pYV; PEDANT database name is p3_p190_Yer_
enter) was performed using the Y. enterocolitica Blast
Server from the Sanger Institute (http://www.sanger.ac.
