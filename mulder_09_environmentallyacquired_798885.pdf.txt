Abstract
Background: Early microbial colonization of the gut reduces the incidence of infectious,
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recent population studies reveal that childhood hygiene is
a significant risk factor for development of inflammatory bowel disease, thereby reinforcing the
hygiene hypothesis and the potential importance of microbial colonization during early life. The
extent to which early-life environment impacts on microbial diversity of the adult gut and
subsequent immune processes has not been comprehensively investigated thus far. We addressed
this important question using the pig as a model to evaluate the impact of early-life environment
on microbe/host gut interactions during development.
Results: Genetically-related piglets were housed in either indoor or outdoor environments or in
experimental isolators. Analysis of over 3,000 16S rRNA sequences revealed major differences in
mucosa-adherent microbial diversity in the ileum of adult pigs attributable to differences in earlylife environment. Pigs housed in a natural outdoor environment showed a dominance of Firmicutes,
in particular Lactobacillus, whereas animals housed in a hygienic indoor environment had reduced
Lactobacillus and higher numbers of potentially pathogenic phylotypes. Our analysis revealed a
strong negative correlation between the abundance of Firmicutes and pathogenic bacterial
populations in the gut. These differences were exaggerated in animals housed in experimental
isolators. Affymetrix microarray technology and Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction revealed
significant gut-specific gene responses also related to early-life environment. Significantly, indoorhoused pigs displayed increased expression of Type 1 interferon genes, Major Histocompatibility
Complex class I and several chemokines. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis further confirmed
these results.

Conclusion: Early-life environment significantly affects both microbial composition of the adult gut
and mucosal innate immune function. We observed that a microbiota dominated by lactobacilli may
function to maintain mucosal immune homeostasis and limit pathogen colonization.

Background
The gastrointestinal tract contains an immense number of
micro-organisms, collectively known as the microbiota.
The major functions of the microbiota include degrading
dietary compounds, influencing nutrient partitioning and
lipid metabolism, providing essential nutrients generated
as a result of microbial metabolism, protecting against
invading pathogens and stimulating gut morphology [14]. The gut microbiota also plays an important role in
maintaining immune function. Recent work suggests that
the commensal microbiota influences processes as complex as pathogen colonization, immune development and
homeostasis, T cell differentiation, inflammation, repair
and angiogenesis [5-8].
The impact of the microbiota on host immunity is
thought to be critically regulated in early life and inappropriate exposure to bacteria during this developmental window has been linked to the increased incidence of
infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [911]. Clearly, the neonatal period is a critical time for gut
colonization, and can be affected by numerous factors
including gestational age, birth environment, mode of
delivery, nutrition and antibiotic use [12,13].
The increase in immune-mediated disorders, particularly
in Westernized countries, has led to the so-called Hygiene
Hypothesis, which postulates that the growing incidence of
immune-mediated diseases is the consequence of reduced
infection and exposure to microbes during early childhood [14]. In this context, the high-hygiene status of western lifestyle, decreased infection rates and reduced
bacterial load as a result of widespread use of vaccines and
antibiotics are likely to be important contributory factors
[15]. Animal models have provided some insight into
immune-disease aetiology: animals susceptible to
autoimmune disease have an increased incidence and
severity of disease when bred under germ-free conditions
whereas disease is prevented when the animals are
exposed to bacteria [16]. This evidence supports the
notion that, in addition to naturally-acquired infections,
colonization by the normal commensal microbiota is an
important factor limiting the incidences of immunemediated diseases. Consistent with this is the growing
awareness of the importance of the commensal microbiota in immune education in early life [8], which appears
to involve complex mechanisms of host-bacterial crosstalk [5,17-21].

In the current study we have investigated potential interactions between the rearing environment, gut microbiota
and immune function in the developing pig gut using
molecular methods to evaluate both microbial diversity
and host immune gene expression. Microbial diversity in
the gastrointestinal tract of these animals was characterized by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries. Specific responses in transcriptome expression patterns of gut
ileal tissue were studied using Affymetrix GeneChip Porcine Genome microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
Biomarkers associated with immune function and altered
by rearing environment were identified and investigated
more thoroughly by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).

Results
Mucosal microbial diversity in the ileum of pigs from
different environments
We investigated the influence of environmentallyacquired bacteria on the composition of the adult
mucosa-adherent ileal microbiota in the pig. Animals
were housed in an indoor (IN) or an outdoor facility
(OUT), as well as in individual isolator units receiving
daily doses of antibiotics (IR). Mucosa-adherent bacterial
samples from the ileum and fecal samples were collected
from all experimental animals at day 56. In addition to
this, fecal samples were taken from adult sows from both
the indoor (INS) and outdoor (OUTS) environments to
confirm 'environment' as the major factor contributing to
the experimental differences. Microbial composition of
the ileum was examined by calculation of diversity indices
and analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of 16S rRNA
gene sequences derived from clone libraries of each treatment. After quality control, a total of 3,089 validated
clones were analyzed.
Diversity Measures
We first investigated the effects of environment and highhygiene status on a number of bacterial diversity indices.
Estimates of diversity, richness and library coverage for
the 16S rRNA clone libraries from IN, OUT and IR are
shown in Table 1. Species richness, estimated by Chao1,
was highest in the IR and IN groups but lower in the OUT
group. Good's coverage was 90.97 to 93.47% for all three
treatment groups, with the lowest coverage in IR libraries.
Rarefaction analysis of clone libraries confirmed these
findings and suggested that the IR and IN groups possessed the most diverse mucosa-adherent bacterial com-

mucosal libraries. Novel phylotypes continued to be identified up to the end of sampling (Figure 2C).

diversity (Figure 1).
Collector's curves of the observed and estimated phylotype richness are shown in Figure 2A-C. Each curve reflects
the series of observed or estimated richness values
obtained as more clones were added to the data set. After
an initial steep rise, the curves level out, suggesting that
the majority of phylotypes in the treatment groups were
adequately sampled. In the early stages of sampling and
clone sequencing, both Chao1 and abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) showed a sharp increase, together
with the observed phylotype number, in the IN group
(Figure 2A). After the sampling of about 190 clones, the
gap between the observed and estimated phylotype richness was relatively constant, indicating repeated sampling
of same phylotypes within samples. In the OUT group,
the gap between the observed and estimated phylotype
richness was constant after the sampling point of 110
clones (Figure 2B). The difference between the estimated

Calculations were made based on OTU definition at 99% sequence
identity (N = 4).

Phylogenetic affiliation of 16S rRNA gene sequences
Phylogenetic analysis was performed to establish taxonomic positioning of obtained sequences. All 16S rRNA
gene sequences from the mucosa-adherent ileal and fecal
samples were subjected to the Ribosomal Database
Project (RDP) Classifier analysis (95% confidence threshold). Based on the classification results, the majority of
clones were assigned to four phyla: Firmicutes (69.7% of
all sequences), Proteobacteria (17.7%), Bacteroidetes
(11.4%), and Actinobacteria (0.5%) (Figure 3 and Table
2). The two major phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes,
were significantly different between the libraries: the Firmicutes showed a significant increase in the OUT group
compared to the IR group, while the Bacteroidetes were
significantly increased in both the INS and OUTS fecal
libraries compared to the mucosa-adherent ileal libraries.
Firmicutes
Seventy percent of all sequences were affiliated with the
Firmicutes phylum. The outdoor environment favoured
the expansion of Firmicutes compared to the hygienic
environment (Figure 3). At the lower taxa level this difference was even more pronounced.

A large number of sequenced clones fell into the Bacilli
class. The most abundant order was Lactobacillales, which
was dominated by Lactobacillaceae, but also contained
Streptococcaceae, Leuconostocaceae, Enterococcaceae,
Carnobacteriaceae and Aerococcaceae, although present
in lower abundance.
The Lactobacillaceae family in the OUT group (77.2% of
sequences) consisted of a small number of operational
taxonomic units (OTUs), including Lactobacillus reuteri, L.
amylovorous LAB31, L. johnsonii, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. salivarius and L. mucosae (Figure 4). In contrast,
the IN library contained only 12.8% Lactobacillaceaeaffiliated clones, although phylotypes were similar to
those observed in the OUT group. L. reuteri, L. delbrueckii
and L. johnsonii were all significantly decreased compared
to the OUT group. The high-hygiene conditions associated with IR exacerbated these differences. L. amylovorous
LAB31 and L. brevis were present in very low abundance in
the IR libraries (3.58% of sequences) whereas L. reuteri, L.
delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. johnsonii and L. mucosae
were not detected in this treatment group.
The observed differences in Lactobacillus levels between
the IR and OUT group were confirmed by enumeration of
bacteria in gut contents of both ileum and colon on de
Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar. The OUT group had

Phylogenetic distribution of clones obtained from mucosa-adherent ileal and fecal samples in different housing environments
Phylogenetic distribution of clones obtained from mucosa-adherent ileal and fecal samples in different housing
environments. The majority of clones were assigned to the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. The Firmicutes phylum was significantly increased in the OUT group compared to the IR group (P < 0.05). The Bacteroides phylum was significantly increased in both the INS and OUTS fecal libraries compared to the mucosa-adherent ileal
libraries. Values are expressed as means ± SEM (N = 4).

three to four log10 colony forming units lactobacilli/g
more than the IR group, thus validating the 16S rRNA
gene library results (Additional file 1).
Members of the Clostridia class were present in all treatment groups with 28.2% of all sequenced clones classified
as Clostridia. Interestingly, pigs raised in the indoor environment showed the highest abundance of this class.
Clostridiaceae-affiliated clones were highly abundant in
the IN group and mainly identified as uncultured species.
Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 was significantly elevated in the IN libraries compared to the OUT and IR
libraries (Figure 5). The indoor environment also
favoured the expansion of the bacterial clone
HH_aai33h06 (EU775688) on the ileal mucosa compared to the outdoor environment.
The Peptostreptoccocaceae family was another abundant
member of the Clostridia class, accounting for 19.1% of
the sequenced clones in all treatment groups. The indoor
environment favoured the expansion of Peptostreptoccocaceae. Seven predominant OTUs, represented by mainly
uncultured clones, were identified. Sequences of uncul-

tured clones BARB_aaa02d03 were significantly higher in
the IN and IR groups compared to the OUT group and
were not detected in the indoor fecal libraries (Figure 5).
This possibly points to a preferential colonization of the
ileal mucosa in the indoor environment. Uncultured bacterium clone BARB_aaa01f06 was significantly increased
in the ileal mucosal libraries of the IN group compared to
the OUT and IR groups, indicating a potential antibiotic
sensitivity of this bacterium.
Bacteroidetes
Bacteroidetes were found in all libraries but in different
abundance. The most abundant group within this phylum
was represented by members of the Prevotellaceae family,
followed by Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteroidaceae and,
to a lesser extent, Sphingobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae.

All 16S rRNA gene libraries contained members of Prevotellaceae, yet they were most prevalent in the indoor environment, particularly in fecal libraries. High-hygiene
conditions increased the numbers of Prevotellaceae on
the ileal mucosa.

strains H1498/H1215 and A. rossii strain JF1390. This
clone has been isolated from the intestine and reproductive tract of pigs and is considered an opportunistic pathogen implicated in spontaneous abortion.
High-hygiene status increased the number of γ-proteobacteria on the ileal mucosa. All 16S rRNA gene libraries from
the IR group contained members of the γ-proteobacteria
class and grouped mainly with Enterobacteriaceae,
including sequences identified as E. coli spp. with pathogenic properties which may pose a health risk for the
young pig as well as the human population.

Proteobacteria
Eighteen percent of all clones were placed into the Proteobacteria phylum. γ-proteobacteria and ε-proteobacteria
were the most abundant groups, while members of the αand β-proteobacteria were found only sporadically.

Members of the ε-proteobacteria were the second most
abundant group within the Proteobacteria phylum and
were represented by two major bacterial families, Helicobacteraceae and Campylobacteraceae. Most clones were
obtained from the IN group and included bacteria of recognized pathogenic phenotype (13% of IN sequences).

Twenty-eight γ-proteobacteria clones were obtained from
the OUT mucosa-adherent libraries. These included E.

composition attributable to differences in housing environment, a key goal of this study was to determine
whether this translated into different host-specific gene
responses. Therefore, an Affymetrix GeneChip microarray
analysis was conducted on ileum tissue from the same site
used for 16S rRNA gene library construction.
Effects of treatment extremes on gene expression
Perhaps not surprisingly, mucosa-adherent microbial
diversity in the ileum was most affected by experimental
isolator housing, as this constituted a high-hygiene environment. To ascertain the differences in host-specific transcriptional responses between this treatment and the
natural outdoor environment (treatment extremes),
Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed on the
comparison IR versus OUT at day 5 (neonatal stage), day
28 (weaning age) and day 56 (nearing maturity).

Seventy-four probesets were differentially expressed (P <
0.01 and -2 ≤ fold change ≥ 2) at the neonatal stage (Figure 6 and Additional file 2A). Fifty-six of these genes were

highly expressed in the IR group, while 18 genes were
higher in the OUT group. Interestingly, within the IR gene
set, increased expression of genes that are closely linked to
Type 1 interferon (IFN) signalling was observed. These
genes included IRF7, FAM14A, UBE2L6, GBP2 and USP18.
Some of the most highly-regulated genes (up to 11-fold
higher in the IR group) were viperin, a tightly regulated
ISGF3 target gene [22], and IRP6, a pig-specific gene
homologous to human viperin. Another group showing
increased expression in the IR group included 15 genes
involved in cholesterol synthesis, such as DHCR7,
DHC24, SC5DL, HMGCS1, CYP51A1 and ERG1. Genes of
interest showing higher expression in the OUT group
compared to the IR group included TLR2 as well as HBB
and HBA1, both of which code for haemoglobin proteins.
At day 28, 111 genes were differentially expressed (Figure
6 and Additional file 2B). Twenty-one of the 83 transcripts
expressed at higher levels in IR were the same as those
found at day 5, and included the IFN-induced genes IRF7
and GBP2. Several other Type 1 IFN-induced genes (G1P2,

Significantly affected bacterial clones in the mucosa-adherent ileum of animals in different housing environments. Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, as well as uncultured bacterial clone BARB_aaa01f06, BARB_aaa02d03 and
HH_aai33h06 were significantly decreased in the OUT library compared to the IN library. Uncultured bacterial clone
BARB_aaa01f06 and Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 were also significantly decreased in the IR group. Values are expressed
as means ± SEM (N = 4).

IFIT2, IFIT3, MX2, ISG20 and IFITM3) were higher in IR
animals compared to OUT animals, indicating a consistent treatment effect on Type 1 IFN signalling pathways.
Also in common with the day 5 gene expression set, nine
cholesterol synthesis genes were increased in the IR group.
Consistent with these findings, microbiota-driven effects
on cholesterol metabolism and trafficking have been previously documented [23]. Other transcripts expressed
higher in the IR group compared to the OUT group
included the chemokines CXCL12, CCL28, CCL2, CCL8
and CXCL9, the chemokine receptor CCR5 and the chemokine ligand CCL4L. PMP22 was increased in the OUT
group. This gene is co-expressed with occludin and zona
occludens 1 at tight junctions in epithelial cells [24].
Sixty-six genes were differentially expressed between IR
and OUT at day 56 (Figure 6 and Additional file 2C).
Some of the genes showing higher expression in the IR
group included KAI1, CEBPB, LTB4DH, COL14A1 and
COL1A2. Changes in CEBPB (CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein beta) expression in IR animals may be functionally important as this gene is involved in the regulation of
inflammatory responses [25]. Notably, a group of T-cellrelated genes was increased in OUT animals, including

TCA_HUMAN, LY96, CD8A, TRGV9, LCP1, LCP2, CXCL9
and TEC, all of which are involved in T cell signalling,
expansion, activation and trafficking. Other highly
expressed transcripts in the OUT group included EGR1,
SELL (important for leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions), PIGR (poly-Ig receptor) and PIK3CG.
Consistently, PDK4 was higher in the OUT group compared to the IR group at all three time-points. PDK4 has an
important function in glucose metabolism, and its expression is regulated by glucocorticoids, retinoic acid and
insulin; however, its potential relevance in host-microbe
interactions is currently unknown.
Biological pathway analysis revealed that a large number
of Immune response pathways were affected (Table 3 and
Figure 7A). Other highly represented pathways included
G-protein and Congenital, hereditary and neonatal diseases
and abnormalities. Consistent with the analysis of individual gene data, the pathway for Immune response-IFN alpha/
beta signalling was increased at day 28 and day 56 in the IR
group compared to the OUT group. Immune response-Antigen presentation by MHC class l was affected at all three
time-points and also higher in IR compared to OUT. Gene

Differentially expressed genes in the ileum of animals housed in different environments. Differentially expressed
genes at each time-point are shown for the two treatment comparisons (P < 0.01, -2 ≤ fold change ≥ 2, N = 6). Microbiota differences between the treatment groups were associated with large differences in gene expression in the ileum.

Ontology (GO)-enrichment analysis (Table 4) further
confirmed these findings. While a number of GO categories were consistently affected by treatment, including
Immune response (GO:0002376), the major biological
process affected was Antigen processing and presentation
(GO:0019882). Other affected GO-processes were Antigen
processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I
(GO:0002474), Antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen (GO:0048002) and Antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via MHC class II
(GO:0002504).
Effects of housing environment on gene expression
Differences in ileal mucosa-adherent microbial composition between the IR group and the OUT group were associated with large host-specific transcriptional differences
in the ileum. We next set out to assess whether the microbial differences associated with the IN and OUT environments had a similar impact on the gut transcriptome of
the pig. While the number of differentially expressed

genes between IN and OUT housed animals was smaller
than between the treatment extremes (i.e. IR and OUT),
similar trends could be discerned.
In the neonatal pig, the expression levels of 13 probesets
were differentially expressed between the IN and OUT
animals (Figure 6 and Additional file 2D). Nine genes
were higher in IN animals, and this included CXCL9,
which is involved in T cell trafficking. Four genes showed
higher expression in OUT animals, including TFRC.
In weaning animals, 42 genes were differentially
expressed between the two rearing environments (Figure
6 and Additional file 2E). Twelve transcripts were higher
in IN animals, including TAFA2 (distantly related to
CCL3), CCR1 and CXCR4. Of the 30 genes that were
higher in the OUT group, genes of interest included
PMP22, CNKSR1, TJP4 and LTBR (all increased between
two- and three-fold).

MetaCore pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes of animals housed in different environments
MetaCore pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes of animals housed in different environments. Differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) were imported into GeneGo MetaCore analytical software to determine significantly
enriched canonical pathways in each group. Data represent the distribution in cell process categories of statistically significantly
enriched pathways (P < 0.05) of the comparisons IR vs OUT (A) and IN vs OUT (B). Most pathways from both comparisons
group into five categories: G-proteins; G-protein coupled receptor; congenital, hereditary and neonatal diseases and abnormalities; immune response; and development. Note that there is redundancy in category allocation.
The largest differences in gene expression were observed at
day 56, when 71 genes were differentially expressed
between the treatments (Figure 6 and Additional file 2F).
Transcripts increased in IN animals (60 probesets in total)
included three Type 1 IFN-inducible genes (IFRD1, OAS1
and IFIT2). The antibacterial peptide genes LYZ (Lysozyme C precursor), PI3 (elafin precursor) and BPI (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein precursor) were
increased 6.92-, 6.8- and 2.93-fold, respectively, in IN animals compared to OUT animals and may contribute to
the observed differences in microbiota composition
between these groups. Furthermore, these peptides appear
to maintain gut homeostasis as evidenced by their aberrant expression in Crohn's Disease [26] and Ulcerative
Colitis [27]. CCL8 (a monocyte chemotactic protein) was
also higher in the IN group. Some of the 11 genes
increased in OUT animals were PMP22 and SELL, in
accordance with the observations from the IR and OUT
comparison.
The most affected pathways belonged to Immune response,
G-protein and Congenital, hereditary, and neonatal diseases

and abnormalities (Table 5 and Figure 7B), as observed previously in the treatment extremes comparison.
Real-time quantitative PCR to analyze differentially
expressed genes
Real-time PCR was performed for CCL28, CCL8, CXCL12,
CXCL9, CXCR4, IFIT2, FKBP5, IRF7, IRP6, MT1J, MX,
PDK4, PI3, SELL, SQLE and TFRC. These genes were
selected from the gene expression data set both because
they showed significant changes and because of their
involvement in key immune system pathways. Verification of the true differential expression between treatment
groups of these genes by Real-time PCR was therefore considered essential for further biological interpretation.

The subsequent correlation between Affymetrix microarray and Real-time PCR data (R2 = 0.8405; P < 0.001; Figure
8) was positive, further substantiating the biological
importance of the selected genes and identified pathways.
Real-time PCR verification for the comparison IR versus
OUT showed that direction and magnitude of fold change
correlated well with the Affymetrix microarray results

Discussion
The current study sought to investigate the effects of environmental hygiene on microbial colonization and composition of the gut microbiota. Additionally,
transcriptomic profiling was performed to assess the

impact of environmental hygiene on gene expression, in
particular those genes and pathways associated with
immune function. Both indoor and isolator (representing
urban lifestyle and high-hygiene status, respectively), and
outdoor (representing rural lifestyle and low-hygiene status) conditions were compared using pigs as an experimental model.
Using extensive analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries our
study categorically revealed that early-life environment
has a major impact on microbial diversity and that these
differences are sustainable throughout adult life. Many of
the bacterial phylotypes identified in our study are commonly found in the human and animal gastrointestinal
tract [28-30]. Our results also identified that only 3.3% of
the clones had less than 97% sequence similarity to existing database entries.

A major finding of the current study was the significant
increase in the Firmicutes phylum in sow-reared pigs
housed in outdoor environments compared to littermates
housed in isolators with daily antibiotic treatment.
Within the Firmicutes phylum, the most compelling
observation was the abundance of lactobacilli in animals
reared in the outdoor environment. Lactobacilli are often
associated with the suckling pig and early stages of colonization in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, the high
abundance of lactobacilli in the fecal samples obtained
from truly adult sows identified lactobacilli as normal colonizers of the adult pig microbiota in the outdoor environment. Leser et al. [28] found similar high-abundance
phylotypes associated with the ileum, including L. amylovorous, L. johnsonii and L. reuteri, in pigs from different rearing environments. Our study further revealed that an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/79

increase in hygiene status in pigs housed both indoor and
in isolators with antibiotic administration was associated
with a significant decrease in mucosa-adherent lactobacilli. Affected species included L. reuteri, L. delbrueckii, L.
amylovorous, L. johnsonii and L. mucosae.
The reduced microbial diversity in outdoor animals compared to indoor and isolator housed groups was a somewhat surprising outcome. These outdoor animals were
exposed to a huge variety of different bacterial species, as
well as fungi, Archaea and viruses, originating from both
maternal and environmental sources. The soil especially is
hugely abundant in micro-organisms, and estimates of
soil diversity show the presence of at least 32 phyla, the
dominant members of which are Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [31]. Soil ecosystems potentially

Lactobacillus strains [36]. Importantly, the greater abundance of L. reuteri in the outdoor animals may contribute
to the enhanced presence of other Lactobacillus species as
well as the decreased microbial diversity observed in these
animals. A further point meriting comment is the reduced
presence of potentially pathogenic phylotypes in outdoorhoused pigs. These phylotypes were clearly present in
both indoor and isolator housed animals, although animals showed no overt signs of infection. The specific
reduction in Firmicutes, in particular lactobacilli, in these
pigs may affect the normal mechanisms of colonization
resistance that control potentially pathogenic populations
within the gut ecosystem.

provide an important source of microbes for gut colonization of outdoor animals. However, only a selective subset
of environmental bacteria colonize the intestine, since we
noted that the pig gut microbiota was comprised of a
restricted number of phyla, dominated by Bacteroidetes
and Firmicutes, consistent with published findings on the
diversity of the adult human gut [29]. Current thinking
has focussed on the benefits of a highly diverse gut microbiota, as it has long been considered that this confers
greater plasticity of the bacterial community to respond to
perturbations within the gut ecosystem [17]. Paradoxically, we found that exposure to a large variety of environmental microbes in early life does not generate greater
diversity in the adult gut but rather leads to a microbiota
that is dominated by a limited number of phyla composed of bacteria with proven health-promoting properties.
Lactobacilli have long been known for their health-promoting effects and they directly limit the prevalence of
several intestinal pathogens including E. coli and salmonella [32-34]. In this study, L. reuteri was one of the most
abundant members of the mucosa-adherent microbiota
of the outdoor group. Reuterin, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial substance, is produced by L. reuteri [35] and inhibits most intestinal bacteria with the exception of

Although there has been a major focus on health-promoting probiotic actions of lactobacilli following their introduction as oral supplements, significantly less attention
has been paid to the effects of naturally-acquired, gut-colonizing (autochthonous) lactobacilli. Given that immune
modulation is dependent on gut colonization, close proximity to the mucosa and host adaptation, naturallyacquired lactobacilli clearly deserve greater attention. Of
those species studied, L. casei, L. johnsonii and L. plantarum
are strong inducers of IL-12 and/or INF-γ, thereby favouring a Th1 cytokine profile [37,38]. Conversely, L. reuteri
inhibits the induction of IL-12 and TNF-α and also attenuates L. casei-induced IL-12 [38]. A fine balance between
Th1-polarising lactobacilli strains and those which counterbalance such responses may be an important factor in
maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis and explain
the lack of overt Th1 or Th2 responses in outdoor-housed
pigs in the current study.
While there was no evidence of Th1/Th2 pathways being
affected, we found significant effects of environment on
the Type 1 interferon (IFN) signalling pathways. Isolatorreared pigs exhibited increased gene expression levels of
the IFNα/β transcription/signalling factors IRF7 and
USP18. Type 1 IFN signalling induces the expression of a
large number of target genes, which in the current study
included MX2, G1P2, ISG20, FAM14A, IFIT2 and IFIT3.
Three Type 1 IFN-inducible genes (IFRD1, OAS1 and
IFIT2) were increased in indoor-housed animals compared to outdoor-housed animals, indicating that the
IFNα/β pathway is directly affected by the housing environment. A number of recent studies further support our
data describing the influence of the gut microbiota on the
Type 1 IFN pathway. For example, conventionalized pigs
exhibited increased expression of IRF7, STAT1 and STAT2
when compared with their germ-free counterparts [39].
Conversely, bacterial colonization of germ-free mice led
to a decreased expression of the IFN-related genes IRF7,
ISGF3G, IFIT1 and STAT1[40]. Our study further qualifies
these findings by establishing that specific microbial composition, rather than the microbiota as such, influences

Type 1 IFN signalling during early colonization and development.
Type 1 IFNs have many biological properties, including
innate, cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses
[41]. Much evidence has focussed on their central role in
pathogen resistance, especially viral immunity through
recognition of dsRNA. The significance of Type 1 IFNs in
response to bacterial colonization and infection is receiving increasingly more attention [42,43]. IFN expression is
induced in numerous cell lineages, including macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, by bacterial components such as LPS and CpG DNA [44-46]. It is worth
noting that the transcriptome analysis was performed on
whole ileal tissue samples, rather than on a specific cell
subset. In this study we elected to study interactions and
contributions of all cell lineages present in the gut to comprehensively characterize the transcriptomic changes
induced by different microbiota compositions. However,
the contribution of individual lineages such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), which naturally produce Type
1 IFN, will be addressed in subsequent studies.

IFN-α/β has profound effects on immune cell development [41] by regulating the differentiation of B and T
cells, myeloid DCs and natural killer cells. Activation of
immature DCs by IFN-α/β upregulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Consistent with this, we
found that antigen presentation by MHC class I was also
affected by the microbiota and was upregulated in indoor
reared animals which also displayed increased Type 1 IFN
levels. MHC class I molecules are Type 1 IFN-inducible
genes whose promoter regions contain typical IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs). MHC class I molecules
are specialized for presentation of endogenously synthesized proteins, including self-proteins, to the TCR of
CD8+ T-cells [47]. The cross-presentation of antigens on
MHC class I molecules, the induction of CTL responses
and the subsequent memory CD8+ T cell survival are also
dependent on IFN-α/β.
Increased expression of MHC class I in the indoor environment was accompanied by the upregulation of a plethora of chemokines, including CCL2, CCL8, CCL28, CCR1,
CXCR4 and CXCL12. Chemokines are chemotactic

BMC Biology 2009, 7:79

cytokines that function during immune responses to
recruit effector cells to sites of inflammation and infection. They are involved in the pathophysiology of many
diseases. Numerous chemokines have been implicated in
the pathology and perpetuation of tissue destructive
inflammatory processes in patients with IBD, including
CCL2 [48] and CCL8 [49]. Increased expression of these
chemokines in the indoor-housed animals indicates the
presence of an immune-activated gut microenvironment.
This contrasts with the lack of innate and pro-inflammatory gene expression in the outdoor-housed animals,
which may be indicative of a more immune-tolerant and
homeostatic mucosal immune system in these animals.
Further studies are required to assess the impact of the
microbiota, immune gene transcription and immune cell
lineages on specific tolerance towards food and environmental antigens and long-term predisposition to infection, food intolerance and allergy.

Conclusion
Environmental exposure in early life has a significant
impact on microbiota composition of the adult gut and
the immune transcriptome during development. Rural,
outdoor environments support the establishment of a
natural microbiota dominated by lactobacilli and containing low numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria
and this may be an important factor in maintaining
mucosal immune homeostasis and limiting excessive
inflammatory responses in the gut. The significance of the
microbiome and transcriptome data presented herein in
relation to immune events such as oral tolerance and host
defence against enteric pathogens is a major focus of our
future studies.

Methods
Experimental animals and tissue collection
Twelve Large White × Landrace sows (Sus scrofa) were
housed at either an indoor (intensive) or an outdoor
(extensive) facility. The sows were artificially inseminated
by the same boar to minimize genetic variation among the
offspring. Three piglets from each outdoor-housed sow
(OUT) and indoor-housed sow (IN) were left to suckle
with the mother until day 28, when all piglets were
weaned. Three piglets from each indoor-housed sow (18
piglets in total) were transferred to individual isolator
units at the School of Clinical Veterinary Science (University of Bristol, UK) at 24 hours of age. These piglets were
given a daily dose of antibiotic cocktail (Baytril (Bayer
Healthcare, Uxbridge, UK) and Amoxinsol 50 (Vétoquinol UK Ltd., Buckingham, UK)) for the duration of the
study. Up until day 28, the isolator-housed piglets (IR)
were fed commercial porcine milk replacer (PiggiMilk,
Parnutt Foods Ltd., Sleaford, UK) dispensed by an automated liquid feeding system. From day 29 onwards, all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/79

piglets were fed creep feed (Multiwean, SCA Nutrition Ltd,
Thirsk, UK) ad libitum. The experiment was run in three
consecutive replicates, using four sows and 18 piglets in
every replicate.
Six randomly chosen piglets per treatment group were sacrificed by injection of sodium pentobarbitone (Euthesate,
Willows Francis Veterinary Ltd, Crawley, UK) at timepoints on day 5, 28 and 56. The ileum, defined as the
region corresponding to 75% in length from the pyloric
sphincter, was excised. Detailed molecular analysis was
performed on this site as it represents a key region
involved in both immune-inductive and effector activities, including bacterial antigen sampling. Two ileal tissue
samples were taken and either washed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/0.1% Tween 20 (SigmaAldrich, Gillingham, UK) for construction of mucosaassociated 16S rRNA gene libraries (10-cm piece) or processed in ice-cold PBS and transferred to RNAlater (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK) for Affymetrix microarray
and Real-time PCR studies (2-cm piece). All animal work
was performed according to the institutional and Home
Office UK ethical guidelines.
Analysis of the mucosal microbiota
Gut contents (N = 4 per treatment group) were removed
from the ileum, and the tissue was washed with ice-cold
PBS and incubated in ice-cold PBS/0.1% Tween 20 overnight. Detached bacteria were harvested by centrifugation
at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Total DNA from the pellet
was isolated using a DNA Spin Kit for Soil® (QBiogene
Inc., Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA genes was
carried out with the universal primer set S-D-Bact-0008-aS-20 (5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3'; positions 8 to
27 in the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene) and S-*-Univ1492-a-A-19 (5'-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'; positions 1510 to 1492) [50]. Primer positions are represented according to the OPD nomenclature [51]. PCR
cycling conditions were one cycle at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 57°C for 30 sec,
72°C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
PCR products were purified with the Wizard® SV Gel &
PCR Clean-up System (Promega, Southampton, UK),
cloned into the pCR-4 cloning vector and transformed
into E. coli TOP 10 chemically competent cells (TOPO TA
Cloning Kit; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant colonies were
picked and the inserts were sequenced in the RINH
genomics facility (University of Aberdeen, UK) using the
primer set S-*-Univ-0907-a-A-20 (5'CCGTCAATTCATTTGAGTTT-3') and S-*-Univ-0519-a-A-18 (5'-GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG-3') [50]. All clone libraries were
constructed under identical conditions in order to mini-

mize sample-to-sample variation, thus the relative differences in microbial composition between the samples truly
reflect animal treatment differences.
Enumeration of Lactobacillus species
Approximately 70 mg gut contents from IR and OUT animals at day 56 from both the ileum (IR: N = 3; OUT: N =
2) and the colon (IR: N = 4; OUT: N = 3) were transferred
to Hungate tubes containing 2 ml of MRS broth/0.2%
Tween 80 (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and dispersed by vortexing. The gut content suspensions were diluted in a
series of seven sequential ten-fold dilutions. Twenty
microlitre aliquots of the dilutions were plated out on
MRS agar plates and dried off. The plates were placed in
an anaerobic gas jar and incubated at 37°C. Plates were
read and data recorded and calculated after 48 hours of
incubation.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were assembled using Lasergene 6 software
(DNASTAR Inc.; Infogen Bioinformatics, Broxburn, UK)
and tested for possible chimeras using Chimera Check
v2.7 (online analysis at RDP-II website, http://
rdp8.cme.msu.edu/cgis/chimera.cgi?su=SSU and Bellerophon
[52]http://foo.maths.uq.edu.au/~huber/bellero
phon.pl. Sequences with no close neighbours in RDP-II
were additionally subjected to Basic Local Alignment
Search
Tool
(BLAST)
analysis
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. Chimeric and poor quality sequences were excluded from further phylogenetic
analysis.

The resulting 16S rRNA gene contigs were aligned using
Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation
(MUSCLE, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/muscle[53]) and
the alignments were inspected manually. The distance
matrix (generated from the multiple sequence alignment)
was calculated using the Dnadist application of the Phylogeny Inference Package http://evolution.genetics.wash
ington.edu/phylip.html and Jukes-Cantor distance of
0.01. This stringent phylotype definition at 99% cut-off
was used in part because evidence suggests that bacteria
with nearly-identical 16S rRNA sequences may represent
variable genotypes and different species [29].
Rarefaction and collector's curves of observed phylotypes,
richness estimates and diversity indices were determined
with the DOTUR program [54] using Jukes-Cantor corrected distance matrix. The bias-corrected Chao 1 richness
estimator was calculated after 1000 randomizations of
sampling without replacement. Collector's curves of
observed and estimated (Chao 1 and the abundancebased coverage estimator, ACE) richness were constructed. Diversity was estimated using the Shannon (H)
and Simpson indices (D). The Simpson reciprocal index

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/79

was calculated as 1/D, and another version of the Simpson diversity index as 1-D. The Good's coverage percentage was calculated with the formula [1-(n/N)] × 100,
where n is the number of phylotypes in a sample represented by one clone (singletons) and N is the total
number of sequences in that sample [55].
Similarity search of the 16S rRNA gene sequences against
database entries was performed using the BLAST program
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. By
using a >99% sequence similarity criterion, the sequences
were assigned to the respective bacterial phylotypes.
Phylotype comparisons were made among groups of subjects using the Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple comparisons were carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test, with P
< 0.05 considered statistically significant.
Microarray hybridizations and data analysis
Ileal tissue (200 mg) (N = 6 per treatment group/timepoint) was removed from RNAlater and lyzed in Trizol
(Invitrogen). RNA was isolated using standard chloroform/isopropanol steps. Total RNA was further extracted
with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to
the manufacturer's instructions, including an RNase-free
DNase I (Qiagen) digestion step. RNA integrity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Wokingham, UK).

Eight microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed to
cDNA and then transcribed into biotin-labelled cRNA
using the One-Cycle Target Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
cRNA quality was determined by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Hybridization to the GeneChip Porcine Genome
Array (Affymetrix) on a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450
(Affymetrix) was performed at the Institute of Medical Sciences Microarray Core Facility (University of Aberdeen,
UK). Chips were scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip
Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Image quality analysis was
performed using Gene Chip Operating Software (GCOS)
(Affymetrix).
Further quality analysis, normalization by GeneChip
Robust Multiarray Averaging (gcRMA), statistical analysis
and heatmap generation was performed with the freely
available software packages R http://www.r-project.org
and Bioconductor http://www.bioconductor.org[56]. In
particular we used the moderated F-test provided by the
Bioconductor package limma to test for differential expression [57].
Statistical analysis was performed separately for each of
the three time-points (day 5, 28 and 56) on the two group

comparisons IR vs OUT and IN vs OUT. As detailed in the
first Methods subsection, the animal experiments consisted of three replicates with two piglets in each of the
three experimental groups. This has created a three-group
design, with six biologically independent samples in each
group and replicate as an additional blocking factor.
To address the multiple testing issue the Storey method
[58] was used to calculate q-values, as implemented in the
Bioconductor package qvalue. This method gives estimates
of the associated false discovery rate for a given cut-off.
Although these q-values are shown in Additional file 2,
the lists of differentially expressed genes were not based
only on q-values or P-values, but tried to address the balance between statistical significance and biological relevance. Thus, differences in gene expression between
treatments were determined using a cut-off of P < 0.01
and -2 ≤ fold change ≥ 2. This approach is very much in
line with recommendations based on the Micorarray
Quality Control study (MAQC) [59], which recommends
the use of fold change ranking plus a non-stringent P cutoff as a baseline practice in order to generate more reproducible differentially expressed gene lists.
Microarray data were submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE15256; http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).
Functional analysis of microarray data
Gene Ontology (GO) based functional interpretation of
the data was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID
2006; http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov), an expanded version
of the original web-accessible programs described by Dennis et al. [60]. Significantly different transcripts (P < 0.05)
were allocated into the GO category Biological Process to
unearth patterns of gene expression significantly enriched
for specific GO terms.

All differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) were
imported into MetaCore analytical software (GeneGo, St
Joseph, MI) to generate pathway maps. MetaCore is a proprietary, manually curated database containing human
protein-protein, protein-DNA and protein compound
interactions, metabolic and signalling pathways, and the
effects of bioactive molecules. MetaCore software contains approximately 450 canonical signalling and metabolic pathways. Porcine Affymetrix probeset IDs were
converted into human Affymetrix probeset IDs using
annotation supplied by Tsai et al. [61]. Integrated pathway
enrichment analysis was performed using the knowledgebased canonical pathways and endogenous metabolic
pathways. Ranking of relevant integrated pathways was
based on P-values calculated using hypergeometric distribution. P-values represented the probability of a given

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/79

number of genes from the input list to match a certain
number of genes in the map by chance, considering the
numbers of genes in the experiment versus the number of
genes in the map within the full set of all genes on maps.
Real-time PCR analysis of differentially expressed genes
The mRNA levels differentially expressed between the
treatment groups in microarray analyses were further validated using Real-time PCR. Two micrograms of total RNA
isolated from the ileum (N = 6, isolated for microarray
analysis) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the
High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems) with random primers. Real-time PCR analysis
was performed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) with the Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers (Sigma-Aldrich;
Additional file 3) were designed for the porcine sequence
of interest using Primer Express Software v3.0 (Applied
Biosystems). PCR cycling conditions were one cycle at
95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec
and 60°C for 1 min, ending with a dissociation step. All
samples were run in triplicate. EEF1A1 was selected as a
reference gene for normalization due to its low variation
between samples in the microarray analysis.

Data were analyzed on a logarithmic scale with base 2 by
Student's t-test allowing for unequal variances with P <
0.05 considered statistically significant. Standard errors of
differences were also calculated on this scale. Differences
were back-transformed to calculate fold changes.
