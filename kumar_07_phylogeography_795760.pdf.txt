Abstract
Background: The water buffalo- Bubalus bubalis holds tremendous potential in livestock sector in
many Asian countries, particularly India. The origin, domestication and genetic structure of the
Indian river buffalo are poorly understood. Therefore, to understand the relationship among the
maternal lineages of Indian river buffalo breeds and their domestication process, we analysed
mitochondrial D-loop region of 217 animals representing eight breeds from eight different
locations in India along with published sequences of Mediterranean buffalo.
Results: The maximum parsimony tree showed one major clade with six internal branches.
Reduced median network revealed expansion from more than one set of haplotypes indicating
complex domestication events for this species. In addition, we found several singleton haplotypes.
Using rho statistics, we obtained a time estimate of 6300 years BP for the expansion of one set of
hapltoypes of the Indian domestic buffalo. A few breed specific branches in the network indicated
an ancient time depth of differentiation of some of the maternal lineages of river buffalo breeds.
The multidimensional display of breed pairwise FST values showed significant breed differentiation.
Conclusion: Present day river buffalo is the result of complex domestication processes involving
more than one maternal lineage and a significant maternal gene flow from the wild populations after
the initial domestication events. Our data are consistent with the available archaeological
information in supporting the proposition that the river buffalo was likely to be domesticated in the
Western region of the Indian subcontinent, specifically the present day breeding tracts of the
Mehsana, Surati and Pandharpuri breeds.

Background
The domestic water buffalo is a major source of meat,
draught, hide and employment to the marginal farmers
and landless labourers in many Asian countries. Broadly,
water buffalo is of two types: 1) River buffalo- distributed
in the Indian sub-continent, Middle-east and Eastern
Europe. 2) Swamp buffalo- distributed in North-eastern

parts of India, Bangladesh, China and South-east Asian
countries [1]. India has approximately ninety-eight million buffalo, primarily of the river type, representing fiftysix percent of the total world population. The importance
of this species to the Indian dairy industry is immense;
buffalo constitute 35% percent of the bovine population
in India but they contribute more than 55% to the total

milk production. There are at least nine well-defined
breeds in India, representing approximately 30% of the
total buffalo population of 90 million; the remaining animals are non-descript [2].
Mitochondrial genome is inherited through maternal lineage only, and unlike the nuclear genome there is a complete absence of genetic recombination in mtDNA. These
two factors along with the comparative ease of genotyping
of large number of individuals have meant that mtDNA
polymorphisms have found tremendous usage in the evolutionary studies of maternal lineages of various species.
Five to ten fold higher mutation rate of mtDNA control
region as compared to that of single copy nuclear genes
makes mtDNA control region extremely suitable for studying the process of derivation of domesticated animal
stocks from their respective wild ancestors. Mitochondrial
D-loop DNA sequences have provided significant insights
into the domestication and past migration history of cattle [3-5], sheep [6], goat [7,8] and pig [9]. It has become
increasingly clear that most of the livestock species have
been domesticated more than once [5,7,10,11]. Recently,
it has been shown that the Indian river buffalo has been
domesticated independent of the swamp buffalo [12,13].
To analyse the population structure of the Indian river
buffalo, and to understand the process of their domestication, we have analysed the mitochondrial D-loop region
of 217 animals from the eight different breeds sampled
from eight locations in India. We have also included in
our analysis the published mtDNA D-loop sequences of
the Mediterranean buffalo.

Results
Mitochondrial DNA variation in Indian river buffalo breeds
The comparison of mtDNA D-loop region (954 bp) of
eight Indian river buffalo breeds revealed 135 different
mitochondrial haplotypes resulting from seventy-four
variable sites. The ratio of transitions: transversions was
high (17:1), revealing a strong transition bias in the
domestic river buffalo, as has also been observed for cattle
[4] and goats [7,8]. Haplotype diversity values ranged
from 0.940 ± 0.020 in the Toda to 0.997 ± 0.011 in the

Pandharpuri breed (Table 1). To find out the breed effect
on mtDNA sequence variation, we performed AMOVA
analysis. Breed was a significant source of variation (P <
0.01) contributing to 10.54% of the total variation; the
remaining 89.46% of variation was within breeds. The
variation in the D-loop DNA sequences did not provide
any support to the grouping of these breeds based upon
geographical and morphological criteria [1], since only a
small fraction of the total variation was attributed to
between-groups variation component. However, classification of the Toda breed as one group, and the remaining
seven breeds into a second group explained 8.83% (P <
0.01) of the total variation indicating that the betweenbreeds variance component was mainly a result of disproportionate contribution from the Toda.
To further investigate the breed differentiation, FST values
were calculated for all the possible breed pairs. No differentiation was observed between the Mehsana-Jaffarabadi
and Murrah-Nagpuri pairs and maximum differentiation
was found between the Toda and Bhadawari breeds (23.2
%). Multidimensional scaling display of pair wise FST values revealed a strong evidence for structuring among these
breeds with a stress value of 0.047 (Fig. 1). The eight river
breeds included in our study appeared to form five clusters. We checked whether mitochondrial data set showed
equilibrium with respect to change in diversity through
drift and migration. A significant positive correlation (r =
0.59, P < 0.02) between the geographical distance and corresponding FST value for the various breed pairs indicated
that migration and drift were in equilibrium (Fig. 2). Our
earlier study using microsatellite genotyping data indicated sub-structuring in the Pandharpuri breed [14].
Therefore, we repeated our IBD analysis with D-loop DNA
sequences after removing the Pandharpuri breed from our
analysis and we obtained a higher correlation co-efficient
(r = 0.7259, P < 0.007).
Phylogenetic analysis
To understand the population structure of the Indian river
buffalo, we constructed the maximum parsimony tree

Mediterranean haplotypes intermingled with the Indian
buffalo haplotypes. It may be noted that the Mediterranean haplotypes were distributed in three of the seven
branches representing the Indian river buffalo.

Reduced median network analysis of river buffalo
Reduced median network based upon a 921 bp sequence
(Fig. 4) revealed the lack of a single star-like appearance of
the network connecting all the present day river buffalo
haplotypes. This was contrary to the typical signatures of
expansion of a few seeding haplotypes after domestication, and the subsequent derivation of the present day
haplotypes through mutational steps. Nevertheless,
within a complex network of a plethora of singletons,
there were two regions, one at each end of the network,
suggesting expansion from the founding haplotypes. At
one end, there were four haplotypes, interconnected
through one mutational step, three of which acted as radiating nodes for a large number of haplotypes. At the other
end of the network, there was an isolated node (R1) connecting twenty-five animals within one mutational step.
To test the significance of this grouping, we performed
AMOVA analysis by classifying 217 Indian animals into
two groups, viz.; 1) twenty-five animals with one mutation step away from the node R1, and b) all the remaining
Indian buffalo as a separate group. This classification
explained 55.75% of the total molecular variation present
in the Indian animals data. To determine whether this
duality was encompassing various geographical regions,
we constructed reduced median networks based on the
hypervariable region I (375 bp) for each breeds (data not
shown). The Mehsana network was extremely complex. In
all the remaining breeds, excepting the Nagpuri from Central India, there was a general tendency towards this
dichotomy. It may be noted that all animals shown on
internal branches of the river buffalo clade in parsimony
tree were also located distantly in the network away from
the expanding haplotypes. Interestingly, majority of the
individuals of the Mehsana and Surati breeds sampled
from Western India, were distributed all over the network
as singletons. Further, we found a few breed-specific
maternal branches in the network.
Dating of population expansion of Indian river buffalo
Reduced median network (Fig. 4) showed multiple and
overlapping star-like appearances suggesting expansion of
the corresponding haplotypes in the background of several singletons. The time depth of the expanding haplotypes in a reduced median network can be calculated
using rho statistics [15]. To estimate the time of expansion
of some of the founding haplotypes of the river buffalo,
we performed reduced median network for the hypervariable region I [see Additional file 1]. In this network, many
of the expanding haplotypes that might have acted as
nodes were interconnected through a single mutational

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/186

step, thus making it difficult to estimate the time depth of
their expansion. However, we could calculate the rho statistics for the minor lineage of river buffaloes represented
by the R1 node (Fig. 4 & see Additional file 1) since the latter was isolated in the network. We obtained a rho value
of 0.756 (95% confidence interval: 0.582 – 0.864) resulting into an expansion time of 6300 years BP using a mutation rate of 32% per nucleotide Myr-1[16].

Discussion
Both the AMOVA and MDS display of FST values suggested
a strong breed effect on the D-loop sequence variation.
The MDS display based on the mitochondrial sequences
was broadly reminiscent of the cluster structure of these
breeds obtained from 27 microsatellite loci [14] with two
notable exceptions. The microsatellite markers showed
clustering of the Mehsana and Bhadawari breeds along
with an admixture of the Murrah, Surati and Nagpuri
breeds. However, in the present study the maternal lineage of the Mehsana breed stood out from the admixture
and instead located itself along with the Jaffarabadi (Fig.
1). Similarly the maternal lineage of the Bhadawari breed
tended to make its own cluster. There is an anecdotal evidence to suggest that the Mehsana breed has been an outcome of gene flow from the Murrah males in the recent
past. That would explain one of the major differences in
the clustering results obtained from the maternal and
autosomal markers. Generally it is believed that the breed
formation may be a very late activity with a low time
depth vis-à-vis the process of domestication of a particular
livestock species [11] and the breed differentiation may be
the result of an intensive selection mainly operating
through the paternal lineages. However, it was surprising
to note strong breed effect on the mitochondrial variation
(Fig. 1). A few breed specific branches in the network (Fig.
4) indicated an ancient time depth of differentiation of
some of the maternal lineages of river buffalo breeds. It
appears that the very concept of 'breed' in the river buffalo
may not have the same connotation as in the case of modern breeds of cattle in the Western world [3,4]. These
results should have obvious implications in arriving at
rational decisions aimed at conservation of buffalo
genetic variability [2].

The phylogenetic analysis in the present study unveiled
one main clade with six internal branches for the river
buffalo. The Mediterranean haplotypes intermingled with
the Indian buffalo haplotypes. This is consistent with a
common origin of the Mediterranean and Indian domestic river buffalo. In reduced median network there was evidence in support of expansion from four nodes, out of
which one node, namely R1, was far off from the remaining three expanding nodes. There were several minor
branches and a large number of singleton haplotypes
located far away from these nodes. Our phylogenetic and

network results clearly demonstrated that the present day
river buffalo are an outcome of a complex domestication
process. Multiple domestication events appear to be a rule
rather than an exception in livestock species [5,10,11]. For
an example, horses have been domesticated from several
wild populations at different locations and a few mitochondrial lineages of modern horse population are breedspecific [10]. With the Indian buffalo, particularly the
Mehsana breed, the situation is much more complicated
because of the presence of several singleton haplotypes. It
might be possible that a very large number of females with
highly divergent mitochondrial sequences contributed to
the domesticated stocks. Alternatively, there might have
been a 'trickling in' effect in terms of continuous addition
of females from the wild to the domestic herds over an
extended period. The co-existence of the domestic and
wild stocks in the same time and space, an essential
requirement in favour of such a scenario, has been well
known [14,17].
Our estimate of the expansion time of one of the haplotypes was 6300 years BP using rho statistics. Water buffalo

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/186

has been depicted on the Indus Valley civilization seals
dated around the third millennium BC. This information
has been used to suggest that buffalo was probably
domesticated around that time in these areas [18]. Such a
proposition does not stand scrutiny. On the contrary, the
form and context are more akin to these individuals being
of the wild types. Wild buffalo remains have been recovered from ancient sites in Balochistan- Mehargarh in Pakistan and Santhli in North Gujarat [17]. Buffalo remains
dating around mid third millennium BC from KutchDholavira, Gujarat in India are thought to be from the
domestic buffalo as determined from the size differences
between the Dholavira and Santhli/Mehargarh remains
[17]. These workers have argued that the suggested importance of milk and milk products during the Harappan
times [19,20] and the presence of domestic buffalo during
this period are consistent with each other, implying that
water buffalo might have already been the dairy animal in
the Indus Valley civilization by then. Further, on the basis
of size diminution of the buffalo from Dholavira, it has
been suggested that the process of domestication of water
buffalo was likely to be extended earlier than the Harappan period [17]. The time estimate of expansion of at least
one of the haplotypes of river buffalo (6300 years BP) in
the present study is consistent with this suggestion of
these authors.
The present study showed extremely high haplotype diversity in the Mehsana, Surati and Pandharpuri breeds from
Western India (Fig. 5 & Table 1). It is expected that the
genetic variability would be higher at the point of origin
of the domesticated species. Therefore, it is reasonable to
propose that if the buffalo was domesticated in the Indian
subcontinent, the Western region represented by the
present day breeding tract of the Mehsana, Surati and
Pandharpuri breeds appears to be the most likely candidate. A closer examination of our reduced median network [see Additional file 1] indeed supported such a
proposition. The network analysis revealed four nodes
with an indication of expansion of the founding haplotypes in an otherwise very complex network resulting
from several singletons. These nodes and additional haplotypes within two mutational steps away from any of
these nodes included 140 individuals. Approximately
48% of the Mehsana, Surati and Pandharpuri animals
belonged to this group. On the other hand, the individual
contribution of the remaining five breeds to this group
ranged from 63% in the case of the Murrah breed to 90%
in the Toda breed, suggesting a decline in the D-loop haplotype complexity in these five breeds as one moved away
from the sampling sites of the Mehsana/Surati/Pandharpuri animals. In this context it is interesting to note that
the Western region of India is home to several recognized
breeds of river buffalo encompassing extensive phenotypic [1] and microsatellite DNA variations [14]. Earlier

we reported four haplotypes of cytochrome b gene in a sample of eighty buffalo representing different breeds [12].
Interestingly, all these four haplotypes were present
between Surati and Pandharpuri animals against the presence of any two of these haplotypes in the remaining
breeds. We have not examined the mitochondrial
sequences of buffalo from Pakistan. It may be possible
that the site(s) for domestication of buffalo may extend to
the Pakistani areas.

NC_006853) was used as the out-group. A maximum parsimony (MP) tree was constructed using MEGA 3.1 [25].
The close-neighbour-interchange algorithm was chosen
with a search level of three. The searches included 100 replications of random addition trees with 1000 bootstrapping. In addition, the reduced median network was
applied to the dataset containing 228 sequences of river
buffalo (Indian and Mediterranean) using NETWORK
4.1.1.2 program [26] with the parameters set to a weight
of two and threshold value of one.

Conclusion
We have earlier shown that the Indian river buffalo were
domesticated independent of swamp buffalo [12]. Our
present study supports the following scenario of the river
buffalo domestication. The Mediterranean and Indian
domestic river buffalo have been derived from the same
stocks through a complex process. During domestication
and/or afterwards there might have been a continuous
influx of maternal variability from the wild buffalo into
the domestic stocks. The time of expansion of at least one
of the several expanding haplotypes was estimated to be
6300 years BP. If the river buffalo was domesticated in the
Indian subcontinent, as has been suggested by archaeological studies, the Western region represented by the
present day breeding tract of the Mehsana, Surati and
Pandharpuri breeds appears to be the most likely candidate region.

Methods
Sample collection, amplification and sequencing of
mitochondrial DNA
Two hundred and seventeen river buffalo samples representing eight different breeds from Northern, Northwestern, Central and Southern India (Fig. 5) were used in this
study. The sampling and sequencing protocol have been
described in our earlier study [12].
Sequence alignment and population analyses
AUTOASSEMBLER (Perkin Elmer) and CLUSTALX programs [21] were used for sequence editing and alignment
purpose respectively. Haplotype diversity, AMOVA and
population pairwise differences (FST) were calculated
using ARLEQUIN version 2.001 [22]. The pair wise FST values were displayed by multidimensional scaling (MDS)
using SPSS11.0. Isolation by distance (IBD) between
breeds was examined by Mantel's tests [23] as implemented in IBD 2.1 program [24].
Phylogenetic analyses
To construct phylogenetic tree, 135 D-loop haplotypes
obtained from 217 Indian river buffalo sequences and 11
published haplotypes of Mediterranean buffalo were
used. We considered a 945 bp fragment of the D-loop
region for which sequences were available for the two
types of river buffalo. Bos taurus (NCBI: accession no.:
