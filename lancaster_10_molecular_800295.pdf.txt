Molecular evolutionary rates predict both
extinction and speciation in temperate
angiosperm lineages

Abstract
Background: A positive relationship between diversification (i.e., speciation) and nucleotide substitution rates is
commonly reported for angiosperm clades. However, the underlying cause of this relationship is often unknown
because multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors can affect the relationship, and these have confounded previous
attempts infer causation. Determining which factor drives this oft-reported correlation can lend insight into the
macroevolutionary process.
Results: Using a new database of 13 time-calibrated angiosperm phylogenies based on internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) sequences, and controlling for extrinsic variables of life history and habitat, I evaluated several potential intrinsic
causes of this correlation. Speciation rates (λ) and relative extinction rates (ε) were positively correlated with mean
substitution rates, but were uncorrelated with substitution rate heterogeneity. It is unlikely that the positive
diversification-substitution correlation is due to accelerated molecular evolution during speciation (e.g., via enhanced
selection or drift), because punctuated increases in ITS rate (i.e., greater mean and variation in ITS rate for rapidly
speciating clades) were not observed. Instead, fast molecular evolution likely increases speciation rate (via increased
mutational variation as a substrate for selection and reproductive isolation) but also increases extinction (via
mutational genetic load).
Conclusions: In general, these results predict that clades with higher background substitution rates may undergo
successful diversification under new conditions while clades with lower substitution rates may experience decreased
extinction during environmental stasis.
Background
Rates of molecular evolution often correlate positively
with taxonomic diversity in angiosperms [1-6]. However,
it has been difficult to distinguish among the many competing hypotheses for why clades with fast rates of nucleotide substitution (at various nuclear and organelle noncoding loci) also seem to be more speciose than clades
with relatively conserved non-coding DNA regions.
Hypothesized causes of the positive relationship between
molecular evolution and diversification may be divided
into two categories. Hypotheses for extrinsic causes suggest that aspects of a clade's ecology (its habitat or traits
adapted to habitat) affect rates of both molecular evolu* Correspondence: lancaster@nceas.ucsb.edu

tion and diversification, but these rates do not directly
affect each other (Hypothesis 1, Table 1). Hypotheses for
intrinsic causes suggest that speciation or extinction
events directly influence the average rate of molecular
evolution for a clade, or conversely, suggest that rates of
molecular evolution directly influence speciation or
extinction events (Hypotheses 2 and 3, Table 1). A large
body of previous work indicates that extrinsic, ecological
effects are likely important contributors to the relationship between rates of diversification and molecular evolution. For example, shifts in environment, life history, or
key innovations may subsequently influence both diversification and substitution rates [4,7,8]. However, it
remains unclear whether there also remains a direct
effect of diversification on rates of molecular evolution,
or vice versa, when major ecological traits are accounted
for. If such a direct relationship linking diversification and

Table 1: Currently published hypotheses supported by a positive correlation between diversification and nucleotide substitution rates.
Extrinsic (Ecological)
explanations:

1) Evolutionary rates are causally
unrelated to the process of speciation, but
are linked to traits or habitats that
promote diversification.

1a) Life history. Increased generation time can cause mutations to
accumulate faster over absolute time than they do in organisms
with a slower life history [7,20,34] Shorter generation times are
positively correlated with species richness of clades [8], possibly
because shortened life cycles and/or enhanced mobility
associated with smaller size allow individuals to colonize more
extreme habitats.

1b) Environmental energy. High levels of environmental energy
such as UV radiation and temperature are mutagenic and tend to
speed up development, resulting in increased rates of nucleotide
substitution. Environmental energy is linked to both species
richness and to rates of molecular evolution, but environmental
energy does not appear to affect speciation rates via its effect on
mutation rates. Instead, environmental energy directly affects
both species-richness and faster evolution [4].

Intrinsic
explanations:

2) Faster rates of molecular evolution in
speciose clades are caused by rapid bursts
of evolution during speciation events.

2a) Rapid evolution due to drift during speciation: If speciation
commonly occurs in small, peripheral populations [e.g., founder
event speciation, [10,35], then speciose clades will be more likely
to have experienced reduced population sizes throughout their
evolutionary history. Under conditions of reduced population
sizes, selection is relaxed and slightly deleterious mutations may
accumulate, contributing to enhanced substitution rates
throughout the genome [9].

2b) Rapid evolution due to increased selection pressure during
speciation: Speciation involving adaptation to a new niche or
geographic range will involve strong selection favoring traits
adaptive in the new environment. In this process of adaptation,
average population fitness may decline, reducing population
sizes [19]. Selection is also more likely to favor mutations of large
effect early in the process of adaptation [36]. The combined
effects of smaller population sizes and selection for mutations of
large effect might allow slightly deleterious and neutral
mutations to hitchhike to fixation, causing rapid turnover of
alleles throughout the genome during speciation.

3) Faster rates of molecular evolution may
cause speciation, by:

3a) Increasing the rate at which reproductive isolation develops
between isolated populations [37].

3b) Increasing the rate of production of new adaptations via
increased mutational genetic variation [17].

Statistical artifact
explanation:

4) Finally, the relationship between
diversification and molecular evolution
may be a statistical artifact.

When multiple substitutions have occurred at the same
nucleotide position, this is undetectable on unbranched clades.
However, if branching events have occurred between these
'multiple hits', then multiple substitutions at the same site are
detectable. It will therefore appear as though the more speciose
clade has undergone more substitutions (i.e., evolved faster) than
its species-poor counterpart. This artifact is known as the node
density effect [12,38].

speciation rates does exist, then the form of this relationship may reveal evolutionary genetic processes involved
in historical speciation events [9-11], potentially improving our understanding of when and how speciation and
extinction will occur.
Previous studies focused on establishing the ubiquity of
the positive correlation between diversification and
molecular evolution across plant clades, but often were
unable to distinguish among the four major, published
hypotheses for what drives the relationship (hypotheses
listed in Table 1). These previous studies of evolutionary
rates commonly employed sister group comparisons,
obtaining the result that the more speciose sister clade
has longer branches, on average, than its species-poor
sibling. This measure is limited because it does not discriminate between the effects of speciation vs. extinction
on extant diversity, leaving uncertainty in which of these
two evolutionary processes are actually correlated with
nucleotide substitution rates. Without controlling specifically for each of these factors, it is impossible to determine whether a direct relationship exists between the
processes of either speciation or extinction and rates of
nucleotide substitution. Furthermore, using sister group
comparisons, it is impossible to directly test for variation
in the tempo of evolution within clades (i.e., how 'clocklike' non-coding substitutions have been within that
clade). If populational processes occurring during speciation directly cause the increases in average substitution
rates observable across a phylogeny (Hypothesis 2 in
Table 1, [6]), then substitution rate heterogeneity should
also be observable across a phylogeny, with shorter
branches (that have been in the process of speciation for a
greater proportion of their span) exhibiting higher substitution rates than longer branches. However, previous
studies have not tested for this. With sister-group comparisons, it is also difficult to rule out a confounding statistical artifact that affects the relationship between
diversification and substitution rates, known as the node
density effect (NDE, hypothesis 4 in Table 1). In sistergroup comparisons, the response variable (species richness) is often correlated with the confounding variable
(node density). Hugall and Lee [12] discuss methods to
correct for this, and find that only by extensive resampling of the sister clades can one detect and account for
NDE using sister group comparisons.
Instead of performing sister group comparisons, I constructed molecular-clock dated phylogenies for 13 angiosperm clades using internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Based on the generated phylogenies, I estimated speciation and extinction
rates, the mean rate of nucleotide substitution, and the
coefficient of variation in nucleotide substitution within
each clade. These parameters were then compared across
clades using phylogenetically independent contrasts

Page 3 of 10

(PIC's). By choosing 13 diverse angiosperm genera as
independent clades for units of comparison rather than
sister groups, I was able to determine if the correlation
between diversification and substitution rates is robust
and generalizable across a range of plants. With sistergroups, each clade can only directly be compared with its
sibling. However, regression analysis of multiple, independent clades allows estimation of the general form of
the relationship across angiosperms, which can be used
to make general predictions.
I selected clades for comparison that exhibit similar life
histories and environments, where ecological similarities
across compared clades are not due to common ancestry
(which could confound analyses). Although it is impossible to completely control for ecological differences, such
an approach can reduce their magnitude of effect and
allow me to determine if, after minimizing major differences in habit, geography, and life history, a relationship
remains between substitution rates and speciation. If
such a correlation exists, then I can tentatively rule out
extrinsic, ecological explanations for variation in evolutionary rates (hypothesis 1 in Table 1) for the purposes of
this study (i.e., reduce the magnitude of extrinsic effects
on evolutionary rates from further analyses of intrinsic
causes). If no relationship between speciation and substitution rates is detected after controlling for habitat and
life history, I can reject an intrinsic, causal explanation
(hypotheses 2 and 3).
Within each of the 13 clades under consideration, I calculated speciation and extinction using a birth-death
diversification model, which calculates rates of speciation
and extinction as independent parameters and allows for
incomplete sampling of clades [13,14]. This method maximizes the likelihood of obtaining the observed tree,
given particular values for speciation (λ) and extinction
(μ) rates. Because μdepends on λ(i.e., extinction cannot
occur without prior speciation), I calculated the relative
extinction rate (ε = λ/μ) for use in further analyses. If substitution rates are positively correlated with speciation
and uncorrelated with extinction, hypotheses 2 or 3a
(Table 1) would be supported. If, instead, substitution
rates are negatively correlated with extinction and uncorrelated with speciation, this would rule out both hypotheses 2 and 3 and would require a new, alternative
hypothesis. If substitution rates correlate positively with
both speciation and extinction, this would rule out
hypothesis 2 and most strongly support hypothesis 3b.
Maximum likelihood birth-death estimates of speciation
and extinction rates, unlike other diversification measures, are not directly derived from the numbers of nodes
over time, and should therefore be immune to NDE.
These estimates can be compared to the effects of node
density on substitution rates, thus directly controlling for
hypothesis 4.

Using substitution rates derived from calibrated molecular clocks rather than from sister groups, I was also able
to determine if the among-branch variation in the mean
ITS substitution rate for each clade is correlated with
increased speciation. If so, this would support hypothesis
2, suggesting that populational processes associated with
speciation events cause accelerated bursts of molecular
evolution and therefore increase the average rate of ITS
substitution on short branches relative to the average rate
for longer branches. If the regularity, or clock-like behavior, of ITS evolution is unaffected by the rate of speciation, this result would be more consistent with hypothesis
3.

Results
Values for λ, ε, and ITS substitution rates for each clade
are listed in Table 2. Across clades, mean ITS substitution
rate (the independent variable) was positively correlated
with log(λ): Least squares regression of contrasts
(through origin), r2 = 0.298, slope = 105.02, F1,11 = 4.66, P
= 0.05. Using branch lengths of 1, which corresponds to a
punctuational (rather than gradual) model of trait evolution [15], least squares regression of contrasts (through
origin), r2 = 0.476, slope = 136.224, F1,11 = 9.975, P = 0.01.
For the non-phylogenetic correlation (non-PIC), r2 = 0.32,
slope = 91.18, F1,11 = 5.16, P = 0.04 (Figure 1a). This positive relationship suggests that the correlation between
diversification and rates of molecular evolution is due to a
process of enhanced speciation rates in faster-evolving
lineages, rather than decreased extinction. In further support of this conclusion, the mean ITS substitution rate
was also marginally positively correlated with transformed values of relative extinction, ε2: Least squares
regression of contrasts (through origin), r2 = 0.191, slope
= 58.30, F1,11 = 2.60, P = 0.13. For the PIC correlation
assuming punctuated rate changes, r2 = 0.276, slope =
64.28, F1,11 = 4.20, P = 0.06. For the non-PIC correlation,
r2 = 0.21, slope = 55.81, F1,11 = 2.95, P = 0.11 (Figure 1b).
This marginally positive correlation suggests that faster
substitution rates also promote or are otherwise associated with the process of extinction. A positive correlation
between ITS rate and ε is inconsistent with hypothesis 2,
and consistent with hypothesis 3.
Variation among branches of the same tree in ITS
sequence evolution (coefficient of variation in mean rate)
was not correlated with log(λ) (PIC: P = 0.23, non-PIC: P
= 0.43, Figure 1c) nor with ε2 (PIC: P = 0.62, non-PIC: P =
0.83, Figure 1d), suggesting that neither increased speciation nor extinction events introduced increased deviations from the background pace of non-coding molecular
evolution. This result (of no relationship between speciation rate and a punctuated nature of nucleotide evolution), in addition to the suggested positive relationship

between substitution rates and extinction, refutes
hypothesis 2.
In contrast to the positive relationship between ITS
substitution rates and log(λ), substitution rates were
uncorrelated with node density (non-PIC: P = 0.39). This
lack of correlation confirms that the positive relationship
between maximum likelihood speciation and extinction
parameters and substitution rates calculated by BEAST
are not artifacts of NDE, ruling out hypothesis 4. Furthermore, the number of sequences used in constructing each
tree did not affect the mean substitution rate (P = 0.74) or
the c.v. in substitution rate (P = 0.92), ruling out the possibility that the positive relationship between log(λ) and
mean ITS rate was spuriously generated by sampling
more sequences in some clades, which could increase the
chances of sampling a lineage with a high substitution
rate by chance. Finally, clade age was uncorrelated with
mean substitution rate (P = 0.42), indicating that the significant correlations reported here were not spuriously
caused by calibration date uncertainty.

Discussion
My choice of clades was designed to minimize effects of
the most-commonly reported potential ecological drivers
of this relationship, habit and biogeographical range.
After partially controlling for these predominating ecological drivers of diversification and mutation rate, a relationship exists between ITS substitution rates and both
speciation and, marginally, extinction. These results suggest that a direct, potentially causal, intrinsic relationship
exists between the average rate of molecular evolution
within a clade, and the rate of both speciation and extinction within that clade.
The hypothesis best supported by these results is 3b,
indicating that clades with higher rates molecular evolution at non-coding loci (such as ITS) likely also experience higher rates of molecular evolution at coding loci
(see also [5]). An increase in mutational genetic variation
causes increases in phenotypic variation that can facilitate both speciation (via increased adaptive potential in
new niches or marginal environments) and extinction
(via increased mutational load [16,17]). These results do
not rule out hypothesis 3a, however. Although hypothesis
3a does not explain the marginally significant relationship
between substitution and extinction rates (which best
supports hypothesis 3b), it is also possible that a fast rate
of molecular evolution increases the rate at which genetic
incompatibilities accumulate between populations. Further studies incorporating information on mating system
and the hybridization abilities within these clades are
needed to determine if this is the case.
These results provide evidence to falsify hypothesis 2,
suggesting that rates of molecular evolution may not provide a 'signature' of past speciation events [9]. Therefore,

Estimates for speciation rate (λ), extinction rate (μ), relative extinction rate ( ), mean rate of nucleotide substitution at the ITS1 and ITS2 loci (mean
rate = number of substitutions per site/age in millions of years. It is calculated for each branch, then summed over all branches), and the
coefficient of variation (c.v.) in mean substitution rate (c.v. rate = among-branch variance in ITS rate, scaled by the mean. I.e., for a tree with a c.v.
of 0.50, the rate of ITS evolution varies across lineages by 50% of the mean). Confidence intervals (C.I.) for diversification rates were calculated
from their likelihood profiles. 95% HPD (Highest Posterior Density) intervals for ITS rates are from BEAST (Tracer) analysis of MCMC output.

analysis of rate heterogeneity may not allow us to distinguish historical processes of speciation (i.e., vicariant vs.
peripatric speciation). When testing specifically for a
relationship between speciation rates and the coefficient
of variation for substitution rates (high variation indicates
punctuated changes in substitution rates), the relationship was found to be absent in this data set. This indicates
that while substitution rates might briefly increase during
speciation events, these interludes cannot be detected in
the phylogeny using current methods; overall higher rates
of substitution observed across the tree for speciose
clades are not caused by punctuated increases at speciation. These results suggest that the result of faster evolution in more speciose clades is not sufficient evidence to
support the punctuated evolution model of speciation (as
claimed by [1,6]).
Because these results suggest that the rate of nucleotide
substitution is a cause rather than an effect of speciation,
this leaves the causes of variation in rates of substitution
to be explained. Substitution rates are in part determined
by the efficiency of DNA replication and repair mechanisms [18]. Potential explanations for the differences in
substitution rates among clades are that substitution rates
are phylogenetically conserved, or that they are correlated with genome size (larger genomes may contain
more 'junk DNA' and thus experience either relatively
lower genome-wide selection against increased mutation
rates or higher time and energy costs of more accurate

replication). However, using this data set, I did not detect
a phylogenetic signal for substitution rate (see also [7]) or
any correlation of substitution rate with average genome
size within each clade (Lancaster, unpublished data).
Finally, finer distinctions between the ecologies of these
clades than what I was able to control for here likely also
affect the reported relationships. In future work with
these clades, I will examine fine-scale ecological effects
on diversification.

Conclusions
Plant species from clades characterized by high nucleotide substitution rates tend to both speciate and go
extinct at higher rates than species from more slowlyevolving clades. High substitution rates are due to large
mutational genetic variance experienced at the population level, which increases both adaptive potential within
populations and reproductive isolation between populations, which can facilitate the process of speciation. However, elevated mutational genetic variation also leads to
extinction, likely via the genetic load it imposes. The
causes of substitution rate variation across clades with
similar ecologies are not well known.
One important question generated by these results is
whether substitution rates can be applied to predict these
and other clades' responses to environmental change. The
ability of a population to adapt to a rapidly changing environment is directly proportional to its mutation rate [19],

Lancaster BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:162
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/162

which provides the necessary phenotypic variation to
allow populations to respond to novel selection pressures.
The results reported here suggest that high mutation
rates also allow clades to speciate more rapidly, diversifying into new niches (potentially as new niches arise).
Clades exhibiting fast substitution rates may therefore be
more likely survive rapidly changing or novel environments, in spite of the fact that they otherwise have
increased chances of extinction because of their relatively
higher levels of mutational genetic load.

Methods
Clade selection

For phylogenetic analyses, I selected thirteen temperate
angiosperm genera or tribes that each contained enough
species (a large enough within-clade sample size) to accurately calculate diversification rates, with mean ITS-sampled clade size = 117.08, minimum = 47, maximum = 304.
I selected clades that were relatively completely sampled
for ITS sequence data, and for which fossil or vicariance
data, or previously published ITS rate data, was available
to calibrate molecular clocks. For the 11 out of 13 clades
in which fossil or vicariance dates were used to calibrate
trees, 2-3 dating events per tree were used to increase
accuracy (Table 3). For the remaining 2 clades without
known fossils, well-established calibration points from

the literature were available, based on previous molecular
clock analyses of more inclusive clades (references in
Table 3). Although variation in the quality of information
available to calibrate trees likely varies from clade to
clade, this potential source of noise in the data is not
expected to introduce systematic bias [7]. To attempt to
control for life history, I chose clades exhibiting similar
growth habits, because growth habit is strongly correlated with generation time and reproductive strategy, and
is commonly used as a proxy for life history in phylogenetic studies [7,20]. The 13 clades that I chose each consisted predominantly of a mixture of perennial herbs and
low shrubs [plant height may affect substitution rate,
[21]]. Clades containing shrubs tend to fossilize well compared to herbaceous clades, and clades containing herbs
provide larger clade sizes, with increased power to estimate diversification rates, than do genera or tribes composed entirely of woody species. The 13 clades varied in
their proportions of woody vs. herbaceous members,
however, which could affect the results. To control for
geography, I selected clades that had diversified within
and occupy overlapping ranges in temperate North
America, and that have a predominantly temperate distribution in the remainder of their ranges. Of course I could
not find sufficient numbers of replicate clades with completely overlapping ranges, so geographical variation
could also affect these results. Latitude and tropical vs.
temperate ranges are the most commonly reported habitat variables affecting diversification and rates of substitution [4,22]. Although both of these variables are
imperfectly matched across clades, I worked to minimize
their influence without compromising my criteria of random clade selection, extensive ITS sampling, and reliable
calibration dates. The thirteen clades finally selected as
fulfilling all of these criteria are as follows: The tribe Antirrhineae (Plantaginaceae), Artemisia (Asteraceae), the
tribe Chironiinae (Gentianaceae), Ericameria (Asteraceae), Lepidium (Brassicaceae), Lotus (Fabaceae), Lupinus (Fabaceae), the tribe Lycieae (Solanaceae), the
subfamily Phrymoideae (Phrymaceae), the family
Polemoniaceae, Salvia (Lamiaceae), the subfamily Saniculoideae (Apiaceae), and Sidalcea plus Calyculogygas,
Eremalche, Iliamna, Malvastrum, Modiola, Modiolastrum, and Monteiroa [monophyly of these genera from
[23]]; Malvaceae). I also selected an appropriate outgroup
for each clade, which was not included in diversification
analyses.

obtained in the laboratory, and provide high phylogenetic
resolution at the species level [24]. Therefore, ITS
sequences are available for many species, facilitating
large-scale comparisons such as in this study. I aligned
the ITS sequences within each clade in MUSCLE v3.7
[25], using default parameters. Poorly-aligning regions
and coding regions of 18s, 5.8s, or 26s nrDNA were
assessed by eye in Mesquite v2.6 and 2.7 [26] and were
clipped from the final alignments. For each clade, I
imported aligned sequences into PAUP* v4.0 [27] in order
to run MrModelTest v2.3 [28], to determine the appropriate model of nucleotide substitution according the hLRT
criteria. Selected substitution models for each clade are
presented in Table 3.
I constructed time-calibrated phylogenies using a
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method
implemented in BEAST v4.8 and 5.0 [29] using a lognormally distributed relaxed molecular clock model [30] and
a birth-death tree prior. I initially evaluated phylogenies
with an MCMC chain length of 10,000,000 states, but
increased chain length to as high as 50,000,000 for clades
with low ESS (effective sample sizes) of resulting tree

parameters. Priors for dating events used to calibrate
each molecular clock are reported in Table 3. Multiple
BEAST runs were compared and combined to generate a
final tree for each clade, after removing a burn-in of 10%
of the chain length for each BEAST run. The resulting
mean rate parameter (which is the average of the individual substitution rates along each branch, weighted by
branch length, to provide a measure of the overall substitution rate per site per million years) and the coefficient
of variation in the mean rate parameter (a measure of
how clock-like ITS evolution has been) are listed for each
clade, with further explanation, in Table 2.
Diversification rate analysis and independent contrast
analysis of tree parameters

Lambda (λ, speciation rate) and mu (μ, extinction rate)
were calculated for each of the calibrated trees in the
DiversiTree v.0.4-1 module [13] of R v.2.9.2 http://
www.R-project.org, using a standard birth-death diversification model [14]. Because my selected clades were
incompletely sampled, I applied the correction built into
the DiversiTree module to account for the effect of sam-

Lancaster BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:162
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/162

pling frequency on estimated rates. Confidence intervals
for these rates were derived from the likelihood profile.
Because λand μare positively correlated (extinction rates
depend on prior speciation events), I calculated the relative extinction rates (ε) as λ/μfor further analysis of the
relationship between substitution and extinction rates.
The 13 values of λand ε that I obtained (Table 2) were not
normally distributed, and I therefore log-transformed
λand squared the values of ε to achieve normality.
I evaluated relationships between diversification measures (log(λ) and ε2) and substitution rates both directly
in Jump v7.0 (SAS institute, ©2007) and using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC's) implemented in the
PDAP package of Mesquite [15,31]. PIC's transform character states at tips to incorporate information about
branching. This method corrects for any potential
sources of pseudoreplication due to shared ancestry of
related clades, allowing clades to be treated as statistically
independent subjects. To calculate PIC's, I used a phylogeny including all thirteen clades (i.e., each of my 13
selected clades resides at a tip) retrieved from Phylomatic's maximally resolved seed plant tree [32], with
branch lengths proportional to time (divergence dates
from [33]). The PDAP diagnostic chart was used to determine that these branch lengths were acceptable. Using
this tree for branching information between my selected
clades, I evaluated the correlation among clades between
mean substitution rate and the diversification rates log(λ)
and ε2. I also evaluated the correlation between the coefficient of variation in substitution rate and log(λ) and ε2, to
test whether bursts in substitution rates accompanying
speciation were evidenced by less clock-like ITS evolution in more speciose clades (hypothesis 2). To test if the
substitution rate calculated in BEAST depends on node
density (which could cause spurious results), I verified
that mean substitution rate was uncorrelated with node
density (number of nodes/clade age). I also verified that
mean ITS rate was uncorrelated with clade age. This was
done because uncertainty in dating phylogenies could
lead to over- or under-estimation of some clade ages,
generating spurious correlations between evolutionary
rates. A correlation between clade age and substitution
rate would indicate spurious rate correlations caused by
calibration errors.
