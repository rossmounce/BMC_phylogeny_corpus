Abstract
Background: The Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are important components of the healthy gut flora
and have been used extensively as probiotics. Understanding the cultivable diversity of LAB before
and after probiotic administration, and being able to track the fate of administered probiotic
isolates during feeding are important parameters to consider in the design of clinical trials to assess
probiotic efficacy. Several methods may be used to identify bacteria at the strain level, however,
PCR-based methods such as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) are particularly suited
to rapid analysis. We examined the cultivable diversity of LAB in the human gut before and after
feeding with two Lactobacillus strains, and also tracked the fate of these two administered strains
using a RAPD technique.
Results: A RAPD typing scheme was developed to genetically type LAB isolates from a wide range
of species, and optimised for direct application to bacterial colony growth. A high-throughput
strategy for fingerprinting the cultivable diversity of human faeces was developed and used to
determine: (i) the initial cultivable LAB strain diversity in the human gut, and (ii) the fate of two
Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus salivarius NCIMB 30211 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 30156)
contained within a capsule that was administered in a small-scale human feeding study. The L.
salivarius strain was not cultivated from the faeces of any of the 12 volunteers prior to capsule
administration, but appeared post-feeding in four. Strains matching the L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156
feeding strain were found in the faeces of three volunteers prior to consumption; after taking the
Lactobacillus capsule, 10 of the 12 volunteers were culture positive for this strain. The appearance
of both Lactobacillus strains during capsule consumption was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: We have shown that genetic strain typing of the cultivable human gut microbiota can
be evaluated using a high throughput RAPD technique based on single bacterial colonies. Validation
of this strategy paves the way for future systematic studies on the fate and efficacy of bacterial
probiotics during human clinical trials.

Background
The application of bacterial probiotics or nutritional supplements containing these microorganisms represents
one of the fastest growing areas in both industrial/clinical
microbiology. Probiotics have been defined by the World
Health Organisation live microorganisms which when
administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits
on the host [1,2]. The Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB; including
the genera Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Streptococcus)
comprise the most commonly used probiotics and have
been shown to have therapeutic or prophylactic potential
for a number of human and animal dietary conditions or
diseases [1,3,4]. The natural diversity of LAB in the human
gut has been studied by cultivation dependent methods
and conventional phenotypic identification of constituent species. More recently, powerful cultivation-independent methods such as microbial metagenomics have
begun to shed light on the total microbial diversity of
human gut [5]. Although metagenomic studies allow
detailed analysis of what species of bacteria are present,
currently they provide only limited information on the
level of strain diversity that may occur for any given LAB
species.
Characterisation of the strain diversity of LAB species has
only really begun in the last decade. Yeung et al[6] successfully used macrorestriction and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) to examine the genotypic diversity of
probiotic lactobacilli and showed that several commercial
probiotic formulations contained the same bacterial
strain. Vancanneyt et al. [7] used a combination of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and PFGE to
specifically examine Lactobacillus rhamnosus species probiotics and also demonstrated the presence of multiple
indistinguishable strain types present in a variety of probiotic products. PCR-fingerprinting methods analysis have
also been used to examine the strain diversity of Lactobacillus probiotics. For example, Schillinger et al. [8] used
Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis to
differentiate Lactobacillus strains cultivated from probiotic
yogurts. Pena et al[9] used Repetitive Element PCR (REP)
profiling to examine the genetic diversity of intestinal
Lactobacillus species colonising different transgenic
mouse-lines; they demonstrated that mice with colitis due
to IL-10 deficiency were colonised with a different population of strains in comparison to those without colitis.
Multilocus sequence typing, a very powerful nucleotide
sequence based strain differentiation methods has also
been recently developed for Lactobacillus plantarum [10]
and Lactobacillus casei [11]. However, genetic typing methods that work at the strain level have seen limited use in
their direct application to the human gut microbiota and
have not yet been applied to specifically track the fate of a
specific probiotic strain during consumption.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/251

Understanding the dynamics of gut colonisation by bacterial probiotics is an important parameter for the future
clinical development of these therapeutic agents. We set
out to determine if individual Lactobacillus species strains
could be tracked after human consumption of the encapsulated bacteria. RAPD was selected as a suitable strain
typing method to answer this question because: (i) as a
PCR-based method it was amenable to high throughput,
and, (ii) we knew from past-experience that if the RAPD
method was systematically developed to target specific
bacterial species, then its discriminatory power can be
comparable to state-of-the-art DNA sequence-based genotyping methods such as multilocus sequence typing [12].
Here we describe the systematic development of a RAPD
fingerprinting method for a broad range of LAB species
and its optimization to allow direct application to single
bacterial colonies. Using this novel high throughput colony strain typing strategy we were then able for the first
time to track the fate of specific Lactobacillus strains after
their consumption by human volunteers.

Results
Development of a RAPD fingerprinting method for Lactic
Acid Bacteria
To systematically develop a RAPD typing scheme for LAB
species, a set of 100 RAPD primers which had proven successful for strain typing other bacterial species [13,14]
were screened for their ability to amplify multiple polymorphisms from L. acidophilus. Fifteen primers (Table 1)
were found to reproducibly amplify 8 or more random
DNA fragments from the reference strain L. acidophilus
LMG 9433T that ranged in size from 200 to 4000 bp (Fig.
1). The complexity of these profiles indicated that discriminatory typing of LAB isolates with these primers was
possible.

The primers with the most diverse polymorphisms, 272,
277 and 287 (Table 1; Fig. 1) were selected for genotyping
isolates of further LAB species beyond L. acidophilus. Primary typing was performed with primer 272 because of its
known discriminatory power [13,14], and secondary confirmation of strain type was performed with primers 277
and 287.
LAB isolates examined
A collection of 38 LAB isolates was assembled to assess the
discriminatory power of the RAPD fingerprinting method
(Table 2). The collection comprised reference isolates and
Type strains of known LAB species obtained from recognised culture collections (14 isolates, 9 species; Table 2).
In addition, commercially marketed probiotic products
were purchased and their constituent LAB isolates cultured and purified (24 isolates, 11 species; Table 2). Previous studies have shown that the speciation and labelling
of commercially marketed probiotics may often be inac-

curate [15,16]. Therefore prior to examining the ability of
RAPD to differentiate LAB isolates, sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was used to systematically identify the species of all LAB isolates cultured from
commercial samples (Fig. 2; Table 2). To test the accuracy
of this speciation strategy, control sequences from L. brevis
LMG 6906T and L. johnsonii LMG 9436Twere obtained and
found to cluster appropriately with the published
sequences from these Type strains (data not shown). The
majority of the cultivable bacteria contained within the
commercial probiotic products were found to belong to
the L. casei group (L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus; 9
isolates) and L. acidophilus group (L. acidophilus, L. gallinarum and L. suntoryeus species; 6 isolates) (Fig. 2; Table
2). Other LAB species identified included (Table 2): L. gasseri (3 isolates), L. jensenii (2 isolates), Enterococcus faecalis
(2 isolates), and L. salivarius, L. plantarum, and Pediococcus
pentosaceus (single isolates, respectively).
Testing the discriminatory power of the RAPD method on
other LAB species
The broad collection of systematically identified LAB isolates (Table 2) were used to test the efficacy of the RAPD
typing scheme. The reproducibility of the RAPD method
was excellent, with all 14 reference strains demonstrating

identical fingerprint profiles after duplicate analysis. In
addition L. acidophilus LMG 9433T was analysed by RAPD
at multiple points throughout the study as an internal
control; the same fingerprint profile was obtained on each
occasion demonstrating that the LAB PCR genotyping
scheme demonstrated the same high reproducibility as
had been observed with previous RAPD studies on other
bacterial species [13,14].
RAPD fingerprinting was able to cluster genetically identical strains as well as differentiate distinct strains within
closely related LAB species. For example, multiple isolates
of L. acidophilus were found to possess identical RAPD fingerprints (using primer 272) to the type strain for the species, LMG 9433T (Fig. 3, panel A). These included 4
additional reference isolates that had originally been
recovered from diverse sources such as from rat and
human faeces, as well as 4 isolates used in the commercial
probiotic products (Table 2). All L. acidophilus isolates
were genotypically indistinguishable even when examined with additional RAPD primers 277 and 287. These
data suggested there was little genetic heterogeneity
among isolates of L. acidophilus examined in this study. In
addition they show that isolates genotypically identical to
the L. acidophilus Type strain have been widely adopted for

commercial use (Fig. 3, panel A; Table 2). Of the remaining 8 LAB reference isolates examined, 8 distinct RAPD
strain types were found that corresponded to each LAB
species (Table 2).
RAPD fingerprinting was also able to differentiate genetically unique strain types within very closely related species
such as those within the L. casei group (Fig. 2); these
included L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus (Fig. 3,
panel B). From this closely related complex of species (Fig.
2), a total of 9 distinct RAPD types (10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18,
20, 21, and 27; Table 2) were identified. Two commercially marketed probiotics were found to contain the same
strain of L. rhamnosus (isolates FMD T2 and MW, RAPD
type 10; Table 2). Another commercial probiotic formulation contained an L. casei strain, designated BF T1, that
was identical by RAPD to the L. casei Type strain LMG
6904T (Table 2). Overall, the RAPD fingerprinting method
was highly effective, working on all 38 LAB isolates examined irrespective of their species and reproducibly defining 26 RAPD types within this diverse collection (Table 2).
Application of RAPD fingerprinting to single colonies
To facilitate high throughput typing that could be applied
to screening LAB isolates cultivated directly from human
faeces, we evaluated if the PCR-fingerprinting method
could be adapted for use on single bacteria colonies. Single colonies were picked with a sterile plastic tip and rapid

boiling/cooling in a Chelex® resin extraction buffer used
to obtain DNA for PCR (see Methods). The RAPD fingerprints obtained from colonies processed in this way were
identical to those produced from conventionally extracted
high molecular weight DNA (Fig. 4). However, it was
found that consistent profiles were only obtained if the
RAPD PCR was set up immediately after the boiling and
chilling cycles of the colony extraction procedure. The
amplified PCR fingerprints deteriorated after subsequent
frozen storage of the Chelex® resin extracted DNA. To
overcome this potential problem, we examined if prolonged frozen storage (-20°C) of the resuspended colony
in Chelex® resin prior to full extraction by boiling was possible. This procedure did not affect the quality of the
RAPD profiles (Fig. 4). The ability to fingerprint from frozen stored colony material provided a high throughput
strategy that could be used to systematically screen the
multiple colony types isolated from human faeces as part
of a Lactobacillus strain feeding study (see below).
Lactobacillus species feeding study design
A small scale proof-of-principle human feeding study was
performed to evaluate if the colony-fingerprint strategy
could be used to track specific LAB strains from ingestion
as capsule recovery from faeces. A capsule for oral administration was formulated to commercial standards which
contained two Lactobacillus species isolates: L. salivarius
strain NCIMB 30211 (1.8 × 1010 colony forming units
[cfu] per capsule) and L. acidophilus strain NCIMB 30156
(5.6 × 109 mean cfu per capsule). Twelve volunteers participated in a feeding study where the capsule was taken
daily for 14 days; faecal samples were provided on days
before, during and after consumption as described in the
Methods. The volunteers were not advised to change their
diets in any way other than to take the capsule once a day
with some food on each of the trial days. At each faecal
sampling point, LAB were plated as described below, enumerated and multiple colonies genotyped by RAPD.
Cultivation of LAB species from human faeces
Although MRS agar is a well established cultivation
medium for semi-selective culture of LAB species [17], we
found that several non-LAB species, in particular Gram
negative enteric bacteria were frequently encountered as
contaminants after plating of human faeces (data not
shown). To assist with selection of the Lactobacillus species
in the feeding study, we investigated whether the addition
of polymyxin B to MRS medium (MRS-P agar, see Methods) would increase the selectivity of this medium by acting as a counter-selection against coliforms. Addition of
polymyxin B at a concentration of 120 units per ml of agar
did not inhibit the viability of any of reference LAB species
isolates (Table 2) or the two Lactobacillus strains incorporated into the capsule. However, MRS-P was highly effective at reducing the number of contaminating Gram

negative enteric colonies seen after plating of human faeces.
To examine the efficacy of the semi-selective MRS-P developed for enrichment of the LAB species within faeces, 29
of the most dominant cultivable isolates recovered from
10 of the volunteers at days -14, 0 and 28 (before and after
Lactobacillus feeding) were randomly selected for molecular identification. Using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
these dominant isolates were identified as (Table 2; Fig 2):
Lactobacillus species (10 isolates), Streptococcus species (7
isolates), Enterococcus species (7 isolates), Weissella species
(1 isolate) and Staphylococcus species (4 isolates). The latter Staphylococcus isolates were the only non-LAB species
isolated in high numbers on MRS-P agar after faecal plating. These data indicated that the MRS-P agar was effective
for selection of LAB species after faecal culture.
Tracking Lactobacillus strains after oral administration
RAPD fingerprinting of the major colony morphotypes
appearing after cultivation of each faecal sample was used
to determine if the Lactobacillus strains had survived gastric and intestinal passage (Fig. 5). The mean faecal LAB
count was 8.8 ± 2.7 × 106 cfu per g faeces when all volunteer samples were analysed; consumption of the lactobacilli did not significantly alter the total faecal LAB counts
obtained from any of the volunteers (data not shown).

cultivated from three of the volunteers at the pre-feeding
stage (Table 3). The appearance of this L. acidophilus
(RAPD strain type 1; Table 2) at this point in the study was
not unreasonable since it appeared to be a strain commonly found in food/probiotic products which may have
been consumed by the volunteers (Table 2).
After consumption of the capsule, the L. salivarius NCIMB
30211 strain was detected on day 2 in three volunteers (B,
G and S), on day 7 in two volunteers (F, see Fig. 5; S), with
only volunteer S remaining faeces positive for this strain
on days 21 and 28 (7 and 14 days, respectively, after feeding stopped; Table 3). Increased detection of the L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156 strain was also seen with 10 of the
volunteers culture positive for this strain at one or more
sample points during the feeding period (volunteers A-C,
F, G, J, N, P, R and S), and 3 of these (A, N, and S)
remained positive on days 21 and 28 (Table 3). L. salivarius NCIMB 30211 was never the dominant cultivable LAB

Detection
Detection of L. salivarius and L. acidophilus strains after feeding. The colony growth after plating of the day 7 faecal
sample from volunteer F are show for the neat and third serial dilutions on MRS-P agar (panels A and B, respectively). Colonies
picked for PCR fingerprinting are shown by the numbered arrows. The subsequent RAPD typing analysis is shown in panel C
with the lane numbers corresponding to the colony numbers. Other lanes for panel C are as follows: M, molecular size markers (size in bp indicated); 1, L. salivarius NCIMB 30211 control and 2, L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156 control.

strain and was detected at 102 to 104 per g faeces (Fig. 5).
In contrast, L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156 was the most
dominant colony morphotype in volunteers A (day 7 and
28), B (day 2), F (day 7; see Fig. 5) and N (day 2, 21 and
28; Table 3), where it represented 38% or greater of the
total LAB count. The mean LAB count for these volunteers
at these time points was 1.8 ± 7.6 × 107 per g faeces indicating that L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156 must have been
present at a level of at least 107 per g of faeces.
Statistical evaluation of Lactobacillus feeding in terms of
gut colonisation was carried out assuming a null hypothesis that: "Consumption will lead to the subsequent detection by cultivation of the constituent strains within the
capsule in the faeces of each subject." Chi Squared analysis demonstrated that the distribution of L. salivarius
NCIMB 30211 was significant, with none of the volunteers being positive prior to feeding, and 4 being culture
positive (B, F, G and S; Table 3) at least once during the
feeding period of the trial (Chi square = 4.8; p < 0.05). The
distribution of L. acidophilus strain NCIMB 30156 was also
significant (3 positive prior to feeding and 10 culture positive during feeding, Table 3; Chi square = 8.2, p < 0.01),
suggesting that consumption of the organism had led to a
significant increase in gut carriage of this L. acidophilus
strain. However, limited persistence of the strains was
observed in the culture positive volunteers after feeding
ceased. For L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156, 10 volunteers
were culture positive at least once during the feeding

period, this fell to 3 who were still positive on day 21 and
28 (Table 3). With L. salivarius NCIMB 30211 only volunteer S retained the strain in faeces at day 21 and 28 after
consumption had ceased (Table 3).
Specific LAB strains persist in individual humans
Although the persistence of the administered Lactobacillus
strains was not substantial after feeding had stopped,
other faecal LAB strains were recurrently cultivated at two
or more time points from all 12 volunteers (Table 3). The
RAPD fingerprinting strategy was able to detect the persistence of these strains within the faeces for greater than
28 days in several of the volunteers (Fig. 6). Reproducible
fingerprints were obtained for Lactobacillus species, Streptococcus species, Enterococcus species, and Weissella species
isolates that all persisted in this way (Table 2 and 3; Fig. 2
and 6). Several strains were also the dominant cultivable
isolates recovered from the faeces of certain volunteers,
suggesting that they were colonising that individual's gut.
For example, the Enterococcus sanguinicola strain (RAPD
type 39, representative isolate G-02-a, Table 2; Fig. 2)
recovered from volunteer G was first isolated at 14 days
prior to commencing the feeding study and the same
strain was also cultivated from their faeces at each subsequent sampling point until day 21 (see Fig. 6 for day 0 and
day 21 RAPD fingerprints). At the -14 day sampling point
this enterococcal strain was estimated to represent 1% of
the cultivable diversity (1.8 × 104 cfu per g faeces), however, within day 0 and day 6 samples it represented 99%

Recurrent LAB strains carried by the human volunteers
Recurrent LAB strains carried by the human volunteers. Several different strains of LAB were cultivated at several sampling points during the Lactobacillus feeding trial.
RAPD fingerprints of these persistent strains are shown for
the following in each lane: 1, L. rhamnosus A+7-5a; 2, A+283b*; 3, E. sanguinicola G0-2a*; 4, G0-2b; 5, G+21-1a; 6, E. faecalis Q0-1a; 7, Q0-1b; 8, Q+28-1a, 9, Q+28-1b; 10, L. rhamnosus T0-2a; 11, T+23-1a; 12, T+28-1b (systematic

of the observed growth (approximately 1.75 × 105 cfu per
g faeces); at day 21 it still represented 88% of the cultivable diversity, however, on day 28 it was not detected.
All the volunteers were colonised with persistent LAB
strains (specific to each individual) that represented
greater than 1% of their viable faecal growth; at least one
of these strains was identified to the species level for each
volunteer except J (Table 3). Apart from sharing of the L.
salivarius NCIMB 30211 and L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156
strains present within the administered feeding capsule,
only one other strain was detected in two volunteers, the
L. rhamnosus RAPD type 41 strain (Table 2). This L. rhamnosus strain was shared by individuals P and T (Table 2
and Table 3). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability
of the fingerprinting strategy to detect and track the population biology of cultivable faecal strains representative of
a broad range of LAB species.

Discussion
We successfully developed a rapid, colony-based strain
typing strategy that was able to track two Lactobacillus
strains from feeding via a capsule through to faecal discharge in human volunteers. The RAPD typing system was
capable of genotyping a wide variety of LAB species and its

efficacy on single colonies provided a means to rapidly
discriminate LAB isolates cultivated from human faeces.
Evidence for survival and growth of the L. salivarius strain
was most convincing as it was not detected in any of volunteers prior to the feeding study (Table 3). In contrast,
the L. acidophilus strain used in the capsule represented a
very common genotype used in commercial applications
(Table 2). Hence the appearance of L. acidophilus isolates
which matched the feeding strain NCIMB 30156 may
have been less attributable to consumption of the capsule.
However, statistical analysis demonstrated that the distribution of L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156 after the feeding
trial was significant in terms of the number of positive volunteers and in the majority of these positive individuals it
was the dominant cultivable LAB strain in faeces.
As far as we are aware, previous studies evaluating the
dynamics of LAB consumption by humans have not
examined the cultivable faecal diversity at the strain level.
Several studies have used cultivation-independent methods such as real-time PCR to quantify the DNA from probiotic strains present in faeces by extrapolating this
amplification data to estimate of the numbers of bacteria.
Bartosch et al. [18] used real-time PCR to estimate the
total numbers of Bifidobacterium species present in the faeces of elderly people taking a probiotic containing two
Bifidobacterium strains and an inulin-based prebiotic. They
demonstrated that probiotic consumption increased the
overall size of Bifidobacterium population in their subjects
as estimated by increase yields in the species-specific PCR
and also used cultivation-based approaches to show that
more LAB species were present in the probiotic consuming subjects.
Maruo et al. [19] used RAPD to identify a strain-specific
marker for the probiotic strain Lactobacillus lactis subsp.
cremoris FC, and used real-time PCR to detect the strain's
DNA within the faeces of human subjects taking the probiotic. They were able to show that the strain's DNA persisted during probiotic administration suggesting that
between 105 and 109 bacterial cells were present per g of
faeces. However, no cultivation and detection of the L. lactis subsp. cremoris strain FC was performed on the faecal
samples [19] to indicate that the strain remained viable
and actively colonised the gut during probiotic administration. Real-time PCR is a highly sensitive method, however, its dependence on detecting DNA and the fact that
minute traces of DNA may take longer than cells to be
completely cleared from the digestive tract, means that the
method can be misleading in terms of providing functional information on the viability and persistence of an
administered probiotic.
We have also shown that many commercial marketed probiotic products contain the same LAB strain (Table 2).
Our RAPD typing was able to cluster genetically identical

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:251

strains such as the multiple isolates matching the L. acidophilus Type strain (LMG 9433T; RAPD type 1), L. casei Type
strain (LMG 6904T; RAPD type 10) and commonly used L.
rhamnosus strains (MW and FMD T2; RAPD type 20). Studies by Yeung et al. [6] and Vancanneyt et al. [7] have also
shown that multiple probiotic products often contain
common LAB strain types. The fingerprinting method was
also highly discriminatory distinguishing closely related
taxa within the L. casei group (Fig. 2), yet at the strain level
detecting 9 types among the 11 isolates examined from
this group. The RAPD PCR-fingerprinting method also
proved very robust and reproducible, with reference
strains and cultivated faecal strains producing exactly the
same amplified polymorphisms at widely disparate sampling and analysis points (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 6). This
reproducibility and the amenability of PCR-fingerprinting
to high throughput analysis enabled it to be used to examine the molecular epidemiology of Lactobacillus consumption by humans for the first time.
Our analysis demonstrated that for the Lactobacillus strains
administered in the feeding study, long term persistence
after consumption was not observed. Interestingly, persistence for greater than 21 days was only observed in volunteer S, the oldest subject in the study (age 65), from
which the L. salivarius NCIMB 30211 capsule strain was
recovered up to day 28 of the study. Increased probiotic
colonisation in older people has been observed by others
[18] and it will be intriguing to examine this phenomenon further using the colony fingerprinting method. The
persistence seen with the subject-specific LAB strains cultivated from faeces is also interesting in this regard. Commercialisation of LAB strains for probiotic use is
dependent on a number of factors, however, from our
study and other work, it appears that many commercialised LAB strains are genotypically identical to reference
strains deposited in recognised culture collections (Table
2). The fingerprinting strategy described herein could be
used to select LAB strains with better persistence in human
populations by screening a large population of healthy
people, and selecting the dominant LAB strain types for
evaluation as probiotics.

Conclusion
We have shown that specific Lactobacillus strains consumed as part of a feeding study can be tracked through
gastrointestinal passage via a colony-based strain typing
strategy. The ability to identify specific LAB strains in faeces after human consumption provides a means to answer
many important questions concerning the clinical use of
probiotics. Our fingerprinting strategy could be used to
identify the presence of the LAB isolates of the same genotype as potential probiotics prior to their administration
in clinical trials, therefore allowing outcome measures
dependent on the probiotic to be distinguished from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/251

those dependent on individuals which may naturally
carry the same LAB strain. Overall, the successful application of molecular epidemiological techniques to cultivable bacterial populations within the human gut provides
a platform for future systematic studies on the development of probiotics, as well as a rapid means to assess the
strain diversity in healthy versus diseased humans.

Methods
Bacterial strains and cultivation
Lactobacillus reference strains were obtained from the Belgium Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms
(BCCM; http://bccm.belspo.be/). Additional commercial
LAB isolates were obtained from Cultech Ltd (Port Talbot,
Wales, UK) or cultured directly from commercially marketed probiotic products as described below; a list of the
strains used in this study is shown in Table 2. All strains of
LAB were cultivated on MRS agar or in MRS broth (Oxoid,
Basingstoke, UK) for 24 to 72 hours at 37°C. Commercial
probiotic capsules and powders were resuspended in 5 ml
MRS broth and serial dilutions plated onto MRS agar. To
improve the isolation of LAB species from faecal samples,
the semi-selective capacity of MRS agar was enhanced by
the additional of 120 units per ml of Polymixin B (MRS-P
medium; Polymixin B from, Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham,
UK). Fresh growth of purified faecal isolates was swabbed
and resuspended in MRS broth containing 8% vol/vol
dimethylsulphoxide prior to storage at -80°C. Frozen
strains were revived by swabbing the surface of the frozen
resuspension and plating onto MRS agar followed by
incubation as above.
RAPD PCR fingerprinting
For standard RAPD fingerprinting, DNA was extracted
from 5 ml overnight broth cultures of LAB as previously
described [13]. For the rapid fingerprinting protocol,
preparation of DNA from single colonies was carried out
as follows. A sterile 200 μl plastic pipette tip was inserted
into a single freshly grown (no longer that 72 hours of
plate growth) bacterial colony, resuspended into 50 μl of
sterile 5% Chelex® 100 resin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK), and then plated onto MRS agar to provide a
pure reference culture. The DNA extraction tubes were
stored frozen at -20°C prior to the extraction of DNA for
PCR. After thawing, the samples were boiled for 5 min
and immediately placed on ice for a further 5 min; this
heating and cooling cycle was repeated once to extract
DNA. The resin was removed by brief centrifugation and
2 μl of the clear supernatant DNA solution used for the
RAPD PCR.

PCR fingerprinting was carried out using a procedure that
was modified from that described [13]. RAPD primers 201
to 300 (10 μg aliquots) were purchased from the Nucleic
Acid Protein Service Unit at the University of British

Columbia, Vancouver, Canada http://www.michaels
mith.ubc.ca/services/NAPS/. The primers that were found
to be appropriate for LAB typing (272, 277 and 287; Table
1) were subsequently ordered individually in bulk from
MWG Biotech (Covent Garden, London), dissolved as
stocks in water at 100 pmol/μl and stored frozen. All PCR
reagents were purchased from Qiagen Ltd. (Crawley, UK)
and routine fingerprinting was carried out in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing: 2.5 μl PCR buffer, 5 μl Q-solution, 1.5 μl 25 mM MgCl2 (3 mM final concentration), 0.5
μl 10 mM dNTPs mixture (200 μM final concentration), 4
μl of 10 pmol/μl stock of RAPD primer, 2 μl of template
DNA (approximately 40 ng) and 0.2 μl (1 unit) of Taq
DNA polymerase. The PCR thermal cycles were carried out
on a Flexigene Thermal Cycler (Techne Ltd., Newcastle,
United Kingdom) as follows (ramping time between temperatures): (i) 4 cycles of 94°C for 5 min., 36°C for 5 min.
(70 sec. cooling time), and 72°C for 5 min. (70 sec. heating time), (ii) 30 cycles of 94°C for1 min. (55 sec. to heat
from 72°C), 36°C for 1 min. (60 sec to cool), 72°C for 2
min. (70 sec. to heat); and (iii) a final extension of 72°C
for 6 min. followed by a hold at 4°C indefinitely.

Information
(NCBI;

All reference LAB strains (Table 2) were typed in duplicate
and the type strain L. acidophilus LMG 9433T was also used
as an internal reproducibility control throughout all
RAPD analysis, with multiple repeats performed to ensure
RAPD typing was reproducible. Fingerprint profiles were
separated by standard gel electrophoresis [13] using 1.5%
high resolution agarose gels (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole UK).
RAPD fingerprints were analysed using computer software
(Gel Compar II, Appied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) and fingerprint profiles compared by calculation of
the Dice coefficient and clustering using the unweighted
pair-group method average (UPGMA); isolates with
RAPD fingerprint Dice coefficients greater than 0.85 were
designated as a distinct bacterial strain.

Lactobacillus feeding study
A probiotic-like capsule (manufactured by Cultech Ltd,
Port Talbot, UK) containing the following strains was formulated according to standard food product guidelines: L.
salivarius strain NCIMB 30211 and L. acidophilus strain
NCIMB 30156. The two strains were selected merely on
the basis that each had been previously used in probiotic
formulations manufactured by Cultech Ltd. The probiotic
capsule was taken once a day for 14 days during feeding
study. Fifteen healthy volunteers were initially enrolled
and 12 participated in the final study. All volunteers gave
written consent to provide faecal samples and take the
Lactobacillus capsules as part of the feeding trial; all were
free to withdraw from the study at any point. In addition,
no exclusion criteria applied to the volunteers and they
were free to eat normally (including diary products) or
take medicinal drugs (such as antibiotics) at any point in
the study.

Molecular systematics
The 16S rRNA gene was used as the primary means to
identify LAB isolates and other bacteria isolated during
the feeding study. The primers applied by Yeung et al. [16]
PAF, 5'-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3' and 536-R, 5'GTA TTA CCG CGG CTG CTG-3', were used to amplify a
528 bp portion of the 16S rRNA gene. The resulting PCR
product was sequenced on both strands using the latter
primers and Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator
ready reaction mix version 3.1, with subsequent analysis
on an Applied Biosystems ABI-Prism 3100 automated
sequencer. The end sequence reads were aligned, error
checked and trimmed to 500 nucleotides to produce a
consensus sequences using BioEdit [20]. Sequences were
compared to: (i) the Ribosomal Database Project II (RDP
II; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) using the sequence match
tool, and (ii) GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment

To further enable accurate speciation within the genus
Lactobacillus, 116 full-length 16S rRNA genes for reference
isolates and type strains within this group were downloaded from the RDP II site and trimmed to match the 500
nucleotide portion obtained from isolates as above. The
sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W [21] and analysed phylogenetically using MEGA 3.1. Several tree-construction algorithms were evaluated; genetic distance trees
drawn using the Jukes-Cantor neighbour-joining method
were selected for the study because they produced phylogenies that were congruent with the current LAB taxonomy
of LAB. To confirm identification of novel non-Lactobacillus species isolated during the study, 16S rRNA genes from
their closest RDP II match (species Type strains) were
included in the phylogenetic analysis. A total of 54 partial
16S rRNA gene sequences were determined as part of this
study and have been deposited in GenBank (Accession
numbers are shown in Table 2).

Faecal samples were provided as follows: (i) Day -14, 2
weeks prior to commencing probiotic administration as a
pre-study control; (ii) Day 0, the start day for probiotic
feeding with the fecal sample taken before ingestion of the
first capsule; (iii) Day 2; (iv) Day 7; (v) Day 14 as the last
day the probiotic formulation was taken; (vi) Day 21, 21
days after probiotic consumption and 7 days following
cessation of feeding; and finally (vi) Day 28, 28 days after
first probiotic consumption and 14 days following cessation of probiotic administration. Ethical approval for the
feeding study was granted by Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University (Approval number 079-1).

Cultivation of LAB from faecal samples
Fresh faecal samples were weighed, diluted 1:10 MRD
diluent (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) containing 15% glycerol, and frozen at -80°C; no significant loss of cultivable
diversity or viability was observed when freshly resuspended and plated faecal samples were compared to replicate samples that had been stored frozen. Serial dilutions
were plated in replicate onto MRS and MRS-P agar, incubated at 37°C for 72 hours, and enumerated quantitatively and qualitatively prior to random picking of up to
10 the different colony morphotypes for RAPD fingerprinting. Each serial dilution plate was documented using
digital photography; if RAPD detected the presence of
either feeding study strain (L. salivarius strain NCIMB
30211 or L. acidophilus strain NCIMB 30156; see Fig. 6),
then retrospective counting of all the morphotypes associated with the strains was performed to determine a total
count per gram of faeces.
Statistical analysis
For enumeration of the faecal counts on MRS-P agar, the
mean and standard error of the mean were determined
and a 2-sample t-test to compare means (all numerical
analysis was performed using MINITAB® Release 15, Minitab Inc.). The overall results of the Lactobacillus feeding
study were analysed non-parametrically using Chi square
because of the limited number of subjects and the variables measured. A 2 × 2 data table was constructed for the
analysis categorising the data as follows: two columns for
the number of volunteers positive and negative for the
administered Lactobacillus strains, respectively, and two
rows for before and after capsule consumption, respectively (positive cultures for any given volunteer were only
counted once).
