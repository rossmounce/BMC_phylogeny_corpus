Abstract
Background: The Austro-Asiatic linguistic family, which is considered to be the oldest of all the
families in India, has a substantial presence in Southeast Asia. However, the possibility of any genetic
link among the linguistic sub-families of the Indian Austro-Asiatics on the one hand and between
the Indian and the Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics on the other has not been explored till now.
Therefore, to trace the origin and historic expansion of Austro-Asiatic groups of India, we analysed
Y-chromosome SNP and STR data of the 1222 individuals from 25 Indian populations, covering all
the three branches of Austro-Asiatic tribes, viz. Mundari, Khasi-Khmuic and Mon-Khmer, along
with the previously published data on 214 relevant populations from Asia and Oceania.
Results: Our results suggest a strong paternal genetic link, not only among the subgroups of Indian
Austro-Asiatic populations but also with those of Southeast Asia. However, maternal link based on
mtDNA is not evident. The results also indicate that the haplogroup O-M95 had originated in the
Indian Austro-Asiatic populations ~65,000 yrs BP (95% C.I. 25,442 – 132,230) and their ancestors
carried it further to Southeast Asia via the Northeast Indian corridor. Subsequently, in the process
of expansion, the Mon-Khmer populations from Southeast Asia seem to have migrated and
colonized Andaman and Nicobar Islands at a much later point of time.
Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with the linguistic evidence, which suggests that the
linguistic ancestors of the Austro-Asiatic populations have originated in India and then migrated to
Southeast Asia.

Background
The Indian subcontinent is presently inhabited by four

major linguistic groups, viz. Austro-Asiatic, Dravidian,
Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman that might have

entered at different points of time. Based on the observation that Austro-Asiatic family has the greatest divergence
in their nouns [1] and some other linguistic features (for
details, refer to discussion), it is considered to be the oldest of the four linguistic families [1,2] and consists of three
sub-families [3]: (1) Mundari, spoken by a number of
tribes inhabiting Chota-Nagpur plateau in Central and
Eastern India, (2) Mon-Khmer, spoken by Nicobarese and
Shompen tribes from Andaman and Nicobar islands and
(3) Khasi-Khmuic (which linguists earlier considered as
part of Mon-Khmer) represented by only the Khasi subtribes from Northeast India (Fig. 1). The Indian KhasiKhmuic to a certain extent and Mon-Khmer groups have
physical features of East Asian populations [4], whereas
the Mundari populations have features similar to those of
the Dravidian linguistic family. Further, except the Mundari sub-family which is restricted to the Indian subcontinent, the languages of the other two sub-families of
Austro-Asiatics are spoken by a large number of populations in Southeast Asia (Fig. 1). However, neither the possibility of any genetic link among the three linguistic
branches of Indian Austro-Asiatics, nor that between the
Indian and Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics has been comprehensively explored till now, despite the fact that the
Indian subcontinent has been considered to have probably served as an important corridor for migrations to
Southeast Asia.
Two routes of migration by which Austro-Asiatic groups
possibly entered the Indian subcontinent have been suggested based on the linguistic, archaeological and classical
genetic marker [4] and the references therein]; the first
being migration from Africa to India via Central Asia,
while the second route is from Africa to Northeast Asia
and then to the Indian subcontinent. Basu et al. [5] found
high frequency of Haplogroup K-M9 among the Mundari
populations and inferred that the Austro-Asiatic populations have migrated from Africa to India via central Asia,
which is flawed since this haplogroup is ubiquitously
found in Asia and has a substantial presence in the whole
of East Asia. On the other hand, from the analysis of
mtDNA 9bp (9-base-pair) del/ins (deletion/insertion)
polymorphisms, Thangaraj et al. [6] and Prasad et al. [7]
reported only East Asian-specific mtDNA haplogroups in
Nicobarese, while Roychoudury et al. [8] and Metspalu et
al. [9] found only Indian-specific mtDNA haplogroups in
Mundari populations. The above inferences were, however, based on meager genetic evidence and very few Austro-Asiatic populations (a maximum of 3) were included
in those studies. Although Kumar et al. [10] analysed a
large number of Austro-Asiatic populations and suggested
distinct origins and migration histories of the Mundari,
Khasi-Khmuic and Mon-Khmer populations, the analysis
was based only on the mtDNA 9bp del/ins polymorphisms and its characterization.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/47

We sampled almost all the Austro-Asiatic populations of
India covering the entire geographic and micro-linguistic
heterogeneity inherent among them (Table 1 and Fig. S1
[see Additional file 1]). This includes molecular genetic
data on the Austro-Asiatic Khasi from Northeast India,
which is considered an important corridor for human
migrations to Southeast Asia. We present results based on
the analysis of Y-chromosome SNP and STR data of Austro-Asiatic tribes along with the previously published data
of 214 other relevant populations and try to trace the origin and historic expansion of Austro-Asiatic groups of
India. Based on this evidence, we propose that haplogroup O-M95 has originated in the Indian Austro-Asiatics,
particularly among the Mundaris, whose ancestors moved
further to Southeast Asia along with this haplogroup.

Results
Distribution and frequency of Y-chromosome haplogroups
The population-wise distribution of Y-haplogroup frequency and diversity along with haplotype diversity based
on 16 Y-STR is furnished in Table 2. Overall, the haplotype diversity is high (98.87%) and ranges from 95.26%
in Pando to 100% in Khasi, Garo, Paharia, Nagesia and
Birijia. Out of the 13 potential haplogroups defined by the
binary markers typed in the present study (Fig. 2) nine
haplogroups were found among these populations. The
average frequency of haplogroup O-M95 is highest (52%)
followed by H-M69 (26%). Among the three sub-families
of Austro-Asiatics, on an average, 55% of Mundari, 41%
of Khasi-Khmuic from Northeast India and all the 11
Nicobarese samples belong to O-M95. To know if the
unclassified O-M95 samples have sub-linegaes, we also
typed downstream M88 binary marker but none showed
the presence of O-M88 haplogroups. Except Khasi (29%)
and 1 sample of Korku (2%), none of the Indian AustroAsiatic populations shows the presence of haplogroup OM122. Further, the Garo tribe shows haplogroup O-M122
as most common (55%) followed by O-M95 (18%). Since
Austro-Asiatic Khasi and Tibeto-Burman Garo live in close
proximity in Meghalaya and are known to have frequent
marital interactions [11,12], we further typed all the samples of haplogroup O-M122 from Garo and Khasi populations to see if O-M122 among the Khasis is not due to
admixture with the Garo. We found only 3 out of the 8
haplogroups defined by the binary markers used in this
study (Fig. 3) i.e. O-M133*, O-M134* and O-M122*. The
frequency of O-M134* was highest in both Khasi (56%)
and Garo (67%) followed by O-M133*. Three each of
Khasi and Garo out of 27 and 18 O-M122 samples,
respectively, remained in the undefined clade O-M122*.
Thus the Khasi and Garo show homogeneous distribution
of the sub-lineages of O-M122 (χ2 = 1.597; p = 0.45).

Analysis of Molecular Variance and Y-STR Networks
The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) based on YSNPs (Table 3) suggests that Indian and Southeast Asian
Austro-Asiatic populations are well differentiated (FST =
0.203). The FST value is larger by 3% between Mundari
and Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics indicating relatively
higher level of differentiation between them. However,
the FST value turns out to be relatively much smaller
(0.045) between Khasi and Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatic
populations, suggesting greater genetic affinity between
them when compared with the Khasi affinity to Mundari
populations (FST = 0.099). Nicobarese were not included
in this analysis as all their samples fall in O-M95. AMOVA
based on Y-STRs suggests high FST value (0.175) between
Mundari and Khasi, but relatively much smaller when
compared to that between Khasi and Nicobarese (0.289)
or between Mundari and Nicobarese (0.442).

The Median Joining (M-J) network based on the 16 Y-STRs
of the O-M95 samples (Fig. 4) depicts two broad and distinct clades, one representing Mundari groups and the
other Khasi and Nicobarese populations. Although the
Nicobarese clade is a part of the Khasi clade, it consists of

two distinct branches suggesting a separate identity. As
expected, due to the considerable degree of admixture, the
M-J network shows that the Garo samples form a part of
Khasi subclade, not a separate clade. Further, the M-J network constructed separately for the sub-haplogroups of
O-M122 suggests that neither in the case of O-M134*
(Fig. S2 [see Additional file 1]) nor in the case of OM133* (results not shown) the Garo and Khasi samples
form distinct clades, suggesting a distinct possibility of
gene flow between them.
Time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA)
Since O-M95 was found to be the most common haplogroup, we estimated TMRCA for this lineage with the help
of BATWING program [13] and using 16 Y-STRs. We
chose the demographic model with an exponential
growth from an initially constant-sized population with
sub-division. Although there are other 2 models, the
demographic model chosen for this study is considered to
be the most appropriate [14-17] for human populations;
this model assumes that population sizes were constant
until they became semi-sedentary or sedentary, probably
till the advent of agriculture, which was followed by an

exponential growth. (for details on computational procedure, see Methods). The median estimate of TMRCA
(Table 4) with 106 MCMC cycles for the whole of AustroAsiatic groups turns out to be ~68,000 YBP (95% C.I.
25,442 – 132,230). The TMRCA for the Mundari
(~66,000) and Khasi (~57,000) is similar, whereas for
Nicobarese it is considerably lower (~17,000). Further,
the average of TMRCA estimated for individual Mundari
and transitional populations turns out to be large
(~48,000), ranging from ~70,000 YBP to ~30,000 YBP
(results not shown), suggesting that the haplogroup OM95 might have originated early, possibly in the Paleolithic period.

Haplogroup isofrequency maps
Isofrequency maps were generated for all the haplogroups
but only the relevant two maps pertaining to O-M95 and
O-M122 are presented in Figure 5. The data of our study
along with the comparative data on 214 other relevant
populations suggest that the haplogroup O-M95 is ubiquitously found in Southeast Asia, while in India it is
restricted to the regions where Austro-Asiatic populations
are found. This strongly suggests that Austro-Asiatic populations of India are not only linguistically linked to
Southeast Asian populations but also genetically associated. The present day distribution of Austro-Asiatic linguistic groups and the distribution of haplogroup O-M95

appear to be highly correlated (Table 5 and Fig. 5). For
example, its average frequency is only 3.4% and 0.1%
(Table 5), respectively, in northeast and Central Asia
where no Austro-Asiatic population is found, whereas it is
much higher in Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics (38%) as
well as in the neighboring non-Austro-Asiatics (14.7%).
Further, this frequency is significantly much higher in
Austro-Asiatics than in non-Austro-Asiatics (χ2 = 22.77; P
< 0.001). There is also a decreasing gradient of O-M95 frequency as we move from India to Southeast Asia,
although this trend is less apparent in the map because 7
of 45 groups from Southeast Asia show O-M95 frequency
in the range of 50% to 75%. However, for six of those 7
populations the sample sizes are less than 20, some being
very small. In any case, the average frequency of O-M95 in
Indian Austro-Asiatic populations is much higher (54%)
when compared (Table 5) to those of Southeast Asia,
whether Austro-Asiatic (38%; χ2= 68.89; p < 0.001) or
non-Austro-Asiatic (14.7%; χ2 = 330.68; p < 0.001). On
the other hand, haplogroup O-M122 distribution in India
is confined only to the Northeast India, as depicted in the
map by a sharp boundary (Fig. 5), whereas it is equally
prevalent in Northeast and Southeast Asia (Table 5). The
spread of haplogroup H-M69 (Fig. S3 [see Additional file
1]) appears to be confined to the boundaries of the Indian

subcontinent and, therefore, very strongly suggests its origin in the Indian subcontinent.

Discussion
A common genetic heritage of the Austro-Asiatic groups
Mundari populations show O-M95 as the most common
haplogroup and only three of the 22 populations –
Lodha, Savara and Mahali- show departure from this general trend (Table 2), which appears to be because of their
disputed origin [31]. This haplogroup is also found in a
relatively high frequency in the Khasi and Nicobarese. It is
therefore not surprising that in a recent study [32] all the
12 samples of Shompen from Nicobar islands, like their
own linguistic neighbors from the region, the Nicobarese,
showed O-M95. This may underscore that the Mundari,
Khasi-Khmuic and Mon-Khmer groups of India are not
only linguistically related but also genetically linked,
probably with a single but relatively broad paternal
genetic source. This haplogroup has been reported to be
absent or present in low frequency in other linguistic
groups of India [20,25-29], suggesting a distinct genetic
identity of the Indian Austro-Asiatic populations. On the
other hand, while the Austro-Asiatic populations of
Southeast Asia show high frequency of O-M95 (average
38%) their neighboring populations also show consider-

able frequency (14.7%). However, this haplogroup has
negligible presence in North and Central Asia (Fig. 5 and
Table 5). Thus the predominance of this haplogroup both
in Austro-Asiatic populations of India and Southeast Asia
and its absence/negligible presence in other Asian populations suggests a common genetic heritage of the people
of this linguistic family.
The virtual absence of O-M95 in the Tibeto-Burman populations of India [20,28,29] suggests that the migrations
of these populations into India were not accompanied by
the O-M95 haplogroup. Therefore, the presence of this
haplogroup in the Garo tribe of Meghalaya is due to high
degree of gene flow from the neighboring Khasi, which
has been facilitated by the matrilocal system of marriage
among these two tribes [11,12]. Similarly, the presence of
haplogroup O-M122 in the Austro-Asiatic Khasi with relatively high frequency (29%) could be suspected to be
due to gene flow from the neighboring Garo, which is
substantiated by a similar frequency and composition of
subclades of O-M122 between them (χ2 = 1.597; p =
0.45). Concurrently, no separate Y-STR lineages could be
identified in the M-J network within the subclades (Fig. S2
[see Additional file 1]). The comparative data suggests
that Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics near the Northeast
border of India [33] have either O-M133* or O-M134*
subclades (63%), whereas majority of the Austro-Asiatic

populations from geographically distant Southeast China
and Cambodia [24,33] have O-M159 subclade (65%),
suggesting that the Austro-Asiatic populations of different
regions have different subclades of O-M122, which are
characteristic of the neighboring non-Austro-Asiatic
groups, possibly due to extensive admixture. Therefore,
the presence of O-M133* and/or O-M134* subclades in
the Austro-Asiatic Khasi and other Tibeto-Burman populations [28] including Garo from Northeast India may
imply that the O-M122 in Khasi probably had its source
in the neighboring Tibeto-Burman groups, particularly
from the Garo. Although the foregoing analysis suggests
that the Austro-Asiatic populations of India share common genetic ties, a comparative analysis among the subfamilies suggests that these populations have separated
quite early and are now well differentiated as indicated by
the results of AMOVA (Table 3), the M-J network (Fig. 4)
and the TMRCA (Table 4).
Origin of haplogroup O-M95 and expansion of AustroAsiatic populations
Given the overwhelmingly high frequency of O-M95 in
the Austro-Asiatic populations it is most likely that this
haplogroup has originated among them. However, the
question is whether it has its origin in India or Southeast
Asia? The most likely region of origin of a haplogroup can
be identified on the basis of two characteristics – the high-

est frequency and the highest diversity [34]. The maximum frequency of O-M95 among the 8 Southeast Asian
Austro-Asiatic populations is only 35% after excluding 3
populations with small sample size. On the other hand,
the sample size for Mundari populations is generally large
(~35–109, except for two) and the frequency of the haplogroup ranges from 39%–98% with an average of 63%
(excluding the three populations with disputed origin),
which is significantly higher compared to that of the
Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics (χ2 = 108.60; p < 0.001).
Furthermore, the haplotype diversity among the Mundari
populations is as high as 99%. Given this and the fact that
this haplogroup is nearly absent in other parts of India as
well as in Western and Central Asia, one may safely conclude that O-M95 has originated in Mundari populations
roughly around 65,000 YBP (95% C.I. 25,442 – 132,230),
as suggested by TMRCA. Therefore, the ancestors of
present day Mundari populations must have come to
India prior to the origin of haplogroup O-M95, probably
in the Pleistocene era. This is consistent with the archeological evidence, which suggest human habitation in
mainland India during early Paleolithic times [35-37].
Kayser et al. [16], however, suggested Southeast Asian origin of haplogroup O-M95, implying migration of AustroAsiatic populations from Southeast Asia to India. Based
on the presence of East Asian mtDNA haplogroups,
Kumar et al. [10] and Thangaraj et al. [6] suggested that
the non-Mundari Austro-Asiatic groups of India (Nico-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/47

barese and Khasi) have migrated from Southeast Asia.
However, no such maternal genetic link between the
Mundari tribes [8-10], and those of Southeast Asia was
found. Further, our analysis of 1147 samples representing
most of the Mundari tribes, including the transitional
groups, shows total absence of East Asian mtDNA haplogroups [Kumar V, Reddy BM and Langstieh BT, unpublished results), suggesting different maternal genetic
histories of the three sub-families of Austro-Asiatics of
India as compared to the common paternal genetic history outlined earlier. How do we account for this discrepancy? Since all the sub-families of Austro-Asiatics have a
common paternal genetic link in haplogroup O-M95,
which is absent in the case of mtDNA, a predominantly
male driven migration of Austro-Asiatic populations
appears to be a strong possibility. However, and most
importantly, haplogroup O-M122, which is considered to
be the signature haplogroup of Southeast Asian populations, is absent among the Mundari populations, whereas
any inference on the migration of populations from
Southeast Asia is principally based on the presence of haplogroup O-M122 [18,20,33]. The age estimated for haplogroup O-M122 is between 15,000–60,000 YBP [18]
whereas it is ~8,000 YBP for O-M95 in Southeast Asia
[16]. Therefore, if indeed Indian Austro-Asiatic populations would have migrated from Southeast Asia, then they
should have shown the presence of haplogroup O-M122,
and/or the TMRCA estimated for O-M95 among the Mundaris of India should have been much lower (Table 4)

used relatively higher mutation rates and only 7 of the 16
loci, we reanalyzed our data based on those 7 loci and the
mutation rate used by Kayser et al. [16] and observed a
similar TMRCA (~65,000 YBP) suggesting that the TMRCA
of the present study may not be an artifact of large number
of loci and low mutation rate. Furthermore, the Mundari
populations are considered to be traditionally hunters
and food-gatherers and at present they inhabit the areas
unfit for cultivation, which may reflect their traditional
mode of subsistence. Therefore, migration of Mundari
populations during demic expansion of the agriculturalists in the Neolithic era appears improbable as has been
suggested for Nicobarese [6]. Based on these evidences, we
suggest that the ancestors of present day Mundari populations have migrated to Southeast Asia instead of coming
from Southeast Asia. This scenario is also consistent with
the inference that Mundari language is grammatically and
phonologically the most conservative branch of the Austro-Asiatic family [2,38] and more similar to proto-Austroasiatics than the other branches of this family
suggesting that linguistic ancestors of the Mundari populations have originated in India [39]. The foregoing analysis therefore suggests in-situ origin of O-M95
haplogroup, most probably in the ancestors of present
day Mundari populations, who might have carried it further to Southeast Asia.
The results of AMOVA (Table 3), M-J Network (Fig. 4) and
TMRCA of haplogroup O-M95 (Table 4) suggest an early
separation of Mundari and other Austro-Asiatic populations. Due to this early separation, we expected that at
least in one of these groups sublineage of O-M95 might
have originated. However, none of the groups showed the
sublineage O-M88 (Fig. 2). Till now this lineage has been
reported from the region of Cambodia and Laos only in 1
sample [40] suggesting probably that this lineage is
present with a very low frequency and is probably originated and confined to that region. Therefore, if the sublineage(s) exists, it is probably identified by some other
binary marker(s) which is yet to be known. Since the
Khasi shows relatively high frequency of O-M122 (29%)
and given that populations of Khasi-Khmuic sub-family
are concentrated in the regions North of Burma and Thailand (Fig. 1), one may suspect that Khasi-Khmuic popula-

tions have migrated from Southeast Asia to India.
However, the presence of O-M122 in the Khasi is
observed to be due to gene flow from the neighboring
Garo, suggesting that this population was initially devoid
of this haplogroup. Moreover, Indian mtDNA haplogroups constitute 30% of the mtDNA motifs of the Khasi
subtribes, (Reddy BM et al. unpublished manuscript),
which are practically absent in their Tibeto-Burman neighbors [8,41]. Therefore, the presence of East Asian mtDNA
among the Khasi could be due to gene flow from the
neighboring Garo and the other Tibeto-Burman populations which have virtually only East Asian mtDNA haplogroups. This may reinforce the suggestion that Mundari
and Khasi-Khmuic populations have separated long back
and the latter have probably gone to Southeast Asia, via
the northeast Indian corridor, as reflected in their geographic distribution (Fig. 1).
The Nicobarese is also quite distinct from both the Mundari and Khasi-Khmuic tribes as revealed by the AMOVA
(Table 3) and M-J network (Fig. 4) based on Y-STRs. This
tribe has only East Asian female lineages [6,7] and only OM95 as male lineages (Fig. 2 and Table 2). We also performed AMOVA based on the same set of 16 Y-STR for
Shompen tribe [32], which is also a Mon-Khmer group.
The results suggest that Shompen like the Nicobarese are
also quite distinct from the Mundari (FST = 0.402) and the
Khasi (FST = 0.476). The TMRCA of Nicobarese (~17,000
YBP) and the Shompen (~19,000 YBP), and the distribution of Mon-Khmer populations (Fig. 1), which is confined to lower part of Burma and Thailand, Vietnam and
Cambodia suggest that they have migrated from Southeast Asia to India during demic expansion of the agriculturalists in the Neolithic era [42]. The complete absence of
O-M122 among them appears to be due to the profound
impact of founder effect and subsequent genetic drift,
although the ascertainment bias due to small sample size
cannot be ruled out.
Two possible routes of entry of Austro-Asiatics into the
Indian Subcontinent
Kumar and Reddy [4] suggested the possibility of ancestors of Indian Austro-Asiatic tribes having migrated from
Africa to India via either Northeast Asia through the

Haplogroup frequency data are collected from references cited in the legend of Figure 5; AA = Austro-Asiatic

Northeast Indian corridor or via Central Asia through its
Western Indian corridor. The sister-clade of haplogroup
O-M175, i.e. haplogroup N-LLY22g, is confined only to
Northeast Asia including Russia and Siberia (Table 5) and
is absent or found in negligibly low frequency in Central,
South and Southeast Asia. Similarly, the haplogroup OM175 and its subclades are either absent or found in low
frequency in South (except among Austro-Asiatics) and
central Asia, while it is present in whole of East Asia. Two
alternative scenarios can be envisaged: 1) it appears that
the modern man had probably migrated from Africa to
Northeast Asia via Central Asia, where the haplogroups NLLY22g and O-M175 might have originated [43,44]. Subsequently, populations carrying haplogroup O-M175
might have migrated to India, where haplogroup O-M95
could have originated and later on spread to Southeast
Asia. However, since 100% of the Mundari populations
and 30% of the Khasi samples show Indian-specific
mtDNA whereas all the Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatic
populations have East Asian-specific mtDNA only [45],
this migration could have been primarily male driven. 2)
In view of this, the possibility of ancestors of Austro-Asi-

O-M95

atics migrating from central Asia to India through the
western Indian corridor cannot be discounted, as it can
account for the presence of contrasting patterns of mtDNA
in the Indian and Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics.
Although neither haplogroup O-M175 nor N-LLY22g has
been reported from central Asia, many studies have
observed reasonably high frequency of haplogroup KM9* [15,24,26] and it is possible that these samples may
fall in the haplogroup defined by the binary marker
M214, which connects haplogroups 'O' and 'N' [46].
However, this marker has not been typed in the Central
Asian populations. A section of the population might
have migrated towards Northeast Asia where haplogroup
'N' originated and another wave towards South Asia and
entered India through its western corridor wherein haplogroup O-M175 originated. Haplogroup O-M95 might
have evolved subsequently as a predominant male lineage
along with the Indian-specific female lineages. Subsequently, a primarily male-driven and rapid migration of
these people to Southeast Asia via Northeast India might
have resulted in the total absence of Indian-specific
mtDNA haplogroups but presence of 100% East Asian

motifs in the Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics. The age estimation of fossils of anatomically modern man excavated
from East Asia is not older than 40,000 YBP [18,47,48],
which may imply that the earliest possible migration of
Austro-Asiatic populations to Southeast Asia is about
40,000 YBP or later. Therefore, the Mundari populations
appear to be one of the earliest source of populations
from which the Khasi-Khmuic and Mon-Khmer populations have separated quite early and migrated to and settled in Southeast Asia, while another wave of migration,
much later, by the Mon-Khmer people from Southeast
Asia through Thailand and coastal southern Burma to
Andaman and Nicobar Islands can be inferred from the
current spread of Mon-Khmer populations (Fig. 1).

Conclusion
To sum up we conclude that, because of its very high frequency and diversity, haplogroup O-M95 had an in-situ
origin among the Indian Austro-Asiatics, particularly
among the Mundaris, not in Southeast Asia as envisaged
earlier. Given the large estimate of TMRCA, our study suggests that the Mundari populations are one of the earliest
settlers in the Indian Subcontinent. It is most likely that
these populations have come from Central Asia through
the Western Indian corridor and subsequently colonized
Southeast Asia, although more data on Y-chromosome
and mtDNA are needed from other relevant populations
to draw firmer conclusions.

Methods
Sampling
Intravenous blood samples were collected from a total of
1222 healthy unrelated individuals belonging to 25 tribal
populations out of which 17 are Austro-Asiatic groups
and 7 are transitional groups, which are considered to
have certain geographical and historical affinities to the
former, and also presumed to be formerly speaking Austro-Asiatic languages. We collected blood samples from
different Mundari, Khasi-Khmuic and Mon-Khmer speaking tribal groups in such a way that the entire gamut of
genetic heterogeneity of the Austro-Asiatic tribal populations in India is comprehensively reflected; we collected
samples from different dialectical categories of the AustroAsiatic tribal populations and also from different geographic units of the same tribe as some of them are distributed in a wide territory. We have also included the TibetoBurman speaking Garo tribe of Meghalaya since it inhabits the contiguous and/or overlapping geographic locations of the Khasi with which it is known to have marital
interaction. The area of sampling within each state is
shown in Figure S1 [see Additional file 1] while the names
of populations along with the sample size and districtwise details of sampling are furnished in Table 1.
Informed consent was obtained from all the donors
before collecting their blood.

Genetic Analyses
DNA was extracted from these samples using the protocol
of Sambrook [49]. The following 20 Y-Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs) which are known to detect variations in Asia were screened using direct sequencing (Fig. 3
and 4): M89, M69, M172, M9, M11, M175, M95, M88,
M122, M119, M45, M173, M124, M134, M159, M164,
M7, M121, M133 and M162. The details of these markers
are described elsewhere [44]. Many of the samples were
typed with all the binary markers for internal check on the
reliability of the typing and also to detect recurrent mutations. We used the nomenclature as suggested and followed by Y-chromosome consortium [50].

We have also typed the following 20 Y-Short Tandem
Repeat (STRs) loci: DYS19, DYS385a, DYS385b, DYS388,
DYS389I, DYS389b, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393,
DYS426, DYS437, DYS438, DYS439, DYS447, DYS448,
DYS460, H4, YCAIIa and YCAIIb. Y-STRs were amplified
by multiplex PCR [51] and were analysed on ABI 3730
sequencer. The GENOTYPER software was used to analyze
the fragment size. The fragment sizes of the alleles were
converted into repeat units as suggested by Butler et al.
[51].
Although Y-chromosome is highly variable, because of
the low rate of parallel and back mutation of the binary
markers on the non-recombinant part, they are particularly useful for reconstructing and identifying stable paternal lineages that can be traced back in time over thousand
of years [18,50]. Further, the smaller effective population
size makes Y-chromosome probably the best genetic tool
to study early human migrations as bottleneck events that
are often associated with such migrations becoming more
pronounced [18,50]. Despite natural selection being a
potentially important force which may affect the entire Ychromosome and produce an increase in frequency of a
lineage more rapidly than would be expected by drift, the
empirical evidence so far is not conclusive [46].
Statistical Analyses
Since the DYS389II allele length also contains DYS389I,
for all statistical analyses a simple subtraction of DYS389I
allele length from that of DYS389II was done to avoid the
double-counting variation at DYS389I. The subtracted
DYS389II allele is named as DYS389b. Since DYS385a
and DYS385b, and YCAIIa and YCAIIb alleles could not
be assigned to their respective loci, these loci were omitted
and further analyses were done based on the remaining16
Y-STRs. The Y-SNP and modified Y-STR data were then
analyzed for haplogroup and haplotype diversity, respectively, along with their associated SE by means of the software package ARLEQUIN 3.01 [52]. Analysis of Molecular
Variance (AMOVA) was also carried out for both Y-SNP
and STR data using ARLEQUIN 3.01 software. Y-STR hap-

lotypes were grouped according to haplogroups and
Median Joining (M-J) network were constructed by use of
the program NETWORK 3.0 [53]. A weighting scheme was
followed on the basis of the molecular variance of each
microsatellite in all the chromosomes, with the weight
inversely proportional to the variance. The weights
assigned were from 2 to 8.

data to generate isofrequency maps using the ArcView
program of the GIS software. The data points used here are
shown as black dots. As the Nicobarese is the only population sampled from that region, it had an overwhelming
influence on the contour, hence excluded from the haplogroup isofrequency map calculation.

Authors' contributions
TMRCA of a haplogroup provides an important limitation
to its spread implying that this haplogroup must have
spread after this time and the population carrying this lineage must have arrived in this region prior to the origin of
this haplogroup. Therefore we estimated the TMRCA
using Bayesian Analysis of Tree With Internal Node Generation (BATWING) as implemented in Wilson et al. [13].
This program uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
procedure to generate phylogenetic trees and associated
parameter values consistent with input data (a set of Y
haplotypes), besides genetic and demographic models.
The genetic model assumes single-step mutations of the
STRs and the demographic model chosen was an exponential growth from an initially constant-sized population with sub-division. Based on the Zhivotovsky et al.
[54] evolutionary mutation rate we applied a gamma distribution of (1.47, 2130) as mutation rate for all the 16 YSTRs. For alpha, beta and N priors the gamma distribution
of (2, 400), (2, 1) and (1, 0.001), respectively, was used
[15,17]. We have used the generation time of 25 years. In
all runs, 13,000 samples of the output were taken and the
first 3,000 runs were discarded as burn-in. Thus, all the
results are based on 10,000 samples. The number of
MCMC iterations between each sample varied between
runs from 102 to 105, so the overall runs ranged from 106
to 109 MCMC cycles. Our initial analyses were performed
with 106 MCMC cycles using all the O-M95 Y-chromosomes of all the populations, but the value of median
Nposterior (the effective population size before the population began to expand) was ~13,000 which was quite
large given that global value is ~5000 [15,17]. We
increased the MCMC cycle and found that the Nposterior
value and expansion time decrease and increase, respectively, with increase in MCMC cycle and do not stabilize
even at 109 cycles. Therefore, we chose 3–5 Y-chromosomes of haplogroup O-M95 from each population at
random to produce a sample subset and observed a convergence of values of Nposterior and expansion time at
106 and 107 MCMC cycles. These parameters suggest a
value of ~1000 for the effective population size for this
region which is consistent with other studies on East Asia
[17,18].
Haplogroup frequency data on 214 populations (sources
given in the legend to Fig. 7) from whole of Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, Oceania and Australia gathered from the published sources were used along with our

BMR conceived the project; BMR and VK designed the
study and wrote the manuscript. BTL and VK collected the
samples; AGR, ANS, BTL, JPB, TNR and VK performed the
experiments; VK performed the statistical analysis; BMR,
LS and KT contributed reagents and laboratory equipments; all authors read, revised and approved the final
manuscript.
