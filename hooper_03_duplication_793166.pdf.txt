Abstract

Conclusions: The results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes,
but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. The importance of duplication may therefore
depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be
discovered. Therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by
bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.

copy of a gene is free to evolve and diverge, until it may attain
a novel function [1]. Recently, several authors have challenged the period of neutrality implied by the old model, and
shifted the focus more towards how new paralogs avoid neutrality by gene-amplification effects [2]. A gene amplification
will be either selected, neutral or counter-selected, depending
on the original gene function. If noncoding DNA is duplicated, then both paralogs are probably transient in the
genome. If the paralogs have a weak but slightly selected
product, amplification may be selected. However, if gene
products are strong, well-established, highly expressed or

There are few natural niches left on Earth that have yet to be
colonized by microbes. The adaptability of prokaryotic life in
particular is arguably a major reason for its success. In order
to use new metabolites, or to survive new environments,
microbes need genes that code for products that facilitate survival. There are basically two methods by which genomes
expand their repertoire of genes: creating them through
duplication and adaptation or taking existing genes from outside sources. The method of duplication has been examined
extensively, starting as a model of gene evolution where a

Background: Recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted
a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have
a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. Here we examine the duplicative
behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome,
namely laterally transferred genes. Using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach,
we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide
composition and frequency of duplication.

Results
Summary of gene categories

As an alternative to developing new gene functions through
duplication, an organism can incorporate DNA from outside
sources through the process of lateral transfer. This process of
gene transfer has been observed not only for eubacteria (for
example [4-6]), but also for archaea [7,8] and eukaryotes.
Over the years, systematic studies of lateral transfer (for
example [9-12]) have sparked an animated debate on the
extent of lateral transfer. Some authors propose that it is a
major force in genome evolution [13-15], whereas others
downplay its role. One factor limiting the impact of lateral
transfer may be the high level of complexity in a large number
of pathways; a single transferred gene will have difficulty outcompeting an indigenous gene that is part of an adapted system of complex protein interactions [16,17]. Certainly, highly
optimized genes are difficult to replace in the genome
through lateral transfer, even if they are not a part of a complex pathway. However, duplication of such genes could also
be disruptive and thereby reduce the impact of duplication on
gene innovation. Of course, clusters of genes as well as single
genes can be imported. Some gene families, such as the phosphonate metabolism phn group, are widely considered to
have been imported into Escherichia coli ([9] and references
therein), and are organized as clusters of genes. This may,
perhaps, be the only way, however improbable, to circumvent
conservation caused by complexity. For reasons of complexity
and optimization, it may be more interesting from an evolutionary point of view to shift the focus from well-established
genes with highly optimized functions to the weaker ones, as
it is here that evolutionary mechanisms such as duplication
and lateral transfer may have more significant effects.
We previously studied lateral transfer of genes between species in the Salmonella/Escherichia clade [18], and also the
turnover and fixation of duplications within various species
[3]. It was found that the rates of both lateral transfer and
duplication in for instance E. coli are considerable, but that
only a few imports and duplications survive deletion. Also,
very few recently imported genes seem to have a defined
product. However, the results also suggest that the contribution to gene innovation is mainly the result of gene-dosage
effects of weak or ancillary gene functions. Even though paralogs can be selected for amplification of strong, established
functions, we found that these events rarely result in new
gene functions.
Here we examine whether an influx of weak or nonfunctional
genes into a genome can actually contribute to gene innovation through duplication. Furthermore, we examine the general patterns of lateral transfer among a selection of

Genes are grouped by their presence or absence in a selection
of organisms (Table 1). In gene group A (Table 2), we expect
to find the most recent additions to the genome through contributions from both lateral transfer and duplication. Because
these genes are present only in the subject organism, it is
probable that lateral transfer occurred after the last divergence. In the case of relatively recent divergence, such as for
instance Salmonella typhimurium and S. typhi, the total
number of genes (N) in category A is relatively small, whereas
organisms which are farther apart (for example, Bacillus subtilis and B. halodurans) have larger numbers of unique genes.
However, there is probably no constant rate at which
genomes acquire genes. This is illustrated by the comparison
between the two E. coli strains, where the A group is almost
twice as large in O157:H7 than in K12. This suggests that
strain O157:H7 is more active than K12 in gene acquisition
either mechanistically or because of added selective pressure.
Other pairs of organisms, such as E. coli K12 and S. typhimurium, have more similar patterns of gene acquisition. Imports
in category B (Table 3) are on average older than in category
A, and many genes are likely to have been lost in the outgroup
genomes as a result of different lifestyles and requirements.
Genes in category D are present in all four organisms in the
group, and are probably not recently transferred genes.
In previous work [18,19] we have developed a compositional
measure (cT2; see Materials and methods) to find genes with
atypical dinucleotide frequencies. This measure is used in
combination with the gene categories. Through all categories
and in all comparisons, the number of atypical genes is the
highest in groups that are associated with recent lateral transfer. The proportion of deviant genes (Pdev; P(cT2 > 38)) are
consistently higher in categories A and B than in D (Table 4),

halodurans appears to have a narrower GC3 range of potential imports, which could be explained by one of three reasons. First, B. subtilis and B. halodurans have been diverging
for so long that the A group could be dominated by old
imports that have had time to ameliorate to the genomic GC3
distribution. Second, it is possible that the number of donor
organisms is lower in the halophilic environment of B. halodurans. If so, there could be less variation in the GC3 range of
imports. Third, genes in category A could be primarily genes
that have been lost in B. subtilis but present in the ancestor,
although this explanation also means that the same genes
have been lost in Clostridium.

information

The distributions of guanine and cytosine at the third codon
position (GC3) in categories A and D are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 5. Category A is generally 'flatter' than the GC3
distribution of category D. In some genomes, particularly in
the Escherichia/Salmonella clade, GC3 is almost uniformly
distributed. Given that genes in category A are good candidates for lateral transfer, a flat distribution would suggest
that the GC3 range of imports is wide. Accordingly, the
number of donor genomes must be large enough to incorporate a broad spectrum of gene GC3 content. In the Bacillus/
Clostridium clade, the GC3 pattern of the A groups resembles
that of the D groups to varying degrees. Particularly B.

GC3 distributions in gene-categories A and D

To focus on the genes that were likely to be more recent
imports in Clostridium acetobutylicum, B. subtilis and B.
halodurans, which have long divergence times, we studied
the GC3 distribution of the subset of A genes with high cT2 values. Genes with cT2 scores grater than 30 were compared to
the rest of the set (Figure 2). The numbers of genes with
scores over 30 were 91, 97 and 78 for C. acetobutylicum, B.
subtilis and B. halodurans respectively. The GC3 distribution
of the high-cT2 genes in C. acetobutylicum differs neither
from the rest of the genes in the A group, nor from those in
the D group (Figure 1h). This could either be due to a lower
rate of import (all imports have ameliorated), or a consequence of an already low GC content. B. subtilis and B. halodurans, on the other hand, have a wider GC3 range in the
subsets of high-cT2 genes relative to the rest of the A genes. B.
subtilis has a significant overrepresentation of high-cT2 genes
in the GC-poor terminus region, which could be an effect of
either a higher recombination rate in this area [9] or local
nucleotide variations, or both.

which would support the notion that there are many candidates for lateral transfer in groups A and B. In B. subtilis and
B. halodurans, which appear to have diverged long ago, Pdev
in categories A and B is low, although still higher than in D.
The numbers of deviant genes in category A are 51 and 40 in
B. subtilis and B. halodurans respectively, similar in number
to those of, say, E. coli or S. typhi. Thus the rates of import
may be similar in magnitude and the low Pdev scores could be
due to category A containing a large number of older genes
that have either been ameliorated in Bacillus or lost in
Clostridium. The older the A group, the lower Pdev will be,
until it approaches the Pdev of category D. The comparison
between the Staphylococcus aureus strains mu50 and mw2
shows an intermediate pattern, with a relatively high Pdev in
categories A and B compared to category D. This would suggest that there is no great difference between the
proteobacteria and the Bacillus/Clostridium group in lateral
transfer patterns.

* The number of duplicated genes with cT2 > 38. See Materials and methods for species abbreviations.

In B. subtilis group D, there are a number of genes with high
cT2 and low GC3 around the ori region. These are most likely
not imports, as they have defined (and often ribosomal) functions and a high codon adaptation index (CAI) [20], indicating that there is translational selection on these genes. Genes
in group A around the terminus region also have high CAI,
but this is probably due to the fact that low GC3 coincides with
the choice of major codons in B. subtilis [21].
Comparing GC3 skews of category D in Figure 1, we note that
all Escherichia/Salmonella clade genomes are skewed
towards low GC3. This relationship could be due to one or
both of the following explanations: there may be local,
although small, regions that are biased towards lower GC3; or
it may suggest that there are a number of pervasive low-GC3
imports into the Escherichia/Salmonella clade.
Both E. coli and B. subtilis have distinct regions around the
terminus with low GC content [19,22]. This regional bias
around the terminus is not a general feature. The genome of
B. halodurans also has a low-GC region around the terminus,
although not as distinct as that of B. subtilis. The regional bias
of S. aureus mu50 is intermediate between B. halodurans
and B. subtilis, whereas Clostridium has no low-GC region
around the terminus.

Recent duplications
The fate of a recent duplication is selection or redundancy followed by deletion, with the vast majority of recent duplications being deleted [3]. In several organisms it was found that
the persistence of neutral material is extremely low. Few neutral paralogs survive long enough to undergo any significant
mutational degradation. In all cases considered we find that
the total number of duplications in the A groups are significantly overrepresented compared to category D (Table 6).

As a result of both stoichiometric and expression-level constraints on gene duplication, we expect the number of recent
duplications among genes that are either highly expressed or
involved in complex protein interactions to be low. While the
interaction level can be hard to assess, expression can be estimated from the codon bias [20]. In E. coli K12, we see that the
paralogs in category A are all hypothetical proteins with low
codon bias, CAI < 0.3. In category D, 33 of 47 recent duplications are hypothetical or putative genes, with a low average
CAI score. Two exceptions are the tuf copies. In E. coli
O157:H7, hypothetical genes dominate the duplications in
category A and none of the paralogs has a known function.
The duplications in category D of O157:H7 are similar to those
in category D of K12, with mostly hypothetical genes. S. typhimurium has only five recent duplications in category A, and
all are putative. In category D, we find 15 copies of a number
of ABC transporter-related genes, along with putative genes
and two tuf copies. C. acetobutylicum also follows this pattern, with mostly hypothetical genes, along with ABC transporters. In B. subtilis, all 16 duplications in category A are
hypothetical. Ten of sixteen have CAI scores lower than average. Genes are better defined in category D, with only 6 of 10
duplicated genes having CAI scores lower than average. S.
aureus mu50 has few recent paralogs in category D, and only
one is annotated as hypothetical. In category A, four out of six
are hypothetical. If duplication is mainly dependent on function, then it may in part explain the overrepresentation of
duplications in category A for almost all organisms. This category should contain the highest proportion of weakly functional or nonfunctional genes, which are less disruptive to
amplify.
In general, duplicated genes seem more likely to have high
cT2 scores. This correlation is dominated by the D category
(Table 4) where there is a higher proportion of deviant genes

likely to have taken place after transfer. Another possibility
could be a multiple and probably simultaneous import of the
same gene from a single source. It would be difficult to tell
this event apart from an indigenous duplication event.

Patterns of lateral transfer
The context bias (cT2) has been shown to be a useful measure
to identify recently imported genes [18,19]. This is further
corroborated in this study where the gene categories that are
expected to contain more recently imported genes always

among the duplications in all but three cases. This would suggest a general link between atypical sequences and
duplication, which may be due to unusual DNA sequences
such as transposon-like structures. Even though annotated
transposons have been removed from the datasets, some such
sequences may still persist. Furthermore, the overrepresentation could also be due to higher rates of recombination in certain chromosomal regions. Finally, it is possible that the
paralogs were imported as a cluster - the duplication therefore taking place before the transfer. This is not supported by
the chromosomal positions of paralogs in category A of the
paired organisms in Table 6, suggesting that duplication is

transferred genes dominate in this group. This is the kind of
distribution we would expect under the assumption that the
multitude of potential donors have a wide range of GC3 content. The distribution of GC3 content in category D is almost
always more peaked and has more weight in its tails, reflecting a non-Gaussian probability distribution. Among the
organisms with approximately 50% GC3 content, there is a
slight skew to low GC3. Furthermore, in the two organisms
with low genomic GC3 content, both categories A and D are
skewed slightly to higher GC3.

Whereas recent imports generally seem to have broad, nearly
uniform, GC3 distributions, there seem to be few genes with
high GC3 content. This is particularly evident in the genomes
with low overall GC3 content. Thus, the recent imports in the
Escherichia/Salmonella clade with intermediate overall GC3
content have broad tails to low GC3, but the low-GC3 genomes
have no corresponding tails to high GC3 (Figure 1). Either the
potential donors for these genomes are all of low GC3 content
or low-GC3 genes are more easily exchanged. E. coli has
regions in the genome with low GC3 content [19,22] as does B.
subtilis. Possibly such regions are more likely to accept
imports of similar GC content.

have a larger fraction of deviant genes (high cT2). The connection is strengthened further by the observation that the deviant genes have a broader and more uniform GC3 distribution
in keeping with the expectation that recent imports have not
had time to ameliorate to the genomic bias. Thus, the number
of recent imports in each genome can be assumed to be
related to the number of deviant genes in category A. The
absolute numbers of deviant genes in the A and B groups are
very similar for all genomes considered (Tables 2,3). A possible exception is S. aureus, which seems to have a lower
number of deviant genes in category A. This suggests that the
intensity of lateral transfer is roughly of the same magnitude
in all cases.

In the Escherichia/Salmonella clade, the chromosomal position of category A genes was studied. For E. coli K12 and S.
typhimurium, there is a tendency to have a high number of A
genes at gene position 2,000 to 3,000. E. coli O157:H7 has a
peak at 1,000 to 2,000. In general, there is no overrepresentation of potential laterally transferred genes in the immediate vicinity of the low-GC terminus region in contrast to
previous proposals [10,18].

Duplication bias
Genes that are likely to have been imported into the organism
from an outside source are also more likely to be duplicated.
This is the overall impression from studying bacteria both

As virtually all duplicated recent imports are annotated as
hypothetical or putative, it is not easy to suggest functions. It
is possible, and even likely, that some recent imports have
strong gene functions that are required in a new niche and
could be duplicated to provide an appropriate gene-dosage
effect. However, recent imports that have identifiable functions are rarely duplicated. Thus it seems reasonable to suggest that most of the duplicated genes among the recent
imports have poorly optimized functions and that the apparent bias for duplication is due to selection for gene dosage.
Nevertheless, we expect that most of these duplicated imports
are also transient, as are most other imports and other duplications. The main point is that neutral and near-neutral genes
have a limited persistence in the genome and that the pool of
weakly functional or nonfunctional genes is dominated by the
recent imports. This is where new functions seem most likely
to be discovered.

(2) Imported genes that are required in a new niche may be
needed in larger amounts until control of expression levels
has become established.

information

Although all genes or open reading frames (ORFs) annotated
as being transposon- or phage-related have been removed
from this analysis, the possibility always remains that some
such sequences remain that are as yet unrecognized. Therefore, explanation (1) cannot fully be ruled out. However, we
believe that explanation (3) is more pertinent from observations in category D, where duplication occurs more often
among genes with poorly understood function, and also from
previous observations [4] where we find that highly expressed
genes are less likely to be duplicated. This suggests that
amplification of a gene product with a weak function is

As a conservative estimate, under the assumption that novel
gene functions arise through modifying paralogs that are
retained through an amplification of primarily weak functions, we propose that at least a quarter of all gene-innovation
events are a direct consequence of lateral transfer. The estimate is conservative as there may be duplications in D that
are 'stuck' in the amplified function, such as elongation factor
and, possibly, ABC transporter genes. In any case, lateral
transfer in combination with duplication may have a considerable contribution to gene innovation. This contribution is
not always apparent when focusing solely on the transfer of
established gene functions.

interactions

(4) Genes may be imported in multiple copies into a genome.
Even though this is not an effect of the duplication mechanism of the new host, the multiple imports still act as if they
were actual paralogs, with the same restrictions. This explanation would be largely indistinguishable from the others.

refereed research

(3) Duplications are more likely to be retained or occur in
genes that are poorly optimized. Thus, amplification is more
likely to succeed in category A since there is a lower risk of
counter-selection and a greater chance of discovering a weak
but novel function.

If every duplication event has roughly the same chance of
being selected by amplifying a gene product, then the contribution of lateral transfer to gene innovation can be estimated.
Here we assume that the observed duplications are essentially
neutral or weakly selected, and that deleterious amplifications are quickly purged from the population. In E. coli K12
categories A and B, when compared to both E. coli O157:H7
and S. typhimurium, there are roughly half as many duplication events as in category D. In the corresponding S. typhimurium comparisons, a quarter of all duplications are in
category A or B. For the proteobacteria, E. coli O157:H7 tops
the list, with almost half of its recent duplications in category
A or B. In the Bacillus/Clostridium group, more than half of
all duplications are in these categories.

Lateral transfer and gene innovation

reports

from the proteobacteria group and from the Bacillus/
Clostridium clade, although the relation between cT2 scores
and propensity to duplicate is weaker in the latter group. This
observed bias may be due to the following:

generally less disruptive and costly than amplification of a
stronger gene product. If this is the case, the bias for duplications in category A need not be explained by areas of high
recombination or increased mobility, but simply by virtue of
a larger proportion of poorly optimized genes and gene functions among the potential imports.

Materials and methods
Genome data
A number of genomes were downloaded from GenBank, and
abbreviated as follows: Escherichia coli K12 (ecol) [23]; E.
coli O157:H7 EDL 933 (edl) [24]; Shigella flexneri (sflex)
[25]; Salmonella typhimurium (stym) [26]; S. typhi (styp)
[27]; Bacillus subtilis (bsub) [28]; B. halodurans (bhal) [29];
Clostridium perfringens (cper) [30]; C. acetobutylicum
(cace) [31]; Staphylococcus aureus strains mu50 (samu) [32]
and mw2 (samw) [33]; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (paer)
[34]. Furthermore, contigs from Klebsiella pneumoniae
(klebs), which is nearing completion, were downloaded from
the Genome Sequencing Center [35].
ORFs annotated as related to either transposons or phage
sequences were removed, because occurrences of these
sequences may prove confounding. Only genes longer than
400 nucleotides were considered, because of small-sample
effects when calculating cT2 scores (see below).
The bacteria studied here fall loosely into two clades: the
Bacillus/Clostridium and the Salmonella/Escherichia
clades. Although it is often difficult to produce good estimates
of bacterial divergence, 16s RNA trees (data not shown) suggest that the bacteria in the Salmonella/Escherichia clade
diverged much later than the bacteria in the Bacillus/
Clostridium clade, with the possible exception of the S.
aureus strains, which may be comparable to the Salmonella/
Escherichia clade.

Lateral transfer
As a measure of lateral transfer into various genomes, we use
a phylogenetic approach among a group of related bacteria.
For instance, as the divergence of Salmonella and
Escherichia is more recent than the divergence of their ancestor to Klebsiella and Pseudomonas, we assume that a gene
present only in Escherichia is a likely lateral transfer (gene
import) that occurred after the divergence of Salmonella and
Escherichia, or a transfer that occurred before divergence but
was subsequently lost in Salmonella. This category of genes
contains likely candidates for lateral transfer. As support, we
use a method developed to detect atypical nucleotide context
biases (cT2 [18,19]). As defined, this context bias is independent of the nucleotide usage of the gene considered and is
expected to reflect a mutation bias that deviates from the
average of the genome. The values of cT2 are low when genes
appear typical and high when they appear atypical. When a
foreign gene is first introduced, it may appear atypical
because it has been adapted to a different mutation bias. In
time it is expected to ameliorate and approach the context
bias of its new host.

and P. aeruginosa). There are four categories of genes that
are considered: A, B, C and D, according to Table 1 (compare
[18]). Category A is assumed to include very recent gene
imports, entering the genome after the last divergence. Category B is presumed to also include imports, although to a
lesser extent than category A, as there is the increased probability of genes being lost in the outlier genomes. Category C,
which is only briefly addressed in this study, is likely to be
composed of genes that have been lost in the paired genome
and retained in the others. Category D consists mainly of
genes that have been present for a long time and would
include imports only if they are very pervasive, that is, they
have been lost and reimported or imported several times.
As a threshold for determining presence or absence, we used
the blastx package [36], which gives six-frame translations of
nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence. An E-value of
less than 10-10 indicates presence in the studied genome. The
value was set to a relatively low level of significance because
of the highly varying degrees of divergence of the organisms
studied. Furthermore, we chose the same threshold for all
organisms, as any variable value would imply that the relative
ages of divergence were known.

Duplication
As a simple measure of recent duplications, genomes were
searched against themselves using blastn [36]. Genes that
could fulfill both a more stringent E-value of lower than 10-20
and a nucleotide identity of ≥ 95% were considered to be
recent duplications. There is always the possibility that such
genes are not recent paralogs, but highly conserved, through
gene conversion for instance. However, if these paralogs are
so highly conserved, they would more likely be found in categories C or D.
