Abstract
Background: Parasitic angiosperm Orobanche crenata infection represents a major constraint for
the cultivation of legumes worldwide. The level of protection achieved to date is either incomplete
or ephemeral. Hence, an efficient control of the parasite requires a better understanding of its
interaction and associated resistance mechanisms at molecular levels.
Results: In order to study the plant response to this parasitic plant and the molecular basis of the
resistance we have used a proteomic approach. The root proteome of two accessions of the model
legume Medicago truncatula displaying differences in their resistance phenotype, in control as well
as in inoculated plants, over two time points (21 and 25 days post infection), has been compared.
We report quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the 2-DE maps between early- (SA
27774) and late-resistant (SA 4087) genotypes after Coomassie and silver-staining: 69 differential
spots were observed between non-inoculated genotypes, and 42 and 25 spots for SA 4087 and SA
27774 non-inoculated and inoculated plants, respectively. In all, 49 differential spots were identified
by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) following MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Many of the
proteins showing significant differences between genotypes and after parasitic infection belong to
the functional category of defense and stress-related proteins. A number of spots correspond to
proteins with the same function, and might represent members of a multigenic family or posttranscriptional forms of the same protein.
Conclusion: The results obtained suggest the existence of a generic defense mechanism operating
during the early stages of infection and differing in both genotypes. The faster response to the
infection observed in the SA 27774 genotype might be due to the action of proteins targeted against
key elements needed for the parasite's successful infection, such as protease inhibitors. Our data
are discussed and compared with those previously obtained with pea [1] and transcriptomic
analysis of other plant-pathogen and plant-parasitic plant systems.

Background
Broomrapes (Orobanche spp.) are obligate root parasites
causing significant yield losses in many important crops
[2,3]. Specifically, crenata broomrape (Orobanche crenata)
is considered to be the major constraint for legume crops
in Mediterranean countries [4]. The best long-term strategy for limiting damage caused by O. crenata is the development of resistant crops, but only moderate to low levels
of incomplete resistance with a complex inheritance has
been identified in crop legumes so far. This has made
selection for resistance more difficult and has slowed
down the breeding process. The quantitative resistance
resulting from tedious selection procedures has resulted
in the release of faba bean cultivars with useful levels of
incomplete resistance, but this has not yet been achieved
for pea or lentil cultivars [4,5]. In order to obtain longterm effective resistance, several resistance elements
should be combined in one cultivar, and, consequently,
detailed knowledge of legume-O. crenata interaction and
of the mechanisms underlying resistance are prerequisites.
The Orobanche biological cycle comprises well-defined
steps. Upon germination, stimulated by specific root hostexuded chemical signals, broomrape seed develops a
small radicle that attaches itself to the host root and differentiates into a haustorium, the infective organ. After host
tissue penetration and connection to the vascular system,
the parasite begins to use the host resources, gradually
forming a nodule or tubercle, from which a shoot arises
and emerges from the soil to flower and produce seeds
[2,6]. Successful parasite establishment creates a strong
sink of nutrients and phothosyntates to the detriment of
the host [3].
Several resistance and prevention mechanisms have been
identified, one of the first lines of defense being the failure
of host roots to stimulate Orobanche seed germination [3]
and a number of studies have focused on identifying the
host signals that induce germination and appressorium
formation [7-9]. Subsequent resistance mechanisms will
act by blocking host tissue penetration and connection to
the vascular system. Among these are the typical plant
mechanisms of defense against pathogenic microorganisms, such as the induction of pathogenesis-related (PR)
proteins, peroxidases and phytoalexin biosynthetic
enzymes, callose deposition and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) accumulation [1,10-15]. Recent histological studies in legumes and sunflower have revealed that the
unsuccessful infection of Orobanche is the result of the
coordinate activation of several defense mechanisms during the early stages of the infection process. A physical barrier prevents the parasite from penetrating the host tissues,
by lignification of the host endodermis [16], and cell wall
strengthening by suberization, cross-linking and callose
deposition [15,17]. Simultaneously, the production and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/294

excretion of phytoalexins [13,17] and occlusion of host
xylem vessels by deposition of mucilage [16,18] will cause
the necrosis and death of the parasite tubercles before
their emergence.
The application of postgenomic tools has already provided significant clues to enhance our understanding of
plant responses to abiotic stresses, pathogen attack or
symbiotic interactions [19-23]. Gene expression changes
are being monitored in various systems either by macroarrays, microarrays or subtractive suppression hybridization
[19,24,25]. We have initiated a research project aimed at
studying O. crenata interactions in legumes using a proteomic approach. In a previous work we compared the
root proteome of two pea accessions differing in their susceptibility to O. crenata and reported the presence of
higher levels of defense- and stress-related proteins further
induced upon infection [1]. Furthermore, the decrease in
proteins of the carbohydrate metabolism upon inoculation of the susceptible genotype reflects the reorganization of metabolic fluxes in the infected tissues as a
consequence of the sink effect of the parasite on the host
plant. This study highlighted the usefulness of this
approach by providing the first clues to the plant's
response to the parasite and its resistance at the protein
levels. Nevertheless, the scant protein sequence information available for this crop in databases complicates the
analysis and prevents a more comprehensive one of the
proteome changes induced. Accordingly, we have chosen
Medicago truncatula as a more tractable biological system
to study changes in the legume root proteome in response
to O. crenata. This system will provide excellent opportunities to compare our results with the information generated from a number of projects directed at establishing the
root proteome of M. truncatula and the changes induced
upon pathogen infection [26,27] and symbiosis [28http://
30]http://www.noble.org/2dpage/search.asp,
www.expasy.ch/ch2d/2d-index.html; http://www.mtproteomics.com/.
To this end, based on recent investigations carried out to
assess the relative response of a collection of M. truncatula
accessions to Orobanche spp. [31,32], we selected two of
those displaying the most extreme differential responses
following O. crenata infection: SA 27744, displaying early
resistance, the parasite being halted at initial stages of the
infection, and SA 4087, the genotype with the highest levels of infection ever reported in this species, but which is
still quite resistant compared to susceptible pea, lentil or
faba bean genotypes due to late-resistance, in which
tubercles are formed and later become necrotic, preventing the emergence of most flowering shoots [31,33]. Here,
we present the subsequent comparative proteomic profiling carried out to link the differential responses to O. crenata observed to differences detected in root protein
expression. Root proteins from control and parasitized M.

truncatula SA 27774 and SA 4087 plants were visualized
by 2-DE and subsequent gel staining with Coomassie and
silver nitrate. We report changes in the 2-DE map between
both genotypes as well as in response to parasite infection.
Some of the differentially present proteins were identified
by MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses, and many of them
belonged to the functional category of defense and stressrelated proteins. The data presented in this paper suggest
that resistance to broomrape in M. truncatula could rely
on both a battery of general plant defense responses
against different stresses and some more specific
responses. In addition, the comparison of the present data
with previous proteomic data obtained in pea [1] and in
other systems allows a discussion about the common and
specific responses of species.

Results
O. crenata seed germination, attachment and nodule
formation
First, we conducted a Petri dish inoculation bioassay with
both genotypes, SA 27774 (early resistance) and SA 4087
(late resistance) [31] in order to define the infection process stages at which each host prevented parasitism and to
obtain a precise description of the defense response timing (additional file 1, Table 1). Germination of O. crenata
seeds started to be visible 14 days after inoculation, once
the conditioning period of ten days required for germination was completed. Twenty-one days after inoculation,
the average percentage of germinated seeds was similar for
SA 27774 and SA 4087 plants (44 and 48%) (additional
file 1, A–B, Table 1). At this time, only 2.2 and 12.8% of
the germinated seeds for SA 27774 and SA 4087, respectively, showed the radicle attached to the host root (additional file 1, A–D, Table 1). Nodules were only observed
25 days after inoculation in the SA 4087 genotype, the
average number being 5.6 (additional file 1, F–G;
Table 1).

In order to identify resistance mechanisms at critical
stages of the parasitization process, we analyzed the root
proteome of these M. truncatula genotypes in response to
O. crenata 21 dpi (complete resistance acting at early penetration stages in SA 27774) and 25 dpi (incomplete late

acting resistance mediated by necrosis of parasite tubercle
in SA 4087).
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry
analysis and protein identification
Proteins were extracted from healthy- and inoculatedroots of SA 27774 and SA 4087 plants 21 and 25 dpi and
resolved on 2-DE gels as previously described [1]. For each
of the conditions analyzed (genotypes, treatments and
sampling times), three replicates corresponding to independent protein extracts (biological replicates) were
done. Additionally, for each protein extract, two 2-DE gels
were performed, one to be stained with Coomassie and a
second one with silver. Table 2 summarizes the amount of
protein applied, number of spots resolved, differences
observed, and number of proteins identified for each dye
procedure used.

The protein profile was highly reproducible among replicates from the same genotype/treatment/sampling time.
Thus, the number of spots present in all replicates
(expressed as percentage of common spots between replicates) was between 78–94% and 80–85% for intra-replicates of silver and Coomassie gels, respectively, and
between 80–91% and 82–90% for the condition studied
of silver and Coomassie gels, respectively, the majority of
spots being within the 4–7 pH and 20–60 kDa Mr ranges.
The analysis across the three replicates of 2-DE maps of
the two genotype (SA 4087 vs. SA 27774), treatments
(control vs. inoculated), and sampling times (21 vs. 25
dpi) reveals qualitative (presence/absence) as well as
quantitative differences (see additional material: files 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
Spots showing a significant change in volume (P < 0.05,
Student's test, additional files 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; LSD test,
additional file 14) were selected for further analyses by
MALDI-TOF/TOF. Out of the 60 spot differences detected
in the Coomassie-stained gels, 25 reflect variations
between genotypes and 20 and 15 spots corresponded to
changes in response to infection with O. crenata in SA
4087 and SA 27774 plants, respectively (additional files 2,
3, 4, 8, 9, 10). Out of the 76 differences detected in silverstained gels, 44 spots differentiated genotypes, and 22 and

10 spots were found differentially represented between
non-inoculated and inoculated SA 4087 and SA 27774
plants, respectively, (additional files 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13).
Virtual 2-DE gels from silver and Coomassie stained gels
of M. truncatula root tissues displaying the differentially
represented spots for the different situations compared
are shown in Figure 1. In all, 31 differential spots were
observed in both staining methods (Figure 1). Depending
on the dye used, the number of stained spots spanned
between ca. 400 for Coomassie and ca. 800 for silver. Gel
analysis revealed that most spots from Coomassie-stained
gels corresponded to spots detected also with silver (Figure 1). Additionally, silver stained an extra set of spots not
detected by Coomassie. This is in agreement with previous
observations pointing towards the fact that the differences
observed in 2-DE pattern, in terms of the number of spots,
result mainly from differences in the sensitivity between
both dyes [34]. On the other hand, the comparison of
Coomassie-stained gels reveals clear differences not
observed in silver-stained gels. This intriguing result is
likely to be linked to the large differences in the dynamic
range between both dyes [34]. Interestingly, some of the
spots differentially expressed 21 dpi for each of the situations compared (genotypes and treatments) seemed to
correspond to the same proteins showing changes at 25
dpi, as deduced from their similar pI and Mr values (additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), i.e. spots
106 and 34 differentially expressed at 21 dpi were found
at 25 dpi as spots 121 and 44, respectively.
Out of the 136 differential spots analyzed from silver- and
Coomassie-stained gels, 49 were identified by searching in
the M. truncatula EST database and the SwissProt databases. The proteins identified are listed in additional file
15, including the number of peptides that hit the protein
and the sequence coverage, as an indication of the confidence in their identification. In most cases, similar exper-

imental and theoretical Mr/pI values were obtained,
except for those spots identified by homology with
sequences from a different organism. The identity of these
spots was further confirmed by peptide fragmentation
and MS/MS analysis (additional file 15). Only 9 of the differential spots analyzed did not match all the confidence
identity requirements, and are indicated in additional file
15. A number of proteins were represented by more than
one spot with slightly different Mr and pI values, suggesting that these changes in the proteome can be attributed
to post-transcriptional modification, different members
of the same functional family (small shift in the pI), or
degradation products (significant differences between
theoretical and observed Mr values). For example, spots
52, 53 and 54 were identified as being different forms of
proteinase inhibitor .TC102534, each displaying slight
differences in pI and Mr values and could probably reflect
some PTMs occurring in vivo or be the consequence of
artefactual modifications such as deamidation in the proteins during sample preparation and processing. Furthermore, several spots identified in this work corresponded
to proteins encoded by different members of a gene family, i.e. spots 63, 114, 127, 129 and 134, representing
members of the functional family of trypsin inhibitors;
and spots 1, 2, 27, 28, 39, 40 and 69 were identified as chitinases. The differential expression of genes belonging to
the same family has already been shown for plant genes
belonging to chitinase [35] and trypsin inhibitors [36].
Protein differences between SA 27774 and SA 4087
genotypes
We selected a total of 69 spots differentiating genotypes
(additional files 2, 5, 8, 11). It is interesting to note that
for both lines the number of proteins showing variations
was greater when comparing genotypes than upon parasite infection. 35 spots were only detected or observed in
larger amounts in non-inoculated SA 4087 plants, while

10, 11, 12, 13). Spots assigned to more than one number, correspond to differences observed in more than one of the conditions compared. Molecular mass (on the left) and pI (on the top) were calculated using the PD-Quest software and standard
molecular weight markers. Spots commonly observed in both staining methods display a subscript lowercase letter: the same

34 were more abundant in SA 27774 plants. Quantitative
data for differential protein spots classified in this group
are presented in additional material (additional files 8,
11).
After PMF analysis, 22 spots could be identified (additional file 15), corresponding to 19 unique proteins.
Among the identified spots most represented in SA 4087
plants were typical pathogen defense-related proteins: chitinase (TC106842, representing spots 1 and 2), thaumatin-like protein PR-5b (TC94274, representing spots 4 and
6), cysteine protease (Q9STA4), beta VI allergen
(TC68012), one of the enzymes for phytoalexin production, chalcone-flavone isomerase (TC69564), aldehyde
reductase (TC59970) functionally related to the detoxification of xenobiotic stress, cyclophilin (Q8VX73, corresponding to spots 7 and 8) and proteasome subunit alpha
type-6 (O48551) involved in protein folding. Three proteins belonged to the transcription and translation category: translation initiation factor 5A-3 protein (P56335),
reverse
transcriptase-beet
retrotransposon-related
(Q2HTR5) and ribosomal protein small subunit 4
(Q6SEK7).
With regard to the proteins present in larger amounts in
SA 27774 plants, several proteins were identified, some of
them representing different members of the multigenic
families described above. Among the defense-related proteins were: a trypsin inhibitor (TC69848), chitinase
(TC68269), thaumatin-like, PR-related (TC59501), and
disease-resistant protein (Q8H816). In this group, also
identified were a glycine-rich protein (O22385) and proteins involved in protein folding and transcription: cyclophilin (MtD20401) and a putative retroelement pol
polyprotein (Q9SK57). Finally, protein TC72846 of an
unknown function was also most represented in roots of
non-inoculated SA 27774 plants.
Protein changes in response to O. crenata infection
Orobanche inoculation triggers significant alterations in
the 2-DE protein profile of roots from both M. truncatula
genotypes. Comparison of 2-DE gel images and quantitative data for the selected differential spots are presented in
additional material (additional files 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12,
13).

Notably, most of the changes triggered by parasitic infection correspond to an increase in proteins related to
defense responses. Thus, following parasitic infection of
SA 4087 plants, 15 out of the 42 differences observed
could be identified as corresponding to 11 unique proteins. Among the proteins showing an increase in intensity in response to infection, four were involved in defense
reactions: chitinase (TC106842), glutathione-S-transferase (TC59483), a well-known marker of stresses associated with the generation of ROS [37], the glycine-rich

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/294

RNA-binding protein (TC59317), generally related to cell
wall reinforcement and which has recently been involved
in the response of plants to pathogens [38,39], and a different isoform of the trypsin inhibitor previously identified (TC62239). Two additional spots were most
represented in inoculated SA 4087 plants, and were identified as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (O65735), which
catalyzes one of the reactions of the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathways, and a guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-like protein (O24076) which is involved
in a variety of cell processes including protein synthesis,
protein and vesicle trafficking, cell differentiation and
proliferation, and signal transduction.
Nine spots decreased in intensity upon inoculation in SA
4087 and corresponded to 8 proteins. Five of them are
defense-related and belong to the gene families described
above: chitinase (TC106842, spots 27, 28 and 40), and a
glycoside hydrolase (Q2HU16), which has been previously described. A proteasome subunit alpha type 7
(Q9SXU1), and a TH65-like protein (Q949J3) involved in
turnover and signaling processes and a kinesin motor protein (Q2QMU6) were also identified. Two hits, a TBPbinding protein (Q8H2U2, spot 33) and Q94LH93 (spot
29) must be considered with caution as they do not fulfill
the requirements for identity confidence (additional file
15).
For the SA 27774 genotype, 12 of the differentially
expressed spots after infection were identified as corresponding to 10 unique proteins. Three of the proteins
detected in larger amounts in inoculated roots were identified as a proteinase inhibitor (.TC102534 spots 52, 53
and 54), three different members of the trypsin inhibitor
functional family (TC69848, MtC00300 and TC69291),
which have been previously involved in pathogenic and
symbiotic interactions. Finally, a protein with an
unknown function increased in inoculated plants
(A2ZEG4).
A glycine-rich RNA binding protein (Q9SP10) was
detected in smaller amounts in inoculated roots and, a
protein with an unknown function was detected in noninoculated plants (Q9SH68). Finally, another four proteins that changed in roots of SA 27774 plants after inoculation were identified but need to be treated with
caution:
a
putative
transaldolase
(Q5JK10),
OSJNBa0056L23.24 (Q7XL33), a copy-type reverse transcriptase-like protein (Q9M197) and a hypothetical protein (A2ZEG4).
Protease inhibitor activity
The identification of several spots as members of the
trypsin inhibitor family, promoted us to investigate protease inhibitor activity during the interaction. For that, we
used the method developed by Segarra et al. [40] and

described in M&M to directly visualize protease activity in
gel. Proteins from root tissue of both genotypes, and from
control and infected plants were separated in 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE slabs containing 0.1% gelatine. Gels
were then incubated in the presence of trypsin (40 mg ml1) and, after Coomassie staining, blue stained bands
revealed a protease inhibitor activity. When denaturing
conditions were used (boiling the sample and using
reducing agents) a unique 21 kDa band was observed
(Figure 2A). However, two bands with different molecular
weights (21 and 66 kDa) appeared when native conditions were used (Figure 2B). This makes sense considering
that trypsin inhibitors have two subunits, as previously
described in Segarra et al. [40]. Quantitative differences
were observed for the 21 kDa band corresponding to the
denatured small subunit, this being more intense in inoculated plants from both genotypes at 21 dpi.

identification based on homology with sequences from
different species, which is considered uncertain and
should therefore be interpreted with care [41,42]. These
identifications were only considered to be reliable after a
further MS/MS analysis of the fragmented peptides (additional file 15). Accordingly, those spots that are indicated
in additional file 15 will not be discussed any further.

Discussion

Proteins were assigned to functional categories (additional file 15) based on sequence homology or annotated
function. These classifications are predictive and we have
emphasized below if the protein function has been experimentally validated. From the functional clustering of the
proteins identified for each of the situations, a clear trend
emerges: most of the identified proteins are typical pathogenesis-related proteins induced during defenseresponses against a broad range of microorganisms, or
they belong to functional families involved in a number
of stress- responses. Important intercellular communication processes, especially those associated with defense
and development, occur in the plant apoplast. Secreted
proteins (collectively called the secretome) are involved in
pathogenic stresses, environmental stresses, cell-cell recognition, and development. To enter the secretory pathway via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it is necessary for
secreted proteins to have an N-terminal signal sequence.
Upon cleavage of the signal sequence, secreted proteins
are normally transferred to the Golgi before being released
into the extracellular space by vesicle fusion with the
plasma membrane [43]. Some of the proteins identified
in our work are predicted by SignalP to have an N-terminal signal sequence and thus to enter the ER-dependent
secretion pathway (additional file 15). These are chitinase, thaumatin-like protein PR, trypsin inhibitor, beta VI
allergen, glycoside hyrolase and glycine-rich RNA binding
protein among others. These proteins have been previously found in secretome of M. truncatula and soybean
plants [44-46,43], all of them being related to defense and
signaling.

In this work we gained a deeper insight into the molecular
basis of legume resistance to parasitic plants by analyzing
proteome changes in roots of two M. truncatula accessions
in response to O. crenata infection. In order to obtain a
more comprehensive analysis, we used accessions SA
27774 and SA 4087 halting O. crenata infection at different stages of the parasite cycle. In addition, considering
that gel imaging analysis represents a compromise
between the detection of minor spots and the limitation
of saturated abundant spots, we used two different staining procedures, Coomassie and silver nitrate. The different
sensitivity between both dyes, compatible with subsequent analysis by MS, led to the detection of a broad range
of spots belonging to more abundant and less abundant
proteins [34].
After gel image analysis across three replicates, those differences corresponding to proteins present in larger or
smaller amounts between genotypes or in response to
infection were selected for further MS analysis only if
proven to be statistically significant, as determined by Student's test (P < 0.05).
With regard to protein identification, about 57% of identified proteins corresponded to Medicago specific matches
(additional file 15). Only the legumes Cicer arietinum and
Glycine max were close phylogenetically to M. truncatula,
the others being species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa,
Ricinus communis and Solanum tuberosum) more distantly
related. For most spots, the values obtained for the standard parameters considered as being a proof of accurate
identification when using MS, such as the number of peptides hitting the sequence of the homologous protein,
score and percentage of sequence coverage together with
the values obtained for experimental Mr and pI values, in
good agreement with theoretical values, encourages confidence in their identification. This was not the case for

Concerning the success in their identification, it is interesting to mention that more proteins were identified from
gels stained with Coomassie, although the number of protein changes detected using silver dye was higher (Table
2). This is consistent with the difference in the amount of
proteins used for loading 2-DE gels depending on the dye
used afterwards, much smaller for silver-stained gels (100
mg) and the different dynamic range for each staining procedures [34].

A smaller group of proteins was involved in metabolic
functions, protein folding and turnover. Below, we discuss each functional group and the behavior pattern
observed for the conditions studied (genotypes and
response to infection).

non-denaturing conditions. Squares indicate a moderate
increase in the band intensity for both genotypes at 21 dpi,
and in both situations (denaturing-A and non-denaturing-B
conditions).

Defense-related proteins
Remarkably, the majority of proteins identified in this
study were related to defense, with most of them being
more represented in one of the two genotypes analyzed or
upon parasite infection. Among these are: several trypsin
inhibitors, proteases, chitinases, thaumatin-like PR-proteins, and glycine-rich RNA binding protein. Several cyclophilins, lately related to defense reactions in the
Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas system, were also identified in
the study and from more than one spot differing slightly
in its pI value. This supported the case for the presence of
different isoforms, and probably some PTMs, although
alternative processing at the mRNA level cannot be
excluded and could explain differences in Mr.
Trypsin inhibitors
A number of studies directed at studying global responses
of plants at the mRNA and protein levels reveal that
trypsin inhibitors are induced in response to a wide range

of abiotic and biotic stresses, as well as during symbiotic
interactions [47-49]. In addition, alteration in the expression of several trypsin inhibitors was reported in relation
to insect resistance in different plant systems through their
proteinase inhibitor activity, acting on key proteolytic
proteins from the invading organisms [36,50,51]. We
detected four proteins belonging to this functional group:
TC69848, only visible in 2-DE gels from early resistant SA
27774 plants and further over-represented during
response to parasite infection, MtC00300 and TC69291
increasing in these plants upon infection, and TC62239
increasing in roots of parasitized SA 4087 plants. This
behavior is consistent with these proteins acting against
Orobanche structural or metabolic components and stopping parasite development during the root penetration
attempt. Notably, proteinase inhibitor .TC102534 was
identified from three different spots displaying small differences in their pI values, probably corresponding to
PTMs. The general trend for this group of proteins is to
increase in roots of SA 27774 in response to O. crenata
infection. The relative position of these proteins on a real
gel is shown in Figure 3. These results are in good agreement with different members of the same gene family displaying differential expression patterns during a
biological response. This has been observed for genes
encoding chitinases and trypsin inhibitors during symbiotic and pathogenesis, respectively [35,36], and may
argue in favor of the hypothesis that different members of
this gene family play different roles in restricting O. crenata infection at different stages of the penetration process. It is well known that at early penetration stages
Orobanche spp. secretes enzymes like peroxidases and pectin methylesterases [52,53]. This secretion may change the
composition of host cell walls and middle lamellae, making them weaker and more vulnerable to the attack. Several isoforms of Kunitz trypsin inhibitors have been
recently identified in xylem sap and apoplast proteome of
Glycine max, being related with defense and signaling [45].
We can speculate that, in our system, different members of
the protease inhibitor family present in resistant host
plants actively responding to parasitisation, might target
proteolytic enzymes secreted by the parasite to break
through the physical barrier and reach the vascular cylinder, hence stopping parasite invasion. A recent study to
monitor gene expression in the same biological system
(M. truncatula accessions SA 27774 and SA 4087-O.crenata) has detected changes in the steady-state transcript
levels of several trypsin inhibitors (Dita MA, Die J, Román
B, Krajinski F, Kuster H, Moreno M, Cubero J, Rubiales D:
Gene expression profiling of Medicago truncatula roots in
response to the parasitic plant Orobanche crenata, submitted). These data further stress the implication of this functional group of enzymes in plant-parasitic plant
interaction and resistance.

To validate experimentally the protein function, the
trypsin inhibition activity of the samples was demonstrated by in-gel assay. On a SDS-PAGE zymograme, a
band of 21 kDa was observed for all the samples tested.
Furthermore, quantitative differences between control
and inoculated plants of both genotypes were observed at
21 dpi (Figure 2A). These results are in agreement with
those obtained from MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis, identifying three isoforms of trypsin inhibitor with a Mr of 21 kDa
(TC62239, TC69848, MtC00300) in SA 4087 and SA
27774 inoculated plants. Another band appeared (66
kDa) under non-denaturing conditions (Figure 2B). This
is consistent with previous data reported by Segarra et al.
[40] in wheat leaves apoplast, the most active form being
a 66 kDa oligomer. It is very likely that this native form of
the trypsin inhibitor was not identified in our 2-DE analysis due to the denaturing conditions used.
Chitinases and Thaumatin-like protein, PR-5
Plant chitinases belong to a gene family whose products
display different expression patterns in various M. truncatula tissues, and those correlate with different phenotypes
upon a number of stresses, including symbiotic and pathogenic interactions [35,54,55]. Two chitinases have been
found in both genotypes: TC68269 was observed in a
greater amount in healthy SA 27774 root tissues, six isoforms of TC106842 were unique to SA 4087 roots and
also decreased in intensity in response to O. crenata. To
our knowledge, O. crenata, like other Angiosperms, does
not contain chitin, and therefore, a specific role in resistance to Orobanche seems unlikely. Paradoxically, alterations in chitinases have also been detected and related to
resistance in two other studies covering molecular aspects
of plant-parasitic plant interactions: gene expression analysis conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana -O. ramosa system
[4] and a proteomic study of pea-O. crenata interaction
[1]. Nevertheless, the exact implication of chitinases during plant-parasitic plant interactions remains unclear.

Thaumatin-like proteins are typical pathogenesis-related
proteins with antifungal activity known to be involved in
various pathogenic and symbiotic interactions [35,54].
Analysis of their expression pattern in plants responding
to different stresses correlates with higher levels of tolerance and resistance [56,57]. We have identified two of
these PR proteins: TC94274 (spots 4 and 6) most represented in root tissue of SA 4027, and TC59501 in SA
27774 plants. The fact that all these proteins present
increased levels after O. crenata infection could indicate
that they belong to the general battery of defenses that
plants possess, and may eventually take part in defense
mechanisms against Orobanche upon parasite infection.
Glycine-rich and Glycosyl hydrolases proteins
Glycine-rich proteins are involved in cell wall modifications as they have a defensive role as physical barriers,

making the host cell more resistant to infection and penetration [38]. Notably, proteins belonging to this group
were represented by three different spots: O22385 most
represented in SA 27774, TC59317 and Q9SP10, which
were modified upon infection in SA 4087 and SA 27774
plants, respectively. Glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins
(GR-RBPs) are thought to play an important role in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. An increase
of protein in pea plants has been reported in response to
their infection with Peronospora viciae, providing evidence
of its role in the response of plants to pathogens [39]. We
can speculate that this protein could take an active part in
the defense response of the plant by making the host cell
more resistant to infection and penetration.
Glycoside hydrolase proteins are involved in the degradation of cell wall polysaccharides. Many studies have
revealed changes in cell walls which occur during cell division, expansion, and differentiation and in response to
environmental stresses: i.e. pathogens or mechanical
stress [58]. This protein (Q2HU16) was modified upon
infection in SA 4087 plants.
Beta VI allergen and Cysteine protease
Beta VI allergen TC68012 and cysteine protease Q9STA4
were detected at increased levels in healthy SA 4087 root
tissues. Members of the Beta VI allergen protein family,
which includes intracellular pathogenesis-related proteins, are involved in several defense reactions. They are
heavily induced under disease stress and senescence, and
some of them have been found to respond to external
stimuli related to pathogen defense such as salicylic acid
[59]. In addition, some beta allergens from soybean have
a remarkable, stable trypsin inhibitor activity, which
might be an essential feature for their roles as allergens
and to defend themselves from herbivores [60-63]. On
the other hand, plant cysteine proteases play a role in a
number of processes, such as a nutritional one in reserve
development and fruit ripening, degradation of storage

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:294

proteins in germinating seeds, proenzyme activation, and
defective protein degradation. Besides this, they have been
implicated in the defense against predators through the
degradation of exogenous proteins [64,65].
Chalcone-flavone isomerase
The chalcone-flavone isomerase (TC69564) was only
detected in roots of non-inoculated SA 4087 genotype.
This is the second enzyme of the flavonoid-isoflavonoid
pathways in legumes leading to phytoalexin production,
whose induction and accumulation is a typical defense
response associated with resistance in several plant systems and against a diverse range of attacking organisms
[13,66,67]. Biochemical and histological studies in several plant-parasitic plant interactions revealed that production and secretion of these toxic compounds are
responsible for parasite development arrest [13,17]. In
agreement with these data, several gene expression studies
have revealed the induction of the enzymes involved in
the phenylpropanoid pathway in response to Orobanche
infection [68]. In addition, transcriptomic analysis monitoring gene expression patterns of M. truncatula root tissue
in reponse to O. crenata has also identified genes involved
in this pathway (Dita MA, Die J, Román B, Krajinski F,
Kuster H, Moreno M, Cubero J, Rubiales D: Gene expression profiling of Medicago truncatula roots in response to
the parasitic plant Orobanche crenata, submitted). Even
though the identification of chalcone-flavone isomerase
in our analysis does not necessarily imply higher production of phytoalexins in SA 4087 plants, it is in harmony
with the key role of these secondary metabolites in parasite interaction and resistance.
Redox defense-related and signaling
Glutathione S-transferase (GST) TC59483, was found in
roots of SA4087 after infection. GSTs are ubiquitous proteins in plants that catalyse the addition of the tripeptide
glutathione to a number of electrophilic compounds and
constitute one of the primary defense mechanisms against
xenobiotics [69]. Members of this family have long been
used as stress markers, as their induction precedes the
accumulation of PR transcripts upon pathogen infection
and several other environmental stresses associated with
the generation of ROS [37,49,70,71]. In two recent studies, Jones et al. [72,73] reported the identification by 2-DE
electrophoresis of several Arabidopsis GSTs showing signs
of post-translational modifications in response to Pseudomonas infection and in relation to resistance. Members
of this family have also been targeted in several nondirected global analyses of plan-parasitic plant interactions using transcriptomic [24] and proteomic
approaches [1]. In our analysis, the identification of GST
could reflect its role in the control of the redox state of the
cell under oxidative stress conditions, due to parasite pen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/294

etration, and the shift in the pI value compared to the theoretical value may be due to the occurrence of some PTMs.
Aldose/aldehyde reductases are also considered to be
important factors for scavenging ROS and their toxic
products, generated as a consequence of environmental
stresses, which can cause cell damage. These enzymes
have been described for many organisms, including plants
[74]. This is the case of a stress-induced aldehyde reductase from alfalfa, whose ectopic expression in tobacco
resulted in tolerance to oxidative stress [75]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and accumulation are
involved in the interaction between plant and parasitic
plants and resistance [15]. As stated above, it is likely that
this aldehyde reductase TC59970 detected at higher levels
in roots of healthy SA 4087 plants could play a role in
detoxification during parasite infection in a similar way to
that reported for other stresses.
Cyclophilins
Two different cyclophilins were identified in our study:
Q8VX73 more abundant in SA 4087 plants, and
MtD20401, detected only in SA 27774. Cyclophilins,
members of the peptidyl propyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIase) family, are involved in protein folding by catalysing
the cis-trans isomerisation of proline imidic peptide
bonds in oligopeptides [76-78]. It is interesting to mention that two recent studies in Brassica [79] and Arabidopsis
[73,80] have reported the involvement of these proteins
in incompatible plant-pathogen interactions. Nevertheless, the functional implication of this protein during
Orobanche infection and resistance is a matter of speculation.
Proteins belonging to other functional groups
Two spots showing a significant increase in parasiteresponding plants correspond to metabolic enzymes.
Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (O65735), increase in
intensity in inoculated SA 4087 plants. This enzyme catalyses one of the reactions of the glycolytic/gluconeogenic
pathways, i.e. the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This protein was already found in our previous proteomic analysis of pea-Orobanche interaction [1], fructosebisphosphate aldolase as being most represented in
infected susceptible pea plants [1]. In addition, recent
studies investigating Brassica and pea response to fungal
infections at the proteome level report the identification
of key enzymes of the photosynthesis, and the resistant
genotype's sugar metabolisms were observed to be elevated upon pathogen infection [79,81]. We can speculate
that the identification of this enzyme in larger amounts in
inoculated SA 4087 plants could imply an increased
catabolism in the host root plant to compensate for the
cost of resistance [81,82].

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:294

Other proteins identified in this work correspond to different functional groups and their relation to plant
responses to parasitic plants is unclear. These include:
proteasome subunit alpha type 6 (O48551), present in SA
4087 genotype and proteasome subunit alpha type 7
(Q9SXU1), decreasing in inoculated plants of this genotype. These proteins take part in degradation processes of
targeted proteins during a number of cell processes, for
example in proteolysis and signaling pathways [83,84].
Recently, the proteoasome activity has been correlated
with the activation of plant defense reactions [85].
A guanine nucleotide-binding subunit beta-like protein
(O24076) was identified in larger amounts in inoculated
SA 4087 plants. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated
the involvement of G proteins in abscisic acid (ABA) and
brassinosteroid sensitivity during seed germination and
early plant development, stomatal regulation, D-Glc signaling, light perception, rosette leaf, flower, and silique
development, plant defense against necrotrophic fungi
and auxin signaling in roots [86].
A general model can be given about proteins found in
both genotypes. Defense-and stress-related proteins have
been constitutively identified in both genotypes, being
many of them predicted to be secreted. However the late
resistant genotype (SA 4087) displays a constitutively
higher content of proteins of a general response, such as
chitinase, cysteine protease, chalcone-flavone isomerase,
aldehyde reductase, beta-VI allergen, some of them being
previously reported in pea-broomrape interaction [1].
These proteins are part of the typical defense responses
induced in response to the attack by a broad range of
organisms. In addition, some of these proteins were
found to be at higher levels following the parasite infection. This is the case of chitinase and glutathione S-transferase, the latter being related to several environmental
stresses associated with the generation of ROS.
Furthermore, the early resistant genotype (SA 27774)
seems to have a more targeted response. In addition to
some of the proteins mentioned above, several members
of the protease inhibitors family were found to be overrepresented, including many trypsin inhibitors, especially
in inoculated plants. These results support the implication
of these proteins in the early plant response against infection through the secretion of a battery of proteins belonging to this family, which would inhibit the action of
proteolytic enzymes secreted by the parasite. However,
experiments with soluble secretome and apoplastic proteins are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Conclusion
In recent years, proteomic tools have emerged as a powerful complement to transcriptomic approaches to studying
the function and regulation of genes and their products.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/294

We have accomplished a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass
spectrometry analysis to compare the protein changes in
roots of two M. truncatula accessions displaying different
resistant phenotypes, in the hope of contributing to a better understanding of the molecular basis of this plant-parasitic plant interaction and those underlying resistance in
legumes. Irrespective of the parasite inoculation, most
protein differences were detected between the root protein extracts of the two genotypes, among which several
proteins known to be related to biotic and abiotic stresses
were identified. Upon O. crenata inoculation, alterations
in the proteome corresponded to a general increase in the
amounts of proteins belonging to the defense-related category, such as proteinase inhibitors, PRs, cell walls modifying, ROS detoxifying enzymes, and enzymes involved in
the synthesis of secondary metabolites. The molecular
data presented here are in agreement with results obtained
for plant-parasitic plant interaction in other systems using
proteomics, transcriptomic, biochemical and histological
analysis. Moreover, our proteome data correlate with
some of the changes detected in the steady-state levels of
the transcript from a transcriptomic analysis of exactly the
same system and makes sense in the overall context of our
system. We have focused on trypsin inhibitor proteins,
which, together with the protease inhibitor, have been
widely identified in this work, showing majority changes
at 21 dpi. Complementary assays have been performed to
validate these results. Gel-trypsin inhibition activity confirmed the results previously obtained by mass spectrometry analysis.
The data presented in this work suggest the existence of a
generic defense mechanism operating during the early
stages of infection, including reinforcement of host cells
and the creation of toxic environment for the parasite.
We propose that in SA 27774 a different early mechanism
of defense might be operating to the one that takes place
in SA 4087. This early defense would depend on proteins
targeting key elements for O. crenata infection, such as
members of the protease inhibitor family, preventing host
tissue penetration and connection to the vascular system.
The identification of the elements involved in defense
during this interaction could be of crucial importance in
helping and directing programs aimed at improving new
crop varieties by means of plant breeding and biotechnology. Global monitoring analysis such as this provides an
excellent source for candidate elements involved in resistance mechanisms. Nevertheless, it is important to bear in
mind that the functional characterization and implication
of these proteins in actively responding to parasite infection need to be further validated by means of reverse
genetics, using T-DNA or TILLING mutant collections currently established for different legume species.

Methods
Plant material, growth conditions and inoculation
Two Medicago truncatula genotypes, SA 27774 and SA
4087, kindly provided by the Australian Medicago
Genetic Resource Centre (SARDI), were used. They were
selected on the basis of differences in behavior against
Orobanche crenata, SA 27774 being very resistant based on
early-acting resistance mechanisms [31], and SA 4087 the
most susceptible genotype identified so far [32] but still
having a high degree of late-acting resistance [31] (additional file 16).

O. crenata seeds were collected from infected pea fields
and stored in darkness at room temperature in a desiccator. The viability of Orobanche seeds was determined by
the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride test [87]. A germination test with the stimulant GR-24, a synthetic analogue
of strigolactone, was performed as reported previously
[88], the in vitro percentage of germination being about
60%.
M. truncatula seeds were mechanically scarified and stratified at 8°C for two days to induce germination, and then
germinated at 20°C in darkness. Germinated seeds were
individually grown in 12 × 12 cm Petri dishes filled with
perlite and covered with glass fibre filter paper [89]. The
dishes were placed vertically in trays containing Hoagland
solution to supply the plants with water and nutrients.
The trays were kept in a growth chamber under the following conditions: 20 ± 2°C temperature, 12 h photoperiod
(275 mmol m-2 s-1 light intensity) and 80% relative humidity.
Fifteen-day old M. truncatula plants were inoculated by
spreading 50 mg of Orobanche seeds along the roots,
resulting in about 115 seeds/cm2. O. crenata seeds were
previously sterilized by immersing them in 0.5% formalin
(1% Tween-20) for 140 min. Infection was monitored
daily in 10 plants of each genotype under a dissecting
microscope at 30× magnification. O. crenata seed germination and attachment were observed and quantified 21
days after inoculation, while nodules were observed and
counted 4 days later. Four hundred Orobanche seeds, close
(< 3 mm) to the M. truncatula roots, were visualized in
each Petri dish, to determine the percentage of germination and contact established with the host roots. Seeds
with an emerged radicle were scored as germinated and
radicles contacting a host root were recorded as attached.
Root tissues were sampled at 21 and 25 days post-infection based on the microscope observations showing that
differences between genotypes were observed at the point
between Orobanche attachment (21 days post-inoculation) and nodule formation (25 days post-infection).
Three plants per sample (genotype, treatment and sampling time) were collected for root protein extractions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/294

Plants were taken from the Petri dish and abundantly
washed with water in order to remove all Orobanche seeds
and non-attached radicles. Nodules, if present, were also
removed. Roots were cut at the crown, abundantly washed
with water, dried with filter paper, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized prior protein extraction.
Protein extraction and two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis
Proteins from lyophilized root tissues corresponding to 3
plants (0.8–1.8 g root fresh weight) were phenol-extracted
and re-suspended according to Dumas-Gaudot et al. [90].
Protein content in the supernatant was quantified by the
Bradford method, as reported by Ramagli and Rodriguez
[91], using BSA as a standard. Samples were stored at 20°C before electrophoresis.

Precast 18 cm non-linear pH 3–10 (BioRad) were rehydrated for 16 h with 500 mg of proteins (for Coomassiestained gels), or with 100 mg of proteins (for silver-stained
gels) in 350 ml of rehydration buffer containing 8 M urea,
2% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mM DTT, 2% (v/v) IPG Buffer pH
3–10 and bromophenol blue. Electrofocusing was performed using the Protean IEF Cell system (BioRad) as previously described [1]. After isoelectric focusing, IPG strips
were equilibrated according to Görg et al. [92]. Strips were
then transferred onto vertical slab 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresis was run as described by
Castillejo et al. [1].
Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250
(BioRad) [42] and silver compatible with MS [93]. Gel
images were obtained by a SHARP JX-330 scanner and
GS800 densitometer (BioRad), and analyzed with the PDQuest™ software (BioRad), using a 10-fold over background as minimum criteria for spot presence/absence.
Normalized spot volumes (individual spot intensity/normalization factor, calculated for each gel based on total
quantity in valid spots) were determined for each spot,
and these values were used to designate the significant differentially-expressed spots. Only those spots that showed
statistically significant differences in intensity as calculated using Student's test (p < 0.05) were considered for
further analysis.
Mass spectrometry analysis and database searching
Protein spots were manually excised from gels. Spots from
Coomassie gels were washed with 100 ml of 50% acetonitrile/50 mM ammonium hydrocarbonate pH 8, while
spots from silver gels were washed with 50 ml of 15 mM
potassium hexacyanoferrate/50 mM sodium thiosulfate
[94]. Gel pieces were then dehydrated with acetonitrile
and vacuum dried. After rehydratation in 10 ml of 50 mM
ammonium hydrocarbonate pH 8, containing 0.5 mg of
porcine trypsin (Promega, France), samples were incubated overnight (16–18 h) at 37°C. Peptide fragments

from digested proteins were then crystallized with acyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix and subjected
to MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS (Applied Biosystems, Voyager DE
super STR) for peptide mass fingerprinting This instrument is equipped with N2 laser (337 nm, Laser of 20 Hz).
Samples were acquired in positive reflectron mode with a
delay of extraction time of 130 ns. The trypsin autodigestion peaks at 842.509 and 2211.104 were used for internal calibration. The most abundant peptide ions from
PMF were then subjected to a new fragmentation (MSMS),
providing information that can be used to determine the
sequence.
The PMF searches for proteins were performed using EST
and protein databases. In the first case, two clustered EST
M. truncatula databases available online http://medicago.toulouse.inra.fr/Mt/EST/DOC/MtB.html were used.
The first, named MtC, contained 6350 clusters defined
from three root EST libraries (24347 ESTs) from a Genoscope project http://www.cns.fr/. The clustering process
has been previously described by Journet et al. [95]. The
second, named MtD, was obtained using the same process
on the M. truncatula ESTs (approximately 226923 ESTs)
available at the Institute for Genomic Research http://
compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/
gimain.pl?gudb=medicago. It contained 21,400 clusters
defined from EST libraries corresponding to different M.
truncatula tissues. A combined search (MS + MSMS) with
the PMF (MS) together with data from MSMS fragmentation (up to 3 peptides per protein) was performed in a
protein database (SwissProt), using Mascot software
http://www.matrixscience.com within peptide masses
ranging from 700 to 4000 Da (additional file 15). For
peptide matching, a minimum of four peptides matches,
a maximum of one miscleavage, and peptide modifications by carbamidomethylcysteine and methionine oxidation were accepted. The maximum tolerance for peptide
mass matching was limited to 20 ppm. The confidence in
the peptide mass fingerprinting matches was based on the
score level and confirmed by the accurate overlapping of
the matched peptides with the major peaks of the mass
spectrum.
N-terminal signal sequences were determined using the
Signal P http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ program.
In-gel trypsin inhibition assays
Proteins from root tissue (1 g root fresh weight) were
extracted with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH7, 5% (w/v) PVPP,
and precipitated with methanol/chloroform protocol
[96]. Pellets were dissolved in sample buffer [97] to contain 1 mg protein ml-1. Analysis in SDS-PAGE slabs contain-

ing 0.1% gelatine and 10% acrylamide was performed as
described by Heussen and Dowdle [98]. Samples containing 20 mg were heated at 100°C for 3 min and then run on
slab gels 1 mm thick. After washing with 25 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0 containing 1% Triton X-100 and subsequently 10
mM CaCl2 to remove SDS, gels were incubated in 40 mg
ml-1 trypsin solution for 3 h at 37°C. Then they were
washed with distilled water and stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue. Blue-stained bands revealed a protease
inhibitor activity, while a transparent background indicated a complete proteolytic digestion of gelatine. For
analysis under non-denaturing conditions, 20 mg of protein were dissolved in sample buffer without reductors
and without heating.
