information

Conclusion: SAM-II is the only metabolite-binding riboswitch class identified so far that is not
found in Gram-positive bacteria, and its existence demonstrates that biological systems can use
multiple RNA structures to sense a single chemical compound. The two SAM riboswitches might
be 'RNA World' relics that were selectively retained in certain bacterial lineages or new motifs that
have emerged since the divergence of the major bacterial groups.

interactions

Results: We used comparative sequence analysis and structural probing to identify five RNA
elements (serC, speF, suhB, ybhL, and metA) that reside in the intergenic regions of Agrobacterium
tumefaciens and many other α-proteobacteria. One of these, the metA motif, is found upstream of
methionine biosynthesis genes and binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). This natural aptamer most
likely functions as a SAM riboswitch (SAM-II) with a consensus sequence and structure that is
distinct from the class of SAM riboswitches (SAM-I) predominantly found in Gram-positive
bacteria. The minimal functional SAM-II aptamer consists of fewer than 70 nucleotides, which form
a single stem and a pseudoknot. Despite its simple architecture and lower affinity for SAM, the
SAM-II aptamer strongly discriminates against related compounds.

Background: Riboswitches are RNA elements in the 5' untranslated leaders of bacterial mRNAs
that directly sense the levels of specific metabolites with a structurally conserved aptamer domain
to regulate expression of downstream genes. Riboswitches are most common in the genomes of
low GC Gram-positive bacteria (for example, Bacillus subtilis contains examples of all known
riboswitches), and some riboswitch classes seem to be restricted to this group.

Background

Riboswitches are structured RNA elements within the noncoding regions of some mRNAs that directly sense metabolites and regulate gene expression [1-4]. Riboswitches are
known that respond to a wide range of metabolites including
coenzymes [5-8], purines [9,10], amino acids [11,12], and a
sugar-phosphate compound [13]. Most riboswitches are
found within the 5' untranslated regions of bacterial mRNAs
that encode biosynthetic enzymes or metabolite transporters.
Ligand binding to the aptamer domain of a riboswitch stabilizes specific structural elements of an adjoining expression
platform, which modulates the expression of downstream
genes. The two most common types of expression platforms
control either the formation of intrinsic transcription terminators that abort mRNA synthesis or the formation of alternate structures that mask ribosome-binding sites to prevent
translation initiation.
Riboswitch aptamers have sequence and structural features
that are typical of functional RNAs. Each riboswitch class is
defined by a core of conserved base-paired elements and consensus nucleotides at specific positions interspersed with variable stems and loops. We have previously used comparative
sequence analysis of intergenic regions (IGRs) from 94
microbial genomes to identify conserved RNA motifs residing
upstream of functionally related genes in Bacillus subtilis that
are candidates for new riboswitches [14]. Two of these RNA
elements have subsequently proven to be novel riboswitch
classes. Candidate RNAs termed glmS and gcvT function as
glucosamine-6-phosphate dependent ribozymes [13] and
cooperative glycine riboswitches [12], respectively.
Most riboswitches reported previously are found predominantly in Gram-positive bacteria, and representatives of all
classes are present in B. subtilis. We speculated that other
groups of bacteria might harbor different noncoding RNA
domains, some of which could be novel riboswitches. We
report here five novel structured RNA elements that were
identified by focusing our comparative sequence analysis of
IGRs on α-proteobacterial genomes. One of the five newfound motifs from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, termed
metA, appears to function as a riboswitch that senses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). This SAM-II riboswitch class has a
consensus sequence and conserved structure that is distinct
from the SAM-I riboswitch reported previously [15-18]. Compared with SAM-I aptamers, SAM-II aptamers are smaller
and form a simpler secondary structure. However, the SAMII aptamer exhibits a level of molecular discrimination that is
similar to that observed for the SAM-I riboswitch. These findings demonstrate that biological systems use multiple RNA
motifs to sense the same chemical compound.

Results and discussion

Identification of novel RNA motifs in α-proteobacteria

We searched α-proteobacterial genomes for new riboswitches
and structured regulatory RNA elements by constructing a
database of sequence comparisons between IGRs from 116
complete microbial genomes [19] (See also [14] and Materials
and methods). We examined alignments and statistics from
this database for examples where a conserved sequence motif
occurred upstream of genes sharing a common function in
different organisms. This initial screen encountered some αproteobacterial sequence elements that had been previously
described, including an ilvB leader peptide [20] and long
repeat elements [21,22]. Other putative regulatory elements
were further evaluated for their potential to form RNA structures by creating a secondary structure model and iteratively
searching for additional matches. In the end, we identified
five motifs specific to α-proteobacteria that are likely to be
structured RNAs (Figure 1).
We experimentally corroborated our secondary structure
models for these conserved RNA elements using in-line probing [23]. In this assay, the extent of spontaneous cleavage at
each internucleotide linkage in an RNA molecule is determined by separating 5'-radiolabeled degradation products on
a polyacrylamide gel. RNA cleavage occurs most rapidly at
sites where nucleophilic attack by the 2' oxygen of a ribose
approaches an 'in-line' geometry with respect to the phosphorus atom and adjoining 5' oxygen leaving group. Typically,
linkages next to base-paired nucleotides in a structured RNA
are rigidly held in a conformation that does not permit the
formation of an in-line geometry, and therefore these sites
cleave slowly. In contrast, internucleotide linkages that are in
flexible regions of an RNA molecule occasionally sample an
in-line geometry and are cleaved more rapidly. Therefore,
regions with relatively low levels of degradation product in an
in-line probing gel typically correspond to base-paired or
other structured regions of an RNA.
Complete formatted sequence alignments, compilations of
downstream genes, consensus structures, and in-line probing
data for the five motifs are available (Additional data file 1).
Sequence alignments of each RNA motif are also provided in
Stockholm format (Additional data files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and have
been deposited in the Rfam database [24].

The serC element
The short serC RNA element (Rfam: RF00517) consists of two
conserved base-paired stems. Putative transcription start
sites associated with near-consensus upstream promoter elements directly precede all examples of this motif, and the
start codon for the serC gene is at most 11 nucleotides downstream of the final hairpin. This arrangement suggests that
formation of the final hairpin would repress translation by
sequestering the ribosome-binding site within the 3' side its
base-paired stem and GNRA tetraloop. In-line probing of an
RNA corresponding to nucleotides -46 to +11 relative to the

The extended speF element (Rfam: RF00518) is found
upstream of proteins classified into COG0019 in several αproteobacteria. Primary sequence conservation begins at the
5' end near a putative transcription start site and continues

interactions

The speF element

Although COG0019 encodes diaminopimelate decarboxylases (lysA) in other groups of bacteria, a phylogenetic tree of
protein sequences indicates that the genes downstream of
this motif are orthologs of B. subtilis speF, an ornithine decarboxylase enzyme that catalyzes one of the first steps in
polyamine biosynthesis. We have tested whether metabolites
related to this pathway bind directly to the A. tumefaciens
intergenic region and cause structural changes detectable by
in-line probing. There is no measurable binding of L-ornithine,
L-lysine,
meso-diaminopimelate,
putrescine,

refereed research

The serC motif is located upstream of an operon encoding
serine transaminase (SerC) and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (SerA) in many α-proteobacteria. Together, these
enzymes convert 3-phosphoglycerate into 3-phosphoserine
during the first two steps of serine biosynthesis. SerC can also
catalyze a related step in pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) biosynthesis involving a similar substrate. We have tested
whether L-serine, L-threonine, PLP, pyridoxal, pyridoxine,
pyridoxamine, or 4-pyridoxic acid are capable of directly
binding to the A. tumefaciens RNA. None of these compounds have any effect on RNA structure as judged by in-line
probing (data not shown). It is possible that an RNA-binding
protein could be responsible for sensing a relevant metabolite, binding to the relatively small serC element, and derepressing translation. The PyrR protein performs a similar
regulatory role for pyrimidine biosynthesis genes in B. subtilis [25].

into a base-paired stem that is topped with a large insertion
that can form a four-stem junction in some representatives.
Following this stem, a stretch of around 80 conserved nucleotides appears to fold into a long bulged stem-loop. This
model is tentatively supported by covariation at a few positions in the alignment, except for the outermost putative pairing elements where the sequence is absolutely conserved. The
model is also supported by in-line probing patterns for the
RNA corresponding to nucleotides -400 to +3 relative to the
speF translation start site in A. tumefaciens (GenBank:
NC_003305.1; nucleotides 205774 to 205372). There appear
to be further conserved blocks of sequence within the more
than 150 nucleotides remaining before the speF start codon,
but we were unable to assign secondary structures there with
much confidence.

cadaverine, or spermidine to the speF RNA construct used in
this study (data not shown).

The suhB element
The suhB element (Rfam: RF00519) was originally recognized upstream of one of nine A. tumefaciens ORFs, encoding
proteins with similarity to archeal fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases (COG0483). After more matches were found, it
became clear that this motif was most likely not a cis-acting
regulatory element for the suhB gene but was more likely to
be a small noncoding RNA that is transcribed from the opposite strand relative to the suhB gene. In this orientation, each
representative carries a putative promoter and intrinsic terminator flanking the conserved sequence domain. Further
searches for this motif revealed that multiple copies are
present in many α-proteobacterial genomes (for example,
five in Bradyrhizobium japonicum and four in Caulobacter
crescentus) and that it is not associated with specific neighboring genes. The only evolutionarily conserved secondary
structure in the suhB noncoding RNA, aside from the terminator stem, appears to be a short helix near its 5' end. In-line
probing of an RNA corresponding to a portion of one A. tumefaciens intergenic region containing this motif (GenBank:NC_003305.1; nucleotides 979721 to 979594) also
indicates that its characteristically conserved sequences
reside in unstructured regions, suggesting that this family
could be involved in some form of antisense gene regulation
or other noncoding RNA function [26].

The ybhL element
The ybhL RNA motif (Rfam: RF00520) appears to be
restricted to bacteria from the Rhizobiales. In-line probing
data from an RNA corresponding to nucleotides -139 to +21
relative to the translation start site of the ybhL gene in A.
tumefaciens (GenBank: NC_003304.1; nucleotides 2665399
to 2665558) indicate that this element folds into a doublybulged hairpin of around 60 nucleotides. Sequence covariation substantiates the formation of the outermost and innermost paired stems. A putative transcription start site is
located close to the beginning of the hairpin within a region
that appears highly conserved with our limited number of
sequence examples. This RNA motif always occurs upstream
of genes related to the Escherichia coli ybhL gene
(COG0670), a putative integral membrane protein. Because
the function of ybhL is not known, we were unable to formulate any hypotheses for the role of this RNA element.

The metA element
The metA RNA element (Rfam: RF00521) is found in a variety of α-proteobacteria, and there are even a few occurrences
in other proteobacterial lineages and the Bacteroides group.
This RNA was originally identified upstream of the metA gene
in A. tumefaciens, but was subsequently found preceding
other genes related to methionine and S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) biosynthesis. The RNA motif is compact with a single
stem (P1) and pseudoknot (P2) that are both exceptionally

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/8/R70

well supported by covariation among more than 70 representatives (Figure 2a). Usually a possible transcription start
site with near-consensus -35 and -10 promoter elements is
located a few nucleotides before the first nucleotide of P1.
Many representatives also contain putative intrinsic terminators between P2 and the downstream ORF. This transcription
terminator arrangement is characteristic of many known
riboswitches, and suggests that the metA RNA is a regulatory
element that functions as a genetic OFF switch [14]. In comparison, Gram-positive bacteria make extensive use of SAMsensing riboswitches (Figure 2b) to repress a similar collection of methionine biosynthesis genes when SAM becomes
abundant in the cell (Figure 2c), often with expression platforms that use transcription termination [15-18]. With consideration of these factors, we tested whether the simpler
metA motif also functions as a natural aptamer for SAM.

The metA element binds SAM
RNA constructs corresponding to nucleotides -230 to -75 relative to the translation start site of the A. tumefaciens metA
gene (GenBank: NC_003304.1; nucleotides 2703291 to
2703446) were prepared by in vitro transcription. The resulting 156-nucleotide RNA (termed 156 metA) contains the
majority of the intergenic region but excludes the proposed
terminator stem. In-line probing assays revealed that the 156
metA structure is greatly modulated in response to SAM concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 6 mM (Figure 3a). Mapping
spontaneous cleavage patterns onto the secondary structure
model for 156 metA (Figure 3b) reveals that all SAM-induced
changes occur within the conserved metA sequence element.
There are incidents of both increased and decreased rates of
spontaneous RNA cleavage, indicating that SAM does not
facilitate general RNA degradation. Rather, SAM associates
with 156 metA to induce a precise structure that stabilizes certain RNA regions and destabilizes others, as has been seen for
all riboswitches characterized previously. An apparent Kd
value of around 1 µM (Figure 3c) for the RNA-SAM complex
was determined by plotting the normalized fraction of RNA
cleaved in several regions against the logarithm of the SAM
concentration.
These results suggested that only the conserved core of this
RNA is necessary for SAM recognition. Indeed, a smaller 68nucleotide metA RNA (68 metA) encompassing only nucleotides -161 to -94 (GenBank: NC_003304.1; nucleotides
2703360 to 2703426) binds with an affinity of around 10 µM
and displays a similar change in its spontaneous cleavage pattern (data not shown). Using 68 metA, we examined the
importance of the formation of the pseudoknot stem (P2) for
SAM binding by making two variants (Figure 3b). One variant
carries disruptive mutations (M1: U132→C, C133→G) and
the other carries these mutations and the corresponding compensatory mutations (M2: M1, G94→C, A95→G). These
RNAs were subjected to in-line probing in the presence of 1
mM SAM (data not shown). Under these conditions, the

The metA element binds SAM. (a) In-line probing of 156 metA RNA from A. tumefaciens. 32P-labeled RNA (NR, no reaction) and products resulting from
partial digestion with nuclease T1 (T1), partial digestion with alkali (-OH), and spontaneous cleavage during a 40 h incubation in the presence of varying of
SAM concentrations (1 µM to 6 mM) were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Product bands corresponding to certain G residues
(generated by T1 digestion) and full length 156 metA RNA (Pre) are labeled. (b) Sequence and secondary structure model for A. tumefaciens metA RNA.
Sites of structural modulation for the 156 metA derived from in-line probing are circled with red, green and yellow representing reduced, increased, and
constant scission in the presence of SAM, respectively. (c) Dependence of spontaneous cleavage in various regions of 156 metA on the concentration of
SAM. Band intensities for the five regions (labeled 1-5) on the in-line probing gel in (a) were quantitated and normalized to the maximum modulation
observed. Data from each of these sites corresponds to an apparent Kd of around 1 µM (producing half maximal modulation of cleavage) when plotted
against the logarithm of the SAM concentration. Theoretical curves for single ligand binding at sites where cleavage increases (black) and decreases (gray)
with a Kd of 1 µM are shown for comparison.

to favor the RNA side of the membrane by 2.6-fold. A greater
shift was not observed because our [3H]SAM sample contained an appreciable amount of radiolabeled breakdown
products (see Materials and methods). If 125 µM of unlabeled
SAM or the related compound S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
(SAH) are subsequently added to similarly prepared setups,
only SAM is able to compete with the [3H]SAM and shift the
ratio of tritium back to 1. This result demonstrates that 156
metA strongly discriminates against the demethylated form
of SAM.

nation of the SAM-II aptamer against related metabolites
(Figure 4). No RNA structure modulation was seen in the
presence of 1 mM SAH, S-adenosyl-L-cysteine (SAC), or
methionine (Figure 4a). A more detailed molecular recognition study (Figure 4b,c) was conducted using a variety of
chemically synthesized SAM derivatives (see Materials and
methods) containing systematic single substitutions of functional groups that could potentially be recognized by the
SAM-II aptamer (compounds a-f). It is important to note that
the biologically active form of SAM used in our initial tests
has the (-) sulfonium configuration [30], while the chemically
synthesized compounds are racemic (±). Only two of these
compounds modulated the riboswitch structure at a concentration of 1 mM. Full titrations indicated that racemic SAM
(compound a) had a roughly twofold higher Kd than (-) SAM,
and the 3-deaza SAM analogue (compound e) bound with a
50-fold higher Kd.

The SAM-I riboswitch binds SAH and SAC around 100- and
around 10,000-fold poorer than SAM, respectively [17]. The

We have not investigated whether the 1-aza group of adenine
is required for binding, but it is possible that the WatsonCrick face of the adenine base is recognized by a canonical
base pair to an aptamer uridine, like that found in the adenine
riboswitch [10,31,32]. There are six uracil residues that are
absolutely conserved in putatively single-stranded regions of
the SAM-II riboswitch and therefore candidates for this interaction (Figure 2b). The molecular recognition determinants
for ligand binding by the SAM-II aptamer are depicted in Figure 4b.

refereed research

Molecular recognition characteristics of the SAM-II
aptamer

These analogue binding studies indicate that the SAM-II
aptamer creates a binding compartment that recognizes functional groups on the entire surface of SAM. SAM-II discriminates more than 1,000-fold against binding SAM analogues
lacking the ribose 2'- or 3'-hydroxyl groups and SAM analogues with single substitutions of the adenine 3-aza, 6amino, or 7-aza groups. A majority of this affinity loss probably comes from disrupting hydrogen bonds or electrostatic
interactions between the aptamer and metabolite, although
secondary consequences of the chemical changes, such as
altering the preferred ribose sugar pucker or purine ring electronic characteristics, may also contribute to the loss in affinity. Removal of either the carboxyl or amino group from the
methionyl moiety is similarly detrimental and might disrupt
hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions that the aptamer
might form with the amino acid zwitterion. Not surpisingly,
the aptamer also readily discriminates against the removal of
the S-methyl group that is critical for the function of SAM as
a coenzyme, probably due to the accompanying loss of positive charge on the sulfonium center. Finally, shortening the
methionine side chain by one methylene group prevents SAM
binding, most likely because it creates a distance constraint
that prevents the simultaneous recognition of the methionyl
and adenosyl moieties.

deposited research

The poorer affinity of the SAM-II aptamer does not necessarily mean that it would exhibit inferior in vivo genetic control
as a riboswitch. The physiological environments for these
riboswitches may be quite different since they operate in
divergent groups of bacteria. Furthermore, the kinetics of
transcription and ligand binding appear to be more important than equilibrium binding constants for determining
whether a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch triggers
transcription termination [28]. The Kd for the truncated
SAM-II aptamer examined in this study is roughly equal to
the SAM concentrations needed to trigger transcription termination by SAM-I riboswitches in vitro [15,17]. Furthermore, the affinity of the SAM-II RNA is probably more than
sufficient to sense SAM at biologically relevant concentrations. Endogenous SAM levels have been estimated to range
from roughly 30 µM to 200 µM in E. coli cells grown in rich
media [29]. Nevertheless, the ability of the SAM-II motif to
function as an efficient riboswitch might be compromised if it
were less capable of discriminating against metabolites with
structures similar to SAM than the SAM-I aptamer. Therefore, we investigated the molecular specificity of the SAM-II
riboswitch in more detail.

Corbino et al. R70.7

reports

The genomic distribution of the metA element and its function as a receptor for SAM are consistent with its proposed
function as a SAM riboswitch. SAM-II riboswitches found in
α-proteobacteria have a consensus sequence and secondary
structure that are distinct from SAM-I riboswitches found in
the Gram-positive bacteria. A SAM-I riboswitch (the 124 yitJ
aptamer from B. subtilis) has been shown to have a Kd for
SAM of ~4 nM [17]. In contrast, the minimized aptamer from
the A. tumefaciens SAM-II riboswitch upstream of metA has
a much poorer affinity for SAM (68 metA, Kd around 10 µM).
It has been shown that in vitro selected RNA aptamers that
have greater information content generally exhibit greater
ligand affinity [27]. The SAM-I and SAM-II aptamers follow
this general trend, as low-affinity SAM-II aptamers carry two
paired elements and only 24 nucleotides that are >80% conserved (Figure 2b). In comparison, SAM-I aptamers incorporate at least four paired stems and 54 conserved nucleotides.

Molecular recognition characteristics of SAM-II aptamers
Molecular recognition characteristics of SAM-II aptamers. (a) In-line probing of A. tumefaciens 156 metA RNA in the presence of 1 mM SAM, SAH, SAC,
and Met. See legend to Figure 3a for an explanation of the labels. (b) Chemical structures of SAM and a generalized SAM analogue. Arrows represent
possible hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions that could serve as points of recognition by the aptamer. Circled interactions were determined to
have strong (solid) or weak (dashed) contributions to binding affinity in singly substituted chemical analogues. Recognition of the N1 position of SAM was
not tested. (c) Apparent Kd values of SAM analogues for binding to 156 metA. Columns (n, X, Y, Z, R1, R2, R3) correspond to groups on the core structure
in (b). The S-methyl group (gray box) is not present for SAH and SAC.

SAM-II aptamer discriminates greater than 1,000-fold
against both these compounds, and therefore SAM-II appears
to be at least as sensitive to the presence of the S-methyl
group as SAM-I. Further binding studies with a panel of SAM
analogues modified at the sulfonium center indicate that
SAM-I tolerates these changes much better than SAM-II (Lim
J, Winkler WC, Nakamura S, Scott V, Breaker RR, unpublished data). We are unable to quantitate discriminations of
greater than 1,000-fold against analogues for SAM-II due to
its poorer overall Kd. However, our findings indicate that the
smaller size of the SAM-II aptamer does not prevent it from

attaining the same exquisite discrimination required for efficient genetic control that is exhibited by SAM-I riboswitches.

Conclusion

Although multiple RNA solutions to small-molecule binding
challenges are often found by in vitro selection (for example,
ATP aptamers; [33-35]), it is now apparent that nature also
exploits the structural diversity of RNA to employ multiple,
unique mRNA motifs to sense a single metabolite. The SAMII aptamer found primarily in α-proteobacteria has a much

Genome Biology 2005,

smaller conserved structure than the aptamer of the SAM-I
riboswitch from Gram-positive bacteria. Despite having an
overall lower affinity for SAM, the SAM-II aptamer appears to
be adapted for precise genetic control and discriminates
against closely related compounds at least as well as the SAMI aptamer.

In-line probing assays
RNA preparation, radiolabeling, and in-line probing assays
were performed essentially as previously described [23]. DNA
templates for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase
promoters were prepared by whole-cell PCR from A. tumefaciens strain GV2260, except for 68 metA RNA mutants M1
and M2 where overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides were
extended with reverse transcriptase. For each in-line probing
reaction, around 1 nM 5' 32P-RNA was incubated for 40-48 h
in a mixture of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 25°C), 20 mM
MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, and various compounds as indicated. All
compounds used for in-line probing were purchased from
Sigma. SAM analogues were prepared as diastereomeric mixtures by the reaction of S-adenosylhomocysteine derivatives
[46,47] and excess methyl iodide [48].

Equilibrium dialysis

deposited research

Assays were performed by adding 100 nM S-adenosyl-Lmethionine-(methyl-3H) to side 'a' and 10 µM metA RNA to
side 'b' of a DispoEquilibrium Biodialyser with a 5 kDa
MWCO (The Nest Group, Inc., Southboro, MA, USA) in 40
mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl, 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5 at 23°C).
The sample remaining on side 'a' of the chamber after 10 h of
incubation at 23°C was replaced with fresh buffer to increase
the final binding signal by preferentially removing non-interacting, radiolabeled metabolite breakdown products [5].
After a second 10 h incubation, the counts in each chamber
were recorded. Unlabeled SAM or SAH was added to a concentration of 125 µM in side 'a' and the counts were measured
again after a final 10 h incubation.

reports

SAM-II is the only known riboswitch that has not been found
in the genome of the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis. We
have also identified four other RNA motifs in A. tumefaciens
that appear to be restricted to other α-proteobacterial
genomes. Three of these are candidates for structured mRNA
elements, and they join a growing list of putative 'orphan'
RNA regulatory elements [14] that might respond to
unknown cellular effectors in bacteria. Regardless of the true
evolutionary provenance of riboswitches, it is likely that
nature employs an even wider diversity of metabolite sensing
mRNAs in modern organisms.

Corbino et al. R70.9

reviews

We see two main evolutionary scenarios that could explain
the modern phylogenetic distribution of the SAM-I and SAMII RNAs. SAM, a nucleotide-containing coenzyme, is thought
to be a relic of an ancient 'RNA World' when all life processes
were controlled primarily by RNA [36-40]. It is possible that
RNA World organisms utilized multiple different SAM
aptamers for regulatory purposes or as modules incorporated
into extinct ribozymes that utilized SAM as a cofactor.
According to this hypothesis, the current distribution of each
riboswitch might reflect the selective retention of individual
classes of SAM aptamers in the progenitors of different bacterial lineages. A second possibility is that the SAM riboswitches emerged more recently and that each aptamer
developed independently sometime after the main bacterial
lineages diverged billions of years ago [41]. Of course, a combination of ancient and more recent evolutionary events also
could account for the distribution of these and other riboswitch classes.

information

An updated version of the BLISS database [14,19] containing
the results of an all-versus-all BLAST comparison of IGRs
from 116 microbial genomes was used to manually examine
several α-proteobacterial genomes for conserved RNA
elements. The BLISS website displays alignments of homology between bacterial IGRs along with compilations of
sequence statistics, species distributions, and neighboring
gene function assignments from the COG database [42] in a
collaborative annotation environment. The updated version
of BLISS is available on the web [19]. Further matches to the
five motifs were found by iterative BLAST and filtered covariance model searches [43] of unfinished bacterial genomes
and environmental sequences [44]. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed with CLUSTALW [45] to clarify the specific functions of some genes assigned to ambiguous COGs.
