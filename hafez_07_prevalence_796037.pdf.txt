Abstract
Background: Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) is a novel single-stranded DNA virus that was
identified in patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of non-A-G type. Clinical significance of TTV
infection was analyzed in Egyptian hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The present study
attempted to clarify these issues in Egypt, particularly in Qaluobia governorate, a country known
for its high endemicity of liver disease and hepatotropic viruses.
Methods: TTV are determined in the serum of 60 samples obtained from HCC and liver cirrhosis
(LC) patients and 30 healthy individuals. TTV DNA is amplified by nested-PCR with TTV-specific
mixed primers derived from the conserved open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region followed by
digestion with restriction enzyme. Using the enzymes HaeIII, DraI, EcoRI and PstI, we are able to
distinguish between the four TTV genotypes.
Results: The positive rate of TTV detection was 46.7%, 40% and 36.7% among HCC, LC patients
and healthy individuals respectively. The more prevalence genotype was detected in the positive
serum samples was genotype 1 (35.7%) in HCC patients, (50%) in LC and (63.3%) in healthy
individuals, Genotype 5 (21.4%), (25.5%) and (18.2%) in HCC, LC and healthy individuals
respectively.
Discussion: This study indicates that TTV is commonly present in adult patients with HCC and
LC as well as healthy individuals. The most prevalence TTV genotype is genotype 1. It seems that
the infection neither contribute to the severity of liver disease no to the causation of HCC.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer but the third leading cause of cancer death in
the world. The major etiology of HCC/liver cancer in people is hepatitis B virus (HBV), followed by hepatitis C

virus infection (HCV). A small single-stranded DNA virus,
named TT virus (TTV), was discovered in Japan from
patients with non-A-G transfusion-acquired hepatitis [1].
Knowledge about novel hepatotropic virus TTV is growing
fast, but some fundamental aspects remain to be eluci-

dated. Its prevalence and clinical significance are being
assessed worldwide, however its relationship with aggravation and progression to severe liver disease and HCC
remain controversial. TTV DNA has been detected in
many healthy and the diversity of the strains of the virus
has been reported [2]. TTV DNA was detected in 12% of
healthy blood donors, although the serological prevalence of TTV infection in healthy blood donors was lower
than that in patients with fulminant or chronic cryptogenic liver diseases [3]. TTV infection was also investigated [4-7] in patients on maintenance hemodialysis
(HD), as they are assumed to be at risk of blood-borne
virus infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), because
of the repeated blood transfusion and the high frequency
of exposure to invasive techniques [8,9].
Analyses based on a phylogenetic tree constructed using
the open reading frame (ORF) 1 sequence of TTV, showed
that the virus could be classified into different genotypes.
At least four groups comprising 23 genotypes of TTV have
been identified [10,11]. In addition four new genotypes
have recently been identified and classified as TTV group
5 [12].
In Africa, HCV is reported to have very high prevalence in
many countries with the unique genotypes 4 and 5 [13].
In Egypt, where very high prevalence was reported in both
risky [14] and healthy [15] groups mostly with genotype
4 [16]. Moreover, in Egypt previous exposure to parenteral
antischistosomal therapy was considered as one of the
most important iatrogenic causes of HCV spread there
[17], and an unanswered question exists about how far
such an exposure affected transmission of other bloodborne and newly discovered viruses like TTV in this
unique community.

individual in a period from December 2004 to January
2006 and stored at -20°C until used. The mean age of the
patients ranged is 60.3, 53.2 and 38.7 years for HCC, LC
and healthy individuals respectively.
Virological investigations
Patients and control were examined for HBsAg (AdalitsItaly) and HCV-Ab (INNOGENATICS N.V. Belgium)
according to the manuscript.
Determination of TTV by PCR
1 – DNA extraction
The QIAamp DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN GmbH,
Hilden Germany) was employed for DNA extraction from
serum samples according to the manufacturer's instructions.

TTV sequences were amplified in hemi-nested PCR using
primers NG059, NG061, and NG063. The first round PCR
was carried out in 35 cycles consistent of 9 min at 96°C,
followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation for 30 s
at 94°C, annealing for 45 s at 60°C, and extension for 45
s
at
72°C,
with
the
sense
primers
5'ACAGACAGAGGAGAAGGCAACATG3' (nt 1920–1943,
NG059)
and
anti-sense
primer
5'CTGGCATTTTACCATTTCCAAAGTT3' (nt 2205–2180,
NG063). The second round of PCR was performed with
the sense primer 5'GGCAACATGTTATGGATAGACTGG3'
(nt 1935–1958, NG061) and the anti-sense primer
NG063 for 25 cycles, under the same conditions as used
for the first round of PCR. In each PCR assay, one negative
and two positive controls were tested together with the
serum samples. The amplification products 271 bp were
visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose
gel figure 1.

The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence
of TTV infection among Egyptian patients with LC and
HCC, and to detect its genotypes. The present study
attempted to clarify these issues in Egypt, particularly in
Qaluobia governorate, a country known for its high endemicity of liver disease and hepatotropic viruses. Also to
assess the impact of this virus on the severity of liver disease and its association with the development of HCC.

Materials and methods
The study was approved by ethical committee and
informed consents were obtained from all parents of each
patients participating in the study. This study included
ninety cases, 30 patients with HCC and 30 patients with
LC; they were selected from outpatient's clinic and inpatients of Benha university hospital. Both cases and control were subjected to full history, clinical examination
and investigations required for proper clinical diagnosis.
Serum samples were collected from patients and healthy

RFLP analysis
A new genotyping assay, based on RFLP analysis, was
developed. The alignment of sequences determined as
above revealed the presence of genotype-specific restriction sites, combinations of which determined each genotype as shown in figure 2. Restriction digestions were
carried out with 10 ul of the second round PCR products
for 15 min after adjustment with 10 U enzyme reaction
buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were carried out with 10 units of NdeI, PstI and
Hin1II (Fermentas, USA) at 37°C. The digested PCR products were electrophoresed on 3% agarose gels, stained
with ethidium bromide. The RFLP pattern was then evaluated under ultraviolet light.
Statistical analysis
For categorical variables differences between groups were
analyzed by using analysis of student t test for two groups'
comparison and chi square test for non parametric values.

Results
The present study is conducted on sixty patients classified
into two groups: group one includes thirty patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (25 males and 5
females) and the second group includes thirty patients
with liver cirrhosis (LC) (19 males and 11 females). They
selected from inpatients and outpatients' clinic of Benha
university hospital, and thirty healthy volunteers (18
males and 12 females) were collected from blood bank
and considered as control group. All Characteristic features of the different studied groups are shown in table 1.
TTV DNA was found in 26 out of the 60 subjects included
in this study (43.3%). Mean ages were similar in TTVinfected and uninfected subjects of the HCC, LC and the
control group. There is a significant different was observed
between male and female in different studies groups in
HCC 11/25(44%) in male, 3/5(60%) in female whereas
in LC 5/19(26.4%) male was infected compared to 7/

Discussion
TTV was first detected in subjects with post-transfusion
hepatitis and indicated as a possible an etiologic agent of
non A-non C hepatitis [1]. Although TTV DNA was found
at high concentrations in liver tissue and in serum of
patients with liver disease [3], several studies also reported
a high endemicity of infection in subjects with no evidence of hepatitis [18]. Therefore, the role of TTV as a
cause of liver disease is controversial. In this study, we
have evaluated the prevalence of serum TTV DNA and
their genotypes in relation to liver disease in two examples
HCC and LC patients as well as in volunteer blood donors
as control.
In this study, nucleic acids were extracted from a convenience sample comprising 60 serum samples collected
from HCC and LC patients and 30 control groups. We
detected an overall prevalence of TTV infection of 43.3%,
which is higher than previously reported prevalence in
patients with liver disease, in volunteer or commercial
blood donors and in high risk populations from Western
countries (1–13%) [18]. By contrast, our data are similar
to those reported in patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis in Japan, Taiwan and Thailand [3,19].
The use of a seminested PCR protocol gave estimates for
the prevalence of TTV infection of 46.7%, 36.7% and
41%. This value is lower those reported for Turkish (75%)
[20], Polish (78%) [21], Thailand (62%), Korea (53%)
and among nationals and non-nationals in United Arab
Emirates (40% and 89% respectively) and in a group of
137 Japanese subjects with no reported liver disease
(70%) [22-25]. Interestingly, in the present study, the rate
of TTV infection did not significantly differ between
patients with liver disease, with or without HCV infection,
and healthy blood donors. The high prevalence of TTV in
general population, may complicate linking TTV to
hepatic disease and other pathologic states [26]. This unusual feature among viruses aroused the proposal that TTV
might be a commensal virus or part of human microflora
[27]. Another major complication is the extreme hetero-

> 0.05

geneity of TTV genome, its divergent genogroups [1-5],
and genotypes [28] each of which possess distinct biologic
properties and pathogenic potentials [12,26].
A study even describes an overall prevalence of 94% in a
sample representative of the general population [29].
Such differences may be explained by the differences in
population sampling or in the choice of primers [18]. The
rate of TTV infection detected in blood donors in the
present study (36.7%) is considerably higher compared to
the results of other studies on Italian donors reporting
prevalences ranging from 18.6% to 22% [29,30], but
within the range reported by a French study [31]. This
could be due to the different populations analyzed.
TTV is characterized by an unusually high degree of
sequence variability compared to other DNA viruses and
several distinct TTV genotypes have been described
[3,19,28]. Genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 appear to be widely distributed throughout the world, whereas the prevalence of
other putative TTV genotypes has not been fully assessed
and might be geographically restricted [31-35].
Characterization of the genotypes of TTV circulating in
our study population was carried out by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Our analysis reveals
the existence of six different genotypes of TTV and G1
shows the highest distribution among patients in Qaluobia governorate. The RFLP of all TTV-DNA positive samples revealed that prevalent genotypes 1 was the most
frequently found 17/36 (47%), while 8/36 (22%) showed
genotypes 5. A similar epidemiological profile for TTV
genotypes has also been described for Italian subjects
[30,36].
In regard to TTV, the prevalence of G1 and G2 is very high
worldwide, and these are probably major genotypes of
TTV. The distribution of the major TTV genotypes, G1 and
G2, was not related to their geographic distribution. This
suggests that TTV, a single-stranded DNA virus, probably
spread all over the world a long time ago and coexisted

with humans for long without pathogenicity. Our data is
in accordance with others that G1 was the most common
genotype of TTV in Japan; however, it is still unclear
whether any correlation exists between the TTV genotypes
and their geographical distribution or pathogenicity. Genotype 6 has the lowest found, similarly Genotype 6 has
rarely found outside Japan, even in large surveys including
patients from different parts of the world [19] and its presence in Italy has been inferred by Maggi, [37], on the basis
of RFLP analysis.

As the distribution of the different TTV genotypes might
have potentially important clinical and epidemiological
implications, it is necessary to evaluate the association of
particular genotypes of TTV with the severity of liver diseases. However, our results show that no significant association could be identified between TTV genotypes and
either LC or HCC.
The pathogenic implications of TTV genomic heterogeneity are unknown. Available data showing low disease associations of TTV infection are derived from studies that
considered mostly patients infected with genotype 1. The
possibility that TTV genotypes may differ in their pathogenic potential cannot be excluded, since the prevalence
and clinical correlations of uncommon TTV genotypes
have not been explored so far. Analysis of each TTV genotype revealed that co-infection of TTV genotype 5 with
HCV is more frequent 66.7% in HCC, 100% in LC and
50% in control group, comparing to TTV genotype1 50%,
66.7% and 42% respectively. The multiple TTV-genotype
co-infections was not found, others did not find any relationship between liver diseases and TTV genotypes and
reported that TTV has several different genotypes as does
HCV, and so there probably are specific TTV genotypes
causing severe liver diseases or other diseases, although it
still remains unclear whether TTV is a direct cause of disease or not [19,28].
