Abstract
Background: Mutations in Nek1 (NIMA-Related Kinase 1) are causal in the murine models of
polycystic kidney disease kat and kat2J. The Neks are known as cell cycle kinases, but recent work
in protists has revealed that in addition to roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression, some
Neks also regulate cilia. In most cells, cilia are disassembled prior to mitosis and are regenerated
after cytokinesis. We propose that Neks participate in the coordination of ciliogenesis with cell
cycle progression. Mammalian Nek1 is a candidate for this activity because renal cysts form in
response to dysfunctional ciliary signalling.
Results: Here we report that over-expression of full-length mNek1 inhibited ciliogenesis without
disrupting centrosomes in the murine renal epithelial cell line IMCD3. In contrast, over-expression
of the kinase domain with its associated basic region, but without the acidic domain, caused loss of
centrosomes. As expected, these cells also failed to grow cilia. Both defective ciliogenesis in
response to too much mNek1 and disassembly of centrosomes in response to expression of the
kinase lacking the presumptive regulatory domain was abrogated by kinase-inactivating mutations
or by removal of the coiled-coil domain. We observed that kinase-inactive, C-terminal truncations
of mNek1 retaining the coiled-coil domain localized to the cilium, and we define a ciliary targeting
region within the coiled-coil domain.
Conclusion: Based on our data, we propose that Nek1 plays a role in centrosome integrity,
affecting both ciliogenesis and centrosome stability.

Background
NimA-R elated Kinase 1 (Nek1) is a member of the kinase
family sharing sequence identity to catalytic domain of
the essential Aspergillus nidulans gene nimA (Never In
Mitosis A; [1]). Mutations in Nek1 are causal in the
murine models of polycystic kidney disease kat and kat2J,
resulting in a recessive pleiotropic phenotype that
includes progressive cystic kidneys, male sterility, dwarfing, abnormal olfactory lobes, facial dysmorphism,
choroid plexus cysts, hydrocephalus, uremia and anemia

[2-4]. Although it has been suggested that Nek1 may play
roles in cell-cycle control, meiosis, gametogenesis, and in
the nervous system [1,5] the cellular function of Nek1 has
remained elusive.
The Neks are considered to be cell cycle kinases [6], but
some members of the family play additional roles in ciliary function. Our studies in Chlamydomonas revealed both
cell cycle and ciliary functions for two Neks: Fa2p plays a
role at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and is essential

for the deflagellation response [7,8], whereas Cnk2p is a
ciliary protein that participates in the assessment of cell
size prior to commitment to enter mitosis and plays a role
in regulation of flagellar length [9]. A survey of the Neks
encoded by the genomes of various organisms supported
our idea that the Nek family may have co-evolved with the
alternating use of centrioles as basal bodies and as the foci
of spindle poles [10]. These results lead us to speculate
that dual roles in ciliary and cell cycle regulation might be
a hallmark of the Nek family.
We recently completed a comprehensive phylogenetic
analysis of the Nek family across the eukaryotes and discovered that they are an ancient family [11]. Our analyses
suggest that six or seven different Neks were already
present in the ciliated unicellular organism that gave rise
to all of the eukaryotic lineages. The further observation
that Neks representative of each extant clade localize to
centrosomes and/or cilia supports our idea that the original expansion of the Neks was associated with dual roles
in the regulation of cilia and the cell cycle, possibly coordinating ciliogenesis with cell cycle progression [11].
Dual roles in cilia and cell cycle have not yet been demonstrated for any of the mammalian Neks.
There is some indication that the mammalian kinase,
Nek1 may subserve both roles. Aberrant ciliary signaling
and cell cycle regulation are both implicated in the etiology of renal cysts [12,13] and mutations in Nek1 are
causal for kidney cyst formation. Additionally, we have
previously localized Nek1 to centrosomes [14]. We thus
set out to explore the cellular activities of Nek1 in order to
further test our hypothesis about the dual roles of this
kinase family.
Here, we report that transient over-expression of mNek1
in the ciliated renal epithelial cell line IMCD3 results in
failure to assemble cilia. This effect depends upon the
kinase activity of Nek1. In contrast, expression of dominant negative forms of Nek1 caused disruption of centrosomes, as indicated by loss of γ-tubulin and centrin foci.
These disruptive effects require the coiled-coil domain of
Nek1, in addition to kinase activity. We show that the
coiled-coil domain of Nek1 is sufficient for nuclear, centrosomal and ciliary localization of the protein. We propose that Nek1 activity in differentiated kidney epithelial
cells contributes to the dynamic regulation of the centrosome and the primary cilium, a sensory apparatus critical
for the maintenance of tubules and in the prevention of
renal cytogenesis.

features of the primary structure of the protein.
Numbers indicate amino acid position in the primary
sequence of mNek1 (mRNA, AY850065; protein,
AAB23529). Major features include: N-terminal kinase
domain (light green, residues 1–258), a basic domain (pI =
10.21, light blue, residues 258–353), a coiled-coil domain
(light orange, residues 353–686) containing four coiled-coils
(red, CC1–CC4, residues indicated), a fifth coiled-coil in the
C-terminus (red, CC5), a predicted NLS (blue, residues 355–
378) and two predicted NESs (yellow, 764–774 and 1131–
1138). Although the full-length sequence of mNek1 has a
predicted isoelectric point of 5.45, the sequence can be
divided into a basic N-terminus (Basic Region, pI = 9.61, residues 1–686) and an acidic C-terminus (Acidic Region, pI =
4.33, residues 686–1203).

mentioned in this text. Using the isoelectric point function of Protein Calculator (created by Dr. Christopher
Putnam, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) we
observe that mNek1 can be conceptually divided into a
basic N-terminus (residues 1–686) and an acidic C-terminus (residues 687–1203). The N-terminal kinase domain
(residues 1–258) is 96% identical (98% similar) to
human Nek1. The coiled coils are predicted by COILS v2.2
[15] using a > 0.6 score in one of the three window lengths
(most of the coiled-coil is > 0.995 in at least one of the
windows, the > 0.6 score is used to define the boundaries). A single NLS at residues 355–378 of mNek1 is predicted by the nuclear localization signal prediction
program PredictNLS [16]. Two leucine-rich nuclear export
sequences (NESs), NES1 at aa 764–774 and NES2 at aa
1131–1138, are predicted by the nuclear export sequence
(NES) prediction program NetNES v1.1 [17].
Transfected constructs are first expressed prior to postmitotic ciliation
Entry of a transfected plasmid into the nucleus to gain
access to the transcription machinery is one of the critical
steps limiting exogenous gene expression [18]. Liposomemediated transient transfection is greatly enhanced by
events associated with mitosis [19,20], probably due to
the nuclear encapsulation of plasmid arising from the
breakdown and reformation of the nuclear envelope [21].
Two hours post-transfection with pEGFP, we observe that

~80% of IMCD3 cells expressing eGFP are adjacent to
another eGFP-expressing cell, often still connected by a
cytokinetic bridge (detected with an acetylated-tubulin
antibody; Figure 2A). We infer that under our experimental conditions, cells first express exogenous protein following mitosis. Thus, as previously reported by others,
recently-transfected cells expressing the exogenous protein represent a population having recently completed
mitosis.
Cells reabsorb their cilia prior to mitosis and regrow them
after mitosis (reviewed in [22]). If the only cells expressing
eGFP in the first few hours after transfection are those that
have recently completed mitosis, then we predicted that
the extent of ciliation of this population of cells will
increase with time, corresponding to post-division ciliogenesis. As expected, ciliation of eGFP-expressing cells
increases between 2 and 12 hours post-transfection (see
Figure 2B).

Transient over-expression of eGFP-mNek1 disrupts
ciliogenesis
Subcellular localization of transiently transfected mNek1
N-terminally tagged with eGFP matches previous reports
of localization of the endogenous mNek1 [14]. That is,
eGFP-mNek1 (green) localizes to foci adjacent to the γtubulin-rich centrosomes (red) and is excluded from the
nucleus (Figure 3A, B). We observe that IMCD3 cells
transfected with eGFP-mNek1 for 4, 8 or 24 hours lack the
primary cilium (Figure 3D, E) but retain γ-tubulin-rich
centrosomes (Figure 3A, D). In contrast, cells transfected
with eGFP alone are increasingly ciliated over 4, 8 and 24
hours (Figure 3C, E). These data indicate that over-expression of mNek1 inhibits ciliogenesis.

In order to determine whether inhibition of ciliogenesis
requires kinase activity, we generated the mutation K33R
in the invariant lysine residue within the ATP-binding
domain [23]. The cognate mutation inactivates kinase
function in Nek2 and Nek11 [24,25]. We refer to constructs containing this mutation as presumptive kinasedead. In contrast to cells expressing mNek1 with a lysine
at position 33, cells expressing mNek1 containing the
kinase-inactivating K33R mutation show no abnormal
phenotype (data not shown).
Deletion of the presumptive regulatory acidic domain
creates a dominant negative form of Nek1 which disrupts
centrosomes
Several kinases, such as FAK and Plk, are regulated in part
through inhibition of kinase activity by the C-terminal,
non-kinase domain of the protein [26,27]. The C-terminus of Nek1 can bind the N-terminal kinase domain [28],
and we sought to determine whether the acidic C-terminal
domain of mNek1 influenced the ability of overexpressed
eGFP-mNek1 to disrupt the primary cilium.

IMCD3 cells were transiently transfected with various
truncations of eGFP-tagged mNek1 and those expressing
eGFP were scored for the presence of centrosomes (γtubulin foci) and cilia (Table 1). Neither eGFP alone, nor
the eGFP-tagged kinase domain of mNek1 (residues 1–
258) affected centrosomes or cilia (Figures 3C and Table
1), but expression of the eGFP-tagged basic region (which
includes the kinase domain; residues 1–686) resulted in
the loss of centrosomes in a substantial proportion of cells
(Table 1). Given that the integrity of centrosomes is a prerequisite for ciliogenesis, it is not surprising that these
cells also lack cilia. Cells expressing an eGFP-N-terminal
mNek1 fusion protein (residues 1–352 only) retain their
γ-tubulin foci and their cilia, indicating that disruption of
centrosomes requires the coiled-coil domain present in
residues 353–686. With the exception of the kinase
domain alone these truncations localize to the nucleus, an
observation in accord with a previous report [29].

In order to determine which of the predicted coiled-coils
is necessary for the depletion of γ-tubulin foci, we
expressed a panel of eGFP-tagged, truncated mNek1 constructs that sequentially remove the four coiled-coils of
the coiled-coil domain. We observe that the constructs
containing both coiled-coils 1 and 2 (residues 1–510), the
first three coiled-coils (residues 1–599), and all four (residues 1–686) cause depletion of γ-tubulin foci, whereas
the constructs containing either none (residues 1–352), or
only the first coiled-coil (residues 1–407) fail to deplete γtubulin foci. These data suggest that the second coiled-coil
of mNek1 (possibly in combination with the first coiledcoil) is required for the depletion of γ-tubulin foci,

whereas the third and forth coiled-coils are not involved
in this activity.
In order to determine whether disruption of centrosomes
requires kinase activity, we generated the presumptive
kinase-dead K33R mutation in the various truncation constructs. In contrast to cells expressing truncated forms of
mNek1 with a lysine at position 33, cells expressing truncations of mNek1 containing the kinase-inactivating K33R
mutation retain their γ-tubulin foci and their cilia (Table
1). We conclude that kinase activity is required for disruption of centrosomes. In addition, these cells lacked foci of
the centrosomal components pericentrin, PCM1, BBS6

Quantification of the loss of γ-tubulin foci is based on examination of 100 transfected (green) cells from each of three independent experiments.
These were scored as either retaining or lacking detectable γ-tubulin foci. Shown is the average number of transfected cells that lack γ-tubulin foci,
plus or minus the standard deviation. Constructs containing at least the first two coiled-coils significantly reduce the number of transfected cells

and the targets of autoimmune serum M4491 (Figure 4,
and data not shown). This indicates that the effect represents the loss of pericentriolar material, and is not specifically limited to γ-tubulin.

γ-tubulin loss occurs rapidly after expression of mNek1 and
precedes centrin loss
To evaluate the kinetics of loss of the pericentriolar material of eGFP-mNek1 (1–686), we examined cells during

the first 12 hours post-transfection. In contrast to eGFPtransfected cells (Figure 5A), which displayed increasing
numbers of ciliated cells and retention of γ-tubulin foci,
eGFP-mNek1 (1–686) transfected cells (Figure 5B) lost
their γ-tubulin foci (and failed to assemble cilia) within
the first four hours post-transfection. Additionally, we
never observed a cell transfected with eGFP-mNek1 (1–
686) retain exactly one γ-tubulin focus during the first 12
hours post-transfection (Figure 5D). Because the loss of
detectable γ-tubulin foci occurs within a few hours, and
because we did not observe cells with only one γ-tubulin
focus, we infer that the loss of pericentriolar material is
not a consequence of defects in centriolar replication or
segregation of centrosomes during division.
In order to determine whether mNek1 affected the stability of the centrioles in addition to the pericentriolar proteins, we stained for centrin, a centriolar component that
localizes to the distal centriolar lumen [30]. During the
first 4- to 24-hours post transfection an increasing fraction
of cells transfected with myc-mNek1 (1–686) lack centrincontaining foci (Figure 6A, C), whereas cells transfected
with the presumptive kinase-dead construct myc-mNek1
(1–686, K33R) retain centrin foci (Figure 6B, D). Co-staining with γ-tubulin revealed instances of cells with centrin
foci devoid of γ-tubulin, but we never observed a cell that
retained γ-tubulin foci that lacked centrin (Figure 6C).
These observations indicate that γ-tubulin loss precedes
centrin loss. To determine whether gross detrimental
effects to the cytoskeleton precede loss of γ-tubulin, we
visualized cellular microtubules with an α-tubulin antibody. We did not observe changes in the microtubule network, even in cells that lack γ-tubulin foci (Figure 6E),
leading us to conclude that effects on the cytoskeleton did
not cause the loss of γ-tubulin foci.
We next asked whether the disruptive forms of mNek1
were triggering loss of centrosomes as a consequence of
causing activation of an apoptotic program. Using an antibody against cleaved-PARP as a marker for early apopto-

somes, respectively (Figure 8 and data not shown). These
data suggest that the disassembly of centrosomes induced
by kinase-active forms of mNek1 requires correct targeting
to these organelles.
Expression of a panel of constructs that encode fusion
proteins removing the four coiled-coils revealed that constructs containing coiled-coils 1 and 2 localize to the primary cilium (compare Figure 8C and 8D) whereas coiledcoils 3 and 4 are dispensable for localization to the primary cilium (compare Figure 8D–F). Furthermore, the
coiled-coil domain alone is sufficient for localization to
the primary cilium (Figure 8G).

focus, suggesting that loss is coincident.

sis, we determined that cells lost their γ-tubulin foci and
yet remained negative for cleaved-PARP (Figure 7A). Furthermore, cleaved-PARP positive cells are no more common in cultures transfected with disruptive constructs
than in cell transfected with non-disruptive mNek1 constructs (data not shown). We conclude that loss of γ-tubulin foci is not a consequence of apoptosis.
To evaluate whether transfected cells with compromised
centrosomes continue to progress through the cell cycle,
we co-stained with an antibody against PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), an accessory protein for
polymerase δ often used as a marker for cells in S phase
[31]. At 24 hours post-transfection with myc-mNek1 (1–
686), we observe that transfected cells lacking γ-tubulin
foci are negative for PCNA staining, whereas 10% of mycmNek1 (1–686, K33R) expressing cells are positive for
PCNA (Figure 7B, C). We conclude that mNek1-induced
centrosomal loss results in failure to progress through the
cell cycle. This is consistent with a recent report that the
integrity of the centrosomes is a requirement for progression through the cell cycle [32].
Presumptive Kinase-dead mNek1 localizes to the primary
cilium
Intriguingly, we observed ciliary and centrosomal localization of presumptive kinase-dead (K33R) versions of the
same Nek1 full-length and truncation constructs that
caused inhibition of ciliogenesis and disruption of centro-

The observation of Nek1 localization to the primary cilium is novel. We have not observed endogenous mNek1
in the primary cilium (data not shown; [14]), nor do we
observe any of our other tagged-Nek1 constructs in the cilium. Based on these observations, we propose that Nek1
may normally cycle through the ciliary compartment but
only kinase-dead Nek1 is retained in the cilia long enough
(or in sufficient quantities) to be visualized.

Discussion
Nek1 is a centrosome-associated protein and mice without functional Nek1 develop polycystic kidneys [2-4]. A
link between centrosomal or ciliary dysfunction and the
formation of kidney cysts is well-established and generally
thought to be causal, although the molecular details have
not yet been worked out [12,13]. Kidney cysts are associated with aberrant cell proliferation, differentiation,
apoptosis and loss of proper orientation of mitotic spindles along the axis of the renal tubules [33-37]. This is
consistent with a growing body of evidence that many signals for proliferation and differentiation are received and
processed by the primary cilium [38,39]. Consequently,
Nek1 provides a promising opportunity to test our prediction that some mammalian Nek proteins play dual roles
in the regulation of cilia and cell cycle progression
[10,22].
We have shown here that transient over-expression of
mNek1 inhibits ciliogenesis and overexpression of a Nek1
construct lacking its inhibitory domain causes disassembly of centrosomes. These data suggest that the normal
function of the endogenous protein might involve regulation of centrosomal integrity and ciliogenesis. Unfortunately, we were unable to complement this work with
studies of mNek1 knock-down because none of our
mNek1 RNAi experiments yielded greater than 50%
knock-down of mNek1 protein expression, and we did
not detect any mutant phenotypes in these cells (data not
shown). It is unlikely that this failure to generate knockdown cells is a consequence of some essential function of
mNek1 because the kat and kat2J mice are viable as

homozygotes. Nevertheless, the over-expression studies
allow us to deduce some aspects of the cellular activities
of Nek1.
We found that overexpression of full-length Nek1 and certain truncated forms of the protein inhibit ciliogenesis
(see Figures 3 and 5). We think that the over-expression
phenotype is a consequence of excessive mNek1 kinase
activity. This conclusion is supported by the observation
that over-expression of presumptive kinase-dead forms of
mNek1 do not inhibit ciliogenesis. Over-expression of
full-length kinase is expected to add substantial Nek1
kinase activity to the cell, even if the bulk of the protein is
inhibited. An excess of Nek1 activity could inhibit ciliogenesis by blocking post-mitotic upregulation of ciliary

There are precedents for Nek activity to enhance rates of
ciliary disassembly. Ciliary assembly, disassembly and
length control are all mediated by a balance of the rates of
anterograde and retrograde IFT (intraflagellar transport;
[40]). The Chlamydomonas Nek Cnk2 is an axonemal protein that affects ciliary length by modulating the rate of
disassembly and the delay before onset of assembly [9].
Stable overexpression results in cilia that are shorter than
normal, whereas RNAi-based knockdown results in long
cilia. The shorter flagella were shown to be a consequence
of accelerated rates of disassembly in the Chlamydomonas
cells that were overexpressing Cnk2. Importantly, the
longer cilia in cells with reduced Cnk2 were not a consequence of decreased rates of disassembly. Rather, when
levels of Cnk2 are reduced there is a decrease in the lag
time preceding ciliary assembly. Taken together, these
data suggest that activated Cnk2 promotes ciliary disassembly both during reabsorption of cilia and in the initial
stages of ciliogenesis, perhaps providing a ciliary assembly
checkpoint which coordinates ciliogenesis with exit from
mitosis. In the multi-ciliated protist Tetrahymena, overexpression of the Cnk2 orthologs also result in short cilia,
suggesting conservation of function [41]. Nek1 may
directly regulate the IFT machinery because it directly
interacts with Kif3a, a subunit in the heterotrimeric
molecular motor kinesin-2 responsible for anterograde
IFT [28].
Overexpression of the mitotic kinase Aurora A leads to the
loss of cilia in mammalian cells [42]. Although the disappearance of cilia was attributed to disassembly, inhibition
of post-mitotic ciliogenesis was not ruled out. Nevertheless, loss of cilia in the context of excess Aurora A was
shown to be mediated by activation of the tubulin
deacetylase HDAC6. Pugacheva and colleagues showed
that cilia are retained in cells with excess Aurora A, if these
cells are treated with HDAC inhibitors. In contrast, we
could not rescue Nek1-dependent cilia loss by incubation
with the same HDAC inhibitors, although acetylation of
microtubules was greatly increased in these cells (data not
shown). We conclude that Nek1 is affecting ciliogenesis
by a different pathway than Aurora A.
We next considered the possibility that Nek1 was affecting
ciliogenesis as a consequence of disruptive effects on the
centrosomes/basal body apparatus, the docking site for
protein complexes en route to the cilium. We did not
detect disruption of localization of centrosomal components in cells overexpressing Nek1 (Figure 3 and data not
shown), nevertheless these cells failed to assemble cilia. It
is possible that there may have been subtle centrosomal
defects not detected because when truncation mutants
lacking the presumptive inhibitory C-terminal domain
were expressed, we detected rapid loss of γ-tubulin at the
centrosomes, followed by loss of the centrin signal (Table

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/29

1 and Figures 5 and 6). Similar to the inhibition of ciliogenesis by the full-length protein, these effects depended
upon the kinase activity of Nek1 because constructs carrying the kinase-disrupting mutation K33R did not disrupt
centrosomal integrity and ciliogenesis occurred normally
(Table 1 and Figure 6). We interpret these data to reflect a
more severe augmentation of Nek1 kinase activity by the
truncation mutants, which may be constitutively active. If
the centrosome disassembly induced by these mutant
forms of the protein reflects a pathological manifestation
of a more subtle centrosome-remodelling activity of the
endogenous protein, then these data would support the
idea that the inhibition of ciliogenesis by over-expression
of full-length mNek1 might be secondary to effects on the
integrity of the centrosome.
We observed that presumptive kinase-dead Nek1 truncation mutants localized to the cilium and the nucleus (Figure 8). Kinase-active proteins were also found in the
nucleus, but these cells did not have cilia (Table 1). We
used presumptive kinase-dead constructs to identify a ciliary targeting domain in the first two coiled-coils of
mNek1 (Figure 8). This same domain is also required for
the centrosome/primary cilium disruption caused by
expression of constructs that encode the wild-type kinase
domain, suggesting that Nek1 might act directly on the
centrosome and possibly also within the cilium. One
caveat is that although the coiled-coil domain of mNek1
is sufficient for localization to the primary cilium, fusion
proteins composed of the entire C-terminus of mNek1
(residues 258–1203) fail to localize to the primary cilia
(not shown). This could indicate that the C-terminus prevents ciliary accumulation. Although we demonstrate the
necessity of a functional ciliary targeting sequence for
inhibition of ciliogenesis (Table 1 and Figure 8), we can
not rule out the possibility that the effect was via nuclear
activity because each of fusion proteins that disrupted
centrosomes also localized to the nucleus.

Conclusion
Based on our data, we conclude that the cellular roles of
endogenous Nek1 likely include regulation of ciliogenesis, possibly via effects on centrosome remodelling. We
interpret the results of this study with caution because
they are based exclusively on over-expression phenotypes
of tissue culture cells. Nevertheless, the pattern of phenotypes caused by the array of mutant forms of Nek1 used in
this work is informative. Our data strongly indicate that
the phenotypes are related to Nek1 kinase activity. Furthermore, the phenotypes are specific to over-expression
of mNek1. For example, over-expression of mNek8 does
not affect ciliogenesis, centrosomes or cell cycle progression [43,44]. Therefore, from the current work we conclude that an excess of Nek1 kinase activity inhibits
assembly of cilia. Considering our data in the context of

other studies (see Discussion) we further speculate that
Nek1 participates in signalling between the primary cilium and the nucleus and effects the coordination of ciliogenesis with cell cycle progression.

Methods
Cell lines, cell culture and microscopy
The murine renal epithelial cell line derived from inner
medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) was maintained in a
1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM-F12 (+),
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Experiments were performed
using cells below passage ten. Transient transfections were
carried out with 4 μg of plasmid using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM reduced-serum media,
according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 hours,
cells were washed and transferred to pre-warmed DMEMF12 (+). We set this as time zero post-transfection. For
immunofluorescence, cells grown on coverslips were fixed
with -20°C methanol for 10 minutes and rehydrated in
PBS. The coverslips were incubated in primary antibody
diluted in PBS for 1 hour, followed by two 15-minute PBS
washes. The coverslips were then incubated in secondary
antibody for 1 hour, followed by two 15-minute PBS
washes. Nuclei were stained by a 10 minute, 1 μg/mL 4',
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) incubation at roomtemperature. Stained coverslips were mounted in mowiol
(Calbiochem, Dan Diego, CA). Immunofluorescence
microscopy was performed using the Delta Vision system
(Applied Precision, Isaaquah, WA) as described previously [8].
