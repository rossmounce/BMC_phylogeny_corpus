Abstract
Background: Genome-wide studies have already shed light into the evolution and enormous
diversity of the viral world. Nevertheless, one of the unresolved mysteries in comparative genomics
today is the abundance of ORFans – ORFs with no detectable sequence similarity to any other ORF
in the databases. Recently, studies attempting to understand the origin and functions of bacterial
ORFans have been reported. Here we present a first genome-wide identification and analysis of
ORFans in the viral world, with focus on bacteriophages.
Results: Almost one-third of all ORFs in 1,456 complete virus genomes correspond to ORFans, a
figure significantly larger than that observed in prokaryotes. Like prokaryotic ORFans, viral ORFans
are shorter and have a lower GC content than non-ORFans. Nevertheless, a statistically significant
lower GC content is found only on a minority of viruses. By focusing on phages, we find that 38.4%
of phage ORFs have no homologs in other phages, and 30.1% have no homologs neither in the viral
nor in the prokaryotic world. Phages with different host ranges have different percentages of
ORFans, reflecting different sampling status and suggesting various diversities. Similarity searches
of the phage ORFeome (ORFans and non-ORFans) against prokaryotic genomes shows that almost
half of the phage ORFs have prokaryotic homologs, suggesting the major role that horizontal
transfer plays in bacterial evolution. Surprisingly, the percentage of phage ORFans with prokaryotic
homologs is only 18.7%. This suggests that phage ORFans play a lesser role in horizontal transfer
to prokaryotes, but may be among the major players contributing to the vast phage diversity.
Conclusion: Although the current sampling of viral genomes is extremely low, ORFans and nearORFans are likely to continue to grow in number as more genomes are sequenced. The abundance
of phage ORFans may be partially due to the expected vast viral diversity, and may be instrumental
in understanding viral evolution. The functions, origins and fates of the majority of viral ORFans
remain a mystery. Further computational and experimental studies are likely to shed light on the
mechanisms that have given rise to so many bacterial and viral ORFans.

Background
Genome-wide studies of microbial ORFans have been carried out for about ten years now [1,2]. One of the major
surprises in these studies is the large percentage of ORFs
(Open Reading Frames) having few or no homologs in the
databases [3,4]. These are referred to as ORFans [1]. With
hundreds of complete prokaryote genome sequences, it
has become evident that the presence of many ORFan
genes is a natural phenomenon [3-7], that will continue
to be observed for years. Recent studies have suggested
that most ORFans are likely to correspond to real,
expressed and functional proteins [8-13]. Despite studies
focusing on particular bacterial lineages [14], the origin
and functions of ORFans remain a mystery [6,15,16]: If
proteins in different organisms have descended from
common ancestral proteins by duplication and adaptive
variation, why is it that so many today show no similarity
to each other [4,15]? Why is it that we do not find today
any of the necessary "intermediate sequences" that must
have given rise to these ORFans? Do most ORFans correspond to rapidly diverging proteins [17,18]? If so, do they
mainly correspond to nonessential proteins or to the species determinants?
Regardless of their origin, ORFans may be of two types [4].
Some ORFans may correspond to proteins with unique
functions not currently observed in other families. Alternatively, ORFans may correspond to rapidly evolving and
highly divergent members of known protein families, but
with functions similar to proteins already known. Notice
that our ORFan definition does not depend on database
annotations beyond the mere ORF identification or on
assumptions about the origin of ORFans. We use a merely
operational definition: an ORFan is simply an ORF with
no detectable sequence similarity to other ORFs in the
database considered. This definition allows us to objectively identify and quantify ORFans, a required first step
towards attempting to understand their functions and origins.
Recently, there has been a renewed interest in viral
genomics [19], in part because of the realization of the
major role that viruses, and in particular phages, have
played in evolution. So far, the complete genome
sequences of more than a thousand viruses, including
hundreds of phages, have been deposited in the public
database. Recent studies of phage genomes have revealed
that horizontal transfer (HT) has played a major role in
viral genome evolution [20,21]. Phages exchange genes
with other phages mostly when they are inside the same
host cell and with prophages residing in the host genome
[22,23]. Phages can also exchange genes with their hosts,
by integrating them as prophages or by exchanging individual genes with their hosts via recombination [24-26].
In particular, recent sequencing and comparative analyses

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/24

of cyanophages and cyanobacteria has revealed some
cases of HTs from hosts to phages [27-29].
Here we extend our ORFan studies to the viral world by
addressing the following questions: 1) what is the percentage of ORFans in viruses and phages, how does it
compare to the percentage of ORFans in bacteria, and how
is this percentage related to the current phage sampling
and to phage diversity? 2) Do viral ORFans show particular characteristics regarding length and GC content, as
bacterial ORFans do? 3) How scarce is the current viral
sampling, and are current observations likely to hold after
many more genomes are sequenced? 4) What role do
phage ORFans play in horizontal transfer from and to bacterial hosts?

Results and discussion
The viral sequence data used in this work was obtained by
downloading all 1,456 virus genomes available at Refseq
[30] on September 2005. These genomes encode a total of
43,566 ORFs. We refer to this set of ORFs as our "AllVirus-DB". Out of the 1,456 virus genomes, 280 are
phages, encoding a total of 18,368 ORFs. We refer to this
set of phage ORFs as our "Phage-DB".
ORFans collection
A viral ORF is defined to be a viral ORFan if a BLASTP
search against our All-Virus-DB finds no significant hits
outside its residing genome (see Material and Methods).
13,078 (30.0%) viral ORFs were thus identified as viral
ORFans, a figure similar to that previously reported [31].
Notice that the percentage of viral ORFans is much larger
than that of bacterial ORFans (9.1% in [6]). This confirms
previous observations suggesting that the diversity among
viruses is expected to be significantly larger than that
among bacteria [31,32].

It is important to point out that our identification of
ORFans is highly dependant on the quality of gene identification programs used to generate the list of ORFs in the
database, especially the shorter ones. ORFs may be underpredicted (false negatives in gene prediction, and thus
should be present in the database), or over-predicted
(false positives in gene prediction, and thus should not be
present in the database). It is beyond the scope of this
paper to attempt to improve the ORF identification programs or to estimate the ratio of under- versus over- predicted ORFs in vira. Nevertheless, to partially overcome
the problem of over-prediction of short ORFs that may
not correspond to real genes, we have repeated all computations considering only ORFs longer than 300 bp (see
Dataset Controls in Methods below). Previous works have
shown that it is more unlikely for a longer ORF to be a
false positive [3,33]. We believe that using this length
threshold, we have significantly reduced the number of

possible short false positives without removing a significant number of true-positive short ORFs.

ORFans and non-ORFans is smaller and statistically less
significant in viruses than it is in bacteria.

Special characteristics of ORFans
It has been observed that bacterial ORFans have a number
of characteristics different than those found in bacterial
non-ORFans [3,14,34]. One of these is length: bacterial
ORFans are shorter than non-ORFans on average (mean
value 159 vs. 327 residues; p-value < 2.2e-16). To test
whether viral ORFans are also shorter than viral nonORFans, we computed the length distribution of viral
ORFans and non-ORFans (Figure 1). As is clear from the
figure, viral ORFans are also shorter than non-ORFans,
with mean length values similar to those of Bacteria (172
vs. 356 residues; p-value < 2.2e-16).

However, it is important to point out that using averages
can be dangerous, as averages do not take into account the
properties of individual genomes. While the observation
that ORFans are shorter on average than non-ORFans
holds for the vast majority of individual genomes, the
observation that ORFans have lower GC content does not.
The percentages of individual genomes that show that
ORFans are statistically significantly shorter than nonORFans are 99.6% and 100%, among bacterial and viral
genomes, respectively (Figure 2A–B). But the percentages
of individual genomes that show that ORFans have statistically significant lower GC content than non-ORFans are
only 70.2% and 26.8% (!) among the bacterial and viral
genomes, respectively (Figure 2C–D).

Another reported characteristic of bacterial ORFans is that
they have significant lower GC content than non-ORFans
[14,34]. The GC3 content (GC at the third codon positions [34]) of bacterial ORFans is 51.4% whereas that of
bacterial non-ORFans is 54.2% (p-value < 2.2e-16). To
test whether this also holds for viruses, we computed the
average GC3 content of viral ORFans and compared it to
that of viral non-ORFans. The mean GC3 content of viral
ORFans is 44.7%, also significantly lower than that of
viral non-ORFans (45.9%; p-value = 7.0e-13). Nevertheless, notice that the difference in GC3 content between

Viral ORFans are shorter than non-ORFans on average. The
mean ORF length of ORFans is 172, whereas that of nonORFans is 356. The histogram shows the length distribution
of all viral ORFs. The lower bars correspond to viral ORFans.

Focusing on phages: higher percentage of ORFans in
phages
The 1,456 genomes in our All-Virus-DB comprise a very
diverse set of organisms as it includes a variety of distantly
related viral species with very diverse lifestyles: the 3 most
abundant virus classes are ssRNA positive-strand viruses
with no DNA stage (450 genomes), dsDNA viruses with
no RNA stage (425 genomes), and ssDNA viruses (244
genomes). In addition, the viruses in our All-virus-DB
show a great variability in genome size. Figure 3 shows the
distribution of genome size (measured as the number of
ORFs per viral genome) in our All-virus-DB. The average
number of ORFs per genome is 30. Most of the viruses
have very small genomes: 73.3% of the viruses have
genomes with fewer than 20 ORFs (85 genomes have only
one ORF), while only 7.4% of the viruses have more than
100 ORFs (the 3 largest genomes are: Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus and
Shrimp white spot syndrome virus with 911, 690 and 531
ORFs, respectively).

The red bars in Figure 3 correspond to those viruses identified as phages (280 in total). Compared with the other
viruses, phages have less extreme distribution of number
of ORFs per genome: 163 out of the 280 (~60%) phages
have between 40 and 100 ORFs in their genome. In addition, phages are mainly restricted to one taxonomical
class: 75% of phages (211) correspond to dsDNA viruses
with no RNA stage. In what follows, we study these 280
phages in more detail. We refer to the set of 280 phages as
our "Phage-DB", which contains a total of 18,368 ORFs.
Notice that phages correspond to less than 20% (280/
1456) of all viral genomes, while the total number of
phage ORFs correspond to more than 42% (18,368/
43,566) of all viral ORFs.

Length and GC3 content of ORFans and non-ORFans
Length and GC3 content of ORFans and non-ORFans. While ORFans are statistically significantly shorter than non-ORFans in
the majority of genomes, they have statistically significantly lower GC3 content than non-ORFans in a smaller fraction of the
genomes. We applied the Wilcoxon nonparametric test to individual genomes. The null hypotheses were that ORFans are not
shorter than non-ORFans, and that they do not have lower GC3 content than non-ORFans. For each genome, we compared
the protein length and GC3 content distributions of its ORFans and non-ORFans. A p-value < 0.05 rejects the null hypothesis,
and significantly supports the alternative hypothesis. A p-value > 0.95 supports the null hypothesis and a p-value between the
two values means no significant difference. Only genomes with at least 30 ORFans and 30 non-ORFans were considered. The
upper panels show the results of the length test on prokaryotes (left) and viruses (right). The lower panels show the results of
the GC3 content test on prokaryotes (left) and viruses (right). Clearly, while the lower GC3 content of ORFans is statistically
significant for about 70% of the bacterial genomes, it is statistically significant only for 27% of the viral genomes.

Out of 18,368 phage ORFs, 7,047 (38.4%) correspond to
phage ORFans (no homologs in other phages), significantly larger than the percentage of ORFans among all
viruses (30.0%). This suggests that the diversity among
phages is larger than that among all viruses. Interestingly,
all but 282 (4.0%) out of the 7,047 phage ORFans correspond to viral ORFans too (no homologs in All-VirusDB).

the number of available phage genomes. The figure suggests that although the percentage of ORFans is gradually
decreasing, it is not likely to drop significantly even after
hundreds of more phage genomes are sequenced. It also
suggests that the actual number of ORFans will continue
to grow as more genomes are sequenced. These trends in
phages are consistent with those observed in prokaryotes
[4,5].

Growing number of ORFans

due to the number of fully sequenced organisms, and that

The number of phage ORFans is growing
The number of phage ORFans is growing. The plot was computed by averaging the results of 1000 random selections of
subsets of the 280 phage genomes. The average number of
ORFans in each subset size is shown in red, and the percentage of ORFans (computed as the number of ORFans divided
by the total number of ORFs) is shown in blue.

more complete genomes are sequenced. However, as we
have previously demonstrated [3], the number of new
ORFans in newly sequenced genomes is greater than the
number of older ORFans that become non-ORFans.
Indeed, it is estimated that >91% marine viral genes are
novel [38]. Consequently, as more complete genomes are
sequenced, the total number of ORFans will continue to
grow, and our figure of 30.0% viral ORFans is not likely to
vary dramatically in the coming years [4].
ORFans in different phage groups
It has been estimated that each microbial species is a host
for at least 10 phage species, suggesting the phage diversity is at least 10 times higher than microbial diversity,
comprising about 108 species [39]. Nevertheless, there are
only 280 phage genomes in our Phage-DB, suggesting that
at least to some extent, the very high percentage of phage
ORFans is a result of low phage sampling. To further
explore this possibility, we studied the ORFans percentages in different phage groups.

Because phages with phylogenetically close hosts are often
similar to each other [22,40-44], we classified the 280
phages according to their host ranges. We identified the
hosts attacked by these phages, by automatically parsing
the corresponding Genbank format files, or manually
checking the related literature and searching against NCBI
taxonomy database (Additional file 1). In Table 1, we list
the taxonomical groups of the hosts identified, showing
the number of sequenced prokaryotes, the number of
sequenced phages, the sampling ratio and the percentage
of phage ORFans. The table lists the 12 major lower level
groups (those with less than 5 phages are grouped as
"Others"), and the three higher level groups: Firmicutes,
Gamma-Proteobacteria, and "non-Firm-Gamma". The
average phage sampling ratio in each group is computed
as the number of prokaryotes divided by the number of
phages. This ratio reflects the current sampling status for
each phage group. A sampling ratio of 10 would suggest
that microbes are infected by 10 phages on average. However, the overall average ratio for all phages is only slightly
higher than 1.0 (280 phages/277 prokaryotes), clearly
showing that the current phage sampling is very low; the
highest ratio is 3.3 for the Sulfolobales group, and the
lowest (excluding "Others") is 0.38 for the Cyanobacteria
group. The table also shows that the current sampling is
biased towards Firmicutes and Gamma-Proteobacteria,
the two most prevalently studied bacteria phyla [6]. In
addition, within each phage group, the sampling is also
biased, often toward some intensively studied bacteria.
For example, 43 out of 62 Enterobacteria phages infect
Escherichia coli; 35 out of 48 Bacillales phages infect Staphylococcus aureus and 12 out of 18 Pseudomonadales
phages infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Additional file 1).

Table 1 also shows that the percentage of ORFans varies
significantly among the groups (last column). Firmicutes
have the fewest proportion of ORFans (27.1%) and "nonFirm-Gamma" have the largest (53.7%), reflecting the fact
that the lowest sampled group has the highest percentage
of ORFans. We would expect to observe a large negative
correlation between the phage sampling ratios and the
percentage of ORFans, if the following three conditions
held: 1) the high percentage of ORFans is mainly influenced by the sampling; 2) different phage groups have
similar diversities and 3) the phages that infect prokaryotes are evenly distributed. However, we do not observe
any correlation between the phage sampling ratios and
the percentage of ORFans (Spearman's rank correlation
rho = -0.17, p-value = 0.61). This may be mainly due to
the biased phage sampling and the varying diversities
among the groups. For example, the Pseudomonadales
phages contain the highest percentage of ORFans
(88.7%), despite having a relatively large sampling ratio
(18 phages for 9 bacteria). This suggests a relatively high
phage diversity in this group [42]. In contrast, the
Chlamydiae phages contain the lowest percentage of
ORFans (6.8%), despite having a relatively low sampling
ratio (5 phages for 10 bacteria). Interestingly, these 5
phages are all ssDNA viruses, whose diversity was not
thought to be as high as that of dsDNA phages [43].
In summary, the above analysis shows that the current
phage sampling is biased and scarce, corroborating previous observations [6,39]. Thus, any conclusions derived
from the current data should be taken as preliminary
observations only. Nevertheless, we believe that the data
today already allows us to begin genome-wide studies,
and some major trends already observed may be highly

informative and may hold, at least qualitatively, when
many more phages are sequenced.
ORF conservation in the viral and prokaryotic world
We investigate the degree of conservation of phage ORFs,
measured as the number of detectable phage homologs
per ORF. For each ORF o, we compute its H value, defined
as the number of phage genomes that contain homologs
to o [6]. Notice that ORFs with H = 1 correspond to
ORFans, and low values of H correspond to narrowly distributed ORFs and near ORFans. Figure 5 (left panel)
shows the histogram of H-value percentages (H value
divided by the total number of phages: 280) for all phage
ORFs.

The figure shows that the phage ORFeome is highly
diverse: in addition to the large percentage of ORFans
(38.4%; H = 1), about a third (32.4%, 5,959 ORFs) of all
phage ORFs have homologs in less than 5 phages (2< =
H< = 5), and no phage ORF is conserved in more than
30% (H>84) of all the phages. As a comparison, the right
panel shows the corresponding H-value percentage plot
for prokaryotic ORFs, computed using a database of 277
prokaryotic genomes containing a total of 820,768 ORFs
[6]. The figure shows that the prokaryotic ORFeome is less
diverse than the phage ORFeome: the percentage of
ORFans and near-ORFans are much lower than in phages
(9.1% ORFans [H = 1] and 11.3% near ORFans [2< = H<
= 5]) and 42.6% of bacterial ORF are conserved in at least
30% of the genomes.
HT between viral and prokaryotic worlds
It has been observed that there is a large phage gene pool
residing inside prokaryotes (as prophages or phagederived dispersed genes), suggesting extensive horizontal

transfer (HTs) from phages to the hosts (phage-to-host
HTs) [25,26]. In addition, HTs of host genes into phages
(host-to-phage HTs) have also been observed [29,45].
Therefore, we should expect to find prokaryotic homologs
for those phage ORFans and non-ORFans involved in HT.
That is, some of the phage ORFans are not absolute
ORFans when considering the prokaryotic ORFeome. To
attempt to identify and quantify HTs between the two
worlds, we carried out BLAST searches for each phage ORF
(ORFans and non-ORFans) within the 280 phages in our
Phage-DB against our database of 277 complete prokaryotic genomes. Figure 6 depicts our results as a function of
the phage ORF H-value computed above.
Considering phage ORFans only, we found prokaryotic
homologs for only 18.7% of the phage ORFans (1,317 out
of 7,047, blue and green bars in the first column of Figure
6). Interestingly, the corresponding computation in
prokaryotes showed that only 1.7% of the bacterial
ORFans have homologs in the viral world [6]. By focusing
on the best prokaryotic match, we find that 44.7% of these
ORFans' best homologs (589 out of 1,317, green bars)
correspond to prophages within a prokaryotic genome,
clearly indicating that they correspond to phage-to-host
HTs. In contrast, we found prokaryotic homologs for
63.8% of the phage non-ORFans (7,150 out of the 11,212
phage non-ORFans, blue and green bars in the other columns), and 61.5% of these non-ORFans' best prokaryotic
homologs (4,397 out of 7,150) correspond to prophages.
This shows that (i) the percentage of phage non-ORFans
with prokaryotic homologs is significantly higher than

that of the phage ORFans (63.8% vs. 18.7%) and that (ii)
the more conserved a phage ORF is within the phage
world (higher H-value), the more likely it is to have
homologs in the prokaryotic world, and the more likely it
is that its best homolog resides within a prophage; in particular, all of the phage ORFs (1,624) with H> = 15 have
homologs in prokaryotes (80.4% of which reside in
prophages). These findings are consistent with those
recently observed in mycobacteriophages [44]. We propose that this may be a consequence of the simple fact that
a better conserved phage ORF (with a larger H-value)
means that our database contains more phages that can
potentially transmit a homolog to prokaryotes. Considering phage ORFans and non-ORFans together, we find that
46.4% (8,467) phage ORFs have homologs in the
prokaryotic world, of which 58.9% (4,987) have their best
homologs within prophages. This suggests that over one
fourth of the phage ORFs have been involved in HT from
the phage to the bacterial world.
While determining HT from phage to bacteria on the basis
of finding prophage homologs is relatively straightforward, other types of HT (host to phage HT or phage to
host HT, but not as prophages) are more difficult to identify. While some studies have already identified cases of
host to phage HT [27], further studies are required to estimate the overall fraction of phage ORFans and nonORFans that correspond to horizontally transferred ORFs
from bacteria. The fact that the percentage of ORFans with
bacterial homologs is significantly lower than that of nonORFans suggests that many phage ORFans may corre-

Bar plot of the H-value percentages of phage ORFs. On the
basis of the left panel of Fig. 5, three types of phage ORFs are
shown. Red bins correspond to phage ORFs with no
prokaryotic homologs. The other bins correspond to phage
ORFs having homologs in prokaryotes, which include two
types: those with their best homolog not in prophages (blue)
and those with their best homolog within prophages (green).
The less conserved a phage ORF is within phages, the less
likely it is to be a prokaryotic homolog. In addition, the more
conserved a phage ORFs that has a prokaryotic homolog is,
the more likely it is that its best homolog resides as a

will likely turn out to be major players in the enormous
phage diversity. Further sampling of bacterial and phage
genomes will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and the relationship between
these two worlds.

a small percentage of the individual phage genomes. We
found that while a majority of phage non-ORFans have
bacterial homologs (61.5% of which are likely to be
involved in phage to host horizontal transfer), only a
small percentage of phage ORFans have bacterial
homologs (and only a small fraction of which are
involved in phage to host HT). Because the current sampling of phages (and of bacterial genomes in general), is
limited and biased towards particular groups, the percentage of ORFans in different phage groups varies significantly. This low sampling may be a factor contributing to
the abundance of phage ORFans, but is not likely to be the
only one. That is, even after many more genomes are
sequenced, we expect to find a significant number of
ORFans and near-ORFans, awaiting interpretation. There
are also other possibilities to account for the ORFans' origin, like rapid divergence after horizontal transfer (from
hosts or from other viruses, from existent genomes or yet
extinct genomes) or duplication. Future studies are
required to elucidate how much these possibilities
account the most for what viruses: e.g. marine phages
have been thought to have grasped many genes from their
hosts [27]. Unraveling the mystery of the origins and functions of ORFans will likely remain a major challenge.

Methods
Protein and genomic data
Virus proteins and genomic data in Refseq release 13
(Sept. 13, 2005) were downloaded from [46]. 43,566 viral
proteins are cross referenced to 1,456 NCBI taxonomical
species. Another 72 viral species not encoding proteins in
the Refseq release 13 were excluded in our analyses. 277
fully sequenced microbial proteomes and genomes (Nov.
03, 2005) were downloaded from [47], as described in
[6].
ORFan identification
Viral ORFans were identified using a procedure similar to
the one we have used in previous work [6]: A viral ORF is
defined to be a viral ORFan if a BLASTP search against our
All-Virus-DB finds no significant hits outside its residing
genome. We define a significant hit if the BLASTP e-value
is lower than 1e-3 (or for alignment lengths < 80aa, 1e-5).

Conclusion
We have carried out a first systematic analysis of viral
ORFans. We have found that the percentage of ORFans in
the virus world is much higher than the percentage of
ORFans among bacteria. We have found that, like in the
bacterial world, viral ORFans are shorter than nonORFans on average, and that this difference is statistically
significant in the vast majority of individual genomes. We
have also found that, like in the bacterial world, viral
ORFans have a lower GC3 content than non-ORFans on
average. However, when studying individual genomes we
found that the difference is statistically significant only for

Prophage identification
We identified prophages residing in the prokaryotic
genomes using our own perl scripts implementing a
method similar to that used by Bose and Barber [48].
Dataset controls
To investigate the possible dependence of our results to
the particular data used, and to attempt to quantify the
extent of any present bias, we have carried out three control experiments. In each control, we applied the exact
same computations as the ones described in the text, and

verified that the results remain statistically significant. The
three control experiments exclude subsets of the data as
follows: a) Excluding shorter ORFs (< = 300 bp) b)
Excluding smaller genomes (<50 ORFs) and c) Excluding
ssDNA and all RNA viruses. In all three cases, our main
observations remain statistically significant. A detailed
summary of each of these controlled can be found at [49].
