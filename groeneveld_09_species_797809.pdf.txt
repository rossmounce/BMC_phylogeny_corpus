Abstract
Background: Species are viewed as the fundamental unit in most subdisciplines of biology. To
conservationists this unit represents the currency for global biodiversity assessments. Even though
Madagascar belongs to one of the top eight biodiversity hotspots of the world, the taxonomy of its
charismatic lemuriform primates is not stable. Within the last 25 years, the number of described
lemur species has more than doubled, with many newly described species identified among the
nocturnal and small-bodied cheirogaleids. Here, we characterize the diversity of the dwarf lemurs
(genus Cheirogaleus) and assess the status of the seven described species, based on phylogenetic and
population genetic analysis of mtDNA (cytb + cox2) and three nuclear markers (adora3, fiba and
vWF).
Results: This study identified three distinct evolutionary lineages within the genus Cheirogaleus.
Population genetic cluster analyses revealed a further layer of population divergence with six
distinct genotypic clusters.
Conclusion: Based on the general metapopulation lineage concept and multiple concordant data
sets, we identify three exclusive groups of dwarf lemur populations that correspond to three of the
seven named species: C. major, C. medius and C. crossleyi. These three species were found to be
genealogically exclusive in both mtDNA and nDNA loci and are morphologically distinguishable.
The molecular and morphometric data indicate that C. adipicaudatus and C. ravus are synonymous
with C. medius and C. major, respectively. Cheirogaleus sibreei falls into the C. medius mtDNA clade,
but in morphological analyses the membership is not clearly resolved. We do not have sufficient
data to assess the status of C. minusculus. Although additional patterns of population differentiation
are evident, there are no clear subdivisions that would warrant additional specific status. We
propose that ecological and more geographic data should be collected to confirm these results.

Background
In most biodiversity and conservation assessments species
are the fundamental unit by which diversity is measured
(e.g [1-3]). Depending on the criteria used to recognize
species, vastly different numbers and distributions can be
identified. For example, the difference in species numbers
when utilizing a phylogenetic species concept (e.g. [4,5])
versus a biological species concept (e.g. [6]) can be substantial. Agapow et al. [7] estimated a 48% increase in recognized species across a wide range of organisms (ranging
from fungi to mammals) when using a phylogenetic species concept. Similarly, Zink [8] proposed a doubling of
known bird species, mostly due to the elevation of subspecies to full specific status. Such a drastic difference in
species numbers would necessitate an extensive revision
of most conservation measures. Furthermore species are
the fundamental unit of comparison in all subdisciplines
within biology (e.g. [9]). As such, robust measures of species delimitation and boundaries are crucial to understanding the evolution of organisms and how best to
manage biodiversity in the face of increased anthropogenic pressure.
The lemuriform primates of Madagascar have undergone
a recent explosion in species descriptions, with as many as
47 new species described in the last 25 years as a result of
intensified field work, the incorporation of molecular
data in the identification of previously cryptic species, and
a paradigm shift in what we recognize as a species [10-12].
This increase has come in the face of tremendous anthropogenic pressures, with Madagascar having just a fraction
of its original native habitat remaining [13]. Increased recognition of lemuriform species diversity has been particularly acute in the family Cheirogaleidae, a clade of smallbodied and nocturnal lemurs with a generally cryptic
morphology. In just over 10 years the number of recognized cheirogaleid species has more than quadrupled with
most of this activity occurring in mouse lemurs of the
genus Microcebus (e.g. [14-20]).
The dwarf lemur genus Cheirogaleus has received considerably less taxonomic attention despite having an islandwide distribution and sharing similar habitats with mouse
lemurs. This genus consisted of two species from the
1930s until the turn of the last century, with only the
number of recognized subspecies varying between
authors. It was proposed that a grayish colored species,
Cheirogaleus medius, inhabited the western dry forests, and
a larger rufus-colored form, Cheirogaleus major, occupied
the eastern rainforests [21-23]. Using descriptive morphological assessments of existing museum material, Groves
[24] split C. medius into two species: (1) C. medius in western Madagascar and (2) C. adipicaudatus in the south.
Cheirogaleus major was split into five species: (1) C. major
with a broad eastern distribution, (2) C. crossleyi, which is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/30

found more inland than C. major and also extends further
north, (3) C. minusculus, known only from a single eastern
locality at Ambositra, (4) C. ravus, which has a narrow
coastal range within C. major, and (5) C. sibreei, with an
unclear distribution, but known from an eastern locality
at Ankeramadinika and possibly from the northwest at the
Ampasindava Bay. While maintaining these two groups
(medius and major), Groves [24] noted that he did so only
for convenience. Nonetheless, he found these seven taxa
to represent distinguishable morphs and interpreted them
as separate genetic entities. However, until now, no comprehensive study of geographic and genetic variation has
been performed to test the hypothesis that these seven
taxa represent distinct phylogenetic species.
Only one study has assessed the geographic patterning of
genetic variation in Cheirogaleus. Hapke et al. [25] used
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data in an
attempt to clarify the species status of three different morphotypes resembling C. crossleyi, C. major, and C. medius
found in close proximity in the Fort Dauphin area of
southeastern Madagascar. Using dense sampling in this
area along with representatives of C. crossleyi, C. major,
and C. medius from other portions of the island, Hapke et
al. [25] resolved three mtDNA haplotype clades each
exclusive to one of the three representative species. These
results are the only genetic evidence to date that some of
the species described by Groves [25] represent independent lineages. They also greatly expand the potential range
of C. crossleyi into the southern portion of the island. Evidence for the exclusivity of C. adipicaudatus, C. minusculus,
C. ravus, and C. sibreei is still lacking.
Robust studies of species delimitation should take into
account both geographic and genetic variation in the recognition of species-level lineages. Field sampling of individuals should be sufficient to characterize the frequency
of alleles within a single locality and also sufficient to
characterize their spatial distribution [26]. Genetic sampling should be sufficient to provide some understanding
of the genealogical variation that exists across independent loci as a result of the lineage sorting process and gene
flow [27,28]. Species delimitation approaches that take
the above into account and search for concordant patterns
across independent data sets have been proposed and
employed by numerous researchers in the past [e.g.
[27,29-34]]. However, recent efforts in lemur species
delimitation have raised concerns regarding the methods
and data used for the diagnosis of species-level lineages
[12]. The majority of recent descriptions has relied primarily on mtDNA, using either genetic distances or fixed substitutions as criteria for species recognition or has not
provided proper holotypes [e.g. [18-20]]. These practices
beg the question whether such data and their analysis are
sufficient to reliably diagnose species-level units, despite

the potential for gene tree-species tree discordance due to
gene flow or lineage sorting [28,35,36].

addition, the vWF alignment contained indels of 19 and
242 bp in six and three individuals, respectively.

In this study we aim to provide a more comprehensive
assessment of species diversity in the genus Cheirogaleus
using an expanded geographic and genetic sampling
approach. We use a concordance-based approach [see e.g.
[27,29,33]] across independent sources of mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA sequence data to identify independently
evolving lineages according to the General Lineage Concept of species [9,37]. We also explore a finer level of resolution using population-genetic structuring methods to
diagnose sets of populations that are genetically distinct
and, which may represent more recently diverged, but
independently evolving population-level lineages.

The cytb, cox2, and adora3 loci were each found to best fit
a general time-reversible (GTR) model according to AIC.
The mtDNA loci were best fit to a model with a proportion of invariant sites (I) and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (Γ), whereas adora3 was best fit to a model
with a proportion of invariant sites. A K81uf+I+Γ model
was favored for the fiba locus, (analyzed under a GTR+I+Γ
model in Bayesian phylogenetic analyses). The vWF locus
was found to best fit an HKY+I+Γ model (Table 4).

In our molecular analyses we included field samples,
museum samples and already published sequences from
GenBank. With this multilocus data set and with references to recently collected morphological data, we aim to
provide the best estimate of diversity in the genus Cheirogaleus currently possible and test the exclusivity of the
seven recognized species. If we view taxonomic classifications as scientific hypotheses that may be refined and
revised with new data [38,39], our study can contribute
significantly towards clarification and interpretation of
dwarf lemur diversity.

Results
Haplotype data
The concatenated cytb and cox2 sequences from the 48
field samples (Table 1) amounted to 1824 bp and contained no indels. There were 468 variable sites defining 29
haplotypes. A fragment of 246 bp was obtained from
museum samples of 16 individuals (Table 2). Among
these 16 samples, there were 48 variable sites defining 9
haplotypes. 24 Cheirogaleus haplotypes from GenBank,
consisting of 17 complete and five partial (307–933 bp)
cytb sequences, and two complete and one partial (529
bp) cox2 sequences (Table 3), were aligned with the field
and museum haplotypes resulting in an overall set of 62
haplotypes defined through 494 variable sites (Table 4; all
sampling sites are given in Fig. 1).

Nuclear DNA sequence data were generated from the 48
field samples. In all individuals both alleles were scored,
amounting to a data set of 96 sequences for each locus.
Among Cheirogaleus samples, the 370 bp exonic adora3
fragment had 26 variable sites and 29 haplotypes. The 604
bp intronic fragment fiba had 44 variable sites and 49
haplotypes. The 793 bp intronic fragment vWF had 93
variable sites and 52 haplotypes (Table 4). The adora3
alignment contained no indels. Both the fiba and vWF
alignments contained a small number of 1–2 bp indels. In

MtDNA gene tree
Bayesian and ML analyses of the mtDNA data set resulted
in congruent trees with three main clades (A, B and C in Fig.
2) that largely correspond to the three species recognized
prior to the taxonomic revisions of Groves [24]. Clade A is
strongly supported (ML BP = 100 and Bayesian PP = 1.0)
and consists of haplotypes sampled from western Madagascar, the southeastern tip (Fort Dauphin region) and two
sampling sites in the northeast. All mtDNA sequences generated from museum samples of C. medius, C. adipicaudatus,
and C. sibreei are placed in clade A.

Clade B is strongly supported (ML BP = 99 and Bayesian
PP = 1.0) and is comprised of mtDNA haplotypes sampled from localities along the east coast from the southeastern tip (Fort Dauphin region) to the Maroantsetra
peninsula in the northeast (localities 11 and 12). All
mtDNA sequences generated from C. major and C. ravus
samples fall into clade B. MtDNA sequence generated
from a museum sample of C. crossleyi (locality 22) is also
placed in Clade B.
Clade C is strongly supported (ML BP = 96 and Bayesian
PP = 1.0) and also contains eastern-sampled haplotypes,
ranging from the southeastern tip (Fort Dauphin region)
up to the northern tip (Montagne d'Ambre, locality 6).
Clade C also contains haplotypes sampled from three
localities in the northwestern portion of the island (localities 1, 3, and 39). The sole museum-generated sequence
placed in Clade C is the C. crossleyi individual from locality 14.
The mtDNA-based relationships among clades A, B and C
are poorly supported and are best viewed as unresolved.
Uncorrected "p" distances based on the cytb locus (1140
bp) were calculated for the three main clades (A, B and C).
Pairwise distances between the three clades were fairly
similar, with an average 11.4% between clades B and C,
12.6% between clades A and B and 13.10% between
clades A and C.

Nuclear gene trees
Bayesian, ML, and statistical parsimony analyses of the
individual nuclear loci resulted in generally congruent
gene trees with respect to the resolution of clades A, B, and
C identified in the mtDNA gene tree. Bayesian and ML
hierarchical nuclear gene trees are presented as figures in
additional files 1, 2, 3: vWF, fiba and adora3 ML phylo-

gram. Statistical parsimony haplotype networks are presented in Figs. 3, 4, 5. The adora3 haplotype network (Fig.
3) resolves a clade of haplotypes corresponding to clade C
in the mtDNA gene tree. The remaining adora3 haplotypes
collectively correspond to clades A and B in the mtDNA
gene tree. Shared polymorphism of adora3 haplotypes
exists among some individuals assigned to these two

mtDNA-based clades (Fig. 3). Adora3 haplotype 5 is found
in individuals sampled from Ambanja (3), Ambato (4),
and Kirindy (37) in the west (all containing Clade A
mtDNA haplotypes), and is also sampled from Andrambovato (25) in the east (containing a Clade B mtDNA
haplotype). Adora3 haplotype 2 is found in individuals
sampled from Bemaraha (38) in the west (mtDNA Clade
A) and in the Andrambovato locality (mtDNA Clade B).
The fiba haplotype network consists of two terminal
clades that correspond to clades A and C in the mtDNA
gene tree. An internal clade is also resolved corresponding
to mtDNA clade B. All haplotypes in this latter clade have
a common ancestor in fiba haplotype 8 found in a
number of individuals sampled from Marolambo (21).
These three clades are shallowly diverged from each other.
Only two mutational steps separate sampled haplotypes
in clades A and B. Only four mutations separate clades B
and C.
The vWF haplotype network consists of three clades of
haplotypes that nearly completely correspond to clades A,
B, and C in the mtDNA gene tree. The sole exception to
this pattern is individual RMR149 from Andrambovato,
which has a clade B mtDNA haplotype, but is
homozygous for a "clade A" vWF allele.
Population genetic clustering
Bayesian population structure analyses of a combined
mtDNA and nuclear data set and a data set comprised of

only nuclear loci reveal very similar results (additional file
4: Bayesian population structure analysis), indicating that
genetic structuring results are not being driven solely by
the mtDNA data. Overall, differences between the results
of the two data sets were only found in the number of
identical solutions found for each K across replicates, in
the exact contribution of each K to the genetic makeup of
an individual and in the order that individuals split off to
from a separate cluster at K = 4. At K > 6 the number of
identical solutions plummets to 0 at a 95% threshold. A K
= 6 is the favored solution according to the estimated ln
probability of the data (mtDNA + nDNA: average = 1033.2, stdev = 2.4; nDNA: average = -862.0, stdev = 9.5),
and according to the ad-hoc statistic ΔK [40], which
detected a clear mode at K = 6 for the calculations based
on four loci, but showed no clear signal for the three
nuclear loci. The K = 6 results from analyses of the combined nuclear data set are described below in the context
of the three main mtDNA clades (Fig. 6).
Most individuals possessing clade A mtDNA haplotypes
are placed with high PPs in two distinct population clusters (depicted in green and purple in Fig. 6). The genetic
compositions of individuals from Ambanja/Ambato
(locality 4), Kirindy (37), and Ambanja/Benavony (3) are
almost entirely of a single population cluster (green). A
subset of individuals from Sambava (9) and the single
individual sampled from Bekaraoka (7) are placed almost
entirely in a second distinct population cluster (purple).
Together with two individuals from Bemaraha (38),

which do not fall into either of these two population clusters, the individuals forming these two distinct clusters
correspond to clade A mtDNA haplotypes.
All individuals containing clade C mtDNA haplotypes are
comprised of two population genetic clusters (depicted in

viduals are either completely comprised of, or contain
high proportions of, a third population genetic cluster

Most individuals possessing Clade B mtDNA haplotypes
constitute two population genetic clusters (depicted in red
and yellow in Fig. 6). All individuals from Marolambo
and two individuals from Tampolo are either completely
comprised of, or contain some proportion of, a fifth population genetic cluster (red). The individuals sampled
from Ivorona, Manantantely, Andrambovato/Ambalavero
and the remaining individual from Tampolo, are placed
entirely in a sixth cluster (yellow). The sole exception is
one of the individuals from Andrambovato/Ambalavero,
which is only placed in this cluster with a very low PP.
There is a clear indication that many individuals within
mtDNA clades contain a mixed nuclear genetic composition. For example, more than half of individuals with
clade C mtDNA haplotypes exhibit a genetic composition
from two nuclear-defined clusters (orange and blue).
This pattern also extends across mtDNA-defined clades.
For example, some individuals from mtDNA clades A and
B can contain a high proportion of a nuclear genetic cluster (blue) that is predominantly found in individuals with
clade C mtDNA haplotypes. Overall, these patterns demonstrate the existence of two distinct nuclear genetic clusters within each mtDNA-based clade, but demonstrate the
potential for extensive shared genetic makeup within and
among these clades.

Discussion
Groves [24] accepted seven Cheirogaleus species, based on
morphological data, and interpreted them as separate
genetic entities. In this study, mtDNA and nuclear gene
sequences clearly resolved only three main lineages
within the genus Cheirogaleus. Using phylogenetic methods, no further monophyletic subdivisions based on
mtDNA and nDNA could be resolved within each of the
main lineages. However, a population genetic approach
detected a further layer of differentiation, resolving six
genetic clusters that largely correspond to, but are not
strictly concordant with, the main lineages identified via
gene trees. Our results do not rule out the possibility of
additional species of dwarf lemurs in Madagascar. There
are multiple accounts of sympatric species in areas, which
either were not covered by our sampling scheme, or where

our sample only contained one morph [41-44]. However,
according to our data we can only define three clades that
exhibit concordant genealogical patterns across loci.
The three genealogical clades (A, B and C) are largely congruent with three clusters found according to morphometric data (LF Groeneveld, unpublished data). This
morphometric data set consisted of data collected from
the individuals included in this study and museum specimen and can therefore be directly compared to the genetic
data. Species names could be unambiguously assigned to
morphometric clusters. Cheirogaleus medius and C. major
differed primarily in size and pelage coloration, while C.
crossleyi differed from C. medius in size and pelage coloration and from C. major in pelage coloration and in the
width of the skull and in dental characteristics of the
premolars and canines (LF Groeneveld, unpublished
data) This is congruent with the most recent descriptions
of the species [22-24].
Below we discuss the molecular and morphological resolution of evolutionary groups that correspond to population-level lineages and place these within the context of
the existing Cheirogaleus taxonomy.
Clade A (C. medius)
Clade A is strongly supported in ML and Bayesian analyses
of mtDNA sequence data and is also supported by genealogical and population genetic analysis of nuclear data,
although shared polymorphism of adora3 and vWF haplotypes among mtDNA-based clades A and B were detected.
These patterns of shared polymorphism may be the result
of a low mutation rate, incomplete lineage sorting, or
hybridization. Nonetheless, these patterns are limited and
do not obscure the concordant patterns of divergence seen
across all loci.

The genetically-derived Clade A clearly corresponds to C.
medius sensu lato according to morphometric and geographic data, as well as the mtDNA sequences generated
from C. medius museum samples. Analyses of C. adipicaudatus museum specimens invariably place individuals
into the C. medius morphometric cluster and mtDNA
clade. These results strongly suggest that C. adipicaudatus

is synonymous with C. medius, with no evidence indicating that it is divergent from other populations of C.
medius.
The C. sibreei individual included in this study is also
placed into the C. medius clade A. In fact, it shares its
mtDNA haplotype with individual RMR162, an individual most likely belonging to C. medius according to morphometric characters. These two individuals also cluster
together in morphometric analyses (LF Groeneveld,

unpublished data). As with C. adipicaudatus, these results
do not lend support to the hypothesis of C. sibreei as a distinct evolutionary group.
Clade B (C. majors)
Clade B is strongly supported in ML and Bayesian analyses
of mtDNA and corroborated by nuclear data, although
with the patterns of shared polymorphism described
above. According to analyses of morphological and
mtDNA sequence data generated from museum specimens, clade B corresponds to C. major. Analyses of morphological and mtDNA sequence data of C. ravus
specimens are congruent and place these individuals into
the C. major morphometric cluster and mtDNA clade B.
There is no evidence to suggest that C. ravus represents a
distinct genetic lineage within the larger C. major group

and we conclude that C. ravus is synonymous with C.
major. Interestingly, one of the museum-sampled individuals of C. crossleyi (Mu1053) contains an mtDNA haplotype that is placed within mtDNA clade B. However, it is
difficult to infer anything else about this C. crossleyi
museum specimen since this is a juvenile individual and
was not included in the morphological analyses. Other
putatively C. crossleyi museum and field-collected individuals are consistently placed outside the C. major group,
suggesting that the taxonomic designation of the Mu1053
museum individual may be incorrect.
Clade C (C. crossleyi)
Clade C is well supported in ML and Bayesian mtDNA
gene trees and is unambiguously corroborated by all three
nuclear markers. This group contains individuals identified as C. crossleyi in a previous mtDNA-based study [25]
and also a single museum individual (Mu1050). In addition to the mtDNA-based identification of this group,
morphometric analyses find similarity between the new
field-sampled individuals and the Mu1050 museum C.
crossleyi individual (LF Groeneveld, unpublished data).

It is important to note here a slight pattern of incongruence between the morphological and molecular results,
with respect to C. crossleyi and C. major. Two newly sampled individuals, RMR146 and RMR164, are classified as
C. crossleyi individuals according to all genetic data analyses, but cluster with C. major individuals in morphometric
analyses. One of these individuals (RMR146) is sampled
from a locality (25) that contains both species, suggesting
that hybrid introgression may in part be responsible for
such a pattern.
Cheirogaleus minusculus
We have no molecular data to directly assess the status of
C. minusculus. The single specimen upon which this species was described is listed in the museum catalogue of the
British Museum of Natural History (NHM) as being from
Ambositra/Antsirabe [45]. Our geographically closest
sampling site to this locality is Ankazomivady (23), which
is about 29 km south of the town of Ambositra. Morphometric and genetic analyses indicate these are C. crossleyi
individuals, and they do not cluster with the C. minusculus
individual in morphometric analyses. Thus, there is no

indication that these individuals could represent C. minusculus. Unfortunately, the NHM does not allow sampling
of holotype material for molecular analyses, which would
be crucial to assess the status of this proposed species. A
discussion within the museum community and a change
in policy regarding invasive sampling of holotype material for molecular studies is needed to solve this dilemma
for future studies.
Genetic structure within the main Cheirogaleus lineages
Within the three species-level evolutionary lineages further genetic substructuring was detected via population
genetic clustering. Genetic substructure was most tightly
correlated with geography among populations within the
clade A lineage, where some populations from the west
and northwest (3, 4, 37) were placed in a distinct nuclear
cluster, while populations from the northeast (7, 9) were
placed in a second distinct cluster. These patterns indicate
the potential for the further geographic isolation and
divergence of populations beyond the three main Cheirogaleus lineages. However, the lack of concordant geo-

graphic patterns of divergence in the gene trees, especially
in the mtDNA gene tree, indicate that this divergence may
be very recent in nature. It is important to note, however,
that Clade A is not entirely comprised of two genetic clusters, but also contains individuals that have cluster assignments more similar to individuals in the other two
lineages. This same pattern is seen among individuals
from Clades B and C, despite the fact that none of these
individuals share alleles. It is possible that this pattern
may result from an insufficient level of variation to accurately assign individuals. Additional molecular sampling
in future studies is likely to be important in the adequate
assessment of population-level structuring using genotypic clustering methods.
Our results do indicate, however, the special status of the
Sambava locality; two species, C. medius and C. crossleyi,
are found at this locality, and for both species the Sambava individuals are assigned to a genotypic cluster that
largely separates them from other individuals of the
respective species. This is most strongly seen in the case of

C. medius and also includes the single sampled individual
from the geographically close locality of Bekaraoka. Posterior probabilities for cluster assignments for some C.
crossleyi Sambava individuals are low, but many individuals have high posterior probabilities (≥ 0.90) that clearly
distinguish them from other populations of C. crossleyi.
Again, these patterns appear to be signatures of more
recent episodes of geographic isolation and divergence
within the three main lineages of Cheirogaleus.
Geographic distribution of the species
Results from the new sampling sites identified by this
study allow us to further clarify the distribution of the
three species of Cheirogaleus (Fig. 1). All three species are
present in forest fragments in the Fort Dauphin region
(southeastern Madagascar), as described by Hapke et al.
[25]. The range of C. medius extends along the west coast
up north to Ankarana (5). This species is, however, also

found at two sites, Bekaraoka (7) and Sambava (9), on the
northeastern coast. This is consistent with a presumed C.
medius population at Daraina in northeastern Madagascar, as listed in Mittermeier et al. [46]. The distribution of
C. medius is therefore not limited strictly to the western
dry forests. The range of C. crossleyi extends from the
southeastern tip of the island all the way north to Montagne d'Ambre (6) with many sampling sites being found
inland along the eastern edge of the central plateau. There
are a few exceptions in the north, both on the east and
west coast: Sambava (9), Iharana/Vohemar (8), Ambanja/
Beandroana (3), Manongarivo (1) and Ampijoroa (39).
Cheirogaleus major is found, as previously described, in the
eastern lowland forest, from the southeastern tip as far
north as Maroantsetra (11). Additionally, there is one
field (25) and one museum sampling site (22) along the
eastern edge of the central plateau where C. major is
found. We currently do not have any data to assess the

medius and C. crossleyi are found in sympatry. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the speciation patterns
found in dwarf lemurs and those known for mouse
lemurs, with estimates of time divergence dates, would be

Multifaceted approach in species delimitation in lemurs
This study has shown that multiple independent lines of
data can yield a robust estimate of species diversity. Morphological data alone are not expected to provide resolution of previously cryptic species, but indeed have had the
opposite effect of over estimating species diversity [47].
The sole use of mtDNA might have diagnosed distinct
populations, or even local matrilines as species and the
use of any single nuclear marker would most likely lead to
an underestimate of diversity. Only through combining
all of these sources of data were we able to achieve a
robust estimate of lineage diversity in Cheirogaleus and
detect geographically structured patterns of genetic variation. Of course, it would be desirable to add more geographic and ecological information to the current data set,
in order to verify and refine our conclusions. One starting
point would be to examine the distinct populations identified through the population genetic cluster analysis,
with special emphasis on the Sambava locality, where C.

Based on the general metapopulation lineage concept and
multiple sources of data, we clarify the exclusivity of three
of the seven recognized dwarf lemur species: C. major, C.
medius and C. crossleyi. These three species were found to
be genealogically exclusive in both mtDNA and nDNA
loci, and furthermore, they exhibit morphological distinctiveness. Molecular and morphometric data support the
hypothesis that C. adipicaudatus and C. ravus are synonymous with C. medius and C. major, respectively. C. sibreei
falls into the mtDNA C. medius clade, but in morphological analyses the membership is not clearly resolved. We do
not have sufficient data to assess the status of C. minusculus. Population genetic subdivisons are detected within
these three species, but are not conclusive enough to warrant specific status.
The concordance-based approach, based on multiple
independent lines of data, yielded a robust estimate of
diversity within the genus Cheirogaleus and we conclude
that this approach is well-suited for species delimitations.
For dwarf lemur conservation this study implies that,
since there are fewer species with greater individual abundances and distributions, dwarf lemurs should be less
threatened than previously thought. Whether this implies
that dwarf lemurs are not suitable flagship species and
need not be regarded as intensely as other lemur taxa, or
whether more emphasis in conservation should be placed
on other measures than species numbers (e.g. as proposed
by Sechrest et al., [3]) remains to be debated.

Methods
Sampling
Field samples from a total of 48 individuals across 14
localities in Madagascar were collected between March
2003 and May 2007 (Fig. 1, Table 1). Sampling sites were
not evenly distributed across the island due to a bias in
remaining forest cover [48]. Sampling was concentrated
on the larger fragments found in the eastern portion of the
island and makes no claim to be exhaustive. A maximum
of three individuals per site, amounting to 31 individuals,
were sacrificed and preserved as morphotypes and are
now housed at the Département de Biologie Animale de
l'Université d'Antananarivo, Madagascar. Tissue samples
from internal organs (liver, kidney and spleen) and muscle tissue were stored in 70% EtOH. An additional 17
individuals were caught using Sherman live traps. One
hundred traps were set along two to three transects for an

average of 11 nights per site and baited with banana. Tissue for molecular analyses of these individuals was
obtained by ear clipping after animals were anesthetized
with GM2 [49]. External morphological measurements
were taken from all 48 individuals, while internal measurements were only available for the 31 morphotypes.
Animals were released at the site of capture at dusk on the
following day. A total of 44 additional tissue samples were
collected from specimens in three European museums:
the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris
(MNHN); Naturalis – Nationaal Natuurhistorisch
Museum, Leiden, and the Natural History Museum, London (NHM). These specimens are the same individuals
studies in the taxonomic revisions of Groves [24]. Small
amounts of dried tissue were taken from skulls and in a
few cases from skins. Of the 44 museum samples taken,
we were able to include 17 in the final mtDNA analyses
(Table 2). The presumed sampling sites of museum samples are marked with triangles on the map in Fig. 1. A total
of 24 published Cheirogaleus haplotypes were incorporated into the analyses of the mtDNA data set (Table 3).
Sequences from Mirza zaza, Microcebus berthae, M. murinus, and M. ravelobensis, which serve as representatives of
other major cheirogaleid lineages [50], were used as outgroups to root the phylogenetic trees. All previously published GenBank sequences are listed in Table 3 and the
sampling localities for Cheirogaleus sequences are marked
with squares on the map in Fig. 1. All sequences generated
for this study were deposited in GenBank under accession
numbers EU825210-EU825610.
Laboratory work
Genomic DNA was extracted from both field and museum
tissue samples using the QIAamp™ DNA Mini Kit for DNA
purification (QIAGEN) following standard protocol. For

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/30

the field-collected samples two mitochondrial [cytochrome b (cytb), cytochrome oxidase II (cox2)] and three
nuclear loci [adenosine receptor A3 exon 2 (adora3),
alpha fibrinogen intron 4 (fiba), and von Willebrand Factor intron 11 (vWF)] were amplified, using primers and
annealing temperatures given in Table 5. Amplifications
were either carried out in 10 μl reactions containing a final
concentration of 0.25 μM of each primer, 3 mM MgCl2,
0.25 mM dNTPs, 1× amplification buffer and 0.025 U/μl
taq (Jumpstart, Sigma) or in 30 μl reactions containing a
final concentration of 0.33 μM of each primer, 3 mM
MgCl2, 0.166 mM dNTPs, 1× amplification buffer and
0.033 U/μl taq (Biotherm, Genecraft). Cycling conditions
were 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation, 45 s annealing and 1
min. elongation except for two loci. The adora3 fragment
only needed 45 s elongation due to its short fragment
length and the two overlapping cytb fragments were
amplified using 1 min. for all three steps. Amplification of
the museum samples was carried out in 30 μl reactions
containing a final concentration of 0.33 μM of each
primer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.166 mM dNTPs, 1× amplification
buffer and 0.033 U/μl taq (Biotherm, Genecraft). Cycling
conditions were 50 cycles of 1 min. denaturation, 1 min.
annealing and 30 s elongation. All amplifications of
museum samples were verified by replication in a second
independent lab. Wax-mediated Hot Start PCR was used
on all 30 μl reactions to increase specificity and yield. PCR
products were purified employing Montage™ PCR Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) according to manufacturer's instructions. For a little more than half of the
nuclear sequences, due to multiple polymorphic sites in
heterozygous individuals, PCR products were cloned into
a pGEM vector (pGEM™-T EasyVector System I, Promega),
averaging three clones per polymorphic sequence. Both
strands of all PCR products were sequenced, using the

respective primer pair used for amplification and standard
vector primers M13F and M13R for the cloned products,
employing the BigDye™ Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism™ 3100Avant-Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

bilities (PP) for each split and a phylogram with mean
branch lengths were calculated from the posterior density
of trees using MrBayes v3.1.2 [55,56]. Phylogenetic trees
were visualized using TreeEdit v1.0a10 [59] and FigTree
v1.0 [60].

Phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencher 4.7
(Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and
manually checked by eye. Subsequently, sequences were
collapsed into haplotypes using MacClade 4.05 [51]. Haplotype data sets were used for all subsequent Maximum
Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. For
all mtDNA analyses cytb and cox2 fragments were concatenated, resulting in an alignment of 1824 bp. GenBank,
museum and field sample sequences were collapsed into
haplotypes separately, since, due to missing data, unambiguous assignment was not possible. Uncorrected "p"
distances for the cytb locus were calculated as implemented in PAUP* v4.0b10 [52]. Optimal nucleotide substitution models for each locus were chosen using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as implemented in
Modeltest v3.7 [53]. All ML analyses were conducted
using a genetic algorithm approach in Garli v0.951 [54].
In Garli only the model specifications settings were
adjusted according to the respective data set; all other settings were left at their default value. Ten replicates were
run for each data set to verify consistency in log likelihood
(lnL) scores and tree topologies. Maximum-likelihood
bootstrap percentages (BP) were estimated in Garli by performing 500 pseudoreplicate runs on each nuclear data
set and 100 pseudoreplicates on the mtDNA data set.
PAUP* v4.0b10 was then used to calculate a majority-rule
consensus tree for each data set.

Statistical parsimony haplotype networks were constructed for each nuclear locus using the program TCS version 1.21 [61] for each individual nuclear locus. A 95%
connection limit was used and gaps were treated as missing data.

Bayesian analyses were conducted on a concatenated
cytb+cox2 mtDNA data set and on the individual nuclear
loci using MrBayes v3.1.2 [55,56]. For the mtDNA analyses, a partitioned analysis was performed treating the cytb
and cox2 genes as separate partitions, each with their own
DNA substitution models. In all analyses we used four
Monte Carlo markov chains (MCMC) with the default
temperature of 0.2. Analyses were run for ten million generations with tree and parameter sampling occurring every
100 generations. Flat priors were assumed for the model
parameters including the proportion of invariable sites
and the gamma shape parameter of rate variation among
sites. The first 25% of samples were discarded as burnin,
leaving 75,001 trees per run. The adequacy of this burnin
and convergence of all parameters were assessed by examining the uncorrected potential scale reduction factor
(PSRF) [57] as calculated by MrBayes v3.1.2 [55,56],
which should approach 1 as runs converge and visual
inspection of the trace of the parameters across generations using the software Tracer v1.3 [58]. Posterior proba-

Population structure
A Bayesian population assignment test implemented in
Structure v2.2 [62] was used to infer population structure
based on a combined genotypic matrix from all four loci
(adora3, fiba, vWF, and mtDNA) and also on the three
locus nuclear matrix. An admixture model was used with
correlated allele frequencies and no linkage among loci.
For each number of populations assumed (K = 1 to K =
10) we performed 50 replicate runs. The four-locus data
set was run with a burnin of 500,000 MCMC generations
and 4 million subsequent generations. The three locus
nuclear data set was run with a burnin of 250,000 generations and 1 million subsequent generations. The adequacy of the burnin and subsequent length of the MCMC
chain was checked visually by plotting the parameters α
and the lnL against the number of generations. In order to
detect the favored number of genetic groups, an ad-hoc
statistic ΔK [40] was calculated. In addition, a pairwise
comparison of the 50 runs for each K was carried out using
the perl script Simcoeff [63]. This procedure is based on
the estimated membership fractions generated by Structure for a given K. The similarity coefficient for a pair of
structure runs reflects the proportion of identical membership of individuals assigned through the Monte Carlo
process. The proportion of runs resulting in 95% of the
coefficients being equal is used to assess the stability of
the cluster allocations.

The clustering pattern for the run with the highest probability (estimated log probability of the data) for K = 2 to K
= 6 was visualized using Microsoft® Excel® v11.3.3. Membership coefficients with posterior probabilities under
0.05 were disregarded and proportionally added to the
remaining membership coefficients. Therefore, in Fig. 6,
some individuals show membership in fewer than K clusters.
