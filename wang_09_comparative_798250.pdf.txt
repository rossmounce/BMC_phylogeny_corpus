Abstract
Background: Sorghum is the first C4 plant and the second grass with a full genome sequence
available. This makes it possible to perform a whole-genome-level exploration of C4 pathway
evolution by comparing key photosynthetic enzyme genes in sorghum, maize (C4) and rice (C3),
and to investigate a long-standing hypothesis that a reservoir of duplicated genes is a prerequisite
for the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from a C3 progenitor.
Results: We show that both whole-genome and individual gene duplication have contributed to
the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. The C4 gene isoforms show differential duplicability, with
some C4 genes being recruited from whole genome duplication duplicates by multiple modes of
functional innovation. The sorghum and maize carbonic anhydrase genes display a novel mode of
new gene formation, with recursive tandem duplication and gene fusion accompanied by adaptive
evolution to produce C4 genes with one to three functional units. Other C4 enzymes in sorghum
and maize also show evidence of adaptive evolution, though differing in level and mode. Intriguingly,
a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene in the C3 plant rice has also been evolving rapidly and
shows evidence of adaptive evolution, although lacking key mutations that are characteristic of C4
metabolism. We also found evidence that both gene redundancy and alternative splicing may have
sheltered the evolution of new function.
Conclusions: Gene duplication followed by functional innovation is common to evolution of most
but not all C4 genes. The apparently long time-lag between the availability of duplicates for
recruitment into C4 and the appearance of C4 grasses, together with the heterogeneity of origins
of C4 genes, suggests that there may have been a long transition process before the establishment
of C4 photosynthesis.

cells, where CO2 is released to yield pyruvate by the decarbox-

Many of the most productive crops in agriculture use the C4
photosynthetic pathway. Despite their multiple origins, they
are all characterized by high rates of photosynthesis and efficient use of water and nitrogen. As a morphological and biochemical innovation [1], the C4 photosynthetic pathway is
proposed to have been an adaptation to hot, dry environments or CO2 deficiency [2-5]. The C4 pathway independently
appeared at least 50 times during angiosperm evolution [6,7].
Multiple origins of the C4 pathway within some angiosperm
families [8,9] imply that its evolution may not be complex,
perhaps suggesting that there may have been genetic predeposition in some C3 plants to C4 evolution [6].
The high photosynthetic capacity of C4 plants is due to their
unique mode of CO2 assimilation, featuring strict compartmentation of photosynthetic enzymes into two distinct cell
types, mesophyll and bundle-sheath (illustrated in Figure 1
for the NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) type of C4 pathway). First, CO2 assimilation is carried out in mesophyll cells.
The primary carboxylating enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase (PEPC), together with carbonic anhydrase (CA),
which is crucial to facilitating rapid equilibrium between CO2
and

CO2 to produce a C4 acid, oxaloacetate. In NADP-ME-type C4
species, oxaloacetate is then converted to another C4 acid,

ylating NADP-ME. The released CO2 concentrates around the
secondary carboxylase, Rubisco, and is reassimilated by it
through the Calvin cycle. Pyruvate is transferred back into
mesophyll cells and catalyzed by pyruvate orthophosphate
dikinase (PPDK) to regenerate the primary CO2 acceptor,
phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphorylation of a conserved serine
residue close to the amino-terminal end of the PEPC polypeptide is essential to its activity by reducing sensitivity to the
feedback inhibitor malate and a catalyst named PEPC kinase
(PPCK). C4 photosynthesis results in more efficient carbon
assimilation at high temperatures because its combination of
morphological and biochemical features reduce photorespiration, a loss of CO2 that occurs during C3 photosynthesis at
high temperatures [10]. PPDK regulatory protein (PPDKRP), a bifunctional serine/threonine kinase-phosphatase,
catalyzes both the ADP-dependent inactivation and the Pidependent activation of PPDK [11].
The evolution of a novel biochemical pathway is based on the
creation of new genes, or functional changes in existing genes.
Gene duplication has been recognized as one of the principal
mechanisms of the evolution of new genes. Genes encoding
enzymes of the C4 cycle often belong to gene families having

multiple copies. For example, in maize and sorghum, a single
C4 PEPC gene and other non-C4 isoforms were discovered
[12], whereas in Flaveria trinervia, a C4 eudicot, multiple
copies of C4 PEPC genes were found [13]. These findings led
to the proposition that gene duplication, followed by functional innovation, was the genetic foundation for photosynthetic pathway transformation [14].

Results

All plant genomes, including grass genomes, have been
enriched with duplicated genes derived from tandem duplications, single-gene duplications, and large-scale or wholegenome duplications [15-18]. A whole-genome duplication
(WGD) occurred in a grass ancestor approximately 70 million
years ago (mya), before the divergence of the panicoid,
oryzoid, pooid, and other major cereal lineages [19,20]. A preliminary analysis of sorghum genome data suggested that
duplicated genes from various sources have expanded the
sizes of some families of C4 genes and their non-C4 isoforms
[21]. However, different duplicated gene pairs often have
divergent fates [22]. While most duplicated genes are lost,
gene retention in some functional groups produces large gene
families in plants [15,19,20]. Together with other lines of evidence, these have led to the interesting proposition of differential gene duplicability [23,24], or duplication-resistance
[25], due to possible gene dosage imbalance, which can be
deleterious [26]. Even when duplicated genes survive, there is
rarely strong evidence supporting possible functional innovation [27].
Most C4 plants are grasses, and it has been inferred that C4
photosynthesis first arose in grasses during the Oligocene
epoch (24 to 35 mya) [28,29]. Sorghum and maize, thought to
have diverged from a common ancestor approximately 12 to
15 mya [21], are both in the Andropogoneae tribe, which is
entirely composed of C4 plants [8]. Sorghum, a NADP-MEtype C4 plant grown for food, feed, fiber and fuel, is the second grass and the first C4 plant with its full genome sequence
available [21]. The first grass genome sequenced was rice, a
C3 plant. The availability of two grass genome sequences
using different types of photosynthesis provides a valuable
opportunity to explore C4 pathway evolution. In the present
research, by using a comparative genomic approach and phylogenetic analysis, we compared C4 genes and their non-C4
isoforms in sorghum, maize and rice. The aims of this study
are to investigate: the role of gene duplication in the evolution
of C4 enzyme genes; the role of adaptive evolution in C4 pathway formation; the long-standing hypothesis that a reservoir
of duplicated genes has been a prerequisite of C4 pathway
evolution [14]; and whether codon usage bias has contributed
to C4 gene evolution, as previously suggested [30]. Our
results will help to clarify the evolution of the C4 pathway and
may benefit efforts to transform C3 plants, such as rice, to C4
photosynthesis [31].

PEPC enzyme genes
Grass PEPC enzyme genes form a small gene family. There
are five plant-type and one bacteria-type PEPC
(Sb03g008410 and Os01g0110700) [32] gene isoforms in
sorghum and rice, respectively, excepting two likely pseudogenized rice isoforms (Os01g0208800, Os09g0315700) having only 217 and 70 codons. There is one sorghum C4 PEPC
[33,34], Sb10g021330 (Table S1 in Additional data file 1). Previous characterization indicated that its transcripts are more
than 20 times more abundant in mesophyll than in bundlesheath cells [35] (Table S2 in Additional data file 1).
By analysis of gene colinearity, we investigated how genome
duplication has affected the PEPC gene families in rice and
sorghum. The PEPC gene in rice that is most similar to the
sorghum C4 PEPC is Os01g0208700, sharing 73% amino acid
identity. This similarity raised the possibility that the two
genes are orthologous. Although the two genes under consideration are not in colinear locations, single-gene translocation is not rare in grasses [36]. The outparalogs, homologs
produced by WGD in the common ancestor of sorghum and
rice, of the sorghum C4 PEPC gene are located at the expected
homoeologous locations in both sorghum and rice
(Sb04g008720 and Os02g0244700). The rice gene
Os01g0208700 and the C4 genes are grouped together, and
outparalogs (Os02g0244700 and Sb04g008720) of the sorghum C4 gene form a sister group on the phylogenetic tree.
The pattern can be explained if Os01g0208700 were orthologous to the sorghum C4 PEPC gene, implied by their high
sequence similarity and shared high GC content (detailed
below). In our view, the most parsimonious explanation of
these data is that the oryzoid (rice) ortholog was translocated
after the sorghum-rice (panicoid-oryzoid) divergence, then
the panicoid (sorghum) ortholog was recruited into the C4
pathway. We cannot falsify a model invoking independent
loss of alternative homeologs in sorghum (panicoids) and rice
(oryzoids), respectively, although this model seems improbable in that such loss of alternative homoeologs has only
occurred for approximately 1.8 to 3% of genome-wide gene
duplicates in these taxa [21]. The other rice and sorghum
PEPC genes form four orthologous pairs. Whether the genes
from different orthologous groups are outparalogs could not
be supported by colinearity inference associated with the
pan-cereal genome duplication.
Grass PEPC genes show high GC content, like many other
grass genes, apparently as a result of changes after the monocot-dicot split but before the radiation of the grasses [37]. The
evolution of C4 PEPC genes in sorghum and maize was previously proposed to have been accompanied by GC elevation,
resulting in codon usage bias [38]. We found that C4 PEPC
genes do have higher GC content than other sorghum and
maize PEPC genes, especially at the third codon sites (GC3).
The sorghum and maize C4 PEPC genes have a GC3 content
of approximately 84%, significantly higher than other genes

in both species (Table S3 in Additional data file 1). The suspected rice ortholog Os01g0208700 has even higher GC3
content, approximately 92%. In contrast, the GC3 content of
all Arabidopsis PEPC genes is <43%. This shows that the
higher GC content in the C4 PEPC genes may not be related to
the evolution of C4 function, as discussed below.

possible pseudogenized rice gene (Additional data file 2). We
found the genes to be in two groups, with one containing
plant-type and the other bacteria-type PEPC genes. Careful
inspection suggested problems with the tree, for orthologous
genes were not grouped together as expected. After removing
the bacteria-type genes and rooting the subtree containing
the C4 genes with Arabidopsis PEPC genes, we obtained a
tree in which orthologs are grouped together as expected (Figure 2a). The sorghum and maize C4 genes are on a remarkably long branch, suggesting that they are rapidly evolving

C4 PEPC genes show evidence of adaptive evolution. To characterize the evolution of C4 PEPC genes, we aligned the
sequences and constructed gene trees without involving the

compared to the other genes, and implying possible adaptive
selection during the evolution of the C4 pathway, consistent
with a previous proposal [39].

between the two species (Figure 2b). These rice and sorghum
isoforms correspond to four maize isoforms (ZmPPCK1 to
ZmPPCK4; Figure 2b), with ZmPPCK2 and ZmPPCK3 likely
produced in maize after its divergence from a lineage shared
with sorghum. The sorghum C4 PPCK is encoded by
Sb04g036570, and its maize ortholog is ZmPPCK1. Their C4
nature is supported by evidence that their expression is lightinduced and their transcripts are more abundant in mesophyll than bundle-sheath cells [30]. In contrast, the expression of sorghum and maize non-C4 isoforms is not light- but
cycloheximide-affected [30]. The outparalogs of the sorghum
C4 gene and its rice ortholog were likely lost before the two
species split, whereas the other four isoforms are outparalogs.

Maximum likelihood analysis supports possible adaptive evolution of C4 PEPC genes. First, characterization of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rates (Ka) supports rapid
evolution of the C4 genes and their rice ortholog. Under a
free-parameter model, Ka values are >0.048 on branches
leading to C4 genes and their rice ortholog after the rice-sorghum split, as compared to ≤0.02 on branches leading to the
non-C4 isoforms. Second, the C4 genes may have been positively selected. The Ka/Ks ratio is nearly tenfold higher (0.71)
on the branch leading to the last common ancestor of the sorghum and maize C4 genes than on other branches after the
rice-sorghum split (≤0.08). Though the ratio is <1, we propose that the striking difference in Ka/Ks between C4 and
non-C4 genes may be evidence of positive selection in the C4
genes for the following reasons: the criterion Ka/Ks > 1 has
been proposed to be unduly stringent to infer positive selection [40]; the maximum likelihood analysis is conservative, as
reported previously [27]; and the similar slow evolutionary
changes in all non-C4 genes in sorghum, maize and rice (Figure 1a) imply elevated rates in the C4 genes, rather than purifying selection in the non-C4 genes.
C4 PEPC genes show elevated and aggregated amino acid
substitutions especially in function-specific regions, providing further evidence of adaptive evolution. Comparison to
their outparalogs and their nearest outgroup sequence suggests that C4 PEPC genes have accumulated approximately
100 putative substitutions over their full length (Table 1), far
more than non-C4 PEPC genes. The substitutions are referred
to as putative since we cannot rule out the possibility of parallel and reverse mutations. However, the extremely significant difference strongly supports divergent evolution of C4
and non-C4 PEPC genes. The amino acid substitutions are
not uniformly distributed along the lengths of the C4 genes
(Table S4 in Additional data file 1), but concentrated in the
carboxy-terminal half, including the critical mutation S780
(the serine at position 780 of the maize C4 PEPC protein that
is essential to relieving feedback inhibition by malate [41]).
This is consistent with previous findings [42].
Surprisingly, Os01g0208700 has also accumulated significantly more mutations than expected, and has a relatively
larger selection pressure than other non-C4 PEPC genes,
implying that it may also be under adaptive selection (Table 1;
Table S4 in Additional data file 1), as further discussed below.

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R68

Wang et al. R68.5

Maximum likelihood analysis and inference of aggregated
amino acid substitutions found no evidence of adaptive selection during C4 PPCK gene evolution (Table S4 in Additional
data file 1).
Consistent with a previous report [30], all studied grass PPCK
genes have extremely high GC content, with a GC3 content
from 88 to 97% (Table S3 in Additional data file 1). The grass
C4 and non-C4 PPCK genes have similar GC content.

NADP-MDH enzyme genes
There are two NADP-MDH enzyme genes in sorghum (Table
S1 in Additional data file 1), the non-C4 gene Sb07g023910
and the C4 gene Sb07g023920, tandemly located as previously reported [43]. They have only one homolog in both rice
and maize [44], with the rice homolog (Os08g0562100) at the
expected colinear location. This suggests that the NADPMDH WGD outparalog was lost before the sorghum-rice split.
Each of the sorghum tandem genes has an ortholog in Vetiveria and Saccharum, respectively [44], suggesting that the
tandem duplication occurred before the divergence of sorghum and Vetiveria, but after the sorghum-maize split, an
inference further supported by gene tree analysis in that they
are more similar to one another than to the single maize
homolog (Figure 2c).
The C4 NADP-MDH gene shows an interesting mode of adaptive evolution. Though the C4 NADP-MDH genes have accumulated more mutations than non-C4 genes (Table S4 in
Additional data file 1), neither maximum likelihood analysis
nor the inference of aggregated amino acid substitution suggest adaptive selection. However, the sorghum C3 and C4
genes were likely to have been produced by an ancestral C4
gene through duplication. One of the duplicates may have lost
its C4 function as it is not light-induced and only constitutively expressed [43].

PPCK enzyme genes
PPCK gene families have been enriched by duplication events,
including the pan-cereal WGD and tandem duplication. We
identified three PPCK gene isoforms in both sorghum and
rice, respectively (Table S1 in Additional data file 1), which are
in one-to-one correspondence in expected colinear locations

The NADP-MDH genes are chloroplastic. A chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) having approximately 40 amino acids is
identified in all the genes from grasses and Arabidopsis
(Additional data file 3). This indicates that the cTP was
present in the common ancestor of angiosperms. Non-chloro-

plastic NADP-MDH genes identified in the sorghum genome
share less than 40% protein sequence similarity with the
chloroplastic ones.

(Table S2 in Additional data file 1). Its rice ortholog
(Os05g0405000) can be inferred based on both gene trees
(Figure 2e) and gene colinearity. The other rice and sorghum
isoforms are orthologous to one another. Whether the four
isoforms are outparalogs produced by the WGD could not be
determined by gene colinearity inference due to possible gene
translocations. However, synonymous nucleotide substitution rates and gene tree topologies support that the rice and
sorghum paralogs were produced before the two species
diverged, and approximately at the time of the pan-cereal
WGD.

All of the grass NADP-MDH enzyme genes studied have elevated GC content compared to the Arabidopsis ortholog,
especially regarding GC3 (50% versus 40%; Table S3 in Additional data file 1). The grass C4 genes have slightly higher GC
content than the non-C4 genes.

NADP-ME enzyme genes
The NADP-ME gene family has been gradually expanding due
to tandem duplication and the pan-cereal WGD. We identified five and four NADP-ME enzyme genes in sorghum and
rice, respectively (Table S1 in Additional data file 1). The sorghum C4 gene is Sb03g003230, whose transcript is abundant
in bundle-sheath but not mesophyll cells [35] (Table S2 in
Additional data file 1). The C4 gene has a tandem duplicate
that may have been produced before the sorghum-maize split
based on gene similarity and tree topology (Figure 2d). The
tandem genes share the same rice ortholog (Os01g0188400)
at the expected colinear location, and their WGD duplicates
can be found at the expected colinear location in both species.
The other sorghum and rice NADP-ME genes form two
orthologous pairs, having also remained at the colinear locations predicted based on the pan-cereal duplication.
Maximum likelihood analysis indicates that the sorghum and
maize C4 NADP-ME genes are under positive selection. The
branches leading to their two closest ancestral nodes have a
Ka/Ks ratio > 1 (P-value = 8 × 10-10). Moreover, the C4 genes
have a significant abundance of amino acid substitutions
(Table 1; Table S4 in Additional data file 1). The most affected
regions in sorghum and maize overlap with one another, from
residue 141 to residue 230 in sorghum, and from residue 69 to
residue 181 in maize.
The grass NADP-ME genes have higher GC content than their
Arabidopsis homologs (Table S3 in Additional data file 1).
The highest GC content (GC3 > 82%) is found not in the C4
genes but in their outparalogs, Sb09g005810 and
Os05g0186300.
The C4 genes, their tandem paralogs in sorghum and maize,
and their rice ortholog all share an approximately 39 amino
acid cTP that is absent from their WGD paralogs in grasses, or
homologs in Arabidopsis. This seems to suggest that the cTP
was acquired by one member of a duplicated gene pair after
the pan-grass WGD but before the sorghum-rice divergence.

PPDK enzyme genes
Sorghum and rice both have two PPDK enzyme genes (Table
S1 in Additional data file 1). The sorghum C4 PPDK gene
(Sb09g019930) is identified based on its approximately 90%
amino acid identity with the maize C4 gene. Its transcript is
abundant in mesophyll rather than bundle-sheath cells [35]

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R68

Wang et al. R68.7

There are two PPDK genes in maize [10]. One of them
encodes both a C4 transcript and a cytosolic transcript, controlled by distinct upstream regulatory elements [45]. The C4
copy has an extra exon encoding a cTP at a site upstream of
the cytosolic gene [46]. We found that the sorghum C4 PPDK
gene is highly similar to its maize counterpart along their
respective full lengths, indicating their origin in a common
maize-sorghum ancestor. The other maize PPDK gene has
only a partial DNA sequence and, therefore, has been avoided
in the present evolutionary analysis. A similarity search
against the maize bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
sequences indicates that it is on a different chromosome
(chromosome 8) from the C4 gene (chromosome 6). The
maize counterpart of the other sorghum PPDK isoform has
not yet been identified in sequenced BACs.
The C4 PPDK genes may have experienced adaptive evolution. While maximum likelihood analysis did not find evidence of adaptive evolution of C4 PPDK genes (Figure 2e), the
C4 genes have accumulated significantly or nearly significantly more amino acid substitutions than their rice
orthologs, particularly in the region from approximately residue 207 to approximately residue 620 (Table 1; Table S4 in
Additional data file 1).
All grass PPDK genes have higher GC content than their Arabidopsis homologs (Table S3 in Additional data file 1), with
the C4 genes themselves being highest in GC content (GC3
content approximately 61 to 70%).
All of the characterized PPDK isoform sequences from
grasses and Arabidopsis share an approximately 20 amino
acid cTP (Additional data file 3), suggesting its origin before
the monocot-dicot split.

PPDK-RP enzyme genes
Tandem duplication contributed to the expansion of PPDKRP genes. Using the maize PPDK-RP gene sequence as a
query, we determined its possible sorghum ortholog,
Sb02g035190, which has two tandem paralogs. Their rice
ortholog, Os07g0530600, was identified in the anticipated
colinear region. However, we failed to find their WGD outparalogs in both sorghum and rice, suggesting possible gene loss
in their common ancestor.

Gene trees indicate that the tandem duplication events may
have occurred before the sorghum-maize divergence, but
after the sorghum-rice divergence (Figure 2f). Maximum likelihood analysis suggests that both lineages leading to the
maize PPDK-RP gene and its sorghum ortholog, and other
isoforms, have been under significant positive selection (Ka/
Ks >> 1, P-value = 2.5 × 10-8), implying possible functional
changes in both lineages. Compared to their rice ortholog,
sorghum and maize PPDK-RP genes have accumulated significantly more amino acid substitutions (Table 1; Table S4 in
Additional data file 1), providing supporting evidence for
functional innovation.

CA enzyme genes

Both the C4 and non-C4 PPDK-RP genes in sorghum have
similar GC content (GC3 content approximately 57 to 60%),
while the maize PPDK-RP gene has higher GC content (GC3
content approximately 67%), especially in the third codon
sites (Table S3 in Additional data file 1). All these grass PPDKRP genes show higher GC content than their Arabidopsis
homologs.

Sb03g029170

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R68

Wang et al. R68.9

Tandem duplication has profoundly affected the evolution of
CA genes. There are two types of CA enzymes, the alpha and
beta types in sorghum [21], and C4 CA genes are the beta type
[47]. Here, we focus on beta-type CA genes. Our analysis indicates that there are four beta-type CA enzyme gene isoforms
in sorghum, forming a tandem gene cluster with the same
transcriptional orientation, on chromosome 3 (Figure 3a;
Table S1 in Additional data file 1). Among them are two possible C4 genes (Sb03g029170 and Sb03g029180), which were
shown by previous analysis of transcript abundance to be
highly expressed in mesophyll but not bundle-sheath cells
(Table S2 in Additional data file 1). The other two genes
include one non-C4 gene (Sb03g029190) and one probable
pseudogene (Sb03g029200) with only truncated coding
sequence, a large DNA insertion in its second exon, and accumulated point mutations. These tandem genes have a common rice ortholog (Os01g0639900) at the expected colinear
location, indicating that gene family expansion has occurred
in sorghum (and maize; see below) since divergence from
rice. The WGD outparalogs were not identified in either

Tandem duplication and fusion of CA genes in sorghum. Postulated evolution of sorghum CA genes through four tandem duplication events and a
gene fusion event is displayed. We show distribution and structures of CA genes, and their peptide-encoding exons, on sorghum chromosome 3. Genes
are shown as the large arrows with differently colored outlines and exons are shown as colored blocks contained in the arrows. Homologous exons are in
the same color. A chloroplast transit peptide is in dark red. A tandem duplication event is shown by two small black arrows pointing in divergent
directions, and a gene fusion event is shown by two small black arrows pointing in convergent directions. A new gene produced by tandem duplication is
shown with an arrow in a new color not used by the ancestral genes. A gene produced by fusion of two neighboring genes is shown as a bipartite
structure, each part with the color of one of the fused genes. A stop codon mutation is shown by a lightning-bolt symbol, and an exon-splitting event by a
narrow triangle.

genome, implying possible gene loss after the WGD and
before the rice-sorghum split.

A gene tree of functional units suggested that C4 CA genes
may have been affected by positive selection. According to the
free-parameter model of the maximum likelihood approach,
we found that the two functional unit groups revealed above
may have experienced positive selection, in that Ka/Ks > 1
(Figure 2f), though this possibility is not significantly supported by statistical tests or by amino acid substitution analysis (Table S4 in Additional data file 1).

The two sorghum C4 CA genes differ in cDNA length [35]. We
found that the larger C4 CA gene may have evolved by fusing
two neighboring CA genes produced by tandem duplication.
In spite of possible alternative splicing programs,
Sb03g029170 has a gene length of approximately 10.4 kbp
and includes 13 exons, as compared to 4.5 kbp in length and
6 exons for Sb03g029180. Pairwise dotplots between
Sb03g029170 and Sb03g029180 show the former has an
internal repeat structure absent from the latter (Figure 3ab;
Additional data file 4). The duplication involves the last six of
seven exons and intervening introns 1 to 6 of the ancestral
gene (Figure 4a). Comparatively, the other sorghum genes
have only exons 2 to 7, assumed to be a functional unit, both
lacking the first exon in Sb03g029170, which encodes a cTP.
This implies that several duplication events have recursively
produced extra copies of the functional unit. Some functional
units act as independent genes, while the other fused with the
complete one to form an expanded gene including two functional units. We found that this fusion involved mutation of
the stop codon in the leading gene. Each functional unit starts
with an ATG codon, which we infer may increase the possibility of alternative splicing. This inference is supported by the
finding that Sb03g029170 may have two distinct transcripts,
identified by cDNA HHU69 and HHU22, respectively (Table
S2 in Additional data file 1). The two transcripts have distinct
lengths, 2,100 and 1,200 bp, respectively, with the expression
of the longer one being light-inducible and C4-related but the
shorter one not [35]. The non-C4 gene, Sb03g029190, has a
normal structure (Figure 3c) and the pseudogene,
Sb03g029200, has a truncated structure.
The tandem duplication and gene fusion are shared by sorghum and maize, and maize furthermore has additional
duplication. Interestingly, we found that the maize CA
enzyme genes have two and three functional units, respectively (Figure 3de; Additional data file 4), implying further
DNA sequence duplication and gene fusion in the maize lineage. Mutation of stop codons was also found in the leading
gene sequences. Rice and Arabidopsis genes have only one
functional unit preceded by a cTP.
To clarify the evolution of CA genes, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the functional units (Figure 2f). The first
functional units from sorghum and maize genes are grouped
together, the second and third maize units and that of
Sb03g029180 were in another group, and the rice gene and
non-C4 sorghum gene Sb03g029190 were outgroups. This
suggests the origin of the extra functional units to be after the
Panicoideae-Ehrhartoideae divergence but before the sorghum-maize divergence, and continuing in the maize lineage.
A possible evolutionary process in sorghum is illustrated in
Figure 4b.

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R68

Wang et al. R68.10

Excepting the possibly pseudogenized sorghum CA gene, the
grass isoforms have very high GC content (GC3 content 82 to
92%), much higher than that of the Arabidopsis orthologs
(Table S3 in Additional data file 1). The non-C4 gene,
Sb03g029190, rather than any of the C4 genes, has the highest GC content in sorghum.

Discussion
Gene duplication and C4 pathway evolution
In the case of the C4 pathway, the evolution of a novel biological pathway required the availability of gene families with
multiple members, in which modification of both expression
patterns and functional domains led to new adaptive phenotypes. An intuitive idea is that genetic novelty formation is
simplified by exploiting available 'construction bricks', and
the pathway genes that we are aware of were either 'subverted' from existing functions or were created through modification of existing genes. Three mechanisms of new gene
formation have been proposed [48]: duplication of pre-existing genes followed by neofunctionalization; creation of
mosaic genes from parts of other genes; and de novo invention of genes from DNA sequences.
Duplicated genes have long been suggested to contribute to
the evolution of new biological functions. As early as 1932,
Haldane suggested that gene duplication events might have
contributed new genetic materials because they create initially identical copies of genes, which could be altered later to
produce new genes without disadvantage to the organism
[49]. Ohno proposed that gene duplication played an essential role in evolution [50], pointed out the importance that
WGD might have had on speciation, and hypothesized that at
least one WGD event facilitated the evolution of vertebrates
[51]. This hypothesis has been supported by evidence from
various gene families, and from the whole genome sequences
of several metazoans [52,53]. Plant genomes have experienced recurring WGDs [15,54-57], and perhaps all
angiosperms are ancient polyploids [54]. These polyploidy
events contribute to the creation of important developmental
and regulatory genes [58-61], and may have played an important role in the origin and diversification of the angiosperms
[62]. About 20 million years before the divergence of the
major grass clades [19,20], the ancestral grass genome was
affected by a WGD, possibly preceded by still more ancient
duplication events [17,63]. It is tempting to link this WGD to
the evolutionary success of grasses, now including more than

10,000 species and covering about 20% of the Earth's land
surface [64], though such a link has not yet been adequately
justified.

thought to have evolved, after the divergence of sorghum and
rice, but before the divergence of sorghum and maize.

Gene duplication has been related to the evolution of the C4
pathway, based on the finding that C4 enzyme genes are usually from families having multiple copies [14]. Consequently,
an ability to create and maintain large numbers of duplicated
genes has been supposed to be one precondition for certain
taxa to develop C4 photosynthesis [6,14]. It was even suggested that evolution of the C4 pathway was largely a story of
gene duplication while plants were still in the ancestral C3
state [14].
Different genes in the C4 pathway were affected in different
ways and at different times by gene duplication. Firstly, the
approximately 70-mya pan-cereal WGD enriched the reservoir of some genes but not others. For example, in sorghum,
both duplicated copies were preserved for PEPC and NADPME genes, and one of the copies of each gene produced by
WGD was later recruited into the C4 pathway. This finding
highlights the contribution of WGD to the evolution of C4
photosynthesis. However, for NADP-MDH, CA, PPDK-RP
and PPCK enzyme genes, one of the WGD duplicates was
probably lost. For CA, NADP-ME, and PPDK-RP, tandem
gains of new genes after the sorghum-rice divergence appears
to have preceded C4 evolution. This seems to suggest that earlier availability of the pan-cereal duplicated copies was not by
itself sufficient to initiate C4 evolution, although it is not clear
whether what was lacking was genetic (a part of the machinery) or environmental (a sufficiently strong selective advantage to drive the transition).

Adaptive evolution of C4 genes
After duplication, there is evidence that some C4 genes experienced adaptive evolution; however, selection pressures and
evolutionary modes have varied. Both maximum likelihood
inference and patterns of aggregated amino acid differences
indicate that the C4 NADP-ME and PPDK-RP enzyme genes
have been under strong selective pressure. Maximum likelihood inference also implies that CA C4 enzymes have experienced positive selection, while aggregated amino acid
differences indicate that C4 PEPC and PPDK genes may also
have been under positive selection. The sorghum C4 genes of
PPCK and NADP-MDH enzymes have also accumulated more
substitutions than their rice orthologs, though the difference
is not statistically significant. Compared to their rice
orthologs, PEPC and NADP-MDH C4 genes evolve at a faster
rate, providing further evidence of adaptation.
In many cases (NADP-ME, CA, PEPC) evidence from C4

members only - the non-C4 homologs in C4 plants show no
evidence of adaptive evolution, although the PEPC gene does
show evidence in rice (C3). Further, the strongest evidence of
adaptive evolution is in the period when the C4 pathway is

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R68

Wang et al. R68.11

Adaptive evolution is further supported by patterns of gene
expression shown in previous reports. PEPC, PPDK, and CA
C4 genes are expressed approximately 20 times more in sorghum mesophyll than bundle-sheath cells, while NADP-ME
C4 genes are expressed much more in bundle-sheath than
mesophyll cells [35]. The study of Flaveria intermediates
shows that PEPC activity is increased approximately 40 times
from C3 to full C4 species [65], and the NADP-ME activity is
approximately 9 times higher in veins than mesophyll cells
[66].
During the process of adaptive evolution, a duplicated gene
may gradually acquire a new function (neofunctionalization)
or subdivide the functions of its progenitor with the other
duplicated copy (subfunctionalization). Laboratory evolution
experiments indicated that an evolving new gene can initially
acquire increased fitness for a new function without losing its
original function [67]. This implies that a neofunctionalization process may begin with an initial subfunctionalization
step, an implication that has been supported by theory [68].
It is unclear how long such a step may take. Here, we found
that neofunctionalization of C3 genes to function in C4 photosynthesis could take a long time. Previous publications
found that both C4 and non-C4 sorghum NADP-MDH genes
were expressed in green leaves, though the C4 gene had
higher transcript accumulation [43,44]. Together with maximum likelihood analysis involving more genes and different
grasses, this finding indicated that C4 and non-C4 sorghum
NADP-MDH genes, produced before sorghum-Vetiveria
divergence, have experienced subfunctionalization [44].
Sequence alignment here indicates that the sorghum non-C4
gene has been affected by three insertions and one deletion in
its amino-terminal coding sequence, suggesting functional
innovation. Regardless of whether the process is a division of
functions of their progenitor gene, or evolution of a novel
function in the non-C4 gene, co-expression, albeit at divergent levels, of the two genes in green leaves suggests that the
process may not yet be finished.
In addition to the possible sheltering effect of a duplicated
copy when evolving genetic novelty, alternative splicing may
further shelter functional changes. The maize PPDK gene
(and probably also its sorghum ortholog) encoding C4 transcripts also encodes cytosolic transcripts. Their rice homolog
also has a dual promoter [69], implying that natural selection
may have utilized this pre-existing functional duality to
evolve C4 function. If C4 transcripts are products of a novel
function, and non-C4 transcripts due to the original function,
the genes may have retained the original function for millions
of years while evolving a novel function. The state of bifunctionality may continue until possible genetic incompatibility,
if any, accumulates to a point intolerable to fitness. Maize
PPDK may not be the only case of such gene bifunctionality in

the C4 pathway. As shown above, the sorghum CA gene,
Sb03g029170, seems to have similar bifunctionality, encoding both C4 and non-C4 transcripts. Since its internally
repeating structure may have been produced before sorghum-maize divergence, its maize homologs also share this
bifunctionality, which may have existed for millions of years.
These multiple cases in which alternative splicing may contribute a possible sheltering effect during evolution of new
function by C4 genes imply that it (alternative splicing) may
participate in other cases of evolution of genetic novelty.

duplication may contribute to the formation of more complex
structures, with more functional binding sites making them
work more efficiently to stabilize the balance between CO2

We found that the sorghum and maize C4 PEPC genes are on
a long branch of their gene tree, grouped together with their
suspected rice ortholog, showing possible adaptive evolution
based on both a high Ka/Ks ratio and elevated amino acid
substitution. It is intriguing to ask whether possible adaptive
evolution in the rice PEPC gene could be a foundation toward
a new origin of the C4 pathway, or instead indicates non-C4
functional adaptation. Scrutiny of the rice PEPC sequence
revealed only 2 of 12 amino acid substitutions that were previously inferred to be positively selected in C4 genes [42],
and, in particular, it lacks the critical fixed mutation S780
that is shared by C4 PEPC genes in other angiosperms
[41,65]. This rice gene was classified into the ppc-B1 group
[42], found only in the C3 grasses, suggesting that its adaptive
evolution is not leading to C4 photosynthesis, but possibly to
other functional novelty.
Adaptive evolution of PEPC may have some valuable implications for the discovery of multiple groups of PEPC genes
defined previously [42]. In some C4 grasses there are different groups of genes, such as ppc-B2 and ppc-C4; while
another group of genes, ppc-B1, are found in only C3 grasses.
These findings show that, in the C4 lineages after their divergence from the C3 lineages but perhaps prior to the evolution
of the C4 pathway itself, further gene duplication(s) may have
contributed to the establishment of C4 photosynthesis.

A novel mode of gene evolution
The CA enzyme genes display a novel mode of gene evolution
and functional adaptation. As shown above, sorghum and
maize C4 CA enzymes have one, two or three functional
domains, produced through recursive duplications followed
by a fusion process involving stop codon mutations in the
leading domains. There have been at least four tandem duplication events in sorghum and its ancestral genomes. These
tandem duplications started before sorghum-maize divergence, and appear to have continued in the maize lineage. The
recurrence of tandem duplications together with the subsequent merger process may have acted as a mode of adaptive
evolution. The present CA enzymes are beta-type, comprising
a dimer having four zinc ions bound to the structure as active
sites. Besides dimers, these enzymes can form tetramers, hexamers or octamers [47], suggesting that the dimer may be a
building block. Recruiting extra domains through tandem

−
and HCO 3 . The expanded gene structure of these sorghum

and maize CA genes are unusual, since the cDNAs of Urochloa paniculata and Flaveria bidentis, both C4 plants, are normal in size [70]. Nonetheless, there is precedent for internal
repetition of CA gene structure in red algae, Porphyridium
purpureum, resulting in two sets of functional binding sites
[71]. This independent evolution of internally repeating structure in CA genes supports our hypothesis that such structure
may confer functional advantages.
We found that the sorghum and maize C4 CA genes share a
cTP, which had not been expected since the enzymes were not
found to be chloroplastically localized in C4 plants. In C3
plants, the most abundant CA activity is in the chloroplast
stroma, while in C4 plants, the exact location of CA is less
clear [47], but the most abundant CA activity is localized in
the cytosol of mesophyll cells [72]. The cTP of sorghum and
maize C4 CA genes is similar to that of the Arabidopsis CA
genes, suggesting its existence before monocot-dicot divergence. The preservation of a cTP in C4 genes for tens of millions of years cannot be explained as a mere relic but suggests
possible multiple functionality. This inference is at least partially supported by the discovery of divergent functions
implemented by two different transcripts produced by the
single sorghum C4 CA gene, Sb03g029170. As shown above,
the expression of the longer transcript is light-inducible,
while that of the shorter one is not, indicating that the longer
but not the shorter transcript may be involved in the C4 pathway.

A long transition time from C3 to C4 photosynthesis
Several evolutionary models have been proposed to explain
the formation of the C4 pathway [73-75]. In summary, seven
significant phases are recognized toward successful establishment of C4 photosynthesis: general preconditioning (for
example, gene duplication); anatomical preconditioning (for
example, close veins); enhancement of bundle-sheath
organelles; establishment of photorespiratory CO2 pump and
transformation of glycine decarboxylase to bundle-sheath
cells; enhancement of PEPC activity; integration; and optimization [6]. Although many biological and anatomical changes
are needed, multiple origins in tens of angiosperm families
suggest that it is not so difficult to evolve a novel C4 pathway.
However, from an evolutionary viewpoint it is still interesting
to ask whether a transition process of gene functional changes
and/or enhancement is necessary before the final establishment, and how long such a transition might take. There has
been a long time-lag between the initial decrease in CO2 concentration and the appearance of C4 plants. The initial
decrease in CO2 concentration started at least 100 mya [6],
while molecular clock analyses suggest that the earliest C4

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/6/R68

Genome Biology 2009,

plants (grasses) appeared about 24 to 35 mya [28,29] One
proposed explanation for the time-lag was the lack of a sufficient reservoir of duplicated and neofunctionalized C3 genes
to support C4 evolution [14]. Here, we found that the genes of
key enzymes, such as PEPC and NADP-ME, were among the
duplicated copies produced by the WGD approximately 70
mya [19,20]. Once again we note, however, that availability of
the pan-cereal duplicated copies was not by itself sufficient to
initiate C4 evolution, since some were lost from the common
cereal ancestor and then, after divergence from rice, had to
reduplicate in the sorghum-maize ancestor before C4 evolution could occur.

Thus, there is no clear evidence supporting co-variation
between codon usage bias and C4 gene evolution. Base composition variation in grass genes has been a hot topic involving transcription, translation, modification and mutational
bias [81-83].

Differential duplicability of C4 genes and their non-C4
isoforms
The above characterization of gene duplication shows differential duplicability of C4 genes and their isoforms in grasses.
Evidence from yeast indicates that gene redundancy tends to
be preserved among some of the central proteins in the cellular interaction network [76]. Tens of plant genes were suggested to be duplication-resistant, and undergo convergent
restoration to singleton status following several independent
genome duplications [25]. The differential duplicability could
be explained by gene dosage effects, organismal complexity,
protein interaction centrality and protein domain preference
[24-26,76]. Here, we have shown that some gene families,
including PEPC, PPCK, CA, and NADP-ME genes, have been
expanded by gene duplication, but not others such as PPDK
genes. The families expanded by gene duplication tend to be
multiply functional, such as PEPC and NADP-ME [14]. Different PEPC gene isoforms take on specific roles, including
the regulation of ion balance, the production of amino-group
acceptor molecules in symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and the
initial fixation of C in C4 photosynthesis and Crassulacean
acid metabolism [77]. NADP-ME catalyzes the oxidative
breakdown of malate to form CO2 and pyruvate in the C4
pathway. Its non-C4 functions include the provision of carbon skeletons for ammonia assimilation [78] and reductant
for wound-induced production of lignin and flavonoids
[79,80]. CA genes are also prone to duplication, which may
enhance their ability to form more complex structures, as discussed above. Though further duplication is not required
when a former C3 gene is finally co-opted for C4 roles [14], we
found that the sorghum NADP-MDH C4 gene did experience
a tandem duplication event, with only one duplicated copy
preserving the C4 function through possible subfunctionalization [44]. This implies that the sorghum NADP-MDH C4
gene itself may be duplication-resistant.

Potential contribution to engineering new C4 plants
A comprehensive characterization of the C4 pathway will help
not only to understand how C4 photosynthesis evolves, but
also may benefit crop improvement efforts. Of singular relevance are efforts to transform C3 plants into C4 plants. To
perform such a transformation, one strategy is to incorporate
the C4 pathway into C3 plants through recombinant DNA
technology [84]. The strategy succeeds in transferring C4
genes into C3 plants and yielding high levels of C4 enzymes in
desired locations [85,86]. It is of great interest to transform
rice, a staple food for more than half of the world's population, to perform C4 function, as reviewed in a recent publication [31]. However, combined overproduction of C4 enzymes
(PEPC, PPDK, NADP-ME, and NADP-MDH) resulted in only
slightly higher levels of CO2 assimilation than in wild-type
rice [87]. This might indicate that not all components needed
for C4 photosynthesis are known. There must be some transporters involved and there might also be some unknown regulatory factors. Knowledge of the complete sorghum genome
might help to identify such components. As also shown above,
though often not statistically significant, the sorghum and
maize C4 genes appear to have been under adaptive evolution
in different modes and levels, and show different duplicability. These findings may provide clues toward a successful
transformation to C4 photosynthesis. Alternatively, perhaps
adaptations such as we have suggested in the PEPC gene in C3
lineages have mitigated the perceived weaknesses of C3 photosynthesis.
Subtle differences in the C4 pathways used in different
grasses are worthy of further investigation as well. For example, if our hypothesis is correct that internally repeating structure in CA genes may confer functional advantages, then
engineering of the maize trimer into sorghum (for example)
may be advantageous. Likewise, exploration of still more
recent polyploids such as sugarcane might yield even more
complex CA alleles. Tandem duplication of C4 NADP-MDH
following the sorghum-maize divergence does not appear to
have been essential to C4 evolution; indeed, one of the tandem genes appears to have lost C4 specificity. However, careful scrutiny of the physiological consequences of this change
might suggest benefits that could be transferred to other
crops.

C4 pathway and codon usage bias
GC content elevation has resulted in codon usage bias [37],
which has been hypothesized by some to have contributed to
C4 adaptive evolution [30]. As shown above, though the grass
C4 genes and their isoforms always have a higher GC content
than their Arabidopsis counterparts, there is often a non-C4
grass gene having higher GC content than the C4 one(s).

Conclusions
Gene duplication and C4 pathway evolution
Both WGD and single-gene duplication have contributed to
C4 pathway evolution in sorghum and maize. Some C4 genes
(PEPC, PPCK, and NADP-ME C4 genes) were recruited from

duplicates produced by WGD. Sorghum NADP-MDH, NADPME and PPDK-RP C4 genes were affected by tandem duplication, with only one of the resulting copies involved in the C4
pathway. C4 genes show divergent duplicability. PEPC,
NADP-ME, PPCK, and CA gene families were expanded by
recursive duplication events, showing a duplication-philic
nature, whereas NADP-MDH and PPDK are likely duplication-phobic. Further supporting evidence is that only one
copy of NADP-MDH C4 gene duplicates preserves the C4
function.

known genes against sorghum [89] and rice [90] gene models
by running BLAST [91] (E-value < 1 × 10-5), we identified
other enzyme genes in these organisms. By characterizing
sequence similarity and constructing gene trees, possible C4
genes were determined. The enzymes revealed here were
linked to expression data reported previously [35] by comparing cDNA segments to gene sequences using BLAST.

Adaptive evolution divergent in mode and level
We found evidence of adaptive evolution of most C4 genes
studied. However, the mode and level of adaptation is divergent among C4 genes. Adaptive evolution is achieved though
rapid mutations in DNA sequences, aggregated amino acid
substitutions, and/or considerable increases of expression
levels in specific cells. Besides gene redundancy, we found
that alternative splicing may have also sheltered the evolution
of new function. Our analysis supports previous findings that
maximum likelihood inference may be too conservative to
find adaptive evolution. We found no evidence of co-variation
between codon usage bias and C4 pathway development.

Wang et al. R68.14

Gene colinearity inference
The potential gene homology information defined by running
BLAST was used as the input for MCscan [92] to find homologous gene pairs in colinearity. The built-in scoring scheme
for MCscan is min(-log10E_value, 50) for every matching
gene pair and -1 for each 10 kb distance between anchors, and
blocks that had scores >300 were kept. The resulting syntenic
chains were evaluated using a procedure by ColinearScan [17]
and an E-value < 1 × 10-10 was used as a significance cutoff.

Gene phylogeny construction

Grass CA genes have evolved in a specific pattern featuring
recursive tandem duplication and neighboring gene fusion,
which produced distinct isoforms having one to three functional units. Two sorghum C4 CA genes have one and two
functional units, while two characterized maize C4 CA genes
have two and three functional units, respectively. The elongation of these genes by recruiting extra domains may contribute to the formation of more complex protein structures, as
often observed in plants.

We constructed phylogenetic trees using several approaches,
including the neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, minimal evolution, and maximum parsimony methods, implemented in NADP-MEGA [93], PHYML [94], and PHYLIP
[95], on both DNA and protein sequences. While running
PHYML, parameters were set as adopted previously [42].
Bootstrap tests were performed with 100 repeats to produce
percentage values, showing the stability of their topology. The
trees mostly agree with one another. When there is inconsistency, the tree most strongly supported by bootstrap values
was adopted for the subsequent adaptive evolution inference.
For example, the trees of CA functional units were inconsistent among methods, and the best-supported neighbor-joining tree produced by protein sequences was adopted for
further analysis.

A long transition time from C3 to C4 photosynthesis

Maximum likelihood inference of adaptive evolution

The hypothesis that a reservoir of duplicated genes in ancestral C3 plants was a prerequisite for C4 pathway development
is only partially supported by present findings that some C4
genes were recruited from the duplicates. Availability of the
pan-cereal duplicated copies was not sufficient to initiate C4
evolution, since some were lost from the common cereal
ancestor, then had to reduplicate in the sorghum-maize
ancestor before C4 evolution could occur. However, C4 gene
isoforms show quite divergent duplicability, and there has
been quite a long time-lag between the gene duplication
events and the appearance of C4 grasses. These findings suggest a long transition process, including different modes of
functional innovation, before the eventual establishment of
C4 photosynthesis.

The tree constructed for the group of C4 enzyme genes and
their non-C4 isoforms was used to perform further maximum
likelihood analysis using the Codeml program in PAML [96].
To detect whether a specific C4 gene had been positively
selected, we compared two types of competing models: a freeratio model and a ratio-restriction model [97]. The free-ratio
model assumes an independent Ka/Ks ratio for each branch,
whereas the latter forces the Ka/Ks ratio to be 1 on the specific
branch to be tested for positive selection, and for the other
branches assumes independent ratios. Each model will produce a likelihood, and the twofold difference between them
follows a Chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom.

selection pressure by detecting possible aggregation of amino

against the aligned outgroup sequence. A replacement site is
identified in the C4 sequence that differs from the corresponding sites in both the homologous sequence and the outgroup sequence, which are identical. We found the number of
all replacements, m, grouping the C4 and non-C4 protein
sequences. If the occurrences of these replacement sites are
