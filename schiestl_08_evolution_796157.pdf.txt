Abstract
Background: Within the astonishing diversity of orchid pollination systems, sexual deception is
one of the most stunning. An example is the genus Ophrys, where plants attract male bees as
pollinators by mimicking female mating signals. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes) are often the
key signal for this chemical mimicry. Here we investigate the evolution of these key compounds
within Orchidinae by mapping their production in flowers of selected species onto their estimated
phylogeny.
Results: We found that alkenes, at least in trace amounts, were present in 18 of 20 investigated
species together representing 10 genera. Thus, the reconstruction of ancestral state for alkeneproduction showed that this is a primitive character state in Ophrys, and can be interpreted as a
preadaptation for the evolution of sexual deception. Four of the investigated species, namely Ophrys
sphegodes, Serapias lingua, S. cordigera, and Anacamptis papilionacea, that are pollinated primarily by
male bees, produced significantly larger amounts and a greater number of different alkenes than the
species pollinated either primarily by female bees or other insects.
Conclusion: We suggest that high amounts of alkenes evolved for the attraction of primarily male
bees as pollinators by sensory exploitation, and discuss possible driving forces for the evolution of
pollination by male bees.

Background
Animal-pollinated plants produce floral signals to advertise their rewards, or mimic attractive signals to cheat pollinating animals [1-6]. Floral mimicry can involve
imitations of rewarding flowers, egg deposition substrates
such as fungi, faeces or rotting meat, or sexual signals. Floral mimicry systems, as well as pollination systems in general, are surprisingly varied, even within single plant
families. Orchids are a classic example, famous for their
unparalleled diversity of pollination systems [7]. For
example, 19 different specialized pollination systems

were recognised within 27 investigated species in the
genus Disa [8]. Orchids have also evolved some of the best
known and elaborated pollination systems, such as pollination by fragrance collecting bees [9] or sexual deception
[10]. Not surprisingly, evolutionary patterns and mechanisms of such diversity have long puzzled researchers
[11].
Plant pollinator interactions often depend on a combination of different signals [12-14]. Whereas floral colour is
frequently included in studies on evolutionary patterns of

pollination systems, floral scent has been largely ignored.
However, floral scent can be the key signal for the attraction of certain pollinator guilds (e.g. nocturnal moths, fragrance-collecting euglossine bees [9,15,16]) and plays a
decisive role in the evolution of several mimicry systems
(e.g. carrion mimicry, sexual deception) [17-19]. Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of floral
scent is needed to achieve a more conclusive view on the
mechanisms and patterns of evolution of pollination systems.
Sexual mimicry, or sexual deception, is well known in
European, Australian and Neotropical orchids, and is
likely more widely distributed than currently known
(summarized in [4]). This pollination system functions
primarily through the species-specific imitation of female
sex pheromones, in combination with less specific visual
and tactile stimuli produced by the flowers. The mechanism of this chemical mimicry was first elucidated by Schiestl et al. [17], who showed that specific patterns of nalkenes (unsaturated hydrocarbons) play a key role in
orchids of the genus Ophrys (Orchideae, Orchidinae) for
the attraction of male pollinators to the flowers. Alkanes,
saturated analogues of n-alkenes, were shown to have a
synergistic effect by increasing the intensity of male
responses [20].
Both alkanes and alkenes are well-known compounds
that have been chemically characterized in several organisms. They are present in plant and insect cuticular wax
layers, with the primary function of reducing water evaporation [21-23]. Whereas long chain alkanes are widespread and abundant in plant and insect waxes, alkenes
have, up to now, only been found in few species, e.g. in
the Rosa and Aloe spp. perianth, as well as sugar cane wax,
and spike wax of Agropyron intermedium [24,25]. They generally decrease the melting temperature of the wax layer
[26] and increase its permeability [21]. Being present at
the outer layer of the plant, alkanes and alkenes are also
important in mediating plant herbivore interactions, both
through physical properties and semiochemical (i.e. volatile signalling) functions [27,28]. In insects, alkanes and
alkenes have similar physiological functions in the wax
layer of the cuticle, but also act as pheromones in
intraspecific communication, by mediating kin recognition or attraction of the opposite sex [29]. Alkenes are well
known as sex pheromone compounds in flies, for example, 9-tricosene is a sex pheromone component of Musca
domestica, whereas Drosophila melanogaster uses 7-tricosene and 7-pentacosene [30]. Among solitary bees,
alkanes and alkenes are also the male-attracting pheromones in many species [31]. Thus, there is little doubt that
many insect species use alkenes as communication signals, and consequently, there are ample opportunities for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/27

plants to mimic such signals to abuse insects as pollinators, such as by "sexual swindle" in Ophrys [17].
A powerful approach to trace evolutionary trajectories of
pollination systems is their mapping onto phylogenies
[32], which has often highlighted their high evolutionary
flexibility within evolutionary lineages [8,33]. Fewer studies have combined phylogenies with ecological or physiological studies to investigate the evolution of specific
floral traits in relation to their functions, or change of
functions [34-39]. Such studies are important for detecting evolutionary changes in the functions of key traits,
and can help explain flexibility in evolutionary lineages,
as well as adaptive radiations triggered by key innovations.
Although it is clear that Ophrys produces alkenes for sexual
deception, it is an open question whether alkene production was a key innovation for the evolution of this pollination system, or represents a preadaptation, that
primarily had a non-reproductive function in the Orchidinae. This study aims to test these hypotheses by mapping
the production, diversity, and amount of alkenes on a
phylogeny of the investigated Orchidinae, asking the following question: (1) is the production of alkenes as pheromone-mimics in Ophrys a plesiomorphic state for this
genus? (2) Is there is any link between alkene-production
and pollination syndrome among the investigated species?

Results
Occurrence of alkenes
Of 19 European orchid species representing 9 genera
(Table 1), n-alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons) of chain
lengths 21 – 29 were present in labella of all species, but
in varying relative and absolute abundance (Table 2).
Odd chain-lengths alkanes with 23 carbon atoms or more
were especially abundant (Table 2). Alkenes (unsaturated
hydrocarbons), although generally less common, were
also widespread among the investigated species (Fig. 1).
In total, 17 species produced at least trace amounts of
alkenes in their cuticular waxes (Table 2). In only two species (Orchis provincialis, Neotinea lactea), no alkenes could
be detected. In 11 species, alkenes constituted more than
10% of all analysed compounds (Table 2). Some species
(Serapias lingua, S. cordigera, Gymnadenia conopsea,
Neotinea ustulata) produced 50% or a higher proportion
of alkenes in their wax layer. The highest relative abundance of a single alkene was found in N. ustulata, where
11-tricosene (C23en) represented 42% of all the compounds found in this species. The South African Disa bivalvata, used here as outgroup, produced 81.9 μg (80.6%)
alkanes and 19.7 μg (19.4%) alkenes in a single labellum.

Evolution of alkenes in Ophrys
The strict consensus tree among the six resulting cladograms (length: 401 steps), with a topology broadly congruent to those reported in previous phylogenetic analyses
with broader datasets [40-42], is shown in Fig. 1. As
expected, in spite of the fact that the majority of the terminal clades have bootstrap values above 50% (bootstrap
values > 50% are shown in Fig. 1), the relationships
among the major clades into which the ingroup is split are
weakly supported, as observed in previous published
analyses [40-42].

The MacClade reconstruction of alkenes production unequivocally indicated alkenes presence as the primitive
character state in the group and with only two independent losses in single species (O. provincialis, N. lactea). Concordantly, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (data not
shown), constrained with the model of nucleotide evolution that fits the data best, (TrN, -lnL = 3378.8591 [43];
gamma distribution shape parameter α = 0.808; base frequencies: freqA = 0.2639, freqC = 0.1830, freqG = 0.2151,
freqT = 0.3381; substitution rate: [A-C] = 1.000, [A-G] =
2.425, [A-T] = 1.000, [C-G] = 1.000, [C-T] = 3.919, [G-T]
= 1.000), was topologically similar to the tree topology of
parsimony analysis and strongly supported the presence
of alkenes as the ancestral state for the character.
Alkenes and pollination
In our analyses, pollinator category had a significant effect
on the absolute amounts of alkenes (Fig. 2; ANOVA, F2,14

= 12.05, P = 0.001) and numbers of alkenes (Kruskal-Wallis, Chi2 = 9.0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.01) produced by the flowers.
Species pollinated mostly or solely by male bees (Ophrys
sphegodes, Serapias lingua, S. cordigera, Anacamptis papilionacea; group 2) produced significantly higher absolute
amounts of alkenes (LSD Post Hoc, group 1–2: P < 0.001;
2–3 P = 0.002; Fig. 2) and greater number of alkenes with
different double bond position (Mann-Whitney U-test:
group 1–2: P = 0.01; 2–3: P = 0.006) than the other
groups. The "female bees" group was not significantly different from the "moth, beetles, flies" group for amount of
alkenes (LSD Post Hoc, P = 0.174; Fig. 2) and number of
alkenes (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.84). The amount of
alkanes did not differ significantly among the groups
(ANOVA, F2,14 = 3.69, P = 0.051); however, number of
alkanes was different (Kruskal Wallis Chi2 = 6.8 d.f. = 2 P
= 0.03), but post-hoc tests did not show any significant
differences among the groups.
The relative amounts of alkanes/alkenes were also significantly different between the pollinator categories
(ANOVA, F2,14 = 21.35, P < 0.001). Comparison among
groups revealed all groups to be different from each other
(LSD Post Hoc, P < 0.001) except "male bees" and "moth,
beetles, flies" (P = 0.17). Species with relatively low absolute amounts but unusually high proportions of alkenes
were Neotinea ustulata, Dactylorhiza maculata, Gymnadenia
conopsea, G. odoratissima, and G. rhellicani (Table 2).
Neotinea ustulata produced unusually high proportions of
11-tricosene and 11-pentacosene. Dactylorhiza maculata

Discussion
The evolution of floral odour compounds mediating pollinator attraction is of general interest and can help us to
understand evolutionary mechanisms in pollination systems. A relatively well understood pollination system is
sexual deception in the European genus Ophrys, where
mechanisms of pollinator attraction involve the mimicry
of alkene patterns of female bees to sexually attract the
male pollinators [17]. Until now it was, however, unclear
whether the biosynthetic ability to produce these compounds represents an evolutionary novelty of Ophrys
within subtribe Orchidinae. In our approach, combining
phylogeny and chemical ecology, we found that the production of alkenes is widespread among related orchids.
Besides that, other species primarily pollinated by male
bees produce similar high amounts and diversity of
alkenes as Ophrys. Thus, alkene production itself is likely
a plesiomorphic character in Ophrys, having evolved ear-

lier than the pollination syndrome of sexual deception.
We suggest that production of alkenes is an example of a
preadaptation that evolved from a primary vegetative to
reproductive function and enabled the orchids to exploit
various behavioural patterns of their pollinators through
chemical mimicry.
Alkenes are preadaptations for sexual deception
The concept of preadaptation in floral traits presumes that
existing traits have acquired a new function, which can be
in the form of a "transfer exaptation" (new function
replaced the old) or "addition exaptation" (new function
added to the old) [36]. The identification of floral exaptations is dependent on a combination of phylogenetic
analyses and ecological studies investigating functions of
floral traits [44]. A well known example is the tropical
vine genus Dalechampia, where resins are produced primarily for herbivore deterrence [35]; this trait was a preadaptation for the evolution of pollination systems based on
resin reward [34,36]. Preadaptations of pollinators have
also been assumed to influence the evolution of specialized pollination systems, such as that observed in the

Absolute amounts of alkanes (black bars) and alkenes (grey

pollinated primarily by male bees (Ophrys sphegodes, Serapias
lingua, S. cordigera, Anacamptis papilionacea) produce significantly more alkenes (ANOVA, F2,14 = 5.89, P = 0.01; see text
for posthoc statistics) than the other groups of species. The
amounts of alkanes were not significantly different among the
pollinator-defined groups.

tionship cannot be inferred by the existing phylogenies
that have low bootstrap support for the basal relationship
among genera [40,42]. It is thus not clear whether the production of large amounts of alkenes in Ophrys is an evolutionary novelty in the genus or inherited from a common
ancestor with Serapias. Considering the latter possibility,
the elaborate morphology of Ophrys labella, with often
dark color and UV-reflecting "mirror-patterns", that is
unique to the genus, should be considered as the key
innovation for sexual deception. However, earlier studies
suggest that Serapias is pollinated by sexual deception as
well [49]. Thus, a better understanding of the pollination
system in Serapias, as well as phylogenies with better resolution of relationships among the major groups are necessary to resolve this issue.
Alkenes and their role in plant-pollinator interactions
The pattern of strong alkene production in the nonrewarding Ophrys, Serapias, and Anacamptis papilionacea is
paralleled by a common use of primarily male bees as pollinators in these orchids. A strong alkene production, as
shown by the significantly higher absolute amounts in
these species, is the likely prerequisite for these low volatile compounds to act as semiochemicals. Since male bees
use alkenes for chemical communication [31], these
orchids likely use alkenes to manipulate the behaviour of
their pollinators.

yucca – yucca moth mutualism [45]. However, some traits
of pollinators in this system are, on the contrary, synapomorphies inferred to be key innovations [46]. For the evolution of sexual deception within Orchidinae, we suggest
an evolutionary scenario similar to Dalechampia. The ability to produce alkenes, (i.e. the genes encoding the necessary enzymes) is likely an ancestral trait – a preadaptation
with vegetative function in the cuticular wax layer. The
transition into male-pollinator attraction was achieved by
producing increased amounts and different double-bond
varieties of alkenes, since female bees produce large
amounts of alkenes in specific patterns of double-bond
positions [31]. Additionally, morphological changes in
the labellum evolved to achieve mimicry of shape, colour
and pilosity of female bees [10].

In Serapias, pollination by male bees sleeping in the flowers has been proposed [50], but earlier studies suggested
that males of the bee, Ceratina cucurbita, are sexually
attracted to the flowers and search for females within
them [49]. These flowers may thus mimic either a nest
entrance or virgin females sitting in the flowers, to entice
males to enter the flowers. The high abundance and diversity of alkenes suggest that alkenes mediate such signalling. Anacamptis papilionacea is pollinated by patrolling
male bees of the genus Eucera [51], and the alkenes produced by the flowers may also render the flowers more
attractive for the males. In both species, further investigations are necessary to clarify details of the pollination system and the inferred role of floral odor.

Plants of the genus Ophrys generally produce large
amounts of different alkenes. Erdmann [47] found
alkenes in all 18 analysed species, including O. speculum,
that uses oxo- and hydroxy acids for pollinator attraction
[48]. In this species, even buds and pollinia produce
alkenes. We found that large amounts and diversity of
alkenes with different double bond positions in Ophrys
was also shared among other species of Orchidinae,
namely the two outcrossing representatives of Serapias,
and Anacamptis papilionacea. Although several evidences,
including chromosome number, suggest that Ophrys, Serapias, and Anacamptis are closely related, the exact rela-

Besides their role as pheromones in bees, alkenes are also
important semiochemicals in flies. This may explain the
unusually strong production of 11-tricosen and 11-pentacosene in Neotinea ustulata, that is pollinated specifically
by the tachinid fly, Tachina (Echinomyia) mangnicornis
[52]. Many fly species use alkenes as mating signals; one
example is Drosophila virilis, with 11-pentacosene as its
major sex pheromone component [53]. Female flies also
use host-pheromones for host location, but little is yet
known about the chemical identity of these signals [54]. It
is possible that the flower-produced alkenes are also
involved in the attraction of the pollinator via false host-

or mating signals, and future investigations on the pollination system in this species may also prove interesting.
The moderate to high production of alkenes in the
rewarding orchid clade (including Gymnadenia conopsea,
G. odoratissima, G. rhellicani, Platanthera bifolia, together
with the nectarless Dactylorhiza maculata), may be
explained as retention of the primitive state of alkene production.
Why employ male bees as pollinators?
Male insects invest more time and energy in mating
behaviour than females, which spend more time feeding
and collecting food for brood care [55]. Therefore,
females are generally considered as more efficient pollinators [56]. Whole guilds of plants, however, are specialized
for pollination by male bees, e.g. Euglossine pollinated
plants that produce fragrance as a reward for the pollinators [57,58], Oncocyclus irises being pollinated primarily
by night sheltering Eucera males [59], and orchids that
mimic specific model plants, such as Cephalanthera rubra
and Diuris maculata [60,61]. Since the behaviour of male
and female bees differ, the resulting pollination patterns
can be assumed to be different, too. Whereas food-seeking
female bees are more efficient pollinators, males conduct
longer-distance visits and thus contribute relatively more
to outcrossing [56]. Indeed, it has been predicted that fragrance-collecting male euglossine bees, as well as males
pollinating sexually deceptive orchids, mediate long distance pollen flow [62-65]. As self-compatibility and
inbreeding depression are widespread in orchids [66], distance of pollen flow may impact strongly on the quality of
seeds produced [67]. Additionally, pollination by exploitation of reproductive behaviour of males is often more
specific, particularly in sexually deceptive orchids and
orchids pollinated by fragrance-collecting euglossine bees
[68,69]. Specificity may decrease pollen loss, a factor that
is likely important in orchids, given their highly efficient
pollination via pollinia. Collectively, pollination by male
bees may be advantageous by mediating specific and
long-distance pollen flow, and selection may thus favour
floral signals that attract primarily males.
Mechanisms of attracting males
We suggest that the evolution of male bees as pollinators
in the deceptive pollination systems developed by Ophrys,
Anacamptis papilionacea and possibly also Serapias was
achieved by "sensory exploitation". This concept has been
developed in the framework of sexual selection and states
that sensory preference in females drives the evolution of
male signals [70]. A similar scenario can be proposed for
the evolution of pheromone-imitations in response to
male pollinators. To attract male pollinators by pseudopheromones, the orchids hitchhike on pre-existing,
intraspecific communication channels. The existing reception system and behavioural preference of males for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/27

alkenes may have enabled the orchids to exploit this pollinator resource relatively easily, by increased production
of alkenes, with pre-existing enzyme systems.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we show that alkenes, the key signal for
pollinator attraction in the orchid genus Ophrys can be
interpreted as a preadaptation for the evolution of sexual
deception in the genus. High amounts of alkenes may
have evolved earlier in the evolutionary history in other
genera for the attraction of male bees as pollinators,
through hitchhiking on existing sensory and behavioural
preferences of the pollinators. Such parsimonious evolutionary pathways are probably widespread among the
diverse chemical communication systems of plants and
pollinators. If so, further insights are to be expected in
future studies combining phylogenetic and ecological
approaches.

Methods
Sample collection
For all scent (hexane extracts) collection, fresh, unpollinated flowers were used. Seven species (plants originating
from Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Parks, Southern Italy) were kept in the Naples Botanical Gardens in an
insect-tight cage; flowers of the other 13 species were collected from wild populations. One labellum of five individuals (if possible) or five labella of one individual
(Serapias cordigera, Himantoglossum hircinum, Platanthera
bifolia, Neotinea ustulata, Neotinea lactea) were extracted in
200 μl of hexane (Merck Uvasol) by shaking in a 2 ml vial
for 1 min. Afterwards, the labella were removed and the
sample stored at -20°C until analysis. Species, sampling
locations and their pollination mode are indicated in
Table 1 (for the nomenclatural authority of all listed
orchid species see [42].
Phylogeny and ancestral character state reconstruction
Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal ITS1 and 2
sequences of the selected taxa was carried out as described
in [41] by using Disa bivalvata (Diseae, Disinae,
Orchidaceae) as outgroup. Ingroup and outgroup species
choice was limited to those taxa for which scent data have
been collected. Briefly, Genbank available ribosomal
sequences were reduced to only ITS1 and ITS2 and alignment was accomplished by using Clustal W with GAPOPEN and GAPEXT parameters set to a value of 4 (for
details see [40,41]. The resulting matrix was then subjected to a parsimony analysis by using the software package MEGA 3.2, and bootstrap percentages [71] were
calculated with 500 replicates. As a framework for character reconstruction, we used the strict consensus tree
obtained in this analysis, and MacClade 4.0 [72] was used
to examine alkene production evolution within the
clades. MacClade determines character reconstruction by

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:27

parsimony, or if more than one state can be assigned to
branches, MacClade displays an equivocal pattern on
those branches [72]. Alkene production was designated as
unordered, with no assumptions of transformations
between states [72]. To estimate posterior probabilities for
individual nodes, a Bayesian phylogeny was inferred
using a variant of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm as implemented in the MrBayes software v3.1.2
[73]. Five Markov chains (four heated, one cold) were run
for 150,000 generations using random starting trees and
fixed model employed in branch length calculations.
Trees were sampled every 100 generations. To set prior
probabilities for the analysis (stationary frequencies of
character states, character substitution rate matrix, proportion of invariable sites and shape parameter of the gamma
distribution of the variation), hierarchical likelihood ratio
tests (hLRTs) were performed in MODELTEST v3.7 [74]
and the best-fitting model given the dataset was chosen.
Quantitative scent analysis
Before gas chromatographic analysis, 100 ng of octadecane (purity 99.8%, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were
added to all samples as an internal standard. One μl of the
sample was injected splitless into an Agilent 6890 N gas
chromatograph (GC; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,
USA) equipped with a HP5 column (5% Phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.32 mm ∅ × 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies). The column was equipped
with a 5 m × 0.53 mm diameter deactivated retention gap.
The GC was equipped with a flame ionization detector
(FID). Hydrogen served as carrier gas (2 ml/min, constant
flow mode) and nitrogen was used as make-up gas. The
injector temperature was kept at 300°C. The oven was
kept at 50°C for one minute and then heated to 300°C at
a rate of 10°C per minute and kept at 300°C for 20 minutes. Chromatogram outputs were recorded by the Chemstation program (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA)
for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The internal
standard method was applied to calculate absolute
amounts of scent compounds. To calculate relative
amounts, the absolute amounts of each compound was
divided by the sum of all compounds and multiplied by
100.
Qualitative scent analysis
For identification of compounds, one μl of each sample
was injected on column into a Trace GC Ultra with DSQ
II mass spectrometer (MS; Thermo Electron Corp., Milan,
Italy), equipped with the same column used for quantitative analysis. Helium served as the carrier gas (2 ml/min,
constant flow mode). The oven was kept at 45°C (1 min)
and then heated to 280°C at a rate of 10°C/min. The
transfer line to the MS was heated to 220°C. The ionsource of the MS was heated to 250°C, the MS was run in
full scan mode, starting after 5 min; 1.31 scans/s were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/27

done at a scan rate of 500.3 amu/s, and the mass range
was 50 – 420. Compounds were identified by comparison
of mass spectra and retention times with those of synthetic reference compounds. On a HP-5 column, alkenes
elute before the corresponding alkanes. Alkenes with the
same chain length but different position of the double
bond have reproducibly different retention times, so that
(Z)-11 elutes first, and (Z)-5 last. Rather than identifying
all compounds present in the extracts, we focussed on
straight chain saturated hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) and
unsaturated (n-alkenes) hydrocarbons with double bond
positions 5, 7, 9, or 11 and of chain lengths 21 – 29. These
compounds have been shown previously to be responsible for pollinator attraction in many Ophrys species (summarized by [4]). The isomeric configuration of the alkenes
was not determined in this study; however, until now, Zalkenes were primarily found in plant cuticles [21].
Statistical analysis
For the analysis of the relation between pollination syndrome and hydrocarbon production, the species were
classified into three main pollinator categories (Table 1)
according to the available information [49,75-77]. The
Bee-group was split into female and male, since male bees
are important and exclusive pollinators of some orchids.
Group (1) "female bees", comprised only deceptive species, with generalized food deception being predominant.
Group (2) "male bees", comprised sexual deception
(Ophrys), sleeping hole (the outcrossing Serapias spp.),
and pollination by patrolling Eucera males (A. papilionacea). Group (3) "moths, beetles, flies", with both rewarding and deceptive species. For most species, these
categories should be seen as quantitative estimations,
since few Mediterranean orchids are highly specialized
[77]. Two species were excluded from the analysis: Serapias parviflora, which is an autogamous species [78], and
Neotinea lactea, where the pollinators remain unknown.
For the comparison of absolute amounts of alkane/
alkene, all amounts were divided by the number of labella
sampled, to normalize the amounts to a single labellum.
The size of the labellum was estimated, by using published data on average length and width of labella [79],
calculating the product and dividing it by two (Table 1).
The absolute amounts of alkane and alkene were normalized to the size of the flowers by dividing it by this value
for labellum size. The resulting values were ng/mm2. An
ANOVA with LSD post-hoc tests was used to compare
absolute amounts of alkanes/alkenes among pollination
systems. A Kruskal-Wallis test with Mann-Whitney U-test
for post-hoc comparisons with the level of significance set
to 1% (Bonferroni correction) was used to compare the
number of alkanes/alkenes produced.
