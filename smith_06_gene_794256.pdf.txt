Abstract
Background: Because amphibians arise from a branch of the vertebrate evolutionary tree that is
juxtaposed between fishes and amniotes, they provide important comparative perspective for
reconstructing character changes that have occurred during vertebrate evolution. Here, we report
the first comparative study of vertebrate genome structure that includes a representative
amphibian. We used 491 transcribed sequences from a salamander (Ambystoma) genetic map and
whole genome assemblies for human, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebrafish, and the freshwater
pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis to compare gene orders and rearrangement rates.
Results: Ambystoma has experienced a rate of genome rearrangement that is substantially lower
than mammalian species but similar to that of chicken and fish. Overall, we found greater
conservation of genome structure between Ambystoma and tetrapod vertebrates, nevertheless,
57% of Ambystoma-fish orthologs are found in conserved syntenies of four or more genes.
Comparisons between Ambystoma and amniotes reveal extensive conservation of segmental
homology for 57% of the presumptive Ambystoma-amniote orthologs.
Conclusion: Our analyses suggest relatively constant interchromosomal rearrangement rates
from the euteleost ancestor to the origin of mammals and illustrate the utility of amphibian mapping
data in establishing ancestral amniote and tetrapod gene orders. Comparisons between Ambystoma
and amniotes reveal some of the key events that have structured the human genome since
diversification of the ancestral amniote lineage.

Background
Amphibians (salamanders, frogs, and cecilians) arise from
a branch of the vertebrate evolutionary tree that is juxtaposed between aquatic fishes and more terrestrial amniotes (Figure 1). This phylogenetic location therefore
positions amphibians to provide important comparative
perspective for reconstructing character changes that have
occurred during vertebrate evolution. For example, the
amphibian perspective is essential for understanding
molecular, developmental, and morphological changes of

appendages that are associated with the transformation of
obligatorily aquatic fish to terrestrial tetrapods [1-4]. In
addition, because amphibians are the most basal tetrapod
lineage, the amphibian perspective is essential for understanding the evolution of amniote characteristics among
the "higher vertebrate" groups. Although many studies
have exploited the phylogenetic position of amphibians
for comparative perspective, very few comparisons have
been made at the genome level. Here we present results
from the first broad-scale comparison of genome structure

between an amphibian and other representative vertebrate taxa.
One of the most fundamental structural characteristics of
genomes is the order in which protein-coding genes are
arranged on chromosomes. Gene order is determined
using one of several approaches, including physical mapping, linkage mapping, and whole genome sequencing.
The most powerful approach is whole genome sequencing
[5-9], but only if the final product is a complete (or nearly
complete) genome assembly. Physical mapping refers to
the direct localization of a gene to a whole or partial chromosome, for example by the method of somatic cell
hybridization [10-13] or chromosome in-situ hybridization [14-17]. In comparison to these physical genome
approaches, genetic linkage mapping refers to the
approach of estimating recombination frequencies
among loci (genes) in a segregating cross for the purpose
of ordering genes into linkage groups [e.g. [18]]. Ultimately, the genomic approach taken to order genes in a
particular species is determined by genome characteristics
and the availability of resources. For example, the
extremely large genome size of some amphibians makes it
difficult to justify a whole genome sequencing effort at
this time [19,20]. However, genetic linkage mapping is an
efficient strategy for amphibians because large numbers of
offspring can be obtained from segregating crosses, thus
allowing accurate estimates of map position [21].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/219

Until recently, there were few amphibian gene order data
available for comparative analyses of vertebrate genome
structure [22,23]. Much physical genome sequence has
been collected recently for an anuran amphibian (Xenopus
tropicalis), but this sequence has not yielded a complete
genome assembly and there are no large-scale genetic
maps for Xenopus that can be used in comparative studies
[24]. The recently developed genetic linkage map for the
salamander genus Ambystoma, however, now provides an
amphibian resource that can provide structural and evolutionary perspective at the genomic level [21]. Here we
report on the largest gene order dataset ever obtained for
an amphibian. We use this dataset to describe the extent
to which gene orders have been conserved between
Ambystoma and other representative vertebrate species
with assembled physical genome maps. We also describe
several examples that demonstrate the importance of the
amphibian genome perspective for reconstructing gene
orders of the ancestral tetrapod and amniote genomes,
and for understanding the importance of gene order rearrangement in vertebrate evolution.

Results
Identification of putative orthologs
We searched 491 protein-coding marker sequences from
the Ambystoma genetic map against the genome sequences
of human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), dog (Canis familiaris), chicken (Gallus gallus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and freshwater pufferfish
(Tetraodon nigroviridis) to identify presumptive orthologs.
For each search, we defined orthologs as the BLAT hit with
the highest bitscore, plus all other hits within 1% of the
highest bitscore. Using this definition, orthologs for 344
(70%) Ambystoma sequences were identified within the
genome of at least one species in the reference set. Alignment summaries for all presumptive Ambystoma-vertebrate orthologs are provided as supplementary data [see
Additional file 1]. The number of Ambystoma orthologs
varied among species, ranging from 237 – 322. A low proportion of Ambystoma orthologs aligned to more than one
presumptive ortholog in all comparisons (human, 4.0%;
dog, 6.0%; mouse, 8.4%; rat, 4.4%; chicken, 1.8%; T.
nigroviridis, 4.9%; zebrafish, 3.8%). In general, a greater
number of Ambystoma orthologs were identified among
amniote taxa versus fish taxa (Table 1). This suggests
greater conservation of orthologs among tetrapod taxa.

To gain insight into variation in genome coverage of
Ambystoma-vertebrate orthologies, we compared the distribution of Ambystoma-human orthologies to the
expected distribution under random sampling of human
loci (Table 2). We selected the human genome assembly
for this comparison [25] because the assembly is relatively
complete and contains a large number of gene annotations. The observed number of orthologs on three human

chromosomes (HSA1, 12, and 17) deviated significantly
from the expected number (p > 0.01). Notably, all three of
these chromosomes contained an excess of orthologies,
rather than a deficiency. A single human chromosome
(HSA4) contained a marginally significant deficiency of
Ambystoma orthologies (p = 0.50), however, given the
large number of comparisons, a similar deviation would
be expected to occur by chance. Comparisons with the

human genome assembly suggest that Ambystoma-amniote orthologies will provide coverage of most regions of
ancestral vertebrate genomes.
Orthologs for a majority of Ambystoma marker sequences
were identified in more than one reference genome (Figure 2). Of the 343 Ambystoma orthologs identified from all
searches, 292 (85%) yielded hits to five or more genomes.

all comparisons and there was considerable variation in λ
values (0.18 for Ambystoma vs. zebrafish and mouse to
0.33 for Ambystoma vs. chicken; see Table 1). Variable λ
values for Ambystoma-amniote comparisons illustrate the
importance of lineage specific effects, because all amniotes share the same divergence time. In this case of λ variability among amniotes, lower λ values for Ambystomamurid rodents indicate an increased rate of genome rearrangement in the murid rodent lineage.

Ambystoma orthologs that were identified among major vertebrate groups. Categories on the X-axes represent the total
number of species within each major vertebrate group that
yielded a presumptive Ambystoma ortholog.

A high proportion of Ambystoma-amniote orthologs were
identified from four or more of the amniote taxa (88%).
A lower proportion of Ambystoma-fish orthologs were
identified from both fish taxa (68%). The relatively lower
proportion of Ambystoma-fish orthologs may reflect lineage-specific gene losses and divergence that has occurred
between these fish species, or differences in completeness
of their genome assemblies. Below, we used Ambystoma
orthologies as characters to identify conserved syntenies
and gene orders and reconstruct key events in the evolution of vertebrate genomes.
Conservation of synteny
The association index λ describes the extent to which
chromosomal assignments of loci (genes) in one species
are predictive of chromosome assignments in another
species (see Methods). High λ values indicate high predictability; such values are expected when few inter-chromosomal rearrangements of genes occur between two
species after divergence from a common ancestor. Thus, λ
provides a measure of the combined effects of phylogenetic distance and lineage specific rearrangement rates on
the inter-chromosomal distribution of genes. We estimated λ for pairwise comparisons between Ambystoma
and each of the seven reference vertebrate genomes. Significant (non-zero) association indices were observed for

To obtain a more complete picture of genome similarity
we calculated pairwise λ values for all possible species
comparisons using two different datasets: 1) the set of all
genes that showed 1:1 orthology in comparisons between
Ambystoma each of the seven reference vertebrate genomes
(ranging from N = 170 for chicken-zebrafish to N = 309
for Ambystoma-human), and 2) a smaller set of genes (N =
110) in which 1:1 orthology was established among all
species. The cumulative gene set was expected to identify
a greater number of associations while the smaller set controlled for comparison-wise differences among the gene
sets used to estimate λ. The cumulative gene set yielded
slightly lower values of λ than the smaller set. For both
gene sets, λ was inversely correlated with phylogenetic distance (Figure 3) [see Additional file 2]. As before, we also
observed that λ varied substantially among species with
identical divergence times, consistent with lineage specific
variation in rearrangement rates. Notably, λ values for the
Ambystoma-chicken comparison are higher than or similar
to λ values calculated between chicken and mammals,
and similar to values calculated between murid rodents
and non-rodent mammals, despite differences in divergence time among these comparisons on the order of 60–
280 million years (Figure 1) [see Additional file 2]. To better understand the effect of divergence time on variation

in λ, we estimated the average rate of decrease in λ [(1-λ)/
divergence time)] for all pairwise comparisons. Figure 4
shows that interchromosomal rearrangement rates are
strikingly higher in murids and more variable among
mammals in comparison to all other vertebrate groups. In
contrast, genome rearrangements in non-mammalian vertebrate species appear to accumulate at a similar, lower
rate.
Conservation of segmental homology
We compared the map position of Ambystoma genes to the
physical positions of their presumptive orthologs in each
of the seven reference genomes. These pair wise comparisons were visualized using oxford plots to show intrachromosomal positions of orthologies between
Ambystoma and each of the reference genomes (Figures 5,
6, 7, 8) [see Additional files 3, 4, 5]. In oxford plots, conserved segmental homologies can be identified as diagonally oriented clusters of points. We compared this visual
approach with a statistical approach using the program
FISH [26]. The algorithm underlying FISH appears to be
somewhat conservative for Ambystoma-amniote comparisons because several clusters that are visually indicative of
conserved segments were not identified as such, and sev-

eral of the significant clusters did not always include
orthologies that were very close to cluster margins. At any
rate, the majority (57%) of the 334 Ambystoma-amniote
orthologs were found within statistically significant, segmental homologies. The proportion of Ambystoma
orthologs that were assigned to homologous segments
varied greatly among comparative maps (Table 1) [see
Additional file 1]. A much higher percentage of
Ambystoma-amniote orthologs were found in significant
segment homologies than Ambystoma-fish orthologs. For
example, the Ambystoma-chicken oxford plot reveals a
striking pattern of conservation of gene order (Figure 7).
Overall, fewer segmental homologies were identified
between Ambystoma and murid rodents vs nonrodent
amniotes. However, the number of segmental homology
differences among amniotes was small in comparison to
the nearly 2-fold difference in λ values observed for
Ambystoma-murids vs. Ambystoma-nonrodents (Table 1).
Thus, although there has been greater reordering of loci
among murid chromosomes during evolution, orders of
loci within murid chromosomes are conserved and identifiable in comparisons to Ambystoma.

Discussion
Amphibians occupy an important, intermediate position
in the vertebrate evolutionary tree. Our study is the first to
include amphibian gene order data in a taxonomically

Additional file 1]. These data provide evidence beyond
nucleotide identity that Ambystoma genes are annotated
with the correct vertebrate orthology. Information about
gene orthology, conserved synteny, and segmental
homology will extend Ambystoma as a research model
because it will enable development of orthologous probes
for comparative molecular studies, and the identification
of candidate genes for Ambystoma mutants and QTL.

broad comparison of vertebrate genome structure. Comparisons of genome structure between Ambystoma and representative fish, reptilian, and mammalian species
revealed extensive conservation of gene location at the
intra- and inter-chromosomal levels. Overall, we identified conserved syntenies and segmental homologies for
hundreds of Ambystoma protein-coding sequences [see

are not shown; GGA16 contains no mapped Ambystoma
orthologs and others are not represented in the genome

Our study shows that the Ambystoma Genetic Map can
identify conserved syntenies and segmental homologies
when compared to any of the primary vertebrate model
organism genome assemblies. Overall, we found greater
conservation of genome structure between Ambystoma and
amniotes, however, many conserved syntenies are identifiable between Ambystoma and fish (T. nigroviridis,
zebrafish). We also found that genome rearrangement
rates are not simply a function of phylogenetic distance;
there are clear differences in inter-chromosomal rearrangement rates, especially within mammals, as well as
between mammals and "lower vertebrates". We elaborate
on these points below and describe several new insights
that amphibians provide concerning vertebrate genome
evolution.
Genome conservation between Ambystoma and fish
Fewer presumptive orthologs, conserved syntenies, and
segmental homologies were identified between
Ambystoma and fish (T. nigroviridis, zebrafish) than
between Ambystoma and amniotes. This result is expected
because of the deeper divergence time of Ambystoma and
fish; in other words, there has been more time for nucleotide substitutions (that make it difficult to identify
orthologs) and synteny disruptions to accumulate since
the divergence of Ambystoma and fish from a common
ancestor. Nevertheless, 57% of Ambystoma orthologs were
observed in conserved syntenies with four or more
orthologs in at least one fish species, and with the exception of Ambystoma linkage group (LG)13 (which shows
strong synteny with GGA3), all Ambystoma linkage groups
show discreet regions of synteny with chromosomes of T.
nigroviridis and zebrafish. Assuming conservation of gene
order during evolution, several regions of conserved synteny between Ambystoma and fish were likely present in
the ancestral euteleostean genome. These include: the
right hand portion of Ambystoma LG6, which shows extensive synteny with TNI21 and segmental homology with
DRE19; and Ambystoma LG10, which shows extensive synteny with TNI15 and DRE20 (Figure 8) [see Additional file
5]. Observation of extensive synteny between Ambystoma
and fish is interesting because recent evidence suggests a
whole genome duplication predating the common ancestor of T. nigroviridis and zebrafish, followed by differential
losses of paralogous loci [e.g. [7,27-29]]. Under such a
model of genome evolution, the positions of syntenic

moderate number of large rearrangements. The very high
number of segmental homologies observed between
Ambystoma-chicken suggests they share a large portion of
the ancestral tetrapod genome structure. When considering additional segmental homologies identified between
Ambystoma and mammals, more than half of the
Ambystoma-amniote orthologs that are currently located
on the Ambystoma Genetic Map identify segmental homologies within at least one amniote genome, and by extension, the ancestral amniote and tetrapod genomes.

Ambystoma genes are expected to map to overlapping positions on different fish chromosomes. We do observe this
pattern for Ambystoma-T. nigroviridis orthologs on a few of
the smaller Ambystoma linkage groups (e.g. Ambystoma
LG9 vs. TNI13 and 19), however this pattern is not as
obvious in larger Ambystoma linkage groups, or in comparisons between Ambystoma and zebrafish. The observed
patterns appear to be consistent with chromosomal duplications in some instances, but may alternately reflect
ancient large-scale rearrangements that have since been
shuffled to yield interleaving sets of conserved syntenies.
Better reconstruction of the pre-duplicated, ancestral teleost genome is needed to differentiate between these possibilities.
Genome conservation between Ambystoma and
amniotes
Results from our study indicate extensive conservation of
gene orders between Ambystoma and amniotes, and especially between Ambystoma and chicken. Many of the
orthologs identified on the smaller chicken chromosomes
exist in nearly exclusive synteny or segmental homology
with discreet regions of the Ambystoma genome (Figure 7).
This is interesting because of the large difference in chromosome number and genome size between these species.
Ambystoma has a much larger genome and haploid complement of 14 chromosomes [20], whereas chicken has a
haploid complement of 39 chromosomes [9]. Because an
ancestral chromosomal number of 12–14 chromosomes
seems most likely for euteleost [7,28-31] tetrapod (Smith,
unpublished data), and reptilian ancestors [32], differences between Ambystoma and chicken genomes are
largely explained by lineage specific fissions (mostly giving rise to individual chicken microchromosomes) and a

Variation in interchromosomal rearrangement rates
Our study corroborates the idea that mammalian
genomes are characterized by higher and more variable
rates of genome rearrangement in comparison to other
vertebrate groups [e.g. [31,33,34]]. In comparison to
mammals, we estimated lower, but similar genome rearrangement rates for Ambystoma, chicken, zebrafish, and T.
nigroviridis. Our estimates are consistent with cytogenetic
data that indicate extensive conservation of the avian
karyotype over approximately 80–100 million years of
evolution [35-37], with estimates of genome rearrangement rates between chicken and mammals [34,38], and
with comparisons between chicken and reptiles [38]. It is
curious to find similar rearrangement rates among nonmammalian vertebrates that differ so greatly in life history
and genome structure, and whose genomes have been
shaped differently by lineage-specific processes during
evolution. Birds, amphibians, and fish have very different
generation times, chromosome numbers, and genome
sizes. However, our results suggest relatively constant rates
of genome rearrangement from the euteleost ancestor to
the origin of mammals.
Evolution of human chromosomes
In the remainder of the discussion we provide a few examples to show how Ambystoma provides perspective on the
evolution of gene orders within the human genome. In
general, Ambystoma comparative mapping data are useful
because they help establish ancestral amniote and tetrapod gene orders. The Ambystoma ancestral perspective is
needed to identify conserved syntenies and disruptions,
and to corroborate evolutionary inferences based only on
comparisons between chicken and mammals [9,33,4043] or only mammals [33,44-46].
Synteny of HSA1 and HSA19 loci in the ancestral amniote
and tetrapod genomes
A region of segmental homology between Ambystoma LG4
and GGA28 overlaps regions of segmental homology
between Ambystoma LG4 and two human chromosomes,
HSA1 and HSA19 (Figure 9). This arrangement suggests
that portions of HSA1 and 19 were joined in the ancestral
tetrapod and amniote genomes. Fission of this ancestral
gene order presumably occurred before the diversification

rat and dog [47,48]. This example shows that conserved
chromosomal segments may not always be identifiable in
the human genome or other mammalian genomes; a
multi-species perspective is essential to identify lineage
specific effects in comparative vertebrate genomics.

of eutherian mammals (87 MYA) because Ambystoma LG4
orthologies are distributed similarly among the chromosomes of human, mouse, rat, and dog. The overall distribution of conserved syntenies among Ambystoma and
amniotes indicates that many Ambystoma LG4 genes were
syntenic in the ancestral tetrapod genome.
Synteny of HSA7 and HSA12 loci in the ancestral amniote,
tetrapod, and euteleost genomes
Regions of synteny and segmental homology between
Ambystoma LG9 and GGA1 overlap the positions of syntenic markers located on HSA7 and 12 (Figure 9). This
arrangement suggests that loci of HSA7 and 12 were syntenic in the ancestral tetrapod and amniote genomes. As
was observed above for Ambystoma LG4, fission of this
ancestral gene order presumably occurred before the
diversification of eutherian mammals because Ambystoma
LG9 orthologies are distributed similarly among the chromosomes of human, mouse, rat, and dog. Because
Ambystoma LG9 also shows conserved synteny and segmental homology with much of DRE4, many Ambystoma
LG9 genes were apparently syntenic in the euteleost ancestral genome.
Value of multiple species in comparative genomics
Ambystoma LG12 and 13 show extensive conserved synteny and segmental homology with portions of GGA1 and
3, respectively. Apparently, these homologous chromosomal segments have changed little since diversification
of the tetrapod lineage, approximately 370 million years
ago. However, neither Ambystoma LG12 nor Ambystoma
LG13 show substantial conserved synteny or segmental
homology with any human chromosome. This suggests
the possibility of lineage-specific synteny disruptions in
the primate lineage, because Ambystoma LG12 does show

Fissions derived within the mammalian lineage
Several pairs of human chromosomes may have been
fused in the ancestral mammalian genome: HSA3/21, 4/
8, 10/12, 7/16, 14/15, 16/19, and two regions of 12/22,
[33,44-46]. Although our current dataset is insufficient to
test all of these hypotheses, the Ambystoma-human oxford
plot (Figure 5) suggests that two of these chromosome
pairs were fused in the ancestral tetrapod and amniote
genomes (Figure 10). Conserved syntenic regions of
HSA16 and 19 adjoin each other in the middle of
Ambystoma LG3 and at the left end of Ambystoma LG4.
Additionally, conserved syntenic regions of HSA7 and
HSA16 adjoin each other on the right end of Ambystoma
LG3. Our data suggest that some of the chromosomal
arrangements that have been proposed for the ancestral
mammalian genome may trace back to the ancestral tetrapod genome.

Conclusion
These studies demonstrate the importance of amphibians
in revealing key events and trends in vertebrate genome
evolution. Measurements of conserved synteny using
Ambystoma orthologies suggest relatively constant rates of
genome rearrangement from the euteleost ancestor to the
origin of mammals. Ambystoma comparative mapping
data are also useful in establishing ancestral amniote and
tetrapod gene orders and identifying synteny disruptions
that have occurred in amniote lineages. More than half of
the Ambystoma-amniote orthologs that are currently
located on the Ambystoma Genetic Map identify segmental
homologies within at least one amniote genome, and by
extension, the ancestral amniote and tetrapod genomes.

genome.

Comparisons between Ambystoma and amniotes also
reveal some of the key events that have structured the
human genome since diversification of the ancestral
amniote lineage.

Methods
Sequence comparisons
Ambystoma orthologs were identified from assembled contigs of the Salamander Genome Project [49-51] and other
sequences published in GenBank [see Additional file 6].
These sequences ranged in length from 126 to 6167 bp
and presumably correspond to partial and full-length
RNA transcripts. A FASTA file of these sequences is
included as a supplementary document [see Additional
file 7]. Similarity searches and sequence alignments
between translated Ambystoma sequences and translated
genome sequences were performed using the program
BLAT [52]. Alignments were generated between the source
sequences for 491 Ambystoma genetic markers [21] and
genome assemblies for human, mouse, rat, dog, chicken,
zebrafish, and T. nigroviridis. Source sequences for human,
mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebrafish, and T. nigroviridis
(respectively: hg17 build 35, mm6 build 34, rn3,
canFam1, galGal2, danRer2, tetNig1 V7) were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway [53].
Cumulative bitscores were calculated for alignments
between Ambystoma sequence and full genome sequences
by summing across presumptive exons. This was accomplished by summing bitscores for otherwise continuous
alignments that were interrupted by gaps of 10,000 or
fewer bases.
Statistical analysis of conserved synteny
Houseworth and Postlethwait [54] proposed two measures of synteny conservation: ρ and λ. Both of these statistics measure the degree of association between
chromosomes (or other segments) from two genomes.
The statistic ρ is equivalent to the square of Cramer's V statistic for frequencies of orthologs in a two-way table of
chromosomes [54,55]. Cramer's V and ρ are scaled χ2 statistics and as such may not be fully appropriate for measures of association when the average cell frequency within
a two-way contingency table is less than 6 [56]. In other
words accurate estimation of the χ2 statistic for comparisons between two genomes with 1N = 20 would require at
minimum identification of 2400 (20*20*6) orthologies.
Furthermore, χ2 based measures of association are not
directly comparable between analyses, nor interpretable
in a probabilistic sense [e.g. [57-60]].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/219

when the ortholog's position is known in the other species, vs. when it is unknown) [60]. The value of λ ranges
from 0 to 1, with a value of λ = 0 representing the case
where knowledge of the positions of orthologous loci in
either species is completely uninformative in predicting
the location of orthologs in the other, and a value of λ = 1
representing the case where knowledge of the positions of
orthologous loci in either species can be used to exactly
predict the location of all orthologs in the other. Values of
ρ and λ were highly similar among our analyses. For simplicity and ease of interpretation, and because the λ statistic is seemingly more appropriate for the question at
hand, we therefore report only values for λ with approximate 95% confidence estimated using the methods of
Goodman and Kruskal [61].
Statistical analysis of segmental homology
Segmental homologies were identified by comparing the
positions of orthologs between the Ambystoma genetic
map and the reference genomes for human, mouse, rat,
dog, chicken, zebrafish, and T. nigroviridis. The Ambystoma
map and reference genomes were formatted as concatenated (across linkage groups or chromosomes) series of
orthologs and input into the program FISH [26]. In effect,
FISH identifies segmental homologies by comparing the
distribution of points on an oxford plot to the expected
null distribution for an equal number of randomly scattered points. Concatenating chromosomes of multichromosomal genomes permits correct calculation of the null
distribution of orthologies by FISH. However, one potential caveat of using concatenated genomes is that the analysis does not take into account the position of
chromosomal boundaries. The possibility therefore exists
that clusters or orthologies that cross the boundaries of
chromosomes or linkage groups will be identified as segmental homologies. Because these putative clusters
involve artificially generated segments, they likely represent spurious segmental homologies. To check for this
possibility, the locations of all identified segmental
homologies were examined manually. A single segmental
homology in the Ambystoma-mouse comparison was
observed that crossed a boundary. This homology was
removed from subsequent analyses. We note that boundary-crossing clusters might alternately represent fission
breakpoints that were placed (by chance) adjacent to one
another in the concatenated genome. We intend to
explore this possibility in future work.

provides a measure of the proportional increase in ability

either of two species (or in probabilistic terms, "the relative decrease in probability of erroneous guessing"; [60],
