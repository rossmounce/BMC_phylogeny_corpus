Abstract
Background: Transmission electron microscopy images of Deinococcus radiodurans R1 suggest that
the nucleoid of this species exists as a "ring-like" body, and have led to speculation that this
structure contributes to the radioresistance of the species. Since extreme radioresistance is
characteristic of six other species of Deinococcus, we have attempted to correlate nucleoid
morphology and radioresistance by determining whether the genomic DNA of each of these
species exhibit similar structures.
Results: The nucleoid morphologies of seven recognized species of Deinococcus, the radioresistant
bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans, and the more radiosensitive deinococcal relative Thermus
aquaticus were evaluated using epifluorescence and deconvolution techniques. Although the
nucleoids of Deinococcus murrayi, Deinococcus proteolyticus, Deinococcus radiophilus, and Deinococcus
grandis have structures similar to D. radiodurans, the majority of nucleoids found in Deinococcus
radiopugnans and Deinococcus geothermalis lack any specific organization. The nucleoid of R.
radiotolerans consists of multiple highly condensed spheres of DNA scattered throughout the cell.
The genomic DNA of Thermus aquaticus is uniformly distributed throughout the cell.
Conclusion: There is no obvious relationship between the shape of a species' nucleoid and
extreme radioresistance. However, the genomes of all extremely radioresistance species examined
are highly condensed relative to more radiosensitive species. Whether DNA in this tightly packed
configuration contributes to the radioresistance of these bacteria remains unknown, but this
common structural feature appears to limit diffusion of fragments generated post-irradiation even
in cells incapable of repairing strand breaks.

Background
The Deinococcaceae are a small family within the domain
Bacteria that are distinguished by their ability to tolerate
DNA double strand breaks [1,2]. There are eleven validly
described species and seven of these tolerate what for
most microorganisms is a sterilizing dose of ionizing radiation, exhibiting detectable survival after exposure to 10
kGy (1,000,000 Rad) γ radiation [3]. The ionizing radia-

tion resistance of the four remaining species, Deinococcus
indicus [4], Deinococcus frigens, Deinococcus saxicola, and
Deinococcus marmoris [5] has not been reported. Ionizing
radiation generates an array of DNA damage in the target
cell, including many types of base damage, single, and
double strand breaks [6]. Of these types of damage, DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs) are considered the greatest
threat to cell viability, and an excessive number of DSBs

are expected to be lethal. E. coli, for example, cannot survive introduction of greater than one or two DSBs into its
genome [7]. In contrast, D. radiodurans survives doses of
ionizing radiation that generate greater than 100 DSBs per
genome without mutation or loss of viability [8-10]. It is
the ability to endure and accurately repair these lesions
that set the deinococci apart from other species.
The reasons for the deinococci's radioresistance are poorly
understood. Genetic and biochemical evidence obtained
from D. radiodurans, the best studied of these species,
argues that recovery requires RecA-mediated homologous
recombination [9,11,12]. D. radiodurans is multigenomic, and depending on the growth phase, cells contain from 4 to 10 copies of their genome depending on
growth conditions [13,14]. It is believed that this
increased DNA content is protective in that it serves as a
reservoir of genetic information that can be used during
recombinational repair. In addition, it has been suggested
that there may be a pre-existing alignment of homologous
sequences between copies of the genome and that this
alignment accounts for the remarkable speed and fidelity
of DNA double strand break repair in this species [15].
However, the existence of such an alignment has not been
established.
Levin-Zaidman et al. [16] have reported that the genome
of D. radiodurans assumes a tightly packed ring-like structure that may represent an alternative mechanism for protecting D. radiodurans from DSBs. These authors suggest
this structure contributes to D. radiodurans radioresistance
by preventing fragments formed by DSBs from diffusing
apart during repair. Having the capacity to maintain the
linear continuity of its genome in the face of the extensive
fragmentation resulting from high dose ionizing radiation
would provide obvious advantages to D. radiodurans.
Assuming that DNA repair proteins can function within
the proposed structure, gene order is preserved and the
gaps generated by damage and subsequent DNA degradation could be bridged by homologous recombination
with redundant genetic information available in the
genome copies. Such an arrangement does not require a
pre-existing alignment between sequences, but if homologous genetic information is aligned prior to irradiation,
the time needed to effect repairs should be reduced.
In an attempt to gain insight into whether the structures
reported by Levin-Zaidman et al contribute to ionizing
radiation resistance, we have combined epifluorescence
and deconvolution microscopy to describe the structure
of the nucleoid of the seven species of the Deinococcaceae
known to be ionizing radiation resistant. We assume that
if ring-like structures are required for extreme radioresistance, all deinococci will contain a similarly organized
nucleoid. In addition, we have examined the nucleoid

structure of a related but less radioresistant species, Thermus aquaticus, and a phylogenetically distinct, but more
radioresistant [17] species Rubrobacter radiotolerans seeking to correlate variations in nucleoid morphology with
radioresistance. We find little evidence to support the
assertion that a specific nucleoid structure is required for
bacterial ionizing radiation resistance, but note that the
genomic DNA of the most radioresistant species examined is more condensed relative to more radiosensitive
species, suggesting that this generic feature is passively
facilitating repair processes.

Results
The nucleoid of Deinococcus radiodurans R1
Sequential digital images were collected at 100 nm increments from stationary phase cultures of D. radiodurans R1.
Cells were stained with the membrane dye FM4-64 and
the DNA specific dye DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and the images obtained using each dye were
merged to form the sequence of images depicted in Fig. 1.
In agreement with previous descriptions of this species'
nucleoid, the genomic DNA of R1 exhibits a clear organized pattern [16,18,19], distinct from that observed in E.
coli (Fig. 2) where the DAPI-stained DNA appears uniformly distributed throughout each cell. The DNA of R1
has a distinctive ring-like structure in each cell of this tetrad, suggesting that the genome of this species is spooled
around a sphere or cylinder that excludes the dye. Given

the size and organization of this structure we assume that
the proposed core is primarily proteinaceous, but don't
exclude the possibility that other macromolecules, including DNA that is inaccessible to the dye, may be present in
the core. Based on the images in Fig. 1, we believe that the
DAPI-stained DNA exists as an equatorial band (or possibly a tight spiral) over the surface of this core. In each of
the cells the band is tilted relative to the focal plane. For
example, in the lower half of the tetrad, the bands are
tilted slightly away from the viewer; toward the upper left
in the cell on the left and toward the upper right in the cell
on the right. Consistent with this interpretation, we find
that the dye does not form a closed ring in every optical
section and that the patterns vary from cell to cell. In
many cells the DNA first appears in a crescent shape in
one area of the cell. This crescent changes in sequential
sections (Fig. 1), ultimately disappearing and giving way
to a crescent shaped structure that mirrors where the dye
first appeared. This pattern of changes is most simply
explained by assuming that the DNA is on the surface of a
larger structure capable of tilting about a central axis.
When tilted, the ring of dye will cross the focal plane at an
angle and produce a falcate shape.

is similar to that of D. radiodurans R1
D. radiophilus and D. proteolyticus have a nucleoid reminiscent of that described for D. radiodurans (Fig. 1). In cross

section, the DAPI accumulates in a halo surrounding a circular core that excludes the dye. However, the organization of the DNA in these species differs subtly relative to
D. radiodurans; the DNA appears to completely surround
the structure at the core of the nucleoid. This point is best
illustrated in Fig. 3, which depicts 20 sequential sections
(moving from upper left to the lower right panel) through
the DAPI-stained nucleoids in a pair of D. proteolyticus
cells. (The stained membrane is not included in this
image.) The first image corresponds to a focal plane at the
top of the nucleoid and with each successive image; it
becomes clear that the DNA forms a shell that follows the
contour of an internal sphere that has not been stained.
The nucleoid morphology of D. radiophilus was found to
be identical to that of D. proteolyticus (data not shown).
The nucleoid of rod-shaped D. grandis is distinctive, but
shares similarity to that of D. radiodurans. The DNA in
most cells is highly condensed, localized to a specific area

of the cell (Fig 4). The sequential sections obtained from
D. grandis suggest that the DNA surrounds an unstained
core. A number of cells (~7%) exhibit additional
condensed spots of DAPI stain, as illustrated in the cell on
the right in Fig 4. The significance of these "spots" is not
known at present.
In D. murrayi, the ring of DAPI-stained DNA is remarkably
uniform (Fig. 5), varying little between cells. As with D.
radiodurans, the center of the ring is not stained, but the
number of sections containing DNA is more variable,
ranging between 20 and 30. This suggests that the nucleoid of D. murrayi may be more cylindrical than that of D.
radiodurans with the DNA forming a sleeve around the
core. Consistent with this interpretation, most of the cells
display a ring of DAPI in every optical section.
In contrast to the other species discussed thus far, only 2%
of D. radiopugnans and 10% of D. geothermalis cells exhibit
a structurally well-defined nucleoid (Figs. 6 and 7). In the
majority of these cells, the DNA is condensed in that it is
not uniformly spread throughout the cell as was observed
with E. coli (Fig 2), but it does not seem to be associated
with an intracellular structure. Instead the DNA appears to
be distributed chaotically through the cytosol. The
absence of a consistent pattern in DAPI staining within
most of the cells suggests that the DNA in these species
does not adopt a fixed shape.

Representative survival curves for cultures of Thermus aquaticus YT-1, E. coli AB1157, and Deinococcus
radiodurans R1. Values are the means +/- standard deviations of three independent experiments. n = 9.

The nucleoid of Thermus aquaticus
The genera Thermus and Deinococcus are part of the same
phylum within the domain Bacteria [3]. Because of this
relationship, we sought 1) to establish if Thermus species
also exhibit increased tolerance to ionizing radiation, and
2) to determine if the nucleoid of this genus bore any
resemblance to that of the deinococci. We assessed the
ionizing radiation resistance of Thermus aquaticus YT-1,
the type species for its genus, and compared it to D. radiodurans R1. As indicated in Fig. 8, YT-1 does not display
extraordinary resistance relative to R1, but this strain is
better able to survive γ radiation than the E. coli AB1157
control. After 1 kGy exposure, approximately 20% of the
YT-1 population remained viable, whereas only 0.2% of
the AB1157 culture survived.

Images of YT-1 (Fig. 9) failed to show evidence of sub-cellular organization or condensation similar to that
observed in the deinococcal species. The pattern obtained
with DAPI most closely resembles that observed in E. coli
(Fig. 2).

logeny, unrelated to the Deinococcaceae [17]. This species
is a member of a lineage within the Actinobacteria. The
nucleoid of this species is quite different from that
observed in the deinococci (Fig. 10). The DNA appears to
form highly compact structures without a well-defined
shape. Most cells contain two or three of these structures,
and it is unclear whether each dye spot represents a unit
length of genomic DNA. Based on differences in size and
intensity, the spots do not appear to contain equivalent
amounts of DNA, but these differences may be spurious.
We suspect that the cell envelope of R. radiotolerans is less

permeable to DAPI than that of the other species examined in this study. Attempts to stain the DNA of the closely
related R. xylanophilus [17] were unsuccessful; the dye
being unable to penetrate the cell. Differing quantities of
dye entering individual R. radiotolerans cells may account
for the differences in dye intensity observed.
The effect of ionizing radiation on nucleoid morphology
As has been shown previously, when D. radiodurans cells
are exposed to high dose γ radiation they exhibit substantial DNA damage [10]. The distinctive pattern formed on
a pulsed field gel by the NotI digested genome (data not
shown) is initially obliterated by the DNA double strand
breaks introduced during a 5 kGy exposure [10,20], but
after three hours recovery, the pattern is restored indicating that the majority of the breaks have been repaired. To
establish whether the introduction of large numbers of

DNA double-strand breaks affect the distribution of DNA
within the irradiated cell, we examined nucleoid structure
in exponential phase D. radiodurans two hours post-irradiation, comparing the distribution of DAPI stain to that of
E. coli AB1157 treated identically (Fig. 11B). The
differences in the images obtained are striking. While we
are able to detect DAPI-stained material in some E. coli
cells, the diffuse distribution, apparent in Fig. 2, is no
longer evident; only infrequent spots of DAPI remain.
Furthermore, images of E. coli cells captured three hours
post-irradiation of 5 kGy show a complete loss of the
DAPI-stained material (data not shown). One reason for
this may be that the E. coli genome is being progressively
degraded following irradiation [21]. In contrast, the
nucleoids of D. radiodurans and D. radiopugnans appear
intact and retain the ability to be stained (Fig. 11A and
11D). These images provide support for the hypothesis of

Page 6 of 10

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:17

Levin-Zaidman et al [16,19], which proposes that
fragments generated by the double strand breaks may be
in some manner held in place and protected from extensive degradation by cellular nucleases.
The notion that the release of fragments from the damaged genome of D. radiodurans is limited is also apparent
in our analysis of the effects of ionizing radiation on the
nucleoid of the recA strain, rec30. The rec30 strain, which
lacks the ability to carry out homologous recombination
[8,9], is incapable of reassembling its genome following
irradiation. However, like R1, the nucleoid of rec30
remains a coherent structure (Fig. 11C) two hours postirradiation, providing further evidence that fragments
generated do not diffuse throughout the cytosol despite
the presence of massive numbers of un-repaired DNA
double strand breaks.

Discussion
Levin-Zaidman et al [16] have reported that genomic
DNA of stationary phase cells of D. radiodurans is ordered
as a tightly packed toroid, and it has been argued that this
organization is in part responsible for D. radiodurans
resistance to ionizing radiation [16,19]. These authors
assume that the dense packaging characteristic of toroids
restricts the diffusion of DNA fragments generated when
cells are exposed to ionizing radiation, preventing a loss of
genetic information that is needed for effective recovery
from the insult. However, these authors also describe logarithmic phase cultures of D. radiodurans R1, and indicate
that the nucleoids of these cells do not always exhibit a
toroidal ring-like morphology even though they remain
extremely radioresistant [2]. This observation seems to
argue against a requirement for involvement of a specific
nucleoid structure in ionizing radiation resistance. In
addition, Daly et al [18] have demonstrated that growth
in different media alters the organization of the nucleoid
of D. radiodurans, and that the change does not correspond to changes in radioresistance. This group reports
that ring-like nucleoids predominate in cultures growing
in defined minimal medium, but that these cultures are
more sensitive to ionizing radiation than cultures with
fewer ring-like nucleoids growing in a rich medium.
We initiated this study in an attempt to correlate nucleoid
structure with radioresistance, reasoning that if the inferences of Levin-Zaidman et al [16] are correct, it will be
reflected in morphological differences between
radioresistant and radiosensitive species. We have
examined species known to be ionizing radiation resistant
as well as strains that are more sensitive to γ irradiation,
and in agreement with Daly et al [18] find no compelling
evidence that specific structures contribute to
radioresistance. We base this conclusion on our failure to
identify a distinctive repetitive pattern in the DAPI-stained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/17

DNA associated with the majority of D. geothermalis and
D. radiopugnans cells in stationary phase culture. Cultures
of D. geothermalis [22] and D. radiopugnans [23] are as
radioresistant as D. radiodurans, but their genomes are
more fluid, arguing that a nucleoid need not maintain a
well-defined shape to sustain ionizing radiation
resistance.
Despite this conclusion, we note that among the
extremely radioresistant species examined DAPI-stained
DNA is condensed relative to what is observed in E. coli
and T. aquaticus. The DAPI is localized within the more
radioresistant cells, and not spread throughout the
cytosol. This aggregation of DNA indicates that a basic
tenet of the model of Levin-Zaidman et al [16] may be
valid: specifically that the deinococci utilize mechanisms
for protecting the fragments generated by strand breaks
including a passive process that limits the diffusion of
these fragments. This concept is most clearly demonstrated by the behavior of rec30 strain subsequent to
irradiation. Despite the fact that this strain is incapable of
restituting the majority of the DSBs generated, the rec30
nucleoid retains its shape.
However, it must be noted that under certain conditions
E. coli cells can undergo changes in nucleoid morphology
similar to those reported for the deinococci. E. coli nucleoids become condensed spheres with cores of unknown
composition when protein synthesis is inhibited [24], and
when the mukB locus is disrupted the resulting mutant
maintains a ring-like nucleoid [25]. Clearly, since E. coli
strains are much more sensitive to ionizing radiation
relative to D. radiodurans, the presence of a condensed
nucleoid alone is not a sufficient explanation for radioresistance. Instead, we assume the combination of a
condensed nucleoid structure and unique proteindependent DNA repair mechanisms is responsible for the
radioresistant phenotype displayed by the deinococci.
The physical basis for the condensed nucleoid we observe
is unknown. We suspect that this level of spatial
organization is in large part mediated by proteins that
either link copies of the genome together (assuming that
a species contains more than one genome copy), or coordinates genome folding in a manner that generates the
shapes we have described. For those species, such as D.
radiodurans or D. murrayi, in which the nucleoid forms an
obvious structure, we envision a protein lattice that acts as
a scaffold that the genome is organized around. We predict these proteins are functionally analogous to the SMC
(structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins
described in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic species [2628]. It seems unlikely that genomic DNA is as condensed
as the DNA-Dps assemblies described in some stationary
phase bacteria [29,30]. These structures are tightly packed,

Page 7 of 10

BMC Microbiology 2005, 5:17

almost crystalline, and it is difficult to envision how an
actively metabolizing cell could function under this circumstance; the DNA needs to remain accessible to proteins that catalyze essential housekeeping functions.
We also predict that the ionic composition of the cytosol
of the deinococci examined favors the formation of the
structures we observe. The Deinococcaceae exhibit unusually high intracellular levels of Mn+2 [18] and it is possible
that accumulating this metal creates an environment that
facilitates DNA condensation within this species in vivo
through direct or indirect mechanisms. In vitro, the condensation of DNA can be achieved by adding a condensing agent, such as a multivalent cation, to an aqueous
solution of DNA. The strong electrostatic interaction of
the DNA and these cations neutralizes the repulsion of
phosphate groups in the DNA backbone, and it has been
shown that approximately 90% of the DNA charge must
be neutralized for condensation to occur [31]. Intracellular Mn+2 may also indirectly facilitate nucleoid condensation by, for example, augmenting the function of
deinococcal DNA-binding proteins. On the other hand,
high Mn+2 content may have no affect on nucleoid morphology since, as described above, E. coli can have a
condensed nucleoid even though this species has a much
lower level of intracellular Mn+2 [18].
Years of experimental evidence irrefutably argue that DNA
repair is essential for D. radiodurans recovery from high
dose exposure to ionizing radiation, but this fact does not
necessarily lead to the conclusion that efficient DNA
repair is sufficient for extreme radioresistance. Although
there has been a great deal of speculation concerning
subtle differences in the properties of DNA repair proteins
isolated from D. radiodurans, there has yet to be a convincing demonstration that this species' DNA repair proteins
are "better" relative to homologues found in more radiosensitive species. Given this, it remains a formal possibility that D. radiodurans DNA repair proteins function
within a molecular environment that enhances their effectiveness. In other words, it seems likely that there are features of deinococcal physiology that augment DNA repair
processes, allowing the conventional complement of
DNA repair proteins to more efficiently deal with DNA
damage. We believe that the images presented here
suggest that the genomic DNA of the deinococci is more
condensed relative to other species. We suggest that this
aggregation is protective, and that it may significantly contribute to the radioresistance of these species by confining
the fragments generated subsequent to irradiation and
preserving the linear continuity of the damaged genome.

Conclusion
This work resulted in two key observations. First, all evidence obtained is consistent with the notion that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/17

genomes of radioresistant species are more condensed
than radiosensitive species. Second, irradiation does not
seem to disturb the pattern of condensation observed in
the deinococci, even when we examined that pattern in a
recA defective strain incapable of repairing DNA double
strand breaks. Therefore, in agreement with Levin-Zaidmen et al [16], we assume that the deinococci have the
capacity to passively prevent the diffusion of DNA fragments post-irradiation, and that this ability may contribute to the radioresistance of these species.

glucose, 0.005% Tween 80, and 0.1% magnesium sulfate.
Thermus aquaticus YT-1 (ATCC 25104) was grown at 70°C
in Castenholz TYE medium (ATCC medium 723). E. coli
AB1157 cultures were grown at 37°C in LB medium (1%
tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl).

Unless otherwise indicated, all cultures were grown to stationary phase prior to microscopic examination. Cultures
were harvested with the following densities as measured
by OD600: D. radiodurans, 1.2–1.8; D. radiophilus 1.8–2.2;
D. proteolyticus 2.0; D. radiopugnans 1.3–2.0; D. grandis 1.7;
D. geothermalis 1.8; D. murrayi 1.3; R. radiotolerans 1.9; T.
aquaticus 1.1. These values correspond to cultures with
densities between 3 × 108 and 1.3 × 109 CFU/ml.
Microscopy
Cultured cells were stained with N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4(diethylamino)
phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide, (FM 4–64),
and 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride,
(DAPI), for the visualization of the lipid membrane and
DNA, respectively. Ratios of the amounts of stationary
phase culture cells to fluorescent dyes were a 3:1:1 ratio of
culture cells to 0.0625 µg/µL of FM 4–64 solution to 3 µg/
mL DAPI solution. The cells were then mounted on slides
coated with 0.5% agarose.

two-dimensional images at a series of points along the zaxis that were set at 100 nm apart. The N2.1 filter cube
from Leica Microsystems was used for FM 4–64 detection,
which includes a 580 nm longpass dichroic mirror, a 515–

560 nm bandpass excitation filter, and a 590 nm long pass
emission filter. The A4 filter cube from Leica Microsystems was used for DAPI detection, which includes a 400
nm longpass dichroic mirror, a 360-40 nm bandpass excitation filter, and a 470-40 nm bandpass emission filter.
The optical series was deconvolved with Slidebook 4.0
from Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., (Denver, CO),
using constrained iterative deconvolution and was then
imported into Adobe Photoshop 7.0 as separate twodimensional images. The two-dimensional images were
then arranged in order as depicted.

The projection image in Fig. 11A was achieved with the
Slidebook 4.0 software by compiling the stack of twodimensional images into a single two-dimensional image.
All images were captured using a Leica DMRXA2 microscope and a Sensicam QE camera from The Cooke Corporation, (Auburn Hills, MI). The brightness and contrast of
all images were enhanced using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.

Ionizing radiation exposure
Cultures (grown in the appropriate medium) of D. radiodurans (OD600 0.12–0.19), D. radiopugnans (OD600 1.5–
1.8), rec30 (OD600 1.4) and E. coli (OD600 0.23) were irradiated to a dose of 5000 Grays using a Model 484R 60Co
irradiator (J. L. Sheppard & Associates, San Fernando,
CA). Controls were kept at room temperature during irradiation exposure of experimental samples. All samples
were incubated at the appropriate conditions immediately after irradiation. All of the cells were harvested after
2 hours of incubation and prepared for microscopy as
described above.

Survival curves
Cultures were irradiated using the irradiator described
above, and survival established by serial dilution of irradiated cultures and plating on appropriate growth medium.
Three independent trials were conducted for each species
examined with three replicates per trial. Sigma Plot software was used to create the survival curve.
