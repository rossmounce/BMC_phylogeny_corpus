Abstract
Background: During copulation, the major Afro-tropical malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s.s. transfers male
accessory gland (MAG) proteins to females as a solid mass (i.e. the “mating plug”). These proteins are postulated to
function as important modulators of female post-mating responses. To understand the role of selective forces
underlying the evolution of these proteins in the A. gambiae complex, we carried out an evolutionary analysis of
gene sequence and expression divergence on a pair of paralog genes called AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-2. These
encode MAG-specific proteins which, based on homology with Drosophila, have been hypothesized to play a role
in sperm viability and function.
Results: Genetic analysis of 6 species of the A. gambiae complex revealed the existence of a third paralog (68-78%
of identity), that we named AgAcp34A-3. FISH assays showed that this gene maps in the same division (34A) of
chromosome-3R as the other two paralogs. In particular, immuno-fluorescence assays targeting the C-terminals of
AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3 revealed that these two proteins are localized in the posterior part of the MAG and
concentrated at the apical portion of the mating plug. When transferred to females, this part of the plug lies in
proximity to the duct connecting the spermatheca to the uterus, suggesting a potential role for these proteins in
regulating sperm motility. AgAcp34A-3 is more polymorphic than the other two paralogs, possibly because of
relaxation of purifying selection. Since both unequal crossing-over and gene conversion likely homogenized the
members of this gene family, the interpretation of the evolutionary patterns is not straightforward. Although
several haplotypes of the three paralogs are shared by most A. gambiae s.l. species, some fixed species-specific
replacements (mainly placed in the N- and C-terminal portions of the secreted peptides) were also observed,
suggesting some lineage-specific adaptation.
Conclusions: Progress in understanding the signaling cascade in the A. gambiae reproductive pathway will
elucidate the interaction of this MAG-specific protein family with their female counterparts. This knowledge will
allow a better evaluation of the relative importance of genes involved in the reproductive isolation and fertility of
A. gambiae species and could help the interpretation of the observed evolutionary patterns.

Background
Across many taxa, genes encoding proteins involved in
reproductive processes often evolve rapidly and can contribute to the establishment of barriers to fertilization
that might ultimately lead to speciation [1,2]. Male
seminal fluid proteins transferred during mating induce
a series of physiological and behavioral changes in
females, generally referred to as post-mating responses
[3]. In Drosophila species, male accessory gland proteins
(Acps) transferred to females alongside sperm are
known to modulate female physiology after mating and
induce ovulation, oogenesis, sperm storage and a temporary refractoriness to further mating. Many Drosophila Acps evolve rapidly because of positive selection
due to sexual conflict [4-12]. Among them, the “sex
peptide” Acp70A has been shown to be one of the most
divergent genes in the Drosophila genome [4,6] and to
be partly responsible for species-specific usage of
gametes [13]. Studies on the D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura groups have also shown that Acps are
frequently subject to gene duplication [10,14], a
mechanism that allows the acquisition of new genes and
plays a substantial role in the diversification of closely
related species [15].
Anopheles gambiae s.s., the principal vector of human
malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, belongs to a complex
including at least six other sibling species (A. arabiensis,
A. melas, A. merus, A. quadriannulatus A and B and A.
bwambae) that are morphologically indistinguishable,
but remarkably distinct in their ecological adaptations,
fixed chromosomal inversions, behaviours and role in
malaria transmission [16,17]. Recent studies have
revealed genes potentially involved in A. gambiae s.s.
post-mating physiological and behavioral responses
[18-20], thus opening perspectives to investigate their
differentiation among the species of the A. gambiae
complex [21]. Males of A. gambiae s.s. transfer their
male accessory gland (MAG) products into the female
atrium during mating as a solid mass, the “mating plug”,
that is digested in the space of 24-48 hours post-mating.
In A. gambiae s.s., transfer of the mating plug plays an
important role in reproduction, as females mated to
males impaired in mating plug formation are not capable of storing sperm in their spermathecae [20]. A
number of MAG proteins have been identified in Anopheles that are orthologs of Drosophila Acps [18-20]. A
possible role for these male proteins in inducing female
post-mating responses such as ovulation, oviposition
and life-long mating refractoriness has been postulated
[22,23]. Among the Acps identified in A. gambiae s.s.,
two small paralog genes, annotated on the A. gambiae
genome (PEST strain, AgamP ver. 3.6) as AGAP009369
and AGAP009370 (86% of identity at the nucleotide
level), were identified in the so-called A. gambiae male

“fertilization island” located on chromosome 3 [18].
These genes lie in division 34A of the right arm of chromosome 3, and are close to the gene encoding the glutamine-rich protein “Plugin” (AGAP009368), the most
abundant component of the mating plug. Plugin is the
major substrate for the male-specific transglutaminase
enzyme responsible for the coagulation of the liquid
MAG secretions [20]. AGAP009369 and AGAP009370
proteins have been postulated to have a role in fertility
and in female post-mating responses, based on their
homology with Drosophila Acp53Ea protein, which has
a role in sperm competitive ability and/or a hormonal
activity [18,20]. Because of a lack of knowledge on their
specific functions, we decided to assign provisional gene
names to these two Acps by adopting the nomenclature
commonly used for Drosophila Acps. Hence we used
names to summarize the species- and tissue-specificity,
chromosomal location and paralogy of these genes.
Then, for the purpose of this work, AGAP009369 and
AGAP009370 were provisionally renamed AgAcp34A-1
and AgAcp34A-2, respectively.
We present data on the genetic differentiation and
expression of these male-expressed genes among the
species of the A. gambiae complex and report the presence of a previously unannotated gene duplicate. The
results also highlight the existence of species-specific
products that might be indicative of unique lineage-specific functions of these proteins.

Methods
Field collected samples

The study was carried out on a total of ~50-65 individuals belonging to five species of the A. gambiae complex
and collected in several localities along their geographical
distribution (Figure 1a). Samples of both incipient species
within A. gambiae s.s. - namely the M and S molecular
forms [24] - were also considered in our study. We
selected a large sample from an extended geographical
scale in order to more efficiently distinguish fixed differences among species from polymorphisms present in one
or more species. A. gambiae s.s. M- and S-form adults
were collected between 1998 and 2008 in 10 African
countries (Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast,
Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, The Gambia, Zimbabwe), A. arabiensis from 6 countries (Senegal, The
Gambia, Mali, Angola, Zimbabwe and Kenya), A. melas
from Angola, Gabon and Guinea Bissau, A. quadriannulatus A from Zimbabwe and Malawi and A. merus from
Mozambique and Tanzania.
Genomic DNA was extracted from the head and
thorax of each mosquito using standard procedures and
specimens were identified to species and molecular
forms using both PCR-RFLP [25] and SINE200 methods
[26].

Figure 1 Geographic distribution of A. gambiae s.l. samples and median-joining networks of coding haplotypes. Species- and formspecific colours in the geographic map (a) and networks (b, c, d) are as follows: A. gambiae M-form: dark blue, A. gambiae S-form: light blue, A.
arabiensis: red, A. merus: violet, A. melas: green, A. quadriannulatus: yellow. Synonymous mutations are in italics, nonsynonymous mutations are in
bold-italics. The size of the circles in the networks is proportional to the haplotype frequencies. Numbering of mutations follows the complete
coding sequence of each gene: AgAcp34A-1 (b), AgAcp34A-2 (c) and AgAcp34A-3 (d).

PCR amplification and sequencing

Multiple primer pairs were designed using Gene Runner
3.05 (Hastings Software, Inc.) and the A. gambiae s.s.
genome (PEST strain, AgamP3.6) as a reference, to specifically amplify and sequence each paralog gene in a
single amplicon or in two overlapping fragments (Table
1, Figure 2). Due to the high similarity among the three
paralogs (Figure 2), a nested PCR protocol was needed
in most cases to ensure the specific amplification of the
targeted gene. The whole sequence of AgAcp34A-1
(including 5’-3’ UTRs) was obtained for all specimens in
a single 632 bp amplicon using a nested PCR approach
with reverse primers placed on the specific portion of
its 3’ flanking region (Figure 2). Similarly, the entire
sequence of AgAcp34A-2 (including 5’-3’ UTRs, 685 bp)
was initially obtained from 34 specimens of A. gambiae
and A. arabiensis using specific primer pairs with the
reverse primer placed on its 3’ flanking region, whereas
a slightly different “variant” of AgAcp34A-2 was initially
amplified with the same protocol from 27 specimens of

A. melas, A. merus and A. quadriannulatus. However,
both AgAcp34A-2 “variants” were then amplified in all
A. gambiae complex specimens and later isolated using
variant-specific primers, thus providing evidence for the
presence of a duplicated gene of AgAcp34A-2, that we
have named AgAcp34A-3. This produced a 100% “permanent heterozygosity” in our samples, as a consequence of the presence of fixed cismorphisms (i.e. fixed
differences between paralogous sequences) [27]. Various
PCR and sequencing strategies were then designed to
obtain both copy-specific fragments from all A. gambiae
s.l. specimens (Table 1, Figure 2).
PCR reactions were carried out in a 25 μl reaction
which contained 1 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM of
each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 U Bioline Taq polymerase, and 0.5 μl of template DNA extracted from a single
mosquito. Thermocycler conditions were 94°C for 10
min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50-54°C for
30 s and 72°C for 1 min., with a final extension at 72°C
for 10 min. For nested PCR, fragments obtained with a

specific set of primers were diluted 1:100 and used as a
template for subsequent PCR using internal primers.
The resulting products were analysed on 1% agarose
gels stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR products
were purified using the SureClean Kit (Bioline) and
sequenced on both strands at the BMR Genomics s.r.l
(Padua, Italy). All sequences were deposited in GenBank
under Accession Nos. JN694584-JN694752.
BLAST searches in the A. gambiae genome

The program Consensus (threshold set = 50; http://coot.
embl.de/Alignment//consensus.html) was used to generate
consensus sequences from the alignments obtained from
A. gambiae s.s. specimens for either AgAcp34A-2 and
AgAcp34A-3. We then used the consensus sequences as a
query and conducted BLASTn searches by setting the evalue cutoff = e-10 and a BLOSUM62 default scoring
matrix in http://agambiae.vectorbase.org/Tools/BLAST/

on: i) the A. gambiae genome assembly (AgamP3.6), ii) the
A. gambiae PEST strain trace reads, iii) M (Mali NIH
strain) and S (Pimperena strain) contigs, scaffold and trace
reads. Trace read (and mate pair) chromatograms were
recovered from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

To determine the chromosomal localization of AgAcp34A1, AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3, we designed probes that
were 632 bp- and 685 bp-long. A nested PCR approach
was used to amplify these probes. A first round of PCR
with the primer pair “69 ex” (Table 1) produced a 735 bp
fragment of AgAcp34A-1. The second round of PCR with
the primer pair “69 n” (Table 1) specifically amplified a
632 bp fragment of AgAcp34A-1. For amplification of
AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3 we used the primer pair “70
ex” (Table 1) that produced a 793 bp fragment, followed
by a nested PCR with the primer pair “70 n” (Table 1) that

produced a 685 bp fragment specific to both AgAcp34A-2
and AgAcp34A-3, but not to AgAcp34A-1. The genomic
DNA of single A. gambiae SUA mosquitoes was extracted
with the Wizard SV Genomic Purification System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) and used as a template for PCR. PCR products were gel purified using the
Geneclean kit (Qbiogene, Inc., Irvine, CA). The DNA was
labeled with Cy3-AP3-dUTP and Cy3-AP3-dUTP (GE
Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) using
Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Chromosomal preparations were made from the ovaries of half-gravid females of the SUA strain of A. gambiae, the OPHANSI strain of A. merus, and the
DONGOLA strain of A. arabiensis. The in situ hybridization procedure was performed as previously described
[28]. DNA probes were hybridized to the chromosomes
at 39°C overnight in hybridization solution (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Then the chromosomes were washed in 0.2XSSC (Saline-Sodium Citrate:
0.03 M Sodium Chloride, 0.003 M Sodium Citrate),
counterstained with YOYO-1, and mounted in DABCO.
Fluorescent signals were detected and recorded using a
Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss

MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA). The locations of signals were determined using a standard cytogenetic photo map of A. gambiae [29].
Confocal images were processed using ImageJ and
Adobe Photoshop software by splitting color channels
from the initial RGB image into separate images as
described elsewhere [30]. Each channel image was converted into the monochrome image by using a “Channel
mixer” and then inverted. The inverted monochrome
image was adjusted by using a “Curves” tool until the
background was removed and each chromosome of the
spread became fuzzy-edged. The reduction of noise was
achieved by blurring of each pixel with the Gaussian blur
filter tool. The quality of the image was improved by additional application of the “Curves” and/or subtraction of
the “Relative white”. Finally, green channel image with
chromosomes was merged with monochrome image of
FISH signals. Processing yielded contrasted, inverted,
grayscale images with color labels, which are more suitable
for mapping.
Sequence data analysis

All sequences were edited and assembled using the Staden Package ver. 2003.1.6 [31]. When sequences yielded

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:292
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/292

a composite chromatogram at two or more sites, an
indirect approach of haplotype estimation was performed using the PHASE algorithm - a Bayesian
approach based on a priori prediction from the coalescent theory - implemented in DNAsp v5 [32]. After
removing non-coding portions, codon alignments were
recovered from each protein using MAFFT ver. 5 [33].
Basic analyses of genetic polymorphisms and neutrality tests were computed at the species level using DnaSP
v5 [32]. The statistical significance of neutrality tests
was obtained using 10000 coalescent simulations in
DnaSP v5. The average pairwise differences among species of the A. gambiae complex for each sequence dataset were calculated using Arlequin v3.11 [34].
A median-joining network [35] was built for each gene
with the program NETWORK version 4.510 http://www.
fluxus-engineering.com/ to display relationships among
the coding haplotype sequences.
A scan for recombination at each locus was performed
using the seven methods implemented in the RDP3 software [36]. Gene conversion was detected using GENECONV
[37]http://www.math.wustl.edu/~sawyer/
geneconv/ within alignments of the obtained haplotypes
by all paralogs. The statistical significance of highly
similar tracts (representing conversion events) identified
by GENECONV was scored by the permutation tests.
Gene expression

Tissues from MAG of 4- to 5-day-old virgin adults were
dissected in 1 × PBS solution from specimens of SUA
strain of A. gambiae, of OPHANSI strain of A. merus,
and of DONGOLA strain of A. arabiensis, and total
RNA was extracted from MAG, as well as from the rest
of male body (carcass) and whole adult female tissues
using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For each species, RNA was
extracted from three replicates obtained for each tissue
(MAG, male carcasses and whole adult female). Purified
RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen).
Reverse transcription reactions were performed in 20 uL
volumes by using 4 uL of 5 × First Strand Buffer, 2 uL
of 0.1 M DTT, 1 uL of 10 mM dNTPs, 150 ng of random hexamers, 1 ul of RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor, and 200 Units M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase (all reagents from Invitrogen). Resultant
cDNA was diluted to 10 ng/ul and and 1 ul was used as
a template for subsequent nested RT-PCR protocols.
Nested RT-PCR protocols (primer couples are reported
in Table 1, nested PCR conditions were the same as for
sequencing) were optimized to reliably distinguish paralog-specific transcripts and to determine their presence
even at low expression level, although preventing the
assessment of their relative abundance. Nested RT-PCRs
were replicated at least three times for each gene and

products were sequenced on both strands to confirm
their identity. The ribosomal gene S7 was used as a
positive control for all cDNA samples to prevent genomic DNA contamination (primer used for rpS7 amplification: Ag rpS7 fw 5’-GGCGATCATCATCTACGTGC3’, Ag rpS7 rev 5’-GTAGCTGCTGCAAACTTCGG-3’).
Immunostaining analysis of male accessory glands and
mating plug

Mating plugs dissected from recently mated A. gambiae
females, and MAG dissected from A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, and A. merus virgin 4- to 5-day-old males were
fixed in PBS 4% formaldehyde solution. After washing in
PBS, the samples were bleached with 2% hydrogen peroxide to reduce autofluorescence, washed in PBS and
then blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 1% BSA
and 0.1% Triton X-100. Then the samples were incubated with 1.38 μg/ml anti-AGAP009370-like (i.e.
AgAcp34A-2/3) in blocking buffer, washed, stained with
anti-Rabbit Alexa-488 (Invitrogen) at a 1:1000 dilution
followed by a 1:250 dilution of Phalloidin-Alexa-546
(Invitrogen) to stain actin. Tissues were then mounted
in DAPI-containing Vectashield medium (Vector
Laboratories, Inc.) and visualized using a Leica SP5
inverted confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axio Observer
inverted fluorescent microscope with apotome. Affinitypurified polyclonal antibodies against the AGAP009370like protein (i.e. AgAcp34A-2/3) were raised in rabbit
against a peptide epitope (CLPPFAKTLNEQFGQ; common to both AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3) by a commercial supplier (Gen-Script Corp., Piscataway, NJ).
Western blot

MAG, rest of male tissues and mating plugs of A. gambiae s.s. were homogenized in 15 μl of Extraction Buffer
(Tris-HCl 25 mM pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mM, EDTA 10
mM pH 8.0, protease inhibitor cocktail 1 × (CompleteMini, Roche), SDS 0.1%, Triton X-100 1%, Nonidet P-40
1%). After 15 minutes of incubation on ice, samples
were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C.
Protein concentration in the supernatant was then
quantified using Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories). NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) and
dithiotreitol at 100 mM final concentration were then
added to the protein extracts. Samples were then heated
at 70°C for 10 minutes and applied to precast NuPAGE
(Invitrogen) gels according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane using the XCell II Blot module (Invitrogen).
Blots were immunostained using standard protocols
with the following primary antibody titres: antiAGAP009370-like: 0.46 μg/ml; anti-b-actin (1:1000 dilution clone ZCA34 Invitrogen). HRPconjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies: sc-2030 and

sc-2314) were used at a dilution of 1:10000. Bands were
visualized using ECL Western Blotting detection
reagents (GE Heatlhcare) on an Fusion FX7 imaging
system (Vilbert Lonrmat).

Results
Identification of AgAcp34A-3, a novel gene duplicate of
AgAcp34A-2

Reproducible “permanent heterozygosity” in sequence
data - initially obtained from most of the analyzed individuals of the A. gambiae complex species using primers
placed on flanking regions of AgAcp34A-2 (Table 1) provided a first clue of the putative presence of a genomic duplication. The existence of an additional duplicate, AgAcp34A-3, was then confirmed by obtaining
specific amplification of both paralogs in all individuals
and by observing for each gene duplicate paralog-specific heterozygous SNPs (double peaks) in chromatograms. Blast searches on the annotated A. gambiae
assembly (AgamP3.6) failed to retrieve AgAcp34A-3 (9
hits on the genome corresponding to the sequences of
the genes annotated as AGAP009369, AGAP009370 or
AGAP0012706, but not to AgAcp34A-3; E-value = 1e-55
< E < 7e -17 ), thus indicating that this gene is not
mapped on the A. gambiae genome. However, when we
surveyed the trace read repositories of the whole A.
gambiae s.s. genome for the occurrence of these two
copies, we found 10 trace reads that unambigously
matched the AgAcp34A-3 reference sequence: 1 in
“PEST strain” (trace read ID: 117500516), 5 in M-form
“Mali-NIH strain” (trace read ID: 1543277868,
1537713761, 1527392852, 1517773106, 1524910694),
and 4 in S-form “Pimperena strain” (trace read ID:
1443434889, 1430388232, 1474892160, 1475087970). On
the contrary, when AgAcp34A-2 sequence was used as a
query, 10 and 2 trace reads stored in the A. gambiae
PEST strain and S-form database, respectively, perfectly
matched the reference sequence, whereas no match was
found in the M-form repository. Although the two “variants” are stored in both PEST and S-form strain trace
archives, only AgAcp34A-2 (i.e. AGAP009370) is annotated in the latest version of the A. gambiae genome
map, whereas only AgAcp34A-3 is assembled in the Sform contig ABKQ01012658.1 (scaffold EQ099715.1).
Interestingly, in both M- (ABKP02025712.1, scaffold
EQ090190.1) and S-form contigs (ABKQ01012658.1,
scaffold EQ099715.1) AgAcp34A-3 is placed exactly in
the same locus occupied by AgAcp34A-2 in the PEST
genome. It is worth noting that the flanking regions of
both paralogs are virtually undistinguishable, at least
based on the quality cut-off (> 20) of trace files. We
also retrieved “mate pairs” (i.e. the reads obtained by
sequencing the same clone on the opposite direction) of
recovered trace files to gain more information about the

Page 7 of 17

position of the two genes in the genome. We found that
when mate pairs were readable, they did not always map
between AGAP009368 (3R:31814166-31814685) and
AGAP009371 (3R:31822600-31823056), but were rather
placed within the 3R_hap_15 region (3174871131776836) that represents an alternative assembly of a
larger portion of chromosome 3R (3R:3174871131785547). This led us to suspect the presence of a
large duplicated genomic region containing AgAcp34A-3
possibly affecting the annotation of this gene.
FISH performed on A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and A.
merus chromosomes using two probes binding to
AgAcp34A-1 and to the common sequence of
AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3, respectively, each
returned a single signal in subdivision 34A of the 3Rchromosome arm (Figure 3).
Overall, these results suggest that AgAcp34A-3 is
located in the same chromosomal division as the other
two genes in A. gambiae s.s. and in all examined species
of the A. gambiae complex, indicating that a tandem
duplication occurred in this genomic region.
Polymorphism and divergence in coding sequences

A summary of intra-specific sequence variation in the A.
gambiae complex is shown in Table 2.
For AgAcp34A-1 a 300-bp coding sequence was
obtained from 48 individuals. On average, 46 segregating
sites were found (15% of the total number of nucleotide
sites) and 26 out 100 (26%) amino acid positions were
variable. The average nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.029
and 20 haplotypes were identified (out of 96 alleles).
The highest haplotype diversity (Hd) was found in A.
gambiae s.s. M- (0.80) and S- (0.83) forms. In general,
low π values were scored within A. gambiae species/
forms (0.000-0.009), both at synonymous (πs = 0.0000.012) and nonsynonymous (πa = 0.000-0.010) sites.
For AgAcp34A-2 a 294-bp coding sequence was
obtained from 65 individuals. On average, 20 segregating
sites were found (7% of the total number of nucleotide
sites) and 14 out 98 (14%) amino acid positions were
variable. The average π was 0.008 and 21 haplotypes
were identified (out 130 alleles). The highest Hd was
found in M- (0.87) and S- (0.67) forms. Low π values
were scored within A. gambiae species/forms (0.0000.012), both at synonymous (πs = 0.000-0.012) and nonsynonymous (πa = 0.000-0.013) sites.
For AgAcp34A-3 a 291 bp coding sequence was
obtained from 56 individuals. On average, 58 segregating
sites were found (20% of the total number of nucleotide
sites) and 36 out of 97 (37%) amino acid position were
variable. The average π was 0.038 and 38 haplotypes
were identified (out of 112 alleles). The highest Hd was
found in M- (0.93) and S- (0.91) forms. Notable high π
values were scored within A. gambiae s.s. molecular

Figure 3 FISH mapping of the genes on polytene chromosome of A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and A. merus. FISH was performed with a probe
specific to AgAcp34A-1 and a probe common to AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3 on polytene chromosomes of A. gambiae (top panel), A. arabiensis
(middle panel), and A. merus (bottom panel). Overlapping red and blue signals on chromosomes counterstained with YOYO-1 are shown on
merged images (a, d, g). The AgAcp34A-2/3 probe is labeled with Cy3-AP3-dUTP (red signal in b, e, h). The AgAcp34A-1 probe is labeled with Cy5AP3-dUTP (blue signal in c, f, i). Arrows indicate the site of localizations of the blue and red signals in subdivision 34A of the 3R arm.

forms (0.029) and A. arabiensis (0.017), at both synonymous (M- and S-forms πs = 0.043, A. arabiensis πs =
0.033) and nonsynonymous (M-form πa = 0.022, S-form
πa = 0.024, A. arabiensis = 0.013) sites.
At species level, the Tajima test [38] did not detect
any significant deviation from neutral expectation at
coding sites of all genes. However, for AgAcp34A-2
Tajima D statistics were negative in A. gambiae and

A. arabiensis, thus indicating an excess of rare or
recent mutations that could be due to a recent demographic expansion or to purifying selection. A high although nonsignificant - positive Tajima’s D value
was obtained for A. melas, indicating low levels of
both low and high frequency polymorphisms, possibly
because of a decrease in population size and/or balancing selection.

Finally, we observed low levels of sequence divergence
between A. gambiae molecular forms for all three genes
(AgAcp34A-1 = 0.005, AgAcp34A-2 = 0.012, AgAcp34A-3
= 0.036). The average pairwise sequence differences ranged from 0.003 (A. gambiae-M vs. A. arabiensis) to
0.124 (A. merus vs. A. quadriannulatus) for AgAcp34A1, from 0.003 (A. gambiae-S vs. A. quadriannulatus) to
0.020 (A. arabiensis vs. A. melas) for AgAcp34A-2, and
from 0.015 (A. arabiensis vs. A. merus) to 0.122 (A.
melas vs. A. quadriannulatus) for AgAcp34A-3.
Network analyses of coding haplotypes

The median-joining networks based on the AgAcp34A-1
coding sequence showed a clear separation of A. quadriannulatus and A. merus from the other species of the
complex (Figure 1b). In fact, haplotypes 1-H18, 1-H19
and 1-H20 were unique to A. quadriannulatus (which is
distinguished from all other species by 11 fixed speciesspecific replacements and 1 amino acid deletion, Figure

4), and separated from all other haplotypes by at least
18 nonsynonymous mutations (Figure 1b). Similarly,
haplotypes 1-H15, 1-H16 and 1-H17 were unique to A.
merus (which is distinct from all other species by 7
fixed species-specific replacements, Figure 4) and distant
for at least 13 nonsynoymous substitutions from all
other haplotypes. With the only exception of one allele
from Senegal population (1-H2), all other A. arabiensis
sequences were grouped in haplotype 1-H1, which is
also shared with 37% of A. gambiae M-form alleles (Figure 1b) and closely related to the A. melas specific haplotype 1-H14 (i.e. separated by a single synonymous
substitutions at position 126). Note that A. arabiensis
and A. melas share the same protein sequence (Figure
4). A slight separation between M- and S-forms can be
also observed: i) haplotypes 1-H8, 1-H9, 1-H10, 1-H11
and 1-H13 are closely related and S-form specific (owning 1 to 4 S-form private nonsynonymous substitutions,
Figure 1a); ii) haplotype 1-H12 is S-form specific,

Figure 4 Alignments of A. gambiae species proteins predicted from haplotypes obtained for each gene. Haplotypes coding for the same
protein (and named as in the median-joining networks in Figure 1) are reported on the left. A dot indicates the same residue as in the first
sequence, dashes indicate deletions. Species-specific fixed amino acid substitutions are coloured as follows: A. arabiensis: red, A. merus: violet, A.

although related to M-form specific haplotypes 1-H3
and 1-H4; iii) haplotype 1-H6 is shared by 21% and 8%
of S- and M-form alleles, respectively, and connected to
M-form specific haplotypes 1-H5 and 1-H7.
The network based on the AgAcp34A-2 haplotypes
(Figure 1c) showed nearly the same number of haplotypes if compared to the AgAcp34A-1 network (21

versus 20), although with a less clear separation between
A. gambiae species/forms. An interesting exception is
represented by haplotype 2-H1 and its peripheral closely
linked haplotypes 2-H2, 2-H3 and 2-H4, which are
unique to A. arabiensis. Notably, this separation is due
to a single and fixed nonsynonymous mutation at position 247 in the C-terminal portion that causes the

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:292
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/292

change of a glutamine (Q) to a glutamic acid (E) in A.
arabiensis (Figure 4). Two other high frequency haplotypes are shared by more than one taxon: 2-H7 which
includes all A. quadriannulatus and 31% - 37% of Mand S-form alleles respectively, and 2-H13 including
19% of M-form and 47% of S- form alleles. A. merus
shares haplotypes with the M-form (2-H6 and 2-H12)
and A. melas (2-H9), the latter being connected with
two A. melas specific and separated haplotypes (2-H19
and 2-H20).
A more complex network with 38 haplotypes was
reconstructed for AgAcp34A-3 (Figure 1d). In fact, most
of the haplotypes were unique, although two of them
were shared among some species (3-H4 and 3-H5) and
one between M- and S-forms only (3-H11). Exclusive
haplotypes of A. gambiae and A. arabiensis were interspersed but, in most cases, connected in the network
without any geographic structuring. Haplotype 3-H5 is
shared by A. arabiensis and A. merus and closely related
to all other 6 A. merus specific haplotypes. Interestingly,
we observed a clear separation of A. quadriannulatus
and A. melas from the other species of the complex
(Figure 1d): haplotypes 3-H36, 3-H37 and 3-H38 were
unique to A. quadriannulatus (which is distinguishable
from all other species by 4 fixed species-specific replacements, Figure 4) and haplotypes 3-H26, 3-H27, 3-H28,
3-H29 were unique to A. melas (bearing 3 fixed replacements unique for this species, Figure 4).
Protein diversity, identity levels of paralogs and gene
conversion

Figure 4 shows the alignment of protein types (associated to haplotypes in the networks) that are encoded
by the three paralogs.
There were 13 protein sequences in our AgAcp34A-1
sample (Figure 4). The species-specific proteins of A.
merus and A. quadriannulatus (encoded by haplotypes
1-H15 - 1-H20, see Figure 1b) differed by about 15% of
residues from those of A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and A.
melas, which differed from each other by only 1-4% of
amino acid residues. Few amino acid differences (3.5%)
were found among the 13 AgAcp34A-2 protein
sequences (Figure 4), whereas a higher number of
amino acid differences (6.9%) were scored among the 27
sequences found in our AgAcp34A-3 dataset (Figure 4).
Overall, AgAcp34A-2 shared 83% and 78% of residues
with AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-3, respectively. A relatively smaller number of residues (68%) were shared
between AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-3. All proteins
were very similar in their signal peptide portion (residues 1-16). AgAcp34A-1 was differentiated from
AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3 by 9 fixed replacements
and 2 amino acid deletions at the C-terminal portion
(residues 79-100). The C-terminal part of AgAcp34A-2

Page 11 of 17

and AgAcp34A-3 was highly conserved, while these two
copies differed by 14 fixed amino acid replacements and
1 residue deletion located at the N-terminal of the
secreted peptide. Regions of complete identity shared
among pairs of paralog haplotypes indicative of gene
conversion events were identified: a 125-147 bp long
gene conversion tract (from position 70 to position 195,
213 or 216) in the N-terminal portion between
AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-2 and a 94-106 bp long
converted fragments in the C-terminal portion (from
position 194 to position 288 or 300) between
AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3. Finally, a putative ectopic
recombination event (~40-60 bp long) involving the
genetically more distant paralogs, AgAcp34A-1 and
AgAcp34A-3, was detected and a 3’ recombination
breakpoint was identified at position 90 in the N-terminal portion.
Expression and protein localization

We used a nested RT-PCR approach to analyze the
expression of the three paralogs. This approach gives a
clear picture of the presence/absence of transcripts in
the analyzed tissues, because it allows detection of rare
transcripts, although their relative amounts cannot be
assessed. The three copies showed an identical expression pattern in the examined species (i.e. A. gambiae, A.
arabiensis and A. merus). The genes were expressed in
MAG (as well as in the rest of the body of adult males),
while no expression could be detected in females (Additional file 1). Sequencing of RT-PCR products confirmed
the identity of the three different transcripts.
Western blot analyses of A. gambiae s.s. adult male
tissues using polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal of an AGAP009370-like protein (i.e. AgAcp34A-2
and/or AgAcp34A-3) gave a 10 kDa band in MAG protein extracts, which corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of this protein (Figure 5a). Specific bands
were not present in the rest of male body (carcass) suggesting that MAG are the principal organs producing
this protein. Furthermore, a 15 kDa band was detected
in mating plug extracts (Figure 5a), confirming that the
AGAP009370-like protein is transferred to females during copulation: we hypothesize that the higher molecular
weight band observed for this protein in the mating plug
extract, as compared to that predicted and observed in
MAG, could be due to post-translational modifications
of these male factors.
Immunofluorescence analysis was used to localize the
AGAP009370-like protein in MAG and mating plugs
dissected from recently mated females (Figure 5b, c, d).
These experiments revealed that it was localized on the
“posterior tip” of the mating plug in A. gambiae s.s.,
where the seminal secretions are in close proximity to
the spermathecal duct (Figure 5b). In the MAG of all

AgAcp34A-3 gene products) using a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide fragment of the protein. AGAP009370-like is
detected in the male accessory glands (MAG) and mating plug, but not in the carcass (rest of the body) of adult males. Arrows indicate the
AGAP009370-like immunoreactive bands. Actin was used as a loading control. b) Confocal analysis of AGAP009370-like localization in the plug. The

three species. Scale bar: 50 μm. d) The apotome analysis reveals that AGAP009370-like (green) is either present in channels formed by phalloidinAlexa 546 (red)-labelled actin-rich muscle cells or in the lumen of the gland. The three species do not differ in this pattern. Here, channel localized
protein is shown for A. gambiae and A. arabiensis and lumen presence for A. merus. Nuclei are labeled with DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 20 μm.

three species, the protein is localized in the posterior
part of this organ (the portion near the aedeagus [20])
and accumulate in extracellular channels formed by the
muscle layer surrounding the glands (Figure 5c). In
some cases (as shown here for A. merus in Figure 5d)
the protein is also visible in the gland lumen.

Discussion
We analyzed an A. gambiae gene family in the “fertilization island” of chromosome arm 3R, where male-specific
genes possibly involved in modulating female post-mating behavioural responses are located [18]. The following evidence strongly suggest the presence of a duplicate
of AgAcp34A-2 gene, that we have named AgAcp34A-3:
i) a consistent, reproducible permanent heterozygosity
in sequence data obtained for AgAcp34A-2 in all specimens, and ii) the detection of SNPs (i.e. double peaks in
chromatograms) in each paralog-specific sequence.
Although trace reads of this novel duplicate are found
in the repository of the A. gambiae genome (as well as
in those of M- and S-forms), the annotation and localization of this copy on the genome map is probably hindered by the presence of a segmental duplication which
complicates the assembly. In fact, our FISH assays suggest that this gene is placed in the same chromosomal
division of AgAcp34A-2 in A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and
A. merus (Figure 3) and that a tandem duplication likely
occurred in this genomic region in a common ancestor
of the A. gambiae complex. Note that, presently, two
genes are reported as putative paralogs of AgAcp34A-2
in the A. gambiae genome: AGAP009369 (i.e.
AgAcp34A-1, sharing 86% of identity) - mapping on the
same chomosomal division as AgAcp34A-2 - and
AGAP012706 (99% of identity with AgAcp34A-2), which
is annotated on the artificial “unknown chromosome”
containing unassigned scaffolds. However, the high level
of identity between AGAP012706 and AgAcp34A-2 at
both coding/non-coding and flanking regions, raises
doubts on the actual existence of this additional paralog
and suggests that this should rather be considered an
alternative haplotype of AgAcp34A-2 [18].
Overall, the AgAcp34A-2 protein shares 83% and 78%
of amino acid residues with AgAcp34A-1 and
AgAcp34A-3 proteins, respectively. A relatively smaller
number of residues (68%) are shared between
AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-3 (see also Figure 4). Since
the three paralogs are present in all analyzed species, it
is likely that duplication events happened before the
split of Afrotropical A. gambiae complex species from a
common ancestor, and even before the divergence of
the complex from the Asian malaria vector A. stephensi.
In fact, we identified all three genes also in the latter
species (data not shown) and AgAcp34A-2 can be found
in its transcriptome [39]. Although it is difficult to

Page 13 of 17

determine with certainty when and how these duplications occurred, as well as the sequence of duplication
events, it is likely that the most closely related copies (i.
e. AgAcp34A-1 or AgAcp34A-3) could represent the
direct descendant of an ancestral gene from which the
other paralogs would have originated. A gene duplication of this ancestral gene could have given rise to a
copy that, as a result of functional redundancy [15],
would have been free to accumulate mutations along its
coding and flanking regions. Subsequently, a gene conversion event between these two copies would have
homogenized their N-terminal portions, as well as part
of their 5’ flanking regions. This would explain the finding of the high diversity observed mostly at the C-terminal and the 3’ flanking region between AgAcp34A-1 and
AgAcp34A-2 (Figure 4). A novel gene duplication event
(possibly due to an unequal cross-over) would have then
generated a third copy (the ancestor of AgAcp34A-3)
from an AGAP009370-like ancestral gene. Again, this
new duplicate would have accumulated mutations leading to fixation of several amino acid changes possibly
under selective pressure. The finding of several replacements in the N-terminal portion of the AgAcp34A-3
secreted peptide leads us to hypothesize that this region
represents the least constrained part of the protein,
where the fixation of novel mutations could more easily
occur. Finally, other homogenization events among the
three genes (e.g. an ectopic recombination, as inferred
between AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-3) likely contributed to the evolution of these paralogs, complicating the
interpretation of their evolutionary patterns: for
instance, the degree of sequence variation observed in
flanking regions of AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-2 is consistent with the hypothesis that these two duplicates originated earlier than AgAcp34A-3, whose flanking regions
nearly perfectly match those of AgAcp34A-2, thus indicating a more recent origin. However, we cannot rule
out the hypothesis that AgAcp34A-3 could be the actual
ancestral gene from which AgAcp34A-2 (and, later,
AgAcp34A-1) would have originated. However, this
would have required an extensive homogenization process between AgAcp34A-2 and AgAcp34A-3 leading to
decreased nucleotide diversity in flanking regions, but
not in coding regions. Additional data are needed to
assess the orthology, synteny and diversity of these
genes in other Anopheles species and to clarify the
sequence of duplication events generating the copies of
this gene family.
From a functional perspective, gene duplication is
believed to increase the plasticity of transcriptomes
[15,40]. In fact, novel copies, being initially free from
selective pressure because of their functional redundancy, depending on the relative forces of selection and
drift may: i) remain very similar to the original copy and

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:292
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/292

maintain the same function; ii) diverge and acquire a
new function (neo-functionalization); or iii) lose their
function and become pseudogenes (pseudogenization).
Although we do not have direct allele-specific evidence
of protein translation, we did not detect mutations in
nucleotide sequences of any of the three genes that
could impair the ability of some haplotypes to code for
a functional protein. Furthermore, we found that all
three genes were transcribed in males of at least 3 species (A. gambiae s.s., A. arabiensis and A. merus) (Additional file 1), suggesting that pseudogenization has not
occurred. Previous RT-PCR assays had shown that
AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-2 were exclusively
expressed in MAG of A. gambiae s.s. [18], although
these experiments were not designed to efficiently distinguish among transcripts produced by the three paralogs. Recently, mass spectrometry proteomic analysis
demonstrated that AgAcp34A-2 (and/or AgAcp34A-3,
but no data are available to confirm the presence of
AgAcp34A-1) is among the proteins expressed exclusively in MAG of A. gambiae s.s and among the components of the mating plug [20]. Indeed our immunofluorescence assays confirmed that an AGAP009370-like
protein is specifically expressed in the posterior part of
MAG in all Anopheles species here examined (Figure 5c,
d) and showed that one or both proteins are concentrated at the posterior tip of the A. gambiae s.s. mating
plug (Figure 5b). As the antibody used in immunofluorescence might recognize both AgAcp34A-2 and
AgAcp34A-3, we cannot state with certainty whether
one or both proteins are transferred to females during
copulation. Regardless, the specific localization of the
AGAP009370-like protein on the portion of the mating
plug that is in close proximity to the duct connecting
the atrium to the spermatheca suggests two considerations: i) the process of plug formation and transfer is
spatially and temporally organized, and ii) the
AGAP009370-like protein might play a role in sperm
function upon migration to the spermatheca.
In Drosophila, the comparisons of gene sequences
within and between species have shown that Acps are
rapidly evolving and that many paralogs that arose by
gene duplication events have diverged rapidly from their
ancestral copy under directional selection, leading in
some circumstances to the acquisition of lineage-specific
duplicates [4-12]. The availability of multiple Drosophila
genome sequences has allowed evaluation of the evolutionary hypotheses of positive selection on these malespecific reproductive proteins in a robust phylogenetic
and functional context. In contrast, the lack of genomic
data on Anopheles taxa other than A. gambiae s.s. and
the absence of a reliable phylogenetic background do
not allow to infer the evolution of characters along welldefined lineages (e.g. in monophyletic sister-groups)

Page 14 of 17

[21,41]. Furthermore, although the A. gambiae complex
represents an interesting model to study the adaptive
evolution of genes potentially involved in reproductive
isolation, the pervasive incomplete lineage sorting of
alleles among closely related species affects the interpretation of genetic estimates and the application of selection models [21,42]. Similarly to what has been reported
for other genes of this complex [21,43-45], we found
several haplotypes shared by multiple A. gambiae species in all of the three paralogs, due either to introgressive hybridization and/or to retention of ancestral
polymorphisms. Despite this, we observed fixed speciesspecific replacements in at least one gene from each
taxon along their geographical distribution, with the
exception of A. gambiae s.s. (Figures 1 and 4). In
AgAcp34A-2, one fixed species-specific replacement (i.e.
a glutamine (Q) to a glutamic acid (E) change in the
QLLQLLQLL sequence motif at the C-terminal) is
observed in A. arabiensis (Figure 4b). To our knowledge,
this represents the first report of an amino acid substitution in a gene positioned in an area of an autosome
not affected by chromosomal inversion polymorphisms
that clearly distinguishes A. arabiensis from A. gambiae
s.s.. In fact, extensive genetic exchange of autosomal
sequences has been frequently reported between these
two largely sympatric sibling species [44,46,47]. Since it
has been suggested that genes involved in reproductive
isolation may be protected against extensive gene flow
[44], it is tempting to speculate on a possible role of
AgAcp34A-2 to the reproductive isolation between A.
gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis.
In the other two genes, a higher number of fixed substitutions is observed in those species of the complex
characterized by a more restricted geographic distribution: A. merus shows very high level of differentiation in
AgAcp34A-1, A. melas in AgAcp34A-3 and A. quadriannulatus in both genes (Figure 4a, c). As discussed in studies on the molecular evolution of other genes in this
species group [21,41,42], genetic drift might have contributed as a major force in the diversification of these
geographically more restricted species and would have
thus determined the fixation of species-specific substitutions (and, therefore, lineage-sorting).
It is interesting to note that almost all species-specific
substitutions are placed in the C- and N-terminal portions of the secreted peptides: since these are the most
strongly differentiated regions among the three paralogs,
it is likely that these regions might be the least constrained portions of the three proteins. Alternatively, if
these substitutions are affecting the protein functions,
their fixation might be preferentially explained by positive selection.
The selective forces shaping the evolution of these
genes cannot be fully clarified here due to the above

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:292
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/292

cited limits in the application of selection inferences in
the A. gambiae complex and to the lack of other information to corroborate the possible significance of the
observed amino acid replacements (e.g., no structural
conserved domains are recognisable for these proteins,
neither indications of possible interaction with other
molecules/proteins are available). However, our data
provide some clues to the evolutionary forces that may
have contributed to the diversification of the paralogs.
In all three genes most polymorphisms occurred at
synonymous rather than at nonsynonymous sites (Table
2). We can thus hypothesize that purifying selection
operates to retain the structure and function of these
proteins. Moreover, AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-2
appear to be more conserved than AgAcp34A-3 (Table
2, Figure 3 and 4). This is particularly evident when
comparing the levels of genetic polymorphisms in A.
gambiae s.s. and A. arabiensis (Table 2): the average π
values computed over all sites are comparable for
AgAcp34A-1 and AgAcp34A-2, ranging from 0.0 to 0.9%,
whereas ~2-3 fold higher values are found for
AgAcp34A-3 (1.7% to 2.9%). One of the main findings of
genomic studies is that duplicate genes do not evolve
symmetrically [48], i.e. they do not evolve at the same
rate, due either to differences in recombination rate or
to relaxation of negative selection and/or an increase in
positive selection. Since the three genes are located in
the same chromosomal area (at least within ~100 kb,
the limit of resolution of a tandem duplication by
FISH), they should be subject to the same mutation and
recombination rates. It is then more plausible to
hypothesize a relaxation of negative selection in
AgAcp34A-3: in fact, the higher π values found at
synonymous versus non-synonymous sites likely indicate
that purifying selection is more relaxed than in the
other two paralogs. This implies that, the resulting protein could tolerate a higher number of amino acid
changes, but purifying selection still prevents pseudogenization preserving its function. If both AGAP009370like proteins were expressed in MAG and transferred to
females as part of the mating plug, the observed differences in the selective regime between AgAcp34A-2 and
AgAcp34A-3 could be related to different interactions
between these factors and proteins expressed in the
female lower reproductive tract. In this case a possible
specialization into different (but, probably, complementary) functions during the post-mating processes can be
hypothesized.

Conclusions
Proteins in seminal fluids have roles in modulating
female behavioral and physiological responses in many
insect species [1-3]. A significant number of these proteins evolve rapidly, but the forces driving these patterns

Page 15 of 17

are still not well understood. In polyandrous species,
such as Drosophila, sexual selection and/or conflict due
to male-female protein interactions have been hypothesized as the principal mechanisms of rapid divergence of
Acps [4-12]. However, other evolutionary mechanisms
may play a role in monandrous species and in species
with different mating systems [21,49]. Whatever the
causes of this unusual pattern of evolution, it has been
argued that the analysis of genetic divergence of seminal
fluid proteins should be preferentially performed among
closely related species to illuminate the selective forces
underlying their evolution [1-3]. However, the lack of a
strong phylogenetic background for closely-related species prevents mapping adaptively evolving characters
through reliable species-trees, thus hindering the interpretation of the observed evolutionary patterns [21,42].
Despite these limits, assessing the polymorphisms and
divergence of genes that may alter reproductive behaviours in medically relevant insect species, such as the
mosquitoes of the A. gambiae complex, is essential to
provide information on the genetic variability of molecules that could potentially be exploited to develop strategies aimed at limiting the fertility of malaria vectors in
field populations [2,3].
Our results indicate the existence of species-specific
products for three Acp-like A. gambiae paralogs that
may be indicative of unique species-specific regulations
and/or functions. In addition, similarly to Drosophila
Acps, the presence of three duplicated genes likely
favoured different rates of evolution for the copies,
increasing the probability of recovering rare favorable
mutations and allowing the fixation of replacements (e.
g. through positive selection) in different lineages,
thereby increasing the plasticity of the transcriptome.
This pattern is partly similar to what we observed for
genes encoding female serine proteases involved in A.
gambiae s.s. post-mating processes, in which duplication
events possibly provided a way to relax selective constraints in some copies, allowing the fixation of novel
variants and conferring adaptation of these proteins to
different male-derived substrates in diverging lineages
[21]. Preliminary genetic data on AGAP009368 (Plugin)
provide further indications that different selective forces
could act to change the rate of evolution of A. gambiae
male-expressed genes, putatively as a consequence of
different functional phenotypes. In fact, although this
gene is placed just ~2 kb apart from the gene cluster
here analysed here, it is strongly conserved among all
the species of the A. gambiae complex (EM, unpublished results), consistent with its essential role in the A.
gambiae post-mating mechanisms [20].
Anopheles gambiae male-expressed proteins that are
transferred with the mating plug must interact with proteins of the female lower reproductive tract. Progress in

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:292
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/292

understanding the signaling cascade in the A. gambiae
reproductive pathways will elucidate the interaction of
MAG-expressed proteins with the female counterparts.
This knowledge will allow a better evaluation of the
relative importance of genes associated with the reproductive isolation and fertility of A. gambiae species and
will help the interpretation of the observed evolutionary
dynamics.
