Genome-wide functional analysis of human 5’
untranslated region introns

Abstract
Background: Approximately 35% of human genes contain introns within the 5’ untranslated region (UTR). Introns
in 5’UTRs differ from those in coding regions and 3’UTRs with respect to nucleotide composition, length
distribution and density. Despite their presumed impact on gene regulation, the evolution and possible functions
of 5’UTR introns remain largely unexplored.
Results: We performed a genome-scale computational analysis of 5’UTR introns in humans. We discovered that the
most highly expressed genes tended to have short 5’UTR introns rather than having long 5’UTR introns or lacking
5’UTR introns entirely. Although we found no correlation in 5’UTR intron presence or length with variance in
expression across tissues, which might have indicated a broad role in expression-regulation, we observed an
uneven distribution of 5’UTR introns amongst genes in specific functional categories. In particular, genes with
regulatory roles were surprisingly enriched in having 5’UTR introns. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of 5’UTR
introns in non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (NRTK), and identified a conserved DNA motif enriched within the
5’UTR introns of human NRTKs.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that human 5’UTR introns enhance the expression of some genes in a lengthdependent manner. While many 5’UTR introns are likely to be evolving neutrally, their relationship with gene
expression and overrepresentation among regulatory genes, taken together, suggest that complex evolutionary
forces are acting on this distinct class of introns.

Background
The advent, evolution and functional significance of
introns in eukaryotes have been topics of intense debate
over the past 30 years (reviewed in [1,2]). There are two
major opposing views on when introns arose in evolution; this ‘introns-early’ versus ‘introns-late’ controversy
is reviewed in [1,2]. Also, debate exists on what causes
their frequent losses and gains [3,4] and whether they
have any adaptive significance.
Neutral or nearly neutral population genetic processes
under general, non-adaptive conditions have been suggested to result in dynamic gains and losses of introns.
Such neutral processes could account for some of the
observed patterns of intron presence [5], but do not rule
out the possibility that adaptive processes are simultaneously contributing to the maintenance of some
introns. Introns have been suggested to confer adaptive

advantages by functioning in diverse mechanisms ranging from modifying recombination rates to increasing
the efficacy of natural selection [6,7], and even to protecting exons from deleterious R-loops [8]. A relatively
well-understood functional role of introns is to facilitate
the production of distinct forms of mature mRNA
through alternative splicing [9-12]. Recent genome-wide
analyses suggest that nearly 95% of all human genes are
alternatively spliced [13-15]. Many alternative splicing
events are tissue-specific, and functional regulatory elements in exons and introns are associated with tissue
specificity of these variants [16,17]. Therefore, introns
can contribute to gene regulation.
Most of the theoretical and empirical work on the
evolution of introns has focused on those found in coding regions, yet an appreciable fraction of human genes
(approximately 35%) contain introns in their 5’UTRs
[18]. Introns in 5’UTRs are twice as long as those in
coding regions, on average, and moderately lower in
density, such that 5’UTRs contain a lower percentage of

intronic bases than do coding regions [19]. By contrast,
3’UTRs are typically much longer than 5’UTRs but a
study in human, mouse, fruit fly and mustard weed have
shown that relatively few 3’UTRs (<5%) contain introns
[19]. This observation is partly explained by nonsensemediated decay given that an intron downstream of the
stop codon would typically signal a transcript for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay [20,21]. In addition,
splicing signals within 3’UTRs have been suggested to
have reduced maintaining selection and, therefore,
3’UTRs tend to be longer and contain fewer introns
compared to 5’UTRs [22]. In summary, these differences
suggest that introns in different regions of genes constitute distinct functional classes with unique evolutionary
histories.
As 5’UTR introns (5UIs) are unusually long and can
considerably increase the total number of bases transcribed for a given gene, it is useful to consider the two
main adaptationist theories about the functional consequences of intron length. The first model argues that it
is energetically costly for cells to transcribe long
stretches of DNA that does not encode protein [23]. By
this reasoning, total intronic length should be relatively
low in highly expressed genes. Consistent with this prediction, the most highly expressed genes tend to have
shorter introns in both humans and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans [23], and there seems to be additional
selective pressures towards having shorter proteins and
more biased codon usage [24,25]. However, an opposite
effect is observed in Oryza and Arabidopsis, such that
highly expressed genes have more and longer introns
[26]. If the selection against longer introns in highly
expressed genes minimizes the energetic cost of unnecessary transcription, this observation is unexpected, as
we would expect the model to hold across all taxa.
The second model, termed ‘genome design’, posits
that the pressure to maintain many intronic regulatory
elements favors longer introns in tissue-specific genes
[27]. The main supporting observation for this hypothesis is that human ‘housekeeping’ genes tend to be compact, with fewer and shorter introns as well as shorter
coding regions relative to tissue-specific genes [28,29].
Tissue-specific genes, on the other hand, tend to have
longer and more conserved introns, perhaps because
their functional complexity requires a more stringent
level of regulation [30]. Furthermore, genes with higher
functional complexity tend to be longer and seem to be
under more complex regulation [27]. However, analyses
of human antisense genes contradict the claims of the
genome design hypothesis [31,32]. These studies showed
that antisense genes, which need to be expressed rapidly,
are compact but can be tissue-specific regulators [31,32].
Curiously, some studies supporting the genome design
hypothesis explicitly disregard 5UIs (see methods in

Page 2 of 17

[27]) even though these introns might be expected to
include regulatory elements, being closer to transcription and often to translation start sites [33,34].
Neither of these two principal theories addresses the
possible role of 5UIs and the evolutionary pressures acting on them; therefore, the functional significance, if
any, of their frequent occurrence remains unclear. Given
that splicing of these sequences seemingly has no effect
on the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, it is
unclear what selective benefit might accompany their
removal from the mature mRNA. The reduced splicesite conservation and high variability in length of 5UIs
have led to the suggestion that they contract and expand
without significant functional consequences [19]. However, an exception to the trend of reduced splice-site
conservation is observed in Cryptococcus, an intron-rich
fungus with longer 5’ and 3’ UTR introns than coding
region introns [35] and high conservation near UTR
intron boundaries [36].
Given these conflicting results and the scarcity of studies regarding the evolution of UTR introns, it is worthwhile to consider a functional perspective. An analysis
of functional trends among human genes with 5UIs
could lead to a better understanding of their evolution
and also potentially to the detection of novel mechanisms of regulation mediated by these introns. Here, we
analyze expression profiles of genes with 5UIs and
examine the distribution of these introns in different
functional categories of genes.

Results
Characterization of a set of genes with 5’UTR introns

To investigate the functional properties of human 5UIs,
we used NCBI’s Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection.
These are curated, full-length sequences with annotated
UTR boundaries, and expression data are available for
many of them. The lack of a translation reading frame
makes the computational prediction of splice sites in
5’UTRs inherently more difficult [37], necessitating the
choice of such a validated set. In humans, approximately
8.5k (35%) out of 24.5k RefSeq mRNAs contained at
least one intron in their 5’UTR (Additional file 1). Previous estimates of the percentage of genes with 5UIs
ranged between 22% and 26% [18] and 38% [19] in
humans, suggesting that the RefSeq collection had no
major bias in terms of presence or absence of 5UIs
compared to other previously used datasets. The distribution of total 5’UTR intronic length for genes in our
dataset was also similar to that observed previously (Figure 1a). The inter-quartile range of total length of 5UIs
within each gene was approximately 1.3 - 16 kb. Some
5UIs were extremely long – 16% were longer than 27
kb, the length of the average protein coding gene in the
human genome [38], and 5% were longer than 76 kb

of RefSeq transcript IDs are used in this analysis and this histogram shows the distribution of the log10 of the total number of intronic
nucleotides in the 5’UTR. (b) Distribution of the number of introns in the 5’UTR. The log10 of number of transcripts that have a given number of
introns in their 5’UTR is shown. The number of transcripts with a given number of 5’UTR introns decreases exponentially. (c) Heat map depicting
the relationship between total lengths of 5’UTR introns and 5’UTR exons. (d) Heat map depicting the relationship between total lengths of 5’UTR
introns and non-5’UTR introns. In both heatmaps, darker shades of gray indicate more transcripts.

(Figure 1a). As previously reported [18,19], most genes
had few 5UIs. More than 90% had a single intron, and
the percentage of genes with two or more introns
decreased exponentially (Figure 1b).
We next considered the relationship between the total
lengths of 5’UTR exons and of 5UIs. Even though there
was a correlation between the lengths of 5UIs and
5’UTR exons overall, this correlation was slight and was
driven by the genes with the longest 5UIs (Figure 1c;
Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson correlation
coefficient (PCC) = 0.21, P < 2.2e-16). In fact, when
genes with 5UI lengths in the lowest 25th percentile
were analyzed, the correlation was no longer significant
(Figure 1c; PCC = -0.005, P = 0.84). A statistically significant, albeit slight, correlation was found for genes with
5UI length below the median (Figure 1c; PCC = 0.07,
P = 8.4e-05). Among the genes with 5UIs, a similar relationship was evident between the total length of 5UIs
and the total length of the remaining introns (Figure
1d). Although these two variables were significantly correlated (Figure 1d; PCC = 0.18, P < 2.2e-16), the relationship was clearly driven by the genes with longer

5UIs. When genes with 5UI lengths either in the lowest
25th or 50th percentile were considered, correlation was
negligible (Figure 1d; PCC = -0.02 and 0.04, P = 0.53
and 0.04, respectively).
Thus, genes with long 5UIs tend to have a high total
intronic length and longer 5’UTR exons. While this tendency holds in genes with additional introns, several
genes with total 5UI lengths greater than 10 kb lack any
coding-region or 3’UTR introns (Figure 1d). On the
other hand, amongst genes with short 5UIs, the total
length of 5UIs is uncorrelated with the lengths of either
5’UTR exons or the remaining introns.
Gene expression analysis

We next examined gene expression-related predictions
of the two principal models of intron evolution. Previous
studies have suggested that the genes with the highest
expression levels are selected to have shorter introns
[23]. If a similar selective pressure were acting on 5UIs
(in conjunction with neutral evolutionary processes
[19]), one would expect a tendency towards reduced
gene expression level as a function of increased 5UI

length in a subset of genes. We therefore compared
gene expression from 79 tissues as a function of the
total 5’UTR intronic length. We divided 5UI-containing
genes into three categories with respect to the total
5’UTR intronic length (short, 0 to 25%; intermediate, 25
to 75%; long, 75 to 100% in length). The short 5UI-containing genes were highly overrepresented in the top 1%
of mean expression level for the genes with 5UIs (Fisher’s exact test, P = 3.3e-15) and also in the top 5% (Fisher’s exact test, P = 1.7e-14) (Figure 2a). These genes
were 12.7 times more likely than all other genes with
5UIs to be in the highest 1% of mean expression and 3
times more likely to be in the highest 5% of mean
expression. There was also a global trend for genes with
short 5UIs to be expressed at a higher level compared
to genes with longer 5UIs (25 to 100 percentile in
length; one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 2.98e-05;
Figure 2a).
The enrichment for high expression in genes with
short 5UIs held even when genes with the longest 25%
of 5UIs were removed. In this case, the genes with the
highest 1% and 5% expression were, respectively, 9.5
times and 2.5 times more likely to have short 5UIs as
opposed to intermediate length 5UIs (25 to 75 percentile in length; Fisher’s exact test, P = 1.53e-11 and
P = 3.21e-10, respectively).
The most highly expressed 5UI-bearing genes show a
striking tendency to harbor short 5UIs. Of all 5UI-containing genes, 26% had a total 5UI length below 1.3 kb.
By contrast, the corresponding fractions for genes in the
top 5% and 1% by expression were 50% and 83%, respectively. We then separated short 5UI-containing genes
into two groups: the most highly expressed genes (top 5%
in expression); and the remaining genes. For the most
highly expressed genes, the inter-quartile range of total
5UI length was 215 to 734 nucleotides compared with
289 to 870 nucleotides for the remaining genes (Figure
2b). Thus, the most highly expressed genes in humans
are very strongly enriched for short 5UIs.
Interestingly, no expression dependence was observed
among genes with intermediate or long 5UIs: genes with
long 5UIs (top 25th percentile in length) did not tend to
be expressed less than those with the intermediate
length 5UIs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.25). Also,
no statistically significant depletion for the long 5UI
category was observed in either the top 1% or the top
5% expression group (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.29, odds
ratio = 0.25, and P = 0.017, odds ratio = 0.58, respectively). Thus, we did not observe the inverse relationship
between expression and total 5UI length that might
have been expected under the energetic cost model.
Next, we considered all RefSeq genes and asked
whether having an intron in the 5’UTR has an effect on

Page 4 of 17

overall expression. We found no differences in 5UI
representation in the top 1% or the top 5% of the mean
expression groups. Furthermore, no difference was
detected in the distribution of mean expression between
genes with and without 5UIs (two-sided Wilcoxon rank
sum test, P = 0.17). However, genes with short 5UIs
were 1.8 times more likely to be in the top 5% and 3.3
times more likely to be in the top 1% in overall expression level than genes with no 5UIs (Fisher’s Exact Test,
P = 3.15e-08 and P = 7.57e-07, respectively) than genes
with no 5UIs (Figure 2c). Thus, the presence of short
5UIs is correlated with high mean expression.
The observed expression trends could reflect the influence of genomic features other than 5UIs. Yet, short
5UIs do not seem to predict a short total length of
either non-5’UTR introns or 5’UTR exons (Figure 1c, d).
Furthermore, when genes in the top 5% in mean expression were divided into two groups with respect to 5UI
presence or absence, we observed no differences in total
non-5’UTR intron length between genes with 5UIs and
those that lack these introns (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P
= 0.20, data not shown). Therefore, the tendency of
highly expressed genes to have short 5UIs is unlikely to
be confounded by the effects of 5’UTR exons or the
remaining introns.
For genes with the highest expression levels, these
results are in contrast to the neutral model of 5UI evolution, which predicts that 5’UTR intronic length should
not depend on expression level. These results are also
not explained by the energetic cost hypothesis, which
would predict that genes with the highest expression
levels should be less likely to have 5UIs. In stark contrast to the predictions of each model, we found the
most highly expressed genes to be significantly enriched
in short 5UIs. Furthermore, the energetic cost hypothesis would also predict a linear decrease in the total 5UI
length as a function of increasing gene expression. Yet,
we found no overall differences with respect to 5UI
length except for the most highly expressed genes. Even
though a neutral model of 5UI evolution is plausible for
most genes, our results for the most highly expressed
genes are inconsistent with both neutral and energetic
cost models (Figure 2d).
We next used expression to assess the applicability to
5UIs of the other major hypothesis of intron evolution,
the ‘genome design model’, which predicts that intermediate or long introns should be enriched in tissuespecific genes as a consequence of complex regulation.
As originally outlined, the genome design model explicitly disregards 5UIs [27]; however, a direct corollary of
this hypothesis is that genes with higher variance in
expression across tissues should have intermediate or
long introns in their 5’UTRs as well.

width of the boxes represents the relative number of data points in each category. Transcripts in the top 1% and top 5% in expression level
tend to have shorter 5’UTR introns.

We sought to address two potential sources of bias.
First, gene expression levels vary greatly and variance
is strongly correlated with mean expression. Therefore,
we calculated the standard deviation-to-mean ratio
(coefficient of variation or CV) [39], a normalized measure of dispersion, for each gene across all tissues.

Second, due to technological limitations of expression
arrays, precise measurement of expression level is
more difficult for genes with low or no expression in a
given tissue; therefore, artificially high variance in
expression might be observed for genes with low
mean expression across all tissues. We therefore

Cenik et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R29
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R29

calculated a robust measure of dispersion that minimizes this effect:
CV x   1 / 2 ( y x )
MAD( y x )

where CVx is the CV of expression of gene x across all
tissues, yx represents the vector of CV values for all 201
genes in a window centered around gene x, while μ1/2
and MAD represent the median and median absolute
deviation, respectively. As expected, genes with low
expression tended to have much more variability across
tissues (Figure 3a). Based on the observed trend line, the
genes with the lowest 25% expression were removed
from further analysis (Figure 3a). The remaining genes
were sorted into three categories with respect to the
total intronic 5’UTR length as before (short, 0 to 25%;
intermediate, 25 to 75%; long, 75 to 100%). We found
no significant differences between these groups with
respect to inter-tissue variability as measured by the
coefficient of variation (Figure 3b; Kruskal-Wallis rank
sum test, df = 2, P = 0.23). We then examined the
lengths of the introns as a function of variability in
expression (Figure 3c). The genes with the highest 5%
variability across tissues did not differ from the other
genes with respect to their 5UI lengths (Wilcoxon rank
sum test, P = 0.07, 95% confidence interval between
-0.008 and 0.25), but the genes with highest 1% acrosstissue variability tended to have slightly shorter 5UIs
(Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.006, 95% confidence
interval between -0.67 and -0.11). Genes with short
5UIs were also overrepresented in the top 1% across-tissue variability category (Fisher’s Exact Test, P = 0.005,
odds-ratio = 2.7). Our results suggested that length of
the 5UI was not a major factor in determining acrosstissue variability but there was a preference for shorter
5UIs in the most variable genes.
Although our approach reliably captures across-tissue
variability in gene expression, it disregards any potential
effects of 5UI presence or length on how widely a gene is
expressed. To consider the potential impact of such
effects, we calculated the number of tissues in which
expression was detected for each gene. Based on our analysis presented in Figure 3a, we defined a given gene as
‘present’ in a given tissue if its expression was greater
than the 25th percentile in the distribution of mean
expression over all tissues, calculated for all genes. Genes
were placed into one of five classes according to the
number of tissues in which they were present. No significant difference was detected amongst the corresponding
five distributions of total 5UI length (Figure 3d; KruskalWallis rank sum test, df = 4, P = 0.19). Furthermore, the
distribution of number of tissues in which each gene was
present did not differ between genes containing and

Page 6 of 17

lacking 5UIs (Figure 3e). These results clearly contradict
predictions of the ‘genome design’ hypothesis, in that
narrowly expressed genes did not show a greater tendency to contain 5UIs nor did they tend to have longer
5UIs. These results strongly suggest that the evolution of
5UIs is not driven primarily by the selective pressures
proposed by the ‘genome design’ hypothesis.
Functional enrichment of Gene Ontology categories

Under the neutral model, genes with 5UIs should be
uniformly distributed across functional groups. We used
Gene Ontology (GO) function annotations to determine
which groups of genes are enriched or depleted in 5UIs,
if any. Two popular functional trend analysis tools, FuncAssociate [40] and GoStat [41], were used for this analysis. One key challenge was the translation of the gene
identifiers from RefSeq RNA IDs to those used in the
GO database. There are different approaches to this
problem and the two software packages differ from each
other in this respect. FuncAssociate uses the Synergizer
[42] software to resolve the problem of synonyms while
GoStat uses definitions in the UniGene database as well
as the information provided in the GO databases. Both
software packages yielded very similar results, suggesting
that our general conclusions were independent of the
methods of synonym resolution or enrichment
calculation.
A significant overrepresentation of genes with 5UIs
was found in many regulatory pathways (Table 1). Nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) formed the
most highly overrepresented group, followed by genes
involved in the regulation of actin organization, transcriptional regulators, and zinc ion binding proteins
(Table 1). NRTKs lack transmembrane domains and
therefore do not recognize extracellular ligands, unlike
the majority of protein tyrosine kinases. Nevertheless,
they play crucial roles in nearly all aspects of biology
and are implicated in many cancers (reviewed in [43]).
Among NRTKs, genes harboring 5UIs encode key regulatory kinases, such as the proto-oncogene tyrosine
kinase SRC, c-src tyrosine kinase (CSK), janus kinases
(JAK), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), tec protein tyrosine
kinase (TEC), and Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine
kinase (BTK) among others.
To gain insight into the evolution of NRTK 5UIs, we
identified orthologous genes in mouse and rat genomes
corresponding to each human NRTK. We collected
5’UTR features for these genes in each genome using
RefSeq annotations (Additional file 2). More widely studied organisms tend to have more accurate transcript
structures and include many more splice variants in the
RefSeq collection. For example, 18 human genes were
represented by more than one transcript, while only
four mouse and no rat NRTKs had more than one splice

expression have higher normalized expression variability. A standardized measure of the variability in gene expression across tissues was
calculated and plotted against the natural logarithm of mean expression level. The black vertical line represents the lowest 25th percentile in
mean expression. Since transcripts with low levels of mean expression tend to exhibit an artificially high variability in expression, they are
removed from further analysis. (b) Boxplot of the coefficient of variation (standard deviation-to-mean ratio) of genes grouped by the total length

between the three groups (c) Boxplot of log10 of total 5’UTR intron length of genes grouped by their across-tissue variability. Genes are divided
into six categories depending on their coefficient of variation. Error bars correspond to standard deviation of the mean. No obvious dependence
of expression variability to total 5UI length can be observed except for the most highly variable genes, which tend to have slightly shorter 5’UTR
introns. (d) Boxplot of log10 of total 5’UTR intron length for gene groups defined by the number of tissues in which expression of each gene
was detected. A gene was defined to have detectable expression in a given tissues if its expression was higher than the 25th percentile of mean

genes divided by the presence of 5’UTR introns and by the number of tissues in which expression was detected. The number of tissues in which

variant. The paucity of transcripts in some mammalian
species is more likely to have arisen from limited testing
rather than biology, given recent studies suggesting that
alternative splicing is ubiquitous across several taxa [9].
UTRs are also generally less well defined in less intensively studied organisms. For example, ABL2, BTK, FRK

and SRC all lack defined 5’UTR boundaries in the rat
RefSeq collection, even though EST evidence suggests
that SRC, BTK and ABL2 all have 5’UTR-containing
transcripts (data not shown). Another current limitation
is ambiguity in identifying the specific branch in which
a given deletion or insertion event took place. Despite

N represents the number of transcripts in the RefSeq collection that have both a 5’UTR intron and a given GO attribute; X represents the total number of
transcripts having that GO attribute. For each attribute, P is the nominal P-value obtained from a one-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test that calculates the probability that
at least N transcripts have the particular attribute given the number of genes with 5’UTR introns. This nominal P-value is adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing
to yield P-adj using a resampling approach that accounts for dependencies among the tested hypotheses (see [40] for precise procedure). The table is sorted in
descending order by the log10 of the odds ratio (LOD score), where

LOD 

( N  e )/( q  N  e )
and M is the number of all genes, e is a
( X  N  e )/( M  q  X  N  e )

these shortcomings, a comparison of orthologs already
provides insight into the dynamics of the evolution of
5UIs in NRTK genes.
When every ortholog of a given NRTK had at least
one annotated 5UI, the lengths of those introns were
generally highly correlated (Figure 4a). Given the number of different splice variants for each human gene, we
used three different approaches to calculate the 5UI
length for each gene. We either used the mean length
of splice variants with non-zero 5UI lengths, or picked
the variant with the longest 5UIs, or the one whose
length was closest to its ortholog in either of the rat or
mouse genomes. All three measures resulted in high

correlation overall between 5UI lengths across species
(PCC ranged between 89 and 91% for human-mouse
and 79 and 89% for human-rat comparisons; P < 0.0001
for all; Figure 4a). As expected from evolutionary distances, the highest correlation in 5UI lengths was
observed between rat and mouse orthologs of NRTKs
(PCC = 93%, P = 1.4e-07).
Despite a generally strong correlation in 5UI length
among orthologs, some sets of orthologs had a widespread distribution of length changes. While the total
5UI length of FES changed by less than five nucleotides
in all possible comparisons, rat PTK2 and mouse PTK2
5UIs differed by approximately 63.5 kb (Figure 4b, c).

Figure 4 Comparative genomics of 5’UTR introns within non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Several human NRTKs have multiple splice
isoforms and for these we used three different methods for calculating total 5’UTR intron length: mean of 5’UTR intron length for isoforms with
5’UTR introns (HS_Mean); longest total 5’UTR intron length (HS_Longest); 5’UTR intron length most similar to its ortholog in the genome of
interest (HS_Closest). (a) Heatmap of length correlation (considering genes with non-zero 5’UTR intron lengths) was plotted for the specified
comparisons. As expected from the evolutionary distances between the analyzed species, the highest correlation (93%) was observed between
mouse and rat NRTKs. (b) For each mouse ortholog of a human NRTK, the heatmap depicts the changes in total 5’UTR intron length (color
reflects log10 of total 5’UTR intron length). The histogram above the color scale summarizes the distribution of changes in 5’UTR intron length. A
5’UTR intron may be present in mouse but not in the compared species (light blue) or vice versa (dark blue). Comparisons require an annotated
5’UTR for each ortholog, and were therefore not possible in some cases (white). (c) Same as (b) but substituting ‘rat’ for ‘mouse’. (d) Human
genomic region containing the 5’UTR and first few coding exons (UCSC Genome Browser view). ‘7X Regulatory Potential’, for which higher
scores indicate a greater potential for harboring regulatory sequence elements, was calculated using alignments of seven mammalian genomes
as previously described [44].

The length conservation observed for the FES 5UI is
notably consistent with the high regulatory potential
previously calculated for this 5UI [44] (Figure 4d). More
broadly, introns containing regulatory regions might be
expected to have high length conservation.
When each orthologous group of NRTKs was analyzed, we found variability with respect to presence/
absence of 5UIs in some of these groups. For example,
STYK1 and WEE1 both had 5UIs in humans, but not in
mouse or rat (Figure 4b, c). In the case of human
WEE1, two transcripts were identified in the human
RefSeq collection - while one variant had a 512-nucleotide 5UI, the other variant lacked 5UIs entirely. This
observation suggested the possibility that intron-containing variants might be present in mouse and rat without being represented in the RefSeq transcript
collection. Indeed, we found EST evidence that rat
WEE1 has a splice variant that includes a 5UI [GenBank:CK603528.1]. On the other hand, mouse FRK (Figure 4b) and rat TXK (Figure 4c) had 5UIs while their
orthologs did not. We also observed several NRTKs having 5UIs in two of the species but not in the other one.
For example, both human and mouse orthologs of LCK,
BTK, CSK, TNK1, and YES1 had annotated 5UIs, while
both human and rat orthologs of JAK3 and TEC had
annotated 5UIs (Figure 4b, c). Our results suggest that
NRTK 5UIs are frequently conserved, a conclusion that
would be further strengthened should the apparent
gain/loss events be attributable to incomplete transcript
annotation.
The appearance of 5UIs in most human NRTKs
(Table 1) suggested the potential for a common regulatory mechanism acting via shared motifs. To search for
shared and conserved motifs in these introns, human
NRTK 5UI sequences were located in human-to-mouse
and human-to-rat genome alignments. For 37 out of 42
human NRTKs, more than 10% of the 5UIs could be
aligned to both genomes; only these conserved fragments were used for motif finding. Overrepresented
RNA and DNA motifs were sought in these aligned
sequences using the PhyloGibbs software [45]. In our
search for overrepresented RNA elements, we identified
two complementary motifs, so that the motif in these
5UIs is more likely to be relevant at the DNA level. A
representative DNA motif (Figure 5a) with the highest
log-posterior-probability was compared to the TRANSFAC v11.3 database of known transcription factor binding sites and to a list of conserved human predicted
motifs [46] using the STAMP website [47] (Figure 5b,
c). In both comparisons, the known binding site motif
of the MAZ transcription factor was the most likely
match. However, this does not rule out the possibility of
this motif being the target of another DNA binding
protein.

Comparison between 5’UTR and 5’-proximal coding
introns

5UIs are, by definition, the most 5’-proximal introns in
their transcript. However, not all 5’-proximal introns
need lie within the 5’UTR. We sought to understand
whether the observed functional properties of 5UIs were
shared with 5’-proximal coding region introns (5PCIs).
Given that the median position of the first 5UI was
approximately 130 nucleotides away from the transcription start site regardless of the number of 5UIs [19], we
defined the genes without a 5UI but with a coding
region intron within 150 nucleotides of the transcription
start site as 5PCI-containing genes. This criterion
resulted in 24% of 5UI-lacking genes having a coding
region intron that was deemed to be a 5PCI.
We next used GO annotations to compare the functional properties of 5UI-lacking genes with 5PCIs to
those without 5PCIs. We observed the strongest enrichment of 5PCIs among genes in the following functional
groups: MHC protein complex 1, cytosolic ribosome,
hemoglobin complex, glutathione transferase activity,
and transmembrane transporters (Additional file 3).
This result contrasts the observed enrichment of 5UIs
in regulatory genes. The differences in the enrichment
profiles suggest that distinct functional groups of genes
prefer early introns in either the 5’UTR or the coding
region but not in both.
To assess the possible effect of 5’ proximity on gene
expression, we analyzed microarray data from the
human gene expression atlas for 5UI-lacking genes. We
found that genes with 5PCIs were more highly
expressed on average (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum
test, P = 6e-08; Figure 6). We also observed a 2.3- and
3.7-fold enrichment for genes with 5PCIs among the
most highly expressed top 5% and 1% of genes, respectively (Fisher’s Exact Test, P = 4e-15 and P = 4e-09,
respectively; Figure 6). The correlation between high
expression and 5PCI presence was evident without any
consideration of these introns’ lengths. In contrast, no
expression difference was observed between genes with
or without 5UIs, on average, but short 5UIs were highly
enriched among the most highly expressed genes (Figure
2c). These results suggest that early introns (both 5PCIs
and 5UIs) are associated with the most highly expressed
genes, but that this correlation is limited to short
introns for 5UIs.

Discussion
We compared the expression patterns and functional
annotations of genes with and without 5UIs. We found
that the most highly expressed genes reveal a strong
enrichment for having short 5UIs as opposed to having
either no 5UIs or longer 5UIs. This effect was specific
to genes with the highest expression levels and no

relationship between length and expression level was
observed for genes with intermediate or long introns
(Figure2d). These results are contrary to the energetic
cost model [23], which predicts that genes with no
5UIs will be more highly represented among those
with the highest expression levels. Because expression
reflects both production and degradation rates of
mRNAs, our results suggest that short 5UIs tend to

either enhance transcription or stabilize mature
mRNAs.
The prevalence and the significance of these introndependent mechanisms of transcriptional enhancement
at a genome-wide level are poorly understood in mammalian systems. There are a few examples in mammals
of increased transcription due to the proximity of an
intron to the transcription start site [48-52], and these

can be divided into two major categories with respect to
the mechanism of enhanced transcription. The first
mechanism is at the DNA level and involves the presence of activating transcription regulatory elements in
the intron or the modulation of nucleosome positioning
to make the promoter more accessible [52]. Similarly,
5UIs and other 5’-proximal introns in plants were
shown to enhance gene expression at the transcriptional
level in a position-specific manner [53,54]. The second
mechanism is at the mRNA level, obviously related to
splicing. In vitro studies have linked position-specific
splicing and transcription enhancement mechanistically
by demonstrating a direct interaction between the spliceosomal U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins with transcription elongation factors [55].
Our study thus suggests a distinction between 5UIs
and 5PCIs with respect to their effects on gene expression. A splicing-dependent explanation might be the
most compatible with the overall higher expression of
genes with early coding-region introns compared to
those without such introns. In contrast, even though a
splicing-dependent effect may exist for 5UIs as well, the
most highly expressed genes are highly enriched in having short 5UIs (approximately less than 1 kb in length),
but 5UI presence or absence alone (without considering

Page 12 of 17

5UI length) does not correlate with gene expression.
Therefore, for 5UIs, short intron length seems to be a
more important predictor of a high expression level
than the presence or absence of 5UIs.
Given the inconsistency between our observations and
the energetic cost hypothesis, we suggest two alternative
models of 5UIs’ effect on gene expression. The first
model is that splicing-dependent enhancement in gene
expression is influenced not only by the position of an
intron, but also its size. The second model is that transcriptional regulatory proteins are recruited as a result
of the presence of DNA elements, which in turn
enhance expression level. This process could be
restricted spatially, such that if the distance between the
regulatory element and the transcription start site is
long, then the enhancement should be less pronounced.
Hence the genes with the highest expression levels
might be under selective pressure to keep their introns
short in order to retain their enhancer elements closer
to the transcription start site. In this scenario, one can
further imagine these elements to function in a tissuespecific regulatory mechanism if the recruited factors
are themselves tissue-specific. Such an enhancer, located
in the first intron of the mammalian acetylcholinesterase
gene, was previously found to mediate the tissue-specific
expression of this gene [56]. Another example of tissuespecific gene expression enhancement mediated by a
5UI was reported for the rice gene rubi3 [57].
The pressure to maintain regulatory elements in
introns is also the central idea of the genome design
model, and we tested the applicability of this hypothesis
to 5UIs by analyzing genes with tissue-dependent variability in gene expression. As the most proximal intron
to the transcription start site has been shown to contain
more regulatory elements [33,34], the genome design
model might be expected to apply to 5UIs as well as
coding region introns. Specifically, the genome design
hypothesis predicts that tissue-specific or highly variable
genes contain many regulatory elements in their introns
and hence have longer introns in general [30]. However,
we found no relationship between variability in expression across tissues and the length of the 5UI (Figure 3a,
b). Furthermore, neither 5’UTR presence nor length was
correlated with how widely a gene was expressed. Most
known nucleotide-level regulatory elements are short
(<15 nucleotides), and most known cis-regulatory modules could be contained within even a short (<1 kb) 5UI.
Therefore, 5UIs need not be particularly long to enable
complex and conserved regulation via cis-regulatory elements. Our results support the idea that the genome
design model is not likely to be the most useful guide
for understanding the evolved lengths of 5UIs.
Finally, we considered whether certain classes of genes
preferentially include 5UIs, and whether 5UIs contain

Cenik et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R29
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R29

regulatory elements. We found that genes with regulatory functions are enriched for 5UIs. The non-receptor
tyrosine kinases, which play fundamental roles in all
aspects of cell biology and signal transduction, were the
most strongly enriched gene category. We identified a
conserved DNA motif in the 5UIs of many non-receptor
tyrosine kinases that could function by recruiting transcription factors. This recruitment might lead to tissueor condition-specific regulation of NRTKs. For example,
in the gene encoding Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase), an SP1 transcription factor
binding site was identified within the 5UI [58]. Furthermore, a point mutation in the 5UI region was shown to
be associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, suggesting a functional role for this intron [58].
It is worth considering other forms of selection pressure that might affect 5’UTRs and therefore 5UIs.
Upstream AUGs (uAUGs) tend to decrease translational
efficiency, so that highly expressed genes should tend to
avoid uAUGs in exons. On the other hand, intronic
uAUGs are spliced out before the mature message
encounters the cytoplasmic translation machinery;
hence, they should not have a similar effect. The negative selection pressure against exonic uAUGs that tends
to favor increased intronic sequence content within
5’UTRs [19] should be expected to be most pronounced
for the most highly expressed genes. Our observation
that the most highly expressed genes are enriched in
having short 5UIs runs contrary to this expectation.
Furthermore, shorter 5UIs did not imply shorter 5’UTR
exon lengths, which might complicate our expectation
for uAUG effects. Thus, models based solely on uAUGbased selection cannot explain the overrepresentation of
short 5UIs among the most highly expressed genes.
Alternative splicing has emerged as a fundamental
mechanism of regulation and expansion of the proteome, with nearly 95% of all genes thought to be alternatively spliced in mammals [13-15]. Tissue-dependent
alternative splicing within 5’UTRs is common and can
be functionally important. For example, aberrant splicing of 5’UTRs of BRCA1 and ERb was recently implicated in carcinogenesis [59]. Whether these different
splice variants play any regulatory role is unknown in all
but a few cases. A plausible mechanism for the potential
impact of alternative splicing in 5’UTRs is an effect on
translation efficiency through differential inclusion of
uAUGs.
The functional importance of alternative splicing in
5’UTRs is exemplified by human NOD2, which is associated with Crohn’s disease. Only a subset of NOD2’s
multiple splice variants include the uAUGs in the
mature mRNA, and these have decreased translation
efficiency [60]. Alternative splicing of 5’UTRs can also
affect mRNA secondary structure. In the ETS domain

Page 13 of 17

transcription factor ELK1, for example, a facultative secondary structure modulates translation initiation [61].
Yet another connection between splicing and translation
is the deposition of the exon junction complex following
splicing, which induces translation through an interaction with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling pathway [62]. The position or the sequence
composition of the intron could potentially affect this
splicing-dependent enhancement of translation efficiency
by the mTOR pathway. These mechanisms of additional
regulation by alternative splicing of 5UIs may underlie
our observation that these introns are enriched in regulatory genes. Given that regulatory genes must themselves be precisely governed, additional means of
regulation may allow for greater control, flexibility or
complexity. Future work will need to address the full
genome-wide functional implications and importance of
alternative splicing of 5UIs.

Conclusions
Our results highlight the functional importance of
5’UTR introns. Existing models predicting selective
effects, such as avoidance of uAUGs, minimization of
transcriptional cost, or accumulation of regulatory elements, do not suffice to explain results from our genome-scale analysis of 5UIs. Given 5UI enrichment and
depletion in specific functional categories of genes, and
the potential ability of 5UIs to enhance gene expression,
a complex interplay of multiple selective forces appears
to have influenced the evolution of this distinct class of
introns.
Materials and methods
A collection of genes with 5’UTR introns

NCBI’s human Reference Gene Collection (RefSeq) [63]
and the associated annotation table were downloaded
from the UCSC genome browser [64], genome assembly
of May 2004. The annotation table was parsed using the
Galaxy website [65] (as of June 2007) to obtain 5UI
coordinates. Specifically, we extracted all introns annotated to lie between two 5’UTR exons. Then we
removed all the cases where another splice variant was
present in the RefSeq collection such that any sequence
within the intron was part of the coding region. Hence,
all the introns in our final dataset were strictly present
in the 5’UTR according to the annotation of RefSeq
genes. 5’UTR exon coordinates were similarly retrieved
as of June 2007. Recent studies suggest that nearly all
human genes are alternatively spliced [13-15]. However,
it is not clear what fraction of these events have biological significance as opposed to reflecting random noise
associated with the less than perfect fidelity of the splicing machinery. Only when multiple independent
sources of evidence support tissue-dependent alternative

Cenik et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R29
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R29

splicing can we be confident that these variants have
real biological significance. Therefore, we used RefSeq
transcripts, which are (unlike ESTs) manually curated
and supported by multiple sources of evidence. For the
comparisons between total lengths of 5UIs and the rest
of the introns, we extracted coordinates of all non5’UTR introns from the RefSeq annotation table (as of
May 2009). A complete list of the genomic coordinates
of 5UIs examined in this study is available as Additional
file 1.
Microarray data and analysis

The microarray data were downloaded from Gene
Expression Atlas, which included expression data from
79 different tissues in humans [66]. We used the
gcRMA-normalized data from the Affymetrix U133a
and GNF1H arrays. Synergizer [42] was used to associate RefSeq genes with probe sets on the U133a array
and custom Perl v5.8.8 scripts were used to parse the
GNF1H annotation table (available on the Gene Expression Atlas website). The resulting correspondences of
RefSeq IDs to probe sets on the GNF1H and U133a
microarrays were merged to obtain a final mapping.
Where multiple probe sets corresponded to a single
RefSeq ID, the arithmetic mean of the expression values
of all the probes was used to obtain a representative
expression level for that RefSeq ID in each tissue. A single region of the genome can correspond to more than
one RefSeq ID due to alternative splice variants and/or
alternative promoters, and there were cases of a single
probe set corresponding to multiple RefSeq IDs. To
avoid overweighting such regions, we removed RefSeq
IDs such that there were no duplicates. The representative RefSeq ID from each such probe set was chosen
uniformly at random. For each gene with a 5UI, we calculated the mean expression level across all tissues and
divided the genes into three groups with respect to total
5’UTR intronic length: short, 0 to 25%; intermediate, 25
to 75%; long, 75 to 100% in length. All expression analysis was performed using the R software package v2.6.0.
In addition, the ‘hexbin’ [67] and ‘zoo’ [68] packages for
the R platform were used.
Functional enrichment of Gene Ontology categories

GoSTAT [41] and FuncAssociate [40] were used for
functional trend analysis. We restricted the space of
genes to all genes in the RefSeq collection because we
used annotations in this collection to determine the set
of genes with 5UIs. We used the RefSeq IDs as input
for analysis with both programs. FuncAssociate uses
Synergizer [42] to resolve the synonyms using Ensembl
as the authority. To quantify the effect size, all the statistically significant GO categories that are enriched in
the genes with introns are sorted according to their

Page 14 of 17

log 10 odds ratio. All reported log odds ratios were
obtained from FuncAssociate. Similar results were
obtained using GoSTAT (data not shown).
Comparative genomic analysis of non-receptor tyrosine
kinases

To study the evolution of 5UI presence and length
among NRTKs, we first identified orthologs of human
NRTKs in the mouse and rat genomes. We used NCBI’s
Homologene Release 64 [69] (as of September 2009) to
identify ‘true’ orthologous genes. Based on a recent evaluation of different approaches, Homologene showed
greater specificity than other comparable orthology
sources for the purposes of detailed phylogenetic and
functional analysis [70]. We extracted the corresponding
RefSeq IDs for each of the human NRTKs, and their
mouse and rat orthologs. Then, we downloaded the
RefSeq annotation tables for current genome builds
(hg19, mm9, and rn4; as of September 2009) and used
these annotations to determine 5UI lengths. All statistical analyses were performed using R software package
v2.6.0. The raw data used in this analysis of human
NRTKs are provided in Additional file 2.
Motif discovery

The coordinates for the non-receptor tyrosine kinase
genes that harbor introns were converted to human
genome build hg18 using the LiftOver utility tool
obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser website [71].
If there were known alternative splice variants in the
RefSeq database, the longest intron was used for motif
discovery purposes. Multiple alignment blocks for the
human, mouse, and rat genomes (builds hg18, mm8,
and rn4, respectively) were extracted from the 17-way
multiZ alignment at the UCSC Genome Browser. These
alignment blocks were merged using the Stitch MAF
blocks utility on the Galaxy website [65] to obtain a
final alignment of the human non-receptor tyrosine
kinases to the mouse and rat orthologs. We obtained
alignments that covered more than 10% of the length of
the 5UIs for 37 human NRTKs, and excluded the other
five introns from the subsequent motif discovery steps.
PhyloGibbs v1.2 was used in motif finding [45,72].
Different phylogenetic trees were tested but they did not
significantly affect the results (not shown); therefore, all
the results we report here were generated using the
(hg18:0.5,(mm8:0.8, rn4:0.9):0.6) phylogeny specified in
Newick tree format. Both RNA and DNA motifs (that is,
forward strand only and both strands, respectively) were
searched and the intronic sequences were used to define
the background nucleotide distribution of the region to
account for differences in nucleotide composition of
5UIs. The resulting motifs were represented by positionspecific scoring matrices. The STAMP [47] web site was

Cenik et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R29
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R29

used to find similar motifs in the TRANSFAC v11.3
database as well as in a comparative genomics study in
humans [46]. Default parameters were used in all
comparisons.
Analysis of the total exonic/intronic length and 5PCIs

To determine the lengths and positions of various genomic features, we first compiled a list of all RefSeq IDs.
A single ID can correspond to multiple transcripts
either that are expressed from the same or different
regions in the genome. Such IDs can be associated with
different transcript structures, and are therefore
removed from further analysis. RefSeq IDs corresponding to genes in the hypervariable hla-locus were similarly represented multiple times in the RefSeq collection.
In these cases, only the version in the reference genome
was retained for further analysis.
After these initial filters, we calculated total lengths of
5UIs, 5’UTR exons, and other introns for each remaining
RefSeq transcript. The position of the first coding intron
was determined using the coordinates of all introns from
the RefSeq annotation table that was retrieved as of May
2009. There were multiple identifiers for different splice
variants that were transcribed from the same genomic
location in the RefSeq collection. To avoid any systematic
biases, we compared three different approaches in selecting RefSeq transcripts for further analysis. First, we kept
all transcripts regardless of how many were transcribed
from a given loci. Second, we determined equivalence
classes of RefSeq transcripts, such that two IDs were in
the same set if their transcription intervals (from start to
stop position) overlapped by more than 20 base pairs.
Then, we randomly removed RefSeqs transcripts such
that only a single representative transcript remained for
each equivalence class. Third, exact duplicates with
respect to the 5’UTR were removed. Specifically, if two
or more RefSeq IDs had the exact same 5’UTR, a single
identifier was selected as a representative for that particular region. Splice variants that differ in their 5’UTR were
not removed because these provide additional information about the lengths of 5’UTR introns and exons. All
three methods yielded similar results and led to identical
conclusions. Therefore, only one representative method
is shown in the figures. The third method conveys the
most information when discussing total 5UI lengths and
hence was used in Figure 1a. By contrast, considering
one representative from each transcriptional unit is more
relevant when analyzing the correlation between two
genomic features. Hence, the second method was used
for Figures 1c, d.
For the specific GO categories used in our analysis, all
the genes in a given category were retrieved from the
human GOA database [73]. The corresponding RefSeq
identifiers were determined using the Synergizer

Page 15 of 17

software [42]. Total exonic length and intronic length
were calculated for all these genes as described above.
