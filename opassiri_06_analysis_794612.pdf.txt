Abstract
Background: Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1) β-glucosidases have been implicated in physiologically
important processes in plants, such as response to biotic and abiotic stresses, defense against herbivores,
activation of phytohormones, lignification, and cell wall remodeling. Plant GH1 β-glucosidases are encoded
by a multigene family, so we predicted the structures of the genes and the properties of their protein
products, and characterized their phylogenetic relationship to other plant GH1 members, their expression
and the activity of one of them, to begin to decipher their roles in rice.
Results: Forty GH1 genes could be identified in rice databases, including 2 possible endophyte genes, 2
likely pseudogenes, 2 gene fragments, and 34 apparently competent rice glycosidase genes. Phylogenetic
analysis revealed that GH1 members with closely related sequences have similar gene structures and are
often clustered together on the same chromosome. Most of the genes appear to have been derived from
duplications that occurred after the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana lineages from their common
ancestor, and the two plants share only 8 common gene lineages. At least 31 GH1 genes are expressed in
a range of organs and stages of rice, based on the cDNA and EST sequences in public databases. The cDNA
of the Os4bglu12 gene, which encodes a protein identical at 40 of 44 amino acid residues with the Nterminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by
RT-PCR from rice seedlings. A thioredoxin-Os4bglu12 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli
efficiently hydrolyzed β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of 3–6 glucose residues and laminaribiose.
Conclusion: Careful analysis of the database sequences produced more reliable rice GH1 gene structure
and protein product predictions. Since most of these genes diverged after the divergence of the ancestors
of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, only a few of their functions could be implied from those of GH1 enzymes
from Arabidopsis and other dicots. This implies that analysis of GH1 enzymes in monocots is necessary to
understand their function in the major grain crops. To begin this analysis, Os4bglu12 β-glucosidase was
characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism.

Background

β-glucosidases (3.2.1.21) are glycosyl hydrolases that
hydrolyze the β-O-glycosidic bond at the anomeric carbon of a glucose moiety at the nonreducing end of a carbohydrate or glycoside molecule. These enzymes are
found essentially in all living organisms and have been
implicated in a diversity of roles, such as biomass conversion in microorganisms [1] and activation of defense
compounds [2,3], phytohormones [4,5], lignin precursors [6], aromatic volatiles [7], and metabolic intermediates by releasing glucose blocking groups from the
inactive glucosides in plants [8]. To achieve specificity for
these various functions, β-glucosidases must bind to a
wide variety of aglycones, in addition to the glucose of the
substrate.
The β-glucosidases that have been characterized to date
fall predominantly in glycosyl hydrolase families 1 and 3
[9], with family 1 enzymes being more numerous in
plants. Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1) contains a
wide range of β-glycosidases, including β-galactosidases,
β-mannosidases, phospho-β-galactosidases, phospho-βglucosidases, and thioglucosidases, in addition to β-glucosidases. The plant enzymes in this family generally fall
in a closely related subfamily, but, despite their high
sequence similarity, display a wide range of activities.
Besides β-glucosidases with diverse specificities, these
plant enzymes include thio-β-glucosidases or myrosinases, β-mannosidases, disaccharidases, such as primeverosidase
and
furcatin
hydrolase,
and
hydroxyisourate hydrolase, which hydrolyzes an internal
bond in a purine ring, rather than a glycosidic linkage
[7,9-11]. In addition, many enzymes in this group are
capable of releasing multiple kinds of sugars from aglycones, such as isoflavonoid β-glucosidases, which can
release the disaccharide acuminose and malonyl glucose,
in addition to glucose itself, from isoflavonoids [12,13].
Other β-glucosidases in this subfamily may have high specificity for glucosides or glucosides and fucosides, or may
hydrolyze other glycosides, such as β-galactosides, β-mannosides, and β-xylosides, as well. Primeverosidase has
high specificity for primeverosides, with no hydrolysis of
glucosides [7], while furcatin hydrolase can hydrolyze glucosides as well as disaccharide glycosides [10]. Clearly,
plant family 1 glycosyl hydrolases show a range of sugar
specificities.
Plant family 1 glycosyl hydrolases tend to show high specificity for their aglycones, though many hydrolyze synthetic, nonphysiological substrates, like p-nitrophenol
(pNP)-β-glycosides [14]. The aglycones span a wide range
of structures, including sugars [15-17], hydroxaminic
acids [18], isoflavonoids [12,13], rotenoids [19], alkaloids [20,21] hydroxyquinones [3], cyanogenic nitriles
[2], etc. It is the specificity for these aglycones which is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/33

thought to specify the function of most of these enzymes
[14]. Since many β-glucosidases function in plants, it is
important that these enzymes specifically hydrolyze their
own substrates and not other substrates with which they
may come into contact. It seems evident that the substrate
specificity, localization of the enzymes with respect to
potential substrates, and the activities of the substrates
and hydrolysis products will determine the roles of these
enzymes.
Xu et al. [22] described 47 GH1 genes in the Arabidopsis
genome, including 7 apparent thioglucosidases, and one
enzyme that had high β-mannosidase activity, in agreement with the prediction from its similarity to tomato βmannosidase. With the completion of high quality drafts
of the rice genome, a thorough analysis of GH1 can be
conducted in rice. To date, only a few rice β-glucosidase
isozymes have been functionally characterized, with the
activities described being hydrolysis of gibberellin glucosides, pyridoxine glucosides and oligosaccharides
[16,17,23,24].
To assess the functions of GH1 in rice, genes homologous
to GH1 β-glucosidase genes have been identified from the
rice genome, and their structures, predicted protein products and evidence of expression evaluated. In addition, we
have cloned a β-glucosidase from germinating rice based
on genomic data, and assessed its biochemical properties
after expression in E. coli.

Results and discussion

Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 β-glucosidase family
The completion of the Oryza sativa L. spp. japonica Rice
Genome Project and the complementary indica rice (O.
sativa L. spp. indica) genome project by the Beijing
Genomic Institute (BGI) has allowed genome-wide analysis of gene families in this important crop [25,26]. The
sequence and mapping information provided to the public databases by these projects enabled us to identify the
genes for glycosyl hydrolase family 1 members (putative
β-glucosidases) in rice, determine their gene structures
and genomic organization, and model their protein products and phylogenetic relationships. In this study, we used
the DNA sequences of japonica rice in the Monsanto Rice
Genome Sequencing Project, the Torrey Mesa Research
Institute and GenBank at NCBI and the indica rice
sequences of the BGI as the starting point to examine the
sequences homologous to GH1 members by manual
annotation. By examination of the gene structures and
prediction based on the knowledge of other plant GH1
genes, we rectified any errors in gene structures from the
automatic annotation by the Rice Genome Sequencing
Project contigs. Thereafter, the GH1 members of indica
rice were compared with those of japonica rice to identify
which genes are orthologues (see Table 1). Finally, all con-

tig sequences were searched against the completed
sequences of the 12 rice chromosomes in GenBank to
map each contig position on the chromosomes and identify the new GH1 members that were not present in the
other databases. A new systematic code for the genes
based on their chromosome location was devised with the
chromosome number followed by a bglu number counting from the top of chromosome 1 through the bottom of
chromosome 12 (Table 1). To avoid confusion, previously published synonyms for all family members are
provided in Table 1. The retrieved gene sequences were
searched against the dbEST and japonica rice full-length
cDNA databases to determine the mRNA expression patterns of each gene in rice.
Forty β-glucosidase genes, including 34 full-length genes,
2 pseudogenes, 2 gene fragments, and 2 intronless genes,
were identified, as listed in Table 1. Thirty-six out of 40
genes are found in both japonica and indica rice with 98–
100% sequence identity. The Os11bglu35 gene was
present only in japonica rice sequences, while Os11bglu37,
Osbglu39 and Osbglu40 were only found in indica rice. The
thirty-eight mapped GH1 genes are distributed over all
chromosomes, except chromosome 2 (Table 1). The
Osbglu39 and Osbglu40 sequences have not been mapped
to any chromosome, and it is possible they represent contamination of endophytic genes remaining in the indica
genome draft. Twenty-two out of 40 gene sequences are
derived from the automated annotation in the public
databases and 18 genes are derived from manual annotation. We corrected 4 of 22 automated annotation contigs
that had misassigned one or more intron-exon boundaries. Os11bglu35 and Os11bglu37 appear to be pseudogenes, since they have premature stop codons and cannot
produce full-length proteins.
The size of rice GH1 is not unexpected, since a search of
the Arabidopsis thaliana genome identified 47 glycosyl
hydrolase family 1 homologues, including 8 probable
pseudogenes and 3 intronless genes, which are distributed
throughout all five chromosomes [22]. The slightly larger
size of the family in Arabidopsis may be due to the presence
of myrosinases, which are not found in rice, and a larger
number of pseudogenes. The large size of both rice and
Arabidopsis GH1 may reflect different substrate specificity
and expression patterns in rice tissues and/or in response
to environmental conditions among the GH1 members.
The presence of many GH1 genes in rice suggests they may
hydrolyze an array of possible substrates, depending on
their substrate specificity and localization with respect to
the substrates. Although a number of glycosides that
could serve as potential substrates for rice GH 1 β-glucosidases have been purified from rice tissues, there have been
few reports about the hydrolysis of these substrates by the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/33

enzymes. The major glycosides found in various tissues of
rice include glycosylsterols, flavonoid glucosides, hormone glucosides, a vitamin glucoside, and pantonic acid
glucoside. Glycosylsterols found in rice are glycosyl-sitosterol, -campesterol and -stigmasterol in rice bran [27]
and β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucoside in rice hulls [28]. The
major flavonoid glucosides present in rice include 1)
anthocyanins, such as cyanidin-O-β-D-glucoside and peonidin-O-β-D-glucoside, in black rice [29,30]; 2) tricin-Oglucoside in rice hulls, bran, leaf and stem [28,31]; and 3)
hydroxycinnamate sucrose esters, such as 6'-O-feruloylsucrose and 6'-O-sinapoylsucrose in germinated brown rice
[32]. Hormone glucosides found in rice include gibberellin glucosides in ungerminated seeds and anther [23,33],
salicylic glucoside [34] and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-glucoside [35]. Pyridoxine-β-D-glucoside was found in rice
bran, callus and seedling [36-38]. Another glycoside,
namely R(-) pantoyllactone-β-D-glucoside, was found in
the shoots but not the roots of rice seedlings [39].
Many compounds (including glycosides) have been
found in rice tissues in response to environmental stresses
and in transgenic rice plants. Recently, it was found that
there is a high accumulation of IAA-glucoside in tryptophan-overproducing transgenic rice [35] and of salicylic
glucoside in rice overproducing NH1, a key regulator of
salicylic acid mediated systematic acquired resistance, in
transgenic rice [34]. The level of pyridoxine glucoside was
reported to be increased by the application of pyridoxine
to rice callus and germinating seeds [37,38]. Markham et
al. [40] reported that exposing UV-tolerant rice to high
UV-B levels increased the levels of flavone glucosides.
These results may indicate that the presence of high
amounts of some metabolic compounds is corrected by
converting them to the glucoside-conjugated forms. It still
needs to be shown whether or not these compounds are
later reactivated by β-glucosidases.
Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
The open reading frames (ORFs) of thirty-seven genederived cDNAs (excluding Os11bglu36, Osbglu39 and
Osbglu40, which are more closely related to bacterial GH1
genes) showed a high level of shared deduced amino acid
sequence identity to each other and other known plant βglucosidase sequences. All deduced β-glucosidase protein
sequences contain the putative catalytic acid/base and
nucleophilic glutamate residues, except Os4bglu14 and
Os9bglu33, in which the acid/base glutamate is replaced
with glutamine, as seen in thioglucosidases. The catalytic
acid/base and nucleophile consensus sequences are: W-XT/I-F/L/I/V/S/M-N/A/L/I/D/G-E/Q-P/I/Q and V/I/L-X-EN-G, respectively, with relative frequencies of amino acids
at each position shown in Figure 1. These sequences are
similar to the consensus sequences previously derived
from known GH1 β-glucosidase sequences [41,42]. The

Table 1: Summary of identified genes homologous to glycosyl hydrolase family 1 glucosidase (Continued)

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:33

presence of the appropriate active site glutamic acids in
the consensus sequences motifs suggests that all the genes
identified in the rice genome database, except Os4bglu14
and Os9bglu33, at least have the potential to produce catalytically active β-glucosidases. β-glucosidases with Q
instead of E at the acid/base position have been shown to
be effective transferases in the presence of a good leaving
group aglycone and a nucleophilic acceptor [43], therefore even Os4bglu14 and Os9bglu33 might be active if
such glucosyl transfer reactions are catalyzed in vivo. Additionally, as seen in multiple sequence alignment (Additional Files 1, 2, 3), the amino acids identified by Czjzek
et al. [41] as critical for glucose binding (Q38, H142,
E191, E406, E464 and W465 in maize Bglu1) are generally well conserved in these predicted sequences. Only the
predicted Os1bglu5 has Q instead of H142 in maize,
whereas maize W465 is replaced by F in Os8bglu28,
Os9bglu32 and Os9bglu33, Y in Os1bglu5 and
Os9bglu31, L in Os1bglu2, Os1bglu3, Os5bglu21,
Os5bglu22 and Os5bglu23, M in Os5bglu19, I in
Os5bglu20 and S in Osbglu39. The residues that line the
active site cleft and interact with the substrate aglycone of
maize [41] are indeed quite variable in the predicted rice
β-glucosidases, as would be expected for β-glucosidases
with different substrate specificities.
Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of 36 members including 34 full-length genes and 2
pseudogenes, but not including the intronless bacterialike enzyme genes Osbglu39 and Osbglu40, and gene
fragments, Os4bglu15 and Os4bglu17, showed that the
sequences share a common evolutionary origin (Figure
2). Interestingly, many members that contain closely
related sequences and cluster together are located on the
same chromosome, such as the members in chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11, indicating localized (intrachromosomal) duplication events. Some of the closely related
GH1 members of Arabidopsis also cluster on the same
chromosome [22]. Comparison between rice and Arabidopsis GH1 members revealed that 7 clearly distinct clusters of plant-like GH1 genes (marked 1 to 7 in Figure 2)
contain both Arabidopsis and rice genes that are clearly
more closely related to each other than to other GH1
genes within their own species. In addition, the Arabidopsis SFR2 gene (not shown) forms another interspecies
cluster with its rice homologue, Os11bglu36, which is
marked (8) in Figure 2. Thus, it appears the ancestor of
rice and Arabidopsis had at least 8 GH1 genes. However,
22 out of 40 Arabidopsis genes group in two large clusters
without rice gene members (marked AtI and AtII in Figure
2), which incorporate several of the subfamilies defined
by Xu et al. [22], and appear to have diverged before the
rice and Arabidopsis. These include the myrosinases,
which are not known to occur in rice, but also many
apparent β-glucosidases. Similarly, some rice genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/33

appear to have diverged from their cluster of Arabidopsis
and rice genes before the other Arabidopsis and rice genes
diverged. These include the Os3bglu7 and Os3bglu8
genes, which diverged from the lineage containing the
Arabidopsis β-mannosidase genes before those genes
diverged from Os1bglu1 and Os7bglu26. This suggests
that the closest homologue of Os3bglu7 and Os3bglu8,
which represent the most highly expressed GH1 genes in
rice based on EST analysis, was lost from Arabidopsis.
Thus, genes found in the common ancestor, including two
that were duplicated into most of the Arabidopsis GH1
repertoire, appear to have been lost in the other plant's
lineage. However, it is possible that rapid evolution of
these genes caused them to be misplaced by the phylogenetic analysis, so care must be taken in interpreting these
analyses. This analysis suggests that the common ancestor
of monocots and dicots had at least 11–13 GH1 genes, 8
of which are represented by common lineages in modern
rice and Arabidopsis.
Taken together, the great divergence of rice and Arabidopsis
genes after the divergence of the species and the loss of
important lineages from either rice or Arabidopsis suggest
that much of the functional divergence of GH1 may have
occurred after the monocot-dicot divergence. Therefore, it
may be difficult to extrapolate functions found in Arabidopsis to those in rice and vice-versa, except in a few cases
(such as AtBGLU41 and Os6bglu25, which have not duplicated since the divergence of the species).
Phylogenetic analysis of rice GH1 members with other
plant enzymes also led to several interesting observations
(Figure 3). Some rice and Arabidopsis members that are
clustered in the same groups were found to be closely
related to β-glucosidases from other plants. For example,
Os4bglu14, Os4bglu16 and Os4bglu18, which cluster
with Arabidopsis BGLU45, 46 and 47, are grouped with
Pinus contorta coniferin/syringin β-glucosidase (PC
AAC69619) [6], suggesting that they may be involved in
lignification. In fact, recombinantly expressed Arabidopsis
BGLU45 and BGLU46 have recently been shown to
hydrolyze lignin precursors [44]. Although Arabidopsis
BGLU11 and rice enzymes (Os1bglu2, Os1bglu3,
Os1bglu5, and Os5bglu19 through Os5bglu23) have
sequences closely related to Glycine max hydroxyisourate
hydrolase (GM AAL92115) [11] and cluster into the same
large group, they do not have HENG catalytic nucleophile
motif found in hydroxyisourate hydrolase, whereas the
somewhat more distantly related Os9bglu31, Os9bglu32,
and Os9bglu33 do. However, the rice enzymes generally
still contain the conserved glucose binding residues lost
from the G. max hydroxyisourate hydrolase, so they may
still act as glycosyl hydrolases, rather than as other kinds
of hydrolases.

Os1bglu1, Os3bglu7, Os3bglu8, Os7bglu26 and
Os12bglu38 β-glucosidases clearly grouped with barley
BGQ60 β-glucosidase/β-mannosidase [15,45]. Kinetic
analysis showed that the hydrolytic activity of Os3bglu7
(rice BGlu1 in Opassiri et al. [24]) toward β-linked glucose
oligosaccharides is similar to that of the barley enzyme
[17]. Barley BGQ60 also shares high sequence identity
and similar gene organization with Arabidopsis BGLU44
and tomato β-mannosidase. Recombinant AtBGLU44
protein shows a preference for β-mannoside and β-mannan oligosaccharides [22], as does barley BGQ60 [46,47],
while Os3bglu7 prefers glucoside 10-fold over mannoside
[17]. Thus, within this cluster of closely related genes,
both exo-β-glucanase and β-mannosidase (exo-β-mannanase) activities are found.
Several GH1 enzymes associated with defense do not have
clear orthologues in either rice or Arabidopsis (Figure 3 and

[22]). No rice GH1 members cluster with the monocot
chloroplast targeted enzymes, such as maize Bglu1 and
sorghum dhurrinase, while the 2 groups cluster loosely
with the dicot defense enzymes, such as white clover and
cassava linamarinases. The chromosome 4 cluster of
Os4bglu9-12 and Os6bglu24 form one group embedded
within the dicot defense enzymes, while Os8bglu27,
Os8bglu28, Os9bglu29, Os9bglu30, Os11bglu35, and
Os11bglu37 form another cluster within this group. The
association of these genes with the defense enzymes was
seen in both distance-based and sequence-based phylogenetic analysis, but they were not strongly supported by
bootstrap analysis in either case. As noted by Henrissat
and Davies [48], it is not generally possible to assign glycosyl hydrolase function based on sequence similarity
scores alone, and the high divergence between the rice and
defense-related β-glucosidases makes it unclear which, if
any, play a role in defense.

There is only low sequence similarity between Os11bglu36
and the other rice GH1 members, suggesting that it
diverged from the other plant enzyme genes before plants
evolved. Os11bglu36 is most similar to the Arabidopsis
SFR2 β-glucosidase-like gene, AC: AJ491323 [49]. The
SFR2 gene is also found in other plant species, such as
maize, wheat, Glycine max, Lycopersicon esculentum, Pinus
taeda, sorghum, and barley.
Gene organization
Gene structural analysis of the β-glucosidases showed
intron-exon boundaries and intron numbers are highly
conserved among rice and other plant β-glucosidase
genes. Intron sizes in these genes, however, are highly variable. In most cases, very long introns contained retrotransposon-like sequences, while the orthologous short
introns did not. Five patterns of gene structures are distinguished by the number of exons and introns, which are
13, 12, 11, or 9 exons, and intronless (Figure 4). However
in each case, existent introns maintained the same splice
sites. It was found that Arabidopsis also has several GH1
gene organization patterns, though some are different
from rice [22]. Arabidopsis GH1 genes exhibit 10 distinct
exon-intron organization patterns and 3 members exhibit
a new intron that is not found in rice and is inserted into
exon 13 to yield two novel exons. Only gene structure patterns 1, 3 and 5 of rice GH1 are found in Arabidopsis. Similar to Arabidopsis, the most common gene pattern, found
in 22 rice genes, is pattern 1, in which there are 13 exons
separated by 12 introns (Table 1). The results from
deduced amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) showed that the sequences in
intron-exon pattern groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 are usually more
closely related to each other within their groups than to
the other groups.

Figure 4 gene structure patterns for putative rice GH1 βglucosidase genes
Predicted
Predicted gene structure patterns for putative rice GH1 βglucosidase genes. Exons are shown as boxes with corresponding exons having the same pattern. Introns, represented as simple lines, are drawn in proportion to their
length. Note that 5 gene organization patterns can be seen in
rice genes, those with 13, 12, 11, or 9 exons and intronless
patterns, with the splice sites conserved in each group and
between groups for common exons and introns.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/33

The genes with 13 exons (group 1) are more divergent,
indicating this pattern is probably the ancestral gene
organization. Those genes with 11 exons clustered
together in one group with barley BGQ60, while those
with 9 and 12 exons clustered in separate groups. This
phylogeny is consistent with an ancestral plant β-glucosidase having 13 exons and 12 introns, with losses of
introns in groups 2, 3 and 4. To generate this phylogeny
by gain of introns would require intron insertion at the
exact same splice site position multiple times to generate
the divergent genes with the 13 exon pattern. For a similar
reason, though the sequence analysis shown in Figure 2
suggests Os9bglu29 diverged from Os9bglu30 before it
diverged from the ancestor gene of Os11bglu35 and
Os11bglu37, the loss of the same introns (6, 7, 8 and 9) in
Os9bglu29 and Os9bglu30, suggests they are more recently
diverged. Since Os11bglu35 also lacks intron 9, it may
have diverged more recently than Os11bglu37 as well,
though it is possible this was an independent intron loss.
Thus, it appears that rapid accumulation of changes in
Os9bglu29 and Os9bglu30 caused their sequences to differ
more than would be expected from the recent divergence
indicated by their shared gene structures.
The two intronless genes found in the BGI database may
be contamination left from endophytes which has not
been removed from the indica database, since originally
there were 5 other intronless GH1 genes that were in this
database. Support for this hypothesis is provided by their
sequences, since Osbglu39 shows 58% identity with
Lactobacillis β-glucosidase, and Osbglu40 has 70% identity with bacterial proteins, while they only share 28–30%
identity with the other rice proteins. Alternatively, they
may have been gene transcripts that were captured by retrotransposons and reincorporated into the rice genome,
or may have been obtained by lateral gene transfer from a
bacteria. The intron-exon boundaries of the Os11bglu36
gene do not correspond to those of other rice β-glucosidase genes, indicating it is from a separate lineage, though
also of plant origin.
Expression of rice β-glucosidase genes
In order to begin to analyze the tissue specific expression
of the β-glucosidase genes in rice, a search for ESTs corresponding to each of the 40 different predicted genes was
performed in dbEST and the full-length cDNA clones of
japonica rice databases [50]. As shown in Table 1, an initial
homology search with β-glucosidase sequences identified
823 ESTs and 55 "full" cDNAs, which are derived from 31
GH1 genes. The Os3bglu7 is most highly represented in
the dbEST database, with 326 ESTs. Os3bglu8 has the second highest abundance of ESTs with 77 ESTs. Other GH1
genes with a relatively large numbers of ESTs are
Os4bglu12, Os5bglu22, Os7bglu 26, Os9bglu30, Os9bglu31,
and Os9bglu32 (Table 1). However, the high abundance of

Page 10 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:33

ESTs for some rice genes might not reflect the relative
expression levels in particular tissues, because of bias in
selecting plant parts and developmental stages for production of EST cDNA libraries [22]. It should be noted that
Os4bglu14 and Os9bglu33, which lack the catalytic acid/
base, both have transcripts in the database, which indicates that they are transcriptionally active although the
protein product may not have hydrolase activity. Several
genes are not represented in the EST/full-length cDNA
databases (i.e., the full-length genes: Os5bglu21,
Os5bglu23, and Os6bglu24; pseudogenes: Os11bglu35 and
Os11bglu37, gene fragments: Os4bglu15 and Os4bglu17;
and intronless genes: Osbglu39 and Osbglu40). So,
whether and where the full-length gene members are
expressed remains unclear. It is possible that the expression levels of these genes are very low, or their expression
may be induced by particular environmental conditions.
The source libraries for rice GH1 gene ESTs include callus,
seedling (shoot and root), immature plant parts (stem,
root, leaf), mature plant (leaf), panicle at flowering and
ripening stage, and immature seeds. Some rice β-glucosidase genes have ESTs from stressed plant tissue libraries,
such as salt (i.e. Os3bglu7, Os4bglu12), drought (i.e.
Os1bglu2, Os1bglu4, Os4bglu12), cold (i.e. Os3bglu6,
Os3bglu7), heat (i.e. Os3bglu7) and fungus infection (i.e.
Os1bglu2, Os1bglu3, Os1bglu4) (see Table 1). In addition,
some genes (i. e. Os1bglu1, Os1bglu3, Os3bglu7, Os3bglu8)
are also expressed in transgenic rice, such as in the leaf of
rice overexpressing ABA-responsive element binding transcription factor 3 (TF3). These EST/cDNA sequences were
used to identify the 3'UTR sequence for each gene and it
was found that all cDNAs contain unique 3'UTR
sequences, which may therefore be used as unique probes
for each gene. The occurrence of the ESTs/cDNAs of β-glucosidase genes in tissues may correlate with growth and
development. As mentioned by Xu et al. [22], the members of a given subfamily may have the same biochemical
function and may be expressed in different cells, tissues,
or organs and may be expressed in response to different
environmental conditions and stresses. However, the
multiple forms of rice β-glucosidases may also represent
functional redundancy and be expressed in the same tissues.
One question of interest was why the chloroplast β-glucosidases seemed most predominant in maize, oat, sorghum and wheat, while such genes have lower expression
in rice. A comparison of ESTs from several grain species
showed that the chloroplast β-glucosidases of other cereals have the most EST hits of GH1 genes, while in rice and
barley, the rice BGlu1/barley BGQ60-like genes were
more predominant (Additional File 4). However, since
the genome and transcriptome analysis of these grasses is
not completed, some bias may have been introduced in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/33

the selection of the tissues studied. Given the large
number of ESTs in maize and rice, it seems likely to be a
reasonable comparison, despite these limitations. If so, it
may be that the defense function of the chloroplast isozymes in maize and other grasses, has been replaced by
other defenses or by the abundance of Os3bglu7, which
might be found in a separate compartment from defensive
substrates, as well. Though Os3bglu7 is thought to function in hydrolysis of oligosaccharides released from the
cell wall [24], it might be possible for it to fulfill more
than one role. Recently, barley β-glucosidase, which is
thought to help in hydrolysis of cell wall oligosaccharides
during germination, has been found to hydrolyze cyanogenic glycosides from barley leaves [51], giving support to
the possibility of one enzyme playing roles in both the cell
wall and defense.
A few reports described the expression patterns of β-glucosidases in rice plants. Based on enzyme activity, gibberellic acid glucoside and pyridoxine glucoside βglucosidases are found in rice bran [23,52], and the cell
wall-bound enzyme is found in seedlings [16]. Northern
blot analysis showed that Os3bglu7 and Os9bglu30 (rice
bglu 2 in Opassiri et al. [24])β-glucosidase genes are highly
expressed in seedling shoots, but only Os3bglu7 is
expressed in flowers [24]. Microarray analysis indicated
that the transcripts of the ESTs BE607353 and BG101702,
whose sequences are homologous to Os3bglu7 and
Os4bglu12 β-glucosidases genes, respectively, are upregulated in response to high salinity stress in salt-tolerant rice
(var Pokkali), but not in the salt-sensitive cultivar IR29
[53]. Subtractive hybridization cDNA library screening
indicated that the transcript level of the EST contig
BPHiw028, homologous to Os4bglu12, is upregulated in
response to brown planthopper [54]. The presence of
tricin-O-glucoside, a probing stimulant for planthopper
[31], suggests that the role of this enzyme is to release an
active flavonol for defense. However, these studies did not
show the specific roles of these enzymes in rice cells in
response to such stresses. Therefore, identification of natural substrates for the enzymes is needed to understand
the functions of these enzymes.
Properties of predicted proteins
The deduced precursor proteins were analyzed for potential signal sequences using SignalP, and cellular location
by PSORT. Almost all β-glucosidase ORFs, except
Os1bglu4 and Osbglu39, were predicted to have signal
peptides ranging in length from 18 to 44 amino acids,
which would target them to the secretory pathway (Table
2). Three Arabidopsis GH1 members, AtBGLU26, 27, and
42 were predicted to not have signal peptides [22]. In Arabidopsis, putative signal peptides were predicted to range
in length from 19–38 aa. The predicted cellular locations
for rice GH1 proteins included the cell exterior, cyto-

plasm, peroxisome, vacuole, ER lumen, ER membrane,
plasma membrane, and mitochondrial matrix, which are
similar to Arabidopsis proteins. Though assignment of cellular location was generally unclear using the PSORT program, Os1bglu2 and Os11bglu36 (Arabidopsis SFR2
homolog) are predicted to localize to the chloroplast, like
maize, sorghum, wheat and oat β-glucosidases, though
they are not closely related phylogenetically. However,
none of the Arabidopsis β-glucosidases seemed to be targeted to plastids, except possibly SFR2 (which is closely
related to Os11bglu36 and gave a weak prediction of this
localization). The deduced proteins were also analyzed for
predicted molecular mass, pI, and potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Table 2). Predicted precursor protein
lengths vary from 458–647 amino acids, which corre-

spond to protein molecular weights of 55.3 to 73.2 kD.
Mature polypeptide lengths vary from 474–592 amino
acids, corresponding to MW 53.8–70.8 kD. All but
Os1bglu4 contain one to six N-linked glycosylation sites.
Isoelectric points (pI) of predicted proteins are divided
into 3 groups, acidic (4.96–6.66), neutral (6.99–7.78),
and basic (8.36–8.96), and 21 of 35 of these proteins are
in the acidic group. Predicted protein properties of rice
GH1 members are similar to Arabidopsis GH1 proteins,
which have predicted MW of precursor proteins and
mature proteins in the range of 56–70.1 and 53–68 kD,
respectively, and contain one to five N-glycosylation sites
[22]. Similar to Os1bglu4, AtBGLU25 and 27 do not contain N glycosylation sites. The number of likely isozymes
complicates the interpretation of results from traditional

biochemical approaches, such as measuring enzyme activities in tissue extracts. Protein purification may also be difficult due to the similar sizes and pI of several predicted
isozymes, as seen in Table 2.
Although the occurrence of a number of glycosides in rice
is known, few rice β-glucosidases have been studied and
none of them has been tested for activity on most of the
known natural glycosides. The first report of rice β-glucosidase activity against the synthetic substrate pNP-β-Dglucoside (pNPG) was by Palmiano and Juliano [55]. Partially purified β-glucosidases from rice have been
described that hydrolyze gibberellin glucosides and pyridoxine glucosides [23,52]. Analysis of thoroughly purified rice β-glucosidases has been described for a βglucosidase from a cell wall-bound fraction (possibly
Os4bglu12) and Os3bglu7 cloned from rice seedlings
[16,17,24]. Both enzymes showed high hydrolytic activity
against cello- and laminari-oligosaccharides. In order to
better characterize the function of the GH1 multi-enzyme
family in rice, recombinant expression of these genes or
their cDNAs to produce the enzymes is necessary. The
recombinant production and characterization of
Os4bglu12 is presented below as a first step in establishing the biochemical function of the rice GH1 enzymes.

Os4bglu12 β-glucosidase cDNAs cloning and sequence
analysis
The protein product for Os4bglu12 gene has highest
sequence similarity to the previously described cell wallbound β-glucosidase purified from rice seedlings [16].
Therefore, it was chosen for expression to test if the protein would have the expected activity. The sequence of the
Os4bglu12 β-glucosidase mRNA from rice was confirmed
by RT-PCR cloning and sequencing, using rice cultivar
KDML105 cDNA as the template. A specific PCR product
of 1635 bp was produced, and its sequence overlapped
that of the indica rice contig AAAA02014151.

The reconstructed cDNA sequence of Os4bglu12 included
a 1530-nucleotide long open reading frame encoding a
510 amino acid long precursor protein. The Signal P program predicted the protein to contain a 24 amino acid signal sequence and a 486 amino acid mature protein (Table
2). The deduced Os4bglu12 N-terminal amino acid
sequence was identical to the N-terminal amino acid
sequence of the previously purified cell-wall-bound rice βglucosidase at 40 of 44 residues [16].
Functional expression of recombinant Os4bglu12
The Os4bglu12 cDNA CDS including the stop codon was
inserted into pET32a(+)/DEST. The construct was used to
transform OrigamiB (DE3) E. coli. Comparison of the protein profile of induced cultures with the Os4bglu12 insert
with those of empty plasmid controls by SDS-PAGE
showed the thioredoxin-Os4bglu12 fusion protein as an
intense band at 69 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein
was purified by IMAC, and a band corresponding to 69
kDa was observed in SDS-PAGE (Figure 5). The enzyme
was found to hydrolyze pNPG with optimal activity at pH
5.0 and 37°C. The enzyme activity with pNPG at 70°C
and 80°C drops about 17% and 39%, respectively, from
the optimal activity at 37°C in a 10 min assay. It was stable at 4°C for several months.
Os4bglu12 substrate specificity
The activity of the purified rice Os4bglu12 β-glucosidase
towards natural and artificial glycosides is summarized in
Table 3. The Os4bglu12 hydrolyzed the β-1,3-linked glucose disaccharide laminaribiose, but not cellobiose (β1,4) or gentiobiose (β-1,6). It showed high hydrolytic efficiency at different rates with β-(1,4)-linked oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization (DP) of 3–6.
Hydrolysis of β-(1,3)-linked oligosaccharides with DP > 2,
laminarin and barley 1,3, 1,4-β-glucans by this enzyme
could not be detected. The rate of hydrolysis of oligomeric
substrates tended to remain approximately constant with
increasing DP, which is a characteristic often observed
with β-glucosidases [56]. On the TLC, Os4bglu12 showed
hydrolytic activity towards 5 mM laminaribiose and cello-

oligosaccharides, but no measurable transglycosylation
activity (Figure 6).
Hydrolysis of pNP-glycosides with different glycone moieties was used to assess glycone specificity of Os4bglu12.
It hydrolyzed pNPG and pNP-β-D-fucoside with 2–3 fold
lower efficiency than oligosaccharides. It also hydrolyzed
pNP-β-D-galactoside, pNP-β-D-xyloside, and pNP-α-Larabinoside, at 45%, 45% and 26% the rate of pNPG,
respectively. Hydrolysis of pNP-β-D-mannoside, pNP-βD-cellobioside, pNP-α-D-glucoside, and pNP-β-L-fucoside
was not detectable. High hydrolysis of β-xyloside is similar to white clover β-glucosidase, but otherwise rare in
GH1 enzymes that have been characterized to date [57].
Rice Os4bglu12, Os3bglu7 [24], and cell wall-bound βglucosidases [16] and barley β II β-glucosidase [45] are
enzymes that hydrolyze β-linked glucose oligosaccharides, but not polysaccharides. However, the specificity for
glycones and substrate chain lengths of these enzymes are
different. In contrast to barley and rice cell wall-bound
enzyme, Os4bglu12 did not hydrolyze β-(1,3)-linked oligosaccharides longer than laminaribiose, but hydrolyzed
various pNP-derivatives of monosaccharides. This substrate preference was not expected, since it was initially
expected that Os4bglu12 was the gene for the cell wallbound β-glucosidase, and the sequence differences might
be due to cultivar differences or sequencing errors. The
substrate preference of Os4bglu12 is somewhat similar to
Os3bglu7, in that they both show slightly faster hydrolysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/33

of pNP-β-D-fucoside than pNPG and hydrolyze laminaribiose and cello-oligosaccharides. However, there were
many differences between these enzymes. For example, in
contrast to rice Os3bglu7, Os4bglu12 hydrolyzed β-(1,4)linked oligosaccharides and laminaribiose at higher rates
than pNPG, and did not hydrolyze cellobiose, gentiobiose, pNP-β-D-mannoside, and pNP-β-D-cellobioside.
Their sequence differences are likely to reflect the differences in substrate binding to the active site between these
enzymes. The amino acids identified by Czjzek et al. [41]
as critical for glucose binding (Q38, H142, E191, E406,
E464 and W465 in maize Bglu1) are conserved in rice
Os4bglu12, Os3bglu7, and barley β-glucosidase. Interestingly, the Os3bglu7 protein sequence was closest to barley
BGQ60 at some of substrate binding residues that line the
active site cleft and interact with the substrate aglycone of
maize Bglu1 (W378, F198, F205, and F466) [41], suggesting Os3bglu7 and BGQ60 may have a similar substratespecificity. However, these above mentioned amino acid
residues were different from those in the Os4bglu12
enzyme, which may account for the different substrate
specificities for some oligosaccharides and glycones. For
instance, Os3bglu7 and barley BGQ60 cluster with
tomato and Arabidopsis β-mannosidase and can hydrolyze
β-mannoside, while Os4bglu12 does not, and they also
hydrolyze longer chain 1,3-linked oligosaccharides
[17,46]. All three enzymes prefer shorter 1,3-linked oligosaccharides, with Os4bglu12 being the most extreme,
only hydrolyzing the dimer with this linkage. This likely
reflects the bent shape of oligosaccharides with the 1,3-

site for longer chains. Elucidation of the tertiary structures
of these enzymes would help to clarify the enzyme-substrate binding mechanism leading to these preferences.

Conclusion

In summary, forty genes encoding GH1 β-glucosidases
have been identified from the rice genome databases.
Gene-derived cDNAs were predicted and compared to
experimentally derived cDNA in the database. Intronexon boundaries and intron numbers are highly conserved among rice and other plant β-glucosidase genes. At
least 31 rice β-glucosidase genes have corresponding ESTs,
indicating their transcription, and these ESTs come from
many tissues, indicating their temporal and spatial regulation and importance for the rice plant. Most of these genes
appear to have diverged from each other after the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis from their common ancestor,
implying that their functions may not be easily defined by
studies in Arabidopsis and other dicots. To begin a functional analysis of rice GH1 enzymes, the Os4bglu12 cDNA
encoding the protein with the amino acid sequence that
was most similar to the previously purified and characterized cell wall-bound β-glucosidase was cloned by RT-PCR
and expressed in E. coli. Recombinant Os4bglu12 protein
hydrolyzed β-linked oligosaccharides and pNP-glycosides.
The specificity of Os4bglu12 for oligosaccharides and
pNP-glycosides was different from the previously characterized GH1 β-glucosidases/exoglucanases, cell wall-

Plant materials and growth conditions
Rice (Oryza sativa L. spp. indica cv. KDML105) seeds were
germinated in the dark from day 0 to day 3 and in 12 h
light-12 h dark from day 4 to day 6 at 28°C on germinating paper moistened with sterile distilled water. The
whole seedlings were harvested and kept at -70°C.
Database searching and sequence analysis
Identification of rice genes homologous to GH1 β-glucosidase genes was done using the BLAST suite of programs [58] in 4 databases: GenBank at NCBI [59], the
Monsanto Rice Genome Draft Database [60], the Beijing
Genomic Institute, BGI [26] and the Syngenta Torrey
Mesa Research Institute database [61]. Because all genes
could be found in the GenBank japonica and BGI indica
sequences, the other databases were not included. Identification of homologous genes and cDNA was done using
tBLASTn with known β-glucosidase protein sequences
from GenBank: rice bglu1 (AC U28047) maize bglu1 (AC
U33816), barley BGQ60 (AC L41869), and Arabidopsis
psr3.2 (AC U72155), as queries, while BLASTn was used
to identify sequences from the same gene. Coding regions
of genes were identified by BLASTx searches against the
NCBI nr protein database. Exact splice sites were predicted
by identification of splice site consensus sequences near
the ends of identified coding regions, which maintained
the correct reading frame. When available, full-length
cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences were
used to confirm the gene predictions. Translation of gene
sequences was done using the 6-frame translation facility
at the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) search launcher
site [62,63]. The ClustalX implementation of ClustalW
was used for protein sequence alignments [64,65] and
phylogenetic analyses done by the built in NJ-tree facility
of this program with bootstrapping (1000 iterations),
after manual adjustment of the alignment with the Genedoc program. Bootstrapped neighbor joining and maximum parsimony trees with and without gap sequences
were also developed with the PHYLYP suite [66], and the
results were compared to those generated with ClustalX.
The rice SFR2 homologue, Os11bglu36, was used as the
outgroup in these analyses, since it is derived from a distinct lineage within GH1.

The organization of the genes was diagramed and categorized from the conservation of introns and exons in rice βglucosidase gene structures. The sequence and gene struc-

ture analyses were correlated to describe the evolutionary
relationships among the genes. Each β-glucosidase gene
sequence was searched against the GenBank at NCBI
using BLASTn to identify the chromosomal locations. Cellular locations of predicted proteins were predicted by
PSORT [67], signal sequences were predicted by SignalP
[68], N-glycosylation sites were predicted by NetNGlyc,
and the molecular weights (MW) and isoelectric points
(pI) of the proteins were predicted by ProtParam at the
Expasy proteomics server [69].
In order to determine the relative abundance of mRNAs of
each GH1 gene in rice, a BLASTn search with the derived
cDNA sequence for each predicted gene was performed in
dbEST and the japonica rice full-length cDNA clones [50].
All EST/cDNA clone IDs were retrieved and collected in
the catalog to compare gene expression in various library
sources. In addition, rice-specific tBLASTn searches using
known β-glucosidase protein sequences were performed
in the dbEST to identify all ESTs/cDNAs encoding β-glucosidase proteins from rice, as described for gene identification. Final EST/cDNA collections for each gene were
compared with the Unigene facility of the NCBI GenBank
database.
Cloning of rice Os4bglu12 β-glucosidase cDNA
Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg 5-6-d-old rice seedlings using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The
total RNA (5 μg) was used as the template to synthesize
the first-strand cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Primers for amplifying the full-length coding
sequence (CDS) cDNA (designated Os4bglu12) and a
cDNA encoding the mature protein of rice Os4bglu12 βglucosidase were designed from the GenBank indica rice
genome contig number AAAA02014151 and the
AK100820 and AK105375 cDNA sequences [50]. A 5'
sense primer, Os4bglu12_fullf (5'-TGTCCATGGCGGCAGCAG-3'),
and
the
antisense
primer,
Os4bglu12_3'UTRr (5'-AACTGGATTACTTCCATCTC-3'),
were used to amplify the full-length cDNA. The amplification was done with 30 cycles of 94°C, 30 s, 53°C 30 s and
72°C 4 min, and Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). A full-length product was cloned into the EcoR V
site of pBlueScript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and
sequenced.
Protein expression in Escherichia coli
The cDNA encoding the mature protein of rice Os4bglu12
β-glucosidase was cloned by RT-PCR and inserted into
pENTR-D/TOPO Gateway entry vector and transferred to
the pET32a (+)/DEST Gateway expression vector for
expression. The Gateway Conversion cassette A was
ligated into the EcoRV site of pET32a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the Invitrogen Gateway Conver-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/33

sion Kit directions, to create the pET32a (+)/DEST
Gateway expression vector. The cDNA encoding the
mature protein of the Os4bglu12 was PCR amplified
using cDNA cloned as the template with the
Os4bglu12matNcoIf
(5'-CACCATGGCCTACAATAGCGCCGGCGAG-3') and Os4bglu12stopr (5'-ATCATTTCAGGAGGAACTTCTTG-3') primers and Pfu DNA
polymerase to introduce a directional cloning site at the 5'
end. The amplification was done as above, but with 45°C
annealing temperature. The PCR product was cloned into
the pENTR-D/TOPO Gateway entry vector, according to
the supplier's directions (Invitrogen). The cDNA insert in
the pENTR-D/TOPO vectors was subcloned into the
pET32a (+)/DEST Gateway expression vector by LR Clonase recombination by the recommended protocol (Invitrogen) and sequenced completely. The recombinant
pET32a (+)/DEST-Os4bglu12 plasmid was transformed
into OrigamiB (DE3) E. coli by the CaCl2 method [70], and
positive clones were selected on a 15 μg/mL kanamycin,
12.5 μg/mL tetracycline and 100 μg/mL ampicillin LBagar plate.
For recombinant protein expression, the selected clones
were grown in LB medium containing 15 μg/mL kanamycin, 12.5 μg/mL tetracycline and 100 μg/mL ampicillin at
37°C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6,
IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM, and
the cultures were incubated at 20°C for 8 h. Induced cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4°C
for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in freshly
prepared extraction buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer (pH
8.0), 200 μg/mL lysozyme, 1% Triton-X 100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 40 μg/mL DNase I), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The soluble
protein was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at
4°C for 10 min. The expressed thioredoxin-Os4bglu12
fusion protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity
chromatography (IMAC) with TALON cobalt resin
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clonetech,
Palo Alto, CA). The fractions with pNPG hydrolysis activity were pooled and concentrated with 10 kDa-cut-off centrifugal ultrafiltration membranes (YM-10, Amicon). All
of the protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE by the
standard method [71].

β-glucosidase assays
Substrate specificity of thioredoxin-Os4bglu12 fusion
protein was tested against oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. For oligosaccharides, 0.05 μg (0.72 pmol)
enzyme was incubated with 1 mM substrate in 50 mM
sodium acetate (pH 5.0) for 5 min at 37°C and the reaction was stopped by boiling. The release of the glucose
was determined by the peroxidase/glucose oxidase (PGO)
assay method and visualized on TLC, as previously
described [18,24]. The enzyme was also tested with

polysaccharides. In the assay, 1–5 μg enzyme was incubated separately with 0.5% (w/v) laminarin and barley βglucans in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) at 37°C for
30–60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of
p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrozide reagent as described by
[72], and the increase in reducing sugars was measured
colorimetrically.
The glycon specificity of recombinant Os4bglu12 β-glucosidase was tested against synthetic substrates, pNP-glycosides. In a 100 μL reaction, 0.05 μg (0.72 pmol) enzyme
was incubated with 1 mM pNP-glycoside substrate in 50
mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 5 min at 37°C.
Then, 70 μL of 0.4 M sodium carbonate was added to stop
the reaction, and the absorbance of the liberated pNP was
measured at 405 nm. One unit of β-glucosidase activity
was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1
μmol of product per min. Protein assays were performed
by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA)
using bovine serum albumin as a standard.
The pH optimum was determined by measuring the
release of pNP from pNPG in different 50 mM buffers
ranging in pH from 3.5 to 10 in 0.5 pH unit increments
for 10 min (formate, pH 3.5–4.5; sodium acetate, pH 4.0–
5.5; sodium phosphate, pH 5.5–8; Tris, pH 7.5–9.0;
CAPS, pH 9.0–10). To find the temperature optimum,
pNPG hydrolysis was measured in 50 mM sodium acetate
(pH 5.0) at temperatures ranging from 5°C to 90°C in 5°
increments for 10 min.
