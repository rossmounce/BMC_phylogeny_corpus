Abstract
Background: The mitochondrial DNA of kinetoplastid flagellates is distinctive in the eukaryotic
world due to its massive size, complex form and large sequence content. Comprised of catenated
maxicircles that contain rRNA and protein-coding genes and thousands of heterogeneous
minicircles encoding small guide RNAs, the kinetoplast network has evolved along with an extreme
form of mRNA processing in the form of uridine insertion and deletion RNA editing. Many
maxicircle-encoded mRNAs cannot be translated without this post-transcriptional sequence
modification.
Results: We present the complete sequence and annotation of the Trypanosoma cruzi maxicircles
for the CL Brener and Esmeraldo strains. Gene order is syntenic with Trypanosoma brucei and
Leishmania tarentolae maxicircles. The non-coding components have strain-specific repetitive
regions and a variable region that is unique for each strain with the exception of a conserved
sequence element that may serve as an origin of replication, but shows no sequence identity with
L. tarentolae or T. brucei. Alternative assemblies of the variable region demonstrate intra-strain
heterogeneity of the maxicircle population. The extent of mRNA editing required for particular
genes approximates that seen in T. brucei. Extensively edited genes were more divergent among the
genera than non-edited and rRNA genes. Esmeraldo contains a unique 236-bp deletion that
removes the 5'-ends of ND4 and CR4 and the intergenic region. Esmeraldo shows additional
insertions and deletions outside of areas edited in other species in ND5, MURF1, and MURF2, while
CL Brener has a distinct insertion in MURF2.
Conclusion: The CL Brener and Esmeraldo maxicircles represent two of three previously defined
maxicircle clades and promise utility as taxonomic markers. Restoration of the disrupted reading
frames might be accomplished by strain-specific RNA editing. Elements in the non-coding region
may be important for replication, transcription, and anchoring of the maxicircle within the
kinetoplast network.

Background
The mitochondrial DNA referred to as the kinetoplast
(kDNA) is a spectacular structure that comprises approximately 20–25% of the total cellular DNA in Trypanosoma
cruzi, a member of the flagellated protozoans of the Order
Kinetoplastida [1]. The equally dramatic process of RNA
editing is also found in this specialized subcellular compartment, and the two are intimately associated. The
kDNA is comprised of two classes of circular DNA molecules that are catenated and compressed into a disc-like
structure. Maxicircles are the functional equivalent of the
mitochondrial DNA of other eukaryotes, containing genes
for mitochondrial rRNAs and hydrophobic mitochondrial
proteins mostly involved in the membrane-bound oxidative phosphorylation pathway [2]. At first glance the maxicircle genomes appear to lack several genes that are
hallmarks of other mitochondrial genomes, while other
genes are missing elements key to their translation such as
initiation codons or contiguous ORFs. Post-transcriptional uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing resolves
most of these problematic issues, by creating start codons
[3,4], correcting internal frameshifts (e.g., four uridines
inserted in COII [5-7]), and extensively modifying otherwise unrecognizable mRNA transcripts to create entire
ORFs [8] (e.g., 547 uridines inserted and 41 deleted in
COIII of Trypanosoma brucei [9]). The mechanistic process
of RNA editing is the subject of intense study in T. brucei
and Leishmania tarentolae [10,11].
The heterogeneous minicircle population makes up the
bulk of the kDNA mass with tens of thousands of copies
per network, and carries the specific information for RNA
editing in the form of guide RNAs (gRNAs). A handful of
gRNAs are also encoded on the maxicircle, with 15 thus
far identified in L. tarentolae and three in T. brucei [12].
The gRNAs interact with the mRNA templates through
hybridization to dictate the precise location and number
of uridine insertions or deletions; the interaction is tolerant of wobble base pairing of G-U, in addition to the
standard Watson-Crick pairs. The level of sequence variability permissible in the gRNA pool with no loss of functional information is impressive, as any pairing with G or
U residues in the mRNA are unaffected by transition
mutations in the gRNA. This leads to tolerance of
sequence divergence while maintaining function, as evidenced by the lack of cross-recognition of the gRNAs from
two strains (SylvioX10 and CANIII) of T. cruzi [13]. The
minicircle variable regions that encode the gRNAs have
been used as molecular markers for strain genotyping and
comparison [14]. The minicircle population of T. cruzi is
highly variable between strains and evolves rapidly over
time, allowing differentiation of closely related strains
[15-18].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/60

T. cruzi is the causative agent of human Chagas disease,
affecting millions throughout the American continents,
and is estimated to kill 100,000 people per year [19]. The
infection is spread by introduction of vector insect contaminated feces into an open wound or mucus membrane
of the victim. Once inside the human host, T. cruzi infects
macrophages and replicates aggressively, producing high
titers of parasite in the bloodstream that then spread
throughout the tissues of the body. Approximately 5% of
infected individuals die in this acute stage. Ultimately the
infection will enter a quiescent phase that can last for decades, characterized by a low blood titer of the parasite and
no overt symptoms. In 30% of the cases, clinical pathologies will eventually develop after 20+ years, reflecting a
preference for cardiac and smooth muscle tissue by the
parasite. Chronic phase chagasic patients may die from
one of a suite of mega syndromes affecting the heart,
esophagus, or colon. While the factors determining development of these specific syndromes is not understood, the
genetics of both the host and the parasite play roles in the
outcome [20].
Unraveling the genetics of T. cruzi has been a major
endeavor for decades. Currently T. cruzi is partitioned into
two groups [21] that can be subdivided into six subgroups
or discrete typing units (DTUs) designated I, IIa, IIb, IIc,
IId, and IIe [22-24]. Nuclear markers indicate that
homozygous DTUs IIa and IIc are the result of a relatively
ancient hybridization event between strains of DTUs I and
IIb; the extensively heterozygous DTUs IId and IIe are
products of a more recent hybridization event and possess
two alleles similar to those found in DTUs IIb and IIc at
most loci [25]. The reference strain chosen for the T. cruzi
genome-sequencing project, CL Brener, is a member of
DTU IIe. Sequencing of Esmeraldo, a homozygous DTU
IIb strain, was undertaken to aid in resolution of ambiguity in the assembly of the CL Brener genome.
The influence of a persistent T. cruzi infection in development of chronic stage of Chagas disease is the subject of
debate, since the direct cause of pathogenesis has yet to be
determined conclusively [26-31]. Essentially, there are
two alternative hypotheses: 1) the presence of the parasite
itself results in destruction of infected tissues, versus 2)
infection by the parasite triggers an autoimmune response
against cells not necessarily harboring active infections. In
addition to a multitude of protein antigens [32], an alternative stimulus for initiation of the autoimmune response
has been proposed. During the cellular invasion process,
DNA from the parasite is integrated into the host genome.
The DNA species implicated in this horizontal transfer
event is the minicircle [33,34]. Whether this is a benign
byproduct of infection, or a potential link to Chagas disease pathology, the function of T. cruzi kDNA is relevant

to understanding parasite biology and the host-parasite
relationship.
Genetic variation in the T. cruzi maxicircle will be subject
to more stringent selection pressure due to the presence of
structural genes compared to the transition-tolerant
gRNAs largely carried in the minicircles, and should provide phylogenetically meaningful markers. Maxicircle
genes from T. brucei and L. tarentolae have been determined, showing that gene order, or synteny, is conserved
[2]. Estimates of the total size of the T. cruzi maxicircle fall
between 21 and 39 kb by various methods [35,36], and a
fragment of maxicircle from the Tulahuen strain was
sequenced [37]. Assorted fragments of maxicircles from
several T. cruzi strains have been examined for taxonomic
studies [38-41]. An extensive T. cruzi maxicircle survey
examined a 1.25-kb fragment, identifying a correlation
between the DTUs and three maxicircle clades [40]: clade
A corresponded to DTU I, clade B to strains of DTUs IIa,
IIc, IId, and IIe, and clade C was exclusive to DTU IIb
strains. The same association was observed in similar
analyses [38].
We present annotated sequences of the T. cruzi maxicircles
for the CL Brener (DTU IIe) and Esmeraldo (DTU IIb)
strains assembled from data generated by the TIGR-SBRIKI T. cruzi Sequencing Consortium (TSK-TSC). The anticipated cohort of genes was present, and the non-coding
regions of both strains were assembled. The coding region
of each genome contained little or no single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) variability, but do possess strainspecific insertion/deletion mutations (indels). Esmeraldo
has a large deletion removing substantial portions of two
adjacent genes. This study provides the framework for
continued study of kDNA biology, RNA editing, and Chagas disease pathology in T. cruzi.

Results
Two T. cruzi maxicircle assemblies
The T. cruzi genome project took the approach of wholegenome shotgun sequencing of clones from libraries of
size-selected fragments from a total cell DNA preparation
with a minimum insert size of 5 kb. Clones were
sequenced from both ends, providing between 500 bp
and 1 kb of primary sequence and a physical link between
opposing end-sequenced mate pairs from each clone [42].
A BLAST search of the primary reads from this project
identified sequences of the CL Brener and Esmeraldo
strains with identity to maxicircle coding regions from T.
cruzi and T. brucei. The chromosome shotgun or large
insert clone-based sequencing strategies employed by the
L. major and T. brucei genome projects would preclude the
capture of maxicircles.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/60

The kDNA maxicircles of T. cruzi strains CL Brener and
Esmeraldo have been assembled from whole-genome
shotgun sequences (Fig. 1). Contigs assembled from the
selected reads were merged to generate the maxicircle
assembly covering the coding region, from which other
contigs were added progressively based on mate pair
information and identity to extend the assembly into the
non-coding region. Consensus sequences were generated
from assembled contigs with an average of 32X and 60X
coverage for the CL Brener and Esmeraldo maxicircles,
respectively. Assembly of both maxicircles was complicated by the presence of multiple variants due to apparent
intrastrain heterogeneity of the maxicircle population.
This variation was observed mainly in the non-coding
region 4–6 kb upstream of the 12S rRNA. Due to the difficulty in assembly of the non-coding region, the total
lengths of the maxicircles were estimated based on coverage values of the coding region, assuming relatively equal
coverage throughout the entire maxicircle and a population of maxicircles of equal size. Calculations based on
these assumptions produce lengths of approximately 22
kb and 28 kb for CL Brener and Esmeraldo, respectively.
Our consensus CL Brener and Esmeraldo maxicircles represent one variant for each of the non-coding region, and
alternative assemblies with different variants were also
assembled [see Additional file 1] (sequences available
upon request). The differential size of Esmeraldo compared to CL Brener results from a larger non-coding region
with larger duplicated conserved elements within the variable region, while coding region size is comparable. Polymorphisms in the non-coding regions likely represent
natural variation within the multi-copy maxicircle population within each kinetoplast and among cells in culture,
similar to the variation seen amongst multi-copy nuclear
gene arrays [43].
The annotation of gene positions and lengths in the two
T. cruzi maxicircles based on annotation of T. brucei and L.
tarentolae is listed in Table 1. The order of the rRNAs and
genes on the T. cruzi maxicircle transcripts is syntenic with
the T. brucei and L. tarentolae maxicircles. A 5736-nt fragment of the maxicircle coding region [GenBank: U43567]
that was cloned and sequenced from the Tulahuen (DTU
IIe) strain [37] shows 98% and 88% identity to CL Brener
and Esmeraldo maxicircles over the same region. The
boundaries of the C-rich region (CR) 3 gene in L. tarentolae has been determined [44], but is not yet known for
T. brucei; as the L. tarentolae sequence is divergent from T.
brucei and T. cruzi, our annotation of this gene may be
imprecise. Maxicircle-encoded gRNAs are likely present in
T. cruzi, but not yet included in the annotation, awaiting
validation of actual RNA editing events.
The coverage of these genomes provides a high level of
confidence in the assembled products. The CL Brener

nuclear genome was sequenced to approximately 7X coverage, and Esmeraldo to 2.2X coverage. Despite this difference, the maxicircle genome coverage is deep for both
strains. The high relative abundance of maxicircle
sequences in the Esmeraldo dataset suggests that the
Esmeraldo total cell DNA preparation had a higher content of kDNA relative to the CL Brener starting material.
The difference was probably due to loss of intact network
during phenol extraction, and not representative of the
relative amount of kDNA in each strain.
Nucleotide skew identifies gene orientation and editing
locations
The T. cruzi maxicircle coding regions provide the primary
templates for the RNA editing process. Using the maxicircle annotation for L. tarentolae and T. brucei the identification of ORFs and 'cryptic' genes that are extensively edited
at the RNA level was straightforward. In comparative analyses CL Brener was used as the T. cruzi reference sequence.

The nucleotide frequency and skew throughout the T.
cruzi maxicircle coding region correlated with gene orientation and extent of editing. The coding region is 74% ATrich (Table 3), reflecting the AT-richness of the mitochondrial genome as a whole [45]. The AT-skew plot demonstrates the bias towards a T-rich coding strand that is more
pronounced in non-edited genes (Fig. 2), as was also the
case for T. brucei and L. tarentolae maxicircle genes [46].
The coding regions of extensively edited genes, which are
comprised primarily of purines and have as much as half
of the final edited mRNA content contributed by inserted
uridines, display low %TA. The non-edited genes produce
U-rich mRNAs similar in nucleotide content to extensively-edited mRNAs following editing; their U-richness is
encoded in the DNA, lending support to the hypothesis
that these genes were originally smaller, extensivelyedited genes that were replaced by reverse-transcription of
fully-edited versions by a retrotransposition event [46].
The GC skew plot illustrated a similar bias toward G-rich-

ness of the coding strand that is most pronounced in
genes requiring extensive editing (Fig. 2). The observed
GC skew resulted in the original naming as G-rich or Crich regions [47]. The skew is much greater in the coding
region than for the maxicircle overall (Table 3). The genes
contain few C residues, suggesting a negative selection by
the editing process that maintains cytosines only in
regions where protein function and codon usage dictate
their necessity. Regions of extreme GC bias as represented
by the peaks in the %GC plot corresponded to extensively
edited genes referred to as C-rich (CR#) or G-rich (G#)
regions in T. brucei and L. tarentolae.
Similarity of RNA editing in T. cruzi and T. brucei
The nucleotide skew analyses indicated that T. cruzi maxicircle coding regions have GC skew patterns suggestive of
extensive editing of genes that are differentially edited in
T. brucei and L. tarentolae. Direct comparisons of the maxicircle genomes were performed to confirm this observation.

Dot plot analyses of the CL Brener maxicircle with T. brucei or L. tarentolae identified regions of sequence homology between the two genomes (Fig. 3). Each dot
represents 100% identity over a 12-bp window. The formation of diagonal lines running through the plots indicated extended areas of high sequence identity. The
diagonals were limited to the protein-coding regions, with

breaks in the T. cruzi vs. L. tarentolae plot corresponding to
genes that are edited to different extents at the RNA level
(ND7, COIII, and ATPase6) [48]. T. brucei showed greater
overall sequence identity, represented by a diagonal line,
matching CL Brener throughout the coding region; thus T.
cruzi exhibited primary sequences suggestive of the more
enthusiastic use of the RNA editing process as seen in T.
brucei.
The sequences of the rRNAs and coding regions of panedited and non-edited genes of the T. cruzi, T. brucei, and
L. tarentolae maxicircles were aligned and percent identity
determined. The extensively edited genes have lower percent identity levels on average than the non-edited genes,
while rRNAs showed the highest identities (Table 2). In
comparisons of T. cruzi to L. tarentolae the identity jumps
from 42% for edited genes to 76% for non-edited genes,
indicating that RNA editing permits a greater genetic
divergence at the level of the DNA template between genera. Identities for the rRNAs and the non-edited genes do
not differ greatly, supporting this thesis. However, alignment of edited RNAs for L. tarentolae and T. brucei showed
that differences at the DNA level are decreased following
editing, providing higher percent identity in the final
products [49]. The T. cruzi maxicircle sequence indicated
that ND8, ND9, ND7, COIII, ATPase6, G3, G4, G5, and
RPS12 are edited extensively as in T. brucei. Potential T.
cruzi-specific regions for editing are presented below.

A conserved element in the variable region of the noncoding sequences
Assembly of the CL Brener and Esmeraldo maxicircles
allowed us to examine intra-specific variation at the
genomic level. As the mitochondrial DNA of vertebrates is
an excellent marker for intra-specific differences, the T.
cruzi maxicircle is an interesting candidate for distinction
between DTUs, and has been used previously to distinguish three clades [38,40]. Sequence differences were
found in the gene-coding and non-coding regions. We
begin with consideration of the non-coding regions where
the sequences are most divergent.

The non-coding region differed significantly between CL
Brener and Esmeraldo maxicircle assemblies and could be
divided into regions that we refer to as 'variable' and
'repetitive' (Figs. 1, 4A, B). The variable region was defined

because several variants were assembled in CL Brener and
Esmeraldo, with most of the variation occurring within 4–
6 kb upstream of the coding region [see Additional file 2].
A sequence element represented at least twice per maxicircle is conserved between the CL Brener and Esmeraldo
maxicircles in this region (Fig. 4C). The core of the element was 97 bp with an average of 90% identity, dropping to an average of 87% over 195 bp and 77% over 325
bp among all variant contigs assembled for the two strains
(Fig. 4D) [see Additional file 3]. The cross structure
present within the conserved element is due to a match to
the reverse complement of a 39-bp sequence that forms
an imperfect palindrome near the beginning of the conserved 97-bp core (Fig. 4E). CL Brener has at least two
imperfect copies of the element, of which the 3' copy has
a 75-bp deletion in the 195-bp area. Interestingly, this
deletion removes the first six bases of the 39-bp palin-

Entire coding region includes contiguous sequence from the start of 12S rRNA to the end of ND5

drome. The two 97-bp cores present in the consensus
sequences reside 2237 nt and 1085 nt upstream of the 12S
rRNA in CL Brener, and 3346 nt and 811 nt upstream of
the 12S rRNA in Esmeraldo. Our consensus assembly may
under-represent the size of the variable region, meaning
that a single maxicircle may contain more than two copies
of this element. The presence of duplicated conserved elements in this region combined with intrastrain variability
precluded conclusive consensus determination. Alternative assemblies of this variable region produced catenated,
tandem repeats with multiple copies of the conserved elements that are likely assembly artifacts not representative
of an actual molecule [see Additional file 1].
Conservation of the 325-bp element between CL Brener
and Esmeraldo within the otherwise heterogeneous noncoding region implies a conserved function. A search for
similar elements within the variable regions of T. brucei
and L. tarentolae maxicircles, their entire genomes, and
the NCBI databases, yielded no match. However, the ele-

ment is in the same region upstream of the 12S rRNA and
shows a tandem organization similar to a duplicated
sequence described in the Variable Region III of the T. brucei maxicircle [50]. Of the two copies in T. brucei, the 5'
copy is longer, while the 3' copy is shorter, analogous to
the pattern in CL Brener. No sequence identity can be seen
between the T. cruzi element and the T. brucei sequence,
but the common organization within the non-coding
regions is suggestive. The 39-bp palindrome sequence
found in T. cruzi is an attractive candidate for a dimeric or
multimeric protein complex binding site. A search for palindromes within the analogous tandem repeats of T. brucei revealed a 14-bp palindrome (TAAATTTAAATTTA)
present in both repeats. The T. brucei palindrome is
shorter and of different sequence composition relative to
the T. cruzi palindrome.
The repetitive portion of the non-coding region was visualized as a dense block of identity in dot plot analyses
comparing this region to itself (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the

variable region, the repetitive region showed no conservation between CL Brener and Esmeraldo, with unique
repeated motifs of different size and sequence composition for each strain. Small motifs were conserved within
the repeated blocks of sequence for each strain [see Additional file 4]. The CL Brener repetitive region is composed
of variants of 267, 330, or 390 bp. Esmeraldo showed
greater intrastrain variability with repeated elements of
296, 307, or 396 bp.
Previous comparisons of repetitive region motifs found
no conservation between T. brucei and L. tarentolae [2]. T.
cruzi also shows no conservation of motifs between strains
or among trypanosomatid species. All are A-rich with
many tandem poly (A)-tracts and a greater than average
AT skew (Table 3). Nucleotide composition analysis
revealed a higher %AT in the repetitive region than the
coding region or the overall maxicircle sequence for all
trypanosomatid maxicircle sequences (Table 3). The variability of these repeats may be useful as specific strain or
DTU markers.
Variability in the T. cruzi coding regions
Protein-coding regions provide specific markers for the
variation among T. cruzi strains [38,40] and, in contrast to
the non-coding regions, they have a recognizable selective

pressure. In considering the functional utility of the maxicircle as a molecular marker for strain identification and
classification, the coding regions present variation that is
likely conserved among DTUs or subgroups of strains,
while the variable regions may allow differentiation
among closely related isolates. No significant variation
was observed within the consensus assembly of the coding region of each strain, indicating high intra-strain
homogeneity of the maxicircle population. The coding
region showed high levels of identity between the two T.
cruzi strains, with some 'editable' differences observed at
SNPs and indels in poly (T) tracts within edited genes.
Comparisons of the coding regions from CL Brener and
Esmeraldo showed identity ranging from 86.2% for extensively edited genes, to 89.9% for non-edited genes, to
92.6% for rRNAs (Table 2). Several examples of small
indels as well as a substantial deletion within the coding
region of the maxicircle with potential detrimental effects
on protein translation will be described.
Truncation of two Esmeraldo maxicircle genes
The most pronounced coding-region difference between
the two strains was a 236-nt deletion in Esmeraldo relative
to the CL Brener maxicircle, resulting in 5'-end truncations of C-rich region 4 (CR4) and NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 4 (ND4) (Fig. 5A). These two genes are tran-

Summary of CL Brener and Esmeraldo coding region polymorphisms

scribed on opposing strands in a head-to-head orientation, and the deletion eliminates the predicted initiation
codons for both genes. Esmeraldo ND4 lacked the first 99
nt of its coding region relative to CL Brener (Fig. 5B). A
downstream in-frame AUG may allow for the expression
of a truncated protein of 397 aa, compared to the 437-aa
CL Brener protein. The deletion leaves 17 nt of the former
reading frame upstream of the potential start codon. The
transmembrane prediction program TMpred [51] indicated that the first two membrane spanning regions of
ND4 to lie at aa 4–21 and aa 45–64, thus the deletion
eliminates the first predicted transmembrane domain.

using primers flanking the Esmeraldo deletion showed
that only Esmeraldo had this deletion, and no vestige of a
full-length version was detected; neither of the DTU I representatives yielded amplification products, likely due to
SNP variation in the primer annealing site.

The Esmeraldo CR4 is missing the first 34 nt of its coding
region as defined in CL Brener (Fig. 5B). By analogy with
the extensively edited T. brucei CR4, 50 nt of the edited
ORF would be lost. An in-frame AUG, 15 nt downstream
of the deletion, may allow for translation of a truncated
protein of 123 aa, compared to 147 aa predicted for CL
Brener. TMpred predicts the first two transmembrane
domains of CR4 to be at aa 4–28 and aa 32–55, thus the
truncated CR4 protein would lack the first transmembrane domain. The function of CR4 is unknown, but
appears conserved with the T. brucei and L. tarentolae
sequences that display 77% and 74% identity at the edited
mRNA and predicted protein levels, respectively.

ND5, MURF1, and MURF2 frameshifts
Multiple additional small indels ranging from 1 to 9 bp
were found in both T. cruzi strains in areas of genes not
requiring RNA editing in T. brucei or L. tarentolae (Fig. 6),
with the preponderance appearing in Esmeraldo. None of
the indels were shared between the strains, several of
which result in the creation of premature termination
codons.

A BLAST search using the corresponding region from CL
Brener confirmed that the deleted sequence is not present
in any of the Esmeraldo reads; greater than 50X regional
coverage gives high confidence that the deletion is found
in all Esmeraldo maxicircles. To query directly the absence
of this region in Esmeraldo, we examined Esmeraldo DNA
along with six additional DTU IIb strains and 13 strains
representing the five other DTUs (data not shown). PCR

The unique appearance of this deletion in the Esmeraldo
strain suggests that it may be a recent event tolerated in a
cultured strain, but deleterious in wild populations. The
indels detailed in the following section point to additional anomalies in the Esmeraldo maxicircle that may be
incompatible with virulence of this strain.

The Esmeraldo ND5, which is not edited in T. brucei and
seemingly does not require editing in CL Brener, has three
frameshift mutations relative to the CL Brener sequence
[see Additional file 5] The first is an insertion at position
479 resulting in the introduction of two in-frame stop
codons 14- and 34-nt downstream. The reading frame is
restored by a single nt deletion relative to the CL Brener
sequence at position 514. Another single nt deletion at
position 1210 again results in a frameshift that alters the
remainder of the ORF. Thus Esmeraldo ND5 translated
directly from the DNA sequence would generate a truncated protein of 165 aa compared to the 589 aa product of
CL Brener.

MURF1 is not well annotated in other species. 5' editing
could create the initiation codon, but no analogous start
codon is annotated in T. brucei or L. tarentolae. We have
used the largest continuous ORF present in T. brucei to
represent the start point for this gene. Using the equivalent start position in T. cruzi, the CL Brener MURF1 codes
for a 446 aa protein. Esmeraldo MURF1 contains two single-nt deletions at positions 73 and 1225 relative to the
CL Brener sequence, both of which result in internal
frameshifts [see Additional file 5]. In addition, Esmeraldo
shows a 9-bp insertion at positions 1315–1323. The deletion at position 73 may have no effect, as the 5' end of the
ORF is undetermined. The frameshift at position 1225
introduces an in-frame stop codon that would result in a
product truncated by 35 aa relative to CL Brener.
The T. brucei MURF2 mRNA is edited at the 5' end by the
insertion of 24 uridine residues to create the initiation
codon and the reading frame up to nt 45 of the ORF. This
localized editing appears to be conserved in T. cruzi; a conserved amino terminus can be predicted after hypothetical
RNA editing in both strains. However, CL Brener and
Esmeraldo both show frameshift mutations in areas that
are apparently not edited in T. brucei [see Additional file
5]. The CL Brener MURF2 had a 4-nt insertion relative to
T. brucei after nt 266 of the predicted edited ORF, creating
in a frameshift that introduces a premature stop codon.
Thus a 101-aa protein would result, containing the first 88
of 357 aa in common with T. brucei and L. tarentolae. The
Esmeraldo MURF2 contained four insertion or deletion
events relative to the T. brucei sequence: a 2-nt insertion at
position 322, a 9-nt deletion at 493, and two single-nt
deletions at positions 746 and 770. Cumulatively, these
differences result in a frameshift starting at aa 181 and
continuing through aa 249, where the frame reverts to the
T. brucei cadence, leaving 69 aa in the central portion of
the 357-aa protein altered. Approximately half of amino
acids in this shifted region are conservative changes relative to CL Brener.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/60

these strains. The size of the total assemblies differed
between CL Brener and Esmeraldo strains due to differences in the repetitive area of the non-coding region; a
strain-specific 236-nt deletion was found in the Esmeraldo coding region. These genomes represent two of the
three T. cruzi maxicircle clades defined previously [38,40].
The profound influence of RNA editing on maxicircle
genes overshadows all other processes affecting mitochondrial genomes. The main evolutionary forces shaping
the nucleotide composition and skew of metazoan mitochondrial genomes are postulated to be the asymmetric
processes of DNA replication and RNA transcription, biasing nucleotide frequency due to differential mutation and
selection pressures [52]. While these processes may have
some effect, RNA editing is the dominant influence affecting AT and GC skew on both strands of the coding region.
Unlike metazoans, where all protein-coding genes are
encoded on the same strand, maxicircle genes are transcribed as polycistronic transcripts from both strands
[47,53], thus the influence of coding bias and directional
mutational bias from transcription would be negated.
Generally, protozoan mitochondrial genomes display
lower %GC than mitochondrial genomes from metazoans, except for those of insects [45], with the trypanosomatid mitochondria showing among the lowest %GC
of all protozoans (Table 3). The extreme AT-richness of
trypanosomatid mitochondrial genomes is due to the
repetitive portion of the non-coding region (Table 3) that
accounts for approximately 15–18% of the T. cruzi maxicircle sequence and 17–30% of the entire maxicircle
sequence in various T. brucei strains [50]. AT skew is
strong in the non-coding region of the maxicircle, but not
in the coding region, while GC skew is inverted. Different
directional biases affect mutation rates in these two
regions, related to gene content issues in the coding region
and to potential structural and functional constraints on
the non-coding region for kinetoplast organization, replication and division.

Discussion
We report the complete maxicircle consensus sequences
from two strains of T. cruzi that are syntenic with the coding regions of maxicircles in T. brucei and L. tarentolae. All
three mitochondrial genomes contain 18 protein-coding
genes and two rRNAs. Strain-specific frame shifts were
documented in several T. cruzi genes at positions not
edited in other kinetoplastids. Comparison of the noncoding region of the two T. cruzi strains showed a duplicated conserved element containing an imperfect 39-bp
palindrome located in the variable region, and divergent
repetitive motifs of similar nucleotide composition in the
repetitive region. Several variants of the CL Brener and
Esmeraldo non-coding region were assembled, indicating
that maxicircle sequence and size are heterogeneous in

The poly (A) tracts of the repetitive region may induce
bending of the DNA over long stretches. DNA bending
was first discovered in minicircles [54], and is found in
multiple eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNAs, especially in
control regions such as promoters [55] and origins of replication [56]. In minicircles from many kinetoplastids, T.
cruzi being an exception, bends are located adjacent to
conserved sequence blocks that are likely binding sites for
kinetoplast replication proteins [57]. The bent region may
serve a topological function for packing of the minicircles
into the characteristic disc structure [58]. Maxicircles in T.
equiperdum are concatenated in a network independent of
minicircles, linked together at a protease-resistant core
[59]. The bent nature of the repetitive region may form a

solenoid structure that intertwines the maxicircles within
this central core.
An intriguing conserved sequence element of ~300 bp is
present in equivalent positions of the variable region of
the T. cruzi CL Brener and Esmeraldo strains. A 39-bp
imperfect palindrome within this element may serve as a
specific recognition sequence for DNA binding proteins.
Palindromes may serve as binding sites for dimeric or
multimeric proteins at promoter regions and replication
origins. Origins of replication have been mapped to the
non-coding region of T. brucei and C. fasciculata [49]. The
T. brucei origin lies in the variable region just upstream of
the 12S rRNA; two conserved 600-bp tandem repeats were
found in the T. brucei maxicircle assembly [41,50]. The T.
cruzi and T. brucei elements show no conservation at the
sequence level, however the position and tandem arrangements suggest a common function. In mammalian mitochondria transcription initiation and DNA replication
begin at the same site just upstream of the rRNA genes
[51]. In T. brucei the 12S rRNA primary transcript initiates
approximately 1.2 kb upstream of the gene [52], in the
same region as the origin of replication. This variable
region element may have a dual function as both replication origin and promoter.
Experimentally-generated hybrids in T. brucei indicate that
inheritance of maxicircle sequences is uniparental, while
minicircle inheritance is biparental [60]. In vitro crosses of
differentially-tagged T. cruzi strains also displayed uniparental maxicircle inheritance [41]. Sequencing of a 1.5-kb
region of the maxicircle from 45 T. cruzi strains covering
COII and ND1 identified three clades encompassing the
six defined DTUs [40]. Esmeraldo falls into clade C (DTU
IIb), while CL Brener represents clade B (DTU IIa, IIc, IId,
and IIe). The same pattern of three clades was observed in
phylogenetic analysis of CYb [38]. Superimposing the
maxicircle clades onto our minimalist reconstruction of T.
cruzi hybridization events [25] (Figure 7), clade B likely
evolved from a clade A (DTU I) maxicircle inherited in the
common ancestor of DTU IIa/IIc strains following the
prior DTU I/DTU IIb hybridization. The clade B maxicircle was then passed on to the DTU IId/IIe hybrids from
their DTU IIc-type ancestor [38]. Bootstrap values from
phylogenetic analysis of both COII-ND1 and CYb demonstrate the closer association of clade B with clade A than
clade C, supporting the uniparental inheritance of DTU
IIa/IIc hybrids maxicircles from a DTU I-like strain. Analysis of a DTU I maxicircle should confirm the original
donor of the clade B maxicircle.
The mixing of parental minicircles observed in T. brucei
hybrids [60] may be a method of ensuring preservation of
the specific templates for RNA editing that are carried in
the gRNA genes, countering loss of gRNAs through ran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/60

dom segregation of the minicircles to daughter cells [61].
gRNAs from different strains might bear little resemblance
to one-another at the sequence level, but their ability to
direct the editing process may be indistinguishable relative to the mRNA. The physical mixing of the maxicircles
during the fusion process may be inhibited by the structural organization of this relatively large molecule within
the minicircle-clogged network. With the identification of
multiple specific markers in the maxicircles of different
strains, recombination or exchange during cellular fusion
events may be detected. The spatial arrangement of the
maxicircle within the kDNA network is not known, and
the maxicircle genomes allow the design of specific probes
to determine their organization within the kDNA disc.
Edited genes consistently show a lower percent identity
than non-edited genes among the genera. This difference
is minor between CL Brener and Esmeraldo, but increases
in comparisons between the Trypanosoma species, and is
greater still between the Trypanosoma spp. and L. tarentolae
(Table 2). Editing thus corrects for genomic variability in
the number and distribution of thymidine residues,
allowing protein sequence conservation despite highly
diverged genomic sequences. The ND7, COIII, and
ATPase6 transcripts are extensively edited in T. brucei and
T. cruzi, but only require 5' editing in L. tarentolae [48].
ND8, ND9, ND3, CR3, CR4, and RPS12 are extensively
edited in all three species but the pre-edited genes are
shorter in T. brucei and T. cruzi than in L. tarentolae. As
such Trypanosoma spp. maintain a smaller maxicircle coding region, but require more gRNA information than
Leishmania. Trypanosoma branches early in the evolution
of trypanosomatids, before the Leishmania clade [62], and
in accordance with this evolutionary schema the greater
number of extensively-edited genes in the Trypanosoma
may more closely resemble the ancestral state of the
Trypanosomatina. The loss of extensive RNA editing seen
in Leishmania would represent a derived state [48,57].
The pressure to maintain extensive amounts of RNA editing might be revealed by the consequences of the process.
The size of the primary gene template encoded in the maxicircle is radically minimized, with up to half of a gene's
coding information stored in gRNAs whose function is
largely unaffected by transition mutations. Insertions and
deletions of thymidines in the edited gene coding regions
are also tolerated due to their subsequent reshuffling during RNA editing. RNA editing can compensate for certain
DNA mutations and allow for production of wild-type
functional proteins. RNA editing is likely to have evolved
in a free-living ancestor of trypanosomatids that migrated
between aerobic and anaerobic environments [63]. Thus
protein functionality may be maintained despite mutation over many generations in the absence of selection,
while the cells live in an environment that relieves them

Postulated inheritance of maxicircle genomes superimposed upon the two hybridization events in T. cruzi. The
maxicircle clades defined by Machado and Ayala [31] are overlaid on the schema of the evolutionary history [23] of T. cruzi subgroups. In agreement with the phylogenetic comparisons among the three clades, the maxicircle donor in the first hybridization
event between the DTU I (clade A, yellow) and DTU IIb (clade C, orange) strains was the DTU I parent. Open circles and dotted lines represent maxicircle inheritance. Over time, the maxicircle in the new hybrid line accumulated a unique set of mutations distinguishing them from the DTU I parental maxicircle, designated clade B (green), as seen in sibling DTUs IIa and IIc. In
the second hybridization event between strains from DTU IIc and DTU IIb, the clade B maxicircle was passed on to the progeny represented by DTUs IId and IIe. The sequences assembled for this manuscript represent maxicircles from clades B (CL
Brener) and C (Esmeraldo).

of the necessity to perform oxidative phosphorylation or
other aerobic mitochondrial activities.
The T. cruzi strain-specific indels of Esmeraldo and CL
Brener in gene coding regions not edited in T. brucei may
represent mutations that are tolerated in a cultured strain,
but prohibitive to completion of the digenic lifecycle, as is
seen in the degenerate UC strain of L. tarentolae [44]. In
short, they could represent laboratory-generated deadends. However, these mutations may give insight into
evolution of the RNA editing process. The strong uridine
bias evident in the non-edited genes suggests that all of
the genes were at one time subject to extensive RNA editing. The persistence of 5'-end editing supports the theory
that reverse transcriptase mediated recombination of partially edited intermediates eliminated the need for wholeORF editing in several instances. Perhaps residual gRNAs
for non-edited genes are maintained in the heterogeneous
minicircle population due to the structure of the minicircles themselves in T. cruzi and T. brucei. While in L. tarentolae a single gRNA is contained on each minicircle, the
Trypanosoma minicircles carry two to four genes. If maxicircle genes are under pressure to 'escape' from editing,
the single-gRNA minicircles of Leishmania are more easily
lost from the population than a gRNA in the triplet or
quartet minicircle arrangements of Trypanosoma [64],
effectively pushing Leishmania toward a more rapid loss of
editing information. As such, the Trypanosoma spp. may
carry an extra load in the form of gRNAs for genes that no
longer require editing, but that could be utilized in the
repair of indel mutations in normally unedited gene
regions as a post-transcriptional proofreading mechanism. With the further characterization of the minicircle
populations and RNA editing events of the CL Brener and
Esmeraldo strains, these possibilities can be addressed
directly.

Conclusion
The complete assembly of two T. cruzi maxicircle genomes
was performed using data generated by genome sequencing projects for the CL Brener and Esmeraldo strains.
These sequences represent two of the three maxicircle
mitochondrial genome clades of T. cruzi. The coding
region of both maxicircles shows conservation of gene
content and order with other kinetoplastids, with similar
editing patterns conserved within the Trypanosoma. Strainspecific indels may indicate unique editing events or nonfunctional genes. The non-coding regions share duplicated, conserved elements of approximately 325 bp situated upstream of the ribosomal RNA genes that may serve
as origins of replication and transcription initiation sites.
Repetitive portions of the non-coding region are distinct
for each strain, but display similarly poly-A rich sequences
that may induce DNA bending and serve a structural function.

Methods
The strategy employed in the construction of CL Brener
and Esmeraldo maxicircles comprised the gathering and
assembly of reads generated by the TIGR-SBRI-KI T. cruzi
Sequencing Consortium (TSK-TSC) [42] with high identity as determined by BLAST to previously published maxicircle sequences: 5.7 Kb fragment of T. cruzi maxicircle,
[GenBank:U43567], T. brucei maxicircle, [GenBank:M94286] and L. tarentolae maxicircle [GenBank:M10126]. Various assembly software packages were
used in the assembly with equivalent results: Celera
Assembler [65], Phrap [66] and SeqMan (Lazergene,
DNAStar). All assembly software was executed using the
default parameters. Additionally, any contigs generated by
the T. cruzi genome consortium and having high identity
to maxicircle sequences mentioned above were merged
together. Other contigs were iteratively added to this initial sequence based on sequence identity and mate pair
linkage. The iteration was finished when the generated
sequence had similar patterns on its both ends, as evidence that a circular sequence was obtained. The sequence
was dismantled and its contigs were submitted to scaffolding by Bambus software [67]. The final maxicircle
sequence was obtained by manual overlapping and concatenation of Bambus scaffolds. Both strategies generated
identical results for the coding region sequence, but only
the latter had produced a putative circular sequence. Consensus maxicircle sequences for T. cruzi strains CL Brener
and Esmeraldo are available through [GenBank:DQ343645 and GenBank:DQ343646], respectively.
Manual annotation of gene coding regions was performed
by comparison to the published T. brucei maxicircle
sequence, [GenBank:M94286]; the L. tarentolae maxicircle
sequence, [GenBank:M10126]; T. brucei maxicircle variable region, [GenBank:Z15118]; and further annotation of
T. brucei and L. tarentolae by Larry Simpson available
through his Uridine-Insertion/Deletion Edited Sequence
Database [12].
Linear annotated maps of the maxicircle sequence and TA
skew, GC skew and GC percentage graphs of the coding
region were created using Artemis [68]. Circular maps
were generated using Bioedit [69]. Dotplot graphs of T.
cruzi sequence plotted against T. brucei and L. tarentolae
showing exact matches of 10-bp wordsize were generated
by Dottup application from the EMBOSS software suite
[70]. Dotplot graphs of CL Brener and Esmeraldo maxicircle variable regions plotted against themselves and each
other were generated using the Dotter software package
[71]. The Dotter software package uses greyscale to display
less perfect matches as lighter shaded dots, and also displays matches to the reverse complement.

Alignments of the coding regions of the maxicircle genes
and translated protein products of T. cruzi, T. brucei, and
L. tarentolae were performed using ClustalX. Alignments
were adjusted manually using BioEdit [69]. BioEdit was
used to calculate nucleotide composition and percent
identity matrices.

MEME/MAST software [72] was used to define and locate
motifs within the repetitive region of the maxicircles. Multiple occurrences of each motif were aligned and submitted to Weblogo [73]. This software generates a graphical
representation of multiple alignments where the character
height represents the degree of conservation of each monomer.
