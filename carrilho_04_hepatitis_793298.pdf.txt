Abstract
Background: Patients under haemodialysis are considered at high risk to acquire hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection. Since few data are reported from Brazil, our aim was to assess the frequency and risk factors for HBV
infection in haemodialysis patients from 22 Dialysis Centres from Santa Catarina State, south of Brazil.
Methods: This study includes 813 patients, 149 haemodialysis workers and 772 healthy controls matched by sex
and age. Serum samples were assayed for HBV markers and viraemia was detected by nested PCR. HBV was
genotyped by partial S gene sequencing. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses with stepwise logistic
regression analysis were carried out to analyse the relationship between HBV infection and the characteristics of
patients and their Dialysis Units.
Results: Frequency of HBV infection was 10.0%, 2.7% and 2.7% among patients, haemodialysis workers and
controls, respectively. Amidst patients, the most frequent HBV genotypes were A (30.6%), D (57.1%) and F
(12.2%). Univariate analysis showed association between HBV infection and total time in haemodialysis, type of
dialysis equipment, hygiene and sterilization of equipment, number of times reusing the dialysis lines and filters,
number of patients per care-worker and current HCV infection. The logistic regression model showed that total
time in haemodialysis, number of times of reusing the dialysis lines and filters, and number of patients per worker
were significantly related to HBV infection.
Conclusions: Frequency of HBV infection among haemodialysis patients at Santa Catarina state is very high. The
most frequent HBV genotypes were A, D and F. The risk for a patient to become HBV positive increase 1.47
times each month of haemodialysis; 1.96 times if the dialysis unit reuses the lines and filters ≥ 10 times compared
with haemodialysis units which reuse < 10 times; 3.42 times if the number of patients per worker is more than
five. Sequence similarity among the HBV S gene from isolates of different patients pointed out to nosocomial
transmission.

Background
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) can be detected in blood and
derivatives as well as in saliva, semen, vaginal secretion
and exudates from cutaneous ulcer. HBV contamination is
mainly established during the first year of life in highly
endemic areas (Asia, Africa and East Amazonia), while in
low epidemic areas the most important infection is found
among young adults belonging to risk groups (health
workers, haemodialysis patients, haemophiliacs, homosexuals, prostitutes, drug abusers, Hansen's disease
patients, imunosuppressed patients and contacts with
HBV infected patients) [1].
During the 70's, HBV infection was recognized as a great
risk to haemodialysis patients [2], as HBV infection prevalence overcame 50% in some centres [3]. Some of the factors associated with HBV propagation include blood and
derivates transfusion, duration and frequency of haemodialysis, equipment contamination and contact among
patients as well among them and health-care workers [4].
Since that time, HBV incidence in haemodialysis patients
has been dramatically decreased especially by selection of
blood donors, HBsAg positive patients isolation during
dialysis and routine vaccination of uraemic patients. In
Brazil, HBV infection in haemodialysis centres varies from
7.5 to 28.0 % [1].
HBV is as ubiquitous as man and it is found in all inhabited region of the globe [5]. HBsAg heterogeneity is well
established. Serological methods developed to distinguish
HBsAg antigenic subtypes allowed its classification in
nine different subtypes with variable frequencies in different countries [6].
Divergences of the complete genome sequence inside the
same subtype is approximately 8%, similar to those found
in different subtypes. Therefore, subtypes do not reflect a
real genotypic variation and another classification was
proposed based on the nucleotide sequence of the S gene
[7]. Primarily, four genotypes were described – A, B, C and
D – followed by two others, E and F, corresponding to
subtypes ayw4 and adw4, respectively [8,9]. Recently, two
more genotypes were found: G, in North America and
Europe [10] and H, in North and Central America [11].
Nucleotide sequence comparisons of HBV genome have
been used to study the HBV routes of infection, like vertical or blood and derivatives accidental inoculation [12].
In our country, the viral genetic diversity of HBV has
already been demonstrated [13], but the present study is
the first to investigate the routes of transmission through
HBV sequencing analysis.
The aims of this study were (i) to analyse the frequency of
HBV serological markers (total anti-HBc, HBsAg and anti-

HBs) in haemodialysis patients, (ii) to analyse HBV DNA
frequency in HBsAg positive patients submitted to
haemodialysis, (iii) to characterize predictive factors to
HBV infection in patients submitted to haemodialysis,
and (iv) to study the epidemiology of HBV infection
through molecular analysis of partial gene S sequence.

Methods
Data collection
From each patient, the following data were collected:
name, age, gender, race, time in haemodialysis, change of
dialysis units, number of haemodialysis sessions per
week, number of times of equipment reuse, type of dialysis equipment and dialysis solution. Also, the dates of the
first haemodialysis and the first haemodialysis session in
the unit were recorded. A variable designated PSU (Patient
always in the Same Unit) was created to distinguish
patients coming from different dialysis units.

From each studied health care worker, data collected
included current working unit, age, gender, professional
assignment and labour time.
From each dialysis unit, the following data were collected:
(i) type of dialysis equipment (proportional system, central system and tank), (ii) whether rooms were separated
for patients with hepatitis B and/or C or temporal separation at the end of each day, (iii) whether separated types
of reprocessing rooms for patients with hepatitis B and/or
C were applied, (iv) frequency of disinfections of dialysis
equipments with sodium hypochlorite (between shifts or
by the end of the day), (v) and frequency of sterilization
with formaldehyde or peracetic acid (daily, weekly or
never).
Population
All the 813 patients and 149 (51.1%) out of 291 healthcare workers from all the 22 dialysis units at Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil, were studied. Data and blood
samples were prospectively collected between October 22,
1996 and December 03, 1997. As control group, 772
healthy adults – matched by sex and age (± 3 years) – were
recruited from the same regions.

The studied population features were: age ranging from
14 to 86 years (47.1 ± 15.3); 349 (42.9%) females and
464 (57.1%) males; 764 (94.0%) whites, 25 (3.1%)
mulattoes and 24 (3.0%) blacks. The 291 health-care
workers studied included medical doctors (61), nurses
(31), dialysis technicians and attendants (169) and cleaning professionals (30). All patients were submitted to four
hours haemodialysis sessions three times a week using
disposable needles to veno – arterial puncture and reuse
of dialysis lines and equipments.

Some patients have been previously treated by peritoneal
dialysis (30/813 – 3.7%), outpatient continuous peritoneal dialysis (14/813 – 1.7%) and renal transplantation
(47/813 – 5.8%). Most (528/813 – 65.9%) of the patients
have been previously submitted to blood transfusions:
342 (42.0%), 111 (13.7%) and 75 (9.2%) received one to
five, six to ten and more than ten blood units, respectively.
Previous serological data obtained from the dialysis units
reported 58 (7.2%) and 246 (30.3%) out of 813 patients
as HBsAg and anti-HCV positive, respectively.
The present study involved all the major dialysis units at
Santa Catarina state. These units were geographically
divided in: North state, units A, B, C and D; Itajaí River
region, units E, H, I, R, O, P, Q, X; South state, units J, K,
L, M and S; Mountain area, units F and G; and West state,
units T, U and V.
Use of the different types of dialysis equipments
Among the 813 patients, proportional system, central system and tanks equipments corresponded to 161 (19.8%),
535 (65.8%) and 117 (14.4%), respectively, were used. In
relation to the dialysis solution, 716 (88.1%) and 97
(11.9%) patients utilized bicarbonate and acetate,
respectively.
Types of dialysis room
(i) W (white), for 268 (33%) HBsAg and anti-HCV negative patients, (ii) W/C: for 334 (41.0%) patients without
HBsAg but occasionally anti-HCV positive; (iii) B: for
HBsAg positive and anti-HCV negative 32 (3.9%)
patients; (iv) C: for 117 (14.4%) HBsAg negative and antiHCV positive patients; (v) B/C: for 62 (7.6%) HBsAg and/
or anti-HCV positive patients.
Periodical disinfections
Frequency of disinfection of dialysis equipments was
between each dialysis period for 267 (32.8%) patients
and at the end of the day for 546 (67.2%) patients. No
other sterilizing procedure was applied in equipments utilized by 303 (37.3%) patients, while 154 (18.9%) and
356 (43.8%) patients utilized equipments sterilized with
4% formaldehyde or peracetic acid daily or weekly,
respectively.
Reuse of lines and dialysis equipments
(i) for HBsAg and anti-HCV negative patients (190 –
23.3%); (ii) for HBsAg positive patients (31 – 3.8%); (iii)
for anti-HCV positive patients (102 – 12.5%); (iv) for
HBsAg and/or anti-HCV positive patients (49 – 6.0%);
and (v) for patients without HBsAg positive (441 –
54.2%).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/4/13

Number of lines and dialysis equipments reuse
Less than 10 times for 369 (45.4%) patients, and between
10 and 20 times for 444 (54.5%) patients.
Samples
Blood samples were collected through venopuncture in
dry tubes (9.5 ml) with vacuum. After clot retraction, samples were centrifuged at 1500 to 2000 rpm and stored in 1
mL aliquots at -20°C.
Serological reactions
Serological markers of hepatitis B virus were detected by
ELISA using commercially available kits (Murex Biotech
Ltd, United Kingdom): total anti-HBc (ICE* HBc Detection Pack), HBsAg (Murex HBsAg) and anti-HBs (Murex
anti-HBs).

All samples were tested for anti-HBc and the positive ones
were also tested for HBsAg. Finally, anti-HBs was tested in
the HBsAg negative samples.
All samples were also investigated for contact with hepatitis C virus (HCV); samples repeatedly reactive to anti-HCV
ELISA test (INNOTEST HCV Ab III® Innogenetics, Belgium) were further submitted to a confirmatory third generation immunoblot test (IB-III, INNO-LIA HCV Ab III® –
Innogenetics, Belgium).
Polymerase chain reactions (PCR)
HBV DNA was detected by PCR using specific primers covering the core (C) and surface (S) genes of the HBV
genome. In all HBsAg positive samples, extraction and
amplification of HBV-DNA were carried out by nested
PCR, as described by Kaneko et al. [14]. Samples with positive PCR result were further submitted to another PCR
reaction covering a fragment of 417 bp of the S gene as
developed by Sitnik et al., 1999 [15]. HCV RNA was
detected by a commercial RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer recommendations (INNO-LiPA HCVII PCR
amplification, Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium).
Sequencing reactions
PCR products covering the S gene were submitted to cycle
sequencing reactions, using the second round primers and
a method derived from Sanger et al. [16] with dideoxinucleotides (ddNTPs) labelled with fluorescent markers
(ABI PrismR BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit – Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA).
Genotyping
Genotype analysis was carried out through the comparison of the obtained sequences with sequences of the different HBV genotypes from the Genbank. For this

lished at 5%. All calculations were carried out using the
Statistical Analysis System (SAS) [21].

Phylogenetical analysis
Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using the MEGA version 2.1 program (17).
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL X version 1.81
(18) and then analyzed by the Neighbor-joining method
using a distance matrix calculated according to the
Kimura-2-parameter model (19) and gamma distribution.

Results
The results of HBV serological and molecular markers in
haemodialysis patients and health-care workers and their
respective controls are shown in Table 1.

Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, HBsAg and anti-HBc positive cases
were considered as HBV carriers, while concomitant antiHBc and anti-HBs positive and HBsAg negative results
were appointed as previous HBV infection.

Anti-HCV was detected in 276 (33.9%) out of 813
patients. Among these 276 patients, immunoblot confirmatory test was positive in 271 (98.2%) and inconclusive in five (1.8%). Among the latter, HCV RNA was
detected by PCR in 171 (61.9%) patients. HCV infected
cases were considered those with positive ELISA and at
least another positive test (immunoblot and/or PCR);
Table 2 shows the positive cases meeting these criteria.

All variables were descriptively analysed for patients,
health-care workers and healthy controls using frequency
and percentage for qualitative variables or, for quantitative variables, maximum, minimum, median, mean and
standard deviation values.

Patient variables according to the presence (HBsAg and
anti-HBc positive) or absence of HBV infection are shown
in Table 3. Statistical significant differences were found for
haemodialysis total time (p = 0.0002) and anti-HCV
detection (p < 0.0001).

For univariate analysis, Student's t and χ2 tests were used
to compare means and distributions among different
groups. For multivariate analysis, a statistical logistic
regression with stepwise method of variables selection
was used to evaluate the significance of the variables
obtained from the univariate analysis to predict HBV
infection [20]. Through this procedure, it was possible to
evaluate the contribution of each variable in diagnosis
probability of HBV infection. Significance level was estab-

The relation between characteristics of haemodialysis
units and HBV infection is shown in Table 4. Statistical
significant differences were found for the type of dialysis
equipment (p = 0.0071), frequency of disinfection with
sodium hypochlorite (p = 0.0002), frequency of sterilization with 4% formaldehyde or peracetic acid (p = 0.0043),
dialysis units rooms (p < 0.0001), type of reuse of lines
and dialysis equipments (p = 0.0009) and patients/HCW
ratio (p < 0.0001).

Stepwise logistic regression analysis
Seven independent variables were submitted to a multivariate analysis by a logistic regression model [20] with
the purpose of determining the probability of HBV infection among Haemodialysis patients. Variables with statistical significant results are shown in Table 5.

It was observed that total time in haemodialysis, number
of reuse of lines and dialysis equipments and the patient/
employee relation adjusted a probabilistic model that
allows predicting HBV infection among patients with
60.5% sensitivity, 71.2% specificity and 70.1 percentage
of correctly classified patients.
Consequently, the probability of a haemodialysis patient
to have a HBV infection is given by:

P=

 exp ( −4, 5952 + 0, 3963 x T + 0,6731 x R + 1, 2297 x P ) 


 1 + exp ( −4, 5952 + 0, 3963 x T + 0,6731 x R + 1, 2297 x P ) 
,



– where, T = time on haemodialysis; R = Reuse number of
lines and dialysis equipments; and P = Patients / Healthcare workers proportion.

The following data could be drawn from the above equation: (i) the chance of HBV infection increases 1.47 times
monthly whilst the patient is submitted to haemodialysis;
(ii) the chance of HBV infection in a patient that is submitted to haemodialysis in a unit where the number of
reuse of lines and dialysis equipments is > 10 times multiplies by 1.96 the chance of a patient that goes to a unit
where the reuse is inferior to 10 times; (iii) the chance of
HBV infection in a patient that is submitted to haemodialysis in units where the patient/employee ratio is higher
than five is 3.42 times the chance of a patient that goes to
a unit where this proportion is lower than five.
HBV genotypes
The frequency of HBV genotypes in haemodialysis
patients and their controls is shown in Table 6. Genotype
D was the most frequent in both groups, but genotypes A
and F were found exclusively in haemodialysis patients.

HBV genotypes frequency in health-care workers and their
controls at haemodialysis units is shown in Table 7. Genotype A was the most prevalent among health-care workers. All controls were infected with genotype D.

HBV phylogenetic tree
The phylogenetic tree drawn from the analysis with the
HBV S-gene sequences (PCR-positive samples) shows that
the branches of the different genotypes are clearly individualised (Figure 1).

Genotype A was found in haemodialysis groups from
units H (Itajaí River region), K, M and S (South region).
All cases were clustered in the same branch of the tree with
a 100 bootstrap value. Genotype D was found in haemodialysis groups from units A, B, D, (North region), J, K
(South region), O, R, (Itajaí River region), T, U and V
(West region). Most of the cases were clustered in the
same tree branch with a bootstrap value of 88. The two
cases from unit J clustered in the same branch (bootstrap
value = 98). Genotype F was found only in units F (Mountain region) and V (West state). All cases clustered in the
same branch with a 79 bootstrap value. The sequences
from the control population, being all genotype D, were
scattered through different branches of the tree.

Discussion
Many studies on HBV infection in dialysis units have been
published; nonetheless the landmark of the present investigation is the inclusion of all patients from all dialysis
units of the Santa Catarina State.
All of the 813 patients of the 22 dialysis units have
accepted to enrol on this study, allowing us to investigate
100% of the patients that received assistance at that time
in the state of Santa Catarina. Besides, 51.1% of the
health-care workers from the dialysis units and, as controls, 772 healthy workers matched by sex and age (± 3
years) from companies in the same area have volunteered
to take part.
The 22 dialysis units were heterogeneous when comparing the use of disposable needle for artery-vein fistula,
number of reuse of lines and dialysis equipments, type of
dialysis machine, machine hygiene, machine sterilisation,
type of dialysis rooms regarding infected patients, lines
and dialysis equipments reprocessing rooms and the

patients/care workers ratio. In fact, after literature review,
no related reference was found with such a large coverage.
The ideal human resources for dialysis units established
by decree (number 2,042) from the Brazilian Ministry of
Health's [23] define one technician or attendant per four
patients. The reality disclosed by this study was quite different, though; the lack of qualified personnel and, sometimes, under qualified care workers was the main cause for
the low human resource/patient ratio found at Santa Catarina State. Due to this distortion, this variable was
adapted by taking into consideration the total number of
technicians, auxiliaries and nursery attendants per
attended patients.
As determined by a third-generation ELISA method in a
previous work with hepatitis C virus [22], anti-HCV was
found in 33.9% (276/813) of the present patient population, and confirmed by immunoblot in 98.2% (271
patients). Polymerase chain reaction for the 271 immunoblot-positives and five inconclusive results was positive in
171 (62%) patients. Anti-HCV serological marker was
detected in 44 of the 813 patients infected by HBV, representing 5.4% of HBV + HCV co-infection.
In this study, the definition of present or past HBV infection was based on total anti-HBc reactivity. In our casuistic, anti-HBc was positive in 32.2% of the patients, 10.0%
with HBsAg and 15.4% with anti-HBs. Such high frequency of HBsAg positive was observed in several investigations, not only in Brazil, but also in other countries.
Hepatitis B serology was positive in 72.7% of the haemodialysis patients in Saudi Arabia – a hyperendemic area –
, of which 10.9% was HBsAg positive [24]. On the other
hand, HBsAg frequency was 1.6% and anti-HBc 36.7%, in
non-hyperendemic areas in Japan [25]. In Brazil, the
reported HBV-infection frequency varied from 14.1% in
Porto Alegre city [26], 7.8 to 28.0% in São Paulo city [2731], 12.0% in Goiania city [32] and up to 20.0% in Salvador city [33].
In a three-year prospective study carried out in São Paulo,
the appearance of HBsAg in 17 patients submitted to

haemodialysis corresponded to 0.19 patients a year [34].
Seroconversion rates of 2% were similar to other dialysis
unit in São Paulo during a six-month study [30].
HBV genotyping use as an epidemic marker allowed the
demonstration that the infection was introduced by
chronic patients and disseminated in a haemodialysis
unit, probably due to equipment contamination and the
unit environment [4].
In relation to the health-care workers and controls, HBsAg
prevalence varied between 2.7% and 3.8%, lower than the
one observed in haemodialysis patients. A similar HBsAg
figure (2.9%) was observed in hospital workers in other
Brazilian regions [35]. HBsAg frequency in health-care
workers in the USA was 1.0%, thus lower than the
observed in our country [36].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/4/13

ing to the group of dialysis rooms, (iv) number of reuse of
lines and dialysis equipments and (v) patients distribution according to the number of health-care workers
(technicians, auxiliary and nursery attendants).
Reuse of dialysis equipments was initially proposed to
reduce costs [48], as guidelines supporting this practice
claimed no increase in HBV infection [49]. On the other
hand, a previous case-control study had shown the importance of poor function of dialysis machines due primarily
to rupture of dialysis membranes [50].
As observed by univariate analysis, HBV infection and the
following variables were statistically significant: haemodialysis total time, machine hygiene frequency, machine
sterilization frequency, number of reuse of lines and dialysis equipments, number of patients per number of
health-care workers and HCV infection.

HBV-DNA was detected by PCR in 62 (7.6%) of the 813
patients and in 76.5% of the 81 positive HBsAg patients,
confirming the high viral replication frequency in these
patients. This figure was similar to the one observed by
other authors in haemodialysis populations in Goiania
city, in which the PCR-positive frequency was between
67.6% and 88.2% of the HBsAg positive patients [32]. The
observations above show that HBV infection continues to
be an important problem in Brazilian haemodialysis
units.

The multivariate analysis (stepwise-logistic regression)
selected the variables haemodialysis total time, number of
reuse of lines and dialysis equipments and the proportion
patients per health-care workers. This analysis adjusted a
probabilistic model that allows predicting HBV infection
in the haemodialysis patients with 60.5% sensitivity,
71.2% specificity and 70.1% of correctly classified
patients.

Univariate analysis of age and sex has not shown significant differences for presence or absence of HBV infection.
Likewise, renal transplant background, number of blood
and/or derivates transfusions and patients always in the
same unit (PSU) were not significantly associated with
this infection.

Other investigators, by means of multivariate analysis,
observed an association of three variables only – haemodialysis duration, type of dialysis (haemodialysis or ACPD
– ambulatory continuous peritoneal dialysis) and blood
transfusion background – with HBV infection markers
[27,34]. These results contradict the present work, as no
relation between the number of blood/derivates transfusion and HBV infection was observed.

On the other hand, significant differences among patients
without HBV infection were observed with the following
variables: total haemodialysis time in months and antiHCV serological marker. Significant association between
HBV and anti-HCV markers was also observed in São
Paulo by other authors. It was reinforced the role of
haemodialysis duration, previous background of haemodialysis, renal transplant background and blood transfusions background [27,34].
The presence of total anti-HBc in patients' serum has been
associated to a higher prevalence of HCV infection, but
this is still controversial. Several authors found such relation [35-46], while others denied [46,47].
All variables related to dialysis units showed, by univariate analysis, significant differences for HBV infection;
those were (i) type of dialysis equipment, (ii) hygiene and
sterilization frequency, (iii) patients distribution accord-

So far, the importance of the variables related to dialysis
units and HBV infection has not been well emphasized in
literature. The present investigation emphasizes some
aspects of strong epidemiological importance: (i) the HBV
chance of infection increases 1.47 times a month in
haemodialysis patients; (ii) the chance of a haemodialysis
patient to become HBV infected in a unit that reuses lines
and dialysis equipments more than 10 times is 1.96 times
the chance of a patient in a unit that reuses the same material less than 10 times; and (iii) the chance of HBV infection in a patient that does haemodialysis in a unit in
which the patient/health-care worker ratio is higher than
5 is 3.42 times the chance of a patient that does so in units
with lower ratio values.
With the purpose of a better understanding of the HBV
spreading among haemodialysis patients, HBV genotyping and sequencing were applied. In 65 positive HBsAg,

the following frequency was found: genotype A – 28%,
genotype D – 57% and genotype F – 15%. Therefore, it
can be observed that genotypes B, C and E were not represented in the present study. As for genotypes B and C, frequently detected in patients from Southeast Asia, this
result was expected due to the absence of Japanese in the
studied patients. Likewise, genotype E – usually found in
African populations – was not detected. In this study, 94%
of the patients were white and only 3% black, but other
studies did not show any evidence of genotype E in Brazil
[15].

HBsAg patients; (iii) predictive HBV infection factors
included haemodialysis total time, number of reuse of
lines and dialysis equipments and patients/health-care
workers ratio; (iv) HBV genotypes found in these patients
were A, D and F, with A and D predominance; (v) HBV
DNA sequencing revealed 100% similarity in isolates
from different patients, bounding them to a common and
nosocomial source of infection; and (vi) the need for strict
observance of the rules for correct technical functioning
with qualified personnel and service surveillance.

Competing interests
Due to the high miscegenation in Brazil and lack of data,
the present study points out the need of similar epidemiological researches in other dialysis units with more
heterogeneous populations for a comprehensive and significant genotype characterisation. Genotype F was found
at a low frequency in 10/65 (15.4%) and 6/84 (7.1%),
respectively to haemodialysis and chronic hepatitis
patients [15].
It is worth noting that the HBV DNA-sequencing disclosed
100% similarity among isolates of various genotypes from
17 patients belonging to different dialysis units. This similarity found in a same unit strongly suggests contamination by the same viral strain and, consequently,
nosocomial transmission. These findings represent
important advances in HBV epidemiology and similar
studies, from other regions of Brazil, are awaited.
Despite the knowledge of the risk factors related to
haemodialysis, the high frequency of HBV infection
observed in our dialysis environment shows that these
units represent a closed system for this viral transmission.

None declared.

Many governmental and institutional recommendations
have been set to reduce HBV dissemination in haemodialysis patients. Unfortunately, those recommendations
have not been followed by all units, as shown by HBV
infection surveys [51] and the appearance of recent infection outbreaks [52].
The present investigation enabled us to suggest more rigorous measures to be adopted: (i) maintenance of nationwide debates on the subject; (ii) active immunoprophylaxis in ureamic patients before their admission in dialysis
units; (iii) reduction on reuse of lines and dialysis equipments; and (iv) reduction in the number of patients per
health-care worker.

In face of the present results, it can be concluded that: (i)
HBV serological markers were highly frequent in haemodialysis patients as in comparison to health-care workers
and controls; (ii) HBV DNA was detected in most positive
