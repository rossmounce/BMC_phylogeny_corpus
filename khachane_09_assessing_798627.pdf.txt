Abstract
Background: Transcribed pseudogenes are copies of protein-coding genes that have accumulated
indicators of coding-sequence decay (such as frameshifts and premature stop codons), but
nonetheless remain transcribed. Recent experimental evidence indicates that transcribed
pseudogenes may regulate the expression of homologous genes, through antisense interference, or
generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Here, we assessed the genomic evidence for such
transcribed pseudogenes of potential functional importance, in the human genome. The most
obvious indicators of such functional importance are significant evidence of conservation and
selection pressure.
Results: A variety of pseudogene annotations from multiple sources were pooled and filtered to
obtain a subset of sequences that have significant mid-sequence disablements (frameshifts and
premature stop codons), and that have clear evidence of full-length mRNA transcription. We found
1750 such transcribed pseudogene annotations (TPAs) in the human genome (corresponding to
~11.5% of human pseudogene annotations). We checked for syntenic conservation of TPAs in
other mammals (rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, dog and cow). About half of the human TPAs are
conserved in rhesus monkey, but strikingly, very few in mouse (~3%). The TPAs conserved in
rhesus monkey show evidence of selection pressure (relative to surrounding intergenic DNA) on:
(i) their GC content, and (ii) their rate of nucleotide substitution. This is in spite of distributions of
Ka/Ks (ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates), congruent with a lack of
protein-coding ability. Furthermore, we have identified 68 human TPAs that are syntenically
conserved in at least two other mammals. Interestingly, we observe three TPA sequences
conserved in dog that have intermediate character (i.e., evidence of both protein-coding ability and
pseudogenicity), and discuss the implications of this.
Conclusion: Through evolutionary analysis, we have identified candidate sequences for functional
human transcribed pseudogenes, and have pinpointed 68 strong candidates for further investigation
as potentially functional transcribed pseudogenes across multiple mammal species.

Background
Pseudogenes (derived from protein-coding genes) are
gene copies that show signs diagnostic of protein-coding

deficiency. Such signs commonly include premature stop
codons and coding-sequence frameshifts, or neutral
codon substitution patterns [1,2]. Pseudogenes can arise

in two chief ways: (i) from retrotransposition, i.e., reverse
transcription of a cellular messenger RNA, followed by
reintegration into the genomic DNA [3-5], or (ii) from
decay of genes that originated (however long ago) from
duplication [1,6]. These genomic entities have generally
been believed to be non-functional. Historically, there
were some early individual reports of transcribed pseudogenes in the scientific literature [2,7,8]. Examples
included: human leukocyte interferon (LeIFN) pseudogene [9], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
pseudogene [10], glucocerebrosidase pseudogene [11],
steroid 21-hydrolase pseudogene [7], glutamine synthetase pseudogene [12], tumor repressor ΨPTEN [13].
More recently, genome-wide screens have detected transcription evidence for many retropseudogenes (>200) in
humans [14-17]. In mouse oocytes, transcribed pseudogenes have been shown to play a significant role in the
generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [18,19],
which regulate the expression of homologous genes.
Collectively, these reports indicate that an unknown
cohort of human transcribed pseudogenes could be
potentially functional in regulation of gene transcription.
A key indicator of such function is significant conservation in other mammalian genomes. Svensson et al. [20]
have explored conservation of apparent pseudogenes in
three mammals (human, chimpanzee and mouse). Their
analysis revealed 30 cases of transcribed pseudogenes that
are preserved in mouse. Here, we analyze the distribution
of transcribed pseudogene annotations (TPAs) in the
human and mouse genomes, examine their conservation
in an expanded panel of mammals (rhesus monkey,
mouse, rat, dog and cow), and assess evidence for significant selection pressures. TPAs that are conserved in rhesus
monkey show evidence of significant selection pressure,
despite also displaying codon substitution patterns characteristic of non-protein-coding sequences. Also, we have
discovered a short-list of 68 putative human transcribed
pseudogenes that are syntenically conserved in at least

two other mammals from our panel. These sequences represent a strong subset of candidates for further investigation as functional transcribed pseudogenes.

Results & Discussion
Derivation of transcribed pseudogene annotations (TPAs)
in the human genome
To identify transcribed pseudogenes, transcript sequences
from the Unigene, RefSeq and H-InvDB databases were
mapped onto the human genome and were examined for
overlap with pseudogene annotations. These pseudogene
annotations were taken from the VEGA http://
vega.sanger.ac.uk/ and http://pseudogene.org websites
(see Methods for details). We pooled these datasets with remappings of: (i) 'disrupted mRNAs' (dmRNAs) [16], and
(ii) transcribed processed pseudogenes [14], from previous analyses [14,16]. Overlap of the transcripts with pseudogenes was verified through using the positions of midsequence disablements (frameshifts and premature stop
codons) as 'anchors'. That is, at least one disablement
position was required to occur in both the genomic DNA
and the transcript sequence (see Methods for further
details).

We found that ~11.5% (1750/15000) of human pseudogenes are transcribed (after correcting for pseudogene
annotation overlaps within and between the various data
sets) [see Additional file 1]. Table 1 summarises the numbers of transcribed pseudogene annotations (TPAs) in different categories and data sets. The number of processed
pseudogenes that were identified to be transcribed is 3-4
times higher than in our previous analysis [14]. Interestingly, in humans, regardless of category, only a small fraction of TPAs are transcribed completely in the antisense
direction (~3-6%). Such a finding of significant avoidance
of antisense transcription (Table 1) is surprising, especially for retropseudogenes. Retrotransposed sequences
are inserted back into the genomic DNA irrespective of the
position of existing local promoters. Thus, one would
expect equal numbers of sense and antisense transcripts.

However, the above finding indicates a general selection
pressure against antisense transcribed pseudogenes, thus
generally limiting the possibilities for complementary
hybridization with transcripts and RNA elements from
homologous genes.

general, although approximately half (742/1750) of the
human TPAs are syntenically conserved in rhesus monkey, only 3% are syntenically conserved in mouse. This
suggests that a large number of human transcribed pseudogenes are primate-specific.

We performed a similar survey in the mouse genome for
TPAs. Surprisingly, in the mouse genome, we found a very
low percentage of TPAs, in comparison to the human
genome (<2%) (P << 0.001 for the likelihood of the
number in mouse, given the human percentage as an
expectation, using binomial statistics). This is despite
these two animals having similar amounts of pseudogene
annotation data (Table 1), and transcript data (203,785
transcript sequences in total for human, and 203,550 for
mouse). This indicates that transcribed pseudogenes are
rarer in mice than in humans.

A multiple sequence alignment of orthologous sequences
for an example taken from Additional file 2: Table S2, is
shown in Figure 1(a). The corresponding phylogenetic
tree is drawn in Figure 1(b). This example is a human
pseudogene named 'urn:lsid:pseudogene.org:9606.Pseudogene:4346', that is homologous to human ADP-ribose
pyrophosphatase. In this case, one can see clearly that disablements at several positions in the alignment are conserved in divergent species, and parsimoniously would be
assigned in the ancestral sequence. Also, in this phylogenetic tree, dog clusters closer to primates, than rodents do;
this may be due to variance in local genomic mutation
rates. Interestingly, we find that a significantly higher
number of human transcribed pseudogenes were conserved in dog, compared to in mouse (Fisher's exact test,
P-value: 0.0086) (Figure 2). There is some debate regarding whether human is phylogenetically closer to rodents
than to dog, although most data analysis indicates a
rodent-primate grouping [27-29].

Identification of orthologous pseudogenes in mammals
Transcription of pseudogenes per se does not necessarily
indicate functionality. It has been shown that transcriptional activation at a particular genomic locus has a ripple
effect on the neighboring loci [21]. It is therefore possible
that many transcribed pseudogenes arise simply because
of this. However, of the various identified human TPAs in
our present study, those that are evolutionarily conserved
across mammals due to natural selection are more likely
to be biologically functional. Therefore, we set out to
identify a list of such orthologous transcribed pseudogenes that have conserved in ≥2 of our panel of mammals.

Certain gene families are known to spawn large numbers
of pseudogenes. Examples include olfactory receptors
[22], ribosomal-protein genes [23], human thioredoxin
and glutaredoxin [24], ABC transporters [25], and heat
shock proteins [26]. In such cases, identifying orthologs in
other mammals using the standard bi-directional best-hit
procedure is problematic, since the rates of sequence evolution may vary in different lineages and genomic regions.
Furthermore, such a procedure does not work well for
pseudogenes, since these sequences are not evolving like
protein-coding genes, which are under strong purifying
selection. Because of this, the best match obtained using
blastp to a pseudogene query is expectedly the parent protein-coding gene or a pseudogene recently evolved from
the parent gene. Thus, the standard bi-directional best-hit
procedure alone is not sufficient. Therefore, here, we have
used synteny information between two organisms to pinpoint pseudogene orthologs. We have used synteny maps
along with homology-based searches to identify conserved orthologs in five mammals (rhesus monkey,
mouse, rat, dog and cow) (see Methods for details). We
identified a set of 68 human TPAs that are conserved in at
least two of these mammals, representing potentially
functional candidates (see Additional file 2: Table S1). In

Conserved transcribed pseudogenes are overrepresented
on chromosome X
It is noteworthy that the highest number of conserved
TPAs is on the human chromosome X (13 out of the total
of 68; Figure 3 and Additional file 2: Table S2), followed
by 11 cases on chromosome 6. There is also a significant
over-representation of human conserved TPAs on these
chromosomes after normalizing for the chromosome size
and dosage in gametes (χ2 test, d.f. = 1, P-value < 10-3).
Furthermore, it is chromosome X that is consistently and
most significantly overrepresented in the whole population of TPAs, and in the datasets of TPAs that are conserved in monkey and in mouse (calculations not shown).
This finding is in line with the observation that over the
course of evolution there has been some extensive gene
trafficking to/from the mammalian X chromosome [30].
Analysis of TPAs for selection to maintain them
Human TPAs from the VEGA data set, that have syntenically-conserved orthologs in rhesus monkey, were analyzed for significant selection pressure to maintain them.
This was assessed through comparison of the nucleotide
percentage sequence identity between orthologs, with the
highest nucleotide percentage sequence identity for the
immediately flanking genomic regions, as illustrated in
Figure 4. We chose the VEGA data set for this analysis,
since the genomic coordinates of this pseudogene annotation data set are more precisely annotated.

Our analysis indicated that TPA orthologs have higher
sequence homology in comparison to their syntenic
flanking regions. Average sequence identities among different syntenic regions in human and rhesus monkey are
as follows: 75.0% (s.d. 12.6%) in the 5' areas, 81.0% in
the 3' areas (s.d. 13.5%), and 86.7% (s.d. 9.6%) in the
TPA sequences. The difference in the sequence identities
between pseudogenes and the respective flanking regions
is statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test, Pvalue: < 5e-50). In the majority of cases (~86%, 293/341),
the percentage sequence identity between orthologous
TPA sequences is greater than that of the flanking regions.
This suggests that significant selection pressure exists to
maintain them. We note that similar analysis comparing

the human and chimpanzee genomes is not informative
because the species are too similar. Also, comparisons of
the human genome with the other mammals in our panel
are not informative either, because the appropriate
regions cannot be aligned accurately or significantly.
Conserved TPAs tend to be GC rich
We examined whether there existed any sequence feature
that distinguished conserved TPAs from the rest of the
human pseudogene population. A positive finding would
indicate that these pseudogenes are not evolving neutrally. It has been widely observed that genes tend to be
GC-rich in comparison to non-transcribed genomic segments [31]. Here, we examined whether TPAs and annotations of non-transcribed pseudogenes showed any
difference in the GC contents relative to their flanking
regions (GCdiff). Pseudogene populations from a variety
of organisms have been shown to relax to the composition of intergenic DNA over evolutionary time [32,33].
Here, the GC content of neutrally-evolving pseudogenes
would be expected to relax to that of the background
genomic GC content. Interestingly, GC content calculations revealed that 84% (327/391) of the human TPAs
derived from the VEGA pseudogene data set, that are conserved in rhesus monkey, have GC content greater than
their flanking regions (Table 2). This compares to 74%
(5289/7154) for the non-transcribed cases (Table 2). This
difference is statistically significant (χ2 test, d.f. = 1, Pvalue < 10-4). A similar result is obtained if we examine
the whole population of TPAs, or also if we just examine
transcription of conserved processed pseudogenes. There is
however no such significant differences for transcribed
pseudogenes of the 'nonprocessed' and 'unclassified'
pseudogene categories (Table 2). This shows that there is
a greater tendency for the conserved TPAs to be GC-rich
than for non-transcribed cases, and that this tendency
arises primarily because of transcription of processed
pseudogenes. This finding on GC content is further evidence that such transcribed pseudogenes are not evolving
neutrally. Such GC trends can be explained by selection
for transcriptional efficiency, as noted above [31].

We checked whether the age of pseudogenes could be
causing the GC content differences noticed above. To do
this, we looked at the GCdiff in the following (VEGA) subsets of TPAs, i.e.: (i) TPAs unique to humans; (ii) TPAs
conserved in rhesus monkey only; (iii) TPAs conserved in
more divergent mammals such as mouse, rat, dog and
cow. We found that 82.5% (381/462) of set (i) have GCdiff
> 0 (i.e., GC content of pseudogene greater than that of
the flanking region). Similar percentages were observed in
the other classes: 84.1% (317/377) in set (ii), and 77.78%
(21/27) in set (iii). There was no statistically significant
difference in the GCdiff between any two of the classes (χ2
test, P-value > 0.55), suggesting that age of pseudogenes

A scatter plot showing the number of conserved TPAs on each human chromosome versus the chromosome
size (in Mb). The chromosome X is circled. The collective size of the human genome, excluding chromosome X, is
3,098,124,053; and the size of the chromosome X after normalizing for chromosome dosage in gametes, as done by Emerson
et al. [30], is 116,185,316 (i.e., 0.75 times the original size of 154,913,754), which harbors 13 transcribed preserved pseudogenes. Since the collective genome size is 27 times bigger than that of the human chromosome X, we expect 2 or 3 preserved
pseudogenes on the chromosome X. Presence of 13 cases, an increase of more than 4.5 times than expected, suggests a statistically significant overrepresentation (exact binomial test of goodness-of-fit, P-value < 10-5, for the null hypothesis (H0) that
there is no difference between the observed and expected frequencies of transcribed preserved pseudogenes on the chromosome X).

does not have any influence on the observed GC content
differences.
Ka/Ks trends for TPAs that are conserved in rhesus monkey
We decided to assess the genomic evidence for a lack of
protein-coding ability in the human TPAs that are syntenically conserved in rhesus monkey. We compared TPA
characteristics to the characteristics of two other groupings: (i) known human protein-coding genes with
orthologs in rhesus monkey; (ii) populations of simulated sequences that are randomly mutating without coding-sequence selection pressures. The human TPA
sequences are used as starting sequences for these simulations. The protocol for these simulations is described in
'Methods: Ka/Ks ratio calculations'.

The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks) provides a measure of selection pressure
for protein-coding ability on nucleotide sequences. Classically, values significantly <<1.0 indicate purifying selection, whereas sequences without coding ability

theoretically yield values near 1.0. We examined the
trends for Ka/Ks in the population of human TPAs that are
conserved syntenically in the rhesus monkey. Ka/Ks was
calculated using the PAML package (as described in Methods). The distribution of Ka/Ks is shown for TPAs, split
into two groups, those that have a disrupted protein
domain of known three-dimensional structure (TPADD,
blue bar, Figure 5), and those that do not (TPANDD, red
bar, Figure 5).
In addition, we calculated the distribution of Ka/Ks values
for sequences that are randomly mutating without coding-sequence selection pressures. These sequences were
generated using the simulation protocol described in
'Methods: Ka/Ks ratio calculations', using the human TPAs as
starting sequences (green curve, Figure 5). The Ka/Ks distribution for these simulated sequences does not peak at
~1.0, as would be classically expected. This is likely due to
some inaccuracy in modeling the expected frequency for
the different possible nucleotide substitutions, which varies for different genomic areas [3]. The distribution for

A schematic representation of the procedure for identifying syntenic noncoding (flanking) regions. Flanking
regions (10000 nts) are scanned in a sliding window, equal to the length of conceptual human pseudogene transcript), by globally aligning it to the upstream/downstream regions of the human pseudogene. The best scoring window is identified, which
corresponds to the syntenic (flanking) region in the monkey genome.
TPADDs peaks in the range 0.6 to 1.0. This peak is similar
for the randomly-mutating sequences (Figure 5). For the
TPANDDs, the peak is at lower Ka/Ks values (0.4-0.6).
As a further comparison, we have calculated the Ka/Ks
curve for orthologous pairs of protein-coding genes from
the rhesus monkey and the human (blue curve, Figure 5).
Clearly, these protein-coding sequences behave very differently from the TPAs, with a substantial mode in the
range 0.0 to 0.2. In summary, these Ka/Ks trends indicate
that the substitution patterns in the TPAs generally behave
like non-protein-coding sequences, and not like proteincoding ones. This is despite the overall significant conservation relative to surrounding intergenic genomic DNA
that was discussed in the previous section.

Analysis of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
substitution rates (Ka/Ks) relative to orthologous TPAs in
dog and in mouse
To gain a more complete picture, we also examined Ka/Ks
values for TPAs that are conserved in two more divergent
species, the dog and the mouse. We compared Ka/Ks values for orthologous TPA pairs (termed Ka/KsΨ-ortho), with
the corresponding Ka/Ks values for their parent genes (Ka/
Ksparent-ortho) (Figure 6). These were calculated for human/
dog (Figure 6(a)), and human/mouse comparisons (Figure 6(b)). For human/dog comparisons, the substantial
majority (83%) have Ka/KsΨ-ortho > Ka/Ksparent-ortho, whereas
for human/mouse all of the pseudogene pairs have larger
Ka/Ks values than their corresponding parent pairs.

Figure 5
Distributions of Ka/Ks for TPADDs (blue bar), and TPANDDs (red bar)
Distributions of Ka/Ks for TPADDs (blue bar), and TPANDDs (red bar). Also shown are: the distribution of Ka/Ks for
simulated sequences that have randomly mutated without coding-sequence selection pressures (green curve; derived as
described in Methods), and the Ka/Ks distribution for orthologous pairs of known protein-coding genes from rhesus monkey
and human.

The Ka/Ks results suggest that these transcribed pseudogenes are relaxing to higher Ka/Ks values, since origination from their parents. But why do they not have Ka/Ks
values of ~1.0? We suggest that this is chiefly because: (i)
there may be some inaccuracy in modelling the expected
frequency for the different possible nucleotide substitutions, which varies for different genomic areas (as noted
in the previous section); (ii) in some cases, the transcribed
pseudogenes were originally protein-coding, and became
disabled subsequently in multiple lineages; (iii) some of
them maintain an imprint of the original coding sequence
because of selection pressure for regulation of homologous genes via antisense interference (e.g., through genesis
of siRNAs); (iv) selection pressures on non-synonymous
codon substitution rates in protein-coding genes, may
have relaxed in the pseudogenes, contributing to an
apparent relative increase in Ks; (v) it is also possible that
some of these sequences are currently protein-coding, and
have evolved through multiple coding-sequence disablements, as discussed previously [4].

To examine these data more closely, we calculated
whether the Ka/KsΨ-ortho values are significantly less than
would be expected for mutation without coding-sequence
selection pressures (using the simulational analysis
described in the Methods section). Several cases with such
significant values (that may indicate purifying selection
typical of protein-coding sequences), are observed (represented by circles in the Figure 6 plots). These Ka/Ks values
(that apparently indicate protein-coding ability) may arise
for the reasons listed in the preceding paragraph.
In addition, we examined whether the TPAs contain a protein domain of known three-dimensional structure, that is
disabled by a frameshift or a premature stop codon
(denoted 'TPADDs'; see Methods for details of annotation
of such domains). The TPADDs are indicated by unfilled
symbols in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 6. Interestingly, in
the human-dog comparisons, there are three cases of TPA
orthologous pairs that have such a disabled protein
domain, despite Ka/Ks values that indicate apparent puri-

fying selection. These sequences are thus of 'intermediate'
character, i.e., they have evidence of both protein-coding
ability and pseudogenicity.
Antisense homologies of human pseudogenes to other fulllength human cDNAs
Transcribed pseudogenes can regulate the expression of
other genes by RNA interference mechanisms. For example, antisense transcribed RNA from a NOS pseudogene
regulates the expression of neural nitric oxide synthase
(nNOS) protein through formation of RNA duplex
[34,35]. Therefore, we investigated how many of the TPAs
have antisense homology to the annotated full-length
human cDNAs (E-value < 1e-10 and alignment length > =
100 nucleotides). A small proportion (8.3%, 69/828) of
the human (VEGA) pseudogenic transcripts have either
complete or partial, but significant, reverse complement
(antisense) homology to human cDNAs. Of these, 63
have short length strong antisense homology to human
cDNAs (alignment length > = 20, mismatches < = 2).
However, there is no significant association of such antisense homologies to pseudogene transcription, since nontranscribed pseudogenes have similar levels of antisense
homology (7.65%, χ2 test P-value = 0.5).

Out of the identified 68 human conserved TPAs, 3 have
antisense homology to human cDNAs (E-value < 1e-10, 5
if alignment length > = 50 nucleotides is considered)
(Table 3). These are cases that may generate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that could potentially regulate the
expression levels of their homologous genes. Pseudogenes
have been implicated in the negative regulation of parental genes (for a review, see ref. [2]) and in the Dicer-mediated generation of small RNAs [18,19]. It would be
interesting to verify experimentally whether these pseudogene transcripts can indeed generate small interfering
RNAs, through the action of Dicer.
Small RNA mappings to pseudogenes
Transcribed pseudogenes can also regulate the transcription of genes by producing siRNAs that have antisense
homology [18,19]. Due to unavailability of genome-wide

human siRNA data, we used the siRNA data for the mouse
genome from Tam et al. [19] and Watanabe et al. [18] to
check how many of the small RNAs mapped to mouse
transcribed pseudogenes that we identified. Interestingly,
24 out of 136 (17.6%) mouse TPAs had siRNA mappings
compared to ~1% (178/18168) of the total mouse pseudogenes. The above difference is statistically significant
(P-value < 0.05, using normal statistics for the distribution of the mean number of transcribed pseudogenes in a
sample of 136 cases). This demonstrates that transcribed
pseudogenes are significantly likely to generate siRNAs in
mouse. For comparison, in Arabidopsis thaliana, ~40% of
572 pseudogenes have small RNA mappings [36].

Conclusion
In this study, we identified hundreds of cases of putative
transcribed pseudogene annotations (TPAs), in the
human genome. Importantly, we detected evidence for
selection pressure on these transcribed elements. These
findings therefore draw wider attention towards the
potential functionality of these genomic elements. In
addition, we found that 68 human TPAs are conserved in
at least 2 other studied mammals. These human TPAs
have ancient origins dating back >120 million years ago,
as evidenced by their conservation patterns across distantly related mammals. These pseudogenes represent
novel genomic elements of potential functional relevance.
We have shown that human TPAs that are syntenically
conserved in rhesus monkey generally behave like nonprotein-coding sequences, despite significant selection
pressure on them, relative to the surrounding genomic
DNA. Examination of Ka/Ks values for TPAs that are conserved in more divergent species (mouse and dog), indicated that some TPAs might actually be protein-coding.
However, we cannot rule out other reasons for these low
Ka/Ks values. For example, it is possible that some of these
sequences had phases of protein-coding ability at some
evolutionary stage. Also, it is possible that there is an
imprint of purifying selection on these sequences because
of selection pressure to form small interfering RNAs with
homologous protein-coding genes. Ultimately, these

questions can only be answered by detailed experimental
characterization of these molecules; our analysis here provides a rich data source for prioritizing likely candidates of
functional importance as transcribed pseudogenes.

Methods
1. Collection of data
Complete genome sequences of mammals were obtained
from http://www.ensembl.org (Ensembl release 47 for
human genome; Ensembl release 48 for other mammals,
namely, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, cow and dog). Pseudogene annotations for both processed and nonprocessed
categories, were obtained from [http://www.pseudog
ene.org; [37,38]] and for VEGA pseudogenes from http://
vega.sanger.ac.uk/, for disrupted mRNAs (dmRNAs) from
Harrison and Yu [16] and for other transcribed processed
pseudogenes from Harrison et al. [14]. The Blastx program
[39] was used to determine the parent protein coding
genes for VEGA pseudogenes (using E-value < 1e-09 as significance threshold), whereas for other datasets the annotations were readily available at the respective websites
mentioned above.
2. Screening for putative transcribed pseudogenes
Transcription data for human and mouse were taken from
RefSeq database [40], Unigene database at the NCBI http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, H-InvDB database http://
www.h-invitational.jp/ and Fantom3 database http://
fantom3.gsc.riken.jp/. To identify putative transcribed
pseudogenes, individual transcript sequences were
mapped onto the respective genomes using GMAP software [41] with match criteria of >99% sequence identity
and >99% sequence coverage. Transcript sequences that
mapped to pseudogenes were aligned to parent protein
sequences of respective pseudogenes to identify disablements such as frame shift or premature stop codon using
the 'GeneWise' program (Wise2 - version 2.1.20 package
downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute,
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/Wise2/index.html) [42]. The
disablement positions in pseudogenes and transcript
sequences were then used as 'anchors' to confirm the transcription of pseudogenes as in previous analyses
[14,15,43]. Additional data file (file 1) contains the list of
transcribed human pseudogenes. For a schematic representation of the annotation pipeline, see Figure. 7.
3. Identification of orthologous pseudogenes in various
sequenced mammalian genomes
Orthologous counterparts to a human pseudogene are
detected by the presence of a homologous sequence at the
syntenic position in the other mammalian genome. Based
on this criterion, a search was carried out within 100 kb
nucleotides distance of the exact syntenic coordinate
(because genes can shuffle locally) in the target mammal
as indicated in the synteny maps, to locate the ortholo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/435

gous pseudogenes. 'GeneWise' tool [42] was used, to align
the above-obtained genomic DNA sequence and the
human parental protein sequence, and to detect disablements in the alignment. The following mammals were
included in the analysis: monkey, mouse, rat, cow and
dog. The pair wise synteny map data for the various mammals were obtained from http://genome.ucsc.edu/.
4. Analysis for pseudogene sequence conservation
Flanking sequences 5' and 3' of human pseudogenes were
individually obtained, of length equal to the length of the
human pseudogene, and were each globally aligned using
'needle' module of EMBOSS package http://
www.ebi.ac.uk to the corresponding flanking region
sequences (10000 nucleotides 5' and 3') of monkey in a
sliding window of size also equal to the length of human
pseudogene. The window in which best identity score was
obtained was considered as the most optimum alignment
between the flanking regions, representing syntenic
regions. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for
assessing the statistical significance of the difference
between the degrees of homology calculated between two
orthologous pseudogenes and that between the respective
(orthologous) flanking regions. Cases with pair wise
sequence identities <40% were excluded.
5. Analysis of lengths and GC percentage of pseudogenes
and their flanking regions
For sequence length and GC percentage calculations, only
the exonic segments of pseudogenes were considered.
One thousand nucleotides upstream and downstream of
a pseudogenes were considered as flanking regions. GC
content is calculated as the sum of guanine and cytosine
nucleotides divided by the total number of nucleotides
represented in terms of percentage.
6. Ka/Ks ratio calculations
'PAL2NAL' [44] was used to construct codon alignments
between protein sequences (conceptual amino acid translation sequences in the case of pseudogenes) and corresponding DNA sequences, separately, for orthologous
pseudogenes and parental protein coding genes. 'PAML 4'
package [45] was used to calculate Ka/Ks ratios. Orthologs
of human parental protein coding genes were identified
using a similar approach as that for pseudogene orthologs
discussed above, and also obtained from Ensembl database.

We derived a simulation protocol to calculate Ka/Ks values for evolution without coding-sequence selection pressures. This simulation protocol is as follows: (i) the
nucleotide distance (Dnt) between a sequence and its
ortholog was calculated, using the program DNADIST
[46]; (ii) for each sequence, samples of 500 simulated
sequences were generated, by randomly mutating the

human sequence until the Dnt value was reached; (iii) Ka/
Ks was calculated using PAML [45], for each simulated
sequence compared to the original human sequence; (iv)
those original human sequences that have Ka/Ks values <
95% of simulated Ka/Ks values were labeled as potentially
under significant purifying selection. For these simulations, all Ka/Ks calculations are performed on the longest
ORF in the sequence.
We also analysed simulated distributions of Ka/Ks for
populations of sequences mutating without coding-

sequence selection pressures, starting from the human
TPA sequences. These were derived simply by merging the
simulated distributions of Ka/Ks for each individual TPA.
7. Annotation of disrupted protein domains
Protein domains were assigned to the TPAs, using protein
structure domain sequences downloaded from the
ASTRALSCOP database http://astral.berkeley.edu, as
described previously [4]. Protein domains sequences were
aligned to the TPA nucleotide sequences to assess for disablement by a frameshift or premature stop codon at least

15 amino acids from the end of the aligned subsequence.
Disablements were required to be detected both by blast/
bl2seq and by the TFASTX program [4,39].
8. Antisense homology
Transcribed human pseudogenes were aligned to fulllength annotated human cDNA to examine for any antisense homology by using the sequence-searching program
BlastN from the BLAST package (E-value < 1e-10).
9. small RNA (siRNA) mapping
siRNAs have been previously determined in the mouse
genome [18,19]. Using this data we mapped the siRNA
sequences onto the mouse genome using GMAP software
[41], and checked how many of these overlap with the
annotations of transcribed mouse pseudogenes.
10. Phylogenetic analysis
Ortholog sequences to the human transcribed ADP-ribose
pyrophosphatase
pseudogene
(urn:lsid:pseudogene.org:9606.Pseudogene:4346; see Table 1), were
obtained from the various studied mammals and were
aligned using the online ClustalW tool http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/. The most conserved segment
representing 257-396 positions of the human pseudogene
was considered for the phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using 'PHYLIP' software [46].
The tree was evaluated statistically using 1000 bootstrap
iterations and was visualized using the 'NJplot' tool [47].
