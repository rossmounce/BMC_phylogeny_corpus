Abstract
Background: Ginkgo biloba L. is the only surviving member of one of the oldest living seed plant groups with
medicinal, spiritual and horticultural importance worldwide. As an evolutionary relic, it displays many characters
found in the early, extinct seed plants and extant cycads. To establish a molecular base to understand the
evolution of seeds and pollen, we created a cDNA library and EST dataset from the reproductive structures of
male (microsporangiate), female (megasporangiate), and vegetative organs (leaves) of Ginkgo biloba.
Results: RNA from newly emerged male and female reproductive organs and immature leaves was used to create
three distinct cDNA libraries from which 6,434 ESTs were generated. These 6,434 ESTs from Ginkgo biloba were
clustered into 3,830 unigenes. A comparison of our Ginkgo unigene set against the fully annotated genomes of rice
and Arabidopsis, and all available ESTs in Genbank revealed that 256 Ginkgo unigenes match only genes among the
gymnosperms and non-seed plants – many with multiple matches to genes in non-angiosperm plants. Conversely,
another group of unigenes in Gingko had highly significant homology to transcription factors in angiosperms
involved in development, including MADS box genes as well as post-transcriptional regulators. Several of the
conserved developmental genes found in Ginkgo had top BLAST homology to cycad genes. We also note here the
presence of ESTs in G. biloba similar to genes that to date have only been found in gymnosperms and an additional
22 Ginkgo genes common only to genes from cycads.
Conclusion: Our analysis of an EST dataset from G. biloba revealed genes potentially unique to gymnosperms.
Many of these genes showed homology to fully sequenced clones from our cycad EST dataset found in common
only with gymnosperms. Other Ginkgo ESTs are similar to developmental regulators in higher plants. This work
sets the stage for future studies on Ginkgo to better understand seed and pollen evolution, and to resolve the
ambiguous phylogenetic relationship of G. biloba among the gymnosperms.

Background
Ginkgo biloba is a widely popular tree that is native to
China and has been cultivated for well over a millennium.
In Asia, G. biloba is used medicinally and its seeds are also
a popular cuisine item. In the West, Ginkgo leaf extracts are
commonly used for a variety of folk remedies (for review
see: [1]) including as a treatment for improving cognitive
function [2,3]. Today's Ginkgo biloba is the sole surviving
species of an ancient group (Ginkgophytes) of seed plants
that may even date from the Permian (approximately
150–200 million years ago) [4]. The genus Ginkgo itself
goes back to the Jurassic period – approximately 170 million years ago [5]. Although it is widely believed that the
survival of G. biloba depended upon Buddhist monks,
who venerated the tree cultivated in their temple grounds,
molecular evidence suggests that some stands in China
(Wuchuan, Guizhou) are of natural origin representing
vestige populations [6]. As a living fossil, Ginkgo biloba has
changed little in morphology from its extinct relatives [5].
Along with the Cycadales, Coniferales and Gnetales, the
Ginkgoales is one of four orders of non-flowering seed
plants (gymnosperms) that form a sister group to the
angiosperms (Figure 1).
Morphological [7,8] and molecular analysis have not yet
succeeded in defining the precise phylogenetic hierarchy
of the four gymnosperm clades [9]. Ginkgo potentially
forms a sister group with the Coniferales (partly due to
similar characteristics such as axillary branching and simple leaves). Another model, based on molecular sequence
data, places Ginkgo with the Cycadales [10-12]. Interestingly cycads and Ginkgo both share certain plesiomorphic
(ancestral) characters found in early fossil seed plants
such as haustorial pollen [13,14], which release motile
male gametes [15] as well as a large four celled opening in
the neck of the archegonia [13,16]. Despite the presence
of these and other early seed-plant characteristics, surprisingly little work has been performed on Ginkgo and
cycads. Some recent molecular [17] and genomic [18]
research on cycads have been conducted and molecular
studies of Ginkgo genes have been initiated as well [1921]. However, no genomic work on Ginkgo biloba has been
completed to date.
To begin our genomic treatment of Ginkgo biloba, we
focused our initial efforts on developing reproductive and
vegetative tissues (Figure 2). Separating Ginkgo male and
female structures at an early stage is straightforward
because Ginkgo is strictly a dioecious plant (male and
female organs on separate individuals). Organ emergence
can generally be pinpointed to a specific time of the year
in that both reproductive and vegetative tissues are regularly produced in the beginning of May at our collection
site in New York. The reproductive structures, megasporangia bearing ovules (Figure 2A–C) (from female trees)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/143

and microsporangia bearing pollen (Figure 2D–F) (from
male trees), emerge at the apex of short, determinate
(spur) shoots. A discreet flush of leaves are also produced
in male and female short-shoots (Figure 2A and 2D)
[13,16,22]. Long shoots (not shown) exhibit indeterminate growth and yield only vegetative organs. Long-shoots
are identifiable by their obvious longer internodes,
whereas short shoots (Figure 2A and 2D) have telescoped
internodes. Each season, short-shoots might exhibit
extensive internode growth and be transformed into longshoots and vice versa. Consequently, reproductive shoots
can become vegetative or vegetative shoots can become
reproductive.
Until now, little is known regarding the genetic regulation
of development in the oldest living seed plants. In order
to uncover the genetic controls directing growth and
development in Ginkgo biloba, we generated expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) from cDNA libraries of very young,
recently emerged organs of fertile short-shoots where a
large number of regulatory genes are expected to be
present. Below is an analysis of these ESTs from Ginkgo
biloba. In all three tissues examined, vegetative, microsporangia (male), and megasporangia (female), we found a
large number of ESTs with similarity to angiosperm developmental genes. Conversely, a certain number of Ginkgo
biloba ESTs were uncovered with homology to genes only
found in gymnosperms and non-seed plants, including a

Results and discussion
Construction of a cDNA library from Ginkgo biloba fertile
and vegetative tissue
Young organs (Figure 2A and 2D) were collected during
the spring from the opening buds of short shoots imme-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/143

diately after their emergence. At this stage, the megasporangium consists of an axis typically bearing two ovules
(Figure 2A–C). The ovule is composed of a single integument surrounding a developing nucellus (Figure 2C). The
male structure consists of a main axis bearing two or more
microsporangia (Figure 2D–F). RNA was extracted from
the following organs: megagasporangia, microsporangia
and two sets of leaves collected from either male or female
trees. mRNA isolated from all four tissues was used to construct four separate cDNA libraries. (Both male and
female leaf sequences were pooled during subsequent
bioinformatic analysis). Size fractionation was used to
enrich for full-length cDNAs during library construction.
From this cDNA library, 6,434 sequence reads (Expressed
Sequence Tags, ESTs) were generated. All Ginkgo biloba
EST reads have been deposited in GenBank. It was determined that 3,739 (58%) of the cDNA clones were over
500 bp long. 3618 of the reads were generated from the 5'
end of the cDNA, and 2816 were sequenced from the 3'
end. Cluster analysis on the EST sequence produced a unigene set of 3,830 contigs consisting of 2,851 singletons
and 979 assemblies. Of the clusteredESTs, the longest contig was 2,172 bp. The entire unigene set or complete
Ginkgo BLAST files can be downloaded at the following
website [23]. Each G. biloba contig is given a numeric
identifier. The constituent ESTs for each contig can be
obtained at this website. Additional bioinformatic analysis of the Ginkgo biloba dataset can be accessed at the
open Sputnik Comparative Genomics Platform at [24].
This site features sequence annotations, peptide sequence
predictions, protein domain architectures and putative
molecular markers (ISSRs) for the ginkgo EST derived unigenes. The sequence can be downloaded either as a fasta
file, a clustered fasta file or as the derived peptide fasta file.
In addition, BLAST analysis can be performed with the
clustered ESTs from a given ginkgo organ against all genes
in Arabidopsis thaliana or distinct plant clustered EST
datasets using the ViCoGenTa program available at the
New York Plant Genomics Consortium website [23].
Ginkgo contig matches to genes in angiosperms,
gymnosperms and non-seed plants
TBLASTX (expect < 1eX10-5) was used to compare the G.
biloba unigenes against all available plant ESTs from
TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research) [25], and the
Plant Genome DataBase (Plant GDB) [26]. ESTs from
these databases were downloaded and clustered into unigenes, which were used in the comparison. Next the
Ginkgo unigene set was compared against the Arabidopsis
and rice genome annotated protein sequences downloaded from TIGR. All genes used in this comparison
against Ginkgo were divided into one of three taxonomically relevant categories: 1. angiosperms, 2. gymnosperms, and 3. non-seed plants. The angiosperm category
encompasses all annotated rice and Arabidopsis genes

identified from their respective genomic sequences, as
well as all higher plant ESTs. The majority of the gymnosperm ESTs came from the conifer groups pine and spruce
but also include ESTs generated from the Plant Genomics
Consortium containing ESTs from the two other gymnosperm clades, Cycadales and Gnetales. The non-seed plant
category consisted of genes from all remaining plant ESTs
including ferns, fern allies, bryophytes and algae available
with the majority of the sequences originating from Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydamonas reinhardtii.
A Venn diagram shown in Figure 3A displays the number
of Ginkgo contigs, which are shared between one or more
of the plant EST datasets at low BLAST stringency value
(expect < 1eX10-5). From the Venn diagram, it can be seen
that a majority of Ginkgo unigenes (2749/3830) match
genes in other plants, and 1081 have no match to other
plant genes. Of those 2749 Ginkgo biloba unigenes with
matches to other plant genes, a subgroup of 256 unigenes
had no corresponding match to genes in the angiosperm

dataset. Of these 256 Ginkgo genes that do not match
angiosperms, 4 also match genes in non-seed plants.
The 252 Ginkgo biloba unigenes that only match gymnosperm genes were next partitioned into matches between
the three other gymnosperm orders: Cycadales, Coniferales, and Gnetales (Figure 3B). Since there are significantly more conifer unigenes (>60,000) than cycad
unigenes (5459) that were used in this comparison, one
would expect that the number of matches between Ginkgo
and conifers would be significantly greater than matches
between Ginkgo and cycads. However the actual number
of matches between Ginkgo and conifers (215) is only
slightly more then for Ginkgo and cycads (163). In other
words despite the fact that there is over 10 times the
number of conifer genes then cycad genes used in this
comparison, Ginkgo matches to conifers are only 1.3 times
greater then matches between Ginkgo and cycads. Of the
matches between Ginkgo and gymnosperms, 31 match
only cycads, (22 match Cycas rumphii, 6 match only uni-

genes from the cycad species, Zamia furfuracea, (753 contigs deposited in Genbank from Brenner et al,
unpublished data); and 3 Ginkgo contigs match unigenes
from both Cycas rumphii and Zamia furfuracea).
As one might expect, unigenes with matches to other
plants are somewhat longer then those that have no
match to other plants. Of all Ginkgo unigenes with
matches to other plants, 89% are greater than 300 bp,
whereas 72% are greater than 300 bp then those Ginkgo
unigenes with no matches to other plants.
Common genes between cycads and Ginkgo
Our comparative analysis of the Ginkgo EST dataset
builds upon our results from a previous genomic study on
the cycad, Cycas rumphii [18]. In our current analysis,
three
(CB090673:GinkgoA3816,
CycadCB089620:GingkoA3730,
and
CycadCB089926:GinkgoA1532) of the fourteen unigenes
from cycads previously found only among gymnosperms
(after the full-length clone was sequenced), were also
homologues to Ginkgo genes found only in gymnosperms. Considering the relatively small number of unigenes from Ginkgo (3,830) and cycads (4706) available
for our comparative studies, the detection of the same
gene match in Ginkgo and cycads with homology to only
gymnosperms strengthens the argument that these genes
are gymnosperms specific.
Ginkgo matches to non-seed plants but not angisosperms
An additional four Ginkgo unigenes that are not found in
angiosperms were detected in non-seed plants. Three of
these Ginkgo unigenes (GinkgoA2411, GinkgoA3214 and
GinkgoA325) match non-seed plants and other gymnosperm genes whereas the forth Ginkgo gene
(GinkgoA2273) only matches non-seed plants with similarity to a gene in Chlamydomonas.
Classification of G. biloba ESTs by functional categories
Each contig from the Ginkgo dataset was automatically
assigned to a functional category (FunCat) based on its
top match against the MIPS FunCat list of functionally
annotated gene sequences from S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana databases using BLASTP. A non-stringent expect
value (E-value) of < e-10 was chosen as the threshold.
Table 1 below illustrates the relative fraction that each
functional category comprises within the entire unigene
set compared to our previous study in Cycas rumphii [18].
The four largest categories of Ginkgo ESTs according to
this functional categorization are: "cellular organization"
(19%), "metabolism" (11%), "unclassified proteins"
(14%), and "protein synthesis" (8%). In general, these
same categories are also the highest in the cycad EST
library from our previous work, except for "protein synthesis", which appears increased in Ginkgo, whereas inter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/143

estingly, the category of cell growth, cell division and
DNA synthesis is reduced in Ginkgo compared to cycads.
Ginkgo genes involved in development
Analysis of the Ginkgo biloba dataset revealed a number
of ESTs with highest BLAST similarity to genes with
known roles in higher plant developmental processes. A
sampling of some of these genes is shown below (Table
2). These genes included the Polycomb gene CURLY LEAF
[27,28] as well as LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES
(LOB) [29], EARLY FLOWERING 5 (ELF5) [30], FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) [31], and CONSTANS (for review see
[32] as well as five ESTs that match MADS box genes,
some of which appear identical to previously cloned fragments of MADS genes from Ginkgo biloba including the
G. biloba ortholog of AGAMOUS [19]. Other genes in our
EST library have homologies to proteins that regulate
development through protein turnover including SPA-1
[33]COP1 [34] and COP9 [35,36]. This sampling reveals
that the EST dataset of Ginkgo biloba is a rich source of
genes encoding proteins with known roles in development at the transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional
stage.

Conclusion
The importance of Ginkgo for the study of plant evolution
As the sole remaining species of an ancient genus of plants
which has survived nearly 170 million years from the
Jurassic [5], Ginkgo biloba is a taxonomic and geographic
relict that may be even older because fossils displaying a
"ginkgophyte" vegetative morphology have been found as
early as the Permian [4]. Ginkgo has a number of plesiomorphic (unspecialized) as well as apomorphic (derived)
traits that make it a valuable tool to study the evolution of
seed plants. Here we used a genomic approach to investigate the genes involved in regulating development in
Ginkgo by creating an EST library from both reproductive
and vegetative tissues.

Similar to our previous analysis in Cycas rumphii, our
Ginkgo EST study has found significant BLAST homology
between Ginkgo ESTs with plant genes in gymnosperms
and non-seed plants but not in angiosperms. Since ESTs,
even when clustered in contiguous genes, may not represent the complete gene [37], often one will find homology
to angiosperm genes when the remaining Ginkgo gene
sequence is revealed. For example in the gymnosperm,
Pinus taeda EST collection, contigs of increasing length
have a higher likelihood then shorter contigs matching a
known gene in the Arabidopsis genome [38]. However, in
this same study a significant subcategory of very long contigs (>1900 bp) have no homology to Arabidopsis [38]. It
is likely that at least some of these long contigs with no
match to angiosperm genes represent full length genes
that are specific to the gymnosperm and/or seed-less plant

clades. Our strategy to address this question involves
screening for these same genes in additional taxa of gymnosperms, in the case of this study, Ginkgo biloba. In our
analysis three Ginkgo genes that were only found in gymnosperms also matched the fourteen ESTs from our previous study of gymnosperm common cycad genes.
Along these same lines, our results suggest the presence of
genes common to non-seed plants and gymnosperms that
are not present in angiosperms. This non-seed plant/gymnosperm grouping is not surprising considering the fact
that gymnosperms have morphologically common characters that are not found in the angiosperms – particularly
in their reproductive structures. For example, the megagametophyte is highly reduced both in cell number and in
structural organization in angiosperms when compared to
gymnosperms. Although these results cannot say for certain that these genes are specific to non-seed plants and
gymnosperms, or more specifically that these genes are
found in gymnosperm structures that are not found in
seed plant, it nonetheless represents an important starting
point to correlate the presence or absence of gymnosperm
genes in angiosperms and/or lower plants.
Are cycads and Ginkgo sister taxa?
One result from our study found that the number of
Ginkgo contig matches to conifers are only 1.3 times
greater then matches between Ginkgo and cycads despite
the fact that there is over 10 times the number of conifer
genes then cycad genes used in this comparison,. Taken

together these results might indicate a closer evolutionary
association between Ginkgo and cycads then between
Ginkgo and conifers. This bias towards cycad/Ginkgo similarity correlates with the fact that the majority of molecular phylogenetic studies place as the cycads sister group to
Ginkgo. Hopefully, this preliminary data will encourage
further phylogenomic studies to fully resolve the hierarchy among extant gymnosperm orders. Until the full
genome sequence becomes available for key gymnosperm
taxa, EST sampling provides an important initial step for
large scale identification of molecular markers to generate
robust phylogenetic trees.
Developmental regulators in Ginkgo
In Ginkgo biloba we note here a variety of genes with similarity to developmental regulators in angiosperms. We
also note below that homologues to some of these developmental regulators are also present in our Cycas rumphii
library as either orthologs to those found in higher plants
or at least, belonging to the same gene family. An EST
from Ginkgo biloba that was detected in the megagametophyte library has high similarity to the Arabidopsis
CURLY LEAF (CLC) gene, which belongs to the Polycomb-group proteins (PcGs). PcGs epigenetically regulate
downstream target genes [28]. PcGs modify chromatinprotein complexes that repress homeotic gene transcription and influence cell proliferation. In Arabidopsis PcG
genes have been shown to regulate MADS box genes [39].
The CLC protein product regulates the expression of AGAMOUS [27], a gene controlling floral organ identity [40].
Interestingly, an ortholog for angiosperm AGAMOUS was
also detected in the Ginkgo megagametophyte library
(Table 2). Ginkgo AGAMOUS, (previously named GBM5)
was identified in a study where the MADS domains were
examined in Ginkgo [19]. In this work Ginkgo AGAMOUS was shown via RT-PCR to be expressed in not only
female but also in male and vegetative tissue. In our analysis, five total MADS box homologues were also detected
in the Ginkgo EST dataset. Three of the Ginkgo ESTs from
our
library,
GinkgoA2340,
GinkgoA2730
and
GinkgoA2850, are perfectly identical to the MADS
domain gene fragments previously cloned by [19] as
degenerate PCR products. The other two unigenes from
our dataset have homologies to MADS genes
(GinkgoA629 and GinkgoA352), but do not specifically
match any of the PCR fragments isolated in their study.
These two MADS box unigenes either do not include the
small region amplified in their degenerate PCR screen or
could alternative be unique MADS genes not isolated in
their study. Unlike the degenerate primer approach used
to isolate MADS genes, our EST approach offers the additional advantage of cloning entire genes or at least substantially large gene fragments. Among the few
developmental genes examined in gymnosperms, most

attention has focused on the expression of MADS
homologs [41,42].
Other developmental genes found in the Ginkgo EST
library include those with homology to regulators of flowering such as EARLY FLOWERING 5 (ELF5), which controls the levels of the gene FLC, which itself is a central
regulator of flowering [30]. Another Ginkgo EST includes
FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which belongs to a small
family of genes (FT/TFL1) that act to promote flowering as
a downstream component from CONSTANS [43]. CONSTANS is a transcription factor that has a critical role integrating circadian rhythms and light signals (for review see
[32]). As one would expect an EST homolog for the CONSTANS gene family was found in Ginkgo. CONSTANS
belongs to a large gene family, which may have redundant
roles in plants [44]. Not surprisingly, we also found
homologs to CONSTANS in our previous study on cycad
leaf ESTs [18]. In that flowering plants are believed to
have evolved from gymnosperms, a survey of CONSTANS, ELF, and FT in gymnosperms, particularly in very
young reproductive tissue might help define the origins of
reproductive induction in non-flowering plants. Among
the other genes related to developmental regulators
includes a homologue to LATEROL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) domain gene family which in Arabidopsis has
over 40 members [29]. The molecular mechanism of LOB
domain containing genes is unknown, but one gene in
Arabidopsis, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2, is required for normal leaf development, by potentially acting as a regulatory repressor of KNOX genes [45]. A KNOX homolog is

also present in our EST library and was found in male
reproductive tissues and HOX genes were also detected in
our previous analysis in C. rumphii
Another important component regulating development
occurs at the level of protein degradation. A gene recognized in our EST library includes COP1. COP1, serves as
an E3 ubiquitin targeting photomorphogenic factors such
as HY5 for degradation [33]. Another Ginkgo EST from the
library has highest similarity to COP9. In our previous EST
analysis in Cycas rumphii an EST was also isolated with
similarity to COP9 [18]. COP9 is a subunit of the COP9
signalosome complex that controls multiple signaling
pathways that regulate development in all eukaryotes
[35,36]. In Arabidopsis, the cop9 and cop1 mutants are constitutively photomorphogenic in dark grown seedlings
[46]. Unlike angiosperms, seedlings from conifers are
constitutively photomorphogenic when grown in the dark
[47,48]. In Ginkgo, chlorophyll and chloroplast development is completely dependent on light, however this
process proceeds at a markedly slower pace then in flowering plants. That is, photomorphogenic development in
Ginkgo seedlings is strongly delayed after transfer from
dark grown conditions to light grown conditions when
compared to seed plants [20,21]. The dark grown phenotype of cycads is unreported. Considering this variability
in photomorphic development among and between the
gymnosperms and the angiosperms, the discovery of
genes encoding photomorphogenic regulators in gymnosperms will help understand the evolution of photomorphogenesis in seed plants.

Taken together, our genomics analysis of Ginkgo biloba is
an important additional step to analyze the role of molecular development of early seed plants. Thus the stage is set
to further determine the role of these genes during the
development of ancillary structures found between
Ginkgo, cycads and other gymnosperms with higher plants
as well as the role of those in structures that are unique to
gymnosperms and/or the non-seed plants as a step to
understand the evolution of the seed plant habit.

Methods
Tissue collection and library construction and DNA
purification
Newly emerged microsporangia from accession 76163B,
megasporangia from accession 76163D, and immature
leaves from both accessions were collected from newly
opened buds of Ginkgo biloba growing in the New York
Botanical Garden outdoor collection on April 12, 2002.
Organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was collected from each organ and a cDNA library was constructed from fractionated cDNA according to [49].
Microscopy
Ginkgo apices were collected on April 19. Bract tissues
were removed from the apex leaving the leaves and reproductive tissue, which was fixed in FAA (50% ethanol, 5%
glacial acetic Acid, 3.7% formaldehyde) under vacuum
(20 In. Hg) at room temperature. Fresh FAA was vacuum
infiltrated two additional times. Tissue was stored in 70%
ethanol at 4°C.

For histology, tissue was prepared by sequential (overnight 4 C incubation at each alcohol grade) dehydration
in 80, 90, 95 and finally 100% ethanol plus Eosin Y
(National Medicinal Products) followed by two treatments in 100% ethanol for 2 hours at room temperature.
The tissue was next placed in a 1:1 solution of ethanol and
toluene, then twice in toluene alone, each time for 2 hours
at room temperature. The tissue was then placed in toluene with a quarter-volume of paraffin (PARAPLAST XTRA® (Fisher)) chips at 60°C overnight. The tissue was
then embedded in melted paraffin with six wax changes
over the course of three days at 55°C. Apices were sectioned on a MICROM HM 355 microtome. 8 µm thick
sections were taken using a blade angle of 9°. The tissue
was stained with Astra Blue and Safranin. After mounting
on slides, sections were imaged using a Nikon DXM1200F
digital microscope camera.
For scanning electron microscopy, fixed materials were
dissected, dehydrated in ethanol and critical point dried
in a Denton critical point dryer. Dried materials were
affixed to aluminium E. M. stubs and coated with between
80–240 A of palladium in a Hummer II Sputter Coater.
Coated materials were then observed using a Jeol scan-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/143

ning electron microscope at 15 or 20 kV. Images were digitally recorded and evaluated using Adobe Photoshop 9.0.
EST sequencing and gene analysis
Plasmid DNA was collected as described in the manual
(Stratagene), catalogue number 200450 in the in vivo
mass excision section. Sequence analysis was performed at
CSHL using an ABI 3700 Capillary sequencer for separation and nucleotide detection. Reactions were performed
using a 1/16 Big Dye Terminator. Sequencing was performed with either the -21 M13 forward and/or reverse
primer. ESTs were assembled using Phrap [50,51] and
clustered into contigs using the CAP3 program [52]
Peptide extraction
Peptide sequences were derived for all unigenes using the
ESTScan application [53] run with the default parameters.
Prior to the ESTScan predictions, a Ginkgo species-specific
ESTScan model was created. ESTScan was trained with
Ginkgo ORFs identified from the best match of BLASTX
analyses performed on the unigene sequence against the
Swissprot protein database. All BLASTX matches were filtered using the arbitrary expectation value of 1e-10.
Sequence annotation
Sequence annotation on each of the Ginkgo cluster consensus sequences and derived peptides were performed
within the openSputnik application [54]. Results were
assessed for possible contamination by searching for
homology to the E. coli and human genomes and were
scored for homology to a wide range of non-coding RNAs
and plant chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes.
Homology searches were performed using the BLAST
application [55] and results were filtered using the expectation value < 1e-10. Functional assignment was performed on both cluster consensus sequence and the
peptide sequence. Assignments were made using BLASTX
and BLASTP respectively against the MIPS catalogue of
functionally assigned proteins (funcat) [50,51], tentative
functional assignments were filtered using the expectation
value < 1e-10.
Categorization of Ginkgo contigs
All Ginkgo contigs sequences were aligned against a PlantEST database using TBLASTX [55] and BLASTX against the
NR (aa) database. The PlantEST database was created by
downloading all plant ESTs in GenBank and assembling
them using Phrap [50,51]. Todd Wood from Clemson
University provided the PERL script that creates the PlantEST databases as described above. The NR (aa) database
is a non-redundant database of protein sequences from
GenBank.

Determination of gymnosperm specific genes
All available plant ESTs were downloaded from GenBank
and separated into three datasets consisting of
angiosperms (monocots and dicots), gymnosperms, or
non-seed plants (ferns, mosses and algae). Downloaded
ESTs were assembled using Phrap [50,51]. All matches
with an expect value < 1e 10-5 are considered significant.
