Abstract
Background: We spend most of our lives in indoor environments and are exposed to microbes present
in these environments. Hence, knowledge about this exposure is important for understanding how it
impacts on human health. However, the bacterial flora in indoor environments has been only fragmentarily
explored and mostly using culture methods. The application of molecular methods previously utilised in
other environments has resulted in a substantial increase in our awareness of microbial diversity.
Results: The composition and dynamics of indoor dust bacterial flora were investigated in two buildings
over a period of one year. Four samples were taken in each building, corresponding to the four seasons,
and 16S rDNA libraries were constructed. A total of 893 clones were analysed and 283 distinct
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected among them using 97% sequence similarity as the criterion.
All libraries were dominated by Gram-positive sequences, with the most abundant phylum being Firmicutes.
Four OTUs having high similarity to Corynebacterium-, Propionibacterium-, Streptococcus- and Staphylococcussequences were present in all samples. The most abundant of the Gram-negative OTUs were members of
the family Sphingomonadaceae, followed by Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Neisseriaceae and
Rhizobiaceae.
The relative abundance of alpha- and betaproteobacteria increased slightly towards summer at the
expense of firmicutes. The proportion of firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria of the total diversity was
highest in winter and that of actinobacteria, alpha- and betaproteobacteria in spring or summer, whereas
the diversity of bacteroidetes peaked in fall. A statistical comparison of the libraries revealed that the
bacterial flora of the two buildings differed during all seasons except spring, but differences between
seasons within one building were not that clear, indicating that differences between the buildings were
greater than the differences between seasons.
Conclusion: This work demonstrated that the bacterial flora of indoor dust is complex and dominated
by Gram-positive species. The dominant phylotypes most probably originated from users of the building.
Seasonal variation was observed as proportional changes of the phyla and at the species level. The
microflora of the two buildings investigated differed statistically and differences between the buildings
were more pronounced than differences between seasons.

Background
We spend most of our lives in different indoor environments; in homes, day-care facilities, schools and workplaces, and are continuously challenged by the microbial
content of these environments. Traditionally, infections
are considered as the main health effect of bacteria; however, these micro-organisms can affect our health in many
other ways. During infancy, contact with bacteria in the
environment leads to development of the indigenous
human microflora, the importance of which for human
health has been acknowledged but is still not fully understood [1]. Microbial exposure in childhood also prevents
the development of allergic conditions [2,3]. Later in life,
microbial exposure in indoor environments can also
affect human health; for example, moisture damage in a
building can lead to increased indoor microbial levels and
this can have adverse health effects [4].
New questions concerning environmental microbial
exposure have emerged lately. For example, the numbers
of community acquired MRSA infections among healthy
individuals have risen rapidly in recent years [5], showing
that there are reservoirs of this pathogen outside of hospitals. Although infectious agents normally cannot persist
for a long time in air, a recent study has shown that antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is common in indoor
air of normal residential buildings [6]. Against this background, it is surprising how little we know about the composition of the microbial communities in indoor
environments. The information is fragmentary and
mostly based on cultivation methods, although it has
been claimed that only approximately 1% of the microbes
in indoor environments are viable [7].
Most of the literature about bacteria in normal indoor
environments is concerned with cultivation of air samples. Indoor dust samples have rarely been investigated by
cultivation or methods permitting identification of bacterial species. In healthy offices, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus,
Pantoea and Pseudomonas were the most abundant bacterial genera found in carpet dust [8]. Based on the results of
cultivation methods, it seems that both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria are common in indoor air of
residential settings, office buildings and hospitals [8-11].
There are several frequently encountered taxa; Gram-positive cocci, corynebacteria, bacilli, in addition to Gramnegative species, such as Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas.
However, Gram-positive bacteria dominate the flora, at
least in studies using culture methods, comprising up to
75% of the bacteria present in the indoor air [9]. Certain
Gram-positive bacteria with strong immunogenic properties or potential toxin producers, such as mycobacteria,
streptomycetes or Nocardiopsis spp., have also been shown
to be present in indoor environments [12-14]. In a mouse

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/56

model, these bacteria induced inflammation in vitro and
in vivo [15,16].
Cultivation methods can only detect a small fraction of
microbial flora, depending on the culture conditions
being used and the viability of the microbes. With respect
to indoor environments, the cultivability has been
reported to vary between 0.03% to 100%, depending on
the sampling method and microbial species, for example
[7,17]. Bacteria are less resistant to sampling stress than
fungi. It would be predicted that application of molecular
methods will change the current picture of what bacteria
are present in indoor environments. Sequencing of 16S
ribosomal DNA clone libraries has been successfully used
for characterisation of bacterial flora in soil, marine habitats and human intestine [18-20]. The advantage of this
approach is that all microbial species should be detected
equally and the limitations of culture conditions can be
overcome. One major benefit is that one can make a relatively exact phylogenetic placement of the detected DNA
sequences with respect to reference sequences in public
databases. Recent advances in statistical analysis methods
of clone libraries [21-23] allow one to conduct a more
sophisticated assessment of the differences in microbial
communities between samples.
Recently, two studies using culture-independent methods
to investigate bacterial flora in indoor environments have
been published [24,25]. Lee et al. (2007) investigated the
bacterial diversity in a child-care facility using both culture-based and molecular methods. In that study, Pseudomonadaceae and Oxalobacteraceae were the most
dominant families in the clone libraries, though Grampositive genera, such as Bacillus, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were also present. The most commonly cultured
bacteria were Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. The
authors found 29 putative bacterial species among the isolates, compared to 141 distinct OTUs using 3% sequence
divergence in the clone libraries. Kelley et al. (2004) studied biofilms present on shower curtains using 16S rDNA
clone libraries and found that this microenvironment
maintains a diverse microbial community. In that study,
sequences representing Sphingomonas spp. and Methylobacterium spp. were the most often encountered. Already
these two examples show that the microbial community
in indoor environments is more diverse than would have
been suspected from reports of culture studies. In a study
of the outdoor air microbes present in two cities in USA
using molecular methods, the most common bacteria
found in the outdoor air were acidobacteria, verrucomicrobia, bacilli, clostridia and some proteobacteria, such as
Sphingomonas-species [26].
Indoor microbial samples can be taken from surfaces as
swab samples, from indoor air or dust. House dust is a res-

ervoir for all kinds of pollutants and can be considered as
a long-term integrated sample of indoor particulate matter that has, at least partly, been airborne [27]. Dust is relatively easy to collect for analysis and in the last years,
dust samples have been extensively used in epidemiological studies to characterise human exposure to environmental microbial material [28,29], hence dust samples
are widely used and provide a good picture of the total
microbial exposure in indoor environments. In many epidemiological studies, the endotoxin level in dust samples
has been used as surrogate for exposure to environmental
microbes. However, measurement of endotoxin activity
does not provide an accurate assessment of the total
microbial, or even the bacterial exposure. Therefore, more
information about the actual species diversity in indoor
dust is needed to allow a better assessment of the importance of indoor bacteria for human health. It has been
shown that fungal concentrations in indoor air and dust
vary temporally [30-32] and thus, the sampling time and
season can affect the results of an indoor microbial analysis. Seasonal variation of cultivable levels of bacteria in
indoor air has also been observed; though no clear pattern
has emerged [9]. Seasonal changes in the bacterial flora of
house dust have not been investigated earlier; this is a gap
in the fundamental knowledge needed for exposure
assessment.
The aim of this study was to investigate the species level
diversity and seasonal dynamics of bacterial flora in
indoor dust by sequencing of 16S rDNA clone libraries.
Dust samples were collected from hard indoor surfaces
including floor, tables and shelves by vacuum cleaning.
Office rooms in two buildings were sampled at different
times during one year to obtain four samples per building,

one for each season. Eight 16S rDNA clone libraries were
constructed and approximately 100 sequences per library
analysed. The results indicated a high amount of Grampositive species and human-derived sequences in indoor
dust and furthermore that variation between buildings
was more pronounced that variation between seasons. To
our knowledge, this is the first study where full length 16S
clone libraries have been used to describe in detail the
diversity of indoor bacterial populations.

Results
Bacterial diversity in house dust
A total number of 953 full-length sequences were
obtained from the eight clone libraries derived from the
indoor dust of two buildings, one sample representing
one season in each building. A total of 60 of these
sequences originated from chloroplasts, and were
excluded from further analyses. A few chloroplast
sequences were observed in all samples; however, they
mainly occurred in the summer samples. Altogether 893
clones were further analyzed, among which 283 different
OTUs were detected using 3% sequence difference as a criterion. On the average, 112 sequences were obtained and
103 OTUs detected per season. Shannon and Simpson
diversity indices indicated the highest species richness in
the spring samples, followed by fall, summer and winter
samples. In addition, they pointed to a higher diversity in
Building 1 during all seasons, except winter (Table 1).
ACE and Chao estimators, on the contrary, suggested
highest species diversity in the fall sample of Building 1
and in the winter sample of Building 2. The sample coverage for the individual libraries ranged from 19 to 35%.
Collector's curves for pooled samples of both buildings
are displayed in Figure 1.

The bacterial flora in the house dust was dominated by
Gram-positive species. In all, 74% of the clones and 60%
of the OTUs were assigned to actinobacterial and low-GC
Gram-positive species. The most abundant sequences that
were also detected throughout the year were those having
a high similarity to sequences of Corynebacterium-, Propionibacterium-, Streptococcus-, Staphylococcus-, Lactococcus-,
Peptostreptococcus and Lactobacillus species (Figure 2).
Many of the low-GC Gram-positive OTUs were similar to
sequences from bacteria not yet cultured originating from
human samples, such as colon or different mucosa. In
addition, sequences close to known genera that are common in human colon, such as Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus and Ruminococcus were abundant in both buildings.
These OTUs consisted mostly of single sequences, indicating a high diversity of this kind of phylotypes in the dust.
Proteobacterial phylotypes were present in all samples,

the most abundant ones being assigned to four families;
Sphingomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae
and Rhizobiaceae (Figure 2). A few phylotypes affiliating
with the phyla Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and DeinococcusThermus were present in both buildings and single OTUs
of the phyla Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes were found in
only one building. Most of the sequences had high similarity to existing sequences in databases; only 8% of the
OTUs had a < 95% similarity to any known sequence and
about 60% of the OTUs had a sequence similarity > 97%
to a known species. Sequences having less than 95% similarity to database sequences were checked for chimeras,
but none were found. Detailed information about all the
sequenced clones is presented in the Additional file 1.
All of the sequences have been submitted to the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) sequence database.

Seasonal dynamics
The relationships between the clone libraries of individual
buildings and seasons were analysed using the Cluster
environments-option of the Unifrac program. It seemed
that samples from the same building clustered together,
rather than the seasons (Figure 3). The samples from
Building 2 clustered well together, except for the summer
sample. The winter sample from Building 1 differed from
all of the other samples from that building, but the
remaining samples from Building 2 clustered together. A
principal coordinate analysis (PCA) conducted with the
Unifrac program, suggested however that 19% of the variation between the samples could be explained by the season and 15% by the building (Figure 4). Neither of the
factors separated the samples well; only the winter samples were distinguishable from the others.

Two programs, Libshuff and Unifrac, were used to test the
significance of the differences between the samples and
the results are displayed in Table 2. In Building 1, only the
winter sample differed from the others significantly when
Libshuff was used to compare the libraries. When Unifrac
was used, the results indicated that all libraries differed
statistically significantly from each other, with the excep-

two p-values that the program calculated in each comparison was significant. Using Unifrac, only the winter-summer and winter-fall comparisons were marginally
significant (Table 2). The Unifrac significance test results
are in line with the Unifrac PCA results (Figure 4). In the

2 are not so well separated from each other along the season-axis.
The seasonal fluctuation in the actual bacterial flora
within one building at the species level was large; less than
one percent of the OTUs were found in more than two
seasons and over 75% of all OTUs in one building were
found in only one sample. Therefore, differences at the
higher taxonomic levels, such as the class level, were
investigated. The percentual proportion of low GC Grampositive and actinobacterial OTUs remained almost the
same during all seasons in Building 2. With the exception
of a slight decrease in alphaproteobacterial and an
increase in the gammaproteobacterial diversity in the winter sample, the differences between seasons were small. In
Building 1, the seasonal differences in the proportions of
different bacterial classes were clearer. The amount of
actinobacterial OTUs was higher in the spring sample and
that of alpha- and betaproteobacteria in the summer sample. The numbers of alpha- and betaproteobacterial OTUs
were highest in spring and summer samples in both buildings.
Comparison of the two buildings
When combining all sequences obtained from one building into a composite sample and comparing the two
buildings with each other with the Libshuff program, the
libraries were statistically different (Table 2). This difference was confirmed by both Libshuff and Unifrac in comparisons of the buildings over the individual seasons, with
the exception of spring (Table 2). In the Unifrac cluster
environments and PCA analyses, the buildings were
clearly separated from each other (Figures 3 and 4). The
Shannon and Simpson diversity indices pointed a higher
diversity in Building 1 throughout the year, except in winter.

From the 283 OTUs found, 56 were present in both buildings; 15 of them were of actinobacterial origin, 28 firmicutes, six were alphaproteobacteria, five OTUs were
affiliated with betaproteobacteria and two with gammaproteobacteria. The actinobacterial OTUs comprised
sequences with similarity to coryne- (98–99%), propioni(99%), and microbacteria (96–97%) as well as micrococci
(96–99%), Actinomyces viscosus (98%), Nocardioides oleivorans (99%) and Friedmanniella spumicola (99%). The
OTUs affiliating with the phylum Firmicutes included
mostly OTUs having their closest matches among staphylo- (99%), strepto- (99%) and peptostreptococci (96–
99%), lactobacilli (99%) and uncultured species from
human colon (97–99%), in addition to some OTUs having 99% sequence similarity to Ruminococcus, Enterobacterium, Enterococcus, Selenomonas and Veillonella species. The
alphaproteobacterial sequences present in both buildings
were similar to Methylobacterium organophilum (97%),

Samples

Comparisons using web-based Libshuff and Unifrac significance analyses were conducted between the individual buildings and the four seasons.
∆CXY – and ∆CYX – values represent the difference between the two libraries calculated by Libshuff. Libraries that are significantly different with a
confidence of 95% are marked with*. 1, Building 1; 2, Building 2; W, winter; Sp, spring; Su, summer; F, fall.

Rhizobium (97–98%) and Sphingomonas species (98–
99%), betaproteobacterial sequences affiliated with Neisseria spp. (99%), Variovorax spp. (99%) and Janthinobacterium spp. (97%) and gammaproteobacterial OTUs had a
high sequence similarity to Shigella sonnei (99%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (99%). Four OTUs were observed
throughout the year in both buildings. These had 99%
sequence similarity to Corynebacterium spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus
thermophilus
(see
Additional
file
1).
Differences in the bacterial flora between the two buildings were mainly due to OTUs consisting of one sequence;
in all samples, there were 14–27 singletons that explained
66–74% of the variation between buildings. If it is
assumed that occurrence of one sequence type in several
libraries from the same building indicates that it originates from an indoor source, there were few such OTUs
present, and none of them were present in all four samples. With respect to the sequence types that were present
during more than one season, 14 were detected only in
Building 1. These were clones affiliating with Microbacteriaceae, unclassified Frankinae, Rhizobiaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, Staphylococcaceae and
uncultured Firmicutes. The only phylotype in Building 1
detected in three samples had 99% sequence similarity to
Bacillus cereus. In Building 2, there were 13 OTUs detected
only in that building in more than one sample; for four of
them their closest matches were Kocuria palustris (99%),
Aerococcus viridans (99%), uncultured Deinococcus (96%)

and uncultured bacterium from human vagina (98%),
were detected in three samples.

Discussion
The molecular diversity of the bacterial flora in indoor
environment was monitored in two buildings over all
four seasons using 16S rDNA clone libraries derived from
dust samples. As far as we are aware, this is the first study
to have used 16S clone libraries in the characterization of
the indoor dust bacterial flora. Two other papers have
been recently published, one investigating shower curtains and one studying cotton swab surface samples from
a child-care facility [24,25]. In this work, dust was chosen
as the sample material because it is widely used in studies
involving indoor environments and can be considered as
a long-term integrated sample of the pollutants that have
been airborne [27]. The disadvantage of dust samples is
that they are a complex mixture of microbes originating
from many different sources including the outdoor air.
However, this study intended to gather basic information
about the bacterial flora present in an indoor environment with all the possible sources, and dust samples serve
that purpose well. Dust was collected only from hard surfaces, such as hard floor, tables and shelves, since carpets
and textile covered furniture can retain microbes and
interfere with the assessment of seasonal variation. Altogether 893 clone sequences were analyzed and within
them, 283 distinct OTUs were detected using 3%
sequence difference as the criterion. Lee et al. (2007)
sequenced 453 clones in cotton swab samples from a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/56

child-care facility and found 141 bacterial species using
the 3% divergence level, i.e. almost exactly the same proportion as in our study. The Shannon and Simpson diversity indices suggested highest diversity in the spring
samples and lowest in the winter samples in both buildings. The Shannon index gives more weight to the rare
species and Simpson to the dominant [33], but in this
case they were concordant. The ACE and Chao estimators
did not agree with Shannon and Simpson in all cases. The
Chao estimator takes into account only singletons and
doubletons, ACE uses OTUs having one to ten clones each
[34]. The ACE and especially Chao are dependent of the
amount of singletons and the discrepancies with the
diversity indices are most probably due to different
amounts of singletons in the libraries. The estimated coverage of the libraries varied between 19 and 40% when
using the ACE estimator. The coverage values are higher
than those reported for clone libraries from soil, where
library coverages from 7 to 16% have been described
[18,35]. In addition, higher coverages have been reported
with libraries from human sources, e.g. 76–86% [36] and
as high as 99% [20], which may be due to the larger
number of sequenced clones in the latter studies.

two most frequently found species in air samples were
Micrococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. and in addition,
bacteria of the family Streptococcaceae were present in dust
samples. These abundant bacteria most probably originate from the users of the building as these species are typical representatives of the normal flora of human skin,
outer ear and oral cavity [37-40]. Moreover, there was a
multitude of phylotypes affiliating with species or phylotypes abundant in human colon or feces, such as Bacteroidetes,
Clostridium,
members
of
the
family
Peptostreptococcaceae and a number of species not yet cultured. This emphasizes the major human impact on the
indoor dust microbiota, at least in these two buildings.
The high diversity of bacteria from human sources may
also reflect the high occupancy of the buildings by many
different persons. Although the sampled rooms were only
used by the personnel, carryover from the rooms used by
patients may also have occurred. A molecular survey of
aeroplane bacterial contamination revealed that the same
Gram-positive genera; Streptococcus, Staphylococcus,
Corynebacterium Propionibacterium and Kocuria that are
common in indoor dust are present in the indoor air and
surfaces of aeroplanes [41].

In both buildings investigated in this work, the estimated
OTU number was about 500 using 97% sequence identity
as the criterion in DOTUR (Distance-based OTU and richness), and the pooled sequence data from all four samples
taken from that building. The ACE estimate for the individual libraries varied from 147 to 305. The individual
libraries harboured many sequence types unique to that
library, so the pooled data set including all seasons provides a better estimate of the total diversity in that building than a single sample. In clone libraries, with
increasing numbers of sequences, the number of OTUs
increases, until saturation is reached. For the pooled datasets, the saturation in the estimated total OTU number
was more or less achieved, for Building 1 better than for
Building 2, as shown in the collector's curves. Thus, 500
OTUs represent a relatively good estimate of the number
of bacterial species in house dust.

Approximately 40% of the OTUs were of Gram-negative
origin. The most abundant families in this study were
Sphingomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae
and Rhizobiaceae. These bacteria are common in the soil
and rhizosphere, however, some species, such as S. maltophilia, are potential pathogens. In the study of Bouillard
et al. (2005), Gram-negative species accounted for approximately one-third of the total bacterial strains isolated
from air, dust and surface samples of an office building,
with the two dominant species being Pantoea sp., S. maltophilia and Pseudomonas putida. On the contrary, the culture-independent studies have suggested that Gramnegative species are more abundant than the Gram-positive species. Lee et al. (2007) found that Pseudomonas- and
Oxalobacteraceae-like sequences were the most abundant
in their clone libraries from a child-care facility. This may
be due to the different DNA extraction method used; in
our study, we used bead-beating, whereas Lee et al. used
enzymatic cell lysis, which is a more gentle method and
may favour extraction of the DNA from gram negative
bacteria. The bead beating time used in the DNA extraction protocol may also affect the observed community
composition [42]. Gram-negative bacteria of the orders
Burkholderiales and Sphingomonadales were more readily
detected with a microarray after 5s bead beating. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria were better detected after 45s
bead beating [42]. The differences can also be attributable
to the different sample types; the swab samples taken
from toy and furniture surfaces in the study of Lee et al.
(2007) probably harboured mostly bacteria able to form
biofilms on these surfaces. In addition, Kelley at al.

Bacterial diversity in house dust
In our study, Gram-positive bacteria, especially bacteria of
the phylum Firmicutes dominated the flora. This is in
accordance with culture-based studies made in indoor
environments. The most frequently encountered
sequences in this work originated from species of the genera Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus and
Streptococcus. In a study of indoor air of residential buildings, staphylococci accounted for 16–37% of the culturable bacteria, depending on the room where samples had
been taken [9], i.e. the proportion was highest in the bedroom and lowest in the basement. Bouillard et al. (2005)
investigated healthy office buildings, and found that the

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:56

(2004) reported that Sphingomonas spp. and Methylobacterium spp. were frequently present in biofilms on shower
curtains. These genera were also found in this study, in
both buildings, which suggests that they are members of
the normal microflora of buildings.
Seasonal dynamics
Information about the seasonal variation is important for
any exposure assessment. To date, most of the published
information about seasonal variation of microbial flora in
indoor environments has concentrated on viable counts
of fungi, and to a lesser extent, on bacteria. Viable fungal
concentrations in house dust are known to vary between
seasons [32], however the seasonal variation of the viable
flora at the species level is not very clear [31]. The first
study using molecular methods to investigate the seasonal
variation of fungal flora in indoor environments has been
recently conducted by Pitkäranta et al. [43]. Seasonal variation of indoor bacterial concentrations has been studied
using air samples. The study by Reponen et al. (1992)
showed that although the indoor air counts of fungi were
significantly lower in wintertime than during other seasons, airborne bacteria did not exhibit an equally clear
seasonal pattern [44]. Moschandreas et al. (2003) found
that total concentrations of cultivable bacteria in indoor
air of 20 homes in the Chicago area were highest in summer and fall [9].

We investigated the seasonal variation of the bacterial
flora using statistical tools. The two programs used for the
analyses, web-Libshuff and Unifrac-significance, gave
rather similar outcomes and only in a few cases contradictory results. In Building 1, only the winter sample differed
from the other samples when using the Libshuff analysis.
Unifrac detected a statistically significant difference
between all seasons, except for spring and summer. In
Building 2, both programs detected differences between
some seasons, but they were not highly significant. These
findings are supported by the Unifrac cluster environments and PCA analyses, in which the seasons were not
clearly distinguished apart from the Building 1 winter
sample Building 2 summer sample. The clear distinction
of the Building 1 winter sample is mainly due to dominance of one OTU type in the library having 99%
sequence similarity to Serratia fonticola, a member of the
enterobacterial group, and so represented a buildingdriven trend, rather than seasonal. The dominance of this
OTU may reflect a temporary source present at the time of
the sampling, or it may be a bias inherent in polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-technology. It is known that some
sequences may be preferentially amplified in PCR resulting in a higher dominance of these sequences in the
library [45]. To prevent this phenomenon, all amplifications were done in 10 replicates and the number of cycles
was kept low. Since S. fonticola was observed only in one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/56

sample, we assume that it represented a temporary source.
In the PCA analysis, 19% of the variation between samples was explained by the season and 15% by the building. However, the seasonal difference is driven by the
winter sample of Building 1, which has the above mentioned problems and otherwise the differences were not
very large. The comparisons between buildings were all
statistically significant and the seasons of the same buildings also clustered together, thus it does seem that the differences between buildings are more consistent. Although
the seasonal variation could not be clearly demonstrated
with the statistical methods used, a strong seasonal variation existed at the species level, since more than 75% of
the OTUs detected in one building were present in only
one season. The statistical methods are based on evolutionary distances; Libshuff uses a distance matrix and Unifrac a phylogenetic tree as the input, and probably reflect
better changes in the community structure than differences on species level.
Comparison of the samples at a higher taxonomic level to
some extent revealed an increase in the relative abundance of alpha- and betaproteobacteria towards summer
at the expense of low GC Gram-positive bacteria. The proportion of low GC Gram-positive bacteria and gammaproteobacteria in the total diversity was highest in
winter, that of actinobacteria, alpha- and betaproteobacteria in spring or summer, and finally the diversity of
bacteroidetes peaked in the autumn. This may reflect the
diverse sources of these bacteria and their fluctuating
impact on the indoor microbial flora. The species of the
phyla Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes
detected in this study contained mostly those that are normal inhabitants of the human body [1]. Since the proportion of low GC Gram-positive bacteria and
gammaproteobacteria was highest in winter, it seems that
the human impact on the microbial flora is highest in
winter. Alternatively, the human impact is constant, but
during other seasons outdoor factors have a greater influence on the microbiota. Some of the actinobacterial phylotypes encountered, such as P. acnes and some
corynebacteria, are most probably of human origin, but
other types detected in spring and summer samples, such
as OTUs similar to the genera Frigoribacterium, Subtercola
and Plantibacter may have originated from outdoor
sources. This, as well as the increasing number of Alphaand Betaproteobacterial sequences in spring and summer
perhaps reflected the higher impact of outdoor sources in
spring and summer. The results are concordant with the
seasonal variation of fungal flora in the same samples
[43]. In subarctic climate, the ground is covered by snow
in winter and microbial concentrations in the outdoor air
are lower than during other seasons. Because of the cold,
the windows are also not opened in winter as much as
during other seasons. So, the outdoor air affects less the

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:56

indoor environments in winter, and the indoor sources
(human, etc.) can be better detected.
Comparison of the buildings
The two buildings chosen for the study were similar in
age, building frame, ventilation type, use and rural location. The main difference between the buildings was their
different status with respect to moisture damage and perceived indoor air quality. A statistical comparison of the
two buildings suggested that there were significant differences in the microbial flora of the buildings, apart from
the spring samples. The differences in the microbiota of
the buildings were mainly driven by singletons. Against
that background we cannot say if the observed differences
are a reflection of a too small number of clones
sequenced, or real differences. Both buildings had bacterial taxa that were typical for that building, and which
were detected during more than one season. Some of
these are likely linked with the inhabitants of the building
(Staphylococcus, Clostridium, Aerococcus) and some are
known to associate with plants (Frankinae, Rhizobiaceae)
and thus, may be from outdoor sources or indoor plants.
B. cereus and the family Oxalobacteraceae present in Building 1 were the only OTUs that could be associated with
the moisture damaged building. To date, the sole bacterial
group that has been associated with moisture damage is
the group of spore-forming actinomycetes [46,47]. Sporeforming actinomycetes were found in this study as singletons in some of the libraries; and thus it was not possible
to draw a direct connection to the building. B. cereus has
been isolated from indoor dust of schools and day-care
centres [48]. Bacilli and oxalotrophic bacteria are known
to colonise fungal hyphae in soil [49]. In theory, these
bacteria could be evidence of fungal growth in the building, but for the present, this remains only a hypothesis. In
general, because only two buildings were investigated in
this study, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the
effect of moisture damage on the bacterial flora in this
material.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this work demonstrated that the microbial
flora of indoor dust was complex and dominated by
Gram-positive species. The dominant phylotypes most
probably originated from users of the building. A seasonal
variation was observed, this being reflected in the proportional changes of the microbial phyla as well as at the species level. Statistical methods did not detect clear
differences between seasons. The microflora of the two
investigated buildings differed statistically and differences
between the buildings were more pronounced than the
differences noted between seasons.
This work provided basic information about bacterial
diversity in indoor dust and its seasonal dynamics and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/56

hence, qualitative information about the total bacterial
exposure in indoor environments. Future work should
include a characterisation of the different sources of
microbes in indoor dust and a quantitative assessment of
the different microbial taxa.

Methods
Dust sampling
Dust samples were taken from office rooms of two buildings located in small towns in central Finland about 100
km apart. The buildings were chosen based on their similar age, structure, usage and willingness to participate in
the study. A technical inspection was performed in both
buildings by a trained civil engineer. Both buildings were
brick-framed, had two floors in addition to a basement
floor, which was partly underground, and a mechanical
exhaust ventilation system. Both were used as nursing
homes for the elderly. The sampling was done during the
year 2003, and the temperature varied in central Finland
as follows: in winter (January-March) the average
monthly temperature was -15°C to -2°C, in spring (AprilMay) +1°C to +10°C, in summer (June-August) +13°C to
+21°C and in fall (September-November) +1°C to
+11°C. The values are average monthly temperatures
measured at Kuopio airport. The Buildings 1 and 2 were
located within 60 km radius from the weather station at
the airport.

Building 1 was built around 1920, and no substantial
repairs had been done since that time. The basement floor
had undergone some repairs after detection of moisture
and microbial damage on the floor and outer walls in
1999. There were also local signs of moisture and microbial damage in the bathrooms in first and second floor.
The first floor of the building served as a nursing home
and the second floor as a ward of the health centre, housing mostly elderly patients. The employees in the building
complained of building-related symptoms and indoor air
problems.
Building 2 was a nursing home built around 1940 and
which had undergone a thorough restoration 1982. No
visible signs of moisture or microbial damage were
detected, apart from minor signs in the washroom. The
users of the building did not report any problems related
to the building or indoor air.
The sampling was performed in the office rooms located
on the second floor in both buildings. In both buildings,
the sampled rooms had workplaces for two or three persons; however, several other individuals visited the rooms
every day. For one sample, settled dust was collected for 2
months, twice a week, from the hard floor and other hard
surfaces, such as bookshelves and the tops of cupboards,
with a vacuum cleaner Miele S371, (Miele & Cie. KG,

Page 10 of 13

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:56

Gütersloh, Germany). Separate vacuum cleaners were
used for each building, and the tubing and nozzle were
cleaned between samples with 70% ethanol. Four samples
were collected from each building, corresponding to the
four seasons. Hair and larger particles were removed by
passing the dust through an autoclaved tea sieve. The
remaining fine dust was divided into aliquots and stored
at -20°C.
DNA isolation
Duplicate DNA isolations were conducted from 25 mg of
dust using GenElute™ Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit
(Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh, Steinheim, Germany).
The sample was weighed into a 2 ml screw cap tube with
0.5 g of 0.1 mm glass beads (BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA), 400 µl of lysis solution was added,
and the cells were disrupted with Mini Beadbeater-8
(BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) for 1 min at
maximum speed. The released DNA was purified with the
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. An additional purification step was performed with a Wizard
DNA Clean up column (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
and the DNA was eluted in 50 µl of nuclease free water.
The replicates were combined to give 100 µl of DNA originating from 50 mg of dust.
Construction of clone libraries and sequencing
Universal PCR amplification of the full length bacterial
16S rRNA gene was carried out using primers pA and pH',
which target the regions 8–24 and 1522–1542 of the E.
coli 16S rRNA gene, respectively [50]. Ten parallel reactions and negative controls containing nuclease free water
instead of DNA in a volume of 50 µl were carried out
under the following conditions: 1 × Biotools buffer (B&M
Labs, Madrid, Spain), 200 µM each dNTP, 0.2 µM each
primer, 5% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.5 mM Betaine,
2.5 U Biotools DNA polymerase (B&M Labs, Madrid,
Spain), 0.05 U Pfu polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) and 1 µl DNA template. PCR amplification was carried out under the following cycling parameters: initial
denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles of
30 s at 96°C, 45 s at 55°C, and 2 min 30 s at 72°C, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified with Wizard PCR preps (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) and checked in agarose gel electrophoresis.

Immediately before ligation the purified PCR products
were incubated in 72°C for 30 min in the following reaction mix: F-516 DyNAzyme PCR Buffer (Finnzymes,
Espoo, Finland), dNTPs and DyNAzyme DNA Polymerase
(Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) in concentrations mentioned above. Using PCR Cloning Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, 4
µl aliquots of PCR products were ligated and cloned into

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/56

the competent E. coli provided in the kit. Minimum 192
white colonies per library were picked and grown overnight in 1 ml of LB-broth [51] containing 150 µg/ml ampicillin. Aliquots of clone cultures were stored with 15%
glycerol at -80°C and plasmids were extracted from the
remaining culture using MultiScreen 96PLASMID Plates
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Inserts were re-amplified
with universal forward and reverse primers targeting the
vector sequences flanking the insert. PCR products were
visualised in 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining and purified with MultiScreen 384PCR-plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
Purified fragments were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with internal primers pD', pE
and pF'. Sequencing reactions were run on ABI3700 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA).
Sequence analysis
Sequences were edited and assembled using Pregap and
Gap4 programs of the Staden Package [52]. Full length
sequences excluding primer sites were aligned against
EMBL DNA databases using Fasta 3.4 [53]. Sequences having less than 95% similarity to known sequences were
checked for chimeras using the chimera detection available at the Ribosomal Database project website [54]. Multiple alignments of the sequences were constructed using
AlignX program of the VectorNTI package (InforMax Inc.,
Bethesda, USA). ClustalW and DNADIST program available in the PHYLIP package [55] were utilised to construct
a distance matrix that was used as an input in the DOTURprogram, which was used for defining OTUs at a distance
level of 3%.

Sample coverages and species richness estimates were calculated using the DOTUR program [23]. The program calculates various diversity indices and species richness
estimators at different distance levels. The estimates were
calculated separately for each season and building sample
as well as for a pooled sample containing the libraries
from both buildings collected during one season and
thus, representing that season.
The sequence libraries obtained from each building and
season were compared using web-Libshuff version 0.96
and Unifrac. Web-Libshuff is a web-based version of the
Libshuff program [21]. The program compares two
sequence libraries to determine if they differ significantly
from each other. The program calculates a homologous
and a heterologous coverage curve for the libraries, uses
Cramér von Mises statistic to calculate the distance
between the two curves and Monte Carlo test procedure to
compare them. Unifrac can compare several libraries at

the same time and can also be used to visualise relationships between environments [22]. The two buildings were
compared for each season and the seasons were compared
within each building.
