Differential phylogenetic expansions in BAHD
acyltransferases across five angiosperm taxa and
evidence of divergent expression among Populus
paralogues
Lindsey K Tuominen1, Virgil E Johnson1,2 and Chung-Jui Tsai1,2*

Abstract
Background: BAHD acyltransferases are involved in the synthesis and elaboration of a wide variety of secondary
metabolites. Previous research has shown that characterized proteins from this family fall broadly into five major
clades and contain two conserved protein motifs. Here, we aimed to expand the understanding of BAHD
acyltransferase diversity in plants through genome-wide analysis across five angiosperm taxa. We focus particularly
on Populus, a woody perennial known to produce an abundance of secondary metabolites.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis of putative BAHD acyltransferase sequences from Arabidopsis, Medicago, Oryza,
Populus, and Vitis, along with previously characterized proteins, supported a refined grouping of eight major clades
for this family. Taxon-specific clustering of many BAHD family members appears pervasive in angiosperms. We
identified two new multi-clade motifs and numerous clade-specific motifs, several of which have been implicated
in BAHD function by previous structural and mutagenesis research. Gene duplication and expression data for
Populus-dominated subclades revealed that several paralogous BAHD members in this genus might have already
undergone functional divergence.
Conclusions: Differential, taxon-specific BAHD family expansion via gene duplication could be an evolutionary
process contributing to metabolic diversity across plant taxa. Gene expression divergence among some Populus
paralogues highlights possible distinctions between their biochemical and physiological functions. The newly
discovered motifs, especially the clade-specific motifs, should facilitate future functional study of substrate and
donor specificity among BAHD enzymes.

Background
BAHD acyltransferases make up a large family of
enzymes responsible for acyl-CoA dependent acylation
of secondary metabolites, typically resulting in the formation of esters and amides. In a foundational paper,
St. Pierre & De Luca [1] named the family after the
first four characterized members (BEAT or benzylalcohol O-acetyltransferase from Clarkia breweri; AHCTs
or anthocyanin O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferases from
Petunia, Senecio, Gentiana, Perilla, and Lavandula;
HCBT or anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/

benzoyltransferase from Dianthus caryophyllus; DAT
or deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase from Catharanthus roseus). Currently, the BAHD family encompasses over sixty biochemically characterized members
in plant taxa ranging from gymnosperms to monocots
to legumes. Previous work has shown that these
enzymes may be involved in synthesis or modification
of such diverse metabolites as alkaloids, terpenoids and
phenolics, with ecophysiological roles in minimizing
cuticular water loss, defending against herbivory, and
attracting pollinators (reviewed in [2]).
The BAHD family has been previously organized into
five major phylogenetic clades, using 46 biochemically
or genetically characterized members [2]. This classification revealed both clade-specific and clade-independent

biochemical activities among family members. For
example, benzoyl-CoA donor utilization so far appears
to be limited to Clade V, while hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
has been reported as a donor for members in multiple
clades [2]. Substrate specificity typically varies among
clades, and sometimes within clade as well. For example,
Clade I members act mainly upon flavonoids, while
Clade V members utilize substrates ranging from terpenoids to medium-chain alcohols to quinic acid, in association with major phylogenetic branches within this
clade [2]. Similar diversity of function was also noted for
Clade III members, which are involved in formation of
alkaloids, esters, and flavonoids, but functional association was less clear due to the smaller size of subclades
in this branch. This highlights both the diversity of the
BAHD family and the potential challenge of phylogenybased functional inference with limited sequence and/or
species representation.
Most functionally characterized BAHD acyltransferases share two conserved motifs, HXXXD and
DFGWG [2]. The conservation of these motifs has facilitated in silico identification of BAHD acyltransferases
from available genome sequences [3,4]. The HXXXD
motif is also found in other thioester CoA-utilizing acyltransferase families [1] and is absolutely conserved
among BAHD acyltransferases. Its importance for catalysis was first established by site-directed mutagenesis
[5,6]. Crystallographic analysis of the chrysanthemum
(Dendranthema × morifolium) malonyltransferase
Dm3MaT3 provided the structural basis for the catalytic
role of the His residue in malonyl-CoA binding [7]. The
importance of the DFGWG motif, which is highly but
not absolutely conserved, for enzyme activity was first
shown in a Salvia malonyltransferase [5] and a Rauvolfia vinorine synthase [6] based on mutagenesis studies
of the Asp residue. However, structural analysis of
Dm3MaT3 suggested that this Asp residue most likely
plays a structural, rather than catalytic, role in enzyme
function [7]. Coupling the structural analysis with mutagenesis studies of two other malonyltransferases from
the same species also revealed a greater structural diversity of acyl acceptor binding sites relative to the acylCoA donor binding sites [7]. This is consistent with the
known broad range of acceptor molecules and relatively
narrow range of acyl-donors utilized by different BAHD
acyltransferases [2].
Despite the prevalence of BAHD acyltransferases in
plants, cross-genome analysis of this family is lacking.
Genome-wide analyses of this family have recently been
reported for Arabidopsis and Populus[3,4], but only in a
single-taxon context. We sought to explore BAHD acyltransferase diversity from an evolutionary perspective,
with a primary focus in Populus due to its ability to
synthesize a broad array of secondary metabolites. The

most abundant of these metabolites are the phenylpropanoid-derived non-structural phenolics known to play
significant roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses in
this genus [8,9]. The diversity of Populus phenylpropanoids (e.g., hydroxycinnamate derivatives, flavonoids,
condensed tannins and salicylate-containing phenolic
glycosides) can be attributed in large part to side-chain
modifications, such as glycosylation, methylation, and
acylation [8]. We therefore used a phylogenomic
approach to develop an updated phylogeny of the Populus BAHD acyltransferase family in reference to four
other angiosperm taxa. Together with gene duplication
and expression analyses, our data suggest that lineagespecific gene duplication is a key process in BAHD
family evolution. The results are consistent with a role
of the BAHD acyltransferases in diversifying the secondary metabolite repertoire in plants.

Results
Populus Has More BAHD Acyltransferase Genes Than
Arabidopsis, Medicago, Oryza, and Vitis

BLASTP searches against the JGI Populus trichocarpa
genome release v1.1 revealed 149 unique loci with high
similarity to biochemically characterized BAHD acyltransferases from a previous review [2]. Manual curation
and referencing against the recently released genome
v2.0 were conducted to exclude loci lacking a conserved
motif (HXXXD or DFGWG), loci that represented
redundant, possibly allelic copies, and loci resembling
spurious gene models (see Methods). The final list of
100 putative Populus BAHD acyltransferases was used
for all subsequent analyses and annotation (Additional
File 1: SupplementalTable1.xls). In the course of our
work, another group also annotated the BAHD family in
Populus[3] and reported 94 putative gene models. These
models correspond to 74 putative BAHD genes on our
list, with one model that matched two v2.0 gene models
on our list; the 21 remaining models were either redundant or rejected based on our manual curation criteria
(Additional File 1). Similar BLAST search and quality
control measures were also performed for the genomes
of Arabidopsis, Medicago, Oryza, and Vitis, producing
final lists of 55, 50, 84, and 52 putative BAHD genes,
respectively (Additional File 2: SupplementalTable2.xls).
These lists include ten biochemically characterized Arabidopsis members and one biochemically characterized
Medicago member (see Additional File 2 for references).
Phylogenetic Analysis Supports Eight Major Clades of
Plant BAHD Acyltransferases

Phylogenetic relationships among the BAHD acyltransferases were reconstructed using a maximum-likelihood
algorithm, for a collection of 69 biochemically characterized plant BAHD acyltransferases and the putative

members from Populus, Arabidopsis, Oryza, Medicago,
and Vitis (Figure 1A). The resulting phylogenetic tree is
broadly consistent with that of D’Auria [2], who sorted
biochemically characterized BAHD acyltransferases into
five major groups. Our expanded analysis suggests that
a grouping of eight major clades is now warranted, a
finding consistent with previous, single-genome-based,
neighbour-joining analyses [3,4,10]. In particular, a
strongly-supported clade comprised entirely of BAHD
acyltransferases lacking biochemical characterization
data was sister to the group of proteins previously designated as Clade I by D’Auria [2]. To maintain consistency, we adopted a similar clade nomenclature, and
name the previous and the “new” groups as Clades Ia
and Ib, respectively. Clades Ia and Ib correspond respectively to the Populus clades Vb+Vc and Va, and to the
Arabidopsis clades IIb and IIa reported by Yu et al. [3].
Another strongly supported clade containing the Petunia acetyl CoA:coniferyl alcohol acetyltransferase
(CFAT, [11]) was sister to the group classified by
D’Auria as Clade III [2]. We name the previous and the
“new” clades as IIIa and IIIb, respectively; these correspond to the Populus clades IV and II and Arabidopsis
clades IV and IIIa in Yu et al. [3]. Members of the

former Clade V [2] clustered into two well-supported
groups in our analysis, renamed hereafter Clades Va and
Vb. These clades correspond to Yu et al.’s clades Ia and
Ib for both Populus and Arabidopsis[3]. Characterized
proteins in Clade Va tend to be involved in volatile
ester formation, while those in Clade Vb are closely
related to hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCTs) responsible for the synthesis of chlorogenic acid and monolignols. Our analysis also placed Clade IV basal to
Clades Va and Vb, with good support. The remaining
sequences clustered into one strongly supported group
corresponding to D’Auria’s Clade II [2].
The distribution of sequences among the five species
varied within each clade (Figure 1B). Populus and Oryza
have the largest number of BAHD members overall, and
collectively these made up the majority of Clades Ia, Va,
and Vb. Populus also predominated in the dicot-specific
Clade IIIa, while Clade IV was monocot-specific. Taxon
bias was also evident in Clades Ib and IIIb, where Medicago and Vitis, respectively, were over-represented.
When analyzed by species, Clade Va, the largest clade,
remained the largest group in all taxa, except in Medicago where Clade Ib predominated (Figure 1C). Clades
II, IIIb, and IV had the lowest representations overall,
consistent with their small overall sizes. The major
exception to this pattern was Vitis, which showed a relatively higher representation of Clade IIIb, coinciding
with a much lower representation of Clade Ia. Other
species-biased patterns included high (>20%) representation for Clade IIIa in Populus, Clade Ib in Arabidopsis,
and Clade Ia in Oryza.
Closer examination of the phylogeny revealed that
BAHD sequences from a single taxon tended to cluster
together, especially within the larger clades. In Clade Ia,
all sequences from the five taxa formed lineage-specific
groups with strong bootstrap support, except for one
well-supported subgroup (Figure 2, bracket). Oryza
sequences were basal to all eudicot sequences in this
clade. Two strongly-supported subclades consisting of a
combined total of sixteen Populus sequences comprised
another large, but in this case weakly-supported, group,
sister to a group of eight Arabidopsis sequences, including a malonyl CoA:cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside transferase
(At5MaT, [4,10]; Figure 2). Similar, but less dramatic
patterns were observed for Clade Ib (Additional File 3:
SupplementalFigure1.png). While the two most basal
subgroups in this clade did not show strong taxon specificity, the two remaining subgroups each comprised five
taxon-specific branches with strong support (Additional
File 3). In accordance with its overrepresentation overall
in Clade Ib, Medicago exhibited substantial taxon-specific expansions within these two branches.
Taxon-specific clustering appeared more scattered in
Clade IIIa, perhaps because the larger of the two major

subclade containing seven of the nine Arabidopsis
sequences in Clade IIIa also had high bootstrap support.
As the largest phylogenetic group, Clade Va contained
a number of highly-derived branches, some specific to
gymnosperms, monocots, or dicots (Figure 4). The largest well-supported branch in this clade contained four
taxon-specific clusters of at least seven members (Figure
4, boxed), one each for Vitis (eight members), Populus
(seven), Medicago (nine), and Oryza (eleven). Oryza
sequences were over-represented in this clade and fell
mainly into two large branches with moderate bootstrap
support. One was Oryza-specific as mentioned above,
and the other contained three eudicot sequences (Figure
4). Taxon-specific clustering was not as evident in
Clade Vb, except for a well-supported branch of seven
Oryza sequences, sister to a group of hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCT/HQT) involved in biosynthesis
of lignin, chlorogenic acid, and other phytoalexins
(Additional File 3).
Clade II lacked species-specific clustering patterns, as
members were more evenly distributed among species

exhibited some degree of taxon-specific clustering. The
largest such grouping comprised nine Vitis sequences,
consistent with their overrepresentation in this clade
(Additional File 3). A four-member subclade of Oryza
sequences and a three-member subclade each for Arabidopsis and Medicago were also evident. Clade IV was
the smallest clade and was restricted to monocots, as
mentioned previously.
With regard to Populus, species-specific expansion
was evidenced within Clades Ia, IIIa and Va. Because
the Populus-specific subgroup in Clade Ia is most closely related to several biochemically characterized malonyltransferases from Arabidopsis, Medicago, and Glycine,
we have named members of this clade as malonyltransferase-like (MATLs). The sequences in the Populus-specific branch are MATL1-14 and 16-17. We designated
all Populus sequences in Clade IIIa as alcohol acyltransferase-like (AATLs), after the numerous characterized
alcohol acyltransferases within that clade. The Populusspecific branch includes AATL1, 3, 7-9, 18-19, and 2224. We refer to the three Populus clusters within the
largest branch of Group Va by three names. First, we
named the set of four Populus sequences clustering with
two Malus sequences and a set of Vitis sequences,
including an anthraniloyl-CoA:methanol acyltransferase
from Vitis labrusca (VlAMAT, [13]), as AMAT-like
(AMATLs). Next, we refer to the six Populus proteins
most closely related to the Arabidopsis acetyl CoA:cis-3hexen-1-ol acetyl transferase [14] as CHAT-like
(CHATLs). Finally, the subgroup of seven Populus
sequences that fell into a poorly-resolved region of
Clade Va, most closely to a tigloyl-CoA:(-)-13a-hydroxymultiflorine/(+)-13a-hydroxylupanine O-tigloyltransferase from Lupinus (LaHMT/HLT, [15]), were named
HMT-like (HMTLs).
New Family-wide and Clade-Specific Motifs are Present in
BAHD Acyltransferases

The large number of BAHD genes available from
sequenced plant genomes presents an opportunity to
expand the analysis of conserved motifs in this family
beyond the two known functional domains, HXXXD
and DFGWG. We subjected sequences from each clade
to motif analysis using MINER v2.0 [16-18]. Clades II
and IV were excluded from the analysis due to their
small sizes. Using a sequence window of five amino
acids and the default z-score threshold, four to nine
motifs were predicted for each clade (Figure 5, Additional File 4: SupplementaryFigure2.pdf). MINER identified the DFGWG motif in four of the six tested clades

(Ia, Ib, IIIa, and Va). Although it did not meet the
MINER threshold, visual inspection revealed high conservation of this motif in Clades IIIb and Vb as well
(Figure 5). This supports the validity of our approach
towards the identification of conserved motifs. The
HXXXD motif escaped detection by MINER, but this
was expected since the motif contains a variable core.
Two new motifs were identified with multi-clade conservation. The first motif had a consensus of YPLAGR
beginning around position 71-78, and was predicted in
Clades IIIa, Va, and Vb. Manual inspection of the other
clades identified a similar motif in this region, but with
notable variability from the consensus, especially for the
two flanking residues (Figure 5). The second motif had
a consensus of QVTX(F/L)XCGG around position 136156 and was predicted in Clades Ib, IIIa, and Va. Manual inspection revealed that QVT was highly conserved
in the other three clades, but CGG was poorly conserved in Clades Ia and Ib (Figure 5). Clade-specific
motifs were also observed, several of which were located
near the N-terminus of the protein: the LTFFD motif

from Clade Ia was located at positions 33-37, the
IKPSSPTP motif of Clade IIIa at positions 11-18, and
SNLDL from Clade Vb at positions 25-29 (Figure 5).
Because the N-terminus often contains targeting peptide
sequences, we examined the predicted protein subcellular localization patterns by clade using three different
prediction programs. However, we found no evidence
for a link between the observed clade-specific N-terminal motifs and the predicted subcellular targeting of the
BAHD proteins (Additional File 5: SupplementaryFigure3.pdf).
Although Clade II was too small for motif analysis, we
note that none of its members would have been
accepted using our initial search criteria (both HXXXD
and DFGWG present). The two original clade members,
ZmGlossy2 and AtCER2, are known to participate in
cuticular wax biosynthesis based exclusively on genetic
characterization studies [19-21]. In the absence of biochemical data, it remains debatable as to whether Clade
II members should be considered true BAHD
acyltransferases.

Multiple Gene Duplication Types Have Contributed To
BAHD Family Expansion in the Populus Genome

Populus has experienced at least two genome-wide
duplication events, the salicoid event approximately 6065 MYA and the older eudicot triplication event, as well
as numerous segmental and tandem duplication events
[22,23]. We sought to determine whether the various
types of gene duplications contributed towards the
expansion of the Populus BAHD family, especially with
regard to Populus-specific subclades (HMTLs, CHATLs,
and subgroups of MATLs and AATLs). Overall, we
found sixty BAHD genes were associated with recent
(salicoid or local) duplications (Additional File 6: SupplementalTable3.xls), accounting for more than half of
the BAHD acyltransferases in Populus (Table 1). This is
broadly consistent with previous analysis of chromosomal location of BAHD acyltransferases in Populus,
which mapped 25 of 58 genes to homeologous chromosome segments or tandem duplication blocks based on
the v1.1 genome release [3]. Events were spread
approximately evenly across the two duplication types,
with a greater number of local (e.g., tandem) duplications overall. Duplications were found in all but the two
smallest clades (II and IIIb). Salicoid and local duplications were overrepresented in Clades Ib, Va, and Vb
relative to the genome overall. Such duplications
impacted every member of Clade Ib (three salicoid pairs,
one local pair and one local triplet), all but two genes in
the largest subclade of Va (Figure 4, boxed; including
two salicoid duplications, three local pairs, one local triplet, and one local quadruplet), and all but one member
of Clade Vb (including two local pairs and two salicoid
pairs; Figure 6, Additional File 6). For two subclades
within the large, poorly resolved region in Clade Va,
multiple local duplications appear to have followed genome-wide duplication events in one of the two salicoid
paralogues (Figure 6, Additional File 6). The first
instance is the relationship between HMTL7 on linkage
group (LG) XI and the HMTL1-6 cluster on LG I. The
second is the relationship between CHATL6 on LG XIX
and the CHATL1-3 triplet on LG XIII.

Although Clade IIIa exhibited several duplications, the
Populus-dominated AATL subclade had just one tandem
pair (AATL23 and AATL24). Clade Ia had the lowest
rate of duplications among the larger clades, with two
local triplets within the Populus-dominated MATL subclade (Table 1). The relatively low numbers of local and
salicoid duplications in the Populus-dominated AATL
and MATL subclades raises the possibility that some of
these genes might have originated through other
mechanisms, such as transposable elements. We therefore searched for the presence of retrotransposons within
the two 10-kb windows flanking either side of each Populus BAHD gene. We found retrotransposon associations
in each clade, covering over one third of the family as a
whole, although the majority of associated genes were
flanked on only one end (Table 1). Retrotransposon associations were frequently observed for recently duplicated
genes (Table 1, Additional File 6). Retrotransposon associations were overrepresented in Clade Va, noted for all
AMATLs and the majority of CHATLs and HMTLs
(Table 1, Additional File 6). However, all of these gene
models contained at least one intron (Additional File 1),
suggesting that retrotransposition is unlikely to be a
direct cause of duplication. Retrotransposon associations
were underrepresented in Clade IIIa and absent from the
AATL Populus-dominated subclade (Table 1, Additional
File 6). Despite its average representation of retrotransposon associations, Clade Ia had the greatest number of
genes with retrotransposons flanking both sides (Table
1). Two such genes, MATL12 and 13, formed a strongly
supported branch with MATL10. All three are located on
LG IV (Figure 6), lack predicted introns (Additional File
1), and share a high degree of nucleotide identity with
one another (98%). Although preliminary, our analysis
suggests that retrotransposons have contributed to the
duplications of some BAHD genes.
Some Recently Duplicated BAHD Acyltransferases are
Differentially Expressed

To investigate expression of Populus BAHD genes, we
mined a set of nine Affymetrix microarray datasets

Figure 6 Locations of Putative Populus BAHD Acyltransferases on Linkage Groups. Homeologous blocks arising from the salicoid genome
duplication event are color-coded across the nineteen linkage groups (chromosomes). BAHD acyltransferases in close proximity to one another
are boxed for ease of labelling. Note that proximity on a linkage group does not, by itself, indicate a close phylogenetic relationship.

encompassing five different genotypes and four different
tissue types generated in our laboratory [24]. After
excluding probes that had consistently low expression
across all samples (see Methods) and annotating probes
based on the POParray database [25], we obtained
expression data for 41 probes corresponding to 48
BAHD genes (some probe sequences match multiple
gene targets, and some gene targets are represented by
multiple probes). Pairwise correlations of BAHD gene
expression across all microarray experiments were computed and the results organized by duplication type
(Additional File 7: SupplementalFigure4.pdf). Median
Spearman rank correlations were significantly different
among the duplication categories according to one-way
ANOVA (p < 0.001). Not surprisingly, median correlations for gene pairs derived from local or salicoid duplications were significantly higher than for other types of
(all possible) gene pairs (Additional File 7).
When the log-transformed microarray data were
visualized as a heatmap, expression across the BAHD
family as a whole was biased towards leaves, and we did
not observe clear differences in expression patterns
among the major clades (Figure 7A). Within the major
clades, genotype- and/or tissue-dependent expression
patterns were evident. For example, root-specific expression dominated in the HMTL subclade, while the

majority of other Clade Va genes showed the more typical leaf-biased expression (Figure 7A). In another case,
HCT1 and HCT6 were relatively uniformly expressed in
all three P. fremontii × angustifolia hybrid genotypes
examined, while HCT5 and HCT7 were detected only in
genotype 1979 (Figure 7A). HCT2, on the other hand,
was most abundant in roots. Expression patterns
diverged for closely related genes in several cases,
including genes within the Populus-dominated subclades. For example, MATL4 was biased towards P. fremontii × angustifolia genotype 1979 relative to MATL13, which were more evenly expressed across genotypes
and tissues. The Populus-dominated AATL subclade
includes AATL3, which was preferentially expressed in
cell suspension cultures, as well as AATL7, 23, and 24,
which exhibited different expression patterns by leaf age
and genotype. The CHATL cluster includes two members (CHATL3 and 6) that were fairly evenly expressed
across sampled tissues, and two (CHATL1 and 2) that
were detected only in leaves. The more divergent
CHATL4/5 were most strongly expressed in non-photosynthetic tissues, yielding an overall pattern that
resembled the HMTLs more than the other CHATLs
(Figure 7A).
QPCR was performed to verify the expression patterns
of closely related CHATL transcripts observed by

Figure 7 Expression of BAHD Acyltransferases in Populus Tissues, Organized by Phylogenetic Relationship. A: Expression of BAHD
acyltransferase genes across tissues and genotypes. B: Stress responses of BAHD acyltransferase gene expression across tissues and genotypes.
Expression data or ratios (stressed vs. control samples) were log-transformed and visualized in heatmaps (see Methods). Genes are organized by
phylogenetic relationship and labelled by the clade color in Figure 1. Genotypes analyzed included: P. fremontii × angustifolia clones 1979, 3200,
and RM5, and P. tremuloides clones 271 and L4. Tissues analyzed included: young leaf (YL), expanding leaf (EL), root tips (R), and suspension cell
cultures (C). Stress treatments included: nitrogen limitation (low N), leaf wounding (wound, sampled either 1 week or 90 hours after wounding),
removal of shoot up to leaf plastochron index three (detop, 90 hours after removal), and methyl jasmonate elicitation (MJ) [24]. White text
indicates that raw hybridization intensity for either control (for upregulated genes) or stressed treatment (for downregulated genes) samples was
below the quantitation limit (see Methods).

microarray analysis, using an independent set of P. tremuloides tissues (Additional File 8: SupplementalFigure5.pdf). Specific primers were designed to distinguish
among the three paralogous pairs with different duplication history (Supplemental Table 2): CHATL1/2,
CHATL3/6 and CHATL4/5. CHATL1/2 were expressed
relatively consistently across all leaf and stem internode
tissues sampled, but were lower in root and flower tissues (near or below the corresponding microarray

threshold marked by a dotted line in Additional File 8,
Panel A). CHATL3/6 were most strongly expressed in
young leaves and roots, followed by apices and mature
leaves, and were much lower in stem and flower tissues.
The transcript levels of CHATL4/5 were very low overall, with the highest levels detected in roots, similar to
the microarray data of P. fremontii × angustifolia. Overall, the QPCR data were broadly consistent with the
microarray results, and support the idea that the three

Tuominen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/236

pairs of CHATL genes have diverged in their expression
patterns despite their high homology.
We next analyzed the microarray data to examine the
responses of BAHD gene expression to four different
stress treatments, including nitrogen limitation, wounding, detopping, or methyl jasmonate feeding, across several tissues and/or genotypes. Again, no clear overall
patterns by clade were observed, and the differential
gene expression patterns observed among some paralogous genes described above also held for the stress
treatments (Figure 7B). Additional evidence of functional divergence was observed. For example, Clade IIIa
member AATL7 showed its strongest upregulation in
young leaves one week after wounding, while the
responses of AATL23 and AATL24 were most drastically
affected via down-regulation in expanding leaves following detopping. The leaf-expressing CHATL genes were
generally up-regulated by nitrogen stress in P. fremontii
× angustifolia genotype 1979, except CHATL6 in
expanding leaves. However, the trend was more variable
in genotype 3200 (Figure 7B), despite similar baseline
expression of these genes between the two genotypes
(Figure 7A). QPCR analysis of the same suite of samples
confirmed this general discrepancy between the two
genotypes (Additional File 8, Panel B), although the
degree of expression changes varied between the two
analytical (microarray vs. QPCR) methods. The data
hint at differential expression among closely related
BAHD genes in response to nitrogen stress between different Populus hybrid genotypes. Future investigation
would help determine how widespread this pattern is
across the BAHD family and a broader range of genotypes in this genus.

Discussion
BAHD Family Expansion as a Factor Enabling Metabolic
Diversification

Across the five angiosperm genomes investigated here,
we observed numerous differential lineage expansions
within the BAHD acyltransferase phylogeny. Examination of retained gene copies following duplications in
Populus revealed that the majority of BAHD genes, at
least in this genus, are associated with recent genomewide as well as local duplication events. An estimated
32% of all v2.0 Populus genes (6655 pairs or 13268
unique gene models) were derived from the salicoid
duplication event [26]. However, only 26% of the Populus BAHD acyltransferases were associated with the salicoid duplication. Tandem or local duplications, on the
other hand, accounted for over one-third (36%) of the
Populus BAHD genes, much higher than the genome
average estimated at 16% [23]. It thus appeared that
local duplications were over-represented and genomewide duplications were under-represented in the

Page 10 of 17

Populus BAHD family relative to the genome average.
We speculate that this pattern may be generally applicable to the other angiosperm genomes surveyed in this
study. Local duplications might be more likely than
polyploidization events to account for the observed
taxon-specific expansions of BAHD acyltransferases.
This was indeed the case for the Populus-dominated
HMTL and CHATL subclades, where the majority of
the genes were derived from local duplications, and to a
much lesser extent, for the MATL subclade. In contrast,
only two of the ten members in the Populus-dominated
subclade among the AATLs were implicated in any
duplication event. Preliminary molecular clock analysis
suggested that the divergence times among members of
the Populus-dominated MATL and AATL subclades
were similar and predated the salicoid duplication event.
This suggests that other duplications, prior to the salicoid duplication event but after the eudicot triplication
event, probably contributed to the Populus-specific
expansion as well.
Previous work has shown that genes involved in stress
responses, including secondary metabolic genes, are
more likely than average to experience lineage-specific
diversification via tandem duplication [27]. When placed
in a metabolic pathway context, we suggest that taxonspecific, local duplication-derived expansion of gene
(sub)families may be characteristic of enzymes that
occupy a terminal or tangential position in a metabolic
pathway. Conversely, enzymes with an intermediate
position in a core pathway would likely retain a more
constant number of gene copies across taxa due to evolutionarily constraint for balanced stoichiometry
between enzymes acting within the same pathway. In
support of this idea, HCTs known to be involved in
intermediate steps of monolignol biosynthesis formed a
multi-taxon cluster within Clade Vb, encoded by 1-2
genes in all sequenced genomes. In Populus, Clade Vb
diversified about equally via salicoid and local duplication events. In contrast, the sister Clade Va exhibited
extensive taxon-specific clustering (boxed region, Figure
4); Populus genes in the major subclade were associated
with more than three times as many local duplications
as retained salicoid duplicates. The biochemically characterized enzymes within this branch are all involved in
the final step of various volatile ester and alkaloid ester
biosynthetic pathways [13-15,28-31].
Taxon-specific phylogenetic expansions have also been
observed within the O-methyltransferase (OMT)
[9,32,33] and glycosyltransferase (GT, especially Group
1) ([34,35], Tsai and Johnson, unpublished) families.
Like BAHD acyltransferases, OMTs and GTs form large
families, and collectively the three are responsible for
the elaboration (acylation, methylation, and glycosylation) of a wide range of secondary metabolites [2,8].

Tuominen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/236

These modifications increase the diversity of natural
products, with regard to both their chemical structures
and biological activities, and they hold chemotaxonomic
value due to their taxon-specificity [36-38]. Studies from
the OMT and GT1 families have shown that many of
these enzymes possess promiscuous substrate specificity
[39,40]. This, coupled with the tendency of taxon-specific diversification of some of the subfamily members,
may be a means to afford metabolic plasticity. Consistent with this idea, multifunctional OMTs from Thalictrum tuberosum formed a taxon-specific subclade, while
those with a limited substrate range formed multi-taxon
subclades [33]. In the case of BAHD acyltransferases,
numerous biochemically characterized Clade Va members involved in volatile ester biosynthesis have been
shown to accept multiple substrates and/or donors, at
least in vitro [13-15,28,30,31]. Many of these were found
in the same subclade where taxon-specific diversification
was common (Figure 4, boxed region). These data
further support the view that differential lineage expansions of the BAHD family may be linked to taxon-specific metabolic diversification.
Implications of Divergent Paralogue Expression and
Newly Identified Conserved Motifs for BAHD
Acyltransferase Function

Given the extent of gene duplications in the Populus
BAHD family, it was not surprising that many of the
closely related members retained similar expression
patterns. This, however, was not universal, as we noted
for the CHATLs, especially in stressed tissues. While
genes with high sequence similarity are likely to have
similar biochemical functions, the differential expression patterns observed here suggest that physiological
functions might have already diverged for some recent
duplicates. Our examination of BAHD acyltransferase
expression in P. fremontii × angustifolia and P. tremuloides under various stress conditions builds upon the
previous analysis in P. trichocarpa by Yu et al. [3].
Overall, these results are broadly consistent in that
BAHD expression was generally much stronger in
photosynthetic than non-photosynthetic tissues. In the
present study, the expression bias towards leaves was
generally consistent across genotypes. Relatively little
difference was observed between genotypes under control conditions, but differences became evident under
stress. Biotic and abiotic stresses are known to influence the relative proportions of secondary metabolites
in Populus (reviewed by [9,41]), and different genotypes differ in both secondary metabolite diversity and
quantities [37,38]. The variety of BAHD expression
patterns in stressed tissues, either among recently
duplicated genes, between closely related genotypes or
during leaf development, is consistent with a role for

Page 11 of 17

BAHD genes in regulating secondary metabolite accumulation and diversity in Populus.
The two known conserved motifs in BAHD acyltransferases, HXXXD and DFGWG, have been implicated in
the binding of the acyl-CoA donor and in the structural
integrity of the enzyme-donor complex, respectively
[5-7]. Our analysis revealed two new motifs, YPLAGR
and QVTX(F/L)XCGG, that were conserved across multiple clades. The YPLAGR motif corresponds to the
small a-helix-3 (a-3) on the crystal structure of vinorine
synthase [42], but no mutagenesis analysis targeting this
region has yet been conducted. The lower conservation
of this motif in Clade Ia is correlated with a lack of this
a-helix and an extra string of 9-14 residues [7], positioned between the corresponding Gly and Arg residues
of the YPLAGR motif on the Clade IIIa enzyme vinorine
synthase [42]. The QVTX(F/L)XCGG motif is eight
amino acids upstream of the HXXXD motif, spanning
b-6 and b-7 of vinorine synthase [42], or b-9 and b-10
of Dm3MaT3 [7]. Previous work in vinorine synthase
[6] has established the functional importance of the Cys
residue in the QVTX(F/L)XCGG motif. A Cys-to-Ala
point mutation reduced enzymatic activity by 90%, an
impact only exceeded by mutation of the His or Asp
residues in HXXXD [6]. Functional support for several
clade-specific motifs can also be garnered. The LTFFD
motif conserved in Clade Ia maps to a-1 on the
Dm3MaT3 crystal structure, near the acyl acceptor
binding site [7]. Site-directed mutagenesis of three adjacent a-1 residues on Dm3MaT1 reduced enzyme activity [7], supporting the importance of this motif. Another
Clade Ia-specific motif, YFGNC (Additional File 4), is
thought to be involved in anthocyanin acyltransferase
interactions with malonyl-CoA [7]. Site-directed mutagenesis of vinorine synthase targeting the first Ser residue in the IKPSSPTP motif [6] has also implicated its
role in Clade IIIa enzyme function. Given the reported
structural diversity of the acyl acceptor binding sites [7],
they are more likely to exhibit sequence conservation by
clade. In this regard, the suite of clade-specific motifs
that we identified should be of value in future structural
modelling and mutagenesis studies to understand the
diverse enzyme functions in the large BAHD acyltransferase family.

Conclusions
Our phylogenomic analysis expanded and improved
upon the previous BAHD family phylogeny, highlighting
two major clades for which almost no biochemical data
has yet been generated. Our analysis also identified
striking patterns of differential expansion of the BAHD
family across five angiosperm taxa, including numerous
taxon-specific subclades. This finding may provide a
basis for understanding the differentiation of secondary

Tuominen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/236

metabolism across taxa. Examining clusters of homologous genes within Populus demonstrated that tandem
gene duplication has been an important evolutionary
force for BAHD diversification within this genus, particularly with respect to two lineage-specific expansions.
The retention of salicoid duplicates and likely retrotransposition events have also contributed to the large number of BAHD genes in this taxon. Microarray analysis
showed diversity of gene expression among some highly
homologous genes in Populus, suggesting that some
recently duplicated BAHD paralogues have undergone
functional divergence in this genus. The discovery of
two multi-clade conserved protein motifs as well as
clade-specific motifs supports previous research on
BAHD enzyme structure and biochemical function,
while opening the door to future investigation on the
structural basis of donor and substrate specificity within
and between clades.

Methods
Identification of Putative BAHD family members

Published BAHD acyltransferase sequences [2] were
used in initial BLASTP searches against the JGI Populus
trichocarpa genome v1.1 [23]. Because multiple in silico
gene prediction programs were used in v1.1, gene models were manually examined for possible structural
annotation errors, and to select alternate models if
necessary. Gene models located in unanchored short (<
20 kb) scaffolds often represent redundant sequences
due to sequence quality or assembly artefacts [25].
When used in BLASTN searches against the Populus
genome, all putative BAHD sequences from the short
scaffolds had high similarity to at least one gene model
placed in the 19 linkage groups or larger scaffolds, and
were removed from further analysis. The remaining
putative BAHD gene models were cross-referenced with
the recently released Populus genome v2.0 available
from the Phytozome website [26], followed again by
manual curation (Additional File 1). Manually curated
sequences for erroneous gene models are provided in
Additional File 9.
Protein sequences of the putative Populus BAHD acyltransferases were aligned with previously characterized
BAHD proteins ([2] and Additional File 10: SupplementalTable4.xls) using ClustalW [43], then imported into
MEGA v.4.0.2 for motif inspection [44]. Sequences
which exhibited no HXXXD motif were removed from
consideration. Sequences were further screened for a
DFGWG-like motif containing at least three of the five
amino acids; strict conservation was not required due to
known polymorphisms in biochemically characterized
BAHD proteins. Exceptions were made for loci highly
similar to Clade II members ZmGlossy2 and AtCER,
which contain no DFGWG motif. Finally, sequences less

Page 12 of 17

than 300 amino acids in length were removed from the
list as likely pseudogenes; these sequences either lack
the conserved motifs or represent obsolete gene models
from the previous genome releases (Additional File 1).
BLASTN searches against the NCBI Populus EST database revealed no expression support for any of these
suspected pseudogenes.
Similar BLASTP searches were conducted against the
Arabidopsis TAIR9 database [45], the Rice Genome
Annotation Database release 5 [46,47], the Medicago
truncatula genome database MtDB v2.0 [48], and the
Vitis vinifera genome database (8X) at Genoscope [49].
The sequences were aligned for motif inspection as
described above, yielding 55 putative BAHD members in
Arabidopsis, 84 in Oryza, 50 in Medicago, and 52 in
Vitis. For Oryza, annotation and final number of genes
were determined partially through comparison with the
Rice Genome Annotation Database release 6.1. Manual
sequence curation revealed two full-length Arabidopsis
genes previously considered partial sequences [3], and
the remaining partial sequences along with several
BAHD-like members lacking either of the conserved
motifs (Additional File 2) were excluded from our analysis. Protein length was not used as a criterion for further
curation in Medicago, Oryza, or Vitis, but unusually
long or short models were noted in Additional File 2.
Phylogenetic Analysis

Putative BAHD protein sequences from Populus, Arabidopsis, Oryza, Medicago, and Vitis were aligned along
with 69 biochemically characterized BAHD members
(Additional File 10) using the MAFFT v6.717 online server [50,51]. The FFT-NS-i iterative refinement method
was run twice, once with default settings using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, and once using the JTT200
substitution matrix. The resulting alignments were
imported into BioEdit v7.0.9.0 [52], where any positions
containing less than five sequences were designated as
gaps and deleted from the alignment. The data were
submitted to the CIPRES portal v2.2 [53] for phylogenetic tree construction using RAxML-HPC v7.2.6
[54,55]. Trees were obtained using empirical base frequencies and a maximum likelihood search. The resulting RAxML_bipartitionsBranchLabels.result file was
converted to Newick format in Dendroscope v2.3 [56]
and imported into MEGA v4.0.2 [44] for visualization.
Because the topologies of the maximum likelihood trees
resulting from use of the two substitution matrices were
broadly consistent with each other, only the BLOSUM62-based tree is shown.
In Silico Characterization of Conserved Protein Motifs

Aligned protein sequences from MAFFT were split into
separate FASTA files by clade using BioEdit, and

Tuominen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/236

subjected to motif analysis using the MINER v2.0 web
interface with default settings [16-18]. Because a minimum of 25 sequences is recommended by the program
to achieve good statistical support, Clade IV (five members) and Clade II (18 members) were excluded from
the analysis. Putative motifs were identified based on a
phylogenetic similarity z-score threshold automatically
determined by the MINER. Previous work suggests
thresholds of -1.5 to -2.2 are typical [18]; actual thresholds in our study ranged from -2.05 to -2.28. The corresponding sequence alignments for multi-clade motifs
were manually trimmed to 25 amino acids, including
bordering residues, and submitted to Weblogo v2.8.2
[57] for visualization. Sequence alignments corresponding to representative clade-specific motifs were also
trimmed to 10 amino acids and submitted to Weblogo
for visualization. Any motifs lacking at least one amino
acid conserved at a rate >1.5 bits were not reported.
Putative subcellular localization for all BAHD proteins
by clade was examined using WoLF PSORT [58,59],
Predotar [60], and TargetP [61,62], assigning “plant” as
the organism type. The predicted subcellular localization
site (mitochondrial, chloroplast, secretory organelles, or
any others) for each protein was noted, and overall patterns were summarized for each clade.
Visualization of Putative BAHD Genes on Populus Linkage
Groups and Identification of Gene Duplication Events

The chromosomal locations of the 100 Populus BAHD
genes were visualized in ideograms using the software
package from Böhringer et al. [63], based on the Populus
trichocarpa genome v2.0. Syntenous segments of the
genome derived from the “salicoid” genome-wide duplication event [23] were color-coded according to the
position information provided in the SalicaceaeDup.seg
file downloaded from Phytozome [26]. Two types of
duplication events were noted: genome-wide duplications originating from the salicoid event, and local
duplications. Salicoid duplications were identified
according to Tuskan et al. [23] based on the SalicaceaeDup.ort.txt file from Phytozome [26]. Because many
of the in silico gene model predictions have not been
validated (e.g., some represent partial gene models or
transposons), the “local duplications” category is used
here to include tandem or tandem array duplications
with no intervening predicted gene models (Additional
File 6). Neither partial BAHD acyltransferase sequences
nor transposons were counted as intervening gene models. Three cases deserve special mention. One appears to
be a two-gene tandem duplication, involving
POPTR_0011s12480 + POPTR_0011s12490 (AATL16)
and POPTR_0011s12500 + POPTR_0011s12510
(AATL17). AATL16 and 17 were therefore retained as a
local duplication pair in our analysis. Another involves

Page 13 of 17

AATL12-13 vs. AATL14 with an intervening partial
BAHD gene model (POPTR_0010s06400). AATL14 is a
salicoid duplicate of AATL11, and shares less than 40%
protein sequence similarity with the highly homologous
AATL12 and AATL13 (98% similarity). AATL14 was
thus excluded as part of the tandem array. The other
case involves a six-gene tandem array (HMTL1-6), separated by a non-BAHD gene model POPTR_0001s45170.
Several discrepancies were noted for this region between
the two genome assembly versions. The intervening
gene model prediction corresponded to a full-length disease resistance protein in v1.1 (eugene3.00012870) but
to a partial one in v2.0 (POPTR_0001s45170). HMTL3
was predicted in an opposite orientation relative to
other genes within this region in v2.0, but the corresponding HMTL2 (eugene3.0012871), HMTL3
(eugene3.0012869) and the intervening gene models in
v1.1 were in the same orientation. The predicted tandem copies also varied between the two versions, presumably due to the difficulty in assembling highly
similar sequences. For all these reasons, we tentatively
assigned HMTL1-2 and HTML3-6 (including the
inverted HMTL3 locus) to two separate tandem duplication blocks in our analysis (Additional File 6).
To search for retrotransposons, BioPerl SeqIO was
used to extract the 10-kb sequences immediately
upstream and downstream of each of the 100 putative
Populus BAHD acyltransferases from the v2.0 genome.
Sequences were subjected to BLASTX searches against
the GenBank non-redundant protein database with an
E-value cutoff of 1e-10 . The output file was processed
with the BioPerl SearchIO scripts, and the results were
manually inspected to determine whether the regions of
interest were likely to contain retrotransposons based
on the descriptions of matches. Only sequences with
multiple hits to retrotransposon elements were documented (Additional File 6).
Microarray Data Mining

Affymetrix Populus microarray datasets generated in our
laboratory [24] were used to investigate BAHD gene
expression across genotypes, tissues, and stress treatments. These arrays corresponded to nine experimental
groups, including 1) nitrogen-stressed young and
expanding leaves of two Populus fremontii × angustifolia
genotypes (1979 and 3200), 2) systemic young and
expanding leaves of Populus fremontii × angustifolia
genotype RM5 one week after lower leaf wounding, or
systemic expanding leaves and root tips 90 h postwounding, 3) expanding leaves of P. tremuloides genotype 271 following detopping, and 4) methyl jasmonateelicited suspension cell cultures of P. tremuloides genotype L4. All experiments contained respective nonstressed controls and two biological replicates. The

Tuominen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:236
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/236

arrays were pre-processed by the GC-RMA algorithm
using GeneSpring GX 11.0.2 (Agilent Technologies
Inc.). Populus probes exhibiting mean raw hybridization
intensities of at least 50 in any experimental group were
flagged as “present”, yielding a list of 24,871 probes, and
the rest designated as “absent” and excluded from analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed using several
distance metrics to evaluate the sample clustering patterns. All control and treatment samples from the same
experimental group clustered together, except for the
expanding leaves from the one week wounding experiment. These arrays were excluded from further analysis.
Based on the POParray database [25] and the v2.0
poplar genome [26], the filtered list contained a total of
60 probes annotated as BAHD acyltransferases, representing 48 unique BAHD genes. Because the Affymetrix
array was designed based on the v1.0 genome release
and a large collection of ESTs from several Populus species, redundancy is a known issue [25]. To minimize
redundant representation, we further reduced the list of
60 probes to those that have unique gene matches, and
in cases of multi-probe representation, to those that
exhibited the highest hybridization signals consistently
across multiple samples. The final list included 36
probes with unique gene representation, and 5 probes
matching to multiple highly similar genes. The list of
BAHD acyltransferase gene-to-probe correspondences
can be found in Additional File 11: SupplementalTable5.
xls. The BAHD probe expression values from all control
samples across genotypes and tissues were grouped by
clade and log10-transformed for visualization using the
Heatmapper Plus tool at the Bio-Array Resource for
Plant Functional Genomics [64,65]. Stress responses of
BAHD genes were also visualized in heatmaps using
log2-transformed expression ratios of experimental treatments relative to control samples.
Gene Expression Correlation Analysis

Log-transformed microarray data was imported in to
JMP v8.0 (SAS Institute, Inc.) and distribution of expression values for each gene probe was analyzed using histogram plots. The majority of probes did not generate
curves similar to a normal distribution. Therefore, we
used Spearman’s r as a non-parametric measure of pairwise correlation for gene expression among genes within
each clade. We then organized gene pairs by duplication
type (local, salicoid or other) according to Additional
File 6 generating box plots for each using SigmaStat
v3.5 (Systat Software Inc). For the salicoid duplicates
that have also been associated with more recent local
duplications, all possible pairwise comparisons between
the lone salicoid member and the local duplicates (e.g.,
CHATL6 vs. CHATL1-3, and HMTL7 vs. HMTL1-6)

Page 14 of 17

were included. Kruskall-Wallis one-way ANOVA on
Ranks was used to test for differences among any duplication categories, followed by a post-hoc Dunn’s Method
test for pairwise differences between categories.
Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR Analysis

Apices, leaves at leaf plastochron index (LPI) 0-1 and
LPI 8, internodes corresponding to LPI 1-4 and LPI 710, and root tips of P. tremuloides genotype 271 were
flash frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen for RNA
extraction. Male and female flowers were collected from
wild P. tremuloides at field sites near Houghton, Michigan. RNA was extracted from three biological replicates
of all samples using the CTAB method [66], quantified
via Nanodrop spectrophotometry and quality-checked
on a 1% agarose gel. cDNA was synthesized with 5.0 μg
of RNA using dT20-VN primers and SuperScript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RNA samples from
the nitrogen stress microarray experiments detailed
above were also used to generate cDNA samples with
two biological replicates per condition.
QPCR reactions were carried out in a 12.5 μl reaction
volume using cDNA equivalent to 2.5 ng of total RNA,
100 nM each of forward and reverse primers, and the
ABsolute™ SYBR Green Master Mix (ABgene) with
0.003% ROX reference dye. Two technical replicates
were included for each sample, and sample plates were
run on the Mx3005P™ (Stratagene). Relative expression
was calculated by the ΔCt method using the geometric
mean of three housekeeping genes (elongation factor b1,
cyclophilin, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2),
except for the nitrogen experiment where the last
housekeeping gene was excluded due to missing data for
some samples. PCR amplification efficiency was calculated using the LinRegPCR program [67]. Primers were
designed based on the predicted transcript sequences of
the target P. trichocarpa gene models and the corresponding GenBank Populus ESTs, and wobbles were
introduced wherever variation exists. The primer
sequences are: CHATL1/2 forward AGTTWCWTGCAGACACCGAGCGTA, and reverse AGGGCAATGGYMCGACATATCCAA;
CHATL3/6
forward
TGGCCCTTCAGARATRTCTGCTCT, and reverse
