Abstract
Background: A focal H5N1 outbreak in poultry was reported from Manipur, a north-eastern
state, of India, in 2007. The aim of this study was to genetically characterize the Manipur isolate to
understand the relationship with other H5N1 isolates and to trace the possible source of
introduction of the virus into the country.
Results: Characterization of the complete genome revealed that the virus belonged to clade 2.2.
It was distinctly different from viruses of the three EMA sublineages of clade 2.2 but related to
isolates from wild migratory waterfowl from Russia, China and Mongolia. The HA gene, had the
cleavage site GERRRRKR, earlier reported in whooper swan isolates from Mongolia in 2005. A stop
codon at position 29 in the PB1-F2 protein could have implications on the replication efficiency.
The acquisition of polymorphisms as seen in recent isolates of 2005–07 from distinct geographical
regions suggests the possibility of transportation of H5N1 viruses through migratory birds.
Conclusion: Considering that all eight genes of the earlier Indian isolates belonged to the EMA3
sublineage and similar strains have not been reported from neighbouring countries of the
subcontinent, it appears that the virus may have been introduced independently.

Background
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A – H5N1
viruses have now appeared in about 60 countries causing
devastating outbreaks in poultry with continued capacity
to impact humans [1]. The virus was initially isolated
from geese in Guangdong, China in 1996 [2]. The Hong
Kong reassortant viruses that infected human in 1997 [3]
were eliminated due to massive culling of poultry, but the

ancestors remained and generated various new genotypes
[4]. The virus that re-emerged in South Korea in late 2003
[5] spread to south-east Asian countries [6]. Another
major emergence was noticed after an outbreak in migratory birds in Qinghai lake, western China, in 2005, [7]
causing outbreaks in many countries in Europe, MiddleEast, Africa and Asia [8,9]. The virus is continuously evolving and diversifying into different clades. All the viruses

that caused outbreaks in China, Europe, Middle-Eastern
and African regions grouped into genotype Z, clade 2.2
[10,11]. The isolates from India and Bangladesh perhaps
form the south-eastern geographical boundary for this
clade. The clade includes 3 sublineages namely EMA 1 to
3 [12] and some unassigned viruses.
The first outbreak of the H5N1 virus in India was reported
from Maharashtra in January 2006 [13]. Seven episodes in
poultry were recorded up to April 2006 in the western
states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and central Madhya
Pradesh. Complete genome sequencing of the H5N1 isolates of 2006 revealed that all eight genes belonged to the
sublineage EMA3 of the clade 2.2. The close similarity of
the virus to geographical regions of the East Africa/WestAsian and Central Asian migratory bird flyways, suggested
that the virus in India might have been introduced
through migratory birds [14]. In July 2007, a small outbreak of H5N1 in poultry was reported from Manipur, a
north-eastern state, of India. The outbreak was controlled
and no spread was noted in the neighbouring areas.
The aim of this study was to genetically characterize the
Manipur isolate of 2007 to understand the relationship
with other H5N1 isolates and to trace the possible source
of introduction of the virus into the country.

Materials and methods
The state of Manipur (latitude 23°83'N – 25°68'N and
longitude 93°03'E – 94°78'E) is known for some animal
sanctuaries that are home to many exotic flora and fauna
(Figure 1). A large number of migratory birds visit Loktak,
an ecologically rich freshwater lake dotted with floating
islands, about 45 km away from the capital city, Imphal.
The city lies in a valley of ~700 sq. miles surrounded by
mountains at an elevation of 790 metres above sea level.
The outbreak was reported in Chingmeirong, East Imphal.
The capital is well connected to Myanmar in the east and
to Bangladesh in the west both of which reported Avian
Influenza outbreaks in 2006–07.
Virus Isolation
Six clinical samples from different organs (trachea, lung,
spleen, liver, heart and kidney) of a sick bird were received
from Manipur. Specimens were processed for virus isolation in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken
eggs and Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell lines
as described earlier [14]. Inoculated eggs were observed
for 24–48 hours before harvesting the allantoic fluid. All
experiments using infectious virus were conducted in a
biosafety level 3 (enhanced) laboratory.
Identification
Hemagglutination (HA) and Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) tests were performed as described by Kendal et

al. [15]. Horse Red blood cells (1.0% suspension) were
used for the HA and HAI test. The reference antisera used
were influenza A(H5N1)-NIV/Navapur, H5N1-WHO,
H5N2, H9N2, H7N3, and Newcastle disease virus
(obtained from the OIE reference laboratory, Venice,
Italy).
RNA was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit
(QIAGEN, Germany) following manufacturers instruction. One-Step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed using the QIAGEN one-step RT-PCR kit and
WHO recommended diagnostic primer sets specific for
influenza A HA (H5) and NA (N1) genes [16]. RNA isolated from the specimens was tested by Real Time RT-PCR.
Applied Biosystems' TaqMan Influenza A/H5 Detection
Kit Version 1.0 was used on Applied Biosystems' 7300
Real-Time PCR platform. Negative controls were processed along with the specimens to rule out cross contamination.

Whole genome sequencing
RNA isolated from the specimens was reverse transcribed
as mentioned earlier [14]. cDNA was used to amplify all
the eight gene segments using segment specific primers
[17]. The PCR products were purified from an agarose gel
using gel extraction kit (QIAGEN,) and amplicons were
directly sequenced using an automated 3130 XL Genetic
analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analysis, representative sequences of the
H5N1 viruses belonging to the Z genotype were selected
from the GenBank based on sequence identity (100%
identical sequences were excluded) and geographical representation. In this process of selection, the sequences
whose whole genome was available were preferred. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Bayesian
approach for tree construction as implemented in Mr
Bayes 3.2 [18]. The GTR (General Time Reversible) + I
(Invariable sites) model with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites, was
specifically used and other parameters were kept as
default.

The GenBank accession numbers for the PB2, PB1, PA,
HA, NP, M and NS gene segments of the isolate, A/Ck/
India/NIV9743/07, herein referred to as the Manipur isolate, is from FJ719831–FJ719838. The percent nucleotide
identity (PNI) and percent amino acid identity (PAI) values were calculated as pairwise p-distances, for a dataset of
about 80 representative sequences in each gene. For clarity, limited representative sequences are shown in the
phylogenetic trees (Figures 2, 3 and 4).

Results
In Chingmeirong, Manipur, mortality was noticed in a
poultry flock on 7th July 2007. The birds were housed in 2
separate backyard coops, 132 in one and 12 in another,
separated by just about 5 meters. All the birds of the first
coop died in about 4 days. After one week, one bird in the
second coop fell sick and was culled. The clinical samples
were collected and sent to our laboratory for investigations. All the other birds were culled. Subsequent investigations revealed that the birds were moved from a village
farm, located at the interface of forest and agricultural
land, about 40 kms away from Imphal city, just a few days
before mortality was noticed. It is likely that the birds
might have contracted the infection in that place which is
frequented by many wild birds. Samples collected from
other parts of the city and in adjoining localities were all
negative for the virus.
Isolation and Identification
Virus was isolated from all six samples and in all the cases
chick embryos died within 24 hours post-infection. Con-

fluent monolayers of MDCK cell lines infected with the
specimen showed high cytopathic effect. Allantoic fluid
from dead eggs and tissue culture supernatants from
infected cultures tested positive for avian influenza
(H5N1) virus in HA and HAI.
Samples tested in one step RT-PCR showed amplification
of influenza A, H5 and N1 gene specific bands. A 219 base
pair band appeared showing presence of H5 and 668 base
pair for the presence of N1. Real Time RT-PCR analysis
showed the presence of Avian influenza (H5N1) in all the
specimens (Data not shown).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of 41 whole genomes, all the eight
gene segments concatenated, showed that the Manipur
isolate was unique in the clade 2.2, as it did not cluster
with the majority of the isolates in the EMA sublineages 1
to 3 (Figure 2). It was close to A/Dk/Novosibirsk/56/05
and other ungrouped isolates such as A/Gs/Suzdalka/10/
05, A/Gf/Shantou/1341/06 and A/Ck/Tula/4/05.

The HA gene of the Manipur isolate grouped with A/Gf/
Shantou/1341/06 and A/Pm/Liaoning/7/05 (Figure 3)
outside the EMA sublineages. The highest percent nucleotide identity (PNI) of 98.73 was found to be with the A/
Gs/Crimea/615/05 isolate followed by the A/Dk/Novosibirsk/56/05 isolate with PNI 98.67. The highest percent
amino acid identity (PAI) was observed to be 99.27 (4
amino acid differences) with other isolates including the
A/Ws/Mongolia/3/05, A/Ck/Crimea/04/05 and A/Ck/
Omsk/14/05.
The NA gene of the Manipur isolate did not group with
any of the EMA sublineages and maintained its position
with the other unassigned viruses (Figure 4). The closest
PNI was 98.81 with the A/Gs/Suzdalka/10/05 isolate, followed by A/BHGs/Qinghai/59/05, A/Ws/Mongolia/244/
05, A/Tk/Turkey/1/05, A/Sw/Slovenia/760/06, with PNI
varying from 98.74 to 98.66. The isolates with which it
shared the minimum (nine) amino acid differences
included the isolates of 2005 from Turkey, Suzdalka,
Qinghai, Astrakhan, Omsk and Slovenia/06.
The phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase genes again
showed that the Manipur isolate was distinct and
remained unassigned with respect to the three EMA sublineages. The PB2 gene showed closest PNI (99.03) with
the A/Gf/Shantou/1341/06 isolate, followed by the A/Dk/
Novosibirsk/56/05 and the A/Ck/Omsk/14/05 isolates
with 98.99 PNI and 9 amino acid differences in all the
three cases. It showed closest amino acid identity of 98.95
(8 differences) with several isolates including A/Ck/Egypt/
22531/06, A/Sw/Slovenia/760/06, A/Ck/Gaza/714/06, A/
Pg/Denmark/6632/06, A/Tk/Turkey/1/05 and A/Co/

Croatia/1/05. In case of the PB1 gene, the Manipur isolate
was closest in PNI (98.95) to the A/Ck/Kurgan/3/05 isolate with also the highest amino acid identity (99.45%, 4
amino acid differences). The PA gene of the Manipur isolate had closest PNI (98.83) with the A/BHGs/Qinghai/
59/05 isolate, followed by Azerbaijan/002115/06 with 7
amino acid differences. The closest PAI (99.16) with 6
amino acid differences was with the A/Ck/India/
NIV33487/06 isolate (PNI 98.65). The Novosibirsk/05,
Liaoning/05 and Mongolia/06 and Iran/06 showed PAI of
98.89 (7 aa differences) but higher PNI (98.7).
The NP gene showed closest PNI with the A/Gs/Hungary/
3413/07 isolate (98.9) and 1 amino acid difference. The
closest PAI (99.79) also amounting to a single amino acid
difference was with several isolates including the A/Tk/
England/250/07, A/Gs/Qinghai/F/06, A/Md/Bavaria/1/
06, A/Turkey/15/06, A/Krasnoozerskoe/627/05, A/Omsk/
14/05, A/Dk/Novosibirsk/02/05, A/Ck/Kurgan/3/05, and
A/Ws/Mongolia/3/05. The M gene shared the highest PNI
(98.81) with the A/Dk/Novosibirsk/56/05 isolate. The NS
gene had highest PNI with A/Dk/Novosibirsk/05 and A/
Suzdalka/10/05 (98.96) followed by the A/BHGs/Qinghai/F/06 isolate (98.9). Again, in all these genes the
Manipur isolate was distinct from the others and also did
not cluster with any of the EMA sublineages.
Mutations
In the HA gene, among amino acid mutations, the
Manipur isolate had a substitution K328R (H5 numbering
and substitution mentioned with reference to A/Vietnam/
1203/04, belonging to clade 1). This corresponds to the
novel HA cleavage site, GERRRRKR that was originally
found in three whooper swan isolates of Mongolia in
2005 (GenBank accession numbers AB233320–
AB233322). Subsequently, the same pattern was noted in
several isolates of 2007 from Egypt (EF535822–
EF535825, EU496393) and Nigeria (EU148396). Another
non synonymous mutation, S155N, at the N154 glycosylation site, observed in the Manipur isolate was also
noted in the 2005 isolates of Novosibirsk, Qinghai, Tambov, Crimea, Omsk, Suzdalka, and Liaoning and majority
of the EMA1 isolates. D54N in the Manipur isolate was
shared with the A/Ck/Egypt/1079NAMRU3/07 isolate
and the A/Ws/Mongolia/4/05 isolate. One unique mutation L297F in the Manipur isolate was not noted in any of
the clade 2.2 isolates but was observed in A/Dk/HongKong/ww381/2000. T513A mutation was shared with A/
Ck/Krasnador/199/06. Among synonymous nucleotide
substitutions in the Manipur isolate, G42A, G705A,
T861C, 983G, A1632G were shared with the Egypt/07
and/or Nigeria/07 isolates; T78C with A/Tk/SaudiArabia/
67326/07; T573C with A/Gf/Shantou/1341/06, A/Pm/
Liaoning/7/05 and A/Tk/CzechRep/10309-3/07; C1335T

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/26

with A/Dk/Novosibirsk/56/05 and A/Ck/Sudan/21159/
06.
In the NA gene, the Manipur isolate had 1 unique amino
acid substitution A285T that is not observed in any of the
H5N1 NA sequences. V264I, a unique mutation with
respect to clade 2.2 isolates was found in several Guangxi/
06, Indonesia/06 and Vietnam/04 isolates. Among synonymous nucleotide substitutions, 1018T was as in A/Tk/
Turkey/1/05 and A/Ck/Nigeria/10719/07 along with Vietnam/1203/04, while T1332C was as in A/Ck/BurkinoFaso/13.1/06.
The Manipur isolate showed two unique amino acid
mutations, K116R and I411M, in the PB2 gene, that were
not observed in any of the available H5N1 sequences.
V366I was shared with A/Dk/Egypt/22533/06. Notably
there were five unique amino acid mutations E60V,
A142S, K197R, K737E and M744I in the PB1 gene of the
Manipur isolate. M317I mutation was shared with Indonesia/07 and Vietnam/05 isolates, while K745R mutation
was shared with A/Gf/Shantou/1341/06 and A/Ck/Liaoning/7/05. Among synonymous nucleotide substitutions,
G504A was shared with Qinghai/05, Krasnadar/07 and
CzechRep/07 isolates; and G1437A with Kuwait/07 isolates. In the PA gene, mutations P332L was as in A/Ck/
Scotland/1959; E351G in A/Partridge/Shantou/1075/02;
D396E in A/Dk/Hunan/1204/06 and T618A in A/Grebe/
Novosibirsk/29/05 and Azerbaijan/06 isolates. Two
unique mutations, R213I and A598S were also observed
in the PA gene of the Manipur isolate.
A synonymous substitution, A91C, in the NP gene, was
unique and not observed in any of the available H5N1
sequences. In the M gene, V68I of the Manipur isolate was
shared with A/Ck/Nigeria/104754/06 and RostovonDon/
07 isolates. The non synonymous mutations included,
A408T shared with A/Dk/Novosibirsk/56/05; G480A with
A/Ck/Nigeria/10719/07; G890A with A/Ck/Nigeria/
104754/06 and Rostovon/07 isolates. In the NS1 gene,
two unique mutations, V111M and L212P, were observed
while a unique mutation, F55L, was observed in the NS2
gene.
The gene coding for the PB1-F2 protein in the Manipur
isolate, was observed to have two nucleotide polymorphisms, A85T and G86A. These polymorphisms resulted
in the introduction of a stop codon at position 29 in the
PB1-F2 that was unique to the Manipur isolate. Similar to
this, a stop codon was noted in A/Gf/Shantou/1342/06 at
position 25. Another nucleotide substitution, C123T in
PB1-F2 of the Manipur isolate was observed only in clade
2.1 isolates. An amino acid substitution, G110A was
shared with A/Co/Croatia/1/05 and A/Ck/Nigeria/10719/
07.

The amino acid variations observed in the Indian isolates,
for all the eight gene segments and the PB1-F2 protein are
indicated in Table 1.
Molecular markers
Of the 14 residues reported to form the receptor-binding
pocket in HA1 [19], two substitutions K193R and R216K
were observed in the Manipur isolate. The residues that
preferentially binds the avian-like α2,3-NeuAcGal linkages, G225, S227, G228, Q226, S221 and R216 were conserved. Host specific amino acid residues [20] in the PB2,
PA, NP, M1 and M2 proteins, all suggested avian specificity except V28 in the M2 protein, known for adaptation
to human hosts. The isolate possessed Lys at position 627
of the PB2 gene, which is associated with increased virulence in mammals [21]. Of the known markers for

enhanced polymerase activity [22], only one substitution,
L13P in PB1 protein is observed in the Manipur isolate.
The PB1-F2 protein, that has been recognized as a virulence contributor and functions in reducing the immune
responses as well as increasing the cytotoxicity [23,24],
was observed to possess a stop codon at position 29. Similar to this, a stop codon was noted in Gf/Shantou/1342/
06 at position 25. The C-terminal protein was conserved
when compared to other PB1-F2 proteins except for a
P48Q mutation (Table 1). E92 in the NS1 protein, implicated in human adaptation, was observed in the Manipur
isolate. The C terminal four amino acid stretch corresponding to the PDZ-domain ligand motif in the NS1
protein was ESKV and is reported as being specific to avian
isolates [25].
The NA sequence did not show any mutation conferring
resistance to oseltamivir [26]. Similarly, no mutation was
observed in the M2 ion channel that conferred resistance
to amantadine [27].

Discussion

Unique mutations in Manipur 2007 indicated with an asterisk

The EMA 1–3 sublineages represent the influenza (H5N1)
viruses isolated in Europe, the Middle-Eastern region and
Africa beyond 2005 [12]. A minority of isolates, such as
those of Qinghai, Novosibirsk region, Shantou and Omsk
did not group with either of these sublineages and had
been left unassigned. On the basis of the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis in this study, in all the 8 gene segments,
the Manipur isolate grouped with the unassigned viruses
in the EMA nomenclature.
The molecular characterization of the viral proteins of the
Manipur isolate was carried out for pathogenicity markers
and sensitivity to antivirals. The HA of the Manipur isolate
had the novel cleavage site (GERRRRKR) that was first
reported in three whooper swan isolates in Mongolia,
2005 and also in the recent Nigeria/07 and Egypt/07 isolates. Though variations in the cleavage site such as
RERRRKKR, RERRKKR and RERRRR have been linked to
human H5N1 cases [28], no such report exists for
GERRRRKR motif. Hence the significance of this cleavage
site remains to be understood. D54N mutation in the
Manipur isolate, results in an additional putative glycosylation site, the implication of which is not yet known.
The two substitutions in the HA1 receptor binding
domain were also noted in other clade 2.2 viruses including our 2006 isolates and may not have implications in
modifying avian associated α2–3 linked sialic acid specificities. Similarly, no marked mutations have been
observed in either of the PB2, PA, NP, M1 and M2 proteins with respect to enhanced polymerase activity or host
specificity. Sensitivity to antivirals was also noted in the
Manipur isolate. Notably there was a stop codon in the
PB1-F2 protein of the Manipur isolate. On one hand, pro-

tein knock-out studies have shown that the C-terminal
region of PB1-F2 can be expressed from a downstream initiation site [24], implying that the protein of the Manipur
isolate may still get expressed from a downstream initiation codon. Further, though the C-terminal region of the
PB1-F2 protein, known to be responsible for major functional roles such as mitochondrial localization and PB1F2 induced apoptosis [29,30] was conserved, the variations observed in the Manipur isolate may be of interest
and their significance is yet to be ascertained. Truncation
of the PB1-F2 protein at position 29 on the other hand
could have critical consequences. Recent reports [31] have
shown that non expression of the PB1-F2 during infection
results in an altered localization of PB1 and decreased
viral polymerase activity. In H1N1 viruses, truncated PB1F2s reported due to in-frame stop after codons 11, 25 and
34 have been correlated with an inefficient polymerase
complex and lesser epidemic severity [32,33]. Thus, the
stop codon in Manipur PB1-F2 protein might have implications on the replication efficiency and may have a possible role to play in the focal nature of the outbreak. A
functional PDZ-binding domain is suggested to correlate
with human virulence and human H5N1 isolates generally have a motif, RSKV in the NS1 protein [25]. The effect
of the ESKV motif as in the Manipur isolate and other
avian isolates, is still unknown, though it has been shown
to be a potent type I PDZ-binding domain in other systems [34,35].
The phylogenetic characterization of the Manipur isolate
demonstrated that the virus isolated in 2007 in India was
distinctly different from the viruses of the three EMA sublineages. Considering that all the eight genes of the 2006
isolates of India belonged to the EMA3 sublineage, with
several mutations observed between the two strains, the
possibility of local evolution can be excluded. Genetic
analysis of the Manipur 2007 isolate clearly indicates a
second introduction of the H5N1 virus in India. Among
the other isolates that have been placed outside the EMA
groups, the Manipur isolate was distinct and unique. It
was related to viruses isolated from wild migratory waterfowl from Russia (Novosibirsk, Suzdalka), China (Shantou, Liaoning, Qinghai) and Mongolia. A recent report
[36] stated that the H5N1 isolate from the Bangladesh
outbreak belonged to subclade 2.2 of the Qinghai lineage
and was most closely related to viruses isolated from
Afghanistan, Mongolia and Russia [37]. Further, as seen
from Figs 2, 3 and 4 these isolates fall into EMA3 and are
closely related to the 2006 isolate from India. Thus the
Manipur virus is not related to the virus prevalent in Bangladesh. The uniqueness of the Manipur isolate was
brought out in terms of its own specific amino acid and
nucleotide polymorphisms. The Manipur isolate had 13
unique amino acid substitutions in the eight genes. The
acquisition of polymorphisms as seen in other recent iso-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/26

lates of 2007 from distinct geographical locations such as
Nigeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait etc along with those
from earlier outbreaks in 2005–06 in Turkey, Crimea,
Novosibirsk, Mongolia and Qinghai suggests the possibility of transportation of H5N1 viruses through migratory
birds. In terms of the recent acquisitions as in Nigeria and
Egypt, interestingly, the timeline [38] shows that the said
Nigerian outbreaks were first reported in September 2007,
after the Manipur outbreak in July 2007. This eliminates
the direct involvement of the former strains and points to
an origin of these mutations probably in the Russian federation where the congregation of birds is known to occur
[39]. Recent reports [40] on the H5N1 viruses in poultry
in the Russian Federation, have proposed that the viruses
may be genetic reassortents of the Qinghai-like viruses
likely to have been introduced into Russia from China by
migrating birds. Further, the inclusion of mutations from
2005–06 isolates of Turkey, Mongolia, China, Russia/
Siberia (Novosibirsk, Suzdalka, Crimea) indicate the role
of the migratory birds spreading from the Russian federation into the Central Asian and Black sea/Mediterranean
flyway. Cross over of migratory birds in the flyway intersection has been occurring [41] and thus new variants
might have got into central Asia. Though the exact, source
of the introduction into India cannot be concluded, considering that similar strains have not been reported during
the period of the Manipur outbreak in the neighbouring
countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and
Myanmar, it appears that there may have been a independent introduction into the country. Existing reports,
that, migratory waterfowl from the Qinghai lake migrate
southwards to Myanmar and over the Himalayas to India,
around September returning to the Qinghai lake around
April [41], support such an assumption.

Conclusion
Overall, our findings suggest that the Manipur 2007 virus
isolate is a unique variant and not related to the 2006
Indian isolate. The introduction of such a virus, either
directly or indirectly, into India calls for improved surveillance in the country and subcontinent. The appearance of
such variants is also serious concern for the emergence of
even more highly pathogenic strains and a pandemic
threat.
