Abstract
Background: The evolutionary history of the Asian colobines is less understood. Although
monophyly of the odd-nosed monkeys was recently confirmed, the relationships among the langur
genera Presbytis, Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus and their position among Asian colobines
remained unclear. Moreover, in Trachypithecus various species groups are recognized, but their
affiliations are still disputed. To address these issues, mitochondrial and Y chromosomal sequence
data were phylogenetically related and combined with presence/absence analyses of retroposon
integrations.
Results: The analysed 5 kb fragment of the mitochondrial genome allows no resolution of the
phylogenetic relationships among langur genera, but five retroposon integrations were detected
which link Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus. According to Y chromosomal data and a 573 bp
fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, a common origin of the species groups T.
[cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi] and their reciprocal monophyly is supported, which is also
underpinned by an orthologous retroposon insertion. T. [vetulus] clusters within Semnopithecus,
which is confirmed by two retroposon integrations. Moreover, this species group is paraphyletic,
with T. vetulus forming a clade with the Sri Lankan, and T. johnii with the South Indian form of S.
entellus. Incongruence between gene trees was detected for T. [pileatus], in that Y chromosomal
data link it with T. [cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi], whereas mitochondrial data affiliates it
with the Semnopithecus clade.
Conclusion: Neither relationships among the three langur genera nor their position within Asian
colobines can be settled with 5 kb mitochondrial sequence data, but retroposon integrations
confirm at least a common origin of Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. According to Y
chromosomal and 573 bp mitochondrial sequence data, T. [cristatus], T. [obscurus] and T. [francoisi]
represent true members of the genus Trachypithecus, whereas T. [vetulus] clusters within
Semnopithecus. Due to paraphyly of T. [vetulus] and polyphyly of Semnopithecus, a split of the genus
into three species groups (S. entellus - North India, S. entellus - South India + T. johnii, S. entellus - Sri
Lanka + T. vetulus) seems to be appropriate. T. [pileatus] posses an intermediate position between
both genera, indicating that the species group might be the result of ancestral hybridization.

Background
The Old World monkeys are traditionally divided into the
two subfamilies Cercopithecinae and Colobinae, which
differ from each other by numerous morphological,
behavioural and ecological characteristics [1-4]. While
detailed information on the evolutionary history of cercopithecines (baboons, mangabeys, macaques and guenons) is at hand, knowledge on colobines is still scarce.
Although some molecular studies [5-13] exist, they
mainly focus on relationships within genera or species
groups and not on the general phylogeny of the subfamily. Recently, a first mitochondrial phylogeny of colobine genera was established [14], which confirmed some
previous assumptions, but also led to confusions, calling
for further research to definitively elucidate their evolutionary history.
Based on distribution and morphology, the colobines are
traditionally divided into an African and an Asian clade
[3,4], while Asian colobines are more diverse than their
African relatives. Hence, the Asian forms are further split
into the odd-nosed monkey (Pygathrix, Rhinopithecus,
Nasalis, Simias) and langur (Presbytis, Trachypithecus, Semnopithecus) groups, which are both believed to be monophyletic. Accordingly, langurs were originally combined
in the single genus Presbytis [15-17] or Semnopithecus [18],
but based on neonatal colouration and cranial morphology, they were split into the three genera Semnopithecus,
Trachypithecus and Presbytis [19], and a fourth genus (Kasi)
was added [20]. Alternatively, Semnopithecus was separated from Presbytis, with Trachypithecus forming a subgenus of the former [21-23], but recent classifications use a
subdivision of langurs into the three genera Presbytis, Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus [3,4,24-26].
Within the different langur genera, several species are recognized, which are lumped into species groups due to
similar fur colouration, behaviour, ecology or distribution. With five species groups (T. [obscurus], T. [francoisi],
T. [cristatus], T. [pileatus] and T. [vetulus]) [4], the genus
Trachypithecus is the most diverse of all langurs and posses
also the widest distribution, ranging from South India and
Sri Lanka through mainland Southeast Asia to the Sundaland (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Although all of them are morphologically similar, T. [vetulus] was sometimes separated in its
own genus Kasi [20], and recent mitochondrial sequence
data indicate a closer affiliation of T. [vetulus] and T. [pileatus] to Semnopithecus than to Trachypithecus [7,9]. Accordingly, the two T. [vetulus] members were recognized as
species of Semnopithecus [26]. In contrast to Trachypithecus,
the genus Semnopithecus is restricted to the Indian subcontinent (Fig. 1) and traditionally regarded as monotypic
with the only species S. entellus [3,27], although recently
several subspecies were elevated to species status [4]. The
third langur genus, Presbytis, includes several species,

which occur solely in the Sundaland, but are not lumped
into distinct species groups [4].

The phylogenetic relationships among the different Asian
colobine genera are disputed. Although a common origin
of the odd-nosed monkeys was recently confirmed [14],
evidence for monophyly of its putative sister clade, the
langur group, is still lacking. Moreover, available data
depict Trachypithecus and Presbytis as sister taxa to the
exclusion of Semnopithecus [14], which contradicts with
traditional classifications, in which Trachypithecus and
Semnopithecus are believed to form a clade to the exclusion
of Presbytis [4,21-23]. These findings raise the question of
what positions the langur genera occupy among Asian
colobines and whether the langurs form a monophyletic
clade in general. Moreover, the affiliations of different
Trachypithecus species groups, especially T. [vetulus] and T.
[pileatus], are disputed, and hence, led to different classifications. Currently, only few genetic data are available
[7,9,28], so that further information from other markers
is required to definitively establish their relationships.
To address all these issues, mitochondrial and Y chromosomal sequence data were phylogenetically related and
combined with presence/absence analysis of retroposon
integrations. This approach was used to simultaneously
analyse paternal-, maternal- and biparental-inherited
markers, which allow the detection of incongruence
between different gene trees indicating possible hybridization or introgression events between different lineages
[29-31]. To determine the phylogenetic position of the
langur genera among Asian colobines, a 5 kb fragment of
the mitochondrial genome was sequenced from eight
colobine genera, and combined with presence/absence
analysis of retroposon integrations. Retroposon insertion
events are nearly homoplasy-free and precise excision of
elements is highly unlikely [32,33]. Accordingly, retroposon insertions are powerful informative markers, which
were already successfully applied to elucidate phylogenetic relationships in various primate lineages [34-38]. To
study relationships among different langur species groups
and their genus affiliations, a 573 bp fragment of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and a 777 bp portion
of the SRY (sex-determining region, Y chromosome) gene
was sequenced from at least one representative per species
group, and complemented with retroposon analysis.

Results and Discussion
Genus level phylogeny
To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among the
different langur genera and their position among Asian
colobines, mitochondrial sequence studies were combined with presence/absence analysis of retroposon insertions.

The herein analysed 5 kb fragment of the mitochondrial
genome was assembled from sequences derived from 1â2
kb long and partly overlapping PCR products, whereby no

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/58

inconsistencies in overlapping sequence fragments were
detected. As template material, mainly DNA extracted
from feces was used, which minimizes the amplification
of nuclear pseudogenes [39], and comparisons of the data
with sequences already deposited at GenBank revealed
only intra-species or -generic variation, indicating that no
nuclear pseudogenes were amplified.
To determine the phylogenetic relationships among analysed genera, tree reconstructions were conducted with
different algorithms, which all led to the same tree topology (Fig. 3). Moreover, most relationships are significantly supported and congruent with previous
classifications [1-4], indicating the reliability of the data
set. In detail, the reconstructions confirm relationships
among cercopithecine genera (Macaca, Papio, Chlorocebus), and reciprocal monophyly of cercopithecines and
colobines, as well as of African and Asian colobines.
Within the Asian clade, relationships are not resolved,
although at least a common origin of the odd-nosed monkeys is depicted. Neither the assumed monophyly of the
langur genera, nor the expected close affinity of Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus or the recently indicated sister
grouping of Trachypithecus and Presbytis [14] can be verified with significance. Moreover, all alternative tree topologies, in which the three langur genera were regarded as
monophyletic, or variously recognized as sister clades to
each other, to the odd-nosed monkey clade, or even as
basal among Asian colobines, were not rejected (P = 0.097
â 0.776). Accordingly, an unresolved polytomy among
the three langur genera and the odd-nosed monkey clade
may best reflect the relationships among Asian colobines
based on the mitochondrial data.
Several retroposon insertions were detected, which provide insights into the branching pattern of colobines (Fig.
4). Together with seven already published integrations
[38], now 14 loci confirm monophyly of the Asian colobines to the exclusion of the African genus Colobus. Among
Asian colobines, one insertion indicates a common origin
of the odd-nosed monkeys, which is verified by three further loci [38]. Most prominent are the five retroposon
integrations, which confirm a sister grouping of Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus. No loci were detected, which
link Presbytis either with the other two langur genera or the
odd-nosed monkeys.
Although in general the mitochondrial data are suitable to
elucidate relationships among the different genera, as
indicated by the correct and significantly supported
branching patterns among all other studied genera, the
relationships among the langurs are unresolved, which is
concordant with previous results [14]. In contrast, the
presence/absence analysis of retroposon integrations provides evidence for a monophyletic odd-nosed monkey

clade and a common origin of Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus, which is in agreement with morphological
hypotheses [1,3,4,21-23]. Regardless which markers were
used, the phylogenetic position of Presbytis among Asian
colobines and accordingly the unity of the langurs
remains unclear and needs further investigations.
Species group phylogeny
In order to settle affiliations among the different Trachypithecus species groups and their members, mitochondrial
and Y chromosomal sequence data were combined with
information on retroposon integrations.

The mitochondrial phylogeny was established on the
basis of 573 bp long cytochrome b gene sequences, generated from most species recognized in the genus and its sister genus Semnopithecus. In all tree reconstructions,
identical relationships were obtained, with most branches

being significantly supported (Fig. 5a). Accordingly, the
different species groups are divided into two major
groups, with one including solely groups of the genus Trachypithecus, whereas the second one includes representatives of Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus. In the mixed
clade, T. [vetulus] and T. [pileatus] members are lumped
together with S. entellus. Whereby T. [pileatus] is monophyletic, the members of T. [vetulus] are paraphyletic, with
T. vetulus forming a sister clade to S. entellus from Sri
Lanka, and T. johnii with S. entellus from South India. Furthermore, a fourth lineage in the mixed clade was
detected, which is represented by S. entellus from North
India. In contrast, the three species groups (T. [obscurus],
T. [francoisi], T. [cristatus]) in the clade comprising solely
Trachypithecus groups are all monophyletic. Alternative
relationships, in which T. [vetulus] is recognized as monophyletic, either T. [vetulus] or T. [pileatus] belongs to Trach-

by morphological similarities [4]. These similarities may
be the results of adaptations to similar ecological conditions (Semnopithecus is semi-terrestrial and lives in deciduous forest, whereas Trachypithecus including T. [vetulus] is
arboreal and occurs in wet evergreen forests). Although
the Y chromosomal data allow no resolution within the
Semnopithecus â T. [vetulus] clade, the mitochondrial data
indicate paraphyly of the two T. [vetulus] species, with T.
vetulus clustering with S. entellus from Sri Lanka and T. johnii with S. entellus from South India, which is concordant
with their geographical distribution. These findings indicate paraphyly of S. entellus, whereby North Indian representatives form a further distinct lineage. Accordingly, the
langurs of the Indian subcontinent should be split into
three species groups, with one occurring solely on Sri
Lanka, one in Southern India and a third one in Northern
India, whereas the Gondavari river seems to be barrier
between the latter two.

ypithecus or even both are members of Trachypithecus, were
tested, but all of them were rejected (P < 0.05).
With some exceptions, the Y chromosomal data provide a
similar picture (Fig. 5b), but due to the low number of
polymorphic sites, support values are in general not as
high as in the mitochondrial tree. According to the reconstructions, the species groups are divided into two major
clades, with one comprising T. [obscurus], T. [cristatus], T.
[francoisi] and T. [pileatus], and the other, T. [vetulus] and
Semnopithecus. Relationships among the latter are not
resolved. All alternative tree topologies, in which either T.
[vetulus] belongs to Trachypithecus or T. pileatus groups
with Semnopithecus, were rejected (P < 0.05).
Retroposon insertions further deepened our knowledge
on the species group relationships. Altogether, three
informative integrations were analysed (Fig. 5c), with one
occurring in T. [obscurus], T. [cristatus] and T. [francoisi],
and the other two in T. [vetulus] and Semnopithecus. Interestingly, all three integrations are absent in T. pileatus.

Monophyly of each of T. [obscurus], T. [cristatus] and T.
[francoisi] and their close affiliation is depicted in all gene
trees, so that all of them can be regarded as true members
of Trachypithecus. These findings confirm previous molecular studies [8-11,13] and are in general agreement with
recent classifications [4,26].
The only discrepancies between different gene trees were
obtained for T. [pileatus]. Whereas the mitochondrial data
link the species group with Semnopithecus and T. [vetulus],
the Y chromosomal data affiliates it with T. [obscurus], T.
[cristatus] and T. [francoisi]. These findings might be
explained by incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral mitochondrial or Y chromosomal haplotypes. Accordingly, the
ancestor of Trachypithecus, Semnopithecus and T. [pileatus]
carried multiple DNA lineages with one lineage being randomly fixed in two taxa, but not in the third. Alternatively,
the varying position of T. [pileatus] in different gene trees
might be explained by past hybridization between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. As depicted by the three retroposon insertions, this putative hybridization event would
have occurred between ancestral forms of Semnopithecus
and Trachypithecus, before both genera diverged into distinct species groups. The hybridization hypothesis is also
supported by some intermediate morphological characteristics [4] and the distribution of T. [pileatus], which is
sandwiched between those of Semnopithecus and other
Trachypithecus species groups (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).

Conclusion
With the exception of the varying position of T. [pileatus],
the affiliations of the remaining species groups are congruent among different gene trees. Accordingly, all analysed markers relate T. [vetulus] with Semnopithecus,
indicating that this species group is a real member of the
genus Semnopithecus and not of Trachypithecus as assumed

The present study provides detailed insights into the evolutionary history of Asian colobines and underpins the
tremendous power of retroposon integrations as cladistic
markers. Although mitochondrial data proved to be useful to elucidate and confirm several relationships among
studied taxa, the data set failed to resolve the affiliations

among the langur genera and to settle their position
among Asian colobines. In contrast, retroposon insertions
provided clear evidence for a sister grouping of Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus, but no integrations were
detected, which link Presbytis either with the other two
langur genera or with the odd-nosed monkeys, so that further research is required to solve this issue. Moreover, to
definitively explain the evolutionary history of colobines,
further molecular markers should be analysed, especially
regarding possible discrepancies among gene trees due to
hybridization or introgression, as such events are important speciation mechanisms in primates [31], and as it was
possibly detected in the present study in the case of T.
[pileatus].
Although further investigations are necessary to fully
understand the evolution of colobines, the present study
provides sufficient data to revise the current classification
of the genera Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus (Table 1).
Accordingly, within Trachypithecus, three reciprocal monophyletic species groups (T. [obscurus], T. [cristatus] and T.
[francoisi]) should be recognized, whereas T. [vetulus]
should be included in Semnopithecus. Moreover, due to
their paraphyletic origin, T. vetulus and T. johnii should
not be lumped into a single species group, and S. entellus
should not be regarded as monotypic. A classification into
three species groups with one occurring in Northern
India, one in Southern India and one on Sri Lanka may
best reflect the evolutionary relationships among the
langurs of the Indian subcontinent. However, this
arrangement is tentative, because further research is
required to confirm their distinctiveness not only on
mitochondrial, but also on nuclear DNA level. T. [pileatus]
might be the result of an ancient hybridization event
between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus, and hence, its
classification is difficult. While a separation in its own distinct genus may be appropriate, we provisionally accept
its traditional recognition as member of Trachypithecus.

Methods
Sample collection, DNA extraction and preventing
contaminations
The species analysed in this study are presented in Table
2. All study specimens were identified by fur colouration
and other external characteristics. Hanuman langur (S.
entellus) samples were collected only from founder animals, of which the area of capture was at least roughly
known. Total genomic DNA was extracted from blood, tissue or feces using the DNeasy or Stool Mini Kits from Qiagen. When hair follicle cells were used, 1â3 hairs were
directly implemented into the PCR reaction after they
were washed with sterile water and 95% ethanol. To prevent contaminations, sample collection and laboratory
procedures followed described standard protocols [4043]. In detail, all fecal and hair samples were collected

with gloves and stored in sterile tubes or plastic bags
before further processing. DNA extraction, PCR, gel
extraction and sequencing was performed in separate laboratories and repeated after several months, while always
only one individual per species was tested. Moreover,
from most specimens two different sample types were
available, which both were used as template material.
Sequences from independent analyses were identical.
Finally, all PCR reactions were performed with negative
(distilled water) controls.
Mitochondrial sequence analysis
To determine the phylogenetic position of langur genera
among Asian colobines, a ~5 kb fragment of the mitochondrial genome was sequenced from all colobine genera with the exception of Simias and Procolobus. This
region spans the cytochrome b gene, the control region,
the 12S rDNA and 16S rDNA, and the intermediate
tRNAs. To exclude contaminations of the dataset with
nuclear pseudogenes, mainly DNA extracted from feces
was used as template material, and ~1â2 kb long and
~200â400 bp overlapping fragments were amplified. PCR
products were generated via hot-start technique using a set
of 24 primers (Table 3) and PCR conditions comprising a
pre-denaturation step at 94Â°C for 2 min, followed by 40
cycles at 94Â°C for 1 min, 60Â°C for 1 min and 72Â°C for 1â
2 min, and a final extension step at 72Â°C for 5 min. The
results of the PCR amplifications were checked on agarose
gels. PCR products were cleaned with the Qiagen PCR

Purification Kit and subsequently sequenced on an ABI
3100-Avant sequencer using the BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). To obtain a comprehensive overview on the phylogeny of colobines, the
dataset was expanded with further sequences from related
taxa deposited at GenBank (Table 2). Accordingly, the
final dataset comprised 15 taxa, including eight colobines,
four cercopithecines, two hominoides and a New World
monkey, which was used as outgroup taxon. Sequences
were aligned with ClustalW [44] and subsequently
checked by eye. Gaps and poorly aligned positions were
removed with the G-blocks software [45], which reduced
the final dataset to 4336 bp. Based on this alignment, phylogenetic trees were constructed with the maximum-parsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximumlikelihood (ML) algorithms as implemented in PAUP
4.0b10 [46] and TREEPUZZLE 5.0 [47]. For MP analyses,
all characters were treated as unordered and equally
weighted throughout. A heuristic search was performed
with the tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) algorithm

with random addition of sequences. The maximum
number of trees was set to 100. NJ and ML trees were constructed with the GTR + I (= 0.2526) + Î (= 0.4816) model
of sequence evolution as it was selected as best-fitting
model under the Akaike information criterion with MODELTEST 3.06 [48]. Relative support of internal nodes was
performed by bootstrap analyses with 1,000 replications
(MP, NJ), or by the quartet puzzling support values on the
basis of 1,000 puzzling steps (ML). Finally, to evaluate the
reliability of the depicted phylogenetic position of the
langur genera among Asian colobines, alternative tree
topologies were evaluated with the Kishino-Hasegawa
[49] and Shimodaira-Hasegawa [50] tests in PAUP, both
performed with full optimization and 1,000 bootstrap
replications. Therefore, all three langur genera were
regarded as monophyletic or variously recognized as sister
clade to each other, to the odd-nosed monkey clade or
even as sister clade to all other Asian colobines.

*Numbers refer to positions in the Macaca sylvanus mitochondrial
genome, and H and L refer to the heavy and light strands,
respectively.

To determine phylogenetic affiliations of species groups, a
573 bp long fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
gene was analysed from all species of the different groups
(Table 2). The generation of sequences followed laboratory methods as described [9,11,13]. The final alignment,
which was easily generated by eye due to the absence of
insertions or deletions, comprised 19 individuals including the outgroup taxon Presbytis melalophos. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed as described above. As best-fitting
model, MODELTEST selected the TIM + I (= 0.5977) + Î
(= 2.3137) model, which was applied for NJ and ML
reconstructions. As for the 5 kb fragment, several alternative tree topologies, in which T. [vetulus] is recognized as
monophyletic, either T. [vetulus] or T. [pileatus] belongs to
Trachypithecus, or even both are members of Trachypithecus, were tested.
Y chromosomal sequence analysis
The SRY gene was selected as it represents a single-copy
gene and as it is proved to be informative in reconstructing the Y chromosomal evolutionary history of macaques
[51]. PCR conditions and primers were applied as
described [51]. To amplify the SRY gene from fecal material, two overlapping fragments were generated with published primers [51] and the newly generated internal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/58

primers 5'-TGGGCGGAGTTGAGAGGGGT-3' and 5'TAGCGGTCCCGTTGCTGCGG-3'. The final alignment of
777 bp comprised 15 taxa representing all species groups
of the genera Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus as well as
Presbytis melalophos, which was used as outgroup. To
reconstruct NJ and ML trees, the K80 model of sequence
evolution, determined with MODELTEST, was used. MP
trees were generated as described above. The reliability of
the depicted position of T. [vetulus] and T. [pileatus] was
tested in PAUP by using alternative tree topologies, in
which either T. [vetulus] belongs to Trachypithecus or T.
pileatus groups with Semnopithecus.
Retroposon analysis
Due to their high copy number and relative small size
(~300 bp), the primate specific Alu elements were selected
as cladistic markers. The presence or absence of Alu elements in different colobines at specific loci was tested via
PCR using primers occupying the flanking region of the
insertion site. Details on analysed loci, primers and studied species are listed in Table 4.

To detect new loci, a subtractive hybridization approach
[52] was performed with some modifications. As tracer
and driver, different colobine genera were selected.
Genomic DNA of tracer and driver was digested with RSAI
(Fermentas), and subsequently, the adapters AdapA1/
AdapAA1
(5'-TGTAGCGTGAAGACGACAGAAAGGGCGTGGTGCGGAGGGCGGT-3'/5'-ACCGCCCTCCG3') and AdapA2/AdapAA2 (5'-TGTAGCGTGAAGACCTGTCTTAGGGCGTGGTGGCCAGGGCCGT-3'/5'-ACGGCCCTGGC-3') were ligated to the tracer fragments. Each
of ~15 ng tracerA1 and tracerA2 were hybridized with
~1,500 ng driver for 20 h at 60Â°C. 2 Âµl of the hybridization result was used as template to amplify solely tracer
fragments using the adapter primers A1 (5'-TGTAGCGTGAAGACGACAGAA-3') and A2 (5'-TGTAGCGTGAAGACCTGTCTT-3'). The PCR program consisted of a preextension step at 72Â°C for 6 min to fill in adaptor ends,
followed by 25 cycles, each with a denaturation step at
95Â°C for 1 min, annealing at 60Â°C for 1 min and extension at 72Â°C for 2 min. To enrich fragments with Alu
insertions, a semi-nested PCR was added using either
primer A1 or A2 and the Alu-specific AluY (5'-GGAGAATGGCGTGAACCCGGGA-3') oligonueclotide. The PCR
products were separated on agarose gels and fragments
over 500 bp were excised from the gel. After purification,
the fragments were cloned into the pGEMTeasy vector
(Promega) and transformed into electro-competent
TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). Bacterial clones were collected
in 96-well microtiter plates and re-screened via PCR with
the primers A1 or A2 and AluY. Positive clones were
sequenced and analysed with REPEATMASKER and BLAST
as implemented in NCBI and EMBL. Based on the generated alignments, locus-specific primers were constructed,

with the forward primer occupying a region 5'-end
upstream of the insertion site, which is conserved among
the colobine and human or chimp sequences. Due to the
absence of the 3'-end downstream sequence of the tested
colobine species, reverse primers were constructed solely
on the basis of human or chimp sequences. Subsequently,
the presence or absence of respective Alu insertions in different colobine species was tested via PCR. The orthology
of insertions was confirmed by sequencing of at least one
species per genus or species group. Sequences were deposited at GenBank and are available under the accession
numbers EU004484âEU004537 and EU006662â
