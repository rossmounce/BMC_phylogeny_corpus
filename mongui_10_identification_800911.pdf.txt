Abstract
Background: Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is a major public health problem worldwide that affects 70-80
million people in the Middle East, Asia, Western Pacific, South America and the Caribbean. Despite its
epidemiological importance, few antigens from this parasite species have been characterized to date compared to
Plasmodium falciparum, due in part to the difficulties of maintaining an in vitro culture of P. vivax. This study
describes the identification of the P. falciparum thrombospondin-related apical merozoite protein homologue in
P. vivax (PvTRAMP) and examines its potential to be further evaluated as vaccine candidate.
Methods: The gene encoding PvTRAMP was identified through an extensive search of the databases hosting the
genome sequence of P. vivax. Genes adjacent to pvtramp were identified in silico to determine the degree of
similarity between the protein sequences encoded by equivalent chromosomic fragments in P. falciparum and
Plasmodium knowlesi. The pvtramp gene was amplified from cDNA of P. vivax schizont stages, cloned and
expressed in Escherichia coli. Anti-PvTRAMP antisera was obtained by inoculating rabbits with PvTRAMP B cell
epitopes produced as synthetic peptides in order to assess its recognition in parasite lysates by Western blot and
in intact parasites by indirect immunofluorescence. The recognition of recombinant PvTRAMP by sera from P. vivaxinfected individuals living in endemic areas was also assessed by ELISA.
Results: The PfTRAMP homologue in P. vivax, here denoted as PvTRAMP, is a 340-amino-acid long antigen
encoded by a single exon that could have a potential role in cytoadherence, as indicated by the presence of a
thrombospondin structural homology repeat (TSR) domain. According to its transcription and expression profile,
PvTRAMP is initially located at the parasite’s apical end and later on the parasite surface. Recombinant PvTRAMP is
recognized by sera from infected patients, therefore, indicating that it is targeted by the immune system during a
natural infection with P. vivax.
Conclusions: The results of this work support conducting further studies with PvTRAMP to evaluate its
immunogenicity and protection-inducing ability in the Aotus animal model.

Background
Five Plasmodium species are known to cause malaria in
humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax,
Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium knowlesi. Of these five species, P. falciparum and
P. vivax have the largest epidemiological impact, with

P. falciparum malaria accounting for over 1 million deaths
and around 300 million new cases annually [1], while
P. vivax malaria has long been neglected and mistakenly
considered a “benign” disease, but it is now gaining importance as it causes a considerable number of cases (~70-80
million cases per year), especially in the Middle East, Asia,
the Western Pacific, South America and the Caribbean.
Plasmodium vivax statistics could be even larger because
it easily be misdiagnosed in endemic areas, where coinfection is frequent [2,3].

Knowledge on P. vivax has been considerably delayed
compared to P. falciparum due to its tropism for reticulocytes, which account for less than 1% of the total
circulating red blood cell (RBC) count and, therefore,
makes it difficult to maintain an in vitro culture of
this species [4]. However, the release of the complete
genome sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax [5,6],
their corresponding transcriptome profiles [7,8], and the
analysis of the P. falciparum proteome [9,10] have promoted studies aimed at identifying proteins involved in
parasite invasion to host cells, such as proteins of the
secretory apical organelles and surface proteins of bloodstage parasites. Based on this large body of available data,
recent research in P. vivax malaria has made use of bioinformatics tools to identify and characterize new potential
anti-malarial vaccine candidates by homology comparison (e.g. P. vivax vs. P. falciparum) [11-14].
The apical organelle complex of merozoites (the parasite’s blood stage responsible for RBC invasion) plays an
important role in parasite entry into RBCs. Tubular
secretory structures, known as micronemes, belong to
this complex; these secrete large amounts of proteins
that are used by the parasite to adhere and invade host
cells selectively [15-18]. It has recently been found that
several of these invasion-related proteins contain
domains that are highly conserved among the different
apicomplexan species, such as the thrombospondin
structural homology repeat (TSR) domain. TSR domains
usually bind to highly variable sulfated glycoconjugates
on the host cell surface that mediate cell-cell and/or cellmatrix interactions, therefore, conferring better host-cell
binding specificity [19-22]. In essence, TSR domains are
crucial for many biological processes and their functional
relevance has been suggested based on the identification
of this domain in relatively distant organisms [22].
To date, several apicomplexan antigens have been associated to the TSR family [20]. In Plasmodium, the most
well characterized family members are found in sporozoites and include: the thrombospondin-related adhesive
protein (TRAP), which is a conserved microneme protein
important for parasite motility and for the infection of
mosquito salivary glands and human hepatocytes [23];
the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), which is the most
important sporozoite surface protein and is involved in
gliding motility, among other functions; the CS relatedTRAP protein (CTRP), which is an ookinete protein
important for invasion of mosquito midguts [20,24];
PfSPATR, which contains an altered thrombospondin
Type I repeat domain important for hepatocyte invasion
and is expressed both on sporozoite surface and the
micronemes of merozoites [25]; and finally, PTRAMP
(initially identified in P. falciparum and here denoted as
PfTRAMP), which has been shown to be expressed during the asexual intraerythrocytic cycle, with a maximum

transcription peak during late schizonts. Besides containing a conventional TSR domain, PfTRAMP has an apical
localization pattern in early schizonts and is later relocated to the surface of merozoites prior to schizont
rupture.
Based on the importance of Plasmodium thrombospondin-like proteins and considering the results regarding the expression, transcription profile and cellular
localization of PfTRAMP, as well as the in vitro affinity
of chemically-synthesized peptides of PfTRAMP to RBCs
[26,27], the aim of this study was to identify and characterize the PfTRAMP homologue in P. vivax: PvTRAMP,
and conduct studies to determine its antigenicity.

Methods
Source of P. vivax parasites

The Vivax Colombia Guaviare 1 (VCG-1) strain was used
as a source of P. vivax DNA, RNA, and proteins. In brief,
parasites were cultured in vivo by successive passes
in splenectomized Aotus monkeys [28] captured in the
Amazon jungle with permission of the Colombian government (CORPOAMAZONIA) and kept at FIDIC’s primate
station in Leticia (Amazonas, Colombia). Monkeys were
taken care of according to the guidelines stipulated by the
Colombian Ministry of Health (law 84/1989) and the
Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR, Department of Health and Human Service, USA), under the constant supervision of a primatologist. Levels of parasitaemia
were assessed daily by Acridine Orange staining and monkeys were immediately treated whenever levels were ≥5%,
or before if the monkey’s health condition had deteriorated. Treatment consisted of orally administered paediatric doses of anti-malarial drugs as follows: 10 mg/kg of
chloroquine on the first day and 7.5 mg/kg per day until
day five, administered with 0.25 mg/kg of primaquine
starting on day 3 and continuing until day 5. Once total
clearance of parasites from blood had been confirmed and
monkeys were in a satisfactory health conditions, they
were released back into their natural habitat close to the
site where they had been captured, with the supervision of
CORPOAMAZONIA officials.
Isolation of parasite genomic DNA and in silico gene
analysis

Late-stage infected RBCs (mainly schizonts) were isolated from 3-4 mL samples of monkey blood using a
discontinuous Percoll gradient, as previously reported
elsewhere [29]. Genomic DNA was extracted from
P. vivax infected-RBCs using the Wizard DNA purification system kit (Promega, Wisconsin, USA) and used as
template for PCR amplification. Primers were designed
based on the sequence of a putative transcript encoding
the PfTRAMP homologue in P. vivax, which was identified by screening the genome sequence of the P. vivax

Mongui et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:283

Sal-1 strain, available at the JCVI website [30], using the
amino acid sequence of the PfTRAMP as BLAST query.
The databases hosting the complete genome sequences
of P. falciparum and P. knowlesi were also screened
with GenScan and GeneComber [31,32] in order to
identify open reading frames (ORFs) adjacent to pftramp
and pktramp. Identity and similarity values of peptide
sequences between P. vivax-P. falciparum and P. vivaxP. knowlesi were obtained using the ALignX tool from
the VectorNTI Suite 9 bioinformatics software package
(Invitrogen, California, USA).
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cloning and sequencing

Total parasite RNA (1 μg) was extracted by the Trizol
method [33] and subsequently treated with RQ1 RNase
free DNase (Promega, Wisconsin, USA). A 20 μL aliquot
of RNA was used a template for RT-PCR cDNA synthesis
using the SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen, California,
USA), according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
Briefly, cDNA was synthesized for 60 min at 50°C and
then amplified by PCR with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, California, USA) using pvtramp specific
forward (5′-atgTACATTTTGCAGTTGCTCC-3′) and
reverse (5′-TTCATACATAAATCTGCCAGC-3′) primers, for 35 cycles at the following temperatures: 94°C
for 15 s, 54°C for 30 s, 68°C for 60 s and a final 5 min
extension at 68°C. Primers were designed to exclude the
first 29 amino acids of PvTRAMP. An additional PCR
was carried out using non-reverse transcribed RNA as
template to be used as negative control and rule out
genomic DNA contamination. RT-PCR products were
cloned into the pEXP5-CT/TOPO vector (Invitrogen,
California, USA). Recombinant plasmid DNA was purified using the UltraClean mini plasmid prep purification
kit (MO BIO laboratories, California, USA) and the integrity of the cloned insert was confirmed by sequencing of
two clones obtained from independent PCR assays using
an automatic ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE
Applied Biosystems, California, USA). The obtained
nucleotide sequences, as well as their corresponding
amino acid sequences, were aligned to the hypothetical
pvtramp sequence reported for the Sal-1 reference strain.
Expression and purification of rPvTRAMP

Recombinant PvTRAMP (rPvTRAMP) was obtained by
cloning the pvtramp gene into the pEXP5-CT/TOPO
vector. A six-histidine tag was added to the protein’s
C-terminus to allow purification and immunodetection
by anti-histidine monoclonal antibodies. Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21-AI (Invitrogen) transformed with the
pvtramp-pEXP5 vector were grown in 1 L of Terrific
Broth containing 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin. Expression of
PvTRAMP was induced by adding 0.2% arabinose (w/v)
and incubating cells for 5 h at 37°C. Bacteria were

pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C
and then resuspended in extraction buffer containing
6-8 M urea, 15 mM imidazole, 10 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM
NaH2PO4, 10 mg/mL lysozyme and protease inhibitors
and lysed by sonication. To isolate rPvTRAMP, the lysate
was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and the
supernatant was mixed with Ni+2-NTA resin (Qiagen,
California, USA), previously balanced to pH 8.0 with
extraction buffer. Non-retained proteins were eluted with
the same buffer, while the rPvTRAMP 6his was eluted
from the resin using extraction buffer with increasing
concentrations of imidazole (50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM
and 500 mM). All fractions were analysed by sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and Western blotting (see below). Pure protein
fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1 × PBS,
pH 5.5, as a protein refolding step. The total amount of
protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay
(BCA).
Peptide synthesis

B cell linear epitopes were searched for in the putative
sequence of P. vivax Sal-1 PvTRAMP using BepiPred at
a default threshold of 0.35 and 75% of specificity [34].
Taking into account Parker’s antigenicity, solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity values from ANTHEPROT
[35], three 20-mer-long peptides were selected for peptide synthesis. The sequences of these peptides in single
letter code were: 51AVGAGSQLGQAAQESDVNRK70 ,
82
NSQFTNEKVLEVYSSKEENV 101 and 155 DVKNPSEFEILSEPIKFSIS174. Peptides were synthesized by standard solid-phase t-Boc/Bzl peptide synthesis [36], adding
glycine and cysteine residues at the N- and C-terminal
ends, respectively, to allow polymerization. The peptides
were lyophilized and then characterized by RP-HPLC
and MALDI-TOF MS.
Polyclonal antibodies against rPvTRAMP

Three New Zealand rabbits were subcutaneously inoculated at multiple sites with the three PvTRAMP B cell
linear epitopes mentioned above. Peptides were administered as a 150 μg mixture of polymerized synthetic peptides, emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA)
for the first dose (day 0) and in Freund’s incomplete
adjuvant (FIA) for the second and third doses (days 21
and 42). Sera were collected before the first inoculation
to obtain pre-immune sera and 21 days after the third
immunization to obtain hyper-immune sera.
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting

Malarial parasites isolated from total blood samples of
P. vivax-infected Aotus monkeys were lysed with 20%
SDS, 0.5 M EDTA, 100 mM PMSF, and 100 mM iodoacetamide. Proteins in the parasite lysate were separated

Mongui et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:283
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/283

by 12% SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Purified recombinant protein was
loaded into the same gel as positive control. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS-0.05%
Tween, washed thrice with PBS-0.05% Tween for 5 min
and then cut into strips to assess recognition by each
rabbit’s serum. Strips were incubated with a 1:40 dilution of rabbit sera for 1 h at room temperature, then
washed thrice with PBS-0.05% Tween and incubated at
room temperature for 1 h with 1:4,500 alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Excess of antibody
was removed by washing strips thrice with PBS-0.05%
Tween and color development was assessed using the
BCIP/NBT kit (Promega, Madison, USA), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The positive control strip
was incubated for 1 h with 1:4,500 peroxidase coupled
anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody diluted in 5%
skimmed milk-PBS-0.05% Tween, washed thrice with
PBS-0.05% Tween and then treated with VIP peroxidase
substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Canada).
Recognition of rPvTRAMP by sera from P. vivax-infected
individuals

The recognition of rPvTRAMP by sera from P. vivax
infected individuals was assessed by ELISA. In brief, sera
were collected from 20 individuals who inhabited a
P. vivax malaria endemic area in Colombia and had an
active episode of P. vivax malaria at the time of blood
withdrawal, as well as from three healthy individuals
who lived in a non-endemic area and had never had an
episode of P. vivax malaria (negative controls). All individuals were explained about the objective of the study
and signed an informed consent form before blood
withdrawal. All procedures were evaluated and approved
by FIDIC’s ethics committee. Polysorb plates were
coated with purified rPvTRAMP (1 μg/well), incubated
first at 37°C for 1 h, then at 4°C overnight and once
more at 37°C for 1 h. Each well was washed thrice with
PBS-0.05% Tween and then blocked with 200 μL of 5%
skimmed milk in PBS-0.05% Tween for 1 h. Sera were
added to the plates in duplicate as a 1:100 dilution in
5% skimmed milk PBS-0.05% Tween and incubated at
37°C for 1 h. Plates were then washed thrice with PBS0.05% Tween and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 100 μL
of a 1:4,000 dilution of peroxidase conjugated antihuman IgG as secondary antibody. Excess of peroxidasecoupled antibody was removed by washing plates thrice
with PBS-0.05% Tween. Colour development was evaluated using the TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate
solution kit KPL Laboratories, Washington, USA) and
optical density (OD) measures at 620 nm using a microplate reader (Labsystems Multiskan MJ ELISA reader).

Indirect immunofluorescence assays

Thin blood smears of P. vivax-infected monkeys (3-5%
parasitaemia) were prepared on glass slides, then fixed
with acetone/methanol, chilled at 4°C and blocked PBS10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) for 1 h at 37°C. Slides were
then incubated inside a humid chamber for 1 h at 37°C
with primary antibody (rabbit anti-synthetic peptides’
polyclonal antibodies) diluted to 1:20 in blocking buffer,
then washed thrice with PBS and incubated with a 1:40
dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma, Missouri, USA). Finally, slides
were stained with 2 μg/mL of DAPI for 20 min at room
temperature and examined using an Olympus BX51
fluorescence microscope.

Results and Discussion
Identification and characterization of the gene encoding
TRAMP in P. vivax

A PfTRAMP homologue was identified in P. vivax by
screening the entire P. vivax genome sequence retrieved
from the JCVI database using the PfTRAMP sequence
[GenBank: AAN36262.1, PlasmoDB: PFL0870w] as
query for tBLASTn analyses. The pvtramp gene is
located in a 3,120,417 bp chromosomic segment [PlasmoDB: CM000455], which contains a 1,023-bp ORF
[PlasmoDB: PVX_123575], encoding a 340 amino-acidlong protein with a theoretical mass of 39 kDa.
Additionally, a search for genes orthologous to pftramp
on the PlasmoDB protein database identified similar genes
in Plasmodium chabaudi (Pch), Plasmodium berghei (Pb),
Plasmodium yoelii (Py) and Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk).
Based on a previous phylogenetic analyses showing shorter
divergence time between P. vivax and P. knowlesi [37], this
latter species was chosen, together with P. falciparum, to
compare the chromosomic region containing the putative
pvtramp gene. The alignment showed homology between
the ORFs encoding PvTRAMP and PfTRAMP, as well as
high overall identity (Id) and similarity (S) values between
the protein sequences derived from pvtramp, pftramp and
pktramp (Id = 54.55% and S = 83.25%). To confirm gene/
chromosome synteny between the 3 species, the chromosomic regions containing the three tramp genes were
compared (23.5 kbp in P. vivax, 21.5 kbp in P. falciparum
and 24 kbp in P. knowlesi), observing that the upstream
and downstream orientation of ORFs as well as the exonintron composition are conserved among the three species. This is consistent with identity and similarity values
obtained when comparing the three tramp genes as well
as the peptide sequences derived from genes adjacent to
pvtramp, pftramp and pktramp, which showed Id and S
values of 33.3-70.2% and 46.3-81%, respectively between
P. vivax-P. falciparum, and Id and S values of 69.2-95.2%

Mongui et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:283

and 74.2-96.4% between P. vivax-P. knowlesi, respectively
(Figure 1).
PvTRAMP is 12 residues shorter than its homologue
PfTRAMP (41 kDa) and contains a hydrophobic region
at its N-terminus, which is consistent with a signal peptide according to SignalP v3.0 [38]. In PvTRAMP the
signal peptide cleavage site lies between amino acids 20
and 21 (AIS-EK) (Figure 2a), while in PfTRAMP it lies
between amino acids 24 and 25 (ISS-ND). PvTRAMP
seems to have a C-terminal transmembrane domain
(TM) according to the TMHMM v.2.0 [39] prediction
server hosted at the Center for Biological Sequence
Analysis of the Technical University of Denmark [40],
which had been also predicted for PfTRAMP [26].
A single TSR domain was detected in PvTRAMP
when the sequence was analyzed using the InterProScan
[InterPro: IPR000884] and PFAM [PFAM: PF00090]
databases. This TSR domain has a high significance
value and spans from residue 234 to 284, thus lying
close to the TM domain (Figure 2a). In general, it has
approximately 50-60 amino acids in length, and contains
12 or more highly conserved and typically separated
residues comprising 6 cysteines (C), 2 to 3 tryptophans
(W) and 2 arginines (R) [19]. The crystal structure
showed that this domain is divided into two sub-groups
(1 and 2) depending on the rearrangements between
conserved cysteines and the disposition of aromatic residues, which determine the folding of the major helix in
the protein’s structure [26]. The TSR domain is highly
conserved among the different apicomplexan species
and is characterized by the presence of one or multiple
copies of type I human thrombospondin domain. In
general, it has a distinctive amino acid sequence
(EWSPCSVTCGXGXRXR), preceded by the sequence
WX (where X is generally an acid residue), which is an
interesting aspect since the presence of two conserved
tryptophan residues is not very frequent in Plasmodium

Page 6 of 10

spp. [20,26]. It is important to mention that the main
function of this domain lies in its amino-terminal motif
which mediates binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAG); a
characteristic that is associated with the invasion ability
of parasite proteins containing TSR domains [23,41].
The disposition of the TSR domain of PvTRAMP is
consistent with studies on PfTRAMP by Thompson
et al [26], where it has been shown that the classical
architecture of the domain is not altered by some residue substitutions. Same as other TSR domains,
PvTRAMP has a characteristic arrangement of six
cysteine residues defining three highly conserved motifs
that are particularly significant for structure and binding
functions and is conserved among P. vivax, P. falciparum and P. knowlesi. The first is an amino-terminal
W**WG*W motif (where * represents any residue),
although the first tryptophan is substituted by a tyrosine
in PvTRAMP and PfTRAMP. The second motif, CS/
T*TC, shows an unusual threonine ® aspartic acid substitution, whose functional significance is still unclear.
Finally, the third motif (I/R/Q*R*R) is thought to be
intercalated between the conserved tryptophan residues
and is also present in PvTRAMP [26].
pvtramp is transcribed in parasite asexual stages

The RNA isolated from the parasite blood stages was
treated with DNAse to avoid contamination with genomic DNA and used as template for reverse transcription.
The sizes of the PCR and RT-PCR amplification products agreed with the size expected based on sequence
for pvtramp without including the first 29 amino acids
(963 bp) (Figure 2b). This result shows that PvTRAMP
is encoded by a single 1,023-pb exon, which was confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNA products from independents PCR assays.
No substitutions were found when comparing the
sequences from the VCG-1 strain (Aotus-adapted strain)

obtained by sequencing of the cloned products, compared to the sequence reported for the Sal-1 strain, suggesting, therefore, that pvtramp is highly conserved
among isolates obtained from different geographic
regions. However, this needs to be confirmed by comparing a larger number of strains [28].
PvTRAMP is expressed in P. vivax asexual stages

Based on the PvTRAMP sequence reported for the Sal-1
strain, three 20 mer-long synthetic peptides were
designed, taking care of selecting peptides outside the
TSR domain (amino acids 232 to 285) in order to avoid
cross-reactivity with other proteins containing TSR
domains (Figure 2a). Immunochemistry assays with
polyclonal sera obtained by immunizing three New Zealand rabbits with a mixture of these three peptides
showed that PvTRAMP is expressed in late intraerythrocytic parasite stages (schizonts), as has been previously
described for its PfTRAMP homologue [26]. Hyperimmune but not pre-immune polyclonal rabbit sera raised
against the peptide mixture recognized a 37-kDa band
by Western blot when purified recombinant PvTRAMP
was size separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, which is consistent with the weight expected for PvTRAMP based on
its sequence (Figure 2c). Likewise, the Western blot analysis of polyclonal rabbit sera against a schizont-rich
P. vivax protein lysate showed recognition of a 37-kDa

band by the hyperimmune sera but not by the preimmune sera (Figure 2d).
Immunofluorescence assays using blood smears from
P. vivax-infected Aotus monkeys and pooled rabbit
hyperimmune sera as primary antibody detected
PvTRAMP in schizont stages. As shown in Figure 3, a
fluorescence pattern typical of merozoite surface proteins
with some apparent concentration towards the apical
pole was observed, which is similar to the fluorescence
pattern reported for PfTRAMP. Localization assays performed by Thompson et al [26] using a combination of
antisera against the rhoptry-associated protein RAP1 and
the apical membrane antigen AMA1 showed that
PfTRAMP co-localizes with AMA-1 in apical organelles
from early schizonts, but displays a distinct localization
pattern compared to RAP1 [26,42]. This has lead the
authors to suggest that PfTRAMP originates at the
micronemes and relocalizes to merozoite surface before
initiation of RBC invasion. Further confocal microscopy
studies with more specific antibodies would help defining
whether P. vivax TRAMP exhibits this localization

An ELISA test was performed to evaluate the degree of
recognition of rPvTRAMP by sera from 20 patients who
had an active P. vivax infection at the moment of blood

withdrawal and had had more than one episode of
P. vivax malaria during their lifetime. Most sera showed
a high recognition of rPvTRAMP with OD values that
were significantly higher than the highest OD value
obtained for the negative controls plus twice the standard deviation (Figure 4). However, for most sera,
recognition of the refolded protein was not notably
greater compared to recognition of the protein obtained
under denaturing conditions. This may suggest that (1)
PvTRAMP exhibits both linear and conformational epitopes during a natural infection, both of which have the
potential to stimulate the host’s immune response, or
(2) that the refolding step was not sufficient for
rPvTRAMP to fold back properly and therefore it did

not acquire a 3D structure similar to that of the native
protein expressed by the parasite (probably because of
its high cysteine content), as the immune system’s
recognition of conformational epitopes is usually predominant for Plasmodium proteins involved in invasion
[12,43,44]. Because of this, it would be important to
obtain PvTRAMP in native conditions and performing
functional assays to evaluate its activity.

Conclusions
The transcription and expression profile of PvTRAMP,
its merozoite surface localization and its high degree of
conservation when compared with homologous proteins
from other Plasmodium species have been determined

Figure 4 ELISA showing reactivity of sera from P. vivax-infected patients against rPvTRAMP. Columns 1-20 correspond to recognition by
sera from P. vivax malaria patients. Columns 21-23 showed recognition of rPvTRAMP by healthy individuals that had never had an episode of P.
vivax malaria. rPvTRAMP used in this assay was resuspended in urea and thoroughly dialyzed against PBS for its refolding. Each column is shown
with its corresponding standard deviation.

in the present study. Moreover, the high yield obtained
when expressing PvTRAMP as a recombinant protein
and the broad recognition by sera from P. vivax-infected
people support further studies aimed at evaluating its
immunogenicity and protective ability (as a full protein
or its derived synthetic peptides) in a relevant biological
model, such as the Aotus monkey.
