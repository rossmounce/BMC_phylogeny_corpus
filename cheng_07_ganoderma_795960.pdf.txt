Abstract
Background: Ganoderma lucidum has been widely used as a herbal medicine for promoting health
and longevity in China and other Asian countries. Polysaccharide extracts from Ganoderma lucidum
have been reported to exhibit immuno-modulating and anti-tumor activities. In previous studies,
F3, the active component of the polysaccharide extract, was found to activate various cytokines
such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α. This gave rise to our investigation on how F3 stimulates
immuno-modulating or anti-tumor effects in human leukemia THP-1 cells.
Results: Here, we integrated time-course DNA microarray analysis, quantitative PCR assays, and
bioinformatics methods to study the F3-induced effects in THP-1 cells. Significantly disturbed
pathways induced by F3 were identified with statistical analysis on microarray data. The apoptosis
induction through the DR3 and DR4/5 death receptors was found to be one of the most significant
pathways and play a key role in THP-1 cells after F3 treatment. Based on time-course gene
expression measurements of the identified pathway, we reconstructed a plausible regulatory
network of the involved genes using reverse-engineering computational approach.
Conclusion: Our results showed that F3 may induce death receptor ligands to initiate signaling via
receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase
cascades.

Background
Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum, Reishi or Ling-Zhi) has
been used in traditional Chinese medicine as an antitumor medication or as an immuno-modulator. Many
reports showed Reishi extracts to possess anti-proliferative
effects on many cancers, such as acute myelogenous
leukemia [1], lung cancer [2], breast cancer [3], colorectal
cancer [4], bladder cancer [5] and prostate cancer [6,7]. A
fucose-containing polysaccharide fraction (F3), isolated
from the water-soluble Reishi extract, is able to stimulate
spleen cell proliferation and cytokine expression [8-11].
Understanding how the molecular mechanism is responsible for the effects of F3 on cancer cells remains to be elucidated and will require whole-system approaches, since
isolated single molecular studies have not, so far, been
able to unlock cancer-system complexity. Microarray analysis is the first step in understanding integrated cell functions and cell-specific gene-expression profiles. The
response of cells to external stimuli can be followed over
a period of time by measuring the differences in global
gene expression. Global transcription analysis provides a
new approach to the description of complex biological
phenomena [12-14]; it is also of great use in the field of
cancer biology [15-19].
Networks of interacting proteins can provide researchers
rudimentary understanding in cellular mechanisms;
therefore, it is possible to understand the cellular functions of Reishi polysaccharide (F3) through their linkages
to characterized receptors. In broader terms, networks of
gene linkages offer a new view on the meaning of F3 function, and in time should provide us with a more in-depth
understanding of the function of cells [20]. Traditionally,
protein-polysaccharide interactions have been studied
individually by genetic, biochemical or biophysical techniques. However, the speed of which new proteins are
being discovered or predicted has created a need for highthroughput interaction-detection methods. Consequently, in the last two years, more efficient methods have
been introduced to tackle the problem globally, and in
turn provide researchers with vast amount of interaction
data [21]. In silico (computational) interaction predictions
derived from gene context analysis (gene fusion [22,23],
gene neighborhood [24,25] and gene co-occurrences or
phylogenetic profiles [26,27]) and chip-based analysis
have been reported [28]. However, little knowledge has
been obtained with regard to protein-polysaccharide
interactions. Identifying protein-F3 interactions and constructing anti-cancer pathways are quite important in
revealing the molecular mechanisms involved in anti-cancer activities.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand
(TRAIL, also called Apo2L or TNFSF10) is capable of
inducing apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/411

[29]. It is possible that certain connection to the Apo2L
signaling pathway contributes to anti-tumor activities.
Apo2L seems to be a potential candidate for anti-cancer
drug [30]. The four cellular receptors binding to Apo2L are
death receptor 4 (DR4, also called TRAIL-R1), death receptor 5 (DR5, also called Apo2, TRAIL-R2, TRICK 2,
TNFRSF10B or Killer), decoy receptor 1 (DcR1 or TRAILR3) and decoy receptor 2 (DcR2 or TRAIL-R4) [31-33].
Death receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor gene family are defined by cysteine-rich
extracellular domains [34,35]. Signals induced by these
ligand-receptor interactions serve the function of activating or inducing cell death by apoptosis.
In this study, we intend to find out whether F3 has similar
interactions with death receptors that stimulate apoptosis
pathways in leukemia cells. To study how leukemia cells
are conditioned by F3, we carried out a dynamic analysis
of gene expression in THP-1 cells, a monocytic leukemia
cell line, with F3 treatment at different time points. In this
article, we used oligonucleotide microarray and real-time
quantitative PCR to detect dynamic gene expression profiles; and through bioinformatics approach, we also constructed a gene network. Finally, we illustrated possible
molecular regulations of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides in human monocytic leukemia cells.

Results and discussion
G. lucidum has been used for long time to modulate
immune system and to prevent or treat various human
diseases [36]. The biologically active compounds originally isolated and purified from G. lucidum were identified as polysaccharides, and the main fraction was
designated as F3 [11]. Although the anti-tumor activity of
G. lucidum associated with polysaccharides was wellestablished in vitro and in vivo, detailed mechanisms of
how they work still await to be elucidated [36]. Understanding how polysaccharides (F3) stimulate anti-tumor
effects in THP-1 cells is quite important. From gene
expression to the construction of gene network, our
results contribute to the understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of F3 exertion on THP-1 cells. Two molecular
mechanisms of F3-induced immunomodulation activities, including TLR4 and TLR2 signal pathways, have been
studied [9,10]. In this study, we explored the gene expression and gene network induced by F3 in leukemia THP-1
cells, and aimed to reveal pathways critical in F3-induced
anti-cancer activity.
The induction of TNF-α in F3-treated human monocytic
cells THP-1
Upon the binding of TNF-α to TNFR1, monocytic cells are
triggered to undergo apoptosis. This critical regulatory
process is accomplished by activating the caspase cascade
that results in the degradation of various important cellu-

lar proteins. Previous reports showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could markedly stimulate the cytokine
expression, especially TNF-α [37]. Compared with the
TNF-α expression in LPS-induced THP-1 cells, we could
estimate the optimal effect concentration of F3. We
treated THP-1 cells with different F3 concentrations (1,
10, 50, 100, 200 μg/mL) and LPS (1 μg/mL) for 24 hours,
and measured their TNF-α expressions. Figure 1 demonstrates that F3 was dose dependent in the activation of
TNF-α expression. TNF-α expression stimulated by F3 at
100 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL was similar to that of LPS at 1
μg/mL. From these TNF-α expression data, we calculated
the EC50 (50% effect concentration) of F3-induced effectiveness to be around 10 μg/mL. If 70% of TNF-α is
expressed in F3-induced cells compared to LPS-induced
cells, then 30 μg/mL of F3 is required to achieve the same
effectiveness. For further experiments, we used 30 μg/mL
of F3 to treat THP-1 cells.

staining results are shown. Cell shrinkage, one of cell
death characteristics, happened in THP-1 cells after 48
hours treatment with F3 (Figure 2A and 2B). During cell
apoptosis, an early event is the nuclear chromatin condensation, leading to the degradation of genomic DNA. DAPI
nuclear staining was performed to check the apoptotic
changes shown by cell morphology (Figure 2C and 2D).
The percentage of chromatin condensed cells in F3-treated
culture saw a significant increase (Figure 2E). Shrunken
nucleus and apoptotic bodies in DAPI staining were features in determining whether cells had undergone apoptosis. These results indicated that incubation of THP-1
cells with F3 for 48 hours would lead to cell aggregations
and apoptosis.
Recent studies showed G. lucidum to induce apoptosis in
many cancer cells such as lung cancer cells [38], leukemia
cells [39,40], murine skin carcinoma cells [41], colonic
carcinoma cells [42], prostate cancer cells [6], and breast

Apoptotic effect of F3 on THP-1 cells
After THP-1 cells were treated with F3 (30 μg/mL) for 48
hours, we observed the change of cell morphology under
phase-contrast microscope. Differences in cell morphology can be detected between un-treated and F3-treated
THP-1 cells. In Figure 2, representative photos of DAPI-

same volume of medium was used as control After 24 hours,
the supernatants were collected and in vitro TNF-α activity
was determined using Human TNF-α Immunoassay Kit
(Quantikine®, RD systems). TNF-α expression induced by F3
(100 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL) is similar to that of LPS (1 μg/
mL). From this TNF-α expression data, we calculated the
EC50 (50% effect concentration) of F3-induced to be around
10 μg/mL. The error bars indicate SD from triplicate independent experiments.

cancer cells [43]. In our study, we shared the same results
with other reports, but more specifically in that F3
extracted from G. lucidum could in fact induce apoptosis
of leukemia cells THP-1. In our effort to better understand
the mechanism of this apoptotic effect, we used microarray, a high-throughput technique, to measure the
dynamic gene expression in F3-treated THP-1 cells.
Microarray analysis of overall gene expression in F3induced THP-1 cells
In order to identify patterns of gene expression associated
with apoptotic effect in THP-1 cells induced by F3, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the THP-1 control
and F3-treated or LPS-treated THP-1 cells by oligonucleotide microarray. In Figure 3, we observed clear separation
of control (0 and 6 hours) and F3-treated (6 and 24
hours) samples after performing principle component
analysis on the gene expression profiles measured by
microarray experiments. Figure 4 shows the flow chart for
our microarray data analysis. In Figure 5, the intensities of
gene expression of one experiment were plotted on the x
axis and the intensities of the other experiment on the y
axis. A single dot represents one gene as shown in the scatter plots. The upper three scatter plots showed no difference between the control experiments for 0 hour and 6
hours. These results showed the consistency of our duplicate microarray experiments.

Genes with 2-fold change in gene expressions between
THP-1 control and F3- or LPS-treated THP-1 cells were
selected for mapping significantly disturbed biological
pathways. The pathway of apoptosis induction through
the DR3 and DR4/5 death receptors was observed to be
significant (p < 0.05) in F3-treated THP-1 cells.

Additional data analysis was performed using GeneSpring v

with a 2-fold change in differential expression between THP1 control and F3- or LPS-treated THP-1 cells were selected
for mapping significantly disturbed biological pathways. The
pathway of apoptosis induction through the DR3 and DR4/5
death receptors was shown to be very significant in F3treated THP-1 cells. F3–6 h and F3–24 h indicate the F3treated THP1 cells after 6 hours and 24 hours, respectively.

Significant biological pathways related to F3-induced
THP-1 cells
The differentially expressed genes were annotated to specific biological pathways. For each UniGene ID, we
retrieved its biological pathways from either BioCarta [44]
or KEGG [45] through the existing NCI CGAP gene information database [46]. Biological pathways were mapped
and sorted on the order of matching significance using
ArrayXPath [47]. Table 1 shows the significant biological
pathways induced by F3 in THP-1 cells. In this study, four
pathways, including TNFR2 signaling pathway, induction
of apoptosis through DR3 and DR4/5 death receptors, NFκB signaling pathway, and toll-like receptor pathway may
be involved in F3-induced cell death. The pathway of
apoptosis induction through DR3 and DR4/5 death receptors was found to be the most significant pathway in F3-

treated THP-1 cells for 6 hours. Detailed gene expression
profiles of these four pathways after F3 or LPS treatments
are shown in Table 2. Our findings implicated that multiple mechanisms may be involved in the anti-tumor effects
of F3 extracted from G. lucidum.
In the pathway of apoptosis induction through DR3 and
DR4/5 death receptors, 9 genes were found to be up-regulated and 2 to be down-regulated among the 27 genes in
F3-treated THP-1 cells after F3 treatment for 6 hours. The
9 up-regulated genes include tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 10 (TNFSF10 or TRAIL),
tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 10b
(TNFRSF10B or DR5), caspase 10, apoptosis-related
cysteine peptidase (CASP10), BH3 interacting domain
death agonist (BID), CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR), TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain
(TRADD), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene
enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (NFKBIA), nuclear
factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells
1 (NFKB1), and caspase 7, apoptosis-related cysteine
peptidase (CASP7); all of these genes are involved in cell
death. Two down-regulated genes were DNA fragmentation factor, 40kDa, beta polypeptide (caspase-activated
DNase, DFFB) and caspase 6, apoptosis-related cysteine
peptidase (CASP6). CASP6 cleavage by caspase-3
(CASP3), caspase-8 (CASP8) or -10 (CASP10) generates
the two active subunits. In the microarray gene expression
results, CASP3 and CASP8 showed no significant difference after F3 treatment. However, in our Q-PCR gene

expression results, CASP8 showed a significant up-regulated expression. CASP3 and CASP7 were cleaved into
their active forms after F3 treatment as shown in Figure 6.
In summary, F3 may bind to death receptor 4/5, and activate downstream apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase
such as CASP8, CASP3 and CASP7, leading to the apoptosis of THP-1 cells.
The NF-κB signaling pathway includes 21 genes among
which 6 genes were up-regulated after treatment with F3.
These six genes were TRADD, myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MYD88), interleukin 1, alpha
(IL1A), interleukin 1, beta (IL1B), NFKBIA and NFKB1.
All of these genes are involved and are crucial in cell
death. IL1B at low concentration induced strong apoptotic responses as revealed by caspase-8 activation and
DNA fragmentation [48]. MYD88 is an adapter protein
involved in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling
pathways in the innate immune response and acts via
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) and TNF
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to NF-κB
activation, cytokine secretion and inflammatory
responses. MYD88 can also induce IL-8 transcription and
may be involved in myeloid differentiation. TRADD was
observed to be overexpressed over 25-fold after F3 treatment for 3 hours. TRADD is an adapter protein in the
tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, in which
member 1A (TNFRSF1A/TNFR1) specifically associates
with the cytoplasmic domain of activated TNFRSF1A/
TNFR1, mediating its interaction with Fas (TNFRSF6)-

Pathway

a The

ratio between matching genes and total genes in this pathway

associated via the death domain (FADD) [31]. Overexpression of TRADD leads to two major TNF-induced
responses, apoptosis and the activation of NF-κB. NF-κB
is a transcription factor regulating the expressions of a
large number of genes critical in apoptosis regulation. NFκB is strongly activated shortly after TNF engagement with
TNFR1, generating a pro-survival signal that must be overcome in many cell types for TNF to induce apoptosis [31].
Many reports also showed that Apo2L/TRAIL could activate NF-κB [29,49]. In our results, activation of the NF-κB
signaling pathway caused further THP-1 cell death after F3
treatment.

The TNFR2 signaling pathway includes 17 genes among
which 7 genes were differentially expressed in F3- or LPStreated THP-1 cells. All of these seven genes were up-regulated after treatments with F3 or LPS, as shown in Table 2.
TNF binds to two different receptors, TNF receptor 1
(TNFR1) and TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B). TNFR2 is produced by
activating lymphocytes and can be cytotoxic to many
types of tumors and cells. TNFR2 expression is to mediate
the anti-tumor effect of TNF, and NO is necessary for this

1 cells. TRAF1 is an adapter protein and signal transducer
that links members of the TNFR family to different signaling pathways by association with the receptor cytoplasmic
domain and kinases. TRAF1 is involved in apoptosis by
mediating the activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) [51]. TRAF family member-associated NF-κB
activator (TANK) acts as a regulator of TRAF function by
maintaining TRAF in a latent state. Alpha-induced protein
3 (TNFAIP3), a tumor necrosis factor, was induced by
TNF-α and identified as a regulatory component of a putative cytoplasmic signaling cascade that mediates NF-κB
activation in response to DNA damage [52].
Toll-like receptor pathway was observed to be significant
(p < 0.05 and q < 0.05) in LPS-treated but not in F3treated THP-1 cells (Table 1). This pathway includes 27
genes among which six and seven genes were differentially
expressed in F3- and LPS-treated THP-1 cells, respectively.
After F3 treatment for six hours, MYD88, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2), NFKBLA, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3
(MAP2K3), mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8)
and v-Jun sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homolog (avian)
(JUN) were up-regulated and CD14 antigen (CD14) was
down-regulated. Interestingly, CD14 was up-regulated
after treatments with LPS and F3 for 24 hours. CD14
cooperates with TLR4 to mediate the innate immune
response to LPS and acts via MYD88 and TRAF6, leading
to NF-κB activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response. Lymphocyte antigen 96 (LY96) was up-regulated after treatment with F3 or LPS for 24 hours. The
downstream signaling pathway used by toll-like receptors
are similar to that used by IL-1 receptors, which is activat-

ing the IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) through the
MYD88 adaptor protein, and signaling through TRAF-6
and protein kinase cascades to activate NF-κB and Jun
[53]. In conclusion, the expression of these genes in the
toll-like receptor pathway may implicate their associations with THP-1 apoptosis after F3 or LPS treatment.
Comparisons between oligonucelotide microarray and QPCR results
To further validate our findings from the microarray analysis, we selected a set of genes known for their involvement in apoptosis through death receptors, and carried
out gene expression studies using Q-PCR. 18 gene expressions related to the death receptor pathway were examined between F3- or LPS-treated THP-1 cells for 3, 6, 12,
and 24 hours. mRNAs were reverse-transcribed and
amplified through Q-PCR using primers specific for each
gene of interest; the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was
used as internal control. Each experiment was repeated
three times. The results are shown in Figure 7 and 8. Significance analysis of Q-PCR measurements was performed by EDGE software package [54]. There were nine
significantly differential gene expressions in F3-treated
THP-1 cells, including TNFRSF10B, CASP7, CASP6,
TRADD, CASP3, TNFSF12, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2 (BIRC2/c-IAP), conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK/IKKα), and NF-κB (NFKB1);
whereas in LPS-treated THP-1 cells these were TNFRSF12,
CASP7, TNFSF12, CASP6, TRAF2, and NFKB1. Figure 9
shows that nearly all genes are consistent between the
microarray and Q-PCR data.

We compared the 18 gene expressions in the time courses
after F3 or LPS treatments, as shown in Figure 7 and 8. Statistically significant difference of time-course gene expression profiles between F3 and LPS treatment was observed
for TRADD, CHUK, TRAF2, BIRC2, TNFSF10, FADD,
CASP3, CASP10, CASP6, BCL2, and NFKB1, while other
genes exhibited similar expression trends. These results
suggest that THP-1 cells have similar but different gene
expression response to F3 and LPS treatments.
Construction of cell death gene networks and possible
pathways involved in F3-induced THP-1 cell death
Based on our time-course Q-PCR data, we constructed the
cell death gene network in F3-treated THP-1 cells by our
self-developed software tool, BSIP [55]. Assuming that
gene regulatory network follows the S-system mathematical model [56], we used BSIP to estimate the modeling
parameters, identify the optimized structure, compare the
concordance, and infer a plausible regulatory network.
Moreover, we established the interrelated apoptosis pathways initiated by F3 in THP-1 cells using our concurrent
findings, as illustrated in Figure 10. Death receptors,
which belong to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene super-

Fold change in time-course gene expression of F3- or LPS-induced THP-1 cells by Q-PCR
Fold change in time-course gene expression of F3- or LPS-induced THP-1 cells by Q-PCR. First, THP-1 cells were treated with
F3 or LPS for different periods of time and were collected at different time points. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using
TRIzol reagent. First-strand cDNA synthesis were performed with 5 μg of total RNA in a volume of 20 μl with 1 μl ThermoScript™ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 1 μl oligo(dT). Extracted first-strand cDNAs were analyzed using BioRad iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System with SYBR Green dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Software designed for the BioRad
iCycler will aid in analyzing collected data. mRNA expression of these genes were normalized to RNA content for each sample
by using GADPH gene products as internal controls. Relative expression was calculated as the ratio of expression from each
F3-treated THP-1 cells in comparison to untreated THP-1 cells (control). The error bar came from n > 3. The p values indicate
the statistical significance of different time-course gene expression profiles between F3 and LPS treatment.

family, are cell surface receptors that transmit apoptosis
signals and play a crucial role in apoptosis and cell survival. Our characterized death receptors are TNFR1
(tumor necrosis factor receptor-1), TNFR2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-2), and DR4/5 (also called TRAIL-R1/2)
[31]. TNF-α and TNFSF10, also called TRAIL, exhibit an
increase in gene expression in F3-treated THP-1 cells.
When TNF-α binds to TNFR1, adaptor protein TRADD
recruitment follows, and then it interacts with another
death domain-containing molecule FADD, leading to the
subsequent cleavage of pro-caspase-8 [57]. The binding of
TRAIL to DR4/5 also induces the recruitment of FADD
and pro-caspase-8 of auto-proteolytic activation [37].
Interactions between pro-caspase-8 and FADD result in
further activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7, and also the
initiation of apoptosis [58]. In addition to apoptotic signals, recruitment of TRAF2 through TNFR2 binding TNFα activates NF-κB, thus producing anti-apoptotic signals

[59]. TNFR1 also activates anti-apoptotic NF-κB. NF-κBdependent activation of TRAF2, RIPK1, and BIRC2 gene
expressions seemed to support this because TRAF2 and
RIP interacting with TRADD prevented caspase-8 activation, while c-IAPs inhibited caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation [60]. When NF-κB is activated, IκB is
phosphorylated by protein kinase IKK and this phosphorylation serves as a signal for the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB. Free NF-κB dimers are released and
translocated to the nucleus, where they enhance the transcription of target genes. NF-κB activation and IκB degradation prompt cell survival signals and mediate immune
responses [61]. In contract, NF-κB is a transcription factor
that regulates expression of a large number of genes critical for the regulation of apoptosis, and many reports have
showed that Apo2L/TRAIL can activate NF-κB [29,49]. All
in all, NF-κB activation can promote apoptosis or survival,
depending on the cellular contents [49].

Conclusion
In conclusion, we performed time-course microarray
analysis and Q-PCR assays for measuring gene expression
profiles of F3-treated THP-1 cells. Integrating the expression data, we applied computational modeling to infer
plausible gene regulatory networks involved in F3induced cell death. Our results suggested that F3 might
mimic/induce death receptor ligands such as TNF-α and
TRAIL to initiate signaling via death receptor oligomerization, recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins, and the
activation of caspase cascade, followed by cell shrinkage
and apoptosis. This study confirmed microarray analysis
to be a powerful tool for demonstrating gene expressions
related to the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs such as Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides, F3, on tumor growth. This
approach opens a different way of elucidating the molecular mechanisms for anti-tumor compounds or drugs in
cancer cells. Information in this study may present a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Methods
Materials
Crude Reishi extract (prepared via alkaline extraction
(0.1N NaOH), neutralization and ethanol precipitation)
was obtained from Pharmanex Co. (CA, USA). All chemi-

cals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich Co., unless
indicated.
Purification of Reishi extract
Crude Reishi powder (obtained from Pharmanex Co.) 6 g
was dissolved in 120 mL of dd water, stirred at 4°C for 1
hour, and centrifuged (1000 rpm) for 1 hour to remove
the insoluble. The resulting solution was concentrated at
40~ 50°C to give a small volume which then was lyophilized to generate 5 g (83%) powder of dark-brown color.
This water soluble residue was stored at -20°C for further
purification.
Isolation of the F3 fraction of Reishi polysaccharide [8]
F3 was isolated from the dark powder of water soluble residue of Reishi polysaccharide. The procedure during chromatography was maintained at 4°C in cool room. The 2.1
g sample was dissolved in a small volume of Tris buffer
(pH7.0, 0.1N) containing 0.1% sodium azide, and purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S500 column (95 × 2.6 cm) with 0.1N Tris buffer (pH 7.0)
as the eluent. The flow rate was set at 0.6 mL/min, and 6.0
mL per tube was collected. After the chromatography,
each fraction was subjected to phenol-H2SO4 method to
detect the content of sugar in each tube. Five fractions
were collected (fractions 1–5), F3 fraction was concen-

Proposed F3-induced cell death pathways in THP-1 cells
Proposed F3-induced cell death pathways in THP-1
cells. Based on our self-developed software for the reconstruction of gene networks in addition to literature research,
we proposed plausible cell death pathways induced by F3 in
THP-1 cells. F3 may induce death receptor ligands (TNF-α
and TRAIL) to initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization,
recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of
caspase cascades. Lastly, cell shrinkage and apoptosis occur.

trated at 40~ 50°C to give a small volume in rotary vapor,
which was dialyzed or purified through G-50 column to
remove excessive salt and sodium azide and was then
lyophilized to give 520 mg (25%) of F3.
THP-1 cell culture and induction of cell death
The monocyctic cell-line THP-1 cells were seeded at an initial concentration of 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 Medium
supplemented with 2 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate
(Atlanta Biologicals, GA, USA), 4.5 mg/mL glucose, 2 mg/
mL HEPES, 1% Antibiotic-antimycotic, 10% serum fetal
bovine. Cells were cultured at 37°C in an incubator with
controlled humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
We detected apoptotic cells by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) staining. After
washing with PBS and fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min, the cells were stained with 2 mg/mL DAPI for
20 min. The stained cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope and cells were considered to undergo
apoptosis based on the appearance of nuclear fragmentation.
Detection of TNF-α activity by colorimetric sandwich
ELISA
The induction agent, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or F3, was
dissolved in RPMI 1640 Medium at a stock concentration
of 4 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL, respectively; then stored at 20°C. THP-1 cells with 105 cells/mL concentrations were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/411

seeded in 96-well microplates and incubated overnight.
Then the cells (1.25 × 104) were treated with F3 at the dosages indicated as 1 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL, 100 μg/
mL, 200 μg/mL, and with LPS at the dose of 1 μg/mL,
respectively. The same volume of medium was applied as
control. After 24 hours, the supernatants were collected at
indicated time points by centrifugation at 1200 g for 5
min. In vitro TNF-α activity was determined using Human
TNF-α Immunoassay Kit (Quantikine®, RD systems)
based on the manual provided. The procedure is briefly
described as follows. Assay Diluent RD1F solution (50 μL)
and 200 μL of sample supernatants, standard and control,
were gently mixed and loaded into individual wells. After
2 hours of incubation at room temperature, each well was
aspirated, washed three times with 400 μL of Wash Buffer,
loaded with 200 μl of secondary antibody solution (TNFα Conjugate solution) at room temperature for 1 hour.
The same aspiration and wash procedures were performed; 200 μL of substrate solution was then added to
each well and incubated in darkness at room temperature
for 20 min. The enzymatic reaction was finally terminated
by the addition of 50 μl of Stop Solution. The optical density was determined using a microplate ELISA reader
(Molecular Devices Corporation, California, USA) set at
450 nm with the correction wavelength at 540 or 570 nm.
The concentration of TNF-α was determined by plotting
the sample reading against the standard curve. All the
measurements were performed in triplicate.
Microarray gene expression analysis
THP-1 cells with 107 cells/mL concentrations were seeded
in 100 mm dish and incubated overnight. After that, cells
were treated with F3 and LPS at a final concentration of 30
μg/mL and 1 μg/mL, respectively. After incubated for 6
and 24 hours, the cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 250 g for 5 min, correspondingly. Controlled samples of un-induced cells were treated in the same way with
the same amount of medium. Total cellular RNA was
extracted from a minimum of 5 × 106 cells with the use of
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA); RNA was additionally purified with phenolchloroform-isoamylalcohol (25:24:1). Purity was confirmed by spectrophotometry (A260/A280 ratio) and capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent
Inc, Foster City, CA). RNA processing and hybridization
onto Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) HG-U133A GeneChip
oligonucleotide microarray were performed according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Initial data analysis was performed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite v5.0 software,
setting the scaling of all probe sets to a constant value of
500 for each GeneChip. Additional data analysis was performed using GeneSpring v5.1 (Silicon Genetics Inc., Redwood City, California). Principle component analysis on
gene expression profiles of control (0 and 6 hours) and
F3-treated (6 and 24 hours) samples were performed

using Cluster 3.0 [62]. Genes with 2-fold change in differential expression between THP-1 control (combining 0
and 6 hours in total of four arrays) and F3- or LPS-treated
THP-1 cells were selected for further analysis. Based on
fold-change expression, genes that were differentially
expressed between the two repeated microarray experiments were subjected to a scatter-plot analysis.
Functional classification of differentially expressed genes
The differentially expressed genes were classified into
groups based on their annotated functions using the
BGSSJ software tool [63]. BGSSJ is an XML-based Java
application that organizes lists of genes or proteins
according to Gene Ontology database for biological interpretation [64], and organizes information based on

molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular
components for a number of different organisms. For our
transcriptomic data, the UniGene IDs of the differentially
expressed genes were used to input into BGSSJ with a database option of "NCBI + GO".
Biological pathway annotations
The differentially expressed genes were annotated to specific biological pathways. For each UniGene ID, we
retrieved its biological pathways from either BioCarta [44]
or KEGG [45] through the existing NCI CGAP gene information database [46]. Biological pathways were mapped
and sorted on the order of matching significance using the
ArrayXPath web tool [47].

Statistical analysis for identification of significantly
disturbed pathways
The disturbed pathways with statistical significance were
identified based on Fisher's exact test and false discovery
rate. The statistical analysis was performed using ArrayXPath.
Primer design
Primers were designed based on the published sequences
in NCBI. We used Beacon Designer [65] to design the
primers. Primers were designed to meet the following
requirements: 75–150 bp in length, 50–60% in CG content, less than 5 degrees Tm difference between forward
and reverse primers, limited GC repeats, amplicons
between 80–120 bp, and limited dimer and hairpin formation. The designed primers are shown in Table 3.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Gene expression of the genes in death receptor pathway
was determined by RT-PCR. Total RNA were isolated from
cell lines using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed on 5 μg of total RNA in a volume of 20 μl with 1
μl ThermoScript™ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and
1 μl oligo(dT). Extracted first-strand cDNAs were analyzed
using a BioRad iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System
with SYBR Green dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).
SYBR Green yields a strong fluorescent signal on binding
double-stranded DNA enabling the quantification of gene
expression by measurement of the intensity of the fluorescent light. SYBR Green will bind to any PCR product
amplified by primers and is therefore, non-specific and
less accurate than designing specialized probes. Targeted
products were between 100–200 bp. For each experimental setup, a standard curve was prepared consisting of 5
dilutions of PCR products. Software produced for the BioRad iCycler will aid in evaluating collected data. mRNA
expression of these genes were normalized to RNA content for each sample by using GADPH gene products as
internal controls. The relative expression was calculated as
the ratio of expression from each F3-treated THP-1 cells
compared with the control THP-1 cells.
Significance analysis of Q-PCR experiments
Significance analysis of Q-PCR experiments was performed by the EDGE software tool [54,66]. EDGE is based
on Optimal Discovery Procedure, a new method that
finds the optimal rule for calling differentially expressed
genes, and Time Course Methodology.
Western blotting
F3-treated and untreated THP-1 cells were washed with
PBS twice. Cell pellets (1 × 107 cells) were solubilized in
lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 2M thiourea,
and 0.002% bromophenol blue. Lysates were centrifuged

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/411

at 13,200 × g for 30 mins. Proteins were loaded into 10%
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 150 V for 1.5
hours. After blocking in 5% nonfat milk in PBST containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) at room temperature overnight with gentle rocking, membranes were probed with
antibodies. Primary antibodies involved in this study
include CASP3 (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) and CASP7
(Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) diluted in 1:200 and 1:300,
respectively. Membranes were incubated with corresponding primary antibody and then incubated with secondary antibodies (biotinylated anti-mouse IgG-HRP,
1:2000 dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After incubation with secondary antibodies, immunoblots were visualized with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences)
and exposed to X-ray film. β-actin was used as an internal
loading control.
Network construction
Based on the time-course Q-PCR data, we reconstructed a
plausible gene regulatory network in F3-treated THP-1
cells using the BSIP web tool [55]. We developed BSIP to
solve the reverse engineering problems for gene regulatory
network or other biological networks. BSIP is a PHP-based
web server for identification of biological networks using
experimental time-series data obtained from microarray,
Q-PCR, proteomics, or metabolomics measurements.
Based on the S-system modeling formalism,

X i = α i ∏ X j ij −β i ∏ X j ij , where Xi represents the gene
g

expression level and αj, βj, gij, and hij represent the regulatory parameters, an evolutionary optimization method
with data collocation [56] was used to estimate the modeling parameters with the measured time-series data of
gene expression and determine the regulatory network
structure.
