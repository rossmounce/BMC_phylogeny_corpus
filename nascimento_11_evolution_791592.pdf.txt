Suidae: evidence for different viral subpopulations
in African and Eurasian host species

Abstract
Background: Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) represent remnants of an exogenous form that have
become integrated in the domestic pig (Sus scrofa) genome. Although they are usually inactive, the capacity of g1
ERVs to infect human cells in vitro has raised concerns about xenotransplantation because the viruses could cross
the species barrier to humans. Here we have analyzed the evolution of g1 ERVs in ten species of Suidae (suids, pigs
and hogs) from Eurasia and Africa using DNA sequences for their coding domains (gag, pro/pol and env genes).
For comparison with g1 PERVs, we have also analysed g2 ERVs which in domestic pigs are known to be inactive
and do not pose a risk to xenotransplantation.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian inference showed that g1 and g2 ERVs have distinctive evolutionary
histories. Firstly, two different viral lineages of g1 ERVs were found and a coevolutionary analysis demonstrated that
they correspond broadly to their host phylogeny, one of Eurasian and another of African species, and show no
evidence of horizontal transmission. g2 ERVs, however, show a bush-like evolution, suggesting a rapid viral radiation
from a single common ancestor with no correspondence between host and viral evolutionary trees. Furthermore,
though g1 ERV env genes do not possess frequent stop codons, g2 env genes do. To understand whether g1 suid
ERVs may be still replicating, we have also evaluated their likely mechanism of proliferation by statistically testing
internal to terminal branches using nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitution ratios. Our results suggest
that g1 ERVs are increasing in copy number by reinfection, which requires the translocation of the virus from one
cell to another.
Conclusions: Evidence of at least two viral subpopulations was observed in g1 ERVs from Eurasian and African host
species. These results should be taken into account in xenotransplantation since g1 ERVs appear to be codiverging
with their host and maintaining ongoing capacity to infect somatic and germ cells.

Background
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the remnants of an
exogenous viral form that infected and became integrated in germ cell genomes [1]. ERVs have been found
in a variety of vertebrates, including reptiles, amphibian,
birds and mammals [2]. However, the occurrence and
evolution of ERVs in different organisms are still not
well understood and they are sometimes lumped with
“junk” DNA of unknown function [3,4].

In the domestic pig and wild boar (Sus scrofa) genome,
ERVs are referred to as PERVs (porcine endogenous retroviruses) and belong to the b and g genera comprising
several viral groups [5,6]. The g1 genus is divided in
PERV-A, B and C classes on the basis of env sequences,
while the g2 genus comprises only PERV-E. Although
most PERVs carry mutations that render them functionally inactive, some g1 PERVs retain the ability to express
and can infect human cells in vitro [7,8]. The capacity of
g1 ERVs to infect human cells in tissue culture raised serious concerns on the safety of xenotransplantations [9,10]
because pigs are the first choice of xenograft donors

[11-13]; consequently g1 ERVs have been extensively studied in Sus scrofa.
In contrast, few DNA sequences from g2 ERVs have
been reported to date [5,14,15], although a full length
provirus has been described and named PERV-E because
of its similarity to the human HERV-E. Furthermore,
PERV-E forms a distinct clade with viruses from the
HERV-E family and does not cluster with g1 PERVs
[14]. Genetic and expression analyses also have not indicated an obvious infectious risk from g2 retroviruses for
xenotransplantation [15].
At present, little is known about either g1 or g2 ERVs
in other suid species than Sus scrofa [5,16]. Patience et al.
[5] screened by PCR for the presence of ERVs (both g
and b genera) in five different suid species, while Niebert
and Tönjes [16] sequenced g1 DNA fragments in seven
different suid species. However, they did not perform any
evolutionary analyses of ERVs [16]. Clearly both of these
studies have left many questions unanswered.
The mechanisms by which g1 ERVs increase their copy
number in suid genomes are also poorly understood and
three main mechanisms have been reported for human
ERVs (HERVs) [17,18]; retrotransposition in cis, complementation in trans, and reinfection [19]. The first
mechanism involves replication by co-packaging mRNAs
in virus-like particles built up from viral proteins
encoded by their own gag and pol genes. As retrotransposition in cis does not result in cell to cell translocation,
the env gene is not required to be functional. Conversely,
complementation in trans involves replication of two retroviral elements of the same family, with one defective
provirus using the functional protein produced by
another provirus. Finally, ERVs might form infectious
exogenous particles and reinfect either a germ cell or a
somatic cell. Because reinfection requires the translocation of viruses from one cell to another, the presence of
functional genes is required, although this may also result
from complementation in trans [17,20]. New ERVs will
likely acquire new mutations during reinfection or retrotransposition due to their error prone reverse transcriptase in virus replication [19]. Thus proviruses might
occasionally give rise to infectious exogenous forms
which can reinfect the animal itself or animals of the
same species and sometimes cross to other species, and
subsequently integrate in a germ cell [21].
Recently a study of the host phylogeny [22,23] clarified
the relationship between Eurasian and African suids
based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences,
enabling the study of ERV evolution in these suid species
and the evolutionary congruence of host and viral
lineages. Here, we analyzed the g1 ERV coding domains
(gag, pro/pol and env) sampled from 10 different suid
host species from Eurasia and Africa. We have analyzed
their evolutionary relationships as well as their likely

mechanism of replication. We have also compared the
evolution of g1 and g2 ERVs using their env genes and
implication for xenotransplantation.

Results
Screening of ERV sequences

A total of 144 partial g1 ERV sequences comprising the
pol, gag and env (classes A, B and C) genes and 40 g2 env
were generated (Table 1). One individual for each suid
species was analyzed, except for the babirusa, where two
animals were analyzed for env class E. No g1 ERV genes
were amplified in the babirusa, while pol and env class A
and C were not amplified in the forest hog, and pol and
env class A were not amplified in the Javan warty pig and
the desert warthog, respectively. We were able to amplify
g2 ERVs in all of the species.
Blastn confirmed that amplicons corresponded to
ERVs. Primers targeting env classes A and C cross amplified. Sequences generated with these primers were initially analyzed together and then separated into A and C
according to blastn results. After reorganization, a total
of 18 and 22 sequences for class A and C env were analyzed. env class C was not amplified from any African
specimens, obviating the need for the non-parametric
test for panmixia for this gene.
Three gag and one env class E sequences showed indels
longer than 50 bp and were removed from alignments to
increase accuracy of evolutionary analysis. This allowed a
higher number of base pairs to be analyzed because these
indels were observed in different positions. After removing these sequences, a total of 141 novel g1 sequences
were analyzed along with 28 sequences from the draft pig
genome and 110 sequences from GenBank (Additional
file 1). These sequences showed a pairwise genetic distances in expected number of substitutions per site ranging from 0 - 0.10 for pol, 0 - 0.11 for gag, 0 - 0.17 for
env class A, 0 - 0.27 for env class B, and 0 - 0.15 for env
class C. Identical sequences were rarely observed, and
they mainly reflect identical sequences from GenBank
and between Genbank and Sus scrofa genome sequences.
Non-parametric tests revealed highly significant differentiation between ERVs from African versus Eurasian species (P < 0.001). On the other hand, no sequence was
removed from g2 env dataset for which pairwise genetic
distances ranged from 0.001 - 0.11. The non-parametric
test of population subdivision suggested that Eurasian,
African and babirusa sequences came from different subpopulations (P < 0.02).
In addition, most DNA sequences of g1 ERV genes
lacked stop codons or, when present, were limited to one
stop codon per sequence. This contrasted with g2 env,
which possessed several stop codons (up to 5 per
sequence) and the presence of several indels, some of
which were in unique positions and others at conserved

positions across Eurasian, African and babirusa sequences,
suggesting that they are unlikely to be replicating as env is
necessary for viral reinfection. Possibly, they might retrotranspose in cis if other coding domains were devoid of
stop codons, although this is apparently unlikely because
Sus scrofa gag and pro/pol also showed stop codons and
frame shift mutations. Interestingly, there were three g2
sequences from African species (two from common
warthog and one from desert warthog) and two from
babirusa that did not show stop codons.
Test for detecting recombination

From 30% to 79% of sequences were identified as recombinants for g1 genes by the RDP 3 software [24] including
some apparent inter-group recombinants (Figure 1). This
program also identifies recombination breakpoints, which
for our dataset were located at different positions when the
aligned viral sequences are compared. Because of that, the
intervening non-recombinant fragments of sequence were
not useful for phylogenetic reconstructions because more
than 50% of sequence length had to be removed from the
alignment. Furthermore, in most cases, sequences identified as non-recombinant were not representative of the different suid species available in our dataset. We therefore
did not use the non-recombinants identified by RDP 3 for
phylogenetic reconstructions.
From 17% to 40% of sequences were identified as
recombinants for g1 genes by the PHI-NNet algorithm
[25], and a higher frequency was mainly observed in
sequences from African suids but less frequently than with
RDP 3 (Figure 1). Apparent inter-group recombinants
between Eurasian and African sequences were identified
only for env, albeit with a low frequency (Figures 1C and
1D). It is interesting to note that approximately 50% of env
class A sequences in African suids appeared to be

recombinants (Figure 1C) while all env class C sequences,
found only in Eurasian pigs, were likely to be recombinants and thus could not be used for evolutionary analyses. Because this algorithm identified a smaller number
of recombinants, we used the observed non-recombinant
dataset in our phylogenetic reconstructions.
Because approximately 50% of recombinants were
observed for g2 env, with even some apparent intergroup recombinants detected by the PHI-NNet algorithm (Figure 2), the non-parametric test was re-run
using only the non-recombinant dataset. In this case,
the null hypothesis of panmixia could not be rejected
(P = 0.07), providing no conclusive evidence that g2
ERVs from Eurasian and African species and babirusa
represent different retroviral subpopulations.
Phylogeny reconstructions

In the Suidae, g1 ERVs are grouped into two different
lineages, one in Eurasian and another in African suids,
as indicated by class A and B env phylogenies (Figures 3
and 4). Furthermore, the pol phylogeny revealed five
groups, four comprising only sequences from Eurasian
species, and another mainly with African species in a
well defined clade (Figure 5). However, one g1 pol
sequence present in the draft pig genome grouped with
g1 pol sequences of African suids. This sequence was
identified as a recombinant by the RDP 3 software but
not by the PHI-NNet algorithm.
The clades shown for African class A and B env phylogenies (Figures 3 and 4) were generally coincident
with African host clades, except for the internal arrangement of Potamochoerus porcus and Hylochoerus meinertzhageni in the env class B phylogeny (Figure 4),
which differed from the host tree [22,23] where Hylochoerus grouped with Phacochoerus instead of

showed a less conserved arrangement in all phylogenies,
with internal groups not corresponding to the host phylogeny [22,23] except for the env class B internal

different from Eurasian ones (highlighted in Figure
6). A similar pattern is also observed when recombinant sequences detected by RDP 3 are also removed
from phylogenetic analysis (data not shown). This
suggests that recombination is not responsible for the
lack of resolution on gag. Further conclusions based
solely on gag should be carefully evaluated. Furthermore, these sequences did not show substitution
saturation, with Iss much smaller than the critical Iss
value [26,27].
Conversely, Bayesian analysis for g2 suid ERVs showed
a bush-like pattern (Figure 7) with short internal and
long external branches. The same pattern was observed
using neighbor-joining, and also with the complete
sequence dataset (including recombinants), suggesting
that for g2 ERVs, recombinants were not responsible for
the star-like phylogeny. An unresolved phylogeny may
also result from data saturation, although g2 env showed
very low saturation, with Iss = 0.16, below the critical Iss
value (Iss.c = 0.77) [26,27]. Similar results were obtained
for first, second and third codon positions. Furthermore,
the likelihood-mapping method indicated that the data
contain a high amount of net-like (9.1%) and star-like
(16.3%) signals, indicating that the tree was not well
resolved according to the criteria of Strimmer and von
Haeseler [28].

showed a value of 0.99 to 1.00. Black symbols represent ERVs from the different Eurasian species and gray symbols represent ERVs from different

Mechanism of ERV proliferation

Most sequences of g1 ERVs did not possess stop codons
and/or indels. Furthermore, when present, they were
usually located at unique positions in any given
sequence. Low frequency of stop codons is evidence
that complementation in trans has been a rare event
[18].
Estimates of ω for each branch in the phylogeny were
used for testing the possibility of purifying selection
[29,30]. Comparisons of internal branches with external
branches ("two-ratio” model) suggested that purifying
selection was acting on all genes because of the highly
significant differences in log-likelihoods (Table 2).

Furthermore, ω was significantly smaller for internal
branches than for external branches: 0.34 and 0.78 for
gag, 0.25 and 0.56 for pol, 0.30 and 1.04 for env class A,
and 0.22 and 1.47 for env class B (Table 2).
For the g2 env gene, we found statistical support for
the “one-ratio” model (P = 0.053), which made testing
the “two-ratio” model unnecessary.

Discussion
We found strong evidence that g1 ERVs from Eurasian
and African species based on the pol and env phylogenies belong to two different lineages. This pattern was
also observed for LTR phylogenies sampled from

Eurasian and African host species [31]. Host species
from Eurasia are more similar to one another, showing
shorter branch lengths compared to the more differentiated African host species with longer branch lengths,
consistent with traditional taxonomy which puts all
Eurasian species in the genus Sus, whereas there are several genera recognized in Africa [32-34]. A similar pattern was generally observed in g1 ERV class A and B
env phylogenies and for the LTRs, suggesting that proviruses might be codiverging with their respective host
species.
The resolution of the pol phylogeny into distinct Eurasian and African lineages, which was not found with gag, is
not a consequence of analysis of longer alignments. Bayesian analysis based on 885 bp of pol sequence (the same
size as the gag alignment) showed an almost identical
topology to that observed in Figure 5, showing a single
African clade of ERVs (including the one ERV sequence of
the draft pig genome). Similarly, when ca. 400 bp of env is
analysed, an almost identical topology of that of Figure 3 is
also observed [30].

The gag phylogeny is different from the other viral gene
phylogenies and to the host phylogeny [22,23]. This may
be explained by the gene tree versus species tree problem
in which gene phylogenies sometimes conflict with a species tree because individual gene sequences can generate
different topologies and consequently conflicting results
[35-37], but is also likely to be due simply to the lack of
resolution in the gag phylogeny which cannot be attributed to the length of base pairs analysed compared to the
other genes. The lack of resolution of this gene was also
observed by other authors when analysing other retroviruses [for an example see [38,39]]. Alternatively, the
DNA sequence conservation of gag gene suggests that
Gag proteins are important for viral replication. Experimental analysis of Moloney murine leukemia virus
showed that mutations of several portions of gag were
incompatible with viral replication [40], implying strong
selection for conservation of the gag gene sequence. In
this case, while other viral domains might have evolved
distinct African and Eurasian sequences, gag might have
been constrained from doing so.

and confirm that they represent genuine recombinant
sequences.
We also found evidence for past purifying selection on
all g1 genes. This suggested that retroviruses that
remained functional were initially selected and that transposition by reinfection was relevant, while loss of function
would have likely resulted in neutral evolution within the
host genome ω ≈ 1. Furthermore, the rarity of stop codons
and/or indels also suggested that complementation in
trans and retrotransposition in cis were not relevant
mechanisms of transposition [17,18].

Evolutionary comparisons of g1 and g2 env genes

Class A and B env phylogenies showed two likely subpopulations in African suids, one in Phacochoerus species, and another in Potamochoerus and Hylochoerus
species more related to ERVs from Sus species, (Figures 3
and 4). Amplification of orthologous sequences as well as
full length proviral sequences would provide a better
basis for comparison, but for reasons of practicality and
convenience paralogous sequences amplified by PCR
have been routinely used to determine the evolutionary
relationship of ERVs in different host species [41-43].
Recombination was apparent in several g1 and g2
sequences, presumably as a result of co-packaging of different RNAs in the same viral particle. In Sus scrofa,
recombination between highly variable env sequences is
easier to detect than for gag and pol. Moreover, selection
would be also more likely to be operating on env than on
the other genes because the viral envelope must evolve to
escape immune detection, thus making recombination a
likely source of adaptative phenotypes. ERVs from African
species showed more evidence of recombination than
ERVs from Eurasian species, although this apparent difference may be an artifact of the higher differentiation
(longer branch lengths) for pol and for class A and B env
in African species. Furthermore, the RDP 3 software identified a higher number of recombinants than the PHINNet algorithm for g1 genes, a fact also observed in HIV
by Lamers et al. (2009) and attributed to the molecular
models implemented in some RDP 3 methods, to the
number of sequences in each analysis and to variation
within each subpopulation altering the number of identified recombinants [44]. This might be why the g1 pol
sequence from the draft pig genome was identified as
recombinant by RDP 3 and non-recombinant by the PHINNet algorithm. These discordances obviously result from
the different methods of analyses, pointing to the need of
improving their consistency and power especially in
detecting recombinants between ERV sequences. This
improvement is also important to better characterize the

In contrast to the g1 phylogeny, g2 ERV env gene
showed a bush-like unresolved tree, (Figure 7) confirmed by the likelihood-mapping, either resulting from
inadequate sampling or data (soft polytomy) or reflecting the actual evolutionary history of g2 ERVs in the
Suidae (hard polytomy) [45-47]. The bush-like pattern
might reflect an incomplete sampling because env from
ten other suid species is missing in the phylogeny. However, the g1 ERV env phylogenies (Figures 3 and 4)
using fewer species showed a better resolved tree with
species from Eurasia grouping apart from African suids,
suggesting that the number of viral sequences samples
from each suid host would not be an explanation for
the poor resolution of g2 ERV env phylogeny.
An unresolved phylogeny, like that observed for g2
ERVs, may also result from data saturation, but the env
sequences showed very low saturation. Although we
cannot rule out the possibility that the g2 star-like phylogeny resulted from inadequate sampling, this seems
unlikely as samples used here were available from ERVs
from three different suid lineages observed by Nascimento [22,23]. In this case, a hard polytomy seems
more plausible. Although Vandamme [45] emphasised
the difficulty of proving the existence of hard polytomies
in real life, Poe and Chubb [48], Barth et al. [46], Willerslev et al. [49] and several others [47,50] have observed
some apparent examples in different taxa, including
birds, mammals, plants and protozoa, and this pattern
was also observed for human ERVs [19].
This hard polytomy may then represent a rapid radiation from a single common ancestor giving rise to multiple distinct retroviral lineages almost at the same time
[19,45]. These ERVs have subsequently become inactivated resulting in the loss of the last active lineage (also
suggested by the presence of several stop codons), following a long period of inactivity leading to the star
shaped phylogeny [19].
The reason why distinct evolutionary histories are
observed for g1 and g2 ERVs is not known. It would be

defensive mechanisms. However, Katzourakis et al. [19]
by modelling ERV evolutionary dynamics demonstrated
that such a star shaped phylogeny can be generated by a
“null model” in which all parameters are set constant
through out time.

Conclusions
The different lineages of g1 ERVs in the Suidae are generally congruent with the host phylogeny. This implies
that horizontal transmission across these very different
host lineages has not occurred. Moreover, the frequent
evolutionary occurrence of viral recombination may be
relevant to risk analysis of xenotransplantation, especially since viral recombination will favour adaptation
and confer capacity for maintaining ongoing infection of
somatic and germ cells. This highlights the importance
of improving methods to prevent PERVs from crossing
the species barriers. Finally, the evolution of g2 ERVs
confirms their lack of risk in xenotransplantation
because the star phylogeny suggests loss of the last
active element which is also confirmed by the presence
of numerous stop codons.
Methods
Sample collection, primer design and PCR assays

DNA samples of 12 animals from 10 species and one
subspecies of Suidae (Table 1) were analyzed for the
presence of ERVs. Oligonucleotide primers targeting
conserved regions of the g1 gag, pro/pol and env (classes
A, B and C) genes and g2 env (class E; Table 3) were

designed using DNA sequences from Sus scrofa as input
for OLIGO (version 6.8; Molecular Biology Insights).
These specific primers were designed aiming to amplify
from the other Suidae species similar sequences to Sus
scrofa and increase the chances to amplify sequences in
the same genomic loci. Products were PCR amplified
with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec followed
by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 55°C or 58°C for 60 sec (for gag and other genes
respectively), extension at 72°C for 90 sec, and a final
extension of 72°C for 5 min. Amplicons were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel and fragments of
expected size (Table 3) were purified following gel band
excision using UltraClean™ Gel Spin DNA Purification
kit (Mo Bio, Australia).
Cloning and sequencing

Purified PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA
cloning® kit (Invitrogen, Australia) and DNA from plasmids containing inserts was subsequently extracted with
UltraClean™ Mini Plasmid Prep kit (Mo Bio). For each
specimen, approximately five purified plasmids were
sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd
(AGRF; Brisbane, Australia) for DNA sequencing with
primers listed in Table 3. Electropherograms were
checked using BIOEDIT (version 7.0.9.0) [51].
Data mining

DNA sequences were blasted using the blastn option
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to confirm that
ERV products had been amplified and to identify all
previously reported PERV sequences. The pre-ensembl
Sus scrofa genome database (http://pre.ensembl.org/
index.html; version Sscrofa8) was searched using the
blat option for gag, pro/pol and env, with best matching
sequences being also included in alignments. Only
sequences with 100% coverage were used in subsequent
analyses. GenBank sequences were from genomic PERV
sequences from pigs of various breeds, porcine cell lines,
infected human primary cells and transcripts from virus
particles released from porcine cell lines. The majority
of GenBank sequences do not contain information on
genomic position and we could not take this information into account. Sequences from the Sus scrofa genome were also not representative of the numerous
PERV loci already described. This was because the
Sscrofa8 version of the pig genome was not finished and
because we have narrowed our search to sequences with
100% coverage.
Alignment and genetic distance estimations

All novel and available PERV sequences from GenBank
and from the draft pig genome were aligned with MUSCLE (version 3.6) [52], with default options and were

Nascimento et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:139
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/139

manually checked. Columns showing gaps in the majority
of aligned sequences and nucleotides at the minority of
sequences were manually removed. Conversely, columns
showing gaps at sites where nucleotides were present in
the majority of sequences were not removed, and these
gaps were treated as missing data [53]. pol and gag
sequences from murine leukemia virus (AY277737 and
EU075329 respectively), gibbon leukemia virus (U60065
and M26927 respectively) and koala retrovirus (AF151794)
were used as outgroups. We initially aligned amino acid
sequences of outgroups and suid ERVs, and subsequently
back-translated to nucleotide using SEAVIEW (version
4.0) [54]. We did not include outgroups when analyzing
the env genes because of the very low conservation of ERV
env sequences. Pairwise genetic distances were estimated
using the modified Log-Det implemented in MEGA (version 4) [55] in view that it can estimate reliable distances
for closely related taxa [56]. Identical sequences, very similar (pairwise genetic distances equal to 0.001) and those
with large indels were removed from alignments for a better phylogeny estimation, recombination detection and
calculation of ω (see below).
Test of subpopulation structure and detection of
recombination

To test whether viral sequences isolated from Eurasian,
African and the babirusa (when available) suids belong to
statistically different subpopulations, we explored the datasets with a test for population sub-division developed by
Hudson et al. [57] and adapted to study HIV populations
by Achaz et al. [58]. This non-parametric test of population subdivision was performed using a web-based interface (http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/achaz/hudsontest.html)
with a nominal significance threshold of 0.05 for accepting
or rejecting a null hypothesis for structure. Because
recombinants may misplace sequences in a phylogeny
[59,60], they were detected using the PHI-NNet algorithm
[25]. This could efficiently detect recombination among
closely related sequences [25] from Eurasian host species,
African host species and the babirusa (when available) and
could even suggest Eurasian-African (-babirusa) recombinants. Recombinants were also independently detected
using the software RDP 3[24] which implements seven different recombination programs, 1) the original RDP
method [61], 2) the GENECONV method [62,63], 3) the
MaxChi method [64], 4) the Chimaera method [65], 5) the
SiScan method [66] and 7) 3SEQ method [67]. Default settings and the option “auto mask for optimal recombination detection” were used in all analyses.
Phylogenetic reconstruction

Bayesian inference (BI) using the Markov chain Monte
Carlo method was used for phylogenetic analyses of g1
gag, pol and env and g2 env genes using MR BAYES

Page 10 of 13

(version 3.1.2) [68,69]. DNA substitution models were
selected by MODELGENERATOR (version 0.84) [70]
using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). For a list of
DNA substitution models see Table 4. Two and three
separate BIs were carried out for g1 and g2 genes respectively and compared using Bayes factors (B 10 ) as
described in Nylander et al. [71]. For each BI two chains
were run for a different number of generations (Table 4)
and one tree per 100 generations was collected. Convergence and mixing were evaluated using TRACER (version
1.4.1) [72] and the initial 25% of runs was discarded
(burn-in). A majority-rule consensus phylogram was constructed according to results of Bayes factor comparisons.
Test of substitution saturation

Because the g1 gag and the g2 env sequences showed
unresolved phylogenies, we have calculated an index of
DNA substitution saturation (I ss ) [73] using the program DAMBE (version 5.0.85) [74] to evaluate whether
sequences contained phylogenetic signals. Furthermore,
because of the star-like g2 env phylogeny, a likelihoodmapping analysis [28] was performed using TREEPUZZLE[75] which shows the percentage of tree-like,
star-like and net-like signals in the dataset [for more
information, see [76]].
Estimations of ω ratios

To evaluate whether g1 ERVs may be still replicating
[18] we have calculated the nonsynonymous (dN) versus
synonymous (dS) substitution ratios (ω = dN/dS) for g1
genes using PAML (version 4.2) [77] according to Belshaw et al. [18]. Internal branches were compared to
terminal branches using the “two-ratio” model [30]
where the null hypothesis of ω ≥ 1 (neutral or positive

selection) was compared with the alternative hypothesis
of ω < 1 (purifying selection). Significance was tested by
fixing ω at 1 for internal branches and performing a
likelihood ratio test (LRT), where twice the difference of
the log-likelihoods was compared to critical values of
the c2 distribution for 1 degree of freedom [30].
For g2 env gene, we have compared a single ω for the
entire tree (the “one-ratio” model) to a “free-ratio”
model (a separate ω ratio for each branch of the phylogeny) [18]. The significance of differences between “oneratio” and “free-ratio” models was assessed by a LRT for
34 degrees of freedom [30].
Outgroups were removed from the trees before performing these calculations.
