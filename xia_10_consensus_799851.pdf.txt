Abstract
Background: Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) belongs to the family Cyprinidae which includes more than
2000 fish species. It is one of the most important freshwater food fish species in world aquaculture. A linkage map
is an essential framework for mapping traits of interest and is often the first step towards understanding genome
evolution. The aim of this study is to construct a first generation genetic map of grass carp using microsatellites
and SNPs to generate a new resource for mapping QTL for economically important traits and to conduct a
comparative mapping analysis to shed new insights into the evolution of fish genomes.
Results: We constructed a first generation linkage map of grass carp with a mapping panel containing two F1
families including 192 progenies. Sixteen SNPs in genes and 263 microsatellite markers were mapped to twentyfour linkage groups (LGs). The number of LGs was corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of grass
carp. The sex-specific map was 1149.4 and 888.8 cM long in females and males respectively whereas the sexaveraged map spanned 1176.1 cM. The average resolution of the map was 4.2 cM/locus. BLAST searches of
sequences of mapped markers of grass carp against the whole genome sequence of zebrafish revealed substantial
macrosynteny relationship and extensive colinearity of markers between grass carp and zebrafish.
Conclusions: The linkage map of grass carp presented here is the first linkage map of a food fish species based
on co-dominant markers in the family Cyprinidae. This map provides a valuable resource for mapping phenotypic
variations and serves as a reference to approach comparative genomics and understand the evolution of fish
genomes and could be complementary to grass carp genome sequencing project.

Background
A linkage map is an essential framework for mapping
traits of interest and is often the first step towards
understanding genome evolution and aids genome
assembly [1-4]. With the advent of molecular genetic
techniques and sophisticated statistical tools for linkage
analysis, linkage maps have been constructed for some
economically important aquaculture species, such as
channel catfish, tilapia, Asian seabass, European sea
bass, shrimps, and oysters [4]. Until last decade, dominant DNA markers such as AFLP and RAPD were used
to construct linkage maps that are now replaced by

co-dominant markers such as microsatellites and SNPs.
Microsatellites have been extensively used in construction of genetic maps for some aquaculture fishes
recently, e.g., brown trout, Salmo trutta [5], nile tilapia,
Oreochromis niloticus [6], channel catfish, Ictalurus
punctatus [7,8], Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer [9] and
blacklip abalone, Haliotis rubra [10]. With the rapid
development of DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [11],
the most frequent polymorphism in genome, became
the most favored DNA markers for linkage mapping
and whole genome association studies in humans [12]
and model organisms [13]. However, the application of
SNPs in linkage mapping of aquacultured fish is just in
its infancy [8].
Comparative mapping contributes largely to solve
issues in the evolution of individual species, differences

and similarities between various species and to characterize functions of genomes by providing a detailed analysis of conservation among orthologous intervals in
different species [14]. This would not only help to
reduce cost and increase efficiency in genetic research
across species through offering the possibility to transfer
genomic information available from model species to
nonmodel organisms, but also aids whole genome
sequence assembly as well as molecular breeding
[15-17]. The availability of an increasing number of fish
whole genome sequences (e.g., zebrafish, medaka, fugu,
stickleback and freshwater pufferfish) offer opportunities
to accelerate fish genomic comparative studies, such as,
transferring genomic information from model species to
food fish. Genetic mapping for non-model species with
sequence-based molecular markers could provide a suitable support for the knowledge of genome organization
and evolutionary studies by comparative map analysis. It
represents a key towards integrating known genome
data from model species into identifying genes in the
species of interest [15,18,19].
The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is one of
the largest members of the family Cyprinidae [20,21]. It
is an herbivorous freshwater fish of great commercial
value and is extensively cultivated in Eastern Asia for
food. Cultured grass carp may grow up fast reaching up
to 1 kg in the first year, growing approximately 2-3 kg/
year in temperate areas and 4.5 kg/year in tropical areas
[20]. Grass carp also has extensive ecological adaptability, of the 115 countries in which grass carp have been
introduced, at least 58 (~50%) appear to have self-sustaining populations [22]. In addition, due to their ability
to be cultured easily, hardiness and effective biological
controls on wide variety of aquatic vegetation; this species has been extensively used for aquatic weed control
purposes in rivers, fish ponds and reservoirs [21]. In
recent years, commercial harvesting of grass carp has
increased in many countries. According to the statistics
of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations [23], the global annual production of grass carp
summed up to 4,010,281 metric tons in 2006 with a
30% increase for past decades and was listed as the 3rd
biggest contributor to the world’s aquaculture production. The revenue generated by aquaculture of this species was over 4 billion US dollars in 2006 [23].
Therefore, the species represents one of the most promising species in world aquaculture [24]. However,
research on grass carp genomics remained at slow pace.
Although to date around 100 microsatellite sequences of
grass carp are available in GenBank database, and some
microsatellite markers have been applied in genetic
diversity and comparative analysis of grass carp [25-27],
no genetic map is available in grass carp.

The aim of this study is to construct a first generation
genetic map of grass carp using microsatellite and SNP
markers to supply a basis for genome-wide search of
QTL for economically important traits and to conduct a
comparative mapping analysis to provide new insights
into the evolution of fish genomes and to aid future
genome assembly.

Results
Markers

A total of 283 microsatellites and 24 SNP markers were
informative in the two mapping families and could be
used for linkage analysis. Four microsatellite markers
(CID131A/B, CID320A/B, CID532A/B, CID816A/B)
were scored as duplicates.
Linkage analysis

Two grass carp families containing 96 progenies in each
were scored for 307 informative loci. A total of 279 markers (263 microsatellites and 16 SNPs) were mapped to
24 linkage groups (Additional file 1: Table S1) whereas
28 remained (20 microsatellites and 8 SNPs) unmapped.
There is no significant deviation of Mendelian segregation for mapped markers after Bonferroni correction.
Using linkage analysis and LOD ≥ 3 threshold, for male
segregation data, 212 loci were finally assembled into 24
linkage groups (LGs) in both families, and for female
data, 219 loci were assembled into 24 linkage groups in
both families (Figures 1, 2 and 3 and Table 1). Among
them, 152 loci were located in both maps which could be
used to identify homologous pairs of linkage groups in
both sexes. The merged sex-specific maps in both
families showed different length. The map length for
female and male was 1149.4 cM and 888.8 cM respectively. The average spacing between loci in male map (4.2
± 1.7 cM) was lower than that in the female map (5.2 ±
1.8 cM), indicating that sex-specific differences in recombination rates existed in grass carp. Comparison of
recombination differences between the parents of two
mapping families revealed that the average recombination ratio (female: male) across all pairwise comparisons
was 2.03 [N = 287 comparisons; G-test value (1 d.f) =
1132.2] for family 1 and 2.00 [N = 307 comparisons;
G-test value (1 d.f) = 1226.9] for family 2. Therefore, a
significantly higher recombination rate was evident in the
female map but no significant family-specific difference
in overall recombination ratio for both sexes was
detected [Female (family1)/Female (family 2) = 1.02,
N = 243 comparisons, G-test value (1 d.f) = 0.91; Male
(family1)/Male (family2) = 1.01, N = 281 comparisons,
G-test value (1 d.f) = 0.29]. The distributions of recombination ratio between both parents in two mapping
families were given in Additional file 2: Figure S1.

The resulting sex-averaged map composed of 24 linkage
groups (Figures 1, 2 and 3 and Figures 4, 5 and 6) contained 279 loci. Six (CID131A, CID320A, CID320B,
CID532B, CID816A and CID816B) of the duplicate loci
were assigned to 4 linkage groups (CID_LG2, 8, 15
and19) and the remaining two were unmapped
(CID131B and CID532A). The marker order in the sexaveraged map was the same as in the sex-specific maps.

The map spanned 1176.1 cM with individual linkage
groups ranging from 23.4 to 95.2 cM (mean 49.0 ± 16.2,
Table 2). The average resolution of the map was 4.2 ±
1.6 cM ranging from 2.2 cM (CID_LG18) to 8.6 cM
(CID_LG20) for individual linkage groups. The average
number of loci per linkage group was 11.6 ± 4.1 with a
range varying from 4 (CID_LG20) to 19 loci (CID_LG2)
per linkage group. Only 2 (0.9%) out of the 221 intervals

number of markers, linkage length and map length for
the sex-specific and sex-averaged maps are given in
Table 1 and 2.
Comparative mapping

The sequences of 263 mapped microsatellites and 16
SNPs in ESTs and gene loci were used for similarity
searches against genome sequences of four model fish
species. Our results showed that 10.1% (medaka

sequences: 28 hits) to 59.2% (zebrafish: 164 hits) of the
blasted sequences were significantly conserved between
grass carp and model fish species (e < 10 -7 ; Table 3).
Between grass carp and fugu/medaka, no microsatellites
with more than 5 or more repeat motif were conserved,
whereas between grass carp and zebrafish, 43.9% of
microsatellite loci were conserved. When compared to
microsatellite data, much higher conservation (ranging
from 43.8% for medaka to 100% for zebrafish) of homologous ESTs and gene loci between grass carp and

model species was detected. Of the total 176 loci with
significant hits (e < 10 -7 ), 42 loci (23.9%) matched at
least 2 model species and 13 (7.4%) matched all the 4
model species. By syntenic detection, some blocks with
very high conservation were also found. For example, a
syntenic block defined by markers SNP0010 and
CID0278 on CID_LG1 was conserved among at least 3
species. The detailed comparative mapping results were
presented in Additional files 3-4 Tables S2 and S3.
The grass carp genetic map was utilized in the establishment of gene orthology relationships based on conserved syntenies among species. The zebrafish genome
with 25 chromosomes was fairly characterized. One
hundred and sixty-four (148 microsatellites and 16
SNPs) markers were common in grass carp linkage map
and zebrafish genome map. The marker density in the
comparative map ranged from 2 (CID_LG10) to 13
(CID_LG1 and CID_LG4) markers with an average of
6.8 ± 3.0 per LG (Table 4). These allow us to evaluate
large-scale synteny patterns between the two species.
All 24 grass carp LGs were clearly associated with
zebrafish chromosomes (Figures 4, 5 and 6 and Table
4). In most cases, the grass carp LG showed extensive

synteny towards a particular zebrafish chromosome,
sharing two or more loci with zebrafish chromosome.
The average number of syntenic loci in one pair of grass
carp LG and homologous zebrafish chromosome was
5.5 ± 2.7 with a range varying from 2 (CID_LG10DR_LG11, CID_LG20-DR_LG25, CID_LG22-DR_LG2
and CID_LG24-DR_LG22) to 11 (CID_LG1-DR_LG7)
per chromosome (Table 2). In total, 6 of the 24 grass
carp LGs (CID_LG10-DR_LG11, CID_LG15-DR_LG15,
CID_LG16-DR_LG9, CID_LG19-DR_LG24, CID_LG21DR_LG8, CID_LG23-DR_LG17) mapped each to a
single zebrafish chromosome, 12 yielded hits with
2 chromosomes, 5 with 3 chromosomes and one
(CID_LG4) mapped to 6 chromosomes (Figures 4, 5 and
6 and Table 4).
Each zebrafish chromosome was mainly syntenic to
one grass carp LG and shared ≥50% orthologous markers of the chromosome in common (Figures 4, 5 and
6). The zebrafish genome map covered by these syntenic
markers summed up to 809.5 Mb with a range of 1.1
Mb (DR_LG22) to 55.7 Mb (DR_LG6) per chromosome,
accounting for 63% of the displayed regions of zebrafish
reference genome (Table 2). A large amount of syntenic

blocks could be defined by two or more syntenic loci in
this study. This showed substantial macrosynteny relationship existed between the two species.
The extensive colinearity was very evident for some
syntenic chromosomes/linkage pairs e.g. CID_LG3DR_LG21, CID_LG5-DR_LG13, CID_LG8-DR_LG1,
CID_LG9-DR_LG12, CID_LG10-DR_LG11 but partial
collinearity was more frequently observed for other
chromosomes/linkage pairs, indicating large-scale chromosomal rearrangements were rare but small inversions
and translocations were prevailing. However, there were
few exceptions e.g. both of the zebrafish chromosomes,
DR_LG10 and DR_LG22, were mainly syntenic to one
grass carp linkage group, CID_LG24 and shared ≥50%
orthologous markers of the chromosome. In addition,
16 SNP markers mapped to 10 grass carp LGs were
assigned to 10 chromosomes of the zebrafish genome

map of which, 14 (87.5%) were found in syntenic
regions (defined with ≥50% orthologous markers). However, for the 263 mapped microsatellite markers, only
47.5% were found in syntenic regions. This data indicates a strong conservation of functional genes in the
two species.

Discussion
DNA markers and genetic maps

Genetic maps are essential tools for fish genomic studies
[28]. Development of a large number of sequence-based
genetic markers including microsatellites and SNPs is
necessary for mapping QTLs for traits of interest and
carrying out marker-assisted selection (MAS). Using 307
informative DNA makers, we have constructed a first
generation linkage map of grass carp including 263
microsatellites and 16 SNPs. Due to difficulty in scoring,

’a’, shows the conservation of orthologs, e.g., type 1 indicates unique
orthologs identified for each model species, type 2 shows orthologs identified
only in two model species (the given model species and another model
species), type 3 shows orthologs identified in three model species (the given
model species and other two model species), etc; ’b’, ratio of all orthologous
markers to the total informative markers used for similarity searches.

28 markers were not assigned to the linkage map. Two
hundred and seventy-nine loci were arranged into 24
linkage groups. Grass carp is a diploid fish with 2n = 48
chromosomes [29,30], therefore the linkage group number is corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of grass carp. According to our best knowledge, this
map is the first linkage map of a food fish species in the
family Cyprinidae exclusively based on co-dominant
markers (i.e. microsatellites and SNPs).
The genome size of grass carp estimated with a haploid C-value of 1-1.09 pg [31] and the conversion
formulas (1 pg = 978 Mb) [32] was 978-1066 Mb. The
length of the grass carp linkage map was 1176.1 cM.

“D1-25” refer to the 25 zebrafish chromosomes and “C1-24” refer to the 24 grass carp linkage groups, respectively; ‘ ’, the zebrafish chromosome number that
shows synteny to a given grass carp linkage group.
a

Therefore, the ratio between physical and linkage distance was 832 - 906 kb/cM. This figure is similar to
some other fishes, such as rainbow trout [16], but higher
than that of turbot (530 kb/cM)[19] and tiger pufferfish
(420 kb/cM) [33]. The length of the grass carp map is
far less than the linkage map of the common carp
(Cyprinus carpio; 4111 cM)[34], but similar to the
length of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix; 1150
cM) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis; 1209 cM)
genetic maps [35].
Compared to density of first-generation linkage maps
of other species, such as the turbot (6.5 cM) [19], tiger
pufferfish (7.1 cM) [33], Barramundi (4.7-6.2 cM) [9]
and olive flounder (4.7 cM) [36], the average resolution
of our map was slightly better with an average distance
of 4.2 (± 1.6) cM between loci. Therefore, such a map
would be dense enough for the initial mapping of interesting agriculture traits and facilitate future comparative
genomic analyses for understanding genome evolution.
Chinese scientists are planning to sequence the complete genome of grass carp. Therefore, this linkage map

could be complementary to a genome sequencing
project.
Sex recombination ratio

It is important to know the relative rates of recombination for both sexes of any species [37]. Significant differences in sex recombination ratios have been reported
for many fishes such as rainbow trout (F:M, 1.68:1 and
3.25:1) [16,38], zebrafish (2.74:1.0) [37], Atlantic halibut
(1.89-2.53:1) [39], European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (1.5:1) [40], turbot (1.6:1) [19], Barramundi, Lates
calcarifer (2.06:1) [9]. Family-specific recombination
rates were also demonstrated in some salmon species
[41]. These studies have shown that reduced male
recombination rates might exist extensively in teleost
fishes although it varied greatly among chromosomes
and sub-chromosomal regions. The female:male recombination rates (~ 2:1) for the parents of two families in
this study are similar to the ratios that were reported
previously. However, we observed some exceptions for
some marker intervals with higher recombination rates

Xia et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:135
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/135

in male, which have also been reported in some fishes,
such as zebrafish, trout and Barramundi [9,37,38].
Previous studies suggested many factors such as pericentromeric suppression, CpG islands, GC content,
polyA/polyT content, simple repeats, LINE, SINE elements and other sequence features would influence
recombination rate, however the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the difference between the two sexes are
still not well understood [3,37].
Comparative mapping

Both grass carp and zebrafish belong to the family
Cyprinidae with the divergence time of 63 ± 2 million
years (Mya) [26] while the time of divergence between
zebrafish and Takifugu was 290 ± 6 Mya [42]. The similarity searches against 4 model fish species reference
genomes showed that 59.2% grass carp sequences used
were considered to be significantly similar to zebrafish
genome sequences. However, much lower significant
hits ranging from 10.1% to 13.0% in Tetraodon, fugu
and medaka was found. The result is in agreement with
phylogenetic data [42], showing zebrafish was more
closely related to grass carp than other model species.
Karyotype evolution in teleosts occurred mainly by
inversion and not by fusion or fission of chromosomes
[33,43]. Since grass carp (2n = 48) and zebrafish (2n =
50) have different karyotyes and genome sizes (C-value
of 1-1.09 pg for grass carp and 1.68-2.28 pg for zebrafish) [31], the strict pairwise synteny of chromosome
pairs between grass carp and zebrafish was not expected.
Our study demonstrated extensive colinearity for some
syntenic chromosome/linkage pairs. For example, each
zebrafish chromosome was mainly syntenic to one grass
carp LG and shared ≥50% othologous markers of the
chromosome in common. This study also indicated that
substantial macrosynteny relationship, inversions and
translocations existed between grass carp and zebrafish.
Therefore, our results provide further support to the
studies of karyotype evolution in teleosts by Jaillon et al.
[43] and Kai et al. [33]. However, due to the precision
in marker order on the current grass carp linkage map
was not high enough for some markers, and reference
sequences were not free of assembly error [44], it was
possible that some of the disagreements in marker order
between grass carp and zebrafish were not accurate,
which can be confirmed by further cytogenetic studies,
such as FISH experiments.
Comparative genomics had shown the existence of
several blocks of synteny between zebrafish and human
gene maps [45]. Our study showed a strong conservation of gene order between grass carp and zebrafish and
other model species. For example, 87.5% of the genebased SNP markers and 47.5% of the flank sequencebased microsatellite markers were found in syntenic

Page 12 of 16

regions of grass carp to zebrafish; and 23.9% of the loci
with significant hits matched at least 2 model species
and 7.4% matched 4 model species. However, the conservation was different for most of the compared chromosomes between grass carp and zebrafish. This could
be reflected by differentiated homologous zebrafish
chromosome number that shows synteny to different
grass carp linkage group (ranging from 1 to 6 chromosomes for different grass carp LG). Some studies had
reported that chromosomes might be functionally partitioned [46] and large-scale genomic rearrangements
were nonrandom with nucleotide variation [47]. Bourque et al. [48] also suggested that the total number of
microrearrangements was much higher for anonymous
sequence-based data than for gene-based data, as many
of the microrearrangements in sequence-based synteny
blocks lay outside exons. These studies demonstrated
that conservation of synteny might reflect important
functional relationships at chromosomal levels.
Synteny among species or genera might also aid initial
QTL experiments with candidate gene approaches [49].
In this study, 16 SNPs derived from functional genes or
ESTs related to complex genetic basis for interesting
quantitative traits in productions such as muscle myosin
heavy chain (MHY; SNP0038), TNF-related apoptosis
inducing ligand (TRAIL; SNP0053) and c-Fos (c-fos;
SNP0067) were mapped on to the linkage map at high
confidence level. Most of them were also assigned to the
conserved synteny regions of grass carp linkage map to
zebrafish genome. The orthologous markers closely
linked to these genes on conserved chromosomes of
related model fish species might be considered to identify candidate genes and carry out MAS in further
breeding strategies of the grass carp.

Conclusions
We constructed a first generation linkage map containing 279 DNA markers (263 microsatellites and 16 SNPs
in ESTs). The marker density was 4.20 cM/locus.
Recombination rate was higher in females than in males.
This linkage map will provide important base for mapping QTL affecting economically important traits and
could be complementary to grass carp genome sequencing project. Comparative mapping between the grass
carp and other model organisms revealed that substantial macrosynteny relationship and extensive colinearity
existed between grass carp and zebrafish. Comparative
mapping will facilitate understanding genome evolution.
In near future the identification of QTL associated
traits, such as related to disease and parasite resistance
and growth rate, would be conducted with the markers
on the map. Our study also showed strong syntenic relationships and a number of conserved colineality existed
between grass carp and zebrafish genome. Therefore,

Xia et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:135
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/135

gene prediction directly from zebrafish to grass carp was
possible. Further studies focusing on the transferring of
genomic information available from zebrafish to the
selection of grass carp had been put forward. A high
density map with gene-based markers was also planned,
which would provide a detailed analysis of conservation
among orthologous intervals in related species and a
basis for location of genes and MAS of grass carp or
other Cyprinidae.

Methods
Mapping families and DNA isolation

Prior to construction of reference mapping families, 150
candidate grass carp parents (75 males and 75 females)
derived from wild populations in Yangtze and Pearl
river systems were genotyped with 6 microsatellite markers (Ci02, Ci08, Ci09, Ci11, Ci12 and Ci15) as
described previously [50] and 3 microsatellite markers
(CID0025, CID0029 and CID0037) developed in this
study. Genetic relatedness was calculated on the basis of
microsatellite genotypes [51]. Two pairs of grass carps
with the most genetic difference were selected for artificial insemination to produce F1 offspring. From each
pair, Two millions of fertilized eggs were obtained and
96 progenies at the age of one month were randomly
collected and stored in 75% ethanol for subsequent linkage analyses. Parental fin clips of 192 offspring from two
families were sampled for DNA extraction with the
method described as in Yue and Orban [52].
Development and genotyping of DNA markers

Two microsatellite-enriched partial genomic libraries
(CA and GA repeats) were constructed using DNA from
one adult grass carp according to method described by
Yue et al [53] with some minor modifications [50].
From each library, 2000 clones were sequenced in both
directions with M13 and M13 reverse primers and BigDye chemicals on an ABI 3730×l Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). The microsatellite loci containing
seven or more repeat units and enough flanking regions
were identified for primer design using the program PrimerSelect (DNASTAR, Wilmington, DE). In addition,
17 microsatellites from a previous publication [50] were
selected. Microsatellites were named as “CID” followed
by 4 numbers while duplicate markers were named as
“CID” and 3 numbers plus an “A” or “B”. In addition,
six EST-derived microsatellite loci were chosen by scanning the grass carp EST database in GenBank and their
primers flanking repeats were developed. Three of them
were mapped and given names as “EST” followed by 4
numbers.
To optimize PCR for each microsatellite, PCR reaction
was performed in 25 μL volume containing 10 ng genomic DNA, 1×PCR buffer, 100 μmol of each dNTPs, 0.2

Page 13 of 16

μmol forward primer, 0.2 μmol reverse primer and 1 U
of Taq DNA polymerase (FINNZYMES, Espoo, Finland)
on a thermal cycler (MJ Research, CA, USA) with the
following cycling profile: one denaturation step for 2
min at 95°C was followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C,
30 sec at 50°C, 55°C or 60°C and 45 sec at 72°C. The
final step was a prolonged extension of 5 min at 72°C.
PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel and
visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Five hundred
and ten primer that pairs amplified clear and strong
bands were selected for labeling with fluorescent dyes.
For each microsatellite, one primer was labeled either
FAM or HEX (1st Base, Singapore). These microsatellite
markers were selected for genotyping parents. Finally
263 microsatellite markers, being informative among
four parents, were selected for genotyping the two mapping families comprising 192 individuals. Microsatellites
were amplified on grass carp genomic DNA with fluorescent primers under the same conditions used for
amplification with unlabeled primers. PCR products
were resolved on ABI3730×l Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA) and were sized relative to an
internal size standard (GeneScan-500 ROX) using GeneMapper 3.5 software package (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA) as described previously [54].
SNPs in ESTs were detected by PCR amplification of
DNA of four parents and sequencing of PCR products.
Briefly, 63 ESTs from grass carp were downloaded from
GenBank and were aligned with genomic sequence data
from zebrafish on GenBank. Primer sites in conserved
exon regions were identified and a total of 63 primer
pairs allowing PCR amplification of an intron-spanning
fragment were developed. The primer sets were given
names as “SNP” followed by 4 numbers in the genetic
map. Fifty-five primer pairs amplified intron-spanning
fragments which were sequenced as described above to
detect SNP in the four parents. SNPs were detected in
16 ESTs. The genotyping for the 16 polymorphic SNP
markers were performed based on ABI PRISM® snapshot™ Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Two to six
SNP primers were combined in multiplex PCR reaction
and the resultant snapshot products were resolved on
ABI 3730×l Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) after
post-extension treatment with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI). Genotyping of PCR
products were carried out against the internal size standard GeneScan-120 LIZ using GeneMapper 3.5 software
package (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
Details of polymorphic markers in parents used
to construct the grass carp genetic map were summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1 and the sequences
were submitted to GenBank with accession nos
FJ883175-FJ883463.

Map construction

The sex-specific linkage maps for two mapping families
were constructed independently using the program
LINKMFEX (ver. 1.5) [55]. Genotype data for both
families were checked for inconsistencies with Mendelian inheritance and manually corrected for error. Those
markers with LOD ≥ 3 for segregation data were
assigned to the same linkage group for both mapping
families respectively using a two-point analysis. Map distances were estimated for each best likely order linkage
group using the Kosambi function with the module
MAPDIS. Integration of the sex-specific linkage maps
and construction of a sex-averaged map for two mapping families was performed using the module MERGE.
Finally, the sex-averaged linkage groups were numbered
based on their group length (from large to small,
namely, CID_LG1 to CID_LG24). The maps were visualized using MapChart software (ver. 2.1) [56]. For assessing the differences in recombination rate between
sexes, comparisons of recombination differences
between both parents in two mapping families were performed by analyzing all pairwise marker combinations
using a two-way contingency G-test as implemented in
the module RECOMDIF of the program LINKMFEX.
Comparative mapping

The flanking sequences of polymorphic microsatellite
loci and SNPs in ESTs and gene loci among parents
were used for similarity searches against the zebrafish
genomic sequences via the NIH genetic sequence database and against medaka, fugu and tetraodon genomic
sequences via the Ensembl Genome Browser under
default settings. Hits with e < 10-7 were considered as
significant. In cases where the searches hit two or more
scaffolds or loci with less than 100 fold difference in the
E-value, the genes were considered to be duplicated
within a genome, in a conservative way, no orthology
were assigned. The comparative map was drawn using
MapDisto software (ver. 1.7) [57].
