Abstract
Background: Mutations in the Otopetrin 1 gene (Otop1) in mice and fish produce an unusual bilateral vestibular
pathology that involves the absence of otoconia without hearing impairment. The encoded protein, Otop1, is the
only functionally characterized member of the Otopetrin Domain Protein (ODP) family; the extended sequence and
structural preservation of ODP proteins in metazoans suggest a conserved functional role. Here, we use the tools of
sequence- and cytogenetic-based comparative genomics to study the Otop1 and the Otop2-Otop3 genes and to
establish their genomic context in 25 vertebrates. We extend our evolutionary study to include the gene mutated
in Usher syndrome (USH) subtype 1G (Ush1g), both because of the head-to-tail clustering of Ush1g with Otop2 and
because Otop1 and Ush1g mutations result in inner ear phenotypes.
Results: We established that OTOP1 is the boundary gene of an inversion polymorphism on human chromosome
4p16 that originated in the common human-chimpanzee lineage more than 6 million years ago. Other lineagespecific evolutionary events included a three-fold expansion of the Otop genes in Xenopus tropicalis and of Ush1g
in teleostei fish. The tight physical linkage between Otop2 and Ush1g is conserved in all vertebrates. To further
understand the functional organization of the Ushg1-Otop2 locus, we deduced a putative map of binding sites for
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a mammalian insulator transcription factor, from genome-wide chromatin
immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data in mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells combined with
detection of CTCF-binding motifs.
Conclusions: The results presented here clarify the evolutionary history of the vertebrate Otop and Ush1g families,
and establish a framework for studying the possible interaction(s) of Ush1g and Otop in developmental pathways.

Background
Although bilateral vestibular pathology is an important
cause of imbalance in humans, it is underdiagnosed and
poorly understood. Approximately 50% of dizziness is
attributed to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
(BBPV), a major risk factor for falls, bone fractures, and
accidental death, particularly in the elderly [1]. The
etiology of BBPV often relates to the degeneration or
displacement of otoconia [2,3], the minute biomineral
particles in the utricle and saccule within the inner ear
involved in detecting linear acceleration and gravity [4].

Currently, there are no known human hereditary vestibular disorders attributed to mutations in genes selectively affecting otoconial development or maintenance.
Otopetrin 1 (Otop1) is one of a handful of known genes
that, when mutated, cause an imbalance phenotype with
selective otoconial involvement in animal models [4,5].
In the mouse, Otop1 is expressed in the supporting cells
of the sensory epithilium patches (maculae) of the utricule and saccule from embryonic day 13.5 to adulthood,
as well as in several other tissues [6]. In contrast, Otop1
expression in zebrafish is predominantly restricted to
the hair cells of the sensory epithelium and the neuromasts of the lateral line organ [7,8]. Specific Otop1
mutations have been reported in mouse (tilted [tlt, [9]],
mergulhador [mlh, [10]], and inner ear defect [ied, [11]])

and zebrafish (backstroke [bks, [8]]). Despite the interspecies differences in Otop1-expression patterns, mutant
mice and fish lack otoconia and otoliths respectively in
all cases, but otherwise have normal inner ear structures, hearing, and overall development. Similarly, the
knockdown of Otop1 in mouse and zebrafish results in a
phenocopy of the selective lack of otoconia/otoliths seen
in the mutants [6,7].
The Otop gene family in most vertebrates is comprised of three members clustered on two chromosomes: Otop1 (e.g., mouse chromosome 5) and the
paralogous tandem genes Otop2 and Otop3 (e.g., mouse
chromosome 11). The origins of the Otop gene family
have been traced far back in metazoans [12]; for example, the phylogenetic relationships of vertebrate Otop
and arthropod and nematode Otop-like proteins (also
DUF270 proteins [10,12]) have been deduced from 62
open reading frames in 25 species, demonstrating that
they constitute a single family, named the Otopetrin
Domain Protein (ODP) family. Fragmentary, but clearly
ODP-related, sequences have also been identified in urochordates (Ciona), echinoderms (urchin), and cnidarians
(Nematostella) (unpublished data). Signature features of
ODP proteins are 12 transmembrane domains organized
into three “Otopetrin Domains” (highly conserved
among metazoans) and a highly constrained predicted
loop structure. Although ODP proteins do not show
homology to any transporter, channel, exchanger, or
receptor families, the extensive sequence and structural
similarity among them suggests a conserved functional
role(s) [12]. It has been postulated that Otop1 inhibits
P2Y purinergic receptor-mediated calcium release in
macular epithelial cells in a calcium-dependent manner,
and promotes an influx of calcium in response to ATP
during otoconial development [6,13]. In this model,
Otop1 acts as a sensor of the extracellular calcium concentration near supporting cells, and responds to ATP
in the endolymph to increase intracellular calcium levels
during otoconia mineralization. Otop2 and Otop3 functions remain unknown.
The larger syntenic context of the Otop1 and tandem
Otop2-Otop3 genomic loci may reflect lineage-specific
genomic features and gene associations worthy of
exploration. For instance, established genetic and physical maps of the Otop1-containing region suggest an
inverted gene order in the mouse and human genomes
[14,15]; further, in these genomes, the Otop2-Otop3
gene tandem is physically clustered (head-to-tail) with
the Usher syndrome (USH) subtype 1G gene (USH1G;
also called SANS). USH1G encodes a scaffold protein
with three ankyrin repeats and a SAM domain, which is
preferentially expressed in tissues containing motile
cilia, such as cochlea and retina [16,17]. Mouse Ush1g
on chromosome 11 and its human ortholog USH1G on

Page 2 of 18

chromosome 17 are mutated in the Jackson shaker (js)
mouse mutant and in human USH1G patients, respectively. The former is a recessive condition associated
with deafness, circling, and disorganization of the hair
cell bundles (stereocilia) [16]; the latter is also a recessive condition characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and prepubertal onset of visual loss
(retinitis pigmentosa) [18]. USH is generally a clinically
and genetically heterogeneous disease and the most
common cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans
[19]; invariably, USH is associated with highly disorganized stereocilia.
Ush1g and Otop1 thus play important roles in the vestibular (Ush1g and Otop1), auditory (Ush1g), and visual
(Ush1g) systems in vertebrates. In addition to the experimentally confirmed expression of Ush1g in the mouse and
human inner ear and retina [16,17] and of Otop1 in the
mouse and zebrafish inner ear [7,10], an Otop-like gene
(Nlo, for neural crest-lateral otic vesicle localization) is
expressed in the anterior placodal ectoderm area of the X.
laevis embryo that forms both the eye lens and otic vesicle
neurogenic placodes [20]. Furthermore, analyses of
expressed-sequence tag (EST) databases reveal evidence
for expression of Otop1, Otop2, and Otop3 in the mouse
and human retina. The challenge remains to establish
whether Ush1g and Otop participate in common developmental pathways affecting ear and/or eye physiology.
To examine the evolutionary diversity of Otop and
Ush1g and their larger genomic context in vertebrates,
we performed a comprehensive comparative genomic
study that analyzed 25 available genome sequences
(from fish to human) and sequenced bacterial artificialchromosome (BAC) clones from seven species. Through
cytogenetic and comparative genomic methods, we
established that OTOP1 is the boundary gene of an
inversion polymorphism on human chromosome 4p16
that originated in the common human-chimpanzee lineage more than 6 million years ago. We could further
infer evolutionary scenarios for gene family expansions
in individual lineages, including a three-fold expansion
of the Otop family in Xenopus tropicalis and the Ush1g
family in fish lineages. Ush1g genes have remained
tightly linked to Otop2-related sequences throughout
vertebrate evolution, raising questions about whether
they are functionally insulated or whether they participate in common developmental pathways. To further
understand their functional organization, we deduced
and analyzed a map of putative CCCTC-binding factor
(CTCF)-binding sites within the Ushg1-Otop2 locus.
These analyses offer some hints about chromatin organization of the Ush1g-Otop2 locus in mouse and human,
and are a resource for further investigating the role of
mammalian insulator CTCF in orchestrating gene
expression at this locus.

Results
Comparative sequence data sets

We sought to characterize the genomic regions encompassing Otop1 and the Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 cluster in a
diverse set of vertebrates. As the reference sequence for
these studies, we extracted relevant portions of the
NCBI mouse genome sequence (build 37; [21]), specifically, the intervals containing Otop1 on chromosome
5B2 and Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 on chromosome 11E2, plus
the 100-kb segments immediately flanking each interval
(see Materials and Methods). The human sequence was
an unsuitable reference because the human OTOP1
locus diverged significantly from the orthologous regions
in most other vertebrate genomes (see below).
We compiled the homologous sequences of these two
genomic regions from 25 vertebrate species for comparative analyses (Table 1). For seven species, we isolated [22] and sequenced [23] BAC clones spanning one
or both of the targeted genomic regions (Table 2); these
efforts generated ~3.8 Mb of high-quality sequence data
[24] specifically for this study. For the remaining species
(and in cases where we were unable to isolate suitable
BACs from the species listed in Table 2), the orthologous sequences were retrieved from whole-genome
sequence assemblies available on the UCSC Genome
Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). With few exceptions
(i.e., hedgehog and platypus), the generated data sets
contain orthologous sequences of the Otop1 and the
Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 loci from multiple phylogenetic
lineages.
Evolutionary history of the Otop1 locus in vertebrates

In 20 of the 25 vertebrate genomes studied, the immediate genomic context for Otop1 is identical (with Otop1
flanked by Tmem128 and Drd5 on the 5’ and 3’ side,
respectively; Figure 1a). For three of the remaining species (cow, marmoset, and hedgehog), there were insufficient sequence data to draw firm conclusions about the
genomic context of Otop1. In X. tropicalis, instead of a
single Otop1 gene, Tmem128 and Drd5 flank two closely
spaced Otop1 genes, which we have named Otop1a and
Otop1b (Figure 1b; and additional file 1).
In our maximum likelihood analysis of the Otop family
(Figure 2), the Otop1a-encoding gene resides within a
clade containing the mammalian Otop1-encoding genes,
while the Otop1b-encoding gene resides within a sister
clade. A strict interpretation of this tree (Figure 2)
requires the loss of an Otop1b gene in the lineage leading
to mammals. Having the genomic sequence of the
Otop1-containing region of X. laevis or another amphibian might be useful for timing this genomic event
(note that it has not been determined whether the
X. laevis genome contains multiple Otop1 genes). The
X. tropicalis Otop1a and Oto1b genes encode predicted

Page 3 of 18

proteins that are 69% identical to each other at the
amino-acid sequence level, and 72% and 65% identical
to the mouse Otop1 protein, respectively. Otop1a more
closely resembles mammalian Otop1, suggesting that,
upon duplication, Otop1b may have acquired novel
functions.
The most dramatic difference in the architecture of
the OTOP1-containing genomic region is in the human
genome, in which OTOP1 is the boundary gene of a
submicroscopic inversion polymorphism on chromosome 4p16. In the inverted configuration (represented in
the hg17 reference sequence), OTOP1 and DRD5 are
separated by ~5 Mb, with the break in synteny (with
respect to mouse chromosome 5) occurring immediately
adjacent to the 3’ end of OTOP1 (Figure 1c). All genes
in this large genomic segment have the opposite orientation to most other vertebrate genomes studied.
The inversion polymorphism on human chromosome
4p16 was previously observed in a heterozygous state in
12.5% of a Caucasian population [15]. Large (e.g., ~5
Mb) inversions are uncommon in the human genome;
in fact, within euchromatin, there are relatively few
greater than 1 Mb. We thus sought to clarify the evolutionary origins of this inversion by comparisons with
three non-human primate species serving as outgroups.
The orientation of the OTOP1-containing region was
validated by three-color interphase fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) [25] studies involving a single
human individual, five chimpanzees, three orangutans,
and one macaque. To visualize the inversion, we
selected two probes inside (red and blue) and one outside (green) the inverted region. The presence of an
inversion changes the order of the red and blue probes
and their position relative to the green probe (Figure 3).
These results demonstrate the inversion of the OTOP1containing region in the human individual and in all
chimpanzees sampled, but not in any orangutan or
macaque studied, suggesting that the inversion might
have occurred in the shared human-chimpanzee lineage
and could still reflect a polymorphism in humans. It is
not possible to establish the polymorphic or fixed status
of this inversion in the chimpanzee lineage because of
the small number of chimpanzees studied (five).
Evolutionary history of the human chromosome 4p16
inversion breakpoints

The polymorphic OTOP1-containing inverted segment
is flanked by ~260-kb duplicated segments, also referred
to as segmental duplications (SD; Figure 1d; and additional file 2). These are highly similar sequences (>95%
sequence identity) located near the OTOP1-proximal
and OTOP1-distal inversion breakpoints at positions
~4 Mb and ~9 Mb on human chromosome 4 (referred
to as positions Chr4:4 and Chr4:9, respectively, by

inverted configuration, suggesting that they originated
by a non-allelic homologous recombination event. Each
SD consists of a mosaic of duplicated sequences originating from multiple chromosomes, most likely compiled in a step-wise fashion [27,28]. The immediate
boundary region between OTOP1 and the OTOP1-

proximal duplicon contains one retroposed pseudogene
(ΨUNC93B1). Both SD boundaries are enriched for
olfactory receptor (OR)-gene sequences from the 7E
subfamily [29]; specifically, each cluster of 7E OR
sequences consists of one or more ~13-kb segment(s)
containing a 7E OR gene interspersed with LINEs,

HERVE retroviruses arranged in a characteristic pattern
(Figure 1d; also see [29]).
Of note, the OTOP1-distal SD (also flanked by clusters
of OR-gene sequences) lies immediately adjacent to the
RS447 megasatellite, a tandem repetitive sequence containing copies of the deubiquitinating enzyme gene
USP17 (Figure 1d). Bioinformatic analyses have revealed
the presence of a less-conserved, minor RS447 locus on
human chromosome 8p23, which is relevant to our
study (as discussed below).
We next analyzed a map of known SDs in the primate
genome [30,31] to infer the evolutionary history of the
OTOP1-flanking SD. As depicted in Figure 4a (and
expanded in additional file 3), this family of SDs, also
called the tumor break-prone segmental duplication
(TBSD) family [26], is specific to great apes, emerging
and spreading out in hominid genomes since the divergence of the human, chimpanzee, and orangutan common ancestor from the macaque lineage, roughly 12-16
million years ago. All SDs belonging to the TBSD family
are >95% identical and have distinctive boundaries
enriched in 7E OR genes, LTR-containing retroviruses,
and copies of the retroposed pseudogene ΨUNC93B1.
The phylogenetic relationships among the 7E OR genes
have been studied by others [29] revealing unique features, such as a high frequency of gene conversion with
distant neighbors and evidence of inter-and intra-chromosomal duplication events. This pattern is distinct
from the entire set of human SDs, of which 86% duplicated intra-chromosomally [32]. Collectively, these data
support the idea that the highly similar 7E OR gene
clusters at the boundaries of TBSD family members may
predispose to chromosome breakage and rearrangement;
this likely reflects the history of the human chromosome

4p16 inversion described here. Additional details about
the TBSD family in primates can be found in additional
files 4, 5, and 6.
Our analyses also revealed a second SD (~60 kb in
size) in the human genome containing OTOP1- and
TMEM128-like sequences (ΨOTOP1 and ΨTEM128,
respectively; Figure 4a and 4b). Here, the boundaries
lacked the distinctive features of the TBSD family members. This small duplication most likely resulted from a
typical duplication-shadowing event [30,31]. Furthermore, oligonucleotide-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) [30] confirmed that this duplicated
segment is present in single copy in human and gorilla
genomes but, interestingly, not in the chimpanzee or
bonobo genomes (additional file 3). This duplication
pattern is inconsistent with the generally accepted
human-great ape phylogeny; such a scenario may have
arisen from a deletion event in the chimpanzee lineage,
incomplete lineage sorting or, less likely, a recurrent
duplication event in the human and gorilla lineages [30].
In the human genome, this 60-kb duplicon resides in
the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2 (Figure
4b). Human ΨOTOP1 is 96% identical to OTOP1 at the
sequence level, but contains multiple stop codons and
indels (e.g., complete deletion of exon 4); it is thus unlikely to encode a functional protein. However, the promoter associated with ΨOTOP1 may still be active, as
multiple truncated ΨOTOP1 ESTs exist in GenBank
(grouped within UniGene Hs.615109).

Figure 1 Genomic architecture of the Otop1 locus in vertebrates. (a) Mouse genomic region encompassing Otop1. The relative positions
and transcriptional orientation of the indicated genes are drawn to scale, with the genomic structure of Otop1 provided in greater detail. The
identical organization of genes within the depicted genomic region is also found in orangutan, macaque, galago, rat, guinea pig, horse, cat, dog,
armadillo, opossum, platypus, chicken, and stickleback. (b) X. tropicalis genomic region encompassing Otop1 genes. Note the presence of two
paralogous Otop1 genes (Otop1a and Otop1b), but otherwise the same general gene organization as in mouse. (c) Human genomic region
encompassing OTOP1 showing the inversion separating OTOP1 and DRD5. The ~5-Mb inverted segment is flanked by large, highly similar SDs
arranged in a palindromic fashion. The connecting blue lines indicate regions of paralogy between the proximal and distal duplicons (see also
additional file 2 for additional pair-wise homology information). The underlying structure of each duplicon-containing region is depicted by
colored vertical lines. Selected gene annotations from the UCSC Genome Browser RefSeq track are also shown: OTOP1 (red), genes residing in
proximity to Otop1 in panels (a) and (b) (blue), genes within the RS447 megasatellite (green), and genes inverted in the human genome
compared to species’ genomes (orange). (d) Fine structure of the SDs flanking OTOP1 and the RS447 megasatellite in the human genome. Each
duplicon is a mosaic of smaller duplicated segments that are labeled and colored based on their ancestral cytogenetic band of origin.
Sequencing gaps in the hg17 sequence assembly of the human genome are indicated with pink lines, while the gene content is annotated
below each duplicon. Note the 7E OR clusters residing at each duplicon boundary (black boxes) and palindromic configuration of the proximal
and distal duplicons.

Figure 2 Phylogeny of the Otop family in amphibians.
Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the multisequence alignment of 19 Otop proteins identified in amphibian,
mouse, human, and dog. Proteins are labeled as Xtr_ for X. tropicalis,
Xlv_ for X. laevis, mus_ for mouse, homo_ for human, and dog_ for
dog. Three distinct clades divide the Otop family into three
subfamilies: Otop1, Otop2, and Otop3 (colored red, green, and blue,
respectively). Amphibian Otop3 genes appear to have undergone
additional gene-duplication events, creating lineage-specific
paralogs (designated a to c following the gene symbol). We have
applied the same naming convention to the X. tropicalis Otop1
(Otop1a and Otop1b) and Otop2 (Otop2a, Otop2b, and Otop2c)
genes, although it is less clear if the duplication events giving rise
to these multiple copies occurred in the amphibian lineage or are
more ancient (with the genes then getting lost in the mammalian
lineage). Branch labels are bootstrap values for 1000 replicates.

and Otop3 have the same orientation and are separated
by a 2.4-kb intergenic region, while Ush1g has the opposite transcriptional orientation. Based on analyses of
mouse ESTs, Otop2-derived transcripts yield three alternatively spliced variants derived from the use of four
non-coding first exons (1a to 1d) as well as two internal
splice sites in exon 1d and the non-coding portion of
exon 2 (Figure 5a inset). The presence of exon 1a, 1b, or
1c in an Otop2-derived transcript is mutually exclusive
of the others, while all transcripts share parts of exon 1d
and the non-coding portion of exon 2. Consistent with
its presence in all Otop2-derived splice forms, exon 1d is
highly conserved among vertebrates (e.g., mouse and
opossum exon 1 d are 60% identical at the nucleotide
level, with highly conserved canonic donor and acceptor
splice sites), and the exon’s internal acceptor splice site
is conserved across rodents, primates, carnivores, and
ungulates. Exon 1c is well conserved among vertebrates,
with the exception of mouse and rat, which have divergent sequences but a conserved splice-donor site.

Figure 3 Inversion analysis of the genomic region encompassing
OTOP1. Three-color interphase FISH using probes WIBR2-1849E16
(red), WIBR2-1416B12 (blue), and WIBR2-1634L14 (green) was used to
determine the orientation of the OTOP1-containing region in the
human (HSA), chimpanzee (PTR: Marcus, Cochise, Douglas, Katie, and
Veronica), orangutan (PPY; PPY9, PPY6, and Susie), and macaque
(MMU) genomes. The inversion changes the order of the red and blue
probes (mapping inside of the inversion) and their relative position
with respect to the green probe (mapping outside of the inversion).
FISH results show inversion of the region in human and chimpanzee
with respect to orangutan and macaque.

Finally, exons 1 a and 1 b show neither sequence nor
donor splice-site conservation among vertebrates except
in mouse and rat, suggesting that these exons may be
rodent-specific. Thus, Ush1g is not adjacent to, but
embedded within, the first intron of Otop2 in rodent
genomes due to the presence of lineage-specific Otop2
untranslated exons.
An identical repertoire of genes near the Ush1gOtop2-Otop3 locus is present in 18 of the 25 genomes

vertebrates, see Figure 2). (c) Stickleback genomic regions

recover a sequence for this genomic region); and Xenopus and the five fish lineages (all of which have notably
different structures for this genomic region).
The Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 locus is markedly different in
frog and fish lineages compared to the other vertebrates

Hurle et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:23

studied. Specifically, the X. tropicalis genome contains
only one copy of the Ush1g gene (similar to other vertebrate genomes), but Otop2 and Otop3 are uniquely
expanded into a cluster of six paralogous genes (Figure
5b). A maximum likelihood (ML) unrooted tree that
includes all known amphibian, mouse, human, and dog
Otop sequences is shown in Figure 2. Three well-supported clades representing the Otop1, Otop2, and
Otop3 subfamilies (labeled in red, green, and blue,
respectively) are seen, indicating that the genome of the
last common ancestor of placental mammals and
amphibians (~320-360 million years ago) had at least
three Otop paralogs.
Determining the timing of the Otop duplication events
is difficult. The tree in Figure 2 suggests that the ancestry of Otop1- and Otop2-encoding genes may have been
shaped by a combination of ancient duplication events
and mammalian-specific gene loss. Alternatively, our
tree may be thrown off by to the asymmetric evolutionary rates of daughter genes following duplication and
divergence–with the duplicate that retains the ancestral
function evolving more slowly than the other(s) (see discussion in Larroux et al., [33]). Including additional X.
laevis Otop1 and Otop2 sequences (if they exist and are
found in the future) may help break longer branches
and clarify these relationships. On the other hand, the
Otop3 scenario seems to be more clearly a result of
amphibian-specific duplication. Furthermore, the topology of the two X. laevis Otop3-like sequences (Nlo [20]
and this study) suggests that at least one of the Otop3
duplication events occurred prior to the last common
ancestor of X. laevis and X. tropicalis. Notably, Nlo is
expressed within the non-neural ectoderm surrounding
the anterior neural plate of X. laevis embryos; at tailbud
stages, Nlo is expressed in the dorsolateral region of
the otic vesicle, which later gives rise to the gravity
organs. Given the phylogenetic relationship of Nlo and
Otop3 as well as the apparent role of amphibian Nlo,
mouse Otop1, and zebrafish Otop1 in the development
of the vestibular system, it seems possible that the
ancestral Otop gene was involved in vestibular system
development.
We examined whole-genome sequence assemblies for
five fish species (zebrafish, Danio rerio; tetraodon, Tetraodon nigroviridis; fugu, Takifugu rubripes; stickleback,
Gasterosteus aculeatus; and medaka, Oryzias latipes). We
emphasize our analyses of the stickleback genome in Figure 5c because its whole-genome sequence assembly
included the best coverage of the Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3
locus among fish. Consistent with the whole-genome
duplication that occurred in teleost fish lineage subsequent to its divergence from mammalian ancestors
~230 million years ago [34], the Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3
locus occupies two locations in the stickleback genome.

One segment (not assigned to a chromosome, ChrUn:
25945000-25970000) shows conserved synteny with
other vertebrate genomes, with Fads6, Ush1ga, Otop2,
and C17orf28 similarly ordered and oriented (but not
Otop3; see Figure 5c). The other segment, residing on
chromosome XI, appears to result from duplication and
rearrangement events, yielding broken synteny among
the genes (Figure 5c); this region is not fully characterized, but in the stickleback whole genome assembly it
contains at least two Otop2-related genes (Otop2d and
Otop2e), one Otop3-related gene (Otop3d), and two
copies of Ush1g (Ush1gb and Ush1gc). Note that Ush1ga
and Ush1gb (but not Ush1gc) have remained close to
Otop-related sequences. A total of 15 Ushg1 genes were
annotated in the whole-genome sequence assemblies of
the five fish (for the complete listing and coordinates
of all fish Ushg1 genes see additional files 7, 8, 9, 10
and 11). Multi-species comparisons of the predicted protein sequences revealed that the defining architectural
features of Ush1g in placental mammals (i.e., three
ankyrin domains and a SAM domain) are highly conserved in the three fish Ush1g paralogs, with most
sequence variation residing within the central region of
the protein of unknown function (additional file 12).
Conserved non-coding sequences within the Ush1gOtop2-Otop3 locus

We next set out to identify conserved non-coding
sequences of potential functional relevance within the
~40-kb Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 locus. We analyzed the
high-quality sequences generated from galago, dog,
armadillo, cow, and hedgehog in conjunction with the
orthologous mouse and human sequences from the
UCSC Genome Browser. The X. tropicalis sequence was
not included in this analysis because its unique Otop
family expansion complicates the alignment of non-coding sequences with other species’ sequences. ExactPlus
[35] was used to identify multi-species conserved
sequences (MCSs) within the multi-sequence alignments. MCSs overlapping known coding sequences were
removed, thereby enriching conserved non-coding
sequences. The resulting set of 67 non-coding MCSs
(from 7-31 bp long and averaging 12 bp) together span
806 bp (2%) of the analyzed interval.
To assess ExactPlus’ performance, we compared its
output with data from the “PhastCons Conserved Elements, 30-way Vertebrate Multiz Alignment” track on
the UCSC Human Genome Browser; this track depicts
the top 5% most-conserved MCSs based on PhastCons
analyses of 30 vertebrate genome sequences [36].
Roughly 350 bp of non-coding sequence were identified
by both ExactPlus and PhastCons, accounting for ~0.8%
of the analyzed ~40-kb interval. The first intron of
USH1G, in particular, appears to contain a set of

Hurle et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/23

Page 10 of 18

regulatory sequences with characteristics that are well
conserved among vertebrates: a uniform intron size of
~2.2 kb; virtual absence of repetitive elements across
species; and richer in highly conserved non-coding elements than the surrounding genomic regions (see additional file 13 for the complete listing and coordinates of
non-coding MCSs identified by ExactPlus and
PhastCons).
An open question is whether there are non-coding
sequences in and around the Ushg1-Otop2 locus that act
as ‘functional boundaries’- either to insulate these genes
from each other or to orchestrate their regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) combines chromatin immunoprecipitation of a DNA-binding
protein with high-throughput DNA sequencing and

a

mapping of the ‘sequence tags’ to a reference genome.
An obvious candidate for organizing chromatin domains
is the mammalian insulator CTCF. We thus mined data
from in vivo genome-wide ChIP-seq studies in human
and mouse ES cells for CTCF ‘sequence tags’ that map
to the Ush1g-Otop2 locus (Duke/UNC/UT-Austin/EBI
ENCODE group [http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu] and
Chen et al., [37], respectively). Four putative CTCFbinding sites (Figure 6a) were found with the following
species-specific occupancies: CTCF1 (located at the 3’
end of Ush1g) and CTCF4 (within exon6 of Otop2),
mouse-specific; CTCF2 (within exon 2 of Ush1g)
human-specific; and CTCF3 (in between Ushg1 and
Otop2) occupied in mouse and human ES cells. Notably,
the binding of CTCF to CTCF3 has been replicated in

CTCF2 and CTCF3 are presented based on the coordinates in the mouse genome. Based on these data, four CTCF-binding sites (CTCF1 to
CTCF4) were identified with the following species-specific occupancy: CTCF1 and CTCF4, mouse-specific; CTCF2, human-specific; and CTCF3, both
mouse and human. The mouse Ushg1 and Otop2 gene structures (b) and CpG-island content (c) were derived from the RefSeq and CpG island

medium-, and high-occupancy CTCF-binding sites (LowOc, MedOc and HighOc, respectively) are also shown; these classes are based on the
degree to which the CTCF-binding sites match the known CTCF-binding motif and the densities of sequence reads mapped at the binding sites
[40,41].

Hurle et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:23

all available genome-wide ChIP-Seq studies, including
resting human CD4+T cells [38], five differentiated noncancerous, karyotypically normal human cell lines (Figure 6a), and a number of immortalized human cancer
cell lines ([39] and http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu; data
not shown).
In silico analyses confirmed consensus CTCF-binding
motifs within the sequence of all four CTCF-binding
locations (Figure 6f) [40]. Typical CTCF-binding sites
are 20 bp long, with two conserved cores: one spanning
bases 4-8 and the other bases 10-18 (Figure 6f). Furthermore, CTCF-binding sites can be grouped into low-,
medium-, and high-occupancy sites (LowOc, MedOc,
and HighOc, respectively) depending upon how closely
they match the consensus CTCF-binding motif and the
reported density of mapped tags. Each class has statistically divergent features, suggesting distinct functional
roles [41]. CTCF3 contains a HighOc binding site that
is highly conserved across placental mammals. Statistically, HighOc sites tend to be more conserved than
their flanking regions, are ubiquitously bound by CTCF,
and act as chromatin barriers less often than LowOc
sites; however, paradoxically, they have a greater tendency to delimit domains of co-regulated genes [41].On
the other hand, CTCF2 (not occupied in mouse ES cells
and some differentiated human cell lines) contains a
LowOc motif. LowOc binding motifs demonstrate
greater conservation in their flanking regions compared
to HighOc sites, and tend to be cell-specific, with
CTCF-binding being more variable between cell types
than at HighOc sites. LowOc sites have been proposed
to play a role in establishing chromatin barriers. Neither
CTCF2- nor CTCF3-binding motifs are conserved in
non-placental vertebrates (data not shown).
CTCF1 and CTCF4 are only occupied in mouse ES
cells. Of note, the spacing of the cores within the
CTCF1 motif was uniquely lost in human, chimpanzee,
and gorilla due to the deletion of spacer base 9; otherwise the binding motif is conserved in placental mammals. Also, CTCF4 contains a strong CTCF-binding site
(5’ -GAGACCTGCAGGGGGCGCTC) in the mouse
genome, although the binding motif is biased towards
less-commonly reported bases (e.g., an almost fixed T in
position 10, instead of an A) in other placental
mammals.

Discussion
In this study, we used comparative genome sequencing
and cytogenetics to examine the evolutionary history
and the genomic context of three Otop genes in 25 evolutionarily diverse vertebrate species. We also extended
our evolutionary studies to the Ush1g deafness gene
because of the tight head-to-tail physical clustering of
Ush1g with Otop2 and Otop3 in vertebrate genomes,

Page 11 of 18

and because mutations in Otop1 and Ush1g result in
inner ear phenotypes in vertebrates. Based on our analyses, we conclude that the evolution of the Otop family
in hominoids, amphibians, and rodents significantly
departs from that of most vertebrate genomes, as does
the evolution of Ush1g in the teleostei fish lineages.
The most striking difference found between hominoid
species and other vertebrates is that the OTOP1 locus is
flanked by a large SD of high complexity and sequence
identity, belonging to the TBSD family, and arranged in
an inverted orientation. Furthermore, OTOP1 sits only
3 kb away from the OTOP1-proximal inversion boundary.
Thus, the immediate genomic context of human OTOP1
differs significantly from that of mouse and zebrafish, the
only other vertebrates in which Otop1 has been closely
studied [4,10]. Therefore, information on regulation of
mouse and zebrafish Otop1 may not accurately reflect
human OTOP1 regulation, and/or Otop1 developmental
and biochemical function(s) in mouse and fish may be
represented by another OTOP gene in humans. Using
cytogenetic and comparative genomic approaches, we
examined the evolutionary history of the hominoid Otop1
locus, including the flanking TBSD duplicons. Our findings indicate that the TBSD family emerged at some point
after the divergence of the human, chimpanzee, and orangutan common ancestor from the macaque lineage
~12-16 million years ago, and later underwent significant
expansion (perhaps within the common ancestor of the
great apes). Further, these SDs contribute to plasticity and
instability in multiple regions of the genome [26].On
human chromosome 4p16 we describe a large (~5 Mb)
inversion polymorphism flanked by palindromic TBSD
sequences with OTOP1 as the boundary gene; this polymorphic arrangement, occurring in one in eight individuals of the Caucasian population, likely originated in the
common human-chimpanzee lineage prior to ~6 million
years ago.
Our studies, combined with others [42], have yielded a
predicted timeline of genomic events affecting human
chromosome loci 4p16 and 8p23 that have contributed
to the structural complexity and genomic instability of
the OTOP1 locus in humans; this timeline highlights
interesting evolutionary parallels between these two
regions. The macaque and mouse genomes are orthologous across the Otop1 locus, meaning that Otop1 and
Drd5 are tightly linked, with no evidence for the presence of 7E OR gene clusters, complex SDs, or RS447
microsatellite sequences. RS447 sequences are, however,
present in the macaque region orthologous to human
chromosome 8p23. In orangutan, clusters of 7E OR and
RS447 sequences reside close to each other in both
regions, yet there is no evidence for complex mosaic
duplications or inversions in either location. Chimpanzee (and bonobo) show increased copy number of the

Hurle et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/23

RS447 megasatellite on chromosome 4p16 (as deduced
by array CGH; see additional file 3) and evidence for
significant expansion of the TBSD family across a number of chromosomes. Furthermore, inversion polymorphisms of similar size (~5 Mb) have been reported
on chromosomes 8p23 and 4p16 in humans and
chimpanzees.
The mechanism underlying such genomic rearrangements is not completely clear. One possible scenario is
that flanking clusters of SDs triggered the inversions
via a non-allelic homologous recombination event
([42]; and present study). Alternatively, rather than
rearrangements being mediated by the duplications
themselves, the inversions could have helped to create
the complex segmental duplication architecture present
at their breakpoints [43]. Whatever the causal mechanism, the frequency of 8p23 and 4p16 inversion polymorphisms is relatively high in the human population,
oftentimes with serious consequences for double heterozygotes. Specifically, mothers who are double heterozygotes for the inversion polymorphisms on
chromosomes 4p16 and 8p23 are prone to recurrent
de novo t(4;8)(p16;p23) translocations through unusual
meiotic exchanges, resulting in offspring with WolfHirschhorn syndrome. The phenotype of patients with
this syndrome consists of mental retardation and an
array of developmental defects, often including hypotonia (decreased muscle tone; [15,44,45]). It is conceivable that individuals broadly labeled hypotonic might
also suffer from vestibular dysfunction, which could go
undiagnosed because it is often not clinically assessed.
It would thus be interesting to study Wolf-Hirschhorn
syndrome patients with balanced t(4;8)(p16;p23) translocations in search of individuals with disrupted or
dysregulated OTOP1 (via OTOP1 copy number
changes, formation of OTOP1 chimeras, or altered
OTOP1 position). The resulting physiological consequences could include complete abrogation of OTOP1
function, haploinsufficiency, elevated OTOP1 expression, or creation of a fusion protein with a dominantnegative effect or novel gain of function [46], any of
which would contribute to our understanding of the
role of OTOP1 in human development.
X. tropicalis is the other vertebrate in which we found
significant differences in genomic organization of the
Otop family. Specifically, the X. tropicalis genome contains multiple paralogs for each Otop gene. We have
determined that amphibian Nlo has a phylogenetic relationship to Otop3-like genes. Both Nlo and Otop1 are
apparently involved in the development of the vestibular
system in amphibians and placental mammals, respectively, suggesting that multiple Otop genes may have
roles in vestibular system development. Studying the
degree of sub-functionalization of Otop paralogs in X.

tropicalis may help to define the unique functions attributable to each paralog.
Amphibians and other vertebrates share similar auditory and vestibular physiology, with their vestibular
organs particularly well conserved in position, structure,
and function [47]. However, a striking difference is the
unusual calcium carbonate crystalline forms of amphibian otoconia. The general trend during vertebrate evolution has been a replacement of otoconial vaterite and
aragonite crystals by calcite, a calcium carbonate crystal
polymorph of increased stability [48]. Such a trend correlates with the transition of vertebrates from aquatic to
terrestrial life. Chondrostei fish have vaterite and/or aragonite crystals, teleostean fish only have aragonitic otoliths, and both mammalian and avian otoconia consist
exclusively of calcite crystals. During vertebrate evolution, calcitic otoconia appeared for the first time in the
amphibian inner ear, yielding an intriguing intermediate
situation with two crystalline forms: calcite in the utricle
and aragonite in the saccule, lagena, and endolymphatic
sac [49-52].
The structural variation of otoconia among vertebrates
is thought to result from different properties of their
scaffold proteins. However, the main scaffold protein in
amphibians, otoconin-22 (Oc-22), is produced in most
portions of the developing inner ear (i.e., saccule, crista
ampularis, endolymphatic sac, and utricule [51]), making
it unclear how two entirely different crystalline forms of
otoconia are regionally specified during amphibian
development. Therefore, additional factors unique to
either the utricule (with calcitic otoconia) or saccule
(with aragonitic otoconia) likely lead to distinct regional
nucleation and crystal growth during otoconial formation in amphibians. Reverse genetic screens that might
clarify the peculiarities of otoconial formation in amphibians have been impossible to undertake because animal
models with clean, non-syndromic balance phenotypes
are generally very rare [4], to the point that frog
mutants with complete otoconial agenesis have yet to be
described. In this regard, a candidate gene approach
involving targeted disruption of Otop genes in X. tropicalis, individually or in combinations, could help discern
whether different Otop paralogs have acquired discrete
functions contributing to the regional differences in otoconial formation; such a study could be performed using
morpholinos, which have been successfully used to specifically examine the role of Otop1 in vestibular system
development in zebrafish [7] and general otic vesicle
development in Xenopus [53].
Of the 16,000 deaf-blind persons in the United States,
more than half are believed to have Usher syndrome
(USH), a combination of progressive retinopathy and congenital hearing loss. USH type I is especially devastating
because of its early onset and extreme phenotype of

Hurle et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/23

profound congenital deafness with unintelligible speech,
retinitis pigmentosa within the first decade of life, and vestibular dysfunction. USHIG is one of five USH type 1 causative genes identified to date. Those include the genes
encoding the molecular motor myosin VIIa (MYO7A;
USH1B); two cell adhesion cadherin proteins, cadherin 23
(CDH23; USH1D) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15;
USH1F); and two scaffold proteins, harmonin (harmonin;
USH1C) and USH1G (USH1G; USH1G). These proteins
are involved in a protein network or “interactome” within
sensory cells of the eye and inner ear [54].
Our evolutionary studies of Ush1g in vertebrates
revealed a unique expansion of this gene family to
include three members in all five fish species studied.
A number of zebrafish models of USH have been
described, including mariner (Myo7A, [55]), sputnik
(Cdh23, [56]), and orbiter (Pcdh15a, [57]). Our efforts
have revealed that multiple copies of Myo7A, Cdh23,
Pcdh15, and Ush1g are present in fish genomes (two,
two, two, and three copies, respectively; data not
shown). Interestingly, there is evidence that the “USH
interactome” may be more complex in fish than in other
vertebrates [57]. Specifically, the two Pcdh15 orthologs
in zebrafish have distinct functions in hearing and
vision: Pcdh15a is required for normal auditory and vestibular function, while Pcdh15b is required for normal
photoreceptor outer segment organization and retinal
function. Because Ush1g is a scaffold protein, the presence of three Ush1g genes in fish may affect the fish
“USH interactome” (and consequently eye and inner-ear
development) differently than in humans; such differences should be considered when using fish systems as
general models for vertebrate ear physiology.
Functional studies that shed light on the cis-regulatory
elements and fine genomic architecture of the Ush1gOtop2 locus are needed to establish the mechanisms
underlying the lineage-specific differences in Ush1g
function. For instance, like human USH1g patients, the
Ush1g-defective mouse model Js is profoundly deaf with
vestibular dysfunction; however, unlike human USH1g
patients, it does not have abnormal retinal phenotype
[58]. It is notable that the transcriptional boundaries
between Ush1g and Otop2 are indistinct in rodent genomes due the presence of two rodent-specific Otop2, 5’
untranslated exons that cause Ush1g to overlap with (or
be embedded within) the Otop2 transcriptional unit; the
effect of this configuration on the expression of these
two genes is not known.
CTCF is a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor that
serves an insulator function to limit the spread of heterochromatin; it can also operate as a transcriptional
activator, regulate nuclear localization, and participate in
the control of imprinting [59]. The first intron of Ush1g
contains an extensive number of evolutionarily

Page 13 of 18

conserved sequences and is bracketed by two putative
CTCF-binding sites, CTCF2 and CTCF3. As a caveat,
the predicted CTCF binding sites are based on positional information of sequence reads in chIP-seq studies
and need to be further validated. Nonetheless, we suggest that the HighOc CTCF3 site between Ush1g and
Otop2 may be ubiquitously bound by CTCF in mouse
and human, while CTCF1, CTCF2, and CTCF4 may
participate in gene expression regulation in a cell- and/
or species-specific fashion. Further functional characterization of CTCF1 to CTCF4 will be pivotal for determining whether Ush1g and Otop are functionally insulated
or participate in common developmental pathways.

Conclusions
Distinct evolutionary events have affected the Otop and
Ush1g genes in vertebrate genomes, particularly in
humans and commonly used animal models (specifically,
mouse, fish, and Xenopus). The lineage-specific evolutionary history of these genes may therefore limit the
functional information that can be inferred from animal
studies. In this regard, our findings should help guide
the choice of which animal system to use when investigating Otop and Ush1g function. For example, subfunctionalization of the Otop paralogs in amphibians
may make X. tropicalis an appropriate model for exploring the organization, function, and regulation of Otop
genes and their role in inner ear development in vertebrates; and fish may be an effective vertebrate model for
discriminating the different functions of Ush1g, perhaps
offering the ability to define the unique functions in
inner ear and eye development attributable to each
paralog. We also suggest that humans with chromosome
4p16 rearrangements should be studied for altered
OTOP1 function, which may clarify this gene’s role in
human development.
This study also establishes a framework for defining
whether and how Ush1g and Otop participate in common developmental pathways. Future studies will focus
on functional validation of the highly conserved noncoding sequences that were identified in the Ush1g-Otop
locus, including four putative CTCF-binding sites that
likely play a role in orchestrating gene expression at this
locus.
Methods
Generation of comparative sequence data sets

We assimilated a 25-species comparative sequence data
set for studying the Otop1 and Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 loci
(species are listed in Table 1). For seven species, we
generated the sequence by targeted mapping and
sequencing. Briefly, BAC clones were isolated from the
following libraries (see http://bacpac.chori.org for
details), as described [22,23]: galago (Otolemur garnettii;

Hurle et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/23

CHORI-256), dog (Canis familiaris; RPCI-81), cow (Bos
taurus; CHORI-240), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus;
VMRC-5), hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris; LB-4), frog
(Xenopus tropicalis; CHORI-216), and platypus
(Ornithorhynchus anatinus; CHORI-236). Each library
was screened using pooled sets of oligonucleotide-based
hybridization probes designed from the established
reference sequence of the genomic regions encompassing the mouse Otop1 or Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 loci
(NCBI37, Chr5: 38602000-38894000 and Chr11:
115128000-115293000, respectively). After isolation and
mapping, 25 BACs were selected and subjected to shotgun sequencing and sequence finishing, as previously
described [24]. Ultimately, we generated the orthologous
sequence of the (1) Otop1 locus in galago, dog, armadillo, and platypus; and the (2) Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3
locus in galago, dog, armadillo, cow, hedgehog, and frog
(see Table 2). For each species and locus, a single nonredundant sequence was generated with the individual
BAC sequences (i.e., a multi-BAC sequence assembly)
using the program TPF Processor (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/projects/zoo_seq). The resulting assemblies were
manually verified and submitted to GenBank ([GenBank:
DP000186-DP000190], [GenBank: DP000192], [GenBank: DP000198], and [GenBank: DP000200-DP000202];
Table 2).
For the remaining species, and to capture data not
derived from our targeted sequencing efforts, we
retrieved the orthologous sequences from whole-genome
sequence assemblies available on the UCSC Genome
Browser ([60]; see genome.ucsc.edu). Identifying the
sequences of interest within these assemblies was generally straightforward. One exception involved the detection of a transcribed pseudogene (ΨOTOP1) located in
the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 2
(NCBI human genome sequence build 35,
Chr2:91186050-91237900); this region was not included
in our data set and was identified by BLAST [61] analysis using OTOP1 as a query. Our collective efforts
yielded the sequences of both genomic regions from
nearly all of the 25 vertebrates listed in Table 1. In
addition to the data reported here, 22 additional lowcoverage (~2-fold redundancy) vertebrate whole-genome
sequence assemblies were examined. At the level of
resolution offered by these sequences, no new instances
of lineage-specific evolutionary events affecting the Otop
and Ush1g families were detected (data not shown).
Sequence annotations, alignments, and comparisons

The assembled BAC sequences were annotated for gene
content based on alignments to human RefSeq mRNA
(or species-specific mRNA, if available) sequences using
Spidey (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/spidey) and BLAST
[61]. Known repetitive sequences were detected by

Page 14 of 18

RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) using
appropriate repeat libraries for each species. In addition,
Sequin (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin) was used
to import and confirm all annotations, including verifying splice-site consensus sequences, exon structure, and
predicted protein sequences. Pair-wise and multi-species
sequence comparisons were performed using MultiPipMaker [62], first using the mouse sequence and then
the human sequence as the reference. Multi-species
alignments of nucleotide or deduced protein sequences
were refined with Sequence Alignment Editor (Se-Al,
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk). Sequence Logos for CTCF1
to CTCF4 were based on multi-species sequence alignments in placental mammals, as prepared with
WebLogo v2.8.2 (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/). All data
associated with these analyses are available in GenBank
or in the form of UCSC custom track bed files (see
additional files 1, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11).
The program Miropeats [63] was used to align genome sequence assemblies, to determine the length, location, and relative orientations of the segmental
duplications (see hg17 versus hg19, additional file 5; and
OTOP1-containing region in Chr4 versus ΨOTOP1containing region in Chr2, Figure 4b), and to display
such DNA sequence similarity information graphically.
The order and orientation of mosaic duplicons within
complex duplication blocks was delineated with DupMasker [28] with customized Perl scripts.
Tri-color interphase FISH analyses

Interphase nuclei were prepared from lymphoblast cell
lines from human and three primate outgroup species
as follows: human cell line GM12004 (Coriell Cell Repository, Camden, NJ); chimpanzees Marcus, Cochise,
Douglas, Katie, and Veronica (unknown source; samples
donated by Dr. Mariano Rocchi and Dr. Mario Ventura);
macaque MMU2 (Macaca mulatta; sample donated by
Dr. Mariano Rocchi and Dr. Mario Ventura); and orangutan cell line pr01109 (Susie; Coriell Cell Repository,
Camden, NJ) and individuals PPY9 and PPY6 (unknown
source; samples donated by Dr. Mariano Rocchi and
Dr. Mario Ventura). FISH analyses were performed
using fosmids WIBR2-1849E16, WIBR2-1416B12, and
WIBR2-1634L14, which were labeled by nick-translation
with Cy3-dUTP (Perkin-Elmer), Cy5-dUTP (PerkinElmer), and fluorescein-dUTP (Enzo), respectively, as
generally described by Lichter et al. [25]. Briefly, 300 ng
of labeled probe were used; hybridizations were performed at 37°C in 2XSSC, 50% (v/v) formamide, 10%
(w/v) dextran sulphate, and 3 μg sonicated salmon
sperm DNA in a volume of 10 μl; posthybridization
washing was performed at 60°C in 0.1XSSC (three
times, high stringency); and nuclei were simultaneously
DAPI stained. Digital images were obtained using a

Hurle et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/23

Leica DMRXA2 epifluorescence microscope equipped
with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments).
DAPI, Cy3, Cy5, and fluorescein fluorescence signals
(each detected with specific filters) were recorded separately as gray-scale images. Pseudocoloring and merging
of images were performed using Adobe Photoshop software. A minimum of 50 interphase cells were analyzed
for each hybridization.
Detection of SDs

SDs in genomic regions of interest were identified by
two analytical approaches: assembly-dependent (wholegenome assembly comparison, or WGAC) and assembly-independent (whole-genome shotgun sequence
detection or WSSD) [64]. WGAC is a self-self BLASTbased strategy optimized to provide pair-wise relationships among the SDs within one species. WSSD detects
SDs as sequences with overrepresented depth of coverage in randomly selected sequences from a human and
non-human whole-genome sequence assembly, using
the human sequence assembly as a reference. Inferences
can thus be made about the duplication status in different primates [30]. The duplicon content analysis was
based on the study by Jiang et al. [28], in which the evolutionary history of every duplicon of the human genome was reconstructed with a De-Brujin algorithm
using macaque as an outgroup.
Detection of multi-species conserved sequences

Multi-species conserved sequences (MCSs) were detected
across the 40-kb Ush1g-Otop2-Otop3 locus using ExactPlus ([35]; http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/projects/exactplus/). Briefly, a line-by-line MultiPipMaker alignment was
generated with the high-quality genomic sequence from
galago, dog, armadillo, cow, and hedgehog, along with the
mouse (build 37; Chr11:115168000-115209000) and
human (hg17; Chr17:70408200-70458400) orthologous
sequences from the UCSC Genome Browser. Conservation
parameters (designated as 7-5-4) were set such that ExactPlus would scan the MultiPipMaker alignment (acgt) file
and find blocks of bases (or ‘seeds’) where a minimum of
five species had identical sequences for seven bases; a subsequent base-by-base extension step in either direction
was allowed on condition that each extended base was
identical in a minimum of four species. Detected MCSs
that coincided with UCSC Genome Browser gene annotations, gene predictions, mouse mRNAs, or spliced mouse
ESTs were removed to enrich for non-coding MCSs. Subsequently, we intersected the ExactPlus-detected MCSs
with MCSs represented on the “PhastCons Conserved Elements, 30-way Vertebrate Multiz Alignment” track in the
UCSC Genome Browser (phastConsElement30way; http://
genome.ucsc.edu). This track displays conserved
sequences detected in alignments of 30 vertebrate
sequences using phastCons from the PHAST package

Page 15 of 18

[36]; note that the phastConsElement30way default parameters are tuned to detect the top 5% most-conserved
sequences in the genome. The intersection of the two data
sets revealed 24 shared non-coding MCSs, accounting for
~0.8% of the analyzed sequence. These 24 are considered
the most conserved non-coding MCSs across this ~40-kb
genomic region. Comprehensive listings of the ExactPlusidentified MCSs and their intersection with phastConsElement30way are available in additional file 13.
Phylogenic tree generation

A comprehensive phylogeny of the ODP family in vertebrates and invertebrates has been described elsewhere
[12]. Here, we specifically examined the phylogenetic
relationships between the multiple amphibian Otop
genes with respect to the set of three subfamilies
(Otop1, -2, and -3) typically found in other vertebrates.
In X. tropicalis, the Otop family consists of eight genes,
as determined by a combination of targeted BAC
sequencing and database searches. Specifically, six genes
were identified and annotated in BAC AC166187 (which
was specifically isolated and sequenced for this study),
and two genes were identified and annotated in X. tropicalis scaffold_441 (genome.ucsc.edu; see additional file 1
for Otop1a and Otop1b coordinates in the X. tropicalis
assembly). Thirteen identified X. tropicalis ESTs and a
full-length cDNA were used to verify the Otop gene
annotations ([GenBank: CX926385], Otop1a; [GenBank:
DN050494], non-spliced Otop2a; [GenBank: DN023283],
Otop2b; [GenBank: EL816442], Otop2c; [GenBank:
DN086801, BX774194, EL846279, DN086800 and
CR448138], Otop3b; [GenBank: EL846278, BX774945,
AL858287 and AL886472], Otop3c; and [GenBank:
BC155406], full-length Otop3b). For X. laevis, only a
partial gene complement could be identified by literature and database searches, including one EST ([GenBank: EB479546], Otop3a) and a full-length cDNA, Nlo
[20]; also three partial Nlo ESTs were identified
[GenBank:EB479546, BJ065669 and BJ077411]. A multispecies protein sequence alignment was created that
included all known amphibian, mouse, human, and dog
Otop sequences. Otop proteins contain 12 trans-membrane domains [12]; for these analyses, the entire intracellular domain and four loops (L5, L6, L8, and L10)
were removed from the multi-sequence alignment
because of their highly variable length across phyla. The
resulting alignment was analyzed using RaxML with a
JTT mixed model of amino-acid substitution to generate
the Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree. Of the ten inferences generated from ten distinct randomized maximum
parsimony (MP) starting trees, four of the resulting phylogenetic trees produced a maximum likelihood value of
-8429.55674. The resulting tree was drawn with FigTree
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
