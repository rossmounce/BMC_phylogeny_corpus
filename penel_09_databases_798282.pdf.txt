Abstract
Background: Comparative genomics is a central step in many sequence analysis studies, from
gene annotation and the identification of new functional regions in genomes, to the study of
evolutionary processes at the molecular level (speciation, single gene or whole genome
duplications, etc.) and phylogenetics. In that context, databases providing users high quality
homologous families and sequence alignments as well as phylogenetic trees based on state of the
art algorithms are becoming indispensable.
Methods: We developed an automated procedure allowing massive all-against-all similarity
searches, gene clustering, multiple alignments computation, and phylogenetic trees construction
and reconciliation. The application of this procedure to a very large set of sequences is possible
through parallel computing on a large computer cluster.
Results: Three databases were developed using this procedure: HOVERGEN, HOGENOM and
HOMOLENS. These databases share the same architecture but differ in their content.
HOVERGEN contains sequences from vertebrates, HOGENOM is mainly devoted to completely
sequenced microbial organisms, and HOMOLENS is devoted to metazoan genomes from Ensembl.
Access to the databases is provided through Web query forms, a general retrieval system and a
client-server graphical interface. The later can be used to perform tree-pattern based searches
allowing, among other uses, to retrieve sets of orthologous genes. The three databases, as well as
the software required to build and query them, can be used or downloaded from the PBIL (Pôle
Bioinformatique Lyonnais) site at http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/.

Background
HOVERGEN, a database devoted to homologous gene
families in vertebrates [1,2] has been first released in
1994. The motivation to develop this database was to
build a system allowing to do large-scale comparative
genomic studies on vertebrates. HOVERGEN allows to
retrieve sets of orthologous genes in order to do evolutionary studies on gene families [3-12].
Two other systems based on the same architecture: HOGENOM and HOMOLENS are presented here. HOGENOM
contains homologous gene families from all available
complete genomes from bacteria, archaea and unicellular
eukaryotes, plus some representative plants and animals.
HOMOLENS contains gene families from complete animal genomes found in Ensembl [13]. In the three databases, after family assembly, protein sequences are
aligned and the alignments produced are used to build
phylogenetic trees. Those two steps are realized through
an automated procedure.
These databases are structured under the ACNUC
sequence database management system [14]. Access to
these databases is possible through different implementations of the ACNUC libraries. The first one is the Web
server available at PBIL [15]. The second one is the program Query, a retrieval system allowing to query local or
remote ACNUC databases [16]. Lastly, a graphical interface named FamFetch allows to retrieve families and display associated data [17,18]. This program allows to
perform pattern searches on the phylogenetic trees
through a pattern-matching algorithm. This feature is
especially helpful to retrieve sets of orthologous
sequences, but also for any kind of studies involving the
detection of phylogenetic profiles.

Materials and methods
Data harvesting and pre-processing
For the three systems, two ACNUC databases are built,
one for the protein sequences and one for the corresponding nucleotide sequences. Protein sequences are stored in
UniProtKB format [19] while nucleotide sequences are
stored in EMBL format [20]. To build those databases, the
sequences are gathered from different sources. In the case
of HOVERGEN, protein sequences represent the primary
source of information, and they are taken from UniProt.
Nucleotide sequences are taken from EMBL, using the
cross-references provided in UniProt. For HOMOLENS,
nucleotide annotated sequences come from Ensembl and
protein sequences are generated from the corresponding
Coding DNA Sequences (CDS) described in Ensembl
annotations. In the case of HOGENOM, data sources are
represented by various nucleotide sequence collections
that are used in a hierarchical manner. Sequences from
Genome Reviews [21] are used first and then supple-

mented with various systems such as Ensembl, the NCBI
microbial data repository and complete genomes collection, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) complete genome data, sequences from the Joint Genome
Institute (JGI), the Sanger Institute and the John Craig
Venter Institute (JCVI). The CDS from these collections
are translated, using the adequate genetic code and reading frame, to generate the corresponding protein
sequences except when alternative splicing occurs. In this
case only the longest CDS is translated. Annotations of the
CDS are analysed to get information related to protein
annotations. When cross-references to UniProt are found,
UniProt entries are scanned to get information on function, product and bibliography to improve the annotations. The UniProt identifier is inserted into the
annotations as a keyword and the UniProt accession
number is inserted as a secondary accession number.
Inconsistencies or lack of precision in the taxonomic
information present in some source databases are corrected, mostly in HOGENOM. In HOVERGEN, UniProt
and EMBL sequence names and accession numbers are
used. In HOGENOM and HOMOLENS, devoted to complete genomes, entries are renamed to directly provide
information about the species identity and the location of
genes in chromosomes. For nucleotide sequences, the first
two letters of the genus, the first three letters of the species,
a number identifying the strain, and another identifying
the replicon, the chromosome, or the organelle make up
sequence names. For each individual CDS, a suffix containing the two letters "PE" (for peptide) followed by its
rank number in the replicon is added to the containing
sequence's name. For example, ESCOL2_1.PE76 and
ESCOL2_2.PE3371 correspond respectively to the
sequence of the traL gene on plasmid F and the sequence
of the glgX gene on the chromosome of Escherichia coli
K12. For protein sequences, the same naming is
employed, except that the CDS rank number is integrated
in the sequence name (e.g., ESCOL2_1_PE76 for the
above mentioned traL gene). Note that original accession
numbers are conserved and added to sequence annotations so that the coherence with original data source is
conserved.
Clustering algorithm
To build families, a similarity search of all proteins against
themselves, after filtering low complexity regions with
SEG [22], is performed with the BLASTP2 program [23],
the BLOSUM62 amino-acid similarity matrix [24], and a
threshold of 10-4 for BLAST E-values. The Build_Fam program is used to cluster protein sequences into families.
This program filters BLAST output in order to remove
Homologous Segment Pairs (HSPs) that are incompatible
with a global alignment (Figure 1). For complete protein
sequences, two sequences in a pair are included in the

oped for our three databases. Some supplementary features corresponding to descriptions of non-coding regions
are also introduced in the nucleotide sequences:
"INT_INT" for internals introns (i.e., within CDS),
"5'NCR" for 5' non-coding regions, and "3'NCR" for 3'
non-coding regions (i.e., regions respectively upstream
and downstream of annotated CDS, including UTRs and
intergenic regions). Those supplementary features define
what we call sub-sequences [14] which can be selected
and extracted from the databases in the same way as CDS
or structural RNAs.

Removal of incompatible HSPs
Removal of incompatible HSPs. For each couple of
homologous sequences found by BLASTP, HSPs that are
incompatible with a global alignment are removed. In this
example, segments S1 and S2 are compatible, but segments
S3 and S4 are not. They are therefore ignored by further
computations on similarity measures which allow one to classify (or not) these two sequences in the same family.

same family if remaining HSPs cover at least 80% of the
protein length and if their similarity is over 50% (two
amino-acids are considered similar if their BLOSUM62
similarity score is positive). This couple of parameters will
be denoted by 50/80 below.
Build_Fam uses a simple transitive link to build families.
It means that if the pair of sequences {A, B} matches the
conditions to be integrated in the same family and if the
pair {A, C} also matches them, then sequences A, B and C
will be clustered together, even if the pair {B, C} does not
match the conditions. Once families of complete protein
sequences are built, partial sequences are included in the
classification. A partial sequence having similarity with a
complete protein is included in a family if it fulfils the two
conditions required for a complete sequence and if its
length is ≥100 amino-acids or ≥50% of the length of the
complete protein. When several families can be associated
with a partial sequence, the sequence is included in the
family that presents the complete sequence with the highest similarity.
Extensions of sequence annotations
Further sequence annotations are created after the clustering step. For protein sequences, a family identifier is
added in the "CC" field. In the case of nucleotide
sequences, this information is added in a "/gene_family"
qualifier associated to each CDS. In both cases, this identifier is incorporated in the keywords associated to the corresponding entries in the ACNUC structure. It is thus
possible to retrieve all the sequences in a family with this
number when using any of the retrieval systems devel-

Alignments and phylogenetic trees
Once the families are built, multiple alignments are computed on protein sequences using MUSCLE [25] with all
default parameters. Alignments are filtered with Gblocks
[26] in order to keep only their reliable parts. Based on
our experience, Gblocks is used with parameters corresponding to relaxed conditions, in agreement with Talavera and Castresana [27]. Phylogenetic trees are computed
with the fast maximum-likelihood algorithm implemented in PhyML [28], the JTT amino acid substitution
model [29], and across-site rate variation modelled by a
gamma distribution with four rate classes. Estimation of
the α parameter for gamma distributions is carried out by
PhyML. Internal branch support is estimated using the
approximate Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT) available in
PhyML [30]. Due to the amount of time and memory
required by computations on large families, alignments
and tree computations were limited to families up to
1,000 sequences in HOVERGEN and up to 2,000
sequences in HOGENOM and HOMOLENS.
Tree reconciliation
All individual phylogenetic trees are reconciled with a species tree using the program RAP [18]. The reconciliation
consists in the comparison of a gene tree with a species
tree. When inconsistencies are detected between the two,
they are explained by the presence of duplication events
followed by selective losses in different lineages (Figure
2). The reference species tree used is the one provided by
the
NCBI
taxonomic
database
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=taxonomy. During this process, some annotations are added to the reconciled trees. Those annotations consist in taxonomic data
(i.e., species names) and cross-references to the CDS corresponding to the protein sequences used to build the
trees. Trees are rooted using the same reconciliation procedure. The root is placed to maximize the similarity
between the gene tree and the species tree. All possible
positions of the root in the gene tree are explored, and the
one that requires the minimal number of gene duplications is retained. Tree reconciliation is used for HOVERGEN and HOMOLENS but not for HOGENOM because
RAP does not model Horizontal Gene Transfers (HGTs),

which are thought to be an important source of phylogenetic inconsistencies in prokaryotes [31-33].
Evaluation of clustering criteria
The efficiency and reliability of our clustering algorithm
was assessed through a comparison with alternative
approaches. We selected all the 219,951 protein
sequences from 50 complete genomes including a panel
of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic species in HOGENOM. For Build_Fam, three similarity/length-percentage combinations were experimented: the abovementioned 50/80 and also the 40/80 and 40/90 combinations. We also applied the OrthoMCL and TribeMCL clustering programs on the same dataset. OrthoMCL is used to
build the OrthoMCL-DB database [34]. This approach
attempts to use evolutionary concepts such as orthology
(i.e., divergence after speciation events) and paralogy (i.e.,
divergence after duplication events) to enforce a lower
weight to paralogous relationships during the MCL clustering procedure [35]. This algorithm uses an inflation
parameter (I) which regulates the cluster tightness. The
default value for OrthoMCL is I = 1.5, but we also examined its behaviour with I = 1.1 and 4.0. TribeMCL is the
algorithm used to build Tribes [36], and it is based on a
similarity criterion provided by the user. Two different
similarity criteria for TribeMCL were used: i) the simple
BLAST E-value; and ii) our own score, Tribe(HSP), defined
as:

Tribe(HSPxy ) =

∑

all HSP

(

s HSPxy

(

)

max s xx − s yy

where x and y are two homologous protein sequences,
s(HSPxy) is the BLAST bit score for an HSP in an ordered
list of HSPs found between x and y, and szz is the BLAST bit
score between sequence z and itself. The value given to the
inflation parameter for MCL in this case was the default
one (I = 2).
The desired properties of a clustering algorithm for phylogenetic database reconstruction are twofold: first, the
algorithm should be able to cluster homologous
sequences from divergent organisms; second, the resulting alignments should nevertheless remain of high quality. After clustering, families based on each algorithm
were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters. To
estimate the quality of alignments, six subsets of families
were considered for each clustering algorithm: three containing all families with 10, 25 and 50 sequences, and
three containing all families of 10, 25 and 50 species. The
quality of alignments was assessed using two approaches:
the NorMD index [37] which computes a similarity score
over the entire alignment based on amino acid similarity
(measured with PAM250 in this study); and Gblocks filtering [26] which we used as a measure of the number of
gaps introduced in the alignment. When NorMD ≥ 0.5,
the alignment is considered to be of good quality [37]. For
Gblocks, the higher the percentage of sites conserved after
filtering, the better the alignment. We used the default
parameters for Gblocks (all gaps are removed), and we
considered empirically that the alignments were of good
quality if the percentage of conserved sites was ≥50%.

Databases access
As of October 2008, HOGENOM and HOMOLENS gather
the information of complete genomes from respectively
513 and 41 species, while HOVERGEN contains 415,383
vertebrate proteins, and these three databases are regularly
updated. They all provide high quality alignments and
phylogenetic trees that can be queried and downloaded
using a wide variety of tools, allowing to perform from
very simple text searches to complex queries. Contents in
terms of sequences and families for the present releases of
the three databases are given in Table 1.
Web services
Sequences and families can be selected and retrieved via
the PBIL server http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/. This server provides convenient and flexible web forms for selecting
sequences and families by many different criteria in several databases [38], including the general repository collections such as Ensembl, UniProt, GenBank [39] or
EMBL. The core of the service is represented by the WWWQuery application [15]. The corresponding form allows
the combination of up to four criteria to retrieve
sequences or gene families. Among the allowed criteria
are: sequence names, accession numbers, keywords, taxonomic data, organelle, molecule type (CDS, RNA, or the
supplementary features described in the Extensions to
sequence annotations section), bibliographical references, date of insertion in the repository collections. Each
time a query is performed, the list of matching sequences
is stored on the server, and it is possible to re-use previously created lists to refine queries. The Quick Search form
represents a simpler version of this application. With this
form, the user enters only a string corresponding to a
sequence name, an accession number, a keyword or a species name, and all the sequences or families associated to
a criterion matching the string will be sorted. Note that
the use of wildcard for fuzzy searches is allowed with both
WWW-Query and Quick Search.

The Cross Taxa application gives access to a family
retrieval system based on taxonomic criteria. It allows to
retrieve gene families that are shared by a first set of taxa
and (optionally) that are not present in a second set of
taxa. Any taxonomic level can be used and mixed to com-

pose the query (e.g., Homo sapiens, Mammalia, Metazoa).
For example it is possible to retrieve all gene families specific to a toxic bacterial strain, all gene families present in
human but not in rodents, or all metazoan-specific gene
families.
Alignments can be displayed on static HTML pages with
several colouring options and they can be edited in order
to visualize only a subset of sequences (Figure 3). Alternatively they can be visualised with the JalView applet [40]
or downloaded on local disk. Phylogenetic trees are displayed as a clickable Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
picture generated with Perl modules [41] and coloured
according to taxonomy. Several displaying options are
available, allowing to visualize species names, sequence
name. Alternatively, trees can be visualised with the ATV
applet [42] or downloaded.
Standard BLAST similarity searches can be performed on
the three databases, but it is also possible to use a specific
tool named HoSeqI [43]. With HoSeqI, instead of simply
identifying the sequences in a database that are the most
similar to a query sequence, the application identifies the
most similar family. Then the query sequence is integrated
into this family and the corresponding alignment and tree
are recomputed on the fly. For that purpose, a panel of different multiple alignment and tree building programs is
proposed to the user. Especially, it is possible to use profile alignments algorithms instead of performing de novo
complete alignments. Therefore, the complete identification process can be very fast. Again, alignments and trees
can be visualized on static HTML pages or through the use
of JalView and ATV applets.
Lastly, note that HOVERGEN and HOGENOM families
and phylogenetic trees can be directly accessed from the
UniProt Web site http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot,
through cross-references of the "Phylogenomic databases"
field.
ACNUC remote connection
The ACNUC database system handles any sequence collection structured with the GenBank, EMBL or UniProt
flat file formats. Recently, network access to ACNUC data-

bases has been achieved by the definition and implementation of a remote ACNUC access protocol that governs
information exchanges between the PBIL and remote clients [16]. This protocol uses a TCP/IP socket connection
to a dedicated server and makes retrieval operations to
remote ACNUC databases nearly as fast as to local databases with usual academic Internet connections.
HOVERGEN, HOGENOM and HOMOLENS can be
accessed with two client programs: Query_win with a
graphical user interface, and raa_query with a commandline interface. The latter is useful in a scripting context,
possibly to repeatedly execute fixed retrieval operations.
Both of them allow to compose complex queries involving multiple criteria, extraction of sequences and subsequences into local files, and access to keywords and taxonomic data browsers. Query_win executables are available for major computing platforms, therefore most
Internet-connected computers can run an ACNUC client
and access the PBIL databases.

The remote ACNUC access protocol has also been interfaced with two programming languages, C and Python,
and the widely used statistical computing environment R
[44]. Therefore, it is possible for users to write their own
programs in any of these languages in order to access
ACNUC databases. Furthermore, the R binding is
included into an official R package called seqInR [45].
This package provides various tools for statistical and evolutionary analyses of biological sequences and access to
the very large set of libraries available in the R environment.
FamFetch interface
FamFetch is a Java client allowing to access sequence data,
as well as the alignments and trees present in HOVERGEN, HOGENOM and HOMOLENS [17]. Starting from
the main window of the interface it is possible to access
the whole list or a personal subset of families and to make
queries to retrieve those matching specific criteria (Figure
4). An equivalent of the Cross Taxa application is also
implemented. After selection of a family, the correspond-

Three different frames of the FamFetch interface
Three different frames of the FamFetch interface. Frame (a) is an interactive editor that allows users to build any pattern, node by node and leaf by leaf. Here the pattern entered allows to detect families in which an eukaryotic species is placed
within a clade of bacterial species. Frame (b) allows to choose between tools to use in the editor. Tools surrounded by dark
grey are those that use the gene duplication predictions, and can be avoided if the user does not want to trust this information.
Frame (c) is the tree display. In this frame, sequence are displayed using a colour code corresponding to the taxonomy.
ing phylogenetic tree is displayed in the tree window. In
this tree, sequences are coloured using a code reflecting
the taxonomic position of the corresponding species. A
choice of four different editable colouring schemes is proposed to the user. The tree display is active, with options
of re-rooting, node swapping, subtree selection or zooming. Clicking on leaves allows users to visualize the entries
from UniProt and EMBL or the alignment of the selected
sequences.
A major feature of FamFetch is the possibility to retrieve
families showing specific tree patterns [18]. The interface
integrates a tree pattern editor allowing to define a pattern
that will be searched in the set of phylogenetic trees. After
the pattern matching operation, the main frame of FamFetch displays the list of matching families. The results can
be saved in a file, each pattern being numbered and
described with its gene list. Thanks to the possibility to
introduce duplications and/or taxonomic data constraints
in search patterns, it is possible to easily detect ancient
gene duplications or to select orthologous genes. For that
purpose, the user only needs to build a pattern in which
duplications are forbidden. The whole tree pattern search
operation really makes sense with the tree reconciliation
performed with RAP. Indeed, with reconciled trees, even
hidden paralogies due to duplications followed by gene
losses in some lineages are taken into account in the pattern search process.

The use of the tree pattern matching algorithm to retrieve
sets of orthologous genes has been previously described
[18]. The approach to orthology inference implemented
by the RAP tree pattern matching algorithm is very different from that used by most other systems such as COGs
[46], OrthoMCL-DB [47] or Inparanoid [48], and is the
only one based on phylogenetic analysis. But this tool can
be also used for other purposes, and in the case of HOGENOM, it is possible to search for genes that may have
been obtained by HGT in some species. HGTs are known
to be an important driving force in prokaryotes evolution
[31-33], and the question of their detection has raised a
lot of methodological problems [49-51]. It is generally
admitted that the phylogenetic methods (i.e., the methods based on the use of phylogenetic trees) are the most
efficient ones to identify HGTs [50-52]. In order to detect
transfers with a database like HOGENOM, the simplest
thing to do is to search for anomalous patterns in trees, for
instance patterns that are violating the monophyly of a
well-established group of species.
A possible example of search of this kind is summarized
in Figures 4 and 5. In this search, the pattern entered
allows to detect families in which an eukaryotic species is
placed within a clade of bacterial species (Figure 4). When
performed on the release 4 of HOGENOM (February
2008), this search returns 1,304 trees, two of which are
shown in Figure 5. Many of these patterns represent prob-

Exemple of trees containing anomalous patterns involving eukaryotes and bacteria. A search on the pattern
shown in Figure 4 has been performed on HOGENOM release 4, and this search returned a total of 1,304 families. Two trees
taken among the 1,304 are shown in this figure. Family HBG082165 (a) corresponds to a conserved hypothetical protein, and
it shows a S. cerevisiae sequence among Lactobacillales species. Family HBG459980 (b) corresponds to the 3-phosphoshikimate
1-carboxyvinyltransferase enzyme, and it shows a G. gallus sequence among Proteobacteria species. Values of the aLRT test are
given for the internal branches, and only values with a P > 80% are shown.

able contaminations rather than real HGTs, an example of
this being the presence of Gallus gallus among Proteobacteria sequences in HBG459980 family. More plausible is
the case of family HBG082165 that shows a possible HGT
of a gene encoding an hypothetical protein from a Lactobacillales species to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The parameters used for the algorithms correspond to the similarity/length combination in the case of Build_Fam, to the inflation parameter in the
case of OrthoMCL, and to the two scores used in the case of TribeMCL. The three last lines give the number and percentage of families containing
only one species (sp. = 1), 50 different species (sp. = 50), and at least 25 different species (sp. ≥ 25).

EMBL and UniProt format, alignments in Clustal format
[53], and trees in Newick format [54] are provided. The
seqInR package is available from any Comprehensive R
Archive Network (CRAN) mirror. All data used to estimate
the reliability of Build_Fam and its comparison with other
clustering algorithms can be downloaded at ftp://

Results and discussion
Tree reconciliation
The main originality of our system is the possibility to
make queries using tree patterns, as this allows users not
only to search for orthologs but also for HGTs, gene duplications or any phylogenetic profile of interest. Also, it is
possible to perform tree pattern searches on reconciled or
non-reconciled databases, the only difference being that
duplications need to be described explicitly by the user in
a non-reconciled database.
Clustering algorithm
The comparison of clustering methods revealed that different approaches have different desirable properties. An
ideal algorithm for building phylogenetic tree databases
would be fast, producing high quality alignments while
maximizing species representation in protein families. In
terms of speed, Build_Fam indisputably outperformed
both TribeMCL and OrthoMCL (respectively less than an
hour, 3 hours and 41 hours to cluster 219,951 sequences
on a Sun Fire 880, UltraSparc-III, 8 × 900 MHz CPUs, 28
Gbytes RAM). In the clustering procedure, OrthoMCL and

TribeMCL always cluster a significantly larger fraction of
sequences than Build_Fam with respectively 77–78% and
72–85% against 54–58%, depending on the parameters
used for each program (Table 2). As expected, when the
Build_Fam similarity threshold is made less stringent, the
number of families generated decreases while the average
number of sequences per family increases. This average
number of sequences per family is usually low because
many families have a small number of sequences. An
important difference is the fact that Build_Fam and
TribeMCL have a tendency to generate a small number of
very large families (containing >1,000 sequences), in contrast with OrthoMCL. Overall the clustering criteria
appear more stringent in Build_Fam, and therefore the
proportion of families that include representatives from
more than one kingdom is lower (Table 3). Furthermore
when the number of species represented in a family
grows, Build_Fam tends to have more sequences per species, and thus to have more redundancy than OrthoMCL
(excepted for I = 1.1). The tendency of reducing redundancy in families is a build-in characteristic of the
OrthoMCL algorithm and is therefore not surprising. It
may not, however, be a desirable property for the present
databases.
Although it detected less universal families, Build_Fam
almost consistently produced better alignments than
other methods, either for the NorMD index or the number
of gaps as detected by Gblocks (Table 4). When the
number of sequences or species is low, Build_Fam 50/80

generates alignments that are much better than those
obtained with OrthoMCL or TribeMCL. On the other
hand, for large and very large families, the quality of the
alignments considerably decreases. Considering the largest family generated by Build_Fam 50/80 (1,580
sequences) it happens that it is split by OrthoMCL 1.5
into 104 different families (corresponding to 92% of the
total of sequences). The alignments of those 104 families
are good as their average NorMD index is >0.5 for 96 families and their average site selection by Gblocks is >60%.
There is therefore a tendency of Build_Fam to integrate
divergent sequences on very large families.
On average, the better alignments obtained with
Build_Fam for families up to 50 sequences or species can
be explained by the double constraint put on the similarity and length of the pair of proteins. This increase in quality is partly counter-balanced by the use of a simple
transitive link to incorporate sequences in a family. The
use of a complete link would probably ensure an even better alignment quality, but at the cost of many families
split. As this phenomenon of families splitting is already
important with Build_Fam in its present state, it is probably not worth considering this model of sequence integration for the moment. Remarkably, the 50/80 parameter
combination – which was chosen empirically for the first
HOBACGEN release [17] – gives better results than the
other combinations tested (40/80 and 40/90). This
parameter choice thus appears as a good compromise
between family size (and therefore family exhaustivity)
and alignment quality. As the quality of a phylogenetic
tree is the direct consequence of the quality of the corresponding sequence alignment, it is of special importance
to have good alignments in our databases. In that context,
the lower exhaustivity – materialized by the fact that
Build_Fam tends to include only sequences from one
kingdom in a family – is acceptable.
Parallel computing
The sizeable computational volume required by the construction of HOGENOM, HOVERGEN and HOMOLENS
has been performed using the computing facilities of the
Institut National de Physique Nucléaire et de Physique
des Particules (IN2P3). This computing centre provides
access to a 2,300 CPU cluster that can efficiently parallelize tasks such as BLAST searches or the construction of
thousands of alignments and trees. The use of parallel
computing brought a major improvement since computation time has been reduced by a factor of 50 to 100.

able taxa. One important difficulty is that this would considerably increase the size of many gene families, and
hence this would make the phylogenetic trees much more
difficult to browse and interpret. Moreover, the global
quality of the trees themselves would be drastically lowered because of the difficulty to compute reliable multiple
alignments with very large families. Given that users are
generally interested only in a particular clade, we decided
to maintain three different databases (HOVERGEN,
HOGENOM and HOMOLENS), whose content is partly
overlapping, but that focus on different clades and different kinds of data (complete genome sequences vs. all data
available for one clade). Also, we plan to develop a strategy including an incremental all-against-all BLAST search
performed on a whole general protein sequence repository collection (such as UniProt). We will provide procedures allowing users to: i) extract a subset from the
exhaustive set of protein similarities detected; ii) use this
subset to create a specific database. Moreover, we wish to
develop tools that would allow the user to automatically
edit phylogenetic trees to display only a subset of
sequences representative of the taxa of interest.
