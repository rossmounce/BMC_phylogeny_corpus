Abstract
Background: Here we provide the most comprehensive study to date on the cranial ossification sequence in
Lipotyphla, the group which includes shrews, moles and hedgehogs. This unique group, which encapsulates
diverse ecological modes, such as terrestrial, subterranean, and aquatic lifestyles, is used to examine the
evolutionary lability of cranial osteogenesis and to investigate the modularity of development.
Results: An acceleration of developmental timing of the vomeronasal complex has occurred in the common
ancestor of moles. However, ossification of the nasal bone has shifted late in the more terrestrial shrew mole.
Among the lipotyphlans, sequence heterochrony shows no significant association with modules derived from
developmental origins (that is, neural crest cells vs. mesoderm derived parts) or with those derived from
ossification modes (that is, dermal vs. endochondral ossification).
Conclusions: The drastic acceleration of vomeronasal development in moles is most likely coupled with the
increased importance of the rostrum for digging and its use as a specialized tactile surface, both fossorial
adaptations. The late development of the nasal in shrew moles, a condition also displayed by hedgehogs and
shrews, is suggested to be the result of an ecological reversal to terrestrial lifestyle and reduced functional
importance of the rostrum. As an overall pattern in lipotyphlans, our results reject the hypothesis that ossification
sequence heterochrony occurs in modular fashion when considering the developmental patterns of the skull. We
suggest that shifts in the cranial ossification sequence are not evolutionarily constrained by developmental origins
or mode of ossification.

Background
The mammalian skull is one of the most extensively studied anatomical systems among vertebrate structures.
One of the major aspects of morphological evolution in
the mammalian skull is heterochrony, shifts in the timing
and rate of development. The more classic heterochronic
studies have focused on quantifying changes in size and
shape, whereas the study of ‘sequence’ heterochrony
incorporates changes in the timing of discrete developmental events with many advantages in comparative studies [1-4]. One set of events that has received much
attention in recent years is the onset of ossification of

individual bones [[5] and references therein]. SánchezVillagra et al. [6], presenting the most comprehensive
study of sequence heterochrony in the mammalian skull
to date, analyzed the ossification sequence of 17 bone
elements of the skull among 7 marsupial and 13 species
of boreoeutherians (the placental mammals, excluding
afrotherians and xenarthrans [7]). A few heterochronies
were found to diagnose mammals, marsupials or placentals, but the relative timing of cranial ossification patterns
is largely conserved among mammal evolution. Although
similarly conserved developmental patterns have been
reported for Rodentia [8], further investigation of unexamined species and more phylogenetically inclusive studies are needed to test whether this conservatism is a
general pattern of mammals.

Recently, the connection of heterochrony to modularity, another central aspect in the evolution of development, has attracted much attention in vertebrates in
general [for example, [9-16]]. Modularity, which is considered to be one of the key concepts to bridge evolutionary biology and developmental biology [17-21], refers to
the autonomy of groups of events or structures, as well
as the strong associations of developmental events or
morphological structures [22]. Independence among anatomical structures is thought to permit unrelated parts to
vary and/or evolve separately, while the integration
within smaller units maintains functionally necessary
relationships among traits [23]. From studies on the
genetic, developmental and functional modules across
vertebrates, it has been implied that developmental modularity may provide insights into processes of morphological evolution [24-34]. Most studies have focused on the
physical relationships among functionally- or developmentally-related structures, and there are only a few studies relating developmental timing to the concept of
modularity [9-11,35].
Heterochrony is only considered possible in a modular
phenotype, in which some parts are autonomous developmentally from others [10,15,36-38]. It has been suggested that heterochronic change in ossification events of
the tetrapod skull occurs among different developmental
modules, while maintaining the relative timing of developmental events in each module [11]. Schoch [11] suggested that sets of cranial bones belonging to the same
developmental modules could shift ossification timing in
unison, although this proposition was not statistically
tested. Using the analytical method developed by Poe
[39], a study on several therian mammals found that
postcranial modules show significant developmental integration of the entire appendicular skeleton in boreoeutherian placentals [10]. However, cranial phenotypic
variational modules showed no significant conservation
of developmental timing for all sister group comparisons,
except within a clade consisting of a mole and a shrew,
which displayed integrated shifts of ossification sequence
in the facial module [10]. While ossification timing of
some skeletal parts was implied to reflect evolutionary
modularity in some taxa, it remains unclear whether, and
to what degree, heterochrony involves modularity.
Although the onset of the ossification sequence of cranial
parts in the facial module was indicated to shift together
within the mole-shrew clade (Talpa europaea and Cryptotis parva), a detailed and more inclusive study of the
diverse group to which these animals belong is needed to
strictly test the hypothesis relating sequence heterochrony to modularity. In addition, although a significant
relationship between cranial heterochrony and modularity was not found in most taxa examined [10], it is still
possible that shifts in the cranial ossification sequence of

Page 2 of 18

some taxa are less constrained by developmental modularity, whereas those of other taxa may be strongly
constrained by modular pattern. Furthermore, because
only the relationship between patterns of sequence heterochrony and modularity of phenotypic variation was
compared by Goswami [10], it is yet unclear whether
developmental modularity of sequence heterochrony is
associated with modules derived from developmental origins (that is, neural crest cells vs. mesoderm derived
parts) and/or with those derived from developmental
modes (that is, dermal vs. endochondral ossification).
The body parts that share developmental origins and
functions are suggested to behave as evolutionary modules at various levels [23,26,40]. Therefore, we hypothesize that sequence heterochrony is more likely to occur
among different developmental modules, while maintaining the relative timing of developmental events within a
single module.
Here we provide the most comprehensive study to
date on the ossification sequence of cranial elements in
Lipotyphla, the group which includes shrews (Soricidae),
moles and ‘shrew moles’ (Talpidae), hedgehogs (Erinaceidae), and Solenodons (Solenodontidae) [41]. With an
extensive series of embryonic specimens from a variety
of taxa, we present data on cranial ossification
sequences for two species of terrestrial hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus and E. amurensis), three species of
subterranean mole (Mogera wogura, Condylura cristata,
and Scapanus orarius), one terrestrial shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides), one terrestrial shrew (Suncus murinus), and an aquatic water shrew (Chimarrogale
platycephala). In addition, the resolution of sequence
data for two moles (Talpa europaea and T. occidentalis)
and one shrew species (Cryptotis parva) is much
improved compared with the data presented in previous
literature [6,42,43]. Using this unique group that encapsulates terrestrial, subterranean and aquatic lifestyles, we
examine the evolutionary lability and conservatism of
cranial osteogenesis and test the hypothesis that skeletal
elements belonging to the same module display coordinated shifts of ossification timing while maintaining the
relative sequence within the module.

Materials and methods
Data acquisition

Ossification sequence data of 22 cranial elements in 11
lipotyphlan species were sampled from 238 embryonic
specimens held in the collections at the Paleontological
Institute and Museum of University of Zürich, Kyoto
University Museum, Botanical Gardens Museum of Hokkaido University, Aichigakuin University Dental Science
Museum, and Wildlife Laboratory at Tokyo University of
Agriculture (Figure 1, Table 1). The jugal and ethmoid
were excluded from the analysis because these bones

for three boreoeutherian outgroup species, including the
greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis), the common

Figure 2 is a composite consensus phylogenetic tree of
the studied species based on molecular and morphological analyses [47-52].
We employed an enzymatic clearing and staining
method and a high-resolution tomography (μCT) technique for detecting ossification. Some specimens were
cleared and stained by a modified method of a standard
enzymatic procedure [43], and the earliest appearance of
ossifications was recorded based on uptake of alizarin
red (Figure 3) [6]. As other species were historical
museum specimens, the appearance of bones was also
assessed noninvasively by acquiring shadow images
taken by μCT at the University Museum, University of
Tokyo (TXS225-ACTIS, TESCO, Tokyo) and at the
Anthropological Institute, University of Zurich (μCT80,
Scano Medical, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Three dimensional visualization and analysis of shadow images were
conducted in Avizo 6.1 (Visualization Sciences Group,
Burlington, MA, USA) (Figure 4). Since using different
visualization techniques to obtain ossification sequence
is reported not to represent a confounding issue and
that differences in detection thresholds do not yield
erroneous sequences [53,54], we consider minimum

error will be involved with employing both clear staining
and μCT methods.
Analysis of variation in ossification sequence

To examine the rank variation in sequence of a particular ossification event, we scaled the rank of each ossification event as:
(r − 1) / (rmax − 1)

in which r is the absolute rank of a given ossification
event, and rmax is the total number of ranks for each species. Therefore, the relative ranks of each species are distributed between 0 and 1. This allowed us to remove the
differences of maximum rank between species resulting

from differing levels of sampling resolution between species. A similar approach as standardizing the absolute
rank r by the maximum number of ranks (rmax) has been
applied in previous sequence heterochrony studies [for
example, [6,8,53]]. As the ranks are distributed between
1/rmax and 1 with this method, the relative ranks of the
earliest bone to ossify can vary, depending on rmax. However, the method used here circumvents this problem
because the relative ranks of the earliest event will always
be scaled to zero. Nevertheless, some noise remains
because species with higher rmax have a lower influence
on the variance [53]. The range in rank variation across
species was assessed to examine the variability of a particular element in the ossification sequence. The frequency
distribution of ranks was also calculated to examine the

distribution of ossification events within the rank
sequence. In order to assess the variability of ossification
timing between modules, rank variation between
hypothetical modules was also compared.

Event pairing and PARSIMOV analysis

To identify heterochronies within the ossification
sequence, the timing of each ossification event of 22
bones was compared with every other ossification event,

that is, the ossification rank of one bone was compared
with that of another bone within the species (Table 2).
This resulted in 231 event pairs for each species, which
were treated as ‘characters’ [55]. Three character states,
before (score 0), simultaneous (score 1), or after (score

2), were given respectively to reflect the relative timing
of one ossification event relative to another. For example, if the premaxilla is earlier than the nasal in a certain
species, then this event pair is scored as 0. In this way,
differences in sequence resolution can be overcome and

Data for three boreoeutherian outgroup species, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis), the common treeshrew (Tupaia glis), and the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) were compiled from the literature [44-46].
Simultaneous events are usually the result of low resolution of sampling, since the onset of ossification of two bones is unlikely to occur exactly at the same time. Therefore, the resolutions for oral bones in Co.
cristata, Sc. Orarius, U. talpoides, and T. europaea are limited in this study.

Page 7 of 18

Koyabu et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:21

event pairs can be compared among species. Simultaneous events are usually the result of low resolution of
sampling, because the onset of ossification of two bones
is unlikely to occur exactly at the same time [6,56].
After constructing event pairs, the character state at
each node of the phylogeny can be inferred by a parsimonious approach (but see [57]). Parsimov [55] was
employed to map event pairs onto the given phylogeny
(Figure 2) and to analyze the evolutionary change of
developmental timing. Outgroup species (M. myotis,
T. glis, and R. norvegicus) were used to polarize the
characters. This parsimony-based phylogenetic method
investigates all possible sets of event timing changes on
each branch of the phylogeny. Then it computes the
minimal number of heterochronic events that account
for every event-pair change and yields a consensus that
contains all hypotheses of movement that must necessarily form part of any equally parsimonious solution to
the observed event-pair changes [55]. This analysis provides a conservative estimate of change compared to the
simple mapping method or the more subjective cracking
method [6,58]. As recommended by Jeffery et al. [55],
optimizations were performed using both ACCTRAN
and DELTRAN options, and the consensus of the two
was accepted as the most conservative estimate of heterochronic shifts. It should be noted that Parsimov is a
highly conservative method and that the consensus of
ACCTRAN and DELTRAN is an estimate of minimal
heterochronic changes [59].
Although event-pair data are unsuitable for phylogenetic
analysis due to non-independence of event pairs [60], and
although the main objective of this study is not to infer
phylogenetic relationships among lipotyphlans, parsimony
analysis can be applied to explore the phylogenetic signal
within the data. A parsimony analysis of event-pair data
was conducted using PAUP* version 4.0b10 [61].
Modularity analysis

Using the data on the cranial ossification sequence, we
tested whether the cranial elements which belong to the
same hypothetical module exhibit coordinated shifts in
ossification timing [39]. To test for coordinated shifts in
ossification timing, theoretical developmental and phenotypic variational modules were first constructed. Theoretical modules are composed of sets of elements that are
predicted to exhibit coordinated timing of the first ossification. In this study, three independent hypothetical divisions were tested. Cranial elements were divided into two
developmental origin modules, the mesoderm module
and neural crest cell module, according to their reported
developmental origin in the mouse [62]. Alternatively,
cranial elements were classified into another independent
developmental division according to the mode of ossification, that is, the endochondral bone module and dermal

Page 8 of 18

bone module [63]. Phenotypic variational module division was based on the morphometric analyses, which
have identified five sub-divisions in the adult mammalian
skull: oral, zygomatic, nasal, cranial base, and cranial
vault [34,64,65]. Hypothetical module associations of
bone elements used in the analysis are listed in Table 3.
Integration of developmental timing was analyzed by
testing for the conservation of rank orders within sets of
traits across phylogeny [39]. If the order of development
of a set of modular events is evolutionarily conserved,
then the correlation of developmental sequence between
taxa is expected to be high. This we examine statistically
with the correlation coefficient for a given hypothesized
events [39]. Ossification sequences in pairs of sister taxa
were compared using Kendall’s τ, which measures the
degree of similarity of their sequences. Here, the correlation coefficient Kendall’s τ is calculated as:
T=

nc − nd
(nc + nd + nx ) nc + nd + ny

1/2

in which nc is the number of concordant pairs of ranks,
nd is the number of discordant pairs, nx is the number of
tied events in the first taxon (that is, the number of simultaneous ossification events within the taxon), and ny is the
number of tied events in the other taxon. We must note
that the Kendall’s τ correlation coefficient can be biased in
cases of many tied events, but our dataset has enough
resolution to calculate the coefficient.
The significance of the observed Kendall’s τ between
sister taxa was assessed for each module by comparing
it within the null distribution of similar numbered sets
of developmental events. We randomly sampled sets of
a comparable number of developmental events from the
whole events (iteration 1,000 times) and obtained the
correlation value (that is, Kendall’s τ) between taxa. For
instance, the vault module contains nine bones. In this
case, the rank correlation of nine vault bones between
two sister taxa is first computed. Next, nine random
events are sampled from the whole events, and then the
correlation of nine randomly sampled events between
the sister groups is computed. The null distribution for
correlation values is obtained by conducting this procedure 1,000 times. If the vault module is significantly
shifting as a whole, observed correlation value (that is,
Kendall’s τ) between the two taxa shall be ranked high
among the null distribution of randomly obtained correlation values.
This test is simple if only two taxa are compared (that is,
when comparing between terminal nodes), but comparisons on multiple species may involve statistical non-independence, which necessitates an approach that
incorporates information on phylogeny [39]. In these
cases, a version of Felsenstein’s independent contrast [66]

can circumvent the issue of non-independence of multiple
species comparison [39]. First, the hypothetical ancestral
developmental sequence is computed for each node. Then
independent comparisons of sequences are conducted
between pairs of independent nodes of the phylogeny [39].
Here the test statistic is the average Kendall’s τ value for
these node-pairs. The null distribution is obtained by calculating average correlation values of random samples
(iteration 1,000 times). The sequence of ancestral nodes
was reconstructed by averaging the sequences of sister
taxa joined at a particular node [39]. The averaged
sequence was considered as the hypothetical ancestral
sequence and then used for a pairwise significance test of
Kendall’s τ. It should be noted that since the actual
(extinct) ancestral sequence may not be simply the average
of descendent taxa, this technique potentially produces
biases. However, averaging is widely adopted in methods
such as independent contrasts [9,66]. If heterochronies in
ossification sequences have a strong modular pattern, such
a pattern would be detectable with this approach [9,39]. In
this study, a 0.05 significance level was adopted, and this
significance level was corrected using Bonferroni threshold
(P = 0.05/99). A random sampling procedure was done
with Poptools (Pest Animal Control Co-operative
Research Centre, Canberra, Australia) [67] and statistical
analyses were conducted in PAST [68].

Results
Variation in ossification sequence

Ossification sequences of each species are listed in Table 2,
and the frequency distribution of each stage is given in
Additional file 1. The rank variation of each cranial element across lipotyphlan species is summarized in Figure 5.
The distributions of the elements show that an ossification
event occurs predominantly in the early stages of the
whole ossification sequence (Figure 6). No intraspecific variation was found in ossification sequence for all species.
The most interspecifically variable elements in ossification
sequence were lacrimal, goniale, ectotympanic and mastoid. Presphenoid, dentary, frontal, maxilla, premaxilla and
petrosal were among the least variable elements. The mean
rank range for each phenotypic and developmental module
is listed in Table 4. Among the five phenotypic modules,
the vault module was the most variable followed by the
basicranial and zygomatic modules. When developmental
origin modules were compared, the mesoderm module was
more variable than the neural crest cell module. Among
the ossification mode modules, the cartilaginous bone
module was more variable than the dermal bone module.

the movements in the timing of ossification of cranial
elements detected by Parsimov. One potentially autapomorphic heterochronic pattern that characterizes lipotyphlans was found: the late onset of ossification of the
lacrimal bone relative to the pterygoid. No heterochrony
was found for nodes of Laurasiatheria, hedgehogs and
shrews, respectively. On the other hand, moles were
characterized by early ossifications of palatine (with
respect to premaxilla and frontal), nasal (with respect to
frontal and pterygoid), pterygoid (with respect to premaxilla, frontal and parietal), and vomer (with respect to
premaxilla, palatine, frontal and parietal). The clade consisting of Scapanus, Urotrichus, Mogera, and Talpa was
distinguished by a late onset of ossification of alisphenoid in relation to petrosal and presphenoid. The aquatic shrew Ch. pltaycephala was characterized by late
shifts of maxilla and premaxilla (with respect to palatine,

dentary and frontal), and lacrimal (with respect to basisphenoid and goniale) and early shifts of squamosal
(with respect to palatine, dentary and frontal), nasal
(with respect to palatine, dentary, frontal and pterygoid),
pterygoid (with respect to palatine and frontal), exoccipital (with respect to palatine, frontal, parietal and

Co. cristata was characterized by early development of
basioccipital (with respect to premaxilla, maxilla, palatine, dentary, frontal and parietal, squamosal, pterygoid
and supraoccipital), nasal (with respect to basiocciptial),
exoccipital (with respect to premaxilla, maxilla, palatine,

(with respect to basioccipital and ectotympanic).
The consensus tree of two equally parsimonious trees
resulting from the parsimony analysis of the event-pairing data (Additional file 3) was mostly incongruent with
the phylogeny taken as reference (Figure 2). The terrestrial outgroup species E. amurensis, S. murinus, and R.
norvegicus were clustered together. Although all six
mole species were clustered together, this cluster was
paraphyletic, given the position in it of C. platycephala’s
position.
Modularity analysis

Results of Poe’s modularity test [39] are summarized in
Table 6. No sets showed significant correlation for the
hypothetical modules. For the analysis of phenotypic
variational modules, one comparison showed a P-value
of 0.027 (oral module in T. europaea vs. T. occidentalis),
but this was not statistically significant under the Bonferroni threshold (0.05/99). Among the developmental
origin modules, although three sister group comparisons
(Erinaceidae-Soricidae node vs. Talpidae, Erinaceidae vs.
Soricidae and T. europaea vs. T. occidentalis) showed Pvalues lower than 0.05 for the neural crest cell module,

these values did not reach the Bonferroni corrected significance level. No significant correlation was found for
the mesoderm module in any sister group comparison.

Discussion
Sequence heterochrony

It has recently been proposed that the sequence of cranial
ossification is quite conservative and that few heterochronic shifts have occurred in mammalian evolution based on
the study of 17 boreoeutherians [6]. This previous study,
and other similar ones for other groups, used the fairly
conservative approach of Parsimov [69] to detect heterochrony. To make our study comparable, we also used Parsimov. Although we confirmed the general vertebrate
pattern (such as the early ossification of jaw bones with
respect to the neurocranial bones [11,70]) in lipotyphlans,
our analysis suggests that some heterochronies have
occurred during the evolution of this group. For example,
the late shifting of the lacrimal in respect to pterygoid
characterizes Lipotyphla. In addition, moles exhibit considerably derived features, such as the accelerated development of the palatine, nasal, pterygoid and vomer. This
indicates that the relatively early development of the
vomeronasal complex is an autapomorphic feature of
moles. In many mammals, bones in the vomeronasal

region are known to ossify later than the anterior dermal
bones (premaxilla, maxilla, palatine and frontal) [8,46,71].
However, it appears that the development of these bones
occurs virtually simultaneously with the above mentioned
anterior dermal bones in moles.
It is known that rostrum morphology is relatively robust
and box-shaped in moles compared to that of shrews and
hedgehogs. A robust snout is often used for boring
through the soil and to push away encountered objects
[72,73]. Mole snouts are equipped with highly touch-sensitive, domed mechanosensory organs called Eimer’s organs,
which are not found in other lipotyphlans, such as shrews,
hedgehogs and solenodons [74,75]. Moles have poor eyesight and gather much of their information by probing the
environment with the glabrous tip of their nose (rhinarium) [74,76]. Each Eimer’s organ functions as a tactile
receptor that contains a number of separate elements,
including sensory receptors and supporting epidermal tissue in a specific configuration [74]. The drastic early shift
of the vomeronasal complex may be related to the
increased importance of the rostrum for fossorial lifestyle
in moles, since the number of Eimer’s organs reflects the
surface area of the rhinarium [77], which is relatively large
in moles.
In contrast, the shrew mole U. talpoides, which is more
terrestrial [51,78], shows a secondary late shift of the nasal.

This indicates that, whereas all fossorial moles develop the
vomeronasal region early in embryogenesis, the terrestrial
shrew-like U. talpoides is an exception. It is reported that
U. talpoides possesses 1,310 Eimer’s organs, which is a
considerably small number compared to other true moles
(Mogera, 2,200; Talpa, 2,200; Scapanus, 2,470; Condylura,
26,000; Catania 2,000). It is also noteworthy that relative
size and robustness of the vomeronasal complex is
reduced in U. talpoides compared to that of other moles
and that its pointed gracile vomernasal organ resembles
that of shrews [74,79,80]. In contrast to other fossorial
moles, the more terrestrial U. talpoides has functional eyes
and a pointed gracile rostrum used for sniffing as in
shrews, whereas the role of the rostrum as a tactile sense
and boring appendage is reduced [Hisashi Abe, personal
communication]. It is conceivable that while the developmental timing of the vomeronasal complex shifted earlier
in the common ancestor of moles, since the role of the
snout was emphasized for subterranean lifestyle, the nasal
reverted to a later development through secondary terrestrial adaptations in U. talpoides. This scenario results from
the phylogenetic framework taken as reference, but it
should be noted that the position of the shrew moles in
talpid phylogeny is contested [47,51,52]
Another shift of the onset of ossification timing in
U. talpoides is found for the supraoccipital. Although the

Koyabu et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:21
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/21

supraoccipital has moved early in the common ancestor
of moles, this bone reverts to a later development in
U. talpoides. It is known that moles have undergone considerable morphological transformations associated
with digging [81-83]. For example, the supraoccipital
region is relatively increased in moles compared to other
lipotyphlans [84] and provides the space to attach the
enlarged musculus rhomboideus that functions as the
major digging muscle [83]. Whereas the m. rhomboideus
capitis is generally small in mammals, this muscle is considerably enlarged in moles [81,83]. Given that the
enlarged supraoccipital provides the attachment site for
the m. rhomboideus capitis, the early onset of the supraoccipital may be functionally coupled to the enlargement of
this bone in moles. At the same time, the reduced occipital
size in U. talpoides may reflect the reduced importance of
digging muscles.
Another notable heterochrony found among lipotyphlans is that the lacrimal (with respect to basisphenoid and
goniale), exoccipital (with respect to palatine, frontal and
parietal), and supraoccipital (with respect to frontal and
parietal) shift early in Ch. platycephala and in Co. cristata,
respectively. These two phylogenetically distant species
(Figure 2) are unique in comparison to other lipotyphlans
studied here in having independently acquired a semiaquatic lifestyle [85-87]. Although it is difficult to sort out
the functional significance of early development of these
bones, it may be related to adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle and swimming ability.
The phylogenetic relationships among shrews, hedgehogs and moles have been highly controversial [88-90].
While anatomical studies have conventionally suggested
a shrew + mole clade to the excursion of hedgehogs [90],
recent molecular studies supports the monophyly of
shrews and hedgehogs [49,88,89]. Although event pairs
are generally unsuitable for phylogenetic analysis due to
the non-independence of data [6,11,91], it is worth noting
that our exploratory parsimony based analysis resulted in
a clustering of moles with the inclusion of Ch. platycephala (Additional file 3).
Rank variability

Sánchez-Villagra et al. [6], whose study included 20 mammalian species, reported that the most interspecifically
variable cranial elements in terms of relative ossification
timing are the basioccipital, basisphenoid, jugal, parietal,
pterygoid and squamosal. In contrast, the lacrimal, goniale,
ectotympanic, mastoid, alisphenoid and nasal bones are
found as the most variable elements during the onset of
ossification in lipotyphlans (Figure 5). In a more inclusive
study on Rodentia, it is reported that the parietal, alisphenoid, squamosal, jugal, pterygoid and basisphenoid are the
most labile bones in terms of relative ossification timing
[8]. Although it appears that alisphenoid is similarly

Page 15 of 18

variable in rodents and lipotyphlans, this bone is not
reported to be highly variable across the major clades in
mammals [6]. Presphenoid, dentary, frontal, premaxilla,
maxilla and petrosal are the most conservative elements in
lipotyphlans. Consistent with our results, petrosal, dentary
and premaxilla are reported to be the least variable cranial
elements in rodents [8]. Similarly, Sánchez-Villagra et al.
[6] reported that the least variable elements include anterior facial bones, such as the dentary, maxilla, frontal and
premaxilla. This suggests that facial elements, which generally ossify at early stages of bone development (Figure
5), are less variable in terms of ossification timing.
Overall, the amount of variability in timing of ossification onset in lipotyphlan cranial bones was as follows, in
order of highest to lowest variability: mesoderm derived
endochondral bones, mesoderm derived dermal bones,
neural crest cell derived endochondral bones, and neural
crest cell derived dermal bones (Table 4). Thus, the cartilaginous bones are more variable as a whole than dermal
bones among the mesoderm derived bones, whereas
endochondral bones are similarly more variable than dermal bones within the neural crest cell derived bones
(Table 4). We also found that mesoderm derived bones
tend to be more variable than neural crest cell derived
bones. Sánchez-Villagra et al. [6] noted that the relative
ossification timing of neurocranial traits, especially
the basicranial bones, are more labile than the facial
elements. The basicranial bones are also apparently
highly variable as a whole within lipotyphlans (Figure 5,
Table 4). However, the cranial base also includes less
variable bones, such as presphenoid, petrosal and pterygoid. Instead, both developmental origin (mesoderm or
neural crest cells) and ossification mode (dermal or endochondral) are coupled with the evolutionary lability of
ossification timing.
Modularity of ossification heterochrony

On the whole there was little integration across all the
modules tested. No developmental module showed significant correlation for any sister group comparison. This
indicates that lipotyphlan ossification heterochrony is not
constrained by differences in developmental origins
(mesoderm or neural crest cells) or ossification mode (dermal or endochondral). Although developmental origin and
ossification mode of bones are considered to be highly
influential to morphological evolution in vertebrates
[62,92-94], it appears that ossification heterochrony is an
exception to this pattern. It is possible that the independence of ossification timing of each bone may facilitate the
labile alteration of ossification sequence and, thus, ease
consequent evolutionary changes in phenotypes. In addition, the lack of clear integration in ossification heterochrony among phenotypic modules indicates that
sequence heterochrony is virtually independent from

Koyabu et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:21
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/21

morphometrically derived phenotypic modules of the cranium, which is consistent with the results reported by
Goswami and colleagues [9,10]. Although adult phenotypic (metric) traits of the mammalian skull are reported to
exhibit a highly modular pattern [for example, [33,34,95]],
our results suggest that modularity in adult phenotypic
traits is not strongly linked to integration in ossification
sequence heterochrony. Functionally- or developmentallyintegrated structures have often been suggested to exhibit
coordinated shifts in developmental timing [10,11,13,96].
However, very few studies have explicitly examined the
relationship between modularity and sequence heterochrony [10,95]. Our results presented here suggest that
the hypothesis raised by Schoch [11] and others [12,13,96]
- that there is a modular pattern in sequence heterochrony
- is not supported for the case of lipotyphlans. Either the
lipotyphlan case is an exception, or the sampling or methods used in previous analyses are in need of expansion or
revision.
Although the integration of ossification heterochrony
for a priori hypothetical modules was tested in this study,
we did not attempt to detect heterochronic modules
from our ossification dataset. We must admit that the
modularity test and the following Bonferroni correction
adopted in this study are rather conservative to detect
modularity in sequence heterochrony. Development of
analytical tools to detect modularity directly from
sequence heterochrony data shall provide new avenues to
understand the role of modularity in the evolution of vertebrate cranial diversity.

Conclusion
The extensive examination of lipotyphlan craniogenesis
reveals notable heterochronies in the onset of ossification.
An early shift of developmental timing of the vomeronasal
complex has occurred in the common ancestor of moles.
This shift is most likely coupled with the robust nature of
the rostrum for boring and tactile sensing in subterranean
life. On the other hand, the nasal has reverted to a more
typical later development in the more terrestrial shrew
mole. This secondary shift in developmental timing can be
linked to the secondary shift (concluded from phylogeny)
to a terrestrial lifestyle and corresponding reduction of
shrew mole digging and sensory requirements. Finally, we
find no significant conservation of ossification timing
within modules constructed depending on developmental
origins or ossification modes. We reject the hypothesis
that ossification sequence heterochrony is more likely to
occur among different developmental modules. Although
developmental origin and ossification mode of bones are
considered to be highly influential to morphological evolution in vertebrates; in general, it is suggestible that lipotyphlan ossification heterochrony is not evolutionarily
constrained by differences in developmental origins

(mesoderm or neural crest cells) or ossification mode (dermal or endochondral).

Additional material
Additional file 1: Frequency distribution of specimens for each
stage. Ossification events are skewed toward earlier stages of sequences,
suggesting a greater concentration of ossification events and/or less
resolution early in the sequence.
Additional file 2: Heterochronies reported by the ACCTRAN and
DELTRAN. All the heterochronic events detected by the ACCTRAN and
DELTRAN are summarized.
Additional file 3: Phenogram obtained from parsimony analysis of
event-pair characters. The consensus tree is obtained from parsimony
analysis of event-paring scores. Although all six mole species were
clustered together, the phenogram was mostly incongruent with the
commonly accepted phylogenetic relationships.
