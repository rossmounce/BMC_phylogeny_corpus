Abstract
Background: The integrity of DNA molecules is fundamental for maintaining life. The DNA repair
proteins protect organisms against genetic damage, by removal of DNA lesions or helping to
tolerate them. DNA repair genes are best known from the gamma-proteobacterium Escherichia coli,
which is the most understood bacterial model. However, genome sequencing raises questions
regarding uniformity and ubiquity of these DNA repair genes and pathways, reinforcing the need
for identifying genes and proteins, which may respond to DNA damage in other bacteria.
Results: In this study, we employed a bioinformatic approach, to analyse and describe the open
reading frames potentially related to DNA repair from the genome of the alpha-proteobacterium
Caulobacter crescentus. This was performed by comparison with known DNA repair related genes
found in public databases. As expected, although C. crescentus and E. coli bacteria belong to separate
phylogenetic groups, many of their DNA repair genes are very similar. However, some important
DNA repair genes are absent in the C. crescentus genome and other interesting functionally related
gene duplications are present, which do not occur in E. coli. These include DNA ligases,
exonuclease III (xthA), endonuclease III (nth), O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (ada
gene), photolyase-like genes, and uracil-DNA-glycosylases. On the other hand, the genes imuA and
imuB, which are involved in DNA damage induced mutagenesis, have recently been described in C.
crescentus, but are absent in E. coli. Particularly interesting are the potential atypical phylogeny of
one of the photolyase genes in alpha-proteobacteria, indicating an origin by horizontal transfer, and
the duplication of the Ada orthologs, which have diverse structural configurations, including one
that is still unique for C. crescentus.
Conclusion: The absence and the presence of certain genes are discussed and predictions are
made considering the particular aspects of the C. crescentus among other known DNA repair
pathways. The observed differences enlarge what is known for DNA repair in the Bacterial world,
and provide a useful framework for further experimental studies in this organism.

Background
The removal of lesions from the DNA molecule depends,
mostly, on cellular DNA repair capacity. Several highly
conserved mechanisms efficiently remove those DNA

lesions that frequently occur in the cell's genetic material,
thereby ensuring genomic integrity. Most of what is
known for bacterial DNA repair mechanisms derives from
studies in E. coli. However, genome sequencing has

revealed a large number of genes with unknown functions, and clear differences raise questions on the ubiquity
of similar DNA repair pathways within the bacterial kingdom. For example, it was recently described for Mycobacterium tuberculosis that the induction of functional DNA
repair genes by DNA lesions is not entirely dependent on
RecA protein. In fact, there are at least two induction pathways for DNA repair genes in this gram-positive bacterium
[1].
Alpha-proteobacteria include soil bacteria such as those
involved in the global nitrogen cycle (Bradyrhizobium,
Mesorhizobium, Nitrobacter, Sinorhizobium and Rhizobium),
plant tumor-inducing bacterium (Agrobacterium), and
bacteria frequently found in water (Candidatus, Caulobacter, Erythrobacter, Jannaschia, Sphingopyxis, Silicibacter).
In this group of bacteria, pathogenic organisms are also
included (Anaplasma, Bartonella, Brucella, some species of
Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Ehrlichia). Other members
present environmental interest as ethanol producers
(Zymomonas), or by their capacity for degrading a wide
range of toxic organic compounds, thereby assuming a
bioremediation role (Novosphingobium, Rhodopseudomonas
and Rhodobacter). The species Gluconobacter oxydans, by
being able to oxidize a wide variety of substrates, has a
great importance within the food and pharmaceutical
industries [2,3].
The aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus is an important model organism for studies on bacterial cell cycle and
differentiation, but as for other alpha-proteobacteria, very
little is known about its DNA repair pathways. C. crescentus has the ability to survive in low-nutrient environments, and produces two different cell types (a sessile
stalked cell and a motile swarmer cell) which are, in fact,
important life forms of its cell cycle [4]. Its genome, composed of 4,016,942 base pairs, encodes 3,767 genes [5].
The availability of the complete genome sequence from C.
crescentus allows for an "in silico" analysis which may contribute towards understanding the strategies this bacterium uses to live, including how it processes its DNA
molecule.
For DNA repair studies, photoreactivation was established
in alpha-proteobacteria when C. crescentus [6] and Rhodobacter [7] bacteria were irradiated with ultraviolet (UV),
and photorepair was observed when submitted to high
doses of visible light. In both bacteria, genes that code for
proteins of the photolyase family may perform this function. An alkB mutant in C. crescentus was shown as highly
sensitive to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate
(MMS), and the expression of this gene is dependent on
the cell cycle of the bacteria [8]. Additionally, DNA polymorphism at the alkB locus was previously described in
Brucella abortus [9]. Recently, this gene has been described

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/17

as related to a new DNA repair pathway, oxidative
demethylation [10]. The description of a constitutive O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in Rhizobium
meliloti confirms the presence of a third DNA damage
reversal mechanism in the alpha-proteobacteria group
[11].
The reactivation of bacteriophages in C. crescentus exposed
to 5–10 J/m2 of UV [6], the phenotypic characterization of
mutants for uvrA, uvrB and uvrC in order to investigate the
sensitivity to radiation in Rhodobacter sphaeroides [12], and
functional complementation studies in Sinorhizobium
meliloti [13] indicate the existence of an SOS response in
these alpha-proteobacteria. This is confirmed by the identification of the recA and lexA orthologs, which control the
SOS regulon. In addition, several other studies have been
carried out to unravel the SOS box in this group of bacteria [14-18]. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of
DNA repair pathways in heavy metal stress in C. crescentus
[19]. The phenotypes of mutants in the xthA gene of Brucella abortus [20] correlate well with the function of this
gene in base excision repair (BER), as already described in
E. coli. Finally, Galhardo et al [21] characterized the imuAB
dnaE2 operon, indicating that it is involved in DNA damage induced mutagenesis under SOS regulon control in C.
crescentus. However, in the same work, there was no evidence that another translesion DNA polymerase, DinB,
was controlled by the SOS response in this bacterium,
raising the possibility that a different regulatory pathway
may be operational for this gene in this bacterium.
Here we present a comparison of the main DNA repair
genes between C. crescentus and E. coli. For this analysis,
we searched for open reading frames (ORFs) in the C. crescentus genome that present a significant similarity with
known DNA repair related genes, especially those from E.
coli. As the genes involved in DNA repair are, in general,
part of the cell core metabolism, they maintain a strong
similarity in different bacterial genomes, but intriguing
differences suggest biological diversity in bacterial
responses to DNA damage. This "in silico" study provides
important insights regarding DNA repair pathways in C.
crescentus, and those of the alpha-proteobacteria group,
thereby giving a direction for further functional characterization.

Results and discussion
The genome of C. crescentus was screened for the presence
of genes known to act in the metabolism of DNA lesions,
most in E. coli. This comparison lead to the identification
of many of the DNA repair related pathways. In order to
facilitate comprehension of the main similarities and differences among these genomes, genes have been classified
as: 1-Excision repair (base excision repair, nucleotide
excision repair and mismatch repair); 2- Direct repair

(photoreactivation, alkyltransfer and oxidative demethylation); 3- Recombinational repair and 4- Other DNA
repair related proteins.
1 – Excision repair
A – Base excision repair (BER)
The BER pathway has been found in all living organisms,
and involves several different proteins with the functions
of DNA glycosylases and endonucleases. These enzymes
are able to remove damaged bases induced by different
means, such as those lesions spontaneously generated by
oxidative stress. In BER, damaged bases are removed from
the DNA backbone in a free form by specific DNA glycosylases, leaving an abasic apurinic or pyrimidinic (AP)
site. An AP-endonuclease nicks the DNA at the position of
these abasic sites, and subsequently a repair patch is synthesized, thus restoring the original molecule [22]. The
main genes involved in BER are listed in Table 1. There are
two main types of DNA glycosylases, the Fpg/Nei and
Nth/MutY families, both represented in the genome of C.
crescentus. In addition to their glycosylase activity, several
of these enzymes also display a lyase activity that cleaves
the phosphodiester backbone 3' to the AP site, so they are
known as bifunctional glycosylases. Although a Nei
ortholog was not found, the Fpg protein may participate
in the removal of oxidative lesions in this bacterium. The
exonuclease III, coded by the xthA gene, is responsible for
most AP-endonuclease activity in the BER system in E. coli.
In C. crescentus, we found two distinct close orthologs of
exonuclease III (xthA1, xthA2), but this does not necessar-

ily represent redundancy. The second ortholog of
XthAmay compensate for the absence of the endonucleases Nfo and Nfi. The gene for the other protein of the
same family, mutY, is also found in one copy.
The ung/udg gene, which encodes uracil-DNA glycosylase,
is critical for the removal of uracil from DNA. Uracil,
which is normally misincorporated during replication,
may also result from cytosine deamination, yielding C to
T transition mutations [23]. The presence of four genes
coding for proteins of the uracil-DNA-glycosylase family
in C. crescentus suggests the importance of deamination of
cytosine in this genome. Although they have no significant sequence similarity to the UDG protein found in E.
coli, they all belong to the UDG family (COG1573) previously described in Thermotoga maritima [24]. Thus, these
proteins may be important for the stability of this G:C rich
genome [25]. Orthologs of the AlkA and Tag, which are
the main proteins responsible for the repair of methylated
bases in E. coli by BER, are also found in C. crescentus
genome.
B – Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
Distortion in the double helix caused by certain lesions
seems to be the first signal for the recognition of damage
by the NER system, which is capable of recognizing a
larger variety of base modifications, using more generic
endonucleases than the BER system. Lesion removal in
the intact oligonucleotide form, instead of as free bases as
seen in BER pathway, is performed by the sequential

action of damage recognition proteins, nuclease and helicase proteins, followed by DNA polymerization and ligation by DNA ligase [26]. This pathway, which mainly
consists of the proteins UvrA, UvrB, the nuclease UvrC,
the helicase UvrD and the dsDNA translocase Mfd, is complete in C. crescentus (Table 2).
It is interesting to note that in C. crescentus there are three
copies of small genes corresponding to an endonuclease
domain (COG2827). This domain [27] is also observed in
the N-terminal portion of the UvrC protein, and the genes
are often annotated in the genomes of several other organisms such as "UvrC-like protein, N-terminal". Although
the role of these potential endonucleases in the repair of
C. crescentus is unknown, other proteins, also containing
a similar domain, have likewise been observed, as is the
case of the protein encoded by cho (uvrC homolog) gene
of E. coli. Cho protein is a homolog to the N-terminus of
UvrC, and makes a DNA incision at 3' from certain types
of DNA damage, where UvrC is less efficient [28]. Cho is
a damage inducible protein whereas UvrC is not, both
being found together only in few bacteria [29]. Some of
the Cho homologs, particularly those belonging to the
beta proteobacteria group (Table 3), present an N-terminus fusion with a putative 3'exonuclease domain, similar
to the epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III. These two
activities (endonuclease and exonuclease) of this fusion
protein were proposed to act in coordinate and sequential
functions in a new DNA repair mechanism [30]. These C.
crescentus UvrC-like endonucleases encode proteins with
sizes ranging from 96 to 123 amino acid residues, and are
widespread in proteobacteria of the alpha group,
although they can also be found in other bacterial groups
(Table 3). Although these paralogs may indicate functional redundancy, they may play roles similar to those of
the Cho protein. In other words, they may act in NER, but
on different types of DNA damage, being back up
enzymes for the UvrC protein. In support of this hypoth-

several bacterial genomes, as it is shown in Table 3. But
whether these small endonucleases share with the Cho
protein similar mechanisms for incision, and which
lesions they recognize, remain open questions. In Figure
1, a scheme representing the UvrC and the UvrC-like proteins illustrates their different domains. Although these
putative endonucleases share low similarity with the
larger Cho protein, they all contain a similar domain
(COG2827). It is important to mention that one of these
UvrC-like genes in C. crescentus (CC3518) presents an
SOS box, indicating that it is under control of the LexA
repressor control and is part of the SOS regulon [21]. This
reinforces the hypothesis that this protein acts in DNA
repair mechanisms.
Transcription-coupled repair is most likely to be functional in the C. crescentus genome, since the gene mfd and
the complete NER pathway are found in this genome. Mfd
is a well conserved bacterial protein which is a coupling
factor for NER with transcription. In E. coli the enzyme
encoded by this gene is capable of removing the transcription complex when it is found stalled on damage, leaving
room for DNA excision repair recruitment to the site of a
DNA lesion [31].
C – Mismatch repair (MMR)
The MMR pathway acts as an editor, correcting mismatched base pairs introduced in DNA by several processes, including replication and recombination. The
complex MutS/MutL recognizes a DNA replicative error or
misalignment, followed by excision of the section containing the mismatch [32]. In C. crescentus, MMR is probably performed by mutS/mutL homologs (Table 4). In E.
coli, MutH is an endonuclease that participates in the recognition of GATC methylated sequences, discriminating
the DNA strand to be repaired by MMR. In C. crescentus,
there is no mutH homolog, which correlates well with the
absence of dam homologs that normally perform GATC

esis, there is strong relationship between the presence of
cho genes and the absence of these endonuclease genes in

methylation. However, it should be remarked that mutH
homologs are rarely found in other bacterial genomes.

Therefore, this implies that C. crescentus and other bacteria
must use different proteins for strand recognition and
incision to complete MMR.
Very short patch (Vsp) repair is initiated by the action of
the protein Vsr, which is also an endonuclease. This pathway corrects T:G mismatches to C:G base pairs, if this mismatch is within a hemi-methylated Vsr recognition site.
The endonuclease activity of Vsr, responsible for cutting 5'
of the misplaced T, is stimulated by MutL in E. coli [33].
An ortholog of Vsr is found in the C. crescentus genome,
but its function remains to be confirmed.
2 – Direct repair
Several repair mechanisms revert lesions in DNA, removing damage by a single step. The reversion can be achieved
by photoreactivation, alkyltransfer and oxidative demethylation. The corresponding genes found in C. crescentus
are shown in Table 5.
A – Photoreactivation
The mechanism of photoreactivation is performed by
enzymes known as photolyases, which employ visible
light as energy source to monomerize pyrimidine dimers
induced by UV irradiation. The photolyase family
includes repair proteins (photolyases) and blue light
receptors (cryptochromes), the common feature of these
proteins being the presence of a FAD chromophore as
cofactor. These genes are well conserved and are found
throughout the three domains of life, from bacteria to
aplacental mammals [34]. Only one photolyase is found

in E. coli, while C. crescentus has two putative homologs of
this family (Table 5), although one of these is only photolyase-related, and its function in DNA repair is not clear.
A phylogenetic tree for the main Phr proteins is presented
in figure 2. The photolyase-related gene was not included
as it is highly divergent. Curiously, the C. crescentus protein is located far from the known bacterial photolyases
and closer to the branch where the Eukaryotes (mainly
plants) are found. On the other hand, some recently
described phr bacterial orthologs (from another alphaproteobacteria and some firmicutes) are also in the same
branch. It is difficult to establish the origin of such a gene,
as it may have occurred from an old duplication later lost
in most of the bacterial species. Alternatively, this could
represent a potential horizontal gene transfer event
involving Eukarya and Bacteria. Tree topology also indicates that the C. crescentus phr gene may not be involved in
DNA damage repair, as their known orthologs of plants
are Cry1 genes, which are blue light photoreceptors
related only to the regulation and development of plant
growth [35]. Although this phylogenetic approach has
been very useful for gene function predictions [36], the
participation of the C. crescentus phr gene in photorepair
must be determined experimentally.
B – Alkyltransferase
Proteins participating in this mechanism, products of the
ada and ogt genes, are alkyltransferases which transfer
alkyl adducts from damaged DNA to themselves, in a nonenzymatic suicide mechanism [37]. Ada is also an important and interesting protein involved in gene expression

regulation. The protein is normally comprised of a N-terminal regulatory domain, and a C-terminal catalytic
domain, but other bacteria present other forms of gene
organization (Figure 3). In E. coli the regulatory and alkyltransferase functions are present in the product of a
unique gene (ada). Homologs to the alkyltransferase
domain (normally called Ogt, for O6-alkyl-guanine transferase) also occur independently of the regulatory Ada
domain, and are present and highly conserved in several
organisms of the three domains of life [38]. Thus, this
may be an ancient protein, and the Ada protein is probably a result of domain fusion. The regulatory domain also
appears fused with an alkyl glycosylase domain in some
bacteria. This domain, related to the AlkA protein of E.
coli, is also important in the process of removing alkylated
bases from DNA (BER). Interestingly, the Ralstonia
genome presents genes that encode for both combinations of Ada proteins (Ada-Ogt and Ada-AlkA). In other
organisms such as Bacillus subtilis [39] and Listeria, two different genes encode each domain separately, thus reinforcing the idea of gene fusion as the origin of Ada
organization. While in Bacillus subtilis the two domains
overlap by 11 base pairs, those in Listeria are arranged in
the opposite direction.
In the C. crescentus genome there are four orthologs of the
alkyl transferase gene, two that do not present any N-terminal regulatory domain (ogt orthologs), and two that
have the regulatory domain similar to the E. coli ada gene
(Table 5). The presence of these four genes reinforces the
importance of this type of repair for this free-living bacterium. However, the two ada orthologs of C. crescentus are
different as regards the regulatory domain, not previously
described. The commonly found regulatory ada domain
found in nature comprises two different protein motifs:

one related to DNA binding (ada-zinc binding site) [40]
and one potentially responsible for a transcriptional activation (HTH-AraC) [41]. In the two C. crescentus ada
orthologs, the N-terminus lacks either one or the other of
the portion motifs. While homologs of the gene lacking
DNA-binding-motif (CC3729) are found in many other
bacteria, the copy lacking the transcription activation
motif (CC0709) is still unique for the C. crescentus
genome. The meaning and role of such different alkyl
transferase orthologs in this bacterium deserve further
experimental investigation.
C – Oxidative demethylation
Alkylated damage may also be repaired through oxidative
demethylation [10]. In E. coli, the single gene participating
in this pathway is alkB, whose transcription is under ada
gene regulation. This protein is well conserved with
homologs in various organisms, including human beings.
The protein removes the methyl group from 1-methyladenine and 3-methyl-cytosine, by an alpha-ketoglutarate
dependent oxidative reaction, releasing formaldehyde,
and healing the damage [10]. An alkB ortholog is found in
the C. crescentus genome, and the phenotype of a mutant
strain confirms hypersensitivity to the alkylating agent
MMS [8]. These results validate the role of the alkB
ortholog for the repair of alkyl DNA lesions in C. crescentus.
3 – Recombinational repair
Recombinational repair is crucial in maintaining genome
integrity, since it is necessary for repairing single-strand
gaps and double-strand DNA breaks or restoring the replication fork. In E. coli, there are two pathways that act
independently of each other to initiate recombinational
repair. The so-called RecBCD and RecFOR pathways

recruit RecA to single-stranded DNA, to initiate the repair

by a functionally equivalent pathway, AddAB, as it has
been shown for another alpha proteobacterium, Rhizobium etli [43]. The RecBCD function can also be provided,
in part, by RecFOR, as has been suggested for D. radiodurans [44] and for E. coli, where the viability of RecBCD
mutants is restored by the RecFOR pathway [45]. On the
other hand, the absence of the complete SbcBCD antirecombination pathway may be related to the absence of
RecBCD, as this is also observed for genomes from other
alpha-proteobacteria and mollicutes [46].
The initial step of recombination is followed by the resolution of the Holliday junction by helicase and endonuclease activities, performed by members of RuvABC, a
pathway that is complete in C. crescentus. The presence of
another gene in C. crescentus (CC1283), an ATPase related
to ruvB subunit, the only redundancy present in the
recombinational repair pathway in this bacterium, should
be mentioned. The lack of homologs of recE and recT
genes is not surprising as these are encoded by a prophage
being restricted to some E. coli K12-strains. Moreover,
genes involved in the non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA repair (similar to the Ku proteins of Eukaryotes) that have been identified in a number of bacterial
species [47] were not found in C. crescentus.

4 – Other repair related proteins
A – SOS system
The SOS regulon is a set of physiological responses to
damage in DNA. In E. coli, this is well described and
involves the participation of more than 40 genes [48].
Under normal conditions, the LexA protein curbs the
expression of SOS genes by binding to their promoters.
The induction of such a system stems from the coprotease
activity of the protein RecA, which inactivates the LexA
repressor. The presence of the main regulatory genes of
the SOS response (lexA and recA) in C. crescentus (Table 7)
indicates a similar SOS regulon. However, the number of
genes under SOS control remains to be investigated in C.
crescentus. The SOS functions are normally induced in
response to stress conditions to ensure survival, but the
mutation rates can be increased. The genes umuC and
umuD form a complex UmuC/UmuD2, known as DNA
polymerase V [49], being responsible to a large degree for
the induced mutagenesis by the SOS system in E. coli, but
this polymerase is absent in C. crescentus. It is intriguing
that the SOS inducible and error prone DNA polymerase
IV (dinB), also involved in translesion synthesis in E. coli
[50], presents a different regulation in C. crescentus. In fact,
the SOS induced mutagenesis in C. crescentus has been
shown to be promoted by enzymes encoded by an
operon, including a second copy of DnaE (the catalytic
subunit of DNA polymerase III) and other genes named
imuA and imuB [21]. Orthologs to imuAB and dnaE2 genes
are found in many other genomes, indicating that this

enzymatic machinery is widely implicated in stress
induced mutagenesis and contributes to genetic variability in the bacterial domain.
The nudix-hydrolase superfamily includes the E. coli
MutT, which hydrolyses 8-oxodGTP, avoiding its incorporation during DNA synthesis, and other genes that may
also be involved in the sanitization of the nucleotide pool
[51]. The existence of several proteins of this family in
bacterial genomes is quite common, and, for example, in
D. radiodurans 22 proteins of such family have been identified [52]. In C. crescentus, we have found 11 proteins
(Table 7) that share the NUDIX motif, but CC0833 is

most probably the mutT ortholog.
The recX gene, which codes for a negative regulator of the
RecA function in E. coli, has been detected in most bacterial species [53,54]. However, RecX homologs were not
found in C. crescentus or in other alpha proteobacteria,
suggesting a different type of RecA regulation for this
group of bacteria.

family) ligases are characteristic of Eukaryotes and
Archaea, and the NAD-dependent (type I family) ligases
are characteristic of Bacteria. Sometimes, both families are
present in bacteria, as is the case of C. crescentus (Table 7).
The participation of the ATP-dependent ligase in DNA
recombination and repair has been proposed [55].

ing DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase is the DinG protein, and a homolog was found in C. crescentus (CC2038)
[57]. This protein is a bacterial homolog for human helicases that are known to participate in DNA repair, and
mutations have been related to some human genetic diseases.

C – Helicases
The helicases change the structure of DNA and RNA to
allow for the access to transcriptional machinery. The
gene lhr encodes a large helicase. The restricted distribution of this helicase in bacteria and its common duplication among the Archaea suggest that the gene may be a
recent acquisition, through horizontal gene transfer, by
some bacteria [56]. In C. crescentus, we have identified one
copy of this gene as is shown in Table 7. Another interest-

Conclusion
As very little is known about DNA repair in C. crescentus,
the relevance of this comparative analysis is to provide the
basis for investigating the putative genes and pathways
detected in the genome of this bacterium. Many of the
predictions generated through bioinformatic analyses
also contributed to the identification of many gene duplications and modifications, which raised potentially differ-

ent strategies of DNA repair in C. crescentus and other
related bacteria.
DNA repair genes represent the core DNA metabolism, are
in general strongly conserved, and C. crescentus has, as
expected, many similarities to E. coli. However, the
absence of some orthologs may reflect components of
proteins that can be backed up by other repair pathways,
as for the RecBCD complex. Otherwise, the main genes
related to BER and NER pathways, including transcription-coupled repair, are detected in C. crescentus, as well as
many of the recombinational repair genes. As in E. coli, an
SOS regulon is found in C. crescentus, since the main genes
(recA and lexA repressor) are identified, although SOS
induced mutagenesis is related to a different mechanism
[21]. C. crescentus also has some interesting non-identical
gene duplications which include DNA ligases, the main
subunit (DnaE) of DNA polymerase III, exonuclease III
and alkytransferases. Interesting gene structures were
identified for the alkyltransferases, one of which is still
unique for C. crescentus.
Although most of the in silico inferences must be confirmed and tested by experimentation, this work provides
a profile of those genes responsible for the maintenance
of genome stability in C. crescentus, contributing to the
understanding of the mechanisms of genome protection
and mutagenesis in alpha-proteobacteria. It also provides
a useful framework for further investigations on the functions of these genes.

distance matrix was constructed using a PAM matrix
model [62]. Bootstrap support (resampled 1,000 times)
was calculated, and strict consensus trees constructed.
Only bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown. Similar topologies were found for both algorithms employed,
only Neighbor-Joining being displayed. The consensus
trees obtained were viewed through TreeView software
[63]. In this work, the option for non-rooted trees aims at
demonstrating only the relationship among organisms,
without, however, linking ancestors and descendants.
Organism names with the accession code of the Phr and
Phr-like proteins analyzed are shown in Table 8.

Methods
Identification of DNA repair genes
The putative ORFs in C. crescentus and E. coli were compared with known DNA repair related genes in public
databases using the BlastP search in Genebank nonredundant (nr) database [58]. In some specific cases,
potential DNA repair genes in C. crescentus genome (GenBank accession n° AE005673) were identified both by
sequence similarity searches (using as seed sequences
orthologs from other organisms) and keyword searches.
C. crescentus candidate genes were thus confirmed both by
sequence similarity searches (BlastP program) and
domain analysis.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic trees were generated for a group of Phr protein homologs. Protein sequences were aligned using the
ClustalX multiple sequence alignment program [59] with
manual adjustment with Genedoc (v2.6.02). Only unambiguously aligned positions (excluding poorly conserved
and gap regions) were used in phylogenetic analysis,
which was performed using the Phylip program version
3.5 [60]. Parsimony analysis was conducted using the Protpars program, whereas distance methods were performed
using the Neighbor-Joining [61] method in Phylip. The
