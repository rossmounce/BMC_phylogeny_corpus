coding sequence horizontally distributed among
diverse bacterial and eucaryotic microbes

Abstract
Background: Intragenic tandem repeats occur throughout all domains of life and impart functional and structural
variability to diverse translation products. Repeat proteins confer distinctive surface phenotypes to many unicellular
organisms, including those with minimal genomes such as the wall-less bacterial monoderms, Mollicutes. One such
repeat pattern in this clade is distributed in a manner suggesting its exchange by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
Expanding genome sequence databases reveal the pattern in a widening range of bacteria, and recently among
eucaryotic microbes. We examined the genomic flux and consequences of the motif by determining its
distribution, predicted structural features and association with membrane-targeted proteins.
Results: Using a refined hidden Markov model, we document a 25-residue protein sequence motif tandemly
arrayed in variable-number repeats in ORFs lacking assigned functions. It appears sporadically in unicellular
microbes from disparate bacterial and eucaryotic clades, representing diverse lifestyles and ecological niches that
include host parasitic, marine and extreme environments. Tracts of the repeats predict a malleable configuration of
recurring domains, with conserved hydrophobic residues forming an amphipathic secondary structure in which
hydrophilic residues endow extensive sequence variation. Many ORFs with these domains also have membranetargeting sequences that predict assorted topologies; others may comprise reservoirs of sequence variants. We
demonstrate expressed variants among surface lipoproteins that distinguish closely related animal pathogens
belonging to a subgroup of the Mollicutes. DNA sequences encoding the tandem domains display dyad symmetry.
Moreover, in some taxa the domains occur in ORFs selectively associated with mobile elements. These features, a
punctate phylogenetic distribution, and different patterns of dispersal in genomes of related taxa, suggest that the
repeat may be disseminated by HGT and intra-genomic shuffling.
Conclusions: We describe novel features of PARCELs (Palindromic Amphipathic Repeat Coding ELements), a set of
widely distributed repeat protein domains and coding sequences that were likely acquired through HGT by diverse
unicellular microbes, further mobilized and diversified within genomes, and co-opted for expression in the
membrane proteome of some taxa. Disseminated by multiple gene-centric vehicles, ORFs harboring these
elements enhance accessory gene pools as part of the “mobilome” connecting genomes of various clades, in taxa
sharing common niches.

Background
Intragenic repeats encoding recurrent protein domains
are abundant, diverse and profoundly affect protein
structure and function in a broad assortment of cellular
processes and diseases [1-4]. Repeat proteins typically
contain tandemly arrayed, redundant sequence patterns

of 20-40 amino acids, and many embody extended
architectures (structured or disordered) with a capacity
to bind natural ligands with a broad range of specificities [4,5], a property recently exploited to engineer specific binding in synthetic counterparts [5,6]. While most
abundant in higher eucaryotes [4,7,8], repeat proteins
also occur widely among surface proteins of unicellular
microbes [8,9], where they mediate interactions within
complex environments and communities, and confer

variable phenotypes promoting niche adaptation. Surface
membrane proteins with repeating sequence motifs
abound even among minimalist organisms such as
Mollicutes (phylum Tenericutes, herein also termed
mycoplasmas) a clade of wall-less monoderms with
minimal-size, low G+C genomes and parasitic lifestyles.
These products are most commonly encoded by families
of accessory genes [10,11] specific to a particular clade
or individual taxon, in which distinctive repeats are
encoded by individual genes [12-14]. As in many parasitic microbes [8], most repeat proteins of Mollicutes contain highly similar sequences repeated within an ORF. A
notable exception to this theme is a tandem repeat pattern of 25 residues, initially reported in the LppQ lipoprotein (LP) expressed on the surface of the bovine
pathogen Mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides small
colony biotype (Mmm SC) and later in another surface
LP of this organism [15,16]. Repeats of this category
contain conserved amino acid residues but show considerable sequence variation among individual copies, analogous to other classes of well-studied repeat proteins
described [4,5]. Moreover, whereas ORFs with this pattern were initially limited to a narrow phylogenetic
group of Mollicutes termed the “Mycoplasma mycoides
cluster” of ruminant pathogens [17,18], counterparts in
the genome of the caprine pathogen Mycoplasma agalactiae (from a distinct phylogenetic clade of the Mollicutes) have been recently reported, and are proposed to
represent gene exchange through HGT between these
disparate taxa sharing common hosts [19]. The distinctive sequence diversity in this repeat pattern, its demonstrated expression in two known surface membrane
proteins, and the prospect that the coding sequence is
disseminated horizontally prompted its further examination as a model for the acquisition of a versatile coding
module contributing to proteomic diversity.
Analyses of sequence databases by others have independently identified two motifs that correspond indirectly to the sequence pattern described, each defined by
a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) [20]: (i) DUF
(domain of unknown function) 285, termed “mycoplasma protein of unknown function” or “protein of
unknown function, lipoprotein predicted” (Pfam [21]:
03382; InterPro [22]: IPR005046) and (ii) “bacterial surface protein 26-residue repeat” (TIGRFAM [23]:
TIGR02167; InterPro: IPR011889). Inspection showed
that while these HMMs approximate and include the
original sequence pattern, neither description defines a
uniform unit repeat, the predicted nature of the
repeated domain, accurate features of many ORFs now
identified, or the phylogenetic groups represented by
these motifs. Repeated interrogations of protein
sequence databases [24] revealed that these HMMs
occur in ORFs from an increasingly broad range of

Page 2 of 20

organisms, including remotely-related clades of bacteria
and, more recently, selected lineages of unicellular
eucaryotes and metagenomic samples from the marine
environment. These observations prompted us to characterize the distribution and predicted properties of the
motif in order to understand its possible exploitation as
a genetic module, and to ascribe more informative attributes to this broadly disseminated DUF.
Here we refine the definition of this repeat sequence
motif and report its dispersal among genomes representing diverse parasitic and environmental bacteria, unicellular eucaryotes, and samples of the marine
metagenome. Using several examples, we describe its
predicted secondary structure and sequence variation,
the unexpected dyad symmetry of its coding sequences,
and its occurrence in ORFs encoding assorted types of
membrane proteins. We experimentally verify its contribution to phenotypic diversity in expressed surface proteins of two closely related mycoplasmal pathogens. By
comparing the complete genome sequences of related
taxa from lineages representing multiple, disparate phylogenetic clades, we further document chromosomal distributions of the motif and its association with mobility
elements that suggest transfer by HGT and intra-genomic shuffling in diverse evolutionary settings. Through
these studies we define the protein domain and coding
sequence PARCEL (Palindromic Amphipathic Repeat
Coding ELement), having newly-recognized attributes of
structural versatility and adaptive variation, with a capacity to expand and diversify repertoires of membrane
proteins in some taxa. We reason that this repeat
sequence has been transferred by multiple pathways as
part of the pervasive mobilome that actively shapes the
genomic makeup of selected microorganisms.

Results and Discussion
Dispersal of a tandemly arrayed repeat protein sequence
in the genomes of unicellular microbes from diverse
phylogenetic clades and ecological niches

To establish an operational motif we first constructed an
HMM based on a training dataset of ORFs from genomes of Mollicutes that contained a previously reported
25-residue amino acid sequence pattern [15], then
refined the HMM using iterations of data sets expanded
from successive searches of the non-redundant protein
sequence database [24]. The HMM included sequences
from diverse organisms representing very different phylogenetic histories, genomic sizes and G+C contents.
We interrogated a recent version of this database (nr;
October 30, 2009; 9,967,556 sequences) with the HMM
to inventory the current set of unique ORFs bearing the
motif. ORFs retrieved (Additional file 1, sheet 1) were
organized using NCBI taxonomic classifiers [24]. Under
the two superkingdoms represented, Bacteria and

Röske et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:430
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/430

Eucaryota, the corresponding taxa are organized by
genus, species and further identifiers. Individual ORFs of
a taxon are denoted by unique identifiers (GI and accession numbers), overall HMM scores and numbers of
HMM domains present in each. From our low stringency search, fourteen ORFs with poor HMM scores
(E-values > 1) were excluded from consideration (not
shown). The remaining 461 unique ORFs retrieved by
the HMM span a variety of taxonomic groups (further
detailed below). Nearly all ORFs, irrespective of taxon,
contain multiple copies of the HMM domain. When
parsed to show the order and location of individual
domains (Additional file 1, sheet 2), most ORFs revealed
tracts comprising multiple tandem repeats, ranging from
two to 59 units in length. Examples are illustrated in
Figure 1. This conspicuous feature also pertained to a
set of 1736 ORFs (Additional file 2, sheet 1 and sheet 2)
retrieved with the HMM from the separate database
[24] of non-redundant protein sequences from environmental samples (nr_env; July 6, 2009; 6,028,192
sequences). These ORFs represented individual
sequences derived from the Global Ocean Sampling
(GOS) project [25] and are not assigned to taxa.
The nature and configuration of individual repeats
recognized by the HMM varied among ORFs. The great
majority from either database contained tandem arrays
of canonical 25-residue repeats, whereas some others
contained tracts having intermittent repeats with more
or fewer than 25 residues (examples in Figure 1A and
1B). These non-canonical repeats had lower HMM
scores; some were prevalent in, and had sequences characteristic of certain lineages, for example the genera Listeria, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus
(Additional file 1, sheet 2). Infrequently, domains of
identical or near-identical sequence recurred in blocks
(Figure 1B). This was an exception to the highly variable
domain sequences found in most tracts (Figure 1A) and
most likely reflects recent duplications known to expand
repeat protein domains through strand misalignment
during DNA replication [26] or other mechanisms [7].
An additional, distinctive feature observed in a few
ORFs was the separation of blocks of tandem repeats by
various “spacer” sequences unrelated to the repeating
domain. These included short segments sharing similar
sequences, or very long regions of unique sequence
(Figure 1B). Overall, however, the tandem arrangement
of canonical 25-residue units is a hallmark of most
ORFs displaying the motif, hence is a defining attribute
of this set of repeat proteins.
Neighbor-joining trees of taxa containing the HMMdefined motif revealed its distribution among extraordinarily diverse phylogenetic groups (Additional Files 3
and 4). All taxa identified are unicellular microbes
representing two domains of life, Bacteria or Eucaryota,

Page 3 of 20

with the great majority residing in the former. Among
bacteria (Additional File 3), several major groups are
represented, reflecting a wide range of genome sizes and
G+C compositions. Eucaryotic taxa (Additional File 4A)
are currently represented by only two, deeply-separated
lineages belonging to photosynthetic marine microalgae
[27-29]: the primary endosymbiotic Prasinophytes (green
algae), and the secondary endosymbiotic Stramenopiles
(diatoms). In both domains of life, great phylogenetic
distances separate clades that harbor the motif, yet it is
distributed only sporadically within some clades of closely related taxa. This is best illustrated by a set of 891
bacterial and archaeal taxa having fully sequenced and
assembled genomes, scored to indicate the presence or
absence of annotated ORFs bearing the motif (Additional file 5). The motif occurs in only 34 of these bacterial taxa, which are distributed among distant
branches radiating from deeply rooted, higher order
groups. It is represented by only a single taxon in some
broad groups, yet appears selectively in subsets of other
closely related taxa (e.g., among lineages representing
Lactobacillus, Listeria, Helicobacter, Prochlorococcus,
and Mycoplasma). The absence of the motif from genomes of the Archaea is conspicuous, but may simply
reflect the comparatively small sample of complete genome sequences currently available in this branch.
Finally, it is striking that the small (~1 Mb) genomes of
some Mollicutes show an abundance of ORFs containing
the motif (detailed in Additional File 4B); these reside
selectively in the Mycoplasma mycoides phylogenetic
cluster and in a separate branch represented by M. agalactiae (as also noted in a recent survey of DUF285associated ORFs among fully sequenced mycoplasmal
genomes [19]). Overall, these patterns of occurrence
underscore the markedly punctate distribution [30] of
the motif at several phylogenetic levels.
The habitats and lifestyles of motif-containing taxa are
also broad-ranging. For example, among environmental
bacteria are the abundant marine cyanobacteria (Prochlorococcus marinus), extreme hyperhalophiles (Salinibacter ruber), and green sulfur bacteria (Chloroherpeton
thalassium). Parasitic bacteria include human agents
that are pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes), commensal
flora of the gut (Enterococcus faecalis, Coprococcus
eutactus, Eubacterium biforme) and a member of the
newly-described phylum Synergistetes (Jonquetella
anthropi) [31]; as well as animal pathogens (Helicobacter
hepaticus, Mycoplasma spp.) and parasitic organisms of
plants (Mesoplasma florum). The population structures
of these taxa differ markedly as well. Whereas obligate
host parasites typically have small populations subject to
frequent evolutionary bottlenecks [32], some environmental organisms such as the open-ocean prochlorococci have very large populations subject to genome

boxes) within ORFs (rods). Domains of unique sequence (unmarked) or shared identical sequence (similarly-numbered) are indicated. Asterisks (*)
denote non-canonical domains with fewer or more than 25 residues. (A) The most prevalent pattern comprises uninterrupted tracts of tandem
repeats, with each unit having a unique sequence, as represented by two expressed mycoplasmal LPs (LppC and LppQ). (B) Less common

streamlining and reduction [33]. Thus the presence of
the motif in bacteria is not restricted to any particular
phylogenetic group, environmental niche, lifestyle or
population structure. Notably, the photosynthetic eucaryotic taxa harboring the motif are globally dispersed in
marine and other aquatic environments. The diatom
Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and the green algae,
Ostreococcus spp. and Micromonas spp., all have
minimal cellular designs, with single plastids and mitochondria, and include the smallest known eucaryotic
genome (O. tauri). The identification of numerous ORFs
in environmental sequences from the GOS project
(Additional file 2) further indicates that the motif is
richly represented in the marine ecosystem, although
unassigned to taxa. Remarkably, almost none of the
sequences of individual domains in this database (specifically 69 of 11,149 total) had a partner in the nr database with identical sequence, suggesting a high degree
of unexplored sequence variation among the HMM
domains represented in the marine environment.
PARCELs: a family of sequence-variable amphipathic
protein domains encoded by tracts of palindromic
repeats

We sought to determine additional characteristics of the
coding regions corresponding to our HMM as a means
to understand their possible structural or functional
commonalities. Although most are recognized also by
the HMMs DUF285 and TIGR02167 (data not shown),
little else is known about these regions or the ORFs harboring them. These ORFs generally were not assigned
functional categories nor were recognizable housekeeping genes. For example, only nine of the 406 ORFs listed
in Additional file 1 were assigned to COGs, each having
ambiguous or anomalous descriptors (data not shown).
Further classification of ORFs by approaches such as
BLAST was hampered by the nature of the motif, which
displayed variation in the sequences of individual
repeats, and in the length of their tandem arrays. Nevertheless, inspection of several ORFs revealed that the
protein sequences flanking tracts of repeats were often
specific to the ORF. We therefore considered the repeats
as modular regions embedded in different sequence contexts and examined the predicted properties of representative modules per se.
First, a protein sequence logo (Figure 2A) representing the sum of individual motif sequences incorporated into the HMM shows that highly conserved
residues occur periodically at distinctive positions in
the canonical 25-residue repeat, whereas intervening
residues vary greatly, as reflected by their markedly
lower relative frequencies of occurrence at the respective positions of the HMM. These probabilities alone
argue for the structural or functional importance of

Page 5 of 20

the conserved residues [5,34]. Notably, they correspond to amino acids of greater hydrophobicity,
thereby forming a regular pattern of hydrophobic residues extending throughout tandem arrays of the motif
(Figure 2A). Sequence-based predictions of secondary
structure revealed recurring regions of helicity in
tracts of the repeating sequence from diverse sources
(data not shown), a feature also described in the prototype LppQ and LppC proteins of Mmm SC [15,16].
Most striking, however, were helical wheel projections
of several representative tracts (Figure 2B-H) that
revealed the strongly amphipathic character of these
sequences, resulting from the asymmetric recurrence
of conserved hydrophobic residues on one side of a
helix. Amino acids at the variable positions, interspersed among the hydrophobic residues (Figure 2A),
were more generally hydrophilic, consistent with their
predicted interactions with polar environments. These
characteristic amphipathic helical projections were
common among 25-residue repeat units, they could be
demonstrated using different phases of a repeated
sequence, and they extended over the boundaries of
adjacent repeats (Figure 2B-H). The strong amphipathic character associated with tracts of canonical
domains was also confirmed by hydrophobic cluster
analysis [35] of representative ORFs. Occasionally,
hydrophobic residues at non-conserved positions
affected the degree of amphipathicity. Structuredisrupting proline residues also occurred in some
tracts of the motif, yet were often accommodated in
amphipathic helical projections (Figure 2E). Not surprisingly, however, tracts with disrupted repeat patterns
(for example, with contiguous non-canonical domains,
or with gaps between canonical domains) also displayed
corresponding interruptions in this secondary structure
prediction (data not shown).
In the absence of experimental confirmation or bone
fide models of a 3 D structure for any protein containing this HMM repeat motif, we speculate that the
tandemly repeated domains may confer characteristics
common to analogous helical repeat proteins with
similar sequence features. Such proteins can display
striking, extended architectures, resulting from the
interactions of independently-acting domains forming
modular scaffolded structures [2,5,36,37]. The strongly
conserved amphipathic character of the HMM repeat
motif described here is consistent with a comparable
role that could mediate intra- or inter-molecular interactions, either with partnering domains or through the
formation of complexes with other ligands [2,38,39].
Because increased numbers of tandem domains can
dramatically augment structural or functional complexity by expanding the folding pathways available in
repeat proteins [36,37], the large numbers of repeats in

many HMM motif-containing ORFs could offer extensive ensembles of interacting domains. We observed
that HMM-defined domains did not encode transmembrane (TM) segments, nor did we find evidence
for in-plane membrane anchor motifs [40] or other
targeting signals in several examples analyzed. While
we surmise that the domains do not independently
mediate membrane interactions, their contribution to
membrane-associated configurations, such as multidomain trans-membrane channels, cannot be formally
ruled out. Notwithstanding the need to resolve structures of the repeating domain in order to explore these
possibilities, one clear hallmark predicted from
sequence analysis is the strong amphipathic character
of these regions. Importantly, this structured characteristic underscores their fundamental difference from a
separate class of repeat proteins in which short,
tandemly arrayed sequences predict intrinsically
unstructured products [41,42]. It is noteworthy that
such unstructured repeats occur in some families of
surface proteins expressed in mycoplasmal taxa that
also harbor ORFs with the HMM-defined repeat we
report here [43].
A second hallmark of the HMM-defined domains is
their high degree of protein sequence diversity, manifest
in the hydrophilic amino acids interspersed between
conserved hydrophobic residues (Figure 2A). Comparison of each individual domain sequence retrieved from
the nr protein sequence database with all others
retrieved from that database revealed extensive sequence
diversity; 76.7% (2935 of 3825 total domains) had
unique sequences. Sequence variation among domains
within single ORFs was also striking, with the great
majority representing tracts in which each domain
represents a unique sequence (illustrated in Figure 1A).
While the consequences of this sequence variability are
unknown, it could reflect functional attributes of corresponding translation products, such as the diversity of
ligand binding demonstrated in some repeat proteins
with analogous characteristics [5,34]. The conserved secondary structure of HMM-defined motifs suggests an
evolutionary history that preserved this common aspect,
whereas diversification of more polar residues could
represent the selection of distinct (unknown) advantages, or the mere accrual of “neutral” mutations that
retain the structural integrity of domains. In either case,
their combined sequence variability and structural modularity offers a highly adaptive conjectural framework
for the acquisition of multiple biological roles.
In addition to these striking features of the repeating
protein sequences, we also found that the underlying
sequences encoding these HMM-defined domains consistently displayed repeating elements with dyad symmetry. Searches for statistically-defined palindromic motifs

Page 7 of 20

[44] in DNA sequences encoding tracts of the domains
revealed a variety of such regions, corresponding to the
tandemly repeated canonical protein sequence of the
HMM (Figure 3; Table 1). This feature was present in
ORFs from diverse phylogenetic groups and environmental niches. The exact palindromic motif calculated
for a particular ORF, or from datasets representing
multiple ORFs, varied in sequence, length and phasing,
relative to the repeating protein domain (Figure 3; Table
1, Additional file 6). Some palindromic regions recurred
with the same period as that of the HMM (Figure 3A),
whereas others spanned repeating block patterns corresponding to multiple HMM domains (Figure 3B). To
verify these statistically derived patterns, multiple randomizations of input DNA sequences were shown to
completely ablate the palindromic motifs, thereby ruling
out a random occurrence in these coding sequences
(data not shown). As a frame of reference using known
repeats with dyad symmetry, we applied the same methods to derive motifs from well-characterized CRISPR
repeat sequences [45-47]. As expected, the resulting
motifs corresponded in location and sequence to the
respective palindromic DR repeats in the CRISPR
regions examined (Figure 3C; Additional file 6 sheet 2).
The palindromic motifs derived from repeat sequences
encoding HMM domains (and the actual sequences
from which they were statistically generated) represented imperfect dyad symmetries, as do many CRISPR
repeats [45,46,48]. Furthermore, as anticipated, they
matched the corresponding authentic sequences encoding HMM domains with a range of scores (E-values)
analogous to those obtained by matching CRISPRderived palindromic motifs with their corresponding
authentic sequences (see Additional file 6).
The overall significance of the palindromy in the coding
sequences of HMM-defined domains, whether in extant
taxa or in their evolutionary antecedents, is not clear.
Interestingly, because tandemly repeated palindromes of
like sequence can in principle form extended palindromic regions (Figure 3D), long tracts of these repeats
may assume numerous configurations, potentially
endowing single strand regions of DNA or RNA with
properties that could influence gene expression, mobilization or other interactions with host genomes that
have been implicated both for non-coding [45,46,48]
and protein-coding [49-54] palindromic elements. However, mutational diversification of these protein coding
sequences over time may have diminished more pronounced dyad symmetry in ancestral precursors, particularly if palindromy per se was not a selected trait.
Moreover, while domains with distinctive protein
sequences (Additional file 1, sheet 2) or codon usage
patters (see final section of Results and Discussion)
appear to dominate some lineages, meaningful

DNA sequences of PARCEL-containing ORFs from several representative sources were analyzed for the occurrence of palindromic motifs as described in Methods.
The derived sequences and features of palindrome motifs that correspond to the canonical HMM-defined repeat pattern are described. Additional details are
shown in Additional file 6.

comparison and interpretation of the underlying DNA
sequences may be challenging, due to differences in the
genomic context (e.g., G+C content and codon usage
biases affecting wobble positions) and the multiple
mechanisms available for propagation of particular sets
of coding regions (e.g., reiterations within in tandem
arrays vs. acquisition, duplication or recombination of
ORFs.) Regardless of its ultimate source or function, the
underlying dyad symmetry associated with coding
regions of the HMM protein domain is a central aspect
of this repeating pattern, and is incorporated into the
PARCEL descriptor that we employ hereafter.
PARCEL domains add diversity to membrane proteins

The expression of PARCEL-containing proteins was first
established for LppQ and LppC [15,16], two surface LPs
from a single mycoplasmal taxon represented by the
type strain Mmm SC PG1 [RefSeq: NC_005364] [55], of
the M. mycoides cluster. We therefore exploited recent
genomic sequences and proteomic data from a second

species of this group, M. capricolum subsp. capricolum
strain Kid (Mcc Kid) [RefSeq: NC_007633], in order to
evaluate the role of PARCELs in diversifying the surface
protein repertoires in this group of animal pathogens.
These two taxa (i) are very close phylogenetic relatives
[17,18] with genomes showing marked synteny and gene
orthology [56], (ii) include the greatest number and
diversity of PARCEL-containing ORFs in any single
taxon (Mcc Kid; see Additional file 7) and (iii) express
additional families of phase-variable repeat proteins that
are structurally and antigenically distinct [43,57,58]. We
earlier established a partial “membrane proteome” of
Mcc Kid using nanoflow capillary LC-MS/MS to identify
and map tryptic peptides (generated from a membrane
protein-enriched fraction of the organism) to their corresponding genomic sequences [43]. Extending preliminary observations reported from those studies, we
confirm here that at least four PARCEL-containing LPs
are expressed by this organism: MCAP_0268,
MCAP_0704, MCAP_0720, and MCAP_0721 (denoted

Röske et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:430
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/430

in Additional file 7). Peptides corresponding to unique
sequences throughout these ORFs, including PARCEL
domains, verified the expression of full-length translation products (Additional file 8). Consistent with their
presence in detergent-phase preparations, each product
was encoded as a pre-protein containing a lipobox that
predicts LP processing [59], with the mature protein
ultimately anchored in the single plasma membrane.
Consequently we compared these expressed products of
Mcc Kid with LppQ and LppC of Mmm SC PG1, in
order to document possible variation between the two
taxa manifest in these six surface proteins.
BLASTp comparisons (of regions outside PARCEL
tracts and cleaved SP regions) indicated that
MCAP_0268 and MCAP_0704 of Mcc Kid were distinct
from one another, and had no counterparts in Mmm SC
PG1. Similarly, LppQ (MSC_1021) and LppC
(MSC_1005) [55] were each distinct and were selectively
present in Mmm SC PG1. Contrasting these unique LPs
were the expressed LPs MCAP_0720 and MCAP_0721.
These represented adjacent in-paralogs with high
sequence similarity, which was also shared by one predicted PARCEL-containing ORF (MSC_0773) in Mmm
SC PG1 [55]. In this context, as modules embedded in
orthologous or non-orthologous framework sequences,
PARCELs contributed directly to the sequence variability of expressed surface proteins. Notably, each of the 42
individual PARCEL domains represented in these six
verified translation products had a unique sequence
(data not shown).
These findings formally demonstrate expression of a
new family of surface LPs representing taxon-specific
variants that distinguish members of the M. mycoides
cluster. Although the full ramifications of PARCEL
domain repeats in these proteins are not determined,
LppQ and LppC are known to be prominent surface
antigens of Mmm SC. Interestingly, in both cases the
dominant B cell epitopes recognized in the natural host
reside outside tracts of PARCEL motifs [15,16]. We
speculate that the domain architecture could affect
either the proper recognition, or immunogenicity, of
these repeat regions. Regarding their role as surface proteins, it is noteworthy that some PARCEL-containing
ORFs in Mcc Kid (denoted in Additional file 7) display
adjunct features shared by other phase-variable membrane protein families expressed from this genome [43]
and the genome of Mmm SC PG1 [55,57,58]. Specifically, contingency loci comprising homopolymeric or
dinucleotide VNTRs reside in the 5’ flanking regions of
some PARCEL-containing ORFs encoding LPs (including the LP expressed from MCAP_0268) and other
membrane proteins. The occurrence of PARCEL
sequences in genes encoding phase-variable surface
membrane proteins, governed by modular contingency

Page 10 of 20

loci, may reflect promiscuous co-opting of the domain
for adaptive variation by these organisms.
A very recent study of transposon insertional mutants
of M. agalactiae [60] has implicated the products of two
PARCEL-containing ORFs (among diverse other ORFs)
in adaptation of that organisms to growth in cell culture
[60]. Our manual curation of those ORFs (MAG1330
and MAG3260) [RefSeq: NC_009497] suggests that they
encode LPs containing a homopolymeric (poly G)
VNTR tract in the N-terminal coding region that could
be subject to phase variable expression through frameshift mutation. A second study by this group [61]
directly documents the expression of two other PARCEL-containing LPs in the same organism (MAG64080/
MAG6490 and MAG2430). These and our studies collectively offer evidence that PARCEL ORFs contribute
to the adaptive strategies of the two mycoplasmal
lineages harboring significant genomic repertoires of
these ORFs. While an adaptive role has been previously
inferred for PARCEL-containing ORFs based on these
large repertoires per se [19], we caution against this general notion by comparing Mesoplasma florum, a plant
pathogen and the closest ancestral relative of the M.
mycoides cluster having a complete genome sequence
(Additional file 4B). This organism harbors only one
PARCEL-containing ORF, encoding a bitopic membrane
protein (Figure 4, category B). Offering only a limited
potential for diversification, this example highlights the
possibility that more specific roles are associated with
these repeat domains in some types of membrane
proteins.
To examine more generally the spectrum of PARCELcontaining ORFs with membrane-targeting sequences,
we surveyed a selection of taxa having fully sequenced
genomes. Figure 4 illustrates representative inventories
from diverse organisms interrogated with our HMM,
showing that repeats occur in several categories of integral membrane proteins with monotopic or various multitopic configurations. These ORFs were broadly
categorized by signature sequences marking bacterial
LPs (characterized by lipobox processing motifs in their
SPs [59,59], or TM sequences (found in all taxa, and
including other SPs that effect membrane translocation
regardless of subsequent cleavage [62,63]). In all such
ORFs examined, PARCEL domains resided on one side
of the membrane. Most were predicted to lie on the
external face, but are not depicted as such due to the
known ambiguity of sequence-based predictive algorithms [62]. Individual genomes varied greatly in the
number and types of PARCEL-containing ORFs present
(Figure 4), ranging from one ORF in many taxa, to a
multitude in others such as Mcc Kid and Mmm SC
PG1, ironically among the smallest. Some genomes
encoded multiple types of membrane proteins carrying

Figure 4 Representative genomic inventories and predicted topologies of membrane proteins containing PARCEL domains. Inventories
of PARCEL-containing ORFs in the genomes of taxa listed at the left are shown. The total ORFs per genome, and the number representing
various categories of membrane protein (A-G) or lacking membrane-targeting sequences (H) are indicated. Cartoons show the locations of
PARCEL domain tracts (tandemly arrayed red boxes) relative to the N- and C-termini of the respective ORFs (rods), and to the plasma membrane
(bilayers represented by parallel planes). Topologies include: (A) monotopic bacterial LP, anchored by N-terminal lipid modification; (B and C)
bitopic TM proteins of different orientations; (D-G) polytopic proteins with two (D-F) or more (G) TM segments. Topology (B) includes proteins
with predicted SPs (other than LPs). Topology (G) represents proteins with any number (> 2) of TM domains. Locations of PARCEL domains in
ORFs are not to scale and depict only their positions relative to the features shown. The inside or outside of the membrane is not indicated
although PARCEL domains were most often predicted to lie outside.

the motifs. Even the single, or few PARCEL-containing
ORFs in some genomes displayed significant sequence
variation among individual domains (data not shown).
Overall, the variety of encoded membrane proteins harboring PARCEL sequences argues for a prominent and
varied role in this context, possibly reflecting processes
specific to particular organisms. One noteworthy group
of these ORFs lacked membrane targeting sequences,
however (Figure 4, category H). These typically occurred
in genomes along with ORFs having such signals.
Whether these “untargeted” ORFs represent pseudogenes, encoded translation products destined for cytoplasmic compartments, or truncated artifacts from
automated annotation is not known.
PARCELs are subject to HGT and intra-genomic
mobilization

The variable sequences and numbers of repeats in PARCEL-containing ORFs hampers analysis of HGT using
orthology to compare their phylogenetic congruence
with the organisms harboring them [64]. Nevertheless,
by comparing the genome sequences of related organisms within assorted phylogenetic clades, we discovered
markedly different repertoires and intra-genomic distributions of PARCEL-containing ORFs. Moreover, in
some genomes these ORFs were exclusively associated
with mobility elements. The following examples from
eucaryotes and bacteria illustrate these features, which
support the notion that PARCEL sequences are in flux,
both among and within genomes.
The chromosomes and organelles of all known eucaryotic taxa containing PARCEL sequences (Additional
file 4A) have been fully sequenced and the genomes
extensively compared, revealing for each taxon a history
of exogenous gene acquisition that has driven speciation
and diversification [65-69]. Genome sequences from the
Stramenopiles include two diatoms, Phaeodactylum tricornutum [67] and Thalassiosira pseudonana [69]. We
identified six PARCEL-containing ORFs in P. tricornutum, each on a different chromosome, and none in T.
pseudonana. The former belongs to a more recentlydiverged group (pennates), thought to be extensively
diversified by the acquisition of exogenous genes, and
by rearrangements mediated by the retrotransposon elements prevalent in the genome [67]. This study applied
orthology searches that identified hundreds of genes in
each genome belonging to “bacterial” lineages, prompting speculation that massive and successive uptakes of
bacterial genes occurred very early, before their divergence (bacterial genes shared by these taxa) and subsequently by each taxon (bacterial genes unique to one or
the other). Parenthetically, only one PARCEL-containing
ORF [GenBank: EEC50352.1] was listed in the inventory
of “bacterial” genes of P. tricornutum [67], possibly

Page 12 of 20

underscoring the shortcomings of orthology in the classification of PARCELs. Overall, this macro-scale comparison shows a striking difference in PARCEL content,
and a distribution of these ORFs consistent with their
selective acquisition, subsequent mobilization and propagation within a genome. That chloroplast or mitchondrial genomes of these organisms [67] lacked PARCELs
offers no support for the direct transfer between organelle and host chromosomes, but is consistent with an
exogenous source for these sequences.
A second eucaryotic clade, Mamiellales, includes two
closely related species, Ostreococcus tauri and O. lucimarinus (Additional file 4A), reflecting early speciation
events in the green algal lineage [65,66]. Of 20 chromosomes in O. tauri (comprising the smallest known
eucaryotic genome) and 21 in O. lucimarinus, 18 show
strong synteny between the species and consequently
define pairs (Table 2). Additional unpaired chromosomes in each organism are thought to be acquired exogenously, as is one highly rearranged and distinctive
chromosome (Chx 2), present in both [66]. Several PARCEL-containing ORFs of various predicted membrane
topologies occurred in both genomes (Figure 4) but
were distributed in very distinctive patterns among the
respective chromosomes (Table 2), showing (i) the selective presence of some ORFs on a paired chromosome of
one species versus the other and (ii) the presence of
ORFs on all chromosomes predicted to be of exogenous
origin. These features support the notion that PARCELcontaining ORFs were mobilized, and prompt speculation that they were introduced during the predicted
HGT events that shape these genomes. Further dispersal
in the genome could have ensued, perhaps in part
through the action of transposon elements that abound
also in these taxa [65,66]. Again, no PARCEL sequence
was found in the mitochondrial or chloroplast genomes
of these organisms, nor in the recently-reported genome
of one virus known to infect O. tauri [70]. Finally, the
genome sequences of two related taxa from a separate
branch of Mamiellales, Micromonas isolates RCC299
and CCMP1545 (Additional file 4A), have recently been
reported [68]. We identified 17 PARCEL-containing
ORFs in the former, distributed on 6 different chromosomes, and 8 such ORFs in the latter (not assigned to
chromosomes). These taxa share only 90% of their
genes and are considered more divergent than ostreococcal species, as a consequence of gene acquisitions
that selectively expanded unique repertoires in each
organism [68].
In bacteria, the completed and fully assembled genome sequences from multiple taxa revealed a selective
distribution of PARCELs among the members of particular lineages, for example among subgrouops of Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Tenericutes (Additional files 3,

4B and 5). A striking example is found (Additional file
5) in the genomes of a tight cluster representing the
cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus. Of twelve
fully sequenced isolates, only two (MIT 9215 and MIT
9301) contained PARCEL sequences, with each harboring a single PARCEL-containing ORF encoding a bitopic
TM protein (Figure 4, category B). These ORFs have
significant sequence similarity and comparable organization of PARCEL tracts. Modest sequence differences
within and outside PARCEL domains reveal only limited
divergence. However, each ORF resides in a completely
different genomic location, devoid of apparent mobility
genes. These findings are most consistent with the selective acquisition of a PARCEL-containing ORF by these
taxa or their close ancestor, and/or further mobilization
in the genome. The alternative scenario, involving the
selective loss of common ancestral orthologs by the ten
other isolates, cannot be formally ruled out but is considerably less likely.
That PARCEL-containing ORFs can be mobilized and
are subject to HGT was further evidenced in the

complete genome sequences of some bacteria where
they reside exclusively within mobility elements. In one
case, the single such ORF in the genome of Salinibacter
ruber [71] occurs on the unique plasmid of that organism, pSR35 (35,505 bp) [RefSeq: NC_007678], along
with 31 other ORFs. This ORF (SRU_p0003) [RefSeq:
YP_446962.1] encodes a bitopic TM protein (Figure 4,
category B) with a possible SP sequence. It contains a
tract of 12 PARCEL domains predicted to lie external to
the plasma membrane. The sequence of each domain is
unique, compared to others within this ORF and to all
others in the nr database (determined by BLAST). The
plasmid encodes a transposase of the IS5 type, different
from the IS1 type encoded on the single S. ruber chromosome. Parenthetically, this environmental hyperhalophile is reported to exchange genetic information with
haloarchaea that share its extreme habitat [71]; to date
no available archaeal genome sequence has revealed
PARCEL domains (Additional file 5). In a second case,
the single PARCEL-containing ORF in the genome of
the soil bacterium Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6,

resides on the larger of two plasmids in that organism,
pACHL01 (426,858 bp) [RefSeq: NC_011879] along with
553 other ORFs. This ORF (Achl_4487) [RefSeq:
YP_002478255.1] predicts a TM protein (possibly with
SP sequence) of similar topology to that found in S.
ruber. It contains a tract of 4 PARCEL domains, each
again having a unique sequence. Together these examples (i) confirm that PARCEL motifs of two environmental bacteria from disparate lineages and habitats are
exclusively associated with distinctive extrachromosomal
replicons and (ii) directly identify vehicles that could
mobilize specific PARCEL sequences.
Comparison of the closely-related genomes of Mcc Kid
and Mmm SC PG1 also revealed a subset of PARCELcontaining ORFs selectively associated with large mobility elements. These genomes harbor a total of 42 and
29 PARCEL-containing ORFs, respectively (Figure 4;
Additional file 7), distributed throughout their chromosomes (Figure 5A). Many of these ORFs reside at the
same locus in each genome; others occur selectively in
one or the other, as single ORFs or tandemly organized
paralogs occupying sites that are “empty” in the opposite
genome (Figure 5B). Typically these sites are in regions
of housekeeping genes, or near IS elements that extensively populate the Mmm SC PG1 genome [55]. A striking exception to this pattern is the clustering of several
PARCEL-containing ORFs within two large islands in
the Mcc Kid genome, Tra I and Tra II (Figure 5C).
Described in part previously [72] and annotated in the
genome sequence [73], these islands represent a newlyrecognized class of element, containing ORFs that
resemble mobility genes that are clearly different from
those identified in other integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) [74] annotated and described in Mcc Kid
[19,73] and in other mycoplasmas [75-77]. Tra I and
Tra II harbor 15 and 5 PARCEL-containing ORFs,
respectively (Additional file 7), together accounting for
the larger inventory of these ORFs in the Mcc Kid genome over that of Mmm SC (see also Figure 5). One
intriguing aspect of the PARCEL-containing ORFs associated with these Tra elements is the marked absence of
membrane-targeting signatures from many (Figure 5C),
a feature (confirmed by manual curation) that distinguishes them from most others in the genome (Additional file 7). Moreover, some of these ORFs
(particularly in Tra I) are organized in tandem, have
similar orientations, and share a characteristic sequence
motif outside tracts of PARCEL domains that further
sets them apart (motif is described in Additional file 7).
The unique configuration and character of these ORFs
support speculation that at least some were acquired
with the elements. Interestingly, individual PARCEL

Page 15 of 20

domains in these “untargeted” ORFs display significant
sequence diversity. Whether or not they are transcribed
or translated, these ORFs are reservoirs containing variant PARCEL coding sequences that could be exploited
through recombination with other expressed ORFs in
the genome.
No Tra island or ICE in mycoplasmas has been
directly shown to mediate conjugative transfer, however
some (including Tra II) are known to exist in extrachromosomal forms and to integrate at multiple chromosomal sites [72,75,76]. Overall, these findings strongly
implicate these large elements in the acquisition and
mobilization of PARCEL-containing ORFs in the M.
mycoides cluster. A recent comparison of genomes from
two strains of M. agalactiae [61] has revealed a dynamic
role of analogous large mobile elements in shuffling
PARCEL-containing ORFs in that species. Events mediating the introduction, duplication, loss or reshuffling
of PARCEL-containing ORFs in these genomes appears
to be complex. In the two members of the M. mycoides
cluster examined, for example, no evidence of Tra II,
and only a remnant of Tra I, was found in the Mmm
SC PG1 genome (Figure 5A). In addition, the boundaries of Tra II indicate its precise insertion into a preexisting PARCEL-containing ORF encoding a TM protein, now annotated as MCAP_0166 and MCAP_0188,
corresponding to the disrupted N- and C-terminal portions of the gene, respectively (Figure 5C; Additional file
7). Multiple incursions of these elements have clearly
shaped the PARCEL content of genomes during the
divergence of subspecies within the M. mycoides cluster.
On the other hand, some PARCEL-containing ORFs
may pre-date this repertoire expansion, and their
exchanges among taxa of this group, as evidenced by
their presence also in M. florum. This is a commensal
mycoplasma of the same phylogenetic heritage (Additional file 4B), which is found on lemon tree flowers, a
completely separate environmental compartment.
PARCELs are exogenously derived from the mobilome

The apparently random distribution of PARCELs among
disparate phylogenetic groups and environments is most
easily reconciled with transmission by various forms of
HGT, now known to occur among unicellular organisms
from all three domains of life [27,67,78-80], While no
single origin, nor direct evidence for the transfer
between diverse phylogenetic clades can be demonstrated for PARCEL-containing ORFs, their selective
association with distinctive mobility elements in particular clades argues that subsets were likely introduced and
fixed into lineages, due in part to the restricted host
ranges of most vehicles. This notion is further supported

Röske et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:430
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/430

by the independent observation of clade-specific features
that are affiliated with some groups of PARCELs. Most
notably, Mollicutes utilize UGA as a Trp codon rather
than a translation termination signal and show a strong
bias for this codon over the alternative UGG (Trp) [81].
We confirmed this extreme bias in PARCEL sequences
of Mollicutes, wherein UGA nearly always encodes the
highly conserved Trp residue (Figure 2) in the first position of the motif (data not shown). This implies that an
ancient subset of PARCELs was irreversibly fixed in
Mollicutes (Additional file 4B), concurrent with the evolution of its distinctive codon usage. As a corollary, this
also argues indirectly that the conserved Trp residue
and associated domain structure may have been a
selected trait of PARCEL sequences during their acquisition and exploitation in particular clades of Mollicutes.
From a genome-centric perspective, the ultimate exogenous source of PARCEL sequences is elusive. They
are perhaps best viewed as components of the vast array
of mobile genetic information that is conveyed among
select microbial communities by gene-centric mechanisms [78,82-84]. They clearly contribute to the “accessory gene” pools that distinguish individual taxa and
contribute to the “pan-genomes” of related organisms
[10,11]. PARCELs have markedly expanded the pan-genome of the M. mycoides cluster, with some genomes
reflecting extensive colonization, despite their reduction
in size [81].
Our study documents the widespread mobilization of
ORFs containing tandem arrays of PARCEL domains,
consistent with their ultimate dissemination by HGT
and intra-genomic propagation. However, the palindromic nature of the DNA sequences encoding PARCEL
domains is also noteworthy per se, in regard to their
possible origins, propagation, and properties in tandem
arrays. Of the many palindromic sequences found
among procaryotic genomes [85], some specialized subsets represent exogenous protein coding sequences integrated into assorted housekeeping genes of intracellular
bacterial parasites including Rickettsia [51,54] and Wolbachia [50] as well as the archaeon Methanocaldococcus
jannaschii [49]. These stand-alone, “selfish” coding elements appear to be in-frame insertions of several
codons, introduced at assorted positions typically
located in non-structured segments of globular proteins
[51]. By extension of such findings, the insertion and
subsequent propagation of palindromic coding
sequences is proposed to be an important mechanism
for de novo evolution and diversification of proteins
[52,53]. The dyad symmetry of PARCEL coding
sequences could reflect an ancient property (possibly
diminished over time by sequence divergence) that was

Page 16 of 20

instrumental in their original introduction into assorted
ORFs. An interesting feature predicted for progenitor
palindromic coding sequences is the presence of overlapping ORFs on the opposite strand [52]; this characteristic is found in many (but not all) PARCEL coding
regions (data not shown). The palindromic motifs
detected in PARCEL coding sequences show considerable variation in predicted energies of stem-loop formation, consensus sequences and boundaries, resembling
the analogous variations reported in subclasses of the
elements referenced [49-51,54]. However, protein
sequences in PARCEL tracts differ in several ways,
including their tandem repetition, conserved amphipathic secondary structure, association with membrane
proteins and occurrence in genes of unknown function.
Hence these regions represent a newly-described class
of palindromic coding sequence.

Conclusions
We characterize a widely dispersed, versatile repeating
protein domain and coding sequence, for which we
recommend the moniker “PARCEL” (Palindromic
Amphipathic Repeat Coding ELement) to describe its
distinguishing and generalized features. Because the
HMM used to define this motif identifies regions generally corresponding to those recognized by HMMs
DUF285 (IPR005046) and TIGR02167 (IPR011889), the
attributes we ascribe also apply to those motifs. Tandem
repeats of the protein motif are predicted to form modular domains with potentially diverse folding pathways,
and display highly variable hydrophilic sequences. Both
features provide a plasticity that could endow diverse
biological functions in this newly-characterized class of
repeat proteins and coding sequences. Our findings support the following scenarios to explain the dissemination
and deployment of PARCELs among extant genomes: (i)
PARCEL-containing ORFs have been stochastically distributed among phylogenetic groups by multiple vehicles, possibly as expressed ORFs or as coding reservoirs
and (ii) they propagated and evolved within some genomes through further mobilization, rearrangement, gene
duplication and decay, (iii) they are prevalent in membrane-targeted proteins and may provide selective
advantages in that context, either through a conserved
domain structure or their extensive sequence variability
(possibly generated prior to acquisition or through ensuing mutation) and (iv) clade-specific subsets of the elements helped diversify the surface protein repertoire in
specific lineages of at least one bacterial group (Mollicutes). The dynamic nature of PARCELs conforms most
readily to the concept of a mobilome [78], a network of
genomic nodes connected by mobilization of genetic

Röske et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:430
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/430

information through multiple pathways within shared
habitats. In this regard PARCELs are emblematic of
repetitive protein motifs whose origins and distribution
should be examined in the context of gene flux.

Methods
Hidden Markov model and interrogation of databases

The HMMER package [20] was used to construct the
profile HMM and to search protein sequence databases.
The HMM is provided in Additional file 9. Searches of
the nr and env_nr databases were performed with an Evalue ≤ 1. ORFs identified by the HMM were subsequently searched for COGs through the NCBI resource
[24]. To inventory all ORFs in a representative taxon,
the corresponding annotated genome sequence was
individually searched with the HMM. A logo representing the HMM was generated as described in [86], using
relative entropy to indicate the prevalence of amino acid
residues at each position.
Phylogenetic tree construction

A phylogenetic tree based on 16 S small-subunit rRNA
gene sequences of bacterial taxa harbouring PARCELcontaining ORFs was constructed using resources available through the Ribosomal Database Project (rdp) [87].
Sequences were aligned using rdp’s aligner [88,89] and a
distance matrix was generated using the Jukes-Cantor
corrected distance model [87]. The tree was created
with rdp’s Tree Builder, using Weighbor, a weighted
version of Neighbor Joining [90]. The calculated trees
were further refined using the program MEGA version
4.0 [91].
A phylogenetic tree based on the 18 S small-subunit
rRNA gene sequences of eucaryotic taxa harboring PARCEL-containing ORFs, or representing other diverse
groups, was generated using the program MEGA version
4.0 [91]. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW and the
phylogenetic tree was subsequently constructed using
the neighbor-joining method [92], Maximum Composite
Likelihood [93] correction, and 1000 bootstraps.
A phylogenetic tree based on the 16 S small-subunit
rRNA gene sequences of bacteria and archaea having
fully sequenced and assembled genomes was generated
using Infernal [94] to align sequences of each group and
MUSCLE [95] to merge the two alignments to produce
a combined alignment. This alignment was used to construct a maximum likelihood tree using RAxML [96].
Sequence analyses

Nucleotide and protein sequence comparisons were performed, respectively, using BLASTn (without filter) and
BLASTp software available through NCBI [24]. ORFs
were examined and curated using Artemis version 7

Page 17 of 20

[97]. Comparisons of genomes and regional sequences
were made with BLASTn output files visualized in ACT
version 4 [98] with a default setting of 100 nt as the
minimum window for displayed matches. Protein
sequences were analyzed with multiple tools available
through Biology WorkBench [99], including secondary
structure predictions using the PELE suite of programs,
alignments using ClustalW, and membrane topologies
using TMHMM2.0 (scoring TM regions with probabilities > 0.2). LP signal peptides were identified by lipobox
search patterns described elsewhere [59] and available
through InterPro [22]. Additional protein sequencebased predictions included helical wheel projections
[100,101] using whole-residue interface hydrophobicity
scales [102], hydrophobic cluster analysis [35] and inplane membrane anchor analysis [40]. Other protein
motifs and 3 D structural predictions associated with
PARCEL- or DUF285-containing ORFs were evaluated
through the InterPro resource [22]. A protein motif
associated with subsets of PARCEL-containing ORFs
associated with mobility elements was generated using
MEME [44] and used to query ORFs by BLASTp. The
uniqueness or identities of individual motif sequences in
the nr or nr_env data sets were determined by comparing each sequence shown in Additional files 1 or 2
(sheets2) with all others in each dataset. Features of
some genomes and ORFs were acquired through NCBI
or the DOE Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial
Genomes resource [103].
Palindrome analysis

Palindromic motifs in DNA sequences were identified
using MEME (version 3.5.7) [44], with default settings
for palindromes only, and limits of 6 nt (minimum) and
300 nt (maximum) for the motifs recovered. Palidromic
motifs < 10 nt in length were excluded as background.
Input datasets for these analyses included the entire
DNA sequences of individual ORFs or, where noted, a
set of multiple ORFs. Multiple, randomly shuffled input
DNA sequences were used as negative controls. CRISPR
sequences used as positive controls were obtained and
analyzed through the CRISPRdb database [47].
Proteomics

The generation of tryptic fragments from detergent
phase-fractionated proteins of Mcc Kid, LC-MS/MS
techniques and mapping of tryptic peptides to ORFs
encoded by the Mcc Kid genome sequence have been
described in detail elsewhere [43]. In addition to
SEQUEST [104] analysis (Thermo Finnigan; Bioworks
v3.1), X!Tandem analysis was also performed [105], and
peptide and protein probabilities were calculated using
ProteinProphet [106] with SEQUEST results.
