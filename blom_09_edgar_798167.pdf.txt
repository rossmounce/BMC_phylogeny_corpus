Abstract
Background: The introduction of next generation sequencing approaches has caused a rapid
increase in the number of completely sequenced genomes. As one result of this development, it is
now feasible to analyze large groups of related genomes in a comparative approach. A main task in
comparative genomics is the identification of orthologous genes in different genomes and the
classification of genes as core genes or singletons.
Results: To support these studies EDGAR – "Efficient Database framework for comparative
Genome Analyses using BLAST score Ratios" – was developed. EDGAR is designed to
automatically perform genome comparisons in a high throughput approach. Comparative analyses
for 582 genomes across 75 genus groups taken from the NCBI genomes database were conducted
with the software and the results were integrated into an underlying database. To demonstrate a
specific application case, we analyzed ten genomes of the bacterial genus Xanthomonas, for which
phylogenetic studies were awkward due to divergent taxonomic systems. The resultant phylogeny
EDGAR provided was consistent with outcomes from traditional approaches performed recently
and moreover, it was possible to root each strain with unprecedented accuracy.
Conclusion: EDGAR provides novel analysis features and significantly simplifies the comparative
analysis of related genomes. The software supports a quick survey of evolutionary relationships and
simplifies the process of obtaining new biological insights into the differential gene content of
kindred genomes. Visualization features, like synteny plots or Venn diagrams, are offered to the
scientific community through a web-based and therefore platform independent user interface http:/
/edgar.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de, where the precomputed data sets can be browsed.

Background
The mid fifties produced a rather pragmatic definition of
the term species, described as a group of cultures or strains
which is accepted by bacteriologists as sufficiently closely
related [1]. About thirty years later a more fundamental
proposition of the term [2] considered measurable quantities including strains' DNA molecules reassociation values and phenotypic traits. However, in recent times, these
classical approaches are likely to be outdated by future
deductions which may be taken from the increasing collection of genomic information.
Especially methods of pyrosequencing have the undisputed potential to yield huge amounts of genomic
sequence information in relatively short time spans.
Unsurprisingly, the number of complete genomes being
published is rapidly increasing (see http://www.genomes
online.org).
As a consequence, one may ask if the genetic variability of
a species can be described using only one single strain. A
closer look at numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence
apparently negates this question, such as the comparison
of the well known Escherichia coli strain K12 and its relative O157:H7 revealed 1387 genes to be specific to a certain strain, or the comparison of 17 Streptococcus
pneumoniae strains by Hiller et al., where the clustering of
similar genes revealed clusters exclusive to one or some
strains. Interestingly even isolates taken at nearby locations from patients with similar symptoms showed divergent genotypes [3].
Inspired by the Greek word "pan" for "whole", Tettelin et
al. shaped the idea of the pan genome [4]. Using wholegenome shotgun sequencing, they gained genomic information of six strains of Streptococcus agalactiae. In comparison with two additional publicly available genomes of
the major pathogenic serotype of Streptococcus agalactiae,
called group B Streptococcus (GBS), they found a significant amount of genes not being shared among the compared strains. Their discoveries led to the definition of the
pan-genome constituting that "a bacterial species can be
described by its pan-genome, which is composed of a
'core genome' [&#x22C3;] and a 'dispensable genome' ".
Furthermore, a differentiation between open and closed
pan-genomes has been introduced by Medini et al. [5].
While for example the genomes of Buchnera aphidicola
showed almost no gene rearrangements (lateral exchange)
and therefore its pan-genome is denominated as closed
[6], the compared strains of Streptococcus agalactiae form
an open pan-genome, i.e. every newly sequenced strain
would contribute new genes into the pool of available
genes for that specific species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

Muzzi, Masignani, and Rappuoli pointed out the importance of these concepts, not only to study genetic diversity,
but also in terms of medical discoveries and cures [7].
During the design and analysis of potential vaccines,
where methods like the reverse vaccinology approach play
an important role, the genes of the core genome are most
likely the most desirable targets for novel drug candidates.
An automated calculation of the characteristics of a species's pan-genome is highly desirable to identify singleton
genes, the dispensable and the core genome. Different
tools have been developed to compare the sequences of
genomes, comprising for example the VISTA family of
tools, xBASE or GeConT [8-11]. However, when these
tools were designed, attention was focused on the comparison of the genomes of different species. In the mean
time, particularly resulting from the upcoming pyrosequencing technologies, bioinformatics support for the
comparison of multiple strains of the same species was
needed. Therefore databases like the Comprehensive
Microbial Resource (CMR) or the Microbial Genome
Database (MBGD) were designed dedicated to the comparison of multiple genomes of related species [12,13].
The CMR provides numerous comparative tools for analysis of 438 genomes stored in its database, including a
multi-genome homology comparison tool. This tool
allows the user to calculate the number of proteins in a
reference genome that have hits to up to 15 selected comparison genomes. The resulting homologous genes of the
selected genomes are presented in a circular display of
proteins the selected genomes have in common. Special
sets of these homologous genes like the core genes or the
singletons can be observed and exported in a tabular format. The MBGD provides comparative analysis features
for 631 finished bacterial genomes. The genes of selected
genomes can be clustered to homologous groups, resulting in a set of ortholog clusters. From this ortholog clusters the core genome, the pan genome and the singletons
of a given genome can be calculated. Additional analysis
and visualization features are available for the clustered
genes like multiple alignments or a comparison of the
context of the genes on a genome map. While both databases provide a wide range of highly valuable analysis features, both have limitations in the analysis of groups of
related genomes. When using the CMR the user can only
view the core genes and singletons for the reference
genome. Homologous protein mappings can be analyzed
only for the comparison of the reference genome to one
other genome, an overall table for all genomes is missing.
Additionally, the pan genome can't be displayed using the
CMR. The MBGD can calculate the core genome as well as
the pan genome or singleton genes, but it is focused on
the calculated ortholog clusters. There is a lack of genome

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:154

wide analysis features like Venn diagrams of the common
gene pools of the analyzed genomes or synteny/scatter
plots of homologous proteins, and the web interface is
not very intuitive. Furthermore, both databases don't feature phylogenetic analyses.
Another crucial aspect when analysing groups of related
genomes is the definition of a homology criterion to cluster genes together. Both databases offer a selection of
parameters to the user to define a homology cutoff for the
genome comparisons. When using the MBGD one can
choose amongst 16 parameters in different combinations.
The CMR offers three parameters: Minimum percent similarity, minimum percent identity, or maximum p-value.
A user can use the default parameters or has to find the
parameters best suited for the genomes he wants to compare by trial and error. An automatic estimation of an adequate homology criterion would be a great easement of
comparative analyses. Therefore we developed EDGAR as
an easy-to-use integrated solution, capable of performing
genome comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of multiple strains of a species based on a homology cutoff automatically adjusted to the analyzed genomes.

Implementation
EDGAR is a bioinformatics approach to provide quick
access to orthology information and comparative genomics.
System design
The system design of EDGAR is based on a standard threetiered architecture. As a data backend (database layer), we
use SQLite http://www.sqlite.org/. SQLite is an easy-touse file based relational database management system
and allows simple transfer of complete data sets from one
operating or hardware system to another one. The business logic layer is implemented in Perl http://
www.perl.org/ using the DBI package to access the data
backend. We created a user interface (presentation layer)
based on Perl CGI and some JavaScript. The setup of an
EDGAR project requires the selection of related genomes.
FASTA files for all coding sequences of every genome and
their corresponding NCBI protein table files (.ptt), and
BLAST databases need to be stored in a project directory.
For the precalculated projects data from the NCBI
genomes database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/
entrez?db=genome was used. Optionally, an EDGAR
project can be set up based on an existing project of the
automatic annotation plattform GenDB [14], comparing
all or a selection of genomes in the project.

We have implemented several maintenance scripts to set
up a project and perform all required computations like
the creation of phylogenetic trees. All calculations are realized using object oriented Perl. The all-against-all compar-

isons of the genes of a genus group are distributed over a
compute cluster using Sun Grid Engine http://griden
gine.sunsource.net/.
BLAST score ratio values
As described in the background section the definition of
an adequate orthology criterion is a task of vital importance. Following the original definition of orthology by
Fitch [15], two genes are orthologs if they diverged
through a speciation event. But due to the fact that
orthologs are mainly used to propagate functional annotations, the term "ortholog" is often used to describe
genes with conserved function. The majority of scientists
uses bidirectional best hits (BBHs) of the well known
alignment tool BLAST [16] and chooses a certain e-value
or an identity threshold over a given alignment length to
define orthologous genes. Various more sophisticated
orthology identification approaches have been developed
in the past, e.g. Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG),
InParanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, or OMA [17-24]. Some of these
approaches were benchmarked by Hulsen et al. with the
result that, while InParanoid performs best, BBHs can give
a good orthology estimation for closer related species
[25]. Recently, Altenhoff et al. confirmed the good performance of BBHs in a comparison of 11 orthology estimation methods and concluded that BBHs give
comparable results to the more sophisticated methods for
both the "phylogenetic" orthology definition by Fitch and
the widespread "functional" definition [26]. A drawback
of BBHs is that only one-to-one orthologous pairs are
found, for duplicated genes or paralogs only a single hit
will be found, the following ones will be missed. But as
the BBH calculation is straightforward and therefore fast
enough to handle the huge amounts of sequence information in comparative genomics, this drawback has to be
accepted and we use BBHs as orthology criterion in
EDGAR. For all calculations protein BLAST (blastp) was
used with BLOSUM62 as similarity matrix.

For the completely automated calculation of genome
comparisons it is crucial to rely on a generic orthology criterion consistent within the genome group. For this reason orthology thresholds were generated based on so
called BLAST Score Ratio Values (SRVs) (as suggested by
Lerat et al. [27]) for every compared genus. Instead of
using the absolute scores of every BLAST hit, this method
employs the BLAST bit scores in relation to the maximum
bit score. While Lerat et al. used a fix SRV threshold of 30
for orthology estimation, we use a sliding window
approach to estimate the appropriate cutoff for every
genus. The maximum score is defined as the score resulting from an alignment of a gene against itself. As a BLAST
self hit always has 100% identity over 100% of the query
sequence length one gains the maximum bit score possi-

ble for the query gene. All hits of a query gene versus genes
from other genomes are normalized regarding to this
maximum score, so the SRV is defined as the ratio
(Observed score/Maximum score), thus giving a value in the
range [0, 1]. The SRVs for all BLAST hits of a genome versus another are plotted as a histogram, in most cases forming a bimodal distribution (see Figure 1). The first peak at
low similarity values probably represents nonspecific hits,
while the second peak represents orthologous genes. To
remove all nonspecific hits, a cutoff value has to be identified that discriminates between the two peaks automatically. To find this cutoff, we used a sliding window of a
given width over the histogram, thus searching for the
lowest scoring window (LSW), which is the window with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

the lowest count of BLAST hits. Within this LSW, the SRV
value with the lowest hit count is estimated, yielding the
final cutoff value. A SRV distribution with the search window and the resulting cutoff is shown in Figure 1A. This
procedure is repeated for all possible combinations of
genomes, resulting in n2 combinations for a number of n
genomes. The n2 cutoffs are plotted in a second histogram,
in most cases showing a normal distribution (see Figure
1B). To get a comparable general threshold for all subsequent calculations, the peak of this histogram is determined and used as so called master-cutoff.
The orthology cutoff generated by this approach is quite
strict, as all low quality BLAST hits are filtered out. For the

Xcc B100 and Xca 756C. The distribution of the SRVs is clearly bimodal with one peak at 7% and one peak at 98%. The lowest
scoring window (LSW) with a size of 10 was estimated at positions 62 – 72, the lowest single value at position 71, thus giving a
cutoff of 71% for this genome comparison. The histogram of the calculated cutoffs for all 121 possible comparisons of Xanthomonas genomes can be seen in panel (B). The calculated cutoffs show a normal distribution with a peak 63%, by this defining
the master-cutoff for the orthology estimation among Xanthomonas genomes.

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:154

Xanthomonas project with a calculated master cutoff of
63 this results in only 44% of all BLAST hits passing the
filter. The minimum percent identity of BBHs passing the
filter is 53.75% and mean BLAST e-value is lower than 1e10. As a consequence of that strict threshold orthologs
found by EDGAR, especially when conserved among
numerous genomes like the core genes, could be considered real orthologs, but some potential orthologs might
be lost.
Limitations
In some cases the SRV distribution does not show the
expected bimodal shape. This is mostly the case if there is
a high variation within the genomes of a genus. A good
example is the genus Corynebacterium, where the genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

are very diverse, leading to a SRV distribution with only
one peak for low similarities and a broad plateau of
medium scores with a decay at the highest scores. The cutoff calculation described above leads to cutoffs at very
high SRVs, thereby omitting the majority of all BLAST
observations (see Figure 2). To overcome this problem the
master-cutoff is set to 35% if the majority of SRV histograms do not show a bimodal distribution. This value has
shown to be a good cutoff value in the genomes compared
with EDGAR.
Data model
EDGAR stores the bidirectional best BLAST hit information of the all-against-all comparison of the genomes and
all needed sequence information in a SQLite database. A

comparison of two Corynebacterium strains. There is no clear peak at the high score region of the histogram. The lowest scoring
window is found at positions 90 – 100 and the lowest single value is found at 98%. In this comparison the vast majority of all
BLAST hits would be left out. For this reason the cutoff for genome comparisons showing no bimodal distribution is automatically set to 35%.

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:154

modular data scheme and the project based approach
allow to arbitrarily update single projects of the EDGAR
database backend whenever a new genome becomes
available for the respective genus. A local copy of the
NCBI Bacteria database used by EDGAR is updated regularly. Based on this update newly included genomes are
added to existing EDGAR projects to keep the database
up-to-date.
Calculation of the core genome and pan genome
The core genome is calculated by iterative pairwise comparison of a set of genomes G. One genome is selected as
reference genome, the gene content of this genome is
taken as base set for the following calculations. This set A
of genes is compared to a set B of genes contained in
another genome of the set G. For each gene in set A, a
lookup is performed to check if it has a reciprocal best hit
in set B. The lookup is performed on the BBHs filtered
according to the orthology criterion calculated based on
the SRVs. Every gene from set A that has no reciprocal best
hit in set B is removed from the set. The resulting set A' is
then iteratively compared to the genes of the remaining
genomes in G, resulting in a final set of genes that have
hits in all genomes of G, thus forming the core genome.
The pan genome is also calculated in a similar way. A set
B of genes is compared to the base set A of genes. Every
gene of B that has no ortholog in A is added to the reference set. This process is repeated iteratively for all
genomes in the set G, extending the base set A step by step
to the pan genome. The selected reference genome has
nearly no impact on the resulting core genome, its main
purpose is that the genes of the reference genome appear

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

first in the results. However, there may be some small bias
(< 1%) due to paralogous genes appearing in different
order during the calculation.
Phylogenetic trees
To support the comparison of different genomes, phylogenetic trees (see Figure 3) can be generated using a
slightly adapted version of the pipeline proposed by Zdobnov et al. [28]. The core genome is calculated as
described above. In the next step multiple alignments for
all core genes are created using MUSCLE [29]. Non matching parts of the alignments are masked using GBLOCKS
[30] and then removed. The matching parts are concatenated to one big multiple alignment of more then 1 Mb
length. Finally, a phylogenetic tree is generated from this
long alignment using PHYLIP [31].
User interface
The user interface is based on an Apache Web Server using
mod_perl and CGI. The web interface is separated into
three parts: The HTML code is organized in static HTML
templates. These templates use XHTML 1.0 strict, which is
supported by all modern browsers. The graphical layout is
implemented using CSS stylesheets. Both the XHTML and
the CSS code were validated to be compliant to the standards of the W3C consortium.

Results
EDGAR is designed to support the high throughput comparison of related genomes. A comparison of the genomes
of all genus groups of the NCBI genomes database with
more than three sequenced strains was performed, and

with the recently annotated Xcc B100 employed as reference to construct the tree. The Xcc genomes and Xca cluster closely
together, and are linked by a common branch to the remaining Xanthomonads. Here Xca and Xcv diverge from the X. oryzae
chromosomes. Among these rice pathogens Xoc forms a first side branch, while the Xoo genomes cluster together.

the resulting orthology information is made available to
the scientific community.
The EDGAR web application
EDGAR provides a precomputed database with orthology
information for all genomes of a genus, based on a generic
orthology criterion calculated from score ratio values
(SRV – see Methods). The calculated orthologous genes as
well as a number of visualization features are accessible
via a full featured web interface. Genomes of identical
genus are clustered together, where for each compared
genus group a separate project database is created to store
the BLAST score ratio based orthology information. The
SRV histograms and the derived cutoffs can be plotted for
every genome combination. The resulting histogram of
SRV-cutoffs for all possible genome combinations is also
available. Using these plots the user can validate the
orthology criterion calculated by EDGAR.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

Genes that have no orthologs in any other genome of the
genus are called singletons. Using EDGAR the singletons
of every genome in comparison to its group can be estimated within seconds. The singletons of a bacterial strain
can be exported as fasta file for further analysis.
The core genome can be calculated for a selected reference
genome in comparison to every combination of genomes
of its genus. The genes of the reference genome are used as
the starting set for the iterative core calculation (see Methods). The calculated core genome is presented as a table of
orthologous genes of all selected genomes and their functions, starting with the selected reference genome in the
first column (see Figure 4).
To observe the differences between the orthologous genes
of the core genome, EDGAR features multiple alignments
of the core genes, created using MUSCLE [29]. Further-

the upper part (A) one can choose a reference genome and a set of genomes to compare it with. The resulting table is shown
in the lower part (B) of the page, in this case the core genome table for Xcc B100, Xca 756C, and Xcv 85-10. EDGAR displays
the orthologous genes of all compared strains together with their gene function (as far as it is known) for every gene in the
core genome. For every set of orthologous genes multiple alignments can be constructed of the genes itself and of their
upstream region.

Page 7 of 14

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:154

more multiple alignments are created for the upstream
region of the core genes. This allows the researcher to
quickly find conserved sequences in the upstream region,
e.g. when searching for promotor binding sites or recognition sites of regulatory elements. The pan genome, the set
of all unique genes of the compared genomes, can be calculated for user defined sets of genomes. The pan genome
is also listed as a table of orthologous genes with their
gene functions, beginning with all genes of the reference
genome, followed by the genes added to the gene pool of
the genus by the other species. The table comprises unique
genes only, meaning that a gene that is orthologous to a
previously listed gene will not be added to the list. The
pan genome and core genome can be exported as fasta
files or as TAB separated tables of locus tags.
The genomic context of orthologous genes can be observed
via the comparative view. The gene names in the core
genome table and the pan genome table are linked to a linear view (see Figure 5) of all orthologous genes in their
genomic neighborhood, which allows e.g. for the analysis
of operon structures or genomic rearrangement events. The
comparative view can also be accessed via the sidebar
menu. Another feature of the EDGAR web interface is the
creation of synteny plots. Here, stop positions of two
orthologous genes of two bacterial strains are used as coordinates and plotted to a diagram with the sequence length
of the compared strains serving as x/y-axis. The resulting
synteny plot can reveal an insight into genome rearrangements that occurred during the evolution of the strains.
To visualize differential gene content between several
genomes EDGAR can create Venn diagrams for up to five

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

genomes. Every area in this Venn diagram represents a
subset of the compared genomes and is labeled with the
number of genes in this subset. To simplify the assignment of an area to a genome set every genome has a base
color. The areas of the Venn diagram are colored in the
averaged color of the associated genomes (based on the
RGB color model). Venn diagrams for more than five
genomes can be created theoretically, but as higher level
diagrams get extremly complex they were not implemented in the current version of EDGAR. Projects were
created for all genomes of the NCBI Bacteria database
where three or more genomes of one genus were available.
This resulted in 75 genus groups containing 582 genomes
(as at 15.02.2009). All these projects are freely accessible
via the EDGAR web interface. In order to analyze unpublished data using EDGAR, private projects with access control by a user management system can be created upon
request.
A use case study: comparative analysis of Xanthomonas
genomes
In a use case study, EDGAR has been employed to compare the genomes of Xanthomonas strains. Xanthomonads
are plant-associated and usually plant pathogenic bacteria
[32]. These Gram-negative bacteria affect a broad set of
host plants, among them important agricultural crops like
rice and other grains [33-35], soy beans, cotton, citrus
plants [36], but also tomato, pepper [37], or Crucifera
[36,38] including cabbage, rape, and the model plant
mouse-ear cress (Arabidopsis thaliana). Besides their pathogenicity-based agricultural relevance, some Xanthomonas
species, especially X. campestris, are also commercially
important due to their production of the polysaccharide

be seen by a mouseover window. The checkboxes on the right (C) allow the user to select genes for multiple alignments.

xanthan, which found many industrial applications,
mainly as a viscosifier [39-41].
Understanding the taxonomic relation of Xanthomonas
strains has become an awkward endeavor. In the early
days of microbiology, each bacterial isolate identified
from a host plant for which no member of this bacterial
genus had been described previously was classified as a
new species [42]. Later many of these species were merged
on the basis of in vitro tests, but the original name identifying the main host plant was conserved in the term
"pathovar" [43]. Incorporation of information derived
from partial knowledge of DNA sequences, such as 16S
rDNA sequences or RFLP patterns, led then to a reassessment of the Xanthomonas taxonomy [44], which is still in
progress [45,46]. This phylogenetic analysis provides not
only the basis for a systematic order of the Xanthomonas
bacteria, but also a deeper understanding of the evolution
of the Xanthomonas strains. However, all attempts so far to
reconstruct the true evolutionary relationships between
the Xanthomonads did not lead to a taxonomy that is generally applied within the community. Instead, the differing classifications of the strains resulted in inconsistent
naming in the literature. Thus, exploiting the emerging
genome data may now open the door to obtain a wellestablished Xanthomonas taxonomy on a definite basis.
We have used EDGAR to assess this approach.
All Xanthomonas genome data currently available from
public sequence repositories have been employed for a
comparative analysis of these bacteria. The genome data
were from the X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) strains
ATCC 33913 [36], 8004 [38], and B100 [39], the X. campestris pv. amoraciae (Xca) strain 756C, the X. campestris pv.
vesicatoria (Xcv) strain 85-10 [37], the X. axonopodis pv.
citri (Xac) strain 306 [36], the X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo)
strains KACC10331, [33] MAFF311018 [34], and
PXO99A [35], and the X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) strain
BLS256. The main features of these Xanthomonas strains
and their genomes are summarized in Table 1.

In a first analysis, the pan genome of the Xanthomonas
chromosomes was computed to consist of 12,951 coding
sequences (CDS). Among these genes, a core genome of
2,156 CDS was determined. Besides genes encoding basic
features like the central metabolism and the cell envelope,
the core genome comprised genes important for survival
in the bacterial environment. Such genes coded i.e. for the
flagella and chemotaxis, for putative glycosidases and
sugar uptake systems. Furthermore, pathogenicity factors
like the type I-IV secretion systems seemed basically conserved among all so far analyzed Xanthomonas strains, as
well as the xanthan production machinery encoded by the
gum genes.
To get an overview on the true taxonomy of the sequenced
Xanthomonas strains, the determined core genome data
was used for a phylogenetic analysis. The genome divergence was quantified with EDGAR using a similar
approach to one which recently proved to be of value for
eukaryotes [28]. The result can be displayed in a tree with
two main branches: the first comprising almost all X.
campestris genomes and the second with the genomes of
the X. oryzae strains, which includes the genomes of X.
axonopodis and of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria 85-10 in a
separate branch (see Figure 3). In the X. campestris branch,
all Xcc genomes were very close to each other and the
genome of Xca 756C was only marginally more distant
from these strains. The second branch was more heterogeneous. Beside the branch with Xac 306 and Xcv 85-10 the
genome of Xoc BLS256 was more distant from the Xoo
strains. This phylogenetic clustering was in good accordance with the phytopathogenicity of the Xanthomonas
strains; the X. campestris strains, which were grouped
together, are all pathogens of cruciferous plants, while the
X. oryzae strains are pathogens of rice (Oryza sativa). Also,
Xoc BLS256, which forms a distinct branch within this
group, causes bacterial leaf streak disease, while the Xoo
strains provoke bacterial blight. Xcv and Xac that diverge
from the second branch leading to the rice pathogens,
affect pepper and citrus plants, respectively. The phyloge-

netic tree was derived from the core genome that comprised 2,156 CDS and thus less than half the genome of
each Xanthomonas strain. To shed more light on the relation of the Xanthomonads, the synteny of genome pairs
was plotted, which gave a rough survey on the conservation of gene order between individual strains (Figure 6).
For the analysis Xcc B100 was set as a reference. The comparisons show that the gene order of Xcc B100, which
despite some striking inversions was generally well conserved in the Xcc and Xca chromosomes, was increasingly
disintegrated along the phylogenetic tree that indicates
their divergence (Figure 4). While there was considerable
conservation in the Xca/Xcv chromosomes, the number of
rearrangements increased dramatically in comparison to
Xoc, with the gene order almost comminuted in Xoo.
Such chromosomal rearrangements have been linked to IS
elements [35,38], mobile genetic elements that were
found frequently in Xanthomonas genomes, with numbers
ranging from 58 in Xcv 85-10 to 267 in Xoo PXO99A
[35,37].
The degree in gene order conservation among the Xanthomonas chromosomes as apparent from the synteny
analysis seems well correlated with the phylogenetic order

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

computed for the core genome CDS. Two taxonomic
groups became evident, comprising of X. campestris strains
pathogenic for crucifers and of X. oryzae strains pathogenic
for rice. In between there was a third group consisting of
Xca and Xcv 85-10. These three groups have been further
characterized by analyzing the distribution of orthologous CDS within the groups (Figure 7). Among the crucifer-pathogenic X. campestris strains (Figure 7A) there were
particular overlaps between the genomes of strain Xcc
33913 and Xcc 8004. For the genome of strain Xca 756C,
that had been classified to the distinct pathovar "amoraciae", no outstanding role became obvious when compared to the Xcc strains. Among the X. oryzae
chromosomes (Figure 7C) the Xoo strains had a large
number orthologs in common, thus reflecting the different symptoms provoked by Xoc when affecting rice. The
Xac/Xcv chromosomes that branched off the remaining
Xanthomonads conjointly between the X. campestris and
X. oryzae groups, shared many orthologs with an Xoo representative that was also included in the comparison (Figure 7B).
Altogether these analyses conveniently performed with
EDGAR lead to a more comprehensive view on the phyl-

the position of each CDS of the chromosome given on the X axis is plotted against the position of its homologue in the second
chromosome given on the Y axis. Identical chromosomes result in a diagonal plot. The names of the analyzed chromosome
pairs are given on top of each plot. Among the Xcc and Xca chromosomes there are few chromosomal rearrangements, some
of which indicate large-scale inversion events. The number of rearrangements increases rather subtly when the Xca/Xcv chromosomes are compared to Xcc strains. A substantial increase in rearrangements becomes obvious for Xoc BLS256 when compared to Xcc B100, while the gene order seems almost disintegrated in Xoo 10331 (similar data for the other Xoo
chromosomes not shown). While synteny analysis is restricted to complete genome data for obvious reasons, other tools like
the phylogenetic tree analysis of the Venn diagrams are also available for draft genome data.

all CDS of the genomes and is not restricted to the core genome. In each individual analysis at most 5 genomes can be
included, as considering more chromosomes results in rather confusing visualization. Results for the X. campestris strains pathogenic to crucifers and the rice-pathogenic X. oryzae that were clustered in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4) are displayed in
panels A and C, respectively. Among the X. campestris chromosomes in panel A a particular high similarity between Xcc 33913
and Xcc 8004 became evident. The chromosomes shared 178 orthologous CDS exclusively, and further 225 CDS conjointly
with strain Xca 756C. In panel C among the X. oryzae genomes, the chromosomes of X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains shared 375
orthologs, while the X. oryzae pv. oryzicola chromosome overlapped less with the Xoo chromosomes. In panel B the Xac and
Xcv chromosomes that clustered in between the X. campestris and X. oryzae groups were compared with each other and a representative of the X. campestris and X. oryzae groups. The analysis brought to light a surprisingly high number of 690 orthologs
shared among Xac, Xcv and the Xoo representative, indicating closer connections of these strains to the X. oryzae group than
to the crucifer pathogenic X. campestris strains.
ogeny of the Xanthomonads that so far was clouded to
some extend by previous contradictory taxonomic classifications. Now EDGAR facilitates a high-resolution analysis for the sequenced strains. The results for the available
genomes imply two phylogenetic groups that constitute
crucifer-pathogenic and rice-pathogenic strains, respectively. While the genome-based analyses reflect the distinct disease symptoms caused by an infection with X.
oryzae pv oryzicola, the classification of Xca 756C in a separate "pathovar" is questioned. Furthermore, the X. axonopodis pv. citri and X. campestris pv. vesicatoria strains are
related. This is in accordance with previous phylogenetic
analyses that caused X. campestris pv. vesicatoria strains to
be reclassified as X. axonopodis [44,46]. The substantial
distance between Xcv 85-10 and the group of the remaining X. campestris strains suggest that a renaming for Xcv
85-10 should be considered.

Discussion
As we demonstrated by the use case EDGAR provides various useful features for the comparative analysis of closely
related genomes. While some of the presented features are
available also in the CMR or the MBGD, EDGAR adds
some novel aspects like the phylogenetic analysis or the
Venn diagrams of common gene pools. The intuitive web

interface and the auto-generated SRV based orthology cutoffs allow researchers to analyze genomes of their interest
as quick as possible. The SRVs have been shown to be a
useful method for a generic orthology threshold estimation. These generic thresholds are crucial for the high
throughput comparison of genomes, as it is much too
laborious to observe every genome group manually.
While working well in the vast majority of cases, in some
genus groups (e.g. Corynebacterium) the SRV cutoff calculation fails due to very dissimilar genomes. A proper
method to estimate the threshold in these cases has yet to
be developed, up until then a fix threshold is used. As
most other orthology estimation approaches also use
static thresholds, this is no major drawback.
EDGAR will be continuously enhanced, there are several
features planned for the future. The identification and visualization of segmental duplications in analyzed
genomes will be one of the main topics in the further
development of EDGAR. Another planned feature is the
integration of additional visualization features to the web
interface like e.g. circular plots of orthologous genes.
A script based prototype of EDGAR was successfully used
for the comparative analysis of Neisseria meningitidis

strains. Schoen et al. [47] compared disease and carriage
strains of N. meningitidis to gain insights into virulence
evolution. Some techniques used in this work like a curve
fitting approach to test for an "open" pan genome are also
planned to be integrated into EDGAR in the near future.
Another feature to come is a search mask for boolean queries on sets of genomes. Furthermore, the integration
between EDGAR and the automatic annotation framework GenDB [14] will be expanded by integrating direct
links from EDGAR to GenDB annotations.
With regard to the large numbers of unfinished genomes
that are expected to arise from next generation sequencing
technologies, EDGAR is not limited to completely assembled genomes. As the calculation is gene based, EDGAR
has the capability to analyze multiple contig draft
genomes, provided that a gene finding approach like
GLIMMER or CRITICA [48,49] was performed on the contigs. The comparative view of EDGAR could actually support the annotation of unfinished genomes.
Space requirements of an EDGAR project depend on the
size and number of the analyzed genomes. Among the
precomputed projects the space requirements vary from 9
MB (Buchnera – four genomes of about 500 genes) to 1.2
GB (Mycobacterium – 19 genomes of about 4500 genes).
The compute time for one project also highly depends on
the number of genes to be compared (e.g. via BLAST).
Processing all 582 genomes in the precomputed projects
took about three days on a compute cluster (127×Sunfire
V20z dual Opteron 1.8 Ghz, 27 × SunFire X2200 dual cpu
dual core Opteron 2,4 Ghz, 3 × SunFire V880 8 × Ultra
Sparc III).

Conclusion
With the rapidly emerging ultra-fast sequencing technologies the trend moves towards analyzing not just one
genome, but groups of related genomes. EDGAR is the
ideal tool for analyzing connatural genomes by providing
a quick insight into the similarities and differences among
the sequenced genomes. EDGAR was used to analyze all
suitable sequences of the NCBI genomes database. All
genomes were sorted by their genus, and every genusgroup with three or more sequenced species was processed with EDGAR. This resulted in 75 genus groups containing a total of 582 genomes.
All these groups are accessible via the EDGAR web interface located at http://edgar.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de. Since
only published genomes are used in the analysis, no
access control is needed. However, it is possible to create
private EDGAR projects for unpublished data upon
request. The EDGAR web frontend provides convenient
access to all data stored in the EDGAR databases, allowing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/154

for the fast and easy calculation of singletons, core
genome, and pan genome of any combination of related
genomes available in the NCBI Genomes database so far.
The web based access to comparative data via EDGAR
stages an ideal platform for cooperative work of researchers all over the world.
Additionally, when comparing newly sequenced genomes
to a well annotated one, the orthology information
applied by EDGAR can be used to transfer annotation
information from the old to the new genomes. Visualization features include synteny plots for pairs of genomes,
as well as Venn diagrams of up to five genomes. Phylogentic trees as presented in the use case study make a powerful
expert system for evolutionary analyses available to the
scientific community. The visualizations stated above as
well as the singleton, core genome or pan genome tables
can be easily exported for further use in other tools.
Additionally, the overview tables generated by EDGAR are
the perfect means to give a review of the analyzed
genomes and to identify promising genes for further
inspections and specific analyses. All these features make
EDGAR a valuable gain for scientists in the field of comparative genomics.
Concerning the Xanthomonas use case, the advancements
in ultra-fast sequencing technology imply the arrival of
further Xanthomonas genome data in the future. Easy-touse tools like EDGAR will allow constant and timely
enhancements in understanding the phylogeny of these
organisms upon arrival of genome data. As increased
taxon sampling greatly reduces phylogenetic errors [50],
remaining obscurities in Xanthomonas taxonomy may be
resolved efficiently by extensively exploiting genome data
by means of EDGAR.
