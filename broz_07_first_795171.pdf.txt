Abstract
Background: The economic and biological implications of plant invasion are overwhelming;
however, the processes by which plants become successful invaders are not well understood.
Limited genetic resources are available for most invasive and weedy species, making it difficult to
study molecular and genetic aspects that may be associated with invasion.
Results: As an initial step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms by which plants
become invasive, we have generated a normalized Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) library
comprising seven invasive populations of Centaurea maculosa, an invasive aster in North America.
Seventy-seven percent of the 4423 unique transcripts showed significant similarity to existing
proteins in the NCBI database and could be grouped based on gene ontology assignments.
Conclusion: The C. maculosa EST library represents an initial step towards looking at gene-specific
expression in this species, and will pave the way for creation of other resources such as microarray
chips that can help provide a view of global gene expression in invasive C. maculosa and its native
counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first published set of ESTs derived from an invasive
weed that will be targeted to study invasive behavior. Understanding the genetic basis of evolution
for increased invasiveness in exotic plants is critical to understanding the mechanisms through
which exotic invasions occur.

Background
Invasive weeds are regarded as major threats to biodiversity because they can spread through communities, displacing or even eradicating native species. Over 25,000
invasive plant species have been documented in the
United States, invading nearly 700,000 hectares per year,
with a cost exceeding 34.5 billion dollars per year [1].
Multiple non-exclusive ecological hypotheses exist to

explain plant invasion in new habitats [2]. The niche
hypothesis suggests invaders are able to take advantage of
unutilized resources in new environments [3]. The natural
enemy release hypothesis suggests invaders escape their
natural enemies when moving to new environments,
allowing them to obtain high population densities [4].
The novel weapons hypothesis suggests that invaders
come equipped with an arsenal of chemical weapons that

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:25

are detrimental to the resident community of the invaded
habitat [5]. The plant community in the invader's native
habitat has had time to co-evolve defenses against these
chemical weapons, whereas the invaded community has
not, allowing invaders to obtain a competitive advantage
in their new environment [5]. The evolution of increased
competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis expands on the
idea of natural enemy release, suggesting that invaders
have rapidly evolved in their new environment to direct
more resources to competitive ability over defense [6].
Similarly, the allelopathic advantages against resident species (AARS) hypothesis expands on the idea of novel
weapons, suggesting that novel weapons which increase
plant competitive ability are selected for in the invasive
range [7]. All these hypotheses are supported at least in
part by data from field experiments which are often coupled with physiological and biochemical studies; however, it remains unclear why some plants become
problematic invaders and others do not. One aspect that
is rarely investigated in relation to invasive weeds and
their native counterparts is the potential for modified
gene regulation in the introduced range. As limited
genetic resources are available for most invaders and other
weedy species [8], defense and growth response genes
cannot be effectively monitored at the molecular level to
test hypotheses of plant invasion.
Centaurea maculosa Lam. (spotted knapweed) is a Eurasian
native that has become a particularly problematic invasive
weed in the northwestern United States, infesting over 4.5
million acres in Montana alone [9]. Spotted knapweed
often colonizes disturbed areas in North America, but also
invades rangelands, pastures and prairies, where it displaces native species and establishes dense monocultures.
Diploid and tetraploid forms of the weed exist in the
native range, but only tetraploid plants have been identified in North America [10]. The diploid form contains 18
chromosomes [11], with a DNA content (2C) near 3.6
picograms based on measures from closely related species
of the same chromosome number [12]. This translates to
an estimated genome size of approximately 1,800 Mbp.
Molecular markers and karyotyping have been used to
identify the two forms, as it is impossible to distinguish
between them based on morphological characters [10].
Both forms are short-lived outcrossing perennials of the
aster family; however, the diploid is monocarpic while the
tetraploid is polycarpic. Also, the tetraploid can tolerate
dense vegetation and thus may be a better competitor
than the diploid. This is presumed to be the main reason
why only the tetraploid form is invasive in North America,
while it is not considered invasive or even predominant in
its native Eurasian habitat [10]. Ecological and greenhouse investigations suggest that invasive C. maculosa is a
strong competitor against North American natives, even
in the presence of biocontrol agents that have been intro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/25

duced to limit the spread of the weed [13-17]. Also, common garden studies suggest that North American C.
maculosa seeds germinate more readily than their Eurasian
counterparts and the resulting individuals are larger, more
robust, and better able to fend off and compensate for herbivore attack, under both greenhouse and field conditions
[Ridenour et al. submitted]. These studies give partial support to the EICA hypotheses. There is also evidence that
Centaurea species (C. maculosa and C. diffusa) produce
allelopathic compounds that inhibit growth and germination of North American plant species more severely than
their native congneners, lending support to the novel
weapons hypothesis [5,7,15,16], although the production
of allelochemicals seems to be variable [18]. It is not clear
what combination of effects cause C. maculosa to become
invasive in North America.
As an initial step towards understanding the molecular
mechanisms by which plants become invasive, we have
generated a normalized Expressed Sequence Tag (EST)
library representing seven invasive populations of C. maculosa. Here we describe candidate genes that could be utilized in future experiments to correlate plant gene
expression and ecological hypotheses proposed for invasive success. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
published set of ESTs derived from an invasive weed that
will be targeted to study invasive behavior.

Results and discussion
Library creation and sequence annotation
Seeds from seven invasive populations of Centaurea maculosa Lam were grown for one to two months, at which time
two to three entire plants per population were harvested.
Tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped to Agencourt biosciences for normalized cDNA library construction. Single pass directional sequencing was performed on
4969 randomly selected clones from the C. maculosa normalized cDNA library (GenBank accessions EL930664EL935630). These sequences were assembled into 4423
unique contigs (contiguous consensus sequences) or
"unigenes" using Noble Foundation's in-house pipeline
based on TIGR Assembler [19].

The library consisted of 894 contig-forming ESTs which
created 348 unigenes and 4075 singlet ESTs, each representing a unique sequence. Of the 348 unigene contigs,
the majority contained only two EST sequences [see Additional File 1]. The largest unigene contig, which had high
similarity to a chlorophyll a-b binding protein, contained
17 ESTs. Interestingly, the second largest unigene contig, a
compilation of ten sequences, had extremely low similarity to known sequences and was not able to be annotated.
Other large unigene contigs were annotated as polyphenol (catechol) oxidase, chloroplast ATP synthase, photosystem I subunits II and XI, polygalacturonase (a

pectinase), and the small subunit of RUBISCO. Normalization should remove most redundant transcripts and
enrich for low abundant regulatory genes in the library.
However, it is interesting that one of the most abundant
transcripts found, polyphenol oxidase, is a potential
defense-related protein [20]. Overall redundancy of the
library was 18% (number of clustered ESTs/total ESTs)
which suggests that the normalization process was effective, and that continued sequencing of the library has the
potential to uncover many more unique transcripts.
Sequence quality was high; over 80% of the unigenes were
between 800–1100 bp in length [see Additional File 2],
with an average size of 784 bp.
To annotate the C. maculosa ESTs, the 4423 unigenes were
translated in all frames and searched for similarity against
the NCBI non-redundant protein database using BLASTX
(E-value of 10-4 or less). Of the entire unigene set, 77%
(3392) had significant similarity to genes in the NCBI
database, while the remaining 1031 sequences had low
similarity and were not able to be annotated. In the group
of annotated sequences, 35% (1177 unigenes) had top
BLAST hits to transcripts from Arabidopsis thaliana,
whereas only 10% (338 unigenes) had top hits to Orzya
cultivars. Taxonomically, 64% (2182) of the annotated
unigene top hits grouped into the rosids clade (which
includes the families Brassicacea and Fabaceae), 20.6%
grouped into the asterids clade (which includes the families Asteraceae and Solanacea), and 11.8% grouped into
the commelinids clade (which includes members of the
Poaceae family and other monocots) [see Additional File
3]. Thirty four unigenes had top hits to non-plant
sequences. Most of these non-plant sequences were annotated as hypothetical or unknown proteins.
Functional categorization of Centaurea unigenes
Gene ontology (GO) assignment programs were used to
functionally categorize unigenes in the library. Unigene
GO terms were counted and grouped in a hierarchical
fashion into the major GO functional categories of Cellular Component, Biological Process and Molecular Function. The GO categories of cellular component and
biological process contained over 3000 Centaurea unigene
annotations, whereas the molecular function category
contained only 2162 annotations. Each category contained approximately 16% unigenes that were annotated
as "unknown," but this number does not account for the
unigenes that were unable to be annotated in GO format
(Figure 1).

Approximately 38% of the unigene annotations were
grouped into the 'physiological process' category of the
Biological Process GO (Figure 1), which includes subcategories such as metabolism, transport, photosynthesis,
apoptosis, and homeostasis. The next largest category of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/25

unigene annotations (~34%), 'cellular process,' has some
overlap of subcategories with physiological processes (i.e.,
metabolism, transport), but includes unique subcategories such as cell communication, recognition, and differentiation. Five percent of unigene annotations fell in the
'stimulus response' category which includes subcategories
that relate to plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses,
such as pathogen attack. Thirty unigenes were subcategorized as responding to hormone stimulus, and most of
these fell into the ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling
pathways. Ethylene- and jasmonic acid-mediated pathways have been implicated in the defense of plants against
pathogens and insects [21,22], and these transcripts may
be up-regulated in C. maculosa under biotic stress conditions. Only a small percentage of unigene annotations fell
into the reproduction category of biological processes
(0.3%), but this is not entirely surprising, as reproductive
structures such as flowers were not used in the starting
material for the library.
Over 38% (829) of the unigene annotations fell into the
'catalytic activity' category of the molecular function GO
(Figure 1). Specific catalytic activities associated with
these unigenes covered a range of GOs, with the largest
amount of unigenes falling into the transferase and
hydrolase categories (282 and 266 unigenes, respectively). These types of enzymes are involved in many
intracellular processes including primary and secondary
metabolism, signal transduction, and post translational
modification of proteins. The next largest category under
molecular function was 'binding' (~27%, 580 unigenes)
with the majority of unigenes being associated with nucleotide/nucleic acid binding (134 and 230 unigenes, respectively).
Transporters accounted for nearly 8% of all unigene annotations, the majority being ion transporters and transporters with carrier activity (54 and 48 unigenes). Eighteen
unigenes fell into the 'ATP-ase coupled transporter' category, which includes transporters of xenobiotics, steroids,
sugars, peptides and other small molecules. However,
most unigenes could not be subcategorized with a specific
transport role. Uptake and translocation of nutrients in
plants differ, and regulated expression of specific transporters may allow increased competitive ability in different situations (e.g., increased expression of metal
transporters may be beneficial in metal-limiting environments) [23-25]. Depending on the specific transporter,
these genes could be interesting targets for understanding
root exudation or other release strategies for Centaurea
secondary metabolites and uptake of nutrients, and may
aid in understanding the role of transport in competitive
ability of Centaurea.

Gene Ontology annotation of Centaurea Unigenes
Gene Ontology annotation of Centaurea Unigenes. A
normalized cDNA library was created from whole plants
representing seven invasive populations of Centaurea maculosa. Five thousand ESTs were sequenced from the 5' end
(Agencourt biosciences), and assembled into 4,423 contigs,
or 'Centaurea unigenes.' Unigenes were translated in all
frames and the resulting amino acid sequences were used as
BLAST queries. Top BLAST hits provided annotation and
functional categorization (gene ontology assignment) for each
Centaurea unigene. Not all unigenes were able to be annotated by GO programs. Computational analysis was done
using the PLAN database (Noble Foundation).

One hundred twenty-seven unigene annotations were
designated as transcriptional regulators, with the majority
(118) being subcategorized as having 'transcription factor
activity.' Transcription factors are responsible for modulating cellular responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli [26],
and they may play important roles in plant invasion by
up- or down-regulating the expression of genes involved
in defense and growth responses. Transcription factors
identified in the Centaurea library made up ~6% of the
GO annotations for molecular function, whereas ~4% of
the Arabidopsis genome sequences are annotated as tran-

scription factors (The Arabidopsis Information Resource,
TAIR).
Over two-thirds of the unigenes were localized by cellular
component to either cell or organelle, as shown in Figure
1. Of these, 164 unigenes were assigned to the nucleus,
357 to the mitochondrion, 52 to the chloroplast, and 37
to the cytosol. Thirty-five unigenes were assigned to the
cell wall category and 290 unigenes were assigned to the
membrane category, although only 27 could be further
categorized to the plasma membrane. These membrane
proteins may be interesting targets to investigate transport
and/or signal transduction.
A wide variety of functional categories were represented in
the Centaurea library. Many of these unigenes could be
used as candidates for production of a microarray to visualize changes in global gene expression, or to look at more
specific changes in regulation related to plant defense or
stress.
Unigene candidates for testing ecological hypotheses
Evolution and plasticity
The EICA hypothesis suggests that when plants are introduced into a new range, they escape their enemies and
rapidly evolve to put more resources into growth/reproduction and less into defense [5]. Evolution through random mutation, movement of transposable elements, and
genetic recombination may facilitate changes in plant
genes or gene expression which give them a competitive
and evolutionary advantage [27]. In addition, novel environments can reveal genetic variants in a population that
possess advantageous phenotypes due to adaptive or
developmental plasticity [28]. Candidate unigenes from
the Centaurea cDNA library potentially involved in
genome evolution and plasticity are described below.
Mobile elements
Mobile, or transposable elements (transposons) have the
ability to modify DNA sequences by 'jumping' in and out
of places in the genome, and certain mobile elements
carry gene fragments that, when transposed, lead to repetition or creation of new genetic material [29]. Mobile elements can modify genome size, gene regulation, and gene
function, all of which contribute to genome evolution
[29,30]. In the invasive Centaurea cDNA library, six transposable element-related unigenes were identified [see
Additional File 4]. Normally transposable elements are
found in non-coding regions of their host genomes and
are considered 'silent;' however, expressed transposable
elements, such as those found in the Centaurea cDNA
library, have been detected in plants at specific growth
stages and under biotic stress conditions such as pathogen
attack and wounding [32,33]. Evidence from such experiments support Barbara McClintock's idea that transposa-

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:25

ble elements may play a role in genome evolution
through organismal adaptation to stress [34], and it
would be interesting to test this idea in relation to plant
invasion.
Heat-shock proteins
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a stress-induced protein,
has been shown to buffer genetic variation in morphogenic pathways in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and
the cruciferous plant Arabiodpsis [28]. As a chaperone of
proteins that regulate growth and development, Hsp90
may allow for the storage and release of genetic variation,
as well as allowing phenotypic plasticity in an organism's
response to their environment [28,35]. Eight heat shockrelated unigenes were identified in the Centaruea cDNA
library [see Additional File 4]. One unigene is closely
related to Hsp90, one to Hsp60, one to Hsp70, and the
others are annotated as 'putative heat-shock proteins' or
'heat shock factors.' Only two of these unigenes have top
BLAST hits to sequences from A. thaliana, suggesting there
may be a wide diversity of Hsp90 related sequences in
Centaurea. Understanding the mechanism of these proteins in relation to plant genotype, environment and
defense response throughout the native and invasive
range of C. maculosa may give some clues to the plasticity
of the species.
Secondary metabolism
As explained above the AARS hypothesis proposes that
novel weapons, often in the form of secondary metabolites, are selected for in invasive plants in the introduced
ranges. Members of the aster family are capable of synthesis of a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites that may
aid in basal and induced defense response, as well as in
competition against other plants [16,36]. Included in the
list of secondary metabolites synthesized by Centaurea spp.
are polyacetylenes and related thiophenes, flavonoids
(flavones and flavonols and their derivatives in particular)
and their glycosides, phenolics and lignans, coumarins,
anthocyanins, cyanogenic glycosides (prunasin), mono-,
sesqui-, di- and tri-terpenoids (with sesquiterpene lactones particularly diverse), and steroidal compounds [36].
Described below are several Centaurea unigenes which
share sequence similarity with characterized genes
involved in plant secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Further study of these candidate genes may aid in understanding the relative influence of AARS in Centaurea
invasion.
Sesquiterpene lactones
C. maculosa is known to accumulate the sesquiterpene lactone, cnicin, at concentrations approaching 2% of dry
weight on the leaves of the inflorescence stem [37]. This
compound is thought to act as a protectant against herbivory of generalist herbivores and acts as an oviposition

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/25

stimulant for specialist herbivores [38] including Agapeta
zoegana, a biological control agent introduced for the control of C. maculosa in the North America. Additionally,
cnicin is phytotoxic to several plant species [39], appears
to inhibit the rumen microbial activity of sheep (thereby
reducing digestibility of C. maculosa [40]), possesses
broad spectrum anti-fungal activity [41], and is being
examined as a potential pesticide for control of formosan
termite [42]. Sesquiterpenes are synthesized through
cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) followed by
further modification steps including oxidation, reduction,
and glycosylation reactions. The genes responsible for the
committed step that catalyzes the conversion of FPP to
sesquiterpene hydrocarbons are well-characterized,
including sesquiterpene synthases from aster family members such as Artemisia annua, Solidago canadensis, Helianthus annuus, Ixeris dentata, Chicorium intybus, and Lactuca
sativa. In the Centaurea cDNA library, no unigenes were
annotated as a sesquiterpene synthase. However, several
unigenes revealed high sequence simlarity to genes
involved in the synthesis of the iosprenoid pyrophosphates, metabolic precursors to the terpenoids. BLAST
similarity searches revealed two unigenes which closely
matched the Antirrhinum majus geranyl diphosphate synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of two isopenyl
pyrophosphate units to form a ten-carbon precursor (geranyl pyrophosphate – GPP) of monoterpenoids. GPP can
then be extended further to FPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and ultimately to dolichol phosphate, a
polyprenoid involved in the formation of glycoproteins
via the endomembrane system. Two unigenes were annotated as dehydrodolichol phosphate synthases by GO
annotation.
Following formation of the ring structure, sesquiterpene
skeletons can be modified through oxidation, reduction,
and glycosylation reactions to form an enormous diversity
of secondary products including cnicin, a sesquiterpene
lactone found in C. maculosa. Sesquiterpene lactones commonly occur in the Asteraceae, but the biosynthetic routes
for individual metabolites are relatively poorly characterized. One of the most well-characterized of the biosynthetic pathways leading to sesquiterpene lactones is that
for artemisinin, a compound of value as an anti-malarial
drug [43] isolated from the aster Artemisia annua. Recently
the oxidation steps which generate artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin, were characterized and the entire
pathway to artemisinic acid reconstructed in yeast [44].
The reaction proceeds from FPP to the sesquiterpene,
amorphadiene (catalyzed by amorphadiene synthase),
and then to artemisinic acid, a reaction catalyzed by a single p450 enzyme which performs a three-step oxidation
reaction to form a carboxylic acid. A unigene from the
Centaurea library (CENT_UG_03500) demonstrates 93%
amino acid sequence identity to this three-step oxidase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/25

and a nearly identical gene from the related A. obtusifolia
[see Additional File 5], highly suggestive of a role in the
biosynthesis of the cnicin or other sesquiterpene lactones
of C. maculosa.
Acetylenes
The polyacetylelenes are secondary metabolites derived
from fatty acids, and are characteristic of many aster genera. Acetylenes contain highly reduced carbon-carbon triple bonds. The biosynthetic route has been only recently
characterized for a small group of acetylenes [45]. Alignment of established acetylenases, Δ12 oleic acid desaturates, and C. maculosa unigenes annotated as desaturases
reveals three C. maculosa ESTs which cluster closely to H.
annuus acetylenase, but are distinct from H. annuusΔ12
oleic acid desaturates (Figure 2), suggesting that these
genes may be involved in acetylene production in C. maculosa.
Flavonoids
The basic flavonoid pathway is the best-characterized metabolic pathway of plant secondary metabolism [46]. More
than 800 flavonoid structures have been characterized
from the Asteraceae, in the Cardueae tribe, which contains
Centaurea spp., that are particularly rich in hydroxy-methylated flavonols and flavones [47]. The early steps of the
pathway involve the generation of phenylpropanoid
monomers which are condensed with three malonyl CoA
units to form the chalcones, followed by isomerization,
hydroxylation, methylation, glycosylation, and polymerizations steps [46]. Many steps of the general flavonoid
pathway are represented in the Centaurea cDNA library,
with clones present that show similarity to most characterized enzymatic functions [see Additional File 6]. However, no unigenes showed significant sequence similarity
to flavonol synthase (FLS), the gene responsible for generation of the flavonols, or flavone synthase (FS), the gene
product of which converts flavanones to flavones. Each of
these genes are oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, and
several unigenes suggest this function, as revealed by GO
annotation. Further, only two FS clones from Asteraceae
members (Gerbera hydrida and Callistephus chinensis) are
reported in GenBank, and only one Asteraceae sequence is
annotated as an FLS gene (from G. hybrida), suggesting
that one or more of the unannotated 2-oxoglutaratedependent dioxygenases may be FLS or FS genes.

As C. maculosa has been reported to exude catechin, a phytotoxic secondary metabolite, from its root [15,16], the
study of genes involved in secondary metabolism in C.
maculosa may help reveal how this compound and other
potential 'novel weapons' are synthesized. The AARS
hypothesis suggests that plants may evolve to produce
more of the effective 'weapon' compounds when in the
invaded environment [7], so it would also be interesting

to test the activity of some of these proteins in native and
invasive populations.
Defense-response genes
One of the main predictions of EICA is that plants in their
new environment rapidly evolve to put more resources
into growth/reproduction and less into defense, as they
have escaped their co-evolved pathogens and predators
[5]. Thus, native plants should show higher levels of basal
defense compounds and should out-perform invasives
when both are exposed to pathogens from the native environment. The Centaurea cDNA library contains a variety of
unigenes annotated as defense response genes [see Additional File 7], as well as components of signaling path-

ways that may be involved in defense mechanisms. These
include Centaurea sequences similar to three lipoxygenase
(LOX) proteins, two phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL)
proteins, and three calmodulin binding proteins. Also
identified was a Centaurea sequence similar to the Arabidopsis activated disease resistance-like (ADR1-like) gene,
which contains nucleotide binding site – leucine rich
repeat (NBS-LRR) motifs characteristic of defenseresponse proteins [48]. Four Centaurea unigenes show
high similarity to another LRR containing Arabidopsis transcript (At3g20820) that is suspected to be involved in the
defense response signal transduction pathway. The Centaurea library contains seven other unigenes, not annotated as "defense related," that contain LRR motifs or
leucine zippers [see Additional File 7]. One Centaurea unigene shows similarity to the R gene-mediated disease
resistance gene (EDS1) from Arabidopsis, which is required
for SA accumulation and production of pathogenesis
related (PR) proteins [49]. Two unigenes show similarity
to a PR-1 type protein from Sambucus nigra, similar to Arabidopsis PR-1-related transcript At4g33720. In addition,
twelve of the unigenes annotated as having 'transcription
factor activity' in the GO molecular function categorization are similar to WRKY transcription factors [see Additional File 7] which may be involved in initial steps of the
defense-response signaling pathway [50]. With this C.
maculosa sequence information it will be possible to test
levels of basal defense responses at the level of gene
expression in populations of native and invasive plants.
Genes involved only in induced defense response may be
under represented in the library, as the plants that were
used in library creation did not undergo interspecific competition, pathogen stress, or herbivory and were not
grown under field conditions. However, many of the unigenes identified have been implicated in induced defenses
in other systems (PR-1 and EDS-like unigenes), and these
may be good candidates for studying induced as well as
basal defense response. Future experiments can be coupled with more traditional tests of morphology and biochemistry in order to supplement data concerning
hypotheses of plant invasion.

Conclusion
This is the first report of a cDNA library from an invasive
weed. The Centaurea cDNA library, consisting of 4423
unique transcripts (unigenes), represents an initial step
towards looking at gene-specific expression in this species,
and will pave the way for creation of other resources such
as microarray chips that can help provide a view of global
gene expression in invasive C. maculosa and its native
counterparts. These technologies can likely be extrapolated to look at other invasive knapweeds (C. diffusa, C.
solstitialis, C. virgata and Acroptilon repens) also problematic in North America. By comparing native and invasive
C. maculosa plants under different stresses, including her-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/25

bivory and pathogen infection, it will be possible to test
hypotheses such as EICA using molecular resources coupled with classical (physiological/ecological) techniques.
This technology will also be useful to help understand differences in gene expression between diploid and tetraploid C. maculosa populations, and give insight into the
effects of chromosome doubling and polyploidization
events in the plant world. Additionally, by looking at secondary metabolite accumulation and the genes responsible for their production in C. maculosa, it may be possible
to knock out those genes, create mutants defective in the
production of allelochemicals, and to finally determine
unequivocally whether allelopathy (novel weapons) is
involved in the invasive success of some weeds.
Understanding the genetic basis of evolution for increased
invasiveness in exotic plants is critical to understanding
the mechanisms through which exotic invasions occur.
The Centaurea cDNA library provides a unique resource
that will be valuable to geneticists, molecular biologists,
and ecologists alike.

Methods
Plant material
Seeds from seven invasive populations of Centaurea maculosa Lam were obtained from Ray Callaway (University of
Montana, Missoula). Five populations originated from
Montana, one from Washington, and one from Virginia.
Six seeds from each of the seven populations were sterilized by heating at 50°C for ten minutes in distilled water.
Seeds were cooled to ambient temperature, rinsed with
sterile water and placed in Petri dishes containing moist
germination paper. Plates were wrapped in parafilm and
placed in a growth chamber with a photoperiod of 20
hours light/six hours dark at a constant temperature of
25°C. Upon the emergence of cotyledons, seedlings were
planted in 2.5 cm pots in a mix of 70% sand, 10% perlite,
and 20% autoclaved potting soil and transported to the
greenhouse. Pots were placed in a flat and covered with
plastic wrap for approximately one week until seedlings
became established. Plants were given sufficient water and
fertilized once per week with a dilute solution of Miracle
Gro (Maryville, OH). After approximately two months,
two to three plants per population were removed from
pots and their roots were washed to remove soil particles.
All plants were in the form of small rosettes, lacking stem
and floral tissue. Entire plants, including roots, were
wrapped in foil, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80°C until processing.
Creation of normalized cDNA library
Plant tissue was shipped in dry ice to Agencourt Bioscience Corporation (Beverly MA). Total RNA was
extracted and optimized first strand cDNA synthesis was

performed using a primer adapted with a rare enzyme cut
site. cDNA fragments were size-selected by agarose gel
electrophoresis, and directionally cloned into a pAGEN-1
vector. A positive control containing the TetR gene was
used during construction of the primary library to ensure
library quality. Single-stranded DNA was made from a
portion of the primary library by phagemid production,
and reactions were treated with DNase I to ensure the
removal of double-stranded DNA. A second portion of the
primary library was linearized and transcribed into antisense RNA with biotinylated dNTPs. Oligo dT and primer
extension were used to pre-block the poly-A region prior
to hybridization. The anti-sense RNA and single-stranded
circular DNA were hybridized, and abundant clones were
removed using streptavidin. To reduce the amount of
empty vectors, a Not1 oligo and Taq polymerase were
used to synthesize double stranded DNA from the single
stranded normalized library prior to final transfection.

genes) in multiple reading frames. The top NR hit for each
unigene sequence (E-value 10-4 or less) and top hits from
GO assignment were deposited in PLAN and can be
searched by keyword or unigene accession number (PLAN
Project 30060, CENT_UG_00001-CENT_UG_04423).
GO annotation was used to categorize unigenes into functional categories by molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A customized in-house
program was used to count the number of unigenes being
grouped under different GO term categories in a hierarchical fashion [19]. The vector trimmed EST sequences have
also been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers
EL930664-EL935630).

The normalized library was plated and 4969 clones were
randomly selected for sequencing. Automated plasmid
purification was achieved using the SPRI (SprintPrep™)
technique, which harvests plasmid DNA directly from
lysed bacterial cultures, trapping both plasmid and
genomic DNA to functionalized bead particles and selectively eluting only the plasmid (Beckman Biomek FX
robots and CCS Packard DNATraks).
Sequencing reactions
DNA templates were sequenced in 384-well format using
BigDye® Version 3.1 reactions on ABI3730 instruments at
Agencourt Biosciences. Thermal cycling was performed
using 384-well Thermal cyclers (ABI, MJ Research).
Sequencing Reactions were purified using Agencourt's
CleanSeq® dye-terminator removal kit. All reads are processed using Phred base calling software and constantly
monitored against quality metrics using the Phred Q20.
The quality scores for each run were monitored through
the Oracle 9i driven Laboratory Information Management
System (LIMS). C. maculosa ESTs were trimmed of vector
sequence and the data was transferred to a secure site for
download.
Sequence analysis
To determine the number of unique transcripts in the
library, an in-house pipeline program was used to cluster
and assemble the trimmed EST sequences. The pipeline
essentially utilizes TIGR Assembler with its default parameters (overlap of at least 40 bp with 94% identity). The
PLAN web system (Personal BLAST Navigator, Noble
foundation) was used to do a BLASTX search against the
non-redundant protein (NR) database for functional
annotation, and gene ontology (GO) sequence database
for functional categorization [19]. The BLASTX search
considered translation of the assembled consensus (uni-
