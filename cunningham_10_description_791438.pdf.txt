Description of Hymenolepis microstoma
(Nottingham strain): a classical tapeworm
model for research in the genomic era
Lucas J Cunningham, Peter D Olson*

Abstract
Background: Hymenolepis microstoma (Dujardin, 1845) Blanchard, 1891, the mouse bile duct tapeworm, is a
rodent/beetle-hosted laboratory model that has been used in research and teaching since its domestication in the
1950s. Recent characterization of its genome has prompted us to describe the specific strain that underpins these
data, anchoring its identity and bringing the 150+ year-old original description up-to-date.
Results: Morphometric and ultrastructural analyses were carried out on laboratory-reared specimens of the
‘Nottingham’ strain of Hymenolepis microstoma used for genome characterization. A contemporary description of
the species is provided including detailed illustration of adult anatomy and elucidation of its taxonomy and the
history of the specific laboratory isolate.
Conclusions: Our work acts to anchor the specific strain from which the H. microstoma genome has been
characterized and provides an anatomical reference for researchers needing to employ a model tapeworm system
that enables easy access to all stages of the life cycle. We review its classification, life history and development, and
briefly discuss the genome and other model systems being employed at the beginning of a genomic era in
cestodology.

Background
Species of Hymenolepis Weinland, 1858 (Platyhelminthes: Cestoda: Cyclophyllidea) have been used as
tapeworm models in research and teaching since the
1950s when they were first domesticated in the laboratory of Clark P. Read [1]. Adult parasites of rodents
with beetle intermediate hosts, they benefit from easy
culture in vivo using natural hosts that are themselves
model organisms (e.g. Mus musculus L., Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val). Research on Hymenolepis, and
especially H. diminuta (Rudolphi, 1819), H. nana (von
Siebold, 1852) and H. microstoma, is underpinned by an
extensive literature that includes much of our classical
knowledge of tapeworm biology [e.g. [2]]. A recently
initiated effort sponsored by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to characterize the genome and adult
and larval transcriptomes of H. microstoma http://www.

brought this classical model into the genomic era,
greatly advancing its utility for researchers interested in
employing a practical tapeworm system that allows
access to all life cycle stages. In light of this development, and the fact that laboratory isolates can vary in
features of their biology [3], it is desirable to have a
description of the exact strain on which the genome is
based, and to thus anchor the data to a well-defined
entity.
Hymenolepis microstoma was first described from the
bile ducts of mice in 1845 by Dujardin [4] who placed it
in the genus Taenia L., 1758, which housed all tapeworms known at that time. In 1891, Blanchard [5] transferred the species to the genus Hymenolepis and
provided an expanded description of the species.
Although Bear and Tenora [6] suggested synonymy
between H. microstoma and H. straminea (Goeze, 1782),
species status of H. microstoma historically has been
widely accepted, and molecular data have shown both
species to represent independent, albeit closely related,
lineages [7,8]. In contrast, the genus Hymenolepis has

itself been overhauled on several occasions and its membership and internal structure remain controversial. For
example, whereas Hughes [9,10] accepted the generic
assignment H. microstoma by Blanchard, Spasskii [11]
subdivided the genus and transferred H. microstoma to
the genus Rodentolepis Spasskii, 1954, which he erected
to house the rodent-hosted species of Hymenolepis with
armed rostella. At the same time Spasskii erected the
genus Vampirolepis Spasskii, 1954, which Schmidt subsequently considered a senior synonym of Rodentolepis,
thus resulting in the new combination Vampirolepis
microstoma (Dujardin, 1854) Schmidt, 1986 [12]. The
genus Rodentolepis was retained by Czaplinski and
Vaucher [13] in the most recent synoptic treatment of
tapeworms [14], but this work did not consider species
level taxa and therefore did not arbitrate on the generic
assignment of H. microstoma. Thus although Vampirolepis microstoma [12] represents the most recent formal
taxonomic assignment of the species, few investigators
have adopted this name, and most reports refer to it as
either a member of the genus Hymenolepis, or with less
frequency, Rodentolepis. In our view, a natural circumscription of hymenolepid species will not be attained
without the application of molecular data [15].
To this end, Haukisalmi et al. [8] recently used 28S
rDNA to analyze phylogenetic relationships among 32
hymenolepidid species from rodents, shrews and bats,
showing that both Hymenolepis and Rodentolepis represented paraphyletic assemblages. Although their work
assigned H. microstoma to a ‘Rodentolepis’ clade, the lack
of resolution and widespread paraphyly of the taxa in their
analyses indicate that greater taxonomic representation
and more robust data are needed before such nomenclatural circumscriptions can be made reliably. We therefore
follow Blanchard [5] in recognizing the mouse bile duct
tapeworm as a member of the genus Hymenolepis, employing the most common name in usage, whilst appreciating
that a more comprehensive understanding of hymenlepidid
interrelationships is likely to warrant generic reassignment.
Here we provide a description of a ‘Nottingham’ strain
of H. microstoma based on light and scanning electron
microscopy of laboratory-reared specimens from the
same culture used to characterize the genome. History
of the isolate, dating back to the laboratory of C. P.
Read [1], suggests that it represents a model that has
been widely employed and disseminated within the parasitological community for over 50 years, making the
genome data directly relevant to a significant pre-existing literature on its biology.

Remarks

Hymenolepis species exhibit the well-documented
‘crowding effect’ in which overall size and egg production are inversely related to the intensity of infection
[19]. Consequently, size is dependent not only on the
age of the worms, but on the number of worms present
in the host, and cannot be used diagnostically [20].
Crowding in H. microstoma has been shown to decrease
linear growth, egg production and the rate of proglottide
formation [21]. Moreover, we chose to document gravid
adult specimens at an age and size most useful for
laboratory manipulations in which larger worms pose
unnecessary practical problems (e.g. assays involving
whole mount in situ hybridization or in vitro culture).
de Rycke [22] showed that H. microstoma is in rapid
state of growth starting around 12-14 days post-infection in Mus musculus, and whereas our length measurements correspond to those reported by de Rycke for the
relevant age class (see Table 1), they are obviously less
comparable to reports based on older specimens, such
as those stemming from natural infections.

Discussion
Life history

Hymenolepis microstoma is most probably cosmopolitan
in distribution [20] and is not known from human infections outside of a single report in which mixed infections of H. nana and H. microstoma were identified in
four individuals from a remote region of Western
Australia [23]. Reported natural definitive hosts include
a large range of rodent genera that include mice (e.g.
Apodemus Kaup, Dendromus Smith, Leggada Gray,
Mastomys Thomas, Mus L.), gerbils (Meriones Illiger)

Page 5 of 9

and voles (Microtus Schrank) [9,12,24]. Infections in rats
is controversial: whereas Joyeux and Kobozieff [25]
reported successful infection of laboratory rats, Dvorak
et al. [20] found rats to be refractory to H. microstoma,
and Litchford [24] showed that rats became refractory
with age. Similarly, although infections can be established in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus Nehring), they
result in underdeveloped worms and cause severe
pathology to the host [20,24]. Dvorak et al. [20] demonstrated that mice could not be infected via eggs, as is
the case with H. nana (ie. auto-infection) [26]. However,
in congenitally athymic mice, Andreassen et al. [27]
found that autoinfection was possible, showing that
oncospheres penetrated the intestinal tissues and developed into cysticeroids that subsequently excysted and
developed normally in the bile duct and duodenum, in a
manner similar to the direct cycle of H. nana. Autoinfection of BALB/c mice was also implied by the detection of stage-specific antigens [28].
The life history of H. microstoma (Figure 3) has been
described in detail previously [20,25,29] and is typical of
other hymenolepid species, save its unusual location in
the bile duct of the mammalian host. In brief, eggs containing patent oncospheres are expelled with faeces into
the environment and may be ingested by either the
adult or larval stage of an appropriate beetle host (e.g.
Tribolium confusum, T. castaneum, Tenebrio molitor,
and Oryzaephilus surinamensis). Oncospheral larvae
(~20 μm; Figure 1D; Figure 2F) are released from their
thin shells (Figure 2E; n.b. appearing as a ‘hymen’ via
light microscopy and the eponym of the genus) through
the action of the host mouthparts, and after ingestion
use their three pairs of hooks and proteolytic secretions
[30] to enter the haemocoel. There they undergo a complete metamorphosis, reconstituting their bodies into
cycsticeroid larvae [31] in approximately seven days, the
phases of which have been documented by both Voge
[32] and Goodchild and Stullken [33]. Upon infection of
the definitive host, the combination of pepsin and HCl
in the stomach act to dissolve the larval membranes,
and juvenile worms are then activated in the duodenum
in response to trypsin and bile salts. de Rycke [22]
described adult growth and organogenesis in Mus musculus (summarized in Table 1): in the first three days
the juveniles move anteriorly in the upper 20% of the
small intestine and duodenum before establishing permanently in the bile duct, where they commence strobilation. Within approximately 14 days terminal segments
are gravid and most of their strobila extends outside of
the bile duct and into the duodenum. Thus the entire
life cycle, from egg to gravid adult, can be completed in
the laboratory in only three weeks. Although the germinative (’neck’) region of tapeworms has the potential for
‘immortality’ as demonstrated in H. diminuta by

The Hymenolepis genome

Figure 3 Life cycle of Hymenolepis microstoma. Infected adult or
larval beetles (e.g. Tribolium confusum) are consumed by rodents
(e.g. Mus musculus), releasing the cysticercoids which excyst and
locate in the bile duct before commencing strobilation. Gravid adult
worms develop in 12-14 days in vivo and release embryonated
eggs in the duodenum that are expelled with the host faeces.
Oncosphereal larvae are released when the eggs are consumed by
beetles, allowing them penetrate the gut wall and metamorphose
into patent cysticercoids in the haemocoel (apx. one week).

Through collaboration with The Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute, a draft genome of H. microstoma derived from
the cultures described herein is now publically available:
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/helminths
/hymenolepis-microstoma.html. The latest assembly
(October 2010) includes more than 40× coverage of the
estimated 140 Mb haploid genome and is based on data
produced by a combination of Roche 454 and Illumina
Solexa next-generation sequencing technologies. Gene
annotation is presently being conducted using a combination of RNA-Seq [35] and automated gene prediction
tools, revealing intron-exon structures and other aspects
of their genomic organization, and additional tools are
being used to characterize non-coding regions (M. Zarowiecki and M. Berriman, pers. comm.).
Hymenolepis microstoma is one of four tapeworm species to have complete genomes characterized: a reference
genome of Echinococcus multilocularis Leukart, 1863 and
draft genome of E. granulosus (Batsch, 1786) have been
produced by the Sanger Institute (available from http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/helminths/) in
collaboration with Profs. Klaus Brehm and Cecelia
Fernandez, respectively, and a consortium in Mexico are
currently working to characterize the genome of Taenia
solium L., 1758 [36]. These data herald the beginning of
the genomic era in cestodology and are already accelerating advances in our understanding of tapeworm biology
and infection. At present the only published platyhelminth genome is that of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni Sambon, 1907 [37]. However, genome
data for Schistosoma Weinland, 1858 and Echinococcus
Rudolphi, 1801, as well as the free-living flatworm

models Schmidtea mediterranea Benazzi, Baguna, Ballester, Puccinelli and Del Papa, 1975 [38] and Macrostomum
lignano Ladurner, Scharer, Salvenmoser and Rieger, 2005
(http://www.macgenome.org/), have been available for
some time and full reports on the characteristics of all of
these genomes, including that of H. microstoma, are
expected soon.
Model systems in the genomic era of cestodology

Of the three Hymenolepis species that have been
employed in laboratory research, most literature concerns the rat tapeworm H. diminuta, followed by the
medically important dwarf tapeworm, H. nana, and
finally by the mouse bile duct tapeworm, H. microstoma.
As a model for research in the genomic age, however,
H. microstoma has advantages over both of these alternative systems. For example, compared to H. diminuta,
it is both smaller and mouse-hosted, enabling smaller,
and thus less expensive, assay sizes (e.g. for RNAi), as
well as less expensive animal costs, whereas the mousehosted H. nana is both a human pathogen (albeit controversy persists regarding the conspecficity of human
and mouse strains) and capable of infecting other
laboratory animals through faecal contamination via its
direct life cycle [26]. Moreover, whereas H. nana survives only weeks in the mouse host [39], H. microstoma
persist for ~6 months and thus require less frequent
passage. Although the smaller size of H. nana would be
preferable for assays, on balance H. microstoma provides
the best practical solution for contemporary research
programmes that wish to employ a tapeworm model
providing easy access to all stages of their life cycle at
minimal expense and risk to human and animal health.
Completion of the H. microstoma life cycle in vitro
from egg to gravid adult was demonstrated in the 1960s
and 70s by De Rycke and Berntzen [40], Evans [41,42]
and Seidel [43,44], but to our knowledge no report of
research employing these techniques has been published
subsequently. Our initial attempts to follow these protocols for the cultivation of adult worms resulted in only
limited growth (3× increase in length) without the onset
segmentation (unpub. data). However, as many of the
reported media used by previous authors are no longer
commercially available, more work is needed to develop
contemporary protocols for in vitro culture. Among the
most advanced in vitro systems available for tapeworm
research today has been developed by Brehm and colleagues for Echinococcus [45-48], the genus on which most
of our understanding of tapeworm molecular biology is
based [49]. Development of an axenic culture system of
the hydatid stage of E. multilocularis has allowed them
to introduce transgenic and functional genomic techniques (e.g. RNAi) to cestodology, and their system is currently being used to pioneer research on stem-cells and

Page 7 of 9

developmental biology in parasitic flatworms [45,50].
Although not yet supported by genome characterization,
another currently employed in vitro system is that of
Mesocestoides Vaillant, 1863 [e.g. [51]] which are readily
maintained in the larval tetrathyridial stage [31] and can
increase their numbers in culture via asexual fission [52].
Adult worms have also been grown in vitro and induced
to strobilate through the addition of bile salts [53]. However, as with species of Echinoccocus and Taenia, in vivo
development of strobilar stages of Mesocestoides is prohibited by the legalities and expense of maintaining large
vertebrate hosts in the laboratory. Rodent hosted Hymenolepis species therefore remain the most convenient systems for research on the biology of adult tapeworms, and
for this reason we have been developing H. microstoma
as a model to study the development and evolution of
tapeworm segmentation [54].
Although the basic framework of cestode evolution
has been revealed by previous molecular studies [55-58]
and the interrelationships of select groups are now well
resolved [59-61], there has yet to be a comprehensive
molecular phylogenetic study of the largest and most
important group of tapeworms with regard to human
and animal health, the Cyclophyllidea. All of the tapeworm species for which genomes have been characterized thus far belong to this order and thus it is
especially important that we elucidate the relative phylogenetic positions of the 350+ described genera [14].
Such knowledge will provide an evolutionary underpinning for comparative genomic studies within the group
and allow us to identify the sister lineages whose genomes share the closest evolutionary histories to the species for which full genome data are now available.

Methods
A seed culture of Hymenolepis microstoma infected beetles was obtained from Nottingham University in 2005
courtesy of Prof. Jerzy Behnke and subsequently maintained in vivo at the Natural History Museum (London)
using flour beetles (Tribolium confusum) and BKW
outbred conventional mice (full protocols can found at
http://www.olsonlab.com; please contact the corresponding author to enquire about seed cultures). Gravid,
14-16 day old specimens were removed from the bile
ducts and duodenum of mice and quickly swirled in
near-boiling 0.85% saline for ~4 secs to fully extend the
worms prior to fixation in cold 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight at -4 C. Whole-mounted specimens were
dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, stained using
Gill’s haematoxylon or left unstained, cleared in beachwood creosote and mounted in Canada balsam. Sections
were prepared by paraffin embedding using standard
histological techniques and stained with Mayer’s Haemalum [62]. Measurements and illustrations were made

under differential interference contrast on a Leica
DM5000B compound microscope equipped with a camera lucida and digital documentation system. Specimens
used for SEM were dehydrated as above, critically-point
dried, sputter-coated with gold/palladium and viewed on
a JEOL XL30 scanning electron microscope. Internal
structures were imaged by SEM by cutting worms crudely using a razor blade.
