Abstract
Background: In sandflies, the blood meal is responsible for the induction of several physiologic processes that culminate in egg
development and maturation. During blood feeding, infected sandflies are also able to transmit the parasite Leishmania to a
suitable host. Many blood-induced molecules play significant roles during Leishmania development in the sandfly midgut, including
parasite killing within the endoperitrophic space. In this work, we randomly sequenced transcripts from three distinct high
quality full-length female Phlebotomus papatasi midgut-specific cDNA libraries from sugar-fed, blood-fed and Leishmania majorinfected sandflies. Furthermore, we compared the transcript expression profiles from the three different cDNA libraries by
customized bioinformatics analysis and validated these findings by semi-quantitative PCR and real-time PCR.
Results: Transcriptome analysis of 4010 cDNA clones resulted in the identification of the most abundant P. papatasi midgutspecific transcripts. The identified molecules included those with putative roles in digestion and peritrophic matrix formation,
among others. Moreover, we identified sandfly midgut transcripts that are expressed only after a blood meal, such as microvilli
associated-like protein (PpMVP1, PpMVP2 and PpMVP3), a peritrophin (PpPer1), trypsin 4 (PpTryp4), chymotrypsin PpChym2, and
two unknown proteins. Of interest, many of these overabundant transcripts such as PpChym2, PpMVP1, PpMVP2, PpPer1 and
PpPer2 were of lower abundance when the sandfly was given a blood meal in the presence of L. major.
Conclusion: This tissue-specific transcriptome analysis provides a comprehensive look at the repertoire of transcripts present
in the midgut of the sandfly P. papatasi. Furthermore, the customized bioinformatic analysis allowed us to compare and identify
the overall transcript abundance from sugar-fed, blood-fed and Leishmania-infected sandflies. The suggested upregulation of
specific transcripts in a blood-fed cDNA library were validated by real-time PCR, suggesting that this customized bioinformatic
analysis is a powerful and accurate tool useful in analysing expression profiles from different cDNA libraries. Additionally, the
findings presented in this work suggest that the Leishmania parasite is modulating key enzymes or proteins in the gut of the
sandfly that may be beneficial for its establishment and survival.

Background
Cutaneous leishmaniasis due to L. major is found
throughout the Old World, including the Middle East and
West Africa. Phlebotomus papatasi is the principal vector for
this parasite and is refractory to the development of other
species of Leishmania.
Upon taking a blood meal, hematophagous arthropods
express a large number of molecules that participate in
various physiologic processes ranging from blood digestion to egg development. Furthermore, many insects can
either obtain or transmit pathogens during the acquisition
of a blood meal. In blood-feeding arthropods, the midgut
plays a crucial role as the primary organ involved in
processing the blood meal and, in some instances, molecules expressed in the midgut of an insect vector have
been shown to directly influence pathogen establishment
[1,2]. Certain pathogens, such as Leishmania, appear able
to modulate the activity of sandfly midgut proteases for
their own benefit or survival [3,4].
Sequenced data sets containing information regarding
expression profiles of anopheline and culicine mosquitoes, such as Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, following a blood meal have become available [5,6]. Other
datasets now encompass insects such as Pedicullus
humanus [7] and Cullicoides sonorensis [8]. In comparison,
transcriptome information regarding sandflies is limited.
Previous work has focused mainly on the sandfly salivary
gland [9-11], whereas only a small number of sandfly-specific midgut cDNA have been identified [12-16]. Recently,
a large set of cDNA transcripts from the whole sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis has been sequenced, providing greater
information regarding molecules present in sandflies
[17]. However, the information regarding sandfly midgutspecific transcripts remains poor.
In this work, we embarked on a comprehensive study of
P. papatasi midgut-specific transcripts and compared the
expression profile of these transcripts by directly comparing those obtained from midguts of females fed on sugar
only, on blood or on blood containing L. major. With this
approach, we have identified several P. papatasi midgutspecific transcripts that are differentially expressed after a
blood meal and in the presence of L. major.

either on sugar only (unfed), blood or blood containing
L. major. 4010 high quality sequenced clones obtained
from the three cDNA libraries were combined and analysed resulting in the formation of 1382 clusters. Each
cluster may contain a large number of transcripts which
creates a contig (high quality consensus sequence) or may
have a single transcript that can be defined as a singleton.
Therefore, we will utilise the nomenclature of "cluster" in
the remainder of the manuscript to define either a consensus sequence from various transcripts or a singleton.
Consensus sequences were compared with various databases and putative functions were assigned. The categories
for the transcripts' potential biologic functions included
protein synthesis machinery, protein modification
machinery, transcription machinery, transporters, extracellular matrix, signal transduction, immunity, adhesion,
and conserved proteins of unknown function. Table 1
summarizes this analysis listing transcripts from female P.
papatasi midguts fed on sugar, on blood, and on blood
containing L. major. The first column shows the putative
biological function, the first section of columns shows the
number of clusters found in each of the three cDNA libraries in relation to this function; the second section of columns indicates the total number of sequences for these
clusters and the third section of columns shows the average of the number of sequences per cluster. The category
of "conserved unknown function" had the largest number
of clusters in all three of the cDNA libraries. These were
followed by metabolism, energy in the sugar-fed library
(95 clusters); metabolism, amino acid, which includes
digestive enzymes, in the blood meal library (40 clusters);
and protein synthesis machinery in the L. major bloodmeal library (51 clusters). The categories with the highest
number of sequences per cluster differed between the
three cDNA libraries and was highest among transcripts
identified as extracellular matrix (27.33 seq/cluster) in the
sugar-fed cDNA library and cytoskeletal transcripts for
both the blood meal (19.40 seq/cluster) and L. major
blood meal cDNA libraries (15.00 seq/cluster). The sugarfed cDNA library has 669 clusters with an average of 3.23
sequences per cluster. The cDNA library constructed from
blood-fed midguts consisted of 441 clusters with an average of 3.27 sequences per cluster. Of P. papatasi midgut fed
on blood containing L. major, this library produced 555
clusters with an average of 3.01 sequences per cluster.

Results and discussion
The midgut is the tissue where Leishmania development
takes place while within its sand fly vector. Within the
midgut environment, Leishmania possibly interacts with
various secreted molecules and cell types lining the midgut epithelia. In order to gain greater insight into the repertoire of the proteins present in the midgut of P. papatasi,
we constructed and sequenced three high quality fulllength cDNA libraries from the midgut of sandflies fed

The number of sequences in each category for the three
cDNA libraries is graphically represented in Figure 1. After
blood feeding, there is a decrease in the number of
sequences in all categories other than cytoskeletal, amino
acid metabolism, and heme metabolism. Noticeable differences in the number of sequences between the bloodfed and blood-fed containing L. major libraries occurs in
the protein synthesis machinery, extracellular matrix,

Table 2 gives a more detailed description of the different
types of transcripts identified in the combined analysis of
the three cDNA libraries. Only high quality sequences
and, for the most part, full-length coding sequences submitted to GenBank are shown. This table shows the different clusters arranged in the order of cluster number in the
combined analysis of the three cDNA libraries. The first
column of Table 2 describes the cluster number, the second column shows the clone that produced the fulllength sequence, the third column shows the best match
in the non-redundant protein database (GenBank, NCBI),
the fourth column shows the e-value for the best matching BLAST result in column 3, the fifth column shows the
assigned putative function of that cluster, and the sixth
column shows the accession number of the transcript submitted to GenBank. The four most abundant transcripts
were microvilli-associated like protein, followed by peritrophin-like protein, 40 S ribosomal protein S30 and a
transcript coding for a protein of unknown function. Still,
other abundant transcripts include those coding for various ribosomal proteins, chymotrypsins, carboxypeptidases, trypsins, a zinc metalloprotease astacin, a Kazal-

type serine protease inhibitor, Glutathione S-transferase
(GST) and various proteins of unknown function (Table
2). All the sequences generated from these three cDNA
libraries have been deposited as an EST database at the
National Center of Biological Information (NCBI), accession numbers ES346912 – ES351350 and ES351429). The
following is a more detailed description of relevant transcripts identified in the cDNA libraries:
Microvilli-associated like proteins
Of the most abundant transcripts found in the combined
analysis of all three libraries were transcripts coding for
proteins with similarities to microvilli membrane proteins from A. aegypti and A. gambiae. These transcripts are
also homologous to major allergens identified in the
cockroaches Blatella germanica and Periplaneta Americana
[18] and to a nitrile-specifier protein (PrNSP) from the
midgut of Pieris rapae. PrNSP has a role of converting toxic
compounds, such as isothiocyanate, into less toxic compounds, such as nitriles, that are excreted in the feces of
larval stages of this lepidopteran [19]. Four different puta-

tive microvilli-associated proteins were identified in the
three P. papatasi midgut cDNA libraries (Figure 2). Clusters 1, 2, and 3 represent likely polymorphisms of the
same transcript named here "microvilli protein 1"
(PpMVP1), which has a predicted molecular weight of
23.7 kDa. Another three transcripts coding for microvilli
proteins and derived from clusters 94, 96 and 98 were
named PpMVP2, PpMVP3, and PpMVP4, respectively. The
predicted molecular weight for these microvilli-associated
like proteins is 24.0, 25.6, and 25.6 kDa, respectively.
Additionally, each of these microvilli proteins has a
potential signal peptide as predicted by SignalP 3.0 and
no evidence of transmembrane helices as predicted using
the TMHMM 2.0 server. Identity between the amino acid
sequences of these microvilli proteins ranges from 21 to
36 percent (Figure 2, black-shaded amino acids) and similarity from 45 to 57 percent (Figure 2, grey-shaded amino
acids). The degree of conservation may indicate that these
are biochemically distinct from one another and only
commonly named based on the previous annotation of
other organisms with similar sequences. Searching the

Peritrophin-like proteins
Transcripts coding for three different putative peritrophinlike molecules were identified in the midgut of P. papatasi.
PpPer1 (cluster 9) and PpPer2 (clusters 12 and 13) transcripts code for secreted proteins with predicted molecular
masses of 29.8 and 9.6 kDa, respectively. PpPer1 is comprised of four potential chitin-binding peritrophin-A
domains (Figure 3A). PpPer2 is a much smaller predicted
protein and has only one potential chitin-binding
domain (Figure 3A). A third putative peritrophin, PpPer3,
was identified from cluster 26 with an apparent molecular
mass of approximately 32 kDa (Figure 3A) and contains
two distant putative chitin-binding domains. Phylogenetic analysis using the chitin binding domains of PpPer1,
Pper2, PpPer3 and those of peritrophins from several
insects (Figure 3B) suggests a low level of conservation
between the domains. Insect peritrophins have been
reported to bind to chitin fibers via multiple chitin-binding domains, forming the scaffold that maintains the
molecular structure of the peritrophic matrix (PM) in the
insect gut [20]. In addition to their role in the formation
of the PM, peritrophins may also play a role in preventing
the toxic effects of heme, a bi-product of blood meal
digestion. In A. aegypti, AeIMUC1, a mucin that encodes
putative chitin-binding domains was recently shown to
bind heme [21]. Although peritrophins have been characterised from several insects, including A. aegypti and A.
gambiae [20,22], no information exists related to sandfly
midgut-specific peritrophins. PpPer1 and PpPer3 have
high sequence similarity, at the protein level, to the translated sequences SFM-03c06 and SFM-02h07 from the L.
longipalpis EST database. However, PpPer2 has lower
sequence similarity to any of the assembled and translated
sequences from the L. longipalpis EST database, suggesting
a more divergent or novel molecule.
Trypsins
Among the most abundant transcripts in the cDNA libraries were the previously characterised P. papatasi trypsinlike, PpTryp1, (Cluster 18 with 158 sequences), and
PpTryp4 (Cluster 89 with 114 sequences) [13]. PpTryp2
(Cluster 23)and PpTryp3 (Cluster 135) were less abundant
with 12 and 8 sequences, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of trypsins from P. papatasi and from other organisms
resulted in the formation of two major clades (Figure 4).
P. papatasi trypsins co-localised in clade I containing other
insect trypsins, while their mammalian counterparts were
found in clade II (Figure 4). As detected previously, [13]

abundance in the blood-fed midgut library. The predicted

Ppchym3 has 36% amino acid identity to Ppchym1 and
30% amino acid identity to Ppchym2. Furthermore,
Ppchym3 has a signal secretory peptide (Figure 5A) and
has the required His/Asp/Ser amino acid triad necessary
for catalytic activity (Figure 5B). Ppchym1 and Ppchym2
both share sequence homology from the assembled
sequence NSFM-01d03 from the L. longipalpis EST database, while Ppchym3 is most similar to sequence SFM01b03.
Carboxypeptidase
A number of sequences were identified with homology to
carboxypeptidases. The full-length transcript of a putative
carboxypeptidase B,PpCpepB, was found from 37
sequences in cluster 16 and has high homology to a carboxypeptidase B identified in A. aegypti (GenBank accession# AAT36733). The predicted amino acid sequence of
PpCpepB contains a signal peptide, a propeptide domain,
and a carboxypeptidase domain. A putative carboxypeptidase A, PpCpepA, was also identified from cluster 113
based on amino acid sequence homology. Phylogenetic
analysis shows that the identified P. papatasi putative carboxypeptidases are separated into distinct clades (Figure
6A). Comparison of sequence homology indicates the
potential for these molecules to have substrate specificities of either carboxypeptidases A or B (Figure 6B).

the difference in amino acid composition; however, both
sequences contain the zinc ion binding motifs of metallocarboxypeptidases (Figure 6B). Additionally, the presence
of a putative signal peptide alludes that these molecules
are midgut digestive enzymes. Similarity between these
carboxypeptidases and those present in L. longipalpis EST
database is evident by the high homology between
PpCpepA and SFM-05c11 and between PpCpepB and
NSFM-32d09.
Astacin-like zinc metalloprotease
A putative astacin-like zinc metalloprotease (PpAstacin)
was identified from cluster 37, a product of five
sequences. This putative astacin-like protein displays a
predicted signal peptide and a slightly modified form of
the signature zinc binding catalytic domain for proteins in
the astacin family (HEXXHXXGFXHEXXRXDR). In

PpAstacin, changes in two residues (E to M and R to A)
resulted in the motif HEFLHALGFFHMQSASDR (Figure
7A). Although the altered residues may be involved in target specificity the zinc-binding catalytic domain remains
conserved. The likely role of this putative protein is blood
meal digestion, as astacins molecules have not been
implicated in immune functions and a considerable
number of transcripts constituting this cluster were
derived from the blood-fed midgut cDNA library. This is
the first report of this type of protease from the gut of a
sandfly, though NSFM-127b08 of the L. longipalpis EST
database was identified based on sequence homology.

a role in blood fluidity within the sandfly midgut, allowing it to be fully digested by the various proteases secreted
within the midgut following the blood meal. These represent the first Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors identified from sandflies. PpKZL2 shares low sequence
similarity with SFM-0406 from the L. longipalpis EST database and no significant similarities were identified for
PpKZL1.
Ferritin
Two transcripts encoding putative ferritin light (PpFLC)
and heavy (PpFHC) chain subunits were identified in clusters 103 and 122, respectively (Figure 9). After the ingestion of a blood meal the fly encounters a tremendous dose
of iron and heme which would be fatal to most organisms. Ferritin is one of the important factors in controlling
the high iron load in hematophagous insects. The midgut
of blood-feeding insects envelopes the blood meal and
consequently makes the midgut tissue the most likely site
of iron regulatory molecules. However, ferritin may also
be important for oxidative stress not related to the presence of iron or heme, as it is induced by the presence of
H2O2 in A. aegypti [25]. PpFLC and PpFHC are similar to
NSFM-144g07 and NSFM-146d09, respectively; molecules identified by searching the L. longipalpis EST database.

Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor
Two Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors were identified
from cluster 111 (PpKZL1) and 859 (PpKZL2) in the
cDNA midgut libraries. PpKZL1 codes for a small peptide
of 78 amino acids while PpKZL2 codes for a peptide of 89
amino acids. Both proteins are predicted to be secreted
based on the presence of signal peptides (Figure 8).
PpKZL1 is similar to various small Kazal-type inhibitors
found in Drosophila pseudoobscura (gi: 125986397), C.
sonorensis (gi:56199538) and the mosquitoes A. aegypti
and A. gambiae, and to larger Kazal-type molecules such as
infestin [23] from Triatoma infestans (Figure 8A). There is
only 28% identity and 42 % similarity between PpKZL1
and PpKZL2 (Figure 8B) suggesting these may have different functions. Additionally, these two Kazal-type cDNAs
are similar to the previously characterised thrombin
inhibitor, rhodniin,, from the triatomine Rhodnius prolixus
[24] (data not shown). Due to their anti-hemostatic effect,
rhodniin and infestin are believed to play a role in the fluidity of the blood within the midgut of these vectors. It is
conceivable that one or both transcripts coding for Kazaltype thrombin inhibitors identified in P. papatasi may play

Glutathione S-transferase (GST)
From clusters 125 and 232, two transcripts were identified
to encode putative GSTs with homology to other dipteran
GSTs in the Sigma and Delta/Epsilon classes, respectively.
The predicted molecular weights of the two putative proteins are similar at 23.2 kDa for cluster 125 and 24.5 kDa
for cluster 232. Within the midgut, these proteins may
play an important role in the regulation of reactive oxygen

species which occur as a by-product of hemoglobin digestion. Cluster 125 and 232 share high protein sequence
similarity with L. longipalpis ESTs NSFM-105e10 and
NSFM-74c11,
respectively.
Unknown proteins
A large number of clusters produced by the three cDNA
libraries have no sequence similarity to other known proteins. This has also been observed in the analysis of the
Chironomus tentans midgut with good evidence that the
unknown transcripts contained coding sequences [26]. It
is also possible that the abundance of unidentifiable
sequences may be caused by the sequence quality of the
transcripts or that the captured sequences are 3' untranslated regions, non-coding small nuclear RNA, or

Functionally characterised proteins
From the three cDNA libraries, we identified chitinase
transcripts which were then expressed as recombinant
proteins for the demonstration of activity in the midgut of
P. papatasi sandflies [15]. Another product of the cDNA
libraries was the identification and characterisation of a
galectin protein as the first arthropod receptor for a parasite; specifically, L. major within the P. papatasi sandfly
midgut [1].
Comparative analysis of transcripts that significantly differ
from the sugar-fed and blood-fed midgut cDNA libraries
To investigate the effects of blood feeding on the midgut
expression profile in P. papatasi, we compared the abundance of transcripts in sugar and blood-fed cDNA libraries. We hypothesized that a blood meal will have an effect
on the expression of sandfly midgut transcripts that will
be reflected in the relative abundance of sequences forming a cluster in the two libraries. Chi-square statistical
analysis was used to evaluate the significance of the differences in the abundance of midgut transcripts from unfed
and blood-fed cDNA libraries thereby identifying different expression profiles of selected midgut transcripts in
each cDNA library.

We observed a significant difference (P value ≤ 0.05) in
the abundance of a number of midgut transcripts when
we compared the sugar-fed and blood-fed sandfly midgut
cDNA library. Table 3 shows a list of selected transcripts
that were either more abundantly or less abundantly
expressed in these two cDNA libraries.
As expected, transcripts coding for proteolytic enzymes
such as trypsin (PpTryp4), and chymotrypsin (PpChym2)
were more abundantly represented in the blood-fed
cDNA library than in the sugar-fed cDNA library (Table
3). Other transcripts coding for peritrophin and microvilli-like proteins and ferritin were also more abundantly
represented in the blood-fed cDNA library. Also, we
observed a number of transcripts that were less abundantly represented in the blood-fed cDNA library, such as
tryspin 1 (PpTryp1), and peritrophin (PpPer2).
Validation of transcript abundance of selected sequences
by real-time PCR
In order to validate the results observed by the chi-square
analysis, we further characterised several transcripts by
semi-quantitative end-point reverse-transcriptase PCR as
well as by real-time PCR. These were utilised to assess the

relative abundance of transcripts in the midgut tissue
under sugar-fed and blood-fed conditions. The investigated transcripts included peritrophins PpPer1 and
PpPer2, as well as microvilli proteins PpMVP1, PpMVP2,
and PpMVP4.
The results of semi-quantitative PCR can be seen in Figures 10B and 10D where the induction of PpPer1 is clearly
evident. The differences in PpPer2 expression between the
two midguts conditions is less clear using this technique
(Figure 10D). Figure 10A shows the transcript abundance
of PpPer1 as fold change over the control gene in non
blood-fed and post blood-meal ingestion as measured by
real-time PCR. Figure 10C shows the same real-time PCR
analysis of the PpPer2 transcript. The profile of the peritrophin transcripts by real-time PCR strongly correlates

with the profile found in the libraries based on the
number of sequences.
Based on real-time PCR, PpPer1 expression is induced by
blood digestion and it is not detected in sugar fed midguts, corresponding with the lack of any sequences produced in the sugar-fed midgut cDNA library, compared to
54 sequences found in the blood fed library. As predicted
by the high sequence abundance of PpPer2 in the sugarfed cDNA library the expression of this transcript is highest in unfed sand flies and seems to be down-regulated by
the ingestion of a blood meal (Figure 10C).
Transcription levels of mRNAs coding for microvilli-like
proteins (PpMVP1, PpMVP2, and PpMVP4) tested by semiquantitative PCR and real-time PCR are shown in Figure

ingestion of a blood meal. This mirrors what is seen by the
sequence abundance of the cDNA library, in which only
one sequence of PpMVP2 was observed in the sugar-fed
cDNA library. The remaining sequences were contributed
by the cDNA library produced from blood-fed sandflies.
Pptryp1 low and Pptryp4 high transcript abundance, were
in accordance with the results of previously published
endpoint reverse-transcriptase PCR [13]. Additionally, the
previously characterised chitinase molecule, PpChit1, was
identified in cluster 243 and produced by three sequences
contributed by the blood-fed cDNA library with none
present in the sugar-fed cDNA library. The mRNA expression levels of PpChit1 peak at 72 hours post blood-meal
ingestion [15].
Comparative analysis of transcripts significantly differs
from the blood-fed and L. major-infected midgut cDNA
libraries
During its development within the midgut of the sandfly,
Leishmania is faced with various potential barriers that
may prevent the establishment of the infection. Among
such potential barriers are digestive proteases (trypsins
and chymotrypsins), the peritrophic matrix and the
requirement for parasite attachment to the midgut epithe-

lia to prevent excretion of parasites with remnants of the
digested blood. Previous data suggested that Leishmania
is able to downregulate proteolytic activity in the sandfly
midgut [4]. Also, chitinases produced either by the sandfly
[15] or by the Leishmania [27] facilitates parasites in the
escape from the peritrophic matrix. Attachment to the
midgut epithelia occurs via the presence of L. major lipophosphoglycan receptors, such as PpGalec [1] or, in the
case of permissive sandflies, via the presence of midgut
glycoproteins bearing terminal N-acetyl-galactosamine
[28].
In sandflies, only a handful of midgut proteins have been
clearly implicated in Leishmania development. Previous
data indicated that Leishmania is able to manipulate the
activity of certain digestive proteases, inhibiting or delaying their peak activity, possibly in order to survive the pro-

teolytic attack it faces in the midgut of the vector [3,27].
We hypothesized that a blood meal containing L. major
will affect the expression profile of midgut transcripts
altering the abundance of the different transcripts in each
of these cDNA libraries. Table 4 shows the results of the
chi-square analysis when transcripts from the blood-fed
and L. major-infected blood-fed cDNA libraries were compared. Of interest, the abundance of transcripts coding for
proteolytic enzymes were dramatically decreased in the
midgut cDNA library of sandflies fed on L. major-infected
blood. Additionally, other transcripts that also appear to
have their number reduced included those coding for
microvilli-associated like proteins and peritrophins. Transcripts such as the one corresponding to PpTryp1 (trypsin
1) and one corresponding to PpPer2 (peritrophin 2) were
more abundant. Other transcripts coding for unknown
proteins were also less abundant in the L. major-infected
cDNA library than in the blood-fed cDNA library. These
data suggest that the parasite may be affecting the expression profile of these transcripts and this inhibition, particularly of proteolytic enzymes, may be advantageous for
the survival and establishment of the parasite in the midgut of the sandfly.

analysis provides a powerful global approach as demonstrated by the repertoire of molecules identified from a
whole organism or from a specific tissue and the generation of new hypotheses from these data. Large scale
genome analyses benefit from data generated from transcriptome analyses, for example, by aiding in the annotation of exons and introns.
The results of the present work provide insights into the
repertoire of the molecules present in the midgut of the
sandfly P. papatasi, the natural vector of L. major. We identified a variety of molecules and obtained high quality,
full-length sequences from many of them. The high quality sequences were deposited at NCBI, significantly augmenting the available midgut-specific coding sequences.
A large number of non-annotated sequences were deposited in the EST database for the scientific communities to
access these transcripts.
The global changes in sandfly midgut expression profile
were assessed by comparing data generated from randomly sequenced midgut cDNA clones obtained from
cDNA libraries of adult females fed on sugar only, blood
or blood with the addition of L. major. Our approach
allowed for the identification of transcripts that are
induced by blood feeding and likely participate in the
digestion of the blood meal and events leading to egg production. Digestion of blood as a nutritional source is complicated by the cellular and molecular response and
components of the blood itself, once ingested by the
insect vector. Transcripts identified in the P. papatasi midgut, such as ferritin, Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors,
and GST, are examples of the molecules identified on the
gut of this insect. Additionally, the inclusion of a L. majorinfected midgut cDNA library provides insight into genes
potentially regulated by this parasite during its development within the sandfly midgut. The random sequencing
approach followed by the in silico analysis of the transcript
abundance was supported by experimental analyses
obtained via real-time PCR.

Conclusion
Development of Leishmania within its sand fly host is
largely restricted to the vector midgut. Within the midgut
Leishmania begins its development confined within a peritrophic matrix and is subjected to the onslaught of digestive enzymes. Later, they attach to the epithelia to prevent
excretion with remnants of the blood meal and detach as
they develop into the infective metacyclic form before
being transmitted to a suitable host during a subsequent
blood meal. The sandfly midgut presents a number of biological barriers the Leishmania parasite must circumnavigate or defeat to proliferate and develop inside the insect
vector. Acquiring a better understanding of the molecules
present in this organ will illuminate the potential molecular interactions occurring between the Leishmania parasite and the sandfly vector. Comparative transcriptome

Overall, this analysis will contribute to the understanding
of the molecular interactions between Leishmania and the
sandfly vector and may open new avenues for basic
research towards the control of this neglected vectorborne disease.

Methods
Sandflies
Phlebotomus papatasi sandflies (Saudi Arabia strain) were
obtained from colonies maintained at Walter Reed Army
Institute for Research (WRAIR) and at NIAID-NIH. Three
to 5-day old female sandflies were fed either on 20%
sucrose solution (sugar fed) or on BALB/c mouse whole
blood, via artificial meals [1], with or without the addition of 2 × 10 6L. major (V1 strain) amastigotes per ml.
Messenger RNA extraction and cDNA library construction
Phlebotomus papatasi female midguts (10 midguts) were
dissected from sugar fed only, from blood fed at 6 h (6
midguts), 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post blood meal PBM (5
midguts each) and from L. major-infected at 16 h (3 midguts), 22 h and 96 h (5 midguts each) post infection (p.i.).
For blood-fed and for L. major-infected, groups of midguts
were pooled for RNA extraction. Pooling was done for the
sugar-fed group as well. Messenger RNA was purified with
the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen-Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 100 ng of mRNA was
used to produce a first strand cDNA. A cDNA library,
enriched for full-length cDNA, was synthesized using the
SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). One microgram of double
stranded DNA for each original library (sugar-fed, bloodfed, L. major-infected) was fractionated using a Chromaspin 1000 column (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain
View, CA) into small (S), medium (M) and large (L) transcripts based upon their electrophoresis profile on a 1.1%
agarose gel. Pooled fractions were ligated into Lambda
TriplEx2 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and packaged into lambda phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Individual libraries were plated on LB agar plates in order to
achieve roughly 200–300 plaques per 182 mm plates.
Random sequencing
Unidirectional sequencing of randomly selected clones
was completed as previously described [10]. Single, isolated plaques were picked from the plate using sterile
wooden sticks and placed into 70 µl of water. Amplification of the cDNA was performed using Platinum PCR
SuperMix (Invitrogen), 4 µl template, and primers PT2F1
(AAG TAC TCT AGC AAT TGT GAG C) and PT2R1 (CTC
TTC GCT ATT ACG CCA GCT G). PCR amplification products were cleaned using either. Multiscreen PCR cleaning
plates (Millipore) or Edge Biosystems PCR cleaning plates
and three washes with ultra pure water. The cleaned PCR
product was resuspended in 25 µl of water of which 4 µl

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/300

were used for cycle sequencing with PT2F3 primer (TCT
CGG GAA GCG CGC CAT TGT) and either DTCS reaction
kit (Beckman) or Big Dye 3.1 (Applied Biosystems).
Sequencing reaction products were cleaned using Sephadex G-50 (GE Healthcare) in a multiscreen cleaning plate
(Millipore) and analysed using either CEQ8000 (Beckman Coulter) or ABI3700 (Applied Biosystems) DNA
sequencing instrument.
Bioinformatic analysis
Detailed description of the bioinformatic analysis of the
data appear in [10,29]. Briefly, prior to analysis the vector
sequence was removed from the cDNA nucleotide
sequences. Sequence data from the three libraries were
grouped together and aligned to generate clusters of contiguous sequences or contigs based on 90% homology
over 90 nucleotides, after sequences with more than 5%
Ns were discarded. Three frame translations of the consensus sequence of each contig were subjected to comparison
using the appropriate BLAST algorithm to the NCBI nonredundant protein database, conserved domain database
[30] which contains the eukaryotic clusters of orthologous
groups (COG), Simple Modular Architecture Tool
(SMART) and Protein Family Database (Pfam), and the
Gene Ontology database [31]. Nucleotide sequences were
directly compared with two customised databases, mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleotide databases using BlastN. Determination of the presence of a
signal secretion peptide or transmembrane helices was
accomplished by the submission of sequence peptides to
the SignalP server [32] or TMHMM server [33], respectively. The L. longipalpis BLAST server was utilized to determine homology between the P. papatasi clusters and L.
longipalpis ESTs [34]. The number of transcripts each
library contributed to a particular contig was derived
using a custom program, Count Libraries (JMC Ribeiro,
personal communication). Comparisons between the
sugar-fed and blood-fed midgut cDNA sequences and
comparisons between blood-fed and L. major-infected
midgut cDNA sequences were based on separate Chisquare analysis [35]. The grouped and assembled
sequences, BLAST results and signal peptide results were
combined in an Excel spreadsheet and the putative function, if any was manually verified and annotated.
Sequences were aligned using Clustal X, version 1.83, and
converted to graphical aligned sequences using BioEdit,
version 7.0.5.3 [36]. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted
on amino acid alignments using TREE-PUZZLE, version
5.2, generating trees by maximum likelihood using quartet puzzling to calculate node support [37].
Quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in selected
clones using the first-strand cDNA, obtained from 100 ng
total RNA isolated from midguts dissected from P. papatasi

females fed on sugar (unfed) or dissected after a blood
meal (24–72 h post blood meal or PBM). cDNAs were
synthesized using the 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, San Diego CA). Transcript levels were measured
with SYBR green dye using a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany). For qPCR reactions, samples were subjected to an initial holding step at 95°C for
15 minutes, followed by an amplification step consisting
of 35 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds, 54°C for 20 seconds
and 72°C for 20 seconds with a single acquisition. The
reaction continued with a single-cycle melting step of
95°C for 10 seconds, 67°C for 30 seconds and 95°C for
10 seconds, prior to cooling for 1 minute. Equal amounts
of cDNA were amplified using gene-specific primer sets
targeting individual transcripts as well as a P. papatasi
alpha tubulin, as control or reference transcript. Reactions
were routinely done in duplicate. The relative expression
ratio of the target transcript and control or reference transcript (fold over control) was calculated using the LightCycler relative quantification software (Roche).
Semi-quantitative PCR
Semi quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed with
selected transcripts to further demonstrate the differential
expression of these genes in P. papatasi midgut. In this
case, 100 ng of total RNA isolated from midguts dissected
from P. papatasi females fed on sugar (unfed) or dissected
after a blood meal (48 h PBM) were used to synthesize a
cDNA using the 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were carried out by an initial hot start
at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for
30 seconds, 54°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1.5 minutes
and a final extension cycle of 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR
products were separated on 1.5% agarose.
