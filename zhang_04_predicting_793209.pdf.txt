Protein-protein interactionprotein complexdecision treedata integrationmachine learning

Abstract
Background: Identifying all protein-protein interactions in an organism is a major objective of
proteomics. A related goal is to know which protein pairs are present in the same protein complex.
High-throughput methods such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and affinity purification coupled with
mass spectrometry (APMS) have been used to detect interacting proteins on a genomic scale.
However, both Y2H and APMS methods have substantial false-positive rates. Aside from highthroughput interaction screens, other gene- or protein-pair characteristics may also be informative
of physical interaction. Therefore it is desirable to integrate multiple datasets and utilize their
different predictive value for more accurate prediction of co-complexed relationship.
Results: Using a supervised machine learning approach – probabilistic decision tree, we integrated
high-throughput protein interaction datasets and other gene- and protein-pair characteristics to
predict co-complexed pairs (CCP) of proteins. Our predictions proved more sensitive and specific
than predictions based on Y2H or APMS methods alone or in combination. Among the top
predictions not annotated as CCPs in our reference set (obtained from the MIPS complex
catalogue), a significant fraction was found to physically interact according to a separate database
(YPD, Yeast Proteome Database), and the remaining predictions may potentially represent
unknown CCPs.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that the probabilistic decision tree approach can be successfully
used to predict co-complexed protein (CCP) pairs from other characteristics. Our top-scoring
CCP predictions provide testable hypotheses for experimental validation.

Background
Proteins are the major executors of the genetic program.
Many proteins participate in cellular processes as members of protein complexes of varying size. It is believed
that combinatorial interactions among proteins serve as
an important basis for the biological complexity of higher

organisms [1]. Therefore, increased knowledge about protein-protein interactions and protein complexes will
greatly aid our understanding of protein function.
In recent years, there have been several large-scale efforts
to map protein-protein interactions in yeast. The yeast

two-hybrid (Y2H) system [2,3] detects both transient and
stable interactions. However, it suffers from high falsepositive rate due to a number of factors such as fortuitous
activation of reporter genes and self-activating "bait" proteins. False negatives are also inherent in the yeast twohybrid system because of insufficient depth of screening,
misfolding in the fusion proteins that abrogates the interactions, and use of full-length proteins that may mask
interactions [3,4]. In addition, both "bait" and "prey" proteins are over-expressed in the nucleus, so interactions
detected may not be physiologically relevant [5], while
certain interactions, for example, those involving membrane proteins and those requiring ancillary non-nuclear
factors, may be undetectable [4]. Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (APMS) has also been used
to identify components of protein complexes on a large
scale [6,7]. Protein interactions identified in this way are
more likely to be physiological, especially when tagged
"bait" proteins are expressed under endogenous promoters [6]. Yet APMS is also subject to experimental error.
Epitope tags may disable some protein interactions.
Weakly associated components may dissociate and escape
detection. Complexes containing transmembrane proteins are poorly detected while other condition-specific
interactions may be missed [5]. Considering only interactions supported by more than one type of high-throughput evidence improves accuracy, but sacrifices sensitivity
[5]. Therefore, more sophisticated methods are required
to appropriately combine different high-throughput
experimental datasets.
Integrating information beyond direct measurement of
protein interactions could potentially improve the quality
of protein interaction data as well. It has been shown that
two proteins with similar mRNA expression profiles are
more likely to interact with each other [8-12] (reviewed in
[13]). Subcellular localization of proteins also provides
information, since two interacting proteins usually reside
in the same subcellular compartment [5,14,15]. Many
other characteristics of a gene or protein pair might also
have predictive value [16]. Although each characteristic
alone may contain only limited information about

whether a protein pair is co-complexed, many characteristics considered in combination may be more predictive.
Previously, there have been several efforts in integrating
heterogeneous biological data types. Earlier studies
addressed the question in a semi-manual and heuristic
manner [17,18]. More recently, the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) algorithm has been applied to learning
gene functions from two data types [19], which performs
the task in an automated fashion. Bayesian networks have
also been used to combine heterogeneous data sources
[20,21], and King et al. predicted gene function and
knockout phenotype from patterns of annotation using a
probabilistic decision tree approach [22,23]. Probabilistic
decision trees provide confidence levels of the predictions,
as does Bayesian networks. In addition, the decision tree
presents all the rules used in the prediction, making it easily interpretable which attribute combinations are most
informative. When combining multiple biological data
sources, learning the contributions of different attribute
combinations can greatly help us to gain insight of the
underlying biological relationships, and therefore probabilistic decision trees represent an appropriate approach
for this task.
Here we focused on the prediction of co-complexed protein (CCP) pairs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and employed
a probabilistic decision tree approach to integrate many
gene- and protein-pair characteristics (see Table 1 and 2
for a summary and Additional file 1 for a complete list). A
CCP pair is defined as a pair of proteins that belong to the
same protein complex. Based on a training set, a probabilistic decision tree was generated and used to score protein
pairs in a test set. High-scoring protein pairs by this
approach represent predicted CCPs. Predictions were
assessed by cross-validation according to a reference set
based on the MIPS (Munich Information center for Protein Sequences) complex catalogue [24,25]. Furthermore,
top-scoring protein pairs not listed in MIPS as being cocomplexed were validated by another database, YPD
(Yeast Proteome Database) [26], at a significantly higher
rate than expected by chance.

Results
We sought to combine a wide range of gene- and proteinpair characteristics using probabilistic decision trees to
predict which protein pairs belong to the same complex.
The approach was tested on the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which extensive genomic and proteomic
information is available. Data were obtained for a total of
467 gene- or protein-pair attributes, which were organized
hierarchically and fell into 9 major categories (see Table 1
for a summary and Additional file 1 for more details). A
reference set of 8707 CCPs was obtained from annotated
protein complexes in MIPS [25]. We chose this literaturederived reference set as our "gold standard" because of its
high reliability, but we note that this reference set is still
imperfect since it reflects investigational bias that may
lead us to predict fewer CCPs between uncharacterized
proteins.
Probabilistic decision tree
To model the conditional probability that a protein pair is
co-complexed given its other known attributes, we constructed a probabilistic decision tree using all protein
pairs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and all attributes listed in
Table 1. The decision tree successively partitioned protein
pairs according to the values (0 or 1) of their particular
attributes. The structure of the tree was learned automatically, and the attribute used to define each successive partition was the attribute providing the greatest reduction of
entropy with respect to the CCP attribute (see Methods
section). Figure 1 shows the decision tree constructed
using all attributes described in Table 1. Some of the rules
specified in the decision tree capture biological knowledge about co-complexed proteins. For example, protein
pairs in one high-scoring node (Figure 1, green arrowhead) are annotated with the attributes "TAP, 'spoke'
model (I_APMS.TAP.spoke)" and "gene neighborhood
(N)", which is consistent with the fact that the TAP study
screens for protein complexes at a large scale [6], and the
observation that proteins with conserved gene neighborhood are more likely to interact [5].

The attribute "bound by Fhl1p, p < 0.001
(R_p001.FHL1)", describing putative regulation of genes
by the transcription factor Fhl1p according to chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments, was chosen to make

the first partition (shown as the root node in Figure 1),
since this attribute yielded the greatest reduction in
entropy. One might wonder why it is more informative
than high-throughput screens designed to assess proteinprotein interactions. Note that our attribute selection criterion – conditional information gain – takes into consideration both accuracy and coverage. Although binding of
Fhl1p does not provide information comprehensive
enough to cover most of the yeast proteome, no existing
evidence type is both very accurate and very comprehensive. Therefore it is not surprising that a relatively accurate
attribute with a fair coverage becomes the winner. Fhl1p
binds to the promoters of 194 genes at a p-value threshold
of 0.001 [27], which translates to 18,721 protein pairs.
This number is comparable to those of the APMS studies
(26,742 for HMS-PCI [7] and 17,314 for TAP [6], and is
significantly higher than those of the Y2H studies (4,475
and 948 [2,3]). A significant portion (3,590 pairs) of the
18,721 protein pairs bound by Fhl1p are annotated as
CCPs in our reference set, which should be regarded as relatively accurate considering the noisiness of the highthroughput interaction datasets. In addition, Fhl1p is
believed to regulate the transcription of genes involved in
rRNA processing [28], and many rRNA processing proteins, together with small nucleolar RNA's (snoRNA's),
form a large RNP complex – the processome [29]. Many
of the genes regulated by Fhl1p are likely to be actually
members of the processome complex, therefore it is reasonable that the attribute "bound by Fhl1p, p < 0.001
(R_p001.FHL1)" came out to be the variable most informative of co-complexed relationships.
Among attributes listed in Table 1, those that individually
provide the greatest reduction in entropy at the root node
are shown in Table 3. To compare this reduction with the
entropy of the node before it is partitioned, we also
describe relative reduction in entropy (defined as the conditional information gain divided by the entropy of the
root node) for the top attributes. Relative reduction in
entropy among the top 20 attributes ranges from 2.0% to
25.7%. Each of the 20 top-scoring protein-pair attributes
shows significant positive correlation with CCP (p < 10-300
by Fisher's Exact Test, with multiple hypotheses adjusted
for using the conservative Bonferroni correction). Most of
these top attributes are from the categories "same tranPage 3 of 15

Decision tree constructed using all protein pairs
Decision tree constructed using all protein pairs. Each leaf node is labeled with the numbers of CCPs and non-CCPs associated
with it, while each internal node is labeled with the attribute (j) used for subsequent partitioning (see Table 4 or Supplementary
Information for descriptions of the attributes). Two edges originate from each internal node, labeled "+" or "-," corresponding
to the daughter nodes that have or do not have attribute j, respectively. Nodes with percentages of CCPs higher than that of
the root node are colored red, while those with lower CCP percentages are blue. The color saturation depends on the relative entropy compared with the root node. The arrowhead size of an edge from a given node approximately represents the
fraction of protein pairs in the parent node assigned to the corresponding daughter node.

"high-throughput screens of interaction." This supports
previous observations that co-complexed proteins are
more likely to have correlated expression profiles and to
have been identified in previous high-throughput interaction screens [5,8,9]. Yet it is worth noting that even

attributes with low relative reduction in entropy at the
root node could potentially be useful when combined
with other attributes. For example, the relative entropy
reduction provided by the attribute "bound by Grf10p, p
< 0.005" at the root node is only 0.0025%, but it is never-

the decision trees, this does not necessarily mean that they
are not informative with regard to CCPs. Absence of an
attribute may simply indicate that the information it provides is at least partially redundant with other attributes
that are used in the tree.
Assessment using cross-validation
We used four-fold cross-validation to score each protein
pair according to its estimated probability of being a CCP
pair. Successively omitting one quarter of all protein pairs,
we generated four decision trees, each very similar to the
one generated using all protein pairs (data not shown). In
the scoring procedure, a protein pair is mapped to a terminal or "leaf" node in the decision tree, whereupon it is
assigned a probability of CCP calculated from the numbers of CCP and non-CCP pairs in the training set that
map to the same leaf node (see Methods section). Truepositive rates (defined as the number of true positives
divided by the total number of trues) and false-positive
rates (defined as the number of false positives divided by
the total number of falses) of the predictions were calculated at a series of score thresholds, and these values were
used to plot a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve, shown in Figure 2 at different resolutions. Note that
a method making random guesses will have an expected

ROC curve on the diagonal (i.e., true-positive rate equals
false-positive rate). Using our probabilistic decision tree
approach, over 78.9% of CCPs are correctly predicted at a
false-positive rate of 1% (Fig. 2B). Because experimentally
testing a large number of protein pairs for CCP is both
time-consuming and costly, predictions with many falsepositives are not practically very useful. Given the ~20
million possibly interacting protein pairs in yeast, even a
false-positive rate of 0.01 is likely to be unacceptable.
Therefore, we focused on the part of our ROC curve where
the false-positive rate is very low (~10-5) (Fig. 2C). Among
the top 83 predictions, 74 are known CCP pairs. At a falsepositive rate of 5.4 × 10-5 (1125 false positives), the truepositive rate is 0.12 (1005 true positives). Different users
of our predictions may have different levels of acceptable
true-positive or false-positive rate. Our ROC curve allows
users to tune predictions to suit their applications.
To assess the contribution of different datasets, we
repeated the training and cross-validation procedures,
successively omitting one category of attributes when constructing the decision trees (Fig. 2 and data not shown).
Judging from the ROC curves, five out of the nine categories have little observable effect on the predictions when
excluded (data not shown), and omission of each of the
remaining four categories – "high-throughput screens
(HTS) of interaction", "correlated mRNA expression",
"same transcriptional regulator" and "sequence homology" – shows modest decrease in performance (Fig. 2).
This indicates that most attributes are at least partially
redundant with one or more attributes in another cate-

gory. It also suggests that many strong predictions of CCP
relationships can be made without direct evidence of
physical interaction.
The MIPS database contains other types of information,
such as protein function, protein class and subcellular
localization, which may also be informative of CCP relationships. However, some of these annotations may be
derived solely from physical interaction evidence, thereby
resulting in circularity. With this substantial caveat in
mind, we repeated training and cross-validation using
attributes from three additional categories – "same subcellular localization (MIPS)", "same function (MIPS)" and
"same protein class (MIPS)" (Table 2). The performance
improves considerably with the addition of these
attributes, with only 108 false positives (false-positive rate
5.2 × 10-6) when 1015 true CCP pairs are predicted (truepositive rate 0.117) (Fig. 2, grey curve). At least part of the
improvement came from non-circular evidence because
not all of these annotations are derived from physical
interactions. In addition, since these attributes can be
used without risk of circularity for protein pairs not
known to physically interact, this all-inclusive tree should
be used to make predictions for such pairs.
To compare decision tree predictions with those of highthroughput experiments, we calculated true-positive and
false-positive rates for predictions made by high-throughput interaction screens (two high-throughput APMS and
two Y2H studies) (Fig. 3A,3B,3C). Because APMS experiments use only a subset of genes as baits and therefore
have not examined all possible protein pairs in the yeast
proteome, we made two separate comparisons considering only protein pairs covered by each of the two APMS
studies (using the "spoke" model, in which only bait-prey
protein pairs are considered [30]) (Fig. 3B,3C). Comparison of the ROC curves shows that the decision tree
approach based on a wide variety of evidence types is
superior to any single high-throughput method (Fig.
3A,3B,3C). In addition, we compared our predictions
with simple combinations of experimental evidence
types. Since we are more concerned about predictions

with low false-positive rates, we then focused on predictions supported by at least two high-throughput studies
(Fig. 3A). Two other ROC curves are also plotted, one for
decision tree predictions using only the four highthroughput interaction datasets and the other for
predictions using all attributes together with attributes
from the three additional categories "same function
(MIPS)" and "same protein class (MIPS)" and "same subcellular localization (MIPS)" (Fig. 3A,3B,3C). The decision tree approach using only high-throughput
interaction datasets yields slightly better predictions than
those generated by simple combinations of the same four
datasets, and furthermore is more "tunable" to a desired
true-positive or false-positive rate. Prediction success of
the decision tree approach improves considerably after
adding other genomic and proteomic information.
Assessment based on the Yeast Proteome Database (YPD)
Having demonstrated the success of our approach using
cross-validation, we went further to see if we could predict
CCPs not in the MIPS reference set. Among protein pairs
not known to be CCP in the reference set, the top-scoring
ones (predicted using all attributes in Table 1) were further examined. Since our reference set may not contain all
known CCPs, especially the recently identified ones, some
of these "false positives" might have already been tested
and shown to be true CCPs. We searched for evidence of
co-complexed relationships for these 50 "false positives"
in a separate database, YPD [26]. YPD contains literaturebased protein complex annotations and was not used as a
data source in building our decision trees. We excluded
YPD complexes for which interaction evidence comes
solely from the high-throughput experiments used in our
decision tree. Out of the top 50 "false positives," 15 are
annotated in YPD as members of the same complex and
are therefore true CCPs (Table 5, also see Table 1S in Additional file 2 for a longer list). This cannot be solely
accounted for by the additional CCP annotations in YPD,
because if the 50 protein pairs are randomly chosen
among non-CCP pairs according to MIPS, the probability
of seeing 15 or more pairs annotated with CCP in YPD is
very low (p < 10-35 by Fisher's Exact Test). We also com-

the dataset of interest but are non-CCP in MIPS. By this
measure, our approach showed slightly better performance than the TAP study alone (p = 0.2), and significantly
outperformed the HMS-PCI study alone (p = 2 × 10-11).
As a comparison, we also performed the opposite experiment – using CCPs annotated in YPD as the gold standard
in decision tree prediction. Cross-validation performance
was comparable to that obtained using the MIPS reference
set (Figure 1S in Additional file 3). Using the same falsepositive rate threshold of 5 × 10-5, predictions based on
MIPS and YPD overlap by more than one third. Such an
overlap is highly significant considering the size of the
yeast proteome (p < 10-269 by Fisher's Exact Test), indicating that our approach is robust with regard to the gold
standard used. Among the top-scoring 50 protein pairs
not in the YPD reference set, 11 of them are annotated as
CCPs in MIPS, comparable to the results shown earlier
(15 out of 50). This is again highly significant (p < 10-28 by
Fisher's Exact Test) given the null hypothesis that the 50
protein pairs are randomly chosen from non-CCP pairs
according to YPD.

Discussion
Using a probabilistic decision tree approach, we were able
to integrate a large number of gene- or protein-pair characteristics to predict co-complexed pairs of proteins.
When evaluated by cross-validation, our method yielded
more sensitive and specific predictions than the highthroughput interaction screens alone or in combination.
However, we note that APMS experiments are not
designed to examine pairwise interactions, and provide
additional information about protein complexes that is
not directly available from our approach. Furthermore, we
do not suggest that interaction screens could be replaced
by our approach. On the contrary, the success of our
approach depends on the integration of such protein
interaction datasets as well as other genomic and proteomic data types.
The reference set of CCPs used in this study derives from
the MIPS complex catalogue [24] and may present a bias
towards well-known proteins. Such a bias, if combined
with attribute data with the same bias, may artificially
inflate the performance in cross-validation. Since all
attributes in Table 1 are from high-throughput or
genome-wide studies, they contain little bias against
unknown proteins. Therefore we expect our results using
only these attributes (Figure 2 and 3, solid black lines, and
Table 5) to accurately reflect the real method performance. The additional attributes listed in Table 2 are from
collections of individual studies, and hence may be biased
towards well-known proteins. As a consequence of such
bias, as well as the potential circularity noted earlier,
results obtained when the additional attributes in Table 2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/38

were included (Figure 2 and 3, grey lines) may be artificially inflated.
One of the merits of the probabilistic decision tree
approach is that for each protein pair, it provides a score
which corresponds to the estimated probability that the
protein pair is co-complexed. The collection of CCP probabilities for all protein pairs constitutes a weighted
network of interactions in which the weight of each edge
is the probability of interaction. Such a probabilistic interaction network presents a starting point for improved ab
initio complex prediction [31].
The probabilistic interaction network can also be used to
identify additional members of existing complexes. For
example, according to the MIPS complex catalogue, the
rRNA processing complex contains 18 proteins (Figure 4).
Six additional proteins were found by our decision tree to
be co-complexed with one or more of these 18 members
with a score threshold of 0.5 (Figure 4). Three of them
(Lcp5p, Mtr3p and Rrp40p) are verified in YPD. For the
other three (Rrp1p, Srp1p and Cbf5p), each of them has
been found to be associated with members of the rRNA
processing complex in multiple affinity purifications in
the high-throughput studies [6,7]. Srp1p binds to nuclear
localization sequences (NLS) in nuclear proteins to bring
them to the nuclear pore complex [32], and therefore its
association with proteins in the complex is more likely to
be transient rather than stable. Cbf5p is involved in multiple uridine to pseudouridine conversions in rRNA [33]
and Rrp1p is involved in maturation of rRNA [34]. Both
of them are likely to be actual members of the rRNA
processing complex. We expect that the probabilities generated here could be used to improve previouslydescribed methods for discovering new members of partially-known protein complexes [35,36].
Decision tree predictions can also be used to stratify individual interactions derived from the high-throughput
datasets by confidence. For each of the four APMS datasets
(TAP spoke, TAP matrix, HMS-PCI spoke and HMS-PCI
matrix), we partitioned the protein pairs based on scores
from decision tree predictions. We found that the fraction
of protein pairs in each subset that are annotated in YPD
is correlated with the score (Figure 5). In general, a higher
percentage of protein pairs are verified in a high-scoring
subset than in a subset with low scores. Hence the score
from decision tree prediction can serve as a good indicator
of our confidence in the interaction and be used to further
discriminate candidate CCP pairs resulting from highthroughput studies.
Integrating error-prone datasets and extracting useful
information is an enormous challenge. For multiple evidence types with high false-positive and low false-negative

rates, an obvious approach is to predict according to the
intersection of all datasets. On the other hand, one might
want to take the union if the evidence types have low
false-positive rates but high false-negative rates. These two
simple methods will be most effective if the evidence
types are "orthogonal" [37], or more precisely, conditionally independent given the truth. However, these two
extremes are not generally applicable in integrating multiple datasets related to protein interactions. Furthermore,
most such datasets are not independent. Given the
heterogeneous nature of various genomic data, it is desirable to develop more effective rules of data integration
that can take into account the different predictive value of
every data source and their combinations. One way to

combine the different features of the datasets is to model
the conditional probability of CCP given all gene- or protein-pair characteristics. A recent study combined evidence from six datasets by dividing protein pairs into 26
subsets according to combinations of evidence types and
estimated error rate for each of them as the fraction of
false positives in the subset [38]. However, such a method
scales poorly as the number of datasets increases because
the number of parameters (i.e. error rates) grows exponentially with the number of attributes, and is therefore
highly prone to over-fitting. Here we took a probabilistic
decision tree approach to tackle the problem. By postpruning the decision trees, we were able to choose features
informative of CCP and avoid over-fitting, and were there-

Scores from decision tree predictions
Figure 5 between scores from decision tree predictions and the fractions verified by YPD
Correlation

fore able to integrate a much larger number of gene- and
protein-pair characteristics. Our method substantially
outperformed the Jansen et al. 2002 approach. (There are
46 true positives and 37 false positives among the top 83
predictions in [38], evaluated on the training set, while
our method, evaluated by cross-validation, predicted 74
true positives among the top 83 predictions.) This
improvement demonstrates the benefit of integrating
diverse data types to predict CCPs.
During the preparation of this manuscript, Jansen et al.
published another related study using naïve Bayes and a
fully-connected Bayesian network to combine multiple
evidence types [20]. The naïve Bayes approach allows
them to incorporate more evidence types than in their
previous study [38], but assumes conditional independ-

ency between the attributes, which they justify by showing
the lack of linear correlation between most of the
attributes used. (But note that conditional independency
does not follow the absence of linear correlation.) The
results, however, are not directly comparable for at least
three reasons. First, they use a "gold-standard" in which
positives are defined by the MIPS complex catalogue (the
same as in our study), but negatives are non-positive protein pairs with different subcellular localizations. This
largely recasts the problem of CCP prediction as the problem of predicting protein pairs that either are co-complexed or share the same subcellular localization, which
over-simplifies the task. Second, due to their choice of
gold-standard negatives, their training set used in crossvalidation is enriched with protein pairs for which both
members have known subcellular localization and in con-

sequence the result does not represent their performance
on the entire yeast proteome. Third, they use functional
annotation to make their predictions, which has the
potential for circularity (e.g., if the function is actually
assigned on the basis of CCP annotation in the "gold
standard") and introduces a strong bias towards wellstudied proteins, both of which may artificially inflate the
performance.

If a protein pair is not annotated with a particular
attribute, it could be because previous study showed that
it does not have the attribute (negative evidence), or
because it has not been examined (absence of evidence).
We did not make any distinction between these two scenarios since this information is typically unavailable. Similarly, no distinction was made between negative evidence
and absence of evidence for CCP annotations.

Conclusions

Cross-validation
All protein pairs were randomly partitioned into four subsets. In each of the four iterations, a probabilistic decision
tree was constructed using training data composed of
three out of the four subsets, successively leaving one out
as the test set. Protein pairs in the test set were then scored
according to the decision tree generated from the corresponding training data.

A probabilistic decision tree approach has been previously
used to predict some characteristics of genes or proteins
(e.g., knockout phenotype and protein function)
[22,23,39]. Here we showed that a similar approach can
also be used to predict a characteristic of protein pairs (i.e.
co-complexed relationship) from other characteristics.
CCP predictions provide testable hypotheses for experimental validation. The estimated CCP probabilities provided by integrating heterogeneous data with
probabilistic decision trees may lead to improved ab initio
complex discovery from interaction data [31] or to more
accurate addition of proteins to partially-known protein
complexes. Predicted CCP membership may also represent functional links between proteins, and therefore aid
the prediction of protein function. This general approach
can be readily applied to other characteristics of gene or
protein pairs and in other organisms as large-scale
genomic and proteomic data becomes available.

Methods
Collecting datasets
We collected 12 major categories of gene- and protein-pair
characteristics for all protein pairs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A summary with references to the data sources is
shown in Table 1 and 2. Each evidence type was mapped
to one or more binary variables ("attributes"). For an evidence type with continuous values (e.g., expression correlation coefficient), a series of alternative thresholds were
used to convert it into several binary attributes. All
attributes were hierarchically organized into a directed
acyclic graph (DAG), with an edge from attribute i to
attribute j indicating that any protein pair annotated with
attribute j is, by logical necessity, also annotated with
attribute i.

A reference set of co-complexed protein pairs was
obtained from the MIPS complex catalogue [24,25] which
provides a relatively complete list of currently known protein complexes in yeast. All protein pairs within the same
complex were recorded as CCPs. Since the MIPS complex
catalogue is organized into a hierarchy of complexes, we
only considered complexes with no annotated sub-complexes. Altogether, our MIPS-derived reference set contains 8707 CCPs collected from a total of 250 complexes.

Generating decision trees
A detailed overview of decision trees and their applications can be found in [40,41]. In our case, we started with
all protein pairs of the training set R in a single root node,
and constructed the decision tree greedily by recursively
partitioning each node N into two daughter nodes based
on the attribute k that gives the greatest reduction in
entropy or, equivalently, the maximal conditional information gain. Let Yk(m) denote whether protein pair m is
annotated with attribute k, and X be the random variable
indicating whether a protein pair is annotated as a CCP. If
node N is partitioned into two nodes N0 and N1 where Nt
= {m ∈ N, Yk(m) = t}, the conditional information gain is
defined as:

HN ( X ) −

∑

t =0,1

Nt
N

HNt ( X ) .

Here |N| represents the number of protein pairs within
node N, and HN(X) is the entropy of X at node N, defined
as -pN log(pN) - (1-pN)log(1-pN), where pN is the probability that a protein pair m ∈ N is annotated as a CCP. We
estimated pN as the fraction of CCPs in node N, using one
pseudocount (with the same CCP distribution as the
entire training set R) for small-sample-size regularization.
A tree generated in the above fashion risks over-fitting the
training data. The standard approach to combat this is
post-pruning – pruning away some of the branches after
the tree is grown [41]. We used the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) for model selection during pruning, as
previously described [22]. After the tree was fully grown,
we started from the leaves and pruned away any branch
whose removal decreased the tree's BIC score. Such pruning dramatically reduced the size of the tree, hence the
number of parameters, and avoided over-fitting the training data.

Scoring for co-complexed protein pairs
Protein pairs in each test set were scored according to the
decision tree generated from the corresponding training
set. Starting from the root node, the decision tree prescribes a series of binary questions for any given protein
pair. All questions are of the form "Does the protein pair
have attribute j?" Which question is asked depends on the
answer to the previous question. After each question, the
protein pair is assigned to one of the two daughter nodes,
based upon whether or not it is annotated with attribute
j. In the end, the protein pair is located to a leaf node N.
The score of the protein pair is then the estimated
probability pN that a protein pair m ∈ N is annotated with
CCP, as described above.
