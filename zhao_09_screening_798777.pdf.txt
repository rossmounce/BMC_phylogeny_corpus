Abstract
Background: Swine hepatitis E virus (swHEV) is a zoonotic disease that is considered a major
problem in pig production and presents a threat to human health. Elucidation of the major antigenic
epitopes of swHEV is essential for the effective control of swHEV epidemics.
Results: By bioinformatic analysis, we identified and then synthesized 12 peptides from open
reading frames (ORFs) ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3, including swHEV-1 - swHEV-12. Using the results
from ELISA, we selected swHEV-11 as the best candidate antigen and used it as a coating antigen
for the development of peptide-based swine anti-HEV ELISA kits. The coefficient of variation (CV)
the coefficient of variation (CV) varied between 4.3-7.2% in the same batch, and between 8.2-17.7%
in six different batches. When comparing our swine peptide-based kit with the commercial
recombinant-based kit, the humane anti-HEV IgG test had a 73.4% correspondence rate for them.
Conclusion: This is the first systemic study to screen the diagnostic peptides of swHEV and our
findings strongly suggest that peptide swHEV-11 is a potent diagnostic reagent of swHEV that could
be used in the development of highly efficient diagnostic assays for the specific and highly sensitive
detection of anti-HEV activity in swine serum samples.

Background
Swine hepatitis E virus (swHEV) was discovered in pigs in
the USA in 1997 [1], and it has since been demonstrated
that there is potential for the zoonotic transmission and
cross-species transmission between humans and pigs [2].
Based on phylogenetic analysis, swHEV genotypes 3 and 4
contain genomic sequences closely related to human HEV
[3,4]. To date, swHEV infection has been documented in
a number of provinces and municipalities in China [5],
and is considered a major problem in pig production and

a threat to human health. There is therefore a real need for
specific and effective methods of diagnosis, prophylaxis
and treatment for this disease.
The antigenic structure of the related human HEV virus
has been studied in detail. Several antigenic regions of
diagnostic relevance were found within the open reading
frames (ORFs) ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3, using a range of
different sized synthetic peptides [6-10] or recombinant
proteins [11-13]. Three of the seven peptides encoded by

ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 of human HEV were found to be
immunogenic [14]. pB166, comprising overlapping
recombined peptides from ORF2, is a neutralization
epitope that has the potential to be used in the development of vaccines to prevent human HEV [15]. The peptide
comprising 11 amino acids from the C-terminus of
human HEV-virus-like particles (HEV-VLP) is immunogenic [16], and can be used to elicit antibodies.
Some preliminary studies have investigated the antigenic
epitopes of swHEV. Solid-phase peptide synthesis was
used to generate peptides from swHEV ORF2, and this
report provided a useful method for the detection of
swHEV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues [17].
However, the antigenic structure of swHEV is yet to be
fully investigated. The research on swHEV has been limited mainly to local epidemiological studies and simple
clinical analysis of animals. The commercially available
kits to detect swHEV are the same as the kits used to detect
human HEV. Despite the fact that there is high homology
between the genomic sequences of swHEV and human
HEV, there are still important differences and minor
changes could affect the sensitivity and specificity of the
diagnostic test when applied to animals. Therefore, the
results obtained from using a human HEV epitope to
detect swHEV are not very satisfactory.
In this study, we analyzed antigens of HEV using the DNA
Star software. Twelve peptides were found to be synthesized from the three ORFs. Based on the results of ELISA
tests, we selected peptides that displayed antigenicity, of
which peptide swHEV-11 was the best candidate. We then
used this antigenic peptide as a coating antigen to develop
an ELISA kit for the rapid diagnosis of swHEV. The results
from this study suggest that peptide swHEV-11 is an effective diagnostic reagent that can be used in the development of more efficient diagnostic assays for the detection
of anti-HEV activity in swine serum samples.

Results
Examination of the Swine sera specimens
The sera collected from a Shanghai abattoir were confirmed using a commercial human anti-HEV kit (Beijing
WANTAI Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co. Ltd.). We
detected sera that were positive for swHEV IgG and IgM
antibodies and sera that were negative for swHEV IgG and
IgM antibodies. In this experiment, we identified six negative sera and 110 positive sera.
Hydrophobicity and secondary structure of HEV proteins
and identification of synthetic peptides
The analysis of hydrophobicity and the prediction of secondary structure for HEV non-structural (ORF1) and
structural (ORF2 and ORF3) proteins predicted that certain regions have stronger antigenicity (Figure 1), even

though the potential antigenic epitopes were widely distributed along the entire amino acid sequence. Twelve
areas were chosen across the 3 ORFs and peptide
sequences were designed based on the parameters of
hydrophobicity, B-turn and B-sheet secondary structures.
These 12 fragments of swHEV peptides were then synthesized.
The synthesized HEV peptides were purified further by
preparative HPLC. Figure 2 shows the purity profile of
synthetic HEV peptide, swHEV-11, which had a value of
96.7%. The amino acid composition analyses of these
peptides proved to be consistent with their expected values.
Selection and Confirmation of peptides
The immunoreactivity of the synthetic peptides with
swHEV serum specimens demonstrated that eight of the
peptides: swHEV-2 and swHEV-3 (from ORFl), swHEV-5
and swHEV-7 (from ORF2), swHEV-9, swHEV-10,
swHEV-11 and swHEV-12 (from ORF3), had antigenicity
against IgG antibody. These eight peptides detected 17,
19, 11, 14, 18, 13, 21 and 21 positive references, respectively, out of 24 positive sera (Table 1). The positive rates
of these references were 70.8, 79.2, 45.8, 58.3, 75.0, 54.2,
87.5 and 87.5%, respectively. The eight peptides also
detected 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 6 and 4 negative references, respectively, out of six negative sera, and the rates detected were
50, 66.7, 83.3, 66.7, 50, 83.3, 100 and 66.7%, respectively

detected 4, 5, 3, 0, 6, 6, 5, 5 and 3 positive references,
respectively, out of 24 positive references (Table 2).

Reproducibility of the synthetic peptide-based test kits
Swine serum samples with anti-HEV IgG and IgM reactivity, were used for checking the reproducibility of this peptide-based swine anti-HEV ELISA kits. On analysis of
reproducibility of the anti-HEV IgG test kit, the coefficient
of variation (CV) varied between 4.3-7.2% in the same

From all the above data, we confirmed swHEV-11 as the
most antigenic of the 12 peptides and used this peptide in
further studies.

Comparison of synthetic peptide-based kit torecombinantbased kit
In a parallel experiment, 94 swine serum samples were
used to compare the the peptide-based swine anti-HEV
ELISA kits with the recombinant-based kit. The results
indicated that 69 (including 64 positive and five negative)
of the 94 samples (73.4%) were detected identically by
anti-HEV IgG antibodies by both kits (Table 4), whereas
34 (including 29 positive and five negative) of the 94 samples (36.2%) were detected identically by anti-HEV IgM
antibodies by both kits (Table 5).

However, when compared the KHB kit (HRP-goat anti-pig
IgG for 1:6000) with the recombinant-based kit from
WANTAI, Beijing, the results indicated that 55 (including
50 positive and 5 negative) of 94 samples were identical
in terms of both kits by the detection of anti-HEV IgG,
with 58.5% of correspondence rate for anti-HEV IgG test
(Table 6). We also compared the peptide-based kit with
the KHB kit (HRP-goat anti-pig IgG for 1:6000). The

results indicated that 55 (including 40 positive and 5 negative) of 94 samples were identical in terms of both kits by
the detection of anti-HEV IgG, with 47.9% of correspondence rate for anti-HEV IgG test (Table 7).
Application of the peptide-based kit in the detection of
HEV infection
The peptide-based swine anti-HEV ELISA kit was used to
test 1564 swine specimens. 1142 of the 1564 swine serum
samples (72.9%) were found to be positive for anti-HEV
IgG antibodies (data not shown). The results demonstrated that the peptide-based anti-HEV ELISA kit is of
high specificity in the detection of serum anti-HEV.

Discussion
Detection of anti-HEV antibodies have shown that several
animal species, including pigs and rodents, have high
infection rates of HEV [18,19]. The seropositive rate was
82.5% in sows, 53.9% in 4- to 6-month-old swine, 63.4%
in 1- to 3-month-old swine, with an overall rate of 55.7%
for swine in an abattoir in eastern China [20].
The availability of swHEV detection assays that are sensitive and specific are essential for the swine industry and
for research purposes. Serological diagnosis of HEV is
more specific and robust than diagnosis via RNA detection [21]. The main problem with PCR detection of HEV

is that, usually, viremia shedding in faeces is short-lasting
and therefore the opportunity to detect the virus is limited. In animals, other samples where the virus could be
detected more easily, such as the liver or bile, are most
often only available in post-mortem. For this reason, serological tests such as ELISA are widely used [19].
The major antigenic epitopes of HEV located in ORF2 and
ORF3 [8,11,22], should be the ideal diagnostic reagents of
HEV detection [23]. A previous study used gene-I fulllength HEV ORF3 antigenic protein in ELISA and detect
HEV reference serum, the results of IgG antibody tests
showed levels of sensitivity and specificity consistent with
the national requirements [24]. These results were better
than those obtained with Genelab reagents to detect clinical serum.
With the cloning of the Burmese and Mexican isolates of
HEV [25-27], it is now possible to analyze the hydrophobicity and to predict the secondary structures of putative
human HEV proteins [6,8,11]. On that basis, we selectively synthesized a set of 12 peptides from swHEV
according to the sequence of strain swCh25 [28], a Chinese Xinjiang isolate, and used them to develop the peptide-based ELISA kits for the detection of swine anti-HEV.

The findings that the diagnostic test using IgG anti-HEV
was more effective at screening for acute HEV than the
diagnostic test using IgM anti-HEV [29], and that the short
duration of anti-HEV IgM antibodies in serum occurs only
from late incubation periods to early acute phases of the
disease, resulted in the test system for the detection of
anti-HEV IgG being regarded as the most effective
approach for immunodiagnosis of HEV infection [14].

Tests on the reproducibility of the synthetic peptide-based
test kits suggest that the anti-HEV ELISA kits appear to be
both stable and reliable. A series of experiments were carried out to assess the accuracy of the kits and to compare
them with the recombinant-based kits, after first determining the cut-off values for the evaluation of the test
results. The commercial kit detected human IgG, IgM and
IgA, while our peptide-based kit detected IgG only, so the
rate of detection of positive serum by our kit was lower
than that of the commercial kit. Some specimens were
reactive with more recombinant antigens than synthetic
peptides, which may have been due to false positives
obtained with ELISA using recombinant antigens or due
to false negatives obtained with synthetic peptide ELISA
resulting from conformational differences [23]. The KHB
kit is used to detect human HEV, so the results are not very
consistent with peptide-based kit in this experiment. The
commercial kit was inefficient for the serodiagnosis of
animals due to poor sensitivity [19]. In comparison,
results with our peptide-based ELISA kit suggest that it is
as good as the recombinant-based kit, and can be used for
serodiagnosis of swHEV infection. Our peptide-based kit
is sensitive and attains the requirements for clinical diagnostic use.

Conclusion
The results obtained in this study strongly suggest that the
peptide swHEV-11 from ORF3 is a potent diagnostic reagent of swHEV and can be used as a diagnostic target for
the development of highly efficient prototype diagnostic
assays for the specific and sensitive detection of anti-HEV
activity in swine serum samples. The study of the swHEV11 epitope might not only provide an efficient way to
develop a kit to detect swHEV rapidly and accurately, but
might also be applied to the development of vaccines for
swHEV to control the spread of HEV and the prevention
of this virus passing from pigs to humans. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic study to screen the diagnostic peptides of swHEV and is also the first demonstration
that swHEV-11 from ORF3 could be used as a specific and
highly sensitive diagnostic reagent.

Synthesized Peptides and reagents
Peptides consisting of the antigens swHEV-1-4 from
ORF1, swHEV-5-7 from ORF2 and swHEV-8-12 from
ORF3, were synthesized by GL-Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai,
China), the WANTAI kit (Beijing WANTAI Biological
Pharmacy Enterprise Co. Ltd., China) (Table 8) and strain
swCh25 sequence [GenBank: AY594199] of swine HEV.
Swine sera specimens
Swine blood was collected from an abattoir in Shanghai
(China) and centrifuged to isolate the sera. The sera were
then confirmed using a commercial anti-HEV kit (Beijing
WANTAI Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co. Ltd.). We
detected positive sera which were also positive for swHEV
IgG and IgM antibodies, and negative sera which were
also negative for swHEV IgG and IgM antibodies. Sera
were stored at 4°C for later use.
Computer analysis and chemical synthesis of HEVencodingproteins
The antigenic structures relating to the sequences of HEV
peptides from each ORF were analyzed using DNAStar
software (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and the hydrophilicity, surface tenacity, helix of the Chou-Fasman, lamellar
and reverse turn, secondary structure of the Robson-Garnier and C- and N- termini of the protein and polypeptide
amino acid sequences, and the Antigenic Index (AI) were

Coating and blocking of synthetic peptides
Synthetic peptides were diluted with a coating buffer
(0.05 mol/l carbonate solution, pH 9.6), to a final concentration of 3 μg/ml. We added 100 μl of coating buffer
to each microwell of a microtiter plate and plates were
incubated at 4°C for at least 12 h. The microtiter plates
were then blocked with 200 μ1 of tris-buffered saline
(TBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Plates were then rinsed and
dried for later use.
Anti-HEV ELISA and calculation of cut-off values
In each peptide-coated microwell, 100 μl of TBST containing 1% BSA and 10 μl (or 1 μl for IgM) of swine sera specimen, were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The
microwells were washed five times with TBST. Then 100 μl

BSA) were added as detection antibodies (Immunology
Consultants Laboratory, Inc., Newberg, USA.) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing the microwells five
times, color was developed by the addition of 100 μl per
well of a substrate solution containing 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and H2O2. After a 10-min incubation

(ODs) were measured at 450 nm.
In this experiment, we used negative sera, which had been
detected using the WANTAI kit, as a negative control. Typically, the cutoff value, expressed as the P/N ratio, where P
represents the optical density value at 450 nm of the
experimental serum and N represents the optical density
value at 450 nm of the negative controls, was established
using ELISA analysis software Ezy-immuno and was equal
to 2.1. If the rate was above 2.1, the experimental sera
were classed as positive, whereas if the rate was lower than
2.1, the experimental sera were classed as negative.
