Abstract
Background: Streptococcus uberis, a Gram positive bacterial pathogen responsible for a significant
proportion of bovine mastitis in commercial dairy herds, colonises multiple body sites of the cow
including the gut, genital tract and mammary gland. Comparative analysis of the complete genome
sequence of S. uberis strain 0140J was undertaken to help elucidate the biology of this effective
bovine pathogen.
Results: The genome revealed 1,825 predicted coding sequences (CDSs) of which 62 were
identified as pseudogenes or gene fragments. Comparisons with related pyogenic streptococci
identified a conserved core (40%) of orthologous CDSs. Intriguingly, S. uberis 0140J displayed a
lower number of mobile genetic elements when compared with other pyogenic streptococci,
however bacteriophage-derived islands and a putative genomic island were identified. Comparative
genomics analysis revealed most similarity to the genomes of Streptococcus agalactiae and
Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. In contrast, streptococcal orthologs were not identified for
11% of the CDSs, indicating either unique retention of ancestral sequence, or acquisition of
sequence from alternative sources. Functions including transport, catabolism, regulation and CDSs

encoding cell envelope proteins were over-represented in this unique gene set; a limited array of
putative virulence CDSs were identified.
Conclusion: S. uberis utilises nutritional flexibility derived from a diversity of metabolic options to
successfully occupy a discrete ecological niche. The features observed in S. uberis are strongly
suggestive of an opportunistic pathogen adapted to challenging and changing environmental
parameters.

Background
Streptococcus uberis is a gram positive bacterium belonging
to family Streptococcaceae, a diverse family of bacteria
that encompasses species capable of commensal and/or
pathogenic traits. Pathogenic streptococci cause a variety
of disease states across a range of animal hosts as well as
man. The zoonotic potential of streptococci normally
considered pathogenic for animal species has been
recently documented for Streptococcus suis [1] and Streptococcus agalactiae [2].
Phylogenetic analysis [3] placed S. uberis within the pyogenic cluster, a large grouping containing the human
pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, the zoonotic S. agalactiae and a
number of animal pathogens occupying diverse ecological niches including S. dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equi,
Streptococcus canis and Streptococcus iniae.
S. uberis is commensal at many body sites and has been
isolated from the skin, gut, tonsils and genital tract of
asymptomatic cattle. Furthermore it can infect the bovine
mammary gland and act as a major pathogen of the mammary gland causing the inflammatory disease, mastitis.
Infection with S. uberis is one of the major causes of
bovine mastitis worldwide [4-6] and the most common
cause in the UK [7]. Procedures to control bacterial infection of the mammary glands of dairy cattle are based on
limiting duration of existing infection and restricting
exposure of potentially infectious material from one
gland to another. These procedures have resulted in
decreased transmission of infections due to certain bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, S. agalactiae) but have
had little impact on the incidence of infection due to S.
uberis. The failure of these measures to control intramammary infection due to S. uberis implies transmission from
additional/alternate sources [8]. Typing of isolates from
cases of mastitis also implies that S. uberis is not transmitted from reservoirs containing single outbreak strains as
multiple bacterial types are often detected within a single
herd. S. uberis is often detected in faeces and can also be
isolated from the environment (pasture, bedding materials) populated by these animals [9,10]. However, survival
of S. uberis in the environment is limited. A recent report
from New Zealand, which operates a pasture-based dairy
system where cattle are housed rarely if at all, showed that

the organism survived in the environment for less than 4
weeks [11]. This implies that persistence in pasture is
dependent on constant reintroduction, probably via faecal contamination. It is, therefore reasonable to conclude
that a successful clone of S. uberis isolated from a mastitic
mammary gland is able to colonise and increase in
number within the ruminant gut, survive in environmental niches such as pasture or bedding in sufficient numbers to gain access to the mammary gland where it must
replicate and avoid a number of host defence mechanisms. In addition to infection of the lactating mammary
gland, S. uberis is also able to infect the involuted or dry
gland [12]. In this niche the secretion in which the organism replicates and the range of host defences encountered
differ markedly from those present during lactation [13].
Epidemiologically, S. uberis strain 0140J, the strain chosen
for sequence determination, was placed within a major
UK lineage, the clonal complex based around sequence
type 5, of an ongoing MLST scheme [14]. As such, strain
0140J represents a typical UK isolate in terms of its ancestry. It is also among the most thoroughly characterised
strains [15] that is pathogenic for both the lactating and
non-lactating bovine mammary gland. Therefore it was
deemed ideally suited to be the first strain of this species
to be sequenced. The complete S. uberis genome provides
insights into host-cell interactions and pathogenesis.
Since the completion of the first streptococcal genome
[16] many comparative projects have centred upon the
main species pathogenic for humans, namely S. agalactiae
[17], Streptococcus pneumoniae [18,19] and S. pyogenes
[20,21]. Such studies have indicated the pairing of significant levels of conserved gene content with considerable
gene sequence heterogeneity. Additionally, the proportion and content of such genomes that was attributable to
a variety of mobile genetic elements appeared considerable. Comparative genomics has recently enabled the scale
of both inter and intra-species horizontal gene transfer to
be realised, for example within the oral streptococci [22].
Intriguingly, the gene content of some streptococci also
appears to have been augmented from non-streptococcal
species with which they co-exist in discrete ecological
niches [23,24]. It is against such a backdrop that analysis
of pathogenic streptococci of veterinary significance can
derive added value. The genome sequences of several

other related streptococcal species, with different host
ranges and disease associations are available for comparison. We utilized the genomes of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) [25]; a veterinary pathogen causing
lower airway disease, foal pneumonia, endometritis, and
abortion in horses, and hemorrhagic streptococcal pneumonia in dogs; and S. pyogenes (alternatively referred to as
group A Streptococcus, GAS) [26]; responsible for a
diverse number of diseases in humans, including pharyngitis, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), impetigo and scarlet
fever, and the post infection sequelae, acute rheumatic
fever (ARF). Comparisons with these related pathogens
and their virulence determinants highlighted the components of the genome that distinguish it from these species,
and genes that are important for the niche-adaptation and
virulence of S. uberis.

conservation of genome structure (Figure 2B), suggesting
a more distant genetic relationship.
In addition to the conserved regions identified in these
comparisons, discrete regions of difference were identified
throughout the genome of S. uberis 0140J (Figure 1; Additional file 2), suggestive of diverse evolutionary origins for
this component of the genome. Three discrete tracts of the
sequence were identified as bacteriophage-derived
islands, and a putative genomic island. When considered
with additional remote CDS that are remnants of mobile
genetic elements (MGEs), it was determined that MGEs
constitute 1.7% of the genome. The low number of MGEs
in the S. uberis genome is in marked contrast to other
related streptococci [28,29]. Notably the genome does not
contain any CDSs with similarity to insertion sequence
(IS) elements.

Results and discussion
Comparative genomics
The genome of S. uberis 0140J consists of a single circular
chromosome of 1,852,352 bp (Figure 1), which places it
at the lower end of the 1.8 Mbâ2.3 Mb size range of streptococcal genomes sequenced to date. The genome contains 1,825 predicted protein coding sequences (CDSs),
62 of which are pseudogenes or gene fragments (Additional file 1). Comparative genomic analysis with other
streptococci by reciprocal FASTA revealed a conserved
core of orthologous CDSs (Figure 1); comparisons using
representatives of each of the sequenced Streptococcus species identified that ~40% of S. uberis CDSs had orthologous matches in all the streptococcal genomes compared.
Supplementing this core were variably distributed orthologues (~48% of the CDSs) that were identified in one or
more streptococci, and S. uberis-specific CDSs (~11% of
the CDSs).

For any one streptococcal species comparison, between
57% and 72% of the S. uberis CDSs had orthologue
matches, which compared with 58% for a comparison
with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The highest numbers of
orthologue matches were identified in comparisons with
pyogenic streptococci, while more taxonomically divergent species yielded lower numbers of orthologous
matches. Comparison of the structure of the S. uberis
0140J chromosome with other streptococci revealed the
greatest overall conservation with S. zooepidemicus and S.
pyogenes (Figure 2A).
Most of the conserved regions of these genomes appear to
be co-linear, interspersed with regions that appear to be
translocated and inverted. Of the currently sequenced
streptococci, these two pyogenic species are also the most
closely related to S. uberis as defined by 16S rDNA phylogeny [27]. A comparison with S. agalactiae revealed less

Whilst the genome comparison of S. uberis with other
related pyogenic streptococci illustrates the common evolutionary origins of these species, it is apparent from the
differences in host associations and pathogenicity that
they have become specialized since they diverged from
their common ancestor. Insight into the functional specialisations of the S. uberis genome can be gleaned from a
tripartite comparison with S. pyogenes [26] and S. zooepidemicus [25] (Figure 3). The relative compositions of the
differentially shared versus unique genome components
exhibit differences that illustrate niche adaptation
between the species. For example, the group of CDSs
shared between S. uberis and S. zooepidemicus encodes
functions associated with central metabolism, transport
and gene regulation, which are absent in the group shared
between S. uberis and S. pyogenes. In comparison to S.
uberis and S. zooepidemicus, S. pyogenes is highly nicherestricted, therefore the spectrum of substrates and stimuli
it experiences is narrower. This probably explains why S.
pyogenes does not share the broader metabolic, transport
and regulatory repertoire of the other two species. The S.
uberis-specific group contains CDSs that differentiate this
species from the other two pyogenic streptococci in this
three-way comparison, but also distinguish S. uberis from
other Streptococcus species (Figure 3).
Comparison of the relative compositions of the S. uberis
vs. S. zooepidemicus-S. pyogenes unique CDSs (Figure 3)
and the S. uberis vs. other streptoccoci unique CDSs (Figure 3) shows similar functional makeups to each other.
The functions encoded in these groups encompass a
diverse range including those associated with growth
(central, catabolic and energy metabolism) and host- and
environmental-interactions (transport, regulators, protective responses, and cell envelope), and reflect the potential for niche adaptation by S. uberis.

Sugar utilization
In comparison to other streptococci, the S. uberis genome
contains a distinct inventory of CDSs encoding carbohydrate degradation and utilization functions. The diversity
of the sugar transport and utilization apparatus in the
genome provides S. uberis with the capacity to survive in
complex host and environmental niches. In particular, S.
uberis is well equipped to utilize microbial metabolites
and products arising from the digestion of plant material
found in the rumen.

S. uberis contains an expansion of glycoside hydrolase
family 1 proteins [30] that catalyse the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between two or more carbohydrates, or
between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety.

The S. uberis 0140J genome contains 12 members of a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (Pfam domain PF00232) in
contrast to 4 in S. pyogenes Manfredo, 3 in S. equi 4047, 4
in S. zooepidemicus H70, 4 in S. suis P1/7, 6 in S. pneumoniae TIGR4, 4 in S. sanguinis SK36, 4 in S. mutans UA159,
3 in S. agalactiae NEM316, 5 in S. gordonii CH1, and 6 in
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403. The large number of
glycoside hydrolase family 1 proteins suggests that S.
uberis has the capacity to hydrolyse a wide range of sugars.
Protein sequence similarity searches (Table 1) and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4) demonstrates the diversity of
the S. uberis proteins. The topology of the phylogenetic
tree constructed with the glycoside hydrolase family 1
proteins suggests complex evolutionary origins of the proteins (Figure 4). For example, S. uberis SUB0800 is found

S. pneumoniae SpT_1100, S. sanguinis SSA_1692, S. mutans
Sm_1351, S. agalactiae SaN1329, S. gordonii SGO_1512)
as well as SUB1448. The branch lengths of this clade suggest that SUB0800 is more closely related to most of the
other streptococcal species proteins than to SUB1448, and
therefore the likely ortholog. However, comparative
genomic analysis examining synteny in the regions of the
S. uberis loci with the other streptococcal members of this
clade, identified SUB1448 as the orthologous protein
rather than SUB0800. Analysis of the other glycoside
hydrolase family 1 proteins shows that none of them can

be identified as orthologues of glycoside hydrolase family
1 proteins in closely related streptococci on the basis of
synteny. It is therefore not possible to resolve the complex
evolutionary origins of the glycoside hydrolase family 1
proteins in S. uberis from the limited genomic datasets
currently available. It is likely that expansion in the
number of members of this family in S. uberis is the result
of horizontal gene transfer, possibly from outside the
genus. Database searches using the family members
showed that for many of the proteins, the highest levels of
amino acid identity are to proteins belonging to bacteria
outside the genus. The most marked example is SUB0200,
where the top Fasta matches are to proteins in Gram-negative enteric bacteria (Table 1).

tional flexibility with respect to its host niche. Similarly,
some fourteen PTS were identified in another oral streptococcus, S. mutans UA159 [32]. S. uberis can call upon an
array of at least fifteen PTS to satisfy the requirements of
fermentative or glycolytic energy production based upon
the sugars available to itwithin the bovine gut and also in
mammary gland secretions. Fifteen loci were identified in
the 0140J genome that contained complete PTS, with an
additional five loci containing components of PTS that
may represent partial or divergent systems. In comparison, the non pathogenic dairy-industry bacterium, S. thermophilus, was reported to have seven PTS, of which four
contain pseudogenes [23].
The S. uberis 0140J genome contains a mannitol-specific
PTS (SUB0288 and SUB0289) as part of an operon with a
ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase (SUB0285), 6-phospho3-hexuloisomerase (SUB0286) and a mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase (SUB0287). These five CDSs do
not have orthologous matches in the other streptococci.
The metabolic genes in this cluster encode functions for
conversion of D-ribulose 5-phosphate to D-xylulose 5phosphate, isomerisation of hexulose-6-phosphate to
fructose-6-phosphate and the production of D-fructose 6phosphate from D-mannitol 1-phosphate.
Concomitant with its ability to colonise the bovine gut,
the lumen of the mammary gland in lactating and nonlactating animals, and its ability to survive in pasture, S.
uberis retains numerous regulatory CDSs. Many of the regulators in the accessory genome are associated with sugar
detection and metabolism. These include 6 antiterminator type regulators associated with PTS (SUB0194,
SUB0530, SUB0797, SUB0829 (a pseudogene),
SUB1452, SUB1704), and 4 RpiR family regulators that
contain SIS phospho-sugar binding domains (SUB0170,

Within the CDSs unique to S. uberis when compared to S.
pyogenes and S. zooepidemicus were two CDSs associated
with energy metabolism (SUB0104 and SUB0105), that

encode subunits of a cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase.
These CDSs are part of an operon (SUB0102 to SUB0107)
similar to the respiratory chain operon of S. agalactiae
(menA, ndh, cydA, cydB, cydC, and cydD) [33]. This respiratory chain is incomplete in S. uberis, as it is in S. agalactiae,
as the genome does not encode the biosynthetic pathways
for quinone, required for electron transfer, and haem, a
cytochrome oxidase cofactor. However respiration in S.
agalactiae can be stimulated under aerobic conditions if
exogenous haem and quinone are supplied [33]. The presence of two distinct metabolic routes for energy production, fermentation and respiration, bestows S. uberis with
a metabolic versatility that may promote survival in the
diverse niches it occupies. In vitro experiments with S. agalactiae have shown a survival advantage for cells grown
under respiratory conditions as opposed to under fermentation conditions [33]. Mutants of cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase demonstrated lower levels of growth in blood
under aerobic conditions, and also had reduced virulence
in a neonatal rat sepsis model [33]. The ability to respire
aerobically may be important for the spread and dissemination of S. uberis, although the requirement for exogenous haem and quinone suggest that this is strongly
linked to environmental conditions dictated by the host
or niche microbiota.
A recent study showed that quinones produced by Lactococcus lactis cross-feed S. agalactiae and activate respiration
when the two organism were co-cultured [34]. Given the
complexity of the microbial ecosystems in which S. uberis
resides, it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that heme
and quinone would be available permitting reconstitution of the respiratory chain. Cross-feeding of these key
respiratory molecules by resident bacteria in the lower
gastrointestinal tract may promote the fecal shedding of S.
uberis. Whilst the anaerobic conditions of the gut may preclude respiration in this environment, once outside the
gut it is possible that a shift in energy metabolism may
promote growth and/or survival of S. uberis in fecal matter.

Protective responses and environmental survival
The S. uberis genome encodes a polyphosphate kinase
(SUB0262), a phosphate metabolism enzyme absent in
other streptococci. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible
transfer of the terminal phosphate of ATP to form a longchain polyphosphate (polyP). The accumulation of polyP
within E. coli cells has been shown to be a response to
nutritional and osmotic stresses [35], and polyP has been
demonstrated to be essential for long-term survival of
Shigella and Salmonella spp. [36]. In Vibrio cholerae,
polyphosphate stores enhance the ability of to overcome
environmental stresses in a low-phosphate environment
[37]. The presence of this enzyme in S. uberis suggests that
this organism is equipped to tolerate comparatively low
phosphate-availability environments such as those that
might be encountered in faeces and pasture. Recent studies have also demonstrated a role for polyphosphate
kinase in the pathogenicity of Salmonella and Camylobacter
species [38,39].

Quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) disinfectants
are used routinely as part of the everyday milking procedure in dairies as a hygiene measure. The S. uberis 0140J
genome contains a putative quaternary ammonium compound-resistance protein (SUB0162) that has 41% identity with QACH_STASA the quaternary ammonium
compound-resistance protein QacH from Staphylococcus
saprophyticus plasmid pST2H6 [40]. Downstream of this
CDS there are two other CDSs that make a putative
operon: SUB0163, binding-protein-dependent transport
system membrane protein; and SUB0164, a fusion protein pseudogene. This latter CDS consists of an N-terminus similar to ABC transporter permease proteins and a Cterminus similar to fibronectin binding protein, containing an LPXTG motif. It is likely that this CDS arose due to
a deletion event that resulted in the fusion of these functionally distinct domains. The three CDSs make up an
operon, however it is not apparent what effect, if any, the
mutation in SUB0164 will have upon resistance to QACs.
A distinct feature of the S. uberis genome that has emerged
from the comparative genomic analysis with other streptococcal species is that there is an abundance of bacteriocins and associated processing, transport and immunity
proteins. With the exception of the mammary gland, the
niches that S. uberis colonize are highly competitive, and
are populated by a diverse microbiota. Bacteriocins are
proteinaceous antibiotics produced by bacteria that typically kill other bacteria of the same or closely related species. The production of bacteriocins by S. uberis is thought
to provide a competitive edge and promote colonization.
Uberolysin is a novel cyclic bacteriocin produced by S.
uberis (SUB0032 to SUB0036) [41]. It has been reported
that some strains of S. uberis produce nisin U, a lantibi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/54

otic, which is similar to nisin A produced by Lactococcus
lactis [42]. The 16 kb nisin U biosynthesis and resistance
locus is absent in S. uberis 0140J. The genome also contains a locus (SUB0502 to SUB0516) that encodes an
array of bacteriocin structural proteins and immunity proteins. In total there are six CDSs encoding putative bacteriocin proteins (SUB0502, SUB0503, SUB0505,
SUB0506, SUB0509 and SUB0512). The presence of multiple structural and immunity CDSs suggests a degree of
redundancy. Several of the CDSs at this locus are pseudogenes (two of which are bacteriocin structural CDSs), suggesting that recent mutations have altered the bacteriocin
expression repertoire of strain 0140J, and that there may
be have been selection for the differential expression of
CDSs at this locus. There is evidence of allelic variation at
this locus in other strains of S. uberis; S. uberis strain E,
contains a gene encoding (UbaA), a 5.3-kDa class IIa
(pediocin-like) bacteriocin at this locus [43], whereas
strain 0140J lacks ubaA, but contains divergent bacteriocin
CDSs. Notably the ubericin A putative immunity protein
UbaI is conserved in both strains (SUB0516; 98% identical at the amino acid level).
3.4% of the S. uberis 0140J genome encodes pseudogenes
(Additional file 1). Comparable levels are observed in the
genomes of S. suis (strain P1/7) (unpublished data) and S.
pyogenes (Manfredo) [26]; other Gram positive pathogens
of similarly low GC content such as Staphylococcus aureus
have a pseudogene content of between 0.8 and 2.5%
[44,45]. These figures are significantly below the 10% figure reported for two S. thermophilus strains (CNRZ1066,
LMG18311) for which disruption due to numerous
mobile elements and an ongoing depletion of superfluous
carbon utilisation CDS were deemed contributory factors
[23]. Statistical analysis suggests that pseudogenes are
over-represented in genomes of bacteria experiencing
either new environmental niches or those becoming
equipped to live in a diversity of habitats [45]. Although
the relative level of pseudogenes is not high, it is a point
of debate that the high representation of regulators and
surface-associated proteins within this (Additional file 1),
is suggestive of an organism engaged in the process of
adapting to the challenge of successfully colonising the
bovine gut and the mammary gland.
Virulence
The majority of virulence factors in S. uberis genome are
found in the variable component of the genome (Figure
3) although some are also found in the core gene set, for
example fibronectin-binding protein (SUB1111) [46],
hemolysin-like protein (SUB1273), and a C5A peptidaselike precursor (SUB1154). Overall there was a lack of what
might be considered classical virulence determinants
when compared with S. pyogenes. For example, genes associated with the production and surface anchoring of M

Page 10 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:54

protein in S. pyogenes are absent from S. uberis 0140J.
Orthologs of emm and mga (a transcriptional activator of
emm) were not present and none of the CDSs identified
previously as putative sortase substrates [47] suggested Mlike properties. Other structural proteins that utilise sortase-mediated surface-anchoring such as pilin are also
absent from the genome. As a pathogen, S. zooepidemicus
has been less intensively studied, therefore the paucity of
virulence determinants in this species, and consequently
identified by comparison with S. uberis, reflects this.
Detailed analysis of the S. uberis genome however identified several CDSs that have potential roles in virulence.
Pathogenic bacteria display an assortment of cell surfaceassociated proteins that can interact with host cells and
tissues and contribute to the pathogenicity of the organism. Bacteria utilise a number of different mechanisms to
attach proteins to the cell wall, one of which is through
covalent linkage initiated by sortase enzymes. Up to 5 different classes of sortase enzymes have been identified in
Gram positive bacteria [48,49] with one gene identified in
the S. uberis genome, srtA (SUB0881). Anchoring of protein A of Staphylococcus aureus via SrtA has been well characterised [50]. Proteins that are destined for anchoring by
sortase typically have N-terminal signal sequences for protein secretion and a cell wall sorting signal consisting of
an LPXTG, or occasionally an LPX(A/S)G, anchoring
motif followed by a C-terminal hydrophobic region with
a positively charged tail of amino acids [51].
Seven genes were identified that contained LPXTG sorting
motifs; SUB0145, SUB0164, SUB0348, SUB0888,
SUB1095, SUB1730 and SUB1739 and a further two
(SUB0207 and SUB0241) containing LPXAG motifs.
However, two of these, SUB0164 and SUB1739, are
highly likely to be pseudogenes and thus unlikely to be
translated into fully functional, anchored proteins. A
number of these genes have similarity with previously
characterised streptococcal proteins; SUB0145, encodes a
lactoferrin binding protein (Lbp) [52] which displays
homology to fibrinogen-binding/M-like proteins, and
SUB1095 shows similarity to an array of SclB collagen-like
surface proteins of S. pyogenes [53]. Four additional CDSs,
SUB0135, a fructan beta-fructosidase precursor and
SUB0764, a surface-anchored 5'-nucleotidase (pseudogene), SUB0826, a subtilase family protein, and SUB1154,
a C5A peptidase-like precursor, are also putative sortaseprocessed surface-anchored CDSs, containing the variant
motifs LPXTS, LPXTS, LPXTR and LPXTV respectively.
A typical response to intra-mammary infection by the host
is an increase in lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein
that acts to restrict the availability of iron for bacterial
growth [54,55]. Streptococci are considered to be resistant
to the antibacterial effects of lactoferrin, most likely due to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/54

the low requirement for iron for growth [56]. However,
the ability to sequester iron from host glycoproteins is
considered to be essential for bacterial pathogenesis and
bacterial iron-binding proteins have been investigated as
potential virulence factors. Within the S. uberis genome
both Lbp (SUB0145) and S. uberis adhesion molecule or
SUAM proteins (SUB1635) have been investigated as
potential iron-binding proteins [52,57,58]. The SUAM
protein has an affinity for lactoferrin and is involved in
the adherence of S. uberis to a bovine mammary epithelial
cell line in vitro and therefore may be important during
the initial stages of infection and colonisation [57,59].
Adherence experiments using lbp mutants however, suggest that Lbp is not required for attachment of S. uberis to
host epithelial cells and it is also not essential for growth
in iron-limiting conditions. The predicted protein
sequence of Lbp is weakly similar (~28% identity) to the
streptococcal M proteins, and the genome also contains a
partial CDS (SUB0144) with homology to VirR12 and
Mry which are positive regulators of M protein genes in
group A streptococci [52]. The M protein and C5a peptidase are well characterised virulence determinants of S.
pyogenes which act on different arms of the complement
pathway, inhibiting bacterial opsonisation and inflammation and also phagocyte recruitment to the site of infection [60,61]. In S. pyogenes, these virulence determinants
contain LPXTG motifs.
The hyaluronic acid capsule of S. pyogenes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of invasive GAS infections [62]
and is essential for the maturation of GAS biofilms [63].
Strains of S. uberis isolated from cases of bovine mastitis
display variable amounts of hyaluronic acid capsule. The
complement and arrangement of hyaluronic acid biosynthetic genes in S. uberis differs from the hasABC arrangement common to GAS [64]. The has operon, consisting of
hasA (SUB1697) encoding hyaluronan synthase and hasB
(SUB1696) encoding UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, is
similarly arranged to that in GAS. However a hasC homologue (SUB1691), encoding UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, was identified downstream of hasB in the reverse
orientation and separated from it by some 3 kb containing
CDSs apparently unrelated to capsule biosynthesis. The
hasA gene product is essential for capsule production in
both S. pyogenes and S. uberis [64,65]. However, capsule
production in GAS is dependent only upon functional
hasA and hasB, but not hasC [66]. The implication of functional redundancy for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase
activity in GAS was further supported by the identification
of additional homologous CDS in multiple GAS
genomes. In contrast, lesions in isogenic acapsular S.
uberis 0140J mutants were confined to the hasA and hasC
open reading frames suggesting no redundancy existed for
these enzymes [64]. Correspondingly, a homologue
(SUB1027) of the S. uberis hasB gene product (SUB1696)

Page 11 of 17

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:54

was identified that might account for the apparent inability to isolate a hasB mutant using phenotypic screening
methods [64].
The lesions identified in non-mucoid mutants of S. uberis
0140J are distributed between genetic loci likely to be
involved in biosynthesis and also regulation. Three independent acapsular insertion mutants mapped within a
putative GntR-like transcriptional regulator SUB0978
(unpublished data) suggestive of a role in upregulation of
capsule precursors. The exploitation of an isogenic mutant
lacking functional HasA demonstrated that the hyaluronic
acid capsule of S. uberis plays little role in the early stages
of infection of the lactating bovine mammary gland, and
resistance to phagocytosis was ascribed to an undefined
component unconnected with the capsular phenotype
[67].
Activation of host plasminogen to plasmin, a potent serine protease that can bind to the surface of numerous bacterial pathogens, is a mechanism thought likely to
augment a variety of streptococcal infections. Many of the
streptococci within the pyogenic cluster express one of a
variety of plasminogen activators that associate with the
respective host's plasminogen to form an activation complex capable of recruiting and activating further substrate
plasminogen to plasmin. The considerable sequence
diversity, various substrate specificities and origins of the
streptococcal plasminogen activators remain subjects of
considerable research interest. The overwhelming majority of S. uberis isolates encode PauA (SUB1785) located
between the hexA and hexB genes which display homology to the highly prevalent mutS and mutL DNA mismatch
repair genes [68]. A single S. uberis isolate lacking pauA
encoded an alternative novel plasminogen activator
(PauB) [69] also at the hexAB locus.
An alternative locus in all human isolates of group A, C
and G streptococci is populated by streptokinase (SK)
[70]. The genes flanking SK did not appear to encode
related functions, being an ATP-binding cassette protein
and a leucine rich protein lying upstream of ska, while
genes encoding a homologue of the E. coli relA and spoT
genes which moderate levels of guanosine 5',3' polyphosphate during nutritional stress lie downstream [71]. The
corresponding SK locus in S. uberis 0140J is devoid of
plasminogen activator CDS.
Some clues concerning the origins of the diversity of plasminogen activator sequences and the variety of genomic
loci within which they appear in pyogenic streptococci are
drawn from the observation that in at least three S. pyogenes serotypes (M1, M5 and M6) [26,72,73], prophage
are located between the hexA and hexB orthologues with
the phage attachment site for SF370.4 being mapped to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/54

overlie the start of the mutL coding sequence [72]. Further
evidence of the role that phage play in generating variation at this locus is found in the CDS upstream of pauA,
which encodes a putative exported protein (SUB1784),
and is similar to proteins from L. lactis prophage.
Hyaluronidase, has long been considered to be a streptococcal virulence determinant due to its ability to break
down the hyaluronic acid component of connective tissue
and thereby facilitate spread of the pathogen, but there is
little experimental evidence to support this assertion.
Hyaluronic acid capsule produced by some streptococci,
including S. uberis, is somewhat paradoxically also a substrate for hyaluronidase. Recently, it has been suggested
that hyaluronidase facilitates the spread of high molecular
weight compounds rather than bacterial cells per se [74]
and also augments the effects of other streptococcal virulence factors such as pneumolysin [75]. In GAS, hylA
encodes a large secreted hyaluronidase. In addition,
numerous 'phage-associated' hyaluronidases (hylP) are
evident. Neither GAS hylA or hylP homologues were
present in the S. uberis 0140J sequence. Interestingly the
GBS2603 V/R locus encoding a chromosomal hyaluronidase (SAG1197) abuts mutX with the equivalent locus in
GAS Manfredo being the prophage phiman.3, encoding
one of a number of M5 phage hyaluronidase CDS. It
appears highly likely that the hyaluronidase complement
of streptococci has been and continues to be influenced
by bacteriophage.
The CAMP factor [76], a further putative virulence factor
homologous to the Fc-binding and haemolytic cfb gene
product in S. agalactiae is absent from numerous strains of
S. uberis [77]. A CDS encoding CAMP factor was not identified in S. uberis 0140J or within 8 of a panel of 9 further
pathogenic S. uberis strains tested (unpublished data) and
can therefore be considered as non-essential to the infection of the bovine mammary gland.

Conclusion
Analysis of the whole genome sequence of the bovine
mastitis associated S. uberis strain 0140J has identified a
relative paucity of classical streptococcal virulence determinants. In contrast, a plethora of metabolic options
appear available to the bacterium. These endow it with the
potential to flourish in a variety of nutritionally constrained habitats including the lumen of the mammary
gland and the bovine gut. There are evidently survival
advantages for an organism able to occupy multiple environmental niches. Critical to this aspect is nutritional flexibility, and the ability to derive carbon and energy by a
variety of means. The genome provides compelling evidence supporting this proposal. Furthermore, S. uberis
also appears equipped to cope with stresses likely to be
encountered when shifting from one environmental niche

to another for example through the use of polyphosphate
kinase (SUB0262). We present here evidence that suggests
S. uberis should no longer be regarded merely as a pathogen of the bovine mammary gland, but equally as a commensal microorganism of a wider bovine-based
environment. Within this context, it will be of great interest to determine the current distribution of such features
within the species and also whether S. uberis continues to
refine or augment its genetic load along such lines in the
future.

Methods
Strain
Streptococcus uberis 0140J was isolated from milk obtained
from a clinical case of bovine mastitis in 1972 within the
UK. The strain S. uberis 0140J has been deposited under
ATCCÂ® Number BAA-854.
Preparation of genomic DNA
Genomic DNA was prepared from S. uberis using a modification of the method of Hill and Leigh [78]. Todd Hewitt
broth (400 ml) was inoculated with a single colony of S.
uberis 0140J picked from solid media and incubated for
18 h at 37Â°C. Bacterial cells were harvested, washed with
180 ml of Tris, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.8) and the cell walls
disrupted by incubation at 37Â°C for 30 mins in 50 ml of
the same buffer, containing 30 u/ml mutanolysin and 10
mg/ml lysozyme. Cells were lysed by addition of 2.67 ml
SDS (20% w/v in 50 mM Tris, 20 mM EDTA pH 7.8), 0.4
ml Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and incubation at 37Â°C for 1
h. Saturated NaCl (26.7 ml) was added and after 5 min.
cell wall material was removed by centrifugation for 20
mins at 16,000 Ã g. The supernatent was extracted twice
with an equal volume of Tris-equilibrated (pH 8.0) phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). RNAase A was
added to 20 Î¼g/ml and the mixture incubated for 30 mins
at 37Â°C. Genomic DNA was precipitated by addition of 2
volumes of ice-cold ethanol and incubation at 4Â°C for 2
h prior to centrifugation at 16,000 Ã g for 15 mins. The
pelleted DNA was washed with cold 70% ethanol and airdried prior to resuspension at 4Â°C in 2.5 ml of TE buffer.
Whole genome sequencing
Sequence data were obtained from end sequences (giving
approximately 8 Ã coverage) derived from M13 and
pUC18 genomic shotgun libraries (with insert sizes of 1.4
to 2 kb and 2.8 to 3.3 kb respectively) using dye terminator chemistry on ABI3700 automated sequencers. End
sequences from a large insert BAC library (pBACe3.6, 12
to 48 kb insert size) and Fosmid library (pEpiFos, 30â40
kb) were used as a scaffold. All identified repeats were
bridged by read-pairs or end-sequenced polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) products. The sequence was assembled
and finished as described previously [79].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/54

The sequence was annotated using Artemis software [79].
Initial coding sequence (CDS) predictions were performed using Orpheus [80], Glimmer2 [81], and EasyGene [82] software. These predictions were amalgamated,
and codon usage, positional base preference methods and
comparisons to the non-redundant protein databases
using BLAST [83] and FASTA [84] software were used to
refine the predictions. The entire DNA sequence was also
compared in all six reading frames against UniProt, using
BLASTX [83] to identify any possible coding sequences
previously missed. Protein motifs were identified using
Pfam [85] and Prosite [86], transmembrane domains
were identified with TMHMM [87], and signal sequences
were identified with SignalP version 2.0 [88]. rRNAs were
identified using BLASTN [83] alignment to defined rRNAs
from the EMBL nucleotide database; tRNAs were identified using tRNAscan-SE [89]; non-coding RNA (ncRNA)
were identified using Rfam [90]. The sequence and annotation of the Streptococcus uberis 0140J genome has been
deposited in the EMBL database under accession number
AM946015.
Comparative genomics
Comparison of the genome sequences was facilitated by
using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [91] which
enabled the visualization of BLASTN and TBLASTX comparisons [83] between the genomes. Orthologous proteins were identified as reciprocal best matches using
FASTA [84] with subsequent manual curation. Orthology
inferred from positional information was investigated
using ACT. Pseudogenes had one or more mutations that
would prevent correct translation; each of the inactivating
mutations was subsequently checked against the original
sequencing data.

Streptococcus sequences used for comparative genomic
analysis were: S. pyogenes Manfredo (accession number
AM295007) [26], S. pyogenes MGAS315 (accession
