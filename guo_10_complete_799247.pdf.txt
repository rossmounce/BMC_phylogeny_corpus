Abstract
Background: Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are one of the important causes of acute gastroenteritis in children.
Currently, eight HAstV genotypes have been identified and all but two (HAstV-6 and HAstV-7) have been fully
sequenced. We here sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of a HAstV-6 strain (192-BJ07), which was
identified in Beijing, China.
Results: The genome of 192-BJ07 consists of 6745 nucleotides. The 192-BJ07 strain displays a 77.2-78.0%
nucleotide sequence identity with other HAstV genotypes and exhibits amino acid sequence identities of 86.587.4%, 94.2-95.1%, and 65.5-74.8% in the ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 regions, respectively. Homological analysis of
ORF2 shows that 192-BJ07 is 96.3% identical to the documented HAstV-6 strain. Further, phylogenetic analysis
indicates that different genomic regions are likely undergoing different evolutionary and selective pressures. No
recombination event was observed in HAstV-6 in this study.
Conclusion: The completely sequenced and characterized genome of HAstV-6 (192-BJ07) provides further insight
into the genetics of astroviruses and aids in the surveillance and control of HAstV gastroenteritis.

Background
Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are one of the most common causes of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide [1-3]. HAstV was first identified during an
outbreak of gastroenteritis among hospitalized infants in
1975 [4]. Its name is derived from its distinctive starshaped appearance under the electron microscopy (EM).
Molecular analyses indicate that HAstVs are non-enveloped viruses with a 6-8 kb single-stranded, positivesense RNA genome consisting of three overlapping open
reading frames (ORFs)–ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2–as
well as the 5’- and 3’ nontranslated regions (NTRs) [5].
ORF 1a encodes a serine protease; ORF 1b encodes an
RNA dependent polymerase; and ORF 2 encodes a capsid precursor protein [5].
HAstVs have been grouped into eight known serotypes (HAstV-1 through HAstV-8) based on their reactivity to polyclonal antibodies and on analysis by
immunofluorescence assays, neutralization assays, and

immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) [5-7]. Phylogenetic
analyses of the HAstV nucleotide sequence have defined
eight genotypes, and further studies have indicated a
strong correlation between the genotypes and serotypes
[8]. As such, genotypes are frequently applied to type
HAstVs.
Genomic characterization studies are important to the
understanding of the origin, molecular evolution, and
phylogenetic relationships among HAstV genotypes. The
full-length genome sequence for a HAstV (HAstV-2)
was first determined in 1993 [9]. Subsequently, the complete genomic sequences of five more genotypes
(HAstV-1, HAstV-3, HAstV-4, HAstV-5, and HAstV-8)
were reported [9-12]. Because the dominant, diseasecausing HAstV type and strain often fluctuate with time
and geographic location, it is critical that we characterize the complete genomic sequences of all known genotypes in order to better control and prevent future
epidemics [13]. Limited sequence information for
HAstV genotype 6 is available. Only a partial genome
sequence has been reported [14,15], even though this
genotype has been identified as one cause of sporadic or
large scale outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis worldwide
[16,17].

In 2007, we identified a case of HAstV-6 infection in
Beijing, China, suggesting that this strain might be more
epidemiologically relevant than previously recognized
[18]. Here we sequenced and analyzed the complete
genomic sequence of this HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain, and
describe its genetic characteristics by comparing its
sequence with other known HAstV genotypes. The
characterization of HAstV-6 by whole genome sequencing provides critical insight into the genetics of this
virus as well as valuable information for the control and
prevention of HAstV-induced gastroenteritis.

Results
Genome organization

Complete genome sequencing of HAstV-6 (192-BJ07)
was performed from a stool sample that tested positive
for HAstV-6 RNA fragments by RT-PCR. Starting with
the cloning of ORF2, the entire sequence of the viral
genome was obtained by a step-wise amplification strategy through 5’- and 3’-RACE. The full-length genomic
RNA of 192-BJ07 is 6745 nucleotides (nt) in length,
excluding a poly-A tail at the 3’ end. HAstV-6 (192BJ07) has the same genome organization as other
known HAstV genotypes. It has a 5’-NTR of 82 nt, a 3’NTR of 81 nt, and three overlapping major ORFs:
ORF1a (2766 nt), ORF1b (1548 nt), and ORF2 (2337
nt). Details of the predicted genome organization of
192-BJ07 are shown in Fig. 1.
ORF analysis

The sequence of the HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain displayed
similarity to those of other known HAstV genotypes.
ORF1a of the HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain shared 79.0%-

Page 2 of 9

79.9% nucleotide identity and 86.5-87.4% amino acid
identity with those of genotypes 1 through 5 and with
genotype 8. Two mutation sites were found at amino
acids 757 and 758 in 192-BJ07 ORF1a, which result in
the insertion of Arg and Lys.
Unlike ORF 1a, ORF1b exhibited higher nucleotide
(85.7%-87.5%) and amino acid (94.2-95.1%) identity with
that of genotypes 1 through 5 and genotype 8 (Table 1),
indicating that ORF1b is more conserved among the
192-BJ07 strain and the HAstV genotypes than ORF 1a.
Pairwise comparisons of the nucleotide and amino
acid sequences of the ORF2 region showed that 192BJ07 shares relatively low identity with other known
HAstV genotypes in this region (62.4-72.6% nucleotide
identity, and 65.5-74.8% amino acid identity; Table 1).
However, 192-BJ07 exhibited high identity–96.3%
nucleotide identity and 95.9% amino acid identity–with
the documented sequence of the HAstV-6 strain (GenBank accession number Z46658 and Table 1). Structural
predictions of ORF2 indicated that there are three
highly conserved amino acid residues that can be
cleaved to yield proteins with different sizes: Lys 71 for
a 79-kDa protein, Arg 361 for VP29 and Arg 395 for
VP26 [19].
Alignment of the 192-BJ07 ORF2 sequence with the
seven other HAstV genotypes showed that the conserved domain (N-terminal 415 amino acids) shares
85.8-89.6% identity (Fig. 2); whereas the region from
amino acid 416 to the carboxyl-terminus, i.e. the variable region, showed higher levels of variation, with
amino acid sequence identities of only 41-58% (Fig. 2).
Compared with other HAstV genotypes, the 192-BJ07

strain displayed 25-57.5% variation in VR1 (aa 292-319)
and 30.8-92.3% in VR2 (aa 386-399) [20] (Fig. 2). These
results are consistent with those described in a previous
report on HAstV-8 by Méndez-Toss et al [20,21].
Non-coding region analysis

HAstV genotypes typically contain 80 to 85 nt in the 5’NTR. The region shows the highest nucleotide variation
(23.2-57.3%) among the five regions of the viral genome
(5’-NTR, ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2, and 3’-NTR) (Table 1).
However, the 37 nt of the very 5’ end of the viral genome are highly conserved (Fig. 3). Secondary structural
predictions indicate that the HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain
has three stem-loop structures in the 5’-NTR. However,
because there is a high level sequence variability within
the region of nt 38-85 (Fig. 3), the consensus of the
stem-loop structures is very low among HAstV genotypes (data not shown).
In contrast, we found that the nucleotide identities of
the 3’-NTR sequences are as high as 92.6-98.8% compared with other known HAstV genotypes. However,
the sequence variability within this region also results in
secondary structure disparities of the 3’-NTR between
HAstV genotypes (data not shown).
It has been recognized that HAstV RNA has a cis-acting element [ribosomal frameshifting heptamer
sequence (AAAAAAC)] followed by a stem-loop structure in the ORF1a/1b junction region [22]. The 192BJ07 strain also has such a shifty heptamer sequence
and a similar stem-loop structure based on analysis
with RNAstructure 4.5 software. This conservation may
reflect the importance of such structures for translational regulation [22].

The ORF1b/ORF2 junction has been regarded as a
regulatory element of the sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA)
[23]. The alignment analysis of 52 nt at the ORF1b/
ORF2 junction revealed that 192-BJ07 has a very high
identity (98.4-100%) with other HAstV genotypes, consistent with a previous report [24].
Phylogenetic analysis

Nucleotide alignment analysis of whole genome
sequences showed that the identities between the
HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain and the corresponding
sequences of HAstV-1, -2, -3, -4, -5 and -8 were 77.278.0%. We found that the evolutionary relationships
among HAstV genotypes were divergent when phylogenetic analyses were performed at the level of complete
genome sequence or at the level of individual proteins.
The phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome
sequence and the ORF1a region indicates that the
HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain is a significant outlier on the
phylogenetic tree compared to the other HAstV genotypes (Fig. 4A and 4B). In the region of ORF1b, the
HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain and HAstV-3 branch out earlier (Fig. 4C); while in the region of ORF2, HAstV-8 and
HAstV-4 share the common ancestor role of other
HAstV genotypes (Fig. 4D).
Recombination analysis

To determine whether there were recombination events
between the 192-BJ07 strain and other known HAstV
genotypes, we analyzed the similarities at the genome
level. A similarity plot comparing the nucleotide
sequences of HAstV-6 192-BJ07 and HAstV-1, -2, -3, -4,
-5, and -8 is shown in Fig. 5. The sequence identities of
the 192-BJ07 ORF1b region with the other genotypes

are higher than those of ORF1a and ORF2. This may
indicate conservation of ORF1b among HAstVs. However, no recombination break points were detected
between the query sequence (HAstV-6 192-BJ07) and
the reference sequences using the SimPlot program.
Thus, there is no clear evidence of genetic recombination between 192-BJ07 and other HAstV genotypes.

Discussion
In this study, we report the whole genome sequence of
HAstV-6 based on a strain (192-BJ07) identified in an
etiological investigation of viral gastroenteritis in Beijing
[18]. The sequence analysis shows that the 192-BJ07
strain has a typical astrovirus genome organization with
three ORFs (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2), an 80-85 nt 5’NTR, and an 80-85 nt 3’-NTR. Phylogenetic and homological analyses of the ORF2 regions indicate that the
192-BJ07 strain genome possesses a 95.9% amino acid
identity to the documented HAstV-6 strain (GenBank
accession number Z46658), but a <75% amino acid identity to other HAstV genotypes.
Consistent with previous reports of other HAstV genotypes, our results also show the existence of three
potential cleavage sites at Lys 71, Arg 361, and Arg 395
in HAstV6 ORF2 [3,19,20]. It is thought that the cleavage at Lys 71 leads to the generation of the 79-kDa
capsid protein [19]. The 79-kDa capsid protein can be
converted into three smaller peptides–VP34, VP29, and

VP26–and leads to an enhancement of HAstV infectivity
[19]. Our observations support the critical role of these
three amino acid residues in HAstV replication and
pathogenesis.
In our study, we found two insertional mutations, Arg
757 and Lys 758, in ORF1a. How these hydrophilic
amino acids contribute to the characteristic/function of
the virus is unknown at present and needs to be
addressed in further functional studies.
Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that HAstV-6 may
be an ancestor of other HAstV genotypes as shown by
the phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence
(Fig. 4A). This observation was further supported by the
phylogenetic analysis of the ORF1a protein region (Fig.
4B). Moreover, detailed analysis of all genotype ORF1b
amino acid sequences indicates that HAstV-6 and
HAstV-3 may have functioned as the common ancestor
of other HAstV genotypes (Fig. 4C). However, the analysis of HAstVs ORF2 suggests that HAstV-8 and HAstV4 may have been the common ancestor of other HAstV
genotypes (Fig. 4D). Different evolutionary and selective
pressures in different HAstV genomic regions may be
responsible for this discrepancy of the evolutionary relationships [25].
The secondary structure predictions indicate that
stem-loop structures are not conserved in the 5’- and 3’NTRs of known HAstV genotype genomes. This difference may be responsible for the possible discrepancy at

and ORF2 (D) regions.

the replication and/or transcription level among HAstV
genotypes. The fact that the 5’-end of the 5’-NTR and
the 3’-NTR and the 52 nt region at the ORF1b/ORF2
junction are highly conserved points to their critical role
in the interaction with the viral replicative or transcriptive machinery. The variation in the 3’-end of 5’-NTR
may influence the efficiency of viral genome replication
or transcription, resulting in a difference in replication
ability or virulence among different genotypes or strains
[5].
The -1 ribosomal frameshifting is critical for the translation of the astrovirus genome [22]. The -1 ribosomal
frameshifting requires two cis-acting signals: a shifty
heptamer sequence (AAAAAAC) and a potential stemloop structure [10,26]. This study showed that the
HAstV-6 192-BJ07 strain also has such cis-acting elements, and further demonstrates the conservation of
such elements among HAstV genotypes [5].
At present, the mechanism of HAstVs’ variations is
unclear. One study has indicated that recombination
may be responsible for HAstVs’ variation [24]. However,
current studies have not broadly established the role of
recombination in HAstV variation [25,27]. In agreement
with most reports, we found no clear evidence of
recombination between the 192-BJ07 strain and other

HAstV genotypes based on similarity plot analysis.
Diversification of the HAstV amino sequences may be
attributed to accumulated single nucleotide mutations.
This mechanism is similar to the antigen drift in other
viruses, such as in influenza viruses [28,29], which could
lead to HAstVs escaping from existing host immunities
and could result in the emergence of a new epidemic
HAstV strain [30]. Additional studies, such as large
scale whole genome sequencing, are needed to address
the evolutionary patterns of HAstVs.

Conclusion
We have sequenced and characterized the complete
genome of HAstV-6 (192-BJ07). This sequence will provide insight into the genetics of astroviruses, broaden
our understanding of their properties, and inform surveillance and control of HAstV gastroenteritis around
the world.

The primers ORF2-F (5’-atggctagcaagtctgacaagcagg-3’)
and ORF2-R (5’-gaagctgtaccctcgatcctactc-3’) targeting
ORF2 of 192-BJ07 were designed based on the only
available HAstV-6 sequence in GenBank (GenBank
accession number Z46658). For reverse transcription
(RT) reactions, cDNA was generated with the SuperScript™ III RT kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using a
random primer (Takara, Dalian, China) as described in
the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR reaction was performed as follows: 94°C for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of
amplification (94°C for 30 seconds; 50°C for 30 seconds;
and 72°C for 3 minutes), and a final 10 minutes extension at 72°C. The PCR products were analyzed by 1.0%
agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium
bromide.

The ORF2 sequence obtained above was used as the
starting point for the amplification. PCR-amplified products were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China) and were introduced into chemically
competent E. coli DH5a cells. The plasmid DNA was
sequenced using an ABI3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied

(GenBank accession number AF260508) were first
aligned by using Clustal W of the MEGA 4 program,
and then 192-BJ07 was chosen as the query sequence
