Abstract
Background: The outer membrane protein M35 is a conserved porin of type 1 strains of the
respiratory pathogen Moraxella catarrhalis. It was previously shown that M35 is involved in the
uptake of essential nutrients required for bacterial growth and for nasal colonization in mice. The
aim of this study was (i) to characterize the potential roles of M35 in the host-pathogen interactions
considering the known multifunctionality of porins and (ii) to characterize the degree of
conservation in the phylogenetic older subpopulation (type 2) of M. catarrhalis.
Results: Isogenic m35 mutants of the type 1 strains O35E, 300 and 415 were tested for their
antimicrobial susceptibility against 15 different agents. Differences in the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration) between wild-type and mutant strains were found for eight antibiotics. For
ampicillin and amoxicillin, we observed a statistically significant 2.5 to 2.9-fold MIC increase (p <
0.03) in the m35 mutants. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that human saliva contains anti-M35
IgA. Wild-type strains and their respective m35 mutants were indistinguishable with respect to the
phenotypes of autoagglutination, serum resistance, iron acquisition from human lactoferrin,
adherence to and invasion of respiratory tract epithelial cells, and proinflammatory stimulation of
human monocytes. DNA sequencing of m35 from the phylogenetic subpopulation type 2 strain 287
revealed 94.2% and 92.8% identity on the DNA and amino acid levels, respectively, in comparison
with type 1 strains.
Conclusion: The increase in MIC for ampicillin and amoxicillin, respectively, in the M35-deficient
mutants indicates that this porin affects the outer membrane permeability for aminopenicillins in a
clinically relevant manner. The presence of IgA antibodies in healthy human donors indicates that
M35 is expressed in vivo and recognized as a mucosal antigen by the human host. However,
immunoblot analysis of human saliva suggests the possibility of antigenic variation of
immunoreactive epitopes, which warrants further analysis before M35 can be considered a
potential vaccine candidate.

Background
Moraxella catarrhalis is an exclusively human, mucosal respiratory tract commensal and pathogen causing between
5% [1] and 20% of cases of acute otitis media in children
[2] across all regions of the world. The recent introduction
of routine infant immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has - in some studies [3] - led to a substantial increase in otitis media caused by M. catarrhalis [3]. It
is thus a major cause of the most common bacterial infection in children requiring medical attention. M. catarrhalis
also triggers approximately 10% acute exacerbations of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults
[4]
In our attempts to identify cold shock regulated outer
membrane proteins (OMP) of M. catarrhalis [5] we investigated a recently described OMP called M35. We found
no evidence of cold shock regulation, but the construction
of an isogenic mutant lacking the expression of a currently
incompletely described OMP of M. catarrhalis provided us
with the opportunity to conduct a phenotypic analysis of
the function of M35. Meanwhile, in an elegant series of
experiments, Easton and co-workers [6] demonstrated
that M35 is a typical Gram-negative OM porin, which also
is essential for short-term nasal colonization of mice.
Importantly, porins of Gram-negative bacteria not only
assure bacterial homeostasis by acting as transport channels, but are also known to afford virulence mechanisms
such as adhesion, invasion [7-11], and pro-inflammatory
stimulation. [11-17]. In addition, porins are often
involved in antimicrobial resistance [18-26]. Porins of M.
catarrhalis have received little attention in the scientific literature. Gotho et al. described the permeability for betalactam antibiotics across the OM of M. catarrhalis suggesting that porins may be involved [27]. Lafontaine et al
investigated the porin-like OMP CD, which acts as an
adhesin on lung cells [7]. Thus, M35 is currently the only
well characterized porin of M. catarrhalis [6,28].
The aims of the present study were (i) to provide an overview of phenotypic differences between the strains O35E,
300 and 415 and their respective isogenic m35 mutants,
(ii) to investigate whether M35 is a human mucosal anti-

gen and thus a potential vaccine candidate, (iii) to evaluate the role of M35 in the susceptibility of M. catarrhalis to
various classes of antimicrobial agents, and (iv) to provide
the DNA sequence m35 of strain 287, which is a representative of the phylogenetically older major lineage (type 2)
of M. catarrhalis [29].

Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
The M. catarrhalis strains and their isogenic m35 mutants
used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains were cultured at 37°C and 150-200 rpm in brain heart infusion
(BHI) broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) or on BHI agar plates in
an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Media were supplemented with kanamycin (20 μg/ml) for culturing of the
mutants. To investigate growth under different osmotic
conditions, strains were cultured in BHI broth overnight
at 37°C and 150 rpm. One ml of overnight culture was
diluted 1:100 in fresh BHI supplemented with 0.25 M, 0.5
M or 1.0 M NaCl, respectively, and incubated at 37°C and
150 rpm. During cultivation to the stationary phase cell
density was measured at OD600. The effect of exposure to
different acidic environments was measured by growing
bacteria in BHI broth overnight, harvesting and resuspending them in 20 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 1 mM
MgCl2, 25 mM L-arginine adjusted to pH 4.0, pH 5.0, pH
6.0, or pH 7.0, respectively. Suspensions were incubated
for 2 h and 4 h, respectively, at 37°C, and the number of
viable bacteria was quantified by plating of serial dilutions. Iron utilization experiments were performed by a
disk feeding assay applying 5 μl of iron-saturated human
lactoferrin (10 mg/ml) to sterile filter disks [30]. BHI agar
plates were previously iron depleted by adding deferoxamine mesylate (Desferal, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) to
a final concentration of 30 μM and incubated at 4°C overnight before use. Escherichia coli DH5α was grown on
Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates or in LB broth.
DNA methods
Plasmids were isolated using the Wizard Plus SV Miniprep
DNA purification system (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.)
DH5α was transformed as described previously [31].
Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England

Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA. Electrocompetent M. catarrhalis
was prepared and DNA was electroporated as described
[32]. DNA sequencing was performed by using an ABI
PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (PE Biosystems, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland) with the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Sequences were analyzed with the Lasergene
software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). For sequencing
of m35 of strain 287, DNA was amplified using the primers m35B5 (5'-TCGATACCAGAACACTACCTAAGC-3'),
m35F2 (5' -GTCTGAGGGCAAGGTAGGCG-3'), m35RMJ1
(5' -CGTAGCAGTTTTCATCTCACCAC 3'), m35F3 (5'CTTGCTCTAGCAACCGCAG-3'), m35R3 (5'-GCAAGACCTAGGTAAGTATC-3') and m35FMJ4 (5'-TGCGTGCATGGGTCGTGA-3').

m35B5 (5'-TCGATACCAGAACACTACCTAAGC-3'). PCR
products were ligated into the BamHI restriction site of
pGEM-T-Easy pUC4K (Promega, Madison, USA). The
kanamycin cassette was ligated into the AvrII restriction
site of the m35 insert. The resulting construct, Δm35:kan,
was used for electroporation of the competent strains
O35E, 300 and 415, respectively. Transformants were
selected on BHI agar plates containing 20 μg/ml of kanamycin. Insertional inactivation of m35 was confirmed by
PCR analysis, sequencing, Southern blot analysis (data
not shown) and immunoblotting (figure 1).
Preparation of OMP
OMP were prepared by the EDTA buffer method as
described [33]. Bacteria were harvested from a stationary
phase culture, resuspended in EDTA buffer (0.05 M
Na2HPO4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M EDTA, ph 7.4), homogenized and incubated at 55°C at 300 rpm for 1 h. Cells and
cell debris were eliminated by centrifugation at 10,000 ×
g for 15 min at 4°C. Finally, OMP were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100.00 × g for 2 h at 4°C.

2D-Gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF
Analysis of M35 and other OMP spots of strain O35E was
performed a described previously [34], except for the precipitation of the OMP, which was omitted.
SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and immunoblot for
detection of human anti-M35 IgA
Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Band intensity was quantified using the
AlphaEaseFC® program from Inotech, Inc. Antibody detection was performed by Western blot analysis. Proteins
were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford,
MA). IgA binding was detected using human saliva samples as primary antibody source and goat anti-human IgA,
respectively, labeled with horseradish peroxidase
(SIGMA) as secondary antibody. Super Signal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) was used for detection of antibody binding.
Unstimulated human saliva was collected from healthy
volunteers using Salivette sponges® (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht,
Germany), centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2000 rpm and
stored at -20°C. All volunteers were laboratory researchers
and provided oral informed consent. Sampling of saliva
from healthy volunteers was approved by the local ethics
committee.
Antimicrobial resistance testing
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate,
cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, meropenem, erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin were determined
by E-test® (AB Biodisk, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Autoagglutination and serum bactericidal assay
Overnight cultures were resuspended in PBS and adjusted
to an OD600 of 2.0 in glass tubes. OD600 of the supernatants were determined after 15 and 60 minutes, respectively. Serum bactericidal assay were performed as
previously reported [35].
Human cell lines and growth conditions
Chang conjunctival cells and A549 lung cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen,
Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/
ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C in 5%
CO2. The THP-1 human monocytic cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum, 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM
HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2.

Adherence and Invasion assay
The ability of M. catarrhalis to adhere to and invade
human epithelial cells in vitro was measured as described
previously [36]. Adherence and invasion was assessed on
both Chang conjunctival cells and A549 lung cells as
described [36,37]. Each strain was analyzed in triplicate in
each experiment.
Proinflammatory activity of M35 on human monocytes
The pro-inflammatory potential of M. catarrhalis OMP
was described previously [38]. To investigate if M35 is an
important mediator of proinflammatory cytokine release
on the bacterial cell surface, THP-1 cells (1 × 106/ml) were
stimulated with different concentrations (1 × 105/ml, 1 ×
106/ml, or 1 × 107/ml) of heat inactivated strain O35E or
the O35E.m35 mutant and incubated for 18 h at 37°C
and 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were centrifuged for
2 min at 11,800 × g and supernatants were stored at 80°C. Cytokines were measured using the R&D Systems
DY208 for human CXCL8/IL-8 and R&D Systems DY210
for human TNFα/TNFSF1A (R&D, Minneapolis, USA),
respectively.
Statistical analysis
Comparison of several test series was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance of differences
between treatment and control groups was determined
using the two-tailed t-test. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Each value represents the mean ± one
standard deviation of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

Results
In vitro growth of m35 mutants
Standard growth curves of the three wild-type/mutant
pairs in BHI broth revealed no difference in growth velocity measured as broth density at OD600 (data not shown).
Because porins are frequently involved in stress responses
of bacteria against changes in osmolarity or pH [39-41],
we investigated the wild-type/mutant pairs with respect to
growth at various osmotic (supplementation of BHI with
0.25, 0.5 and 1 M NaCl) and acidic (pH 4-7) conditions
(figure 2). Again, wild-type strains and their respective
mutants behaved identically.
M35 knockout is not associated with upregulation of a 40
kDa OMP
Easton et al. [6] described the upregulation of a 40 kDa
protein in one of their isogenic m35 mutants. In order to
confirm this observation, we compared Coomassie-blue
stained OMP profiles of our three strains with their respective m35 mutants, but failed to detect any discernible
upregulation of other OMP as determined by measuring
protein band intensities (figure 1A). Thus, removal of
M35 does not appear to affect the OMP composition

effect of exposure to different acidic conditions was measured by growing bacteria in BHI adjusted to pH 4.0, pH 5.0, pH 6.0,

when bacteria are grown in BHI. Taken together, the data
presented thus far indicate that M35 is not essential for
growth in vitro and that its removal from the OM does not
otherwise affect the OMP composition.
M35 is expressed in vivo
The human mucosal antibody response to OM components of M. catarrhalis has been described in detail [4245], but M35 has never been paid specific attention. In
order to search for human antibodies against M35, OMP
of the strains O35E, 300, 415 and their isogenic mutants
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and incubated with human saliva for detection of
IgA. Western Blot analysis for anti-M35 IgA with 7 different donors resulted in antibody signals to all three strains
with the strains 300 and 415 displaying broader immunogenicity than O35E (figure 1B). Four of seven donor saliva
contained anti-M35 IgA against strain 300 and 415,
respectively. One donor displayed anti-M35 IgA for all
three strains. OMP of the m35 mutants were used as negative controls (figure 1B). These data suggest that M.
catarrhalis expresses M35 in vivo and that the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue recognizes M35 as an antigen.
Aminopenicillin susceptibility is mediated by M35
One of the major bacterial strategies for drug resistance is
barrier protection, which limits the intracellular access of
antimicrobial agents [18]. The influx of large, charged
molecules is controlled by porins, which allow passive
penetration of hydrophilic molecules of several classes of
antibiotics [19-21]. Thus, porin-mediated OM permeability is expected to affect susceptibility to antimicrobial
agents [18,22]. To investigate this, E-tests were performed
with the mutants O35E.m35, 300.m35, 415.m35 and their
respective wild-type parent strains. There were no differences in MIC for penicillin G, ceftriaxone, meropenem,
erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, and vancomycin
between wild-type and mutant strains, respectively. For
quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), cefuroxime and imipenem there was a minor,
but consistent ~1.4-fold increase in the MIC of the
mutants (data not shown). For ampicillin and amoxicillin, however, there was a statistically significant increase
in the MIC of the mutants (2.5 to 2.9-fold) in comparison
with their respective wild-types (figure 3A/B) (p = 0.0030.023). Interestingly, at an approximately 10-fold lower
level, this was also found for amoxicillin-clavulanate (figure 3C).
Expression of M35 and putative virulence traits of M.
catarrhalis
The capacity to autoagglutinate is mediated by hemagglutinin (also called Moraxella IgD-binding protein) [46], but
some hemagglutinin knock-out mutants still autoagglutinate (unpublished data). Thus, we investigated whether

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/188

the absence of M35 affected autoagglutination, but failed
to identify any difference between strain O35E and
O35E.m35 (data not shown). Similarly, resistance of M.
catarrhalis to human complement, which is associated
with disease-causing isolates [47-49] and which requires
expression of several OMP [37,50-52], was not impaired
by the lack of M35 (data not shown). Growth of M.
catarrhalis in vivo is dependent on the ability to acquire
iron from the human host by retrieving Fe3+ from ironcontaining host proteins by a number of specific binding
and uptake systems [30,53-59]. Because of its abundance
on mucosal surfaces, we chose to investigate the ability of
the m35 mutant to use iron bound to human lactoferrin
using a standard disk feeding assay on iron depleted BHI
agar plates [30]. The experiment resulted in no differences
in growth between the three m35 mutants and their
respective wild-type parents (data not shown).
Adherence and invasion of the m35 mutant
The abilities of a pathogen to adhere to and invade epithelial host cells, respectively, are major virulence factors.
Adhesins and invasins usually are OMP [5,36,60,61],
some of which also act as porins [7-11]. To investigate if
M35 mediates adherence and invasion assays were performed on Chang conjunctival cells as well as on A549
lung cells. Adherence of the O35E.m35 mutant was as efficient as that of its wild-type parent strain (figures 4A/B).
Similarly, no differences were found for the capacity to
invade these cell types (figures 4C/D) in gentamicin protection assays.
Proinflammatory activity of M35 on human monocytes
Proinflammatory activity is typically induced by OMP,
lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acids. Porins have also
been described to induce proinflammatory cascades by
activating innate immune receptors mediating the expression of several chemokines and cytokines [11-17]. We
investigated M35 with regard to its proinflammatory
effect on human monocytes. THP-1 cells were stimulated
with strain O35E or its O35E.m35 mutant overnight and
cytokine release in the supernatant was measured by
determining the concentrations of IL-8 and TNFα by
ELISA. There was no difference in the release of IL-8 and
TNFα, respectively, between wild-type and mutant (data
not shown).
M35 sequence analysis of type 2 strain 287
M35 is nearly 100% conserved among type 1 strains of M.
catarrhalis [28]. To determine if this is also true for the
other major phylogenetic subpopulations of M. catarrhalis, m35 of type 2 strain 287 was sequenced and analyzed
by bioinformatics. In comparison with type 1 strain
O35E, there was a divergence of 5.8% at the DNA level
consisting mainly of point mutations (figure 5). Unexpectedly, these DNA mutations lead to an even greater

Discussion
Porins are essential components of the gram-negative
outer membrane and contribute to nutrient transport,
antimicrobial resistance, response to osmostress and
other processes, which are essential for bacterial homeostasis. M35 is the first functionally characterized OM porin
of M. catarrhalis [28] and as of today all isolates examined
carry a highly conserved m35 gene on their chromosome.
This may indicate that strains not expressing M35 are not
viable in vivo, but the only evidence in support of this
hypothesis is the observation that a m35 mutant was unable to colonize the nasal mucosa of mice [6], which are
not a natural host species for M. catarrhalis.
Our observation that healthy humans have mucosal IgA
directed against M35 indicates that this protein is

expressed in vivo. However, the fact that some salivary
samples did not recognize all three M35 proteins tested
suggests that either (i) antigenic variation occurs at immunoreactive, surface exposed epitopes, or (ii) it is a weak
antigen and some individuals lose or never acquire antiM35 IgA, or (iii) some isolates lack expression of M35 in
vivo. If the latter were the case, screening of large collections of clinical M. catarrhalis isolates should identify
strains either lacking a m35 gene or isolates carrying silent
genes. The answer to this question is of clinical relevance,
because our data indicate that the absence of M35 is a previously unknown mechanism of aminopenicillin resistance in M. catarrhalis. This effect could occur in vivo by
alterations in porin expression to prevent antibiotic
influx, which is a well known mechanism of resistance in
other pathogens [18,22], and which often is associated
with the expression of degradative enzymes to confer high
level resistance [23,24]. The specificity of M35 for aminopenicillins could be explained by an effect Bezrukov et
al described for OmpF of E. coli. They found that the

nature and position of specific charges on both the antibiotic molecule and the porin play a major role in these
interactions [25,26]. Strong binding to the pore correlates
with high diffusion rates whereas weak binding is associated with reduced diffusion. As of today, the only known
mechanism of aminopenicillin resistance in M. catarrhalis
is the expression of one of three chromosomally encoded
BRO betalactamases, which are detectable in greater than
90% of clinical isolates [62] and explain the fact that the

MIC for amoxicillin-clavulanate in our experiments was at
least 10-fold lower than the MIC for amoxicillin. This
finding indicates that clavulanate penetrates the OM by
ways other than M35. It also demonstrates that, in the
presence of clavulanate, the reduced amount of aminopenicillins still penetrating the OM in m35 mutants suffices to inhibit growth. Thus, it appears that clavulanate
inhibits essentially all betalactamase activity available and
that naturally occurring isolates lacking M35 would not

currently pose a substantial therapeutic problem in
patients treated with betalactamase-resistant betalactams.
However, standard dose or high dose amoxicillin still is
the therapeutic standard for antimicrobial therapy of
acute otitis media. Based on our data (figure 3), currently
accepted
pharmakinetic/pharmcodynamic
(PK/PD)
breakpoints for resistance against standard dose (≥ 1.0 μg/
ml) or high dose amoxicillin (≥ 8 μg/ml), respectively,
[63] thus predict that isolates lacking functional M35 may
display clinically relevant aminopenicillin resistance. This
is particularly relevant for the treatment of acute otitis
media. Drug concentrations reached in the middle ear
cavity are low in comparison with serum concentrations
[64] and treatment failure is typically caused by insufficient drug concentrations in the middle ear fluid [64]. The
list of betalactam antibiotics tested in this study is not
exhaustive and it is conceivable that other drugs may also
be affected by m35 mutations. Thus, further studies are
needed to explore the potential impact of m35 mutants on
antimicrobial treatment failures.

saliva contains anti-IgA indicates that M35 is expressed in
vivo, but that antigenic variation may be greater than previously appreciated. Thus, further studies are needed
before M35 can be considered a potential vaccine candidate against M. catarrhalis.

Multiple phenotypic tests that we carried out with three
wild-type/mutant pairs failed to uncover an additional
functions attributable to M35. None of these results is particularly surprising. The strength of these "negative" data
lies precisely in the fact that we did not study one, but
three different isolates and their respective mutants,
which, taken together, provide firm evidence that M35 is
not involved these various phenotypes in vitro. The analysis of three different wild-type/mutant pairs also lead to
the conclusion that knocking-out m35 does not necessarily upregulate expression of a 40 kDa OMP as stated by
Easton et al (figure 1A). Because these authors used a different strain, it is conceivable that they observed a strainspecific phenomenon, which does not represent the entire
species. Finally, we sequenced m35 of a strain belonging
to the phylogenetically old, second subpopulation of M.
catarrhalis [29], which differs from the younger subpopulation by a considerably larger genetic diversity [29].
Indeed, we found a substantial number of sequence deviations, which, interestingly, were even greater at the
amino acid level than at the DNA level. It is thus conceivable that type 2 strains exhibit functional and/or antigenic
differences with respect to M35, which warrant further
investigation.

Authors' contributions

Conclusion
The significant increases in MIC for ampicillin and amoxicillin of the m35 mutants indicate that the OM porin M35
is involved in the uptake of aminopenicillins. This is a
previously unknown mechanism of resistance in M.
catarrhalis. It remains to be elucidated whether naturally
occurring, disease causing strains of M. catarrhalis devoid
of functional M35 exist, and whether they may contribute
to clinical treatment failure. The fact that normal human
