Abstract
Background: Current molecular phylogenetic studies of Lepidoptera and most other arthropods
are predominantly based on mitochondrial genes and a limited number of nuclear genes. The
nuclear genes, however, generally do not provide sufficient information for young radiations. ITS2
, which has proven to be an excellent nuclear marker for similarly aged radiations in other
organisms like fungi and plants, is only rarely used for phylogeny estimation in arthropods, although
universal primers exist. This is partly due to difficulties in the alignment of ITS2 sequences in more
distant taxa. The present study uses ITS2 secondary structure information to elucidate the
phylogeny of a species-rich young radiation of arthropods, the butterfly subgenus Agrodiaetus. One
aim is to evaluate the efficiency of ITS2 to resolve the phylogeny of the subgenus in comparison
with COI , the most important mitochondrial marker in arthropods. Furthermore, we assess the
use of compensatory base changes in ITS2 for the delimitation of species and discuss the prospects
of ITS2 as a nuclear marker for barcoding studies.
Results: In the butterfly family Lycaenidae, ITS2 secondary structure enabled us to successfully
align sequences of different subtribes in Polyommatini and produce a Profile Neighbour Joining tree
of this tribe, the resolution of which is comparable to phylogenetic trees obtained with COI+COII .
The subgenus Agrodiaetus comprises 6 major clades which are in agreement with COI analyses. A
dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) traced the origin of most Agrodiaetus clades to separate
biogeographical areas in the region encompassing Eastern Anatolia, Transcaucasia and Iran.
Conclusions: With the inclusion of secondary structure information, ITS2 appears to be a suitable
nuclear marker to infer the phylogeny of young radiations, as well as more distantly related genera
within a diverse arthropod family. Its phylogenetic signal is comparable to the mitochondrial marker
COI . Compensatory base changes are very rare within Polyommatini and cannot be used for
species delimitation. The implementation of secondary structure information into character-based
phylogenetic methods is suggested to further improve the versatility of this marker in phylogenetic
studies.

Background
Molecular phylogenetic studies aim to reconstruct species
trees, e.g. to infer the evolution of morphological characters or life history traits. While in the early days of genetic
analyses, the data sets were often confined to single gene
fragments, it is now generally acknowledged that analyses
should include several genes [1-3]. The use of multiple
genes not only provides a greater resolution over different
time scales but yields a more accurate estimate of the species tree which may not correspond to a single gene tree,
especially in radiations of closely related species [4,5].
Unfortunately, the number of genes which are routinely
used for phylogenetic analysis, especially in species rich
arthropod assemblages, have remained limited [6]. In the
mitochondrial genome, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit
I (COI ) has become the most commonly used marker in
molecular phylogenetic studies of arthropods, in part due
to it being the focal genetic marker for DNA barcoding
studies [7]. This marker is now routinely supplemented by
the nuclear marker elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1 ) and
sometimes wingless (wg ) [3,6]. These nuclear markers,
however, continue to be of limited use in resolving the
phylogeny of young radiations because of their slow evolutionary rate. Recently, novel nuclear genes have been
tested in species of Lepidoptera, four of which (Tektin,
CAD, DDC, IDH ) appear promising for such radiations
[6,8]. However, experience with these remains limited or
lacking.
The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2 ), which separates
the nuclear ribosomal genes 5.8S and 28S , constitutes a
rapidly evolving nuclear DNA fragment and has proved
very useful when inferring phylogenetic relationships of
closely related species in groups of organisms such as
plants and fungi [9]. The highly conserved flanking
regions can be used as an anchor for universal primers.
However, ITS2 studies on the phylogeny of metazoans are
relatively rare. In arthropods, only 11,927 ITS2 sequences
from 2720 species have been deposited in GenBank [10]
as of 02 Feb 2009 compared to 13,347 ef1 sequences
from 7353 species and 375,287 COI sequences from
46,385 species in BOLD [11]. This may, in part, be
explained by alignment problems which have limited use
of ITS2 in phylogenetic studies of more distantly related
taxa. Advances in predicting the secondary structure of
ITS2 enables alignment of ITS2 data from more distantly
related taxa and increases its utility above the genus level
[12,13]. In this paper we show that the inclusion of secondary structure information improves phylogeny estimation with ITS2 in a large radiation of blue butterflies
and renders ITS2 a useful nuclear marker in phylogenetic
studies. Furthermore, we suggest that ITS2 is a promising
nuclear candidate for barcode studies, in addition to the
mitochondrial marker COI .

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/300

The Lycaenidae are the second largest family of butterflies
with about 6000 species worldwide. Among them is a
large radiation of ca 130 Palaearctic species, i.e., the subgenus Agrodiaetus . It is extraordinary in Metazoa for its
extreme interspecific variation of chromosome numbers,
which is present even among closely related species that
are often very similar or identical in phenotype [14-17].
Recently, the radiation has become the focus of several
molecular phylogenetic studies in order to unravel the
evolution of morphological and karyological characters
[18-21] and to evaluate the barcoding approach [22]. All
these studies employed COI as the main genetic marker.
Wiemers [18] additionally used ITS2 as a secondary
marker, but phylogenetic resolution without the inclusion
of COI remained unsatisfactory, and the alignment had to
be confined to the subtribe Polyommatina due to alignment problems. Kandul et al. [19] included ef1 as an
additional nuclear marker in a small subset of taxa, but
the marker hardly provided any phylogenetic signal and
was therefore abandoned in subsequent studies [20,21].
Our aim is to compare and evaluate the phylogenetic trees
based on COI with independent evidence from the
nuclear ITS2 incorporating sequence, as well as, secondary
structure information.
Without doubt, DNA sequence data are an extremely valuable source of information to infer phylogenetic relationships. Another usage of these data has recently come
into the focus of both biological scientists and stakeholder groups and attracted much controversy among
them: their usage to delimit and identify species [22-33].
Although COI has been the marker of choice for the barcoding campaign, ITS2 is a successful alternative. This is
especially true in groups where COI fails to work well, e.g.
in fungi [34], where it was used in combination with ITS1
, and, most recently, in diatoms [35]. Furthermore, it has
been recently claimed that structural differences in ITS2
are predictive of species limits. In this view, pairings of
CBCs (= compensatory base changes) provide an indication for sexual incompatibility [36], while their absence
indicates intercrossing ability [37]. As the investigated taxonomic group provides an interesting and opportune
example, a further aim of this study is to test, whether
these claims also apply for the large and very recent radiation of the subgenus Agrodiaetus with an origin about
2.51-3.85 million years ago [19,21].

Results
Sequencing and alignment results
PCR products amplified successfully from all recently collected ethanol-preserved material, while dried material
which had been successfully used for PCR of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI ) failed to consistently achieve successful PCR amplification of ITS2 .
Furthermore, in 11% of sequencing reactions, incomplete

sequences were obtained, probably caused by polymerase
slippage at positions with highly repetitive motifs. Usually, it was still possible to obtain a complete sequence by
sequencing from 5' and 3' ends such that the sequences
only rarely remained incomplete after extended sequencing efforts. Incomplete sequences were excluded from the
analysis as they may be result from co-amplified pseudogenes or not homogenized ITS2 copies. No obvious problems with intragenomic sequence variation were
encountered in the remaining sequences -- all electropherograms obtained were readable over their entire length.
Thus, we assume to have no problems associated with
non-homogenized ITS2 copies, what has been reported in
other ITS studies [38-41] and is discussed in several
reviews [42,43]. Sequence length varied between 450 bp
(in Tarucus theophrastus ) and 602 bp (in Allotinus portunus
and Lysandra corydonius ). Sequence length variation in
Agrodiaetus was between 530 bp (in A. kurdistanicus ) and
563 bp (in A. dama ). Nucleotide composition was typical
for RNA with a slight overrepresentation of guanine (U : C
: A : G = 0.234 : 0.261 : 0.203 : 0.302).
Alignment was successful for all sequences of the tribe
Polyommatini (including six subtribes), as well as for the
outgroup (Miletini: Allotinus portunus ). Alignment difficulties were encountered with sequences of three other
tribes (Theclini, Eumaeini and Lycaenini) which were
therefore excluded from the analysis.
The alignment had 1024 positions of which 419 were variable and 235 were parsimony-informative (with gaps
treated as missing data). Within Agrodiaetus , 131 positions were variable and 58 were parsimony informative.
Phylogeny of Polyommatus
According to the Profile Neighbour Joining (= PNJ) tree
(fig. 1), the genus Polyommatus represents a monophyletic
unit with the exception of its subgenus Lysandra . The subgenus Lysandra is clearly monophyletic but its placement
within Plebejus s.l. is unsupported. Some systematic treatments have united Lysandra with Meleageria , but the two
subgenera appear distinctly distant from each other in our
analysis.

The remaining subgenera (Agrodiaetus, Meleageria, Polyommatus s.str., Neolysandra ) together form a monophyletic
group with a bootstrap support of 88%. Regarding these
subgenera, the monophyly of the subgenus Agrodiaetus is
supported with a bootstrap value of 74%. The sister group
to Agrodiaetus appears to be either the subgenus Meleageria
or Polyommatus s.str. The latter subgenus includes taxa
which have sometimes been placed in subgenera Sublysandra and Plebicula . While the taxa attributed to Sublysandra
(P. cornelia, P. aedon and P. myrrhinus ) appear to form a
monophyletic cluster at the base of the remaining species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/300

of Polyommatus , the subgenus Plebicula (in which P. dorylas, P. escheri, P. amandus and P. thersites have sometimes
been included) does not appear as a monophyletic entity.
The taxa of the subgenus Neolysandra appear at a basal
position relative to the other Polyommatus subgenera. The
relationships of the remaining Polyommatina genera with
each other and with Polyommatus are not well supported,
except for the monophyly of Aricia . Nonetheless, the subtribe Polyommatina received high bootstrap support
(95%) and the members of all other Lycaenidae tribes are
positioned outside this cluster.
Phylogeny of Agrodiaetus
Agrodiaetus damon (the two sequences from France and
Turkey are identical) appears to be the sister taxon to all
other Agrodiaetus . Unfortunately, the bootstrap support
for this position is low. However, a single base-pair substitution is present at position 918 in the alignment that is a
further support for the basal position of A. damon
(although weak). At this position, all other Agrodiaetus
sequences bear a guanine while A. damon and the remaining species of the genus Polyommatus bear an adenine
base. The following major clades are supported by bootstrap values ≥ 50 among the remaining Agrodiaetus species
as indicated in fig. 1 (bootstrap values in brackets): admetus clade (54%), dolus clade (81%), carmon clade (50%),
actinides clade (62%), iphigenia clade (59%), glaucias clade
(56%), poseidon clade (79%).

Additionally, there are some minor clades. Most of them
are poorly supported and include only two species whose
sequences are very similar or identical: iphidamon clade
(13%, p-distance: 0.006), erschoffii clade (57%, p-distance: 0.011), posthumus clade (40%, p-distance: 0.0020.006), shahrami clade (9%, p-distance: 0.000), phyllis
clade (99%, p-distance: 0.000).
The remaining three species cluster with low bootstrap
support: A. valiabadi as sister to the admetus and dolus
clades (40%), A. pierceae as sister to the carmon clade
(37%), and A. klausschuriani as sister to the poseidon clade
(52%).
The phylogenetic relationships among the clades are usually poorly supported by bootstrap values with the exception of the admetus and dolus clades which form a clade
together with A. valiabadi with a bootstrap support of
64%.
A classification based on Agrodiaetus clades with bootstrap
support ≥ 50% is presented in fig. 1, together with classifications based on previous publications. A comparison of
molecular based classifications reveals that 7 major clades
are repeatedly found. Their support values are given in
table 1.

Biogeographical patterns in Agrodiaetus
According to the dispersal-vicariance model implemented
in DIVA, the origin of Agrodiaetus remains uncertain, but
the ancestral biogeographical areas of most major clades
are quite precisely inferred (fig. 2, table 2 &3). An exception is the admetus clade whose ancestral area appears to
encompass almost the entire range of the subgenus, with
the exception of the Central Eurosiberian and Lebanese
regions. The reason for this result, however, might be due
to the poor taxonomy of this clade. It consists only of
monomorphic species which hardly differ in phenotype
and possess high chromosome numbers. The precise
count of such high chromosome numbers is very difficult
with standard karyological techniques [18]. Molecular
results (of ITS2 as well as COI [18]) indicate that A. ripartii
, the most widespread member of this clade, is not monophyletic and consists of several distinct species. The ancestral area of the closely related dolus clade also remains
ambiguous but is confined either to the Mediterranean,
the Central Anatolian, the Armenian, or Kurdistanian
region. Most members of the dolus clade are also monomorphic or have high chromosome numbers. Therefore
its taxonomy is contentious as well and this might have
influenced the results. An illustrative example is given in
the following section. The ancestral areas of the remaining
clades appear to be restricted to four biogeographical
regions. The Kurdistanian region is home to the carmon
clade (as well as to the small Iranian shahrami clade) while
the iphigenia and poseidon clades seem to have originated
in the neighbouring Armenian region. (The latter clade
might also have originated from both.) With the exception of the Turkestanian actinides clade, the remaining

smaller clades (erschoffii, posthumus, glaucias ) appear to
have originated in the Central Iranian region.
Compensatory base changes (CBCs) in Agrodiaetus
A maximum of only 3 CBCs are found among the 140
investigated species-level taxa of Lycaenidae. One of them
occurs between members of the Agrodiaetus +Polyommatus
+Meleageria clade and the remaining Lycaenidae species
(with the exception of Neolysandra fatima ). In 64% of
pairwise species comparisons (and even 99.8% of congeneric comparisons) no CBCs are found. Within Agrodiaetus hardly any species is distinguished by a CBC, but some
major clades can be delimited by hemi-CBCs such as the
iphigenia and dolus clade. Due to the low number of CBCs
and hemi-CBCs, the NJ trees created from CBC or hemiCBC distance matrices provide little resolution (data not
shown).

Although CBCs are uncommon within Polyommatini,
most species differ in their ITS2 sequence. Identical haplotypes were only found in very few sets of taxa (table 4).
Most of them concern taxa with questionable species status [18,44]. For example, A. karacetinae differs only in
karyotype and COI sequence from A. alcestis , but not in
any morphological characters ("karyospecies"). Its position in fig. 1 (as sister to A. ainsae ) is an artefact caused by
a single missing nucleotide at position 628 in the alignment which causes a change in secondary structure making it similar to A. ainsae . The sequence of the latter taxon
is most similar to that of A. fulgens , and its distant position to this species in fig. 1 can also be explained by several missing nucleotides. According to recent karyological

Discussion
Secondary structure information improves phylogenetic
signal in ITS2
Wiemers [18] used a mostly comparable set of taxa for
phylogenetic inference from ITS2 but did not include secondary structure information. Although most major
clades recovered in our analysis were also found in the
Bayesian analysis by Wiemers [18], none of our major
clades were recovered with bootstrap support values ≥
50% in the Maximum Parsimony (MP) analysis of Wiemers [18]. The poseidon clade was also not recovered in the
Bayesian 80% consensus tree presented. (This clade - with
the exclusion of A. putnami - only received a Bayesian support of 0.65, Wiemers unpubl., table 1). In a Neighbour
Joining (NJ) analysis calculated without secondary struc-

ture information only two of the major clades recovered
in the PNJ analysis received bootstrap values ≥ 50% while
two clades received lower bootstrap values and the
remaining two were not recovered at all (table 1). Thus, in
a direct comparison of two NJ algorithms (with vs. without secondary structure, table 1), secondary structure
information apparently amplifies the phylogenetic information in the data set. Further improvement in phylogeny
estimation is to be expected if secondary structure information can be incorporated in Maximum Likelihood
(ML) or Bayesian inference (BI) methods, because these
character-based methods can be superior compared to distance based methods which discard character-state information.
One disadvantage of using secondary structure information appears to be its sensitivity to missing data in stem
regions. Even small amounts of missing data can cause
artefacts in phylogeny estimation of closely related taxa

with very similar sequences (viz. A. alcestis and A. karacetinae ).
Phylogenetic signal of ITS2 is comparable to COI in
Agrodiaetus
In agreement with COI analyses [18], ITS2 data support
the monophyly of Polyommatina which includes the genera Chilades, Plebejus and Polyommatus . The monophyly of
the genera Plebejus and Polyommatus , however, is not fully
supported. This is due to the placement of the subgenus
Lysandra within Plebejus , which however has no bootstrap
support and is probably caused by long-branch attraction.
Such a placement is also in conflict with the Bayesian
analysis of COI which places Lysandra within the genus
Polyommatus [18]. The ITS2 sequences of subgenus Lysandra are peculiar in having several longer inserts with repetitive motifs, e.g. in position 70-133 in the alignment. It is
noteworthy, on the one hand, that none of the analyses
supports a sister-relationship between Lysandra and
Meleageria , even though members of these genera can
hybridize with each other [46-48] and therefore were considered to be very closely related [15]. On the other hand,
Cyaniris is found within Plebejus in the COI tree but basal
within Polyommatus in the ITS2 tree, both times with low
support values. Here, the COI analysis appears to be more
affected by long-branch attraction.

Within Agrodiaetus , the phylogenetic analysis of ITS2
recovers clades which are mostly congruent to those
obtained from an analysis of COI + COII (= cytochrome c
oxidase II). Of particular interest is the confirmation of
the sister relationship between A. damon and the remain-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/300

ing Agrodiaetus species that was not or only very weakly
supported in the COI analyses. ITS2 and COI also agree in
the monophyly and sister relationship of the admetus and
dolus clades, only the position of A. valiabadi differs
(within the dolus clade in COI , but sister to admetus +dolus
in ITS2 ). The carmon clade is also recovered in the COI
+COII analyses but includes the iphidamon clade in the
analyses by Lukhtanov et al. [20] and Kandul et al. (2007)
[21]. Kandul et al. (2004) [19] split this group into three
clades although one of them (clade VII) only appears in
the MP analysis and has no bootstrap support. In the COI
analyses by Wiemers [18] and Wiemers & Fiedler [22],
which are based on shorter sequences, the carmon group
receives no bootstrap support. Similarly, the iphigenia
clade is only recovered in the mtDNA analyses based on
the long 1969 bp section of COI +COII . The poseidon
clade is recovered in the COI analyses, as well. Kandul et
al. [19] split this clade into three subclades but the addition of further taxa revealed that they are not monophyletic and thus should be combined [20,21]. Most
interesting is the actinides clade in the ITS2 tree which suggests a close relationship between A. actinides, A. poseidonides and A. iphigenides . Although previous analyses have
also suggested a close relationship among these taxa, it
was never well supported. The relationships of the
remaining clades (glaucias, erschoffii, posthumus, shahrami,
phyllis ) are not well supported in the ITS2 tree. Previous
analyses using COI [18-20] have suggested a close relationship of these clades, but their combination into an
inclusive erschoffii clade was only very weakly supported
by the latest COI analysis [21], probably due to the inclusion of additional taxa (such as A. eckweileri ). The only
major discrepancy is the placement of A. klausschuriani in
the ITS2 analyses (sister to the poseidon clade) compared
to the COI analyses (within the erschoffii clade), but both
placements are only very weakly supported. The missing
support for the relationships between the major clades
also applies to the COI analyses. Most analyses, however,
agree in the basal position of the admetus +dolus clade and
all of them recover the poseidon clade at the tip of the tree.
We conclude that the phylogenetic signal of ITS2 is comparable to the signal of a much longer fragment of COI /
COII . This is surprising since the rate of parsimonyinformative characters is lower in ITS2 than in COI [18].
Apparently these characters are, however, less "noisy"
than those of COI , which are almost completely confined
to 3rd codon positions.
ITS2 confirms weaknesses of morphological classifications
Fig. 1 reveals little congruence between previous classifications based on morphological characters [14,15,49] and
those on molecular data (COI or ITS2 ). The main reason
for this is the small number of available morphological
characters (mostly slight differences in wing colouration)

daphnis (MW98029) - M. marcida (MW00290). Uppersides
are shown on the left and undersides on the right side of
each image
which are highly susceptible to homoplasy. Illustrative
examples are morphology-based groupings formed by
species with discoloured males, in which the iridescent
bluish colouration on the wing upperside is replaced by a
brown, golden or silvery colour (the admetus and dolus
groups). Discolouration of males is coupled with an
expansion of the androconial patches, apparently due to a
switch from a visual to a scent-based mate recognition system [18]. Although the molecular analyses also recover a
clade containing exclusively discoloured males (the clade
formed by the admetus and dolus sister-clades), the molecular data reveal that single discoloured species or small
groups of them are also found in most other clades. Discoloured species also appear in many other subgenera of
Polyommatus and related genera which usually have bluish
males. In the sister species pair, M. daphnis/M. marcida ,
the discolouration of the latter taxon (which possibly represents only a conspecific population of the former) is
probably an adaptation to the specific climatic conditions
(low solar radiation) on the north side of Elburs mountains [50]. Such sister species pairs with differing male
upperside colouration are also found in Agrodiaetus , e.g.
A. fabressei/fulgens, A. shahrami/achaemenes, A. erschoffii/
caeruleus and A. hopfferi/lycius (fig. 3).
In some butterfly groups with similar wing patterns, genitalia provide important features for identification and
classification. Unfortunately, they are very similar in all
Agrodiaetus species, possess only few usable characters and
therefore have only rarely been evaluated. The little available evidence, however, appears to be more congruent
with molecular data than with wing pattern characters.
Coutsis [51] analyzed the genitalia of several Agrodiaetus
taxa which had previously been regarded as subspecies of
Agrodiaetus iphigenia due to their similar wing colouration,
among them A. iphidamon and A. iphigenides . He concluded that genitalia differences rule out conspecifity.
According to the molecular results these taxa belong to
different clades. A. iphidamon and A. dizinensis have been

placed in different groups according to wing pattern characters [49], but they share a synapomorphic character in
their genitalia: the shape of the labides is short, pointed
and "dagger-like" (Coutsis, pers. comm.). Molecular
results also clearly show that they are closely related. The
monomorphic Agrodiaetus species of the admetus and dolus
clades differ in karyotype but are difficult or impossible to
identify based on wing pattern characters. Members of
these two clades, however, differ in the length of their
valves relative to their body size, those in the admetus
clade (with the possible exception of A. admetus ) being
shorter than those in the dolus clade [52-54]. A comprehensive treatment of the genitalia of Polyommatina is currently in preparation (Coutsis, pers. comm.).
Historical biogeography
The results of our DIVA analysis confirm earlier assumptions (e.g. [18]) that Eastern Anatolia, Transcaucasia and
Iran are the main centres of Agrodiaetus radiation.
Although the origin of the subgenus could not be inferred
with this method, the ancestral biogeographical areas of
most major clades are placed in this region. Most interestingly, the origin of each of these clades seems to be confined to a single region (or possibly two neighbouring
regions in one case). These results support the evolutionary significance of the clades obtained from the molecular
analyses (ITS2 as well as COI/COII ).
CBCs as predictors of sexual incompatibility and the utility
of ITS2 to delimit species
Due to the low number of CBCs (and hemi-CBCs) in
Lycaenidae, these structural markers cannot be used to
predict species limits in the family. Although this does not
preclude the possibility that a CBC is a sufficient condition to distinguish species [36], an absence of CBCs cannot be used to predict intercrossing ability as suggested by
Coleman [37].

This deficiency does not mean that ITS2 sequences cannot
be used to delimit species. Even in the young radiation of
Agrodiaetus , scarcely any two species have identical ITS2
haplotypes, while the same haplotype may be found in
distant populations of the same species, e.g. Agrodiaetus
damon from France and Turkey. On the other hand,
sequence differences among populations and among
individuals in a single population do exist [18], and we
currently lack sufficient intraspecific ITS2 sequence data
to check for the existence of a barcode gap or diagnostic
DNA characters [22,25]. Available intraspecific ITS2
sequences usually cluster together in the PNJ tree. Exceptions occur in species complexes with disputable species
borders (A. ripartii and A. altivagans ) and in Polyommatus
icarus : the Iranian P. icarus sequence does not cluster with
conspecific sequences but with the almost identical
sequence of P. forsteri , and is even identical with that of
an Iranian specimen (voucher code ILL071) of PolyommaPage 13 of 27

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:300

tus icadius [44]. The latter is a Central Asian species, whose
phenotype is very similar to P. icarus , but which is well
differentiated in ITS2 and was only recently discovered in
Iran [44]. The phenotype of the Iranian P. icarus specimen, however, is typical for P. icarus and its COI sequence
is almost identical to those of P. icarus from Greece and
Anatolia, where P. icadius does not occur [22]. Therefore it
is possible that the specimen (MW00412) actually represents a hybrid between P. icarus and P. icadius . Some evidence for introgressive hybridization between these two
taxa comes from the Altai where P. icarus and P. icadius
share identical COI haplotypes [55]. Although this complex needs further research it is an example for the importance of analysing a fast nuclear locus in addition to the
mitochondrial COI .

Conclusions
Our analyses show that ITS2 can be a suitable phylogenetic marker not only for closely related groups of species,
but also for higher taxa. In the family Lycaenidae, secondary structure information enabled the alignment of
sequences from different subtribes of the tribe Polyommatini.
In Agrodiaetus, six major clades were obtained which are
corroborated by independent evidence from mitochondrial DNA, genitalia structure, as well as our biogeographical analysis. These clades, however, do not correspond
with traditional classifications, which were mainly based
on the very limited set of wing pattern characters.
The use of secondary structure information with Profile
Neighbour Joining also increased resolution and bootstrap support in the subgenus Agrodiaetus to the extent
that ITS2 phylogenetic trees provide a resolution comparable to COI .
In insects, ITS2 currently appears to be the only available
and well tested nuclear DNA marker which is informative
enough to resolve the phylogeny of young radiations such
as Agrodiaetus . Therefore we recommend the use of this
marker as an addition to mitochondrial markers (like COI
) in order to prevent erroneous estimation of species trees
caused by introgressive hybridization, incomplete lineage
sorting or horizontal gene transfer. Although introgression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) appears to be less
common in Lepidoptera than in most other Metazoa due
to their female-heterogametic sex chromosome system
[56] and Haldane's rule [57], recent work shows that such
cases exist (Wiemers unpublished; [58]) and therefore
should not be ignored.
We cannot, however, corroborate the use of CBCs to
delimit species, because CBCs are very rare even among
distantly related species in Lycaenidae and, at least, for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/300

this group their absence is not a useful predictor for sexual
compatibility as claimed by Coleman et al. [37].

Methods
Material
A total of 156 Lycaenidae ITS2 sequences were included
for our analysis. Of these, 17 were exclusively determined
for this study. The remainders were selected from the phylogenetic analysis of the PhD thesis by the first author
[18]. Five of these sequences were improved in quality by
repeating the sequencing procedure.

Generally, only one sequence per species was retained,
except for taxa with a large range or with considerable geographic variation. In the latter case, two sequences representing this variation were retained. Selection criterion
was the sequence quality in order to minimize ambiguities. For three species, the only available sequence was of
insufficient quality and therefore these taxa were excluded
from the analysis (Agrodiaetus surakovi, Aricia eumedon,
Plebejides pylaon ).
Most sequences belong to Agrodiaetus (97), the others to
closely related genera of the same subtribe Polyommatina
(54) or other subtribes within the tribe Polyommatini (5
sequences). Allotinus portunus (Miletinae) was chosen as
outgroup because it was the only non-Polyommatini
sequence available within Lycaenidae which could successfully be aligned. Alignment of sequences from the
tribes Lycaenini, Theclini and Eumaeini failed, despite the
fact that they are held to be more closely related to Polyommatini according to the morphology-based classification by Eliot [59].
All sequences have been deposited in GenBank [10] with
LinkOuts provided to images of the voucher specimens
deposited with MorphBank [60] (table 5). Annotation
changes of existing entries after HMM-Annotation were as
well submitted to this database. No further complete ITS2
sequences of Lycaenidae are currently available from GenBank. The voucher specimens and DNA extractions are
currently stored by the first author at the Department of
Animal Biodiversity, Vienna University, but will eventually be deposited at the Alexander Koenig Research Institute and Museum of Zoology in Bonn (Germany).
In many Agrodiaetus species groups, especially among the
monomorphic, i.e., "brown" species, karyotypes are
important for species identification. Therefore in most of
the specimens included in molecular analysis, the karyotypes were studied [18] using squash techniques [61,62].
Upperside wing colouration of males was classified
according to the method of Lukhtanov et al. (2005) [20].
One additional colour class ("golden" for golden brown)

was added for Agrodiaetus peilei , a species which was not
assessed in their study.
Taxonomy
The subgenera of Polyommatus and Plebejus have often
been attributed generic rank in recent literature, and we
follow this convention for the purposes of the present
paper. The following subgenera are included in these genera: Polyommatus : Cyaniris, Polyommatus, Meleageria,
Lysandra, Neolysandra, Agrodiaetus ; Plebejus : Plebejus, Plebejidea, Plebejides, Lycaeides, Kretania, Albulina, Agriades,
Aricia, Vacciniina . The subgeneric treatment follows Hesselbarth et al. [15] with the following two exceptions:
Lysandra (synonymised with Meleageria by Hesselbarth et
al. [15]) and Lycaeides (synonymised with Plebejus by Hesselbarth et al. [15]).

The status of many taxa in the genus Polyommatus is questionable, especially in the subgenus Agrodiaetus which
includes many recently described species, some based on
disputable evidence. Taxonomic revisions and further
research are needed to clarify the status of these taxa. At
present, we have retained most species in order to facilitate comparisons with published studies, although some
have been synonymised recently. For example, Agrodiaetus
ainsae has been synonymised with A. fulgens [45] and
Vodolazsky et al. [44] treat several Polyommatus taxa as
subspecies or synonyms of P. eros (P. kamtshadalis, P.
eroides and P. menelaos ) and P. icarus (P. andronicus and P.
juno ).
Laboratory protocols
DNA was extracted from thorax tissue recently collected
and preserved in 100% ethanol using QIAGEN® DNeasy Tissue Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol for
mouse tail tissue. Occasionally, only dried material was
available and either thorax or legs were used for DNA
extraction. Amplification of DNA was conducted using
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The reaction mixture (for a total reaction volume of 25 μl) included: 1 μl
DNA, 16.8 μl ddH20, 2.5 μl 10 × PCR II buffer, 3.2 μl 25
mM MgCl2, 0.5 μl 2 mM dNTP-Mix, 0.25 μl Taq Polymerase and 0.375 μl 20 pm of each primer. The two primers
used were ITS3 (5'-GCA TCG ATG AAG AAC GCA GC-3')
and ITS4 (5'-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3') [63].

PCR was conducted on thermal cyclers from BIOMETRA®
(models UNO II or T-GRADIENT) or ABI BIOSYSTEMS® (model
GENEAMP® PCR-System 2700) using the following profiles:
initial 4 minutes denaturation at 94°C and 35 cycles of 30
seconds denaturation at 94°C, 30 seconds annealing at
55°C and 1 minute extension at 72°C.
PCR products were purified using purification kits from
PROMEGA® or SIGMA® and checked with agarose gel electrophoresis before and after purification.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/300

Cycle sequencing was carried out on BIOMETRA® T-GRADIENT or ABI BIOSYSTEMS® GENEAMP® PCR-System 2700 thermal cyclers using sequencing kits of MWG BIOTECH® (for LICOR® automated sequencer) or ABI BIOSYSTEMS® (for ABI®
377 automated sequencer) according to the manufacturers' protocols and with the following cycling times: initial
2 minutes denaturation at 95°C and 35 cycles of 15 seconds denaturation at 95°C, 15 seconds annealing at 49°C
and 15 seconds extension at 70°C. Primers used were the
same as for the PCR reactions for the ABI (primer 1 for forward and primer 2 for independent reverse sequencing).
Electrophoresis of sequencing reaction products was carried out on LI-COR® or ABI® 377 automated sequencers
using the manufacturer's protocols. Electropherograms
were edited and aligned using the LaserGene® Software
SeqMan Pro Version 7.1.0 by DNASTAR®.
Data analysis
Secondary Structure Prediction
Data analysis followed the method described in Schultz &
Wolf [64] for secondary structure phylogenetics. All
retained ITS2 sequences were delimited and cropped with
the HMM-based annotation tool present at the ITS2 database ([65]; E-value < 0.001, metazoan HMMs). This tool
furthermore integrates a visual check for the 5.8S/28S
hybridization as the ITS2 proximal stem. Incorrect folding
of this region is a good indication for pseudogenes [66].
All sequences of this study passed this test with a correct
folding, so that we are confident to exclude pseudogenes
in this study. Furthermore, according to Álvarez & Wendel
[42], ITS pseudogenes have lowered secondary structure
stability and an increase in AT content via deaminations.
This was not the case for our complete ITS2 sequences,
since their secondary structures were stable and the GC
content of each sequence was clearly above 50%. The
proximal stem (25 nucleotides of 5.8S as well as 28S
rDNA) was included to preserve a conserved margin of the
alignment. For several sequences, nucleotides near the 3'
end of the proximal stem were ambiguous. For these,
nucleotides with more than 95% consensus within the
remaining aligned sequences were adopted by the majority rule to preserve the marginal secondary structure of the
RNA. The secondary structure of the ITS2 of Neolysandra
coelestina (MW99013) was predicted with RNA structure
4.6 [67] and ported to Vienna format with CBCanalyzer
1.0.3 [68] (fig. 4). The structures of the remaining
sequences were predicted by custom homology modelling
at the ITS2 database [69-72] with the aforementioned
structure as a template and at least 70% helix transfer
(identity matrix, gap costs: gap open 15, gap extension 2).
We further applied a Nussinov Algorithm (perl script) to
each sequence to close additional base-pairs within helices, which were left open by homology modelling. For
this procedure, no existing base pairs were removed, no
pseudo-knots were allowed and exclusively Watson-Crick
pairs were added (see fig. 5 for examples).

Alignment and Phylogenetic Analyses
Sequences and secondary structures were automatically
and synchronously aligned with 4SALE 1.5 [73,74].
4SALE translates sequence-structure tuple information
prior to alignment into pseudo-proteins. Pseudo-proteins
were coded such that each of the four nucleotides may be
present in three different states: unpaired, opening basepair and closing base-pair. Thus, an ITS2 specific 12 ×
12~scoring matrix was used for calculation of the alignment [73,74]. Sequence-structure alignment is available at
the ITS2 database supplements page [75].

To determine evolutionary distances between organisms
simultaneously on sequences and secondary structures we
used Profile Neighbour Joining (PNJ) [76] as implemented in ProfDistS 0.98 [77,78]. The tree reconstructing
algorithm works similar to the alignment method on a 12
letter alphabet comprised of the 4 nucleotides in three
structural states (unpaired, paired left, paired right). We
applied an ITS2 -specific general time reversible substitution model [73]. Profiles were automatically built for
nodes with bootstrap support values (1000 replicates)
above 70% or with at least 95% nucleotide identities. A
profile is regarded as a sequence, however it is composed
of probability distribution vectors instead of characters.
PNJ is iterated until no more profiles can be defined
according to our settings. The resulting tree was displayed
with iTol v1.3.1[79] and further refined with CorelDRAW
X3 (Corel Corporation, Ottawa, Canada). We utilized
CBCanalyzer 1.1 [73,74] to detect CBCs and hemi-CBCs
between sequence-structure pairs and to calculate a CBC
tree. We used MEGA 4.0.1 [80] to calculate a matrix of pdistances and TCS 1.21 [81] to detect identical haplotypes. MEGA was also used to calculate the bootstrap support values (1000 replicates) of the NJ tree without
secondary structure information using the Tamura-Nei
model of nucleotide substitution with heterogeneous pattern among lineages and gamma distributed rates among

sites. The appropriate model and the gamma parameter
(0.8365) were calculated with MODELTEST 3.7 [82].
Classification procedures
To evaluate the results of our approach we constructed a
classification of Agrodiaetus based on major clusters with
bootstrap values ≥ 50% and compared this classification
with those constructed in similar ways from published
studies which either used the same marker but without
secondary structure information or the mitochondrial
marker COI or both. The clusters were named after the taxonomically most senior taxon. Classifications from published studies were constructed in the following way:

• A classification for ITS2 without secondary structure
information was constructed using major clusters
from the Bayesian analysis conducted by Wiemers
[18] with 84 Agrodiaetus species. Only groups with
Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥ 0.80 were considered.
• From an analysis of 1969 bp COI and COII
sequences from 55 Agrodiaetus species, Kandul et al.
[19] proposed a classification of 12 major clades using
Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian inference most of
which have high bootstrap and Bayesian support. One
notable exception is clade VII (carmon clade) which
has no support and should have been combined with
clade VI (antidolus clade) and clade VIII (ninae clade).
• Lukhtanov et al. [20] used an extended set of COI
+COII sequences from 80 Agrodiaetus species and proposed 8 major clades based on Maximum Likelihood
inference of phylogeny all of which are supported by
bootstrap values > 50%.
• Kandul et al. [21] produced a Maximum Likelihood
tree of a further extended set of COI +COII sequences

Conserved ITS2 secondary structure of the Polyommatina
Conserved ITS2 secondary structure of the Polyommatina. The proximal stem of hybridized 5.8S (blue) and
28S (red) rDNA is included. Helices are numbered in Roman
numerals. Two small helices are found near the beginning,
which are referred to as helices I.a and I.b. The first (basal)
internal bulge of helix II with two nucleotides mismatching
one nucleotide is the typical U-U mismatch found in the second helix of ITS2 structures throughout the Eukaryota.
Degree of conservation is displayed in colour grades from
green (conserved) to red (unconserved). The complete
structure represents the 51% consensus of aligned structures
without gaps.

Biogeographical analysis
A dispersal-vicariance analysis was conducted with the
programme DIVA 1.2 [83] to infer the ancestral distributions in the phylogeny of Agrodiaetus . Since outgroup
relationships of Agrodiaetus were not well resolved in previous studies, A. damon was used as the outgroup to the
remaining Agrodiaetus species according to our complete
PNJ analysis (Fig. 1). The distribution area of Agrodiaetus
was divided into 11 biogeographical regions which are
based on floral biogeographical regions [84]:

• C Eurosiberian: the Central European region (incl.
the Central Siberian subregion) and the Pontic - South
Siberian region
• Mediterranean: the Submediterranean and Mediterranean regions excl. the South Anatolian and Palestinian - Lebanese provinces
