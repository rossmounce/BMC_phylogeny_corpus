As with many viruses, retroviruses do not always restrict
themselves to a single host species. Phylogenetic analyses
of human and other primate retroviruses conducted during the past twenty years has revealed that the pandemic
human retroviruses, human immunodeficiency viruses
(HIV) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV), were
each the result of multiple independent introductions of
viruses from nonhuman primates (NHPs) to humans.
Nevertheless, whether such transmission of retroviruses
was limited to rare historical occurrences or is part of an
ongoing process has remained unclear. A series of recent
findings by our group, focused on occupationally exposed
individuals, has demonstrated that far from being a historical oddity, the transmission of retroviruses from NHPs
to humans is a regular and ongoing phenomenon. Here,
we review the evidence for emerging retrovirus zoonosis,
both from captive animals to lab workers and primate
handlers, as well as from wild NHPs to people exposed
through hunting, butchering, and keeping of wild animal
'pets' in central Africa. The results show that three new retroviruses previously undocumented in humans including
the simian foamy viruses, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4 have all
been identified in persons exposed to the blood and body
fluids of NHPs. The regular transmission of primate retroviruses suggests that zoonosis, per se, may not be the rate
limiting step in pandemic retrovirus emergence, and that
other factors such as viral adaptation probably play an
important role in successful cross-species transmission
and pandemic human retrovirus emergence. The results
reinforce the need for defining the public health implications of the emergence of the new retroviruses and for
ongoing surveillance efforts aimed at documenting and
predicting the retrovirus emergence process.
