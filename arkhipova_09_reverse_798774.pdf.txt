Reverse transcriptases (RT) are central to retrovirology (as
the key enzymes encoded by retroviruses) as well as to
evolutionary genomics (as the only unifying component
for numerous types of retroelements inhabiting genomic
DNA in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes). A great deal of
effort has been put into understanding the evolutionary
relationships between RT-containing entities, including
retroviruses, retrotransposons, and reverse transcriptaserelated genes such as telomerases. However, there is still
no consensus on phylogenetic history of retroelements [13]. The recent explosion in the amounts of genome
sequence data from evolutionarily diverse organisms provides us with a rich source of novel RT-related sequences,
which may be regarded as evolutionary intermediates and
''missing links'' connecting seemingly unrelated groups of
reverse transcriptases. Our genomic surveys of rotifers of
the Class Bdelloidea and comparisons with data from
other sequenced genomes provided us with a number of
examples of novel RT sequences fitting this description,
including both published [3-5] and unpublished findings. Structure-based alignments and comparisons of RTassociated N- and C-terminal extension domains in newly
identified groups of retroelements reveal deeper evolutionary connections between different RT classes than previously uncovered by phylogenetic analyses of the core RT
domain spanning the seven most highly conserved
motifs. Reverse transcriptase-related genes appear to be
more common than previously thought, and may have
independently given rise to mobile genetic elements several times in early evolution, via subsequent association
with various catalytic domains able to cleave target
genomic DNA and thereby confer intragenomic mobility
to retroelement-encoded RNAs.
