Adaptive molecular evolution of the Major
Histocompatibility Complex genes, DRA and DQA,
in the genus Equus
Pauline L Kamath1* and Wayne M Getz1,2

Abstract
Background: Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes are central to vertebrate immune response and are
believed to be under balancing selection by pathogens. This hypothesis has been supported by observations of
extremely high polymorphism, elevated nonsynonymous to synonymous base pair substitution rates and transspecies polymorphisms at these loci. In equids, the organization and variability of this gene family has been
described, however the full extent of diversity and selection is unknown. As selection is not expected to act
uniformly on a functional gene, maximum likelihood codon-based models of selection that allow heterogeneity in
selection across codon positions can be valuable for examining MHC gene evolution and the molecular basis for
species adaptations.
Results: We investigated the evolution of two class II MHC genes of the Equine Lymphocyte Antigen (ELA), DRA
and DQA, in the genus Equus with the addition of novel alleles identified in plains zebra (E. quagga, formerly E.
burchelli). We found that both genes exhibited a high degree of polymorphism and inter-specific sharing of allele
lineages. To our knowledge, DRA allelic diversity was discovered to be higher than has ever been observed in
vertebrates. Evidence was also found to support a duplication of the DQA locus. Selection analyses, evaluated in
terms of relative rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) averaged over the gene region,
indicated that the majority of codon sites were conserved and under purifying selection (dN <dS). However, the
most likely evolutionary codon models allowed for variable rates of selection across codon sites at both loci and, at
the DQA, supported the hypothesis of positive selection acting on specific sites.
Conclusions: Observations of elevated genetic diversity and trans-species polymorphisms supported the
conclusion that balancing selection may be acting on these loci. Furthermore, at the DQA, positive selection was
occurring at antigen binding sites, suggesting that a few selected residues may play a significant role in equid
immune function. Future studies in natural equid populations will be valuable for understanding the functional
significance of the uniquely diverse DRA locus and for elucidating the mechanism maintaining diversity at these
MHC loci.

Background
Genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
are ideal candidates for investigating the influence of
selection in promoting patterns of genetic diversity [1,2],
due to their ecological significance. This multi-gene
family has been widely demonstrated to play a fundamental role in gnathostome (i.e. jawed vertebrate)

immune response by modulation of resistance to parasites and pathogens [1,3,4]. More specifically, class I and
II MHC genes encode cell-surface glycoproteins that
recognize foreign antigen molecules and, subsequently,
present them to T-lymphocytes to initiate an immune
system response in the host [5]. The MHC is known to
be the most polymorphic gene region in vertebrates
and, in humans, exhibits levels of nucleotide diversity
that are two times higher than the genomic average [6].
Evidence from studies of natural populations suggests
that this elevated genetic diversity is driven and

maintained by exposure to pathogens and parasites in
the environment. For example, studies on sheep [7,8],
mice [9], voles [10] and lemurs [11] have found relationships between gastrointestinal parasites and MHC diversity or associations between specific alleles and infection
levels. This vital role for the MHC in pathogen recognition has been the subject of much investigation. Further
study of selection at the molecular level, however, is
imperative to facilitate understanding of the mechanistic
basis for adaptation in natural systems.
The MHC is believed to be under strong selective balancing pressure (reviewed in [12]) under the key hypothesized mechanisms of negative frequency-dependent
[13,14] and overdominant selection [3,15,16]. Balancing
selection is often supported by three lines of evidence: (1)
elevated levels of polymorphism, (2) higher rates of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions than what would be expected under neutral
evolution [15,16] and (3) trans-species polymorphisms
with alleles among species maintained over longer evolutionary time than those observed at neutral loci [17]. In
support of the latter observation, MHC allelic lineages of
some mammals are thought to be millions of years old
and allele divergences often pre-date species divergences
[18]. As a result, alleles from different species may be
more closely related than alleles within a species [19].
MHC trans-specific diversity has been demonstrated in
many natural systems, including fish [20], rodents
[18,21-24], ungulates [25,26], carnivores [27,28] and primates [29]. The persistence of highly divergent alleles over
time may be explained by the hypothesis that increased
diversity confers a fitness advantage to the host with an
ability to recognize a broader spectrum of pathogens [30].
The extent to which selection is responsible for the
observed mode of MHC evolution requires an in-depth
look at patterns of variation occurring across the gene.
The nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio
(ω = dN/dS) has been widely used as a measure of selective
pressure on a gene (reviewed in [31]). Whereas ratios larger than one indicate a fitness advantage for mutations
resulting in an amino acid change (i.e. positive selection),
ratios smaller than one suggest selection against deleterious mutations (i.e. purifying selection). Within a MHC
molecule only a limited proportion of amino acids have
been found to be involved in antigen recognition and
binding [15] and, thus, dN/dS estimates averaged across
the gene can be misleading. Site-specific selection analyses
have proven to be useful for elucidating how rates of evolution can vary across a gene region and for pin-pointing
particular sites under selection [31,32], such as those that
specifically interact and recognize foreign peptides. Sitespecific methods have found elevated dN/dS ratios at these
antigen binding sites (ABS), suggesting substantially differing rates of evolution across the MHC [33].

MHC genes of the family Equidae, also called the
Equine Lymphocyte Antigen (ELA), are similar in organization to those of humans, with adjacent class I, II
and III regions [34], and their structure and overall
function are believed to be conserved [35]. Despite these
similarities, the evolution of the ELA has been shown to
differ in some ways from other species. For example, the
most striking observation is that the ELA comprises at
least two homologues of the class II DQA locus distributed on two different chromosomes, a phenomenon
which has never been observed in any other mammalian
species [36]. In situ hybridization studies have localized
the ELA to chromosome 20q14-q22 [37,38], except for a
single DQA homologue which was localized to chromosome 5 [39]. Further examination of differences in the
ELA revealed that the class II DRA locus, exon 2, has
greater allelic variation in Equidae than in most other
taxa [40,41]. For example, in the domestic horse (Equus
callabus), ass (E. asinus), mountain zebra (E. zebra) and
plains zebra (E. quagga, formerly E. burchelli), 5-6 alleles
per species have been detected [41-44], in contrast to
the majority of species which have little to no sequence
variation at this locus (e.g. [45-48]). The DRA and DQA
loci are known to be paralogous, encoding the a-chain
of a MHC class II molecule, and have a similar function
in presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. However, the considerable difference in levels of
diversity between these genes remains unexplained. Several studies have described the variability of ELA-DRA
and DQA loci of the MHC [36,40,41], but there is still
little understanding of the functional significance of
these observed differences in ELA genes and how selection may be acting at the molecular level (but see [44]).
In this study, we investigated the molecular evolution of
two MHC class II genes, ELA-DRA and DQA, within the
genus Equus. This study combined previously discovered
allelic data [36,41,44] with new genetic data collected from
natural populations of plains zebra (E. quagga/E. burchelli). Our objectives were to: (1) characterize inter-specific
genetic variation, (2) elucidate evolutionary relationships
among alleles and (3) detect molecular-level patterns of
selection at these loci. We hypothesize that these genes
are highly variable and under balancing selection, and that
positive selection is occurring at specific functional codon
sites in equids. A better understanding of the variability
and evolution of ELA genes will provide valuable background for future studies that aim to examine the genetic
basis of susceptibility or resistance to pathogens in both
domestic and wild equids.

Methods
Sample collection and DNA isolation

Fecal, blood and tissue samples were collected from
plains zebra (E. quagga/E. burchelli) in two parks of

Kamath and Getz BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:128

southern Africa: Etosha National Park, Namibia (n = 38)
and Kruger National Park, South Africa (n = 33). For
the purposes of consistency with historical ELA allele
nomenclature, we hereafter refer to the species by its
former scientific name, E. burchelli. With fecal samples,
three to five pellets were collected from each individual
and allowed to dry. Epithelial cells from the outermost
mucosal layer were scraped from the desiccated pellets
using a sterile razor blade. Tissue samples were preserved in DMSO/EDTA/Tris/salt solution and blood
samples in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). All
samples were stored at-20°C until DNA extraction. Sample collection was approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee (Protocol #R217-0510B) at UC Berkeley.
Whole genomic DNA was extracted from blood and
tissue using Qiagen kits (Valencia, CA). Non-invasive
samples, collected from feces, are subject to contamination, enzyme degradation (e.g. [49]), and hydrolytic and
oxidative damage that may result in lower DNA yield
and increased error rates (most commonly allele dropout [50]). Thus, we used the AquaGenomics protocol
(MultiTarget Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) optimized for fecal
DNA extraction. A few fecal samples suffered degradation which resulted in failed PCR-amplifications. These
degraded samples were re-extracted using the QIAmp
fecal extraction kit (Qiagen), also designed specifically
for fecal DNA extraction.
PCR-amplification and sequencing

We targeted two MHC loci of the Equine Lymphocyte
Antigen (ELA) system, ELA-DRA and DQA, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [51] and genotyped these loci
through direct sequence-based typing. We amplified 246
bp of the DRA using equid-specific primers, Be3 and
Be4 [42], and 205 bp of the DQA using the primers
DQA-2e and DQA-2f [36]. These primers targeted the
functionally significant exon 2 of both genes, a region
consisting of antigen binding sites (ABS) as predicted by
their human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) equivalent [52].
PCR mixes (total reaction volume of 15 μL) for both
genes contained approximately 25-50 ng DNA, 2 uL
GeneAmp 10 × PCR buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3,
500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin), 1 U
AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems),
0.4 mM dNTPs, 15 μg bovine serum albumin (New
England BioLabs) and 0.50 μM of each primer.
Amplification of the DRA locus used the following
“touch-down” thermocycling profile: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min; 2 cycles of 94°C for 1 min,
60°C for 1 min, and 70°C for 35 s; 18 cycles of 93°C for
45 s, 59°C for 45 s, and 70°C for 45 s, with the annealing temperature decreasing by 0.5°C with each cycle;
35 cycles of 92°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 70°C for
1 min; final extension at 72°C for 10 min to allow for

complete amplification of the targeted gene. PCR-amplification of the DQA locus used the following thermocycling profile: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 6 min;
40 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 56°C for 45 s, and 72°C for
1 min; final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
DRA amplicons were purified prior to sequencing by
incubating with Exonuclease I and Shrimp Alkaline
Phosphatase at 37°C for 30 minutes. Purified products
were cycle-sequenced in both forward and reverse directions using the Big Dye® Terminator v.3.1 kit and run
on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
Identification of MHC alleles

Sequence chromatograms were edited and aligned using
the software Geneious 4.7 [53]. Allelic phase for DRA
heterozygous sequences was determined by computational inference with the haplotype reconstruction program PHASE v.2.1 [54]. This program has been found
to be accurate in determining allelic phase even in
extremely variable loci, such as the MHC [55] and,
therefore, is considered to be a reliable method for allele
identification. We conducted five runs, using different
initial random seed values, and compared phase results
across runs. A threshold posterior probability of 0.9, a
value considered significantly higher than the standard
(see [56]), was used to assess the accuracy of the allelic
phase determination. Individuals not meeting this
threshold were dropped from use in further analyses.
Given the large number of heterozygous sites in the
DQA locus and previous evidence for multiple loci [36],
all PCR-amplicons were cloned and sequenced to identify novel haplotypes. PCR products were extracted and
purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, (Valencia, CA) and cloning was performed using a TOPOTA® cloning kit with Mach 1™-T1R competent cells
(Invitrogen). Amplicons were ligated into pCR®4 TOPO
vectors and transformed into E. coli competent cells.
Sixteen to twenty-three positive clones per individual
were picked with a sterile toothpick and screened by
sequencing (protocol described above). The high number of PCR-amplified clones was sufficient to avoid
errors, such as recombinant sequences generated during
PCR [57]. Each allele was confirmed with at least two
observations, meaning that it had to be found in at least
one homozygous individual or two heterozygous individuals to be included in the following analyses.
Sequence data and alignments

Novel MHC alleles identified in E. burchelli were
compiled with a reference panel of Equidae sequences
(GenBank, NCBI), including horse (E. callabus), ass
(E. asinus), onager (E. hemionus), kiang (E. kiang), plains
zebra (E. burchelli), mountain zebra (E. zebra), Grevy’s

zebra (E. grevyi) and Przewalski’s horse (E. przewalski).
A list of ELA-DRA and DQA sequences from each
equid species and their respective GenBank accession
numbers are listed in Additional file 1. As the ELAMHC nomenclature is currently in revision, names for
previously discovered alleles follow designations given in
Janova et al. (2009) and novel sequences discovered
here were named based on the recommendations outlined by the MHC allele nomenclature committee [58].
The new nomenclature is expected to be established
soon on the IPD-MHC Database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
ipd/mhc). Identical alleles shared between species were
given species-specific numbering. Reference and novel
nucleotide, and corresponding amino acid sequences
were aligned using the Geneious 4.7 sequence alignment
tool and editor [53].
Statistical analyses of diversity and evolution

Standard descriptive diversity indices for each locus
within the genus Equidae were calculated using MEGA4
[59]. These indices included the number of alleles (A),
variable nucleotide positions (VNP), parsimony informative positions (PIP), transition/transversion bias ratio
(R), Kimura 2-parameter gamma (K2P+Γ) evolutionary
distance (d) and Poisson-corrected amino acid distance.
The K2P+Γ model accounts for multiple hits, differences
in transitional and transversional substitution rates and
variation in substitution rates among sites following a
gamma-shaped distribution. Estimates of the gamma
shape parameter (a) were determined in PAUP*v4.0b0
[60] to be a = 0.9872 for the DRA data and a = 0.4181
for the DQA data. Standard error of distance estimates
were obtained by using a bootstrap procedure with
10,000 pseudoreplicates.
Four different methods, implemented in RDP v.3.44
beta package [61], were used to test for recombination
and detect potential recombinant events: (1) RDP, (2)
GENECONV, (3) Maximum Chi, and (4) BootScan. The
highest acceptable p-value for all methods was set at a
conservative value of 0.10, with a Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons and a window size of 30 variable nucleotides for all approaches except BootScan. For
analyses in BootScan, 1,000 bootstrap replicates were
conducted under the Kimura model (transition/transversion ratio = 1.341), with a window size of 100 bp, step
size of 20 nucleotides and cut-off value of 0.70.
Selection, averaged across the gene, was estimated
using MEGA4 [59] in terms of the relative rates of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) base pair substitutions, according to Nei and Gojobori (1986) with the
Jukes and Cantor correction for multiple hits [62]. Ztests of selection were performed over all sites, and
separately at ABS and non-ABS, under the null hypothesis of neutrality (d N = d S ) and the alternative

Page 4 of 16

hypotheses of non-neutrality (dN ≠ dS), positive selection
(dN >dS), and purifying selection (dN <dS).
Site-specific selection analyses

As selection will realistically act on only a small subset
of amino acids in a protein, averaging substitution rates
over entire gene regions is considered to be a conservative indicator of positive selection [31]. Therefore, we
used a more powerful maximum-likelihood based
method, implemented in the CodeML subroutine of the
software PAML [63] which allows the rates of ω = dN/
dS to vary among codons [31,64]. This method has been
suggested to be more sensitive than other methods for
detection of molecular evidence of selection [65]. The
models employed here, called ‘random-sites’ models, do
not require a priori information on the functional significance of each site and estimate the nonsynonymous to
synonymous rate ratio (ω) to indicate selective pressure
at the protein level (ω < 1: purifying selection, ω = 1:
neutral evolution, ω > 1: positive selection). In this analysis, we used the Equidae alignments to assess heterogeneity in ω across the two MHC genes (DRA and
DQA) and to identify codons under positive selection.
We fit the alignment to the following codon ‘randomsites’ models, in PAML: M0 (one ratio: best average ω
across all sites), M1a (nearly neutral: estimates the proportion of sites that best-fit ω = 0 versus those best-fit
by ω = 1), M2a (positive selection: adds a third set of
sites to M1a that have ω > 1 and estimates the best-fit
for this added ω value and associated proportion of
sites), M3 (discrete: fits proportions and ω values
assuming three classes of sites labeled 0, 1, and 2 such
that ω0 <ω1 ≤ ω2), M7 (beta: ω is beta-distributed on [0,
[1]]) and M8 (beta and omega: a proportion of sites are
beta-distributed on [0, [1]] and the remaining proportion have an average ω2 > 1 [32]). M0 is the only model
that does not allow for variation in ω across codon sites.
Whereas M1a and M7 allow only for neutral evolution
and purifying selection at some proportion of sites,
M2a, M3, and M8 also allow for the possibility of positive selection at a proportion of sites.
Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used to compare
nested models based on their log-likelihood [66]. We
compared M0 and M3 to test for the significance of heterogeneity in ω across sites, whereas M1a was compared
with M2a, and M7 with M8 to test for positive selection.
Significant adaptive evolution was inferred if twice the
difference in log-likelihood values was greater than the
chi-square critical value for the given degrees of freedom. We used the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB)
approach [67] to estimate mean ω and standard errors
across codon positions. Specific sites under positive
selection were indicated by estimates of ω > 1 and posterior probabilities > 0.95. This approach accounts for

sampling errors in the maximum likelihood estimates of
the parameters and has a low false positive rate. Tree
files used in PAML analyses were generated using a
maximum likelihood approach in PhyML [68], under
the Kimura 3-parameter and the Kimura 2-paramter
model of nucleotide substitution for the DRA and DQA
locus, respectively. Models of nucleotide substitution
and the distribution of rate variation across nucleotide
sites (gamma) were estimated in PAUP*v4.0b0 [60].
Phylogenetic reconstructions

Phylogenetic relationships among Equidae DRA and
DQA sequences were reconstructed using a Bayesian
approach implemented in MrBayes 3.1 [69]. The data
set was partitioned and the best-fit models were determined for each codon position using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in MODELTEST v.3.7 [70].
Bayesian inference involved running six Metropoliscoupled MCMC chains (1 cold and 5 heated) simultaneously at n incremental temperature of 0.1, and chains
were run for seven and sixteen million generations for
the DRA and DQA data, respectively. Trees were
sampled every 100 generations and the first 25% of trees
found were discarded, leaving the remaining trees to be
used for estimating the consensus tree. Two independent analyses were conducted and results were compared to check for convergence by confirming that the
average deviation of split frequencies approached 0
(with values less than 0.01). We also checked that the
potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) approached 1
and that chains mixed sufficiently (with chain mixing
values greater than 0.2 between chain pairs). Finally, we
used the program Tracer v1.4 [71] to ensure whether
sampling from the posterior distribution of each parameter was sufficient and had reached a large enough
effective sample size (ESS > 200) for accurate parameter
estimation. Posterior probabilities, representing the
probability that a specific node is observed, were
recorded. This analysis was run on both non-partitioned
and partitioned data, and the optimal model was determined using Bayes Factors.

DRA sequences from Bos taurus (DQ821713), Ovis
aries (Z11600) and Sus scrofa (AY754888) obtained
from GenBank (NCBI) were used as outgroups. For
DQA trees, available sequences from B. taurus (AB54
8942), O. aries (M33304) and S. scrofa (EU195146) were
used as outgroups.

Results
Alleles amplified from the DRA, exon 2, in E. burchelli
represented a single locus. Overall, we found 9 unique
DRA alleles with haplotype phase certainties greater
than the threshold probability value of 90% and which
were observed at least twice in our sample. Of the
alleles observed, five were novel sequences (DRA*07*11) never seen before in plains zebra [GenBank:
HQ637392-HQ637396]. Two of these newly discovered
alleles have previously been found in other equid species
(Eqbu-DRA*07 is identical to Eqas-DRA*01 of E. asinus;
Eqbu-DRA*08 identical to Eqca-DRA*04 of E. callabus).
In the E. burchelli sample, 21 unique DQA alleles
were found through cloning which met our requirements for this study. We found 13 novel alleles in E.
burchelli, Eqbu-DQA*09-*21 [GenBank: HQ637397HQ637409]. One of these, Eqbu-DQA*09, is identical to
the E. callabus allele, Eqca-DQA*07. Cloning of the
DQA revealed between 1-4 different alleles in each individual, indicating the presence of at least two DQA
homologous loci.
Inter-and intra-specific analyses of diversity

Nucleotide alignments of all DQA sequences from
Equus revealed considerable sequence diversity at this
locus within the genus and at the species level (Additional file 2). This observation is consistent with the
extreme level of polymorphism typically found at MHC
genes [6]. In contrast, DRA alignments showed notably
lower levels of nucleotide variation (Additional file 3).
However, it should be noted that the nucleotide and
amino acid diversity observed at the DRA in Equidae is
unusually high relative to what has been reported at this
locus in other taxa (Table 1).

Both within E. burchelli and among Equidae, genetic
diversity (including number of variable sites, number of
parsimony informative sites, number of alleles, nucleotide diversity) was greater at the DQA than DRA.
(Tables 2 and 3). Mean evolutionary divergence was low
(1.3%) across all DRA sequences (Table 2), ranging from
0-3.5% in all pairwise sequence comparisons. In contrast, mean divergence was higher at the DQA (13.7%)
and ranged from 0-52.1% between sequence pairs. Interestingly, amino acid distances were greater than evolutionary distances between pairs of nucleotide sequences
at both loci. Within other Equus species, mean evolutionary distances showed a similar pattern with the
exception of E. asinus and E. hemionus, where average
sequence divergences at the DQA locus were low (1.5%
and 2.7%, respectively), however sample sizes from both
species were also low (Table 3).
Global selection analyses

The DRA and DQA nucleotide sequence encoded an
81 and 67 amino acid protein sequence, respectively
(Figures 1 and 2). Protein sequence alignments,
including reference Equidae data, revealed 8 synonymous and 7 nonsynonymous mutations at the DRA
locus. In contrast, the DQA exhibited 60 synonymous
and 37 nonsynonymous mutations. Eqbu-DQA*21 had
a stop codon at position 64 (Figure 2) and was
excluded from all other analyses with the exception of
phylogenetic reconstructions. Along with the cloning
results, this observation implied the presense of a
duplicate non-functional DQA locus. Analyses of the
d N /d S ratio averaged across the whole coding region
suggested that purifying selection is occurring at the
DRA (dN/dS = 0.32) and no selection, or neutral evolution (dN/dS = 0.99), at the DQA (Table 2). By species,
evidence for positive selection was only found at the
DQA within E. kiang (d N /d S = 2.36; Table 3). Z-tests
performed across all codon sites were not statistically
significant (p > 0.05), and therefore we could not
reject (at the 5% level) the null hypothesis of neutral
evolution at both MHC loci (Table 4). In summary,
estimates of dN/dS suggested it is unlikely that positive
selection is acting at the level of the entire gene (with
dN/dS ≤ 1).

Site-specific selection analyses

It is unlikely for selection to act uniformly across a gene
over evolutionary time, but more probable for it to
occur at specific sites based on their functional role. For
the DRA, Z-tests performed on non-ABS separately
were significant (p = 0.049) providing weak evidence for
purifying selection at these sites, whereas we could not
reject the null hypothesis of neutral evolution at the
ABS (Table 4). At the DQA, Z-tests by site type also
could not reject the null hypothesis of neutrality (p >
0.05). However, for both loci, results from the selection
analyses in PAML revealed that the model allowing for
variable evolutionary rates across codon sites (M3) provided a better fit to the data than the model of one evolutionary rate across sites (M0). Also, models including
positive selection (M2a and M8) had higher log-likelihoods that those excluding positive selection (M1a and
M7) (Table 5).
At the DRA, both M2a and M8 had equivalent likelihoods and suggested that approximately 10% of sites
were possibly under positive selection (ω = 3.40) with
the remaining sites under purifying selection (ω =
0.04) (Table 5). Using a LRT, the model of one evolutionary rate across sites (M0) was rejected (p = 0.006)
for the alternative model predicting variable rates of
evolution (M3) across DRA codons. However, the
models of neutral evolution (M1a, M7) could not be
rejected (p = 0.188, p = 0.204). Posterior means of ω
estimated across DRA codons under positive selection
models predicted four sites (positions 14, 19, 47, 49)
that may be under selection (ω > 1), two of which are
also putative ABS based on the HLA equivalents [52].
However, as posterior probabilities for these site predictions were less than 95% and positive selection
models (M2a and M8) by which these sites were identified were not significant, the hypothesis that positive
selection is occurring at these specific DRA codons
requires further investigation.
At the DQA, the discrete model (of 3 discrete evolutionary rate classes: M3) had the highest log-likelihood
and estimated that approximately 44% of codon sites
had ω values greater than one (36% with ω = 1.68; 8%
with ω = 6.80) with the remaining 56% of sites being
assigned ω values close to 0 (ω = 0.08) (Table 5).

Likelihood ratio tests revealed significant variation in
selection across codon sites and positive selection occurring at specific sites (p < 0.001) (Table 5). Posterior
means of ω across DQA codon sites, estimated by models M2a and M8, predicted that 5 codons (positions 2,

(Figure 3). Furthermore, two DQA codons (positions 52,

with non-significant posterior probabilities (< 95%).

small window sizes. Despite these measures, which are
known to increase the potential for detecting false positive recombinant events [61], no recombination was
detected. This supports the conclusion that recombination does not play a major role in the generation of
diversity at these loci.

appear to be more closely related than alleles from the
same species. Also, there were many unresolved nodes,
with posterior probabilities < 95%, throughout the tree.
The DRA tree had only one well supported clade including all equid DRA alleles. In contrast, the DQA tree

exhibited multiple well supported clades (posterior
probability > 95%). There was one major clade which
formed two distinct clusters, encompassing the majority
of equid DQA alleles, but also a second smaller, more
divergent clade comprised of 6 alleles. This smaller
clade included the allele that contains a stop codon,
Eqbu-DQA*21. Alleles Eqbu-DQA*18, Eqbu-DQA*08 and
Eqca-DQA*13 fell out basal to both clades.
We observed a large number of identical alleles across
species (Table 3). Overall, there were 33 and 55 alleles
in DRA and DQA, respectively, when accounting for all
unique alleles in each Equus species (i.e. allowing for
identical alleles across species). Identical allele sharing
was more prevalent at the DRA locus, with 7 of the 22
unique alleles found in multiple species, whereas a
lower proportion of the unique haplotypes (5 out of 48)
were shared by two or more species at the DQA locus.

Discussion
The characterization of diversity and selection patterns
within MHC genes is imperative for understanding their
adaptive significance in host immune function. This
study found elevated levels of polymorphism and compelling evidence for selection acting on the class II
MHC genes, DRA and DQA, within the genus Equus
with the contribution of many novel alleles identified in

E. burchelli. In particular, the average pair-wise amino
acid distance among alleles was observed to be greater
than nucleotide-based distances in both loci, reflecting
an excess of nonsynonymous mutations relative to
synonymous mutations. Although global estimates of
d N /d S averaged across all codon sites contradict the
hypothesis of positive selection at these loci, codonbased evolution models that allowed for heterogeneous
selection pressure across codon sites best-fit the data.
Furthermore, codon models incorporating positive selection were also significant at the DQA. Most notably,
site-specific selection analyses at this locus suggested
that positive selection is occurring at particular codons
associated with foreign antigen binding.
Selection at antigen binding sites

Despite the observation of high levels of functional
diversity, whole gene-level selection analyses based on
the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios
(d N /dS ) revealed no evidence for positive selection at
either locus in Equus. However, it is well known that for
many functional proteins dS is often greater than dN (i.e.
purifying selection) due to strong functional and structural constraints. Consequently, selection detection
methods that average over entire coding regions can be

misleading when selective pressures differ substantially
across codons; They are unlikely to find elevated nonsynonymous mutation rates and, therefore, have low
power to detect signatures of positive selection (e.g.
[72,73]). The codon models implemented in this study,
however, allowed for selection to vary across codon sites
and did, in fact, suggest that a large proportion of sites
were conserved, particularly at the DRA. More importantly, as even small, single amino acid changes can
have a significant impact on gene function these models
proved to be valuable for detecting specific targets of
selection.
The primary function of classical MHC molecules is
to initiate host immune response through the presentation of foreign and self-peptides to T-cells. Studies have
shown incredible diversity and elevated nonsynonymous
mutations at the ABS of these genes, which is believed
to increase the host’s ability to recognize a diverse range
of pathogens [15,16]. This underlies the hypothesis that
pathogen-driven selection is a primary mechanism sustaining extreme diversity at the MHC [1,3]. In agreement with this, we found that all five DQA codons
under significant positive selection were also predicted
to be ABS (Figure 3). Of the two sites where weaker statistical support for selection was found, only one of

these (positions 52) was not a putative ABS. However,
this codon was noted to be proximate to an ABS and
may play a potential associative role in peptide recognition. This finding is significant as it not only supports
the hypothesized pathogen-driven mechanism driving
the diversity observed at the DQA, but also identifies
candidate amino acid residues that may play a significant role in equid immune response.
Effect of recombination

Although the maximum likelihood based approach used
in this study has proven to be powerful in testing for

site heterogeneity in selection and in identifying critical
amino acids under positive selection [74,75], the presence of recombination can violate the assumptions of
the codon-models. We expect that, even if recombination has occurred during the evolution of these genes,
the effects on the outcome of our results would be
minimal. Anisimova et al. (2003) tested the effect of
recombination through simulations and concluded that
the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) was robust to the presence of low levels of recombination in a dataset. At
higher levels of recombination, however, false positive
detection rate could be extremely high (up to 90%).

Recombination can be difficult to detect, but we found
no evidence for its occurrence when using four different
approaches. Moreover, M7 and M8 in CodeML, have
been shown to be relatively robust to the influence of
recombination on selection estimates [76]. As our
results from LRTs of all three sets of nested models on
the DQA were highly significant, including M7 versus
M8, we conclude that our conclusions hold up even
under the low likelihood of undetected recombination.
Trans-species polymorphisms and balancing selection

Balancing selection is expected to preserve high levels of
polymorphisms at MHC loci by retaining alleles during
species diversification events [77,78]. The lack of allele
clustering by species, in reconstructions of DQA and
DRA phylogenies, suggests that MHC allele divergence
pre-dates that of species divergence in Equidae. This
pattern contrasts that previously found in equid phylogenies based on neutral genetic markers, including
microsatellites [79] and mitochondrial DNA [80], as well
as non-neutral globin gene trees [81], all of which have
shown distinct allele segregation by taxon. The discordance between MHC gene phylogenies and other gene
phylogenies has similarly been seen among other vertebrate taxa (e.g. [24]) and has been attributed to balancing selecting acting on these loci due to their role in
foreign peptide recognition. Trans-species polymorphisms were well supported in the Equidae DQA phylogeny, providing evidence for balancing selection acting
on this locus. However, our DRA data revealed only one
well supported clade (posterior probability > 95%) and,
thus, caution must be used in its interpretation. Specifically, the limited availability of sequence variation at the
DRA largely affected our ability to predict the phylogenetic relationships among alleles and, thus, further
examination of diversity in flanking regions of this locus
would be useful for clarifying the mode of evolution
occurring at this locus. However, the observations of
extensive allele sharing among species, in conjunction
with unique levels of DRA amino acid diversity in Equus
relative to other taxa (see further discussion below), is
compatible with the hypothesis that selection is acting
to promote or maintain diversity at this locus in equids.
MHC gene evolution and evidence for DQA duplication

Cloning results suggested at least two DQA loci in E.
burchelli, corroborating a previous study in the domestic
horse [36]. Fraser and Bailey (1998) discovered that the
horse allele, Eqca-DQA*13, is derived from a DQA
homologue localized to chromosome 5, separate from
the primary MHC cluster on chromosome 20. This
represented the first time MHC genes were found on
more than one chromosome [39]; although, there was a
recent report of MHC genes distributed over four

Page 13 of 16

chromosomes in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) [82].
Little is known about whether the DQA homologue is
polymorphic in equids. In our phylogeny, the plains
zebra allele, Eqbu-DQA*08, clustered with this putative
duplicate allele basal to the primary clades and, therefore, could be a variant of the duplicate locus. Further
study is necessary to determine the functionality and
expression of this second DQA locus.
Bayesian phylogenies showed at least two DQA allele
clades (Figure 5), one of which encompasses the majority of all equid DQA alleles known to date. The second
smaller clade is more divergent and includes the putative ‘pseudogene’ allele, Eqbu-DQA*21. This allele may
be the result of a deleterious mutation that arose relatively recently, as the other alleles in this cluster encode
potentially functional alleles (i.e. without stop codons).
It is possible the alleles of this clade are derived from a
paralogous locus which is gradually becoming dysfunctional through an accumulation of deleterious mutations, as would be expected under the ‘birth and death’
model which has been a hypothesized mode of evolution
for MHC gene families [19]. This model suggests that
new genes are created by gene duplication and either
are maintained over long periods of time or become
non-functional through mutations. However, it is alternatively possible that the DQA*21 allele has acquired a
new, unknown function as the frame-shift mutation present in the allele generated a stop codon present at the
very end of the gene, thus only truncating the protein
by four amino acid residues (Additional file 2; Figure 2).
In addition, Eqbu-DQA*18 was found to be highly divergent from the other DQA alleles in Equidae and could
also potentially be an allele derived from a DQA
homologue.
Unique DRA diversity in Equidae

Inter-specific analyses of diversity and divergence in
MHC alleles revealed that the DQA is considerably
more polymorphic than the DRA in Equidae, with elevated nonsynonymous substitution rates. This finding is
concordant with previous studies in other vertebrate
species on DQA orthologs (e.g. [83-85]). However, the
nucleotide and functional diversity in the DRA locus
was shown to be unusually high relative to what has
been observed in other taxonomic groups (Table 1),
supporting the results of previous equid MHC studies
[40-42,44]. This observation is particularly compelling
because little to no variation in the DRA locus has been
found in most vertebrate species, for example in humans
[86], dogs [46], cats [48], goats [47] and pigs [45]. Chu
et al. (1994) found that although very low levels of DRA
polymorphisms exist in mice, these molecules remain
involved with peptide binding and suggested that the
DRA is under strong functional constraints, such that

Kamath and Getz BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:128
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/128

any mutations would be deleterious to peptide-presenting function. Similarly, it is possible that the reduced
DRA diversity observed in other taxa may be the result
of multiple selective sweeps occurring independently
across vertebrate lineages. Alternatively, but not exclusive of this hypothesis, functional constraints that are
present in other taxa may have become relaxed in
equids. The significance of this unique level of diversity
within the Equidae DRA remains unclear, though we
hypothesize that this locus plays a vital role in response
to a unique suite of pathogens or parasites specific to
the genus. MHC diversity has also been suggested to be
associated with mate recognition and preference (or
inbreeding avoidance) in some species [87,88]. Therefore, further research is necessary to address the potential role sexual selection and parasite-mediated selection
could play in the patterns of diversity at the DRA.

Conclusions
Much of the research on Equidae MHC, to date, has
been conducted using samples from captive or domestic
individuals (e.g. [41,44,89]). Here, focused sampling
from natural populations of plains zebra substantially
increased the number of known MHC alleles, nearly
doubling and tripling that which has previously been
identified in this species at the DRA and DQA, respectively. Wild equid populations are subject to strong
selective pressure by parasites and pathogens (e.g. nematode infections and anthrax in Etosha National Park,
Namibia), and therefore further study on these populations would substantially advance our knowledge of
immune gene evolution and its role in host fitness
under natural conditions. This study also highlights the
need for more extensive sampling from wild vertebrates
in order to capture the full extent of variation at MHC
genes. Elucidating patterns of selective pressure across
functional immune genes can be especially informative
for identifying candidate disease genes and significant
protein residues. However, future research linking these
results to gene function and ecology is necessary to better understand the mechanisms underlying adaptation in
nature.
