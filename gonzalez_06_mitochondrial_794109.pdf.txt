Abstract
Background: It is customary, in population genetics studies, to consider Basques as the direct
descendants of the Paleolithic Europeans. However, until now there has been no irrefutable genetic
proof to support this supposition. Even studies based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), an ideal
molecule for constructing datable maternal genealogies, have failed to achieve this. It could be that
incoming gene flow has replaced the Basque ancient lineages but it could also be that these lineages
have not been detected due to a lack of resolution of the Basque mtDNA genealogies. To assess
this possibility we analyzed here the mtDNA of a large sample of autochthonous Basques using
mtDNA genomic sequencing for those lineages that could not be unequivocally classified by
diagnostic RFLP analysis and control region (HVSI and HVSII) sequencing.
Results: We show that Basques have the most ancestral phylogeny in Europe for the rare
mitochondrial subhaplogroup U8a. Divergence times situate the Basque origin of this lineage in the
Upper Palaeolithic. Most probably, their primitive founders came from West Asia. The lack of U8a
lineages in Africa points to an European and not a North African route of entrance.
Phylogeographic analysis suggest that U8a had two expansion periods in Europe, the first, from a
south-western area including the Iberian peninsula and Mediterranean France before 30,000 years
ago, and the second, from Central Europe around 15,000–10,000 years ago.
Conclusion: It has been demonstrated, for the first time, that Basques show the oldest lineages
in Europe for subhaplogroup U8a. Coalescence times for these lineages suggest their presence in
the Basque country since the Upper Paleolithic. The European U8 phylogeography is congruent
with the supposition that Basques could have participated in demographic re-expansions to
repopulate central Europe in the last interglacial periods.

Background
Considering Basques as the direct descendants of Paleolithic Europeans has become a multidisciplinary premise.
However, there is no irrefutable evidence for this supposition. The Basque country has a well represented archaeo-

logical record in Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods [1]
but Archaeology can seldom differentiate an "in situ" cultural evolution from successive waves of new incomers.
Basques speak a non Indo-European language with no
close affinities with any other extant language but, even if

their roots could be found, they would not reach the Paleolithic deepness due to the fast rate of change of languages. Classical population genetic studies, showed the
Basques as one of the major outliers in Europe [2]. Nevertheless, these results can be explained by genetic drift
which implies isolation but not necessarily an old history
for that population. Lack of recombination and the fast
mutation rate made mtDNA the ideal molecule to construct maternal genealogies, which frame in time and
space the evolution and dispersion of human populations. However, until now, mtDNA studies on the Basques
have only confirmed its low genetic diversity in a common Western Europe background [3-5]. It has been proposed, on the basis of their geographic distributions, that
several mitochondrial lineages as V [6,7], and the H1 and
H3 subgroups [4,5,8] are markers of a Paleolithic human
dispersal from southwestern Europe, including the
Basque country, to Northeast Europe. However, diversities for these lineages are not higher in Basques than in
Central Europeans. It could be possible that this lack of
distinctness in Basques is real, in fact, even small levels of
gene flow during enough time might have replaced the
majority of their ancient lineages [9], but it could also be
possible that this uniformity is due to a lack of resolution
of the Basque mtDNA genealogies [10].
To deal with this possibility, we analyzed a sample of 211
unrelated Basques using the hypervariable segment of the
mtDNA control region (HVSI-II) and diagnostic RFLP
analysis, and sequenced the complete mitochondrial
DNA of the rare lineages.

Results and discussion
The analysis of the Basque sample showed three haplotypes (CRS, 16342, and 16278 16311) that by their
mutated positions in the control region had uncertain
subhaplogroup adscription, but that by diagnostic RFLPs
(+12308 Hinf I) belonged to haplogroup U/K. Also, we
found one individual (16146 16189 16342) that belongs
to the scarce U8a subhaplogroup. Complete sequencing
of the four rare U haplotypes and their inclusion in a phylogenetic tree [11] with all published U complete
sequences (data not shown) allowed their correct subhaplogroup affiliation. A more schematic tree (Fig.1) shows
that one of the lineages (Bq24) belongs to subhaplogroup
K1a1 [12], being a back-mutation of the diagnostic position 16224 its main peculiarity. Its most related K1a1
complete sequences are the eleven found by Herrnstadt et
al. [13] and Finn 153 in Finnilä et al. [14]. Applying a
mutation-rate of 1.26 × 10-8 [15] to their average sequence
divergence [16] a radiation upper bound of 12 ± 4 Ky is
obtained for this group. The other three lineages clustered
into the rare subhaplogroup U8a [17]. This subhaplogroup can be RFLP diagnosed as -7055 Alu I. What is outstanding of these sequences is their great genetic diversity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/124

that extends the range of all known U8a European
sequences (Fig.1). This Basque diversity specially contrasts
with the lack of variation in the Finn sequences. Furthermore, the phylogenetic radiation of their U8a lineages
(Fig. 1 and 2) is characteristic of an old population without recent exponential growth [18]. In fact, the most
ancestral sequence (Bq1820) indicates that U8a lineages
could have been in the Basque country since 28 ± 9 Ky,
and that the other Basque lineages, belonging to the U8a1
subgroup (RFLP diagnosed as -3737 Hph I and + 5235
MspA1 I), participated in a more recent European expansion around 13 ± 5 Ky, similar to that estimated for K1a,
and congruent with a re-expansion from an Iberian refuge
when glaciers retreated in Europe proposed for other
mtDNA clades [4,5,7]. Although all the U8a complete
sequences belong to Europeans, the ancestral radiation of
haplogroup U most probably occurred in western Asia
shortly after the out of Africa episode [19], with early
branch expansions to India (U2), Europe (U5) and North
Africa (U6). U8 may be considered another main branch
with a broad geographic range. Its first split separated U8a
from U8b/K around 57 ± 11 Ky. Relatively short in time a
new subdivision gave the sister clades U8b and K [17].
Until now there was only one completely sequenced U8b
subject [20]. The addition of our Jordan 767 sequence to
the tree (Fig. 1) gives a branching point for U8b, defined
by transitions 6546, 6599 and 12771. Two of them, 6546
and 12771, can be MnlI-RFLP-detected. Curiously, the
similar number of substitutions to the coalescence point
of the three U8 branches U8a (5), U8b(5), K(6), suggests
that all of them radiated at a similar age, supporting the
hypothesis that, most probably, global climatic changes
favored human expansions simultaneously at a continental scale [21]. When only RFLPs and/or partial sequence
data are available, U8a haplotypes in general can be identified by the -7055 Alu I RFLP or the 73, 282 HVSII motif,
and the majority of U8a1 derivates in particular by
the16146, 16342 HVSI motif. In turn, U8b can be classified by the 16189, 16234 HVSI motif. From a total of
20,563 sequences studied 10,677 could be, unequivocally, U8a analyzed (see Additional file 1) and referenced
(see Additional file 2). For the remaining (9,886), in general, only their U8a1 assignation was possible. Analysis of
19,133 Eurasian, and 1,430 North African published and
unpublished RFLP/HVSI/HVSII sequences showed a scattered but widespread U8a/1 distribution that is restricted
to Europe. Its frequency (See Additional file 1 for the
European distribution of subhaplogroup U8a, and Additional file 2 for references) ranges from 0 in the majority
of samples to 8% (although with a 95% coefficient range
around 2.9–21.4) in the region of Var in Southeast France
[22]. In spite of its moderate sample size an important
characteristic of this region is its high U8a polymorphism
as all the three lineages detected are different. The U8a
eastern boundaries seem to be in the Volga region near the

Urals [23]. U8b is also a quantitatively minor clade that
partially overlaps with U8a in Europe. However, its presence in the Caucasus [24], Iran [17], the Near East [25],
and North Africa [26], where U8a has not been detected,
attests a more southern geographic distribution. The third
sister clade K, is the most widespread and abundant covering the U8a and U8b ranges [24] and even reaching
India [27]. A network [28] built with the 48 U8a
sequences found (Fig. 2), could be rooted and resolved
attending to the phylogeny of the U8 complete sequences.
Its most ancestral node is represented by Bq1820 and the
only Anatolian lineage assignable to haplogroup U8a,
both carrying the CRS motif in HVSI, and transitions 73,
282 in HVSII. This ancient connection might trace the
hypothetic route followed by the U8a ancestor from West
Asia to the Basque country. The absence of U8a in NorthAfrica and its extremely rare presence in the eastern Mediterranean area further reinforces this continental route of
entrance against a southern alternative. It is deduced from
the network (Fig. 2) that a first U8a radiation in Europe
affected Iberia, Central Europe and reached the Baltic. A

second, U8a1, broader expansion further enlarged its
range to Russia and Scotland where the U8a diversities are
lower than in the central area (Table 1). As the total rooted
network does not achieve the star genealogy, to calculate
coalescence ages [29], we estimated the average distance
and coalescence age to the U8a1 founder haplotype
(16146 16342) and to the ancestral U8a haplotype (CRS)
independently, representing, in the last case, the U8a1
radiation by only one basic lineage. Time estimations for
the younger U8a1 expansion was 14 ± 5 Ky and 23 ± 14
Ky for the U8a subset that, if added to first, would give a
total time for the U8a coalescence of around 37 ± 14 Ky.
Notice that both HVSI estimations are higher than, but
not significantly different, from those calculated using
complete sequences. To compare the U8a diversity (p ± σ)
among regions, we grouped the European populations in
different Paleolithic areas [24,30]. The greatest diversity
was found in the Iberian Peninsula when Basques are
included, followed by the North Central area (Table 1).
These data agree with the primary and secondary origins
of expansion proposed on phylogenetic grounds, weaken-

other European areas and reinforcing the hypothesis that

which the Basque country was included.

invasion [32]. Furthermore, ancient DNA studies on
Basque historic and prehistoric samples [33] have
detected important mtDNA haplogroup frequency fluctuations along different periods. Definitively, like other
European populations, Basques have also suffered migration and genetic drift effects throughout its long history.

Conclusion
In summary, the analysis of U8a lineages supports the
idea that Basques have lived in their country since the
Paleolithic, and that they could have participated in
demographic re-expansions to repopulate central Europe
in the last interglacial periods. Furthermore, these primitive U8a founders most probably reached the Basque area
from the East through Europe and not through North
Africa. However, the fact that we can trace some Basque
lineages back to the Paleolithic does not support the generalized supposition that the present day Basque population is the best representative of Paleolithic Europeans.
First of all, U8a haplotypes only represent 1% of the
present day Basque maternal pool, therefore, a complex
set of different mtDNA lineages with possible different
histories are left unstudied. In addition, there is empiric
evidence that Basques have received recent male gene flow
from adjacent areas [31], and even possible maternal
North African influences predating the Muslim Iberian

Samples
DNA isolated from bucal swabs or blood samples from
211 autochthonous, unrelated Basques from the Iberian
provinces were analyzed. Appropriate informed consent
to anonymously use their data was obtained from all the
individuals sampled.
HVSI-II and RFLPs
Total DNA was PCR amplified as in Pinto et al [34], and
directly sequenced for both complementary strands as

HVSI-II of the mtDNA control region, from position
15997 to 00408 [36] was determined and sorted into
defined haplogroups [24]. To confirm this HVS-based
haplogroup classification, all individuals assigned to a
specific haplogroup were additionally tested by restriction

HVSI/HVSII sequences were analyzed.

Complete mtDNA sequences
Four Basques (three U8a, one K1) and one Jordan (U8b)
rare lineages belonging to the U/K haplogroup were fully
sequenced. The complete mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNA)
were amplified by PCR using primer pairs already
described [19]. Amplified products were sequenced for
both complementary strands with the Big Dye Terminator
Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing
reactions were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3100
DNA analyzer.

The average sequence divergence [16] for complete
sequences was converted in time applying a mutation rate
of 1.26 × 10-8 [15].

Genetic analyses
Genetic diversity (p ± σ) was estimated as the average
number of nucleotide differences between two sequences
[37], using the HVSI region in the range from 16070 to
16365 nucleotide positions.

Phylogenetic relationships among complete mtDNA
sequences, and among control region mtDNA sequences,
were established using the reduced median network algorithm [11]. In addition to our five sequences, seven lineages were added: Dutch (Dut86; GenBank: DQ112821)
[[38] and P. Shen, pers. comm], Spanish (Spa, GenBank:
AY882392) and Italian (Ita, GenBank: AY882393) [20], 3
Finns (Fin; GenBank: AY339551, AY339552 and
AY339553) [14] and British-Australian (BriT7; [T. Obayashi, M. Tanaka, pers. comm.]).
The presence of U8a was tested in published sequences by
the 16146 16342 HVSI motif and/or the 73 282 HVSII
motif, and U8b by the 16189 16234 motif. 19,133 Eura-

Time estimations, based on control region mtDNA, were
calculated as the mean divergence ρ [39] from inferred
ancestral sequence types and converted into time by
assuming that one transition within np 16090–16365
corresponds to 20,180 years [29].
