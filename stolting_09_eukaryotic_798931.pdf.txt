Abstract
Background: Complementary-DNA based amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNAAFLP) is a commonly used tool for assessing the genetic regulation of traits through the correlation
of trait expression with cDNA expression profiles. In spite of the frequent application of this
method, studies on the optimization of the cDNA-AFLP assay design are rare and have typically
been taxonomically restricted. Here, we model cDNA-AFLPs on all 92 eukaryotic species for which
cDNA pools are currently available, using all combinations of eight restriction enzymes standard in
cDNA-AFLP screens.
Results: In silco simulations reveal that cDNA pool coverage is largely determined by the choice
of individual restriction enzymes and that, through the choice of optimal enzyme combinations,
coverage can be increased from <40% to 75% without changing the underlying experimental design.
We find evidence of phylogenetic signal in the coverage data, which is largely mediated by
organismal GC content. There is nonetheless a high degree of consistency in cDNA pool coverage
for particular enzyme combinations, indicating that our recommendations should be applicable to
most eukaryotic systems. We also explore the relationship between the average observed
fragment number per selective AFLP-PCR reaction and the size of the underlying cDNA pool, and
show how AFLP experiments can be used to estimate the number of genes expressed in a target
tissue.
Conclusion: The insights gained from in silico screening of cDNA-AFLPs from a broad sampling of
eukaryotes provide a set of guidelines that should help to substantially increase the efficiency of
future cDNA-AFLP experiments in eukaryotes. In silico simulations also suggest a novel use of
cDNA-AFLP screens to determine the number of transcripts expressed in a target tissue, an
application that should be invaluable as next-generation sequencing technologies are adapted for
differential display.

Background
Researchers interested in studying the genetic regulation
of particular processes or traits must first identify the
genes contributing to the phenotype, a step which can be
particularly challenging in organisms for which genomic
data are not yet available. Differential display methods
have been commonly used to compare levels of gene
expression in target tissues at various stages, allowing the
identification of sets of genes whose expression patterns
are significantly correlated with traits of interest [1].
Among the available differential display methods, one
increasingly popular tool is cDNA-amplified fragment
length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP, [2]). This method
allows the identification of differences in the expression
of genes that are correlated to a trait of interest and has
proven particularly useful in non-model organisms, as it
does not require previous sequence knowledge. The
cDNA-AFLP technique involves the digestion of cDNA
preparations produced from RNA extractions with two
restriction enzymes. To analyze the produced fragments,
adaptors are ligated to each restriction fragment, which
then serve as oligonucleotide-binding sites for two subsequent rounds of PCR. By adding a few (typically <4),
selective base pairs (bp) to these primer sequences, the
amplified fragment pool is reduced in complexity such
that a suitable number of fragments can be visualized
[3,4]. By comparing the presence or absence of individual
fragments in individual cDNA libraries after size separation, one can identify genes correlated to the trait of interest. While the use of traditional gels (agarose, acrylamide,
spreadex, etc.) is required for the recovery of fragments for
further characterization, separation on fluorescent
sequencers allows for high throughput and has become
standard [4].

A well-designed differential display experiment should
aim to sample all transcripts present in a target tissue in
order to avoid biasing downstream analyses. Optimizing
coverage (here defined as the fraction of sequences that
appear at least once as fragments of resolvable size (50500 bp) in an exhaustive cDNA-AFLP screen) is at the
heart of designing a successful experiment. Insufficient
coverage of the cDNA pool can prevent the detection of
genes correlated to the trait of interest, even if gene expression differences underlie trait production. Although complete pool coverage may often not be possible in any
differential display screen, the recent literature indicates
that dozens to hundreds of transcript-derived fragments
(TDF) correlated to traits of interest can be obtained from
the successful application of cDNA-AFLP screens (Table
1). A variety of modified cDNA-AFLP protocols have been
proposed to optimize pool screening [5-7].
The absolute number of TDFs that are screened per selective amplification is determined by several factors. An
increase in the number of selective base pairs will reduce
the number of fragments screened per PCR, and the
choice of appropriate restriction enzymes can also systematically and substantially affect the quality of a screen, due
to functional or evolutionary constraints on the triplets of
amino-acid coding cDNA. The total number of fragments
obtained is also directly linked to the total cDNA pool
size, because the presence of more (different) cDNAs provides more restriction sites, and thus a larger pool is
expected to produce more fragments per PCR. It is intuitively appealing to simply maximize the number of fragments screened per PCR to minimize the workload, and in
fact the first AFLP studies [3] suggested that up to 100
AFLP fragments could be reliably separated. However,
subsequent studies have shown that when the number of

TDFs are the number of transcript-derived fragments produced in each screen, while PC indicates the number of primer combinations tested in
each study. Mean TDF indicates the average numbers of fragments generated per primer combination, while Corr TDF identifies the number of
transcript-derived fragments that were found to be correlated to the trait under investigation. Restriction enzymes (RE) listed in column RE1 are
characterized by recognition sites of 6 bp, while RE2 (here: MseI) is a 4 bp-cutter.

fragments visualized exceeds ~20 per PCR, there is a significant risk of co-migrating fragments that can confound
the reliability of an AFLP screen [8]. The risk of co-migration is further complicated by the fact that sequences of
different lengths may migrate together for a variety of reasons, including physical damage to the DNA molecule,
differences in base pair composition and/or methylation
[9]. For all of these reasons, studies in which the accuracy
of AFLP-scoring is critical need to be particularly sensitive
to the risks of high-throughput analysis.
Complementary DNA-AFLP optimization problems can
be addressed by computational (in silico) analysis. These
in silico approaches are becoming increasingly feasible as
genetic databases increase in taxonomic breadth, analytical tools are developed, and computational resources
increase in power. As AFLP searches are essentially
searches for particular sequence motifs, the implementation of cDNA-AFLP in silico is computationally straightforward. Each of these screened sequence motifs is composed
of the recognition site of the restriction enzyme and three
or fewer selective base pairs, such that analyses are
restricted to searches for up to 43 × 43 = 4096 sequence
motifs for a three-selective base pair experiment involving
two enzymes.
The first quantitative cDNA-AFLP in silico studies
approached this optimization problem in individual taxa,
identifying several factors that can improve experimental
design. Kivioja et al. [[6], Kivioja, unpublished data] suggested that the use of restriction enzymes with 6-bp
restriction sites is likely to be disadvantageous in cDNAAFLP studies due to the fact that such enzymes significantly reduce pool coverage. Again, simply maximizing
the number of fragments screened per selective PCR by
using restriction enzymes that cut frequently is not necessarily optimal, as this increases the risk of obtaining sizehomoplasious fragments (henceforth: collisions) within
each selective amplification [8]. There is thus a tradeoff
between data quantity and quality in cDNA-AFLP experiments. Methods have been proposed which would minimize the number of amplifications required per enzyme
combination [6] when the cDNA pool has been previously characterized, but it is unclear whether these
approaches have more widespread applicability.
These first in silico approaches to the study of cDNA-AFLPs
suffer from two significant limitations. First, these studies
used cDNA data from a small number of (often closely
related) taxa [5-8], an approach that could restrict the
wider applicability of their conclusions, as codon usage is
known to vary widely across taxonomic groups [10]. As
one of the major benefits of AFLPs is their ready applicability to new taxa, this may be a particularly important
issue. A second potential limitation of these earlier studies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/565

stems from the fact that previous in silico analyses of
cDNA-AFLPs used RefSeq sequences from curated
resources, which are typically biased towards larger and
more complete sequences. As this quality of data is rarely
available in real-world datasets, insights gained from simulations based on these data may not be relevant for typical research projects. The effects of the raw data
themselves on the outcome of the in silico optimizations
have not yet been unexplored.
To overcome the limitations of previous in silico studies,
we use a taxonomically diverse eukaryotic dataset to
investigate traditional cDNA-AFLP experiments sensu
Bachem [11]. Briefly, cDNA is digested with two restriction enzymes, from which subsets of fragments are amplified and then separated by electrophoresis. Depending on
the frequency of restriction enzyme cleavage, multiple
fragments may be generated for each cDNA. We maximize
cDNA pool coverage and optimize the number of TDFs
produced per selective PCR using simulated cDNA-AFLPs
on a wide taxonomic sampling of 92 eukaryotic species
representing most major groups (See additional file 1:
"General information for each species" and additional file
2 "Species composition of included taxonomic groups").
Making use of data from two different repositories, we
also investigate whether systematic differences exist
between datasets obtained from different databases. After
quantifying these effects, we test all 28 combinations of
eight commonly used restriction enzymes on all 92 species and assess the relative performance of individual
enzymes on cDNA-AFLP screens. By including information on the taxonomic grouping of each species, we are
able to investigate whether there is significant phylogenetic signal in the data, a finding which could indicate
that different cDNA-AFLP protocols might be necessary
for particular taxonomic groups. This quantitative dataset
is then used to compare and identify optimal enzyme
combinations, both at the species-level and across all
eukaryotes.
The cDNA pool coverages obtained in these global analyses are based on the execution of all possible selective
PCRs, but such extensive screens are often infeasible in the
laboratory. To investigate potential differences in TDF
recovery during selective PCR, we simulate all possible
combinations of selective PCRs for each enzyme combination and species and extract information on the
number of fragments produced per selective PCR. Because
the maximum number of selective amplifications is frequently limited and the selective base pairs used in amplifications are not necessarily independent of each other,
we use graphical representations to identify general patterns in the performance of selective amplifications. As a
comparison, we perform in silico AFLP on simulated DNA

and cDNA datasets to address whether cDNA-AFLP patterning in real data differs from neutral expectations.
Our comprehensive in silico approach provides a realistic
quantitative framework for the design of future cDNAAFLP experiments. In addition to removing the guesswork
from the design of such screens for non-model organisms,
our in silico approach offers a powerful means for identifying general patterns in the transcriptomes of both
model- and non-model species.

Results
Consistent results from curated datasets
NCBI and ENSEMBL databases provided a total of 113 pools
of cDNA for this study. Twenty-one species were present
in both databases, providing an opportunity to investigate
the potential effects of database origin on pool coverage.
While the data from NCBI and ENSEMBL differed significantly in many characteristics (See additional file 3:
"Duplicate species from ENSEMBL and NCBI databases"),
the source of the data did not explain a significant proportion of the variation in cDNA pool coverage after controlling for total pool size, average sequence length, GC
content and the proportion of ambiguous nucleotides
(See additional file 3 and additional file 4: "Influence of
database origin on pool coverage"). Duplicated species
from the NCBI database were therefore removed to avoid
pseudo-replication in subsequent analyses (see Methods).
Sources of variability in cDNA pool coverage
Considerable variability exists in the observed cDNA pool
coverage both within and across species (Table 2; see also
additional files 1 and 3). Two major sources of variability
in coverage can be identified. Sequence characteristics
such as average cDNA length and the total pool size
explain a significant proportion of the variation in the
pool coverage. Of these technical effects, average sequence
length explains 38% of the variation in cDNA pool coverage. Less important is the effect of total pool size (14.3%

of the variation in coverage explained), while the effect of
ambiguous bases on pool coverage is non-significant
(Table 2).
A larger portion of the variation in coverage can be
explained by biological factors (Table 2), of which the
combination of restriction enzymes is most important,
explaining 68.9% of the observed variation in coverage.
The GC content of the target species explains 28.7% of
cDNA pool coverage, and a significant two-way interaction exists between enzyme combination and the GC content of the pool, explaining 55.6% of the variation in
coverage. This significant interaction term indicates that
optimal enzyme combinations differ among species (see
also additional file 1) and suggests that GC content
should be considered when choosing optimal restriction
enzymes for a cDNA-AFLP screen. Taken together, our
mixed model explains 78% of variation in cDNA pool
coverage (Table 2).
The choice of the most appropriate restriction enzymes
substantially increases the coverage of a given cDNA pool
from less than 40% to more than 75% (Table 3). The
effects of restriction enzymes are essentially additive
(compare Table 3 and Table 4), indicating that the performance of individual restriction enzymes is not strongly
influenced by the second enzyme used in the double
digest.
Effects of evolutionary history on cDNA-pool coverage
Analyzing sequence data from a group of organisms with
an evolutionary history as old and diverse as that of
eukaryotes allows the quantification of the effects of taxonomic substructure on cDNA pool coverage. 68 of the 92
study species could be assigned to eight major taxonomic
groups (see also additional file 2) with at least three members per group. This additional predictor (taxonomic
group) improves the fit of our model by 16.1% (Table 5).
Taxonomic grouping itself explains 62.2% of the variation

Variance partitioning addressing the influence of enzyme combination (28 combinations) and taxonomic grouping on pool coverage for 68 species
(see additional file 2). Species was included as a random factor and cDNA pool coverage was weighted by the number of sequences per species to
account for variation in available sequence data. Denominator degrees of freedom were Kenward-Roger corrected. Partial R-square indicates the
proportion of the variation in cDNA pool coverage which is explained by each factor/interaction [27].

in pool coverage. Once again, the choice of enzyme combination explains the highest proportion of coverage in
this model (79.6%), and the influence of technical effects
is less significant. Of these sequence characteristics, the
average sequence length has again the strongest influence
and explains 54.0% of the variation in cDNA pool coverage, while the total pool size accounts for only 8.2% and
the proportion of ambiguous nucleotides does not significantly affect coverage. There is a strong interaction
between taxonomic group and enzyme combination (p <
0.001) indicating that the optimal enzyme combination
varies across groups (see also additional file 2). This difference is mediated in large part by differences in GC content among the taxa included here (70.7% variation
explained; Table 5).
A positive relationship between cDNA-AFLP fragment
number and pool size
We were interested to see whether a relationship exists
between the average number of fragments produced per
selective PCR and any of the additional information we
collected for each cDNA pool. We found a strong positive
correlation between the average fragment number per
selective PCR and the size of the cDNA pool in base pairs
(Figure 1, Table 3). With an r2 of 0.63 - 0.98, the average
fragment counts generated per PCR provide a reasonable
estimate of the size of the underlying cDNA pool.

cDNA length averaged 1113 ± 489 bp across the pools
included in the present study (see additional file 1), similar to the recently published estimate of 1346 bp derived
from gene predictions in the eukaryotic genome [12].
Using these estimates, it is possible to convert the estimated total pool sizes in base pairs into absolute numbers
of cDNAs. The linear relationship between total cDNA
pool size and average fragment number per selective PCR
can help minimize the possibility of collisions when optimizing cDNA-AFLP experimental design. In case of a

selective PCR regime which employs a two-by-three selective base pair design, the threshold of 20 fragments per
PCR reaction to minimize the chance of collisions will
rarely be reached in tissues with fewer than 15000
sequences, assuming an average cDNA length of 1346 bp.
However, the frequently used two-by-two selective base
pair design will yield more than 20 fragments per selective
PCR in a pool of only 7500 cDNAs and nearly 100 fragments in a pool of 15000 cDNAs (Figure 1), suggesting
that a two-by-two selective base pair design is likely to
introduce a significant source of error via collisions in a
typical cDNA screen [8].
Non-random patterning in cDNA-AFLP arrays
Selective PCRs generally use up to three selective base
pairs, and hence a maximum of 43 × 43 = 4096 different
selective amplifications are theoretically possible when
using two restriction enzymes. According to neutral expectations, each of these selective primer combinations
would be expected to produce on average a similar
number of fragments. We used array plotting to visualize
the relative fragment numbers produced by each potential
selective PCR in the typical three-by-three selective base
pair design and found considerable structure in empirical
data that is not found in simulated cDNA and genomic
DNA pools (Figure 2). Such structure is observable for all
enzyme combinations (e.g. Homo sapiens; Figure 3). As is
apparent from Figure 3, restriction-enzyme specific patterning for individual enzymes is highly conserved even
when enzymes are used in different combinations, suggesting that the difference between the fragment numbers
per selective PCR is largely the result of the individual
restriction enzymes (see above). Particular selective PCRs
fail to generate any products and are thus entirely uninformative in cDNA-AFLP screens. In these cases, one or
both restriction enzymes cut closely together, producing
AFLP products too small to be visualized in the screen (see
Discussion). This restriction-enzyme patterning is consist-

separated in the typical size range of AFLP screens (50-500 bp). Vertical reference lines indicate the total cDNA pool size

strong signal of evolutionary history in the underlying
datasets.

Discussion

advances have been made in technical aspects of the AFLP
methodology, theoretical studies investigating methods
for optimizing the cDNA-AFLP screens remain relatively
rare, and large scale empirical data - as provided here for
eukaryotes - have not yet been used for this purpose [6-8].

Complementary DNA-AFLPs are an increasingly popular
tool to study differential gene expression, particularly in
non-model organisms for which genome data are unavailable (Table 1). The main benefits of the cDNA-AFLP
approach are the relative ease of its implementation and
its low per-marker costs [13]. In addition to the traditional
use of cDNA-AFLPs to identify dominant (i.e. presenceabsence) markers correlating to traits of interest, recent
methods have shown that cDNA-AFLPs can also provide
quantitative data [14]. Regardless of the goals of a cDNAAFLP experiment, a successful screen requires high coverage of the underlying cDNA pool. While significant

Recent years have seen an explosion in cDNA datasets.
ENSEMBL and NCBI are two of the most important repositories for cDNA data, and the taxonomic coverage and
quality of data in these archives will continue to grow with
the development of next-generation sequencing technologies. Given the vast amount of available data - in the
present study a total of more than 1.7 million sequences
and 2.2 Gbp of cDNA were screened - in silico studies offer
the potential to address novel research questions and to
optimize experimental protocols before undertaking large
experimental studies. The cDNA pools included in the

present study cover most major extant eukaryotic groups,
providing an opportunity to identify broadly applicable
conclusions on the most important factors affecting the
quality of cDNA-AFLP screens. These cDNA pools range
from a few hundred to more than 57,000 sequences (see
additional file 1), covering the range of experiments likely
to be undertaken in both model- and non-model organisms.
Using previously published and pre-filtered data has the
potential to introduce technical artifacts into in silico analyses. The database origin of cDNA pools does not affect
our coverage optimization after controlling for differences
in sequence length, total pool size, GC content and the
proportion of ambiguous nucleotides (see additional file
4: "Influence of database origin on pool coverage"). When
comparing data derived from different databases, nonACGT content was found to explain a significant component of pool coverage (see additional file 4). This result is
due to an abnormally high proportion of ambiguous
nucleotides in the Gasterosteus aculateus cDNA pool
obtained from the NCBI repository (1.26%, versus 6 × 106% in the ENSEMBL dataset; see also additional file 3). This
effect of non-ACGT nucleotides on coverage disappears
when this species is removed from the analysis (data not
shown).
cDNA pool coverage in the complete dataset of 92 species
(see additional file 1) is significantly affected by both total
pool size and average sequence length, which explain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/565

14% and 38% percent of coverage, respectively (Table 2).
Because the cDNA-AFLP method requires the presence of
at least two restriction sites in proximity to screen each
transcript, cDNA sequence length can have a large effect,
and a significant reduction in coverage is expected when
using short cDNA sequences. While the quality of the
cDNA preparation can influence cDNA length, differences
in cDNA length between species may also reflect biological reality. Species included in our study differ substantially in average cDNA sequence length (see additional file
1). This difference is most pronounced between plants
(coniferopsids, liliopsids and streptophytes), which have
an average cDNA length of approximately 800 bp, and
mammals, which have an average cDNA sequence length
of 1600 bp (see additional file 2). This difference, though
more modest, is also evident in the results of recent fulllength cDNA sequencing projects. An average cDNA
length of ~1.5 kb has been reported in plants [e.g. [1518]], whereas mammals have on average longer full
length cDNAs of ~1.7 kb [e.g. [19-23]]. While these studies indicate cDNA length may vary among taxonomic
groups, the biological implications and evolutionary consequences of this variation remain unclear.
Technical issues have an important effect on the outcome
of cDNA-AFLP experiments, but the restriction enzymes
employed explain the majority of the variation in pool
coverage (Table 2, Table 5). Here, three factors are relevant. First, the use of restriction enzymes with 6-bp recognition sites is not recommended for cDNA pools [[6],
Kivioja, unpublished data], as it greatly reduces the
number of fragments generated per PCR reaction. Second,
among the restriction enzymes tested here, some are far
better suited for cDNA-AFLPs than are others. Estimates of
the effects of individual enzymes on coverage (Table 4) or
their combined effect (Table 3) clearly indicate that the
efficiency of the pool coverage can be nearly doubled by
choosing the optimal enzyme combination. Of the restriction enzymes included here, CviAII, MseI and CviQI outperform the other enzymes and are as such good
candidates for cDNA-AFLP screens in eukaryotes (Table 3,
Table 4). Finally, several basic rules should be kept in
mind when choosing restriction enzymes. A strong interaction between optimal restriction enzymes and organismal GC content is apparent in all analyses (see also
additional file 2). Clearly, restriction enzymes with GCrich recognition sites are likely to cut more frequently in
GC rich genomes than in those with reduced GC content.
Similarly, the use of restriction enzymes with recognition
sites frequently found in cDNAs could likewise aid in
obtaining in-depth pool coverage. As most previous studies have used a six-cutter restriction enzyme together with
a four-cutter and have focused on a small number of
primer combinations (Table 1), the number of genes cor-

related to traits of interest has likely been frequently
underestimated.
Complementary DNA-AFLPs have been applied to a wide
range of eukaryotic taxa, and the ease of implementing
this method in new systems is one of its particular
strengths. While previous studies proposed suitable
enzyme combinations for species for which sequence data
are already available [6], the restricted taxonomic focus of
these earlier studies limited the applicability of inferences
across a wider array of organisms. As can be seen from
Table 5, significant effects of taxonomic grouping exist,
and a strong interaction between the taxonomic grouping
and the GC content is apparent (compare Table 2 with
Table 5). While this indicates that the optimal choice of
restriction enzymes differs among taxonomic groups, it
also indicates that a large portion of this difference in
optimal enzyme choice can be explained by organismal
GC content (see additional file 2). By considering GC content prior to undertaking a cDNA-AFLP experiment,
researchers should be able to optimize the quality of their
screens.
Our in silico experiment revealed that cDNA-AFLP performance differs markedly from neutral expectations (Figure 2) and that the observed patterning is highly
consistent across taxa (Figure 4). Clearly, cDNA pool coverage could be even further enhanced through a more
explicit incorporation of the results presented here. By
selecting only the best performing selective base pair com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/565

binations for several independent enzyme pairs, one
should be able to maximize pool coverage in a reasonably-sized cDNA-AFLP experiment. We refer the reader to
additional file 5: "Arrays of all selective PCRs for all species and enzyme combinations", which provides complete cDNA-AFLP arrays for all species investigated here.
Figure 3 indicates that most of this patterning results from
the effects of the individual restriction enzymes. This is
especially apparent for areas of uninformative selective
primer combinations in which particular primer-enzyme
combinations fail to generate any cDNA-AFLP products at
all. This pattern is a result of the AFLP methodology,
where restriction enzymes are used to digest doublestranded DNA and adaptors are ligated directly to the
digested cDNA ends. During selective amplifications, the
selective base pairs of each primer extend directly 3' from
the recognition site. As a consequence, an AFLP screen
using four-cutter enzymes and three selective base pairs is
equivalent to a motif search for DNA stretches of 7-bp
length. When restriction enzymes overlap in one or more
base pairs, this motif may contain multiple restriction
enzyme recognition sites, producing cDNA fragments
shorter than the 50 bp required for visualization. These
classes of selective PCRs will thus not produce any fragments of mixed type. The selective amplification of
HinP1I-generated fragments with the selective base pairs
GCN is one such example (Figure 4). When a given DNA
sequence contains the motif GCGCGCN, HinP1I will
cleave the sequence at two positions (G^CGC^GCN).
Due to this double digest, the use of HinP1I will fail to
generate any AFLP fragments containing the GCGCGCN
motif. Even when this overlap in recognition sites is only
partial, the number of fragments generated by a particular
pair of selective primers can be reduced, which might
explain a portion of the observed patterning. However,
the absence of patterning in the simulated data relative to
Homo sapiens (Figure 2) suggests that technical aspects of
the cDNA-AFLP method are insufficient to explain the
higher level of complexity found in real data. As this structure is remarkably consistent across taxa (Figure 4), factors
highly conserved across evolution (such as codon usage)
must contribute to this pattern.
During AFLP screens, selective PCRs are used to reduce the
complexity of produced fragment pools. The average
number of fragments produced during each selective PCR
is positively correlated with the size of the cDNA pool
(Figure 1, Table 3). For the restriction enzyme combinations investigated here, the average number of fragments
obtained from selective PCRs can be converted into an
estimate of the - typically unknown - size of the underlying cDNA pool. This novel versatility of the AFLP methodology - estimating cDNA pool size - should be particularly
useful for any study in which knowledge of the underlying
transcriptome size is critical. This is especially the case

Page 10 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:565

when performing large scale sequencing of the transcriptome, where a preliminary cDNA-AFLP screen may offer a
cost-effective means to estimate the number of genes
expressed in a tissue of interest.
The linear relationship between average fragment number
and total cDNA pool size can also provide guidance when
deciding on how many selective base pairs to use. From
Figure 1 it is apparent that a two-by-two selective base pair
design will often result in fragment numbers that far
exceed that optimal for reliable fragment separation
(<100 fragments per amplification) or to avoid significant
homoplasy (<20 fragments per PCR). A three-by-three
selective base pair design is, however, too conservative, in
that too few fragments will be screened per PCR reaction
(less than 10 fragments per PCR will be generated for
datasets containing the equivalent of up to 15000 cDNAs
- about 20 Mbp of cDNA sequence). Using a two-by-three
selective base pair design appears to be the best option for
most cDNA screens, producing 10-20 fragments per
amplification (Figure 1; [8]) in cDNA pools of up to
15000 sequences or 20 Mbp, pool sizes expected in vitro
in typical mammalian tissues [24].

Conclusion
Optimizing the quality of cDNA-AFLP screens
Our in silico approach to cDNA-AFLP optimization suggests several key improvements to existing methods of
cDNA-AFLP experiments and highlights restriction
enzymes likely to be particularly well suited for screening
eukaryotes (Table 4, see additional file 1). Matching the
GC content of the restriction enzymes with that of the target cDNA is a relatively simple step to optimize experimental design. Consideration of the restriction enzyme
recognition sites is particularly important, especially
when resources limit the number of selective PCRs that
can be performed. Following these recommendations will
significantly improve the efficiency of future cDNA-AFLP
experiments.
A new application of the cDNA-AFLP methodology
In addition to our methodological suggestions, the comparative approach taken here identified a positive linear
relationship between the average fragment numbers per
selective PCR and the size of the underlying cDNA pool.
This provides a novel method to estimate the number of
transcripts present in a cDNA pool via a simple series of
cDNA-AFLP screens, an application which will be invaluable as next generation sequencing technologies are
adapted for differential display.

Methods
Sampling scheme
An in silico routine for AFLPs [5] was modified here to simulate the AFLP procedure on cDNA datasets. We included

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/565

the 39 eukaryotic species available from the ENSEMBL
repository
http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/
index.html as well as all 87 NCBIftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/
repository/UniGene/ cDNA datasets available as of January 2008, providing a taxonomic sample covering all
available eukaryotic species. We chose these databases
because the frequently used RefSeq databases [6,7] lack
alternative splice variants, incomplete genes and pseudogenes, sources of cDNA variation commonly present in
real world data. As such, our in silico optimization of the
cDNA-AFLP routine is a much more realistic approximation of experimental (in vitro) conditions. As we wish to
help the experimenter in designing experiments for their
own target species, our data are based on whole organism
cDNA equivalents rather than tissue-specific datasets, for
which available data are much more restricted. In the
course of this paper we refer to "cDNAs" as those transcript-derived sequences obtained from the above indicated repositories.
cDNA-AFLP simulations
We simulated cDNA-AFLPs for all 28 combinations of
eight different restriction enzymes for 126 pools of
eukaryotic cDNA (105 species). The eight restriction
enzymes used here are commonly used in AFLP screens
and were used in a previous simulation study [6], allowing direct comparison with this earlier work. Enzyme
details can be found in Table 4. Only restriction enzymes
with 4-bp recognition sites were selected, as 6-bp restriction enzymes have been found to be ill-suited for cDNAAFLP screens [[6], Kivioja, unpublished data]. We also collected information on the number of sequences and the
sum of base pairs for each cDNA dataset and recorded
nucleotide composition to estimate GC content and the
proportion of non-ACGT base pairs (an indication of the
overall quality of a dataset). The coverage of each cDNA
pool was calculated as the percentage of cDNA transcripts
which generated at least one fragment in the standard
cDNA-AFLP size range (50 to 500 bp as commonly used
on fluorescent sequencers) in an exhaustive PCR screen of
all combinations of three selective base pairs. We termed
this fraction "dataset coverage" and used it as our response
variable.

Initial analyses revealed that a small number of cDNA
datasets contained an unusually high proportion of nonACGT nucleotides (>10%, data not shown). These datasets consisted of cDNA predictions based on early drafts of
genome sequences for 13 mammalian species. Owing to
the preliminary nature of these genome projects, many of
the predicted cDNA sequences contained extended
stretches of ambiguous base pairs ("Ns"). As a consequence, these sequences are effectively composed of two
much shorter pieces of unambiguous sequence data.
Because the probability of the presence of a particular

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:565

restriction site is related to the length of a sequence, this
reduction of the effective average sequence length can
strongly influence the predicted cDNA pool coverage. As
the peculiar nature of these poor quality datasets had a
strong influence on preliminary GLMs, these species were
excluded from further analyses. The remaining 113 datasets included here are listed in additional files 1 and 2.
Our simulations returned information for each dataset
and enzyme combination in separate results files. This
information was collated into summary files using EXCEL
macros and a JAVA routine and imported into SAS 9.1.3.
The in silico cDNA-AFLP routine, EXCEL macros, JAVA tool,
and raw data sets are available upon request from the corresponding authors.
Patterning of selective PCRs
Most AFLP studies use two or three selective base pairs in
their selective PCRs. We produced the most inclusive
arrays of selective in silico PCRs by counting fragment
numbers produced for all possible combinations of selective PCRs with three selective base pairs for each dataset
and restriction enzyme combination. Three selective base
pairs for each selective primer allow for a maximum of 43
× 43 different primer combinations for two enzymes, and
thus this most inclusive data array contains 4096 cells.
Arrays for all species tested here are available in additional
file 5. As some AFLP experiments use fewer selective base
pairs, two-by-three and two-by-two selective base pair
arrays were produced from the three-by-three array by
summation. This summation is possible because the fragment numbers produced by amplifications with two
selective base pairs are identical to those produced by all
four selective amplifications obtained with three selective
base pairs (ex: AAN for N = A, C, G, T), given that the first
two selective base pairs are identical to those of the two
base pair selective amplification. The two-by-three selective base pair arrays and the two-by-two selective base pair
arrays contained 1024 and 256 cells, respectively.

We investigated the relative information content of all
4096 selective PCR reactions using graphical representations for a subset of PCR arrays. We also simulated DNA
and cDNA datasets of 10000 sequences of 1290 bp using
the SEQUENCE MANIPULATION SUITE[25]. Random DNA
datasets were generated assuming equal base pair frequencies, while random cDNA datasets were generated using
codon triplets based on the standard eukaryotic genetic
code, starting with a start codon and ending with a stop
codon. We compared these results with in silico cDNAAFLP data derived from Homo sapiens (Figs. 2, 3). The
same procedure was applied to the selective PCR arrays for
six different species (Figure 4) to investigate systematic
differences in cDNA-AFLP patterns across taxonomic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/565

groups. Data were visualized with the SAS/Graph bundle
and the R library "Fields" [26].
Partitioning variation in cDNA-pool coverage
Mixed model analyses (PROC MIXED) were used to study
the relative importance of sequence characteristics and
enzyme combinations in explaining cDNA pool coverage
(an arcsine-square root transformed value unless otherwise indicated). All covariates were standardized by
mean-centering and dividing by two standard deviations
to control for the influence of different scaling factors in
our predictor variables, and analyses were weighted by
total pool size (in bp) to control for potential differences
in variance estimates. We calculated partial R-square coefficients [27], which provide an indication of the strength
of the influence of individual covariates on the response
variable. Due to correlations between explanatory variables, these values do not necessarily sum to 100%. Complementary DNA pool coverage is expected to vary with
the sequence characteristics of the underlying dataset, and
average sequence length, GC content, the proportion of
ambiguous nucleotides (non-ACGT) and total pool size
were thus all included as covariates in our models.

Pools of complementary DNA were obtained from NCBI
and ENSEMBL, two sequence repositories that use different
methods for the organization and curation of their genetic
data. As these differences could introduce an additional
source of variation in our analyses, we investigated the
importance of database origin, using the 21 taxa for which
data were available from both repositories (see additional
file 3). We modeled variation in cDNA pool coverage
according to database origin, enzyme combination and
the interactions of database origin and GC content with
the enzyme combination (see additional file 4) in addition to the main effects of the covariates listed above. As
coverage estimates for all 28 enzyme combinations were
based on the same underlying cDNA pool for each species
in each database, we controlled for species origin by incorporating a species (database) random effect. Because database origin did not explain a significant proportion of the
variation in cDNA pool coverage after controlling for
other covariates (see additional file 4), we removed duplicate species from the NCBI repository from further analyses to eliminate potential biases due to pseudoreplication.
Effects of taxonomic grouping
Testing for the effect of taxonomic grouping (Table 5) was
also possible, as 68 of the 92 available species could be
assigned to eight taxonomic groups with three or more
taxa using the NCBI Taxonomy browser [28]. Similar
mixed models were used to investigate the effects of
enzyme combination (Table 2; see additional file 1) and
taxonomic grouping (Table 5; see additional file 2) on the
cDNA pool coverage. These factors entered either analysis

in addition to the covariates indicated above and the significant two-way interactions between GC content and
enzyme combination/taxonomic group were retained in
the final model. Here, we accounted for the nested nature
of our data by including species as a random factor.

lation of raw data into single analysis files. ABW contributed to the conception of the study and the preparation of
the MS and executed statistical analyses. All authors critically discussed results and conclusions and read and
approved the final version of the manuscript.

Because our mixed models estimate the combined effects
of the two restriction enzymes, we isolated the individual
effects of each restriction enzyme by regressing the
untransformed cDNA pool coverage against individual
restriction enzymes in a separate model (Table 4). Here,
each of the eight restriction enzymes entered the model as
dummy variables explaining variation in the cDNA pool
coverage. In addition to the individual enzymes, we also
included enzyme combination in the model to determine
how much additional variation in coverage could be
explained by enzyme interactions. As such, we were able
to identify the separate effects of individual enzymes and
their interactions on pool coverage. Parameter estimates
from this linear regression are reported in Table 4,
together with information on each restriction enzyme.

Estimating underlying cDNA pool sizes by AFLP fragment
number
Finally, we performed simple linear regression of the average fragment numbers per species and enzyme combination obtained during each selective PCR against the total
size of the cDNA pool to explore whether the average
number of fragments obtained per selective PCR provides
information on the size of the underlying cDNA pool.
This total pool size estimate can be directly transformed
into an estimate of the total number of different cDNAs
present in the studied pool by assuming an average
sequence length of 1300-1400 bp [12]. By performing linear regressions of the average fragment numbers per selective PCR and enzyme combination for the 2 × 2, 2 × 3 and
3 × 3 arrays against the total cDNA pool size, we were able
to determine the optimal number of selective base pairs
for a given total pool size in order to minimize collisions
(20 fragments per PCR, [8]), to optimize separation (50100 fragments [3]) or to maximize the total number of
fragments produced per selective PCR (up to 450 fragments can be scored over a typical AFLP screen of 50 to
500 bp). Figure 1 summarizes our findings and Table 3
reports regression coefficients and equations.

Influence of database origin on pool coverage. The influence of database origin and enzyme choice on cDNA pool coverage for the 21 species
present in both databases. We accounted for variability in coverage resulting from the nesting of species within database and weighted cDNA pool
coverage by the number of sequences per pool to account for variation in
available sequence data. Denominator degrees of freedom were KenwardRoger corrected. Partial R-square indicates the proportion of the variation
in cDNA pool coverage which is explained by each factor/interaction [24].
