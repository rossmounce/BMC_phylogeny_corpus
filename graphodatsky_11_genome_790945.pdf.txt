The genome diversity and karyotype evolution of
mammals
Alexander S Graphodatsky1, Vladimir A Trifonov1* and Roscoe Stanyon2

Abstract
The past decade has witnessed an explosion of genome sequencing and mapping in evolutionary diverse species.
While full genome sequencing of mammals is rapidly progressing, the ability to assemble and align orthologous
whole chromosome regions from more than a few species is still not possible. The intense focus on building of
comparative maps for companion (dog and cat), laboratory (mice and rat) and agricultural (cattle, pig, and horse)
animals has traditionally been used as a means to understand the underlying basis of disease-related or
economically important phenotypes. However, these maps also provide an unprecedented opportunity to use
multispecies analysis as a tool for inferring karyotype evolution. Comparative chromosome painting and related
techniques are now considered to be the most powerful approaches in comparative genome studies. Homologies
can be identified with high accuracy using molecularly defined DNA probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) on chromosomes of different species. Chromosome painting data are now available for members of nearly
all mammalian orders. In most orders, there are species with rates of chromosome evolution that can be
considered as ‘default’ rates. The number of rearrangements that have become fixed in evolutionary history seems
comparatively low, bearing in mind the 180 million years of the mammalian radiation. Comparative chromosome
maps record the history of karyotype changes that have occurred during evolution. The aim of this review is to
provide an overview of these recent advances in our endeavor to decipher the karyotype evolution of mammals
by integrating the published results together with some of our latest unpublished results.

Mammalian Phylogenomics
Modern mammals (Class Mammalia) are divided into
three distinct groups (Figure 1). The subclass Prototheria (monotremes) comprises three species of egg-laying mammals: platypus and two echidna species. The
infraclasses Metatheria (marsupials) and Eutheria (placentals) together form the subclass Theria. Over the last
decade our understanding of the relationships among
eutherian mammals has experienced a virtual revolution.
Molecular phylogenomics, new fossils finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more
than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major
super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla,

Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea)
[1]. This modern phylogenetic tree serves as a useful
scaffold for combining the various parts of a puzzle in
comparative mammalian cytogenetics.
Karyotypes: a global view of the genome

Genes provide instructions to build living organisms and
each gene maps to the same chromosome in every cell.
Linkage is provided by the co-localization of two or
more loci on the same chromosome and the largest
linkage group is an entire chromosome. The entire
chromosome set of a species is known as a karyotype,
which can be thought of as a global map of the nuclear
genome.
A seemingly logical consequence of descent from
common ancestors is that more closely related species
should have more similar chromosomes. However, it is

now widely appreciated that species may have phenetically similar karyotypes because they are genomically
conservative. Therefore in comparative cytogenetics,
phylogenetic relationships should be determined on the
basis of the polarity of chromosome differences (derived
traits).

During this phase of cytogenetics, data on the karyotypes of literally hundreds of mammalian species
(including information on diploid numbers, relative
length and morphology of chromosomes, presence of Bchromosomes) were described (Figure 2). Diploid numbers (2n) were found to vary from 2n = 6-7 in the
Indian muntjac [3] to over 100 in some rodents [4].

Historical development of Comparative Cytogenetics

Mammalian comparative cytogenetics, an indispensable part of phylogenomics, has evolved in a series of
steps from a purely descriptive science to a heuristic
science of the genomic era. Technical advances have
marked the various developmental steps of
cytogenetics.

Chromosome banding

The second step derived from the invention of C-, G-,
R- and other banding techniques and was marked by
the Paris Conference (1971) which lead to a standard
nomenclature to recognize and classify each human
chromosome [5].
G-and R- banding

Classical Phase of Cytogenetics

It can be argued that the first step of the Human Genome Project took place when Tjio and Levan in 1956
finally reported the correct diploid number of humans
as 2n = 46 [2].

The most widely used banding methods are G-banding
(Giemsa-banding) and R-banding (Reverse-banding).
These techniques produce a characteristic pattern of
contrasting dark and light transverse bands on the chromosomes. Banding made it possible to identify

homologous chromosomes and construct chromosomal
nomenclatures for many species. With banding homologous chromosomes, chromosome segments and rearrangements could be identified. The banded karyotypes of
850 mammalian species were summarized in the Atlas
of Mammalian Chromosomes [6]. These basic data present an invaluable resource for the contemporary comparative genomics era, and will assist in selection of new
mammalian species for detailed study.
C-banding and heterochromatin

One important source of karyotype variability in mammals is related to heterochromatin. Once the amount of
heterochomatin is subtracted from total genome content
all mammals have very similar genome sizes.
Species of mammals differ considerably in the heterochromatin content and its location (Figure 3). Heterochromatin is most often detected using C-banding [7]
and early studies using C-banding showed that differences in the fundamental number (i.e., the number of
chromosome arms) could be entirely due to the addition
of heterochromatic chromosome arms. It is well documented that heterochromatin may consists of different
types of repetitive DNA, not all seen with C-banding,
and it can vary greatly between karyotypes of even

Page 3 of 16

closely related species. The differences of heterochromatin amount among congeneric rodent species may reach
33% of nuclear DNA in Dipodomys species [8], 36% in
Peromyscus species [9], 42% in Ammospermophilus [10]
and 60% in Thomomys species where C-value (haploid
DNA content) ranges between 2.1 and 5.6 pg [11,12].
The red viscacha rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) has a
record C-value among mammals - 9.2 pg [13]. Although
tetrapoidy was first proposed to be a reason for its high
genome size and diploid chromosome number, Svartman et al [14] showed that the high genome size was
due to the enormous amplification of heterochromatin.
Although one single copy number gene was found to be
duplicated in the red viscacha rat genome [15], our data
on absence of large genome segment duplications (single
paints of most Octodon degu probes) and repetitive
DNA hybridization evidence rules against tetraploidy.
The study of heterochromatin composition, repeated
DNA amount and its distribution on chromosomes of
octodontids is absolutely necessary to define exactly
what heterochromatin fraction is responsible for the
large genomes of the red viscacha rat.
In comparative cytogenetics, chromosome homology
between species was proposed on the basis of similarities in banding patterns. Closely related species often
had very similar banding pattern and after 40 years of
comparing bands it seems safe to generalize that karyotype divergence in most taxonomic groups follows their
phylogenetic relationship although there are notable
exceptions (see [16] and reviews in [6]).
The conservation of large chromosome segments
makes comparison between species possible and worthwhile. On the whole chromosome banding has been a
reliable indicator of chromosome homology, i.e. that the
chromosome identified on the basis of banding actually
carry the same genes. However, this is not always the
case especially when phylogenetically distant species or
species that have experienced extremely rapid chromosome evolution are compared. Banding after all is still
morphology and is not always a foolproof indicator of
DNA content.

Comparative molecular cytogenetics
The third step occurred when molecular techniques
were incorporated into cytogenetics. These techniques
use DNA probes of diverse sizes to compare chromosomes directly at the DNA level. Therefore homology
was more confidently compared even between phylogenetically distant species or highly rearranged species (gibbons). Using cladistic analysis rearrangements that have
diversified the mammalian karyotype were then more
precisely mapped and placed in a phylogenomic perspective. “Comparative chromosomics” - is a new term
that was used to define the field of cytogenetics dealing

with recent molecular approaches [17], although “chromosomics” was originally introduced to define the
research of chromatin dynamics and morphological
changes in interphase chromosome structures [18].
Chromosome painting or Zoo-FISH was the first techniques to have a wide ranging impact [19-23]. With this
method the homology of chromosome regions between
different species are identified by hybridizing DNA
probes of individual, whole chromosomes of one species
to metaphase chromosomes of another species (Figure
4). Comparative chromosome painting allows a rapid
and efficient comparison of many species and the distribution of homologous regions makes it possible to track
the translocation scenario of chromosomal evolution.
When many species covering different mammalian
orders are compared, the analysis provides information
on trends and rates of chromosomal evolution in different branches.
However, homology is only detected qualitatively, and
resolution (about 4 Mb, according to our data) is limited
by the size of visualized regions, thus the method does
not detect all tiny homologous regions resulted from
multiple rearrangements (as between mouse and
human). Besides, the method fails to report internal
inversions within large segments. Another limitation is
that painting across great phylogenetic distance often
results in a decreased efficiency. Nevertheless, use of
painting probes derived form different species combined
with comparative sequencing projects helps to increase
the resolution of the method. Chromosome painting
sets were made from about 100 vertebrate species
(mostly mammals) and the results are summarized in
table 1.
In addition to sorting, microdissection of chromosomes and chromosome regions was used to obtain
probes for chromosome painting. Impressive results

Page 5 of 16

were obtained when a series of microdissection probes
covering the total human genome was localized on
anthropoid primate chromosomes via multicolor banding (MCB) [24,25]. A limitation of MCB is that it can
only be used within a group of closely related species
("phylogenetic” resolution is too low). Spectral karyotyping (SKY) and MFISH - the ratio labeling and simultaneous hybridization of a complete chromosome set have
similar drawbacks and have had little application outside
of clinical cytogenetics.
All new comparative genomics data including chromosome painting confirmed the high extent of conservation
for mammalian chromosomes [23] (Figures 5, 6). Total
human chromosomes or their arms can efficiently paint
extended chromosome regions in many placentals down
to Afrotheria and Xenarthra. Humans are most commonly used as a reference species in chromosome comparisons. Gene localization data on human
chromosomes can be extrapolated to the homologous
chromosome regions of other species with high reliability. Another surprising feature that facilitates the use of
the human genome in comparative studies is that
humans are a species with a conserved syntenic chromosome organization that is not so distant from the
ancestral condition of all placentals. In Figure 5 we present chromosomal maps of chicken, opossum, and some
species of placentals with homologies to human chromosomes and putative mammalian ancestor
chromosomes.

Post-genomic time and comparative
chromosomics
After the Human Genome Project was completed,
researchers focused on evolutionary comparisons of the
genome structures of different species. The whole genome of any species can be sequenced completely and
repeatedly to obtain a comprehensive, single-nucleotide
map. The method makes it possible to compare genomes for any two species regardless of their taxonomic
distance. Genome assemblies are available for about 93
fungi; 38 protozoa; 13 plants; more than 40 invertebrates; a few fish, reptiles, and birds; and 38 mammalian
species (http://www.genome.gov, http://genome.ucsc.
edu, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
Sequencing efforts provided a host of products that
were put to good use in molecular cytogenetics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA clones
(BAC and YAC clones, cosmids) allowed the construction of chromosome maps at a resolution of several
megabases which could detect relatively small chromosome rearrangements. A resolution of several kilobases
can be achieved on interphase chromatin. A limitation
is that hybridization efficiencies drop off with increasing
phylogenetic distance.

Radiation hybrid (RH) genome mapping is another
efficient approach. This method includes the irradiation
of cells to disrupt the genome into the desired number
of fragments that are subsequently fused with Chinese
hamster cells. The resulting somatic cell hybrids contain

individual fragments of the genome of interest. Then,
90-100 (sometimes, more) clones covering the total genome are selected, and the sequences of interest are localized on the cloned fragments via the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) or direct DNA-DNA hybridization. To

compare the genomes and chromosomes of two species,
RHs should be obtained for both of them.
Sex Chromosome Evolution

In contrast to many other taxa, therian mammals and
birds are characterized by highly conserved systems of
genetic sex determination that lead to special chromosomes, i.e. the sex chromosomes. Although the XX/XY
sex chromosome system is the most common among
eutherian species, it is not universal. In some species Xautosomal translocations result in the appearance of
“additional Y” chromosomes (for example, XX/XY1Y2Y3
systems in Black munjac [26,27]). In other species Yautosomal translocations lead to appearance of additional X chromosomes (for example, in some New
World primates such as howler monkeys). In this
respect rodents again represent a peculiar, derived
group, comprising the record number of species with

non-classical sex chromosomes such as the wood lemming, the collared lemming, the creep vole, the spinous
country rat, the Akodon and the bandicoot rat (reviewed
in [28]). One of the most intriguing and enigmatical
cases represents the genus of mole voles where Ellobius
lutescens has X0/X0 constitution in both sexes (Figure
2) [29], and - E. alaicus, E. talpinus, E. tancrei have XX/
XX system [30].
Novel methods of genome study have revealed some
new interesting data concerning sex chromosome evolution. In monotremes, the most basal mammalian clade,
there are multiple sex chromosomes consisting of blocks
that are autosomal in therians [31-33]. The homologous
region to marsupial and eutherian X chromosomes is
located on a pair of autosomes in both platypus and
echidna [27]. Strikingly there are blocks homologous to
the avian Z chromosome, thus presuming a recent origin of therian X [29] and more ancestral mode of avian

Z-homologous sex determination as presumed in [34].
This theory is in contrast to comparative painting studies in reptiles and recent lizard genome sequencing
project, where most sex chromosomes were found to
have no homology with avian Z chromosomes [35,36].
Unfortunately, most current genome sequencing projects ignore Y and W chromosomes. Only the human
and chimpanzee Y chromosomes have been sequenced
completely [37] and new approaches and studies are
necessary to trace the evolution of this essential element
of the karyotype in various lineages.
Diploid number polymorphism

Most mammalian species are characterized by a particular chromosome number, but sometimes variation of
diploid numbers within a species results from polymorphisms for centric fusions (Robertsonian translocations) involving acrocentric chromosomes. These
“Robertsonian fans”, were found in many species,
including Mus musculus, where all diploid numbers
range from 22 to 40 [38]. Another Robertsonian fan was
revealed in Sorex araneus with 2n varying from 20 to
33. In both these taxa the number of different karyotypes reaches 60 [39-41]. Twenty four different karyotypes were found in Akodon cursor [42] and twenty
were found in Gerbillus nigeriae [43].
B-chromosomes

B-chromosomes or dispensable, supernumerary chromosomes were found in certain mammalian species. The
number of B-chromosomes (Bs) per cell may vary
among different tissues, individuals, and populations.
They do not pair and recombine with any of the standard A-chromosomes at meiosis. The Bs occur in about
1.5% of mammalian species, at least two thirds are
rodents, mostly from the superfamily Muroideae ([44],
our data). Here we give only two spectacular examples
of B-chromosome variation, that were found in the collared lemming Dicrostonyx torquatus, 2N = 40 plus 1 to
42 Bs [45] and in Apodemus peninsulae with 2n = 48
plus 0 to 24 Bs, some of which may be larger than the
largest A chromosomes [44]. Figure 2c presents a karyotype of the Siberian Roe deer Capreolus pygargus with
eight B-chromosomes [46].
Application of comparative painting has shown that in
addition to different heterochromatic blocks [47] B-chromosomes of many mammalian species may contain rather
large duplicated segments from autosomes genes and gene
segments [48-50]. Although transcription and of these
genes has not been demonstrated, this finding has led to a
change in our view of B-chromosomes and suggests a new
role of these elements as harboring genome segment
duplications thus giving raw material for appearance of
new genes and new combinations of genetic material.

Evolutionary new centromeres

Comparative cytogenetic studies have demonstrated that
centromeres are cytogenetic hot spots and that new centromeres occasionally arise. In clinical cytogenetics these
events are called “neocentromeres” and “evolutionary
new centromeres” or “ENC” in comparative cytogenetics. The first human neocentromere was discovered
in 1993 [51]. Later the use of FISH of DNA clones and
chromosome painting revealed multiple ENCs in primates [52-55], perissodactyls [56], rodents [57], marsupials [58] and even birds [59]. ENCs represent a
phenomenon that is almost always detected cytogenetically because the centromere is a black hole to most
genome sequencing methods.
Reconstructing the Ancestral Mammalian Genome

Comparative painting revealed that particular human
chromosomal blocks were often adjacent in a particular
phylogenetic array of species. These chromosome associations, often termed evolutionary signatures or landmarks, make it possible to identify the genomic
characteristics that are thought to have been present in
the common ancestor of the taxons considered. For
instance human chromosome signatures 4/8p, 3/21, 14/
15b, 10p/12a/22a, 16q/19q, 7a/16p, and 12b/22b occur
in the genomes of most Boreoeutheria mammals and
thus were considered to be characteristic for the genome of their common ancestor. Signature 1/19p and 5/
21 are found in all Afrotheria and are considered characteristic for this group [60-62] (Figure 4). Some workers have suggested that the 1/19 signature, also found in
some anteaters (Edentata), was present in the ancestral
placental genome [63]. A variant of the ancestral placental genome is shown in Figure 5[61]. Association HSA1/
19 was also found in marsupials on Monodelphis chromosome 4 according to sequencing data (http://www.
ensembl.org/Monodelphis_domestica), but the associations are not homologous because reciprocal painting
shows that the Afrotheria association is 1p/19p while
that of the marsupial is 1p36/19q13. Other variants do
not include signatures 1/19p and 10p/12a/22, associating
the ancestral placental genome mostly with Boreoeutheria [64,65].
Anaylsis of the genome assemblies of mammalian genomes can serve as a test for hypotheses about the content of the ancestral eutherian genome. We expect that
the structure of the putative ancestral mammalian genome will be further refined due to new information
derived from the genome assemblies of additional mammalian genomes become available. Although purely
bioinformatic approaches with a limited number of species [66] has proved unreliable [65], it is clear that a an
integration of the two approaches holds promise
[67-69].

The homologous nature of syntenic associations
should be confirmed on a high-resolution basis. Convergent events can be established if the syntenic associations originate from segments derived by different
breakpoints. Breakpoints can be established at the cytogenetic level by FISH with cloned DNA such as BACs
or at even higher levels of resolution by sequencing.
However, breakpoints are often located in duplicated
and repeat rich regions of the genome where sequencing
is both costly and time consuming. Further, breakpoint
reuse may be an additional confounding factor [70]. For
example, Robertsonian rearrangements and simple fissions may contribute to homoplasy in cytogenetic
analyses.
In spite of these limitations common syntenic associations are still considered as a useful category for phylogenomics. Data on associations of conserved syntenic
blocks have been accumulated for all orders of mammals, where each block is identified on the basis of its
location on human (HSA) chromosomes. Table 2 lists

syntenic associations in a range of animals based on
homologies with human chromosomes.
It is extremely important to note, that many of ancestral Placentalia chromosomal associations are present
not only in eutherians, but also in marsupials and even
in birds (Figure 5). Genome sequencing studies have
shown that many ancestral blocks can be found in fish,
insects and even in cnidarians [71]. This situation confirms the general rule of high evolutionary genome conservation as first proposed on the basis of chromosome
banding up to current comparisons of genome assemblies (Figures 5, 6).
The most reliable conclusions on the content of
ancestral genomes, the pathways and rates of chromosome evolution are made when data is available for the
widest possible phylogenetic array of species. Different
rates of chromosomal evolution in groups have lead to
errors in interpreting phylogenetic relationships. For
example, although gibbons are closely related to humans
and are included in the Hominoidea, the high number

of chromosome rearrangements in these taxa makes
them phenetically more distant from humans than
human are from some species outside the primate order
such as cats [72-74]. The reasons for high rates of genome reshuffling are far from being clearly understand,
still some authors hypothesize that such factors as population structure and the repetitive fraction of DNA content may increase the rate of karyotype evolution
[75,76].
In the following paragraphs we will concentrate on
particular mammalian orders that were studied by comparative painting which provide particularly informative
examples of karyotype evolution.
Canidae

A great number of species has been examined by chromosome painting in the order Carnivora, which now,
quite naturally, includes pinnipeds (walruses and seals)
as a sister group to mustelids. Human chromosome
probes detected 30-35 homologous regions on the chromosomes of cats, weasels, lesser panda, pinnipeds,
civets, and hyenas; 43-45 regions in the karyotypes of
bears and giant panda; and over 70 regions in the canine
karyotype. Almost all conserved regions that are characteristic for mammalian ancestral genome and, in particular, for carnivores, are disrupted in the canine genome
(Figures 5, 6B) [77].
It should be noted that the high-quality flow sorted
canine chromosome probes [77] proved to be extremely
useful for genome mapping. Due to their evolutionary
fragmented character, these probes allowed the identification of rearrangements (inversions) within the regions
that seem conservative when studied by human chromosome probes (Figure 6B). As a whole, the use of dog
paints has shown that inversions inside of the conservative regions are not frequent. Therefore it is possible
that a proportion of the high number of inversions
found in many species in mammalian Genome Projects
may result from assembly mistakes [78].
Rodentia

Unequal rates of genome evolution have been observed
for different mammalian groups; rodents are most
remarkable in this respect. The mechanisms that triggered such increased rates of genome reshuffling remain
unknown. The order Rodentia comprises more than
40% of all mammalian species. It is the most numerous
and evolutionarily diverse taxon of mammals. About
one-third of rodent species belong to the superfamily
Muroidea (mice, rats, and hamsters). It is muroid
rodents that are the champions in the great evolutionary
competition, to the shame of other mammalian orders.
Comparative reciprocal painting with chromosome
probes of mouse and rat showed that the rate of

Page 12 of 16

chromosome rearrangements differentiating these extremely close species was tenfold higher than between
human and cat, which are rather distant [79]. Yet the
most impressive finding was the structure of the mouse
genome. After human, mouse Mus musculus is the most
thoroughly studied mammal. Early integrative data on
mouse chromosome mapping suggested that there were
a large number of chromosome rearrangements differentiating the mouse and human genomes [80]. Later,
attempts to localize human chromosome probes on
mouse chromosomes were, mostly, unsuccessful: the
size of many regions homologous in the mouse and
human genomes proved lower than the resolution of
chromosome painting, confirming that the mouse genome is much more rearranged than that of most other
taxa [22]. It is remarkable that the mouse genome
includes unusual chromosomes such as chromosome 17,
which appears as a “genome dustbin,” combining fragments of many chromosomes occurring intact even in
other species of the genus Mus (Figure 5H).
It should be noted that the great number of rearrangements found between humans and the mouse also
applies to other Muroidea species, including another
well-studied species, the rat, Rattus norvegicus. Thus, in
terms of comparative chromosomics, Muroidea appear
to have experienced a genomic revolution that sets
them apart from the other placental mammals.
Muroid rodents present a particular challenge, considering the high number of species and high rates of chromosome reshuffling. Various techniques are needed to
sort out their karyotypic relationships. In addition to
flow sorted chromosome paints [81-83], a set of chromosome region specific microdissection derived murine
probes were used [84]. The hybridization of microdissected murine probes provided a multicolor banding
pattern which was particularly useful to identifying new
evolutionary breakpoints, previously unrecognized small
homologous segments, inversions, and evolutionary new
centromeres (discussed above) (Figure 7).
It is important to place on the evolutionary tree the
triggering of a mechanism that allowed a considerable
increase in the rate of chromosome evolution in
rodents. This event took place after Sciuridae (tree
squirrels, chipmunks, marmots, and ground squirrels)
split from the main lineage of Rodentia. Detailed localization of human chromosome probes on chromosomes
of many squirrels and reciprocal painting showed that
the squirrel genomes are highly conserved, are similar to
the human and ancestral genomes, and have several signatures suggesting a common origin for rodents and
lagomorphs [85,86].
The putative karyotype of the rodent ancestor (Figure
5) is close to the karyotype of placentals and is very distant from that of the Muridae ancestor [81,82,87]. It

includes three extant families that have different modes
of chromosome evolution. Tapirs and rhinoceroses were
found to be extremely conserved and had hardly undergone any rearrangements for millions of years. On the
other hand, equids underwent an explosion of karyotype
reshuffling accompanied by rapid species divergence.
Our data obtained from study of almost all extant representatives of the order (excluding only two Asian rhinoceroses) was subjected to PAUP analysis and resulted in
the phylogenetic tree that turned out to be identical to
those obtained with sequence analysis data. The phylogeny of equids was particularly easy to reconstruct and
non-controversial, probably due to relatively recent fixation of multiple rearrangements.

should be noted that this proposal of rodent ancestral
genome organization differs fundamentally from other
proposals based on different methods [66]. Bioinformatics approaches up to now are limited because their
database is restricted to mouse and rat. The result is a
rodent “ancestral genome” intermediate between the
human and mouse genomes, which is totally without
merit. Only a phylogenetically rich and appropriate
array of species may eventually reveal at the bioinformatics level the main regularities of the organization
and evolution of mammals and, in particular, rodents.
Perissodactyla

The odd-toed ungulates are a good example to illustrate
the potential of chromosome painting for the reconstruction of evolutionary events [88]. This order

The most controversial phylogenies are usually obtained
from species, whose divergence occurred long ago and
was accompanied by small number of rearrangements.
Another problem comes from the appearance of parallelisms or homoplasies. Thus many convergent events
were probably characteristic for cetartiodactyls, hampering the reconstruction of non-controversial phylogenetic
trees [89]. Convergence and homoplasy was found to be
frequent in bats. It was difficult to resolve the phylogeny
of the main families in spite of many species involved
[90]. Later scrutiny revealed a single association that
may reflect the closer relationship of bat families Pteropodidae and Rhinolopoidea [91].
Chromosome painting in resolving superordinal clades

Chromosome-derived characters turned out to be very
useful in resolving or supporting some problematic
superordinal clades. An example was the support of
afrotherian clade at the cytogenetic level. The grouping
of Afrotheria was originally based on molecular data
[92][1][93] while paleontological and morphological data
did not support the clade. Importantly, independent
support came from cytogenetics when two synapomorphic associations, 1/19 and 5/21, were found in all
afrotherian species studied [60][62][94]. Within
Afrotheria such clades as Paenungulata (Hyracoidea, Sirenia and Proboscidea) [94,95] and Afroinsectiphillia
(aardvark, golden mole, elephant-shrew) [62] were supported by painting data.
Within the cohort Euarchontoglires (Primates, Dermoptera, Scadentia, Rodentia, Lagomorpha) the superorder Glires (Rodentia+Lagomorpha) was supported by
human syntenic associations 1/10p and 9/11 [85,86] and
the superorder Sundatheria (Dermoptera+Scadentia) by
human association 2q/21 [96].
Although comparative chromosome painting did not
reveal any association uniting all orders of the Laurasiatheria clade (Eulipothypla, Carnivora, Pholidota,

Graphodatsky et al. Molecular Cytogenetics 2011, 4:22
http://www.molecularcytogenetics.org/content/4/1/22

Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Chiroptera), the order
Pinnipedia was placed within Carnivora as sister clade
to Mustelidae [97], Cetacea was nested within Artiodactyla [89] and Perissodactyla and Cetartiodactyla were
found to be sister clades [63][88]. All these findings are
consistent with most modern phylogenies obtained
using molecular data.

Conclusions
The Postgenomic research in mammalian cytogenetics
has confirmed the previously established general tendencies of karyotype evolution, brought new data for finalizing phylogenetic trees and allowed a detail analysis of
genome evolution in various branches. New molecular
approaches led to a precise characterization of breakpoints in evolution and altered our understanding of sex
chromosome and B-chromosome evolution.
Studies of mammalian genome evolution are set to
take a quantum leap as ever more completely sequenced
multiple genomes become available. The previously studied karyotypes characterized from techniques ranging
from classical staining and banding to molecular cytogenetic approaches from chromosome paints to cloned
DNA will serve as basis for high resolution maps construction for hundreds of mammalian and vertebrate
species. A newly proposed Genome 10 K project presumes whole genome sequencing of 10,000 vertebrate
species in the near future (G10KCOS 2009), which will
provide a foundation for the next generation of postgenomic studies.
