Abstract
Background: During the last decades, there has been an acceleration of the loss of domestic animal biodiversity. For
conservation purposes, the genetic diversity of the H'Mong cattle, an indigenous local breed was studied. Singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the SRY gene and mtDNA D-Loop sequence were analysed to clarify the origin of
the breed. The genetic diversity was assessed through genetic data with twenty-five FAO microsatellites, and
morphometric data with five body measurements from 408 animals sampled from eight districts of the Ha Giang
province.
Results: The SRY genes were all of the zebu type. Among the 27 mtDNA haplotypes, 12 haplotypes were of the taurine
type and the remaining 15 of the zebu type. This indicates female taurine introgression in the zebu H'Mong. The
observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.616 to 0.673 and from 0.681 to 0.729 respectively according to
district, with low genetic differentiation (FST = 0.0076). Multivariate analysis on morphometric and genetic data shows a
separation of districts into two groups following a south-west/north-east cline and admixture analysis confirmed the
two clusters, but no differentiation of taurine introgression between clusters was observed. A possible admixture with
the Yellow cattle breed from a neighbouring province was suggested through genetic data and householder
interviews.
Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate the interest of fine-scale sampling for the study of genetic structure of local
breeds. Such a study allows avoiding erroneous conservation policies and on the contrary, proposes measures for
conserving and limiting crossbreeding between the H'Mong and the Yellow cattle breeds.
Background
A total of 990 cattle breeds have been reported throughout the world, and 897 are classified as local or indigenous breeds and 93 as transboundary breeds. Among the
258 breeds reported in Asia, 11% are classified at risk,
51% are not in danger, whereas the status of the remaining breeds (38%) is unknown (Scherf [1]). Asian cattle can
be subdivided into humped and humpless cattle. The
humped zebu breeds are more prevalent in southern
regions of Asia, particularly in India and Pakistan. Humpless taurine cattle are found across most of the Asian continent in the northern regions. Chinese cattle are

subdivided into three groups: the Turano-Mongolian
type above the Yellow river, which is of the taurine type,
the Changzhu type below the Yangtze River which is of
the zebu type, and a third type in the intermediary central
area of Huanghuai which is a hybrid of taurine and zebu
breeds.
In Vietnam, 22 cattle breeds are currently present
including 4 breeds identified as local breeds [2]: the Bo U
Dau Riu in the southeastern area of Hanoï; 2) the Bo Vang
(Yellow cattle) in the western and southern provinces
around Hanoï; 3) the Chau Doc in the Mekong Delta; and
4) the H'mong breed in the northern provinces bordering
China and more specifically in the Ha Giang province.
Little information on breed description has been generated. Almost all Vietnamese breeds have a uniform coat

colour varying to yellow from red froment, except for the
H'mong breed for which black colour is also common.
Also, the shape of the hump has been used in Vietnam as
a criterion for breed differentiation. According to the
"Atlas of Vietnamese Breeds" [2], the Yellow cattle breed
seems to have a "hump like Indian type in opposition to
the Chinese type" and in this breed the hump is also
smaller. The Bo U Dau Riu (U meaning Hump) is named
such because of its specific black and yellow hump. The
H'mong breed, besides being the only breed with a black
coat, has a Chinese cattle type hump which is also less
developed and sloping down in the front.
This breed also has the singularity to be linked with a
specific ethnic group: the H'mong people.
The H'Mong people originate from the Huanghuai area
in China, they first entered Vietnam by the Ha Giang
province and continued their migration south through
Thailand, mixing their cattle breeds with local ones.
No genetic information is known about this breed, but
considering its origin probably in southern China and the
genetic studies on Chinese breeds [3,4], H'Mong cattle is
assumed to be of the taurine-zebu hybrid type. This breed
is raised in a province with a sharp variation in altitude
subdivided into many valleys. As a consequence, travelling from village to village is very difficult and can mainly
only be done by walking. In addition, the H'Mong ethnic
group used to live in regions located 1000 meters above
sea level or higher, which made them semi-isolated and
disrupted the distribution of cattle limiting them to the
two mountainous areas of the province. As agropastoralists, H'Mong householders raise cattle for draught power
in a free-foraging way without any selection or breeding
management. Geographical characteristics and farming
practices may have structured the cattle population.
Assessing its genetic status is all the more important to
design rational breeding strategies for its sustainable
management.
The aims of this study were the following: (1) to confirm the taxonomic hybrid status of this breed using
mtDNA sequences, the SRY gene and microsatellites; (2)
and to analyse the genetic structure of the H'Mong cattle
breed through phenotypes and genotypes in combination
with a fine-scale survey. Management practices were also
studied to ascertain the relevance of the biological
results.

Methods
Sampling procedure

The Ha Giang province is a Vietnamese province bordering China (22°08-23°19'N; 104°33'-105°33'E). We sampled
8 districts among the 11 districts that are represented by
25 communes, leading to a total of 133 villages (Figure 1).
For each of the 407 samples (Additional File 1 &2), both
measurements and genotypes were recorded in a data-

base linking morphometric information to molecular
information.
Householder interviews

Householders were questioned about their knowledge of
the pedigree of each animal and their origin. Eight categories of origin were considered: Farm; Village; Commune; District; District Market; Other district; Outside
the Province; Project (many poverty alleviation projects
have given cattle to householders with no information
about their origin).
Molecular markers

Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples using
the QIAamp Kit from QIAGEN.
Monoparental markers

Genotyping of SNP at position 641 of the SRY gene following Kikkawa et al. [5] was conducted by pyrosequencing (see Addtional File 1). The 145 bulls from Ha Giang
were analysed jointly with the Gascon taurine (3) and
Arab zebu breed (3) from Chad, which were used as controls.
The complete mtDNA D-loop region was amplified
according to Loftus et al. [6] from 123 H'Mong cattle (see
supplementary data). Sequences from GenBank from 23
breeds were used and organised into four groups: the
European taurine, Chinese taurine, Chinese zebu and
Chinese admixed group (Additional File 3). Reference
mitochondrion sequences for Bos taurus (GenBank
accession number AF492351; green ellipse, [7]) and Bos
indicus (GenBank accession number AF492350; red
ellipse, [8]) were included as controls in the analysis. The
cattle mtDNA newly sequenced in this study have been
deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
FJ800840-FJ800962.
Microsatellite markers

Genotypes were done in the laboratory of the National
Institute of Animal Husbandry in Hanoi using the 30
FAO/ISAG microsatellites. However, technical difficulties were encountered for 5 markers leading to only 25
markers being used for analysis. Thirty control samples
from the taurine breed (Gascon and Salers breeds) and
African zebu with the international genotype calibration
from CadBase were used at the same time and in the
same conditions as the Vietnamese samples. This procedure allows standardising Vietnamese genotypes with the
CadBase datasets available at http://www.projects.roslin.ac.uk/cdiv/. From this database, genotypes for 8 markers (BM1818, ETH3, INRA063, HEL1, TGLA227,
TGLA122, BM2113, INRA023) were found to be in common with 7 relevant breeds including Asian taurine
breeds: the Hanwoo Korean, the Chinese Yellow Yanbian
breed and the Japanese Black breeds published by Kim et

al. [9]. The set included 2 Indian breeds first analysed by
Loftus et al. [10] and later completed by Ibeagha-Awemu
et al. [11] who also published the German Simmental
included in the dataset. The information about the origin
of the Holstein used was not available (Table 1, Additional File 1). Genotypes of the H'mong breed are available upon request.
Morphological data

All animals genotyped were adults. Five measurements
were taken for each animal: thorax depth, height at withers (HW), body length (BL), heart girth (HG) and ear
length (EL). These measures were combined into 4
indexes: the index of slenderness IGs according to Lauvergne & Souvenir Zafindrajaona [12], the body length
index IBL = BL/HW, the heart girth index IHG = HG/HW
and the Ear index IEL = EL/HW.
Statistical analysis
Molecular diversity, within and between populations

mtDNA marker Haplotype and nucleotide diversity and
minimum spanning network were computed using Arlequin 3.1 [13]. We constructed an unrooted neighbor-join-

ing (NJ) tree of all sequences under the Tajima & Nei
model using MEGA 4.1 software [14].
Microsatellite markers The presence of null alleles was
tested using FreeNA [15]: loci with estimated frequencies
of null alleles r = 0.2 were considered to be potentially
problematic for calculations. For the H'Mong population,
districts were considered as sampling units for performing preliminary estimations of genetic polymorphism.
Genetic polymorphism measures were calculated using
GENETIX 4.4 [16]. The GENEPOP software [17] was
used to compute F-statistics [18] and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test [17]. Test significance was corrected
with sequential Bonferroni correction on loci.
The matrix of Reynolds unweighted distances DR [19]
was computed. Regarding the DR distances, a NeighborJoining tree was established with 1000 bootstraps on the
loci. A DR matrix and Neighbor-Joining tree were computed using POPULATION v.1.2.28 (Olivier Langella;
available
at
http://bioinformatics.org/project/
?group_id=84)
We calculated the contributions (ci) of each population,
which could maximise the total diversity at the next generation as proposed by Caballero & Toro [20].

We investigated the genetic structure and individual
assignments using a Bayesian clustering procedure implemented in STRUCTURE [21], with the admixture model
and correlated allele frequency [22] and 15 runs for K = 110, with 106 iterations following a burn-in period of
300,000. The values for the number of clusters (K) were
assessed according to Evanno et al. [23] by the (D.ΔK) criterion. The programme estimates the posterior distribution (q) of each individual's admixture coefficient. The
grid map of the admixture coefficient q was constructed
using MAPINFO®.

Morphometric Analysis

Morphological data were analysed using single trait linear
hierarchical mixed models with the SAS® software (see
Berthouly et al. [24]). A linear discriminant analysis was
used on the whole set of markers and measurements.
Since this set contains a combination of quantitative and
qualitative variables, we used an approach similar to that
of Hill & Smith [25]. This approach is a combination of an
internal correspondence analysis on markers (Cazes et al.
[26]; Laloë et al. [27]) and of a principal component analysis on quantitative measures. This approach allows using

a variable set and comparing the contribution of morphometry and genetics for the differentiation of populations. This approach is based on functions available in the
ade4 package (Chessel et al. [28]; Dray & Dufour [29]) of
the R software (R development core team [30]). For this
analysis, we removed samples from the QBn district
because of the low number of samples (9) compared to
other districts.

Results
Marker analysis
Monoparental markers

From the SRY gene, all the bulls had the T base at the 641
position. This indicates that they all have a Y chromosome of B. indicus origin.
We obtained sequences of 825 bp of the mtDNA Dloop from 123 H'mong cattle, resulting in 27 haplotypes.
A total of 53 polymorphic sites were observed involving
49 transitions and 5 transversions.
Biparental markers

Within the Ha Giang cattle dataset, no loci had r values
higher than 0.2, therefore it was assumed that null alleles
would not significantly bias the genetic estimates. A total
of 195 alleles were detected. The observed heterozygosity
per locus averaged 0.643 and ranged from 0.293 for locus
HEL1 to 0.821 for locus HAUT27 (Additional File 4).
According to the multiloci FST, only 1.16% of the total
genetic variability was explained by subdivision of populations among districts.
Genetic relationships among breeds

For the mtDNA, the mean haplotype diversity was 0.860
± 0.019 and 47.8% of the genetic diversity occurred
between the four breed groups. The HG population
showed the smallest FST distance with the Chinese zebu
group (0.173). The unrooted NJ tree of the 304 sequences
(Figure 2) identified the two clades, taurine and zebu,
with, on average, 40.78 nucleotide differences. The Chinese admixed breeds (Additional File 3) and the HG population fell into both clusters. Among the 123 H'Mong
sequences, 96 sequences corresponding to 15 haplotypes
belonged to the zebu clade while 27 animals belonged to
the taurine clade (Figure 2). These 27 sequences constituted 12 haplotypes and were recognised as the taurine
type.
The NJ tree showed a clear separation between the taurine and zebu breeds (Figure 3) using the 8 microsatellites
in common between breeds from Table 1. The HG population is positioned between the Indian Zebu and European taurine breeds.
The H'Mong cattle population
Within and between district diversity

There were, on average, 3.3 effective alleles per district

averaged over all loci ranged from 0.616 to 0.673 and
from 0.681 to 0.729 respectively. The average FIS in the Ha
Giang province reached 0.092. Except for the QBn district, all district populations had more than two loci in
heterozygote deficiency, and the maximum value of 6 loci
deviated from HWE was reached for the QB district. The
average molecular coancestry fm ranged from 0.214 in the
QB district to 0.285 for the BM district corresponding to
coancestry between full-sibs. According to the Caballero
& Toro [20] procedure, a synthetic population that would
maximise genetic diversity within the Ha Giang population would be composed of 70% of cattle from the QB district, followed by 27% from the YM district and the 3%
remaining coming from the HSP district.

both sexes (134.2 cm; 142.4 cm) whereas the biggest
females were observed in the XM district (144.0 cm) and
males in the YM district (155.0 cm).
The first two axes of the discriminant analysis for the
whole set of variates (25 markers + 5 measures) explained
22.7% and 19.6% of the observed inertia (Figure 4). The
HW and IBL were the body measures with the highest
contributions for discrimination (6.7% and 4.3% respectively). This procedure similar to PCA allows maximising
differentiation between districts using genetic and morphometric data. The first axis coincides with an east/west
cline and separates districts into 2 groups. The first group
with bordering districts HSP and XM are positioned on
the left; and the second one is on the right side with the
eastern districts.

Morphometry and Multivariate analysis among district
populations

Subpopulation structure and gene flow

Mean body traits between districts are summarised in
Additional File 5. There were significant differences
between males and females for all measures except for EL
and IBL. Altitude had an effect on HG and IBL (data not
shown). Pair-wise comparison between districts shows
that only HW was significantly different after Bonferroni
correction (p-value < 0.005). Cattle from the MV district
were significantly smaller than cattle from the three western districts: HSP, XM and QB (p-value < 0.003). The
smallest HG values were observed in the MV district for

The value of the criterion used (D.ΔK) was the highest for
K = 2. This indicates that two sub-populations are the
most likely figures for the cattle population. Communes
were attributed to a preferential cluster with mean probabilities (q) ranging from 0.51 to 0.88 (Additional File 6). A
grid map of individual probabilities of admixture to cluster 1 (q1) is represented in Figure 5. It is therefore possible
to see that the admixture rate with cluster 1 is decreasing
from the west to the east. The HSP and XM district had a
mean admixture with cluster 1 of 0.77 and 0.83 respec-

districts, where two important cattle markets are held,
the percentages of animals bought at district markets
ranged from 3.1% to 64%. In commune 179 from the QBn
district, nearly 67% of cattle were given by a development
project (Additional File 9). This also happened but at a
lower degree in communes 113 and 89 from the BM district. The BM district was also the one with the most
important rate of cattle coming from outside the province
(6.5% - 23.2%).

tively (Additional File 7). For the QBn district, commune
157 was strongly admixed with cluster 1 (0.86) and commune 179 with cluster 2 (0.73). Cluster 1 could be identified as the south-west province. Starting from DV, then
MV and BM, we observed an increasing gradient of
admixture with cluster 2, the maximum being observed
in commune 113 with a mean admixture value of 0.88.
Cluster 2 could be considered as the northeast province.
The comparison of morphometric traits assuming the
two Bayesian genetic clusters shows that cattle from the
southwest cluster (HSP, XM and QB) were about 5 cm
significantly taller than cattle from the northeast cluster
(Additional File 7).
AMOVA analysis using the mtDNA sequence, shows
that only 0.003 of diversity occurred between clusters.
The taurine and zebu haplotypes were found in both clusters (Additional file 8). No significant difference in taurine mtDNA admixture was observed between both
clusters (Chi2 test; p = 0.385).
A total of 814 pedigree-origin interviews were done
and the percentages of answers per category are summarised in Additional File 9. Householders from all but
three communes kept and reproduced animals on their
own farm, without reproduction management, with rates
ranging from 2.2% to 46.7% in Family category.
Exchanges occurred mostly within the commune but also
with bordering communes. Nevertheless, in MV and DV

The H'Mong breed has yellow, red or black coat colour
and a cervico-thoracic or thoracic hump [31]. Thus it
seems to belong to the zebu group, but current zebu-like
(i.e. humped) breeds are often the result of admixture
between B. indicus and B. taurus, such as the Yunnan Yellow cattle or the Nayang Chinese breeds [3] even in the
southeast and east Asian areas [32]. According to Cai et
al. [3], cattle from south China have Y chromosomes of
the zebu type while Lei et al. [32] found both taurine and
zebu mtDNA, within the majority of the sampled breeds,
suggesting maternal introgression of the taurine cattle.
Similar results were obtained for the Ha Giang cattle population. The zebu-taurine introgression was also confirmed by the central position of the H'Mong population
between both taurine and zebu clades in the NJ tree
obtained using microsatellites.
Within the Ha Giang province, both subpopulations
show similar rates of Taurine introgression. These results,
and the pattern of taurine mtDNA distribution, allow us
to assume that the hybridisation process preceded the
genetic structuring into two subpopulations. Migratory
records of the H'mong people and their livestock are in
agreement with our results [33].
Subpopulation structure

Within the H'Mong cattle population of the Ha Giang
province, the multivariate procedure enlightens a southwest/northeast cline confirmed by the Bayesian
approach. This genetic structure might result from two
factors: (1) a geographic isolation with two mountainous
areas. The two mountainous areas in the North (DV, MV,
YM, QB districts) and in the South (XM, HSP districts)
are separated by flatlands where no cattle are raised; (2)
different origins of gene flow (neighbouring provinces,
important cattle markets) are suggested from interview
information. Indeed, 73.5% of the population from the
Bac-Me district had a probability of more than 0.8 to
belong to cluster 2. According to pedigree interviews,
cattle from the three communes of the Bac-Me district
were partly bought in from another province, and more
specifically in the Cao Bang province where there is an
important cattle market. The cattle population from the

Cao Bang province is considered to belong to the Vietnamese Yellow Cattle breed [31], which is of small size
and is mainly used for meat production. This was in
agreement with the observed body measurements showing that Bac-Me cattle are one of the smallest cattle
breeds in the Ha Giang province. Therefore, the Bac-Me
district could be an important area of introgression of the
Yellow cattle breed into the H'Mong cattle population
within the Ha Giang province. In the Meo-Vac and DongVang districts, weekly cattle markets occur. Householders
from these districts are used to buying their herds from
the district market. The Meo-Vac cattle market is considered to be the most important market in the province,
and trucks coming from other provinces can reach it. In
fact, the main road comes from the Cao Bang province.
Therefore, despite a lack of accurate information on the
extent of importation of cattle from Cao Bang in the
Meo-Vac market, our genetic and morphometric results
are in favour of the assumption of admixture between the
H'Mong and Yellow cattle. Thus, market practices have
acted as a melting pot leading to a mean admixture coefficient lower (0.72) than that in the Bac-Me district (0.82).

In the southwestern districts such as Quan-Ba, QuangBinh, Hoan Su Phi and Xin-Man, no large cattle market is
established. Householders preferentially buy animals in
the village or in the commune market. Thus admixture is
lower and districts belong to cluster 1 with a mean probability higher than 0.6. However, 75% of the cattle from
commune 179 belong to cluster 2 and none to cluster 1
with a probability higher than 0.8. Interviews on the origins show that 66.7% of cattle were given by a Development Project which bought them in the northeastern
districts. Such information was in accordance with our
observations of admixture rate.
Management considerations

As pointed out by Taberlet et al. [34], domestic species
could be considered as endangered from a genetic point
of view. It is then important to take measures that promote management of the animal genetic resources. Many
studies have evaluated conservation policies and prioritisation of breeds compared within each other [35-37]. The
purposes and ways of in situ conservation programmes
for farm animals are multi-fold (see, for example, FAO

Berthouly et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/45

[38]) and generally include (1) providing a clear view of
the status of the breed, through census of animals and
survey of farmers, (2) minimising the rate of inbreeding,
through practices such as rotational breeding, and (3)
providing economic conditions for the development of
the breed. If the population size is large enough and if the
amount of within-population genetic variability is not
critical, then, in addition, a weak selection could be practised in order to improve some traits of interest. The
H'Mong cattle seems to be taller than the Yellow cattle
breed, with height values ranging from 104 to 110.5 cm in
males and from 102 to 104 cm in females [39]. The
H'Mong cattle are smaller than the Chau Doc breed (128
cm for males and 104 cm for females) but of the same size
of the Ba Ria and Lai Sin breeds that have been crossbred
with the Red Sindhi breed from India [39]. Also within
the province, HW and IBL contributed in a significant way
to the district population's differentiation. It seems that
householders from the Ha Giang province prefer taller
cattle with compact body size for draught power in the
rocky mountains than householders from less mountainous provinces like Cao Bang. This kind of consideration
about the required morphology of draft cattle was
reported in another tropical country, namely Kenya [40].
Therefore, breeding programmes could focus on increasing the size of the animals, but also need to manage
genetic diversity. Genetic diversity of the H'Mong cattle
population was found to be on the range reported in the
Roslin database. According to Caballero & Toro [20],
coancestry is useful to estimate the contribution of each
population in order to create a pool of sires. Cattle from
the Quan-Ba district should contribute to 70% and the
Yen-Minh cattle population to 27%. By conserving such a
cattle population, one would be able to conserve a "snapshot" of the genetic diversity from the current H'Mong
cattle population. However, if the conservation programme objective is to specifically conserve the original
H'Mong breed, it would be interesting to compare this
local population with cattle populations from bordering
provinces. This would allow to better quantify the gene
flow from the Yellow cattle to the H'Mong cattle and thus
to delineate populations with the lower influence of Yellow cattle genes.

Conclusions
One of the interests of our study was the very fine-scale
spatial analysis across the area where the breed is raised.
Surely it is interesting to study breed relationships. But
studying local breeds requires a different approach than
selected breeds which have very strict selection schemes.
Establishing conservation policies on a local breed without knowing the exact genetic structure may not be very
efficient. With fine-scale sampling, we were able to establish a fine-admixture grid of the Ha Giang province that

will allow carefully selecting sires for the conservation
project. Also, we show the usefulness of combining
householder's interviews for (1) understanding the
genetic patchwork and, (2) identifying which farming
practices influence genetic structure. All this information
linked together will allow establishing more sustainable
management policies.
