Abstract
Whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (genus Begomovirus) are phytopathogens that cause heavy
losses to crops worldwide. Efforts to engineer resistance against these viruses are focused mainly
on silencing of complementary-sense virus genes involved in virus replication. Here we have
targeted a virion-sense gene (AV2) to develop resistance against Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus, a
bipartite begomovirus prevalent throughout the Indian subcontinent. We show that tobacco plants
transformed with an antisense construct targeting this gene are resistant to the virus. Following
challenged with the virus, transgenic plants remained symptomless, although viral DNA could be
detected in some plants by PCR. This is the first report of transgenic resistance against a bipartite
begomovirus obtained by targeting a virion-sense gene. The relatively conserved nature of the gene
suggests that the technology may be useful to develop broad-spectrum resistance which is required
because of the fact that plants are often infected with multiple begomoviruses in the field.

Findings
Introduction
The geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) are a group of
phytopathogenic viruses having circular, single-stranded
(ss) DNA genomes packed within twinned quasi-icosahedral (geminate) particles. These viruses replicate in the
nucleus and are transmitted by insect vectors. Vector specificity for transmission is determined by the coat protein
[1]. Geminiviruses have been classified into four genera
based on insect vectors and genome organization [2]. The
whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses are numerous and
form the genus Begomovirus. These viruses have either two
genomic components (DNA A and DNA B) or a single
genomic component equivalent to DNA A. Some geminivirus diseases in the Old World are caused by monopartite
begomoviruses which require a ssDNA satellite, known as

DNA β, to infect and cause symptoms in the hosts from
which they were isolated [3,4]. More than 100 species of
begomoviruses have been completely sequenced and phylogenetic studies have shown that begomoviruses can be
broadly divided into two groups, those originating from
the Old World begomoviruses (Europe, Africa, Asia and
Australia) and those originating from the New World
begomoviruses (the Americas) [5]. However, modern
agriculture and trade is disseminating these viruses to new
locations. All begomoviruses from the New World are
bipartite and lack a virion-sense open reading frame
(ORF) designated AV2. This is involved in the movement
of monopartite viruses but its function for bipartite begomoviruses is not fully understood [6]. Begomoviruses
infecting tomato are the most diverse group and include

monopartite, bipartite as well as monopartite begomoviruses that require DNA β.
Begomoviruses are amongst the most devastating phytopathogenic viruses and cause great yield losses throughout the world, particularly in warmer climates that are
more suitable for their whitefly vector, Bemisia tabaci
Genn. Genetically-engineered resistance has the potential
to control these viruses and at least some success has been
reported [7]. Most of the efforts based on the concept of
"pathogen-derived resistance" have been focused on targeting complementary-sense genes involved in virus replication. However, for begomoviruses, these sequences are
more diverse than virion-sense genes and thus are less
likely to result in a broad-spectrum resistance. Here, we
have targeted a virion-sense gene (AV2), using anti-sense
RNA technology, and show that transgenic plants are
resistant to Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), a
bipartite begomovirus that occurs widely across the
Indian subcontinent in a number of hosts [8].

Transformed and non-transformed plants were inoculated with the cloned components of ToLCNDV by
agroinfiltration, as described previously [11]. Replication
of ToLCNDV inoculated plants was assessed by Southern
hybridization using the radioactively-labelled full-length
clone of ToLCNDV DNA A as a probe. For Southern
hybridization total DNA from transgenic lines as well as
control plants was isolated and quantified by spectrophotometry. Equal amounts of total DNA was resolved in agarose gels, transferred to nylon membrane and probed with
α32PdCTP-labelled probe of ToLCNDV DNA A. A semiquantitative PCR was also done to assess the relative level
of viral DNA for plants in which viral DNA could not be
detected by Southern hybridization. The primers used,
NSPf (5'-GTCCCGGGTATGTCACGTATCCATCA-3') and
NSPr (5'-GTATCGATTTATCCAATGTAATTAAGAAT-3'),
were designed to amplify the DNA B-encoded nuclear
shuttle protein gene and amplify an approximately 550
bp fragment [8].

Results and conclusion
The study
Primers used to amplify the AV2 gene were based on the
published sequence of ToLCNDV DNA A (accession
number U15015) [8]. The primers ASF (5'-AGGGATCCTGGCTATACATTCTGTACAT-3') and ASR (5'-AGTCTAGAATGTGGGATCCATTATTG-3') having BamHI and XbaI
restriction endonuclease recognition sequences (underlined) were used in PCR reactions containing the ToLCNDV DNA A clone as the template. The resulting 339 bp
PCR product was cloned into a plasmid vector and
sequenced. Subsequently, the fragment was directionally
cloned at BamHI and XbaI sites into the expression vector
pFGC5941 [9]. This is a dsRNA (hairpin) vector which in
this case was used to express only the AV2 gene in the antisense orientation. The construct was then transformed
into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by electroporation. The transgene and agroinfiltrated gene constructs were sequenced to confirm the integrity of the
inserts. Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Samsun) was transformed
by the Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disk method [10]. The
putative transgenic plants were selected on ammonium
glufosinate (250 mg/l) and assessed for the presence of
the transgene by PCR-mediated amplification of the transgene as well as the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S
promoter. The number of integration sites of the transgene in plants was determined by genomic Southern
hybridization. For this purpose total DNA isolated from
six transgenic plants was digested with EcoRI (for which
there is only a single recognition sequence within the construct) and Southern blotted to nylon membranes. A
α32PdCTP-labelled probe of ToLCNDV AV2 gene was prepared by the oligo-labelling method and hybridized to the
membranes. All six plants tested showed the presence of
the transgene with one to two copies (Figure 1A).

Ten N. tabacum plants, primary transformants resulting
from independent transformation events, were selected
randomly for further evaluation. All tested plants were
positive for the presence of the transgene as well as the
CaMV 35S promoter. The presence of the transgene had
no apparent adverse effect on the growth of plants, which
were morphologically normal and indistinguishable from
non-transformed plants. 10 T0 transgenic and 5 non-transgenic N. tabacum plants were agroinfiltrated with ToLCNDV components and maintained in an insect-proof
glasshouse. All 5 non-transgenic plants developed symptoms typical of ToLCNDV, consisting of leaf curling and
stunting, within three weeks of inoculation (Fig 1B, left
panel). In contrast, no such symptoms were observed on
the antisense AV2 transgenic plants (Figure 1B, right
panel). Southern blot hybridisation of nucleic acids
extracted from systemic (non-inoculated) leaves 25 days
after agroinfiltration showed the presence of viral DNA in
all 5 non-transgenic plants but not in transgenic plants
(Fig 1C).
We further examined the inoculated transgenic plants for
the presence of virus by PCR using primers designed to
target DNA B (outside the region of the transgene) and
serial dilutions of the template DNA (Ten fold dilutions).
These analyses detected the presence of virus in four of the
ten transgenic plants, but only at low dilutions (high DNA
concentrations); whereas in non-transgenic infected
plants viral DNA was detected at all dilutions (Figure 1D).
These results confirm that antisense AV2 transgenic plants
were able to efficiently prevent virus replication and/or
movement; with resistance approaching immunity in 6
out of 10 plants.

Transformed N. tabacum plants contain the transgene and are resistant to ToLCNDV
Transformed N. tabacum plants contain the transgene and are resistant to ToLCNDV. (Figure1 A) Southern
hybridisation of EcoRI restricted DNA extracted from six primary transformed plants probed for AV2 sequences. Either 1 or
2 hybridising bands were detected in 5 of the 6 samples. (Figure1 B) Control N. tabacum plants inoculated with cloned ToLCNDV developed symptoms typical of ToLCNDV (left panel). Plants expressing the antisense-AV2 construct remained symptomless (right panel). Photographs were taken 3 weeks post-inoculation. (Figure1 C) Southern hybridisation of DNA
extracted from control (lanes 1–6) and antisense-AV2 transformed (lanes 7–16) N. tabacum plants inoculated with cloned ToLCNDV. The blot was probed for the presence of the DNA A component of the virus. (Figure1 D) Serial dilutions of DNA
extracted from three antisense-AV2 transformed plants (Lanes 1–12) and controls (Lanes 15–18) were tested for the presence
of ToLCNDV by PCR. Dilution is made ten folds. In two transgenic lines the presence of ToLCNDV was detected only at
higher template DNA concentrations.

The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of
obtaining resistance to ToLCNDV by silencing the virionsense AV2 gene. ToLCNDV encodes two genes in the virion-sense, of which only AV2 is essential for the movement of the virus in plants [12]. A recent report has
similarly shown that AV2 of Indian cassava mosaic virus
(ICMV), another bipartite begomovirus from the Indian
subcontinent, is involved in virus spread to neighbouring
cells [6], whereas the V2 (a homolog of AV2) of a mon-

opartite begomovirus is involved in overcoming host
defences mediated by post-transcriptional gene silencing
as well as in movement [13,14].
The AV2 sequence is well conserved among begomoviruses from the Old World [12]. This suggests that silencing
of AV2 may be a useful strategy for developing broadspectrum resistance, a highly desirable character in the
case of begomoviruses where numerous distinct virus spe-

cies/strains may cause disease in a particular crop. Our
current studies are investigating the spectrum of resistance
provided by the antisense construct of ToLCNDV AV2.
