Background
The ability of species to adapt to different environments
resides in their genetic diversity. This diversity, most
commonly manifested as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), can provide clues to the adaptive processes
and population histories that have played a role in the
species’ evolution. A number of different techniques for
identifying SNPs have been developed, all having their
limitations.
Reverse genetics approaches rely on the detection of
sequence alterations in target genes to identify allelic
variations in natural or mutant populations. Ecotilling, a
variant of TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions
IN Genomes) technique, allows high-throughput analyses of natural genetic diversity in plants [1], particularly in species with limited genetic diversity.
Jatropha curcas L. is a perennial, monoecious shrub of
the Euphorbiaceae family, native to America but distributed widely in the tropical and subtropical areas [2].
Wild or semi-cultivated types of J. curcas can grow well
under unfavourable climatic and soil conditions [3]. J.
curcas has attracted a great deal of attention worldwide,
regarding its potential as a new energy plant. The seeds
of J. curcas contain 30-45% oil [4] with a high percentage of monounsaturated oleic and polyunsaturated
linoleic acid [5]. For genomic analyses, J. curcas is an
interesting model species, since it has a relatively small
genome (2C DNA content of 0.850 ± 0.006 pg or C
DNA content of 0.416 × 109 bp) [6].
However, to achieve specific breeding goals in Jatropha for wider ecological adaptation, disease resistance
and novel seed quality, the use of germplasm from different group and regions is necessary. Understanding

the population structure of the alternative bioenergy
plant Jatropha curcas is challenging due to limited
genetic variability and information on phylogenetic relationships between accessions and related species. The
development of cultivars of Jatropha curcas by conventional breeding will profit largely from biotechnological
support (pathogen-free accessions with specific traits,
non-toxic, high yielding varieties).
The knowledge about J. curcas remains limited and little genomic research has been done so far [7]. In fact,
the genetic map of J. curcas is not well-developed and
only few molecular markers exist that could be used to
clearly distinguish world wide accessions. Therefore, a
resource database of SNPs in J. curcas would provide
researchers with a tool for answering questions concerning population structure or adaptation and allow comparison of this species with related species.

Methods
The identification of novel SNPs that account for natural
variation was used to study genetic diversity and the relationships between and within Jatropha species. ISSRs
(Inter Simple Sequence Repeats) also were considered as
a tool in selecting germplasm for breeding purposes.
An in vitro germplasm collection of 1300 accessions
from 12 countries was established. This collection will
serve different purposes: a) conserve valuable genetic
resources, b) survey genetic variation, and c) serve as
starting material for genetic improvement with different
breeding goals.
Ecotilling was applied to 12 different genes of interest
related to stress tolerance, toxin and oil metabolism. 50
ISSR primers were used to assess the genetic diversity of
Jatropha curcas and related species. Four different pooling strategies were used to identify homozygous and
heterozygous SNP variations. In fact, variation was analyzed both within a single tree (heterozygous) as well as

between individual trees and a reference samples. Due
to the reported low variations between Jatropha accessions [8,9] and large size of our collection, the 8 x 8
pooling strategy was chosen to estimate the level of variations among 12 selected genes.

Results and conclusions
To elucidate genetic relationship among Jatropha accessions from different regions and related species, a dendrogram was produced using NJ analysis of NeiÂ´s
genetic distance for 5 ISSR markers. The dendrogram is
divided into two groups, one containing all Jatropha
accessions and the other containing the related species.
The main Jatropha curcas cluster is divided into two
subclusters, one containing samples from Kenya and the
other containing the remaining Jatropha accessions. The
data showed clear variations not only among individuals
but also between different regions.
Ecotilling was found to be more efficient for largescale studies of genetic variation in Jatropha, compared
to RAPD, SSR and AFLP. Ecotilling is a low cost, highthroughput reverse genetic method for haplotyping and
SNPs discovery.The level of differentiation observed was
based on the geographic distribution pattern, i.e. it was
higher in the centre of origin. ISSR analysis yielded
highly reproducible patterns with 5/50 primers.
