Abstract
Background: Environmental sequence datasets are increasing at an exponential rate; however, the vast majority of
them lack appropriate descriptors like sampling location, time and depth/altitude: generally referred to as metadata or
contextual data. The consistent capture and structured submission of these data is crucial for integrated data analysis
and ecosystems modeling. The application MetaBar has been developed, to support consistent contextual data
acquisition.
Results: MetaBar is a spreadsheet and web-based software tool designed to assist users in the consistent acquisition,
electronic storage, and submission of contextual data associated to their samples. A preconfigured Microsoft® Excel®
spreadsheet is used to initiate structured contextual data storage in the field or laboratory. Each sample is given a
unique identifier and at any stage the sheets can be uploaded to the MetaBar database server. To label samples,
identifiers can be printed as barcodes. An intuitive web interface provides quick access to the contextual data in the
MetaBar database as well as user and project management capabilities. Export functions facilitate contextual and
sequence data submission to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), comprising of
the DNA DataBase of Japan (DDBJ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database (EMBL) and GenBank.
MetaBar requests and stores contextual data in compliance to the Genomic Standards Consortium specifications. The
MetaBar open source code base for local installation is available under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GNU
GPL3).
Conclusion: The MetaBar software supports the typical workflow from data acquisition and field-sampling to
contextual data enriched sequence submission to an INSDC database. The integration with the megx.net marine
Ecological Genomics database and portal facilitates georeferenced data integration and metadata-based comparisons
of sampling sites as well as interactive data visualization. The ample export functionalities and the INSDC submission
support enable exchange of data across disciplines and safeguarding contextual data.
Background
The technological advancement in molecular biology
facilitates investigations of biodiversity and functions on
a temporal and geospatial scale. Improved sampling and
laboratory methods, together with fast and affordable
sequencing technologies [1], provide the framework to
create a network of data points capable to answer basic
ecological questions such as: 'Who is out there?' and
'What are these organisms doing?' To shed light on the
complex interplay, adaptation and survival mechanisms

of organisms in times of global change, contextual data
describing the surrounding environment of sampling
locations are of crucial importance [2]. At the very least,
the latitude and longitude (x, y), the depth/altitude (z) in
relation to sea level, and the sampling date and time (t)
must be provided to allow anchoring molecular sequence
data to their environmental context. If every sequence
entry in the INSDC databases, comprising of DDBJ,
EMBL and GenBank, would be thus georeferenced,
researchers would have the post factum opportunity to
contextualize these sequences with environmental data
[3]. The power of contextual data enriched sequence data
sets for the environmental and medical field has been
recently documented [4-12].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/358

Unfortunately, a survey in the EMBL sequence repository has shown that only a minor set of sequences are
accompanied by a relevant amount of contextual data.
For example, latitude, longitude (INSDC: lat_lon), and
time (INSDC: collection_date), elements of the key contextual data tuple (x,y,z,t), are only reported in 7.3% and
7.2% of all submissions [Guy Cochrane, personal communication, October 2009]. But even if these data are available, correctness is not guaranteed.
The paucity of sequence associated contextual data has
been recognized by the primary database providers and
biocuration efforts are currently underway for specific
subsets. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), for example, curates the Reference Sequence
(RefSeq) database which aims to provide a comprehensive, non-redundant, well-annotated set of sequences,
including genomic DNA, transcripts and proteins http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/. The European Molecular
Biology Laboratory (EMBL) provides the UniProt/SwissProt Knowledgebase which focuses on high quality protein sequence annotations http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/
[13]. However, the common aim of these efforts is to
enhance the quality of the sequence or protein data and
annotations rather than to provide more information on
the data processing or the environment where the sample
or organism has been taken.
To improve the quantity and quality of contextual data
describing the environment of a sample is currently
addressed by several projects which systematically collect
georeferenced sequence data, environmental parameters,
and further curated metadata [14]. SILVA [15] or RDP II
[16] are examples for specialized databases that offer
users curated and quality checked ribosomal RNA
sequences that are often enriched with more reliable contextual and taxonomic information than originally annotated by the sequence submitters.
Furthermore, there are projects which curate the contextual data associated to the primary sequence data to
facilitate specific analysis purposes. For example the
Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) collects metadata
for ongoing and completed genome sequencing projects
[17]. The Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) project, with its integrated collection of tools for researchers, aims to visualize and
analyze data for microbial population structures and distributions. All the contextual data in VAMPS comes from
the MICROBIS database management system of the
International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM:
http://icomm.mbl.edu/microbis/). The megx.net portal
http://www.megx.net[18] systematically integrates environmental parameters and sequence data of marine
microbial genomes and metagenomes using georeferencing as an anchor.

In 2005 the international Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) introduced checklists to promote standardized contextual data acquisition and storage. So far the
Minimum Information about a Genome (Metagenome)
Sequence (MIGS/MIMS) has been published [2] and the
Minimum Information about an Environmental
Sequence (MIENS) is in development http://gensc.org/
gc_wiki/index.php/MIENS. For data exchange, the
Genomic Contextual Data Markup Language (GCDML)
[19] has been developed. A corollary of these ongoing
efforts is the need to support field scientists in the consistent capture, storage and submission of both contextual
and sequence data. Handlebar, a lightweight Laboratory
Information Management System (LIMS) for the management of barcoded samples, in part addresses this issue
by supporting the acquisition and processing of contextual data compliant with GSC standards [20]. The Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) initiative, which aims to
identify and classify all eukaryotic life on Earth [21], also
includes an advanced data acquisition and submission
system. Unfortunately the system only supports phylogenetic markers which serve the eukaryotic domain e.g. the
cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), which is only present in
Eukarya and absent in the other domains of life, and so
far exclude Archaea and Bacteria. Furthermore, it does
not support the printing of database identifiers as barcodes to label collected samples.
Even though initiatives and tools exist to enhance the
quantity and quality of contextual data subsequent to
sequence submission, the amount of contextual data in
the INSDC databases remains an issue. In summary, the
most likely reasons for the persisting scarcity of consistent contextual data are: (1) Contextual data that are
recorded in the field are often not stored electronically in
structured databases. Consequently contextual data get
rapidly unlinked from the sequence data and finally 'forgotten' in the sequence submission process. (2) There is a
lack of automatic quality checking mechanisms active
before data submission. Unfortunately, the flood of data
entering the public databases prevents any manual curation process. (3) The sheer amount of potential contextual data with respect to the different fields of research
ranging from textual data to images or even videos would
rapidly exceed the capacities of the INSDC databases.
Consequently, only a commonly agreed and standardized
subset of data can be stored and made available.
Here the user-centric, web-based tool MetaBar is presented. MetaBar offers all the required features for sample identification and barcode labeling allowing robust
sample tracking and inventorying. MetaBar is focused on
the acquisition of contextual data recorded during sampling in the field 'offline' using spreadsheets. All recorded
contextual data can be subsequently uploaded and consistently stored in an underlying database. The web

Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides advanced user
management and access to data and barcodes. Vitally, the
tool captures GSC standards compliant data and it is integrated into a set of tools to facilitate further data usage
such as integration, visualization and analysis available
from the Marine Ecological Genomics database and portal, megx.net. Finally, MetaBar supports contextual data
enriched sequence submission to the INSDC databases.
The tool is not restricted to any given research field or
domain of life, but can universally be applied to capture
the contextual data of any biological sample. It is
designed to support the complete workflow from the
sampling event up to the sequence submission to an
INSDC database.

Implementation
Programming languages, tools and frameworks

MetaBar is programmed in the object-oriented, platformindependent programming language, Java 1.5 http://
www.java.com/en/. MetaBar is a multiuser web application using Apache Tomcat http://tomcat.apache.org/, the
open source Spring framework http://www.springsource.org/about, jasig CAS http://www.jasig.org/cas,
which is used as a central authentication service to implement the user management, and Apache POI http://
poi.apache.org/ to parse the Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheets used for data input. Any Java objects generated are
stored in a PostgreSQL database using the iBATIS persistence framework http://ibatis.apache.org/. The input
fields in the Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheet are validated
using Visual Basic (VBA) macros. The web interface has
been continuously tested during development using Selenium IDE http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/ and JUnit
http://www.junit.org/. The source code of the MetaBar
application is available under the GNU GPL3 http://
www.megx.net/metabar/data/metabar-1.0.tar.gz and as
additional file 1 to this publication.

Earth® via the KML export function. The data can be
exported prior to sequence submission as a structured

tool
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/index.html.
MetaBar also includes a data export to GCDML [19] for
report creation and data exchange.

Results
The core application can be best explained by describing
the workflow across the different MetaBar components
(Figure 1). First, users log on to the MetaBar web server
(Figure 1, step 1). Upon entry, users can allocate a certain
range of sample identifiers before, during or after a sampling campaign. The identifier consists of a six digit [sample-id] that is incremented with every new sample, a six
digit [project-id] that is incremented with every new
project and a two digit [institute-id] that is fixed and
identifies a certain institute. The combination of these
three parts in one identifier assures the unique identification of each sample. The identifiers can be printed (Figure
1, step 2) as barcodes onto labels (Figure 2) that can be
placed on sample containers and pasted into laboratory
notebooks for consistency. Users can download (Figure 1,
step 3) the acquisition spreadsheet containing the allocated identifiers and the empty contextual data fields in
the first worksheet. As the user fills these fields, VBA validation macros check the inputs and users are prompted
to use, for example, correct formats in the correct numerical range, where applicable. New worksheets can be

MegDB, a PostgreSQL database which is the central database of the megx.net portal [18].
External software components

MetaBar is integrated into a set of external tools directly
accessible from the web interface. The interpolation of
environmental physical and chemical parameters of the
oceans can be initiated via the WOA05 data extractor of
the megx.net portal. On the fly visualization of sampling
sites on a world map can be performed using the Genes

Figure 1 Scheme of the MetaBar workflow. Users are allowed to
create barcodes, print them onto physical labels, and to capture, upload, and update contextual data for the barcodes using Excel® spreadsheets. The contextual data can be exported to various formats and
submitted to the INSDC databases.

added to the spreadsheet. Thus, any additional data outside of the MetaBar model can be added to the same file.
Once the worksheets are filled (Figure 1, step 4) they can
be uploaded (Figure 1, step 5) to the MetaBar web server.
After the upload is finished, the file is parsed and the values in the first worksheet are stored in the respective relational fields of the central database. The additional
worksheets in the file are not lost, but stored as binary
data in the database. The latter three steps can be
repeated whenever it is necessary to edit and update the
data. Users can log in to the system at any time to search
and browse their data via the web GUI (Figure 3).
Additionally, the MetaBar core set of contextual data
fields can be extended for each sample with further GSC
compliant parameters. These additional fields are organized into different types of report and environmental
packages, each containing further parameters. The
parameters can be directly selected and updated via the
web interface (Figure 4).
MetaBar can also be used as an inventory e.g. for
freezer contents. The database may be queried using
sample identifiers by scanning their barcodes with an
appropriate device, by manually entering their corresponding numeric code, or by text search on a metadata
field. The query then retrieves all corresponding contextual data stored in the system.
MetaBar is integrated into a set of external tools with
direct access from the web interface. The interpolation of

physical and chemical parameters such as temperature,
nitrate, phosphate, salinity, silicate, dissolved oxygen,
oxygen saturation, apparent oxygen utilization and chlorophyll of a marine sampling site can be initiated via the
WOA05 data extractor of the megx.net portal. On the fly
visualization of sampling sites on a world map can be performed using the Genes Mapserver http://
www.megx.net/gms. Furthermore, four export functions
(Figure 1, step 6) are currently supported: (1) an export to
KML to visualize sampling sites including their contextual data in Google Earth®, (2) an export to GCDML [19]
for report creation and for data exchange, (3) an export to
a GSC compliant MIGS/MIMS/MIENS spreadsheet, and
(4) an export as a structured comment for sequence data
submission to the INSDC databases using the Sequin tool
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/index.html.
Role, ownership and permission concept

MetaBar's user management provides a "MetaBar admin",
a "project admin" and a "MetaBar user" mode. These
modes depend on the role that is assigned to a certain
user account. The web GUI possesses a cascading menu
on the left which contains the "MetaBar admin features",
the "project admin features", and the "MetaBar user features", respectively. Furthermore, a sophisticated ownership and permission concept offers the users to share
their data with other users in the same project giving
them read or write permissions, or to prevent access for
others. Project admins have the possibility to transfer the
ownership of a set of samples to another user, create projects, assign users to a project and to remove users from a
project. For a given MetaBar installation there is only one
MetaBar admin who can create users, assign or dismiss
project admins and delete samples or whole projects.
A quick reference guide describing the general workflow of MetaBar from the acquisition to the submission of
data is available on the website. Examples for metadata
enriched INSDC database entries, created with MetaBar,
are available through the accession numbers: [GenBank:GU949561 and GenBank:GU949562].

Discussion
MetaBar can be used whenever it is necessary to capture
contextual data that describe the environmental origin of
a sample. The system has been tested in several studies in
close collaboration with biologists taking samples in the
field. By integrating their feedback MetaBar should qualify as user-friendly, scientist-centric software tool.
Case study

The above mentioned studies allow the typical MetaBar
workflow to be generalized as follows. A scientist acting
as the project administrator (PA) plans a sampling campaign together with two members in his research team
(PM1, PM2). The project EXAMPLE is created in
MetaBar and the users PM1 and PM2 are added to
EXAMPLE. It is anticipated that PM1 will collect five
push core samples of sediment while PM2 will collect five
water samples. Thus, PM1 and PM2 create five barcodes
each and download their acquisition spreadsheets. These
barcodes are printed in multiple copies to label sample
containers, appear in field notebooks and for contingency.
During sample collection, PM1 and PM2 log contextual
data such as latitude, longitude, depth and sampling time
next to the barcode labels pasted in their field notebooks.
The sample containers are labeled with the corresponding barcodes and transported back to the laboratory. The
link between sample and environment is thus established.
At the end of the sampling campaign the contextual data
gathered in the field are transferred to PM1 and PM2's
acquisition spreadsheets. Barcodes pasted on the sample,
the field records and present in the spreadsheet ensure
fidelity and the data are then uploaded to the MetaBar
server over the internet. PM1 and PM2 may enter further
contextual data specific to their sampling environments
by selecting the relevant GSC-compliant metadata packages (e.g. "sediment" and "water", respectively) through
the web GUI. The PA and both members of the project
can now review the consolidated contextual data for
errors or missing values. Corrective action at this stage
improves the quality of the data prior to submission.
During laboratory processing, every new subsample is
labeled with a copy of the original sample's barcode, preserving the link to the in situ sampling event. Native laboratory protocols and practices are otherwise unaffected
and are documented in laboratory books. PM1 sequences
the genomes of several sediment sample isolates and PM2
sequences microbial metagenomes from the community
in the water sample. Congruent to the environmental
extensions, GSC packages corresponding to various study
types are available. PM1 and PM2 may use the "MIENS
culture (miens_c)" and "metagenome (me)" packages,
respectively, to record data specific to their study type
(Figure 4). PM1 and PM2 receive their genome and meta-

genome sequences as FASTA files with automatically
generated sequence identifiers in the header. The
researchers enter these identifiers into the "seqID" field in
the acquisition spreadsheet and export the data to a format for submission to INSDC. With this mapping, these
contextual datasets can easily be combined with one or
more FASTA sequences using a suitable submission tool.
The researchers then submit their metadata-enriched
sequences from the EXAMPLE project to an INSDC
database.
MetaBar implements a neat trade-off between universality and specificity. The export functions assure that the
collected data can be publicly stored and shared with the
scientific community.
Comparison of MetaBar and Handlebar

The idea of uniquely identifying samples and storing data
about these samples in databases is not new and is widely
used in many applications and disciplines. However, tools
able to capture the contextual data of environmental samples combined with barcode labeling are rare. To our
knowledge with the exception of MetaBar, the only open
source tool using barcoding to identify georeferenced
samples from the environment is Handlebar [20]. A tabular comparison of the programs' general features can be
found in Table 1.
HandleBar, as a lightweight LIMS, not only covers contextual data that are recorded during sampling, but also
aims to document subsequent sample processing steps in
the laboratory. In this respect, MetaBar is a simplification
focusing only on the capture of contextual data in the
field. MetaBar does not seek to replace well established
laboratory bookkeeping or professional LIM systems, but
rather aims to complement this process to ensure that
contextual data are electronically accessible. Nevertheless, users may choose to use the tool as a storage inventory manager or to store intermediate results of sample
processing because it is possible to store additional data
in the spreadsheets. It is important to note that coupling
contextual data with sequence data before submission to
the INSDC databases is a unique feature of MetaBar.
The barcodes are, by concept, solely used to link environmental samples to contextual and, if available,
sequence and species data derived from a labeled sample,
thus, no hierarchy or processing method is encoded in
the identifiers. Also, sample hierarchies and complex
identifier schemes are avoided. This concept does not
interfere with native laboratory sample tracking methods,
yet ensures consistency in environmental contextual data
capture.
It is important that users have the flexibility to cover
different sample types. MetaBar offers a single template
in which a restricted part is parsed to the database and an
unrestricted part of the spreadsheet can be changed to

contain sample specific additional data. HandleBar offers
a set of non-constrained sample templates depending on
the sample type and also individual templates can be created. In MetaBar each sample can be extended with further parameters organized into types of report and
environmental packages suggested by the GSC.
In contrast to HandleBar, data entered into MetaBar's
acquisition spreadsheet is validated on input, ensuring
correct format before upload to the MetaBar server. This
avoids frequent rejection of the acquisition sheet. In HandleBar the validation is done by the web server and erroneous sheets have to be corrected retrospectively by the
uploading user. The variety of export features are currently unique to MetaBar.
MetaBar is integrated into the megx.net tool set and
connected to MegDB. This offers opportunity to work
with the data and to analyze them alone, or in the context
of other research project data stored in the megx.net
database. This level of integration necessitated a user

authentication and authorization management system
and SSL encryption. Consequently, the local installation
of MetaBar requires modification of the open source
code base. The software and a detailed installation manual are available at http://www.megx.net/metabar. However, accounts on the MetaBar installation hosted at the
MPI for Marine Microbiology in Bremen can easily be
given to interested users and an "anonymous" project
exists where data of external users can be stored anonymously. It is the intention of the Microbial Genomics and
Bioinformatics Group at the MPI-Bremen to support this
tool as open source in the future.
Applicability

MetaBar has been developed at the Max Planck Institute
for Marine Microbiology; however, the tool may be readily applied to a wide range of research fields outside the
marine sciences. Contextual data fields relevant to air,
host associated, human associated, sediment, soil, waste-

Hankeln et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:358
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/358

water sludge or water samples are available via the "add
GSC fields" function. The parameters in each of these
environmental packages have been selected based on
community usage and consensus http://gensc.org/
gc_wiki/index.php/MIENS. For example, fields requesting data on barometric pressure, carbon dioxide, carbon
monoxide, chemical administration, humidity, methane,
organism count, oxygen, oxygenation status of sample,
perturbation, pollutants, respirable particulate matter,
sample salinity, sample storage duration, sample storage
location, sample storage temperature, solar irradiance,
temperature, ventilation rate, ventilation type, volatile
organic compounds, wind direction, and wind speed
would be presented to users using the air environmental
package. Users may easily add new, custom fields as columns using standard Microsoft® Excel® operations. Combined, the GSC extensions and freedom for
customization generalize MetaBar's applicability to any
scenario necessitating the capture of contextual data
describing a sample's environmental origin.

Conclusion
MetaBar offers an integrated contextual data acquisition,
storage, and submission solution to the INSDC system.
The impact of better contextual data availability and correctness in the primary sequence databases will greatly
improve the possibilities to reach a higher level of data
integration and interpretation to address basic ecological
questions. MetaBar's integration into the megx.net tool
set and its export mechanisms offer extended analysis
possibilities via comparison to other scientific studies and
with complementary interpolated environmental data.
The visualization of the sampling sites on the Genes
Mapserver and in Google Earth® offers the users a simple
way to show sampling events on the globe and to relate
them to other publicly available scientific studies.
Statistical analysis of phylogenetic and functional biodiversity in their environmental context will reveal new
insights into the biogeography and habitat adaptation of
organisms. In the medical field, for example, it will be
possible to create detailed disease maps which reveal
mutation patterns of a certain pathogenic organism over
time [5,11]. Such maps might help to predict the dispersal
of epidemics and pandemics around the globe. For
marine microbiology, Ed DeLong and coworkers have
successfully shown that there is a stratification of
genomic variability along the depth continuum in the
water column at a specific sampling location [4]. It has
also been demonstrated that specific diversity patterns
are annually recurring [7]. A dense network of data
points, enriched with contextual data, will lead to new
insights into the complex interplay of organisms by comparing different sampling sites around the globe and over
time. The denser this network of data points, the more

will be revealed about the influence of the biotic factor in
the elementary nutrient cycles that profoundly affect
Earth's climate.
