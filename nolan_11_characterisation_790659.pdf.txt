Characterisation of the legume SERK-NIK gene
superfamily including splice variants: Implications
for development and defence
Kim E Nolan, Sergey Kurdyukov, Ray J Rose*

Abstract
Background: SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) genes are part of the regulation of diverse
signalling events in plants. Current evidence shows SERK proteins function both in developmental and defence
signalling pathways, which occur in response to both peptide and steroid ligands. SERKs are generally present as
small gene families in plants, with five SERK genes in Arabidopsis. Knowledge gained primarily through work on
Arabidopsis SERKs indicates that these proteins probably interact with a wide range of other receptor kinases and
form a fundamental part of many essential signalling pathways. The SERK1 gene of the model legume, Medicago
truncatula functions in somatic and zygotic embryogenesis, and during many phases of plant development,
including nodule and lateral root formation. However, other SERK genes in M. truncatula and other legumes are
largely unidentified and their functions unknown.
Results: To aid the understanding of signalling pathways in M. truncatula, we have identified and annotated the
SERK genes in this species. Using degenerate PCR and database mining, eight more SERK-like genes have been
identified and these have been shown to be expressed. The amplification and sequencing of several different PCR
products from one of these genes is consistent with the presence of splice variants. Four of the eight additional
genes identified are upregulated in cultured leaf tissue grown on embryogenic medium. The sequence information
obtained from M. truncatula was used to identify SERK family genes in the recently sequenced soybean (Glycine
max) genome.
Conclusions: A total of nine SERK or SERK-like genes have been identified in M. truncatula and potentially 17 in
soybean. Five M. truncatula SERK genes arose from duplication events not evident in soybean and Lotus. The
presence of splice variants has not been previously reported in a SERK gene. Upregulation of four newly identified
SERK genes (in addition to the previously described MtSERK1) in embryogenic tissue cultures suggests these genes
also play a role in the process of somatic embryogenesis. The phylogenetic relationship of members of the SERK
gene family to closely related genes, and to development and defence function is discussed.

Background
The plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are a large group
of signalling proteins in plants, and are a fundamental
part of plant signal transduction. In Arabidopsis the
RLK family contains more than 600 members, constituting 60% of kinases, including almost all of the transmembrane kinases [1]. The position of RLKs in the
plasma membrane, with an extracellular receptor

domain and an intracellular kinase domain, makes them
well suited to the task of perceiving a signal external to
the cell and conducting that signal into the cell in order
to elicit a response. In addition to RLKs there are a
number of receptor-like proteins (RLPs). These proteins
contain an extracellular domain similar to a RLK but
lack the intracellular kinase domain [2]. Based on the
criteria of extracellular domain structure and kinase
domain phylogeny, RLKs are divided into subfamilies
[1]. The SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTORLIKE KINASE (SERK) gene family belong to the leucinerich repeat (LRR) subfamily of RLKs. These RLKs

contain varying numbers of LRRs in their extracellular
receptor domain. SERK genes belong to subgroup II
(LRRII) and contain five LRR domains [1].
The family has been defined according to several factors. The first is the presence of 11 exons with conserved splicing boundaries and the tendency for each
exon to encode a specific protein domain. Secondly the
SERK amino acid sequence contains a particular order
of domains from N to C-terminal: Signal peptide (SP),
leucine zipper (ZIP), 5 LRRs, a proline-rich domain
(SPP), transmembrane, kinase and C-terminal domains.
The SPP domain, containing the SPP motif and the Cterminal domain are considered to be the characteristic
domains of SERK proteins [3,4]. Although this is largely
correct for annotated SERK genes there is some divergence from the set criteria. The Arabidopsis NIK (NSP
interacting kinase) genes share many similarities with
SERK genes. NIK genes are so named because of their
function in signalling during virus infection [5,6]. They
are described as interacting with the Nuclear Shuttle
Protein (NSP) domain of the virus.
The first SERK genes identified were linked to competence of cultured cells to form somatic embryos in carrot (Daucus carota), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata)
and Arabidopsis thaliana species [3,7,8]. Since that time
SERK gene expression has been associated with somatic
embryogenesis (SE) and organogenesis in numerous
species [9-19]. In Arabidopsis five SERK genes have
been identified [3] (AtSERKs 1-5) and the gene functioning in SE is AtSERK1 (locus At1g71830). As understanding of the roles of the different members of the
SERK gene family has increased, it has become apparent
that these genes function in diverse signalling pathways
with roles from development to defence. The Arabidopsis SERK gene family is subdivided into two subfamilies,
generated from an ancestral gene duplication event. The
first subfamily consists of AtSERKs 1 and 2 (SERK1/2)
and the second subfamily, AtSERKs 3, 4 and 5 (SERK3/
4/5) [3,20,21].
AtSERK1 is required in conjunction with AtSERK2
for anther development and male gametophyte maturation, with double mutants lacking a tapetal layer and
failing to develop pollen [22,23]. AtSERK1 and
AtSERK3 (also called BRI1-associated kinase1 (BAK1))
function in brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction as
components of the BR receptor complex, through
dimerization with brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1)
kinase [24-26]. Both AtSERK3 and AtSERK4 (also
called BAK1-LIKE 1 (BKK1)) have been linked to programmed cell death, which can function in both developmental and pathogen defence roles [20,27]. What
has emerged from studies of Arabidopsis SERK signalling is that these genes have a tendency to be redundant in pairs with different pairs working in different

Page 2 of 16

pathways. Therefore single SERK gene mutants show
weak or no phenotype as a second SERK gene can
complement their function. Different combinations of
SERK genes act in different pathways and these combinations vary according to the pathway. For instance,
AtSERK1 and 2 can complement each other in anther
development, where AtSERK3 is shown not to function
[21]. However, AtSERK1 and 3 function together in BR
signalling, and AtSERK3 and 4 are redundant in the
programmed cell death pathway. So far a function for
AtSERK5 is not known.
In defence responses, AtSERK3/BAK1 functions in
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity through heterodimerization with the
Flagellin sensing 2 (FLS2) receptor kinase in response to
binding by the bacterial PAMP, flagellin [28,29]. A rice
SERK, OsSERK1, shows activity in both somatic embryogenesis and fungal defence [30]. The concept of a
receptor functioning in both development and pathogen
response pathways is reminiscent of the TOLL receptor
of Drosophila, also an LRR protein, which is a controlling factor in both embryo development and immunity
[28]. Similarly ERECTA in Arabidopsis functions in
inflorescence and fruit development as well as pathogen
resistance [31].
The ability of AtSERKs to be essential to a number of
diverse pathways, receptive to both peptide and steroid
ligands, poses the question as to how these similar proteins can show such diversity of function. One possibility is that they are not the primary ligand-binding
receptor protein, but instead dimerize with other RLK
proteins that are specifically targeted to the one
response pathway; for example, the BRI1 RLK in the
case of BR signalling, or the FLS2 RLK in immune
response to bacterial infection [32]. There is also evidence that AtSERK proteins may function in the process
of endocytosis of the active receptor complex following
ligand binding [28,33,34].
In the model legume M. truncatula we have studied
MtSERK1 in relation to SE and other aspects of development [9,35] but no additional information is available in
legumes on other members of the SERK family. Legume
species comprise some of the world’s essential crops for
both human and animal nutrition, as a source of biofuels and are of ecological importance due to their ability to form symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium
species and fix atmospheric nitrogen [36]. In this study
we have identified members of the SERK family in M.
truncatula and soybean (Glycine max) and analysed
their phylogeny in relation to development and defence.
In the case of MtSERK3 a number of transcripts have
been identified by PCR, consistent with the presence of
splice variants, and this is discussed in relation to
MtSERK3 function.

Results
SERK genes identified in M. truncatula

Using degenerate PCR from various tissues and database
mining we identified eight putative SERK genes in M.
truncatula, in addition to the already characterized
MtSERK1 (Table 1). Degenerate PCR did not detect any
SERK-like sequences that were not also found using
database searches. Based on our analysis these genes
were named MtSERK 2-6 and MtSERK-like 1-3
(MtSERKL 1-3). Five of the genes had one or two corresponding tentative consensus (TC) or EST sequences on
the DFCI Medicago gene index (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=medicago;
shown in Table 1) but none of these represented full
length coding sequences. The remaining three genes

(MtSERK3, MtSERK4 and MtSERK6) matched genomic
DNA sequences but had no corresponding ESTs. Of the
eight predicted genes, five (MtSERKs 2-6) occur in tandem over a 33 Kb region on chromosome 2 (genomic
sequence from GenBank accession numbers AC195567
and AC187356). The other three occur on chromosomes
3, 5 and 8 (genomic sequences from GenBank accession
numbers CT967306, CT025841 and AC126784 repectively; Table 1). PCR amplification of cDNA from various tissues and sequencing were used to obtain the full
length coding sequence of each of the eight identified
genes. For one of these genes, seven different cDNA
sequences were amplified using nested PCR and
sequenced. The presence of these different sequences is
consistent with the presence of splice variants. Blastp

Summary of SERK and SERKL genes in M. truncatula including splice variants (SV1-7) of MtSERK3. Gene name refers to the final name given to each gene. The
genomic identifier is the GenBank number of the genomic sequence containing each gene. Chr is chromosome number. TC/EST identified refers to any matching
TC or EST sequence found on the DFCI Medicago gene index at the time the eight new genes were first identified. These numbers have since been updated and
sometimes divided into separate sequences. Current TC number shows the current corresponding TC numbers for each sequence. No. of ESTs on DFCI is the
number of ESTs used to compile each TC sequence on the DFCI Medicago gene index. Detected on degenerate PCR indicates which sequences we found using
that technique. Matching probeset ID on MtGI indicates the corresponding probeset on the M. truncatula Gene Expression Atlas. Chr Pos is the gene position in
kilobase pairs (Kbp) on each chromosome established from CViT blast searches. Gene loci indicates the gene locus number/s present at each site. Splice variant
(SV) numbers of the 7 MtSERK3 SVs are given. GenBank numbers apply to full-length mRNA sequences deposited on the NCBI database. Length, molecular
weight (MW) and pI values of predicted protein sequences are shown.

searches of all of the predicted amino acid sequences of
the putative SERK genes on the NCBI database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov showed MtSERKs 2-6 have high
similarity to AtSERK3. The other three MtSERKL genes
are similar to SERKs from various species, but in Arabidopsis, MtSERKL1 and MtSERKL2 are more similar to
NIK genes. The homology of the M. truncatula SERK
and SERKL sequences with each other and with Arabidopsis SERK and NIK sequences is shown in Additional
file 1.
In order to determine the chromosomal position of
each gene genomic full-length coding sequences plus
several hundred bases 5’ and 3’ of each gene were used
for a CViT blast search of the M. truncatula pseudomolecule: MT3.0 database. Each of the Medicago SERK and
SERKL genes, except for MtSERK1, showed 100% match
to the database, and the position of these is shown in
Table 1. MtSERK1 is not present on this database, with
its closest match corresponding to part of MtSERK2
sequence on chromosome 2. The gene loci numbers are
also shown in Table 1, with MtSERKs2, 3 and 5 each
occupying two loci.
Predicted motifs in Medicago genes and comparison with
Arabidopsis SERKs

The positions of the different SERK domains in Arabidopsis SERKs are indicated above the sequence alignment in Figure 1. All of the M. truncatula sequences
except for MtSERK3 have a predicted signal peptide.
MtSERK3 is predicted to be secreted in a non-classical
manner. The consensus sequence of a leucine zipper
Leu-X6-Leu-X6-Leu-X6-Leu, where X is any residue [37]
is present in MtSERKs 1, 2, 5 and 6. It is absent in the
remaining M. truncatula SERK-like proteins and is also
absent in Arabidopsis SERKs 4 and 5 as well as the
three Arabidopsis NIKs. All of these proteins have partial leucine zipper sequences, with the first Leu-X6-Leu
sequence intact, but lack other conserved leucines and/
or have extra residues between conserved leucines
(Figure 1). The positions of the five SERK LRRs are
indicated in Figure 1. There is good alignment of the
LRRs with the exception of LRR 5 in the three Medicago SERKL proteins. The SPP domain is not well conserved. The SERK-characteristic SPP motif, highlighted
yellow in Figure 1 is not present in all SERK proteins
with AtSERKs 4 and 5 lacking this motif. In M. truncatula the SPP motif is present in MtSERKs 1, 2, 4 and 5,
but is lacking in the other proteins. The Medicago
SERKL proteins show the least amount of homology in
this domain. All of the M. truncatula sequences contain
predicted transmembrane and kinase domains. The
genomic structure of each of the M. truncatula SERK
and SERKL genes and the relative positions of the SERK
genes on chromosome 2 are shown in Figure 2. Each of

Page 4 of 16

the genes contains 11 exons which is characteristic of
SERK genes. The gene encoding several putative splice
variants is MtSERK3. One of the splice variants contains
the usual SERK exon structure with eleven exons as
shown in Figure 2. The main variation in the gene
structure between the different M. truncatula genes is
in the length of the introns.
Another characteristic of SERK genes is conservation
of exon boundary sites with the tendency for different
protein domains to be encoded by separate exons [4].
The positions of each exon boundary site in each
sequence are shown in Figure 1. Each of the M. truncatula sequences identified and the Arabidopsis NIKs have
similar boundary sites to the Arabidopsis SERKs, with
the exception of AtNIK1, which is missing two boundary sites, with a single exon encoding the equivalent of
exons 9, 10 and 11 in the other genes. The boundaries
of greatest divergence occur between exons 6/7 and 7/8.
Exons 6, 7 and 8 encode LRR5, the SPP and the transmembrane domains respectively.
SERK gene prediction from the soybean genome

Soybean (Glycine max) has three genes annotated as
SERK genes on the NCBI database. However two of
these sequences (GenBank numbers EU869193 and
FJ014794) are sequences from the same gene. The other
sequence is Genbank number EU888313. There is also
one annotated NIK gene in soybean (GenBank number
FJ014718). To identify other putative SERK and SERKlike genes in soybean, the mRNA sequences of the M.
truncatula SERK and SERK-like genes were blasted
against the genomic sequence of soybean. Fourteen
more SERK-like genomic sequences were obtained, and
from these mRNA and amino acid sequences were
predicted.
Phylogenetic analysis of legume SERK genes

A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the predicted
amino acid sequences of the M.truncatula SERK and
SERK-like genes, the three soybean SERK and NIK
genes present in the database and the fourteen soybean
genes predicted from the soybean genome sequence.
Also included in the tree are all LRRII subgroup RLKLRR genes from Arabidopsis and SERKs from the NCBI
database representing full length AA sequences from a
number of other plant species (Figure 3). As indicated
by the blast searches some of the M. truncatula
sequences form a clade with the known SERKs.
MtSERKL1 and MtSERKL2 fall into a clade with the
soybean and Arabidopsis NIKs. Sequences of four of the
predicted soybean genes also fall in the NIK clade. One
Medicago sequence, MtSERKL3, along with three Arabidopsis sequences and four of the predicted soybean
sequences form a clade that is separate from the SERK

Figure 1 Alignment of all 5 Arabidopsis SERKs, three Arabidopsis NIKs and M. truncatula SERK and SERK-like amino acid sequences.
The positions of exon boundaries are shown on each sequence with a red vertical line. Exon numbers are shown in red text below the
sequence alignment. Positions of SERK protein domains are shown above the alignment. Boxed areas with Roman numerals indicate the 10
subdomains of the kinase domain. Conserved leucines of the leucine zipper are highlighted blue. The SPP motif of the SPP domain is
highlighted yellow. The conserved catalytic aspartate residue in subdomain VI of the kinase domain is highlighted green and the conserved
arginine of RD protein kinases immediately preceding the conserved asparatate is indicated with an R above the alignment [68]. The activation
loop in subdomains VII and VII is shown in red text.

Figure 2 Genomic structure of MtSERK1 and each SERK or SERKL gene obtained from genomic information on the NCBI database and
from cDNA sequencing. A. Exons are shown as dark boxes and introns in light grey. Gene sizes are shown from the start to the stop codon.

and NIK clades (Labelled “Other” in Figure 3). The four
non-Arabidopsis, non-legume sequences that fall in the
NIK clade (Pt1, Os1, PpSERK1 and PpSERK2 in Figure
3) have been annotated as SERKs in the literature and/
or on the NCBI database. This phylogenetic analysis
shows that the five sequences from chromosome 2 that
have been named as MtSERK2-6 are part of the SERK3/
4/5 family clade, with MtSERK1 the only M. truncatula
sequence in the SERK1/2 subfamily. One known and
two predicted soybean sequences fall into the SERK1/2
subfamily. One known and four predicted soybean
sequences fall into the SERK3/4/5 subfamily. Together
the phylogenetic and exon boundary results indicate
high similarity between the SERK and NIK genes. The
M. truncatula sequences have been deposited on the
NCBI database (For GenBank numbers see Table 1).
In the SERK3/4/5 subfamily, two soybean genes lie
adjacent on chromosome 5, (Glyma05g24770 and Glyma05g24790) but there is not a region with five genes
in tandem as is found on chromosome 2 in M. truncatula. Lotus japonicus is more closely related to M.

truncatula than soybean [38]. A search of the database
revealed only one Lotus predicted gene similar to the
Medicago SERK3/4/5 genes. This gene occurs on chromosome 6 (Genbank accession number AP006424),
which is syntenic to M. truncatula chromosome 2 [39].
This Lotus genomic DNA sequence showed sequence
homology with all five Medicago SERK3/4/5 genes, with
some sequence homology in introns and in 5’ and 3’
untranslated regions, as well as in exons. These results,
combined with the fact that no other potential
sequences were found in the Lotus genome, indicate
that the single SERK gene region on Lotus chromosome
6 probably corresponds to the five SERK gene region on
M. truncatula chromosome 2. These five SERK genes in
Medicago may have duplicated since it diverged from
Lotus. At this point it is unknown whether legumes closely related to Medicago also have replication of this
SERK gene as there is as yet no sequence information.
The intron sequences of the five replicated M. truncatula genes were used to estimate the times of duplication of these genes. It is estimated that duplication

Figure 3 Phlyogenetic analysis of protein sequences from all Arabidopsis RLK-LRR subclass LRRII genes, Medicago SERK and SERKL
genes, known and predicted NIK and SERK-like protein sequences from soybean and SERK or SERK-like genes from a number of
different species. The soybean sequences that were predicted from genomic sequence are indicated by their gene locus number preceded by
“Gm.” The loci numbers of soybean protein sequences from the protein database are Gm10g36280 (GmSERK1), Gm08g19270 (Gm2) and
Gm13g07060 (GmNIK). Sequences falling into the SERK1/2 subfamily are indicated with blue lines-sequences from dicotyledonous plants in light
blue and from monocotyledonous plants in dark blue. The SERK3/4/5 subfamily is indicated with purple lines. Other non-SERK, non-NIK genes
are a sister clade to these (shown in green). Sequences belonging to the NIK family clade are indicated with red lines. Sequences from the
primitive Bryophyte, Marchantia polymorpha, Mp1 and Mp2, sit separately from the other family genes, but could be classed as a SERK and a NIK
gene respectively. Estimated times of duplication events (indicated by numbers 1-4) in M. truncatula SERK 3/4/5 subfamily genes are: 1 - 3.25, 2 3.05, 3 - 2.65 and 4 - 2.2 million years ago.

ago as indicated in Figure 3.
MtSERK3 transcripts

PCR analysis suggested a total of seven different transcripts consistent with seven splice variants of MtSERK3
. The differences observed between the splice variants is
that they either include an intron or introns in their
sequence and/or are missing exon 3 (Figure 4). Introns
that are included as exons are introns 5, 6 and 8, either
alone or in combination. Each of these intron sequences
introduces a stop codon thereby creating a truncated
coding sequence. Splice variant (SV) 1 has the structure
of a normal SERK gene, containing 11 exons. SV3 is
also full length except it lacks exon 3, which encodes
the first LRR. SV2 and SV4 retain intron 8, with SV4
also lacking exon 3. The remaining three splice variants
lack exon 3 and retain intron 5 and its associated stop

codon. SV5 and SV6 retain intron/s after intron 5, but
the three SVs 5-7 encode the same protein sequence.
Together the seven SVs encode five predicted proteins.
Although five of the SV sequences contain stop codons
in introns 5 or 8, the transcript continues through the
remaining coding sections found in a typical SERK gene.
In these sequences a second possible transcript occurs
with a predicted start codon in exon 9 in the region
encoding subdomain IV of the the kinase domain. This
sequence continues through to the position of the stop
codon in exon 11 of SV1 (usual SERK gene structure).
This was confirmed by sequencing in SVs 4, 5, 6 and 7.
In SV2, sequence data was not obtained for sequence
corresponding to most of exon 10 and exon 11.
Although the MtSERK3 gene contains the typical 11
exon SERK genomic structure and SV1 has characteristics
of a typical SERK transcript, there are some features that
distinguish this gene from other SERKs. The first feature is

Figure 4 Representation of the seven splice variants (SVs) identified from the MtSERK3 gene. The exons which comprise the regular SERK
gene structure are shown as wide dark rectangles (numbered) on a thin grey line representing introns. SV1 contains eleven exons with the
structure of a typical SERK gene. The other splice variants have one or a combination of retained intron sequences and/or loss of exon 3 in the
mRNA transcript. In transcripts missing exon 3 this exon is shown as a white rectangle. Included introns are shown as grey hatched areas. The
star above each sequence is in the position of the predicted stop codon. SVs 5, 6 and 7 all encode the same amino acid sequence although
their transcripts differ 3’ of the stop codon. SV4 was only sequenced up to exon 10 position so it is possible there was some more variation in
the region of the last two exons.

expression in both the embryogenic 2HA and nonembryogenic Jemalong genotypes. These results show
that MtSERK1 is not the only SERK gene induced in
culture at the time of induction of SE. MtSERKs 3 and 5
are upregulated four to five-fold over expression in the
starting leaf material and remain relatively high over the
four weeks. This is a similar expression pattern to that
observed for MtSERK1 [9]. However, as the expression
results for MtSERK3 do not distinguish between splice
variants, it is not known which or how many splice variants contribute to these expression levels. Expression of
MtSERK4 and 6 are more significantly upregulated (1220 fold) within the first week of culture, then the
expression decreases slightly (but not significantly) over
the culture time measured. The variation in expression
pattern between MtSERK2 and the other replicated
SERK genes indicate some differences in function.

terminating just after the kinase domain (Figure 1).
Expression of Medicago SERKs during the induction of
somatic embryogenesis in culture

The apparent recent duplications of an ancestral gene to
create the five SERK genes on chromosome 2 raised the
question of whether or not the five Medicago genes are
redundant in function of whether they have developed
divergent functions. Our previous work showed that
MtSERK1 expression is induced in somatic embryoforming and root forming cultures [9] and we were
interested to know if other SERK genes played a role in
SE. Quantitiative RT-PCR (qPCR) expression studies
were conducted on these five MtSERKs in cultured
M. truncatula tissue. Relative expression was compared
over a four-week time course in cultured leaf tissue
from both the embryogenic 2HA seedline and the nonembryogenic Jemalong seedline (Figure 5). The expression of MtSERK3 was measured using primers that
would amplify all putative splice variants of this gene.
Therefore expression shown is the sum expression of all
splice variants. Like MtSERK1, MtSERKs 3-6 are upregulated within the first week of culture and show similar

Discussion
SERK genes identified in M. truncatula

Previous Southern analysis indicated there are probably
five SERK genes in M. truncatula [9], but we have
now identified a total of eight SERK or SERKL genes
in addition to the previously characterised MtSERK1.
Each of these nine genes contains 11 exons which is

characteristic of SERK genes, as well as the tendency
for each exon to encode a specific protein domain.
Phylogenetic analysis shows that five of these genes are
SERKs, belonging to the SERK 3/4/5 subfamily. The
other three do not fall into the SERK family as defined
in Arabidopsis, but rather are SERK-like genes. Two of
them, MtSERKL1 and MtSERKL2 fall into the NIK
family, which is highly similar to the SERK family. The
third one, MtSERKL3 is also closely related but is not
in the same clade as the SERK or NIK genes.
The carrot SERK does not contain a signal peptide,
but rather starts from the leucine zipper (exon 2 in
other SERKs). A perfect leucine zipper (Leu-X6-Leu-X6Leu-X 6 -Leu [37]), is not present in AtSERKs 4 and 5
and the specific SPP motif of the SPP domain is also
lacking in these sequences (Figure 1). However, phylogenetic analysis favours the view that these are still SERKs
[40](Figure 3). The Arabidopsis NIK genes share many
similarities with SERK genes. Several genes from other
species that have been named as SERK genes fall in the
same clade as the NIK genes (Figure 3). Function has
not been identified for the three Arabidopsis genes that
fall into the clade with MtSERKL3.
SERK genes in legumes

Although the M. truncatula genome is not yet fully
sequenced, we have attempted to identify all SERK
genes in this species. From the identified SERKs, only
one belongs to the SERK 1/2 subfamily (as defined in
Arabidopsis), while there are five in the SERK 3/4/5
subfamily. This indicates there are probably not direct
orthologues to the five Arabidopsis SERKs. Recently soybean became the first legume genome to be completely
sequenced [41]. The soybean genome has 20 pairs of
chromosomes and is a tetraploid, whereas the diploid
M. truncatula genome has 8 pairs of chromosomes. It is
estimated that the soybean genome underwent duplication around 13 million years ago and that any given
region in the M. truncatula genome is likely to correspond to two regions in the soybean genome [42]. A
search for candidate SERK and SERK-like known and
predicted genes in soybean revealed 17 genes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three of these fall into the
SERK1/2 subfamily, in comparison to one in M. truncatula. Like Medicago, there are five putative SERK 3/4/5
subfamily members in soybean. Five members fall into
the NIK clade and four are part of the clade, containing
MtSERKL3, separate to SERK and NIK.
In evolutionary terms, the closest legume to M. truncatula that has SERK sequence information is Lotus.
The divergence of Medicago and Lotus is estimated to
have occurred around 50 million years ago, after the
divergence of soybean from Medicago and Lotus around
54 million years ago [38]. The predicted gene in Lotus

Page 10 of 16

which appears to be orthologous to the five SERK3/4/5
family member genes is a single copy gene, indicating
that the Medicago genes may have duplicated after the
divergence of Medicago and Lotus. We estimate the
duplication of the Medicago genes occurred much more
recently - from 3.25 to 2.2 million years ago. Phylogenetically there are two soybean genes that are equally closely related to these five Medicago SERKs (Gm08g19270
(Gm2) and Gm15g05730; Figure 3). These genes occur
on different chromosomes and would originate from
duplication of the entire soybean genome rather that
duplication of a single gene. However, duplication has
occurred on a less closely related soybean SERK3/4/5
gene, with two genes occurring in tandem on chromosome 5 (Gm05g24770 and Gm05g24790; Figure 3). It
appears that soybean had its own SERK3/4/5 family
member duplication event after its divergence from
Medicago and Lotus.
In the SERK and SERKL genes there is not a simple ratio
of two soybean genes for every Medicago gene, as would
be expected from simple duplication of the soybean genome. It may be that not all of the Medicago genes have
been identified, especially those that are not in the SERK
clade. On the other hand, there is the likelihood of genome changes in both of the species during the past 50 million years to produce the gene compliment that is
identified. Full sequencing of the M. truncatula genome
would be the only way to fully and conclusively elucidate
the complement of these genes in M. truncatula.
SERK and SERKL genes in relation to development and
defence

We propose the similarities between SERK and NIK genes
in both structure and function indicate that these gene
families, as well as other closely related LRR-RLKs, form
part of a larger gene superfamily that operates in signalling
during plant development and defence. The families cannot be segregated based on developmental or defence
function, with both families containing members in each
type of role and some individual members operating in
both pathways. For example, Os5 (Figure 3, SERK1/2 subfamily) has a dual role in somatic embryogenesis and
defence against fungal pathogens [30], Os3 (Figure 3,
SERK1/2 sub-family) is linked to fungal defense [43], socalled PpSERK1 and PpSERK2 (Figure 3, NIK family), act
in the early defining stages of apomixis [44]. Therefore it
may be advantageous to consider the wider SERK/NIK
gene superfamily, encompassing all LRRII subclass genes,
when looking at SERK gene function in plants.
Expression of Medicago SERKs during the induction of
somatic embryogenesis in culture

Historically legumes have been difficult to transform
and regenerate. The model legume, M. truncatula can

Nolan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/44

be transformed and regenerated via somatic embryogenesis, but there is first a requirement for selection of an
amenable genotype using tissue culture [45-48]. A role
for MtSERK1 during the establishment of embryogenic
and organogenic cultures in M. truncatula was implied
when it was shown that this gene is upregulated under
these culture conditions. Expression of MtSERKs 3, 4, 5
and 6 , like MtSERK1 is significantly upregulated in
both 2HA and Jemalong cultured tissue in comparison
to expression in the starting leaf tissue (week 0),
whereas the expression of MtSERK2 remains constant
throughout culture and in the starting leaf tissue. This
variance in expression pattern suggests that MtSERK2
at least, functions differently to MtSERKs 3-6. MtSERK4
and MtSERK6 are the most highly upregulated SERKs
in culture with both showing greater than 12 fold upregulation of expression in the first week of culture
(Figure 5). The expression of the three Medicago SERKL
genes stayed fairly constant in leaf tissue and in culture
suggesting these genes are not part of the regulation of
events in culture (data not shown).
Our intron analysis indicates that the MtSERK2 and
MtSERK3 genes arose from the first duplication event,
esimated to be 3.25 mya. This raises the possibility that
any function dependent on upregulation of MtSERKs 3 6 in culture evolved after the first duplication event
which may be of significance when comparing the
embryogenic capacity of different legume species. It was
also noted that the promoter sequences of the five replicated M. truncatula SERK 3/4/5 subfamily member
genes show greater sequence divergence between the
members than the intron sequences (data not shown).
Such a rapid change in gene promoters also supports the
theory of functional divergence of these genes. In
M. truncatula SERK1 expression is associated with developmental change [35]. It seems likely that as in Arabidopsis, heterodimers involving SERK1 with other SERKs
or other RLKs help to regulate legume development.
Splice variant

To our knowledge, the detection of sequences consistent
with the existence of splice variants of MtSERK3 is a
novel observation for a SERK gene. An understanding of
AS in plants is in its early days, but it is estimated that
AS occurs in about 20% of plant genes. What is known
is the predominant form of AS in plants is in the form
of intron retention comprising around 50% - 60% of AS
events, with exon skipping comprising around 8%. This
is quite different from the situation in humans where
exon skipping is the predominant form of AS (58%) and
intron retention comprises around 5% [49,50]. Using
sequence data from ESTs an attempt has been made to
identify alternatively spliced genes in Arabidopsis, rice
and legumes and this information has been deposited

Page 11 of 16

on the ASIP (Alternative Splicing in Plants) database at
http://www.plantgdb.org/ASIP/ [49,50]. As MtSERK3 is
one of the genes that had no corresponding ESTs on
the database, it is not listed in the M. truncatula splice
variants on the ASIP database. None of the five Arabidopsis SERK genes are listed as having splice variants.
However, AS events are recorded in other LRR-RLKs,
and in a separate study 34 alternatively spliced LRRRLKs were identified in Arabidopsis [51]. AS producing
premature stop codons, such as SVs 2,4,5,6 and 7 of
MtSERK3, may produce transcripts that are targets for
non-sense mediated RNA decay [49]. However, NerGaon (2004) [52] presented evidence that transcripts
with retained introns are exported from the nucleus and
are associated with ribosomal complexes thus supporting the view that they may be functional.
The seven splice variant sequences observed in
MtSERK3 are predicted to code for five different proteins
(Figure 4), including SV1 that has a regular SERK-like
structure. The structure of SV2 and SV4 gives these proteins structural similarity to the known RLPs such as
CLAVATA2 (CLV2) [53]. The SVs 5, 6 and 7, encode a
single severely truncated predicted protein which contains the N-terminal, lacking LRR1, with a stop codon
introduced immediately after the position of LRR4 in a
normal SERK gene. This leaves the first two exons,
encoding the putative SP and ZIP domains, then three
LRRs followed by a stop codon. We have no knowledge
of reports of a similar truncated LRR-RLK in the literature and it is quite conceivable that such a protein is targeted for degradation. On the other hand there are other
defence proteins that are encoded by alternatively spliced
genes where it has been shown that AS of these genes is
necessary to enable the defence function [54]. For example, the Arabidopsis RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS
SYRINGAE4 (RPS4) gene belonging to the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-nucleotide binding site (NBS)-Leurich repeat (LRR) class of disease resistance (R) genes is
alternatively spliced to give both full-length and truncated proteins, and the presence of all of these proteins is
required for disease resistance [55]. In general there is a
bias for alternatively spliced genes with intron retention
in plants to function in defence and external/internal stimuli-related functions [52]. Additionally, in the mouse,
members of the TOLL-like receptor signalling pathway
show widespread alternative splicing, which is thought
to allow a higher level of diversity in the inflammatory
pathway in response to pathogens [56]. The already
established role for SERK genes in defence raises the possibility that some defence effect related to AS could be
operating in MtSERK3. Of course such a role would need
to be shown experimentally.
In keeping with a potential defence role, a recent study
suggests that plant LRR-RLK genes can be grouped

Nolan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/44

according to whether or not they have undergone gene
expansion [57]. The authors propose that the expanded
group share similarities with the NBS-LRR resistance
genes in their genetic variation and evolution and are
more likely to function in disease resistance, whereas
the non-expanded group have a tendency to function in
growth and development. The expansion of the five
Medicago SERK3/4/5 family member genes from a single ancestor may imply a role in defence for one or
more of them. This observation along with the similar
gene splicing to that observed in TIR-NBS-LRR genes is
supportive of a role for MtSERK3 in defence. The rice
SERK1/2 family member gene, OsBISERK1, [43] (Os3 in
Figure 3) is one example of a defence related gene
belonging to the expanded group [57].
MtSERK3 has other unusual features. One is its lack
of a predicted signal peptide, although it is predicted to
be secreted in a non-classical manner. The other is the
truncation of the C-terminal domain in comparison to
other SERK proteins. The actual function of the SERK Cterminal domain is unknown, but one possibility is a role
in protein-protein interactions [7]. The distinct characteristics of MtSERK3 may indicate a rapid evolution of
different function after the gene duplication events which
had created five genes from a single ancestral gene. The
creation of extra gene copies relaxed selective pressure
allowing some copies to evolve new functions, while at
least one of the genes maintained the original function.
However MtSERK3 is still upregulated in tissue culture
which also implies a developmental role during early culture events similar to that of MtSERK1 and to other
SERKs that were first described in relation to SE.

Conclusions
In this study we have identified and sequenced the
mRNAs of five more SERK and three SERK-like genes in
M. truncatula, and used these sequences to identify
homologous genes in soybean. Phylogenetic analysis
shows that some of these genes fall distinctly in the SERK
family, while others are SERK-like which include NIK
genes and other LRRII subgroup RLK-LRR family members. The M. truncatula SERK3/4/5 subfamily genes have
undergone a gene duplication event that is not present in
orthologous genes in soybean or Lotus. One of these
duplicated genes apparently encodes a number of
sequences, consistent with the existence of splice variants, which is a novel finding for a SERK gene. The gene
duplication event and the presence of splice variants may
be indicative of a role in defence, similar to that observed
in NBS-LRR genes. Other members of this replicated
SERK3/4/5 gene cluster are upregulated in embryogenic
tissue cultures implying a similar developmental role to
that previously observed for MtSERK1 [9,35].

Methods
Degenerate PCR and database mining

Degenerate primers for PCR were designed in the conserved kinase domain of SERK genes. To give greater
specificity at the 3’ end of the primers, each primer was
made into two separate primers with a specific nucleotide at a point of degeneracy close to the 3’ end where
there was a choice of 2 nucleotides (underlined bases in
primer sequences below). This gave the forward primers
8 specific bases and the reverse primer 5 specific bases
at the 3’ ends. The primers used were Forward 1 - 5’CAR TTY CAR CAN GAR GTN GAA ATG AT-3,’ Forward 2 - 5’- CAR TTY CAR CAN GAR GTN GAG
ATG AT-3’, Reverse 1 5’- CC RTA NCC RAA NAC
RTC NGT YTT TTC -3’, Reverse 2 - 5’- CC RTA NCC
RAA NAC RTC NGT YTT CTC -3.’ The degeneracy
was 256-fold for the forward primers and 1024-fold for
the reverse primers, with a predicted amplicon size of
around 446 bp. Degenerate PCR was performed on
cDNA and genomic DNA using a 2 μM concentration
of each primer. PCR cycling conditions were a denaturation step of 3 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s,
52°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s, and then 1 cycle of
72°C for 7 min. PCR products were cloned into pGEM
Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. Sequencing of
four cDNA clones revealed they all belonged to the
same gene which corresponded to TC100619. Sequencing of 14 genomic clones gave four individual
sequences, however one of them did not appear to be a
SERK sequence. Genes that were detected using degenerate PCR are indicated in Table 1.
To conduct database mining the mRNA sequences of
known SERK genes were blasted against M. truncatula
sequences in the DFCI Medicago Gene Index and NCBI
nr and htgs databases. Two genomic DNA regions containing SERK-like sequences and seven TCs or ESTs
were identified in addition to the already annotated
MtSERK1. The genomic DNA regions identified were on
chromosomes 2 and 5, with the region on chromosome 2
containing multiple predicted SERK-like genes. Four of
the detected TCs matched chromosome 2. The remaining three TC/ESTs matched regions on chromosomes 3,
5 and 8. A summary of all sequences is shown in Table 1.
All of the SERK and SERK-like sequences identified using
degenerate PCR corresponded to sequences identified
from the database searches or matched MtSERK1.
The chromosomal location of each M. truncatula
SERK and SERKL gene was determined by performing a
genomic sequence CViT blast of each gene against the
M. truncatula pseudomolecule: MT3.0 database http://
www.medicago.org/genome/cvit_blast.php. The actual
gene sequences were obtained from the Medicago
GBrowse v3 database http://gbrowse.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/

Nolan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/44

gbrowse/medicago/ by following the links from the
CViT blast results, selecting the appropriate postion on
the chromosome and downloading the sequence data.
These were then compared with the sequence data for
each gene obtained from NCBI and from sequencing.
Some manual adjustment was required to locate the
total gene sequence from some blast results. The corresponding gene loci numbers of each sequence were also
obtained from the Medicago GBrowse v3 database.
Matching probeset IDs were obtained by blasting
mRNA sequences against the Mt Affy Chip Consensus
Sequences database on the M. truncatula Gene Expression Atlas website http://mtgea.noble.org/v2/.
PCR amplification and sequencing of full length coding
regions

As none of the TC/EST sequences identified represented full length coding sequences, potential coding
regions from the individual genomic sequences were
predicted using FGENESH software (Softberry; http://
linux1.softberry.com) and this information was matched
with sequences obtained from the DFCI Medicago Gene
Index. Primers were designed from the known and predicted coding sequences and in predicted 5’ and 3’
untranslated regions, and these were used to amplify full
length or overlapping partial length cDNA sequences.
These regions were sequenced, either directly from the
purified PCR product or were cloned into pGEMeasy
vector, electroporated into E. coli and sequenced after
either miniprep or colony PCR. Using this system any
previously unsequenced sections of mRNA transcripts
were PCR amplified and sequenced, giving full length
sequence data for all of the identified M. truncatula
genes. The cDNA used to obtain the sequences came
from different sources of plant tissue including, flower,
leaf, root, seedling, cultured tissue and somatic embryos.
Tissue from both 2HA and Jemalong seedlines was used
to make cDNA. Mostly pooled cDNA samples from various tissues were used as a template source. Where possible a full length coding sequence was amplified in a
single PCR reaction and used for sequencing. The three
genes which did not have any transcript sequences on
the database (MtSERKs 3, 4 and 6) required nested PCR
reactions or shorter overlapping PCRs to obtain full
length product for sequencing. In the case of MtSERK3,
numerous nested PCR and cloning reactions from different tissue sources were required to identify the various
splice variant sequences. However all of the nested PCR
products used for sequencing of splice variants, with the
exception of SV2, were full-length or almost full length
sequences to ensure the sequence obtained did indeed
come from a single transcript. In the case of SV2 the
nested reverse primer was in exon 10. In all cases the
products of the first PCR reaction, used as a source of

Page 13 of 16

template for nested PCR, were created using primers
that amplified the full length coding sequence of the
gene. Primers used for genes amplified in a single PCR
reaction were: MtSERK2 - forward primer 5’-TCT
CATCTTTTTGCTTCCATTC-3’, reverse primer 5’AAAGTGTTGGTTGCTTGTGTC-3’; MtSERK5 forward
primer 5’-GAGAGAGAGGGTTTGTGTTTT-3’, reverse
primer 5’-AGAGGACGGATTGTGTATTG-3’; MtSER
KL1 - forward primer 5’-CTCCTTTACCTTTACCAC
ACTTC-3’, reverse primer 5’-ATCTACAACAACCCC
AAATAACA-3’; MtSERKL2 - forward primer 5’-GGT
TTCTTCTGCTGCTCTTTCTC-3’, reverse primer 5’CAGAAAGCTCCATTGCTTCTAC-3’ and MtSERKL3 forward primer 5’-AATTAAAGGGTTGGTTCATT
CTT-3’, reverse primer 5’-TCCAATCTGGTATG GT
CTGT-3’. MtSERK4 was amplified in two overlapping
PCR reactions using the primers - forward primer
5’-GCAAAGAAAACAAACAAAAGCCATAC-3’ with
reverse primer 5’-CTGGTGACGGTGGAGAAAGTG-3’
and forward primer 5’-GAGATGTCCCCAAGAGTG
GTTC-3’ with reverse primer 5’-TTTATCTCGTTC
AGGCAGAGGA-3’. MtSERK6 was amplified using
nested PCR reactions. Primers for the first PCR were
forward primer 5’-TGGAGTTTGATAATGGGTTT
CTTG-3’ with reverse primer 5’-CAGGCAGAGGAA
GAAGGATTGT-3’. Products from the first PCR were
diluted 1 in 100 and amplified using the same reverse
primer and a nested forward primer 5’-TTTGG TTC
TTCATTTGCTGCTTC-3’. Splice variant sequences for
MtSERK3 were obtained using a number of nested PCR
reactions followed by cloning and sequencing. For each
splice variant the full length coding sequence was amplified in the first PCR reaction. The primers used for the
nested PCR amplified a full length or almost full length
coding sequence (except for SV2; sequence up to exon
10 obtained). A summary of the tissue and primers used
in the PCR reactions to obtain the full SV sequences are
given in Additional file 2.
Gene and motif prediction

The genomic structure of the genes sequenced was determined using Spidey on the NCBI database http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Ostell/Spidey/. Prediction
of mRNA sequences from genomic sequences was done
using FGENESH software from Softberry http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml. Predicted amino acid sequences
from the sequenced genes were used for motif prediction
using the ExPASy Proteomics tools server http://au.expasy.
org/tools/. A general scan of the sequence was performed
using Scan PROCITE [58]. Signal peptides were predicted
using SignalP 3.0 [59]. Prediction of whether proteins
could be secreted in a non-classical manner (without a signal peptide) was performed using Secretome 2.0 [60]. Due
to the lack of plant parameters with this program, the

Nolan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/44

protein was classed as mammalian for prediction. Transmembrane domains were predicted using TMHMM 2.0
[61]. MW and pI were estimated using ProtParam [62].
Amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic
analysis

Full length predicted amino acid sequences were aligned
using ClustalX 2.0.10 [63]. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed on aligned sequences using the protein maximum likelihood, proml, programme and tree topology
edited using Retree from the PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) Version 3.69 http://evolution.genetics.
washington.edu/phylip.html. Trees were drawn using
TreeView 1.6.6 http://www.treeview.net/.
Identification of putative SERK genes in soybean

A blast search of Gm genome soybean chromosomes
(JGI Glyma1) on the Plant GDB database http://www.
plantgdb.org/GmGDB/ was conducted using the mRNA
sequences of each of the M. truncatula SERK genes to
find homologous sequences in the soybean genome.
From these searches it was possible to obtain the locus
number of each of the matching genes. These loci numbers were used to obtain the corresponding genome and
predicted mRNA and AA sequences from the Phytozome database http://www.phytozome.net/, which contains the full sequence of the recently sequenced
soybean genome.
Estimation of gene duplication events in MtSERK family
members

To estimate the time of duplication of the MtSERK 3/4/
5 subfamily member genes, each intron sequence of
each gene was compared to the corresponding intron
sequence in the other duplicated genes using the Needleman-Wunsch Global Sequence Alignment Tool at
NCBI [64]. The following parameters were used for
comparison: match cost 2, mismatch “-3”, gap cost 5,
gap extension 2. In some cases manual adjustment was
necessary. The number of substitutions and deletions
were counted and the age of duplication (distance) was
calculated for each pair, using the assumption of 3 × 1010
substitutions/site/year [65], and also taking into
account the fact that mutations occur independently in
each copy after a duplication event. Comparison of the
differences between different pairs of genes allowed the
calculation of the sequence and approximate times of
duplication events.
Quantitative RT-PCR

M. truncatula 2HA and Jemalong leaf tissue was collected, sterilised and cultured as described in [9]. RNA
was isolated from 2HA and Jemalong cultured and leaf

Page 14 of 16

tissue using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All RNA samples
were treated with DNase prior to cDNA synthesis.
cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript II
first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen)
from 2 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers. All
qPCR reactions were set up using the CAS1200 robot
(Qiagen formerly Corbett) and run on the Rotor-Gene
Q (Qiagen formerly Corbett). Primers were designed
using Primer3 programme (Primer3 site http://frodo.wi.
mit.edu/primer3/). Due to the similarity in sequence
between the M. truncatula SERK genes, each primer
was checked for specificity against an alignment of the
other M. truncatula SERK genes. The amplified PCR
products were tested for the presence of a single PCR
product using a high resolution disassociation curve
with temperature increasing in 0.2°C increments at the
end of each PCR run. For some of the genes a number
of different primer sets and annealing temperatures
were tested to find conditions with specificity. Primer
sequences used were: MtSERK2 - forward primer 5’AGTTGAAGAAAAATGGAACAAGTGA-3’, reverse
primer 5’- TCAGTGCATCACCTTCAACATTAG-3’;
MtSERK3 - forward primer 5’- GTGTATCGTGTTTAC
GAGAACGTAATGG-3’, reverse primer 5-TCACGGTGAATAATCTTAGGGTCACA-3; MtSERK4 - forward
primer 5’- CAATGAAGAAAGTGATGCCCTGAA-3’,
reverse primer 5’- CATCATTGCATCCAACATGA
AACC-3’; MtSERK5 - forward primer 5’- CTTCTT
CCAATGATGAAAGTGATGC-3’, reverse primer 5’-AT
CAACCCGGATTACTCTACCACCAC-3’ and MtSERK6
forward primer 5’- CATCACCAGCTTCTTCAGG
TAGCA-3’, reverse primer 5’- GCAGGAACGTCAAA
GAAATGATCC-3’. cDNA was diluted to 1 in 25 for
qPCR reactions. Reactions were performed in triplicate
in 15 μL sample volume using 0.3 units Platinum Taq
PCR polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 × Platinum Taq reaction
buffer, 3 mM CaCl 2 , 0.2 mM each of dATP, dCTP,
dGTP, dTTP and 2 μM SYTO9 fluorescent dye (Invitrogen). PCR cycling conditions were 94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s and
72°C for 30 s. For MtSERK3 and MtSERK6 PCR reactions the annealing temperature was increased to 64°C
to increase the specificity of the primers. Gene expression was normalised to expression of GAPDH. GAPDH
primers used were forward primer 5’- GACTTT
ATTGGTGATACCAGGTCG-3 and reverse primer 5’GGTCAACCACACGGGTACTGTAA-3’. PCR efficiency
of each run was calculated using the LinRegPCR
programme http://LinRegPCR.nl [66]. Relative expression was calculated according to the method of Pfaffl
[67]. Results shown are means ± SE of three biological
repeats.
