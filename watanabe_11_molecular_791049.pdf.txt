Abstract
Background: Species of the Fusarium genus are important fungi which is associated with health hazards in human
and animals. The taxonomy of this genus has been a subject of controversy for many years. Although many
researchers have applied molecular phylogenetic analysis to examine the taxonomy of Fusarium species, their
phylogenetic relationships remain unclear only few comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the Fusarium genus and
a lack of suitable nucleotides and amino acid substitution rates. A previous stugy with whole genome comparison
among Fusairum species revealed the possibility that each gene in Fusarium genomes has a unique evolutionary
history, and such gene may bring difficulty to the reconstruction of phylogenetic tree of Fusarium. There is a need
not only to check substitution rates of genes but also to perform the exact evaluation of each gene-evolution.
Results: We performed phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequences of the rDNA cluster region
(rDNA cluster), and the b-tubulin gene (b-tub), the elongation factor 1a gene (EF-1a), and the aminoadipate
reductase gene (lys2). Although incongruence of the tree topologies between lys2 and the other genes was
detected, all genes supported the classification of Fusarium species into 7 major clades, I to VII. To obtain a reliable
phylogeny for Fusarium species, we excluded the lys2 sequences from our dataset, and re-constructed a maximum
likelihood (ML) tree based on the combined data of the rDNA cluster, b-tub, and EF-1a. Our ML tree indicated
some interesting relationships in the higher and lower taxa of Fusarium species and related genera. Moreover, we
observed a novel evolutionary history of lys2. We suggest that the unique tree topologies of lys2 are not due to an
analytical artefact, but due to differences in the evolutionary history of genomes caused by positive selection of
particular lineages.
Conclusion: This study showed the reliable species tree of the higher and lower taxonomy in the lineage of the
Fusarium genus. Our ML tree clearly indicated 7 major clades within the Fusarium genus. Furthermore, this study
reported differences in the evolutionary histories among multiple genes within this genus for the first time.

Background
Species of the Fusarium genus are well-known important
plant pathogens, and are mycotoxin producers which are
associated with human and animal health hazards [1,2].
Fusarium species are well-researched in many fields, such
as molecular biology, ecology, phytopathology, medicalmycology, toxicology, and others. One problem commonly
encountered by researchers interested in Fusarium species

is the precise taxonomic system of the genus. In general,
species are recognized on the basis of the morphological
species concept, the biological species concept, the phylogenetic species concept or a combination of these [3]. Current classification schemes of fungi are exclusively based
on the morphological species concept, and identification
of the species primarily involves the use of morphological
characteristics [4]. Although traditional taxonomic systems
for the Fusarium genus have been proposed based on the
morphological species concept, the taxonomy of this
genus has been debated for many years [5-10]. Recently,
many researchers have applied molecular phylogenetic

analysis to examine the taxonomy of Fusarium species,
and have proposed new taxonomic systems based on the
phylogenetic species concept. However, many phylogenetic relationships remain unclear as only few comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the Fusarium genus have
been performed. Moreover, some previous studies have
reported phylogenetic trees with a low resolution, especially in the deep lineages, due to a lack of suitable nucleotide and amino acid substitution rates and other factors.
Recently, whole genome comparison among four
Fusairum species revealed the drastic genome-evolution
such as the horizontal gene transfer in Fusarium genomes [11]. Therefore, it is possible for each gene in
Fusarium genomes to have a unique evolutionary history, and it is necessary to perform exact evaluation of
the evolutionary processes of each gene. Moreover, a
unique evolutionary history of each gene in Fusarium
genomes may bring difficulty to the reconstruction of
phylogenetic tree among Fusarium species as mentioned
above. There is a need not only to check the nucleotide
and amino acid substitution rates of genes but also to
perform the exact evaluation of each gene-evolution.
Then, we should select suitable genes providing information for phylogenetic inference about both the higher
and lower taxa in the Fusarium tree.
Previously, some parts of the rDNA cluster region,
b-tub, and EF-1a have been used as genetic markers for
the phylogenetic analysis of fungal taxonomic groups,
including Fusarium species [12-14]. Furthermore, it has
been reported that the lys2 may be a good phylogenetic
marker for inferring relationships among fungal genera
[15] and among species of the Byssochlamys genus and
related genera [16]. In this study, we evaluated holistically the rDNA cluster region, b-tub, EF-1a, and lys2 as
markers to infer the reliable species tree of Fusarium
species, and re-constructed the phylogenetic tree using
the maximum likelihood method.

Results and discussions
Seven major clades of the Fusarium genus and the
incongruence of gene trees

The ML trees inferred from each of the concatenated
parts of the rRNA cluster region (rDNA cluster), E-tub
EF-1 D and lys2 are displayed in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4,
respectively. The tree topologies of the gene sequences
were not consistent with each other. However, all of the
gene trees supported the classification of Fusarium species into 7 major clades, namely, clades I to VII. Most of
the support values for these clades were very high (more
than 95% bootstrap value; BP), with the exceptions of
clade I (71% BP) and clade II (75% BP) of the b-tub ML
tree, clade V (88% BP) and clade VII (55% BP) of the
rDNA cluster ML tree, and clade VII (<50% BP) of the

lys2 ML tree. Our ML tree clearly indicated 7 major
clades within the Fusarium genus for the first time.
Many of taxonomic studies based on morphological
characters have reported that some “sections”, including
closely related species, share some “synapomorphic”
character states. Clade I consists of F. larvarum and
F. merismoides which belong to different “sections”,
namely, Eupionnotes and Arachnites, respectively.
Although the b-tub and EF-1a sequences supported the
monophyly of F. merismoides, the rDNA cluster supported a paraphyletic relationship for this species.
Clades II, III, and IV consist of single species, namely,
F. dimerum, F. solani, and F. decemcellulare, respectively. Clade V contains 2 “sections": Elegans, which
consists of F. oxysporum, and Liseola, which consists of
F. subglutinans, F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides.
Clade VI consists of F. lateritium, F. avenaceum, and
F. tricinctum, which belong to different “sections”, namely,
Lateritium, Roseum, and Sporotrichiella respectively. The
paraphyly of F. avenaceum and F. lateritium was supported by all the genes. Clade VII contains 4 “sections”
with 9 species: Eupionnotes consisting of F. incarnatum,
Gibbosum consisting of F. equiseti and F. acuminatum,
Discolor consisting of F. graminearum and F. culmorum,
and Sporotrichiella consisting of F. poae, F. kyusyuense,
F. sporotrichioides, and F. langsethiae. Our ML trees based
on each of the rDNA cluster and the 3 genes indicate that
the species in each of the clades (I to VII) have close relationships with each other.
Some taxonomic groups which were not previously
identified using the morphological species concept, have
already revealed by molecular phylogenetic analyses previously reported. O’Donnell et al. [14] showed that there
are species complexes including more than 2 species, such
as the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex. O’Donnell et
al. [14] and O’Donnell and Cigelnik [14,17] showed that
some sections proposed by morphological studies form
paraphyletic or polyphyletic groups, such as Sporotrichiella
and Discolor. This study supported their results. Moreover,
our results indicated some new taxonomic groups, such as
clade I and VI. The close relationships in two clades are
discussed in the paragraph of “Verification of monophyly
of the sections and species of the Fusarium genus”, as
described below.
Evaluation of incongruence of the gene trees

The phylogenetic relationships among clades I to VII differ from each other, as described above. To evaluate this
incongruence, we compared the log-likelihood scores of
the relationships among clades I to VII (Figure 1) (see
Additional file 1). The absolute values of the log likelihood scores of the ML trees, and the differences between
the log-likelihood scores of the ML tree ± 1SE and of the

Figure 1 Maximum likelihood trees for the Fusarium genus and related genera inferred from the rDNA cluster including 18S rDNA,
ITS1, 5.8S rDNA and 28S rDNA. The GTR + I + Γ model was used as the model for nucleotide substitution. Branch lengths are proportional to
the estimated number of nucleotide substitutions. The BP values over 75% are displayed on the nodes (BP; 1000 replicates).

alternative trees are displayed in Table 1. It can be concluded that. no significant differences were observed
between the EF-1a, rDNA cluster, and b-tub ML trees,
but all of these differed from the lys2 ML tree (p-value of
the SH test <0.001).
What is the reason for the differences in tree topology
observed among the genes? One possibility is that the
tree inference is an artefact. Another possibility is that
the genes have different evolutionary histories. In the
former case, the main factors which can lead to misleading tree inferences include (1) long-branch attraction,
(2) composition bias of nucleotide and amino acid, and
(3) convergent evolution.
Long-branch attraction mainly occurs as a consequence
of rapidly evolving sites, and removal of such sites from
the analysis can reduce the effects of long-branch attraction [18]. Accordingly, we excluded the fast evolving sites
of lys2. After the 3rd codon position sites or synonymous
substitution sites had been excluded, the tree topology
remained essentially the same as the ML tree displayed in

Figure 4. Furthermore, even when the ML tree was
inferred based upon the 2 nd codon positions only, the
tree topology remained essentially the same as the ML
tree displayed in Figure 4. Therefore, the possibility of
long-branch attraction is unlikely.
Extreme composition bias of nucleotides and amino
acids can strongly mislead tree inference [19,20]. Therefore, we examined composition bias of lys2 nucleotides
and amino acids in the lineages within our dataset.
However, no composition bias was observed in the
amino acid sequences or the combined 1st /2 nd codon
position sites. Composition bias of the 3rd codon position sites was detected in F. lateritium (MAFF235344
and MAFF840045), and of the combined 1st, 2nd and 3rd
codon position sites in F. tricinctum (CBS393.93,
ATCC38183, and MAFF235551). These species both
belong to clade VI. Therefore, it is unlikely that nucleotide composition bias can explain the phylogenetically
“misleading” observed among clades I to VII in ML
trees displayed in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Figure 2 Maximum likelihood trees for the Fusarium genus and related genera inferred from b-tub. The GTR + I + Γ model was used as
the model for nucleotide substitution. Branch lengths are proportional to the estimated number of nucleotide substitutions. Each codon
position was analysed separately. The BP values over 75% are displayed on the nodes (BP; 1000 replicates).

Although the principal theory of molecular phylogenetics is based on the neutral theory of molecular evolution [21], convergent evolution is known to occur at the
molecular level and can mislead the reconstruction of
phylogenetic trees [22,23]. As natural selection generally
acts at the level of amino acid sequences, synonymous
substitutions are unlikely to be affected by convergence.
Therefore, we inferred the phylogenetic tree using only
the 3rd codon positions because substitutions at these
sites are mainly synonymous. However, the lys2 ML tree
inferred only using the 3rd codon positions was essentially the same as the tree presented in Figure 4 (data
not displayed).
For these 3 reasons, it is unlikely that the incongruence of the lys2 ML tree and the other gene trees was
due to an analytical artefact. Instead, the differences in
tree topology may reflect differences in the evolutionary
histories of the considered genes. Therefore, when we
reconstructed the species tree, we excluded lys2 from
the analysis.

Evaluation of genetic markers for phylogenetic
reconstruction

To accurately reconstruct the phylogenetic tree, we
selected the genes which displayed an adequate evolutionary rate. ML trees based on each individual gene or
the rDNA regions are displayed in Figures 2, 3 and 4
and additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5. The substitution rates
of the 3 rDNA regions (5.8S, 18S, and 28S) were all
slow. Although the substitution rate of ITS1 was faster
than that of the rDNA genes, the sequence length was
very short (101 bp). Therefore, the nucleotide sequences
of each 4 rDNA regions were identical in several Fusarium species. When the 3 rDNA genes and ITS1 were
combined in a cluster, we could distinguish most of the
species from the nucleotide sequence data. However,
since only small differences were observed among species, some resolutions among the species in the same
clade were unclear (Figure 1). In contrast, the nucleotide
substitution rates of the protein coding genes, namely,
b-tub, EF-1a, and lys2, were rapid, and each of these

genes had a high resolution for the relationship among
conspecific strains or closely related species in the same
clade of I to VII (the lower taxa) (Figures 2, 3 and).
However, in the cases of b-tub and EF-1a, the alignment of amino acid sequences among Fusarium species
indicated that almost all of the substitutions were singletons, and parsimonious informative sites were limited
(data not shown). Therefore, almost all of the substitutions which occurred within the genomes of Fusarium
species were synonymous.
Pairwise comparisons of the substitution distances for
the nucleotide and amino acid sequences are displayed in
Figure 5 (Additional file 6). The distances in these graphs
were divided into 4 groups; between conspecific Fusarium-strains, between Fusarium-strains of different species in the same clade of I to VII, between Fusariumstrains in different clades of I to VII, and between strains
of Fusarium species and other genera. As for the nonsynonymous substitutions of b-tub and EF-1a, the numbers of non-synonymous substitutions in these genes
were too few to reconstruct the phylogenetic

relationships especially among clades I to VII and among
Fusarim and its related genera (the higher taxa) in the
lineage of the Fusarium genus (Figure 5A). The other 4
regions, namely, the rDNA cluster, the synonymous substitutions of b-tub and EF-1a, and the introns within EF1a, displayed the graphs forms split up into 2 groups: the
synonymous substitutions of b-tub/the introns within
EF-1a and the rDNA cluster/the synonymous substitutions of EF-1a (Figure 5). The graphs of the former
group (Figures 5C and 5E) were almost parallel to the ×
axis for the higher taxa. This implies that these 2 regions
are completely saturated in the case of examining among
the higher. However, these substitutions are useful for
examining among the lower taxa. The graphs of the latter
group (Figures 5B and 5D) are not linear but still everincreasing, and the substitution rates of this group are
not so slow. This result suggests that these substitutions
can provide information for phylogenetic reconstruction
for both the higher and lower taxa.
One of the aims of this study was to provide a comprehensive description of the phylogenetic relationships

Figure 4 Maximum likelihood trees for the Fusarium genus and related genera inferred from lys2. The GTR + I + Γ model was used as
the model for nucleotide substitution. Branch lengths are proportional to the estimated number of nucleotide substitutions. Each codon
position was analysed separately. The BP values over 75% are displayed on the nodes (BP; 1000 replicates). The branches with bold lines indicate
the lineages in which positive selection has occurred with the p-value under the null hypothesis that the ω (synonymous substitutions per
synonymous site/non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site) of the positively selected sites is equal to 1.0. (p < 0.001).

among Fusarium species and closely related species,
including both the higher and lower taxa. Therefore, we
require information obtained from multiple substitutions
in multiple genes to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree.
In this study, we considered all of the substitution information obtained from the rDNA cluster and the b-tub
and EF-1a genes. Substitutions within lys2 were
removed from our dataset because this locus is not suitable for the phylogenetic analysis of Fusarium and its
related species. We had to modify the weighting of

some nucleotides in the analysis because the information obtained from substitutions varied among sites with
a partition model, as described in the materials and
methods.

on the nodes. Our ML tree showed that M. nivale does
not belong to any of the 7 major clades of the Fusarium
species, and that this species, which is the common
ancestor of Fusarium species and N. crassa, rapidly
diverged during short term. Therefore, our analyses supported the previously described separation of M. nivale
from the Fusarium genus [13,24].
Booth [5] proposed that closely related sections have
the same teleomorph genus, and O’Donnell et al. [25]
indicated that all Fusarium species with teleomorphs
belonging to the Gibberella genus form a clade known
as the Gibberella clade. In this study, all of the examined species with teleomorphs belonging to the Gibberella genus clustered in a super-clade consisting of clades

V to VII (Figure 6). Our results thus support the classification of the Gibberella clade.
Marasas et al. [1] and Pitt and Hocking [2] were
reviewed that many Fusarium species produced many
kinds of mycotoxins and these toxins are associated
with human and animal health hazard. One of the main
mycotoxins which naturally pollute agricultural crops, is
trichotecenes or fumonisins. Our ML tree indicated that
most Fusarium species which produce trichothecenes,
clustered in a super-clade consisting of clade VI and
VII (Figure 6). This relationship suggested that a common ancestor had acquired the capacity to produce trichothecenes, and then some species might lose this
capacity.

Figure 6 Maximum likelihood tree of the Fusarium genus and related genera inferred from the combined sequences of the rDNA
cluster and the b-tub, and EF-a genes. Taking into account the different tempos and modes of nucleotide substitutions, all parameters of the
substitution model were separately estimated for each gene using the GTR + I + Γ model. The branch lengths are proportional to the estimated
number of nucleotide substitutions. For the protein-coding genes b-tub and EF-1a, each codon position was analysed separately. The bootstrap
probability (BP; 1000 replicates) values over 75% are displayed on the nodes. Sections supported by morphological taxonomic systems are
described, and include Arachnites, Arthrosporiella, Discolor; Elegans, Eupionnotes, Gibbosum, Lateritium, Liseola, Martiella and Ventricosum, Roseum,
Spicarioides, and Sporotrichiella.

Verification of monophyly of the sections and species of
the Fusarium genus

In our ML tree (Figure 6), many sections, which have
previously been defined based upon morphological characteristics, were not verified as monophyletic. In this
analysis, only Discolor (100% BP) was supported by a BP
value greater than 75%. Sections other than Discolor,
namely Arachnites, Eupionnotes, Gibbosum, and Sporotrichiella, which include 2 or more species in this study,
formed the paraphyletic and polyphyletic groups. These
results are consistent with previous studies reporting
that taxonomic groups, which were traditionally classified using the morphological species concept, are not
always recovered in molecular phylogenetic analyses of

the Fusarium genus. In particular, in the Eupionnotes
section, species were assembled using the morphological
species concept with section-specific characteristics such
as a very slow growth rate on potato dextrose agar
(PDA; Eiken) a yeast-like appearance due to the absence
of aerial mycelia, absence of microconidia, and small
macroconidia generally having only 1 to 2 septa [5,8].
Our results indicated that these characteristics are not
synapomorphies shared among only species in this section, such as F. dimerum and F. merismoides. Moreover,
morphological characteristics such as slow growth rate,
color of colonies on PDA from below (white to tan),
absence of microconidia, and small macroconidia appear
in the basal lineages containing species of clades I and

Watanabe et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:322
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/322

II, and M. nivale. Therefore, we consider these characteristics to be ancestral, and that they remain in species
of the basal lineages as symplesiomorphies. It is difficult
to distinguish among the synapomorphies, the symplesiomorphies, and convergent derived characters. Species
recognition on the basis of morphology often comprises
several species that are recognized on the basis of molecular phylogeny.
Although the morphological species concept does not
reflect the phylogenetic tree of the Fusarium genus, this
does not imply that morphological characteristics are
not useful for identification and taxonomy. On the contrary, species recognition based on morphological characteristics is also useful for identifying unknown species
because morphological characteristics can be widely
applied to any species, not only those of the Fusarium
genus but also other fungi [3,26]. Fusarium isolates can
be initially classified on the basis of morphological similarity, with the awareness that sections are in fact a
means of artificial grouping. Thus, it is still necessary to
use recognition methods based upon morphological
characteristics in combination with the phylogenetic
recognition method.
Although our ML tree was constructed with a high
resolution, the relationships among species that together
form a complex could not be resolved. Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses have suggested that a species of
the Liseola section, defined by traditional taxonomy
based on the morphological species concept, actually
includes multiple species, and that the re-defined novel
species, which are recognized mainly by mating types,
constitute the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex
[15-28]. The ML tree obtained in this study (Figure 6)
demonstrates convoluted, nested structures of species
within the Liseola section. The monophylies of F. subglutinans, F. proliferatum, and F. verticillioides, which have
been recognized by the traditional morphological species
concept, were not recovered. When we recognize species
based on the novel taxonomic system (see Table 2: species re-identified by molecular method), our ML tree
could not resolved the phylogenetic relationships among
re-identified species in the “Gibberella fujikuroi species
complex” excluding the sister relationship between
F. phylophilum and F. fujikuroi. This difficulty of resolving phylogenetic relationships in this complex is probably caused by rapid divergence events occurred in this
species complex. It is implied by the shortened internal
branches in this species complex in our ML tree.
Furthermore, our study detected an additional intermingled, nested structure as a species complex containing the F. avenaceum/F. tricinctum/F. lateritium clade
(clade VI in Figures 1 and 6). Regarding F. avenaceum,
the affinities with F. acuminatum have been suggested by
previous morphological and molecular studies [8,28].

Page 9 of 16

However, other molecular studies have suggested that F.
avenaceum is more closely related to F. tricinctum than
to F. acuminatum [29,30]. Moreover, the ML tree in this
study suggested the presence of a F. avenaceum/F. tricinctum/F. lateritium clade (Figure 6). The phylogenetic
hypothesis of a sister-species relationship between F. avenaceum and F. acuminatum was completely rejected by
our ML tree in Figure 6. Further studies with more
strains of each of the species within these complexes are
required for the clarification of taxonomic ambiguities.
Adaptive evolution of the lys2 gene within the Fusarium
genus

The topology of the lys2 tree was very different from
that of the other trees (Figure 1, 2, 3, 4 and Table 1),
and it indicated that the Fusarium genus is paraphyletic.
Interestingly, by further investigation using the branchsite model, we detected many branches which displayed
evidence of positive selection (The p value of the likelihood ratio test <0.001), indicated by bold branches in
our lys2 tree (Figure 4). Generally, the incongruence of
the species trees and the species trees were caused by
the following three reasons: (1) ancestral polymorphism
and incomplete lineage sorting, (2) gene duplication,
and (3) horizontal gene transfer. We briefly describe
these three hypotheses respectively as well as the difficulties of them in the following paragraphs.
In support of the first hypothesis, there was the polymorphism in the ancestral population of the Fusarium
genus and its related genera, and some alleles appeared
to have been positively selected, and finally fixed in each
lineage independently. However, we should assume that
the ancestral polymorphism may have been maintained
for a very long time, such as several hundred million
years. For the 18S rDNA gene, the average number of
nucleotide substitutions between Fusarium and M. nivale
is 17.0 and that between Fusarium and N. crassa is 30.9.
This is similar to the number of differences observed
between the human and chicken 18S rDNA genes (24
substitutions), and these lineages are thought to have
diverged approximately 320 million years ago [31]. In the
other hand, the average numbers of the nucleotide substitutions among Fusarium species is 1.9. The large difference among three genera and the small difference
within the Fusarium genus indicate that it had taken
long time until the emergence of the latest common
ancestor of the Fusarium genus after the split of three
genus.
The second hypothesis is that a gene duplication of
lys2 event may have occurred in the common ancestor
of the Fusarium genus and its related genera. Therefore,
the amino acid sequences of these groups could radically change. In each lineage, 1 copy may have been
positively selected, while the other may have become a

non-functional pseudogene which was eventually purged
from the genome. We found additional lys2 copies in
the genomes of F. oxysporum and Nectria haematococca
(anamorph; F. solani), but not in the genomes of F. verticillioides and Gibberella zeae (anamorph; F. graminearum), which were obtained from GenBank and the
Fusarium Comparative Database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/MultiHome.
html). We re-constructed the gene tree of lys2 with
sequences from this study and from GenBank (Figure 7).
The tree suggests that gene duplications may occur repetitively. However according to our analysis using the branch
model, the additional lys2 gene copies may still be subject
to purifying selection (data not shown). Therefore, it is
unlikely that 1 copy will be completely purged from the
genome in each lineage after the alternative copy has been
positively selected.
The third hypothesis is that horizontal gene transfer has
repeatedly occurred from the genome of 1 lineage to
another. Horizontal gene transfer in the fungal genome
has previously been observed among various fungal species
including F. oxysporum [11,32]. We can infer when and
where such events might have occurred during the evolutionary history of lys2 by comparing between the species
tree (Figure 6) and the gene tree (Figure 4). The first horizontal gene transfer appears to have occurred from N.
crassa (or M. nivale) to the Fusarium species in clade III.
A second horizontal gene transfer appears to have
occurred from clade III to clades I and V, respectively.
The hypothesis that repetitive gene transfer events have
occurred explains not only the positive selection but also
the distantly related phylogenetic positions between the
original lys2 gene and the additional lys2 copies found
only in F. oxysporum and N. haematococca (Figure 7).
However, the mechanism by which the new gene copy
completely replaced the original copy in the hosts remains
unclear.
Among these three hypotheses, the first hypothesis;
ancestral polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting,
is unlikely. As mentioned above, although other two

hypothesis can partially explain the incongruence of the
gene trees and positive selections of lys2, the difficulties
remain in all of the hypotheses. Hence, we cannot identify the reasons for them from our results.
The lys2 gene is fungus specific and is related to the
synthesis of lysine [15]. Our results indicate that this
gene has been subjected to positive selection within the
Fusarium genus. Therefore, the metabolism of lysine is
expected to be similar among the species within clades
I, III, and V and within clades II, IV, VI, and VII. However, this should be confirmed using biochemical experiments. An et al. [15,33] and Watanabe et al. [16] did
not report multiple copies of lys2 in the genomes of
fungal genera such as Aspergillus, Byssochlamys, Saccharomyces, and others excluding Fusarium. Therefore,
research and detection of other genera containing multiple copies of lys2 in their genomes is required to understand the diversity of lysine-metabolizing systems of
fungi. At the same time, we should note the difficulties
of the estimation of the ω ratios (the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site/the
number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous
site; dN/dS) in such a divergent taxon. The detection of
the positive selection based on the ω ratios is highly
sensitive to the saturation of the synonymous substituions. Since the relative evolutionary rate of the lys2 is
high among the genetic markers used in this study [34],
it is possible that the synonymous substitutions of lys2
were already saturated. However, the numbers of the
multiple synonymous substitution at the same synonymous sites (multiple hits) were well estimated by the
ML method using the codon substitution model, and
ML method effectively correct the effect of multiple hits
(Additional files 7 and 8). Moreover, w e applied the
strict criterion to evaluate the statistical significance
(p < 0.001) to completely exclude the possibility of the
overestimation of the detection for the positive selection.
Therefore, we could completely exclude the possibility
that some of the detected positive selections were falsepositive.

Figure 7 Maximum likelihood tree inferred from lys2. The GTR + I + Γ model was used as the model of nucleotide substitution. The
bootstrap probability (BP; 1000 replicated) values more than 75% are shown on the nodes. Branch lengths are proportional to the estimated
number of nucleotide substitutions. The lys2 sequences of Wisconsin 54-1255 Penicillium chrysogenum (XM_002564615), CBS513.88 Aspergillus
niger (XM_001401869), and RIB40 Aspergillus oryzae (XM_001820142) were used as outgroups. With the Fusarium dataset sequenced in this study,
the lys2 sequences of PH-1 Gibberella zeae, NRRL 34936 Fusarium oxysporum, NRRL 20956 Fusarium verticillioides, mpVI 77-13-4 Nectria
haematococca and Neurospora crassa were downloaded from the Fusarium Comparative Database, and also analysed. Data obtained from
GenBank or were downloaded from the Fusarium Comparative Database are denoted by an asterisk. The species which have additional lys2
copies in their genomes are indicated in red.

Further understanding of the evolutionary processes of
lys2 and other genes is very important. To date, the full
genome sequences of Fusarium are available for only 4
species of the Gibberella clade. The full genome
sequences from other clades of Fusarium may elucidate
the evolutionary processes of the genome, and such studies are currently in progress.

7 major clades containing Fusarium species. These
clades were supported with high BP values in all of the
phylogenetic trees based on single genes. Moreover, our
results indicate the considerable differences in the evolutionary histories of multiple genes in the lineage of
the Fusarium genus, particularly lys2.

Methods
Conclusion
This study reports the reliable phylogenetic tree of the
higher and lower taxonomy of the lineage of the Fusarium genus. Our ML tree clearly indicates that there are

Strains

The strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. We
selected 24 species from the genus Fusarium and its
related genera according to nomenclature system

Watanabe et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:322
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/322

proposed by Nelson et al. [8]. This nomenclature is
based on traditional species recognition methods. It is
very simple and systematized taxonomy, and is widespread application in the field of identification of Fusarium isolates. To cover a wide range of taxonomic
groups, we selected additional species referring molecular phylogenetic studies [35,36]. Each species includes
one to three strains, and we tested a total of 47 strains.
We further purified all Fusarium strains by the singlespore method [8].
DNA extraction

We used two subcultures of each Fusarium and Fusarium-related species obtained by the single-spore method
for sequencing. We checked their sequence identity
between two subcultures to confirm purity of the strain.
Samples were cultured on synthetic low nutrient agar
(SNA; [26]) slant media supplemented with chloramphenicol 100 mg/l) at 25°C for 14 days. Mycelia and conidia
from the slant culture were inoculated into 1 ml potato
dextrose broth (Difco Laboratories) in a microtube, and
were incubated at 25°C for 3 days. These fungal bodies
were clumped by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min
in a microtube. The genomic DNA was extracted from
these pellets using the SDS method with minor modifications, as previously described [37].
Amplification and sequencing of genes

The ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) cluster region, including
the 3’ end of the 18S rDNA, the internal transcribed
spacer region 1 (ITS1), the 5.8S rDNA, and the 5’ end of
the 28S rDNA, and the b-tub, EF-1a, and lys2 were
selected as the regions for analysis. We performed amplification reactions with the primer pair for each gene using
TaKaRa ExTaq (TaKaRa Bio Inc.), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR
System 9700; Applied Biosystems). The ITS1, 5.8S rDNA,
and 5’ end of the 28S rDNA were amplified in 1 fragment
using the primer pair, ITS5 (5’-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3’; [38])/NL4 (5’-GGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG-3’; [36]). For PCR amplification other than that
for ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, and 28S rDNA, we used the following primer pairs: FF1 (5’-GTTAAAAAGCTCGTAGTTGAAC-3’; [39])/FR1 (5’-CTCTCAATCTGTCAATCC
TTATT-3’; [39]) for 18S rDNA; Btu-F-F01 (5’-CAGACC
GGTCAGTGCGTAA-3’)/Btu-F-R01 (5’-TTGGGGTCG
AACATCTGCT-3’) for b-tub; EF-1 (5’-ATGGGTAAGGARGACAAGAC-3’; [40])/EF-2 (5’-GGARGTACCAGTSATCATGTT-3’; [40]) for EF-1a; and 2 primer pairs of
Fulys2-F03mix (5’-CTTTGTTGGTGATGTTCTSA-3’)/
Fulys2-R01 (5’-TGGTAGGTCCGATATCGGT-3’) and
Fulys2-F04mix (5’- GCYATGGGDCARATYCTKGT -3’)/
Fulys2-R04mix (5’-CGGYTCYTCRTTRCGRTCTCT-3’)
for lys2. The primer pairs for b-tub and lys2 were designed

Page 13 of 16

based on sequences derived from primers used in previous
studies, respectively [16,17]. They were designed to
amplify the genes effectively. The PCR program consisted
of an initial denaturing step at 94°C for 5 min, 35 amplification cycles, and an additional extending step at 72°C for
3 min. For the primer pairs FF1/FR1, ITS5/NL4, Fulys2F03mix/Fulys2-R01, and Fulys2-F04mix/Fulys2-R04mix,
the amplification cycles were 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 40 s,
and 72°C for 1 min and 10 s. For the primer pair Btu-FF01/Btu-F-R01, the amplification cycles were 94°C for
30 s, 60°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min. The PCR products
were purified using ExoSap-IT (USB; Cleveland, OH). Dye
labelling of the PCR products was performed with the
same primers which were used for each gene in the amplification reactions, using the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). For the PCR
products from ITS5/NL4, we used the additional primer
ITS3 (5’-GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC-3’; [38]). The
labelled PCR products were ethanol precipitated according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, and then directly
sequenced using the ABI 3130 analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sequences were assembled using ATGC software (Genetyx Corporation). The lys2 gene of strains CBS
169.30, CBS 638.76, MAFF 236504, MAFF238538, and
MAFF 239038, and the EF-1a gene of strains CBS 116205
and MAFF 236681 could not be amplified by PCR. The
sequences determined in this study have been deposited in
GenBank (accession nos. AA0000).
Phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences

The nucleotide sequence datasets for each gene (18S
rDNA, ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, 28S rDNA, b-tub, EF-1a, and
lys2) were automatically aligned using the MUSCULE program [41]. Alignments were carefully checked visually and
were manually modified; all ambiguous sections were
excluded from the analysis. All intron regions of b-tub and
lys2 were excluded, and we aligned only the exons. However, the introns for EF-1a comprised a relatively large
proportion of our sequence data for this gene (63.8%), and
these sections were retained for the analysis. We used
b-tub, EF-1a, and lys2 exon sequences from several Fusarium and its related genus species, including PH-1 Gibberella zeae, NRRL 34936 F. oxysporum, and NRRL 20956
F. verticillioides, as references for the alignments. These
sequences were downloaded from the Fusarium Comparative Database. The final lengths of the sequences are as
follows: rDNA cluster (1314 bp: 18S rDNA = 509 bp, ITS1
= 101 bp, 5.8S rDNA = 159 bp, and 28S rDNA = 545 bp),
b-tub (768 bp), EF-1a (804 bp), and lys2 (948 bp). Two
Eurotiomycetes species, Penicillium chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255 (GenBank accession nos. XM_002559715,
XM_002564615, and AM920418) and Aspergillus oryzae
RIB40 (GenBank accession nos. XM_001825624,
XM_001820142, and AP007172) were used as outgroups.

The Sordariomycetes species N. crassa OR74A (GenBank
accession nos. XM_952576, XM_960303 and FJ360521)
was also used in the analysis to examine the monophyly of
the Fusarium genus.
Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the ML
method. This method has the corrective effect of multiple hits. The RAxML program ver. 7.0.3 [42] was used
for the heuristic search.
Taking into account the different tempos and modes of
the nucleotide substitutions as described in Figure 5, we
separately estimated all parameters using the GTR + I + Γ
substitution model for each partition. The partitions were
as follows: rDNA region, ITS1 region, each codon site of
b-tub, each codon site of lys2, introns of EF-1a, and each
codon site of EF-1a. The branch lengths of each partition
were estimated separately with independent model (see
[43]). Since the RAxML program could not accurately estimate the branch lengths of b-tub by this method, we used
the default option for this gene. To determine the confidence for the internal nodes, the rapid bootstrap method
[42] was applied (1000 replications). The BASEML programs of PAML ver. 4.4 [44] were used for the exhaustive
search. The GTR + Γ model was used, and all parameters
of the substation model were separately estimated using
the same partitions as mentioned above. The branch
lengths were estimated using the proportional model [45].
To evaluate incongruence among the different gene trees,
we compared the log-likelihood scores and their standard
deviations by the Shimodaira-Hasegawa SH test [46],
using the BASEML program. As we only focused on the
relationships among major clades (seven clades of the
Fusarium genus, M. nivale and N. crassa), we swapped the
major clades of the ML trees for each gene one by one,
and then compared the different tree topologies.
We compared the observed substitutions among genes,
except for lys2, to evaluate the effects of saturation due
to multiple hits. Pairwise comparisons of the observed
number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions per site were calculated for all sequences of the 50
tested strains by Nei and Gojobori’s method [47], without
any correction, using MEGA ver. 5.0 software [48]. The
p-distances of the rDNA cluster and the EF-1a introns
were also calculated using MEGA ver. 5.0.
A c2 test was used to examine nucleotide and amino acid
composition bias in particular lineages using TREE-PUZZLE ver 5.2 [49]. Composition bias was tested with datasets
containing only the 3rd codon position sites, the combined
1st and 2nd codon position sites, and the combined 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd codon position sites and amino acids.
Detection of positive selection

Positive selection in particular lineages was detected by
the branch-site model [50] using the CODEML program
of PAML ver. 4.4. The statistical significance of positive

Page 14 of 16

selection was tested using likelihood ratio tests to compare the observed substitutions with the null hypothesis,
which assumed that the ratio of non-synonymous rates/
synonymous rates (ω) was equal to 1 [48].

The GTR + I + Γ model was used as the model of the nucleotide
substitution. The nodal numbers indicate the bootstrap probability (BP;
1000 replicated). The branch lengths are proportional to the estimated
number of nucleotide substitutions. The BP values more than 75% are
shown on the nodes. Although the RAxML program inferred the ML tree
of 28S rDNA including all 50 strains, it could not be summarized nodal
BPs. Therefore, all identical sequences were excluded and remaining 31
sequences were used for the estimation of nodal BPs.

method modified Nei-Gojorbori(JC) k = 2.5; panel B: ML method the
codon model (pairwise). The estimated synonymous substitution reached
plateau from the analysis by Nei Gojobori method. However there was
no such tendency from the analysis by the maximum likelihood method.
It means that although there were many multiple substitutions at the
synonymmous sites, the maximum likelihood effectively correct the
numbers of the multiple substitutions.
