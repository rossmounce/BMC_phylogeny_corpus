Diversification across an altitudinal gradient in
the Tiny Greenbul (Phyllastrephus debilis) from the
Eastern Arc Mountains of Africa
Jérôme Fuchs1,2,4*, Jon Fjeldså3 and Rauri CK Bowie1,2

Abstract
Background: The Eastern Arc Mountains of Africa have become one of the focal systems with which to explore
the patterns and mechanisms of diversification among montane species and populations. One unresolved question
is the extent to which populations inhabiting montane forest interact with those of adjacent lowland forest
abutting the coast of eastern Africa. The Tiny Greenbul (Phyllastephus debilis) represents the only described bird
species within the Eastern Arc/coastal forest mosaic, which is polytypic across an altitudinal gradient: the
subspecies albigula (green head) is distributed in the montane Usambara and Nguru Mountains whereas the
subspecies rabai (grey head) is found in Tanzanian lowland and foothill forest. Using a combination of
morphological and genetic data, we aim to establish if the pattern of morphological differentiation in the Tiny
Greenbul (Phyllastrephus debilis) is the result of disruptive selection along an altitudinal gradient or a consequence
of secondary contact following population expansion of two differentiated lineages.
Results: We found significant biometric differences between the lowland (rabai) and montane (albigula)
populations in Tanzania. The differences in shape are coupled with discrete differences in the coloration of the
underparts. Using multi-locus data gathered from 124 individuals, we show that lowland and montane birds form
two distinct genetic lineages. The divergence between the two forms occurred between 2.4 and 3.1 Myrs ago.
Our coalescent analyses suggest that limited gene flow, mostly from the subspecies rabai to albigula, is taking
place at three mid-altitude localities, where lowland and montane rainforest directly abut. The extent of this
introgression appears to be limited and is likely a consequence of the recent expansion of rabai further inland.
Conclusion: The clear altitudinal segregation in morphology found within the Tiny Greenbul is the result of
secondary contact of two highly differentiated lineages rather than disruptive selection in plumage pattern across
an altitudinal gradient. Based on our results, we recommend albigula be elevated to species rank.

Background
The Eastern Arc and coastal forests of East Africa have
been identified as a biodiversity hotspot: an area featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and
experiencing severe habitat loss [1]. The extensive botanical endemism and richness is paralleled in several animal groups [2] and has been especially well documented
for birds [3,4]. The Eastern Arc Mountains consists of
13 sky islands, which form a chain (ca. 650 km long) of

uplifted fault blocks extending from the Taita Hills in
the northeast to the Udzungwa Mountains in the southwest (Figure 1). These mountains are under direct climatic influence from the Indian Ocean and reach an
altitude of 2635 m (Uluguru Mts) [5]. Typically montane
forest occurs above 800 m, but there is no sharp change
in turnover of arboreal species, and the composition of
the botanical communities depend on the inclination of
the terrain, rainfall, distance from the coast, height and
incidence of cloud cover [2,6,7]. At lower elevations
(500-800 m), the eastern slopes typically sharply grade
into savanna or lowland rainforest characteristic of the
coastal forests of the littoral plain of Africa that runs
from Somalia to Mozambique. The drier western and

northwestern slopes typically support deciduous woodland at lower elevations.
Extensive field research within the Eastern Arc has
taken place over the past 15 years which has led to the
description of several new species and the development
of novel hypotheses concerning patterns of differentiation among species and populations distributed in East
Africa [4,8,9]. Despite this accumulating body of knowledge, it still remains to be determined to what extent
populations inhabiting montane forest interact with
populations distributed in adjacent foothills and along a
narrow ribbon of lowland forest abutting the coast of
eastern Africa [e.g. [10,11]].
The Tiny Greenbul (Phyllastephus debilis) represents
the only described bird species within the Eastern Arc/
coastal forest mosaic, which is polytypic across an

altitudinal gradient (clinal variation is also well documented for some frogs, [12]). The more common pattern is for polytypic taxa to be distributed as a series of
allopatric populations restricted to specific sky islands.
Three subspecies are currently recognized [13]: albigula
in the Usambara Mountains (Mts) as well as in the
Nguru Mts 130 km further inland (Tanzania, Figure 1),
debilis in the coastal forest zone of southeastern Tanzania, Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe, and rabai
which extends from near Dares Salaam (Tanzania) north
along the coast into Kenya, and inland along riverine
corridors to the foothill forests od the the Uluguru,
Nguu and Nguru Mts (Figure 1). Subspecies albigula is
the most distinctive form, the top of the head being
green and not grey as in debilis and rabai. Unlike the
other forms albigula is only found above 600 m, mainly

Fuchs et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:117

in mature forest, and extends up to 1600 m in the
Nguru Mts [14] and to 2150 m in the West Usambara
Mts. This suggests that the green-headed montane birds
represent two separate populations (Usambara Mts,
Nguru Mts; Figure 1) nested inside the geographical
range of a more widespread lowland, grey-headed, form.
We therefore have to consider the possibility that two
ecologically segregated species are involved. However,
the existence of some greenish feather edges on the
nape and crown of some lowland birds could lead to the
alternate interpretation that although gene flow occurs,
plumage is under directional selection, with greener plumage being favored in the wetter high-altitude habitats.
Whether disruptive selection across an altitudinal gradient can lead to parapatric speciation is hotly debated,
as it requires natural selection to be sufficiently strong
to counteract the effects of gene flow [e.g. [15-17]].
Although several studies have provided evidence of the
importance of natural selection for the formation of new
species even when gene flow occurs [18], research that
connects presumably adaptive variation in traits (plumage in our case) with assessments of the phylogenetic
relationships among populations/taxa, extent of genetic
variation and gene flow are relatively few [19]. Thus, a
careful analysis of morphological variation and phylogeographic structure within the Tiny Greenbul is likely
to provide further insight to this debate. We contend
that if populations from the same habitat (lowland or
montane) are genetically and morphologically more closely related to each other than to population from the
other habitat, we would expect historical isolation and
secondary contact between the lowland and montane
populations to be the prevailing hypothesis for the current contact zone. In contrast, if disruptive selection has
played a major role in driving phenotypic divergence
across the altitudinal gradient, then the two populations
of the montane form (Nguru and Usambara Mts) should
be phenotypically more similar despite being genetically
closer to their nearest geographically lowland forest
population. In this paper we make use of a multi-locus
approach to test the above hypotheses.

Results
Morphological variation

Birds from the lowland coastal forests of East Africa (n
= 49), subspecies rabai, are generally small (Male:
weight 14.2 ± 0.57 g, wing 68.3 ± 2.4 mm, bill 13.7 ±
0.82 mm, tail 64.0 ± 2.7 mm, tarsus 17.1 ± 0.94; Female:
weight 14.4 ± 0.48 g, wing 66.1 ± 3.1 mm, bill 13.5 ±
0.74 mm, tail 61.1 ± 3.7 mm, tarsus 17.7 ± 0.69) with a
mouse grey crown, pale grey underparts with bright yellow streaks (Picric Yellow lateral feather edges) contrasting with a very pale grey throat and extensive pale
yellow belly. This description also applies to birds from

Page 3 of 17

Mt. Kanga (n = 6), the Nguu Mts (n = 2) and the Uluguru foothills (n = 10; see Figure 1).
Specimens of the montane subspecies albigula from
the Usambara (n = 6) and Nguru Mts (n = 11) are generally large (Male: weight 17.8 ± 1.4 g, wing 73.5 ± 3.4
mm, bill 14.8 ± 0.57 mm, tail 69.9 ± 2.1 mm, tarsus
19.0 ± 0.43; Female: weight 15.3 ± 0.84 g, wing 70.7 ±
1.8 mm, bill 14.0 ± 0.86 mm, tail 66.8 ± 3.3 mm, tarsus
18.0 ± 0.47). Birds of both sexes from the two montane
populations of albigula do not differ significantly from
each other in any measured morphometric trait (t-test:
Male P = 0.15-0.61, Female P = 0.56-0.97), but do differ
from lowland birds, with lowland birds being significantly smaller (rabai vs. albigula, t-test: Male all P <
0.01, Female weight P = 0.94, wing P = 0.23, bill P =
0.29, tail P = 0.04, tarsus P = 0.47).
The first two principal components (PCs) had eigenvalues greater than one and accounted for 77.2% of the
total variation (Factor 1 45.5%, Factor 2 31.7%). Principal component loadings on PC1 were positive and
strongly correlated with weight. Loadings on PC2 were
positive and strongly correlated with wing- and taillength; bill- and tarsus-length loaded evenly on both
PC1 and PC2. In agreement with the bivariate results
above, the scatterplot (Additional File 1) suggests that
montane populations of debilis (albigula) are separable
from lowland populations (rabai) in morphospace, particularly along PC1 (weight and tarsus-length, i.e. indicators of size).
In plumage characters, the dark olive-green color of
the back of albigula extends to the crown or even upper
forehead. However, in some individuals the crown feathers are grey with green lateral edges, giving a streaked
appearance. The birds have a distinctive dark grey breast
and flanks (Gull Grey to Plumbeous Grey, grading to
Deep Grape Green on the upper sides) and even the
throat and chin are rather grey (Pale Gull Grey, somewhat mottled) leaving only a narrow area on the central
belly white. Yellow streaks are variably developed but
generally weak and there is always a bright yellow axillary patch which, together with the yellow wing-lining,
stands out conspicuously. Thus, the most prominent
plumage difference between the rabai and albigula specimens is in the color of the underparts rather than the
crown as traditionally described.
One bird from Mt. Kanga collected at 900 m
(ZMUC101292, tissue no. 132719), a locality within the
range of lowland rabai, resembles individuals from the
adjacent Nguru Mts (albigula) in plumage and size
(Male: weight 14.5 g, wing 76 mm, tail 71 mm). The
ZMUC specimen (74473) from Lindi (southern Tanzanian coast, subspecies debilis) we sequenced in this
study resembled specimens from lowland populations
further north on the Tanzanian coast (rabai) in both

Fuchs et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:117

plumage and size (Male: wing 67 mm, bill 13.7 mm, tail
59 mm, tarsus 17.2 mm). Only one specimen from Zimbabwe (debilis) could be compared directly with Tanzanian specimens, and differs from the Lindi specimen
and most of the other rabai specimens only in having a
faint greenish tinge on the crown. The description in
Keith et al. [20] suggests that plumage and size differences between rabai and debilis are slight.
In conclusion, there exist significant biometric differences between the lowland (rabai) and montane (albigula) populations in Tanzania (our sample size for
debilis was too small to allow for a meaningful comparison among lowland taxa). The differences in shape are
also coupled with discrete differences in the color of the
underparts.
Genetic analyses: geographic structure
Mitochondrial data

We obtained the complete ND2 sequence (1041 bp) for
110 individuals. For some museum samples, we were
only able to gather partial sequences. These partial
sequences were very similar to the corresponding fragments obtained from individuals collected at the same
locality; however, we did not include individuals with
partial sequences in our final analyses. All sequences
had an open reading frame, with no insertions, deletions
or unexpected stop codons.
Within P. debilis, 170 sites were variable, delineating
43 haplotypes (Hd = 0.948, π = 0.05776). Results of the
MacDonald-Kreitman test when comparing the P.
debilis (n = 110) sequences with two of its closest relatives indicate no consistent evidence of selection (P.
hypochloris P = 0.18; P. xavieri P = 0.04), although one
comparison is marginally significant. We attribute this
to homoplasy as a result of the long divergence time
between P. debilis and its closest relatives. Further, comparing the two primary clades (albigula versus debilis/
rabai see below) with each other indicated that no
selection is acting on the mtDNA locus within P. debilis
(P = 0.85).
Both the maximum likelihood (-ln = 3400.03) and
Bayesian inference (harmonic mean -ln = 3714.18) analyses, performed using a HKY+Γ model, recovered two
primary clades (net sequence divergence 9.6%); one
clade includes birds collected in the lowland forests of
Tanzania (rabai) and Mozambique/Zimbabwe (debilis)
and the other in the montane forests of Tanzania (albigula) (Figure 2 and summary statistics in Table 1). Birds
from the lowland forests are further subdivided into two
clades, one restricted to Tanzania and one distributed in
Mozambique/Zimbabwe (net sequence divergence:
3.9%). We only found three mismatches between subspecies designation and our assignment of individuals to
a particular clade. The three SE Tanzanian individuals

Page 4 of 17

we sampled (Lindi, Litipo and Pindiro Forests, Figures 1
and 2), which according to the accepted taxonomy,
should be associated with the Mozambique/Zimbabwe
lowland populations (debilis), were placed together with
the more northerly Tanzanian lowland populations
(rabai). In all subsequent analyses, we considered the
individuals sampled in Lindi, Litipo and Pindiro Forests
as being part of the subspecies rabai and different from
the subspecies debilis, which we considered restricted to
Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
Greater genetic diversity was observed in the Tanzanian lowland clade (rabai) than in the montane clade
(albigula) (Table 1, Figure 2). The Mozambique/Zimbabwe clade is further divided into two subclades (Zimbabwe versus coastal Mozambique forests) that differ
from each other by a minimum of nine substitutions.
One individual, collected in Vimba (Zimbabwe,
DM29199), possesses a mtDNA haplotype that is nested
within the Mozambique subclade (Beira/Mapinhane).
The three primary clades (montane, lowland Tanzania
and Mozambique/Zimbabwe) could not be connected at
the 95% level in the TCS haplotype network (Figure 2).
Samples from the two isolated mountains where albigula occurs were segregated genetically; haplotypes from
the Nguru and Usambara Mts were reciprocally monophyletic in the ML tree (bootstrap: 70% and 87%,
respectively) and TCS network, but not in the 50%
majority rule consensus tree resulting from the Bayesian
analyses, where the Nguru haplotypes were paraphyletic
with respect to the Usambara haplotypes (Figure 2).
We only found evidence for isolation by distance in
the Tanzanian clade (rabai) (Mantel’s test, r = 0.173, P
= 0.019).
Autosomal intron data

The HKA test did not detect any evidence of selection
between the two autosomal data sets (FIB vs. GAPDH:
c2 = 0.429, P = 0.51), nor between the autosomal and
sex-linked locus (GAPDH vs. BRM: c 2 = 0.181, P =
0.67; FGB vs. BRM: c2 = 0.375, P = 0.54). These results
indicate that none of the nuclear introns we sequenced
are under selection, or that the selection regime does
not differ among them. Selection on introns has recently
been highlighted for birds in one locus often used in
phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies [21,22], but
even in such rare cases, selective appears to only act on
a very few sites (e.g. 2.2% in mammals [23]).
FGB

We obtained the complete FGB intron-5 sequence for
98 individuals (559 bp, 25 SNPs). The allelic phase of
six individuals (debilis: DM29193; rabai: ZMUC117618,
ZMUC119477, ZMUC121068, ZMUC132719, ZMUC13
2720) could not be resolved at the 0.75 PP threshold,
even when we incorporated partial sequences from
museum specimens. These six individuals were excluded

from further analyses; this resulted in the loss of eight
SNPs, all only present in one out of 196 possible
copies).
In the final data set, sixteen alleles were found in the
lowland group and three in the montane group. Sharing
of haplotypes between the lowland and montane population was very limited, involving only one individual:

rabai ZMUC134311 from Mt. Kanga, with one allele
assigned to albigula (Additional File 2)- morphologically
this is a typical rabai specimen. One further bird from
Mt. Kanga (ZMUC132719) resembles albigula in morphology but shared SNPs with both albigula and rabai
(note that one autapomoprhic SNP could not be phased
and this individual was thus excluded). The alleles

In the absence of selection, significant negative values of Fu’s Fs and low values of R2 are indicative of population expansion (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). For the three
nuclear loci, only alleles with phase probabilities greater than 0.75 were included in the analyses. The subspecies rabai includes all individuals from lowland
Tanzania (including the three specimens from SE Tanzania, whereas subspecies debilis only includes individuals from Mozambique and Zimbabwe, see text for
details).

within the lowland group (Mozambique/Zimbabwe
debilis and Tanzania rabai) were inter-mixed. The
results of the AMOVA indicated significant structuring
of the genetic variability when partitioning by subspecies
(df = 183, jst = 0.79, P < 0.001), with most of the molecular variability being found among the three subspecies
(among: 78.9%, within: 21.1%).
GAPDH

We obtained the complete GAPDH intron-11 sequence
for 113 individuals (328 bp, 21 SNPs). One individual
(ZMUC137398) had a three base pair deletion and
another (ZMUC137531) had a single base pair insertion.
We considered the three base pair deletion to be a single mutational event. Eight individuals (albigula:
ZMUC132956, ZMUC132939, ZMUC132860; rabai:

ZMUC117617, ZMUC119477, ZMUC120028, ZMUC
121087, ZMUC121069) could not be phased at the
threshold PP of 0.75 and were excluded from further
analyses (four SNPs were only found in one out of the
226 copies, one SNP was present in two copies but only
shared between two excluded individuals). We also
excluded the individual which had the autapomorphic
deletion of three base pairs due to difficulty in determining the allelic phase. Most of the alleles were shared
among the different subspecies (Additional File 2). Yet,
the AMOVA indicated significant structuring of genetic
variability when partitioned by subspecies (df = 207, jst
= 0.32, P < 0.001), with most of the molecular variability
being found within the three subspecies (among: 32.2%,
within: 67.8%).

We obtained complete BRM intron-15 sequences from
104 individuals (66 males, 37 females, 1 unknown; 364

individuals, 68 males, 37 females and 1 unknown, which
we considered a female) after excluding the single individual (rabai: ZMUC132703) that could not be satisfactorily phased. No alleles were shared between albigula and
debilis/rabai (Additional File 2). AMOVA indicated significant structuring of genetic variability when the dataset
was partitioned by subspecies (df = 167, jst = 0.699, P <
0.001), with most of the molecular variability being found
among the three groups (among: 69.9%, within: 30.1%).
STRUCTURE analysis of the nuclear data set

STRUCTURE analyses performed on the nuclear data
set, revealed two primary genotype clusters (-ln P(D) =
595.9, K = 2), corresponding to the lowland (debilis and
rabai) and montane (albigula) mtDNA clades (Figure 3).
Five intermediate genotypes, with the lowest probability
assignment to one or other clade varying from 0.19 to
0.40, were sampled from the East Usambara Mts
(ZMUC1200079 and 120135), Nguru Mts (ZMUC132600
and 137531), and on Mt. Kanga (ZMUC134311). All the
other individuals were assigned to either the montane or
lowland clades with a posterior probability greater than
0.90. At K = 3, the lowland group is divided in two populations with all individuals being of mixed ancestry
(assignment probability to population 2 and 3 between
0.40 and 0.60, Additional File 3). At K = 4, the pattern is
very similar to the one observed at K = 2 and K = 3, but
the montane group is now considered to be an admixture
of two populations, which roughly correspond to the
Nguru and Usambara populations.
Multi-locus network and species tree analyses

The multi-locus network derived from the combined
analyses of the mitochondrial and nuclear loci recovered:

Page 7 of 17

1) a clear separation of the montane (albigula) and lowland (debilis and rabai) clades, and 2) a greater extent of
genetic diversity within the lowland clade relative to the
montane clade (Figure 4).
The topology we obtained from the species tree analyses based on the coalescent approach (*BEAST) and
information from the mitochondrial and nuclear loci
recovered a pattern where the lowland subspecies
(debilis and rabai) are sister to the montane subspecies
(albigula), although support for the monophyly of the
lowland group is limited (PP = 0.56).
The analyses performed using the species delimitation
rjMCMC algorithm implemented in BPP V2.0 and a (albigula, (debilis, rabai)) guide tree indicates that all models
visited support at least two lineages: albigula and debilis/
rabai (PP = 1.0); this result was not dependent on the
assumption of a large or small effective population size or
a shallow or deep divergence as all prior combinations
resulted in the same posterior probability. A speciation
probability greater than 0.95 was recovered for the node
leading to debilis and rabai in three of the four prior combinations; the prior combination of small effective population size and deep divergence resulted in a speciation
probability of 0.76 for debilis and rabai.
Genetic analyses: divergence time estimates

Divergence date estimates using the mitochondrial neutral mutation rate of the four-fold degenerated sites
were quite variable (Table 2): from a 0.15 myrs (95%
HPD: 0.02-0.5 myrs) estimate for the TMRCA of debilis
to 3.1 myrs (95% HPD: 1.2-7.7 myrs) for the divergence
between the lowland (debilis/rabai) and montane clades
(albigula). The divergence between the lowland lineages
in Tanzania (rabai) and Mozambique/Zimbabwe
(debilis) is estimated to have occurred about 1.1 myrs
ago (95% HPD: 0.3-2.3 myrs). The estimates obtained
using a strict molecular clock hypothesis and the 6.1%/
myr-1 rate were very similar to the dates obtained using

Figure 3 Assignment of individuals to genetic cluster using the STRUCTURE algorithm for K = 2 (mean LogLikelihood across three
runs, -ln = 595.9). The red color corresponds to the individuals sampled in the Nguru and Usambara Mts (albigula). Green corresponds to
individuals sampled in the Tanzanian lowland (rabai) and Mozambique/Zimbabwe (debilis). Evidence for admixture involves five individuals
sampled in the Nguru Mts, Usambara Mts and on Mt Kanga.

the neutral four-fold mutation rate and the 95% HPD
were largely overlapping. In contrast, the divergence
times obtained using the traditional 2.1%/myr -1 clock
were much older with only slight overlap with the 95%
HPD obtained with the other rates (Table 2).
Genetic analyses: fluctuation in population size

We found evidence of population expansion in the
mitochondrial data set for the Tanzanian lowland rabai
(Fu’s Fs = -3.976, P = 0.01, Table 1), although the R 2
test was not significant (R2 = 0.0742, P = 0.10). Likewise,
several significant Fu’s Fs or R2 values were found for
the nuclear data (e.g. GAPDH for rabai; Fs = -8.485, p
< 0.01, R 2 = 0.0596, p = NS, FGB for albigula Fs =
-3.527, p < 0.05/R2 = 0.0466, p < 0.05). We observed
several cases of discrepancies between the two tests,
which may be due to differences in power [24]. Given
our sampling of haplotypes (sample size greater than 40
in most cases), it is likely that Fu’s Fs will have more
power to detect population growth than R2 [24]. Finally

sets and the number of segregating sites per locus

the analyses.

(Table 1), it is very likely that the demographic expansions, when present, were moderate and not sudden
[24]. The Bayesian Skyline Plot of the mitochondrial
data set for the subspecies rabai also supports a population expansion, a three-fold increase in effective population, but the increase was continuous and not sudden
(Additional File 4). The Bayesian Skyline Plot for the
subspecies albigula did not show any evidence of population expansion (Additional File 4).
Genetic analyses: Coalescent analyses under the Isolation
with Migration model

The SBP and GARD algorithms did not detect any evidence of recombination in the three nuclear loci. Hence
we used the complete sequence for the IMa analyses.
Appropriate mixing and satisfactory effective sampled
sizes were achieved using 12 chains and a geometric
heating scheme (g1 = 0.15 and g2 = 0.70) for all parameters except T (time of population divergence; Table
3), where a non-zero probability tail was observed.
Hence, for T, we considered the highest point of the
posterior distribution to be the most reliable estimate.
For the comparison between the montane populations
of albigula from the Usambara and Nguru Mts, some
models that assume no gene flow could not be rejected
(2LLR = 6.7102, df = 3, ns).
For the comparison between the Tanzanian lowland
and montane clades (rabai versus albigula), all models
that assume no gene flow and asymmetrical gene flow,
and all models that assume equal effective population
sizes in the two extant lineages were strongly rejected
(all P < 0.001). To determine if gene flow between rabai
and albigula was primarily occurring on Mt. Kanga as
suggested by the STRUCTURE assignments and morphological data, we conducted a separate IMa analysis
with the individuals from Mt. Kanga excluded. With

Fuchs et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:117
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/117

birds from Mt. Kanga excluded we could no longer
reject zero gene flow taking place between rabai and
albigula (with birds from Kanga 2LLR = 32.6935, df = 2,
P < 0.001; without birds from Kanga 2LLR = 4.0783, df
= 2, ns). This result is consistent with secondary contact
and apparent introgression occurring at mid-altitude on
Mt. Kanga.
For the comparison between the lowland populations
from Mozambique/Zimbabwe (debilis) and Tanzania
(rabai), models that assume equal population sizes (both
present and past) were all rejected (least significant pvalue, 2LLR = 4.5165, df = 1, P = 0.03). Models that
assume no gene flow were all rejected, although one was
only marginally rejected (2LLR = 8.8385, df = 3, p =
0.03). Hence, we are unable to decisively exclude the
possibility that zero gene flow is occurring between
Mozambique/Zimbabwe and the Tanzanian lowland
populations.
The coalescent analyses between the Tanzanian montane clade (albigula) and the Mozambique/Zimbabwe
lowland clade (debilis) was not performed because one
of the IMa assumptions, that is, no gene flow is occurring with an unsampled lineage (geographically intermediate rabai in our case), was not satisfied.
The highest posterior estimate for the divergence
times between populations pairs were very similar or
identical to the TMRCA we obtained using the mitochondrial data set and the neutral four-fold and 6.1%/
Myr-1 rate (Tables 2 and 3).
Bioclimatic data

The Principal Component Analysis performed on the
bioclimatic data revealed that the lowland (debilis/rabai)
and montane (albigula) localities could primarily be
separated by the level of seasonality. The first two axes
explain 92.7% of the variability (PCA Axis 1: 64.3%,
PCA Axis 2: 28.4%). Sites from the Usambara Mts
appear to be very heterogeneous in their distribution
(Figure 5). All sites where gene flow was detected
between albigula and rabai are in geographical

Page 9 of 17

proximity to each other (on the altitudinal gradient) and
appear to have reduced seasonality, suggesting that this
climatic variable may provide a key environmental context under which gene flow among the two lineages may
take place.

Discussion
Secondary contact versus disruptive selection on an
altitudinal gradient?

Birds from the montane forests of the Nguru and Usambara Mts (albigula) represent a distinct clade in the
molecular analysis and are also readily distinguishable
by their grey underparts. In addition, albigula is generally larger and individuals tend to have a green rather
than grey crown, the later being more characteristic of
lowland birds (rabai and debilis), although some rabai
individuals do have some greenish streaks on the nape
and crown. Birds of the rabai clade are found in foothill
forests at a few hundred meters elevation in the East
Usambara Mts, in the Tanzanian coastal lowlands, as
well as on Mt. Kanga (common to 900 m), which rises
steeply from the lowlands and is only 10 km to the east
of the Nguru Mts, where albigula occurs (Figure 1).
Our STRUCTURE analyses revealed that gene flow or
introgression has occurred at three localities: on Mt.
Kanga, in the foothills forests of the East Usambara Mts
(Amani and Mazumbai) and in the Nguru Mts. However, Mt. Kanga is at present the only locality where we
have sampled an individual with a genotype/phenotype
mismatch and excluding individuals from this locality
from the Isolation with Migration analyses had strong
impact on the conclusion concerning gene flow between
albigula and rabai.
In the Nguu Mts to the north of the Nguru Mts but
partly connected by several small hills, rabai is found up
to 1000 m in Kilindi Forest and to 1550 m in Derema
Forest. This results in the montane Nguru population of
albigula being surrounded to both the north and east by
the predominantly lowland rabai. Thus, it appears that
rabai is able to ascend into the submontane zone,

Figure 5 Biplot of the first two components of the bioclimatic variables extracted from our sampling locality co-ordinates. Note the
rather disparate environmental conditions for the albigula sampling points. All sites where gene flow was recorded (e.g. Mt. Kanga) are
characterized by reduced seasonality (variable 4).

except where this habitat is already occupied by albigula, which suggests that two mutually exclusive and
competing taxa may be involved. It is noteworthy that
birds representing the two clades can be found in close
proximity to each other. We found some evidence of
population expansion for rabai (ND2; Fu’s Fs = -3.976,
P = 0.01, GAPDH: Fu’s Fs = -8.485, P = 0.01), suggesting that the current contact between the two taxa (Mt.
Kanga, foothill forest in the East Usambara Mts) may be
secondary, centered in areas of transitional habitat with
low seasonality between montane and lowland forest
and not the result of disruptive selection on an altitudinal gradient. The secondary contact zone hypothesis
between once allopatric populations has also been
favored by several other studies that have addressed this
topic [e.g. [16,25]].
Our coalescent analyses under the Isolation with
Migration model did allow us to reject the hypothesis of
zero gene flow between the lowland (rabai) and highland (albigula) populations. Yet, when individuals from

Mt. Kanga were excluded from the analyses, the hypothesis of zero gene flow could no longer be rejected. This
pattern suggests that limited gene flow between albigula
and rabai takes place on Mt. Kanga. Given that the lowland population likely experienced a demographic
expansion, it is likely that Mt. Kanga represents a zone
of secondary contact and not the initial area where the
two species diverged. Consequently, recurrent gene flow
appears to be restricted in space to areas of intermediate
habitat. The Isolation with Migration model implemented in IMa has several assumptions that may be violated
in empirical data sets, including: no intralocus recombination, no gene flow with an unsampled species/population, no linkage among loci, no selection and no
population structure in the ancestral population. Here,
we can reasonably reject recombination, selection and
linkage among the sampled loci as potential biases.
Gene flow with an unsampled species is unlikely, as the
Tiny Greenbul has no close extant relatives [26]. Ancestral population structure is thought to have little effect

Fuchs et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:117
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/117

on parameters estimates [27]. It has been shown
through simulation study that using an over-simplified
substitution model increases the variance in some parameter estimates [27]. The most complex substitution
model implemented in IMa is HKY, which is very close
to the best-fit model selected for our data set (HKY+Γ).
Thus, we consider our estimates obtained with the Isolation with Migration model to not be strongly affected by
currently described biases.
Given that the two lineages are well differentiated
genetically and morphologically, we do not regard limited gene flow at 1-3 localities of intermediate habitat as
a sufficient reason to reject species rank for the montane clade. Indeed, hybridization and introgression
between ‘good species’ is common, especially for neutral
loci and does not preclude them from being genetically
distinct. (e.g. [28,29]). Hence, based on the molecular,
morphological and altitudinal distribution patterns, we
suggest that the taxa albigula and debilis (including
rabai) be considered distinct species.
Genetic structure among the highlands

The Nguru and Usambara Mts are separated by a substantial 100-160 km lowland gap of dry savannah. As
these two sky islands hold the only two populations of
albigula, it is important to know if gene flow is occurring between the two populations. Our coalescent-based
analyses could not exclude the hypothesis of zero gene
flow between the two populations. Our result is consistent with phylogeographic studies of other Eastern Arc
Mountain birds where the Usambara-Nguru gap has
consistently been recovered as the major phylogeographic break among clades [e.g. [4,8,30,31]].
In contrast to the pattern of strong genetic structuring
in birds, and several other vertebrates [32,33], weak
genetic differentiation (0.2%) was found between two
populations of a frog, Arthroleptis xenodactylus, from
the Usambara and Nguru Mts [34]. These results are
not easy to compare as these organisms have different
dispersal capacities, yet it is surprising that several montane bird lineages appear to be more geographically
structured than the single frog study published to date.
However, one striking pattern among all of the above
studies remains that, vertebrate populations from the
northern (Pare, Usambara Mts) and central mountains
(Nguru, Ukaguru, Rubeho Mts) are genetically differentiated from each other across the Usambara-Nguru lowland gap. Yet, only a few of the estimated divergence
times (TMRCA for albigula 0.4 mya, 95% HPD: 0.1-0.9
mya) are compatible with each other, suggesting several
periods where gene flow was interrupted among species
from the same community. Hence, whereas the Pleistocene climatic oscillations likely constrained the distribution of mountain birds in the Eastern Arc due to

Page 11 of 17

aridification, the response of individual species to these
climatic fluctuations appears to have been varied, suggesting that a model assuming a single ‘common’ vicariant event is unlikely [4,34].
Genetic structure in the Tanzanian lowland (rabai spp)

Birds from Lindi District, located on the coast in SE
Tanzania are more closely related to the northern Tanzanian-Kenyan lowland populations, than to the central
Mozambique and Zimbabwe populations, as traditionally
thought. The coastal zone of northern Mozambique is
fairly dry, and there may be a significant gap in the distribution of this species. Recent surveys (2009) in NE
Mozambique did not detect the species (J. Fuchs and JM Pons, unpubl.)
Our analyses revealed substantial genetic structure and
genetic diversity in the lowland clade, as inferred from
the mean genetic distance among haplotypes and
nucleotide diversity. Part of this genetic diversity may be
explained by isolation-by-distance. Yet, we also observed
substantial mitochondrial differentiation within some
localities (e.g. on Mt. Kanga, Pugu and Nkubege Forests). This would either imply that the distribution of
the lowland forest population has remained stable and
large for a considerable period of time, or that these
localities represent areas of secondary contact after
population expansion from different lowland refugia.
There is evidence in our data set for a signature of
population expansion in the rabai clade, with individuals sampled from inland localities (Morogoro District,
Kidugallo, Kingolwira, Nguu) primarily having haplotypes shared or derived from coastal populations. This
pattern would be consistent with constant and large
population size through time (and thus high genetic
diversity) in coastal forests and a signature of population
expansion towards the interior. The validation of this
hypothesis would require further sampling from within
the distributional range of rabai, which is challenging
due to many coastal forests having been transformed by
humans.
Patterns of genetic differentiation in Mozambique/
Zimbabwe (debilis ssp)

Our analyses indicate that populations from Mozambique/Zimbabwe are genetically differentiated from the
lowland populations in Tanzania (Figure 2). Dating analyses using the mitochondrial data set indicate that the
two lineages (debils vs. rabai) diverged about 1 mya,
using the neutral four-fold rate and 6%/myr clocks, or
2.8 mya using the more conventional 2%/myr mitochondrial clock. The divergence time obtained using the
four-fold degenerated rate and 6%/myr rate corresponds
to a peak of aridification in Africa, a consequence of glaciation at higher latitudes [35,36]. This aridification

Fuchs et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:117
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/117

peak, together with the general drying of Africa since
the Miocene, may have altered the distribution of
coastal lowland forest in northern Mozambique, thus
promoting the divergence between the Mozambique/
Zimbabwe and Tanzanian clades of Tiny Greenbul.
The pattern of disjunct populations distributed in lowland Tanzania and Zimbabwe/Mozambique has been
observed for some other vertebrate species, although
Zimbabwe is often not sampled for species associated
with densely wooded habitats. Moodley and Bruford
[37] found some differentiation of populations of Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) in this region, with diverged
about 200 000 years ago.
Our analyses revealed the existence of two well-differentiated mitochondrial lineages within the Mozambique/
Zimbabwe clade. The first clade consists of individuals
collected in Mozambique (Beira/Mapinhane) and Zimbabwe (DM29199, Vimba). The second clade only
includes individuals collected in Zimbabwe (Vimba).
Thus, that one individual from Vimba (DM29199) has a
mitochondrial haplotype characteristic of the Mozambique clade is intriguing, especially since the two mitochondrial lineages are rather divergent. Through several
checks in the laboratory and because the collector visited Vimba five years later than central Mozambique
(Dondo Beira), we can rule out sample mix-up or contamination. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is
recent gene flow from central Mozambique to Vimba.
This result also supports the fact that seasonality of the
sites may play an important role in facilitating gene
flow, as Vimba is the site with the lowest seasonality.
We emphasise that further sampling in this area is
needed to confirm this result.

Conclusions
Our study suggests that the single case of altitudinal
morphological segregation within a species in the Eastern
Arc Mountains is likely the result of secondary contact of
two highly differentiated lineages instead of disruptive
selection across an altitudinal gradient. Our analyses support three main lineages within Phyllastrephus debilis
sensu lato and stress the recognition of two species of
‘Tiny Greenbul’, P. albigula restricted to the Nguru and
Usambara Mts, and P. debilis distributed in the Tanzanian lowland forest (ssp rabai) and in Mozambique/Zimbabwe (ssp debilis). Introgression of some alleles (mostly
from rabai to albigula) appears to have occurred at three
different localities (Mt. Kanga, East Usambara foothills
and the Nguru Mts), in mid-altitude areas with a transition between foothill and montane forest, especially in
areas which experience low seasonality. The extent of
this introgression is limited and appears to be the result
of the population expansion of the coastal rabai clade
further inland. The pattern of genetic divergence we

Page 12 of 17

found for the montane clade (Nguru versus Usambara) is
similar to what has been described in other vertebrates
for mtDNA (reciprocally monophyletic), although our
results from the nuclear genome emphasize the need for
more studies from East Africa to include a diverse set of
markers in phylogeographic studies. Greater genetic
variability was recovered in the Tanzanian lowland clade,
suggesting a greater long-term effective population size
or the existence of distinct refugia in the past, which
have now merged as lowland populations expanded.

Methods
Tissue and morphological data collection

Our morphometric data was drawn from 29 specimens
deposited in the Zoological Museum, University of
Copenhagen, as well as from notes on an additional 61
specimens deposited at other institutions (Field
Museum, National Museum of Natural History, National
Museums of Kenya, and Museum Alexander König). All
morphological measurements and the scoring of plumage patterns were undertaken by J. Fjeldså: winglength (flattened-chord, from carpal joint to tip of the
longest primary feather) was measured to the nearest
0.1 mm using a wing-rule; weight was measured using a
Pesola spring scale to the nearest 0.1 g; bill-length (from
the bill tip to the base of the exposed bill on the skull),
tail-length (from the insertion point on the pygostyle to
the tip of the longest feather) and tarsus-length were
measured using Vernier calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm.
Plumage colors were matched to known color standards
[38] to objectively define colors across specimens.
We collected tissue from 124 individuals (60 albigula,
26 debilis and 38 rabai, altogether 59 vouchers) that
span the entire distributional range of the species (Additional File 5, Figure 1): 96 of the samples were fresh tissues and 28, including 24 debilis samples, were obtained
from museum specimens (toe-pads).
Morphological analyses

Morphological measurements were log-transformed (log
x+1) to reduce variance between characters. Differences
in univariate measures between taxa were tested using
paired t-tests. Principal component analysis (PCA) was
used to summarize morphological variation. PCA was
performed on individuals and only principal components
(PCs) with eigenvalues greater than one were extracted.
The factor matrix was rotated using the varimax method
to optimize variable loadings. The resulting rotated factor matrix was used to determine which of the original
variables were most highly correlated with the PCs.
Laboratory procedures

DNA was extracted from tissue or blood using the Qiagen extraction kit (Valencia, CA) following the

Fuchs et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:117
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/117

manufacturer’s protocol. We extracted the DNA from
toe-pads in a room dedicated to ancient DNA labwork.
We used the same extraction protocols as for the fresh
samples, but added 20 μl of dithiothreitol (DTT, 0.1 M)
to facilitate the digestion of these tissues. We amplified
and sequenced four loci, one mitochondrial (ND2), two
autosomal (Beta-fibrinogen intron-5, FGB; GAPDH
intron-11, GAPDH) and one Z-linked (BRM intron-15,
BRM). PCR-amplification was performed using standard
protocols, only the annealing temperature varied (54-60°
C). Locations on the chicken genome and primer
sequences used are detailed in the Additional File 6. All
sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Accession
Numbers HQ716721-HQ717145)
Molecular sexing

We sexed individuals with the primer pair P2/P8 using
the protocol described in Griffiths et al. [39]; sex was
deduced based on the number of bands (two for females
and one for male). For the museum specimens, sex was
inferred from the specimen labels. We could not obtain
any PCR-product using the P2/P8 primer pair for 14
individuals that were homozygous at the Z-linked locus
we sequenced (BRM). For these 14 individuals, we aimed
to PCR-amplify and sequence three further Z-linked loci
(CHDZ, ACO1, SPIN1, [40]). Our success with PCRamplification was variable; we considered an individual
to be a female if no heterozygous position was detected
in at least two loci (minimum length of Z-linked data:
834 bp, maximum length of Z-linked data: 2849 bp).

Kreitman test [45]. The stop codon was excluded from the
analyses, leaving a total of 1038 bp for 110 Tiny Greenbuls. We used sequences of P. hypochloris (DQ402215)
and P. xavieri (DQ402219) as outgroups. Significance was
assessed using Fischer’s exact test at a threshold of 0.05.
We tested for selection acting on the nuclear loci by
using the HKA test [46], as implemented in DNASP 5.0
[47]. We used sequences from one Yellow-Streaked
Greenbul Phyllastrephus flavostriatus as an outgroup (S.
Lokugalappatti unpubl. data).
Determining the phase of alleles

We used PHASE V2.1.1 [48] to infer the alleles for each
nuclear locus. Three runs, using different seed values,
were performed and results were compared across runs.
We used the recombination model and ran the iterations of the final run 10 times longer than for the other
runs. We used a threshold of 0.75 to consider a SNP to
be satisfactorily phased [49] and individuals that did not
satisfy this threshold were removed from further
analysis.
Population genetic analyses

Molecular phylogenies were estimated using maximum
likelihood and Bayesian inference, as implemented in
PHYML 3.0 [41] and MRBAYES 3.1.2 [42], respectively.
The most appropriate models of nucleotide substitution
were determined with DT_MODSEL [43]. Two analyses of
four Metropolis-coupled MCMC chains (one cold and
three heated) were run for ten million iterations with trees
sampled every 100 iterations. The number of iterations
discarded before the posterior probabilities were calculated
varied among analyses. We checked that the potential
scale reduction factor (PSRF) approached 1.0 for all parameters and that the average standard deviation of split frequencies converged towards zero. We also used TRACER
v1.5 [44] to ascertain whether our sampling of the posterior distribution had reached a sufficient effective sample
size (ESS) for meaningful parameter estimation. We made
use of sequences of P. hypochloris (DQ402215) and P.
xavieri (DQ402219) as outgroups.

Haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (π) and
Watterson’s theta (θ) were estimated with DNASP 5.0.
We used TCS 1.21 [50] to reconstruct a 95% statistical
parsimony network. Overall genetic structure of populations was investigated with an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA, 1000 permutations) using pairwise
distances (jst, [51]), as implemented in ARLEQUIN v3.1
[52]. In order to test for any correlation between geographic (shortest straight line) and genetic distances
(ND2 uncorrected-p) we performed a Mantel test in
GENALEX 6 [53].
We used Fu’s Fs test (1000 replicates) and RamosOnsins and Rozas R2 statistic [24], as implemented in
DNASP 5.0, to detect signatures of demographic change.
The significance of the R2 statistic was assessed using
1000 coalescent simulations. We also used Bayesian skyline plots [54] on the mitochondrial data set for the
albigula and rabai lineages to estimate more complex
scenarios of population dynamics. This method is independent of a priori defined demographic models and
tree reconstructions, and is thus suitable for taxa with
complicated population history. Analyses were run in
BEAST 1.5.4. [55] using the HKY model and a strict
molecular clock. The MCMC simulations were run for
206 iterations, with genealogies and model parameters
being sampled every 1000 iterations. The Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) were visualized in TRACER V.1.5 [44].

Testing for selection

mtDNA divergence times

To test whether selection was acting on the mitochondrial
protein-coding gene (ND2), we used the McDonald-

Inferring divergence times within species is a challenging task as no internal fossil calibration points can be

used for most species. The existence of a time dependency of substitution rates appears to now be well
accepted [e.g. [56]] although its magnitude continues to
be debated [57,58]. Subramanian et al. [59] suggested
that the time dependency phenomenon could primarily
be attributed to non-synonymous substitutions. They
estimated the mean rate of evolution at four-fold degenerated sites from complete mtDNA sequences of Adelie
Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) to be 0.073 (95% HPD:
0.025-0.123 s/s/myr). We applied this mutation rate,
and the associated uncertainty, to the four-fold degenerated sites within our mitochondrial data set (192 sites).
We used BEAST 1.5.4 [55,60] with an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model, coalescent tree prior
with constant population size and a GTR+Γ model of
sequence evolution: the same model of sequence evolution used by Subramanian et al. [57] to estimate the
rate. We compared this new molecular rate with a molecular clock rate for ND2 (6.2%/Ma) proposed by Arbogast et al. [61] and the ‘standard’ avian mtDNA rate of
2.1% divergence per million years. MCMC chains were
run for 5*106 steps and were sampled every 1000 steps.
Population assignment using STRUCTURE

We used STRUCTURE V2 [62] to infer how many
populations could be distinguished based on the three
nuclear loci. We only included individuals (n = 80) for
which: 1) all three nuclear loci could be satisfactorily
phased, and 2) sequences of the three nuclear loci were
available. We compared the optimal number of populations estimated by STRUCTURE and the probability of
each individual being assigned to each population across
analyses. We assumed an admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and let alpha vary among populations. We ran 2*10 6 iterations (burnin: 2*10 5
iterations) from K = 1 to K = 5. The number of clusters
(populations) was estimated using ΔK [63].
Multi-locus network and species tree approaches

We used POFAD V1.03 [64] and SPLITSTREE V4.0 [65]
to build a multi-locus network based on the mitochondrial and nuclear data sets. We used the same set of
individuals that were used in the STRUCTURE analyses.
We used uncorrected-p distances as input for POFAD
and made use of the standardized matrix for network
reconstruction.
We used the species tree approach (*BEAST, [66])
implemented in BEAST 1.5.4 [55,60], to estimate the
relationship among the three subspecies (albigula,
debilis and rabai). Species tree approaches implement
the coalescent to estimate a species tree based on the
individual gene trees; this approach has been shown to
outperform the traditional concatenation approaches in
that incomplete lineage sorting is explicitly taken into

Page 14 of 17

account. We defined each subspecies as a ‘species’. We
used all individuals for which full phase information was
available and assumed a strict molecular clock model
for all loci and made used of the best-fit model for each
partition, as determined with DT_MODSEL[43]. Thus,
each locus had its own model and clock rate specified.
We ran the MCMC chains for 100 million iterations.
We made use of the software BAYESIAN PHYLOGENY AND PHYLOGEOGRAPHY V2.0 (BPP v2.0,
[67,68]) to estimate the speciation probability for the
case where all three subspecies are considered species.
This decision was based on the results from the
STRUCTURE analyses, multi-locus network and species
tree analyses. The method implemented in BPP v2.0
accommodates the species phylogeny as well as lineage
sorting due to ancestral polymorphism. A speciation
probability of 1 on a node indicates that every species
delimitation model visited by the reverse-jump MCMC
algorithm supports the marginal posterior probability
inference that two lineages descend from a particular
node as ‘species’. We consider to speciation probability
values greater than 0.95 as strong-support for the occurrence of a speciation event. A gamma prior was used on
the population size parameters (θs) and the age of the
root in the species tree (τ 0 ), whereas the other divergence time parameters were assigned a Dirichlet prior
[[68]: equation 2]. We ran the rjMCMC analyses for 500
000 generations with a burn-in period of 10 000 and different starting seeds. We ran each analysis at least twice.
We evaluated the influence of the priors on the posterior probabilities by changing the priors for θ and τ0,
assuming either small or large ancestral population size
with G set to (2, 2000) and (1, 10), respectively, and
shallow or deep divergence with G set to (2, 2000) and
(1, 10), respectively.
Coalescent analyses using the Isolation with Migration
model

We used the Markov chain Monte Carlo method implemented in the program IMa [69] to fit the data to a
model that included both isolation and migration. IMa
estimates six parameters scaled to the neutral mutation
rate (μ): θ pop1 (4Ne pop1 μ), θ pop 2 (4Ne pop2 μ), θ popA
(4NepopAμ), t (T/μ, where T is the time since population
divergence in years before present), m1 (2 M/θ pop1 ,
where M is the effective number of migrants moving
into population 1) and m2 (2 M/θpop2, where M is the
effective number of migrants moving into population 2).
We defined inheritance scales to reflect the difference in
modes of inheritance among the loci used: 0.25 for the
mtDNA locus, 0.75 for the Z-linked locus and 1.0 for
the two autosomal loci. We used an HKY model of
nucleotide substitution for the mtDNA and an infinitesites model for each of the three nuclear loci.

Fuchs et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:117

Parameters and genealogies were sampled every 100
steps for the 5 and 10 million step runs. To assess convergence we monitored the extent of autocorrelation,
parameter trend lines and the effective sample size
(ESS) throughout the run and we also compared the
results between three independent runs.
We used a generation time of 1.7 years, which reflects
the average for several passerine species [70], and a
mutation rate of 1.05*10-8 substitutions/site/year (s/s/y)
for mtDNA (6.1% per million years, [61]), and thus a
per locus rate of 3.17*10 -5 substitutions per year. For
the Z-linked locus we assumed a mutation rate of
3.6*10-9 s/s/y and for autosomal loci we selected a rate
of 3.61*10 -9 s/s/y [71]. This translated into per locus
rates of: FGB 2.01*10 -6 s/l/y, GAPDH 1.17*10 -6 s/l/y,
and BRM 1.31*10 -6 s/l/y. The geometric mean of the
combined mtDNA and ncDNA was 3.14*10-6 s/l/y. We
tested for intralocus recombination using the GARD
and SBP algorithm, as implemented in HYPHY [72,73].
We performed four pairwise comparisons: 1) albigula
versus rabai, 2) albigula versus rabai with individuals collected on Mt Kanga excluded (see results), 3) rabai versus
debilis, and 4) albigulaNguru versus albigulaUsambara.
Bioclimatic data analyses

Current bioclimatic data (Bioclim variables 1-18, 30 arcseconds resolution = c. 1 × 1 km) were collected from
WORLDCLIM http://www.worldclim.org/current and
compiled using DIVA-GIS v7.2 [74]. The climatic envelope for each of the sampling points was then extracted.
We performed a Principal Component Analysis on the 18
bioclimatic parameters extracted from each sampling
point using a correlation matrix approach in R 2.10.1 [75].
