Abstract
Background: Cernunnos-XLF is a nonhomologous end-joining factor that is mutated in patients
with a rare immunodeficiency with microcephaly. Several other microcephaly-associated genes
such as ASPM and microcephalin experienced recent adaptive evolution apparently linked to brain
size expansion in humans. In this study we investigated whether Cernunnos-XLF experienced similar
positive selection during human evolution.
Results: We obtained or reconstructed full-length coding sequences of chimpanzee, rhesus
macaque, canine, and bovine Cernunnos-XLF orthologs from sequence databases and sequence trace
archives. Comparison of coding sequences revealed an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions
consistent with positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF in the human lineage. The hotspots of adaptive
evolution are concentrated around a specific structural domain, whose analogue in the structurally
similar XRCC4 protein is involved in binding of another nonhomologous end-joining factor, DNA
ligase IV.
Conclusion: Cernunnos-XLF is a microcephaly-associated locus newly identified to be under
adaptive evolution in humans, and possibly played a role in human brain expansion. We speculate
that Cernunnos-XLF may have contributed to the increased number of brain cells in humans by
efficient double strand break repair, which helps to prevent frequent apoptosis of neuronal
progenitors and aids mitotic cell cycle progression.

Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic DNA
lesions caused by ionizing radiation, spontaneous chromosomal breaks, activity of cellular endonucleases, or
during replication of other DNA lesions such as singlestrand breaks. If unrepaired, DSBs efficiently trigger arrest
of cell cycle progression and cell death by apoptosis [1]. In
response to this danger, cells have developed mechanisms

that repair DSBs. In eukaryotic cells, there are two major
groups of DSB repair pathways [2]: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). In
contrast to HR, NHEJ does not require a highly identical
undamaged partner DNA strand to repair DSBs and, after
some processing, can ligate virtually any two DNA ends.
This makes NHEJ a very efficient, yet error-prone DSB
repair mechanism.
The lack of mutation in known NHEJ components in a
patient with characteristic phenotypic effects of defective
NHEJ lead to the conclusion that there must be at least
one undiscovered component of the NHEJ pathway [3].
The search for this additional element lead to the recent
discovery of a new NHEJ factor called Cernunnos-XLF
[4,5]. Homozygous Cernunnos-XLF mutations are manifested by autosomal recessive immunodeficiency associated with mental retardation and microcephaly [4]. This
2q35 gene encodes a protein that interacts with the core
NHEJ ligation complex composed of DNA ligase IV and
XRCC4 [5,6]. The Cernunnos-XLF protein shows similarity to XRCC4 [5] and is homologous to the Nej1 NHEJ factor from yeast [6]. The locus seems to be present in all
animals, most fungi, but not in plants.
The presence of microcephaly in patients prompted us to
look closely for evolution of Cernunnos-XLF in primates,
because several other genes linked to microcephalyrelated disorders and brain size are under positive selection in hominoid primates and humans [7-15]. By comparing Cernunnos-XLF genes in five different mammalian
species, we discovered strong evidence for adaptive evolution of this locus in the human lineage. Therefore, Cernunnos-XLF can be considered as yet another strongly
selected factor, potentially contributing to increased skull
and brain size in humans.

Results and discussion
Conservation of Cernunnos-XLF in mammals
Human (CAI99410), cow (XP_586059), and dog Cernunnos-XLF (XP_848099) proteins and the corresponding
coding sequences (CDS) were extracted from Genbank.
The macaque and chimpanzee copies were assembled
from the Genbank trace archive and genome assembly,
respectively (see Methods). Except for dog, all the genes
appear to encode 299 aa long proteins; the predicted dog
coding sequence contains an additional domain at the 5'
end. Since this domain is not conserved in other species,
it very likely represents an error in automated gene annotation and we shortened the dog ortholog to the 299 aa
segment that is homologous to the remaining mammalian proteins.

Comparison of individual mammalian copies revealed a
variable rate of amino acid replacements along Cernunnos-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/15

XLF (Fig. 1). While synonymous changes are dispersed relatively uniformly, nonsynonymous changes are clustered
in several domains (Fig. 1B,C). Most variable is the C-terminal part between aa 212–281. Another less pronounced
variable region is at aa positions 87–99. This profile is
similar to the protein conservation in vertebrates [5].
There are five nonsynonymous substitutions between the
human and chimpanzee genes (four of them seem to be
human-specific) and no synonymous changes. Interestingly, these five changes are unevenly distributed along
the protein. Position 124, which changed in the human
lineage, and the chimpanzee substitution at aa 127 are
located within a conserved linker between the N-terminal
globular head domain and the remaining coiled-coil part
(Fig. 1D). Three other positions 216, 223, and 235
changed in humans, and cluster within the predicted end
of a coiled-coil C-terminal domain [Figure 1SA in ref 5].
Adaptive evolution of Cernunnos-XLF genes in the
human lineage
The analysis of individual branches in the phylogenetic
tree (Fig. 2) revealed signs of negative selection (Ka/Ks <
1) on most branches, but the presence of five nonsynonymous and the lack of synonymous substitutions indicate
possible positive Darwinian selection in humans and
chimpanzees. Indeed, likelihood ratio tests confirm that
the human and possibly also chimpanzee lineages
evolved under different Ka/Ks rates compared to the rest
of the tree (significant; Fig. 2). These results are robust
even when one by one we discarded all individual changes
(not shown). When both human and chimpanzee lineages were combined into one group, the resulting joined
Ka/Ks ratio is above 1 (borderline significant) suggesting
positive selection. Therefore, we can conclude that the
Cernunnos-XLF locus evolved adaptively under positive
selection in humans. Whether chimpanzees also experienced positive selection is unclear, but the rate of protein
evolution seems to be lower compared to humans.
Finally, we were also interested in how Cernunnos-XLF
evolves in the recent human population. HapMap data
indicates the lack of recent positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF [16]. However, given the presence of two nonsynomous and no synonymous polymorphic positions in the
human population [17] we cannot rule out that some
positive selection still operates on this locus.

As mentioned above, the amino acid replacements in the
human and chimpanzee lineages are clustered and, as a
consequence, adaptive evolution in Cernunnos-XLF
appears to be concentrated in very specific regions. One
hotspot is located in the region between the predicted Nterminal globular head domain and the long coiled-coil
part (Fig. 1D). The second rapidly evolving region is
located at the putative C-terminal end of the coiled-coil
domain (not shown). The exact structure and function of

Structure and evolution of Cernunnos-XLF proteins inmammals
Structure and evolution of Cernunnos-XLF proteins inmammals. The scale of all plots corresponds to the protein
alignment of 299 amino acids, and positions in the coding sequence (CDS) were scaled accordingly. A. Structure of human Cernunnos-XLF CDS and protein. The first scheme shows the positions of the major predicted domains in the Cernunnos-XLF
protein [after ref. 5]. The N-terminal globular head domain is marked in yellow, the remaining coiled-coil structure in blue, the
putative nuclear localization signal is in red. The second scheme shows the positions of the coding exons (2–8) in the CDS (the
odd exons are black and the even ones are white). B. CDS substitutions during evolution. The expected ancestral coding
sequence was estimated using maximum likelihood codon reconstruction implemented in PAML. Nonsynonymous/synonymous (ω = Ka/Ks) ratios were free to vary in all branches. Positions marked in green correspond to synonymous changes in a
given lineage. Bars representing nonsynonymous changes are black if conservative, red if nonconservative (see methods).
"MCH-CH" corresponds to the ancestral lineage between the common ancestor of macaque, chimpanzee, and human (MCH)
to the common ancestor of human and chimpanzee (CH), "anc-MCH" represents the lineage from the common ancestor of all
taxons to MCH (see Fig. 2). C. Conservation at the nucleotide level in primates, and protein level in primates and mammals.
The Y axis corresponds to the proportion of conserved (identical) positions in the CDS (a 60-bp overlapping window and 6-bp
steps) and the protein alignment (window 20-aa, step 2-aa). D. Predicted structure of the Cernunnos-XLF protein. The structure for the first 185 aa was predicted by structural alignment to XRCC4 (see methods). The red parts highlight positions that
are different between human and chimpanzee, aa 124 changed in the human lineage, aa 127 in the chimpanzee branch. Three
other positions were changed in humans – aa 216, 223, 235 (see Fig. 2B).

these regions in Cernunnos-XLF is unknown, but in the
case of the structurally similar XRCC4 protein, the head
domain seems to interact with DNA and/or proteins while
the coiled-coil region binds the linker connecting two
BRCT repeats of ligase IV [18-20]. It is tempting to speculate that the adaptive evolution around the coiled-coil
region is related to a putative interaction of this region
with ligase IV and by extension to the proposed Cernunnos-XLF function: promoting the DNA ligation function
of the XRCC4-ligase IV complex [4,5].
Cernunnos-XLF – another factor in human brain
expansion?
Genome-wide comparisons have revealed that a significant number of protein-coding genes undergo adaptive

evolution in humans [17,21,22]. Notably, the dramatic
increase in brain size and complexity during human evolution was accompanied by accelerated, often positive,
selection on several genes involved in regulation of brain
size and the nervous system in general [7-15]. These genes
include two primary microcephaly loci under strong positive selection in humans ASPM (abnormal spindle-like),
and microcephalin/MCPH1; and possibly also other microcephaly-associated loci with an increased Ka/Ks rate in
primates PAFAH1B1 (alpha subunit of platelet-activating
factor acetylhydrolase 1B) and SHH (sonic hedgehog),
although the latter two may be merely under relaxed constraints [12]. Adaptive evolution of Cernunnos-XLF thus
fits the general pattern of simultaneous selection acting
upon several microcephaly-associated genes in humans.

Cernunnos-XLF mammalian coding sequences. Phylogenetic tree obtained by the free ratio codon model in PAML. The ancestral branches from Fig. 1A are indicated by italics. Branch labels mark the ω = Ka/Ks ratios for corresponding branches. For the
human and chimpanzee branches we could not calculate the Ka/Ks ratio and instead we list the number of synonymous (S) and
nonsynonymous (N) changes in square brackets. The boxes list selected tested hypotheses. The Ka/Ks rate is designated as ωH
for the in the human lineage, ωC for the chimpanzee lineage, and ω0 for all other lineages. A single asterisk indicates P < 5%, χ21
= 3.84, double asterisk indicates P < 1%, χ21 = 6.63. The left box tests the hypotheses that the Ka/Ks ratio for the human lineage is the same as for the rest of the tree (rejected at P < 5%), and that both human and chimpanzee lineages have the same Ka/
Ks ratio shared with other branches (rejected at P < 1%). The right box shows tests Ka/Ks ≤ 1 for the human lineage (not significant) and for both human and chimpanzee lineages (rejected at P < 5%). B. Amino acid residues for five critical positions
changed between human and chimpanzee. The tree also includes orthologous positions from the orangutan Cernunnos-XLF
protein. The figure shows conservation of the critical positions in macaque and orangutan, which represents the most likely
ancestral state. Four human and one chimpanzee changes indicated in the figure represent the most parsimonious scenario of
Cernunnos-XLF evolution.

How can the Cernunnos-XLF function in nonhomologous end-joining contribute to our brain size? It seems
natural to assume that brain expansion should reflect an
increased number of cells, and thus cell divisions during
brain neurogenesis [15,23]. A direct extrapolation of this
assumption is that the increased brain size could be
achieved by an increased efficiency of factors involved in
cell cycle progression, mitosis, or by preventing apoptosis.
Consistent with this hypothesis are cellular functions of
two strongly selected primary microcephaly genes ASPM
and microcephalin. ASPM is a mitotic spindle protein that
may participate in regulation of cell division during neurogenesis [24]. Microcephalin encodes a DNA damage
response protein regulating the BRCA1-CHK1 DNA damage response pathway [25,26]. This suggests that microcephalin-linked primary microcephaly is related to cellular
checkpoint defects causing increased cellular apoptosis in
neural lineages [26]. Therefore, effective repair of DNA
damage at cellular checkpoints is a prerequisite for efficient cell proliferation during neurogenesis, and adaptive
evolution of microcephalin may reflect this requirement.
It appears that both functional homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) are essen-

tial during nervous system development. Inactivation of
some NHEJ components, including ligase IV and XRCC4,
in mouse causes apoptosis of post-mitotic neurons [27].
As a consequence, positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF
may be related to the essential role of this factor in efficient DNA damage repair by NHEJ and, in turn, in preventing apoptosis in neuronal progenitors.
In summary, adaptive evolution of Cernunnos-XLF in
humans fits into the broader scheme of microcephaly
gene evolution in primates. On one hand, each positively
selected gene operates at a different level: the spindle protein ASPM on the level of cell division, microcephalin by
participating in DNA damage response during cellular
checkpoints, and Cernunnos-XLF by direct involvement
in NHEJ repair of damaged DNA. On the other hand, the
phenotypic effect is similar – an increased number of neurons in the developing brain by either efficient cell proliferation (presumably in the case of ASPM) or prevention of
apoptosis (microcephalin, Cernunnos-XLF).
While association of Cernunnos-XLF selection with
increased brain size is attractive in the context of simultaneous adaptation of several brain size determinants, there

are also other possible explanations. Cernunnos-XLF deficiency is manifested by an increased susceptibility to
infections due to immunodeficiency caused by impaired
renewal of T and B cells [4]. Delayed reproduction in
humans may require a highly efficient immune system
that is able to fight infections during the prolonged prereproductive period of life. Another possibility is
increased pressure on the general tumor suppression function of DSB repair in humans due to differences in reproductive cycle, changes in diet, lifestyle and/or exposure to
mutagenic agents. Given its essential role in NHEJ, Cernunnos-XLF deficiencies may be associated with an
increased cancer risk [4,5]. Indeed, the tumor suppressor
BRCA1 is another, well studied DNA repair factor under
positive selection in humans [28,29]. Moreover, tumor
suppressor genes in general seem to evolve under higher
Ka/Ks rate in humans [22]. While several possible explanations are possible, it is clear that the complete elucidation of Cernunnos-XLF evolution in humans will require
better understanding of Cernunnos-XLF function and its
impact on various cellular processes.

Conclusion
Cernunnos-XLF is a new component of the nonhomologous end-joining machinery mutated in human immunodeficiency with microcephaly [4,5]. Using newly obtained
coding sequences in chimpanzee and rhesus macaque as
well as dog and cow orthologs, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of Cernunnos-XLF in mammals. We
found that Cernunnos-XLF is under positive selection in
the human lineage. Hotspots of adaptive evolution are
concentrated around the putative DNA ligase IV binding
domain. After ASPM and microcephalin, Cernunnos-XLF is
the third identified microcephaly-associated locus under
strong adaptive evolution in humans and possibly played
a role in the expansion of brain size in humans. We speculate that Cernunnos-XLF may contribute to the increased
number of brain cell in humans by efficient double strand
break repair, which helps to prevent frequent apoptosis of
neuronal progenitors and aids mitotic cell cycle progression.

Methods
Reconstruction of the macaque and chimpanzee
Cernunnos-XLF coding sequence
We used human coding sequence (CDS) as a probe for
discontiguous Mega BLAST [30] searches against the
macaque whole genome shotgun trace archive (Macaca
mulata WGS). For all highly similar hits in the trace
archive, the full-length trace sequences were aligned using
BLAT [31] to the human Cernunnos-XLF gene, including
introns, to ensure proper localization. The consensus
sequence obtained from the alignment of individual trace
sequences represents the expected macaque CernunnosXLF coding sequence. The predicted macaque CDS was

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/15

covered by two or more sequences from the trace archive
along its complete length (Fig. 3). The chimpanzee Cernunnos-XLF gene was obtained from BLAT [31] alignment
of the human copy with the chimpanzee genome assembly, and the coding sequence homologous to human CDS
was extracted.
Sequence analysis
Mammalian Cernunnos-XLF protein sequences were
aligned using Dialign2 [32] and the alignment was visualized in GeneDoc [33]. Synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitutions were obtained using SNAP [34]. Gonnet
PAM250 matrix [35] was applied to classify substitutions
as conservative or non-conservative. We considered
changes to be conservative if the score was > 0.5. We used
ancestral sequence reconstruction and the free ratio codon
model in PAML v. 3.13 [36] to reconstruct phylogeny and
estimate placement of substitutions along individual
branches of the phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree
was drawn in TREEVIEW [37].
Detection of positive selection
Positive selection along individual branches was detected
by likelihood ratio tests as described previously [38]. First,
we compared the log-likelihood value for one-ratio and
two-ratio models to detect possible different Ka/Ks ratios
in individual lineages. To test whether these lineages
evolve with Ka/Ks significantly >1, we compared the two
ratio models with the Ka/Ks ratio set to 1 and with free
(estimated) Ka/Ks for the lineages under consideration.
Prediction of the protein structure
Structural alignment of human Cernunnos-XLF protein to
the DNA repair protein XRCC4 (1fu1) was performed
using 3D-PSSM [39] and SWISS MODEL [40] servers,
analogously to ref [5]. The predicted structure of the
human Cernunnos-XLF protein was visualized in PyMOL
[41].

There is much interest in identifying nucleotide substitutions that might underlie human-specific biology. Pavlicek & Jurka have undertaken an evolutionary analysis of
Cernunnos-XLF and propose that this gene has experienced positive selection of one or more nonsynonymous
nucleotide substitutions. As this gene is mutated in individuals with microcephaly, the authors propose a causa-

tive link between brain enlargement and Cernunnos-XLF
adaptive evolution.
Pavlicek & Jurka base their proposal of adaptive evolution
in chimpanzee and human Cernunnos-XLF upon 5
inferred nucleotide substitutions, all of which are proposed to have been nonsynonymous. The major issue in
the authors' conclusion of positive selection is whether
the extremely short branch lengths of chimpanzee and
human sequences affect predictions. For example, approximately 20% of chimpanzee/human divergence is due to
substitutions that are not fixed. If any one of the 5 substitutions were discarded, would the significance of these
findings remain? Similarly, if the chimpanzee sequence
were to be discarded would the predictions still hold?

Author response: We agree with the reviewers that some substitution(s) in the human/chimpanzee lineages may in fact be
polymorphic mutations. Therefore, following the reviewers'
advice, for each of the five nonsynonymous substitutions, we
replaced the particular (changed) position by its ancestral
(unchanged) codon. We concentrate initially on the increased
Ka/Ks ratio in the human lineage, which seems to be under the
strongest positive selection:
As expected, when we discarded individual human-specific
changes, the likelihood ratio difference decreased, from 6.32 to
4.76–4.78, but remained significant. The removal of the chimpanzee-specific substitutions at position 127 had negligible
effect on the significance of the human Ka/Ks ratio. The same
applies for the test of difference between human and chimpanzee lineages versus the rest of the tree:
We can see that the results on unequal ω = Ka/Ks ratios are
robust for removal of all individual positions.
We cannot discard the chimpanzee sequence, because this
sequence is crucial in defining human-specific changes. When
we discarded the chimpanzee copy, the Ka/Ks ratio was not significantly different from the rest of tree. However, in this test
we did not analyze Ka/Ks in the human lineage, but the long
lineage from the common ancestor of human and macaque to
modern humans. Figure 2(now 2A) shows that most of the time
this lineage was under negative selection.
It is probable that the issue of resolving power at the
branch tips could be resolved by additional information,
particularly of additional ape orthologous sequences.
Author response: We agree, but we could not reconstruct
other full-length primate orthologs, as sequence traces are
incomplete. The most complete is the orangutan CernunnosXLF copy, which lacks only one exon. However, since the only
difference between human and chimpanzee are five nonsynonymous changes, we decided to concentrate on these five positions (newly added Fig 2B). The figure shows conservation of
the critical positions in macaque and orangutan and represents
the most likely ancestral state. Four human and one chimpanzee changes indicated in the figure represent the most parsimonious scenario of Cernunnos-XLF evolution. Positions 124, 127

are covered by four trace sequences (764029532, 871856388,
853589440, and 799919414) and positions 216, 223, and
235 by one sequence (850346752).
We would like to stress that all five changes between human
and chimpanzee would be nonsynonymous no matter what
method we use (supposing that the genomic sequences are correct). The only question is in which lineage they occurred. This
additional orangutan data gave us confidence that reconstruction of the human-chimpanzee ancestral sequence was correct
and that there is a high probability that four changes occurred
in the human lineage and only one in chimpanzees.
Additionally, haplotype analysis of Cernunnos-XLF
would be required to investigate whether positive selection has been ongoing in more recent times. Results from
these approaches would have been appropriate to bolster
the authors' proposal.
Author response: The reviewers (as well as one other
reviewer, see below) raised an excellent point. Although we
were primarily interested in the signs of positive selection in the
last 5–6 million years of human evolution, it is interesting to
check for positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF in more recent
times. As suggested by another reviewer, we used the recent
study by Voight et al. (PLoS Biology 2006 4:e72) to evaluate
positive selection in the recent human population. Voight et al.
used the HapMap data to detect signatures of positive selection
in three different populations: east Asians (ASN), western
Europeans (CEU), and sub-Saharan Africans (Yoruba – YRI).
The authors set up a public web server Haplotter http://hgwen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htmthat analyzes
HapMap data for all human chromosomes and also for individual genes. Based on this dataset, it seems that Cernunnos-XLF
is not under positive selection in recent human populations (the
empirical p-values are 0.25 for CEU, 0.41 for YRI, and 0.999
ASN).
However, we would like to point out some limitations of the
HapMap data. First of all is the time limitation: it seems that
favored haplotypes are roughly just 6,600 and 10,800 years old
for African and non-African populations, respectively (Voight
et al. 2006). The application of haplotype analysis for detection
of selection in longer periods is limited. Indeed, in many cases

Biology Direct 2006, 1:15

there is a low correspondence between positive selection detected
from interspecies analysis and analysis of human polymorphism. For example, a well documented example of a strongly
selected gene in the human lineage BRCA1 (Ka/Ks > 2.5, Pavlicek et al. 2004 HMG 13:2737-51.) does not show any sign
of positive selection in the recent population (Haplotter, the
empirical p-values are 0.15, 0.61, and 0.999). More surprisingly, even ASPM and microcephalin, which are both known to
be under selection in the recent human population (MekelBobrov et al. 2005 Science 309:1720-2; Evans et al. 2005 Science 309:1717-20), do not show any significant selection from
HapMap data either (ASPM: the p-values are 0.999 for CEU,
0.23 for YRI, and 0.54 for ASN; microcephalin: the p-values
are 0.55, 0.17, 0.54). This discrepancy is probably related to
data selection (resequencing of 89 individuals versus public
HapMap data) and also high variability in the strength of selection between different human populations.
Interestingly, Bustamante et al. 2005 (Nature 437:1153-7.)
found two nonsynonymous and no synonymous polymorphic
positions within the human population. Thus, it is possible that
Cernunnos-XLF is still under selection in the human population
(despite the lack of support from the haplotype data). Therefore
we added two sentences: "HapMap data indicates the lack of
recent positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF [16]. However,
given the presence of two nonsynomous and no synonymous polymorphic positions in the human population [17]we cannot
rule out that some positive selection still operates on this locus."
Also, it is unclear why the authors have not taken advantage of the mouse and rat genome sequences, or pig and
opossum ESTs, or even the unassembled sequences from
rabbit, armadillo and elephant, which are provided from
the UCSC's genome browser site. Would consideration of
these sequences provide evidence to support, or otherwise, the authors' prediction?
Author response: When we added mouse, rat, pig, and possum Cernunnos copies, the statistical significance of the likelihood tests increased, not decreased. For instance, the test for an
increased Ka/Ks rate in the human lineage yielded chi-square
6.78 (1 d.f.; p < 0.05) up from 6.32 (p < 0.05). The chisquare test for different Ka/Ks in the human and chimpanzee
lineage increased to 8.38 (p < 0.01) from 7.90 (p < 0.05).
Apart from human and chimpanzee, all the Ka/Ks for all other
lineages is < 1; 0.52 for mouse, 0.54 (rat), 0.27 (pig), and
0.25 (possum). Therefore, our results are more robust after
addition of more mammalian sequences. Since the crucial part
for our analysis is the primate part of tree, we decided not to
include these new sequences in the analysis. Non-primate
sequences merely serve as outgroups, and for this purpose cow
and dog sequences are sufficient.

genes, their proposed adaptive evolution and brain
enlargement cannot yet be accepted without the consideration of other possible explanations. For example, as with
other microcephaly genes, Cernunnos-XLF is expressed
widely and is not brain-specific (indeed its expression in
the brain is not obviously elevated relative to other tissues). The chimpanzee brain appears not to have enlarged
greatly since the last common ancestor with humans, and
the three-fold enlargement of our brains only occurred in
the last 3 million years. Timing initiation of CernunnosXLF adaptive evolution relative to physiological innovations would provide greater insights into these causal relationships than this manuscript can yet provide.
Author response: We agree with reviewers that the role of
Cernunnos-XLF in human brain expansion is speculative. In
the last paragraph of the Discussion we wrote that: "While association of Cernunnos-XLF selection with increased brain size is
attractive in the context of simultaneous adaptation of several
brain size determinants, there are also other possible explanations." Two such explanations are mentioned in the same paragraph. In the Abstract, we clearly stated that Cernunnos-XLF
"possibly played a role" in human brain expansion. So far, little
is known about its function. However, the involvement of
another positively selected candidate gene microcephalin/
MCPH1/BRIT1 in DNA damage response (Lin et al, 2005)
indicates that efficient DNA repair can be crucial in early brain
development. In this context, the proposed selection on the
repair factor Cernunnos-XLF is speculative, but in line with
some current proposals on the mechanisms of human brain
expansion.
Concerning the selection on chimpanzees, the mode of chimpanzee evolution is unclear. Given the single change encountered after the split with humans we cannot conclude if the
chimpanzee locus is under selection or not. For this reason we
used two tests that include and exclude the chimpanzee branch
from positively selected lineages. Clearly the human lineage was
under positive selection, and this result is robust even when we
considered the human lineage alone from the rest of the tree
including the chimpanzee branch (Figure 2). The fact that the
human lineage, not chimpanzee, exhibits a higher nonsynonymous rate is in fact in agreement with human, not chimpanzee,
brain enlargement. It seems that our description was confusing;
we changed the corresponding paragraph of Results to clearly
state that the major part of positive selection happened in
humans and is significant by itself. In the Abstract we speak
only about adaptive evolution in humans.

p4–5. In the summary, there is no caveat that these genes
might not, after all, have evolved adaptively due to brain
enlargement.
Author response: We agree. The last paragraph before Conclusions clearly indicates that other explanations are possible
(e.g. "While several possible explanations are possible, it is clear
that the complete elucidation of Cernunnos-XLF evolution in
humans will require better understanding of Cernunnos-XLF
function and its impact on various cellular processes"). Also in
the Conclusions we clearly state "Cernunnos-XLF ... possibly
played a role in the expansion of brain size". A similar sentence
is used in the Abstract.

Author response: The macaque coding sequence is crucial for
estimating the ancestral state before the split of humans and

Biology, 518 Mueller Lab, Penn State University, University
Park, PA 16802

The manuscript by Adam Pavlicek and Jerzy Jurka contributes new information to the list of human genes evolving
under positive selection. The authors examined a locus
(Cernunnos-XLF) associated with microcephaly because
of the evidence that other genes linked to this disorder
have evolved under adaptive evolution in humans (ASPM
and microcephalin). They used comparative sequence
information for this locus from several mammalian species and identified an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions occurring in the human lineage (after divergence
from the common ancestor with chimpanzee), which is
suggestive of positive selection. Four nonsynonymous
substitutions occurred in the human lineage, as compared
with only one such substitution in the chimpanzee lineage.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/15

This result is of great interest particularly in the light of the
ongoing (and difficult!) quest for genes that make us
humans, so publication of this manuscript in Biology
Direct is recommended. However, an additional analysis
would strengthen the conclusions made by the authors.
1. It would be informative to see the results of other testing of the hypothesis of selection acting on this locus. For
instance, one could incorporate human polymorphism
data available from the HapMap project and search for
potentially reduced levels of heterozygosity in the region.
Such data are freely available and could also provide
information on the timing of selective constraints in the
region (is it restricted to modern humans?). Is CernunnosXLF among the loci showing a signature of strong recent
positive selection in the study by Voight et al. (PLOS Biology, 2006), which utilized HapMap data? (We realize that
the study by Voight et al. just came out and thus could not
have been included by the authors in the original draft.)
Author response: The reviewer (as well as other reviewers,
see above) raised an excellent point. Although we were primarily interested in the signs of positive selection in the last 5–6
million years of human evolution, it is interesting to check for
positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF in more recent times. As
suggested by the reviewer, we used the recent study by Voight et
al. (PLoS Biology 2006 4:e72) to evaluate positive selection in
the recent human population. Voight et al. used the HapMap
data to detect signatures of positive selection in three different
populations: east Asians (ASN), western Europeans (CEU),
and sub-Sahara Africans (Yoruba – YRI). The authors set a
public web server Haplotter http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/
selection/haplotter.htm that analyzes HapMap data for all
human chromosomes and also for individual genes. Based on
this dataset, it seems that Cernunnos-XLF is not under positive
selection in recent human populations (the empirical p-values
are 0.252749 for CEU, 0.408690 for YRI, and 0.999954
ASN).
However, we would like to point out some limitations of the
HapMap data. First of all is the time limitation, it seems that
favored haplotypes are roughly just 6,600 and 10,800 years old
for African and non-African populations, respectively (Voight
et al. 2006). The application of haplotype analysis for detection
of selection in longer periods is limited. Indeed, in many cases
there is a low correspondence between positive selection detected
from interspecies analysis and analysis of human polymorphism. For example, a well documented example of a strongly
selected gene in the human lineage BRCA1 (Ka/Ks > 2.5, Pavlicek et al. 2004 HMG 13:2737-51.) does not show any sign
of positive selection in the recent population (Haplotter, the
empirical p-values are 0.148074, 0.607928, and 0.999954).
More surprisingly, even ASPM and microcephalin, which are
both known to be under selection in the recent human population (Mekel-Bobrov et al. 2005 Science 309:1720-2; Evans et

Page 9 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:15

al. 2005 Science 309:1717-20), do not show any significant
selection from HapMap data either (ASPM: the p-values are
0.999955 for CEU, 0.225666 for YRI, and 0.539616 for
ASN; microcephalin: the p-values are 0.547812, 0.171512,
0.544621). This discrepancy is probably related to data selection (resequencing of 89 individuals versus public HapMap
data) and also a high variability in the strength of selection
between different human populations.
Interestingly, Bustamante et al. 2005 (Nature 437:1153-7.)
found two nonsynonymous and no synonymous polymorphic
positions within the human population. Thus it is possible that
Cernunnos-XLF is still under selection in the human population
(despite the lack of support from the haplotype data). Therefore
we added a sentence "HapMap data indicates the lack of recent
positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF [16]. However, given the
presence of two nonsynomous and no synonymous polymorphic
positions in the human population [17]we cannot rule out that
some positive selection still operates on this locus."
2. The authors cite a publication by Bustamante, CD et al
(Science, 2005) which investigates >11,000 human genes
for signatures of selection and includes both the comparative analysis between human and chimpanzee and analysis of polymorphisms in humans. It would be interesting
to see whether Cernunnos-XLF was included in Bustamante et al.'s analysis and, if it was, where it ranks in comparison with other genes.
Author response: Bustamante et al. 2005 used the McDonald-Kreitman test to evaluate natural selection on human
genes. This test (in Bustamante et al. 2005) did not yield any
significant support for positive selection on Cernunnos-XLF.
However, we should note that the McDonald-Kreitman test has
some limitations. Positive selection is detected as an excess of
nonsynonymous/synonymous divergence (fixed changes
between species) compared to nonsynonymous/synonymous polymorphism (in our case human Cernunnos-XLF polymorphism). However, if the positive selection still operates on the
population level, the difference between different species vs.
within population may not be significant, yet the locus is under
positive selection. For instance, microcephalin/MCPH1 in the
Bustamante et al. dataset is detected to be under negative selection "at 95% credibility level", although there is solid evidence
that this gene was under positive, not negative, selection in the
recent population (Evans et al. 2005 Science 309:1717-20).
We could not compare ASPM data, as it is present twice (under
different Refseq names) in the dataset and both copies analyzed
are severely truncated.
Bustamante et al. found two nonsynonymous and no synonymous polymorphic Cernunnos-XLF positions within the human
population, so it is possible that the gene is still under selection
in the human population (despite the lack of support from haplotype data) and thus the McDonald-Kreitman is unable to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/15

detect any difference. In conclusion, due to the incompatible
methods used, we cannot directly compare our results with the
study of Bustamante et al. 2005; as the two studies asked different questions.
Reviewer's report 3
Gáspár Jékely, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Developmental Biology Unit, Meyerhofstrasse 1, 69117 Heidelberg,
Germany

The authors identified signs of positive selection during
human evolution in the Cernunnos protein. It is interesting given that certain mutations in the human gene lead
to microcephaly. The authors speculate that positive selection in the gene may have contributed to increased brain
size evolution in humans.
However, as discussed in the paper, loss of Cernunnos
activity also leads to immunodeficiency in humans and it
is equally possible that positive selection acted to modify
immune functions during primate evolution. To decide
between these two possibilities it may help to check in
large-scale comparative expression datasets (e.g. Science
5566:340-3) whether expression levels of components of
the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex changed in humans in the
brain.
Author response: XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV were not
included in the study of Enard et al. 2002 (Science
296(5566):340-3). We therefore decided to look at similar
studies. Caceres et al. 2003 (PNAS 100:13030-5) used
Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 array to detect differential expression
in human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque brains. Although
the full dataset from that study is not available, a supplementary table listing mRNA with significantly different levels
between species does not contain transcripts encoding ligase IV
or XRCC4. Since the HG-U95Av2 array contains ligase IV
(probe-set id 963_at) and XRCC4 (1360_at) transcripts, we
conclude that these two genes are not differentially expressed in
human and chimpanzee brains. We also analyzed data from a
more recent study by Khaitovich et al. 2004 (GR 14:1462-73).
The supplementary set contains expression data for ligase IV.
While this gene seems to be more highly expressed in the human
brain, especially in the primary visual cortex, anterior cingulate
cortex, cerebellum, and Broca's area, none of these results is significant when using the author's criteria.
Since the available data do not provide conclusive data about
ligase IV overexpression in humans, we did not include any
comment in the manuscript. However, we would like to point
out that both increased expression or higher efficiency/fidelity of
Cernunnos-XLF proteins in DSB repair may have a similar
effect on the cellular level and contribute to brain expansion. If
the former were true as the reviewer suggested, we would expect
more changes in regulatory regions (promoter, enhances, not

detected), for the latter we would expect protein changes, such
as those we have described in our manuscript.
The proposed scenario for brain size increase only works
if double stranded break repair is limiting during brain
development. Is actually apoptosis regulated at the level
of double-strand break repair? In other words even if
impaired double stranded break repair can lead to apoptosis it may not mean that its increased activity can prevent it.
Author response: We believe that there is very strong evidence supporting the fact that double-strand break (DSB)
repair is one of the most important anti-apoptotic factors during
brain development. It is known that neuronal cells are one of
the most sensitive cells to deficient double-strand break (DSBs)
repair. For example, ligase IV and XRCC4 knockouts are lethal
due to massive neuronal apoptosis and it seems that "neurons
strictly require the XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV end-joining proteins" (Gao et al. 1998 Cell 95:891-902; see also Barnes et al.
1998 Curr Biol. 8:1395-8; Lee et al. 2000 Genes Dev.
14:2576-80). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that neuronal apoptosis in ligase IV- (and thus NHEJ-) deficient cells
requires the general DNA damage-signaling factor ATM (Lee
et al. 2000 Genes Dev. 14:2576-80). ATM is the key component in the DSB signaling pathway that triggers cell cycle arrest
and possibly also apoptosis (via p53 phosporylation) at all
stages of cell cycle checkpoint (Rich et al. 2000 Nature
407:777-83; Kastan & Bartek 2004 Nature 432:316-23).
During the G1/early S phase homologous recombination is suppressed and DSB repair mostly relies on error-prone NHEJ (e.g.
Rothkamm et al. 2003 Mol Cell Biol. 23:5706-15). Therefore,
more efficient (or better regulated) NHEJ can limit DNA damage by DSBs and in turn suppress the ATM signaling pathway,
especially during the G1 and G1/S cell-cycle checkpoints, which
potentially leads to cell death.
Reviewer's report 4
Eugene V. Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD 20894, USA

This is a short but interesting story. The authors convincingly show that the DSB repair factor Cernunnos-XLF
undergoes positive selection/adaptation (5 replacements
against 0 synonymous substitutions in the human line
since the divergence from the common ancestor with
chimpanzee). It is proposed that XLF prevents neuronal
apoptosis by improving the efficiency of DSB repair and
thus provides for an increase in the number of brain neurons. To me, this speculation runs a little thin, i.e., I do not
think that it is the only interpretation compatible with the
data. I think it is impossible to rule out the possibility that
XLF has another, still uncharacterized, perhaps, brain-specific function that is modified by the replacements in the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/15

human lineage; it is well known that protein moonlighting is common. However, nothing contradicts the
authors' hypothesis either, and it could be argued that, for
the moment, this is the most parsimonious explanation of
the data.
Author response: We agree with reviewers that the role of
Cernunnos-XLF in human brain expansion is speculative. In
the last paragraph of the Discussion we wrote that: "While association of Cernunnos-XLF selection with increased brain size is
attractive in the context of simultaneous adaptation of several
brain size determinants, there are also other possible explanations." Two such explanations are mentioned in the same paragraph. In the Abstract, we clearly stated that Cernunnos-XLF
"possibly played a role" in human brain expansion. So far little
is known about its function. However, the involvement of other
positively selected candidate gene microcephalin/MCPH1/
BRIT1 in DNA damage response (Lin et al, 2005) indicates
that efficient DNA repair can be crucial in early brain development. In this context, the proposed selection on the repair factor
Cernunnos-XLF is speculative, but in line with some current
proposals on the mechanisms of human brain expansion.
I believe that the paper would benefit from a somewhat
more complete presentation of the evolutionary genomics
of XLF. At least, I think it makes a lot of sense to point out
that XLF is conserved in all animals and most fungi, as
well as Dictyostelium, although the fungal and slime
mold orthologs have a distinct domain architecture.
Author response: Very recently a new paper appeared in JBC
(Callebaut et al. 2006 J Biol Chem. 2006 Mar 29; ref 6) that
partially addresses this question. In turn we modified the Introduction to "The Cernunnos-XLF protein shows similarity to
XRCC4 [5]and is homologous to the Nej1 NHEJ factor from
yeast [6]. The locus seems to be present in all animals, most
fungi, but not in plants."
Further, it is not quite correct to state that XLF has no
sequence similarity to XRCC4; such similarity is detectable, as correctly pointed out by Ahnesorg et al, even if it is
hard to demonstrate statistical significance.
Author response: We agree and the sentence was corrected
(see the previous point).
