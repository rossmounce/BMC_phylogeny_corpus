Abstract
Background: The caspase family, which plays a central role in apoptosis in metazoans, has undergone an
expansion in amphioxus, increasing to 45 members through domain recombination and shuffling.
Results: In order to shed light on the conservation and uniqueness of this family in amphioxus, we cloned three
representative caspase genes, designated as bbtCaspase-8, bbtCaspase-1/2 and bbtCaspase3-like, from the
amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense. We found that bbtCaspase-8 with conserved protein architecture is
involved in the Fas-associated death domain-Caspase-8 mediated pro-apoptotic extrinsic pathway, while
bbtCaspase3-like may mediate a nuclear apoptotic pathway in amphioxus. Also, bbtCaspase-1/2 can co-localize with
bbtFADD2 in the nucleus, and be recruited to the cytoplasm by amphioxus apoptosis associated speck-like proteins
containing a caspase recruitment domain, indicating that bbtCaspase-1/2 may serve as a switch between apoptosis
and caspase-dependent innate immune response in invertebrates. Finally, amphioxus extrinsic apoptotic pathway
related caspases played important roles in early embryogenesis.
Conclusions: Our study not only demonstrates the conservation of bbtCaspase-8 in apoptosis, but also reveals the
unique features of several amphioxus caspases with novel domain architectures arose some 500 million years ago.

Background
Programmed cell death is a gene-guided process for the
elimination of unnecessary or harmful cells in which the
cysteine proteases caspases are core elements [1-3]. To
date, 11 members of this family have been identified in
the human genome [4,5], caspase-1 to caspase-10, and
caspase-14. They can be divided, with respect to function,
into two major groups. The first, including the initiator
caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9 and -10) and the effector caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7), lead directly to apoptosis [6],
while the others, including caspase-1, -4 and -5, are
involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
[7]. Caspase-14 is mainly expressed in the epidermis and
takes part in epidermal barrier formation [8].
In vertebrate cells, the apoptotic response is mediated
through either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. The

intrinsic pathway is triggered by death stimuli generated
within the cell, such as DNA damage, leading to the
release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which associates
with caspase-9 and apoptotic protease activating factor 1
(Apaf-1) to form an apoptosome [9]. The extrinsic
apoptotic pathway is initiated by the binding of extracellular death ligands to death receptors (DRs), such as
FasL binding to Fas. As members of the TNF receptor
(TNFR) superfamily, the DRs further recruit the cytosolic adaptor Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which
interacts with procaspase-8 through death effector
domains (DEDs) to form an oligomeric death-inducing
signaling complex [10]. The activated caspase-8 released
subsequently cleaves the effector caspase-3, which finally
executes apoptosis [11]. In addition to apoptosis, caspase-8 and caspase-3 are also involved in non-apoptotic
functions. In the development of the yolk sac vasculature during mouse embryogenesis, caspase-8 restricts
the RIP3-dependent pathway rather than apoptosis [12],
and caspase-3 is required for the differentiation of
embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells
[13,14].

Another major cellular program mediated by caspases
is cytokine processing [15]. In mammals, these caspases
are distinctive due to having a caspase recruitment
domain (CARD) at the N-terminal. Caspase-1 is the
most documented of these. Caspase-1 activity is regulated by the nucleotide olimerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family members through inflammasome
formation. These multiprotein complex formations
usually require the adaptor apoptosis-associated specklike protein (ASC), which contains an N-terminal pyrin
domain (PYD) interacting with that of the NLR along
with a C-terminal CARD with caspase-1. The activated
caspase-1 controls maturation of interleukins such as
IL-1b and IL-18, which direct a wide variety of effects
related to innate immunity and host responses [16].
Homologs of the three proteins, CED-9, CED-4, and
CED-3 (Bcl-2, Apaf-1 and caspase in mammals), which
were first identified as being involved in apoptosis in
nematodes, are found in the genomes of all animals and
associated with apoptosis signaling [17]. It is logical to
expect that an apoptotic regulatory network composed
of Bcl-2, Apaf-1 and caspase had already been established in protostomes and was conserved to evolve into
the intrinsic pathway in deuterostomes. However, cytochrome c binding has not been recognized for CED-4 in
Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila Apaf-1 homolog,
Dark still remains controversial [18]. Moreover,
although a dFADD and a TNFR have been described,
such ancient TNFR lacks the death domain (DD) and
does not recruit the dFADD [19], suggesting that the
functional extrinsic apoptotic pathway does not exist in
Drosophila. In addition, the inflammasome related caspases have been reported only in vertebrates. However,
with the annotation of amphioxus immune related
genes, an expanded caspase family has been identified in
which many genes related to the extrinsic apoptosis
pathway, and some novel genes related to inflammation,
were identified. Thus, further functional analysis of the
amphioxus caspase family will help to clarify whether
the caspase-mediated extrinsic apoptosis and the caspase-dependent innate immune complex were completely formed, and what their unique features are, at the
basal chordate stage.

Results
Analysis of three caspase genes with death-fold domains
in amphioxus

Our previous annotation reported that, due to the
domain recombination and shuffling at the transition
from invertebrates to vertebrates, the amphioxus genome contains at least 45 caspase genes [20], including
18 genes related to both caspase-9 and caspase-2, 15 to
caspase-8/10, five to caspase-3/6/7, and seven to
unknown caspase genes. Based on genomic analysis,

from each of the known branches above we chose one
caspase with a conserved domain and two with novel
domain architecture for further analysis. These were
bbtCaspase-8, which is the ortholog of caspase-8 with
conserved protein architecture, bbtCaspase-1/2, which
shares the greatest similarity with caspase-2, but its prodomain contains a DED and a DD instead of a CARD
in mammalian caspase-2 (Figure 1A) and finally bbtCaspase3-like, which is 33% homologous to the human caspase-3/7 caspase domain (see Additional file 1).
To obtain clues to the functions of distinct caspases,
we performed quantitative real-time PCR to detect their
tissue distribution (Figure 1B) and responses to infection. The transcripts of all characterized caspases, especially bbtCaspase-1/2, were abundant in the hepatic
cecum, gill and gut. Since the hepatic cecum and gut
are considered as the first line of the amphioxus
immune defense system, we proposed that the caspase
family should play important roles in amphioxus immunity. In response to Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio
vulnificus challenges, the transcripts of bbtCaspase-8,
but not of bbtCaspase3-like or bbtCaspase-1/2, were
upregulated dramatically (Figures 1C and 1D). The distinct expression patterns of caspases may suggest their
diverse functions in amphioxus immunity or other roles.
Structure and function conservation of bbtCaspase-8 in
apoptosis

BbtCaspase-8 exhibits similar protein structure to its
vertebrate counterparts, including a pair of DEDs in the
prodomain and a C-terminal caspase domain (Figure
2A). To compare its function to that of human caspase,
full-length and several truncated versions of bbtCaspase8 were fused with GFP for cell localization analyses.
When expressed in HeLa cells, bbtCaspase-8-GFP protein was localized unevenly in the cytoplasm. The truncated mutant containing only the prodomain (C8-1) was
shown to have death effector filamentous structures
(DEF) [21] around the nucleus to promote cell death
(Figures 2B and 2D). The prodomain (C8-1) of bbtCaspase-8 co-localizes with bbtFADD1, but not with
bbtFADD2 (Figure 2C and Additional file 2). These
results were in agreement with our previous report that,
in HeLa cells, bbtFADD1 is expressed in the cytoplasm,
while bbtFADD2 is restricted to the nucleus [22]. To
determine if bbtCaspase-8 can induce apoptosis when
overexpressed, we investigated the binding activity of
bbtCaspase-8 transfected HeLa cells with annexin V,
which is an early hallmark of apoptosis [23]. We found
that full-length bbtCaspase-8 and two truncated mutants
can induce apparent apoptosis, and that the apoptosis
induced by full-length bbtCaspase-8 can be inhibited by
the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk (Figure 2D). In
addition, the caspase-8 activity in the transfected HeLa

cell is 1.5 to 2-fold that of the negative control (Figure
2E). The sequence comparison of catalytic domain
between bbtCaspase-8 and human caspase-8 indicated
that these two amino acid sequences share more than
50% similarities (see Additional file 3). These results
suggest that bbtCaspase-8 has substrate specificity similar to human caspase-8. Thus, we propose that bbtCaspase-8 can induce apoptosis through a direct DED-

mediated interaction with bbtFADD1 [24] resulting in
the cleavage of bbtCaspase-8 via the conservative catalytic site sequence QACQG.

like caspase domain is more similar to the effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, in spite of its DED-containing prodomain that is not linked to the reported
effector caspases (Figure 3A). Unlike mammalian caspase-3 and caspase-7, which are mainly present in cytoplasm [25], the fusion protein bbtCaspase3-like-GFP is
expressed only in the nucleus of HeLa cells, and this

localization is not required for the prodomain DED (Figure 3B). With a conserved active site, Cys330, within the
catalytic motif QSCRG [11], the full length bbtCaspase3like and the truncated mutant C3-2 lacking the prodomain were shown to promote cell death in transfected
HeLa cells, in which increased caspase-3 and caspase-8
activities were also detected (Figures 3C and 3D). The

apoptosis processes were further confirmed by visually
observable apoptotic morphology and annexin V binding
assays (Figure 3E). However, apoptosis was not completely inhibited by the caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk.
Thus, compared to mammalian caspase-3 and -7,
bbtCaspase3-like is a novel caspase with similar apoptotic activity but different protein architecture and cell
localization.
BbtCaspase-1/2 interacts with bbtFADD2 and translocates
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm depending on bbtASCs

Although phylogenetic analysis clearly showed the evolutionary relationship between bbtCaspase-1/2 and vertebrate caspase-1 and caspase-2, the domain
architecture of bbtCaspase-1/2 is novel. The N-terminal
CARD of caspase-1 and caspase-2 in both invertebrates
and vertebrates was replaced with a DED and DD in
bbtCaspase-1/2 (Figure 4A). Thus, to compare its function in amphioxus to that in vertebrates, subcellular
localization analysis was conducted. Results showed the
fusion protein bbtCaspase-1/2-GFP and the truncated

Page 6 of 13

mutants containing the DD (C2-2, C2-3, and C2-5)
located in the nucleus as dot-like or filamentous structures (Figure 4B), suggesting that the DD is essential for
nuclear localization, as is the CARD in human caspase-2
[26]. In spite of the co-localization of bbtCaspase-1/2
and amphioxus CASP2 and RIP1 domain containing
adaptor with DD (bbtCRADD) (see Additional file 4),
caspase-9 activity and apoptosis were not observed in
bbtCaspase-1/2 transfected HeLa cells [27]. However the
co-expression of bbtCaspase-1/2 and bbtFADD2 leads to
DD-dependent co-localization of the two proteins as
dot-like subcellular structures in the nucleus (Figure
4C). Sequence comparison showed a close identity
between the DDs of bbtCaspase-1/2 and bbtFADD2 (see
Additional file 5), indicating that these molecules may
be involved in the same signaling pathway. Further coimmunoprecipitation tests confirmed their interaction,
dependent on DDs (Figure 5C).
Although IL-1 proteins and ICE-like caspases are absent
in the amphioxus genome [20], we found two homologs
of mammalian ASC. Both short bbtASC (bbtASC-S) and

bbtCaspase-8 (C8-1) and bbtCaspase3-like (C3-1) did not. WB: antibody used in Western blotting analysis. Data show a representative result from
at least three separate experiments.

long bbtASC (bbtASC-L) contain an N-terminal DED
that is a substitute for a PYD in human ASC (Figure
5A) [28]. When bbtCaspase-1/2 was co-transfected in
HeLa cells with bbtASCs, the bbtCaspase-1/2 translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm and co-localized with
bbtASCs (Figure 5B,Additional files 6 and 7) [29,30].
The results of co-immunoprecipitation suggested that
bbtCaspase-1/2 interacted with bbtASCs through the
DED (Figure 5C and Additional file 2). Thus, we not
only showed the novel domain architecture of bbtCaspase-1/2, but also demonstrated that it may be involved
in apoptosis through bbtFADD2, whose apoptosis function has been characterized previously [22]. In addition,
we reported the formation of an inflammasome-like
complex through the interaction of bbtCaspase-1/2 and
bbtASC for the first time in this basal chordate.

DFDs function as protein-protein interaction facilitators
[34], the domain duplication and shuffling by recombination are probably the main force behind increased or
diversified protein functions [35]. Thus, the combining
and reshuffling of this domain type in the caspase family
provide indications of a greater diversified apoptotic network in amphioxus. This is reflected by the fact that,
unlike the reported apoptosis associated with bfCASP-3/
7, which has similar domain architecture to human caspase-3/7 [36], the apoptosis mediated by bbtCaspase3like is not completely inhibited by the inhibitor z-DEVDfmk. In addition, bbtCaspase3-like localized in the
nucleus independent of its DED, indicating that a previously unreported nuclear cell death pathway may exist
in amphioxus, which is distinct from the known caspasedependent apoptosis.

The inhibitors of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway-related
caspases block amphioxus embryogenesis in early stages

The conservation of function of bbtCaspase-8 in the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway

Apoptosis is an essential event for development and
normal metamorphosis in the metazoan [31]. However,
most caspases display low levels in the embryo and little
is known of their function in embryogenesis [32]. Immediately following fertilization, we divided embryos into
groups treated with four specific caspase inhibitors in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a group treated with
DMSO alone as a control. The embryos exposed to
either DMSO or caspase-1 inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk developed normally. At 30 h, the embryos treated with the
caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk were shorter compared to controls, and showed delayed mouth opening.
The other two inhibitors were associated with blocked
development at early stages. The effector caspase inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk stopped embryo development at the
blastula and the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk blocked
embryonic development at the morula (Figure 6).

Although organisms may have evolved distinct apoptosis
networks, some core aspects always remained. The
extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway is well known, and
was thought to be unique to vertebrates before the publication of sea urchin and amphioxus genomes. Recently,
based on ESTs and the whole genome assembly of the
ancient metazoan phylum Cnidaria, a DED-containing
caspase, a DED-containing FADD-like adaptor protein
and a potential death receptor were identified in Hydra
[33]. In Drosophila a death adapter, dFADD, which is
homologous to the mammalian FADD, was found to
bind death-related CED-3-like protein (DREDD)
through the death inducing domain (DID), a novel DFD
involved in caspase adapter interactions and promoting
cell death activity [25]. Our study identified an ortholog
of mammalian caspase-8 in Chinese amphioxus, bbtCaspase-8. This gene contains two tandem DEDs, as does
its mammalian counterpart, and also interacts with
bbtFADD1 through the DEDs to induce mammalian cell
death. These results suggest that the core molecules participating in the extrinsic pathway arose early, before the
vertebrate, and were conserved in Eumetazoa. In HeLa
cells, bbtFADD1 overexpression alone was not found to
induce apoptosis [22], and co-localized with the prodomain of bbtCaspase-8 only, indicating that FADD and
the initiator caspase evolved dependently. The FADD
proteins are likely specific to cognate initiator caspases,
but the proteolytic cascade processes of caspases are
generally conserved among species.

Discussion
The novel domain architecture of the expanded caspase
family may have led to the emergence of new apoptotic
pathways in amphioxus

Genomic annotations of several lower metazoans have
revealed an expansion of the caspase family, including 17
homologous genes in Hydra [33], 31 in the sea urchin
[32] and 45 in amphioxus [20], compared to only four in
the nematode, eight in the fly and twelve in the human.
Moreover, compared to those in vertebrates, the deathfold domain (DFD) -containing caspases in amphioxus
are expanded by seven- to ten-fold, and include many
with novel domain architectures. For example, the single
CARD in mammalian caspase-2 is replaced by a tandem
DED and DD in bbtCaspase-1/2. Although the bbtCaspase3-like caspase domain is similar to human caspase-3/
7, it unexpectedly contains an N-terminal DED. Since all

separate experiments. Values were considered to be significant when P < 0.05.

CARD within ASC recruits caspase-1 to form a complex
known as an inflammasome [11]. Although five ICE-like
genes have been found in the sea urchin genome, none
are linked to the CARD prodomain, as is the case in
vertebrates, and pro-inflammatory functions of caspases
have not been identified in sea urchins. Here, bbtCaspase-1/2 with the highest similarity to mammalian caspase-2 and caspase-1 and two ASC molecules with

novel domain architectures were identified in
amphioxus. In addition, we demonstrated that bbtASCs
interacted with bbtCaspase-1/2 and led bbtCaspase-1/2
to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. However, no effects on the maturation of IL-1b and IL-18
were observed in different mammalian cells transfected
with both bbtCaspase-1/2 and bbtASCs by ELISA testing. One of the possibilities is that the functions of

Xu et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:60
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/60

bbtCaspase-1/2 and bbtASCs could not be represented
in mammalian cell lines, since the PYD in mammalian
ASC was replaced with a DED both in bbtASC-L and
bbtASC-S and a DED and DD tandem prodomain architecture in bbtCaspase-1/2 exists only in amphioxus. To
date, there are no homologs of human IL-1 and IL-18,
which are important products of mammal inflammasomes, found in the amphioxus genome. Moreover,
from the analysis of the amphioxus genome, the PYDs
of amphioxus NLRs were also replaced by DEDs. Thus,
although the interacting basic for the inflammasome-like
complex has been established, the mechanism and the
effectors in amphioxus should be completely different
from those in mammals given their different structures.
Here, we also found that bbtCaspase-1/2 co-localizes
with bbtFADD2 in the nucleus through the DD, but not
with bbtCRADD [26]. In addition, we previously identified that translocation of bbtFADD2 from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm induces apoptosis in HeLa cells [22].
Although the underlying mechanism of bbtFADD2 and
bbtCaspase-1/2 in amphioxus apoptosis needs to be
tested in future successful cultured amphioxus cells, our
results still implied that bbtCaspase-1/2 may be involved
in an unidentified apoptotic pathway in the nucleus.
Thus, bbtCaspase-1/2, which arose from domain recombination, may have emerged as a molecular switch in
controlling the balance between caspase-dependent
innate immune response and apoptosis in the basal
chordate.
Effect of caspase related proteins on amphioxus early
embryogenesis

The cell death pathways were originally found in the
study of C. elegans and Drosophila development and are
essential for normal development of body plan and
organ structures. Some knockout gene mouse studies
have been conducted in which caspase-1 deficient mice
showed no apparent gross abnormalities [37]; caspase-2
deficient mice were devoid of severe phenotypic
abnormalities, with caspase-2 having an impact on neuron apoptosis [38]; caspase-3 and -7 deficient mice died
immediately after birth [39]; and caspase-8 deficient
mouse fetuses did not survive past mid-gestation [40].
As for amphioxus, apoptosis has been examined during
amphioxus development and one related protein,
bfCASP-3/7 has been proved to be a substrate of caspase inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk in vitro [36]. Apart from the
bfCASP-3/7 and the three caspase genes we have identified here, there are at least 40 other caspase related
genes. How such expanded caspase related proteins,
including the proteins with caspase-like proteolytic
activity, like metacaspases [41,42], are involved in
amphioxus development is not known. To address this
question, we used several specific caspase inhibitors to

Page 10 of 13

treat amphioxus embryos. The embryos treated with
caspase-1 inhibitor developed normally. It is possible
that no homolog of mammalian caspase-1 exists in the
amphioxus genome, so its inhibitor has no target in
amphioxus. Alternatively, this protein may have its
expression and function in the adult phase, associated
with the immune system, because caspase-1 is wellknown as an inflammatory caspase in vertebrates. In the
sea urchin, ICE-like caspase expression has not been
detected in either embryo or larva [32], and our RTPCR results indicate that the expression of bbtCaspase1/2 is much higher than the other two analyzed in adult
tissues. Thus, although bbtCaspase-1/2 may interact
with bbtFADD2, this potential apoptotic pathway most
likely participates in the development of gut openings
(mouth and gill slits) and body growth in larvae, but
does not influence early embryogenesis, as was seen in
the group treated with the caspase-2 inhibitor. Caspase
has been reported to show earliest expression in the
mesoderm of the gastrula [43], and bfCASP-3/7 is
expressed from gastrula to larva [36]. Overexpression of
bfCASP-3/7 induced mammalian cell apoptosis and the
inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk blocked its activity [36]. All of
these evidences suggested that bfCASP-3/7 is likely to
be one of the effector caspase related proteins inhibited
by z-DEVD-fmk in embryogenesis. Moreover, bbtCaspase-8 induced HeLa cell apoptosis and such activity
can be inhibited by z-IETD-fmk, indicating that z-IETDfmk may inhibit the activities of caspase-8 related proteins during embryogenesis. In addition, we found that
initiator caspases-related proteins may function before
effector caspases. Thus, these caspases mediate extrinsic
apoptosis, which is indispensable in early embryogenesis,
probably by inducing cell differentiation and embryonic
layer formation.

Conclusions
Our studies not only indicated that the function of DRmediated extrinsic apoptosis is conserved and completely formed in amphioxus, but also provided the first
evidence of the interacting foundation for the inflammasome-like complex in a non-vertebrate. An interesting
point is that many amphioxus caspase genes possess
novel domain architectures, which provides important
insights into understanding how new signaling pathways
emerged along with domain recombination and shuffling, especially at the transition from invertebrates to
vertebrates.
Methods
Animals and embryos

Adult Chinese amphioxus (Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense) were obtained from Kioachow Bay near Qingdao, China. During May and June, ripe males and

Xu et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:60
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/60

females, after a 14:10 h light:dark cycle at 22°C for at
least seven days, were induced to spawn by thermal
shock at 26°C for 36 h. Subsequently, the animals were
placed individually in plastic bottles with a small
amount of filtered seawater and held in dark. Spawning
was checked every hour using red light and the eggs
and sperm collected. After in vitro fertilization, isogenous embryos were divided into five groups, four treated
with a different caspase inhibitor (Merck, NJ, USA) at
50 μM in DMSO and one with DMSO alone. The
embryos were allowed to develop to the desired stage at
23°C.
Sequence retrieval, structural and phylogenetic analyses

The protein sequences of the caspase family were used
to perform BLASTp searches against all databases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and the DOE Joint Genome Institute. Domain
searches were performed against the PROSITE. Protein
sequences were first aligned using ClustalX 1.83 and
manually corrected using GeneDoc. Then, the neighbor
joining tree was obtained using the routine in MEGA
3.1 with 1000 bootstrap tests.
Cloning of bbtCaspase-8, bbtCaspase-1/2, and
bbtCaspase3-like cDNAs

Full-length cDNA sequences of three genes were identified in the total cDNA library of Chinese amphioxus.
For each, a partial sequence was cloned from Chinese
amphioxus cDNA using a specific primer pair derived
from B. floridae. Subsequently, 5’-rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE) and 3’-RACE were performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol of the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen, USA). After sequencing and manual
alignment, we obtained the full-length sequences of
bbtCaspase-8, bbtCaspase-1/2, and bbtCaspase3-like.
Then, gene specific primers were designed and fulllength cDNA sequences of the three amphioxus caspases were obtained from the cDNA library of adult
Chinese amphioxus and inserted into T easy vectors for
following vectors constructions. Human caspases were
cloned following similar procedures with the primers
derived from GenBank. BbtCaspase-8, bbtCaspase-1/2
and bbtCaspase3-like sequences have been deposited in
the GenBank database [GenBank:JF717867]; [GenBank:
JF717868]; [GenBank:JF717869].
Cell lines and expression plasmids

HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO, USA). The ORF and
PCR fragments encoding for amino acids 1-193 and
194-606 of bbtCaspase-8; 1-90, 1-226, 91-226, 227-544,
91-544 and 1-90aa+227-544aa of bbtCaspase-1/2; 1-100
and 101-446 of bbtCaspase3-like were cloned by PCR

Page 11 of 13

and inserted into vectors pEGFP-N1 and pCMV (Clontech, USA) with a N-terminal HA or FLAG epitope tag,
respectively, and designated C8-1, C8-2; C2-1, C2-2, C23, C2-4, C2-5, C2-6; C3-1, and C3-2. The ORFs of
hsCaspase-3 and hsCaspase-8 were inserted into vectors
pEGFP-N1 and pCMV respectively.
Real-time PCR

Either 105 colony forming units (CFU) of S. aureus or V.
vulnificus in PBS were injected into the amphioxus
celom and cultured in separate tanks. The challenged
animals were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h
post-injection. The protocol for the control animals
injected with PBS only followed the same schedule.
Intestine from five individuals were combined in a single
sample for total RNA extraction and subjected to
reverse transcription (TOYOBO, Japan). Total RNA
from various tissues of un-challenged Chinese
amphioxus were extracted and treated with the same
way. The 208 bp product of bbtCaspase-8 was amplified
by primer pair: 5’-GTCATCGTCAACAACAAAC-3’ and
5’-TGGAGTGGTCTTCATAGC-3’; the 113 bp product
of bbtCaspase-1/2 was amplified by primer pair: 5’TTAAGAGCGAGATGAGAAG-3’ and 5’-TAGTTGT
GTTGCGTATCC-3’; the 186 bp product of bbtCapase3-like was amplified by primer pair: 5’-GGAGATGGAACAGGATGAG-3’ and 5’-GAAGACGAGGA
CGATTGG-3’. All samples were analyzed by RT-PCR in
triplicate under the following conditions: 2 min at 95°C
followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 15 s at 60°C, and
20 s at 72°C. Data were quantified with the 2 -ΔΔCt
method based on Ct values of bbtCaspase-8, bbtCaspase-1/2, bbtCaspase3-like and b-actin from two parallel
experiments done in triplicate. For expression following
challenge, folds were normalized to the expression in
PBS-injected animals. Values were considered to be significant at P < 0.05.
Immunofluorescence imaging

HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips (10 mm × 10 mm)
in a 24-well plate for more than 12 h and transfected
with the indicated expression plasmids using jetPEI
(Polyplus Transfection, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty to twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde
solution for 15 min. Coverslips were washed with PBST
(0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) three times and blocked with
5% BSA in PBST at room temperature for one hour.
Primary monoclonal antibodies (Sigma, USA) were
added at 1 mg/mL in blocking buffer for 1 hr, and secondary antibodies (1:5000) (Invitrogen, USA) were
added for 1 h with three washes between each step.
Samples were finally stained with 0.2 μg/mL 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 5 min, washed

Xu et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:60
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/60

three times in PBS and mounted in MOWIOL R4-88
Reagent (Calbiochem, USA). Fluorescence images were
photographed with a Zeiss AxioVision 4 microscope (63
× objective) with appropriate filters.
Annexin V binding apoptosis assay

HeLa cells were cultured in 12-well plates and transfected with 2 μg fused plasmids in pCMV vector for
each well. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and collected for analysis with the PE Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were analyzed by a BD FACSCaliburTM cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). For each
sample, 10,000 gated events were required. Annexin V
positive cells were considered apoptotic, and the sample
transfected empty pCMV vectors were used as a negative control. The positive control was treated with
camptothecin (Sigma) at 10 μM for 24 h. Camptothecin
was freshly dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and further
diluted in DMEM before each experiment.
Caspase activity assay

HeLa cells were cultured in 48-well plates and transfected with 400 ng/well of indicated plasmids. At 20 h
post-transfection, the caspase activity of all samples was
measured by Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay or Caspase-Glo®
8 Assay (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples transfected empty vectors were used as negative controls and transfected
human caspases were positive controls.
Co-immunoprecipitation

HeLa cells in 6-well dishes were transfected with 4 μg of
indicated plasmids in each well (2 μg/each expression
vector). More than 24 h after transfection, the whole
cell extracts were prepared in immunoprecipitation lysis
buffer [50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 Mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet
P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid sodium salt, and cocktail
protease inhibitor (Roche, Germany)] and incubated
with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, then incubated
with Protein G Sepharose (Roche) at 4°C for 4-6 h. The
mix was washed three times with lysis buffer. Analysis
was conducted using SDS-PAGE followed by Western
blot with enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Pharmacia, Finland). The monoclonal antibody
against HA epitope tag (1:5000), FLAG epitope tag
(1:1000), and the anti-mouse secondary antibody
(1:5000) were purchased from Sigma.
