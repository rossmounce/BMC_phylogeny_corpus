Mastacembelid eels support Lake Tanganyika as an
evolutionary hotspot of diversification

Abstract
Background: Lake Tanganyika (LT) is the oldest of the African Rift Lakes and is one of the richest freshwater ecosystems
on Earth, with high levels of faunal diversity and endemism. The endemic species flocks that occur in this lake, such as
cichlid fishes, gastropods, catfish and crabs, provide unique comparative systems for the study of patterns and
processes of speciation. Mastacembelid eels (Teleostei: Mastacembelidae) are a predominately riverine family of
freshwater fish, occurring across Africa and Asia, but which also form a small species flock in LT.
Methods: Including 25 species across Africa, plus Asian representatives as outgroups, we present the first molecular
phylogenetic analysis for the group, focusing particularly on the evolutionary history and biodiversity of LT
mastacembelid eels. A combined matrix of nuclear and mitochondrial genes based on 3118 bp are analysed
implementing different phylogenetic methods, including Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood.
Results: LT Mastacembelus are recovered as monophyletic, and analyses reveal the rapid diversification of five main LT
lineages. Relaxed molecular clock dates provide age estimates for the LT flock at ~7-8 Myr, indicating intralacustrine
diversification, with further speciation events coinciding with periods of lower lake level. Our analyses also reveal as yet
undescribed diversity of lacustrine and riverine species. A Southern-Eastern African clade, that is younger than the LT
flock, is also recovered, while West African taxa are basal members of the African mastacembelid clade.
Conclusions: That the LT species flock of mastacembelid eels appears to have colonised and immediately diversified
soon after the formation of the lake, supports the view of LT as an evolutionary hotspot of diversification. We find
evidence for biogeographic clades mirroring a similar pattern to other ichthyological faunas. In addition, our analyses
also highlight a split of African and Asian mastacembelid eels at ~19 Myr that is considerably younger than the split
between their associated continents, suggesting a dispersal scenario for their current distribution.
Background
The African Great lakes provide natural experimental
settings in which to better understand the processes that
underlie speciation. Lake Tanganyika (LT), the oldest
African rift lake (9-12 Myr) [1], is one of the world's richest freshwater ecosystems (c. 2000 species) [2]. It harbours numerous different endemic faunas (c. 600 species)
[2], supporting more endemic non-cichlid species than
any of the other African Great Lakes, many of which form
evolutionary radiations, termed 'species flocks' [3]. The
most impressive of these are represented by cichlid fishes
[4]; however, unique to LT, and possibly a consequence of
its older geological history, are the multiple radiations,

that have evolved from a variety of taxonomic lineages,
e.g., gastropods, crabs, catfish, spiny-eels, sponges, atyid
prawns and ostracods. Molecular phylogenetics and
molecular dating techniques have enabled inferences to
be made of colonisation and diversification histories,
which have alternatively supported the perception of LT
as a hotspot of diversification [5-7], as well as an evolutionary reservoir [8,9]. The existence of multiple radiations of unrelated faunas within an island-like setting that
display differing life histories and ecologies, offers a
unique comparative opportunity to study the dynamics of
radiations and the importance of this lake as a cradle of
speciation. Through this system we can begin to ascertain
the relative importance of extrinsic versus intrinsic processes in the context of adaptive radiation theory [10,11].
Species diversification within LT has manifested in the
form of large scale super-flocks such as the well-studied

cichlid fishes containing ~200-250 species [12,13] as well
as the thiarid gastropods [14], containing ~70 species.
However, the majority of taxa form small-scale faunal
radiations at the generic level, containing between 10-15
species. Because of the high levels of interest in cichlid
fishes as model organisms in which to investigate speciation processes, non-cichlid flocks have been largely overlooked. Recently, however, different authors have begun
to address this from a molecular phylogenetic perspective
to determine timing of diversification, as well as colonisation history, e.g. Synodontis catfish [7,15,16], Platythelphusa crabs [6], and thiarid gastropods [9,14].
To-date, the evolutionary history of the LT species
flocks reveals both similarities and differences, although
inconsistencies as a consequence of molecular dating may
exacerbate these disparities. For example, LT cichlid
tribes (based on fossil calibrations [12]), Synodontis catfish [7,15], Platythelphusa crabs [6] and Lavigeria gastropods [9] all show within-lake diversification supporting
the notion of LT as a hotspot of diversification. In contrast, the majority of gastropod diversity found within LT
has evolved from lineages that predate its formation [9].
A similar pattern was also hypothesized for the LT cichlid
fish tribes, indicative of multiple independent colonisation events into LT [8,17]. This scenario is further supported if Gondwanan vicariance dates are enforced to
calibrate molecular time estimates [12,18]. However, that
colonisation history differs between faunal groups
appears largely to be a consequence of comparing different taxonomic units. Platythelphusa crabs represent a
single colonisation event followed by subsequent diversification [6], while Synodontis also form a flock within LT,
but with the inclusion of a non-endemic species that
appears to represent evolution within the lake followed
by emigration [15]. That these unrelated groups exhibit
different evolutionary histories makes the analysis of
other taxonomic groups, using robust phylogenetic
methods important in furthering the understanding of
the role of LT as a potential diversification hotspot.
Mastacembelids or spiny-eels (Teleostei: Synbranchiformes) is a predominately riverine family [19],
with an Old World distribution throughout tropical
Africa and Asia (~78 species), although the majority of
species occur in Africa (68%). Based on morphology,
there is little evidence for the separation of mastacembelids into two subfamilies [20], or African species into
three genera [21-23] and therefore we refer to all African
species as Mastacembelus. Little is known about mastacembelids in terms of their phylogeny, ecology and life
history, and this is even more apparent in the species that
have formed a radiation within LT. This is, in part,
because of their cryptic and predominately rock-dwelling
nature making them difficult to study. Aside from the LT
radiation, the only other African region with a compara-

ble number of endemic sympatric species is in the lower
Congo River [24], making these species assemblages of
interest with regards to the factors promoting and maintaining elevated levels of endemicity. Here we focus on
the LT species flock.
There are currently 13 described mastacembelid species endemic to LT [25], as opposed to a single (possibly
two) endemic species within Lake Malawi [26,27]. This
asymmetry is also seen in other groups that form radiations in Tanganyika but not Malawi (e.g. Synodontis catfish), although notably Lake Malawi Bathyclarias catfish
form a small species flock [28]. Despite the age and size of
Lake Malawi, and the fact that, like LT, it supports a largescale radiation of cichlids [29], this asymmetry between
the two lakes in species diversity of Mastacembelus and
Synodontis is noteworthy. Potential factors, such as the
repeated periods of desiccation experienced in Lake
Malawi [30,31], or niche availability with the presence of
an extensive cichlid radiation, may have impinged on the
abilities of other faunas to diversify.
Here, using a multigene dataset of mitochondrial
(mtDNA; Cytochrome b [Cyt b], Cytochrome c oxidase
sub-unit 1 [CO1]) and nuclear (ncDNA; ribosomal S7
introns 1 and 2 [S7]), and several methods of phylogenetic inference and relaxed-clock dating we present the
first molecular phylogenetic analysis of Mastacembelus
eels (Additional file 1, Table S1). We focus on LT species,
to investigate their diversity, monophyly and colonisation
history, in order to infer whether small-scale radiations
are more likely to diversify in intralacustrine conditions,
as opposed to having diversified outside of the lake basin,
and discuss our results in a comparative framework. As
such the majority of sampling is from LT (including 11 of
the 13 currently described species) and associated catchments. In addition almost half of all described African
mastacembelid diversity is included, along with two
Asian mastacembelid species as outgroups, in order that
we can evaluate the LT species flock in the broader context of mastacembelid biogeography and evolutionary
history.

Results and Discussion
Sequence analysis

The preferred evolutionary models, calculated using
Modeltest v3.7 [32], are GTR+I+Γ for the Cyt b datatset,
HKY+I+Γ for both S7 and CO1 datasets, and TrN+I+Γ
for the concatenated dataset. The nucleotide base composition (A: C: G: T) for each molecular marker is as follows: 27.5: 36.1: 11.6: 24.8% (Cyt b), 26.9: 18.4: 24.4: 30.3%
(S7), and 31.0: 30.3: 12.8: 25.9% (CO1). The bias against
guanine in Cyt b has also been reported in other fish taxa
[33]. The χ2 test of homogeneity demonstrated that there
was no significant difference in base frequencies between
ingroup taxa (χ2 values of 103.5, 39.1 and 40.8, with 231,

210 and 240 degrees of freedom for Cyt b, S7 and CO1
respectively, p < 0.05). The data were combined in a total
evidence approach, with the total matrix consisting of
3118 bp [1206 bp from Cyt b (of which 70 bp from tRNA);
1129-1162 bp (1224 bp aligned) from S7 (1st intron 853906 bp, 2nd intron 233-263 bp); and 688 bp from CO1].
Data were missing for the 2nd intron of S7 for 12 specimens.
Phylogenetic relationships and biodiversity

The Maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BI) trees
generated from the concatenated dataset resolved virtually identical topologies, with neither tree being assigned
as a better fit to the data than the other (AU test, p =
0.500). The concatenated and single gene datasets also
yielded largely congruent tree topologies (see Additional
files 2, 3 and 4 for individual gene trees), although all
individual datasets demonstrated a significantly worse fit
to the data when compared to the concatenated dataset
(AU test, p = 0.008 for Cyt b, and p = 0.000 for both S7
and CO1 BI trees). CO1 performed well for species-level
identifications, but sister species and deeper-level relationships were poorly supported, making it of limited use
for phylogenetic analysis. In terms of the use of CO1 for
DNA taxonomy, it faired less well in terms of resolution
and support than Cyt b for Mastacembelus. This lack of
resolution between deeper nodes was also reported with
CO1 in LT thiarid gastropods, with this being attributable
to either the marker evolving too rapidly for resolving
deeper systematic levels, or the rapid simultaneous evolution of major clades resulting in similar levels of sequence
divergence [14].
Support for sister species relationships was also lower
in the ncDNA S7 than Cyt b single gene analyses. It is
possible that S7 could be evolving too slowly to resolve
the sister species relationships within LT. This is also the
case for Synodontis [15], despite this gene having proved
useful in elucidating cichlid relationships of a similar age
[34]. Combining the data into one concatenated dataset
improved support in all parts of the tree (Fig. 1).
Our analyses recover a well-supported LT Mastacembelus flock (node A, Fig. 1), composed of five main lineages (nodes labelled B-F, Fig. 1). However, while
relationships within these lineages are well supported, the
relationships between them are poorly supported, resulting in a basal polytomy. The use of more rapidly evolving
markers (e.g. AFLPs) is likely to further elucidate the relationships between species within the LT radiation, as
demonstrated for rapidly speciating clades [35-38]. If,
however, the data do represent a true hard polytomy, we
interpret this result to suggest early rapid speciation of
this clade in to new available niches, indicative of an
adaptive radiation [10]. Short branches are also found
within the Platythelphusa crabs [6] and LT Synodontis

[7,15] also indicating a similar rapid diversification in
these clades.
Molecular phylogenetic analyses reveal greater diversity of the spiny-eel species flock than morphological
studies, with 13 species recovered. Our analyses reveal
cryptic diversity within M. platysoma, forming two distinct clades, pertaining to specimens occurring in the
northern (M. platysoma; Kigoma, Tanzania) and southern (M. aff. platysoma; Mpulungu, Zambia) basins, with
the type locality being in the northern basin (Luhanga,
Democratic Republic of Congo). These two putative species exhibit high morphological similarity. An apparent
lack of morphological diversity could be attributable to
non-adaptive speciation, but morphometric work would
be required in order to quantify phenotypic diversity.
Despite this apparent conservatism in body plan, these
two M. platysoma clades have a relatively high genetic
distance, comparable to other LT Mastacembelus sister
species (Cyt b ML pairwise distances of 5.7%, compared
to the mean sister species distance of 5.1%), which is also
within the range recorded for other fish genera [33], e.g.
Lamprologus, Neolamprologus.
Recent morphological work [25] split M. albomaculatus into two species, describing M. reygeli as a distinct
species, whilst also suggesting the presence of intermediate populations, hypothesised to be a result of introgressive hybridisation. These authors record both M.
albomaculatus and M. reygeli as being confined to the
central and northern parts of the lake, with their hypothesised 'intermediate' occurring throughout the lake. The
seven M. albomaculatus (sensu lato) specimens from
southern LT included in our analyses would therefore
have to be representative of the putative intermediate
group sensu Vreven and Snoeks [25]. However, using
both mtDNA and ncDNA, we found no genetic differences between the southern 'intermediate' group, and the
M. albomaculatus from the northern part of the lake, and
therefore no evidence of support for the hybridisation
hypothesis of Vreven and Snoeks [25]. More extensive
molecular sampling would however be useful to address
the issue of hybridisation in LT mastacemblids, that has
also been proposed in non-LT mastacembelids [39] but
not tested. Notably, introgressive hybridisation is increasingly well documented in LT cichlids [34,40-42].
Colonisation history of the LT mastacembelid flock

Irrespective of dating method we find that the mastacembelid eels colonised LT ~ 7-8 Myr (BEAST analysis, 7.9
Myr, 95% HPD [highest posterior distribution]: 5.5-10.6
Myr; r8s analysis, 7.3 Myr, 95% HPD: 4.61-12.9 Myr). As
the results using the two methods of dating are largely
congruent, we present results from the BEAST analysis
(Fig. 2). If the median dates of our estimate are correct,
then Mastacembelus colonised and diversified in the LT

basin after its formation (9-12 Myr) [1], but prior to full
lacustrine conditions (5-6 Myr) [43], although the lower
dating estimate occurs post deep-water conditions, corroborating the hypothesis that LT is a diversification
hotspot. Our results imply that the LT Mastacembelus
radiation pre-dates both Synodontis catfish 4.0-7.3 Myr
[7,15] and Platythelphusa crabs ~2.5-3.3 Myr [6]. Dating
cichlid radiations is problematic and has led to two divergent timescales, based on either a vicariance calibration
linked to the breakup of Gondwana, or a calibration
based on the cichlid fossil record [18], placing the cichlid
diversification at 28 Myr and 12 Myr respectively. These
timescales either favour a scenario in which the majority
of cichlid tribes were diversifying prior to the formation
of LT, or that the tribes diversified in lacustrine conditions respectively [12,41]. Although the Lavigeria gastropod lineage predates the formation of the LT basin [9],
this genus appears to have radiated in a similar time window as LT Mastacembelus i.e. after the formation of the
LT basin, but before full lacustrine conditions.
Diversification of the main Mastacembelus lineages
occurred contemporaneously at ~6.2-7.2 Myr, soon after
their initial seeding of the lake. This initial diversification
upon colonising LT is also apparent in Tropheus cichlids
[44], and represents a short lag time, or phylogenetic 'tail'
[45]. Following the initial post-colonisation divergence,
there are further contemporaneous speciation events 3-4
Myr. The split of M. platysoma and M. aff. platysoma
occurs around 3.5 Myr, coinciding with the estimated formation of the southern basin of LT ~2-4 Myr [1], and a
period of lower lake-levels, caused by an episode of aridification [46]. The clades (M. micropectus, M. sp. nov. 1)
and (M. ellipsifer (M. flavidus (M. zebratus, M. plagiostomus))) also arose during this time of lake-level change, as
do internal lineages within LT Synodontis [7,15] and
Platythelphusa [6] radiations. The coinciding of speciation events in unrelated taxa with an extrinsic event, indicates that this period of lower lake-level is likely to have
been a key factor responsible for promoting speciation
conditions; for example, repeated segmentation and
recombination of habitats along the rocky shorelines,
caused by these fluctuations in water level, is likely to
have resulted in the allopatric speciation of these LT radiations.
Non-endemics

As with Synodontis catfish that form a LT species flock of
10 endemic plus one non-endemic species, the LT Mastacembelus flock is also purported to consist of endemic,
plus one non-endemic species [47]. However, no specimens of the non-endemic M. frenatus collected from LT
were available for inclusion in our analysis. The type
locality of this species is the north of LT [48] and it has
been recorded to occur in the catchment basin of LT,

Page 6 of 11

Lake Victoria and throughout the Upper Zambezi and
Okavango River basins [49]. However, more recent work
suggests that M. frenatus is not part of the LT ichthyofauna, and may not occur in the lake itself [50]. M. frenatus specimens from both the Malagarasi and Idete rivers
in Tanzania differ markedly, and are not included within
the LT flock. It therefore seems unlikely that M. frenatus
evolved within LT and subsequently emigrated, as has
been demonstrated to be the case with the non-endemic
S. victoriae, a member of the Synodontis flock [7,15]. It
could be reasonable to assume instead that M. frenatus
(sensu stricto) as described from LT [48] may either have
independently colonised the lake, or, if present in the lake
at all, M. frenatus could represent further cryptic diversity, with the LT species being distinct from that in the
surrounding rivers. Further morphological and molecular
work is required in order to ascertain the diversity and
taxonomy of this species complex, and its correct positioning within the group.
African Biogeography

Analogous to Vreven [20], we found no evidence to support the genera proposed by Travers [21,23], with neither
Aeithomastacembelus nor Caecomastacembelus forming
monophyletic groupings (illustrated by symbols on Fig.
1). As such these names should be placed in synonymy
with Mastacembelus. However, there is evidence for biogeographic clades. Mastacembelids have a similar distribution to other ichthyological groups, such as
Synondontis catfish and cichlid fishes [19]. The Southern
and Eastern African Mastacembelus species form a
monophyletic group (node G on Fig. 1 and 2), consisting
of three distinct biogeographic regions; i) Lake Malawi
(M. shiranus), ii) East Africa (M. frenatus [Tanzania]); iii)
Southern Africa (M. vanderwaali and M. sp. nov. 3
[Namibia], M. cf. frenatus [DR Congo and Namibia], M.
stappersii [Zambia]). M. signatus, however, despite
occurring in the Chambeshi River and Lake Bangwelu
(both in Zambia), is resolved outside of the Southern and
Eastern African clade, nesting with West African species
(e.g. Cameroon, Sierra Leone). Unlike the species in the
Southern-Eastern clade, M. signatus is not endemic to
Southern/Eastern Africa, but has a distribution that
extends from the Congo basin, which would therefore
explain its West African affinities. It appears that Mastacembelus display a similar biogeographic pattern to Synodontis, which also form a Southern African clade [15].
Further comparative work would highlight patterns of
speciation that are common to these two species-rich
genera.
The ancestor to the Southern-Eastern clade appeared at
~11.9 Myr (8.7-15.9 Myr), but did not diversify until ~5
Myr (3.2-7.8 Myr) after a relatively long lag-time, which is
younger than the LT flock. This could be due to incom-

Brown et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:188
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/188

plete taxonomic sampling, although this pattern is again
evident in Synodontis [15], which also demonstrate a long
lag-time leading to the rapid speciation within Southern
Africa. This may suggest a common vicariance cause,
such as changes in drainage basin structure and patterns
of flow, but could be further addressed with more extensive sampling from this region. The Lake Malawi
endemic, M. shiranus, colonised at ~3.9 Myr, post deep
water conditions (4.5 Myr) [30,51]. In our analysis, West
African species are recovered as basal and are paraphyletic. The non-monophyly of West African taxa may however be a consequence of our limited taxonomic sampling
in this region, particularly of the lower Congo River,
which has a high level of sympatric diversity, again highlighting a need for further work to more completely
address the issue of regional biogeographic clades within
the African Mastacembelus.
Africa-Asia biogeography

The African-Asia distribution demonstrated by mastacembelid eels is a biogeographic pattern that is only
observed in a few freshwater fish families, e.g. Anabantidae [52], Bagridae and Clariidae catfish [19], with the
vicariance of Gondwana suggested as one possible explanation for this type of current-day distribution. However,
use of this vicariance date (121-165 Myr) [53] often generates much older dates than either palaeontological or
molecular data supports [e.g. [18]], and alternative
hypotheses have been suggested. The African mastacembelids are monophyletic with respect to the two Asian
species included, with the most recent common ancestor
of the African mastacembelids dating back to ~19 Myr
(13.5-27.3 Myr; Fig. 2 node H), long after the Gondwana
continental break up. The median of this range estimate
coincides with the closure of the Tethys Sea c. 18-20 Myr
in the Early Miocene, which has been suggested as an
alternative hypothesis explaining the distributions of
other, albeit terrestrial, taxa [e.g. proboscideans, [54]].
The current distribution of mastacembelid eels encompasses the Middle East [19], and could be indicative of
support for this hypothesis, although no samples from
this region were available for inclusion in our analyses,
highlighting a need for further testing in the future.

Conclusions
The endemic LT Mastacembelus eel radiation is an
important assemblage for studying comparative lacustrine systems, as it is divergent in life history to those
already studied within the Great Lakes. The use of molecular phylogenetic techniques has revealed as yet undescribed diversity, with our data providing evidence for
two potentially new LT species (M. aff. platysoma and M.
sp. nov. 1). The LT Mastacembelus demonstrates both
similarities and differences in patterns of speciation when

Page 7 of 11

compared to other LT radiations. For example, the origination of LT Mastacembelus via a single colonisation
event is also demonstrated by Platythelphusa crabs [6]
and Cyprichromis cichlids [12]. Using fossil calibrations
from a related family, our results indicate Mastacembelus
colonised the lake ~7.9 Myr, and is therefore an older
radiation than Synodontis catfish, Platythelphusa crabs,
and many cichlid tribes (e.g. Cyprichromini, Tropheini,
Ectodini) if fossil dates are assumed [12]. This puts the
origin of LT Mastacembelus within the age of the LT
basin, but prior to the onset of full lacustrine conditions.
Their radiation within lacustrine conditions does however further demonstrate LT as a hotspot of diversification, as opposed to an 'ancient evolutionary reservoir.' As
demonstrated by other ichthyological faunas with lacustrine and fluviatile distributions (e.g. Synodontis catfish
and cichlid fishes), our data also highlights evidence of
distinct biogeographic clades. At a deeper phylogenetic
level, we find evidence for an Africa-Asia split of mastacembelid eels (~19 Myr) occurring long after the divergence of the associated continents (121-165 Myr). This
divergence coincides with the closure of the Tethys Sea
and we therefore suggest a dispersal scenario for this
group, which should be validated in the future with
increased taxon sampling.

Methods
Taxonomic sampling

To maximise species coverage and to test species validity,
samples were collected from 16 LT localities, encompassing both the southern and northern basins, resulting in
49 samples from 11 out of the 13 currently described
endemic species. No DNA samples were available for M.
polli and the newly described M. reygeli [25]. In order to
test monophyly of the LT species flock and biogeographic
scenarios a further 31 samples, from 14 non-LT African
species were also included in the analyses, representing
48% of the currently described African species [19]. Two
Asian mastacembelid species were included as outgroup
taxa. Specimens were collected from rivers and lakes
using a variety of methods, including fyke nets, scubadiving, electro-fishing, and rotenone [55]. The latter
method is particularly effective for collecting mastacembelid eels from crevices and rocky habitats (pers. obs.).
Voucher numbers, collection localities, and GenBank
accession numbers are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing

DNA was extracted from fin clips or white muscle tissue
using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, UK). The use
of more than one independent marker is important in
order to resolve different levels of the phylogeny and provide a more complete evolutionary picture of species
relationships [56,57]. Here, we sequence three molecular

Brown et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:188
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/188

markers, including both mitochondrial and nuclear data:
the mitochondrial genes Cyt b and CO1, and two introns
of the ribosomal nuclear marker S7.
Cyt b has proved useful for elucidating both relatively
deep-level and shallow time relationships in other
teleosts [58], including percids [59] anabantoids [52], as
well as other Lake Tanganyika species flocks [7]. It was
shown to be a more informative marker for evaluating
relationships of Tanganyikan Synodontis catfish [15] as
opposed to ND2 and control region [16], although Cyt b
can also be problematic in its use as a phylogenetic
marker, e.g. in terms of saturation in the third codon
position [60]. Nuclear genes are generally more slowly
evolving, although the ribosomal gene S7 has been used
in studies of other LT fishes, e.g. Synodontis catfish [15]
and cichlids [34]. It has also been demonstrated to be useful at the sub-familial level, such as for the Mormyridae
electric fishes [61]. The bar-coding gene CO1 [62-64],
was also sequenced in order to ascertain whether Mastacembelus species could be delineated by this ~650 base
pair mitochondrial fragment.
Published primers were used to amplify introns 1 and 2
of S7 (1224 bp aligned) [65], and the barcoding region of
the CO1 gene (688 bp) [66] using annealing temperatures
of 55 and 52°C respectively. Cyt b (1206 bp) was amplified
using the primers MNCN-Glu F [67] and MNCN-Fish
Pro R (5'-AGT TTA ATT TAG AAT YTT RGC TTT GG3'; R Zardoya and L Rüber) using an annealing temperature of 48°C. PCR products were cleaned, and sequenced
with an ABI 3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, UK).
All sequences are deposited in GenBank, and accession
numbers are given in Additional file 1, Table S1.
Phylogenetic Analyses

The S7 sequence data were aligned in Clustal W [68]
using default parameters, and indel regions were finished
by eye in Se-Al [69]. Cyt b and CO1 sequences were
aligned by eye using Se-Al.
Analyses were performed on individual gene datasets
and a concatenated Cyt b, S7 and CO1 matrix in a total
evidence approach [70]. MODELTEST v 3.7 [32] was
used to ascertain the best model of molecular evolution
for each dataset, selected under Akaike Information Criterion [71,72]. Variation in base composition between the
taxa was assessed using the χ2 test of homogeneity, implemented in PAUP* [73].
Different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction were
performed in order to assess congruence between phylogenies produced by alternative methods, for both the
concatenated and individual gene datasets. Maximum
Likelihood (ML) analyses were performed using GARLI
(Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference) v0.96
[74], with model substitution rates from Modeltest
applied. Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses were imple-

mented in Mr Bayes [75], with partitions defined according to codons and genes, run for 2,000,000 generations
and sampling every 100 generations, with an initial burnin set to 5000 (chain temperature 0.2, four chains). Convergence of Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) runs was assessed graphically using
TRACER [76], and any remaining burn-in chains [77]
were discarded prior to tree construction, resulting in
7500 post burn-in trees. Nodal support was ascertained
with bootstrapping (BS) [78] for ML trees (1000 replicates), and Bayesian Posterior Probabilities (BPP) for the
BI trees. The Approximately Unbiased (AU) [79] test as
implemented in CONSEL [80] was used to test alternative topologies generated by different methods of phylogenetic inference.
Estimation of Divergence Times

The Synbranchiformes have no fossil record that can be
used in molecular dating analyses. Here, we use sequence
and fossil data from a hypothesised sister group to the
Synbranchiformes to provide a calibration for our study.
Following Chen et al. [81], the Synbranchiformes are
closely related to the Channoidei (Snakeheads) and Anabantoidae (labyrinth fishes) (Order Perciformes). The fossil record of Channoidei in Africa (genus Parachanna)
dates back to the late Eocene [82], approximately 35-33
Myr, and this date was used to constrain the Parachanna
node. As the fossil Parachanna could not be reliably
assigned to any of the extant species of Parachanna, the
calibration was placed on the stem group, rather than the
crown group [83,84]. Use of a single calibration is
regarded as a limitation in molecular dating [85,86], particularly when calibrations involve outgroup taxa that are
some distance from the nodes of interest [87,88]. However, for studies focused at lower taxonomic levels (i.e.
genus or family) where fossil data is highly limited, multiple calibrations are unrealistic. While some authors [18]
have utilised vicariance dates to obtain dates of lineage
divergences, such calibrations (along with lake ages)
within this study would not provide an independent
means of testing age of colonisation nor biogeographic
scenarios. Cyt b sequence data from Channa and
Parachanna species (Channoidei: Teleostei) were downloaded from Genbank (Additional file 1, Table S1).
The Likelihood Ratio Test [89], implemented in PAUP*
with and without the molecular clock enforced, demonstrates heterogeneity in the rates of evolution across the
Mastacembelidae (-ln likelihood of 21202.3 and 21077.2
respectively, ratio = 250.2, d.f. = 86, p < 0.05), and the use
of non-clock-like settings (relaxed molecular clock in
BEAST [90], penalised likelihood (PL) [91] method in r8s
[92]) was appropriate for use in the dating analyses to
convert relative molecular divergence to absolute ages.
Analyses in BEAST used an uncorrelated log-normal

Brown et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:188
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/188

relaxed molecular clock [93], Yule speciation prior,
GTR+I+Γ model, and were run for 100,000,000 generations, with every 10,000 parameters logged. To ascertain
the effect of using different priors, the analyses were
repeated with the fossil constraint set to both uniform
and normal distribution, and with and without partitioning the third codon. To check for the amount of burn-in,
run convergence, and that the effective sample size
exceed 200 for each statistic, each run was assessed
graphically in Tracer v. 1.4.1 [76]. Analyses run using the
uniform distribution prior on the calibrated node exhibited better stabilisation and convergence than those run
with a normal distribution prior, so we present the former
results. In order to compare the effects of different methods of estimating divergence times, the analysis was also
run using r8s, using PL method [91,94]. The optimal
smoothing parameter for the PL analysis was calculated
in r8s by cross-validation and assessing the resulting χ2
error. 95% confidence intervals in r8s were obtained by
generating 100 bootstrap replicates and converting the
topologically constrained phylograms in to penalised
likelihood trees [92,95].
