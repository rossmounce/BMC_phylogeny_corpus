The evolutionary rate variation among genes of
HOG-signaling pathway in yeast genomes
Xuechang Wu*, Xiaoqin Chi, Pinmei Wang, Daoqiong Zheng, Rui Ding, Yudong Li*

Abstract
Background: Responses to extracellular stress are required for microbes to survive in changing environments.
Although the stress response mechanisms have been characterized extensively, the evolution of stress response
pathway remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the evolution of High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway,
one of the important osmotic stress response pathways, across 10 yeast species and underpinned the evolutionary
forces acting on the pathway evolution.
Results: Although the HOG pathway is well conserved across the surveyed yeast species, the evolutionary rate of
the genes in this pathway varied substantially among or within different lineages. The fast divergence of MSB2
gene indicates that this gene is subjected to positive selection. Moreover, transcription factors in HOG pathway
tend to evolve more rapidly, but the genes in conserved MAPK cascade underwent stronger functional selection.
Remarkably, the dN/dS values are negatively correlated with pathway position along HOG pathway from Sln1 (Sho1)
to Hog1 for transmitting external signal into nuclear. The increased gradient of selective constraints from upstream
to downstream genes suggested that the downstream genes are more pleiotropic, being required for a wider
range of pathways. In addition, protein length, codon usage, gene expression, and protein interaction appear to be
important factors to determine the evolution of genes in HOG pathway.
Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that functional constraints play a large role in the evolutionary
rate variation in HOG pathway, but the genetic variation was influenced by quite complicated factors, such as
pathway position, protein length and so on. These findings provide some insights into how HOG pathway genes
evolved rapidly for responding to environmental osmotic stress changes.

Background
Sensing and responding to their changing environmental
conditions are crucial challenges for microbes to survive
in highly divergent niches they occupy [1,2]. The effective responses to different stresses are mediated by
stress signaling pathways, which are generally composed
of three functional modules: reception module, transduction module and response module [1,3]. The HOG
(High Osmolarity Glycerol)-MARK (Mitogen Activated
Protein Kinase) pathway is required for adapting to
osmotic stress in yeast and other eukaryotes [4,5].
The HOG pathway is greatly characterized in budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [6,7]. The Hog1 (stress

activated MAP kinase) is the central component of the
pathway, and is regulated by Pbs2 (MAPK kinase). In
turn, the Pbs2 activity is controlled by two independent
osmosensing branches involving two transmembrane
proteins Sho1 and Sln1, respectively (Figure 1). The two
upstream branches of the HOG pathway are functionally
redundant in some respects, but they use different components and seem to have slightly different sensitivities
to the concentration of external solutes [8]. In response
to hyperosmotic stress, Pbs2 becomes activated, leading
to the phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of
Hog1, and the subsequent activation of osmo-protective
mechanisms, such as the accumulation of the glycerol
[9].
Fungi, one of the three main eukaryotic kingdoms, are
excellent models to study environmental stress

elements tended to evolve faster than the downstream
elements [14]. In contrast, several studies also showed
that central components of signaling pathways were
generally well conserved, whereas upstream sensors and
downstream transcriptional regulators had diverged to a
greater extent [1,10]. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathway gene evolution remain largely unknown.
Therefore, more pathways with different topologies are
needed to disentangle the underlying evolutionary forces
that affect the molecular evolution pattern of the elements in pathways [15]. The HOG pathway, which has
specific topology with two input branches, provides an
excellent system for exploring the mechanisms of pathway evolution.
In this study, we studied the molecular evolution of
the HOG pathway genes and the relationship between
evolutionary rates with pathway position. Our results
showed that the functional constraints play a large role
in the overall rate variation in HOG pathway, and the
position of gene in pathway was negatively correlated
with evolutionary rate. In addition, the pathway evolution may also be influenced by protein length, codon
usage and gene expression.

responses pathways, because they are simple and evolutionarily conserved [1,10]. Fungi display significant variations in their stress resistance to osmotic stress. For
example, the human pathogen, Candida albicans, tends
to be resistant to osmotic stress, while the plant pathogen, Ashbya gossypii, is relatively sensitive to osmotic
stress [10]. This phenomenon reflects their adaptive evolution in specific niches where they have been threatened by different stresses. Recent researches have
proved that fungi stress signaling pathways have evolved
rapidly in a niche-specific fashion, and the evolution of
signaling pathway is independent of fungi’s phylogenetic
relationship [1,10]. The availability of many genome
sequences from related yeast species allows us to conduct the evolutionary analysis of the entire pathway in
these species.
The evolution of individual genes or gene families has
been studied extensively, and many factors have been
found to determine the evolution of genes, such as protein length, codon usage, gene expression, and protein
interaction [11-13]. Recently, a few researches have
found that the position of the genes in metabolic pathway affected their evolutionary rate, and the upstream

According to the well-characterized HOG-signaling
pathway [1,7], we identified 19 HOG-MAPK pathway
genes from S. cerevisiae to be analyzed in our study
(Figure 1). The initial set of S. cerevisiae HOG-signaling
pathway genes were used to identify candidate orthologs
in the genomes of remaining yeast species, and a total
of 203 putative orthologs in 10 yeast genomes were
identified (Table 1). Generally, the orthologs identified
in this study were consistent with that of Krantz et al.
[7], despite that we used the method based on gene
synteny.
The HOG-MAPK pathway is well conserved across
the available genomes of 10 yeast species. Most genes
have orthologs in all the yeast species studied and were
identified as unique singletons in most cases. Together,
8 HOG pathway genes had a 1:1 orthology relationship,
while the remaining 11 genes underwent a number of
duplication or loss events (15 duplications, 2 loss, and 4
pseudogenization events; Figure 2). The loss or pseudogenization of orthologs may be due to the uncompleted,
low quality genome sequencing of the species, because
partial sequences of the lost orthologs were found in the
species’ contig sequence by BLAST searching. The
genes whose ortholog were lost (SLN1 and STE11) or
included stop codons (SSK2, PBS2 and SKO1) in a given
species were not used in further analysis.
With the 8 conserved 1: 1 orthologs, we build the
phylogenetic tree of yeast species by Bayesian method

(Figure 2), and the topology of the phylogenetic tree is
consistent with previous study [16]. As Saccharomyces
species are derived from an ancestral yeast that underwent a whole genome duplication (WGD) [17], the gene
duplication events we observed in HOG pathway mostly
occurred in post-WGD species (Figure 2).

strong functional constraints acting at most of the HOG
pathway genes. The very high degree of divergence
observed at the MSB2 gene indicates that this gene is
subjected to positive selection. By using the maximum
likelihood method to detect positive selection, we identified gene MSB2 may experience positive selection (LRT
= 35.72, p < 0.001). As this gene is located at the start
point of the HOG pathway and involved in sensing the
environmental changing, it tends to undergo positive
selection [18].

The variation of dN/dS values among genes of the HOG
pathway

The natural selection acting on genes is inferred by the
ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions (d N )/synonymous substitutions (dS). By using M0 model, a single
d N /d S value for all lineages was estimated for each
gene in the HOG pathway. The result show that divergence across species is not uniformly distributed along
the pathway, but varies greatly among genes (Figure 3).
Within sensor module genes, there is a 17-fold difference in the level of divergence between the most conserved (CDC42) and the most divergent (MSB2) gene.
Moreover, the pattern of divergence exhibited by d N
values precisely matches the pattern of d N /d S value
(Figure 3).
The estimates of the dN/dS ratio, using the free-ratio
model, also show that the d N /d S values of the HOG
pathway genes vary substantially in each lineage, ranging
from 0.0001 (CDC42 of Smik) to 1.19 (MSN2 of Calb).
However, the mean dN/dS value equals 0.196, suggesting

Regulatory genes exhibit higher levels of divergence, but
MAPK cascade genes are highly conserved

Recently, transcription factors have been reported to
show evidence of rapid evolution [19,20]. We also
observed that transcription factors Hot1, Msn2 and
Sko1, at the position 7 of the pathway, evolve substantially faster than their surrounding genes in HOG pathway (Figure 3). Only one structural gene MSB2, which
has been identified as positively selected gene, show
comparable levels of amino acid replacement changes.
On average, the transcription factors are more divergent
than the structural genes (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P =
0.014). The higher levels of divergence can be either the
result of relaxed selection and accumulation of neutral
or slightly deleterious substitutions or the result of positive selection leading to the fixation of beneficial mutations [13,19]. However, we do not find any evidence of
positive selection on these transcription factors by using
the maximum likelihood methods (see Methods).
According to an engineering view of dynamical control, gene function in HOG-signaling pathway can be
classified into three functional roles: “sensor”, “regulator”, “actuator” (Figure 1) [3,21]. The dN /dS values of
the MAPK cascade genes (regulator module) was significantly smaller than upstream sensor module (Wilcoxon
rank test, P = 0.00115) and downstream module (Wilcoxon rank test, P = 0.000539) (Figure 4). This is consistent with the view that the MAPK cascade is highly
conserved and under stronger functional constraints,
because it’s involved in many other processes ranging
from mating to invasive growth [22].
The selective constraints was correlated with pathway
position of those genes in signal transduction process

Several earlier studies have shown that the architecture
of pathway, in particular, pathway position, shapes the
evolution of its genes [14,23,24]. However, how the
topology of the pathway affects the pathway evolution

modules in yeast species. The difference between regulator
module (MAPK cascade) and other modules was significantly
different (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.001154 for sensor module,
P = 0.000539 for actuator module). Dots represent the dN/dS values,

remains elusive. During the HOG signal transduction
process, the external osmotic stress was sensed by Sln1
and Sho1, and the signal was propagated via a MAPK
cascade that finally caused nuclear import of Hog1 [22].
As shown in Figure 5, variation of dN/dS was correlated
significantly with pathway position in the HOG-signaling pathway (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient:
r = -0.313, P = 0.0189). However, the relationship does
not hold if including these genes in position 7 and 8 of
HOG pathway. For signal transduction pathway receive
signaling inputs from a number of pathways (i.e., at
least two branches Sln1 and Sho1 of HOG pathway) and
share single response output (MAPK module), the
downstream genes are expected to be more pleiotropic,
and hence be subjected to greater selective constraint
than the upstream genes. Therefore, the pathway position correlated with functional constraint levels can be
explained by the information flux theory that the elements located at branch point of pathway exert a greater
flux control and subjected to stronger selective constraints [14,23].
Even the pooled dN/dS data was separated into each of
the pathway branches Sln1 and Sho1, they also displayed
the same trends (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
for Sln1: r = -0.427, P = 0.0261; for Sho1: r = -0.412,
P = 0.00833). However, the position of genes in Sho1
branch was not clearly determined, especially position 2
(CDC24 and CDC40) and position 3 (STE20 and STE50)
[5,25]. Although we changed the positions of these
genes, the evolutionary pattern was not affected by their
related locations. What’s more, if these data were separated into each lineage of the surveyed yeast taxa, the
pattern of dN/dS variation correlated significantly with
pathway position still holds in S. parodoxus, S. miketae
and A. gossypii. The lack of coordinated evolution in
each lineage had been observed in anthocyanin and

terpenoid biosynthetic pathway genes among plant
lineages [23,24].
The other factors affecting the evolution of HOG pathway
genes

The selective constraints on the pathway genes are also
affected by other evolutionary factors. We studied the
association between molecular evolution of the genes in
HOG-MAPK pathway with codon usage, gene expression,
protein length, and protein interaction in S. cerevisiae
(Table 2). Selective constraint on genes was measured as
ω (dN/dS) and codon bias was measured as the frequency
of optimal codon (Fop). Using simple Spearman rank correlation analyses, the ω (dN/dS) shows significant correlated with codon bias (r = -0.578, P = 0.00959) and
protein length (r = 0.47, P = 0.0426), whereas not significantly associated with other factors. Generally, natural
selection is expected to affect codon usage, and higher
codon bias indicates stronger constraints acting on a gene
[13]. An earlier study have also documented that the protein length play an important role in shaping the evolution
of proteins in P. tremula [12].
However, these factors are inter-correlated, and some
of the observed correlations might actually result from
indirect effects rather than from direct effects. Path analysis was used to better characterize the direct and

indirect effects of these factors. As shown in Figure 6,
d N/d S show a significant correlation with codon bias,
protein length and gene expression. The position do not
correlate with d N /d S directly, thus their relationship
might actually result from indirect effects, connected
by codon usage . Nevertheless, these factors affecting
protein evolution in HOG pathway are complex, with
interplay of a large number of factors.

Conclusions
The availability of complete genome sequences from
many fungal species presents a good opportunity to
examine the evolution of pathway genes. In this study,
we investigated the genetic variation of HOG-signaling
pathway genes across 10 yeast species and underpinned
the evolutionary forces acting on the pathway evolution.
Our results showed that nearly all the pathway genes
existed in the surveyed species and subjected to relatively high selective constraints, suggesting that the
HOG pathway is functional across all these species.
However, the high levels of evolutionary rate variation
of HOG pathway genes among and within different
lineages are consistent with the hypothesis that stress
signaling pathways have evolved rapidly in a niche-specific fashion [1,10].
As the signal pathway could be grouped into three
functional modules (sensor, regulator, actuator) [1,6],
the most dramatic variation in HOG pathway was concentrated to the evolution of sensor genes (Figure 3).
Since these genes are involved in sensing environmental
changing, their high genetic variation was possibly due
to adaptive evolution. For instance, MSB2 was identified
as positively selected genes. In contrast, the MAPK cascade was the least variation module in the HOG pathway, which is consistent with the view that it is well
conserved in eukaryotes, and involves in multiple stress
tolerance processes (salt, H2O2, low and high temperature) [4,22].
Furthermore, the position of the genes in HOG pathway significantly correlated with their dN/dS value variation. Some recent studies also have demonstrated that
selective constraint levels are correlated with the position of the elements in metabolic pathways or signal
pathways [14,24]. Signal transduction pathways receive
signals from many other pathways and transmit them
into single output (i.e., Hog1 in HOG pathway) to activate transcription reprogramming. Therefore, there are
stronger selective constraints acting on the downstream
genes than the upstream ones. The evolution pattern of
HOG pathway supported that natural selection primarily
targets enzymes that have the greatest control on fluxes
[14,24].
Notably, the transcription factors in HOG pathway
tend to evolve faster, which is consistent with a large

number of recent studies [19,20]. To respond sensitively
to the change of environment, stress response pathways
are composed of intricate gene regulation networks [20].
Generally, transcription factors tend to be the hub node
in regulation network and under stronger functional
constraints. However, the fast evolution of transcription
factors in HOG pathway may be the result of their central roles in controlling regulation network to adapt
with the changing of environmental pressures. Moreover, the evolutionary rate variation of the HOG pathway was correlated with codon bias, protein length and
gene expression, suggesting that the genetic variation
may be influenced by quite complicated factors. Nevertheless, further work will be needed to assess the generality of the pathway evolution pattern we observed in
yeast species.

Methods
Identification of HOG pathway genes in yeast genomes

The HOG pathway genes of S. cerevisiae and their interaction (Figure 1) were generated according to Bahn et
al. (2007) and Krantz et al. (2006) [1,7,26]. The full list
of HOG pathway genes included in this study is presented in Table 1. There are 10 yeast species were used
in our study: 6 post-whole genome duplication (WGD)
species (S. cerevisiae [Scer], S. parodoxus [Spar], S. miketae [Smik], S. bayanus [Sbay],S. castelii [Scas], and Candida glabrata [Cgla]), and 4 pre-WGD species
(Kluyveromyces waltii [Kwal], K. lactis [Klac], Ashbya
gossypii [Agos], and C. albicans [Calb]). The protein
coding sequences (CDS) of the HOG pathway genes in

We generated a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of
the protein sequences of each orthologs using the software Clustalw 2.01 [32]. The resulting alignments were
manually improved using the software bioedit 7.0.9 [33].
The aligned amino acid sequences were reversely converted into nucleotide sequences by in-house Perl script
for further analysis. In the cases in which there was
more than one gene copy in a given species, we used
the gene with the same synteny location. The orthologs
with stop codons were not used in further analysis (see
Table 1).
The genes with 1:1 orthologs in all the species were concatenated for building consensus phylogenetic tree [34].
We conducted a bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction

according to the Akaike information criterion. The FindModel program http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/findmodel/findmodel.html was used for model selection, and
the best-fitting model was the GTR+Γ model. All analyses
were conducted allowing for a proportion of sites to be
invariable (I). The phylogenetic tree was used for further
analysis.
Estimation of Evolutionary rate and detection of positive
selection

We evaluated the impact of natural selection by estimating nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous substitution
(d S ), and their ratio (ω = d N /d S ) using the program
codeml of the PAML 4.1b package [36]. The M0 model
(which assumes a single ω value for all lineages) and M1
model (to give separate dN/dS values for each lineage),
were used for evolutionary analyses, with cleandata = 1
(remove sites with ambiguity data) and get SE = 1
(obtain standard errors of ω estimates) [18]. Saturation
effects were avoided by discarding pairwise gene comparisons for which dS > 2 and dS < 0.005 [24]. We also
restricted this analysis to the five Saccharomyces group
species to avoid saturation at synonymous sites, which
could bias the d N /d S estimates because the sequence
alignments of these 5 species were more reliable than
that of all species.
To determine whether there are codons evolving
under positive selection, we compared the M7 and M8
models using the likelihood ratio test, which had been
shown to be more powerful than other branch-site models [18,37]. The Bayes Empirical approach was used to
identify the codons evolving under positive selection
(posterior probability = 95%). We conducted all likelihood estimations using three different ω starting values
(0.01, 0.3 and 3) to overcome the problem of multiple
local optima. All these analyses were conducted using
the F3x4 codon frequency model [38]. We corrected for
multiple testing by using false discovery rate (FDR) of
0.05 for these analyses.
Statistic analysis

All statistical analyses were performed by using statistical package R http://www.r-project.org. The statistical
significance for the difference was determined by Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Spearman rank correlation
was used for correlation analysis. The influence of parameters, such as expression level, codon bias, protein
length, and protein interaction (PPI), on evolutionary
rate was analyzed in this study [39]. Protein length,
expression level and codon usage were obtained from
the Saccharomyces Genome Database and references
[27,39]. The number of PPIs was obtained from GRID

Page 7 of 10

(General Repository for Interaction Datasets). First, we
evaluated whether these parameters are correlated using
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (r). Later, we
analyzed the data using path analysis, an extension of
multiple regression analysis that allows decomposing the
regression coefficients into their direct and indirect
components by considering an underlying user-defined
causal model [14]. Before performing path analysis,
these data were log-transformed to improve normality.
The path analysis was performed using the sem package
in R.

Reviewer’ comments

Understanding the evolutionary patterns in the context
of biological pathways is a topic of great importance.
Wu and colleagues performed a comprehensive analysis
on a well-characterized pathway in yeasts, HOG-signaling pathway. They found that the evolutionary rate of
different components shows great variation, and the variation is influenced by many factors. This is an interesting study, providing useful insights into the evolution of
a key pathway.
My comments are as follows:
1. As for the distribution of HOG pathway genes in
the yeast phylogeny, does the gene duplicability (i.e.,
gene copy gain or loss) correlate with the pathway
position?
Author’s response: There are no correlation was
observed between pathway position and gene duplicability. We observed the gene duplication events in HOG
pathway mostly occurred in post-WGD species.
2. The authors detected positive selection on MSB2
gene. Is it possible to pinpoint the amino acids under
adaptation and infer the functional effect of the amino
acid changes?
Author’s response: Thanks for the valuable suggestion.
Besides the fast evolution of MSB2 gene, we also find
that there is large insert/deletion in some strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will investigate the functional
effect of these sequence changes in future work.
3. The authors reported that the MAPK genes are
under stronger functional constraints and that the evolutionary rate is negatively correlated with the positions
in the pathway (positions 1-6). These two points are
actually redundant because the MAPK (regulator module) is in the downstream of sensor module. So within a
module, does the evolutionary rate depend on the
position?
Author’s response: According to an engineering view of
dynamical control, gene function in a signaling pathway

Wu et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:46
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/46

can be classified into three functional roles: “sensor”,
“regulator”, “actuator”. In each module, the downstream
elements have higher levels of selective constraint than
the upstream elements. For regulator module, r = -0.89,
P = 0.006 (Spearman’s rank correlation). The correlation
of other two modules is more clearly (Figure 3).
4. In the last section, the authors examined the correlations of dN/dS with a series of factors. Since these factors are often interrelated, it would be better to use
principal component analysis or partial correlation analysis to estimate the relative contributions of each
factor?
Author’s response: We agree with the reviewer that the
suggested statistical analysis should be better to estimate
the relative contributions of each factor. In this study, we
used simple Spearman rank correlation analysis to estimate the correlation, and the path analysis to estimate
the indirect effects of these factors. Therefore, we tried to
findout which factors affect the evolution, but not considering which factor play main role in the evolution.
Minor points:
“Most genes have orthologs in all the yeast species
and were identified as unique singletons in most cases.”
How can 8 out of 19 genes become “most”?
Author’s response: There are 10 yeast species surveyed
in this study. The total number of genes is 190. As shown
in Table 1, the singleton gene number is 169 (190 - (15 +
2 + 4)). So we say that most genes were singleton.
I declare that I have no competing interests.
Reviewer’s report 2
Georgy Bazykin, Department of Bioinformatics, Russian
Academy of Science (nominated by Mikhail Gelfand)

The manuscript by Wu et al. is an addition to the existing literature on correlations between the pathway position of the gene and its evolutionary rate. The authors
show that the genes located downstream in HOG pathway are under stronger negative selection.
My main concern is that there seems to be a number
of flaws in the statistical analyses supporting the
authors’ main conclusions.
1. Multiple testing. The authors test all 19 genes of
the HOG pathway with the free-ratio model of codeml
(apparently for a total of ~19*7 comparisons), and identify a single gene at a single branch (MSN2 of Calb)
with dN/dS > 1. They then test MSB2 gene for positive
selection using LRT, and detect positive selection. However, due to the sheer number of multiple tests involved,
detecting a single gene with dN/dS > 1 could occur due
to chance effects. There is no built-in correction for
multiple testing in codeml (Yang 1998 Mol Biol Evol 15
(5):568-573), and the results of multiple comparisons
should be interpreted with more caution. In Methods,
the authors write that they used the FDR rate of 0.05,

Page 8 of 10

but this apparently only applies to comparisons of
codons using M7 and M8 models (which apparently is
never implemented, see below).
Author’s response: We agree with the reviewer, and as
this comment says, we first test all 19 genes of the pathway with the free-ratio model, then identify positive
selection using likelihood ratio test (LRT) test to compare
M7 and M8 model. However, the gene with dN/dS>1 is
not used as evidence to detect positive selection, which is
applied by the comparisons of codons using M7 and M8
models in this study. We have described this analysis in
Methods (Estimation of evolutionary rate and detection
of positive selection). Furthermore, considering 1 out of
19 tests to be positive, and FDR cutoff = 0.05, the P
value should be P < 0.0026 (1 * 0.05/19). As the MSB2
with P < 0.001, so it’s selected as positive selection gene.
2. Arbitrariness in selection of data. In analysis of the
correlation between the pathway position and d N /d S ,
the authors exclude genes in position 7 and 8 of HOG
pathway. Why these genes should be excepted is not
explained, and the authors include them in the rest of
the tests.
Author’s response: The exception of position 7 & 8
could be explained by two reasons: first, it made sense
that the external signal is transmitted into nuclear from
Sln1/Sho1 to Hog1, which changed gene transcription.
The HOG signal transduction process is restricted in
genes from SLN1 to HOG1, but transcription factors are
involved in many other biological processes. Second, the
increased divergence of transcription factors in postion 7
had been observed. If the position 7 and 8 was included,
the correlation didn’t hold again.
I declare that I have no competing interests.
Reviewer’s report 3
Zhenguo Lin, Department of Ecology and Evolution, The
University of Chicago (nominated by John Logsdon)

Different organisms may respond differently to the specific stress. It is of great interest to study how such difference was evolved by examining the evolution of the
related stress response pathways. The yeast S. cerevisiae
cells respond to increased intracellular osmolarity by
activating of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK
pathway. This manuscript indentify the orthologous
genes of HOG pathway from 10 closely related yeast
species, and examined the evolutionary rates of genes at
each step of this pathway. The authors also investigated
the other factors that may affect the evolutionary rates
of these genes. The authors found that the HOG pathway is conserved in hemiascomycete yeasts, but the evolutionary rates vary greatly in different lineages. One
interesting observation is that the evolutionary rates of
genes tend to be negatively correlated with their positions in the pathway, suggesting a stronger selection

Wu et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:46
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/46

constrains at the downstream genes. Overall, this is a
well-executed analysis and well organized manuscript,
although more work need to be done to improve the
quality of writing.
Major comments
1. The authors claimed that the MSB2 genes have
been under positive selection. Although the ω = 0.2496
value is probably the largest among all genes in the
pathway, it is still far below 1. However, if MSB2 was
under positive selection does not affect the conclusion
of this paper.
Author’s response: Although the d N /d S value of the
whole sequence of MSB2 is below 1, but some sites
(codons) of this gene may evolve fast and under positive
selection. We used the site model M7 and M8 comparison to detect positively selected genes, which allow dN/dS
to vary among codons.
2. In the introduction, the authors said C. albicans
and A. gossypii have different sensitivity responding to
environmental osmolarity stress. Are the evolutionary
rates of HOG genes different between the two species?
It would make this study more valuable if the results are
correlated with different osmolarity stress responses
among different species.
Author’s response: Thanks for the reviewer’s useful
comments. We did observe the difference of evolutionary
rates of these two species (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P =
0.00213). However, the omostic stress resistance have
been compared in only a few species, and the resistance
capability cannot be quantified, so we cannot analysis
the correlation relationship between evolutionary rate
and stress resistance quantitatively.
3. The Figure 5 shows a negative correlation between
the dN/dS value and the position during the HOG signal
transduction process. As said by authors, the evolutionary rates are quite different among different lineages. I
am not sure if it is a good idea to mix data from all
lineages to study the correlation. Does the correlation
still exist in each individual species or how many species
have such pattern?
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have considered evolutionary rate of each lineage of
the surveyed yeast taxa, and found the pattern of dN/dS
variation correlated significantly with pathway position
still holds in S. parodoxus, S. miketae and A. gossypii.
Minor comments
“are characterized extensively” ® “have been characterized extensively”
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we haved changed “are characterized extensively” to
“have been characterized extensively”.
“10 yeast genomes” ® “10 yeast species”

Page 9 of 10

Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we haved changed “10 yeast genomes” to “10 yeast
species”.
“Among them” is not clear to the context. “them”
could be misleading as the three functional modules.
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have removed these two words.
fungi is more “evolutionary conserved” is that true?
any reference?
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have added two references. “proofed” proof is not a
verb
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have changed “proofed” to “proved”.
“The aligned amino acid sequences were reversely
translated into nucleotide sequences by in-house Perl
script for further analysis”. Did you mean convert protein alignment into DNA alignment using their original
DNA sequence? It is impossible to “Translate” amino
acid sequences to translated nucleotide.
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have changed “translated” to “converted”.
“we generated 19 HOG-MAPK pathway genes” it is
not appropriate to use “generated” here.
Author’s response: We agree with the reviewer and
have changed “generate” to “identified”.
“their surrounding genes” it is misleading. it could be
neighboring genes on the chromosome.
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have add “in HOG pathway” in this sentence.
“Several earlier studies”, only one reference is listed.
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have added two references.
“fungi” ® fungal
Author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion,
we have changed “fungi” to “fungal”.
I declare that I have no competing interests.
