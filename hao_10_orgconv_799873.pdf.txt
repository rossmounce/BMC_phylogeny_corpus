OrgConv: detection of gene conversion using
consensus sequences and its application in plant
mitochondrial and chloroplast homologs
Weilong Hao

Abstract
Background: The ancestry of mitochondria and chloroplasts traces back to separate endosymbioses of once freeliving bacteria. The highly reduced genomes of these two organelles therefore contain very distant homologs that
only recently have been shown to recombine inside the mitochondrial genome. Detection of gene conversion
between mitochondrial and chloroplast homologs was previously impossible due to the lack of suitable computer
programs. Recently, I developed a novel method and have, for the first time, discovered recurrent gene conversion
between chloroplast mitochondrial genes. The method will further our understanding of plant organellar genome
evolution and help identify and remove gene regions with incongruent phylogenetic signals for several genes
widely used in plant systematics. Here, I implement such a method that is available in a user friendly web interface.
Results: OrgConv (Organellar Conversion) is a computer package developed for detection of gene conversion
between mitochondrial and chloroplast homologous genes. OrgConv is available in two forms; source code can
be installed and run on a Linux platform and a web interface is available on multiple operating systems. The input
files of the feature program are two multiple sequence alignments from different organellar compartments in
FASTA format. The program compares every examined sequence against the consensus sequence of each
sequence alignment rather than exhaustively examining every possible combination. Making use of consensus
sequences significantly reduces the number of comparisons and therefore reduces overall computational time,
which allows for analysis of very large datasets. Most importantly, with the significantly reduced number of
comparisons, the statistical power remains high in the face of correction for multiple tests.
Conclusions: Both the source code and the web interface of OrgConv are available for free from the OrgConv
website http://www.indiana.edu/~orgconv. Although OrgConv has been developed with main focus on detection
of gene conversion between mitochondrial and chloroplast genes, it may also be used for detection of gene
conversion between any two distinct groups of homologous sequences.

Background
Efforts to detect gene conversion and homologous
recombination (HR) have increased in the past two decades [1,2]. This has sparked the development of many
computer programs, such as RDP[3], geneconv[4],
Maxc 2 [5], Homoplasy test [6], Phi[7] and many
others. In general, the vast majority of interspecific HR
events involve closely related species [8-11], and the frequency of HR tends to decrease sharply with the level of
relatedness between donor and recipient [12-14].

Nonetheless, several cases of gene conversion between
distantly related homologous sequences have been
reported in recent years [15-17]. Mitochondria (mt) and
chloroplasts (cp) originated from endosymbiotic bacteria
and last shared common ancestry some 2 billion years
ago. Plant mitochondrial genomes harbor a significant
amount of chloroplast sequences (up to 8.8% of the
complete mitochondrial genomes) due to intracellular
gene transfer from chloroplast to mitochondria [18,19].
The coexistence of homologous genes inside the mitochondrial genome creates the potential for gene conversion between ancient homologs. Plant mitochondrial
and chloroplast genomes share 3 ribosomal RNA genes

and about half of the 40 protein coding genes, which
together serve as the substrate for recombination. The
discovery of several chimeric plant mitochondrial genes,
in this case between native and horizontally transferred
mitochondrial genes [20,21], further suggest that mitochondrial genes are involved in recombination/
conversion during or after DNA exchange events.
Despite this abundance of factors that would seem to
facilitate conversion in mitochondrial genes, evidence of
gene conversion from ancient chloroplast homologs into
mitochondrial genes has, until recently, not been shown.
One possible reason is that the relatively low substitution rate in both plant mitochondrial and chloroplast
genes [22,23] prevents mt-cp conversion from being
detected, since both empirical and simulation studies
have shown that all existing programs are not sensitive
at very low sequence diversity [24-27]. In this article, I
describe a new method [28] that makes use of consensus sequences, which have good computational
efficiency and retain high statistical power. The development of the method led us to a discovery of recurrent
conversion between the mitochondrial and chloroplast
homologs of the alpha subunit of ATP synthase in the
mitochondrial genes [28]. Here, I implement the method
into a computer program, and make it available for the
public in both source code and a user friendly web
interface.

Implementation
The core calculation for conversion identification

The core calculation for detection of conversion in
OrgConv was conducted using a method modified from
the RDP (Recombination Detection Program) method
[3]. The RDP method compares three sequences each
time by only examining informative sites. The probability to observe one recombination follows a binomial distribution:
P

L

N

N





  m !(N m)!  p
N!

m

 (1  p) N m ,

m M

where L is the length of informative sites, N is the
length of the putative recombinant segment, M is the
number of common nucleotides shared between the
putative recombinant sequences, and p is the proportion
of nucleotides common between the same pair of
L
sequences. There are N non-overlapping windows of
L
size N in the sequence (L sites). The term N was used
in the RDP method to correct for multiple windows.
In this study, two improvements were made to the
above calculation. 1), the parameter p (the proportion of
nucleotides common between sequences) was calculated
from the sequence excluding the examined region

Page 2 of 10

instead of from the entire sequence. The calculation
based on the entire sequence in the original RDP
method is under the null hypothesis that there is no
recombination. However, when there is recombination,
the proportion of nucleotides common between the
entire donor and recipient sequences is inflated because
of the recombinant region, and consequently the calculated probability P will be less significant than it should
be. It would therefore be more appropriate to exclude
the examined region from the overall p calculation. 2),
L
in addition to the term N , a second term (L - N) was
introduced to correct for multiple windows. In this
study, calculation was performed in sliding-windows by
incrementing one informative site at a time. For a given
L
window-size N, there are (L - N) instead of N windows, but these (L-N) windows are not independent
from each other. The “effective” number of windows
that need to be corrected for multiple tests should fall
L
between (L - N) and N . The use of (L - N) will present
an upper bound of the probability P. Both P -values
L
based on the term N and L - N are presented in the
output.
Unlike in the RDP program, the size of the sliding
window is not fixed in the OrgConv package. Instead,
from the site where windows begin, the final window
size is from the window that has the smallest P-value.
This is computationally more expensive than the calculation using a fixed window-size in the RDP program.
This computationally expensive calculation is used in
the program because there is no easy way for users to
pre-set any window-size that will be guaranteed to be
optimal for their data. Finally, the performance of the
improved calculations and the original RDP method was
evaluated via simulation.

The OrgConv package

The OrgConv package contains five programs,
mtcpconv, twopop, onepop, seq3comp, and seqconsen (see Additional file 1). The C++ source code is
available at the OrgConv website and can be installed
and run on a Linux platform. Input files for mtcpconv,
twopop are two multiple sequence alignments from
two examined groups in FASTA format, while input
files for the other three programs are single multiple
sequence alignment in FASTA format (see Additional
file 1). The mtcpconv program first constructs a consensus sequence for each sequence alignment (e.g. mt
and cp) and then compares every examined sequence
against the two consensus sequences (illustrated in
Figure 1). Comparing examined sequences against the

mitochondrial and chloroplast homologous genes. In a more
general context, gene conversion may also be detected using
consensus sequences when the within-clade divergence is low and
between-clade divergence is high.

consensus sequences rather than examining every possible combination of three sequences greatly reduces
computational burden and it gives mtcpconv a great
advantage over other programs of analyzing large data
sets because of computational time savings. The rationale of using consensus sequences is that plant mitochondrial genes have extremely low nucleotide
substitution rates [22,23], so regions transferred from
chloroplast into mitochondria should be notably different from other mitochondrial genes but highly similar
with chloroplast genes. Nonetheless, the use of consensus sequences, while computationally advantageous,
increases the chance that recombination events involving chloroplast regions that differ significantly from the
chloroplast consensus sequence will be missed (as
opposed to comparisons with the actual donor sequence
or sequences closely related to it). To account for this
possibility, users have the option to examine every possible sequence combination using the twopop or onepop program. The twopop program was developed to
search for gene conversion between two distinct groups,
while onepop was developed to detect gene conversion
within a single group. The latter works in a way similar
to the RDP program [3] (see Additional file 1 for more
details). Two additional programs, seq3comp and
seqconsen, are also included in the OrgConv package: These allow detection of gene conversion from
sequence triplets and construction of consensus
sequences from alignments.
The OrgConv web interface

A user-friendly web interface that uses Perl CGI scripts is
accessible via a variety of web browsers (e.g. Firefox, IE,
Safari, and Konqueror) and on multiple operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux). The web interface currently runs mtcpconv, seq3comp, and seqconsen.

Figure 2 Web interface where mt and cp alignments could be
uploaded.

To run programs on the web interface, users just need to
upload sequence alignments, and results are displayed in
HTML format when the analysis is finished. A snapshot
of the mtcpconv interface is shown in Figure 2. Analysis
was conducted using the mitochondrial atp1 and chloroplast atpA data from ref. [28]. The output for the Rosids
group (a group of flowering plants, Figure 3) is shown as
an example in Figure 4. Although written in Perl CGI
scripts, the web-interface calls executables compiled
from C++ source codes for the main computations.
Thus, the computational performance on the web-server
should be comparable to installing and running the distributed source code on a local computer.

Results and Discussion
Unlike RDP that can only be run on a Windows operating system, OrgConv has the advantage that it can be
installed and run on a Linux platform (including the
Linux environment on Mac) and the web interface is
accessible on multiple operating systems (Windows,

Mac, and Linux). Besides the different operating systems
the programs run on, a main difference between
mtcpconv and RDP is that mtcpconv makes use of
consensus sequences. In principle, the same goal can be
achieved using RDP. First, consensus sequences need to
be generated from the two alignments, then the calculation for the P-value can be conducted on the two consensus sequences and one examined sequence each time
using RDP. Since mtcpconv and RDP use the same
method to calculate the probability, the results using the
two programs should be very similar if not identical.

However, the current version of RDP does not have the
option to compare consensus sequences automatically.
In practice, it would be difficult for users to conduct
such analyses on a large number of sequences only
using RDP. As the number of sequences in a given analysis increases, the total number of possible sequence
combinations increases exponentially (Table 1). Comparing every examined sequence against the consensus
sequences as done in mtcpconv instead of examining
every possible sequence combinations greatly reduces
the number of comparisons. The computational performance of mtcpconv was evaluated and compared with
other programs geneconv and RDP using atp1 - atpA
homologs in different groups of flowering plants [28].
As the number of sequences increases, the computational time increases linearly with mtcpconv instead of
quadratically using geneconv and cubically using RDP
(Table 2 and Figure 5). For example, on a 3 GHz Intel
vPro, 3 GB RAM, Linux Fedora 10 machine, mtcpconv
requires about 1 min to analyze a 529 mitochondrial
atp1 alignment and an 87 chloroplast atpA alignment
(1,629 characters in length). On the same data, the computational time is 102 minutes 21 seconds using geneconv and 16 minutes 33 seconds using RDP. RDP is a
Windows program and it was run on a 2.2 GHz AMD
Athlon, 2 GB RAM, Windows XP machine. Even though
RDP was run on a different machine and on a different
operating system, the substantial difference in computational time (Figure 5) is sufficient to suggest that
mtcpconv outperforms both geneconv and RDP

when the number of sequences is large. More importantly, the reduction of comparisons using consensus
sequences provides the added benefit of greatly increasing statistical power. Generally, when the number of calculations is large, there is a multiple testing problem
because of the increased risk of getting false positives by
chance. The multiple testing problem is usually treated
by some correction method, such as the widely used
Bonferroni correction. For instance, when there are k
comparisons, the observed P-value considered to be sig05
nificant at the 0.05 level is 0.k after Bonferroni correction. When the number of calculations is large, the
initial P-value needs to be extremely small to be considered significant (Table 1). On the atp1 - atpA data, after
Bonferroni correction, most of the mt-cp conversion
segments detected by mtcpconv are not significant
using geneconv and RDP (Table 2). To obtain a

conservative view of the performance of mtcpconv,
both P-values are required to be significant. To illustrate
the statistical power of mtcpconv on large datasets, I
compared its performance to RDP and geneconv with
the entire angiosperms (flowering plant) atp1 - atpA
data and a smaller subset of the data using just the
asterids group (Figure 3). The phylogenetic relationship
of asterids and other four groups of angiosperms was
derived from [29,30] (Figure 3). When applied to the
same data in the Asterids group, mtcpconv detected
28 recombinant segments, geneconv detected 17
recombinant segments, and RDP did not detect any segments (Table 2). When applied to a larger dataset (all
flowering plants), geneconv did not detect any segments, and even the ones previously detected in the
Asterids group became non-significant. In contrast,
mtcpconv detected 34 segments in all angiosperms
and 27 out of the 28 previously detected segments in
the Asterids group remain significant. RDP only detected
one segment, which is in the flowering plant Apodanthes
casearia (shown as the most significant one in Figure 4).
It was significant in both the Rosids group and all
angiosperms. These results suggest that mtcpconv is
powerful on large datasets in the face of Bonferroni correction. Given the lack of sensitivity of existing programs, it is not surprising that mt-cp conversion events
were previously overlooked. The performance of the
core calculation used in the RDP program and the
improved ones used in this study was evaluated via
simulations. In brief, simulation was conducted on a series of three-taxon phylogenies with four different branch
length ratios and three different levels of divergence for
each branch length ratio. Sequences were simulated to
have 1500 nt in length on the basis of each phylogeny
using the Seq-Gen program [31] with equal base composition and the transition/transversion ratio equal to 2.
First, I evaluated the false positive rates of different calculations (Figure 6). Sequences were generated with no

Page 6 of 10

recombination introduced and then scanned for recombination. Any detected recombinant region would be
deemed as a false positive. It is clear that the false positive rate is the highest when using the improved p and
L
the term N to correct for multiple windows. Furthermore, the false positive rate is negatively associated with
the degree of divergence between the two closely related
taxa. When their branch length is 0.01 (pairwise distance equal to 0.02), the false positive rate could be up
L
to 22% when the term N was used to correct for multiple windows, and close to 7% when the term L - N was
used to correct for multiple windows. The high rate of
false positives in low diverse sequences could be
explained by the high stochastic error in the p calculation. For instance, when the degree of divergence is low,
the p excluding the examined region could be stochastically much smaller than the p from the entire sequence.
It is important to mention that the detected recombinant regions listed in Table 2 are not likely false positives. 1), calculations using L - N to correct for multiple
windows have lower false positive rates than those using
L to correct for multiple windows. 2), there is a reaN
sonable degree of divergence within each group. For the
groups that have recombinant segments, the average
DNA distance between the consensus and each
sequence is 0.023 in Rosids, 0.031 in Asterids, and 0.047
in all angiosperms. 3), the P-values are remarkably significant for most segments. For instance, in all angiosperms, 34 segments are significant at the 0.05 level after
Bonferroni correction. 33 of them are significant at the
0.01 level, and 30 of them are significant at the 0.001
level. Second, I evaluated the power of different calculations (Figures 7 and 8). Sequences were simulated with
one recombination introduced at the beginning of the
sequence. If a putative recombinant region inferred
from the calculation that is within the simulated recombinant region was deemed as a correct detection, otherwise it was deemed as a false positive. It is clear that the

power of recombination detection increases as the
degree of divergence increases and the power increases
as the distant sequence is more diverse from the other
two sequences. Furthermore, the power is higher when
the recombination is recent compared with when the
recombination is ancient.
The use of consensus sequences carries a risk that
recombination events involving chloroplast regions that
differ significantly from the chloroplast consensus
sequence will be missed. A possible approach to overcoming this is to compare mitochondrial sequences
against chloroplast sequences from closely related species. Indeed, 23 segments in the Asterids group did
show slightly smaller initial (before Bonferroni correction) P-values when comparing Asterids mitochondrial
and chloroplast sequences than comparing all angiosperm mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences (data not
shown). However, comparison of sequences from the
same taxonomic group might not always outperform
comparison of larger groups. For example, Myrtus communis has been detected to have a mtcp-conversion by
analyzing the entire angiosperms dataset with two

Page 8 of 10

P-values of 6.19 × 10-08 and 4.70 × 10-06, whereas the Pvalues when comparing Rosids mitochondrial and chloroplast genes are only 2.74 × 10-03 and 2.50 × 10-01, and
not considered to be significant in Figure 4.
Even though the mtcpconv program was developed
with main focus on detection of mt-cp conversion, its
application can extend beyond mitochondrial and chloroplast genes. The prerequisite of the program is the use
of consensus sequences and it relies on the fact of low
diversity within both mitochondrial genes and chloroplast genes but much diversity between them. Ideally, if
two groups of sequences have very little diversity within
each group and much diversity between groups,
mtcpconv would be suitable to use for detection of
conversion between the two groups. Knowing the existence of recombination in Streptococcus strains [32-34],
I applied mtcpconv to 232 commonly present genes
(my unpublished data) to detect gene conversion
between two Streptococcus species pyogenes and equi
(Figure 9). Two genes with the smallest P-values from
the mtcpconv program are shown in Figure 9B, and
further phylogenetic analysis supports the chimeric

nature of these genes. In conclusion, mtcpconv seems
to work well when two groups of sequences have little
diversity within each group and much diversity between
groups. However, when there is little diversity between
groups or very much diversity within each group,
mtcpconv is not expected to work well. In such a case,
programs for more general recombination/conversion
detection, such as RDP, geneconv, and Maxc2, should
be considered. Furthermore, mtcpconv along with
other programs in the OrgConv package assumes that
the substitution rate of a nucleotide position is constant
throughout time (i.e., in all lineages), although the rate
can vary between positions. In deed, however, the substitution rate of sites in a gene can change over time,
this is also known as heterotachy [35]. Heterotachy
could potentially lead to false positives when using programs in the OrgConv package. Under such circumstances, more explicitly phylogenetic methods such as
LIKEWIND[15], TOPAL[36], and bootscanning [37] are
likely to work better.

Conclusions
The OrgConv package was developed for detection of mtcp conversion. It makes use of the consensus sequence
from each group of sequences and compare each examined sequence against consensus sequences rather than
examining every possible sequence combination. By doing
so, computational burden has been significantly reduced
and it becomes feasible to analyze very large data sets.
More importantly, the statistical power of the program is
retained in the face of Bonferroni correction because of
the reduced number of comparisons. Furthermore,
although developed for detection of mt-cp converson, the
program may be applied on other sequences than mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences, e.g., when two large
groups of sequences have very low diversity within each
group and high diversity between groups.
