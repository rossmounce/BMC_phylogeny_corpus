Abstract
Rho GTPases are a distinct subfamily of the superfamily of Ras GTPases. The best-characterised
members are RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 that regulate many diverse actions such as actin cytoskeleton
reorganisation, adhesion, motility as well as cell proliferation, differentiation and gene transcription.
Among the 20 members of that family, only Rac2 and RhoH show an expression restricted to the
haematopoietic lineage.
RhoH was first discovered in 1995 as a fusion transcript with the transcriptional repressor LAZ3/
BCL6. It was therefore initially named translation three four (TTF) but later on renamed RhoH due
to its close relationship to the Ras/Rho family of GTPases. Since then, RhoH has been implicated
in human cancer as the gene is subject to somatic hypermutation and by the detection of RHOH
as a translocation partner for LAZ3/BCL6 or other genes in human lymphomas. Underexpression
of RhoH is found in hairy cell leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia.
Some of the amino acids that are crucial for GTPase activity are mutated in RhoH so that the
protein is a GTPase-deficient, so-called atypical Rho GTPase. Therefore other mechanisms of
regulating RhoH activity have been described. These include regulation at the mRNA level and
tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein's unique ITAM-like motif. The C-terminal CaaX box of
RhoH is mainly a target for farnesyl-transferase but can also be modified by geranylgeranyltransferase. Isoprenylation of RhoH and changes in subcellular localisation may be an additional
factor to fine-tune signalling.
Little is currently known about its signalling, regulation or interaction partners. Recent studies have
shown that RhoH negatively influences the proliferation and homing of murine haematopoietic
progenitor cells, presumably by acting as an antagonist for Rac1. In leukocytes, RhoH is needed to
keep the cells in a resting, non-adhesive state, but the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated.
RhoH has also been implicated as a regulatory molecule in the NFκB, PI3 kinase and Map kinase
pathways. The recent generation of RhoH knockout mice showed a defect in thymocyte selection
and TCR signalling of thymic and peripheral T-cells. However, RhoH-deficient mice did not develop
lymphomas or showed obvious defects in haematopoiesis.

Review
RhoH is an atypical Rho GTPase
Small GTPases of the Rho family
The superfamily of mammalian Ras like proteins comprises over 150 members that can be subdivided into five
main families, namely Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf and Ran and all
control rather specifically one particular facet of cell
metabolism. While Ras is an important regulator of proliferation [1], the main function of Rho proteins is the control of cell morphology [2,3]. Rho GTPases were first
described in 1985 [4] and function as molecular switches
that control and integrate a variety of signal transduction
pathways by linking receptor-derived signals to downstream signalling proteins [2,5,6]. Rho proteins are
present in lower eukaryotes such as slime mould [7] and
yeast [8] and in mammals [9]. Twenty mammalian members of the Rho GTPases have been identified so far [10],
which can be subdivided into 8 distinct subgroups [11].
They share a high degree of sequence similarity and the
individual members are around 50% homologous to each
other [12]. Only two members of the Rho family, Rac2
and RhoH, are specifically expressed in haematopoietic
cells [13,14].

As is the case for most of the other Ras-like GTPases, Rho
proteins are monomeric 20–30 kDa GTP binding proteins
that act as molecular switches. They are turned on when
bound to GTP and switched off when bound to GDP [12].
Three main classes of interacting proteins actively control
this cycling. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)
or Dbl homology proteins catalyse the exchange of GDP
by GTP and therefore act as positive regulators [15].
GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) on the other hand
enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity leading to the
hydrolysis of GTP to GDP [16]. Only three proteins are
known of the third class of regulators. These are the GDP
dissociation inhibitors (GDI) that keep the GTPase in an
inactive state in the cytosol [2,3]. In the GTP-bound state,
the GTPase is in its active conformation and interacts with
a variety of downstream effectors, such as protein kinases,
lipid kinases, phospholipases C and D as well as several
adaptor proteins [17,18]. However, like Rnd1, RhoE/
Rnd3 and probably RhoBTB proteins, RhoH is GTPasedeficient [13] and therefore belongs to the subset of atypical GTPases. Its activity is modulated by interaction with
other Rho GTPases [19,20], transcriptional regulation
[19] or phosphorylation [21] rather than through the classical cycling process and modulation by effector proteins.
Structurally, all Rho GTPases contain a Rho family specific, exposed insert of 13 amino acids that has a function
in binding to effectors and regulators [22] (see Figure 1).
In RhoH however, the insert consists of only 7 amino
acids, which is another atypical feature of that protein.
The highest sequence similarity within Rho GTPases is

http://www.biosignaling.com/content/6/1/6

found for the central GTP binding motifs while the C-terminal sequences are more divergent [12]. Figure 1 gives an
overview of the structural elements important for signalling for RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42 as well as RhoH. While the
switch I and switch II regions constitute the conformational difference between the active, GTP-bound and the
inactive, GDP-bound state (grey shaded boxes), the phosphate binding loop is essential for the GTPase activity of
the protein. Like in Ras, replacement of the conserved glycine G12 in the phosphate-binding loop (marked in red
within the grey shaded box) renders Rho GTPases enzymatically inactive. In RhoH and RhoE, another constitutively active Rho family member, this glycine is replaced
by a serine. Another key residue for intrinsic and GAP
mediated GTPase activity is glutamine Q61 (in Ras and
Cdc42 or Q63 in RhoA) located within the switch II
region that is replaced by an asparagine in RhoH (shown
in red).
The C-terminus of Rho GTPases has a function in mediating interactions with the membrane through its polybasic
motif and more importantly, by the CaaX motif. Figure 1
shows the basic residues in bold printing and the conserved cysteine in red. This cysteine can be modified posttranslationally by prenylation through transfer of a geranylgeranyl or farnesyl lipid moiety to interact with the
plasma membrane. After the prenylation reaction, the aaX
tripeptide is clipped off and the cysteine's free carboxylate
anion gets methylated [23]. RhoH contains a CKIF motif
and here we present biochemical data showing that RhoH
is modified in vitro by farnesyl-transferase and to a small
extent by geranylgeranyl-transferase (Figures 2A and 2B,
respectively). During the preparation of this manuscript,
the Der group showed that dual treatment of RhoH
expressing cells with farnesyl-transferase and geranylgeranyl-transferase inhibitors caused relocalisation of RhoH
to the cytoplasm [24]. However, they did not include biochemical data in their study as we present them here.
Phylogenetically, most Rho clusters seem to have already
emerged in chordates, however, RhoH is only found in
vertebrates [25]. Boureux et al., who investigated the evolution of Rho proteins, speculate that the RHOH gene
might have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer, for
example through retroviral integration. This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that in contrast to other Rho family
members, the coding region of RHOH is not split by
introns. In addition, RhoH is found in all species as a single member whereas other Rho subgroups comprise at
least two members in vertebrate genomes.
In addition to their well-described role as regulators of cell
morphology, a number of Rho proteins also have important functions in the process of haematopoiesis (reviewed

in [26]), although only Rac2 and RhoH are specifically
expressed in haematopoietic tissue.
RhoH is thought to mainly act as a negative regulator for
such diverse processes as proliferation, survival, migration
and engraftment of haematopoietic progenitor cells [27]
and was proposed to be a negative regulator for growth
and actin based functions through suppression of Rac signalling. Very recently, the generation of RhoH-deficient
mice allowed to study the function of RhoH in more
detail. RhoH null mice are viable with no obvious defects
in haematopoiesis and RhoH seems to be dispensable for
the development of myeloid, erythroid and B-cells [28].
On the other hand, animals showed impaired T-cell differentiation due to defective T-cell receptor signalling
[21,28], as RhoH is necessary for the production and survival or migration of T-cells.

RhoH is a Rho protein with atypical properties
Thirteen years ago, Dallery and co-workers set out to identify new potential oncogenes by cloning chromosomal
translocation breakpoints that were found in human lymphomas [13]. They had previously shown that the zinc
finger protein and translational repressor LAZ3/BCL6 is
disrupted in non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Although these
3q27 chromosomal abnormalities mainly lead to rearrangements with immunoglobulin genes, other LAZ3/
BCL6 rearrangements were also found to occur [29]. One
recurrent translocation in the non-Hodgkin lymphoma
cell line VAL was a t(3;4)(q27;p11) rearrangement that
disrupted LAZ3/BCL6 in the first intron (see next paragraph). Subsequent sequencing of the LAZ3/BCL6 containing mRNA allowed them to discover a chimeric
transcript that contained a previously unknown small G
like protein, which they termed "translation three four"
(TTF) [13]. Later on, more accurate FISH analysis corroborated RHOH as a LAZ3/BCL6 translocation partner and

placed RHOH on the short arm of chromosome 4, band
p13 [30].
The initial characterisation showed that RhoH was a 191
amino acid containing protein and a novel homologue of
the Ras family. While it had 27% identity to H-RAS it
showed up to 45% identity with members of the Rho family. It also contained the Rho typical insert motif,
although shortened to 7 amino acids, which confirmed
that classification. However, the absence of residues crucial for the catalytic activity of the proteins (see Figure 1)
indicated that RhoH might have unusual properties. In
addition, it was found that the 2.2 kb RhoH transcript is
expressed only in haematopoietic cells while no expression in other organ tissues was detectable [13].
Investigation of the structural characteristics of the 35 kb
spanning RHOH revealed an unusual organisation of its
exons [31]. First of all, RHOH contains one intronless
coding region, two major (1a and 1b) and three minor
(X1, X2, X3) non-coding exons. The open reading frame
comprises the complete coding sequence. This is uncommon as the coding region of most other Rho GTPases is
interrupted by introns [10]. Interestingly, all currently
described translocations or mutations of RHOH affect its
5' regulatory region but not the coding exon. Second, the
authors discovered a great heterogeneity in the 5'-untranslated regions of mRNAs from different haematopoietic
lineages, especially between B and T-cells. Alternative

splicing of some 5' exons caused different transcription
initiation sites [31]. This complex organisation of the
RHOH 5' region is unusual for a Ras related gene and is
reminiscent of cytokine or cytokine receptor genes. It is
perceivable that this atypical feature plays a role in regulation of RhoH signalling through differential expression.
RHOH is a target for genetic alterations
Introduction
Since the original description of RhoH in a
t(3;4)(q27;p13) translocation with LAZ3/BCL6 in a nonHodgkin lymphoma cell line [13], alterations to the
RHOH gene have been found in a number of different
human cancers. The current literature recognises two
main mechanisms that describe the cause for these alterations. Although there are reports where structural changes
in the 4p13 region could be linked to translocation of the
RHOH gene [32-34], most of the cases described so far
show that RHOH is a hypermutable gene locus and targeted by aberrant somatic hypermutation [35]. Figure 3
categorises the described events according to the WHO
classification of lymphoid tumours [36]. The four types of
haematopoietic tumours involved are immunodeficiency
associated lymphoproliferative disorders, Hodgkin lymphomas, mature B-cell neoplasms and acute myeloid leukaemia. Diseases involving RHOH translocations are
shown in blue, while the green colour indicates aberrant
somatic hypermutation of the RHOH gene. Leukaemia
associated with an underexpression of RHOH mRNA are

RhoH in Cancer. The two major mechanisms that link RhoH to cancer are aberrant somatic hypermutation and the formation of fusion transcripts with genes such as the transcriptional repressor LAZ3/BCL6. Both mechanisms have been found in a
variety of human cancers and the figure summarises the current knowledge by sorting the described cancers corresponding to
their WHO classification [36]. Cancers involving somatic mutation of the RHOH gene are highlighted in blue, while cancers,
where a fusion of RhoH was detected, are presented in green. Cases of leukaemia characterised by underexpression of RhoH

depicted without colour, as the mechanism of deregulation has not yet been established.
Lymphomas involving RHOH gene rearrangements
Reciprocal chromosomal translocations with oncogenes
are found in a number of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The
occurring translocations are rather specific for the type of
lymphoma and they are often the primary event causing
the disease. Follicular lymphoma (FL) for example, is
associated with a translocation involving the BCL2 gene.
However, rearrangements involving LAZ3/BCL6, eventually interfering with LAZ3/BCL6 protein expression, are
also found [37]. Bcl6 is a zinc finger protein known to act
as a sequence specific transcriptional repressor; it plays an
important role in the maturation of B-cells and high Bcl6
expression is considered to be of favourable prognostic
value [38,39]. While a BCL2 translocation is found in

85% of FL cases and can be considered the primary cause
of the disease, the t(3;4)(q27;p13) translocation between
LAZ3/BCL6 and RHOH is often a secondary event [40].
The breakpoint and gene orientation indicates that the
gene fusion places LAZ3/BCL6 under the control of the
RHOH promoter sequence instead of the expression of a
fusion protein. Reciprocally, RHOH is placed under control of the LAZ3/BCL6 promoter. This results in the transcriptional deregulation of both genes [32].
The importance of LAZ3/BCL6 translocations was investigated by Akasaka et al. [41]. The authors found that in the
course of transformation from the rather indolent follicular lymphoma into the more aggressive diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, LAZ3/BCL6 translocations with RHOH were
widespread. It is therefore possible that RHOH plays a
role in the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma and it

may serve as a possible marker for those lymphomas that
have a high potential to transform.
A different RHOH translocation was found in a case of
multiple myeloma (or plasma cell myeloma). Chromosomal abnormalities and translocations seem to increase
in pathogenesis in this bone marrow based plasma cell
neoplasm [32]. In this patient only one abnormality was
found involving a t(4;14)(p13;q32) translocation, resulting in a rearrangement of the RHOH gene with the IGH
gene, although the corresponding fusion transcript could
not be detected. Two other cases of a t(4;14)(p13;q32)
translocation have been reported to date; one in a case of
nodal marginal lymphoma [33] while the other involves
a case of splenic lymphoma [34]. These data suggest that
rearrangements involving RHOH are a recurrent abnormality in B-cell malignancies. However, it has not been
investigated whether RHOH rearrangements have prognostic implications.
RHOH is a target for aberrant somatic hypermutation
Recently, a novel class of genetic aberration called aberrant somatic hypermutation (ASHM) has been described
[35]. Somatic mutation is a physiologic process that enables B-cells to enhance antibody affinity for a specific antigen through nucleotide substitutions within the
immunoglobulin variable genes of germinal centre B-cells
[42]. However, this hypermutation activity may also aberrantly target other genes, among them a number of wellknown proto-oncogenes such as PIM1, MYC, PAX5 and
also RHOH. Interestingly, these genes are also susceptible
to the formation of translocations which suggests that the
process of hypermutation could also facilitate the formation of double-strand breaks [43]. Aberrant somatic mutation of RHOH has originally been described for diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a group of aggressive
lymphomas with heterogeneous clinical outcome [36]. In
DLBCL, around 50% of the cases were found to harbour
aberrant mutations for PIM1, PAX5, MYC and RHOH,
respectively [35]. Since this initial observation, several
similar studies on various lymphoid tumours were performed. Table 1 summarises the current knowledge.

In mature B-cell neoplasms, the occurrence of ASHM and
the mutation frequency of RHOH vary. While some cancers have low rates of ASHM in general [44], others with
frequent ASHM do not include RHOH as a target [45].
However, indolent forms of a certain cancer often have
lower mutation frequencies for RHOH than more aggressive forms. One example is primary CNS lymphoma, a
subtype of DLBCL that has much poorer prognosis compared to DLBCL (70% mutation frequency in RHOH vs.
46%) [46]. Similar results were obtained for patients with
two subtypes of primary cutaneous lymphoma, the indolent primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma

http://www.biosignaling.com/content/6/1/6

(PCFCL) and the more aggressive primary cutaneous large
B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCLBCL) [47]. ASHM can also
occur during progression of the disease as described by
Rossi and Reiniger and their co-workers [48,49]. Here, the
accumulation of novel mutations in RHOH and other
gene loci (PIM1, PAX5, MYC) was found to be associated
with transformation of follicular lymphoma and chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia to DLBCL. To evaluate the potential role of RhoH as a prognostic marker, samples from
100 patients with previously untreated DLBCL were examined [50]. However, neither the overall survival nor the
disease-free survival rate could be linked to hypermutation of the RHOH gene.
Although Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) are targeted frequently by ASHM (55–80%), the RHOH gene is not
mutated at high frequency [51]. Both subtypes of Hodgkin lymphomas are rarely fatal due to effective treatment,
supporting again the notion that ASHM of RHOH mainly
occurs in aggressive types of lymphomas.
The third group of lymphoid tumours, where abnormalities of RHOH are reported, are immunodeficiency-associated disorders such as the B-cell post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). PTLD is a lymphoid
proliferation or lymphoma that may result from immunosuppression after receiving solid organ or bone marrow
allografts. While the polymorphic form of the disorder
rarely undergoes ASHM (12.5%), the monomorphic
form, representing a progression of the disease, had
ASHM in the majority of cases investigated (66.7%) [52].
This is similar to the aforementioned results obtained for
the progression from the more indolent follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma [48,49]. The mutation frequency
for RHOH in monomorphic PTLD was found to be 40%
and therefore nearly as high as in DLBCL. In AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma, another immunodeficiency-associated lymphoma type, aberrant SHM may
contribute to the pathogenesis of that disease [53]. In
HCV-positive and HIV-positive patients alterations of
RHOH, however, were lower than in patients negative for
HCV or HIV [53,54].
Reduced expression of RHOH in cancer
Two recent publications highlight the fact that RhoH is
underexpressed in hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML), respectively [55,56].

HCL is a rare disease, comprising only 2% of lymphoid
leukaemia cases. The origin of the disease is not known
and effective treatment is not available [57]. The disease is
diagnosed by the overexpression of the myeloid specific
marker CD11c. Lymphocytes isolated from HCL patients
demonstrate app. 3–4 fold lower RHOH mRNA expres-

Summary of currently available data on RHOH as a target for ASHM. The general ASHM frequency is defined by the frequency for mutations in at
least one of the following genes: PIM1, PAX5, MYC and RHOH, except where otherwise indicated.

sion compared to a variety of other diseases of the lymphoid system, such as Burkitt lymphoma, plasmocytoma
or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The lower mRNA
expression was found to be caused by transcriptional
repression of the RHOH promoter [55]. HCL cells show a
Ras-induced, increased activity of the transcription factor
AP-1 that results in the upregulation of the AP-1 dependent gene CD11c [58]. In vitro reconstitution of RhoH
expression was sufficient to repress CD11c surface expression.

CD11c is the integrin alpha X subunit that together with
the beta2 chain acts as a leukocyte specific integrin. So the
authors asked whether RhoH plays a role in intercellular
adhesion. Indeed, cells reconstituted with RhoH showed
decreased cell proliferation and homotypic and heterotypic adhesion, respectively. In a transwell assay, the
authors could demonstrate that RhoH reconstitution
reduced transendothelial migration, a central process in
the pathogenesis of the disease. In an in vivo xenograft
model, RhoH reconstitution leads to the inhibition of

malignant progression. The tumour burden of the mice
was reduced by 70% suggesting that elevated levels of
RhoH protected the animals against mortality [55].
The expression level of RhoH was also investigated in
bone marrow samples from AML patients and underexpression of RHOH on the mRNA level was found to be a
prognostic marker for bad prognosis, overall survival as
well as disease-free survival [56]. This is in contrast to
results published by the same group on the impact of
aberrant SHM of RHOH in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,
where such a link was not detectable [50]. The authors
also provide a first insight into the molecular mechanism
that might play a role in resistance to chemotherapy in
AML patients. Rac1-induced activation of its downstream
effector p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) leads to phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bad on serine S75.
This protects human lymphoma cells from drug-induced
caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis [59]. While
overexpression of RhoH suppresses Rac1 activity thus
leading to increased apoptosis (see following paragraph)
[27], low expression levels of RhoH might increase Rac1induced protection from apoptosis, drug resistance and
cause bad prognosis.
It is to be expected that RhoH expression levels can modulate the activity of other proteins involved in cell survival
and proliferation as well. It will therefore be of crucial
importance to gain a better understanding of RhoH as a
modulator of signalling cascades in order to better understand its biological implications in cancer patients.
RhoH in signal transduction
Aspects of RhoH signalling
In comparison to the number of studies on the putative
role of RhoH in cancer, only a very limited number of
publications deal with the function of RhoH as a signalling molecule. This can be attributed in part to the fact
that all mutations of the RHOH gene were found to occur
in the non-coding part of the gene. This suggests that in
human haematological malignancies the absence of
RhoH is problematic rather than activating mutations or
overexpression of the protein. The recent finding that
overexpression of RhoH in hairy cell leukaemia reduces
the transformation potential [55] might stimulate a new
interest in the functioning of RhoH on a molecular level.

Seven years after the initial discovery of RhoH, the first
study that described several aspects of the signalling of
RhoH in various haematopoietic cell types was published
[19]. Due to the mutation of the conserved residues G13
and Q61 which are essential for hydrolysis of GTP, it was
proposed that RhoH has no intrinsic GTPase activity
[12,13]. In a nucleotide dissociation assay it was shown
that although RhoH is able to bind GTP rapidly, it does

http://www.biosignaling.com/content/6/1/6

not hydrolyse the bound GTP to GDP [19]. It is possible
that RhoH might not have intrinsic GTPase activity but
can substitute for that defect by binding to a GAP that provides the critical residues necessary for catalytic activity.
This was described for Rap that hydrolyses GTP when
RapGAP1 provides the catalytic arginine [60]. The authors
investigated whether the RhoGAP p50 which acts as a
GAP for RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 might enable RhoH to
hydrolyse GTP, but found it not the case. Nevertheless, it
is still possible that a RhoH specific GAP exists and hasn't
been identified yet. The authors also tested another class
of Rho regulatory molecules, the GDIs. These molecules
inhibit dissociation of GDP and keep Rho GTPases in
their inactive form in the cytoplasm. Their finding that the
three Rho GDIs 1, 2 and 3 can all interact with RhoH is a
matter of controversy, as others report that this interaction
was only marginally detectable [61].
As Rho GTPases characteristically play a function in cell
morphology and the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton, the effects of RhoH expression on actin polymerisation were studied in non-haematopoietic NIH 3T3 and
MDCK cells. The authors describe RhoH to be diffusely
distributed in the cytoplasm and they saw no difference in
the morphology of PDGF stimulated cells in the presence
or absence of RhoH overexpression [19]. However, more
recent studies using bone marrow from RhoH-deficient
mice or haematopoietic cells transduced with RhoH
showed that RhoH does have an effect in regulation of the
cytoskeleton in haematopoietic cells, if only as an antagonist of another Rho GTPase, Rac1 [20,27]. SDF-1α is an
important chemoattractant that induces migration of haematopoietic progenitor cells [62]. It induces a polarised
rim in haematopoietic cells through activation of Rac1.
This enables the cells to generate membrane protrusions
needed for cell migration. RhoH-transduced cells, however, showed reduced Rac1 activity, reduced polarised cortical F-actin staining and less cell migration in response to
SDF-1α [27]. UsingPηoH-δεϕιχιεντmice, it was investigated in more detail how RhoH modulates migration and
Rac1-promoted cortical rim polarisation [20]. The authors
were able to show that the C-terminal prenylation motif
of the CaaX box is an important regulator of the inhibitory
effect of RhoH on Rac. In myeloid 32D cells transduced
with RhoH, RhoH was localised at the membrane while
deletion of the CaaX box led to an exclusively cytoplasmic
localisation. Since active GTP-bound Rac is localised at
the membrane through interaction of its CaaX box with
lipid rafts, only the membrane-localised form of RhoH is
able to downregulate Rac1 efficiently [20].
The antagonistic function of RhoH had already been
described in the initial study of Li et al., where RhoH was
shown to reduce the RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42-induced activation of the transcription factor NFκB. Jurkat cells stimu-

lated with TNFα show decreased NFκB activity in the
presence of RhoH [19]. Initial experiments showed that
IKKβ expression that is necessary for NFκB activation is
suppressed in the presence of high RhoH amounts, presumably because RhoH inhibits IκB degradation. In addition, it was investigated whether RhoH could activate the
MAP kinases p38, JNK or Erk. Again, as with NFκB, RhoH
overexpression did not induce activation of any of these
proteins itself, but rather acted as a specific negative regulator for Rac and RhoA-induced p38 activity. It was
hypothesised that the inhibition does not affect Rac1 or
the Rac1 GEF TIAM-1, but presumably occurs on the level
of downstream effectors. However, the significance of
these experiments performed in HEK293 cells has not
been corroborated by other studies in a more physiologic
experimental setup.
Since RhoH is GTPase-deficient, other mechanisms must
be available to regulate the activity or function of the protein, one being the possibility of transcriptional regulation. Li et al. tested a couple of stimuli on Jurkat cells and
reported that PMA reduces endogenous RhoH transcripts
after 60–80 min by 80% of the baseline level, while TNFα
treatment did not act as a regulator of RhoH mRNA levels
[19]. So far no comprehensive study has been performed
on potential inducers or regulators of RhoH expression
though it can be anticipated that much can be learned
from the characterisation of these molecules.
In a study aimed at identifying regulators of lymphocyte
adhesion factor 1 (LFA-1), RhoH was found to be of
importance [63]. LFA-1 is a β2 integrin expressed on leukocytes. In lymphocytes, LFA-1 is important for diverse
processes such as migration, antigen presentation or cytotoxicity. On resting leukocytes, LFA-1 is in its non-adhesive state but appropriate stimulation renders LFA-1 active
thereby increasing the adhesiveness of cells. By searching
for a deregulated LFA-1 phenotype using a retroviral insertion mutagenesis approach, Cherry et al. found that a
decrease of RhoH expression activated LFA-1, thus rendering the leukocytes adhesive and therefore active. However,
when the authors tried to decrease LFA-1 mediated adhesion by overexpressing RhoH, no change in adhesion was
detectable. This led the authors to the hypothesis that
endogenous RhoH is already maximally active, i.e. inhibitory for LFA-1, in resting cells. The authors hypothesise
that RhoH provides an inhibitory signal that downregulates activation pathways in resting leukocytes. Recently,
the Brakebusch group investigated whether regulation of
LFA-1 mediated adherence by RhoH can also be observed
in T-lymphocytes, but found that not to be the case [28].
Supporting the theory that RhoH acts as a negative regulator of Rac signalling and other signalling cascades, it was
found that RhoH negatively influences proliferation,

http://www.biosignaling.com/content/6/1/6

migration and engraftment of haematopoietic bone marrow derived progenitor cells [27]. To assess the influence
of RhoH on haematopoietic progenitor cells, cells were
retrovirally transduced with wildtype RhoH and tested in
vitro for their ability to respond to a cytokine stimulus
[27]. In response to stem cell factor (SCF), high RhoH
expression levels reduced growth and formation of myeloid colonies compared to control cells by half, due to an
increase in apoptotic cells. In order to investigate the role
of RhoH in engraftment of haematopoietic cells, RhoH
transduced cells were injected into lethally irradiated mice
and haematopoietic reconstitution was examined six
month post transplantation. Although RhoH transduced
donor cells allowed normal distribution of all lineages,
the percentage of engraftment was severely reduced for
RhoH overexpressing cells (app. 50%). These data indicated that RhoH overexpression might impair long-term
reconstitution of haematopoietic progenitor cells. Conversely, a knockdown of RhoH stimulated proliferation
and survival, as well as SDF-1α mediated migration in vivo
[27]. However, the phenotype of the RhoH-deficient mice
does not suggest that the mice have a defect in maintenance of haematopoietic progenitors [21,28]. Nevertheless, the recent finding that RHOH is underexpressed in
certain types of leukaemia implies that RhoH expression
levels are a crucial factor in protection from the development of haematopoietic malignancies [56,57].
RhoH as a regulator of T-cell signalling
Because RhoH is expressed strongest in T-cells, it was
tested early on whether differentiation of T-cells into Th1
and Th2 subsets leads to varying RhoH expression patterns [19]. Indeed, the level of RhoH is app. 3 times higher
in the Th1 subset. Re-stimulation of cells on day 3 using
anti-CD3 led to a decrease of RhoH expression in Th1 cells
whereas no obvious changes seemed to have occurred in
the Th2 cells.

Using RhoH-deficient mice, the analysis of the function of
RhoH in T-cells was investigated in more detail. Two
groups independently showed that RhoH acts as a positive
regulatory factor for thymocyte selection and T-cell receptor signalling [21,28]. RhoH-deficient mice did not
develop lymphomas and had no obvious defects in HSC
maintenance, but they showed impaired T-cell differentiation attributed to defective T-cell receptor signalling. Tlymphocyte maturation is a tightly regulated process
involving gene rearrangement of TCR genes, negative and
positive selection and eventually proliferative expansion
of selected cells. During this maturation, several checkpoints can be distinguished: β-selection through the preTCR complex and negative and positive selection, controlled by the fully assembled TCRαβ antigen complex,
respectively [64].

Cell Communication and Signaling 2008, 6:6

RhoH-deficient mice were found to have abnormally low
levels of T-lymphocytes and the cellularity of their thymus
was app. 60% lower than in control animals, due to
reduced proliferative cell expansion. In mutant mice, the
number of double negative thymocytes was reduced by
60%, indicating that the development between double
negative (DN) to double positive (DP) stages was disturbed; this was also reflected in an elevated number of
CD44- CD25+ DN3 cells. During thymocyte positive selection, TCR mediated signalling results in upregulation of
markers for positive selection, such as CD5 and CD69. In
RhoH-deficient mice the expression of these markers was
reduced, suggesting that RhoH plays a role in thymocyte
positive selection. Although peripheral thymocytes
expressed the TCR complex at normal levels, anti-CD3ε
stimulation triggered only a reduced proliferative
response suggesting that the down-regulation occurred
downstream of the TCR complex [21]. Injection of irradiated mice with bone marrow cells transduced with RhoH
confirmed the crucial role of RhoH in thymocyte matura-

http://www.biosignaling.com/content/6/1/6

tion and TCR signalling since reconstitution of RhoH
compensated for the defects of RhoH-deficient mice.
In order to identify the potential interaction partner of
RhoH downstream of the TCR, a pulldown assay was performed using GST-coupled RhoH and lysates from Jurkat
cells. A specifically interacting protein was analysed by
mass spectrometry and found to be Zap70. Zap70 is a
tyrosine kinase of the Syk family that is expressed in Tcells and NK-cells which interacts with the CD3ζ chain of
the TCR complex [65]. The physical interaction of RhoH
and Zap70 was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation
studies overexpressing the two proteins in HEK293 cells.
Interestingly, this interaction was enhanced by additional
expression of a Src family tyrosine kinase, Lck, which is
known to be an activator of Zap70 (see Figure 4) [65].
Indeed, the authors found that stimulation of Jurkat cells
with anti-CD3ε increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
RhoH. However, while stimulation was a prerequisite for
the interaction of tyrosine phosphorylated Zap70 with the
TCR, the Zap70-RhoH complex was also detectable in

Figure indispensable for correct TCR activation

RhoH is indispensable for correct TCR activation. Illustration of the proposed mechanism that links RhoH to the active
TCR complex. The ITAM-like motif of RhoH (see figure 1) allows binding of the Zap70 molecule and shuttling to the TCR
CD3ζ chain. Zap70 binding to the CD3ζ chain eventually results in the activation of the linker for activation of T-cells (LAT)
molecule and the so-called LAT signalosome. In the absence of RhoH, translocation of Zap70 to the immunological synapse
and CD3ζ phosphorylation are impaired leading to reduced TCR-induced signalling and impaired thymocyte selection.

unstimulated, resting cells. The consensus motif that is
necessary for binding of Zap70 is a so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation (ITAM) motif, characterised by two tyrosines, spaced by 9–11 amino acids: YXXL/
I(X)6–8YXXL/I. A closer look at the RhoH sequence
revealed that RhoH contains a sequence that the authors
dubbed an ITAM-like motif, where the (iso)leucines at
position +3 are replaced by an alanine. Interestingly, this
motif is absent in any of the other Rho GTPases. Further
mutational analysis confirmed the theory that the two
tyrosines Y73 and Y83 in RhoH are essential for recruitment of Zap70. Deletion of the two SH2 domains in
Zap70 known to bind to the TCR CD3ζ chain also abolished interaction with RhoH.
Like the RhoH-deficient mice, Zap70 null mice have a
developmental block of the maturation at the double negative stage and peripheral thymocytes that are unresponsive to TCR mediated stimuli [66]. This suggests that
RhoH plays a crucial role in TCR mediated Zap70 activity.
Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence staining showed that RhoH acts as a shuttle for Zap70 and
interacts with the pool of Zap70 molecules localised in
the cytoplasm in the absence of antigen presenting cells.
In the presence of an activating signal, the RhoH-Zap70
complex moves to the plasma membrane, where Zap70
then exchanges binding partners and interacts with the
ITAM motif of CD3ζ instead. Zap70 mediated phosphorylation of the scaffold protein LAT and associated molecules such as SLP76 and PLCγ1, which together form the
LAT signalosome, is crucial to initiate downstream events
such as calcium influx or Erk activation (see Figure 4).
Indeed, phosphorylation of LAT, VAV1 and of PLCγ ανδ
Erk, were reduced in RhoH-deficient DP cells [21,28].
Despite the reduced activation of Vav1, the activity of
Rac1 and Rac2 were normal after TCR activation. However, the authors noted that the basal level of Rac1 activity
seemed to be elevated in RhoH-deficient T-cells, suggesting once more that RhoH is an antagonist for Rac1 activity
by inhibiting basal Rac1 activity [28].

Conclusion
The haematopoietic GTPase RhoH is an atypical family
member of the Rho GTPases as it is constitutively active
and not regulated through the classical cycling between
GTP- and GDP-bound state. The protein was originally
cloned as a fusion transcript with LAZ3/BCL6 in a nonHodgkin lymphoma cell line [13] and has since been
found to be mutated or translocated in a number of
human cancers (see Figure 3). Since Ras is a well-known
oncogene [67], it was anticipated that the novel Rho protein also had potential tumourigenic properties. Most
data gathered so far however indicate that in human cancers the absence of a functional RhoH protein or reduced
RhoH expression levels rather than its overexpression may

http://www.biosignaling.com/content/6/1/6

play a role in pathogenesis [32,56,57]. Despite the search
for activating mutations of the gene in haematopoietic
malignancies, only mutations within the non-coding
exons have been found. This indicates that RhoH has no
transforming potential itself, but rather is an important
regulatory molecule that must be expressed in order to
protect the cell from malignant transformation. This is
supported by a number of studies investigating the role of
RhoH in signal transduction in haematopoietic cells,
where RhoH often is associated with negative regulation
of proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis. It
was shown that RhoH is an important antagonist of Rac1,
another Rho GTPase with a known function in cell transformation due to aberrant activation [68]. In a first
attempt at understanding the signalling of RhoH in cancer
cells, or rather its absence of signalling, it was shown that
expression of RhoH is necessary to prevent Rac1 mediated
protection from drug-induced apoptosis [56]. However,
the function of RhoH is not restricted to antagonising Rac
mediated signalling. RhoH-deficient mice showed an
impaired development of thymocytes and reduced TCR
signalling due to inefficient recruitment of Zap70 [21,28].
RhoH contains a novel ITAM-like motif that serves as a
binding site for Zap70, which is then shuttled to the T-cell
receptor complex where it serves as a crucial molecule to
trigger activation of the LAT signalosome. Despite this
important role of RhoH in T-cell development, it has not
been addressed so far whether RhoH is also involved in Tcell specific malignancies, for example in T-cell lymphomas. Conversely, it is well established that RHOH is
implicated in B-cell neoplasms, however, it is currently
not known whether RhoH has a role in modulation of Bcell signalling.
Even though to date no other obvious defects of the
RhoH-deficient mice have been reported, it is to be
expected that RhoH will be an important regulatory molecule in a number of other signalling cascades. In an early
study it was shown that stimulation of neutrophils with
GM-CSF leads to an upregulation of RhoH mRNA, suggesting that RhoH may play a role in diseases characterised by neutrophilic inflammation such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [69]. It will therefore be of immense interest to identify other regulators of
RhoH expression and novel interacting proteins [70].
