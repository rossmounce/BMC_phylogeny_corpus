Abstract
Background: Pathogens have represented an important selective force during the adaptation of modern human
populations to changing social and other environmental conditions. The evolution of the immune system has
therefore been influenced by these pressures. Genomic scans have revealed that immune system is one of the
functions enriched with genes under adaptive selection.
Results: Here, we describe how the innate immune system has responded to these challenges, through the
analysis of resequencing data for 132 innate immunity genes in two human populations. Results are interpreted in
the context of the functional and interaction networks defined by these genes. Nucleotide diversity is lower in the
adaptors and modulators functional classes, and is negatively correlated with the centrality of the proteins within
the interaction network. We also produced a list of candidate genes under positive or balancing selection in each
population detected by neutrality tests and showed that some functional classes are preferential targets for
selection.
Conclusions: We found evidence that the role of each gene in the network conditions the capacity to evolve or
their evolvability: genes at the core of the network are more constrained, while adaptation mostly occurred at
particular positions at the network edges. Interestingly, the functional classes containing most of the genes with
signatures of balancing selection are involved in autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, suggesting a
counterbalance between the beneficial and deleterious effects of the immune response.

Background
Infectious diseases are among the most important selective agents for any vertebrate species. In humans, they
have represented a great challenge in our adaptation to
new environments and social practices, with increasing
population densities sustained by improved agricultural
technologies and cattle domestication favoring their
emergence and spread in the last ten thousand years. The
human immune system seems likely to have played a key
role in the adaption of the different populations to changing conditions and emerging infections. This hypothesis
is supported by recent genomic scans for signatures of
adaptive selection in human populations showing that
immune function is one of the classes enriched with
genes under positive or balancing selection [1-6], the two

evolutionary forces underlying adaptation. The literature
includes a large collection of human genes related to the
host-pathogen interaction with signatures of adaptation
[7,8]. Vertebrate immune function can be divided into
the adaptive, exclusive of this phylogenetic group, and
the ancient innate immune system, common to most
multicellular organisms. Innate immunity constitutes the
first barrier of defense, and acts in a semi-specific way by
recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs), which are essential and conserved components
of the pathogens. Substantial evidence of positive or balancing selection acting on some of these genes has been
reported [9-15].
In this manuscript, we address the analysis of the footprint of the adaptive selection in the innate immune
mechanisms involved in (mostly) antibacterial host
defense. Bacteria have probably been the most important
human pathogens, with a major impact on morbidity and
mortality. Although some of the pathways described here

are also involved in host defense against human parasites,
fungi and viruses, the pattern recognition receptor (PRR)
gene families analyzed (TLRs and NLRs) are the most
important for non-adaptive recognition of bacteria. The
other two major classes of PRR gene families involved in
the host defense to fungi (C-type lectins) and viruses
(RiG-I helicases) are not included in the present study.
There is an increasing interest in characterizing the evolutionary dynamics of proteins in the context of their functional network. Published data on biological networks, for
example in the form of experimentally derived data sets of
protein-protein interactions, or curated databases of functional pathways, have facilitated studies relating evolutionary parameters (mainly the footprint of natural selection)
to network topology [16-19]. We use molecular signatures
in particular genes to explore adaptation of the functional
network, seeking whether human adaptation at the molecular level of the innate immunity system has occurred
preferentially on some functional class or classes (with
more plasticity to respond to the pathogenic pressures) or
in specific positions of the network structure. The final
goal of this work is to unravel past selective forces that
have shaped human immunological responses to bacterial
infections having acted in humans; the approach is based
on detecting adaptations through natural selection uncovered in resequencing information in two populations
(Europeans and Africans). The results are interpreted in
the functional context of gene products interacting in
well-identified networks.

Methods
Selection of genes and DNA sequences

We included in the study as many genes as possible
involved in innate immunity with available resequencing
data. Data for 132 genes were retrieved from different
sources. Sixty-two genes were from the Innate Immunity
Program in Genomics Applications (IIPGA, http://innateimmunity.com[20]), only considering those genes with
available information on the sequencing primers used. In
addition, data for seven genes was obtained from Environmental Genome Project database (NIEHS SNPs, http://
egp.gs.washington.edu), and for 54 from the SeattleSNPs
database (http://pga.gs.washington.edu). All sequence data
available, both from coding and noncoding regions, was
included in the analysis. For the analysis, we also included
the previously published results [11] for eight additional
genes from Innate Immunity Program in Genomics Applications and one from the SeattleSNPs database. Genes
were classified according to their function into a comprehensive functional network (Figure 1). Chimpanzee
sequences (panTro2) were obtained from GenBank
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Ensembl database
(http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) to be used as outgroups. For IL1F7 we used as outgroup the sequence from

Page 2 of 10

Pongo pygmaeus from the Ensemble database. Sequence
alignments were performed with ClustalW [21]. Divergence estimations were retrieved from BioMart database
(http://uswest.ensembl.org/biomart/index.html), only for
unequivocal 1-to-1 hits to functional sequences. dN/dS
values correspond to the comparison of humans and Pan
troglodytes for all genes except TLR5 and IL1F8 (Gorilla
gorilla) and IL1F7 (Pongo pygmaeus).
All included genes from the Innate Immunity Program
in Genomics Applications, and 44 from SeattleSNPs
were resequenced in the same 23 European-American
and 24 African-American samples included in the Coriell CEPH/African American panel (Coriell Institute for
Medical Research, Camden, NJ). The remaining 11
genes from Seattle SNPs were resequenced in 23 European (HapMap CEU) and 24 African individuals (HapMap YRI) individuals. For the seven genes from the
Environmental Genome Project database we retrieved
resequencing data in 22 European (HapMap CEU) and
15 Coriell African American individuals.
Molecular Data Analysis

The following diversity statistics and neutrality tests were
calculated for every gene: heterozygosity or π [22], Tajima’s D [23], Fu and Li’s F*, D*, F and D [24] and the normalized Fay and Wu’s H tests [25] using DnaSP v5 [26]
and MANVa [27]. Indels and triallelic positions were not
included in the analyses. Genes with less than five segregating sites (MYD88 in Africans; MYD88, IL5 and TLR3
in Europeans) where not considered in the neutrality
tests analysis. COSI software [28] was used to calculate
the significance of neutrality tests by means of coalescent
simulations, using the model which takes into consideration the demographic history of humans. COSI produces
data that closely resembles empirical data from African
American, West African and European populations.
1,000 replicates were performed by using the local
recombination rate estimate of each region obtained
from HapMap (http://www.hapmap.org). In the case of
C3 and ITGA8 it was not possible to run the simulations
because of its length and high recombination rate. The
excess of genes in a given functional class under positive,
balancing or both selection was tested by means of Fisher’s Exact test in a two by two table including: the number of genes in this particular functional class under
selection, the number of genes in this particular functional class without evidences of selection, the number of
remaining genes (not in this functional class) under
selection, and the number of remaining genes (not in this
functional class) without evidences of selection.
Network analysis

We used the MiMI plugin [29] for Cytoscape [30] to
retrieve all known interactions for the genes in our

dataset. Specifically, we queried the database with the
132 gene identifiers to retrieve all known protein-protein interactions among those gene products and their
first neighbors. Network statistics were calculated using
the NetworkAnalyzer plugin [31] in Cytoscape.

Results
Gene Selection

We have analyzed publicly available resequencing data
for 132 genes involved in antibacterial innate immunity

in individuals of African and European ancestry (see
Methods). 129 genes are autosomal and only three genes
(IRAK1, TLR7 and TLR8) are located in the X chromosome. All these genes have an unequivocal role in host
defense against bacteria, with some of them also related
to immune response against other pathogens, and were
classified according to their main function in this system
into five categories: receptors, adaptors, modulators,
cytokines and effector molecules (Figure 1). We have also
defined subclasses in the case of the pattern-recognition

Casals et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:202

receptors (TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1, NOD2, TLR3 and
TLR7-9 modules), which can be differentiated according
to their location in the cell membrane (the first three), in
the cytoplasm (NOD1 and NOD2), or in endosomes
(TLR3, TLR7-9). Cytokines have been subclassified
according to their involvement in different immune processes (acute phase, cellular immunity, anti-inflammatory
cytokines, neutrophil function, chemokines, and defense
against extracellular bacterial parasites). Several genes
were included in a certain cytokine functional module
due to their crucial role for the induction of the respective cytokine (e.g. STAT3 gene was included in the Th1
module) or for the role played in the function of the
respective cytokine (e.g. JAK3 in the Th1 module). Five
genes were not included in any of the functional classes
defined (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Nucleotide diversity within a network approach

Nucleotide diversity levels can provide a measure of the
degree of conservation of the different genes and their
comparison across functional classes may shed light on
different intensities of purifying selection. We estimated
the nucleotide diversity measured as the average number
of differences between pairs of sequences (π) for the 132
genes within each population, and analyzed this information in the context of the position of the genes in the
functional network and through the comparison of
diversity levels among the five functional categories
defined (see above).
We obtained the network for all the genes included in
the study considering all known interactions for the 132
gene products, obtained from the MiMI database for
molecular interactions (see Materials & Methods). Interactions could be retrieved for 126 of the 132 genes, and the
final network consisted of 1,561 proteins with a total of
13,002 interactions. A finding emerging from previous studies on the influence of network topology on evolutionary
rate is the observation that highly connected proteins in
the protein-protein interaction network (“hubs”) are more
constrained in their evolution in respect to peripheral
ones [32]. Furthermore, proteins in the periphery of the
interactome have been shown to be more likely to be
under positive selection in the human lineage than more
centrally located ones [17]. In order to test whether this
trend can also be observed among the innate immunity
proteins in our dataset, we investigated the correlations
between nucleotide diversity and two measures of the centrality of nodes within a network: the degree centrality
(defined as the total number of links incident upon a
node) and the betweenness centrality (defined as the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through a node). For
these analyses, we considered all known interactions
within the entire interactome for each of our 126 genes
present in the MiMI database (see Methods), as they more

Page 4 of 10

accurately reflect a particular protein’s position in the network than merely considering all interactions among
themselves only.
Significant negative correlation values were obtained for
degree centrality with nucleotide diversity in Africans (τ =
-0.2, P = 0.001) and Europeans (τ = -0.19, P = 0.002)
(Additional file 1, Figure S2). For betweenness centrality
and nucleotide diversity the correlations were also negative
and marginally significant (τ = -0.12, P = 0.05 for Africans;
τ = -0.11, P = 0.08 for Europeans). When only the coding
sequence is considered these correlations remain significant only in the case of degree centrality in Africans (τ =
-0.15, P = 0.015) (Additional file 1, Figure S3), probably as
a result of lack of power given the much smaller number
of segregating sites. We repeated these analyses comparing
both centrality indexes to divergence, measured as the
ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous changes
(dN/dS) between humans and chimpanzees for each gene.
Again, the correlations are negative and significant for
degree centrality (τ = -0.16, P = 0.01) and marginally significant for betweenness centrality (τ = -0.12, P = 0.05)
(Additional file 1, Figure S4), which is consistent with previous results, even though we are restricting our analyses
to much fewer genes.
An alternative approach to the network analysis can be
applied by considering the hierarchical structure of
innate immunity signaling from a functional perspective.
Figure 1 shows a “bow-tie” shaped organization in terms
of the number of components and the flow of information: a relatively large number of receptor molecules
recognizing different classes of pathogens all signal to a
limited number of intracellular adaptor proteins which,
in turn, can interact with proteins that act as modulators,
and subsequently signal to a diverse array of downstream
molecules, including cytokines and other effector molecules (Figure 1). This bow-tie structure characterized by
a large number of “inputs”, a relatively small number of
central control nodes which elaborates the information,
and a large number of “outputs”, seems to be a topological organization widely adopted by metabolic networks
[33-35] and also by the immunity system signaling
network [36].
Given this structure, one can hypothesize that the
amount of gene variation should follow a similar pattern
to the one obtained in the context of the position of the
genes in the network, with the adaptors common to all
different pathogen responses being more constrained
than both up- and downstream proteins, as previously
reported [33]. Table 1 shows the average value of nucleotide diversity observed in the different functional classes,
both using the whole sequence and only the coding
sequence. Adaptors and modulators show significantly
lower diversity values. When the whole available
sequence for the gene is considered, adaptors show lower

values of nucleotide diversity that are significant in Africans (unpaired t-test P = 0.01) although not in Europeans
(P = 0.09). Considering only the coding sequence, this
difference is significant in Africans for the adaptors (P =
0.006) and the modulators (P = 0.05). We also used a
permutation procedure to test this hypothesis, where the
mean nucleotide diversity calculated for each defined
functional category in the original data is compared to
10,000 replicates with class labels randomly permuted.
Significance is reached in adaptors for Africans (P =
0.004) and Europeans (P = 0.03) when using the whole
sequence, and for adaptors in Africans for the coding
sequence (P = 0.04) (Additional file 1, Figures S5 and S6).
We repeated this analysis for molecular divergence and,
although the adaptors and modulators also show the lowest dN/dS values among the five main functional categories, these differences were not statistically significant
(Additional file 1, Table S2).
Some functional classes are preferential targets for
adaptive selection

We evaluated if some functional categories are also preferential targets for positive or balancing selection. We performed six different neutrality tests (see Methods) to
detect genes with an excess of rare or intermediate variants, which after correcting for demographiy can suggest
positive or balancing selection. Tajima’s D and Fu and Li’s
D* and F* use the intraspecific variation data only, whereas
Fu and Li’s D and F and the normalized Fay and Wu’s H
tests compare these intraspecific information to a
sequence from another species (outgroup). Tajima’s D,
and Fu and Li’s D* and F* tests are based on the comparison of low frequency variants (Tajima’s D) or singletons
(Fu and Li’s D* and F*) to intermediate variants. Fu and Li

D and F tests are based on the comparison of mutations in
the external branches of the genealogy to the total number
of mutations and to the average number of nucleotide differences between pairs of sequences, respectively. In these
five tests, values lower than expected under neutrality are
obtained when there is an excess of rare variants (low frequency, singletons, mutations at external branches), and
values higher than expected under neutrality are obtained
when there is an excess of intermediate frequency variants.
Fay and Wu’s H and its normalized test have been proven
to have power to detect the selective sweeps increasing the
frequency of the derived alleles (those different to the
allele in the outgroup species) produced by positive selection or initial stages of balancing selection [25]. The significance of these tests was evaluated by comparing the
results for each gene to the rest of the genes included in
the study (Figure 2), since all the sequences are supposed
to share the same demographic history. We considered a
gene to show evidence of positive or balancing selection if
it was included in the 95th upper or lower percentiles for
two or more neutrality test in the same population. Additionally, for those genes statistical significance was also
assessed by means of coalescent simulations that resemble
the demographic history of Africans and Europeans (see
Methods) (Additional file 1, Table S3). These methods
should exclude the possibility of these signals being produced randomly or by demographic events such as expansion or population contractions. Moreover, our aim is to
identify different selective pressures acting on the different
functional classes, rather than describing unequivocal signatures of selection in a particular gene. These possible
random effects of demography in a particular gene are
also minimized by pooling together the genes in the same
functional class, as we did for the subsequent analysis.

Although the neutrality tests used have more power to

detect positive rather than purifying selection [37] we
have indicated among the genes under positive selection
those with significant results in the Fay and Wu’s H test
as genes with unequivocal signatures of positive selection (Table 2). From the total of 132 genes, 31 show
signs of adaptive selection: 17 of positive selection (8 in

Africans and 10 in Europeans, with MPO in the two
populations) and 14 of balancing selection (9 in Africans
and 10 in Europeans, with LY96, IL18RAP, IL1F5, IL1F7
and C3 in the two populations). Some of them have
been previously reported by independent studies using
the same or similar datasets: balancing selection in
IL1F5, IL1F7, IL1F10 and IL18RAP [13] and positive
selection in the TLR1-TLR6-TLR10 region finally attributed to TLR1 [38]. It has to be noted that IL1A, IL1F7,
IL1F5 and IL1F10 are located in a region spanning 300
kb at chromosome 2. As discussed in Fumagalli et al
[13], it seems improbable that a hitchhiking effect is
producing all these signatures even between the closest
genes (IL1F5 and IL1F10), given the low LD and presence of recombination hotspots in this region, as well
as the fact that balancing selection signatures have been
proven to spread only over small regions. Moreover,
other genes included in this region (IL1B, IL1F9, IL1F6
and IL1F8) did not show excess of intermediate variants.
Beyond signatures of adaptive selection on specific
genes, we have analyzed the effect of functional classes.
Figure 2 shows the results of the six neutrality tests performed. We tested for an excess of candidate genes
under positive or balancing selection (or both) in each
functional class, by comparing the number of genes with
and without significant evidence of adaptive selection in
this class against the rest of the genes included in the
study (see Materials and Methods). Genes with statistical
evidence for positive or balancing selection are not randomly distributed among the different functional classes,
and tend to accumulate in a reduced number of classes.
Specifically, there is an unexpected high number of acute
phase proteins showing signatures of balancing selection,
both in Africans and Europeans (Fisher’s exact test P =
0.03 and 0.008, respectively). This excess of genes under
balancing selection in this functional category remains
statistically significant even if IL1F5 and IL1F10 signatures in Europeans are considered to be produced by the
same selective event (P = 0.03). Remarkably, all genes in
that category with signatures of balancing selection in
both Europeans and Africans are included in the IL1 or
TNF family (Figure 1). Moreover MEFV also shows an
excess of intermediate variants in one of the neutrality
tests in Europeans, and signatures of balancing selection
have been previously reported [12,13]. The complement
proteins also show a significant enrichment for genes
under balancing selection in Africans (Fisher’s exact test
P = 0.01). Finally, the receptors are also overrepresented
among the genes showing signatures of positive or balancing selection, suggesting adaptive selection events. In
this case, this tendency is only observed in Europeans
(Fisher’s exact test P = 0.04), and is due to an excess of
extracellular receptors (Fisher’s exact test P = 0.02).

Discussion
A high number of genes analyzed here have showed
signs of adaptive selection. Even if data is not comparable to whole genome scans looking at the footprint of
positive selection with SNP data, the five studies published so far [2-4,6,39] all reviewed in [40] find from
444 to 1,030 genomic regions as candidates for positive
selection, which represents a very small fraction of the
genome (< 4%). Thus our results support previous evidence that immunity genes have likely been preferential
targets of recent adaptive selection in human populations. The excess of genes under adaptive selection is
still more striking when balancing selection is considered. Balancing selection has traditionally been considered to have acted less frequently on human
populations, and the number of reported cases is smaller
in comparison to positive selection. However, this difference could be at least partially due to the intrinsic difficulties presented by its detection [1].
Scientific literature contains several examples of hostpathogen interaction genes with evidences of balancing
selection. In addition to some well known cases as the
human major histocompatibility complex, more recently
several works have described the action of balancing
selection on additional immunity genes [10-14,41-43]
and blood group antigen genes that are supposed to act
as molecular targets for pathogens [12,13,43-45]. The
first genome scan for signatures of balancing selection
has also confirmed an enrichment of immune system
and host-pathogen interaction related genes [1].
The high number of immunity genes that are under balancing selection is presumably due to a beneficial effect in
infections, that is counterbalanced by deleterious effects in
autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions (Figure 3)
[11]. The IL-1 family is overrepresented (most abundantly
and strongly under balanced selection, with 6 genes represented in both European and African populations). Additionally, signatures of balancing selection have also been
reported in the Mediterranean Fever gene, MEFV, another
member of this family [12,13]. There are also members of
the complement (three genes) and the TNF family (TNFb/
LTa) showing signatures of balancing selection. While
their role in host defense is well documented, these genes
encode the main proinflammatory mediators of the two
most important classes of sterile inflammation disorders:
the autoinflammatory diseases (e.g. Crohn’s disease, gout,
autoinflammatory syndromes, Behcet’s disease) in which
inflammation is mediated by the IL-1 family, and the autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematous, type 1 diabetes) in which the TNF family
and complement play a central role [46]. Alternatively,
variants found at genes under balancing selection could be
conferring susceptibility to different pathogens and their

effect on autoimmunity would be a consequence of past
humans adaptations, as suggested recently for IFIH1, a
innate immunity gene involved in resistance to virus [15].
The fact that some of the genes found to be under balancing selection are exactly those encoding the major mediators of human autoinflammatory and autoimmune
pathologies is relevant.
The dissection of the innate immune system presented
here allows inferring other important biological consequences. Selection signatures at receptor genes support
the major evolutionary flexibility described in extracellular TLRs compared to the intracellular ones [38,47]. One
important question that may be also asked is which
major class of bacteria could have exerted the evolutionary pressures observed here. As the innate immune system is relatively non-specific, any genetic information
obtained in the present study cannot refer to specific species or even families, but rather to broad groups of
pathogens: both Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococci and Streptococci, mycobacteria) and Gram-negative
bacteria (Salmonella and other enterobacteriaceae, Yersinia pestis) contain pathogens that had a major impact on
human populations during history. An answer to the
question of whether both these two groups of bacteria
exerted evolutionary pressures cannot be obtained from
the selection profile of effector genes such as defensins or
cytokines, as these proteins are generally necessary for
host defense to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative

bacteria. In contrast, a certain level of specificity of the
innate immune response can be seen by the recognition
of either Gram-positive bacteria mainly by the TLR2/
TLR1/TLR6/TLR10 cluster, while Gram-negative bacteria recognition is heavily reliant on the TLR4 pathway
[48]. In our study we found signatures of selection in
genes from both the TLR2 cluster (TLR2, TLR6, TLR10)
and the TLR4 pathway (LY64, LY96, CD14), suggesting
that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria
have exerted pressure on innate immunity genes. In addition, TLR9, a pathogen recognition receptor recognizing
unmethylated DNA from both Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria [49] showed also signatures of
selection in Europeans. The exclusive positive selection
of TLR9 and TLR10 (or TLR1) pathways in Europeans
may be related to more recent responses that could have
been related to the introduction of agriculture and zoonotic diseases (e.g. Brucella, Coxiella) or the major epidemics of the medieval periods (e.g. Yersinia pestis
causing pandemics including pneumonic, septicaemic
and bubonic plague). However, at this point one also has
to be aware that some of these receptors have also a role
for recognition of other types of pathogens (e.g. TLR9 for
recognition of DNA from certain viruses or parasites, or
TLR2/TLR4 recognizing also malaria and fungal structures) and although these are secondary recognition
pathways for these microorganisms, one cannot exclude
evolutionary pressures of non-bacterial pathogens on
some of the genes analyzed here.

Conclusions
Overall, our results suggest that the innate immune system
has had enough plasticity to play an important role in the
adaptation of modern humans to new environments.
Analysis of the protein-protein interaction network suggests a structural and functional constraint on genes that
occupy a central position in the innate immunity network.
This network is organized into a bow tie structure, consisting in a large number of receptors, a central small
number of adaptor genes (the bow tie knot) and a large
number of effectors. The bow tie structure is already
known to characterize many metabolic and system networks and it is recognized as a topological feature which
provides robustness to systems [33,50]. It also has the
advantage of making robustness compatible with a high
capacity to evolve (or evolvability): the knot provides
robustness to the system by easily accommodating for perturbations, while a great variability is allowed at the edges
of the bow tie making possible the generation of new functionalities [33]. While the core of the bow tie structure is
highly conserved, signatures of adaptation are found at the
bow tie edges. Therefore, the amount of selection acting
on each gene appeared therefore highly dependent on its
position in the network structure. This clearly shows the

strength of the constraint represented by the topology of
the network on the evolution of individual genes, which is
able to explain much better the adaptive landscape of
innate immunity in humans.
