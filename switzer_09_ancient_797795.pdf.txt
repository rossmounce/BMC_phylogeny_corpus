Abstract
Background: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 4 (HTLV-4) is a new deltaretrovirus recently
identified in a primate hunter in Cameroon. Limited sequence analysis previously showed that
HTLV-4 may be distinct from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3, and their simian counterparts, STLV1, STLV-2, and STLV-3, respectively. Analysis of full-length genomes can provide basic information
on the evolutionary history and replication and pathogenic potential of new viruses.
Results: We report here the first complete HTLV-4 sequence obtained by PCR-based genome
walking using uncultured peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from an HTLV-4-infected person. The
HTLV-4(1863LE) genome is 8791-bp long and is equidistant from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3
sharing only 62–71% nucleotide identity. HTLV-4 has a prototypic genomic structure with all
enzymatic, regulatory, and structural proteins preserved. Like STLV-2, STLV-3, and HTLV-3,
HTLV-4 is missing a third 21-bp transcription element found in the long terminal repeats of HTLV1 and HTLV-2 but instead contains unique c-Myb and pre B-cell leukemic transcription factor
binding sites. Like HTLV-2, the PDZ motif important for cellular signal transduction and
transformation in HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 is missing in the C-terminus of the HTLV-4 Tax protein. A
basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP) region located in the antisense strand of HTLV-1 and believed to play
a role in viral replication and oncogenesis, was also found in the complementary strand of HTLV4. Detailed phylogenetic analysis shows that HTLV-4 is clearly a monophyletic viral group. Dating
using a relaxed molecular clock inferred that the most recent common ancestor of HTLV-4 and
HTLV-2/STLV-2 occurred 49,800 to 378,000 years ago making this the oldest known PTLV lineage.
Interestingly, this period coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens sapiens during the Middle
Pleistocene suggesting that early humans may have been susceptible hosts for the ancestral HTLV4.

Conclusion: The inferred ancient origin of HTLV-4 coinciding with the appearance of Homo
sapiens, the propensity of STLVs to cross-species into humans, the fact that HTLV-1 and -2 spread
globally following migrations of ancient populations, all suggest that HTLV-4 may be prevalent.
Expanded surveillance and clinical studies are needed to better define the epidemiology and public
health importance of HTLV-4 infection.

Background
Deltaretroviruses are a diverse group of human and simian T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV and STLV, respectively)
that until lately were composed of only two distinct
human groups called HTLV types 1 and 2 [1-7]. Two new
HTLVs, HTLV-3 and HTLV-4, were recently identified in
primate hunters in Cameroon effectively doubling the
genetic diversity of deltaretroviruses in humans [6,8]. Collectively, members of the HTLV groups and their STLV
analogues are called primate T-lymphotropic viruses
(PTLV) with PTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3 being composed
of HTLV-1/STLV-1, HTLV-2/STLV-2, and HTLV-3/STLV-3,
respectively. The PTLV-4 group currently has only one
member, HTLV-4, since a simian counterpart has yet to be
identified [6].
STLV-1 has a broad geographic distribution in nonhuman
primates (NHPs) in both Asia and Africa thus providing
humans with historical and contemporaneous opportunities for exposure to this virus [2,4,5,9,10]. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis of simian T-lymphotropic viruses type 1
(STLV-1) and global HTLV-1 sequences suggests that different STLV-1s were introduced into humans multiple
times in the past resulting in at least six phylogenetically
distinct HTLV-1 subtypes [1-5,11]. Recently, a new HTLV1 subtype was found in Cameroon that was closest phylogenetically to STLV-1 from monkeys hunted in this region
and which shared greater that 99% nucleotide identity [6].
Since similar high sequence identities are typically seen in
both vertical and horizontal linked transmission cases of
HTLV-1 [12-14], the finding of this new HTLV-1 subtype
in Cameroon suggests a relatively recent cross-species
transmission of STLV-1 to this primate hunter and that
these zoonotic infections continue to occur in persons
naturally exposed to NHPs.
Although a simian T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (STLV-2)
has been identified in two troops of captive bonobos (Pan
paniscus), the zoonotic relationship of this divergent virus
to HTLV-2 is less clear [15-17]. Like STLV-1, STLV-3 also
has a broad and ancient geographic distribution across
Africa [9,10,18-23]. Thus, while only three distinct HTLV3 strains have been identified to date in Cameroon
[6,8,24], it is conceivable that HTLV-3 may be prevalent
throughout Africa and, like HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, potentially could be spread globally through migrations of

infected human populations. Expanded screening is
needed to define the prevalence of HTLV-3 in human populations. Likewise, the epidemiology of HTLV-4 is not
well understood since only a single human infection has
been reported and a simian counterpart has yet to be identified [6]. Although limited sequencing of very small gene
regions showed that HTLV-4 is most genetically related to
STLV-2 and HTLV-2, but is a distinct lineage separate from
all known PTLVs [6], understanding the evolutionary relationship of HTLV-4 to known PTLVs requires additional
phylogenetic analyses using longer sequences or the complete viral genome.
Like HIV, both HTLV-1 and -2 have spread globally and
are pathogenic human viruses [1,2,5,7,25]. HTLV-1 causes
adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraperesis (HAM/TSP),
and other inflammatory diseases in less than 5% of those
infected [2,5,7]. HTLV-2 is less pathogenic than HTLV-1
and has been associated with a neurologic disease similar
to HAM/TSP [1]. The recent identification of HTLV-3 and
HTLV-4 in only four persons limits an evaluation of the
disease potential and secondary transmissibility of these
novel viruses [6,8,24]. However, complete genomic
sequences of these viruses can provide insights on the
genetic structure and whether functional motifs that are
important for viral expression and HTLV-induced leukemogenesis are preserved [6,8,24,26-30]. In addition,
determination of the viral sequence will be important to
develop improved diagnostic assays to better understand
the epidemiology of this novel human virus.
In this paper, we report the first full-length sequence of
HTLV-4 and demonstrate by detailed phylogenetic analysis that this virus clearly falls outside the diversity of all
other PTLVs. The observed low nucleotide substitution
rate, absence of evident genetic recombination, and conserved genomic structure of HTLV-4 demonstrate the
genetic stability of this virus. In addition, molecular dating suggests that the HTLV-4 lineage split from the progenitor of PTLV-2 about 200 millennia ago and is older
than the ancestors of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3. We
also highlight biologically important molecular features
in HTLV-4 that are unique or common to HTLV-1, HTLV2, and HTLV-3.

Results
Comparison of the HTLV-4(1863LE) proviral genome with
prototypical PTLVs
The complete genome of HTLV-4(1863LE) was obtained
using a PCR strategy as depicted in Fig. 1 and was determined to be 8791-bp in length. Comparison of the HTLV4(1863LE) sequence with prototypical PTLV genomes
demonstrates that this newly identified human virus is
nearly equidistant from HTLV-1 (62% identiity), PTLV-2
(70.7% identity), and PTLV-3 (63.4% identity) groups
across the genome (Table 1). The most genetic divergence
between HTLV-4 and the other PTLV groups was seen in
the LTR (43–65%) and protease (pro) gene (59–70%),
while the greatest nucleotide identity and amino acid similarity was observed within the highly conserved regulatory genes, tax and rex (73–81% and 58–91%,
respectively). This relationship was highlighted further by
comparing HTLV-4(1863LE) with prototypical full-length
STLV and HTLV genomes in a similarity plot analysis,
where the highest similarity was seen in the highly conserved tax gene, which is located at the 5' end of the pX
region of the genome (Fig. 2). As seen within other PTLV
groups [31], no clear evidence of genetic recombination
of HTLV-4(1863LE) with prototypical HTLV and STLV
proviral sequences was observed using bootscanning
analysis in the SimPlot program (data not shown).
Phylogenetic analysis
The unique genetic relationship of HTLV-4(1863LE) to
other PTLVs was confirmed by Bayesian phylogenetic

analysis that inferred trees using alignments of each major
viral gene in the PTLV genome after excluding 3rd codon
positions (cdp) which were significantly saturated as
determined by pair-wise transition and transversion versus genetic divergence plots using the DAMBE program
(Additional file 1, Fig. S1). At the 3rd cdp transitions and
transversions plateaued indicating sequence saturation
(Additional file 1, Fig. S1). In contrast, transitions and
transversions increased linearly for the 1st and 2nd cdp
without reaching a plateau indicating they still retained
enough phylogenetic signal (Additional file 1, Fig. S1).
Maximum clade credibility trees inferred by using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler showed
three major, well supported, monophyletic PTLV groups
(posterior probability p = 1.0) with HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and
HTLV-3, each clustering in separate clades (Figs. 3, 4, 5
and 6). For each gene region analyzed, HTLV-4 appears as
an independent and highly divergent monophyletic lineage sharing a common ancestor with the PTLV-2 clade (p
= 1.0). The phylogenetic relationships among PTLV lineages inferred from different gene regions were also similar
(Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6). The only exception was the monophyletic PTLV-3 lineage which was either a sister lineage
to PTLV-4/PTLV-2 or PTLV-5/PTLV-1 [10] in the gag (Fig.
3) and env (Fig. 5) or pol (Fig. 4) and tax (Fig. 6) tree topologies, respectively, but in each case with weak posterior
probabilities (p < 0.75) (Figs 3, 4, 5 and 6). Similarly, the
position of the PTLV-3 phylogroup was unresolved using
both the maximum likelihood (ML) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) methods (Additional file 1, Fig. S2). The long

Organization of the HTLV-4 genome (a) and schematic representation of the PCR-based genome walking
strategy (b). (a) shown are non-coding long terminal repeats (LTR), coding regions for all major proteins (gag, group specific
antigen; pro, protease; pol, polymerase; env, envelope; rex, regulator of expression; tax, transactivator), HTLV basic leucine zipper (HBZ), and 3' genomic open reading frames (ORF) of unknown function. Putative splice donor (sd) and splice acceptor (sa)
sites are indicated. (b) Small proviral sequences (purple bars) were first amplified from each major gene region and the long
terminal repeat using generic primers as described in methods. The complete proviral sequence was then obtained by using
PCR primers located within each major gene region by genome walking as indicated with arrows and orange bars.

branch length leading to the HTLV-4 strain suggests an
ancient separation of this lineage from PTLV-2. Similarly,
STLV-1(MarB43) and STLV-2 each formed distinct lineages from PTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively, with long
branch lengths (Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6). These findings support further the recent re-classification of STLV1(MarB43) as a new PTLV lineage called STLV-5 and the
need to re-classify STLV-2 as a distinct PTLV group [10].
The unequivocal monophyletic relationship of HTLV-4 to
other PTLVs was supported further by phylogenetic inference of similar tree topologies with robust statistical support obtained with NJ and ML analysis, using both
separate alignments for each genes and the full-length
genome without LTRs (Additional file 1, Fig. S2).
Dating the origin of HTLV-4(1863LE) and other PTLVs
The long branch leading to the HTLV-4 strain suggests an
ancient, independent evolution of this human retrovirus.

Hence, additional molecular analyses were performed to
estimate the divergence times of the HTLV and PTLV lineages. Although we and others have reported finding a
clock-like behavior of PTLV sequences using partial LTR or
env sequences [3,18-20], we were unable to confirm these
results. Instead, the clock hypothesis was strongly rejected
(p < 0.00001) for the 1st + 2nd codon position alignment
of full-length PTLV genomes without LTRs, as well as for
separate alignments of full-length gag, pol, env and tax
genes (p < 0.00001 in each case) suggesting significant
evolutionary rate heterogeneity among the different viral
lineages. Indeed, sequence analysis showed unequal base
composition for some lineages and substitution saturation at the 3rd codon position (cdp) for all PTLVs (Additional file 1, Fig. S1). Substitution saturation was not
observed in the 1st and 2nd cdps (Additional file 1, Fig. S1)
and these sites were thus suitable for estimating posterior

Similarity plot analysis of the full-length HTLV-4(1863LE) and PTLV genomes using a 200-bp window size in 20

evolutionary rates and divergence dates of PTLV by using
Bayesian analysis with a MCMC algorithm.
The relaxed molecular clock was calibrated with two independent molecular calibration points; 12,000 – 30,000 ya
as confidence intervals for the origin of HTLV-2 as it
migrated out of Africa and Asia and into the Americas via
the Bering land bridge and 40,000 – 60,000 ya as confidence intervals for the origin of HTLV-1 in Melanesia as it
became populated with people from Asia [23,32,33]. The
use of two calibration points has previously been shown
to provide more reliable estimates of PTLV substitution
rates than a single calibration date [3,32]. Using these
methods we found that the PTLV posterior mean evolutionary rates differed for each of the four major coding
regions and ranged from 2.89 × 10-7 to 7.92 × 10-7 substitutions/site/year (Table 2). The highest mean evolutionary rate was seen in pol while the lowest rate was observed
in gag (Table 2). These rates are consistent with those calculated previously using the same calibration points with
and without enforcing a molecular clock [3,4,1820,23,31,32], including those of Lemey et al. who also
found disparate PTLV evolutionary rates across the PTLV
genome [33].

Median estimates and 95% high posterior density (95%
HPD) intervals for the time of the most recent common
ancestor (tMRCA) of the major PTLV clades according to
different gene regions are given in Table 3. The tMRCA of
the PTLV tree ranged between 214,650 (tax gene) and
385,100 ya (env gene) confirming an ancient evolution of
the primate deltaretroviruses [3]. These dates are lower
than those reported previously for the PTLV cenancestor
which were inferred using methods less accurate than the
Bayesian analyses employed here [3,4]. Remarkably, the
inferred PTLV divergence dates were very similar for each
gene region with those estimated for the highly conserved
tax gene being slightly lower (Table 3). Nevertheless, the
95% HPD intervals overlapped for all four genes (Table 3)
supporting the strength of the inferred PTLV divergence
dates. Estimates for the PTLV-4 progenitor split from
PTLV-2 ranged between 124,250 ya (c.i., 49,800 –
218,250 ya) in the tax gene to 221,650 ya (c.i., 89,650 –
378,000 ya) in the env gene and were comparatively earlier than the median tMRCA of PTLV-1 (54,250–75,100
ya), PTLV-2 (75,200–128,600 ya), and PTLV-3 (40,850–
71,700 ya) clades (Table 3). These results suggest that the
HTLV-4/PTLV-2 ancestor may represent the oldest PTLV
identified to date.

Phylogenetic relationship of HTLV-4(1863LE) to other PTLVs in gag using Bayesian inference. First and second
codon positions of gag were used to generate PTLV phylogenies by sampling 10,000 trees with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method under a relaxed clock model, and the maximum clade credibility tree, i.e. the tree with the maximum product of the
posterior clade probabilities, was chosen. Branch lengths are proportional to median divergence times in years estimated from
the post-burn in trees with the scale at the bottom indicating 100,000 years. Posterior probabilities for each node are indicated. Branches leading to PTLV-1, HTLV-2 and PTLV-3 sequences are drawn in red, blue and green respectively. The branch
leading to HTLV-4(1863LE), STLV-2, and to the divergent MarB43 strain are drawn in magenta, purple, and yellow respectively.

Genomic organization and characterization of the HTLV4(1863LE) structural and enzymatic proteins, and the LTR
The genomic structure of HTLV-4(1863LE) was similar to
that of other PTLVs and included the structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins all flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs) (Fig. 1). Like HTLV-3 (697-bp), the
HTLV-4(1863LE) LTR (696-bp) was smaller than that of
HTLV-1 (756-bp) and HTLV-2 (764-bp), by having two
rather than the typical three 21-bp transcription regulatory repeat sequences in the U3 region of HTLV-1 and
HTLV-2 (Fig. 7) [18-20,23,31,34,35]. The distal 21-bp
repeat element found in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 is absent
from the HTLV-4(1863LE) genome (Fig. 7). Others have
shown that deletion of the middle, rather than the distal
21-bp element, is more critical for the loss of basal HTLV1 transcription levels [36]. In addition, the lack of the distal 21-bp repeat does not seem to affect viral expression of
PTLV-3 [35,37]. Nonetheless, additional studies are
needed to determine what effect the absence of a 21-bp
element has on HTLV-4(1863LE) gene expression and
replication.

Other regulatory motifs such as the polyadenylation signal, TATA box, and cap site were all conserved in the
HTLV-4(1863LE) LTR (Fig. 7). Highly conserved pre-B cell
leukemia (Pbx-1, TGACAG) and c-Myb (YAACKG) transcription factor binding sites were also identified at positions 1–6 and 86–91 of the LTR, respectively, upstream of
the first 21-bp repeat element (Fig. 7). The Pbx-1 and cMyb sites are also conserved in the LTRs of STLV-2 and
two nearly identical PTLV-3 strains (STLV-3(CTO604) and
HTLV-3(Pyl43)) [15,16,19,34], respectively, but are
absent in other PTLV LTRs. Binding to the predicted c-Myb
target sequence within the HTLV-4 LTR oligonucleotide
was observed and was specific based upon banding patterns observed in the presence of specific and non-specific
oligonucleotide competitors in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The shifted band was identified as
c-Myb since an anti-c-Myb antibody supershifted the complex while an unrelated antibody did not (Fig 8). While
this analysis confirms the specificity of the putative c-Myb
binding site in the HTLV-4 LTR oligonucleotide and likely
reflects binding of c-Myb to the HTLV-4 LTR, this remains

to be tested in vivo. Secondary structure analysis of the LTR
RNA sequence predicted a stable stem loop structure from
nucleotides 425 – 466 (Fig 9) similar to that shown to be
essential for Rex-responsive viral gene expression in both
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.
Translation of predicted protein open reading frames
(ORFs) across the viral genome identified all major Gag,
Pro (protease), Pol, and Env proteins, as well as the regulatory proteins, Tax and Rex (Fig. 1). Translation of the
overlapping gag and pro and pro and pol ORFs occurs by
one or more successive -1 ribosomal frameshifts that align
the different ORFs. The conserved slippage nucleotide
sequence 6(A)-8nt-6(G)-11nt-6(C) is present in the GagPro overlap starting at nucleotide 1997. Similarly, the ProPol overlap slippage sequence (TTTAAAC) was identical
to that seen in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 but which is different
from that found in HTLV-3 by a single nucleotide substitution at the beginning of this motif (GTTAAAC) [31].

Importantly, the asparagine codon (AAC) crucial for the
slippage mechanism is conserved in all HTLVs.
The structural and group-specific precursor Gag protein
consisted of 424 amino acids (aa), and is predicted to be
cleaved into the three core proteins p19 (matrix), p24
(capsid), and p15 (nucleocapsid) similar to HTLV-1,
HTLV-2, and HTLV-3. Across PTLVs, Gag is one of the
most conserved proteins, with the HTLV-4 Gag having
82% to 86% similarity to HTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3
(Table 1). The Gag capsid protein (214 aa) showed about
90% to 93% similarity to other PTLV capsids, while the
matrix (129 aa) and nucleocapsid (81 aa) proteins were
somewhat less conserved, showing less than 85% similarity to HTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3 (Table 1). The conservation of the capsid protein supports the observed crossreactivity to Gag seen with plasma from the HTLV-4infected person in Western blot (WB) assays employing
HTLV-1 antigens [6,38].

Phylogenetic relationship of HTLV-4(1863LE) to other PTLVs in env using Bayesian inference. First and second
codon positions of env sequences were used to generate PTLV phylogenies by sampling 10,000 trees with a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method under a relaxed clock model, and the maximum clade credibility tree, i.e. the tree with the maximum
product of the posterior clade probabilities, was chosen. Branch lengths are proportional to median divergence times in years
estimated from the post-burn in trees with the scale at the bottom indicating 100,000 years. Posterior probabilities for each

The branch leading to HTLV-4(1863LE), STLV-2, and to the divergent MarB43 strain are drawn in magenta, purple, and yellow
respectively.

The predicted size of the HTLV-4 (1863LE) Env polyprotein is 485 aa, which is slightly shorter than the Env of
PTLV-2 (486 aa), PTLV-1 (488 aa), and PTLV-3 (491–492
aa). The Env surface (SU) protein (307 aa) showed the
most genetic divergence from other PTLVs with only 70%
– 81% similarity, while the transmembrane (TM) protein
(178 aa) was highly conserved across all PTLVs, sharing
85% – 94% similarity, supporting the use of recombinant
HTLV-1 TM protein (GD21) on WB strips to identify
divergent PTLVs, including HTLV-4. The HTLV-4(1863LE)
SU showed about 86% similarity to the HTLV-2 type specific SU peptide (K55) despite the observed weak reactivity of anti-HTLV-4(1863LE) antibodies to [6,38] K55
spiked onto WB strips. This amino acid similarity is somewhat greater than the 67.4% and 72.1% similarity of the
HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 SUs to K55, respectively, allowing
serologic discrimination of HTLV-2 from HTLV-1 in this
region. In contrast, the HTLV-4(1863LE), HTLV-2, and
HTLV-3 SUs share from 68.8% to 70.8% similarity to the
HTLV-1 type specific SU peptide (MTA-1). Although these

results are limited to testing the sera of a single HTLV-4infected individual, they suggest that higher antibody
reactivity to the HTLV-2-type specific peptide may be
observed in HTLV-4-infected persons [38].
The glucose transporter GLUT1 has been shown to be the
HTLV-1 and -2 envelope receptor and a retrovirus binding
domain (RBD) for GLUT1 has been identified in the SU of
these viruses [39,40]. Analysis of the HTLV-4 Env protein
revealed a putative RBD located at positions 85 – 138 of
the SU that shared about 80%, 78%, and 87% amino acid
similarity with the RBDs of HTLV-1(ATK), HTLV-2(MoT),
and that identified by analysis of the HTLV-3(2026ND)
Env, respectively. In addition, both aspartic acid and the
tyrosine residues located as positions 106 and 114 of
HTLV-1(ATK) are highly conserved in the putative HTLV4 RBD and all other PTLV RBDs (data not shown), supporting a critical role for these residues as the receptor
binding core as previously suggested [41].

Characterization of Regulatory and Accessory Proteins of
HTLV-4(1863LE)
The HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3 Tax proteins (Tax1,
Tax2, and Tax3, respectively) transactivate initiation of
viral gene expression from the promoter located in the 5'
LTR and are thus essential for viral replication [27,30,42].
Tax1 and Tax2 have also been shown to be important for
T-cell immortalization [27,30]. To characterize the HTLV4 Tax (Tax4) we compared the sequence of Tax4 with

those of prototypic HTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3s to determine if motifs associated with specific Tax functions were
preserved between each group. Alignment of the predicted
Tax4 sequence shows excellent conservation of the critical
functional regions, including the nuclear localization signal (NLS), cAMP response element (CREB) binding protein (CBP)/P300 binding motifs, and nuclear export
signal (NES) (Fig. 10). Three sets of amino acids (M1,
M22, M47) shown to be important for Tax1 transactiva-

2 The

tion and activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kβ pathway
are also highly conserved in Tax4 (Fig. 10) [43]. The C-terminal transcriptional activating domain (CR2), essential
for CBP/p300 binding, was also conserved within Tax4,
except for two mutations, N to T and I/V to F, at positions
two and five of the motif, respectively (Fig. 10). However,
the CR2 binding domain of the STLV-3 Tax, which contains these identical mutations, has been shown recently
to retain its ability to bind CBP and to a lesser extent p300
with no deleterious effect on transactivation of the viral
promoter [42].
Although important functional motifs are highly conserved in PTLVs, phenotypic differences between HTLV-1
and HTLV-2 Tax proteins have lead to speculation that
these differences account for the different pathologies
associated with both HTLVs [27]. Recently, the C-terminus of Tax1, but not Tax2, has been shown to contain a
conserved PDZ binding domain present in cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and induction of IL2-independent growth required for T-cell transformation
[29,44,45] and may contribute to the phenotypic differences between these two viral groups. The consensus PDZ
domain has been defined as S/TXV-COOH, where the first
amino acid is serine or threonine, X is any amino acid, followed by valine and the carboxyl terminus. Tax4 does not
contain a PDZ domain (Fig. 10), suggesting that like

HTLV-2, HTLV-4 may possibly be less pathogenic than
HTLV-1.
Besides Tax and Rex, two additional ORFs encoding four
proteins, p27I, p12I, p30II, and p13II (where I and II
denote ORFI and ORFII, respectively), have been identified in the pX region of HTLV-1 and are important in viral
infectivity and replication, T-cell activation, and cellular
gene expression [26]. Analysis of the pX region of HTLV4(1863LE) revealed a total of five additional putative
ORFs (named I-V, respectively) encoding predicted proteins of 101, 161, 99, 133, and 115 aa in length (Fig 1a).
Since none of the potential ORFs begin with methionine
start codons, we determined potential splice junctions in
the HTLV-4 genome to ascertain the potential for novel
ORFs via complex splicing mechanisms. Prediction of
splice junction positions in HTLV-4 identified only two
donor sites with high confidence, one at nucleotide 414 in
the LTR (sd-LTR) and one at nucleotide 5105 in Env (sdEnv) (Fig. 1a). Three additional putative splice acceptor
sites were identified at nucleotides 7274 (sa-pX2) and
7645 (sa-pX3), and in Tax/Rex at nucleotide 7245 (sa-T/
R). The sa-T/R is used with the sd-Env to generate the Tax
and Rex proteins via complex splicing mechanisms (Fig.
1). Rex mRNA is predicted to be spliced using sd/sa sites
in a different reading frame than Tax and with a different
methionine start codon (nucleotide positions 5043 –

amino-terminus of the protein (Fig. 11). Interestingly, 19
of 26 (73%) amino acids in the HTLV-4 ORFIV (positions
4–29) were identical to similar ORFs from all other major
PTLVs, suggesting a conserved functionality of this motif
(Fig. 11). The predicted HTLV-4 ORFV protein shared only
weak similarity (41%) to the carboxyl-terminus of the
HTLV-2 p28XII protein (Fig. 11). In contrast to the HTLV4 ORFIV and ORFV proteins, the predicted HTLV-4 ORFI,
ORFII, and ORFIII proteins did not share significant
sequence identity with any PTLV accessory proteins, but
shared weak sequence similarity with only miscellaneous
microbial proteins available in GenBank such as Pseudomonas histidine kinase (37% similarity) (data not
shown). Analysis of alternatively spliced messenger RNA

expression in viable cells or tissue culture, and/or in vitro
characterization, will be required to investigate the expression and functionality of these putative accessory proteins.
A novel protein termed the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper
ZIP (bZIP) factor (HBZ) was recently found to be encoded
on the complementary strand of the viral RNA genome
between the env and tax/rex genes which was shown to
negatively regulate viral replication and to enhance viral
infectivity and persistence [28,46]. The recent finding of
HBZ mRNA as the sole viral gene product expressed in
ATL patients also suggests a role of HBZ mRNA in the survival of leukemic cells in vivo and in HTLV-1-associated
oncogenesis [47]. Although originally reported to be
exclusive to PTLV-1 [28], we previously reported that HBZ
is conserved among PTLV-1, -2, and -3 [31]. More
recently, others have demonstrated that an HTLV3(Pyl43) molecular clone expressed an antisense mRNA
[48]. Although these results confirm the predicted HBZ
gene region in this virus [34], additional studies are
required to evaluate the functionality of the HTLV-3 HBZ
protein. We now show by sequence analysis that an HBZ
homolog is also present in HTLV-4 emphasizing the
potential importance of this protein and mRNA in viral
replication, persistence, and leukemogenesis [28,46]. The
carboxyl terminus of the HBZ ORF contains a 21 aa
arginine rich region that is relatively conserved in PTLV
and known cellular bZIP transcription factors, followed
by a less conserved leucine zipper region that possesses
five or four highly conserved leucine heptads in HTLV-1
and all other PTLVs, respectively (Fig. 12). HTLV-1 has five
leucine heptads similar to that found in mammalian bZIP
proteins, while all other PTLVs, including PTLV-4, have
four leucine heptads followed by leucine octet (Fig. 12).
In PTLVs, the first residue in the initial leucine heptad is a
nonpolar amino acid other than leucine (Fig. 12). This
single amino acid substitution has not affected the functionality of the leucine zipper in HTLV-1 but requires further study of its affect in other PTLV HBZs [25,41]. As
reported previously, HTLV-2(MoT) is the only PTLV-2
strain that does not have the full complement of leucine
heptads a result of a single nucleotide deletion at position
6823 that causes a frameshift in the predicted HBZ
sequence [31].

Discussion
Here we report the first complete nucleotide sequence and
genomic characterization of the recently discovered
HTLV-4. We show that the genome of this novel human
virus is genetically equidistant from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and
HTLV-3. Robust phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis confirms that HTLV-4 clearly falls outside the diversity
of PTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3, demonstrating that
HTLV-4 is the only known member of a distinct PTLV
group we call PTLV-4. Combined, these results strongly

support the HTLV-4/PTLV-4 nomenclature proposed for
this virus [6]. The phylogenetic stability seen across HTLV4 and other PTLV genomes also demonstrates the absence
of major recombination events occurring in PTLV despite
evidence of dual infections in humans and primates
[9,49]. Furthermore, these results support the distinct evolutionary history of HTLV-4 and other PTLVs demonstrating that they are not recent genetic recombinants from
pre-existing viral genomes. This finding contrasts with
other retroviruses like HIV in which frequent recombination contributes substantially to genetic diversity [50].
Bayesian MCMC statistical methods have recently been
developed to accurately infer dates of evolutionary events,

to investigate the origin of viral epidemics, and to estimate
historical population dynamics [32,51]. Molecular dating
of the HTLV-4 predecessor using these robust methods
suggests that this novel PTLV lineage originated almost
200 millennia ago, which predates the inferred origin of
the ancestors of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3 by about
76,000 – 191,000 ya [31]. Two equally parsimonious
hypotheses on the origin of HTLV-4 can thus be proposed
by the inferred ancient existence of the PTLV-4 lineage.
First, it is possible that HTLV-4(1863LE) is a current
descendent of the ancestral PTLV-4 that infected humans
as they evolved in Africa and represents a strain circulating
within humans living in this geographic region. Interestingly, the inferred date of the HTLV-4 ancestor also coincides with the appearance of Homo sapiens sapiens,
estimated to have occurred around 200 – 400 K ya, suggesting the emergent human lineage may have been a suitable host for the ancestral PTLV-4. If this is not just an
evolutionary historical coincidence of both virus and
host, then HTLV-4 may indeed be the oldest human deltaretrovirus as inferred from the molecular dating of all
four HTLV groups. Alternatively, HTLV-4(1863LE) could
also be the result of a more recent zoonotic infection with
a very divergent STLV present in NHPs in the forests of
Cameroon. Additional information on the diversity of
HTLV-4 and its likely simian counterpart will be needed to
determine whether HTLV-4(1863LE) truly originated as
H. sapiens sapiens evolved, and persists in humans today,
or represents a more recent zoonotic transmission from
an NHP. As of yet, a simian counterpart of HTLV-4 has not
been identified in Cameroon or elsewhere despite the
identification of other novel STLVs in this region
[9,10,22]. Nonetheless, the inability to find "STLV-4" may
be due to sampling and screening biases in the selection
of NHP species and the geographic locations examined
[9,32].
The inference of an ancient split of HTLV-4(1863LE) from
the PTLV-2 lineage, combined with the wide geographic
distribution of STLVs and a history of STLVs crossing into
humans [2,8-10,18-21], all imply that HTLV-4 infection
may be more prevalent. Repeated and historical cross-species infections of humans with various STLV-1 strains led
to the emergence and dissemination of several HTLV-1
subtypes in West-Central Africa [2,4-6]. Similar evidence
suggests that the newly identified HTLV-3 infections also
potentially arose from multiple, independent past or contemporary introductions of different STLV-3 strains into
humans [6,8,31]. Given that both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2
followed human population migrations out of Africa and
across the globe as humans evolved, HTLV-4 and HTLV-3
may also have spread globally. A more precise determination of the origin and distribution of HTLV-4 infection
will require further studies, such as expanded surveillance
in both humans and NHPs. However, serosurveys for
HTLV-4 may be complicated by the inability to discrimiPage 12 of 20

nate this infection from HTLV-2 since they both show
similar WB profiles and the sensitivity of serological
assays for identifying HTLV-4 is currently unknown
[6,35]. Thus, additional diagnostic tools are required to
determine the level of HTLV-4 penetration into the general population and to search for the potential primate
origin of HTLV-4(1863LE). Screening for HTLV-4 will be
facilitated by the development and application of serologic and molecular assays based on the sequences
reported here. For example, since the HTLV-4 Gag matrix
and nucleocapsid and the envelope surface proteins are
divergent from PTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3 it may be possible to use them in serologic assays to differentiate the
four PTLV groups.
Virus classification is a topic of ongoing discussion and
suggestions for nomenclature are typically based on
lumping or splitting of taxa into distinct groups. Deltaretrovirus species are classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) by differences in
genome sequence and viral oncogenes, antigenic properties, natural host range, and pathogenicity. For example,
HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are distinguished mostly by phylogenetic diversity and variable disease outcomes of each
virus. Recently, a new deltaretrovirus species, STLV-5, was
proposed based on limited analyses of small tax/rex
sequences from a Macaca arctoides (strain MarB43) that
was originally classified as STLV-1 [4,10]. Herein, we
show by using robust phylogenetic analysis of major coding regions and complete viral genomes that expansion of
the current PTLV nomenclature from four to six putative
major taxonomic species or groups should be considered.
Our natural classification of PTLV groups is based on rig-

orous phylogenetic inference that demonstrates with high
confidence the formation of very distinctive monophyletic lineages outside the diversity of all known viral
groups, combined with genetic distances demonstrating
the putative new lineage is nearly equidistant from all previously characterized groups, and the placement of the
new PTLV groups near the root of the PTLV phylogeny.
The first four PTLV phylogroups consist of HTLV-1/STLV1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3/STLV-3, and HTLV-4. We confirm the
existence of the putative STLV-5(MarB43) lineage, while
the sixth group consists of the STLV-2(PanP) and STLV2(PP1664) viruses. However, for simplicity we suggest
maintaining the STLV-2 nomenclature historically used
for this particular viral group. Each proposed new viral
group clearly falls outside the diversity of their nearest
PTLV relatives (PTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively), is
monophyletic with strong bootstrap support and posterior probabilities, and are all roughly genetically equidistant from other PTLVs, and hence should all be classified
as distinct viral species. As with all viral nomenclature,
PTLV classification as proposed here will require approval
of ICTV.
In addition to understanding viral evolutionary history,
analysis of full-length genomes can also provide basic
information on the replication and pathogenic potential
of new viruses. Thus, we examined in detail the genetic
structure and sequence of HTLV-4 to determine if important functional motifs involved in viral expression and
HTLV-induced leukemogenesis are preserved [26-30,44].
All enzymatic, regulatory, and structural proteins are well
conserved in HTLV-4(1863LE), including conserved functional motifs in Tax that are important for viral gene
expression and T-cell proliferation, suggesting HTLV-4 is
replication competent. We also observed several important molecular features of the HTLV-4 genome involved in
viral expression and pathogenicity that are either similar
or distinct from other HTLVs. For example, the absence of
a PDZ domain in the Tax protein of HTLV-4(1863LE),
known to be important in cellular signal transduction and
T-cell transformation [29-31], is similar to what is seen in
HTLV-2 but not in HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 [27]. The absence
of PDZ suggests that the HTLV-4 Tax may be more phenotypically similar to the HTLV-2 than the HTLV-1 Tax. Furthermore, the high amino acid identity of the Tax4 and
Tax2 proteins also suggests that Tax4 may function similarly to Tax2 [27]. However, whether the absence of a PDZ
domain in HTLV-4 is associated with an absence of specific cellular and/or clinical outcomes like HTLV-2 will
require further investigation.
We also identified unique putative c-Myb and Pbx-1 transcription factor binding sites in the U3 region of the LTR
of HTLV-4(1863LE). c-Myb is a proto-oncogene that is
expressed in T cells induced by mitogen or antigenic stimulation and is involved in cell cycle progression and proPage 13 of 20

liferation of T lymphocytes, such that continuous
deregulation of cell cycling may play a role in leukemogenesis [52]. c-Myb has been shown to bind to the HTLV1 and feline leukemia virus LTRs to increase viral transcription [53,54]. Like c-Myb, dysregulation of the homeoprotein Pbx-1 can also increase leukemogenesis by
disturbing hematopoiesis [55]. We demonstrate here that
the potential c-Myb binding site in the HTLV-4 LTR specifically binds c-Myb, suggesting that it may also promote
LTR-mediated viral expression and which may help overcome the loss of the distal 21-bp repeat element observed
in the HTLV-4 LTR. For example, Pbx-1 has been demonstrated to up-regulate transcription of another retrovirus,
murine leukemia virus (MuLV), by binding to conserved
Pbx-1 transcription factor sites present in MuLV LTRs [56].
The presence of putative c-Myb and Pbx-1 binding sites in
the HTLV-4 LTR may provide novel mechanisms of transcriptional control at both the viral and cellular levels not
previously known for HTLV. Nevertheless, involvement of
the putative novel binding sites in viral transcription and
leukemogenesis will require additional studies.

Despite the absence of canonical bZIP domains, preliminary experiments show that proteins are transcribed from
the HTLV-3, and -4 antisense mRNAs and all were potent
inhibitors of Tax induction of HTLV LTR activity with similar cellular localizations like that of the HTLV-1 HBZ
(unpublished data). These results not only confirm the
predicted HBZ sequences and proteins in these viruses but
also demonstrate the potential importance of HBZ in
PTLV replication. The finding of a potential bZIP region
on the antisense strand of all PTLV genomes also indicates
that the nomenclature for this protein should be renamed
from HBZ to AEP for antisense encoding protein as suggested [48]. The potential role of AEP in HTLV-induced
oncogenesis may be less clear since HTLV-1 and HTLV-2
infection result in different clinical outcomes, while
pathologies for HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have not yet been
reported. Additional studies are required to confirm the
potential effect of the predicted AEP transcripts and proteins on HTLV-4 and PTLV expression and any role they
may have on leukemogenesis.

Conclusions
Although originally reported to be exclusive to HTLV-1
[28], we now provide additional evidence for a putative
HBZ region among all PTLVs, including HTLV-4(1863LE).

The novel HTLV-4 genome independently evolved from
an ancient deltaretrovirus lineage and contains many of
the functional motifs important for viral expression and

further characterize the unique molecular features of
HTLV-4 identified here, and to determine whether HTLV4 is endemic and pathogenic in humans to better understand the public health importance of this novel human
virus.

Methods
DNA preparation and PCR-based genome walking
DNA was prepared from uncultured PBMCs available
from person 1863LE identified in the original PTLV surveillance study in Cameroon reported in detail elsewhere
[6]. DNA integrity was confirmed by β-actin polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) as previously described [6]. All DNA
preparation and PCR assays were performed in a laboratory where only human specimens are processed and
tested according to recommended precautions to prevent
contamination. To obtain the full-length genomic
sequence of HTLV-4 we first PCR-amplified small regions
of each major coding region by using nested PCR and
degenerate PTLV primers (Fig. 1). The tax (730-bp),
polymerase (pol) (662-bp), and envelope (env) (319-bp)
sequences were amplified by using primers and condi-

tions provided elsewhere [6,31]. An additional short
HTLV-4 sequence, 440-bp in length, that overlaps the end
of tax and the beginning of the 3'LTR was amplified using
standard PCR conditions and 45°C annealing with the
external primers PGTAXF7a 5'TGATGGIWSICCIATGATTTCCGG 3', PGTAXF7b 5'TGATGGGTCT CCTATG ATTT

HTLV-4(1863LE)-specific primers were then designed
from sequences obtained in each of the four viral regions
described above and were used in nested, long-template
PCRs (Expand High Fidelity kit containing both Taq and
Tgo DNA polymerases (Roche)) to fill in the gaps in the

PCR products were purified with a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and sequenced in both directions with
a BigDye terminator cycle kit and automated sequencers
(Applied Biosystems). Selected PCR products were also
cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA
Cloning kit (Invitrogen) and recombinant plasmid DNA
was prepared using the Qiagen plasmid purification kit
prior to automated sequencing.
Sequence analysis
Percent nucleotide divergence was calculated using the
GAP program in the Genetic Computer Group's (GCG)
Wisconsin package [57]. Examination of functional

genetic motifs involved in viral expression, regulation,
and HTLV-induced oncogenesis was done by detailed
comparison of the HTLV-4 genome with full-length PTLV
sequences [26-29,31,44]. Identification of potential transcription factor binding sites in the HTLV-4 genome was
performed using the program TESS (Transcription Element Search System) [58]. Secondary structure of the LTR
RNA was determined using the program RNAstructure
v4.2 program [59]. Comparison of full-length PTLV
genomes available at GenBank and determination of
genetic recombination was done using HTLV-4(1863LE)
as the query sequence and the F84 (maximum likelihood)
model and a transition/transversion ratio of 2.28 implemented in the program SimPlot [60]. Prediction of splice
acceptor (sa) and splice donor (sd) sites was done using
an artificial neural network implemented in the
NetGene2 program [61] and with the Spliceview program
[62].
Nucleotide substitution saturation was evaluated using
pair-wise transition and transversion versus divergence
plots using the DAMBE program [63]. Unequal nucleotide
composition was measured by using the TREE-PUZZLE
program [64]. Phylogenetic trees were inferred with the
parameters estimated from the Clustal W [65] sequence
alignments of each gene and the full-length genome after
removing indels by using Modeltest v3.7 [66] and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods in the MEGA v4.0 [67] program

and maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis in PAUP* [68],
TREE-PUZZLE [64], and PhyML [69]. The reliability of the
inferred tree topology was tested with 100 (PAUP*) to
1000 bootstrap replicates (NJ and PhyML) or 100,000
puzzling steps (TREE-PUZZLE). Trees were viewed and
edited using FigTree v1.1.2 [70].
PTLV evolutionary rates and divergence times
In order to estimate a reliable divergence time for the
cenancestor (most recent common ancestor) of the HTLV4(1863LE) lineage, we generated separate alignments of
gag, pol, env, and tax genes from all full-length PTLV
genomes available at GenBank by using Clustal W.
Sequence gaps and 3rd codon positions were removed,
and minor adjustments in the alignment were made manually. The best fitting evolutionary model for the aligned
sequences was determined using a hierarchical likelihood
ratio test as described elsewhere [68]. A variant of the GTR
model, allowing four different substitution rate categories
(rA↔C = rA↔T = rG↔T = 1, rA↔G = 9.35, rC↔G = 0.67, rC↔T =
5.79), with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity (a =
0.694) and an estimated proportion of invariable sites
(0.185), was determined to best fit the data.

The molecular clock hypothesis, or constant rate of evolution, for the PTLV tree was tested with the likelihood ratio
test [71]. Likelihoods were calculated using the best fitting
nucleotide substitution model either with or without the
enforcement of the global clock constraint with the program PAML [72]. The PTLV evolutionary rate assuming
the global molecular clock model was estimated by using
the divergence time of 40,000 – 60,000 years ago (ya) for
the Melanesian HTLV-1 lineage (HTLV-1mel) and
12,000–30,000 ya for the most recent common ancestor
of HTLV-2a/HTLV-2b native American strains according
to the formula: evolutionary rate (r) = branch length (bl)/
divergence time (t) [23]. Such divergence dates were based
on well-established genetic and archaeological evidence
suggesting that ancestors of indigenous Melanesians and
Australians migrated from Southeast Asia or the introduction of ancestral indigenous Indians into North America
via the Bering Straight during those times [3,4,32]. The
evolutionary rate was also estimated by employing a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) molecular
clock method, allowing for either a strict or a relaxed
molecular clock [51], implemented in the BEAST software
package [73]. For each analysis, we used the calibration
dates discussed above as a strong prior for the time of the
most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the HTLV1Mel/HTLV-1a,b and HTLV-2a,b lineages, respectively. In
practice, the upper and lower divergence times estimated
from anthropological data were used to define the interval
of a strong uniform prior distribution from which the
MCMC sampler would sample possible divergence times
for the corresponding node in the tree. For each model,

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/9

the Bayesian calculation consisted of three independent
100,000,000 generations MCMC with sampling every
1,000th generation. Convergence of the MCMC was
assessed by calculating the effective sampling size (ESS) of
the runs using the program Tracer [74]. All parameter estimates showed significant ESSs (>150). The tree with the
maximum product of the posterior clade probabilities
(maximum clade credibility tree) was chosen from the
posterior distribution of 5,000 sampled trees (after burning in the first 5001 sampled trees) with the program TreeAnnotator version 1.4.6 included in the BEAST software
package [73]. Both the constant coalescent and Yule Process were used as tree priors and gave identical results.
DNA transfection
Approximately 1 million 293 cells were seeded on a 100
mm dish and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Cells were then
transfected with a c-Myb expression vector using Lipofectamine-PLUS (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 48 hours
using 1 × passive lysis buffer (Promega). Whole cell extract
was stored at -80°C.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe representing
the c-Myb binding site within the HTLV-4 LTR (sense, 5'TCGAGAAAGGTCAACTGTCTCACACAAAC-3';
antisense, 3'-TCGAGTTTGTGTGAGACAGTTGACCTTTC-5')
was end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme
(Invitrogen). The DNA-binding reaction was incubated
for 1 h at room temperature using 5 ng of labeled probe
and binding buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.9], 50 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% non-fat dry milk,
5% glycerol) supplemented with 2 ug of sheared salmon
sperm DNA, 1 ug poly-dI-dC (Sigma St. Louis, MO), and
5 ug 293 cell extract in a final volume of 15 ul. The supershift was performed by adding 1 ug of anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville,
VA) or non-specific PC10 monoclonal antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to the binding reaction for 1 h at room temperature. Unlabeled doublestranded
(sense,
5'-TCGAGAAAGGTCGTATGTCTCACACAAAC-3'; antisense, 3'-TCGAGTTTGTGTGAGAnon-specific oligonucleotide
CATACGACCTTTC-5')
contained mutations at three positions (underlined)
within the predicted c-Myb binding site. Specific and nonspecific competitors were added in a 100-fold excess over
labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on
a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Trisborate-EDTA at 150 V for 2.5 h.
