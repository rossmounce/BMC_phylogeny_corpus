Abstract
Background: The SICAvar gene family, expressed at the surface of infected erythrocytes, is critical for
antigenic variation in Plasmodium knowlesi. When this family was discovered, a prototypic SICAvar gene was
characterized and defined by a 10-exon structure. The predicted 205-kDa protein lacked a convincing
signal peptide, but included a series of variable cysteine-rich modules, a transmembrane domain encoded
by the penultimate exon, and a cytoplasmic domain encoded by the final highly conserved exon. The 205
SICAvar gene and its family with up to 108 possible family members, was identified prior to the sequencing
of the P. knowlesi genome. However, in the published P. knowlesi database this gene remains disjointed in
five fragments. This study addresses a number of structural and functional questions that are critical for
understanding SICAvar gene expression.
Methods: Database mining, bioinformatics, and traditional genomic and post-genomic experimental
methods including proteomic technologies are used here to confirm the genomic context and expressed
structure of the prototype 205 SICAvar gene.
Results
This study reveals that the 205 SICAvar gene reported previously to have a 10-exon expressed gene
structure has, in fact, 12 exons, with an unusually large and repeat-laden intron separating two newly
defined upstream exons and the bona fide 5'UTR from the remainder of the gene sequence. The initial exon
encodes a PEXEL motif, which may function to localize the SICA protein in the infected erythrocyte
membrane. This newly defined start of the 205 SICAvar sequence is positioned on chromosome 5, over
340 kb upstream from the rest of the telomerically positioned SICAvar gene sequence in the published
genome assembly. This study, however, verifies the continuity of these sequences, a 9.5 kb transcript, and
provides evidence that the 205 SICAvar gene is located centrally on chromosome 5.
Conclusion: The prototype 205 SICAvar gene has been redefined to have a 12-exon structure. These data
are important because they 1) address questions raised in the P. knowlesi genome database regarding
SICAvar gene fragments, numbers and structures, 2) show that this prototype gene encodes a PEXEL motif,
3) emphasize the need for further refinement of the P. knowlesi genome data, and 4) retrospectively,
provide evidence for recombination within centrally located SICAvar sequences.

Background
The phenomenon of antigenic variation in malaria parasites was first described in rhesus macaques infected with
Plasmodium knowlesi [1]. SICA (Schizont Infected Cell
Agglutination) variant antigens were identified in in vivoderived clonal parasite lines as large parasite-encoded proteins (between 180–220 kDa), and were confirmed to be
expressed at the surface of trophozoite and schizontinfected erythrocytes [2]. The 190 kDa and 210 kDa SICA
antigens expressed in the Pk1(A+) clone were switched in
vivo to the alternative expression of 200 kDa and 205 kDa
SICA antigens that define the resulting Pk1(B+)1+ clone,
as previously described [2]. In 1999, the P. knowlesi SICAvar gene family responsible for antigenic variation was
reported, and the first SICAvar gene, encoding the 205
kDa SICA antigen of clone Pk1(B+)1+ was characterized
as having a complex 10-exon structure [3]. This gene structure was surprising because it sharply contrasted with the
2-exon structure reported a few years earlier for Plasmodium falciparum var genes [4,5]. Nevertheless, despite the
high level of diversity expected of a large family responsible for antigenic variation, proteomic methods have
clearly demonstrated a direct relationship between the P.
knowlesi SICAvar and P. falciparum var gene families [6].
The 205 SICAvar gene, characterized prior to the advent of
the P. knowlesi sequencing project, was identified by
screening Pk1(B+)1+ gene expression libraries with specific antisera, followed by PCR, RT-PCR, 5'RACE and
3'RACE procedures to compile the reported 10-exon gene
structure [3]. These investigations also revealed a genomic
alteration at the 3' end of the 205 SICAvar gene compared
to the gene in parental Pk1(A+) cloned parasites [3]. Later
studies mapped this alteration in greater detail and made
the distinction that two alleles existed: the 205A SICAvar
allele in the Pk1(A+) cloned parasites and the 205B SICAvar allele in the Pk1(B+)1+ cloned parasites [7]. These two
SICAvar alleles showed apparent identity until the final
intron. The 205B SICAvar allelic phenotype in the
Pk1(B+)1+ parasites is the outcome of a recombination
event that occurs within the final intron of the 205A SICAvar gene in Pk1(A+) cloned parasites with the specific
placement at this junction of an alternative SICAvar
intron, cytoplasmic-domain-encoding final exon, and
3'UTR sequence [3,7]. The recently reported P. knowlesi
genome sequence [8] is based on gDNA of the Pk1(A+)
cloned parasite line and, therefore, should contain the
sequence of the 205A SICAvar allele and also provide
insights regarding the source of the SICAvar DNA
sequence that recombined with this gene to generate the
205B SICAvar allele.
Importantly, Corredor and colleagues [7], working with
contigs from an early genome assembly, further showed

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/181

that the highly conserved final SICAvar exon was present
in approximately 108 copies in the genome, and that
SICAvar genes had unusually conserved yet polymorphic
3' UTR sequences. The 3' UTR has expansive repeated
motifs with the GGTTTCACACC(T)n1GTCC(T)n2 (n1 = 4–
8; n2 = 21) consensus sequence that includes the
GGGTT(T/C)A Plasmodium telomeric repeat motif [9,10]
immediately after the stop codon, followed by A/T rich
homopolymeric segments that differ in size for each SICAvar gene family member, and then a small region with
more balanced GC content [7], reviewed in [11]. The discovery of the recombination event associated with the in
vivo switch in the variant type and the presence of these
unusual 3' UTR gene structures, suggested that the 3' end
and UTR characteristics of SICAvar genes may be relevant
with regards to the genetic or epigenetic mechanisms that
control expression and switching of this gene family [7],
reviewed in [11].
Several additional large and diverse gene families
involved or implicated in the production of variant antigens and proposed switching mechanisms have also been
discovered in Plasmodium [12-16]. Transcriptional control
and epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to be paramount in the determination of which P. falciparum var
gene is expressed [17], but the complete repertoire and
precise mechanisms that govern gene expression and
switching among var (or other) gene family members
remain elusive. To this end, it is critical to be able to relate
in vitro findings with what occurs in vivo, in the context of
the host environment, which is known to influence antigenic variation [11]. In this regard, it is particularly noteworthy that cloned P. knowlesi parasites passaged through
splenectomized rhesus monkeys cease to express SICA at
the surface of the infected red blood cell [18]. Moreover,
cloned SICA [-] parasites were shown to be less lethal than
SICA [+] clones in rhesus monkeys [18].
The P. knowlesi rhesus macaque system remains unchallenged as the best in vivo model for studies of antigenic
variation in Plasmodium. While this model provides direct
knowledge into SICAvar gene regulation and SICA expression, it can also provide insights regarding similarities and
differences in the molecular mechanisms governing var
gene expression [11]. Moreover, P. knowlesi has kir genes,
which are members of the large pir gene family identified
in species lacking "var" gene orthologs (e.g. P. vivax and
rodent malaria species) [8,19]. The roles this family may
play in antigenic variation or pathogenesis in primate and
rodent malaria infections remain uncertain. Importantly,
investigations of both SICAvar and kir gene expression can
be undertaken in vivo using P. knowlesi in rhesus monkeys
and not only through in vitro culture. Because studies of
gene expression, especially for such large complex gene

families, require precise knowledge relating to the genes'
UTRs, introns/exons and genomic context, it is especially
critical that the P. knowlesi genome sequencing data is
refined. Here multiple approaches to correct, confirm,
and redefine the prototypic 205 SICAvar gene in P. knowlesi bring emphasis to this point.

Methods
Data mining and bioinformatics
The GeneDB P. knowlesi database developed and hosted
by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and the BLAST
server at the Sanger Institute website, were used to locate
the published 205A SICAvar gene sequence [3,7] and
identify additional genomic sequence related to this gene
and other SICAvar gene family members. All primers
designed for this study were screened by BLAST searches
to ensure appropriate specificity (Table 1). A synteny map

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/181

including the P. vivax and P. falciparum genomes was generated using the PlasmoDB genome browser [20]. The
redefined SICAvar gene sequence with 12 exons was
manipulated in silico to remove the predicted intron
sequences, translate the coding sequence, and analyse the
newly predicted 205 kDa SICA protein. The redefined 205
SICAvar gene sequence has been submitted to NCBI, and
the original accession numbers AF078128 and AF078130
have been revised.
Plasmodium knowlesi parasite infections, RNA, gDNA,
and infected red blood cell membranes
Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ clonal parasites were propagated
in rhesus macaques as originally described [2]. Total RNA
from synchronous ring-stage parasites was extracted in
Trizol LS (Invitrogen), precipitated with 100% ethanol,
and purified with RNeasy mini columns. DNase I digest

was done on the column for 15 minutes. A260/A280
ratios of 2.0 are typical for RNA prepared by this method.
Additionally the quality of RNA samples used in these
studies was verified with an Agilent bioanalyzer 2100.
Genomic DNA stocks were prepared from mature schizonts and extracted with a midi QIAamp DNA blood kit
(Qiagen). Purified infected red blood cell membrane
preparations for LC-MS/MS were prepared as described
[21], using late trophozoites matured in culture from ringstage parasites obtained from rhesus macaques.
PCR, RT-PCR and DNA sequencing
Gene-specific primers (Table 1) were designed for the two
SICAvar exons contained in PkH_051981, and also to
amplify and confirm 1.45 and 1.76 kb of the genomic
sequence upstream and downstream, respectively, in both
Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ parasites. The continuity of the
mRNA transcript from PkH_051981 to PkH_000630 was
also confirmed with several RT-PCRs and subsequent
cloning and sequencing (Additional file 1). For reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments, cDNA was generated with the Thermoscript kit
(Invitrogen) by oligo dT-priming 1 ug ring-stage RNA
from Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ parasites at 57°C for 90
minutes. To test for gDNA contamination, reactions lacking the reverse transcriptase enzyme were included and
found to be negative. For PCRs, 5 ng of gDNA [Pk1(A+) or
Pk1(B+)1+] was used as a template and amplifications
were performed with Platinum Taq Supermix (Invitrogen)
for 35 cycles at the appropriate temperatures and extension times. RT-PCR and PCR products were either cloned
into the pCR2.1 TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) and
sequenced with vector primers (M13/T7), or direct
sequenced using gene-specific primers. The Big Dye Terminator kit v3.1 and an ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer were used to generate sequence data. Clone
alignments were generated with MacVector® 7.2.2 software.
Northern blots
Twenty micrograms of Pk1(B+)1+ ring-stage RNA were
electrophoresed on a 0.8% LE agarose gel (Ambion) in 1×
TBE and transferred to a Hybond-XL membrane (GE
Healthcare) overnight with 0.5N NaOH, then UV-fixed
with a Stratalinker 1800. A 770 bp RT-PCR gene-specific
product of PkH_051981 (from bp 27 of the first exon to
near the end of exon 2) was amplified with specific primers, with the reverse primer having a T7 promoter
sequence (Table 1). An antisense riboprobe generated
from in vitro transcribing the PCR product using the T7
Strip-EZ kit (Ambion) was hybridized overnight at 68°C
in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) followed by 2 low-stringency
washes (2× SSC/0.1% SDS) and 2 high-stringency washes
(0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS), each for 30 min at 55°C. Blots were

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/181

exposed overnight on MS Kodak film at -80°C with an
intensifying screen. An exon 11, 26 bp oligonucleotide
probe (Figure 2C), based on an antisense gene-specific
primer (Table 1), was radiolabeled with the Oligonucleotide 3' End Labeling System (Perkin Elmer), according to
the manufacturer's protocols. The oligonucleotide probe
was hybridized overnight at 42°C in ULTRAhyb-oligo
(Ambion), followed by 2 washes (2× SSC/0.5% SDS) at
42°C.
Southern blots
One ug aliquots of Pk1(A+)1+ gDNA were individually
digested overnight at 37°C with selected restriction
enzymes and electrophoresed in a 0.6% agarose gel overnight at 25 volts. The gel was depurinated in 0.25N HCl,
denatured in 1.5 M NaCl/0.5 M NaOH, and neutralized
with 1.5 M NaCl/1 M Tris/HCl (pH 7.45) before being
transferred overnight with 10× SSC onto Hybond-N+
membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were UV-fixed
(Stratagene Stratalinker 1800) and baked for two hours at
80°C in a vacuum oven.

A 504 bp gene-specific PkH_051981 PCR product from
position 482 to 985 (Table 1) was labelled with alpha 32P
dATP (PrimeIt kit, Stratagene) and annealed overnight at
65°C in hybridization buffer (0.25 M NaH2PO4/6× SSC/
10× Denardt's/56 mM Na4P2O7 *10H2O) containing 100
ug/ml salmon sperm DNA, followed by 3 low stringency
washes in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 30 min at 50°C and 3
high stringency washes in 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 30 min
at 55°C. The Southern blots were exposed overnight to
several days on MS Kodak film with an intensifying screen
at -80°C. After development, blots were stripped with
three treatments of boiling 0.1× SDS and re-exposed to
confirm the removal of probe. A subsequent hybridization was done with a 330 bp probe representing part of
the second exon found on the PkH_000630 contig (for
primers, see Table 1) in the same manner as described
above.
Proteolytic digests and liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
Proteins were analysed by mass spectrometry as previously described [6], with several modifications.
Pk1(B+)1+ trophozoite-infected erythrocyte membranes
were purified as described [21] and membrane proteins
extracted in Laemmli sample buffer and run on a 4–15%
SDS-PAGE gradient gel. All protein bands were excised
from SDS-PAGE gels and the gel pieces were destained
and dried. Dried gel bands were digested at 37°C overnight with 0.4 g of proteomics grade trypsin (Sigma). The
resulting peptides were then extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile (Sigma), desalted and
concentrated using ZipTip pipette tips containing C18

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:181

reversed-phase media (Millipore), and then washed in
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/50% acetonitrile (Sigma). Cleaned peptides were
analysed at the Emory Proteomics Core Service Center by
reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). During
database searches, a reverse database strategy was used to
evaluate false discovery rate; and the matched peptides
were filtered according to matching scores to remove all
false matches from the reverse database [22]. Only proteins that were matched by at least two peptides were
accepted to increase the confidence in the identification.

Results
Data mining reveals that a 'SICAvar fragment' annotated
as PkH_051981 in the Pk4 assembly >400 kb distal to the
telomere of chromosome 5 is related to the beginning of
the 205 SICAvar gene
Individual exon sequences from the prototype 10-exon
205 SICAvar gene [3,7] were used to BLAST the P. knowlesi
database at GeneDB (Version 4) to define the location in
the genome, and they were found to match a number of
'SICAvar fragments.' From the outset, this analysis indicated that the organization of the 205A SICAvar gene was
unresolved in the Pk4 assembly [8]. Five 205A SICAvar
gene fragments were identified, assigned to either the plus
or minus strands near the end of chromosome 5, or as
unmapped contigs not yet assigned to a chromosome
(Figure 1 and Table 2). Fragment PkH_051981 containing
two SICAvar exons was of special interest, given its long
distance from the telomeric fragments, 340 kb upstream;
exon 1 of this fragment also encodes a PEXEL-like motif
with the sequence EEWMK, which may function to transport the expressed SICA protein to the infected red blood
cell membrane [23-25].

Continued bioinformatic investigations led to the development of a redefined model for the 205 SICAvar gene
(Figures 2A and 2B), which is supported by data throughout this report. BLAST searches revealed that 528 bp of the
originally reported presumptive 5' UTR SICAvar sequence
[3,7] and the first 124 bp of the SICAvar exon 1 as
described in 1999 match the second exon in the
PkH_051981 fragment. A typical splice donor sequence
(GTAA) marks the end of this second exon, supporting
our conclusion that an intron exists within the sequence
of the originally reported exon 1. The remaining 158 bp of
the original exon 1 (bp 125–282) match part of an open
reading frame (ORF) upstream of the 'two exon-containing SICA var fragment' encoded in the unmapped
PkH_000630 contig (see Table 2). This contig includes the
originally defined exons 2 and 3 and introns 1 to 3 of the
205 SICAvar gene. The splice acceptor preceding the 158
bp exon positioned at the 5'end of PkH_000630 includes

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/181

a typical long polypyrimidine tract (TTCTTTCATCT(24)ACAG). BLAST searches involving sequence
downstream of the second exon of PkH_051981 identified other genomic contigs that supplied an additional
406 bp of intron sequence. Combined with the 162 bp of
available sequence 5' to the 158 bp SICAvar exon in
PkH_000630, this intron has 2959 bp of known sequence
(Additional file 1). Since there is no overlap between the
available genome sequence 3' to PkH_051981 and 5' to
PkH_000630, the actual size of the intron positioned
between the redefined SICAvar exons 2 and 3 (Figures 2A
and 2B) was uncertain. However, this intron has been estimated to be at least 12 kb by PCR and Southern blot
experiments (see below, Figure 3B). Primers specific to
exon 2 of PkH_051981 and corresponding to the ends of
the predicted exons 2 and 3 (Figure 2B) of fragment
PkH_000630 were tested in PCRs using gDNA from
Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ parasites. In each case a product
over 12 kb was evident but too weak to scan and observe
visually. However, this product resisted all attempts at
cloning, or direct sequencing, which can be explained due
to the presence of extensive repeated motifs in this and
comparable regions of other SICAvar genes. Lengthy
repeated motifs, with one example of 405 bp repeated 2.5
times (Additional file 2), were noted, and the full extent
of these repeated sequences remains unknown [26].
Interestingly, BLAST searches of the P. falciparum and P.
vivax genome databases resulted in alignments showing
that the PkH_051981 fragment is within a syntenic block
(Figure 2C), which corresponds to a relatively central
chromosomal location on chromosome 4 in P. falciparum (MAL4) and contig CM000446 from P. vivax
[16,26].
The continuity of SICAvar exons in fragments
PkH_051981 and PkH_000630 is confirmed by RT-PCR
and sequencing
The bioinformatic analyses discussed above suggested
that PkH_051981 contains previously unrecognized
upstream sequence of the 205 SICAvar gene, and RT-PCRs
were conducted to evaluate this possibility. Using oligo
dT-primed cDNA from both Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+
ring-stage total RNA, clones were generated and
sequenced to confirm the splice sites and predicted mRNA
sequence generated from the PkH_051981 sequence
(Additional file 1). Most clones reflected spliced intron
sequences between the predicted exons 1 and 2 within
PkH_051981, but two clones possessed the intron
sequence as well. The RT-minus samples were negative, so
these two clones could represent pre-mRNA. Multiple RTPCRs were done to amplify the cDNA sequence from
PkH_051981 and PkH_000630. These products were
cloned and sequenced and confirm the continuity of the
mRNA transcript (Additional file 1).

Genomic context of PkH_051981 and originally defined 205 SICAvar gene fragments on chromosome 5 in the
Pk4 assembly. The schematic represents P. knowlesi chromosome 5 from bp position 840,000 to the end, from Pk4 chromosome maps available from GeneDB. PkH_051981 is centrally located, 340 kb upstream from the other 205 SICAvar gene fragments positioned at the end of chromosome 5. The telomeric fragments are not found in the correct order, as originally
described [3], and they are positioned in this assembly on different DNA strands and orientations. Exons 3–5 are not indicated
here, as they are on the unmapped contig PkH_000630. Exons 6–7, 8–9, and 10–12 are on contigs PkH_052810, PkH_052840
and PkH_052830 respectively.

PkH_051981 and downstream 205 SICAvar sequences
hybridize to a 9.5 kb transcript on northern blots
To confirm whether the exons within PkH_051981 are in
fact part of the 205 SICAvar transcript, a gene-specific
PkH_051981 antisense riboprobe and an oligonucleotide
probe representing the redefined exon 11 sequence (Figure 2A) were tested in northern blot experiments using
Pk1(B+)1+ ring-stage RNA. Each probe hybridized to a
predominant transcript of about 9.5 kb (Figure 2D).
Importantly, the PkH_051981 and the redefined exon 11
(original exon 9, GSP3/GSP7oligonucleotide) sequences
hybridize as single-copy sequences on Southern blots, as
show in Figure 3B and [3], respectively.
Southern blot analysis confirms genomic continuity of the
redefined 205 SICAvar gene and indicates that a ~12 kb
intron exists between exons 2 and 3
Having developed corroborating evidence through RTPCR and northern blot experiments that PkH_051981
and the originally reported 205 SICAvar transcripts are
expressed together as one transcript, it was critical to evaluate whether these sequences were contiguous in the
genome or separated by 340 kb in the P. knowlesi genome
database as shown in Figure 1A. As noted above, primers
corresponding to the redefined exons 2 and 3 (Figures 2A
and 2B) were tested in PCRs and a large band of over 12
kb could be visualized on a gel, supporting the possibility
of the genomic continuity of these sequences. To examine
this further, a hypothetical restriction map was produced
with the presumption that these sequences were contigu-

Coordinates on Chromosome 5 Strand Orientation

ous, and also noting the location of two sequence gaps
(Figure 3A). This map includes the total available
sequence of the 205A SICAvar allele plus genomic
sequence 20 kb upstream of PkH_051981 to the gap
downstream of PkH_052830, a span of 34.9 kb. Genomic
DNA from Pk1(A+) parasites was digested with a panel of
enzymes determined from the predicted restriction map
and Southern blots were carried out. A representative
Southern blot using five diagnostic enzymes (Table 3; Figure 3B) confirms the general accuracy of the restriction
map. The Southern blot was probed first with a gene-specific PCR product representing PkH_051981 (shown) followed by a probe representing exon 4. Common
hybridization signals were visible in the HindIII and NciI
digests supporting the premise that PkH_051981 is in fact
contiguous with the rest of the known 205 SICAvar gene
sequence. Thus, it can be concluded that the originally
described 10 exons of the 205 SICAvar gene are located
downstream of the PkH_051981 two-exon containing
sequence, rather than at the end of chromosome 5, as
shown in Figure 1. The specific sizes of the HindIII, HpaI
and NciI hybridization bands, larger than those predicted
in the restriction map based on the absence of sequence
gaps (Figure 3A), corroborate the estimated 12 kb size of
the intron between exon 2 and 3, as well as the 3 kb intron
noted earlier between exons 5 and 6 (Figure 2A) [3].
Despite repeated and persistent efforts in this laboratory,
both of these introns were unable to be cloned and
sequenced; they also mark the location of sequence gaps
in the genome database [8].

Redefining the structure of the 205 SICAvar gene. A. Schematic representing the genomic organization of the exons and
introns of the original (10 exon) and redefined (12 exon) 205 SICAvar gene. Blue boxes denote exons, black lines denote
introns, and dotted lines represent the estimated sizes of uncharacterized 12 kb and 3 kb introns, drawn roughly to scale. B.
Schematic representing the discovery of the PkH_051981 two-exon gene fragment and its relationship with the 205 SICAvar
gene. The color-coded bars are drawn to depict the relationship of the newly defined start of the 205 SICAvar gene with its
originally defined 5'UTR and exons 1 through 3. The originally defined 5'UTR and exon 1 sequence are identical to sequence in
the PkH_051981 fragment. Part of the originally defined exon 1 was also found to be identical to sequence from the unmapped
contig PkH_000630, revealing that the original exon 1 actually contains an internal intron. Previously, this sequence was only
available from cDNA generated via 5'RACE experiments and this intron went undetected. See Additional file 1: Alignment of
PkH_051981, genomic sequence surrounding PkH_051981, PkH_000630, and sequenced clones. C. Synteny map of the region
surrounding PkH_051981 showing many orthologous genes in P. knowlesi, P. vivax and P. falciparum. PkH_051981 is near the end
of a contiguous syntenic block that extends upstream for 70,449 bp. D. Northern blot data supports the premise that the
PkH_051981 sequences are part of the 205 SICAvar transcript. Individual lanes of P. knowlesi [Pk1(B+)1+] ring-stage total RNA
were hybridized with a PkH_051981 antisense riboprobe and an oligonucleotide probe representing exon 11. The 205 SICAvar
transcript signal (9.5 kb) is attained with each probe. The standard sizes noted are based on the Millennium RNA markers from
Invitrogen.

LC-MS/MS identifies the 205 kDa SICA protein in the
membrane ghosts of Pk1(B+)1+ infected erythrocytes, with
peptide hits to the redefined N-terminus and other
previously described regions of this protein
LC-MS/MS was used to confirm that the 205 kDa protein
was detected in Pk1(B+)1+ trophozoites, known to
express this protein [2,3], and specifically in the infected
red blood cell membrane by subjecting the purified
infected membrane proteins to LC-MS/MS analysis. In the
Pk1(B+)1+ clone, peptides mapping to PkH_051981,
PkH_052810, and PkH_052840 were detected from the
same pooled protein bands excised from around the 180
kDa to 230 kDa area of an SDS-PAGE gel. PkH_051981
and PkH_052810 were each identified by three unique
peptides, which confirms their presence (Additional file
3). In contrast, PkH_052840 was identified by two nonunique peptides suggestive of a shared sequence with
other SICA proteins. BLAST analyses of the encoded protein sequences of these fragments identify each of them
strictly to the 205 SICAvar gene with 100% identity.

The redefined 205 SICAvar gene structure (Figure 2A) was
also assessed with regards to its cysteine-rich domains
(CRDs). The 205 SICA protein was originally reported to
have seven CRDs [3]. The second exon of PkH_051981
encodes six additional cysteine residues, which expands
the length of the initial CRD described previously [3]. The
redefined 205 SICA protein is comprised of 2,038 amino
acids from a deduced ORF of 6,114 bp and has a calculated mass of 227 kDa. An adenosine residue at the -3
position precedes the putative start methionine, which is
typical for Plasmodium start sites.
Identification of PkH_000660 as the source of the 205B
SICAvar allele-specific 3' sequences
The availability of the P. knowlesi genome sequence, based
on sequencing Pk1(A+) gDNA, provides the exciting
opportunity to know the original source of the DNA
sequences that recombined with the silent 205A SICAvar
allele, in vivo, to create the expressed 205B SICAvar allele
[3,7,11]. To determine the origin of this DNA, BLAST
searches were performed with the 205B SICAvar allelespecific sequences. The unmapped contig PkH_000660
matched these sequences with 100% identity. Because this
sequence is not mapped in the Pk4 assembly [8], its
genomic context remains unknown. However, the fact
that this sequence has been reported as unmapped raises
the possibility that it may be flanked by typically observed
frequent low complexity stretches of A and T nucleotides
and/or repeated motifs, which, as also noted above, can
be especially challenging to sequence in Plasmodium.

Discussion
In this report, through data mining, bioinformatics and
experimental confirmation, the gene structure of the pro-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/181

totype 205 SICAvar gene has been redefined. The data presented confirms that this gene is comprised of 12 exons in
toto, instead of 10 as originally reported [3]. The presumptive UTR originally reported for the 205 SICAvar gene had
been in question from the perspective that this sequence
hybridized to gDNA digests as a single-copy sequence [7];
BLAST searches also supported this result, indicating that
this region contained specific unique sequence. These
data contrasted with the nature of 5' UTRs from the P. falciparum var genes, since several defined classes of related
var gene 5' UTRs have been recognized [27,28]. A typical
signal sequence was also not clearly recognized in the primary deduced protein sequence reported for the 205 kDa
SICA protein [3]; a finding that is consistent with original
reports for var genes [4,5]. However, PEXEL motifs have
since been reported in the erythrocyte membrane proteins
(EMP1) encoded by the var gene family, with apparent
functions related to the transport of these proteins to the
infected red blood cell membrane [23-25].
Importantly, the redefined 5'UTR of the 205 SICAvar gene
is in fact a multi-copy sequence that can be classified in
one of a few defined groups with regard to potential promoter sequences (unpublished data) and the redefined Nterminal region has a PEXEL-like motif [8] that may supply the required signal sequence for protein translocation
of the encoded SICA protein to the membrane of the
infected host erythrocyte.
BLAST searches reported here led to the generation of
cDNA containing SICAvar sequence from PkH_051981
and the upstream part of the originally reported 205 SICAvar gene. Because the published P. knowlesi assembly
(Pk4) [8] maps the 5'UTR-containing PkH_051981 fragment on chromosome 5, over 340 kb from the rest of the
205 SICAvar exons near the end of this chromosome, two
possibilities were considered to account for the observed
linkage of these exon sequences in cDNAs: 1) that a transsplicing or co-transcriptional mechanism functioned to
unite transcripts produced at the central and distal locations, or 2) that the remaining 205 SICAvar fragments
actually occur immediately downstream of PkH_051981.
Together, the DNA and RT-PCR-based data presented here
show unequivocally that the centrally located 5'UTR and
two-exon-containing PkH_051981 fragment is in fact
contiguous with the 10-exon 205 SICAvar gene sequence.
Therefore, the originally reported 205 SICAvar sequence
should be repositioned downstream from the
PkH_051981 sequence in the P. knowlesi genome database, and the complete 12-exon gene should be annotated
as the 205 SICAvar gene (and, specifically, the 205A SICAvar allele). The 205 SICAvar alleles were originally
reported on chromosome 4 based on pulse field gel electrophoresis experiments [7], but the P. knowlesi genome
project has verified this to be chromosome 5 [8].

Southern blot data supports the continuity of PkH_051981 and distal exons of the 205 SICAvar gene, and the

The predicted sizes of the various restriction fragments are noted by colour-coded bars, without the size of sequence gaps
taken into consideration. The position of the two probes used consecutively in the Southern blot shown below in Figure 3B,
are labelled. The presence of two gaps, referring to unresolved sequence in the genome database, are indicated downstream of
the position of each probe. B. Southern blot. P. knowlesi [Pk1(A+)] gDNA restriction enzyme digests were hybridized consecutively with probes representing the second exon of PkH_051981 (shown) and exon 4 (not shown). Arrows point to fragments
that were visualized with both probes, as would be expected, in support of the continuity of these sequences in the genome.
The enzymes used were BanII (B2), EcoRV (E5), HindIII (H3), HpaI (Hp1), and NciI (N1). The expected sizes of HindIII, HpaI, and
NciI are exceeded by about 13, 9, and 8.5 kb, respectively (Figure 3A and Table 3), supporting the presence of a large intron of
close to 12 kb.

* The gDNA sequence downstream of the 205 SICAvar gene has not
been resolved, thus the location of the next EcoRV site is unknown.

Northern blot experiments also support the continuity of
these sequences, as gene-specific probes representing
PkH_051981 and exon 4 both hybridize to the expected
9.5 kb 205 SICAvar transcript. This report also confirms
the size of this 205 SICAvar transcript, which was previously judged using GTG agarose and formaldehyde gels to
be closer to 7.0 kb [3]. Repeated experiments using various probes, updated RNA markers, and LE agarose gels
without formaldehyde, show that this transcript is consistently about 9.5 kb.
These data have several important implications. First, our
analyses strongly support the view that many of the >200
SICAvar gene fragments reported in the P. knowlesi
genome [8] are, in fact, unassembled segments of bona fide
SICAvar genes. This is a very different scenario from the
alternative view that the genome contains numerous fragments of SICAvar genes. Knowing the correct gene family
structure is requisite for determining potential gene
expression mechanisms. SICAvar fragments could reflect
pseudogenes or remnants of recombination events, or be
modules used by the parasite to help generate diversity, or
function in some way to activate or silence specific members of this gene family. If most fragments are actually
parts of bona fide SICAvar genes, the evolutionary and
gene expression considerations would differ. The general
organizational picture of the SICAvar variant antigen
genes could prove to be comparable to the var genes in P.
falciparum, with genes both centrally and telomerically
positioned in the genome [27]. The estimate of up to 108
SICAvar gene family members [7] provides an upper limit
in the P. knowlesi genome, while the 29 SICAvar genes

annotated as full-length in the genome database [8] may
reflect only a glimpse into this family and its genomic
organization.
It is also worth recognizing that 45 of the 206 fragments
(22%) annotated in the Pk4 assembly as SICAvars have
structures similar to PkH_051981: a short PEXEL-encoding exon and a second exon, which together are termed
here as 'PEXEL-containing modules.' If like PkH_051981,
other such modules are followed downstream by a very
large repeat-laden intron, this would help explain why
they, by and large, remain disjointed as annotated fragments followed by gaps in the current genome assembly.
In support of this proposition, like PkH_051981, the
majority of PEXEL-containing modules (41/45 or 91%)
have gaps indicated downstream. Eight of these have
more than 2 kb of non-coding sequence reported
(between 2.2–6.6 kb) before the start of the gap. These
modules, predictably, could be linked to downstream
ORFs by unusually large introns. Consistent with this
notion, six of the 29 SICAvar genes reported in the P.
knowlesi
genome
(PkH_072380,
PkH_091300,
PkH_100210,
PkH_110360,
PkH_111220,
and
PkH_132190) have one or more introns between 7.4 kb
to 13.6 kb, and all but one of these is found between
exons 2 and 3, suggesting that large introns at this position may be a common characteristic of at least a subset of
SICAvar genes.
As anticipated, when the chromosomal region containing
the PkH_051981 fragment was compared with P. vivax
and P. falciparum genome sequences [16,27], synteny was
observed for many upstream and downstream genes, giving confidence in the general assembly of the P. knowlesi
chromosome. P. vivax is phylogenetically closely related
to P. knowlesi, but lacks orthologues of the SICAvar (or P.
falciparum var) gene family [16], and so the absence in P.
vivax of sequence related to PkH_051981 would be
expected.
The newly defined central position of the 205 SICAvar
gene has implications with regards to the nature of the
recombination event that occurred within the 205A SICAvar allele in Pk1(A+) parasites to create the 205B SICAvar
allele in Pk1(B+)1+ parasites. These alleles are distinguished by a recombinant event that occurred within the
penultimate intron, resulting in the replacement of an
alternative SICAvar downstream intron sequence, final
exon, and 3'UTR [7]. The current data indicates that this
genomic alteration is not simply the result of the
increased tendency for recombination of telomeric
sequences [29], but the outcome of a recombination event
involving centrally located SICAvar sequences. Of note, it
is also reported here that the alternative SICAvar sequence
that recombined in the Pk1(A+) parasites to create the
205B allele in the Pk1(B+)1+ parasites is contained on

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:181

contig PkH_000660, which in the published Pk4 assembly has not been assigned to a chromosome. Since the P.
knowlesi genome project was based on sequencing
Pk1(A+) gDNA, if the genomic context of this contig were
known, it could prove to be especially insightful with
regards to the specific genetic mechanism responsible for
this recombination event and the associated switch in
expression to the 205 kDa SICA protein.
The genomic analysis, sequencing and annotation of
members of the large SICAvar multigene gene family
come with many challenges. Granted, there are as many as
108 SICAvar genes, and they have a large complex multiexon gene structure. However, like the P. falciparum var
genes, the SICAvar genes have many regions that are
highly polymorphic as well as regions showing extensive
sequence conservation. The introns and UTRs are especially challenging to study due to their lengthy stretches of
low complexity sequence comprised of A and T nucleotides or repeated motifs, which can extend for hundreds
or even several thousand base pairs. These regions, as
exemplified here by the large intron between SICAvar
exons 2 and 3, can prohibit the thorough and accurate
sequencing and assembly of genomic contigs. Therefore, it
is not surprising that the P. knowlesi database has many
gaps associated with these and other difficult regions. The
original and continued refinement of the prototype SICAvar gene, despite these caveats, provides some optimism
that a refined SICAvar gene family dataset is within reach.
Further rigorous work is needed at the bench, and smallerscale, focused sequencing projects directed at specific
problem regions could be envisioned. The accuracy of the
SICAvar gene sequences and genome organization is critical for generating hypothesis-driven studies on the genetic
and epigenetic mechanism related to SICAvar gene expression and switching of SICA antigens. A more polished
genome, ideally reaching closure, is also important for
gene expression studies relating to other gene families; for
example, those encoding other proteins associated with
the infected RBC membrane, such as the KIRS or PHISTS
[8,13,16,30] or merozoite proteins like the P. knowlesi
normocyte binding proteins [31].

Conclusion
The data reported here, with the redefined 205 SICAvar
gene and encoded protein, is key to the further advancement in our understanding of SICAvar gene and protein
expression. Studies can now be envisioned to investigate
the stage-specific expression and trafficking of this SICA
protein (and others) to its position in the red blood cell
membrane. An in-depth analysis of promoter regions is
also now feasible.

The recent availability of a P. knowlesi genome sequence
database is a much-welcomed tool, which has proved to
be invaluable towards understanding the organization
and evolution of SICAvar genes in this species. The Sanger
Centre can only be commended for the work completed
to this point. However, the discrepancy of the available in
silico data and our experimental confirmation argues for
the need of a more advanced genome assembly. While
much can and will be done on a small scale in the context
of specific research projects, further focused genome-wide
sequencing efforts could resolve a majority of the current
gaps more quickly. Complete and accurate sequence
information is essential for drawing conclusions with
regards to genetic or epigenetic mechanisms relating to
variant antigen switch events. This is important in light of
the fact that P. knowlesi is an exceptional in vivo and in vitro
model for investigations of antigenic variation in malaria,
and given the specific relationship of the SICAvar gene
family and the P. falciparum var gene family [6,11], this
system should be capitalized. Moreover, P. knowlesi has
been increasingly recognized as the cause of zoonotic
infections, illness and death in humans [32,33].
