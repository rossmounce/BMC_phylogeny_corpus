Abstract
Background: Bacteria of the genus Bartonella are responsible for a large variety of human and
animal diseases. Serological typing of Bartonella is a method that can be used for differentiation and
identification of Bartonella subspecies.
Results: We have developed a novel multiple antigenic microarray to serotype Bartonella strains
and to select poly and monoclonal antibodies. It was validated using mouse polyclonal antibodies
against 29 Bartonella strains. We then tested the microarray for serotyping of Bartonella strains and
defining the profile of monoclonal antibodies.
Bartonella strains gave a strong positive signal and all were correctly identified. Screening of
monoclonal antibodies towards the Gro EL protein of B. clarridgeiae identified 3 groups of
antibodies, which were observed with variable affinities against Bartonella strains.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that microarray of spotted bacteria can be a practical tool for
serotyping of unidentified strains or species (and also for affinity determination) by polyclonal and
monoclonal antibodies. This could be used in research and for identification of bacterial strains.

Background
Within the last 15 years, several bacteria of the genus Bartonella were recognized as zoonotic agents in humans and
isolated from various mammalian reservoirs. Pets represent a large reservoir for human infection, including
exotic pets, because most Bartonella spp. infecting them are
zoonotic. Cats are the main reservoir for Bartonella henselae, B. clarridgeiae, and B. koehlerae. Dogs can be infected
with B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae,
B. washoensis, B. elizabethae, and B. quintana [1,2]. Members of the genus Bartonella have historically been connected with human diseases, such as cat-scratch disease,
trench fever, and Carrion's disease, and recently, have also
been recognized as emerging pathogens causing other
clinical manifestations in humans [3]. It has been shown

that Bartonella spp. alone may cause 3% of all cases of
infectious endocarditis. Endocarditis is a life-threatening
disease, for which a favourable rapid etiological diagnosis
must be made as early as possible [4]. Trench fever, a
louse-borne disease caused by Bartonella quintana, was
reportedly reemerging recently in homeless persons [5,6].
Identification of the many species is based either on isolation of the bacterium or PCR testing; nine Bartonella species or subspecies have been recognized as zoonotic
agents, including B. henselae, B. elizabethae, B. grahamii, B.
vinsonii subsp. arupensis, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. grahamii, B. washoensis and more recently B. koehlerae and B.
alsatica [7,8]. Serotyping provides valuable information
on the incidence of some bacterial serotypes, such as Salmonella, Pneumococcus, and Haemophilus, for which typing

can be performed by the slide agglutination method, multiplexed latex beads or PCR [9-12]. Various microarray
methods have been described for DNA, RNA and protein
analysis than can be applied in the diagnosis of infectious
diseases [13]. These microarray systems allow several tests
to be performed simultaneously without separating the
original sample [14]. In recent years, monoclonal antibodies have become common tools, which can be used
for serological assays to detect drugs, hormones and
serum proteins; for diagnosis of viral and bacterial diseases; for tumour identification; and for purification of
antibodies, proteins and cells [15-18]. Our goal was to
develop a multiple antigenic microarray able to detect and
identify by serology each of the Bartonella strains.
To test the bacterial microarray, we studied a collection of
polyclonal antibodies directed against the Bartonella
strains. We initially produced mouse polyclonal sera
against twenty-nine Bartonella strains and determined
optimal dilutions using an array using Bartonella.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/59

Furthermore, to confirm the usefulness of our system for
serotyping, we produced a new array containing four Bartonella strains responsible for major human diseases,
using some bacterial strains as blind test controls and Bartonella strains isolated by blood culturing from homeless
people during a visit of shelters in Marseilles.
Finally, we used our protein microarray for screening
monoclonal antibodies generated against the gro EL protein of B. clarridgeiae.

Results
Production of polyclonal sera
We obtained a polyclonal serum against each strain used
in the present study. All sera exhibited titers ranging from
1: 3,200 to 1: 12,800 against their respective immune
strain (Table 2). Therefore, we decided to test two dilutions for each polyclonal serum: 1:100 and 1:1,000 and in
case of a strong cross-reaction, 1: 1,000 and 1:5,000 on
slides with spotted array.

Immunofluorescence assay on 29 Bartonella strains array
For all analysis, spots corresponding to S. aureus protein A
and mouse IgG exhibited a strong value, indicating a good
distribution of mouse serum sample and FITC conjugated
antibodies. Spots of BSA and IgG goat AMCA showed very
low values, demonstrating a slight background noise level
of the assay. Initially, five sera from unimmunised mice
were tested and we obtained mean values less than 432,
362 and 97 AUV, respectively, corresponding to the 1:100,
1:1,000 and 1:5,000 dilution assays (data not shown). We
obtained a polyclonal sera specific for each of the strains
in this study, however, the level of cross reactivity with
other species varied greatly. Antibodies to B. alsatica and
B. birtlesii showed strong and clear signals with very low
levels of cross reactivity. B. henselae Marseille and B. henselae Houston generated polyclonal antibodies with a distinct microarray profile. For B. henselae Marseille, B.
taylori, B. birtlesii, B. bacilliformis, B. alsatica, B. quintana
Oklahoma, B. henselae Houston, B. tribocorum, B. koehlerae, B. schoenbuchensis, B. doshiae, B. vinsoni arupensis, B.
clarridgeiae, B. bovis, Bartonella strains isolated from Macropus giganteus and from Uromys caudimaculatus polyclonal
sera, we obtained a strong signal directed against the

strain that was used for immunisation at the 1: 100 and 1:
1,000 dilutions. The values ranged from 4,600 AUV for B.
henselae Marseille to 47,000 AUV for B. tribocorum at the 1:
100 dilution. In the case of the 1: 1,000 dilution assay,
values ranged from 3,200 AUV for B. henselae Marseille to
27,000 AUV for B. taylori (data not shown). Among these
polyclonal sera, some exhibited a low level of cross reactivity (Fig 3). For twelve other polyclonal sera, the 1:
1,1000 and 1: 5,000 dilutions were investigated due to the
absence of a clear and strong specific signal and excessive
cross-reaction at the 1: 100 dilution. The recorded values
ranged from 2,500 to 14,000 AUV and from 500 to 9,000
AUV at two dilutions 1: 1,000 and 1: 5,000 for B. phoceensis and for the strain isolated from Isoodon macrouris,
respectively. We concluded from this experiment that polyclonal sera against B. quintana Oklahoma, B. henselae
Houston, B. henselae Marseille and B. clarridgeiae at the 1:
1,000 dilution can be used to perform serotyping.

blood culture medium on Columbia agar. Signals on the
array were negative or very slight against the five blind test
strains, but very strong against reference strains with the
corresponding polyclonal serum. All the bacterial strains
isolated by blood culturing from homeless persons gave a
strong positive signal using polyclonal sera at the dilution
indicated above. However, these signals were weaker than
that of the B. quintana strain and we obtained comparable
results with a B. quintana monoclonal antibody produce
(Fig 4).
Production of monoclonal antibodies
In this study, we obtained a total of 712 hybridomas, of
which 17 gave a positive signal on the indirect immunofluorescence assay. The investigated microarrays exhibited a negative signal against B. birtlesii for all the tested
monoclonal antibodies. Nine monoclonal antibodies
strongly reacted with all the other strains, whereas three
monoclonal antibodies did not react against one of the
strains, B. bacilliformis. Five monoclonal antibodies demonstrated a major affinity toward B. clarridgeiae but did
not react against the other strains, especially B. bacilli-

formis, B. henselae Houston, B. henselae Marseille and B.
quintana (Fig 5).
The monoclonal antibody P8G6 (Fig 1B) showed the best
values to detect all Bartonella, except B. birtlesii. Detection
values ranging from 0 to 527 AUV showed a low background noise for the four negative controls, whereas the
detection values ranging from 2351 to 37133 AUV
showed good detection for 28 strains. The nine monoclonal antibodies reacted differently the same strain, and
there was no correlation between the values and the phylogeny of bartonella species based on groEL sequences
(data not shown) [19].

Discussion
The tools of choice for strain identification of Bartonella
spp. are molecular tests, ever since the advent of multilocus sequence typing [20]. In fact, it is difficult to determine the Bartonella species that cause disease using
polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies for classical
immunofluorescence, because of extensive cross-reactivity

ogy for all strains simultaneously permit us to decrease
cross reactivity and allows us to detect and identify each
strain using polyclonal antibodies. Our method has also
permitted the detection of new strains, such as Bartonella
strains isolated from Macropus giganteus and from Uromys
caudimaculatus using polyclonal antibodies. Our immunofluorescence-array assay exhibited sensitivity comparable to a classical single immunofluorescence assay, as we
obtained a significant signal up to a 1:5,000 dilution
against respective strains used for immunization. For
some strains, specific signals were associated with crossreactions. However, the intensity easily allowed the correct identification of the strain, except for B. rattimassiliensis polyclonal serum, which reacted with B. tribocorum as
well. However, we easily discriminated between the
strains, as the B. tribocorum polyclonal serum did not react
significantly with B. rattimassiliensis. These signals were
delivered without a previous cross-adsorption and without separate analysis. During the immunoassay, some
problems may occur, such as a hook effect [23,24], due to
the variation in the amount of spotted antigen that cannot
be easily detected even by using different test controls.
However, the problem can be avoided by testing several
dilutions. Polyclonal serum can be unsuccessful due to
possible variations in antigen recognition, selection of
antibody secreting clones by the immune system control,
or mutations that occur during the immune response
[25,26]. The two Bartonella strains, B. rattimassiliensis and
B. tribocorum, were isolated from rodents. Phylogenetic
studies based on ITS, 16S rDNA, genes of four intracellular
proteins and the groEL gene, have indicated close clusters
for these two Bartonella strains, but also for all B. vinsoni
subsp, for B. phoceensis and B. alsatica, and for B. doshiae
and B. taylorii [27]. Our newly designed technique was
successful in discriminating among all the strains in the
last three clusters stated above, as well as strains responsible for human Bartonella diseases.

Using the second array, we identified known strains from
homeless persons, such as B. quintana, confirming that
urban trench fever is endemic in the homeless population. We demonstrated that 1 hour is sufficient to test four
samples, suggesting that our new serological approach
could be a practical tool for serotyping of isolated strains
using specific polyclonal antisera and reference bacteria.
We have also screened monoclonal antibodies produced
against B. claridgeae, in order to find a monoclonal antibody that broadly reacts with the Bartonella species. The
best result was obtained with the monoclonal antibodies
against GroEL. Microarray revealed three categories, corresponding to preserved or variable epitopes of the GroEL
protein in the genus Bartonella. This monoclonal antibody
failed to react with B. birtlesii and the study has been
repeated four times with the same negative results. How-

good reactivity, excluding the defaults in the spotted antigen. The sequence alignments of seven strains of GroEL
proteins (B. bovis; B. quintana Oklahoma; B. clarridgeiae; B.

birtlesii;)[19](Fig 6), showed that a single mutation at
position 427 (leucine in isoleucine) is specific to B.

birtlesii. This mutation could explain the lack of reaction
to B. birtlesii by the monoclonal antibodies and the
important role of this amino acid in the conformation
and recognition by the monoclonal antibody. New serological investigations with large-scale use of bacteria from
the same species or the combined genus of the pathogens

Bartonella diseases.

Conclusion
We demonstrated that microarray of spotted bacteria can
be a practical tool for serotyping of unidentified strains or
species (and also for affinity determination) by polyclonal
and monoclonal antibodies. This could be used in
research and for identification of bacterial strains.

Methods
Preparation of antigens
For this experiment, twenty-nine Bartonella strains were
used (Table 1). All strains were cultured on Columbia agar
supplemented with 5% sheep blood (BioMerieux, Marcy
l'Etoile, France) at 37°C using the Generbag system
(BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), except B. bacilliformis, for which cultivation was performed at 28°C. Bacterial colonies were scrapped off carefully from the agar
plates and suspended in 10 ml phosphate buffer (pH 7.2,

added to obtain a final concentration of 75% and the bacterial suspensions were incubated overnight at 4°C. On
the following day, each cell-suspension was washed twice
with 20 ml sterile PBS and bacterial density was adjusted
to 109/ml after counting with Microcyte (BioDetect, Oslo,
Norway), and then stored at 4°C. Several aliquots were

removed from the cell-suspension for sterility controls,

for spotting.
Production of polyclonal antisera
For each Bartonella strain, one six-week old female Balb/C
mouse was inoculated intraperitoneally with a mixture of
10 μg bacterial protein, 400 μg aluminium hydroxide and
10 μg CpG, as previously described [28]. Two booster
doses were given over a 14-day interval. Blood samples
were drawn ten days after the last immunisation under
isoflurane anaesthetic conditions (Abbott, Rungis,
France). Sera were separated by centrifugation and stored
at 4°C for serological tests. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to verify IgG response of immunised
mice against their respective Bartonella strain. Antigens
were deposited on slides with a pen nib. Slides were airdried and fixed in methanol for 2 min at room temperature. Wells were overlaid with 30 μl of serum diluted in
PBS containing 3% non-fat dry milk and incubated in a
moist chamber at 37°C for 30 min. Afterwards, the slides
were washed two times in PBS-0.5% Tween for 5 min each
and rinsed for 4 min with desionized water. Slides were
air-dried and bound-antibodies were detected with a FITC
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Immunotech, Marseille,
France) diluted at 1: 400 in PBS containing 3% non-fat
dry milk and 0.2% Evans blue (BioMerieux, Marcy
l'Etoile, France). Slides were washed as described above
and mounted with Fluoprep (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile,
France), and then examined under the Olympus BX-51
epifluorescence microscope at × 400 magnification. Sera
from five healthy mice were used as a negative control.

Immunofluorecence assay on 29 Bartonella strains array
We developed an automatic and miniaturized technology
of an immunofluorescence assay, derived from classical
immunofluorescence. Antigens were spotted by using a
micoarray spotter robot on glass slides to simultaneously
analyse the immunological response against all the strains
of bacteria. The spotter deposited 1 nl (100 at 200 μm of
diameter) onto each spot separated by 500 μm. We used
goat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France)
to stick and increase the thickness of antigens to the glass
slides and to control spotting quality. Spotted slides were
fixed in ethanol for 10 min and air-dried as in classical
immunofluorescence. Antigenic spots were identified at
395 nm by staining the goat IgG with a fluorophore, 6((7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetyl) amino) hexanoic
acid (AMCA) (Interchim, Montluçon, France). Five milligram portions of goat IgG were labelled with AMCA by
suspending IgG in 1 ml PBS (pH 8.0) and then mixed with
40 μl AMCA 0.5% for 30 min in the dark. AMCA labelled
goat IgG were purified by washing using YM-30 Microcon
centrifugal filters (Millipore, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines,
France) and stored at -20°C. Specific proteins (1 mg/ml)
used as controls were simultaneously distributed as separate spots to validate each immunofluorescence assay
step. Protein A from S. aureus (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France)[29] was used to verify the serum by
unspecific protein A binding, whereas mouse IgG (Sigma
Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) was used to
monitor secondary antibody distribution. Bovine serum
albumin (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France)
and goat IgG AMCA were assayed to evaluate background
noise. Thirty-five microlitres of each bacterial or protein

suspension were mixed with 15 μl of labelled goat IgG,
and distributed into 96-well plates. 35 to 50 pl of each
antigen was deposited using an Affymetrix 427 Arrayer
(MWG Biotech, Courtaboeuf, france) on SuperFrost glass
slides (Menzel-Glasser, Braunschweig, Germany) previously degreased in a deionised water bath with a Leo 50
ultrasonic cleaner (FisherScientific, Illkirch, France) for 5
min, followed by 10 min immersion in acetone/ethanol
(50/50 v-v). Spot quality was verified by observing the
slides under a 365 nm-wavelength light (Fig 1) and slides
with perfect circular spots without smears were stored at
room temperature in the dark.
The immunofluorescence assay was performed on spotted
slides at room temperature in an automated incubator,
with which four different sera could be run in parallel
(Inodiag, La Ciotat, France). Polyclonal sera were diluted
in PBS containing 0.5% sodium azide and 5% goat serum.
Forty-five microlitres of the diluted sera were distributed
into circular steel-chambers. Each spotted slide was
clamped over each chamber, which allowed sealing and
contact between the slides and deposits. All of the necessary steps, such as the continuous distribution of reagents,
including secondary antibody addition, washing and drying steps, were automatically executed in the chamber.
After 20 min of incubation, the diluted sample was
removed and the slide was washed for 3 min by flooding
with a solution of PBS-0.5% sodium azide-10% goat
serum. Distribution of secondary FITC-conjugated antibody (Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France) was performed in PBS-0.5% sodium azide-10% goat IgG solution
at 1: 150 dilution for 20 min, followed by a washing step
as described above and was then rinsed with deionised
water for 1 min and air-dried for 5 min. At the end of the
incubation, slides were examined with a fluorescent camera analyser (Inodiag, La Ciotat, France) with a successive
exposure to 365 nm and 480 nm light during 0.2 ms each,
and the arbitrary unit values (AUV) were automatically
allotted for each spot using data processing Analarray 4.41 (Inodiag, La Ciotat, France) in the following manner:
the first reading at 365 nm determined the area of each
spot and verified the presence of all antigens. The view
obtained after reading at 470 nm was superimposed with
that obtained at 365 nm and fluorescence of the defined
area was converted into a grey scale pixel image. Values
were then calculated on the defined grey-coloured pixels.
Analysis was rejected if some spots were not detected after
reading at 365 nm or if the fluorescence level of protein
control spots at 470 nm was too low. Four slides can be
simultaneously treated on the same incubator with a gap
of one hour and the reading and interpreting of one slide
could be done in 1 minute. For this experiment, we subtracted BSA spot values from all the other spot values
obtained. All measurements were carried out in triplicate

with a standard deviation +/- 500 AUV and the average
values were considered.
Bacterial strains from homeless and array for serotyping
Bartonella strains were obtained for the study from two
shelters visited in Marseilles by a medical team, as in previously described studies [30]. Isolated bacteria were
expanded and submitted to the same treatment as Bartonella reference strains. A new array for serotyping was
constituted with these strains, four Bartonella reference
strains (B. quintana, B. clarridgeiae, B. henselae Houston
and B. henselae Marseille), five bacteria strains as blind test
control (A: B. alsatica; B: B. vinsoni berkhoffii; C: B. koehlerae; D: A. caulinodans; E: B. elizabethae) and four protein
controls (mouse IgG, BSA, protein A and goat IgG). B.
quintana monoclonal antibody was used to compare with
polyclonal sera. This monoclonal antibody was produce
in our lab for this study with a titer at 6400 and use at dilution 1/3.
Monoclonal antibody production
In order to obtain Bartonella monoclonal antibodies identifying all Bartonella, we previously tested the different
Bartonella strains with mouse polyclonal antibodies by
western blot assay. We found that Bartonella clarridgeiae
antisera can react with the GroEL protein from all Bartonella and we selected this antigen to produce broad spectrum Bartonella monoclonal antibodies (data not shown).
A cell pellet of Bartonella clarridgeiae (100 μg) was prepared as previously described, suspended in Laemmli
buffer and heated for 5 min at 95°C. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10
min. Soluble proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE,
followed by Coomassie blue staining (0.2% Methanol,
0.5% TCA, 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G). The
major GroEL protein was extracted from the polyacrylamide gel by the electroelution method using the ElutaTube™
Protein
Extraction
Kit
(Euromedex,
Mundolsheim, France) according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Fig 2). Three six week old female mice were
intraperitoneally inoculated with 1 μg gro EL protein as
described above. Four days after the last booster dose,
spleen cells were submitted to polyethylene glycol fusion
(Roche Diagnostic, Meylan, France) with X63 Ag 8.653
myeloma cells. Fused cells were seeded in a hypoxanthine-aminopterine-thymidine selective medium (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) and hybridoma
supernatants were screened by immunofluorescence assay
using B. clarridgeiae strain as mentioned above. Positive
hybridomas were subcloned by the limiting dilution
method.
