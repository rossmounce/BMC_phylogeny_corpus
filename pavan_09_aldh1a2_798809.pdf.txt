Abstract
Background: Signaling by the vitamin A-derived morphogen retinoic acid (RA) is required at
multiple steps of cardiac development. Since conversion of retinaldehyde to RA by retinaldehyde
dehydrogenase type II (ALDH1A2, a.k.a RALDH2) is critical for cardiac development, we screened
patients with congenital heart disease (CHDs) for genetic variation at the ALDH1A2 locus.
Methods: One-hundred and thirty-three CHD patients were screened for genetic variation at the
ALDH1A2 locus through bi-directional sequencing. In addition, six SNPs (rs2704188, rs1441815,
rs3784259, rs1530293, rs1899430) at the same locus were studied using a TDT-based association
approach in 101 CHD trios. Observed mutations were modeled through molecular mechanics
(MM) simulations using the AMBER 9 package, Sander and Pmemd programs. Sequence
conservation of observed mutations was evaluated through phylogenetic tree construction from
ungapped alignments containing ALDH8 s, ALDH1Ls, ALDH1 s and ALDH2 s. Trees were
generated by the Neighbor Joining method. Variations potentially affecting splicing mechanisms
were cloned and functional assays were designed to test splicing alterations using the pSPL3 splicing
assay.
Results: We describe in Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) the mutations Ala151Ser and Ile157Thr that
change non-polar to polar residues at exon 4. Exon 4 encodes part of the highly-conserved
tetramerization domain, a structural motif required for ALDH oligomerization. Molecular
mechanics simulation studies of the two mutations indicate that they hinder tetramerization. We
determined that the SNP rs16939660, previously associated with spina bifida and observed in
patients with TOF, does not affect splicing. Moreover, association studies performed with classical

models and with the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) design using single marker genotype,
or haplotype information do not show differences between cases and controls.
Conclusion: In summary, our screen indicates that ALDH1A2 genetic variation is present in TOF
patients, suggesting a possible causal role for this gene in rare cases of human CHD, but does not
support the hypothesis that variation at the ALDH1A2 locus is a significant modifier of the risk for
CHD in humans.

Background
Congenital heart disease (CHD) was thought to be a
multi-factorial, polygenic disease whose genes were as
inscrutable as its postulated environmental agents [1].
Nowadays, some familial forms of CHD such as Tetralogy
of Fallot (TOF), Atrial Septal Defects (ASD), Ventricular
Septal Defects (VSD) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
[2] are explained by reduced dosage (haploinsufficiency)
of genes with major roles in cardiac development such as
transcription factors [3,4], sarcomeric proteins [5], extracellular matrix proteins [6] and ionic channels [7].
Haploinsufficiency of a number of these genes can produce similar phenotypes (locus heterogeneity) and the
same mutation is often not manifested (incomplete penetrance), or is expressed as a different anatomical/functional entity in the context of single families (variable
expression) [8-10]. Therefore, CHD is heterogeneous even
in the familial setting, suggesting that it has a more complex genetic basis than pure haploinsufficiency. It is likely
that the instability caused by insufficient dosage of genes
that are critical or permissive throughout cardiac development weakens cardiac morphogenesis, predisposing the
embryo to a host of morphogenetic defects [4]. In this
probabilistic view, defects could be triggered by unfavorable combinations of allelic variants of minor effect of cardiac development genes, by environmental insults such as
changes in nutritional status (e.g. vitamin A) [11], or by
exposure to toxic chemicals (e.g. alcohol) [12]. In this
sense, the morphological consequences of these alterations would be contingent on the particular developmental processes that were at play when regulatory
mechanisms were overcome.
Genes belonging to retinoic acid (RA) metabolic and signaling pathways are targets for investigation as direct
causal agents, or modifiers of CHD. RA is a powerful morphogen utilized during early development for axial patterning and, at later stages, for organogenesis. The
vertebrate heart is particularly affected by variations in RA
signaling [13] and either deprivation, or excess of its precursor (Vitamin A or retinol) at multiple developmental
stages produces cardiac and vascular malformation in animal models [14].

RA is a carotenoid that cannot be synthesized de novo by
animals and thus, must be obtained from preformed animal-derived precursors such as retinyl esters and retinol
(Vitamin A) [15], suggesting a direct link between nutritional status and teratogenesis. There are multiple metabolic routes to generate RA and these pathways require
oxidative steps (reviewed in [16]). In humans, RA is synthesized from vitamin A (retinol). Retinol freely crosses
membranes, but it is also transported to cells by retinol
binding protein (RBP), which transfers retinol to cells via
STRA-6, a membrane receptor [17]. STRA-6 is a target in
congenital human diseases manifested by defects in eye,
lung, heart and skeletal muscle, as well as by mental retardation [18,19]. Within cells, retinol is successively oxidized to retinaldehyde and, then, to RA. The first step is
reversible and is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenases
(ADHs), or by short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases
(SDRs) [20]. The second step is the irreversible conversion
of retinaldehyde to RA. In vertebrates this reaction is catalyzed by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (a.k.a. RALDHs)
that belong to two aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) families, the ALDH1 s (all-trans and 9-cis retinaldehyde dehydrogenases ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3) and the
9-cis retinaldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH8 s (a.k.a.
RALDH4) [16]. Among RALDHs, ALDH1A2 is the major
form involved in early embryonic and in cardiac development [21,13]. The most severe form of RA signaling deprivation is the genetic deficiency of ALDH1A2, which is
lethal at 8.5 days post-fertilization in mice [13,22].
In this study we used ALDH1A2 as an entry point to
understand the relationship between RA metabolism and
human CHD. Our goal was to establish whether the
ALDH1A2 gene is a target for genetic alterations that
could produce or, at least, modify the expression of
human CHD. We utilized a two-pronged strategy based
on a genetic screen to detect mutations carrying the potential to alter enzyme activity and a family-based genetic
association study to inquire whether genetic variation at
the ALDH1A2 locus modulates the risk to develop CHD.

Paulo, Brazil were invited to participate in the study.
Venous blood was obtained for genomic DNA extraction
from each participant of the study. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of São Paulo Medical School and all participants read
and signed an approved informed consent.
PCR and DNA sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by means of a salting-out procedure [23]. We have
created specific genotyping assays for each genotyped
marker. Briefly, the studied polymorphisms were detected
by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP). A 30-cycle PCR was carried out in a PTC-DNA Engine Tetrad2 using a 10 μL reactive solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50
mm KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM of each dNTP, 0.3 U
Easy Taq DNA Polymerase, 5 pmol of each primer and 1
μL of genomic DNA template. PCR products were digested
with 1 U of restriction enzyme and visualized by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Quality control for these assays
was assessed by randomly selecting and re-assaying 40
samples. To genotype the A151G polymorphism we
employed a direct sequencing strategy using primers
directed against flanking regions of human ALDH1A2
exon 4. The DNA sequences were determined by bi-directional sequencing. For sequencing, the PCR products were
purified with E.Z.N.A. Cycle-Pure Kit (200), Omega BioTek, USA, according to manufacturer's instructions. Bidirectional direct sequencing was carried out using the
Applied Biosystems (ABI, Foster City, CA) v3.1 Dye-Terminator Sequencing Kit and an ABI 377 Sequencer. The
same strategy was employed to sequence the ALDH1A2
gene (see additional file 1 - Supplemental table S1).
Bioinformatics tools
The localization (chromosome 15) and structure of
ALDH1A2 gene was obtained from Ensembl
http:www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/genev
iew?gene=ENSG00000128918. For describing DNA
changes we have used the HGVS nomenclature http://
www.hgvs.org. NCBI reference sequences used were
NM_003888.2 and NP_003879.2. For our family-based
study we chose a set of polymorphic markers that spread
throughout the ALDH1A2 gene. These markers were chosen
from
the
dbSNP
database
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP and included only those
with suitable frequencies for genotyping. Primer pairs
were designed with the Interactive software Primer Design
- GeneFisher http://www.genefisher.de. For the splicing
site analysis we used the ESEfinder program, available at
http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/tools/ESE3/ese
finder.cgi?process=home. To evaluate the structural consequences of the sequence alterations we determined on
RNA folding we used the Genebee program http://

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/10/113

www.genebee.msu.su/. Linkage disequilibrium structure
determination was conducted using the Haploview 3.2
software.
Association study design
To determine the linkage disequilibrium structure of the
ALDH1A2 locus in our population we selected 6 SNPs
that cover the genomic region harboring the human
ALDH1A2 gene (see additional file 1 - Supplemental table
S2), including the genetic marker rs16939660, previously
associated to spina bifida [24]. The linkage disequilibrium
information was used to optimize our tests for the possible association between genetic variability at the
ALDH1A2 locus and CHD through a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT).
pSPL3 splicing assay
Fragments of the human ALDH1A2 gene containing the
wild type exon 4, p.Ala151Ser or p.Ala151Ala silent
mutant, flanked by about 450 bp of intronic sequences
were cloned into the splicing vector pSPL3 [25], generating plasmids WT-ALDH1A2 Exon 4-pSPL3 and MTsALDH1A2 Exon 4-pSPL3. In pSPL3, two short exons of
the HIV tat gene are separated by a long intron, which is
excised upon splicing to give rise to mature mRNA containing exon 1 and 2. Genomic fragments inserted into
the pSPL3 intron are spliced according to the potency of
their splicing signals, providing an assay for mutations
that affect splicing efficiency [25]. Plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 human embryonic cells using calcium phosphate precipitation [26]. After 48 hours mRNA
was extracted from cells and reversed-transcribed to generate templates for PCR amplification with primers flanking
pSPL3 exons 1 and 2. PCR conditions were adjusted to
produce amplicons in the linear range. PCR reactions
were performed at 35 cycles (n = 5). Quantification was
performed in ethidium bromide-labeled agarose gels with
the Scion Image program (ported from NIH Image for the
Macintosh by Scion Corporation). Results are represented
as the percentage of exon 4 exclusion in pSPL3-derived
amplicons. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of
the mean (SEM).
ALDH sequences and phylogeny
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus tropicalis
and Danio rerio genomes were examined for ALDH
sequences and phylogenetic trees were constructed from
an ungapped alignment containing ALDH8 s, ALDH1Ls,
ALDH1 s and ALDH2 s. Trees were generated by the
Neighbor Joining method (NJ) [27] and were rooted with
an outgroup formed by ALDH8 s. Nodes with bootstrap
inferior to 80% were collapsed.

Cloning, cell culture and mRNA extraction
The ALDH1A2 gene exon 4 was PCR amplified from
genomic DNA from a heterozygous patient for the silent
p.Ala151Ala mutation. The amplified fragments were
then cloned into the PCR-Script plasmid (PCR-Script Amp
Cloning Kit - Stratagene, CAT# 21189.5). Cloned inserts
were sequenced to certify that mutations were not generated during the PCR amplification step. The fragments
were then subcloned into EcoRV and SstI sites from the
splicing vector pSPL3 [25].

HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% of FBS at 37°C, in 5% of CO2. Six-well
plates were utilized and the cells were cultured up to 75%
of confluence. For transfection, we utilized Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen™/cat. 11668-019). Each well was transfected
with 1,6 ug of plasmid DNA.
RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection with Trizol reagent (GIBCO BRL, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The following sequences of primers were utilized to amplify the cDNA fragments. SA2: ATC TCA GTG
GTA TTT GTG AGC; SD2: GTG AAC TGC ACT GTG ACA
AGC. Amplified PCR products were visualized by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and stored in digital format.
Structural analyses
To evaluate how mutations Ala151Ser and Ile157Thr may
impact protein folding, we built two structural models for
ALDH1A2mutant proteins. For that we employed homology modeling based on the published structure of Rattus
norvegicus ALDH1A2 (PDB id 1BI9) as a template, using
the Nest program from Jackal package [28]. The stereo
chemical quality of the structures was analyzed with Procheck [29]. The leap program, of AMBER 9 package [30]
was used to prepare the structure for molecular mechanics
(MM) simulations. MM was carried in explicit solvent and
MM trajectories were calculated using Sander and Pmemd
programs, of AMBER 9 package. A cutoff of 8 Å was used
for electrostatic interactions. The solvated complex was
equilibrated by carrying out a short steepest descent minimization, followed by 50 ps of heating (0 to 300 K) and
50 ps of density equilibration with weak restraints on the
complex, ending with 6 ns of conformational exploration
at 300 K. All simulations were run using the shake
approach on hydrogen atoms, a 2 fs time step, and Langevin dynamics for temperature control. We calculated
the potential energy for 600 monomer conformations
wild type and mutant structures produced along the MM
using the MM_PBSA program of AMBER9 package. To
find the more energetically stable regions in the conformational space we estimated the inverse coefficient of variation (CV-1) for each 1 ns window of the MM simulation
run. The most stable monomer configurations were identified as those with the lowest mean energy and highest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/10/113

CV-1 Mutant dimer and tetramer models were built using
non-crystallographic symmetry obtained from PDB 2BI9
for monomer configurations of lowest energy. Dimer and
tetramer models were analyzed for structural hindrances.
Statistical analysis
Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated through
gene counting. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested
with the Chi-square test. We used Haploview 3.2 software
for linkage disequilibrium and haplotype determination.
A possible association between presence of a particular
genotyped allele and disease was tested through the TDT
test, performed with Haploview 3.2. Haplotype analyses
were conducted using the Haploview TDT association test.
We considered p values less than 0, 05 on a 2-sided test as
significant. Using the Quanto software Version 1.2.3 and
considering the tested sample and markers we anticipate
an eighty percent statistical power to detect an effect size
(odds ratio) of 3,0 for the rarer observed haplotype (0,05)
and 2,3 for the commonest observed haplotype (0,31).

Results
Mutation screening in CHD
To test whether the ALDH1A2 gene is a target for mutations in human CHD we employed DHPLC (denaturing
high performance liquid chromatography) [31] followed
by bi-directional DNA sequencing in a group of patients
with multiple CHD etiologies (see additional file 1 - Supplemental table S3). DNA fragments corresponding to all
ALDH1A2 exons were PCR amplified and submitted to
DHPLC, and those displaying altered elution profiles were
selected for bi-directional sequencing. This first screening
in a heterogeneous CHD setting revealed 6 alterations:
one c.A453G transition previously characterized as a synonymous, p.Ala151Ala, polymorphism (rs16939660)
associated with spina bifida [24] and five intronic alterations (Table 1). None of these changes occurred within
the Kozak sequence. As these alterations are potentially
associated with only a modest to low risk of genetic
defects [32], we hypothesized that the failure to detect
ALDH1A2 variants associated with high risk of CHD was
due to insufficient numbers of patients in each of the
CHD categories represented. Therefore, we next explored
ALDH1A2 alterations in a group constituted only by TOF
patients.
Mutation screening in Tetralogy of Fallot
Fifty TOF patients, tested negative for chromosome
22q11.2 microdeletion [33], were examined by direct bidirectional sequencing of ALDH1A2 exons. This second
screen identified two non-conservative mutations at exon
4, which encodes part of the tetramerization domain, an
oligomerization surface responsible for assembly of
enzyme dimers and tetramers [34]. A c.T470C transition
(p.Ile157Thr) changed a non-polar isoleucine residue to a

polar threonine and a c.G451T transversion changed a
non-polar alanine to a polar serine (p.Ala151Ser) (Figures
1A and 1B). These alterations were not observed in 150
normal individuals (300 chromosomes) screened, nor in
the first 83 individuals with diverse forms of CHD or in
the remaining 48 TOF sequenced cases (summing up 262
chromosomes) and have not been described before in
open-source SNP databases.
We also identified a conservative valine to isoleucine
mutation at exon 9 (p.Val348Ile), which was previously
characterized as a common variant rs4646626; an A to G
transition 6 bp upstream from the transcription start, previously described as polymorphism rs34645259; and a
synonymous SNP p.Ile418Ile at exon 11, previously characterized as polymorphism rs35251510.
The patient harboring the p.Ala151Ser substitution was a
21-year-old man, the first child of non-consanguineous
parents. He was born at term and was diagnosed with TOF
at the age of 2 months. His milestones were normal and
he has normal intelligence. He was referred to our service
at the age of 1 year and 10 months for surgical correction.
On physical examination, his weight was 7.2 kg, height,
77 cm. He had no dysmorphic features. Laboratory tests
included an echocardiogram that revealed subaortic VSD,
severe pulmonary stenosis (systolic gradient of 85
mmHg) with a pulmonary artery truncus of 1.2 cm and
pulmonary artery branches of 1.0 cm. There were no coronary anomalies and no aortopulmonary collateral arteries. Abdominal and renal ultrasounds were normal. The
skeletal survey was unremarkable. The Ala151Ser mutation was also present in the genome of his father (Figure
1B).

The patient harboring the Ile157Thr substitution was an
18-year-old man, the second child of non-consanguineous parents. He was born at term with a birth weight of
3,300 g and was diagnosed with a heart murmur at the age
of 15 days. His milestones were all normal and he has normal intelligence. He was referred to our service at 1 month
for a congenital heart disease diagnosis workup. On physical examination, his weight was 3.870 kg, height, 55 cm.
He had no dysmorphic features. No clinical stigmata of
Noonan/Noonan-like syndrome or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome were present. Laboratory tests included
an echocardiogram that revealed TOF. While preparing
for surgical correction, abdominal and renal ultrasounds
detected a kidney mass, eventually diagnosed as Wilms
tumor. Wilms tumor was unilateral and was treated with
chemotherapy and surgery at the age of 3 years. Skeletal
surveys disclosed no abnormalities. Tetralogy of Fallot
was corrected (total correction) at the age of 4 and, interestingly, agenesis of the left pericardium was observed
during corrective surgery. The Ile157Thr mutation was
also present in the genome of his mother.
Evolutionary conservation of ALDH1A2 amino acids
mutated in TOF
Non-conservative mutations are low frequency alterations
that carry a moderate to high risk of genetic defects,
depending on the location and function of the amino acid
in the protein structure [32]. Very often, the structural and
functional importance of a particular amino acid is underscored by its evolutionary conservation. To evaluate the
extent to which Ala151 and Ile157 are conserved, and,
therefore, more likely to be required for protein structure
and function, we produced an alignment of vertebrate
ALDH1As. This alignment also contains the closely

Aldh1a2 mutations in Tetralogy of Fallot: evolutionary conservation of affected amino acids. A) The T to C transition at nucleotide 470 changes an ATT cistron into ACT, leading to the substitution of an Isoleucine at position 157 by a
Threonine. The p.Ile157Thr was traced back to a maternal allele. B: The G to T transversion at nucleotide 451 changes a GCA
cistron into TCA, leading to the substitution of an Alanine at position 151 by a Serine. The p.Ala151Ser mutation was traced
back to a paternal allele. Interestingly, one paternal allele and one maternal allele both display an A to G transition at nucleotide
453, producing the p.Ala151Ala silent mutation (rs16939660). C) An alignment representing vertebrate Aldh1a1-3 (all-trans
and 9-cis retinaldehyde dehydrogenases), the closely related ALDH2 s and ALDH1B1 s, as well as Aldh1Ls (Tetrahydrofolate
Dehydrogenases) and ALDH8 s (9-cis retinaldehyde dehydrogenases) as outgroups. The alignment indicates that Ala151 (dark
shading) is highly conserved in all ALDHs represented, while Ile157 is conserved in all vertebrate ALDH1As (light shading).
Numbers displayed in the phylogenetic tree represent bootstrap support for the nodes represented.

related ALDH2 and ALDH1B1 genes, together with
ALDH1Ls (formyl tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases) and
ALDH8 s (9-cis retinaldehyde dehydrogenases) as outgroups.
As indicated in Figure 1C Ala151 is conserved in all vertebrate ALDH1A2 s, as well as in its paralogs, ALDH1A1 s
and ALDH1A3 s. Ala151 is also conserved in ALDH2 s,
ALDH1B1 s, as well as in ALDH8 s and is the predominant
residue in formyl tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases
(ALDH1L1s), which are important players in folate
metabolism and possess an ALDH domain closely related
to ALDH1 s (figure 1C).
Ile157 is conserved in all vertebrate ALDH1A2 s, as well as
in ALDH1A3 s and is the predominant residue in
ALDH1A1 s, except in frogs, which display a divergent
asparagine (X.tropicalis), or a closely related valine (X.laevis) (Figure 1C and data not shown). Interestingly, this
residue is the predominant amino acid in ALDH1L1 s,
while in the closely related ALDH2 s and ALDH1B1 s the
position is occupied by aromatic residues, or Histidine
and Glutamine, respectively (Figure 1C).
In sum, p.Ala151Ser is a non-conservative mutation in an
amino acid that has been deeply conserved in the evolution of the ALDH super family, while p.Ile157Thr has
been conserved in vertebrates at least since the divergence
of the sarcopterygean and actinopterygean lineages of
bony fishes 450 millions of years ago [35].
Structural roles of ALDH1A2 amino acids mutated in TOF
Non-conservative mutations in gene coding regions
potentially affect protein function, as they may alter protein structure. To evaluate how mutations p.Ala151Ser
and p.Ile157Thr impact protein structure, we built two
structural models for ALDH1A2mutant proteins.

p.Ala151Ser is located on alpha-helix-C, which contributes one of the sides of the catalytic channel pocket and
also anchors the three-stranded beta-sheet that forms the
oligomerization domain (orange arrowhead, Figure 2A).
[34,36].
p.Ile157Thr occupies a position between the C-terminal
capping of alpha-helix-C (Lys156) and the first betastrand of the oligomerization domain (red arrowhead,
Figure 2A) [34,36]. In the native protein, Ile157 forms a
hydrophobic cluster with Leu500, Trp153 and Tyr150.
To explore whether subunit association may be affected
by disruption of polar and/or hydrophobic interactions at
the oligomerization surfaces, or close to them, we
screened the conformational space of wild-type and
mutant ALDH1A2 structures with molecular mechanics

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/10/113

(MM) simulations. In these analyses the wild-type structure yielded four highly stable conformations (-8,264
Kcal/mol for the most stable of them) (Figure 2E), while
p.Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr mutant proteins produced
four and seven highly stable conformations, with -8,105
Kcal/mol and -8,296 Kcal/mol for the most stable conformations of p.Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr mutants, respectively (see additional file 2 and 3 - Supplemental Figure
S1).
The superimposition of stable mutant structures upon the
native structure generated RMSDs (root mean square deviations) of 3.18 Å and 7.36 Å for Ala151Ser and
p.Ile157Thr, respectively, indicating that p.Ile157Thr produces more pronounced structural changes than
p.Ala151Ser. Since both p.Ala151Ser and p.Ile157Thr are
located at the tetramerization domain, which is the oligomerization structure responsible for formation of protein dimers and tetramers, we evaluated whether these
mutations would interfere with the ability of monomers
to associate in dimers (Figure 2E-I), or with the capability
of dimers to join in as tetramers (Figure 2J-M). We first
evaluated the effects of mutations upon dimer formation.
As indicated in Figure 2F and 2G, both mutations change
the conformation of the three stranded beta-sheet of the
tetramerization domain. This disrupts the delicate interaction network that occurs between the dimerization surfaces of interacting monomers (Figure 2H and 2I). By its
turn, disruption of interactive surfaces induces alterations
in dimer coupling that are also reflected in the protein surfaces utilized for tetramerization These effects are demonstrated in Figure 2L, which depicts a large clashing region
that includes the three-stranded beta-sheets of the
tetramerization domains of p.Ile157Thr mutant and wild
type heterotetramers. In summary, the stereo chemical
conflicts associated with the p.Ile157Thr mutation are
much larger than those associated with the p.Ala151Ser
mutation (Figure 2M).
Splicing effects of Aldh1a2 mutations in TOF
Mutations in nucleotidesthat are part of splicing signals
are frequent in genetic diseases (Krawczek et al., 1992). To
evaluate a possible splicing involvement of the ALDH1A2
alterations that we detected in TOF, we tested whether
they would map to known binding sites for exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), or for exonic splicing silencers
(ESSs). This analysis indicated that the non-conservative
p.Ala151Ser (G451T transversion) and the synonymous
mutation p.Ala151Ala (c.A453G transition) both map to
a putative binding site (CGAAGGC) for the splicing factor
SF2/ASF within exon 4 (Figure 3A-C). Because of the link
reported here between p.Ala151Ser and TOF, and of the
reported association of p.Ala151Ala with spina bifida
[24], we set out to investigate the effect of these mutations
in exon 4 splicing.

Using the pSPL3 splicing assay [25] in human embryonic
kidney 293 cells (HEK), we showed that the splicing signals of exon 4 are only of moderate strength, as demonstrated by exclusion rates of 20,9 ± 1,6%, range 13,5 to
35,9%). This finding is consistent with the description of
an ALDH1A2 EST (DA747232), in which exon 4 is missing from the transcript [37]. As demonstrated in Figure
3D, the p.Ala151Ser (c.G451T transversion) completely
rescues exon 4 splicing, increasing the proportion of the
correctly spliced version from 76% to 100%. This indicates that the mutation increased, rather than decreased,
the splicing strength of exon 4. In contrast, the
p.Ala151Ala/c.A453G polymorphism is not associated
with significant changes in the ability to correctly splice

exon 4 (28,0 ± 2,9% exclusion of exon 4 for mutant
c.A453G, versus 24,0 ± 2,8% for the wild type; p = 0.36;
two-tailed, paired T-test) (Figure 3E).
Since synonymous changes can also affect splicing function by interfering with mRNA secondary structure [38],
we investigated whether the c.A453G transition was consistent with significant changes in this parameter. The
results of these investigations are described in Supplemental Figure S2 (see additional file 2 and 4 - Supplemental
Figure S2) and suggest that c.A453G is associated with
pronounced and specific changes in predicted mutant
mRNA structure, which are reflected in a large differences

ALDH1A2 variants as possible modulators of the risk to
CHD
Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structure at the ALDH1A2
locus
To investigate the hypothesis that variation at the
ALDH1A2 locus modulates the risk of CHD we developed
association studies based on polymorphic markers publicly available, including the c.A453G transition associated with spina bifida [24]. Polymorphic markers
rs2704188; rs1441815; rs3784259; rs1530293 and
rs1899430; were first utilized to determine the linkage
disequilibrium structure (LD) and haplotype frequencies
at the ALDH1A2 locus. Figure 4 indicates that the
ALDH1A2 locus can be represented by two LD blocks. The
first and largest LD block includes rs2704188; (13 kb
upstream of translation start site), rs1441815 (10 kb
downstream of exon 7) rs1530293 (37 kb downstream of
the stop codon,), as well as rs3784259 (75 bp downstream of exon 8). Therefore, this large block includes
sequences from the 5' region up to the 3' region. The second and smaller LD block contains the polymorphic
marker rs1899430, which is located in the 3' untranslated
region (39 kb downstream from the stop codon).
Genotype and Haplotype Association Analysis
The assayed markers, based on LD, frequency and distribution along the ALDH1A2 gene, were used in familybased association tests performed in 101 CHD trios. As
displayed in Supplemental Table S4 (see additional file

Figure disequilibrium blocks
Linkage 4
Linkage disequilibrium blocks. The structure of linkage
disequilibrium between the single nucleotide polymorphisms
shows two different blocks. The first one comprises markers
1 to 4 and the second block is formed by markers 5.

1), none of the assayed marker genotype displayed any
significant association with CHD when tested under TDT,
or when tested under a standard family-based association
test using parent genotypes as controls (not shown). Likewise, TDT analysis using CHD trios did not uncover
ALDH1A2 haplotypes associated with significantly higher
or lower risks of CHD in our population sample (see additional file 1 - Supplemental Table S5).
Association studies with the Ala151Ala silent mutation (c.A453G
transition)
Because of the low population frequency of the c.A453G
transition (and the anticipated low statistical power of
TDT designs for this particular marker) we developed a
case-control association study. To evaluate the frequency
of the c.A453G transition, we sequenced 201 patients
with TOF and a control group composed of 44 healthy
individuals. c.A453G heterozygosity was present in 7
patients (3.5% of the CHD individuals), while in the control group 3 people were heterozygous for the variant
(6,8% of healthy individuals). There was no statistical difference between genotype frequencies for this particular
genetic marker.

Discussion
In this study we set out to investigate if the ALDH1A2 gene
is involved in human CHD. Our results indicate that there
are, indeed, rare non-conservative mutations at deeply
conserved positions in the ALDH1A2 molecule that carry
an elevated risk of functional consequences. The frequency of these ALDH1A2 mutants is low, but not appreciably different from the frequency displayed by cardiacenriched transcription factors such as Nkx2-5 or GATA-4
in sporadic CHD [39-41]. Therefore, our results with
ALDH1A2 mutations in TOF are consistent with the
emerging view that CHD is a highly heterogeneous disease that does not display a clear group of major genes
responsible for most cases.
Evidence for a functional importance of ALDH1A2
mutations in TOF
Several lines of evidence point towards the functional
consequences of the observed mutations. First, they are
very rare mutations, not present in any of the chromosomes from 150 normal individuals and only observed in
two single probands from more than 100 screened CHD
probands. Second, they lie in extremely conserved regions
of the protein, as shown in Figure 1. Third, structural
modeling of the mutated amino acids predicts severe
shifts in ALDH1A2 spatial conformation, with disruptive
influences in dimerization and tetramerization. The modeling strategy used in the present manuscript is robust.
Molecular mechanics simulation has advanced to the
point that it is possible to model mutations accurately,
providing direct structural tests of enzyme catalysis mod-

els [42]. Moreover, ALDH1 enzymes are extremely well
characterized from structural and functional standpoints
[36,43-45] and their substrate preferences have been accurately established [44]. This makes this class of enzymes
appropriate for structural modeling approaches that
extract insights into enzyme properties without the necessity for biochemical analyses. Finally, the phenotypes
associated with each of the two mutations that we
describe are tightly linked to mature structures that receive
critical contributions from embryonic tissues such as
conotruncal ridges, atrioventricular cushions and muscular interventricular septum, tissues which have been previously documented as major targets for imbalances
produced by genetic manipulation of the RA signaling
pathway [10,46].
Limited penetrance of ALDH1A2 mutations in TOF
The mutations that we described are present in unaffected
parents of the studied probands. The simplest explanation
for the lack of correlation between mutation and a cardiac
phenotype in the parents of probands is that the mutation
is not causally related to the phenotype. However, there
are multiple and well known alternative reasons why
mutations may not be associated with obvious cardiac
manifestations in parents. In addition to producing exuberant cardiac phenotypes such as hypoplastic ventricles,
large ventricular septal defects and double outlet right
ventricle, mice haploinsufficient for the key retinoic acid
receptor RXRalpha also display minor cardiac defects such
as cleft mitral or tricuspid valve, disorganized trabeculae
and displastic papillary muscles [10]. These subtle phenotypes may easily escape detection, either because they
were manifested only transiently during embryogenesis,
or because they are not enough to promote symptoms,
even if present in adults. It is also well known that defective RA signaling stemming from Aldh1a2 haploinsufficiency in mice can be expressed as non-cardiac alterations
such as vascular, laryngeal, tracheal, thymus and parathyroid defects [46]. Some of these non-cardiac defects are
subtle and will only be detected by specific diagnostic procedures. In addition, they may not have reached enough
physiological significance to be noticed at the time of
physical examination of parents. Thus, extra cardiac
defects may have gone unnoticed in parents and may not
have been deemed important in the familiar history.
Unfortunately, we were not able to screen other members
of these families, nor could we submit the non-penetrant
individuals, namely the father of the proband harboring
the Ala151Ser mutation, nor the mother of the proband
harboring the p.Ile157Thr mutation, to more detailed
phenotypic assessments such as trans-esophageal echocardiography, or multislice computed tomography, which
could have unveiled even some of the subtle phenotypes
mentioned above. In sum, the ALDH1A2 mutations that
we describe in TOF may not be fully penetrant. However,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/10/113

non-penetrance is not restricted to the mutations we
described, but is, rather, a common feature in most, if not
all, of the described genes that may cause CHD in humans
such as PTPN11 in Noonan Syndrome [47], KCNQ1 in
Long QT Syndrome [48] and troponin T in Familial
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [49].
Taken together, our data suggest that these rare mutations
display a concrete potential to disrupt activity of the
ALDH1A2 gene and contribute to the expression of congenital defects in CHD. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the
tentative nature of our conclusions and point out that further functional assays and reproduction of these mutations in the context of genetically modified animals (e.g.
knock-in mice) is required before any definitive conclusions can be reached.
Association between the ALDH1A2 Ile157Thr mutation,
TOF and Wilms Tumor
The complex phenotype displayed by the proband harboring the ALDH1A2 p.Ile157Thr mutation calls into
question the possibility that TOF in this patient was
caused by the same factor (s) underlying Wilms tumor disease. We believe this possibility is extremely unlikely.
CHD and, in particular, TOF, is an exceptionally rare component in the constellation of Wilms tumor manifestations [50], with only two cases of TOF associated with
Wilms tumor, but in the context of trisomy 18 [51,52].
Moreover, the vast majority of Wilms tumor cases are due
to somatic mutations and only a minority is due to germ
line mutations. Of germ line mutations, most are de novo
cases and only a minority of those is manifested in families [53]. Furthermore, neither TOF, nor other cardiac outflow tract malformations have been reported for WT-1null mice [54]. It is highly unlikely that the unilateral
Wilms tumor displayed by the proband harboring the
Ile157Thr is causally related to his TOF phenotype. We
believe that the most probable scenario is that a germ line
Aldh1a2 mutation is causally linked to TOF, while
somatic mutation (s) are responsible for the unilateral
Wilms tumor. Finally, it should be noted that no other
syndromic features were observed in this patient, and that
he did not present a clinical diagnosis compatible with
other conditions associated with childhood tumors and
congenital heart disease (i.e., Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome or the conditions associated with RAS/MAP kinase
pathway mutations).
Exon 4 as a hot spot for ALDH1A2 variants?
Our attention has been drawn by the fact that three out of
five exonic alterations that we found in the ALDH1A2
gene in CHD are concentrated in exon 4, which encodes
part of the tetramerization domain. The silent
p.Ala151Ala mutation (c.A453G transition) and the nonconservative p.Ala151Ser mutation map to the same cis-

tron, while the p.Ile157Thr is located only 6 cistrons
apart. As demonstrated in Figure 3, the p.Ala151Ser
impacts exon 4 splicing. p.Ala151Ser has a strong positive
effect upon exon 4 splicing, virtually eliminating mRNAs
that exclude exon 4, while p.Ala151Ala does not significantly decreases the ability to correctly splice exon 4.
These results suggest that exon 4 is normally controlled by
weak splicing signals and that it may be susceptible to
splicing mutations. The skipping of exon 4 has severe consequences for the protein. Besides losing 60% of the
tetramerization domain (23 amino acids), it introduces a
frame shift after Ala121, which creates 26 aberrant amino
acids followed by a termination codon that truncates the
protein (data not shown). In summary splicing alterations
involving exon 4 and the tetramerization domain are
bound to have significant effects on protein structure and
function.

nificant statistical power to detect effect sizes (odds ratio)
in the order of 2,0 to 3,0, depending on the tested allele
or haplotype (see Methods section).

Lack of association between the silent mutation
p.Ala151Ala (rs16939660) and CHD
Silent mutations have been reported to be associated and/
or to produce phenotypes through multiple mechanisms
such as: splicing effects, i.e. by disrupting splicing signals
(reviewed in [55], or by changing mRNA folding/structure
so as to induce conformational changes in the regions of
exonic splicing enhancers that interfere with splicing factor binding (reviewed in [56]; mRNA stability [57,58], or
due to the switch from common to rare codons, which
could, in principle, produce delays in protein synthesis
and changes in protein folding [59]. Therefore, the identification of a silent p.Ala151Ala mutation previously associated to spina bifida [24] in our group of TOF patients
prompted us to investigate the potential functional consequences of this mutation in splicing and in predicted
mRNA structure. We have shown that p.Ala151Ala is associated with a minor, non-significant reduction of exon 4
splicing and with a major predicted change in mRNA folding. Overall, we believe that those features of the
p.Ala151Ala silent mutation merit further investigation,
but that current evidence is not consistent with any sizeable functional effects in the specific context of CHD. Our
current interpretation is supported by our study with the
p.Ala151Ala mutation, which failed to provide evidence
for an association between this polymorphism and CHD.

Competing interests

Conclusion
Our screen indicates that non-conservative ALDH1A2
mutations are associated with rare cases of human CHD
and that ALDH1A2 polymorphisms (e.g. c.A453G) display functional differences in mRNA splicing and mRNA
half-life that merit further functional investigation in the
context of cell culture or genetically modified animals. In
conclusion, our screen is the first pass of a research program to probe the role of ALDH1A2 in human CHD.
While it represents a limited view of the CHD universe, it
is sufficient to cast doubts on any major role for the
ALDH1A2 gene as a determinant of CHD or as a modulator of its risk.
