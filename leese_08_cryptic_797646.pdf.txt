Abstract
Background: The Falkland Islands and Patagonia are traditionally assigned to the Magellan Biogeographic
Province. Most marine species in Falkland waters are also reported from southern Patagonia. It remains unclear
if relatively immobile, marine benthic, shallow-water species maintain gene flow, and by what mechanism.
Recurrent fluctuations in sea level during glacial cycles are regarded as a possible mechanism that might have
allowed genetic exchange between the regions. However, the realized genetic exchange between the Falkland
Islands and Patagonia has never been estimated.
Results: This study analyses the genetic structure of three populations of the marine shallow-water isopod Serolis
paradoxa (Fabricius, 1775) from the Falkland Islands and southern Patagonia (central Strait of Magellan and the
Atlantic opening) applying seven nuclear microsatellites and a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Both
marker systems report highest genetic diversity for the population from the central Strait of Magellan and lowest
for the Falkland Islands. The estimated effective population sizes were large for all populations studied. Significant
differentiation was observed among all three populations. The magnitude of differentiation between Patagonia and
the Falkland Islands (16S: uncorrected p-distance 2.1%; microsatellites: standardized F'ST > 0.86) was an order of
magnitude higher than between populations from within Patagonia. This indicates that there is currently no
effective gene flow for nominal S. paradoxa between these two regions and it has been absent for time exceeding
the last glacial maximum. We argue that specimens from the Strait of Magellan and the Falkland Islands very likely
represent two distinct species that separated in the mid-Pleistocene (about 1 MY BP).
Conclusion: The results of this study indicate limited gene flow between distant populations of the brooding
isopod Serolis paradoxa. The patterns of genetic diversity suggest that the only recently inundated Strait of
Magellan was colonized by different source populations, most likely from Atlantic and Pacific coastal waters. Our
results demonstrate that more systematic testing of shared faunal inventory and realized genetic exchange
between Patagonia and the Falkland Islands is needed before a consensus concerning the position of the Falkland
Islands relative to the Magellan zoogeographic province can be reached.

Background
Present-day distribution of a species is the result of a complex interplay between (1) extrinsic factors such as isolation of landmasses, climatic conditions and availability of
niches and (2) intrinsic factors such as dispersal capability
and physiological tolerance. Extrinsic factors typically
influence the distribution of many species in the same
way because they act on an ecosystem scale. Over time,
this leads to a characteristic assemblage of species with
similar distribution patterns within larger geographical
areas, so called biogeographic provinces, and distinct gaps
between them [1]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Magellan Biogeographic Province has obvious close ties to the
whole of South America to which it is connected today;
some of its species inventory, however, stems from times
before the Gondwana breakup [2,3]. The Falkland Islands
are connected to the South American shelf and located
approximately 500 km to the east of Patagonia (Figure 1).
Based on the current knowledge of their species inventory,
the Falkland Islands are commonly assigned to the Magellan Biogeographic Province [4-7], sometimes as a more
distinct 'subregion' of this province ([8] and references
therein). The geologic history of the Falkland Islands is

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/19

completely detached from continental South America as
the islands drifted to their current position on a microplate that originally formed part of the African continental
plate. Their current position was reached approximately
130 MY BP [9-11]. Close biogeographic ties between the
Falkland Islands and Patagonia are widely accepted and
even more plausible in the marine realm because here
biotic exchange does not depend on the existence of land
bridges [12-15]. Furthermore, major ocean current systems facilitate dispersal of specimens. This is generally
supported by elevated levels of gene flow among the few
species investigated so far in this region [16-19].
In this context, the relatively few reports of species
endemic to the Falkland Islands are not unexpected [8,2022]. On the whole, evidence from marine species supports
that the Falkland Islands form a part of the Atlantic Magellan Biogeographic Province and that migration of species between the continental South America and the
Falkland Island is occurring repeatedly. However, recent
molecular studies have shown that unrecognized cryptic
species may be more common than previously assumed
[15,17,23-33]. They indicate that morphological and eco-

logical similarity may be an unreliable piece of evidence
on which to base taxonomic identifications and, by extension, the definition of biogeographic provinces derived
from them.
In this study we investigate spatial partitioning of
intraspecific molecular polymorphisms in nominal Serolis
paradoxa (Fabricius, 1775), a marine benthic shallowwater isopod, using two independent genetic marker systems. S. paradoxa was originally described from the Falkland Islands but is also frequently reported from the Strait
of Magellan, the Patagonian coastal shelf (Atlantic and
Pacific side), and also from regions further to the equator
[5,20]. For the current taxonomic status and synonyms of
S. paradoxa see [3]. The vertical distribution of S. paradoxa
ranges from shallow waters (about 5 m, Held pers.
observ., Lopaz-Gappa pers. observ.) down to 113 m [34].
Although in the Magellan region S. paradoxa can be locally
very abundant [35] it is often encountered at medium
densities (about 1 ind/m2[36], Mutschke and Rios pers.
comm.). Like almost all isopods, S. paradoxa lacks freeswimming distribution stages and broods its offspring in
a ventral brood pouch, the marsupium, and is thus
expected to be limited in its dispersal capabilities. No
information on the life cycle and the duration of S. paradoxa are known. Based on significantly extended embryonic stages of Antarctic serolid isopods in comparison to
non-Antarctic isopods [37] it can be assumed that embryonic development, maturation and brooding of S. paradoxa from the cool-temperate regions, each stage lasts
several months. Altogether, S. paradoxa is expected to have
very limited dispersal capacity due to these factors.
Direct measurements of dispersal and migration over
large geographical distances provide a poor means of
assessing effective gene flow. The small number of immigrants needed per generation to appreciably change the
genetic structure of a population will not be picked up by
realistic sampling schemes. Indirect genetic estimates use
tools that interpret the genetic structure of a population as
a result of past genetic influx and thus represent an easier
and more reliable method [38]. However, in this context
historic extrinsic factors that may have exerted a structuring force must be considered when estimating present-day
population structure. One extrinsic factor known to have
had a major impact on genetic structure and distribution
of species are glaciation events [39]. Their influence on the
marine fauna is two-fold: large-scale glaciations may
directly render entire coastal habitats unavailable during
glacial maxima [40-42] and also lead to a decrease in sea
level of up to 130 m [41]. The latter may disrupt inshore
habitats on either side of an emerging barrier (e.g. appearance of the Panama land bridge [12], or connect shallow
water habitats that are disjunct during periods of high sea
level (additional file 1).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/19

The focus of the present study is the genetic structure of S.
paradoxa from the Falkland Islands and the Patagonian
shelf. The present-day situation suggests that the deeper
waters on the South American shelf may present an insurmountable barrier to S. paradoxa inhabiting shallow
waters around Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. Historically, the lower sea level during glacial maxima may have
connected both regions and facilitated migration between
habitats thus counteracting independent lineage sorting
in the two regions.
By investigating the coherence between gene pools and
construction of an approximate timeline, we test whether
the disruptive or unifying forces predominated and if the
influence of the last glaciations exerted a major influence
on the evolutionary history of S. paradoxa. We also test
whether the major age difference between marine habitats
in the central Strait of Magellan and around the Falkland
Islands (< 14 KY BP [43-50] and millions of years [51],
respectively) exerted a measurable influence on the genetics of populations living there today. In particular, we test
for differences in genetic diversity and patterns of recent
population expansions or secondary contact of colonizers
from the Atlantic and the Pacific side in central Magellan
Strait. We hypothesize that populations in the central
Strait of Magellan are genetically less diverse than populations from the coast or the Falkland Islands due to recent
range expansion into the Magellan Strait subsequent to
the retreat of the glaciers after the last glacial maximum
(LGM).

Materials and methods
Taxon sampling
Specimens from the Falkland Islands (FI) were collected
by dredging in shallow waters (< 20 m) near Port Stanley
from a Zodiac during the ICEFISH 2004 expedition. Specimens from the Strait of Magellan near Punta Arenas (PA)
were collected in January 1997 by CH SCUBA diving at
two neighbouring stations (500 m apart) and specimens
from the Atlantic opening of the Strait of Magellan (AO)
were provided from the 2nd Cruce Estrecho in 2003, by
Carlos Rios and Erika Mutschke, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Animals
were immediately preserved in 96% ethanol. Microsatellite analyses were performed for 35 specimens from PA,
33 from AO and 23 from FI. A subset of 27 specimens
from PA, 22 from AO and 22 from FI were analysed for
variation of the 3'-terminus of the mitochondrial 16S
rRNA gene.
DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing/genotyping
Total DNA was extracted from muscle tissue using the
Qiagen DNeasy Mini Kit according to the standard tissue
protocol. Only 100 μl of elution buffer were used to
increase DNA concentration.

Numbers of specimens studied using nuclear microsatellite markers (NMsat and mitochondrial markers (NmtDNA) of the populations of S. paradoxa
investigated in this study.

Microsatellites
Microsatellite markers Spa04, Spa12, Spa34, Spa35,
Spa39, Spa42 and Spa43 [32] were applied to assess
intraspecific genetic polymorphisms for all specimens
from the three sampling sites. Standard 15 μl reactions
consisted of 1× PCR HotMaster Buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs,
0.5–0.75 μM of each primer (one labelled, one unlabelled), 0.03 U/μl HotMaster Taq (Eppendorf, 5-Prime),
0.5 M Betaine (Sigma Aldrich) and 5–20 ng of genomic
DNA. Cycling conditions on an epgradient thermocycler
(Eppendorf) were 2 min at 94°C followed by 30 to 34
cycles with 20 s at 94°C, 15 s at annealing temperature, 30
s at 65°C. A final extension step of 45 minutes at 65°C
was performed to reduce in vitro artefacts due to incomplete adenylation of products [see [32] for details]. PCR
products were visualized on 2% TBE agarose gels, diluted
1–15 fold with molgrade water (CARL ROTH) and 1 μl of
the diluted product was denatured in a mixture of 14.7 μl
HI-DI formamide with 0.3 μl GeneScan ROX 500 size
standard (both Applied Biosystems). Allele length scoring
was performed using the software GENEMAPPER 4.0
(Applied Biosystems). To minimize genotyping errors
[52,53], up to four independent reactions were performed
on a subset of samples to estimate allele calling errors.
16S rDNA
The universal primers 16Sar and 16Sbr [54] were used for
amplification. Reactions were carried out in 25 μl volumes with 1× HotMaster reaction buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs,
0.5 μM of each primer, 0.025 U/μl HotMaster Taq (Eppendorf, 5-Prime). Reaction conditions were: Initial denaturation for 2 min at 94°C followed by 36 cycles of 20 s at
94°, 15 s at 46°C and 80 s at 65°C plus a final elongation
step of 5 min at 65°C. PCR products were purified using
Qiagen QIAquick or Eppendorf Perfectprep Gel cleanup
kits. Cycle-sequencing was performed in 10 μl reaction
volumes using 1 μM of either 16Sar or 16Sbr primer, 1 μl
of the purified template DNA and the BigDye Terminator
Kit 3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems) according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Reactions were
purified according to the 'modified protocol' of the Qiagen DyeEx Kit. Sequencing was conducted on an ABI
3130xl sequencer.

Data analysis
Microsatellites
Raw data were checked and corrected for genotyping
errors using the software MICRO-CHECKER version 2.2.3
[55] and DROPOUT version 1.3 [56]. In addition, MICROCHECKER was used to test for the presence of null alleles in
populations, i.e. alleles that fail to amplify due to substitutions in the primer binding regions. Corrected genotype
tables were converted to specific software formats using
the software MSTOOLKIT version 3.1 [57] and CONVERT version 1.3.1 [58]. The program ANIMALFARM version 1.0 [59]
was used to test for loci with significantly disproportionate variances that may bias allele-size based distance estimates such as Slatkin's or Rousset's RST estimates [60,61].
Tests for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage
disequilibrium (LD) were performed using GENEPOP version 4.0.6 [62]. Parameter settings: 10,000 dememorization steps, 50 batches, 20,000 MCMC sampling steps.
HWE tests aim at testing whether there is a statistically significant deviation of genotype frequencies from those
expected according to Mendelian inheritance. Linkage disequilibrium occurs when two genomic loci are not inherited independently, e.g. due to physical linkage or other
processes at population level hindering independent
recombination of loci.

To assess partitioning of genetic variability within individuals, subpopulations and regions, we performed hierarchical analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) using
ARLEQUIN version 3.11 [63]. Therefore, populations PA
and AO were assigned to one group, while FI constituted
the other group. In addition, single and multilocus
inbreeding coefficients (FIS) and pairwise population
coancestry coefficients (FST, similar to Weir and Cockerham's Theta) were estimated as in [64] using GENEPOP.
We also calculated pairwise allele-size based differentiation estimates, RST, according to [61] using GENEPOP. Significance was assessed by exact G tests as implemented in
GENEPOP. The interpretation of the FST values from multiallelic data is problematic because their maximum values
depend on the amount of within-population variation
and even in the absence of any shared allele often fail to
reach the theoretical maximum of 1 [65-67]. We therefore

applied a standardization approach suggested by Hedrick
[67] for calculations of GST and derived by Meirmans [68]
for Analysis of Variance frameworks (ANOVA).

culations of Ne and the confidence intervals (CI) were estimated considering alleles with a frequency of c ≥ 0.05 and
c ≥ 0.02 and ≥ 0.01, respectively.

The main principle of this standardization approach is to
correct the maximum possible value for FST as follows:
FST(max) is calculated using GENEPOP applying the sampling
bias correction suggested by Meirmans [68] using the Software RECODEDATA[68]. F'ST was subsequently calculated
by dividing FST by this inferred maximum value.

Tests for historical population bottlenecks were performed using the program BOTTLENECK[76]. Tests implemented in this program are based on the hypothesis that
populations that have experienced recent reductions in
their effective population size (Ne) show a reduction in
both allelic richness and heterozygosity. In populations
decreasing in size, the number of alleles (NA) drops faster
than heterozygosity [77] and therefore the observed heterozygosity is larger than the expected heterozygosity (HO >
HE). Conversely, in expanding populations often the
number of alleles increases faster than heterozygosity
until equilibrium is reached. From the comparison of
both parameters, allelic diversity and heterozygosity, it is
possible to make inferences regarding historical demography of a population. For each locus and population BOTTLENECK computes distribution of HE expected from the
observed NA, given the sample size (n) under the assumption of mutation-drift equilibrium. This distribution is
obtained through simulating the coalescent process of n
genes under the three possible mutation models, i.e. a)
the Infinite Allele Model (IAM), b) the Two-Phase Model
(TPM), c) the Stepwise-Mutation Model (SMM). As recommended by Cornuet and Luikart [78] we tested several
proportions of the SMM for the TPM (70–90%). Statistical
significance of the parameters were inferred applying a
Sign-test and a Wilcoxon-rank-test [76,78,79].

The standardized F'ST measure calculated range from 0
(populations equifrequent for all alleles) to 1 (populations fixed for different alleles) and therefore makes interpretation of the degree of subdivision much easier and
facilitates comparing results among studies.
In addition to these ANOVA based coancestry estimates
we performed individual assignment tests using the program STRUCTURE, version 2.2.2 [69] to investigate population subdivision. The advantage of the Bayesian clustering
algorithm of STRUCTURE is that no classification of populations has to be done a priori. Assuming HWE and no or
only weak LD within subpopulations, STRUCTURE assigns
individual genotypes probabilistically to populations and
calculates the likelihood of the genotype dataset for a
given number of populations (K), i.e. ln Pr (D|K) for K =
1 to K = n, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
[69,70]. For the S. paradoxa data set, the most likely
number of populations was inferred without making
assumptions on geographic origin of individuals. The
number of MCMC steps needed to reach convergence was
first estimated by comparing run lengths between 10,000
and 2,000,000 steps. Convergence was generally reached
with <5,000 steps. Therefore, for the parameter sets 10
independent runs with a burn-in of 5,000 and subsequent
100,000 MCMC steps were performed with and without
assuming recent admixture in the prior model, and considering alleles as correlated and uncorrelated. The
number of clusters (K) to infer was defined from K = 1 to
K = 4 to allow detection of potential cryptic subpopulations. Alpha was inferred from the data for each population separately. Results from 10 independent runs were
analysed in CLUMPP, version 1.1.1 [71] to compute a consensus membership coefficient Q-matrix from all 10 independent Q-matrices. Both the individual Q-matrix and
averaged population Q-matrix were visualized using
DISTRUCT, version 1.1 [72].
To assess estimates of the present effective population size
(Ne), we applied the linkage disequilibrium method proposed by Hill (1981) [73], modified by Waples [74] to
account for a bias correction when sample size is much
smaller than effective population size. This method is
implemented in the program LDNE, version 1.3 [75]. Cal-

16S rDNA
Assembly of forward and reverse strands and editing was
performed using the software SEQMAN (Dnastar, Lasergene) and GENEIOUS version 4.0.2 (Biomatters Ltd.).
Sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE version
3.6 [80]. The alignment required no manual correction
based on secondary structure information [81]. Sequence
variation was analyzed using MEGA 4.0 [82]. Gene diversity and nucleotide diversity according to Nei [83] and
Theta based on the number of segregating sites, Theta (S),
were calculated with ARLEQUIN version 3.11. Genetic differentiation between populations and between regions
[(PA + AO) vs. FI] were assessed using an FST and AMOVA
framework as implemented in ARLEQUIN. Assuming neutrality, evidence of a population expansion was tested
applying Tajima's D [84] and Fu's FS statistic [85] as
implemented in ARLEQUIN applying a coalescent simulation approach generating 10,000 selectively neutral samples for assessment of significance of results. A test for
sudden population expansion based on the pairwise mismatch distribution was calculated using ARLEQUIN and significance was assessed by 50,000 pseudo replicates.

A statistical parsimony network with a 95% connectionprobability limit was created for the 490-bp alignment
using TCS version 1.21 [86]. In addition, two outgroup
sequences of the serolid isopods Cuspidoserolis luethjei and
Cuspidoserolis johnstoni (GenBank accession numbers
AJ269802, AJ269803; see [24]) were aligned to the S. paradoxa sequences using MUSCLE, resulting in a 492-bp
alignment. This alignment was used to calculate a neighbor joining tree [87] with bootstrap support (1000 replicates) based on uncorrected p-distances using PAUP*
version 4b10 [88].
The coalescent-based MCMC approach implemented in
the software BEAST[89] was used to date the splitting event
between the different Serolis paradoxa lineages applying
both a strict and a relaxed molecular clock model. The
sequence model HKY85 was used for modelling sequence
evolution [90] together with a predefined mutation rate of
0.37% per million years [91], based on a molecular clock
for the serolid isopod Ceratoserolis trilobitoides. Dating
times and confidence intervals (CI) were filtered using
TRACER version 1.4 [92].

Results
Microsatellites
Seven microsatellite loci were analysed for three populations. All loci were highly polymorphic for all three populations (Table 2). The number of alleles per
microsatellite locus ranged from 6 to 23. The observed
heterozygosity ranged from 0.0 (Spa39, all specimens
homozygous for populations FI) to 0.886. Total heterozygosity was highest in PA, lower in AO and lowest in FI
(Table 2). Significant deviations from HWE were detected
for loci Spa04 and Spa39 (Table 2). Analyses with MICROCHECKER indicate that null alleles may be the cause for
inflated homozygosity for these loci. No significant global
LD was observed after sequential Bonferroni correction
[93]. Based on allele frequencies, the geographically intermediate population AO is clearly more similar to PA than
FI (additional file 2). The allele distribution of all microsatellite loci reveal strongly differing frequency spectra
with several private and almost fixed different allele patterns between regions (e.g. loci Spa04, Spa12, Spa35,
Spa43). Allele length spectra differ between populations
but overlap (additional file 2).

Results of ANIMALFARM confirmed that none of the loci
contributed disproportionally to distance-based differentiation estimates after Bonferroni or Sidak adjustment of
the significance level.

Inferring the most likely number of populations without

STRUCTURE identified only two very distinct clusters, which
correspond to the two major regions (AP+AO vs. FI; Figure

are correctly assigned to the two regions with admixture
proportions of 1.000 and 0.000, respectively. There was
no additional substructure within populations (PA, AO,

ther within-population structure. However, a large
proportion of variation is distributed among the major
geographical regions [(PA + AO) vs. FI] and only a minor
but nonetheless significant proportion between populations (Table 3). Strong differences between the two
regions were observed for allele frequency patterns at all
loci. In particular loci Spa04, Spa12 and Spa43 are nearly
fixed for different alleles in populations from the two
major regions [(PA, AO) vs. FI] (additional file 2) whereas
PA and AO reveal very similar allele frequency patterns.
The pronounced differences separating FI from Patagonia
are expressed by the high and significant pairwise FST and
RST estimates between population PA and FI and populations AO and FI (Table 4). Differentiation estimates were
even higher between populations AO and FI. In contrast,
FST estimates among populations PA and AO were low
albeit significant (P = 0.0005). RST estimates were lower
than FST estimates in this study and did not support significance differentiation between PA and AO (Table 4). In
general, RST is hypothesized to be larger if an appreciable
amount of differentiation between populations is not
only caused by drift but by independent mutations in the
different, isolated populations according to a stepwise
mutation model (SMM). Consequently, RST distance
measures are considered a 'memory' of past mutations
[60]. FST is superior to RST when populations have
diverged mostly by means of random genetic drift and
migration m (i.e. mutation rate << migration).

Estimating the present effective population sizes using the
LD approach [74], we consistently received negative Ne
estimates with confidence intervals ranging from negative
values to infinity, thus indicating very large population
sizes [75]. When testing for recent demographic contractions or expansions by looking for deviations from mutation-drift equilibrium under different mutation models
using BOTTLENECK we found a significant heterozygosity
deficiency under particular mutation models. For population AO there was a significant heterozygosity deficit
under both SMM and TPM models (additional file 3),
which provides strong evidence for recent population
expansion. For FI the evidence for recent population
expansion was somewhat weaker: a significant heterozygosity deficit was detected only using the SMM and the
Wilcoxon test (P = 0.0195, additional file 3). Thus results
of BOTTLENECK do not provide evidence for a similarly
drastic decline and subsequent recovery in population
size for PA. For population AO under a TPM and a strict
SMM, the significant excess of heterozygosity may indicate that this population is expanding presently. Although
the evolutionary dynamics of microsatellites are not fully
understood [94,95] it is commonly accepted that the IAM
model is not an appropriate descriptor of the mutational
dynamics of microsatellite markers and hence that its
application often leads to unrealistic conclusions.

branch (8 segregating sites, Figure 3). None of the haplotypes was shared among specimens from different
regions. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that specimens
from both regions form two reciprocally monophyletic
clades each supported by high bootstrap values (Figure 4).
The average uncorrected pairwise distance between both
groups was 2.1% (1.7% for transitions; 0.4% for transversions). Variation within groups was an order of magnitude lower (0.3% among FI and 0.4% among PA and AO;
Figure 4). These values are amongst the lower values
observed between reproductively isolated species of
serolid isopods and other crustaceans [24,26-28,31]. This
dominant partitioning of genetic diversity by regions was
supported by high and highly significant (P < 0.001) values for pairwise population differentiation (FST) between
populations from both regions: PA:FI FST = 0.95; AO:FI,
FST = 0.97). The results of the AMOVA indicate that
90.48% of the total variance is partitioned between the
two regions [(PA and AO) vs. (FI)], corresponding to a
high value of ΦCT = 0.905 (Table 6). However, a lower but
highly significant proportion of total variance was also
distributed between populations AO and PA (4.70%),
corresponding to the value of ΦSC of -0.494. Pairwise differentiation estimates support that gene flow is also
restricted within the Strait of Magellan (PA:AO FST = 0.45;
P < 0.001).

In summary, the results from the microsatellite analyses
provide evidence for moderate differentiation between
the two Patagonian populations and very strong subdivision between populations from Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. Genetic diversity was highest in the center of
the Strait of Magellan, lower near its opening towards the
Atlantic Ocean and lowest around the Falkland Islands.
All populations showed a significant heterozygosity deficit corroborated by high FIS values (Table 2) which may be
indicative for inbreeding of local populations.

Nucleotide diversity and gene diversity were highest for
population PA, lower for AO and lowest for FI (Table 7).
Estimates of Theta (S) were also higher for PA than for AO
and FI (Table 7). Tajima's D and Fu's Fs were negative and
significantly different from zero for FI, and for Fu's Fs only
for population AO (Table 7). Recent population expansions are frequently associated with negative values of D
and Fs because under these circumstances mutation generates more and closely related haplotypes than are eliminated by genetic drift. It should be considered that
according to Fu [85] a significance level of 5% corresponds to P = 0.02, thus Fu's Fs for population AO is not
significant. The mismatch analyses could not the reject the
assumptions of sudden population expansion for all populations (additional file 4). In summary, there is a
stronger signature for population expansion in AO and FI
than in PA based on the 16S rDNA data.

16S rDNA
We sequenced a 490 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene for
a subset of 27 specimens from population PA, 22 from AO
and 22 from FI (Table 1) to test whether the strong pattern
of differentiation inferred using fast evolving microsatellites is also traceable with a slower evolving gene. The
amplified fragment was AT-rich as typical for this gene (A
39.3%, C 13.1%, G 14.0%, T 33.6%; [54]). Of the seventeen polymorphic positions, ten were parsimony informative and seven represented singletons. Substitutions were
located only in loop regions of the rRNA gene fragment
(folding model: Drosophila melanogaster 16S rRNA, [81]).
Eleven haplotypes were characterized (HT1-HT11, Table
5). The statistical parsimony network constructed is characterized by two shallow subnetworks (≤ 4 segregating
sites) representing the Patagonian vs. the Falkland Islands
populations, which are connected by a long internal

Dating of the time to the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) between both S. paradoxa lineages using a strict
molecular clock for the mutation rate differed for the two
monophyletic lineages. For the Patagonian taxa as
ingroup the tMRCA inferred was 0.948 MY (5% CI 0.344
MY, 95% CI 1.658 MY) and for the Falkland Islands lineage 0.643 MY (5% CI 0.136 MY, 95% CI 1.207 MY). Thus,
from both inferences, evidence for a splitting event in the
mid-Pleistocene is supported.

Discussion
The genetic variability within the nominal species Serolis
paradoxa turned out to have extensive spatial structure.
The differences in mutation rates and coalescent dynamics
of the two marker systems help describe present-day population structure and reconstruct historical demographic
processes.
Two genetically distinct lineages
There is strong evidence of divergence between populations from Patagonia and the Falkland Islands, supported
by microsatellite and mitochondrial data. The dominant
feature of the intraspecific variability of mitochondrial
DNA data for the Patagonian populations (PA and AO)
and the Falkland Island population is that populations
form two shallow subnetworks, corresponding to the two
geographic regions. The nuclear microsatellite markers
support the geographic partitioning of variation with high
and significant FST, RST differentiation values and strong
support from Bayesian cluster analyses (Figure 2).

The geographic positions of our sampling locations along
an East-West axis might suggest testing for isolation by
distance effects (IBD). However, in the context of this
study, the IBD is an inappropriate method and it is

unlikely that this would become more meaningful even if
more intermediate sampling locations were available.
This is because the central Strait of Magellan became available for (re)colonization only very recently, approximately 9–14 KY BP [46,48]. This rapid range expansion is
typically accompanied by loss of alleles and an excess of
homozygosity [96] which violates a mutation-drift equilibrium assumed by the IBD model. Investigating distance
effects on the distribution of intraspecific variance inside
the Magellan Strait offers a means to trace the recolonization of this young habitat and would be appropriate for
IBD but this requires more fine-scaled sampling and is
outside the scope of this paper.
Absence of effective gene flow between the Falkland
Islands and Patagonia is strongly suggested by nearly fixed
population specific differences in fast evolving microsatellites and the perfect congruence of haplotype identity and
geography for the 16S rDNA data. The long branch connecting the two groups of haplotypes (Figure 3) and their
reciprocal monophyly (Figure 4) indicates complete lineage sorting in both groups. The magnitude of genetic differentiation between 16S genotypes is on the order of
magnitude known for reproductively isolated species [2628,97]. Speciation ultimately involves the irreversible dis-

expectations of two independently evolving lineages. The
patterns and magnitude of the remaining differences do
not suggest the presence of additional cryptic species
inside (PA and AO) vs. (FI), they indicate, however, that
gene flow is restricted even within the Strait of Magellan.
The congruence between both marker systems supports
that the 16S rRNA gene tree reflects the species tree rather
than being a result of shared ancestral polymorphisms
[99] or other processes affecting mitochondrial genes (see
[100] for review).
Evolutionary history of nominal Serolis paradoxa
Southern Hemisphere glaciations differently affected both
regions: The Falkland Islands were little affected by glacial
advances [51], thus S. paradoxa was able to survive by following the rising and falling sea levels. In Patagonia, however, major parts of today's distribution of nominal S.
paradoxa became unavailable due to ice coverage and/or
low sea levels. Western Patagonia was covered by a contiguous ice shield similar to the Antarctic Peninsula today

(2 populations from the Strait of Magellan, one population from the Falkland Islands)

and the central Strait of Magellan was inundated only
after the LGM, approximately 14-9 KY BP [46]. Contrary
to the situation around the Falkland Islands where S. paradoxa was presumably continuously present over evolutionary times, this species was forced to immigrate into
the Strait of Magellan only recently after the retreat of the
glaciers. Surprisingly, genetic diversity estimates for population PA from central Magellan Strait (Table 7) indicate
that the population has the highest genetic diversity and
shows almost no signs for recent population expansion
(Table 7, additional file 3, 4), although colonization of a
new habitat is often accompanied by a loss of genetic
diversity (founder event). In comparison, population FI is
less diverse for the 16S rDNA with one dominant haplotype only (HT7) and reveals strong evidence for recent
population expansion. Diversity estimates decline from
population PA in the west to population FI in the east,
which seems counterintuitive as the effects of past glaciations are likely to have been much more severe for PA than
for AO and FI. This apparent contradiction may, however,
be explained by the fact that the Magellan Strait was recolonized after the LGM not only from the Atlantic but also
the Pacific side, thus receiving allelic diversity from different source populations. In the contact zone in the central
Magellan Strait, this scenario explains the inflated genetic
diversity estimates for PA.
In summary, our data are in agreement with the following
scenario: Populations of an ancestral species were separated geographically and evolved in allopatry (Falkland
Islands vs. Pacific and Atlantic side of Patagonia). Applying a rate for the accumulation of substitutions in 16S
rDNA estimated by Held [91] for the serolid isopod Ceratoserolis trilobitoides (Eights, 1833) with a rate of 0.37% per
MY for transitions and transversions, the time of diver-

gence was estimated to have occurred several hundreds of
thousands of years before present. Thus the initial separation of lineages predates the last glaciations and took
place in mid-Pleistocene (average estimates 0.643 – 0.948
BP). In view of the strong genomic signatures of differentiation between Patagonia and the Falkland Islands we
must therefore reject the hypothesis that low sea levels
during glacial periods led to significantly elevated levels of
gene flow between populations of S. paradoxa due to
greater proximity of shallow-water habitats. A similar
argument applies to potential migration between Patagonia and the Falkland Islands via passive rafting on drifting
substrates. Although there are major directional ocean
currents that frequently transport substrates suitable for
transportation of even rather immobile species [101-103]
this apparently played no role in the recent evolutionary
history of S. paradoxa. This species exclusively inhabits
soft-bottom shallow waters and is frequently half-buried
in the sediment (Held pers. observ.). Its capability to colonize new island habitats and maintain genetic continuity
across barriers to dispersal and over evolutionary times is
therefore small. Further sampling effort should focus on
sampling specimens from the West Falkland Islands. It
cannot be excluded that members of both lineages live in
sympatry today.
Reliability and systematic bias in differentiation estimates
The equilibrium FST estimate for totally isolated populations based on microsatellites can reach the maximum
value of FST = 1 only theoretically. Due to the high mutation rate of microsatellites [94,104,105] and often a
restricted allelic spectrum ([106], but see [107]), the intrapopulation variability is generally very high in particular
after a long time of independent evolution of large populations. Applying Meirman's standardization approach for

pairwise FST, differentiation between PA and FI is 0.86,
between AO and FI 0.91 and among the Magellan Strait
populations PA and AO 0.063 and thus about three times
larger than without this correction. These values underpin
that populations from Patagonia and the Falkland Islands
are almost fixed for different alleles at the seven loci investigated. The results point out the importance of the
recently introduced standardization approach [67,68] in
order to allow for easier comparison and interpretation of
the data. Differentiation estimates of the 16S rDNA yield
comparable results. Differentiation was significant
between all three populations. Although populations AO
and PA shared the most common haplotypes, FST estimates between PA and AO revealed much higher differentiation than inferred using microsatellite data. The most
plausible explanation is that the fourfold smaller effective
population size of mitochondrial DNA [108] lead to
much stronger effects of genetic drift, resulting in higher
differentiation estimates.
In principle, differentiation estimates can also be biased
due to comparing samples obtained in different years (PA:
1997, AO: 2003, FI: 2004). However, as only few years,
corresponding to even fewer generations of S. paradoxa,
separate the samples and no major disturbances in the
regions were reported for the time in-between the samplings. Thus, we regard this a negligible issue.
Concerning the dating of the split between the two lineages, it must be stated that genetic distances between two
lineages increase much faster than predicted by molecular
clocks if populations experience population bottlenecks
[65]. Thus, the realistic tMRCA between the two lineages
might be shorter than the estimated mean using the
molecular clock. In addition, it is not entirely certain if the
molecular clock can be applied to S. paradoxa. The time
estimates are based on 16S rRNA substitution rates commonly used for other Crustacea [97].
Taxonomic and conservation status of the newly delimited
species
The genetic data strongly suggest that nominal Serolis paradoxa (Fabricius, 1775) consists of two reproductively isolated species one of which occurs in Patagonia while the
other is presumably confined to shallow waters around
the Falkland Islands. As the type was originally described
by Fabricius as Oniscus paradoxum Fabricius, 1775 from
the Falkland Island the species from Patagonia is in need
of formal description and a scientific name.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/19

species contained inside nominal Serolis paradoxa imply
that both are highly abundant and neither needs to be
considered endangered.

Conclusion
In summary, our data prove low but significant differentiation among populations within the Strait of Magellan
and the absence of effective gene flow among populations
from the Strait of Magellan and the Falkland Islands. In
fact, specimens from both regions belong to two cryptic
lineages that probably diverged in the mid-Pleistocene
and may already represent reproductively isolated species.
The 16S rDNA data supports a genetically rich central
Strait of Magellan population, an intermediate population near the Atlantic opening of the Strait of Magellan
and a genetically depauperate Falkland Island population.
The results are in line with the expectations of colonization of the central Strait of Magellan from both sides of
Patagonia after the last glacial maximum approximately
9-14 KY after deglaciation of the habitat and rise of sea
levels.
While the fauna of the Falkland Islands has often been
accepted to share most of their faunal inventory with Patagonia our results indicate that shallow water species with
low mobility may in fact be strongly differentiated populations of one species or even reproductively isolated species.
