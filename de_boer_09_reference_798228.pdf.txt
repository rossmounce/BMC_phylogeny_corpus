Abstract
Background: Genomic studies measuring transcriptional responses to changing environments and
stress currently make their way into the field of evolutionary ecology and ecotoxicology. To
investigate a small to medium number of genes or to confirm large scale microarray studies,
Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR (QRT-PCR) can achieve high accuracy of quantification
when key standards, such as normalization, are carefully set. In this study, we validated potential
reference genes for their use as endogenous controls under different chemical and physical stresses
in two species of soil-living Collembola, Folsomia candida and Orchesella cincta. Treatments for F.
candida were cadmium exposure, phenanthrene exposure, desiccation, heat shock and pH stress,
and for O. cincta cadmium, desiccation, heat shock and starvation.
Results: Eight potential reference genes for F. candida and seven for O. cincta were ranked by their
stability per stress factor using the programs geNorm and Normfinder. For F. candida the succinate
dehydrogenase (SDHA) and eukaryotic transcription initiation factor 1A (ETIF) genes were found
the most stable over the different treatments, while for O. cincta, the beta actin (ACTb) and tyrosine
3-monooxygenase (YWHAZ) genes were the most stable.
Conclusion: We present a panel of reference genes for two emerging ecological genomic model
species tested under a variety of treatments. Within each species, different treatments resulted in
differences in the top stable reference genes. Moreover, the two species differed in suitable
reference genes even when exposed to similar stresses. This might be attributed to dissimilarity of
physiology. It is vital to rigorously test a panel of reference genes for each species and treatment,
in advance of relative quantification of QRT-PCR gene expression measurements.

Background
Genomic techniques have undergone major developments in the last two decades. As a result, they have
become conducive for evolutionary and ecotoxicological
studies, which generally use non genomic-model organisms. Quantitative Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase
Chain Reaction (QRT-PCR) is a technique to estimate
gene expression levels. This technique is often used to
confirm high throughput systems like microarrays. Its
application has mainly been limited to small numbers of
genes per experiment due to constraints of low throughput coinciding with relatively high costs per assay. This is
about to change, as high throughput QRT-PCR systems
using small volume (capillary) PCR are becoming available [1]. QRT-PCR is a valuable tool for ecological studies
as it provides a relatively straightforward way to measure
the direct transcriptional response of an organism
exposed to different treatments [2]. QRT-PCR has been
applied to study adaptive evolution at the transcriptional
level [3-6]. For instance, Roelofs et al. [7] conducted a
QRT-PCR study to assess the relevance of transcriptional
regulation in the adaptive evolution of stress tolerance.
The conditions that have to be met for a successful QRTPCR experiment are reviewed by Bustin [8]. Different
strategies have been developed for quantifying gene
expression with QRT-PCR data. The most widely used
method is to quantify the relative amount of target mRNA
between samples, using for instance the comparative CT
(2-ΔΔCT) method [9], or the more comprehensive Pfaffl
method where relative quantities are adjusted for amplification efficiencies. Relative quantification methods
depend on reference genes for normalization [10]. QRTPCR reference genes, sometimes called 'housekeeping'
genes, can either be internal, when measured in the same
reaction tube as the target gene, or external, when measured in a different reaction tube. The use of reference
genes is necessary to correct for factors such as RNA input
differences and reverse transcriptase efficiency variation
[11].
An essential requirement for QRT-PCR reference genes is
stability of their transcriptional level across the various
conditions to which an organism is exposed during an
experiment. Classically, the most used reference genes are
carry-overs from the Northern-blot days [12] such as beta
actin
(ACTb),
glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) and ribosomal RNA genes (18S, 28S). Unfortunately, these classical reference genes are not always found
to be suitable for this use. For example, mRNA levels of
ACTb and GAPDH can fluctuate widely in human T-cells
exposed to different treatments [13]. Also, commonly
used housekeeping genes like ACTb, GAPDH, cyclophilin
A (CYP) and 28S are up or down regulated in cell lines
exposed to hypoxia stress [14]. Therefore, it is vital to val-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/54

idate the stability of a panel of reference genes in order to
select the most suitable ones for each new treatment and
species of choice.
Currently two Visual Basic Applications for Microsoft
Excel are widely used to determine reference gene suitability: geNorm [15] and Normfinder [16]. GeNorm is based
on the principle that the expression ratio of two ideal control genes should be identical in all samples and experimental conditions. It calculates gene expression stability
(M), which is the mean pair-wise variation between an
individual gene and all other tested reference genes. Subsequently, the least stable reference gene (highest M
value) is excluded from the set and the calculation is reiterated until the two most stable reference genes remain.
Normfinder [16] estimates intergroup and intragroup variation to calculate reference gene stability and to rank
them. As with geNorm it calculates a stability value for
each potential reference gene but it uses a variance model
based approach (mixed linear effect modeling), instead of
the reiterative approach used by geNorm. Normfinder calculates intragroup variability for the genes in each of the
groups, and the intergroup variability or bias among the
groups [17]. Since the program can differentiate between
groups, Normfinder is best suited when the stability of reference genes needs to be assessed over multiple treatments. When reference gene stability only needs to be
calculated for samples exposed to a single treatment the
two methods are similar and should give the same results
[16].
In this paper we develop a panel of reference genes for two
species of springtails (Collembola), and study their stability across various treatments. Collembola are important
model organisms in evolutionary ecology and ecotoxicological studies. The soil-dwelling collembolan Folsomia
candida is a standard test animal used in a soil pollution
test that is certified by the International Organization for
Standardization [18]. Its parthenogenetic mode of reproduction and the availability of a recently sequenced
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database, make F. candida
also a proper test animal for genomic studies on the
effects of soil pollution [19-21]. An F. candida microarray
is currently in use for testing soil toxicants [22] and physical conditions (Timmermans et al., unpubl. data; De Boer
et al., unpubl. data). Therefore, confirmation of microarray results by QRT-PCR is abound. Orchesella cincta is a
sexually reproducing collembolan that lives in the litter
layer rather than in the soil and is generally used to study
adaptation and phenotypic plasticity [23,24]. Furthermore, it is an emerging genomic model to study adaptive
evolution in polluted environments [20,21,25].
Here we study the stability of potential QRT-PCR reference genes across various treatments. We exposed the two

collembolan species to several stressors (F. candida: cadmium, phenanthrene, desiccation, temperature and pH
stress. O. cincta: cadmium, desiccation, temperature stress
and starvation) that are currently under investigation in
gene expression studies. Based on previous studies (e.g.
[12,26]), a panel of potential QRT-PCR reference genes
was developed (Table 1) using the Collembola EST database Collembase http://www.collembase.org[20]. In
addition, a target gene (expected to be differential) was
measured for each treatment, to validate the impact of the
treatment at the transcriptional level of the organism. The
stability of the potential reference genes was determined
using both geNorm and Normfinder.

Results
Expression levels under different conditions
Average cycle threshold (Ct) values varied widely between
conditions and treatments, and ranged between 9.7 (28S,
O. cincta) and 28.6 (CYP, F. candida, see Additional file 1
for an overview). An example of the different expression
levels in treatments and conditions is given in Figure 1 for
ACTb and the differential metallothionein gene (MT) of
O. cincta.

In O. cincta, the target gene MT showed a 7 fold up regulation (FR) in the cadmium treatment (P < 0.05) and

HSP70 was 5 fold up regulated after heat shock (P <
0.001). Starvation and desiccation treatments showed no
significant changes in either of the two target genes,
implying that those treatments had fairly small effects, at
least on the transcriptional response of these two genes. In
F. candida, all but one treatment showed a significant
effect on the target genes (cadmium: mitochondrial chaperone BCS-1 (BCS1), FR = 20, P < 0.0001; phenanthrene:
BCS1, FR = 6.4, P = 0.001; temperature: HSP70, FR > 2, P
< 0.001 (for all conditions); desiccation: Cuticle protein
(CP), FR = 4, P < 0.05). The pH treatment showed no significant differences in the target V-type ATPase (ATPase);
in fact the ATPase gene used in the pH treatment was more
stable than most reference genes, again implying that this
treatment had only a modest effect on the transcriptional
level of this gene.
Ranking of the reference genes
Stability rankings were established using geNorm and
Normfinder. As described in the methods section, the
Normfinder analysis should be executed with genes that
show no substantial treatment-specific response [17].
Therefore, differential genes were excluded in most cases
as well as some of the other genes that showed a systematic response to the treatment (see Table 2 for an overview).

Figure 1 of 2 genes from Orchesella cincta exposed to the different treatments
Ct values
Ct values of 2 genes from Orchesella cincta exposed to the different treatments. Average Ct values between the
biological replicates of the beta actin (ACTb) and metallothionein (MT) genes from Orchesella cincta exposed to the cadmium,
desiccation, starvation and temperature treatments. Exp stands for the exposed group, contr for the control group. 0, 10 and
35 in the temperature treatment stand for the different temperatures (in °C) the animals were exposed to.

The stability rankings generated by geNorm or
Normfinder were largely similar, even though the ranking
order of the genes differed to some extent. An overview of
which genes to use for each treatment is found in Table 3.
From the three treatments tested for both species, only the
cadmium treatment gave similar results between F. candida (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (YWHAZ), succinate
dehydrogenase (SDHA) and GAPDH) and O. cincta
(alpha-tubulin (TBa) – not tested in F. candida – SDHA
and YWHAZ). To compare interspecies parallels, an additional geNorm analysis was done including only the reference genes available for both species (see Additional file
2). This did not change the fact that most rankings did not
correspond between species. In F. candida, overall analyses show the same outcomes for the cadmium treatment
and the phenanthrene treatment: YWHAZ, SDHA,
GAPDH. For the temperature and desiccation treatments
(F. candida) results also overlapped with SDHA ETIF and
elongation factor 1α (EF1a) being the best suited reference genes. The results for O. cincta seem to be quite variable. The commonly used reference gene ACTb is placed in
all top rankings, but not in the cadmium treatment. 28S,
a well known but also controversial reference gene to use,
showed a high stability in the temperature treatment. Also
remarkable is the stability of HSP70, expected to be differential, in the desiccation and starvation treatments. This
result has been reported previously for Drosophila mela-

nogaster, which did not show an increase in HSP70Aa
mRNA levels in response to starvation and desiccation
[27]. Despite the fact that the ranking of reference genes
shows no typical overall uniformity over all different
treatments, the most generally applicable reference genes
are suggested to be: ACTb, YWHAZ and TBa for O. cincta
and SDHA, ETIF and YWHAZ for F. candida.
Optimum number of reference genes
The optimum numbers of reference genes are shown in
Table 3. In only two out of nine treatments the two methods agreed on the number of genes to use for normalization (two genes in these cases). However, in nearly all
cases either geNorm or Normfinder recommended the use
of two reference genes. Comparing the two sets proposed
by either program, the differences in significance levels
and relative expression levels of a differential gene were
found to be very small.
Effect of method of normalization on relative expression
of HSP70
We selected the temperature treatment with the differential HSP70 to illustrate the effects of reference gene selection on the calculated relative expression level of a gene of
interest. This treatment was chosen because there were
four different conditions and HSP70 expression clearly
responded differently to each of these conditions.

Pre-selection of genes prior to Normfinder analysis based on a threshold for maximum allowable bias of 0.13 times the standard deviation of the
total absolute bias of a treatment. For each treatment, bias thresholds are given as well as the corresponding omitted and remaining genes and their
absolute total biases per treatment (total RNA input was only included in the All treatment analysis for Orchesella cincta).

We normalized HSP70 expression in the F. candida temperature treatment with four different sets of reference
genes: i) only with a commonly used single reference gene
(ACTb); ii) with the appropriate number of selected genes
according to the geNorm and iii) the Normfinder analysis
and iv) with all available reference genes in the F. candida
temperature dataset. Each set of reference genes showed
significant upregulation of HSP70 expression in the animals exposed to 0°C and 30°C as compared to those
exposed to 10°C and 20°C (P < 0.05), as well as a significant difference between 10°C and 20°C (Figure 2). However, the difference in HSP70 expression between 0°C and
30°C was only significant when using the reference genes
proposed by the geNorm and Normfinder analysis. This
indicates that selection of reference genes can influence

the resolution with which differences in gene expression
between two samples can be detected.
Ranking O. cincta reference genes over all treatments
Making comparisons between experiments is difficult
when no standardization of reaction conditions has taken
place [28]. Reverse transcription is the most crucial step in
the introduction of technical sampling variation in the
QRT-PCR procedure [29]. In the O. cincta dataset we
attempted to meet the standards needed for a multi-treatment analysis, which allowed us to analyze the whole O.
cincta dataset similarly to the single treatment analyses
using Normfinder. We also included a non-normalized
situation ('total RNA input') which was equal for all samples. The differential MT was omitted from ranking due to

than Normfinder, both algorithms produced the same top

and YWHAZ.

Discussion and Conclusion
In this study we identified appropriate reference genes of
two collembolan species that show invariant expression
across experimental treatments. The most important
result of our study is the lack of similarity in stability of
genes i) within the species upon exposure to different
treatments, and ii) between species that have undergone
similar treatments. The two collembolan species have a
distinct physiology and ecology, but they belong to phylogenetically related families [30]. An earlier study on two
flatfish species with a comparable phylogenetic relatedness as the two collembolan species used here, found congruent results in reference gene stabilities between the two
species [31]. In our study, differences were most pronounced in the temperature and desiccation treatments,
while the cadmium treatments show a greater congruency
between species. It may be argued that the physiological
response to xenobiotic stress is more similar in the two
species than responses to the environmental factors. Still,

experimental methods also differed between species and
therefore it cannot be excluded that part of the observed
interspecific differences was due to differences in experimental set-up.
Previously, it has been suggested that the results of reference gene selection studies might serve as a resource for
future gene expression studies in the same or related species [31,32]. Indeed, some genes were stable across different treatments. ACTb and YWHAZ were the dominant
genes found in the top of the rankings of three out of four
O. cincta treatments, but this general pattern did not hold
up for ACTb in the cadmium treatment and YWHAZ in the
desiccation treatment. In F. candida, the two chemical
treatments (cadmium and phenanthrene) and the environmental treatments (temperature, desiccation and pHstress) differed in selected reference genes, indicating that
different classes of physiological responses, for instance
detoxification and acclimation, can be expected to cause
fluctuations in different 'housekeeping' genes to maintain
cellular homeostasis. Therefore one cannot assume that
two species responding similarly to a certain treatment
will also respond in a similar way to another treatment. In
addition, differences in priming strategy and QRT-PCR
assay characteristics can also introduce variation in stability comparisons. In the light of our present results we

Hypothetically, this differential gene should be the most
unstable gene in the dataset. In both our species and all
treatments (except for the pH treatment) at least one of
the selected differential genes was indeed the most variable of the set tested. This provides evidence that the
applied treatments caused an effect at the transcriptional
level, which strengthens the validation of the reference
genes that remained stable under the changed regimes.
The only exception was observed for the pH treatment,
where the pre-selected differential gene was positioned
among the housekeeping genes. Most likely, the treatment
may not have been severe enough or it may indicate that
some exposure types do not initiate an effect on the transcriptional level.

HSP70
HSP70 expression of Folsomia candida in the temperature treatment normalized with four different sets of
reference genes. HSP70 expression between different
pools of F. candida exposed to different temperatures, normalized with four different sets of reference genes (ACTb:
only beta-actin; the best set selected by geNorm (SDHA
&ETIF); the best set selected by Normfinder (ETIF, SDHA,
EF1a &UBC) and all available reference genes). One-way
ANOVA analysis with Bonferroni post-hoc test revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) between 0, 10 and 20°C and
between 10, 20 and 30°C in all normalization sets. Significant
differences between 0 and 30°C were only detected when
normalized with the optimum sets of reference genes
selected by either geNorm or Normfinder. The letters above
the bars indicate significant differences where different letters between bars represent a significant difference within 1
normalization set.

must caution against the use of literature data from related
species to select a normalization standard, unless careful
notion is taken of the parallels and differences in the technical context of the experiment as well as the internal
processes of the organisms that are being studied.
Optimizing a set of reference genes not only requires making the right choice of genes, it also implies choosing the
right number of genes. The difference in calculated levels
of HSP70 expression, using different sets of reference
genes, exemplifies the importance of the number of reference genes used. Resolution was too low to detect small
differences in expression, when either a single reference
gene was used for normalization or when all available reference genes were included. In fact the small difference
between 0°C and 30°C was only statistically significant
when normalization was done with the sets proposed by
geNorm and Normfinder.
In the geNorm analysis, inclusion of a differential gene
gives insight into the variability of all other genes [15].

Normfinder performs relative comparisons between the
potential reference genes; hence this method is more sensitive to the presence of differentially expressed genes in
the dataset than geNorm. In this study, we set a threshold
for the maximal allowable bias at 0.13 times the standard
deviation of the treatments' intergroup variation as calculated with Normfinder. After the pre-selection, the reference genes selected by geNorm and Normfinder were
remarkably similar. In all treatments, except for the F. candida pH treatment and the O. cincta starvation treatment,
the top three consisted of the same three genes even
though the order differed.
QRT-PCR has proven its value in many areas of genetic
and genomic research. Knowledge on genetic pathways
and molecular responses to external environmental cues
and chemical factors now also make a significant contribution to evolutionary ecology and ecotoxicology. Experiments in these scientific disciplines often focus on nonmodel organisms, such as Collembola, and routinely use
large sample sizes. Now that high-throughput systems
QRT-PCR are becoming available [1], the technique will
become even more valuable for molecular ecological
research. The reference genes presented in this study can
therefore act as a starting point for scientists who use identical collembolan species for ecological, evolutionary and
ecotoxicological research. Nonetheless, as previously
stated by Stürzenbaum and Kille [33], it should always be
kept in mind that techniqually successful QRT-PCR
depends not only on the genes of interest alone, and
therefore reference genes should be carefully validated
prior to experimentation.

Methods
Collembola cultures
Folsomia candida was kept in plastic containers with a
water-saturated plaster of Paris bottom containing 10%
charcoal at 20°C in a 12:12 light dark regime. The animals
were fed dried baker's yeast (Dr. Oetker) ad libitum. For
all experiments animals of at least 20 days old were used.

Orchesella cincta was held comparably, but fed algae
(Desmococcus sp) growing on twigs of pine trees. For all
the experiments animals of 4–5 weeks old were used, with
a maximum age difference of seven days.
Folsomia candida treatments
pH & temperature treatment
Animals of 20 days old were exposed in 100 ml jars with
30 grams of OECD artificial soil. OECD soil pH was
adjusted with CaCO3 (J.T. Baker) to four different values
(3.5, 4.5, 5.5 & 6.5) according to OECD guideline 207
[34]. Pools of thirty animals per jar were exposed to the
different pH values for three days at 75% humidity and
20°C. For the temperature treatment OECD soil at a pH
of 5.5 was used. Pools of thirty animals per jar were
exposed to 0, 10, 20 and 30°C for 3 days. For each condition two biological replicates were used (separately) for
RNA extraction.
Desiccation treatment
Drought exposure was performed as described by Bayley
and Holmstrup [35]. Per replicate, a pool of twenty-five to
thirty animals was exposed in plastic containers to a relative air humidity controlled at 98.2% by placing a NaCl
solution of 31.6 g L-1 inside the closed container. Animals
were sacrificed after 8, 27, 53 and 174 hours of exposure
for RNA isolation. For each condition two biological replicates were used (separately) for RNA extraction.
Cadmium and phenanthrene treatment
For the cadmium and phenanthrene treatments animals
were exposed in 100 ml jars on a compressed layer of 10
g wet weight of LUFA 2.2 soils (for details see [36]). Procedures of the standard ISO protocol 11267 [18] were followed to spike the soils to nominal concentrations
equivalent to the LC50 28 days for cadmium (6.86 mmol
kg-1 dry soil [37]) and phenanthrene (422 μmol kg-1 dry
soil [36]). For the cadmium spiking a solution of hydrated
CdCl2 (purity 99%; J.T. Baker, The Netherlands) was used,
while phenanthrene (purity 96%; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie,
Germany) was dissolved in acetone (Riedel-de Haën,
Seelze, Germany), followed by an overnight evaporation
time for the acetone. Both soils did not undergo a period
of aging. Pools of 15 animals per jar were exposed for a
period of 48 hr (cadmium) or 96 hr (phenanthrene) to
spiked and clean control soils. For each condition four
biological replicates were used (separately) for RNA
extraction.
O. cincta treatments
Cadmium treatment
Cadmium exposure was performed as described in Roelofs et al. [25]. Animals were exposed individually to a
nominal concentration of 1 μmole cadmium per gram dry
weight food (algal paste). The exposure was started immediately after moulting to exclude hormonal effects on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/54

gene expression and lasted for three days. Five individuals
were pooled per replicate; a control was used with the
same set-up but fed clean algae. For each condition three
biological replicates were used (separately) for RNA
extraction.
Temperature exposure
Springtails were exposed in glass vials containing slightly
moistened foam at the bottom and moistened foam stoppers. Five individuals per vial were exposed to three temperature treatments: cold (10°C), control (20°C) and
heat (35°C). Temperature treatments consisted of four
hours at 10°C respectively 20°C in a climate room, or one
hour placement in a water bath of 35°C with a one hour
recovery period at 20°C. For each condition three biological replicates of five pooled animals were used (separately) for RNA extraction.
Desiccation treatment
The desiccation treatment followed the protocol
described by Bahrndorff et al. [38]. Springtails were
exposed to 97.2% relative humidity in a tightly sealed
container containing a NaCl solution of 50.66 g L-1 at
20°C for five days. The control treatment followed the
same protocol, but instead of the NaCl solution demineralized water was used. We used five individuals per vial
and three vials per treatment. Animals from each vial were
pooled for RNA isolation.
Starvation treatment
We used five individuals per vial and three vials for the
starvation treatment and its control. Springtails were
transferred to glass vials containing slightly moistened
foam at the bottom and moistened foam stoppers. In the
control treatment food was made available by adding a
piece of bark overgrown with green algae to the animals,
while the animals in the starvation treatment did not have
access to food. The experimental vials were kept at 20°C
in a 12:12 light dark regime for 8 days. Animals from each
vial were pooled for RNA isolation.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription
After exposure animals were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was isolated with the SV Total RNA isolation system (Promega) according to manufacturer's
instructions. Genomic DNA was removed via a DNAse
treatment supplied with the kit. RNA integrity was confirmed on a 1% agarose gel and RNA quantities were
assessed with a nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(Nanodrop Technologies) and ranged between 30 and
100 ng μL-1 of total RNA. As indicated by 260/280 and
260/230 nm ratios, all samples used in this study were
assumed free from protein contamination and (organic)
salts. Absence of amplicons after PCR with Taq-polymerase (MRC Holland, The Netherlands) and 1 μL RNA solu-

tion confirmed that no trace DNA contamination was
present in the samples used in the further analyses.
Synthesis of cDNA was performed using the reverse-transcriptase system of Promega with the M-MLV reverse transcriptase enzyme and an oligo-dT primer (F. candida
samples) or random hexamer primers (O. cincta). Random hexamer primers were used in the case of O. cincta
because 28S ribosomal RNA was used as one of the potential reference genes. In the case of the O. cincta samples,
reverse transcription input amounts were equalized by
diluting the total RNA concentrations to 0.5 μg μL-1, and
samples were reverse transcribed together in a single run.
cDNA samples were diluted 4 times before QPCR was carried out. All treatment conditions were reverse transcribed
in triplicate, except for the pH treated samples which were
performed in duplicate.
QPCR
Besides reference genes, one or two differentially
expressed genes were included in order to observe transcriptional effects of the treatment. These differentials
were previously assessed for their response to the majority
of the treatments ([25,39,40], TE de Boer, MJTN Timmermans, unpubl. data). For the desiccation and starvation
treatments in O. cincta, lack of prior knowledge of characteristic responsive genes made us look to a fixed set of two
differentials for all four treatments. QPCR assays for seven
candidate reference genes (Table 1) and two genes differential for a range of stressful conditions, HSP70 and MT,
[41,42] were developed. For F. candida, eight candidate
reference genes were analyzed (Table 1) together with one
differential gene for each treatment. Primers were based
on sequences present in the Collembola EST database
Collembase http://www.collembase.org and generated
with Primer Express 1.5 (Applied Biosystems) with the
following settings: Melting temperatures were kept
between 59°C and 60°C and the amplified fragment
length was kept between 90 and 120 base pairs with an
optimum amplicon melting temperature of 80°C. For
primer sequences, GC content and melting temperatures
(see Additional file 4). Details on the positions of the
QPCR amplicons in the full coding sequences are given in
(Additional file 5).

Reaction efficiency of each of the QPCR assays was determined by means of a standard curve consisting of 5 samples each four fold diluted, from an initial cDNA pool.
Each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 20 μL,
using 2 μL cDNA template, 10 μL SYBR Green I master
mix (Applied Biosystems) and 20 pmole of each gene specific primer (supplied by Isogen). QPCR Cycling was performed on an DNA engine Opticon1 (Biorad), with three
technical replicates per sample. Cycling conditions were
kept constant for all assays. For details on PCR mix and
program see Roelofs et al. [25]). Specificity of the PCR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/54

products was confirmed after each amplification by analysis of the melting curve; 60–90°C with a heating rate of
0.1°C per second and one fluorescence measurement per
second. Each run included a non-template control for
each assay.
For two of the O. cincta assays (GAPDH and SDHA) no
sequence information was available. Therefore degenerate
primers were developed based on sequences from multiple organisms that were taken from Genbank. Generated
PCR templates were subsequently cloned, sequenced and
used as a template for QPCR primers as described above.
Proper QPCR data were not retrieved from one F. candida
pH treatment replicate (pH 3.5). Therefore this sample
was discarded from further analysis.
Data analysis
Ct values were calculated with the Opticon Monitor 3 software (Biorad), using a manually set cycle threshold. At a
level of 0.01 raw fluorescent units which in all assayed
plates fell within the exponential phases of the QPCR
reactions. Averages of the three technical replicates were
used in case of a standard deviation ≤ 0.5. When standard
deviation exceeded this number, fluorescence curves were
evaluated. The analysis was always based on at least two
replicates.

Ranking of reference genes was determined using geNorm
and Normfinder applications, as implemented in the
Genex Light software package [43]. Optimum numbers of
reference genes are based on a Vn/Vn+1 value of > 0.15 for
geNorm [15] and the minimum of accumulated standard
deviations for Normfinder [17]. The original geNorm VBA
applet for Excel was used for automated calculation of Vn/
Vn+1.
Relative gene expressions of all differential genes were calculated with the Pfaffl method [10] and normalized with
both of the optimum sets of reference genes proposed by
geNorm and Normfinder. Significance levels were tested
by Student's t-test, for both algorithms. To be conservative
we report only the larger P-value in the results. The temperature exposures of F. candida (Figure 2) were normalized as described in the results section, and tested for their
significance by one-way ANOVA analysis with a Bonferroni corrected post-hoc test between the different temperatures for each normalization method.
Bias threshold definition
In Normfinder the total stability ('variability') of a gene is
defined by the magnitude of the intragroup variation relative to the intergroup variation [16]. Differential genes,
which are responding to one or more treatments, will
greatly increase the intergroup variation and hence have a
disproportionally large effect on the calculated variability
and the ranking order of the other candidate genes. To

avoid such biases, differential genes should be excluded
from the NormFinder analysis using a pre-selection procedure. The pre-selection procedure consisted of an initial
NormFinder analysis with all genes, from which we calculated a bias threshold for the amount of total absolute
bias a gene was allowed to have, compared to the total
mean absolute bias of the group. Assuming a normal distribution of biases and genes, we considered the 10%
most stable genes to be suitable as potential reference
genes, which sets the bias threshold between -0.13*SD
and 0.13*SD of the normal distribution [44]. In the final
NormFinder analysis only those genes that met the criterion of being among the 10% most stable genes were
included. Ranking of the remaining genes was subsequently done by determining the standard deviation in a
Normfinder analysis with the software settings set to not
taking groups into account (M. Kubista, pers. comm.).
