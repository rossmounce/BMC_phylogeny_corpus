Abstract
Background: Structural analysis of biochemical networks is a growing field in bioinformatics and
systems biology. The availability of an increasing amount of biological data from molecular biological
networks promises a deeper understanding but confronts researchers with the problem of
combinatorial explosion. The amount of qualitative network data is growing much faster than the
amount of quantitative data, such as enzyme kinetics. In many cases it is even impossible to measure
quantitative data because of limitations of experimental methods, or for ethical reasons. Thus, a
huge amount of qualitative data, such as interaction data, is available, but it was not sufficiently used
for modeling purposes, until now. New approaches have been developed, but the complexity of
data often limits the application of many of the methods. Biochemical Petri nets make it possible to
explore static and dynamic qualitative system properties. One Petri net approach is model
validation based on the computation of the system's invariant properties, focusing on t-invariants.
T-invariants correspond to subnetworks, which describe the basic system behavior.
With increasing system complexity, the basic behavior can only be expressed by a huge number of
t-invariants. According to our validation criteria for biochemical Petri nets, the necessary
verification of the biological meaning, by interpreting each subnetwork (t-invariant) manually, is not
possible anymore. Thus, an automated, biologically meaningful classification would be helpful in
analyzing t-invariants, and supporting the understanding of the basic behavior of the considered
biological system.
Methods: Here, we introduce a new approach to automatically classify t-invariants to cope with
network complexity. We apply clustering techniques such as UPGMA, Complete Linkage, Single
Linkage, and Neighbor Joining in combination with different distance measures to get biologically
meaningful clusters (t-clusters), which can be interpreted as modules. To find the optimal number

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/90

of t-clusters to consider for interpretation, the cluster validity measure, Silhouette Width, is
applied.
Results: We considered two different case studies as examples: a small signal transduction
pathway (pheromone response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and a medium-sized gene
regulatory network (gene regulation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy). We automatically classified
the t-invariants into functionally distinct t-clusters, which could be interpreted biologically as
functional modules in the network. We found differences in the suitability of the various distance
measures as well as the clustering methods. In terms of a biologically meaningful classification of tinvariants, the best results are obtained using the Tanimoto distance measure. Considering
clustering methods, the obtained results suggest that UPGMA and Complete Linkage are suitable
for clustering t-invariants with respect to the biological interpretability.
Conclusion: We propose a new approach for the biological classification of Petri net t-invariants
based on cluster analysis. Due to the biologically meaningful data reduction and structuring of
network processes, large sets of t-invariants can be evaluated, allowing for model validation of
qualitative biochemical Petri nets. This approach can also be applied to elementary mode analysis.

Background
Structural analysis of biochemical networks (i.e. metabolic, signal transduction and gene regulatory networks)
is a growing field in bioinformatics, especially considering
the availability of nearly complete metabolic networks of
several organisms [1,2]. Elementary mode analysis [3],
extreme pathway analysis [4], and Petri net invariant analysis [5] are established methods to qualitatively analyze
biochemical network models. By giving insight into the
basic system behavior, these qualitative approaches can
be used to check a model for consistency and biologically
meaningful behavior, allowing for model validation. The
first two methods (elementary mode and extreme pathway analysis) are predominantly applied to metabolic
networks [6,7], Petri net theory is additionally applied to
signal transduction [8-10] and gene regulatory networks
[9,11,12], and combinations of them [13-15]. A detailed
review of the use of Petri nets in systems biology is given
in the references [16,17], or [18].
Petri net theory is a mathematical formalism, enabling
formal and clear representation of biochemical networks
at different abstraction levels, as well as their structural
analysis. In contrast to the concepts of elementary modes
and extreme pathways, Petri nets additionally provide
analysis techniques for the computation of static and
dynamic network properties [19]. Other strong advantages are the visual representation and animation facilities, which support the intuitive comprehension of the
network and provide a useful communication platform
between theoreticians and experimentalists. Because of
these reasons, we use Petri nets for modeling biochemical
networks. All examples in this paper were developed as
Petri nets and validated using Petri nets techniques.

The concept of minimal non-negative t-invariants forms
the basis for validating biochemical Petri nets. A crucial
point in model validation [19,20], is that the net should
be covered by t-invariants, and that there should be no tinvariant without a sensible biological meaning. When
addressing the second point, the exponentially growing
number of minimal invariants in large biochemical networks creates the need for additional concepts and tools,
as large numbers of invariants can no longer be handled
and interpreted manually.
Modularization techniques [21,22], which automatically
decompose complex networks into functional modules,
can be applied to facilitate the analysis and interpretation
of biochemical systems and their basic behavior. The
computation of maximal common transitions sets (MCTsets) [10], which can be read as functional units (i.e. units
with a distinct biological meaning), allows for the examination of t-invariants by decomposing a given network
into biologically meaningful modules.
A common approach to handling large data sets is cluster
analysis, a data mining technique used to group objects of
similar kind into respective subsets. Due to the identification of relatively homogeneous subsets, the application of
clustering techniques results in a structured and reduced
data representation, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of large data sets. To provide a biological analysis of
large numbers of elementary modes, Pérès et al. [23] elaborated a classification method of elementary modes called
aggregation around common motif (ACoM). By grouping
elementary modes into classes with similar substructures,
this method allows the interpretation of classes of elementary modes to find their biological meaning. To the
best of our knowledge, no clustering approaches in the
analysis of Petri nets existed until now. In this paper, we

demonstrate how this novel application contributes to the
analysis of Petri net t-invariants. We introduce and discuss
the classification of t-invariants based on cluster analysis
by applying different clustering techniques and distance
measures to various sets of t-invariants of biochemical
Petri net models. After a short introduction to Petri nets
and the clustering techniques used, we illustrate and discuss the clustering results in two case studies: a small signal transduction pathway and a medium-sized gene
regulatory pathway.

the firing rule. A transition can fire, or take place, if it is
enabled; that is, if the pre-places, also called pre-conditions, carry at least as many tokens as indicated by the
weights of the transition's incoming arcs. This means that
as many tokens will be removed from the pre-places of the
transition as are indicated by the arc weights of its incoming arcs, and as many tokens are put on the post-places as
are given by the arc weights of its outgoing arcs (Figure 1).
This firing rule is timeless and describes a discrete process.
Note that tokens can be produced within the system and
removed from the system.

Methods
Petri nets
A Petri net, N = (P, T, F, M0), is a directed bipartite graph
with two types of nodes, which are described by the finite
sets, P and T . Places, p ∈ P, drawn as circles, typically
model the passive part of the network, which in biochemical Petri nets are the chemical compounds (e.g. metabolites or complexes). Transitions, t ∈ T, drawn as rectangles,
generally stand for the active part (e.g. stoichiometric
chemical reactions, complex formation, de-/phosphorylation, de-/activation). The set, F, describes the directed arcs
between places and transitions and vice versa. In metabolic networks, the arcs are weighted by the stoichiometric factors of the underlying stoichiometric reaction
equations, whereas in signal transduction and gene regulatory networks the arc weight is usually set to one at the
beginning of the modeling process [10,24], because no
stoichiometric equations exist. There are movable objects,
tokens, which are located on places. They usually correspond to an amount (e.g. a mole) of the chemical compound (e.g. a metabolite). The distribution of tokens over
the places is called a marking, M, representing a certain system state. M0 describes the initial marking, before any
reaction took place. The movement of tokens is defined by

Now, static and dynamic network properties can be computed to analyze the system behavior. In the following, we
will focus on these properties, which are essential to our
analysis. For a more formal and detailed introduction to
Petri nets, see references [25-28], or [29]. We continue
with the introduction of system invariants, especially the
t-invariants [5], which form the basis for all further analyses in this paper.
T-invariants
A Petri net's incidence matrix corresponds to the stoichiometric matrix in a metabolic network. The incidence
matrix comprises the change in token amount for each
place when a single transition of the whole network fires
(see Figure 2). Based on an incidence matrix, C, the linear
equation system, C · y = 0, can be formulated to calculate
the t-invariants, y. The t-invariants describe the system
behavior of the network, e.g. for metabolic networks in
the steady state. Only nontrivial, non-negative integer
solutions are of interest. Because the non-empty solution
space of such linear equation systems is infinite, we want
to get a minimal and favorably finite characterization of

all solutions. Thus, we are searching for minimal nontrivial, non-negative integer solutions.
The elements corresponding to an invariant's non-zero
entries are called the support of this invariant. To get minimal invariants, the support of one invariant must not be
contained in another one, and the greatest common divisor of all entries of the invariant vector is equal to 1. In the
following, we write t-invariants instead of minimal t-invariants. The support of a vector (i.e. of a t-invariant) contains
the set of transitions with an entry greater than 0, without
any additional information, as, for example, the weight
for each transition in the t-invariant. Vectors, containing
frequencies of the elements, are called Parikh vectors (for
the formal definition see [53]), which are interpreted in
Petri net theory as a frequency vector of firing transitions.
The solution vectors of the linear equation system give
multisets of transitions, which can be interpreted in the
context of Petri nets as well as in a biological context.
The Petri net interpretation of t-invariants means that the
firing of transitions, indicated by the entries in the Parikh
vector formed by t-invariants, reproduces an arbitrary sys-

tem state, indicated by a token distribution. In biology,
the interpretation was introduced by Schuster et al. [3],
and represents the well-known concept of elementary
modes. The correspondence of elementary modes and
minimal t-invariants is given by their definitions. The concept of elementary modes is described on the basis of a
finitely generated convex cone. Elementary modes represent solution vectors on the surface and in the interior of
this cone. The cone is polyhedral, and is given by the corresponding linear inequation system [30]. This concept
has mainly been applied to metabolic systems. Here, minimal t-invariants and elementary modes, respectively, are
interpreted as the minimal set of enzymes, which represent the chemical reactions or transitions, respectively,
which can operate at steady state. T-invariants have also
been used for analyzing signaling and gene regulatory networks [8,10,12]. Meanwhile, also elementary modes are
applied to the analysis of signaling pathways [31]. Please
note that in signal transduction and gene-regulatory networks generally no stoichiometric relations are known,
such that the invariant condition cannot be interpreted as
the steady state known in biology. Since the set of minimal t-invariants is a generating system for the solution

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:90

space, all solutions (not only the minimal t-invariants)
can be computed by a linear combination of the minimal
ones.
According to our validation criteria for biochemical Petri
nets [19,20], this also means that each transition must be
contained in one of the minimal t-invariants. This property is called covered by t-invariants, or for short, CTI. Tinvariants define subnets, and minimal t-invariants define
self-contained subnets, which are always connected.
These subnetworks describe biological pathways in the
network, and each should be checked for its biological
meaning to validate the model. The occurrence of a biologically senseless or unknown pathway can indicate a
modeling error or a new pathway detection, which can
induce further experiments. Unfortunately, the number of
t-invariants can grow exponentially. For larger and more
complex biochemical networks, the number of t-invariants can be in the thousands or more. In this case, our
clustering approach can help to interpret these large sets
of t-invariants.
Pathways and subpathways
A pathway is a part of a biochemical network (i.e. a subnetwork) with a special biological meaning. In graph theory,
it corresponds to a subgraph of the whole graph. A pathway is not necessarily linear; it may contain branches and
joints. Well-known biochemical pathways are, for example, the glycolytic pathway or the pentose phosphate
pathway. Consequently, a subpathway is again a part of a
pathway, but not necessarily related to a whole biological
functional unit.
Cluster analysis
Cluster analysis comprises a range of methods for classifying multivariate data into subsets (clusters) based on similarity. By partitioning heterogeneous data into relatively
homogeneous clusters, clustering can help to identify the
intrinsic grouping in the data set and to reveal the characteristics of some structure in the data. In biology, clustering techniques are applied to many different fields of
study, such as ecology, zoology, and molecular biology
(e.g. gene expression analysis) [32,33]. A cluster analysis
can be seen as a three step process, encompassing the following main steps: (1) selection of a distance measure to
compute the distance between all pairs of objects, (2)
selection of a clustering algorithm to group the objects
based on the computed distances, and (3) selection of a
cluster validity measure to identify the optimal number of
clusters for interpretation. A detailed description of each
of these steps is given below.
Distance measures
To assess the similarity between two objects, oi and oj, it is
necessary, first, to describe the objects according to some

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/90

scheme and then choose an appropriate measure to compare the description of the objects. A common method is
to describe the objects by the presence or absence of features and to compute the similarity by comparing the
binary feature vectors, χi, χj, of the objects, {oi, oj}. In our
case, the objects considered are the t-invariants, and the
feature vectors correspond to the support vectors of these
invariants. The Tanimoto coefficient [34] has been chosen
as the similarity measure. Based on this coefficient, the
similarity between two t-invariants, ti and tj, is computed
as:

s(t i , t j ) = s ij =

a
a +b + c

where a is the number of features present in both objects,
b is the number of features only present in object, i, and c
is the number of features only present in object, j. The
pair-wise similarity, sij, is transformed into a distance, dij
[35], by
dij = 1 - sij.
For the clarity of illustration, an example is given below:

0 0
   
Beside the Tanimoto coefficient, several other distance
measures (Simple Matching [34], Sum of Difference [34])
have been tested in preliminary investigations. Supported
by an external cluster validation (i.e. the evaluation of
clustering results based on the knowledge of the correct
classification of objects), the distance measures were validated and compared on the basis of various sets of t-invariants from different types of biochemical Petri nets
describing metabolic, gene regulatory, and signal transduction nets. In this paper, only the distance measure
showing the best results, the Tanimoto coefficient, is
applied to the data. A brief discussion of the other distance measures is given as additional material [see Additional file 1].
Clustering algorithms
Having obtained the distance between each pair of objects
in the data set, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is
applied, which successively merges the objects into binary
clusters resulting in an ordered sequence of partitions (i.e.
a hierarchical clustering tree or dendrogram). In the dendrogram produced by the clustering algorithm the objects
are located at the leaves of the dendrogram, and similar
objects occur in proximate branches. The dendrogram can
Page 5 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:90

be cut at any level to yield different clustering, i.e. partitions, of the data.
In this paper, three agglomerative hierarchical clustering
algorithms (UPGMA, Single Linkage, and Complete Linkage) are applied. In general, an agglomerative clustering
algorithm starts with the finest partitioning (singleton
clusters), merging the two most similar clusters in each
iteration, until all clusters are joined in one cluster.
Agglomerative algorithms differ in the way the distance
between a pair of two clusters is determined. In UPGMA,
the distance between two clusters, Ci and Cj, is computed
as the average of distances, dij, of all possible pairs of
objects with i ∈ Ci and j ∈ Cj . In Single Linkage and Complete Linkage, the distance between two clusters, Ci and Cj,
is the minimum of distances, dij, or maximum of distances, dij, respectively, of all possible pairs of objects with
i ∈ Ci and j ∈ Cj .
As a fourth method, the Neighbor Joining algorithm, a clustering technique widely used for phylogenetic tree construction, is implemented. The Neighbor Joining
algorithm, originally introduced by Saitou and Nei [36],
and modified by Studier and Keppler [37], successively
joins pairs of neighboring objects. To determine two
neighboring objects, the average distance of each object to
each other object is computed and subtracted from the
pairwise distance, dij, between the objects.
In this paper, the algorithm given by Saitou and Nei [36],
which generates an unrooted tree (in phylogeny interpreted as a tree with an unknown evolutionary ancestor),
has been modified to build a rooted tree, by assigning a
root node in between the two clusters remaining at the
end of the clustering process. For a detailed description of
clustering techniques, see e.g. [38]. Once the hierarchical
clustering tree has been built, we have to decide the most
suitable number of clusters.
Number of clusters
The prediction of the optimal number of clusters to consider for interpretation, or the decision of where to cut the
hierarchical tree, is a fundamental problem in unsupervised classification. To overcome this problem, various
cluster validity measures have been proposed to assess the
quality of a clustering partition (for review, see [39] and
[33]), thus helping to identify the number of clusters that
"best" represents the intrinsic grouping of the data. After
testing different validity measures (Silhouette Width [40],
Dunn- [41], Davies-Bouldin- [42], and C-index [43]) in preliminary investigations, the measure showing the best
results, the Silhouette Width, is applied to the data. A brief
discussion of the other validity measures is given as additional material [see Additional file 2]. The Silhouette
Width for a clustering partition is computed as the average

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/90

Silhouette value over all data samples. The Silhouette
value, S, for an individual data sample, i, is defined as

S(i) =

bi − a i
,
max(bi ,a i )

where ai denotes the average distance between i and all the
data samples in the same cluster, and bi denotes the average distance between i and all data samples in the closest
other cluster (i.e. the cluster yielding the minimal bi). The
Silhouette Width is limited to the interval [-1,1] and
should be maximized. The shape of the Neighbor Joining
dendrogram does not permit the application of the proposed cluster validity measures, as the cutting of the dendrogram at a given hierarchical level does not always
result in a partition comprising the sum of all clustered
objects. Therefore, the optimal number of clusters for the
Neighbor Joining dendrograms is determined based on
visual inspection.
T-cluster
The proposed clustering approach results in clusters of tinvariants, t-clusters for short. The set of transitions characterizing a given t-cluster (i.e. those transitions that participate exactly in all t-invariants of the t-cluster) define
subnets, which can overlap or even contain each other.
Due to their distinct biological meaning, these subnets
can be read as functional units. These modules, which are
defined by the resulting t-clusters, can be used for decomposing a network into biologically relevant functional
units. Transitions not contained in any of these modules
correspond to functional units, which characterize a subset of t-invariants of a given t-cluster. In general, these
functional units correspond to trivial modules, i.e. modules consisting of only one transition.
Modeling and classification approach
The biochemical pathways used as case studies in this
paper are modeled as Petri nets and validated according to
Koch and Heiner [19]. In order not to describe the whole
modeling process we chose already published models
[10,24] and discuss the clustering results here. We consider two different types of biochemical pathways, a signal
transduction and a gene regulatory pathway. The computed t-invariants are clustered based on the Tanimoto
distance measure and the clustering methods UPGMA,
Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, and Neighbor Joining.
To determine the optimal number of t-clusters for interpretation, the quality of all clustering partitions of a given
dendrogram is determined based on the Silhouette Width,
and the partitioning maximizing the validity measure is
chosen for interpretation. All models are given as additional material [see Additional file 3].

Results and Discussion
Results
In the following, two well-investigated examples, a signal
transduction pathway and a gene regulatory pathway, are
given to demonstrate the usability of our approach. After
a short introduction to the biological background of each
pathway, the clustering results are presented and an evaluation of the applied clustering techniques is given.

these biological modules (i.e. the common biological features), the t-invariants belonging to one t-cluster are characterized below:
t-cluster 1: t-invariant 1
common biological feature: receptor activation and composition

Pheromone response pathway in yeast
Biological background
The pheromone response pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) is one of the best understood signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes [44]. Two haploid yeast cells
of opposite mating types are able to mate and fuse into
one diploid cell. For this purpose, the response of one cell
to the presence of a cell of the opposite mating type is triggered by a secreted peptide mating pheromone binding to
a cell surface receptor, which leads to a G protein transmitted signal transduction. The resulting signal is then
transmitted and amplified through a mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase cascade. A complete cellular
response ultimately includes induction or repression of
gene transcription, synchronization of the cell cycles (i.e.
an arrest in G1 phase), and, finally, the mating of the cells
and the fusion of their nuclei [45].

The t-invariant 1 includes the synthesis and activation of
the pheromone receptor. The activated receptor causes the
dissociation of the G-protein, whose subunits reassociate
to a trimeric form.

Petri net model
The Petri net model of the pheromone response pathway,
shown in Figure 3, consists of 48 transitions and is covered by 10 t-invariants. The composition of the t-invariants based on the transitions is represented in Figure 4; a
table listing the transitions by their name and biological
meaning is given as additional material [see Additional
file 3]. For further information on the Petri net model the
reader is referred to Sackmann et al. [10].

The t-invariants 3 to 6 include the composition of the
MAP kinase cascade complex and the MAP kinase cascade.
Differences between the t-invariants originate from
actions taking place downstream of the cascade, which
either result in the degradation of the MAPK complex (tinvariant 3 (t37, t38)); t-invariant 4 (t38, t39)), or in the
repression of a transcription factor (t-invariant 5 (t43), tinvariant 6 (t40, t41)).

Clustering results
The clustering results of all four methods are shown in Figure 5, with the optimal partition being indicated by the
Silhouette Width. Based on this validity measure, the set
of the 10 t-invariants is split into four t-clusters by all clustering methods, each cluster containing the same t-invariants across all methods. The composition of the tinvariants belonging to one t-cluster is represented in Figure 4, with the set of transitions characterizing a given tcluster (i.e. those transitions, which participate exactly in
all t-invariants of the t-cluster) being highlighted. A graphical representation as well as a biological interpretation of
each of these transition sets is given in Figure 3.

The transition sets shown in Figure 3 define subnets,
which can be assigned to a distinct biological meaning. By
representing biologically relevant functional units, these
subnets can be read as biological modules. With respect to

The t-invariants 7 to 10 include the complete pheromone
response pathway (activation and composition of the
pheromone receptor complex, MAP kinase cascade, transcription factor activation, gene transcription, and cell
fusion) leading to a mating of the cell. Differences
between t-invariants primarily originate from positive and
negative feedback regulations, like the repression of transcription factors (t42).
The obtained results show that the t-invariants belonging
to one t-cluster are significantly involved in the same biological processes. They are characterized by similar subnets, which correspond to biologically relevant functional
modules (see Figure 3). Showing high intra-cluster homo-

Gene regulation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Biological background
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most
common inherited human neuromuscular diseases. The
disorder is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene,
followed by the absence or functional impairment of the
protein. The network downstream of dystrophin, which
represents the pathomechanism of DMD, comprises different gene regulatory processes, such as the dystrophinglycoprotein-complex (DGC) downstream pathway. DGC
is formed in presence of the protein, dystrophin, which is
absent in DMD patients. The functional DGC results in a
reaction cascade, which finally phosphorylates the transcription factor, NFATc. NFATc is dephosphorylated and,
consequently, activated by calcineurin. In turn, calcineurin is positively regulated by the RAP2B-calcineurin
cascade (RAP2B downstream pathway). Activated NFATc
is able to enter the nucleus and to act as a transcription
factor for different genes, such as MYF5, UTRNA, and p21.
The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21, is a
negative regulator of the G1 to S progression in the cell
cycle. Therefore, it plays an important role in cell cycle
withdrawal and, consequently, in determining proliferation or differentiation [46].

ants reflects the system behavior. Model validation of biochemical networks, based on Petri net t-invariants, often
becomes unmanageable due to the huge number of tinvariants in large biochemical networks, which can no
longer be evaluated manually.

t-cluster 21: t-invariants 1, 2, 3
RB-E2F cell cycle pathway, inhibited by CDK2-phosphorylated E2F
In concordance with the results shown in the first case
study, the computed t-clusters are biologically meaningful. The t-invariants belonging to one t-cluster are characterized by similar subnetworks, which correspond to
biologically relevant functional units (see Figure 6). A distinct separation of t-invariants with respect to biological
functionality is shown in the dendrogram given in Figure
7. The t-invariants covering the RAP2B downstream pathway (t-clusters 7 – 11, t-cluster 14), the DGC downstream
pathway (t-clusters 12 – 14), the NFATc initiation (t-clusters 15 – 19), and the E2F-RB-complex generation (t-clusters 20, 21) are well-discriminated, and a clear separation
concerning the transcriptional targets genes is given. Furthermore, t-invariants representing pathways not covered
by any other t-invariant are assigned to singleton clusters
(t-cluster 1 – 4), indicating their particular role in the network. Due to the high intra-cluster homogeneity in combination with distinct inter-cluster separation, the
application of UPGMA leads to a biologically meaningful
classification of t-invariants.
With only minor differences, comparable results are
obtained using Complete Linkage and Neighbor Joining.
In contrast, the dendrogram based on Single Linkage is
characterized by a larger number of singleton t-clusters
(i.e. clusters containing only one t-invariant) with only
three t-clusters containing more than three t-invariants,
thus, resulting in a less distinct discrimination of the tinvariants. The dendrograms, as well as a detailed description of the clustering results, using Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, and Neighbor Joining, are given as
additional material [see Additional file 5].
In agreement with the network modularization shown in
the first case study, the plotting of the transition sets, characterizing the computed t-clusters, leads to a valuable
decomposition of the Petri net model into biologically
relevant functional units (see Figure 6).

Discussion
Our approach aims to facilitate the model validation of
biochemical Petri nets. This validation is mainly based on
the assignment of a biological meaning to each of the tinvariants. These t-invariants describe possible pathways
in the net. Thus, the biological interpretation of t-invari-

The use of automatic modularization techniques [21,22],
which decomposes a complex network into functional
modules, facilitates the analysis of complex biological systems and their general behavior. The concept of MCT-sets,
introduced by Sackmann et al. [10], represents one possible way to decompose t-invariants into disjunctive subnetworks, which can be interpreted as the smallest
biological building blocks. Another possibility is the clustering of t-invariants, as described in this paper, which
generally results in overlapping subnetworks. This
method can be applied to large sets of t-invariants, with
the user having the ability to influence the complexity of
the evaluation by choosing a respective number of t-clusters for interpretation.
Data mining techniques, such as cluster analysis, enable
the analysis of large sets of data, due to the identification
of relatively homogeneous subsets, resulting in a structured and reduced data representation. To investigate the
classification of biochemical Petri net t-invariants based
on cluster analysis, we have applied different distance
measures and clustering techniques to various sets of tinvariants of biochemical Petri net models, using as examples, a small signal transduction pathway and a larger
gene regulatory pathway. To identify the optimal number
of t-clusters to consider for interpretation, different cluster
validity measures (Silhouette Width, Dunn-, Davies-Bouldin-, and C-index) have been evaluated in preliminary
investigations, with the Silhouette Width offering the best
results with respect to the percentage of correct predictions. The clustering techniques, UPGMA, Single Linkage,
Complete Linkage, and Neighbor Joining, have been
tested in combination with different distance measures
(Tanimoto, Simple Matching, Sum of Difference). With
respect to the biological interpretability, the best results
are obtained using the Tanimoto distance measure. In
combination with the Tanimoto coefficient, our results
suggest that the clustering techniques, UPGMA, Complete
Linkage, and Neighbor Joining are suitable for the clustering of t-invariants. All of the clustering results based on
these methods correspond to a biologically meaningful
classification of t-invariants in the example pathways. The
computed t-clusters comprise t-invariants, which are significantly involved in the same biological processes.
While t-invariants characterized by similar subpathways
are grouped together, t-invariants, which correspond to
subpathways not covered by any other t-invariant, are
assigned to singleton clusters (e.g. Figure 7). These "outliers" have to be checked carefully with respect to biologi-

cal functionality, as they might represent a modeling
error. In contrast to the clustering results obtained by
UPGMA, Complete Linkage, and Neighbor Joining, a
functionally indistinct classification is obtained using the
Single Linkage method (see e.g. the second case study).
Being subject to a chaining effect [47], the Single Linkage
algorithm has the tendency to produce straggling or elongated clusters and is less eligible for the classification of tinvariants. When dealing with large numbers of t-invariants, Neighbor Joining is outperformed by UPGMA and
Complete Linkage due to its run-time complexity. On that
account, our results suggest that UPGMA and Complete
Linkage are the most appropriate methods for a biological
classification of t-invariants.
The set of transitions that characterizes a given t-cluster of
t-invariants can be interpreted as a biological module.
Similar to the MCT-sets, these modules are automatically
generated based on structural network properties only,
and can be assigned to a distinct biological meaning.
Whereas MCT-sets describe disjunctive subnetworks, tclusters can produce overlapping subnetworks. These
overlapping transitions can be interpreted as a set of compounds (or enzymes for metabolic networks) that are
active in more than one functional module. By decomposing a given network into biochemical subnetworks, our
approach demonstrates a biologically meaningful modularization technique based on the clustering of t-invariants.

Conclusion
This paper describes a new general approach for the
decomposition of large biochemical networks into functional modules. This decomposition is based on Petri net
t-invariants, but can also be applied to elementary modes.
We have used different clustering techniques in combination with different distance measures and cluster validity
measures to classify t-invariants. The obtained results suggest that UPGMA and Complete Linkage, in combination
with the Tanimoto distance measure, and the cluster
validity measure, Silhouette Width, are suitable for classifying t-invariants into t-clusters that have a distinct biological meaning. T-invariants of a given t-cluster are
significantly involved in the same biological processes.
They are characterized by similar subnets, which correspond to biologically relevant functional units. Our
approach leads to a biologically meaningful data reduction and structuring of the network. Thus, large sets of tinvariants can be evaluated and interpreted, allowing for
model validation of biochemical systems.
