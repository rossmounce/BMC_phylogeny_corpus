Abstract
Background: Many secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi have potent biological activities, to
which the producer organism must be resistant. An example of pharmaceutical interest is mycophenolic acid
(MPA), an immunosuppressant molecule produced by several Penicillium species. The target of MPA is inosine-5’monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which catalyses the rate limiting step in the synthesis of guanine
nucleotides. The recent discovery of the MPA biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium brevicompactum revealed
an extra copy of the IMPDH-encoding gene (mpaF) embedded within the cluster. This finding suggests that the
key component of MPA self resistance is likely based on the IMPDH encoded by mpaF.
Results: In accordance with our hypothesis, heterologous expression of mpaF dramatically increased MPA
resistance in a model fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, which does not produce MPA. The growth of an A. nidulans
strain expressing mpaF was only marginally affected by MPA at concentrations as high as 200 μg/ml. To further
substantiate the role of mpaF in MPA resistance, we searched for mpaF orthologs in six MPA producer/nonproducer strains from Penicillium subgenus Penicillium. All six strains were found to hold two copies of IMPDH. A
cladistic analysis based on the corresponding cDNA sequences revealed a novel group constituting mpaF
homologs. Interestingly, a conserved tyrosine residue in the original class of IMPDHs is replaced by a phenylalanine
residue in the new IMPDH class.
Conclusions: We identified a novel variant of the IMPDH-encoding gene in six different strains from Penicillium
subgenus Penicillium. The novel IMPDH variant from MPA producer P. brevicompactum was shown to confer a high
degree of MPA resistance when expressed in a non-producer fungus. Our study provides a basis for understanding
the molecular mechanism of MPA resistance and has relevance for biotechnological and pharmaceutical
applications.

Background
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active ingredient in
important immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals such as
CellCept® (Roche) and Myfortic® (Novartis). The target
of MPA is inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase
(IMPDH) [1], which catalyses the conversion of IMP to
xanthosine-5’-monophosphate (XMP). This reaction is
the first committed and the rate-limiting step in guanine
nucleotide biosynthesis [2] (Figure 1). The ability to

produce MPA is almost exclusively found in species
from the Penicillium subgenus Penicillium, where several species have been reported to produce MPA [3].
The fact that producer fungi are resistant towards their
own toxic metabolite (in this case MPA) suggests the
presence of metabolite-specific resistance mechanisms
[4,5]. Several fungal secondary metabolites have medical
applications - ranging from antibiotics to immunosuppressants. Thus, elucidation of the underlying molecular
mechanisms of self-resistance in producer fungi is of
great interest for biotechnological as well as health
applications. For example, efficient production of drugs
in a microbial cell factory may greatly depend on

increasing the tolerance of the host organism to the
drug. In the few published examples in eukaryotes, selfresistance to bioactive secondary metabolites has been
attributed to either presence of an enzyme modifying
the compound [6,7], export mechanisms [8,9], compartmentalization [10], or a few specific mutations in the
target enzyme [11]. In the case of MPA, the self-resistance mechanism has not been elucidated.
The MPA biosynthetic gene cluster from Penicillium
brevicompactum was identified only recently [12]. Interestingly, it turned out that the MPA gene cluster, in
addition to the MPA biosynthetic genes, contains a
putative IMPDH-encoding gene (mpaF). The study also
revealed an additional putative IMPDH-encoding gene
by probing the P. brevicompactum genomic DNA [12].
A BLAST search using mpaF as query resulted in only a
single IMPDH encoding gene per organism for all fully
sequenced non-Penicillium filamentous fungi (see the
Results and Discussion section for details). Thus, the
discovery of mpaF identifies P. brevicompactum as the
first filamentous fungus known to feature two IMPDH
encoding genes. In this study, we have identified additional species from the Penicillium subgenus Penicillium
that contain two putative IMPDH encoding genes.
Furthermore, we show that the two copies that are present in each fungus are dissimilar, and that one of them
forms a new distinct group in a cladistic analysis. The
IMPDH from the MPA cluster, mpaF, is the founding
member of this novel group. The presence of mpaF
within the biosynthesis cluster in P. brevicompactum
hints at a role in MPA self-resistance. In this study, we
examine this hypothesis and show that mpaF confers
resistance to MPA when expressed in an otherwise
highly sensitive non-producer fungus Aspergillus
nidulans.

Results and discussion
Expression of mpaF in A. nidulans confers resistance to
MPA

In order to investigate whether MpaFp from P. brevicompactum is resistant to MPA we transferred mpaF to
a fungus, A. nidulans, which does not produce MPA.

Specifically, we constructed a strain where the A. nidulans IMPDH structural gene (imdA) was replaced by the
coding region of mpaF, see Figure 2A. The sensitivity of
this strain towards MPA was then compared to a reference A. nidulans strain. As expected, the spot assays
shown in Figure 2 demonstrate that the germination of
WT spores is reduced due to MPA. This effect is most
significant at media containing 100 and 200 μg/ml MPA
where the viability is reduced by approximately two
orders of magnitude as compared to the plate containing no MPA. The level of sensitivity of A. nidulans
towards MPA is consistent with the toxic levels
observed for other eukaryotic organisms [13,14]. In

100 and 200 μg MPA/ml. Each row is composed of spots containing
plated spores ranging from ~106 (to the left) to ~10 (to the right)
as indicated in the figure.

contrast, MPA had little or no effect on spore viability
of the strain NID495 where the gene encoding A. nidulans IMPDH (imdA) has been replaced by mpaF.
Accordingly, we conclude that mpaF encodes an
IMPDH, which is functional and less sensitive to MPA
as compared to the IMPDH encoded by imdA. Notably,
this degree of resistance has previously been observed
only for IMPDH proteins of prokaryotic origin [1].
A new class of IMPDHs found in the Penicillium subgenus
Penicillium

The data above strongly suggest that mpaF encodes an
IMPDH, which is resistant to MPA, hence strengthening
the hypothesis that the IMPDH-encoding gene residing
within the MPA gene cluster plays a distinctive role in
MPA self-resistance. The results also lead to the next
question - whether only MPA producers have two
copies of IMPDH-encoding genes. We first performed a
BLASTx search (default settings, August 2010, see
Methods) by using the cDNA sequence of mpaF as a
query. Two IMPDH-encoding genes from Penicillium
chrysogenum, the only Penicillium species with a publicly available sequenced genome, produced the most
significant hits (data not shown). As P. chrysogenum is
not able to produce MPA, the presence of two IMPDHencoding genes in this fungus is intriguing. Interestingly,
the BLASTx search only revealed one IMPDH in the
other filamentous fungi that have their genome
sequence available in the public domain. Penicillium
marneffei, another Penicillium species included in the
search, was found to contain only one IMPDH-encoding
gene in its genome. However, even though P. marneffei
is named a Penicillium, it is only distantly related to
Penicillium sensu stricto [15]. Thus, the only two fungi
known to have two IMPDH copies so far are the Penicillium species, P. brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum.
An initial cladistic analysis showed that the P. brevicompactum IMPDH protein encoded by mpaF and one of
the two IMPDHs from P. chrysogenum are phylogenetically highly distinct from the other IMPDHs from filamentous fungi. Furthermore, the IMPDH-encoding gene

from P. brevicompactum that was not located within the
MPA gene cluster and one of the two IMPDH-encoding
genes from P. chrysogenum clustered together with the
IMPDH-encoding genes from Aspergillus species (data
not shown). Notably, this group was distinct from the
group containing mpaF. Accordingly, we decided to
name the original and mpaF types of IMPDH as
IMPDH-A and IMPDH-B, respectively. The classification of IMPDHs was further substantiated with IMPDH
sequences obtained from more Penicillium species as
described in the following.
P. brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum belong to
Penicillium subgenus Penicillium and are closely related
[16]. To investigate if the presence of two IMPDHs is a
general phenomenon in Penicillium subgenus Penicillium, we created degenerate primers designed to amplify
the genes coding for the two types of IMPDHs,
IMPDH-A and IMPDH-B. These primers were used to
amplify IMPDH-encoding genes by using gDNA from
four additional Penicillium strains as PCR templates
(Table 1). Interestingly, despite the fact that strains
tested included both MPA producers and non-producers, we found two IMPDH copies in all four strains
(Table 1). We then performed a cladistic analysis including these new genes, which showed that mpaF and its
orthologs clearly form a separate group (Figure 3).
Differences between IMPDH-A and IMPDH-B with a
potential role in MPA resistance

We created a full-length alignment of IMPDH protein
sequences from both MPA producers and non-producers to identify substitutions that might account for the
extraordinary MPA resistance observed for heterologously expressed P. brevicompactum mpaF (type
IMPDH-B). There are 30 residues known to be important for catalytic function and these are completely conserved in all IMPDHs identified at present [1]. All of the
30 residues, except for the one corresponding to position 415 (numbering follows MpaFp), were also conserved in IMPDH-B from both P. chrysogenum and P.
brevicompactum. The residue at position 415 is part of

the active site and was found to be phenylalanine in
both IMPDH-B sequences (Figure 4); whereas this position is featured by tyrosine in all IMPDH-A type proteins. In addition, when comparing IMPDH-A and
IMPDH-B sequences, the so-called IMPDH “flap-region”
[1] is variable including a five-residue-long gap in the
two IMPDH-Bs (Figure 4). Although these sequence differences may seem significant, they are not obvious candidates for conferring MPA resistance. The substitution
at position 415 is not in close proximity to the MPA
binding site and the sequence of the “flap-region” is

known to be highly variable and has so far not been
linked to MPA sensitivity [16]. Furthermore, P. chrysogenum is not a MPA producer and it is therefore not
self-evident that the IMPDH-B from this fungus is resistant. Additional IMPDH sequences from MPA producers and non-producers will be useful in the search for
the functionally critical residues. Moreover, comparative
biochemical characterization of IMPDH-A and IMPDHB, as well as of mutant derivatives, will be necessary to
quantify the degree of resistance, and to pinpoint the
residues important for MPA resistance. Such biochemical characterization, together with the measurement of
expression levels of IMPDH-A and IMPDH-B in MPA
producers, will help in dissecting the relative contribution of each type to MPA self-resistance.
IMPDH-B has possibly emerged through gene duplication

IMPDHs are highly conserved enzymes, which points
to their important role in fitness. A high level of conservation was also observed for the sequences obtained
from the six Penicillium strains investigated in our
study. In a cladogram containing both fungal and prokaryotic IMPDHs, the fungal genes of type IMPDH-B
clearly cluster with the fungal IMPDH-A type and not
the prokaryotic IMPDH-encoding genes (data not
shown). The identity of the IMPDH-B to prokaryotic
IMPDHs is ~30-35% on amino acid level. This relatively low degree of conservancy, combined with the
fact that IMPDH-A and IMPDH-B are ~80% identical
in filamentous fungi, suggests that the genes coding
for IMPDH-B arose by gene duplication in a filamentous fungus, rather than via a horizontal gene transfer
from a prokaryotic organism. As both IMPDH-A and
IMPDH-B classes are present in all Penicillium subgenus Penicillium strains tested, a gene duplication event
in Penicillium is a plausible hypothesis. To gather
further support for this hypothesis, b-tubulin
sequences were obtained for all of the fungi tested in
this study and a cladogram based on b-tubulin
sequences was calculated (Figure 3). As b-tubulin is a
highly conserved protein with a critical functional role
in eukaryotes, it is often used to create an organismal
cladogram [16,17]. The cladogram based on IMPDH
sequences is to a high degree in agreement with the btubulin cladogram, and both are in agreement with
previously published b-tubulin cladograms [16]. Based
on the observations from the cladograms and the high
level of identity (~80%) between IMPDH-B type and
IMPDH-A type sequences, we postulate that the
IMPDH-encoding gene duplication took place during
the divergence of Penicillium subgenus Penicillium, or
earlier. The large genome sequencing effort that is
being carried out at the moment may shed further
light on the evolutionary origin of IMPDH-B.

Conclusions
This is the first report elucidating the presence of a new
class of IMP dehydrogenase, IMPDH-B, with a role in
MPA resistance in filamentous fungi. The high level of
resistance observed for IMPDH-B encoded by mpaF
from P. brevicompactum is intriguing and stands as the
strongest MPA tolerance reported for a eukaryotic
IMPDH. Our study also provides insight into the possible molecular basis responsible for the high MPA resistance of IMPDH-B. In particular, we identified one
amino acid residue, which is completely conserved in all
previously identified IMPDHs, but which is different in
the members of the group belonging to the type
IMPDH-B. On the applied front, the identified genetic
basis for self-resistance may help in efficient production
of MPA in heterologous hosts and in understanding the
MPA-related chemical ecology in filamentous fungi.

for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles at 98°C for 30 s, an
annealing step ranging from 61°C (first cycle) to 54°C
(last cycle) for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s. PCR
mixture was made according to the manufacture’s
instructions. PCR products generated by degenerate

Cladistic analysis

BLASTx search was performed with standard settings:
‘blastp algorithm’, ‘expect threshold = 10’, ‘word size = 3’,
‘max matches in query range = 0’, ‘matrix = BLOSUM62’,
‘gap open cost = 11’, ‘gap extension cost = 1’, and no filters were used. Alignment of DNA coding regions were
performed with ClustalW [24] as implemented in the
CLC DNA workbench 5 (CLC bio, http://www.clcbio.
com/) and by using the following parameters: ‘gap open
cost = 20.0’, ‘gap extension cost = 1.0’, and ‘end gap cost
= free’. A cladogram was constructed with the same software using the neighbour-joining method and 1000 bootstrap replicates [25]. The DNA sequence of IMPDH and
b-tubulin from selected fungi with sequenced genome
were retrieved from NCBI. These included IMPDH
sequence from A. nidulans [GenBank:ANIA_10476],
Aspergillus terreus [GenBank:XM_001218149], Aspergillus niger [GenBank:XM_001391855], P. chrysogenum
putative IMPDH-A coding gene, [GenBank:
XM_002562313], putative IMPDH-B coding gene [GenBank:XM_002559146], P. marneffei [GenBank:
XM_002151867]. b-tubulin sequences from A. nidulans
[GenBank:XM_653694], A. terreus [GenBank:
XM_001215409], A. niger [GenBank:XM_001392399], P.
chrysogenum [GenBank:XM_002559715] and P. marneffei
[GenBank:XM_002151381]. The MPA gene cluster
sequence from P. brevicompactum, which contains the
IMPDH-B sequence (mpaF) is available from GenBank
under accession number [GenBank:HQ731031].
Protein alignment

Amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW [24]
as implemented in the CLC DNA workbench 5 (CLC
bio, http://www.clcbio.com/) by using the following
parameters: ‘gap open cost = 20.0’, ‘gap extension cost =
1.0’, and ‘end gap cost = free’.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

All sequences obtained via degenerate PCR were submitted to GenBank (Table 1). Penicillium bialowiezense
b-tubulin [GenBank:JF302653], putative IMPDH-A coding gene [GenBank:JF302658], putative IMPDH-B coding gene [GenBank:JF302662], P. brevicompactum btubulin [GenBank:JF302653], imdA [GenBank:JF302657],
