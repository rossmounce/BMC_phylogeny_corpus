Prevalence of blood parasites in seabirds - a
review
Petra Quillfeldt1*, Elena Arriero1, Javier Martínez2, Juan F Masello1 and Santiago Merino3

Abstract
Introduction: While blood parasites are common in many birds in the wild, some groups seem to be much less
affected. Seabirds, in particular, have often been reported free from blood parasites, even in the presence of
potential vectors.
Results: From a literature review of hemosporidian prevalence in seabirds, we collated a dataset of 60 species, in
which at least 15 individuals had been examined. These data were included in phylogenetically controlled
statistical analyses of hemosporidian prevalence in relation to ecological and life-history parameters. Haemoproteus
parasites were common in frigatebirds and gulls, while Hepatozoon occurred in albatrosses and storm petrels, and
Plasmodium mainly in penguins. The prevalence of Haemoproteus showed a geographical signal, being lower in
species with distribution towards polar environments. Interspecific differences in Plasmodium prevalence were
explained by variables that relate to the exposure to parasites, suggesting that prevalence is higher in burrow
nesters with long fledgling periods. Measures of Plasmodium, but not Haemoproteus prevalences were influenced
by the method, with PCR-based data resulting in higher prevalence estimates.
Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that, as in other avian taxa, phylogenetic, ecological and life-history parameters
determine the prevalence of hemosporidian parasites in seabirds. We discuss how these relationships should be
further explored in future studies.

Introduction
Birds are infected by a number of intracellular blood
parasites, including Haemosporidia of the genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, Haemogregarinidae of the genus Hepatozoon and Piroplasmida of
the genus Babesia. These blood parasites can exert
important selection pressure on their hosts through
effects on survival [1-3], on reproductive success [e.g.,
[4-8]], on plumage colouration [e.g., [9,10]], with important ecological and evolutionary consequences, such as
changes in community structure [e.g., [11]].
The rate of infection varies greatly among different
bird orders [e.g., [12,13]], but the reasons for the wide
taxonomic variation in parasite prevalence or diversity
are still poorly understood [14,15]. While some avian
taxa are heavily affected, apparent absence or scarcity of
blood parasites has been reported from others [see

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article

[16,17]], especially in avian groups such as seabirds [e.g.,
[18-22]], swifts [23], waders [24] and parrots [25].
In addition to the apparent phylogenetic bias in the
incidence of parasitic infections among bird taxa, there
is also some evidence that blood parasites are less common in certain habitats such as the Arctic tundra [e.g.,
[26]], arid environments [e.g., [27,28]], island environments [e.g.,[29]] or marine environments [e.g., [30-32]].
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this
absence [16], such as the absence or scarcity of proper
vectors, a highly specific association between host and
parasites with host switching being infrequent (hostparasite assemblage), host immunological capabilities
preventing infection by parasites, and competitive exclusion of blood parasite vectors mediated by ectoparasites.
A number of comparative studies have analysed patterns of blood parasite prevalence across bird taxa, with
the aim to understand how the selection pressure from
parasitism is linked to ecological and evolutionary traits
of their hosts [e.g. [3,14,15,33]]. In the present study, we
review information on blood parasites in seabirds. Using

phylogenetically controlled statistical analyses we tested
if blood parasite prevalence in seabirds is related to the
following factors: 1) historical/phylogenetic factors, 2)
life history parameters, and 3) ecological parameters.

Results
Literature review

From the 113 seabird species listed in Table 1, parasitic
infections by hematozoa were found in 31 species (27%).
This was similar to the percentage of infected species
reported in 60 species with at least 15 individuals
sampled (20 species or 33%, c2 = 0.18 d.f. 1, P = 0.669).
The prevalence of multiple infections was very low, as
only five host species were reported infected by more
than one parasite genus (Additional file 1: Table S1):
Fjordland crested penguin Eudyptes pachyrhynchus (2),
little penguin Eudyptula minor (2), African penguin
Spheniscus demersus (3), magnificent frigatebird Fregata
magnificens (2) and yellow-legged gull Larus cachinnans
(2). The other 25 species in which infections were found
only had a single kind of parasite. The proportion of
species infected differed between bird families (Table 1),
from complete absence in some groups such as cormorants (7 species studied), skuas (5 species) and auks (3
species) to 100% of species and populations infected in
frigatebirds (4 species studied so far). The average prevalence of haematozoa across all studies here reported
(N = 231 studies, or 6,656 adults and 1,143 chicks, see

Additional file 1: Table S1) was 8.5% (blood smears,
PCR and ELISA combined) or 5.7% (based on blood
smears only).
The occurrence of haemoparasites increased from
polar to tropical seabirds (c2 = 10.6, d.f. = 3, P = 0.031).
Blood parasites were absent from Antarctic and arctic
seabirds (N = 15 species). In the Sub-Antarctic islands,
5 of 21 seabird species (24%) studied were found to
have haemoparasites, while 18 of 57 temperate seabird
species (32%) and 11 of 25 tropical seabirds (44%) had
at least one record (see Additional file 1).
Phylogenetically controlled analysis

Figure 1 shows phylogenetic associations among species
in the study and the information on the presence of
parasites for those species. Even though visual inspection suggests phylogenetic clustering of the incidence of
parasitism among the different taxa of seabirds (Figure
1), the results of the phylogenetic autoregression analyses did not support this, as interspecific variation in
parasite prevalence of the main genera of haematozoa
was not explained by phylogenetic associations among
species (Haemoproteus: rho = -0.13, P = 0.292; Plasmodium: rho = -0.21, P = 0.649; Hepatozoon: rho = -1.52,
P = 0.729). Due to the low prevalence, it was not possible to include Babesia in this analysis.
We included the two most commonly observed parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus) into phylogenetically

Discussion
In the present study, we summarize the available information on the prevalence of haematozoa of the genera
Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, Hepatozoon
and Babesia in seabirds. As previously suggested [e.g.,
[18-21]], our review underlines that in general, the incidence of blood parasitic infections is low in seabirds
(Table 1 Additional file 1). The average prevalence of
haematozoa across all seabird species studied (Additional file 1: Table S1) was 8.7%, compared to 26% in a
sample of 14,812 European passerines [14].
Blood parasites and climate

Blood parasites were absent from all Antarctic and arctic seabirds, and the occurrence increased in milder climates. This finding is in line with previous studies [34]
that noted that blood parasites present in sub-Antarctic
islands were absent in Antarctica and suggested that
this mirrors the absence of suitable vectors in Antarctica
[19]. Latitudinal gradients in the prevalence of blood
parasites have also been found in other bird species [e.g.
[35]], and even in within-species patterns. For example,
shorebirds migrating through Europe were free from
infections while their conspecifics did show infections in
tropical Africa [36].

Haematozoa are transmitted to their vertebrate host
through arthropod vectors. Although still a great deal of
data about the biology and ecology of various vector
species is missing, some authors have suggested that the
limit of the distribution of vectors such as mosquitos
and sandflies corresponds to the 10°C annual isotherm
[e.g., [37]]. Furthermore, for species that hibernate at
the larval stage, the -1°C winter isotherm is decisive for
their distribution since larvae that freeze do not survive.
Thus, vectors would be absent at high latitudes, and
more common with higher temperatures, and this is
reflected in the distribution of blood parasites in the
seabird hosts. Within genera, the present analysis suggested that the prevalence, i.e. the percentage of individuals infected with Haemoproteus, was higher in species
in more tropical environments, but this was not the case
for Plasmodium. Given the relatively low detection
probability of Plasmodium based on blood smears, it is
possible that a geographical pattern is not apparent
unless more PCR based studies are undertaken. But differences in the biology of the vectors might also explain
this difference in the distributon of Haemoproteus and
Plasmodium. While Plasmodium is transferred by mosquitoes (Culicidae) and, at least in reptiles, also by sandflies (Psychodidae), Haemoproteus is transferred by louse
flies (Hippoboscidae) and biting midges (Ceratopogonidae). Some studies have shown an important effect of
temperature on activity and host location by these
insects [see [38,39]]. However, the identity of vectors is
unknown in most avian and, to our knowledge, all

seabird studies, and we can expect better insight into
parasite distribution from studies of arthropod vectors.
For example, ticks (Ixodidae) were generally thought to
be the vector for Hepatozoon, but one study indicated
that fleas can also serve as a vector [40].
Blood parasites and seabird phylogeny

The most common parasites found in seabirds were
Haemoproteus and Plasmodium (Additional file 1: Table
S1), similar to passeriformes [14]. Hepatozoon occurred
in albatrosses and storm petrels, and Plasmodium
mainly in penguins, while Haemoproteus were especially
common in frigatebirds and gulls (Table 1). In this context, it may be relevant that many gulls are adapted to
exploiting inland and human-modified or urban environments. These environments may harbour a higher
vector density than saline environments [31]. However,
the apparent difference among seabird families, though
not statistically significant, also suggests a role of immunocompetence in preventing Haemoproteus infection in
marine birds [16]. This possibility should be analyzed
again when data of more seabird species become available. Babesia was found in different unrelated seabird
species, suggesting the possibility that these infections
result from several independent colonization events [e.g.
[41]].
Blood parasites and life-history parameters

In line with the finding that avian Plasmodium and their
vectors are distributed worldwide except in extreme
habitats [12], the occurrence and prevalence of Plasmodium infections was independent from the host distribution. However, inter-specific differences were explained
by life-history variables that relate to the exposure to
parasites, with Plasmodium occurrence and prevalence
being higher in burrow nesters and occurrence also in
seabirds with long nestling periods (Table 3).
Studies in other avian taxa have also suggested that
exposure time to vectors is the main factor explaining
differences in malaria prevalence: Similar to the present
results, parasite species richness in 263 bird species
from the Western Palearctic was positively associated
with the duration of the nestling period [15]. Moreover,
the Plasmodium prevalence was associated with the
duration of the nestling period [15]. All these data may
be indicative of the need of a long exposure time to vectors in nests to allow infection by Plasmodium and/or
that infections by this parasite occur mainly during nestling stage or nest attending activities.
Moreover, adult shorebirds also showed higher malaria
prevalence, suggesting that infection probability
increases with cumulative exposure [36]. This is also
partially supported by the non-significant tendency for
infections being more frequent in birds foraging near-

Page 5 of 10

shore, as those expending more time in the vicinity of
land are probably more exposed to vectors. Habitat features related to vector availability are also important,
and have been used to explain higher or lower blood
parasite prevalences in species breeding in forested habitats [33,35,42].
We here found breeding habitat type (burrow) and
exposure time at the nest (fledging period) explaining
variation in Plasmodium but not Haemoproteus infections. This might reflect the habitat needs for the different vectors such as mosquitoes (Culicidae) and sandflies
(Psychodidae) for Plasmodium and louse flies (Hippoboscidae) and biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) in Haemoproteus. For example, sandfly larvae often inhabit
damp places containing organic matter such as cracks in
walls or rock and animal burrows, where they feed on
dead organic matter. Adults are blood suckers, but to
our knowledge, the actual vectors for Plasmodium infections in seabirds are not known, and other arthropod
larvae might have similar habitat requirements. The present analysis therefore strongly suggests that the vectors
of seabird blood parasites deserve further study if we are
to understand distribution patterns.
Previous phylogenetically controlled comparative studies have further identified body mass [14,15,43] and
embryonic development period [15,33] as explanatory
variables for parasite prevalence. The latter might be
due to enhanced immune performance in more slowly
developing birds with longer embryonic development
periods [44]. Although no such relationship was found
in the present study, the overall low prevalence across
the generally long-lived, slowly developing seabird taxa
strongly suggests that such a mechanism also works in
seabirds. It should also be noted that the relationship
was not found for any parasite genus analysed separately
in Western Paleartic birds [15].
Slightly different variables enter in the best-fit models
predicting interspecific variation in parasite impact in
seabirds, when the dependent variable is parasite prevalence (continuous variable) or the presence/absence of
infections (categorical variable). These differences might
be due to the fact that the analyses with the variable
presence/absence ignore variation among infected species (as they are all scored as 1), and also stress the
need for more data to obtain more robust patterns
across species. Alternatively, the differences might be
explained by traits concerning the life cycle of blood
parasites or their vectors, which deserve more study.

Conclusions
In summary, seabirds are long-lived with a relatively
slow-life history and low rates of haemoparasite infection. Partly owing to the scarcity of infection, no comparative information on parasite prevalences had been

Quillfeldt et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:26
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/26

reported so far for most seabird taxa. The present
results show that multiple factors are responsible for
patterns of association between parasitic infections and
ecological and life history traits in seabirds. Life history
parameters and ecological parameters that show some
correlation with parasite abundance seem to be associated to the abundance and/or life cycle requirements
of specific vectors. The findings on nesting habitat and
exposure time, in particular, are well in line with studies
across avian taxa. To better understand the underlying
ecological relationships, however, efforts are now needed
to identify the arthropod vectors and gain a better
knowledge of their distribution and biology.
Historical/phylogenetic factors also play a role, as indicated by the high prevalence of Haemoproteus in gulls
and frigatebirds, the apparent confinement of Hepatozoon to albatross and storm-petrel species, and the high
prevalence of Plasmodium in penguins. Studies of the
phylogentic relationships of these parasites will be
instructive in order to understand the evolution of such
host-parasite associations.

Methods
Literature review

In first reviews on infections by the main genera of haemoparasites in different bird species [45,46] as well as
later updates [e.g., [13,47]] no data on prevalence or
sample sizes were given, and many data from birds in
captivity were included. In our present review (Additional file 1), we included only data of studies on wildcaught birds. We checked all the original references for
this point, and references of birds of uncertain origin (e.
g. bird rescue stations) were not included. Prevalence of
current or past infections is measured as the proportion
of individuals infected with haematozoa, recorded either
by microscopic inspection of blood smears or by molecular methods that detect antibodies (ELISA) or genetic
material of the haematozoa (PCR).
In the last decade, numerous studies have focused in
molecular detection of blood parasitic infections in
birds, mainly by amplifying DNA of the parasite by PCR
[e.g., [22,48-50]], or by immunological detection of the
presence of specific antibodies by ELISA [e.g., [51]].
Although these techniques are more sensitive, especially
in detecting low intensity infections that may have
passed unnoticed by microscopy [e.g., [52]], the small
number of seabird species with molecular data available
to date, does not allow comparative analyses at a broad
taxonomic scale. However, we reviewed the existing literature in molecular detection of blood parasites in seabirds. There were only two cases (penguin species) that
we classified as having zero prevalence of blood parasites, but that have been reported as positive using
molecular techniques (Figure 1).

Phylogenetically controlled analysis
a) Variables and database

In the phylogenetically controlled comparative models,
we included life history and ecological variables that
could explain inter-specific differences in prevalence of
avian hematozoa. The variables we used were extracted
from those available in reviews on bird body masses
[53] and seabird biology [54]: (1) average body mass, (2)
ecological parameters: (a) distribution on a scale from 1
= polar to 9 = tropical, (b) nesting habits, as either “1”
for burrow or crevice nesters, or “0” for open nesters,
including open ground, cliff, marsh or tree nesters, (c)
foraging distribution on a scale from 0 = nearshore to 2
= offshore, and (3) Life-history parameters: (a) chick
developmental mode on a scale from 0 = altricial, 1 =
semialtricial, 2 = semiprecocial and 3 = precocial, (b)
maximum clutch size, (c) incubation period (days) and
(d) mean fledging period (days).
To control for the effect of sample size on the reliability of estimates of parasite prevalence, we restricted our
comparative analyses to species for which at least 15
individuals have been sampled for blood parasites, using
either blood smears [55], PCR, or both methods.
Three species (Silver gulls Larus novaehollandiae,
Dolphin gulls Larus scoresbii and Little Pied cormorants
Phalacrocorax melonoleucos) were excluded from the
analyses, as we could not find information on all life history parameters for the analyses for these species.
The timing of blood sampling can affect the observed
blood parasite prevalence in many species. Several
weeks or months after infection, blood parasites can
enter a latent stage, when the parasites disappear from
the peripheral blood, but can persist in the internal
organs. Relapses are usually synchronized with the
breeding period of birds [13]. As most seabirds can only
be accessed during the breeding season, the degree of
parasitemia is then expected to be highest.
b) Phylogeny

We constructed a phylogenetic tree using published
information on phylogenetic associations among the
species of our study, in particular for Neoaves [56,57],
for Sphenisciformes [58], for Procellariiformes [59-63],
for Phaethontidae [64], for Pelecaniformes [65-68] and
for Charadriiformes [69-77].
Because we used information from different sources
and the branch lengths were not specified in all studies
we used to reconstruct the phylogeny, we conducted all
analyses with a tree of equal branch lengths, which
assumes a punctuational model of evolution [78]. The
software MESQUITE [79] was used to construct the
phylogenetic tree (see tree topology in Figure 1).
c) Statistical analyses

We included all available data (from blood smears and
PCR data) for each species with at least 15 sampled

Quillfeldt et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:26
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/26

individuals. Parasite prevalences were arsin-square root
transformed, while the variables body mass, clutch size,
incubation and nestling period were log10-transformed.
To control for allometric effects on parasite prevalence,
average adult body mass for the species (obtained from
the literature) was included in all analyses as a predictor
variable. Evolutionary models were tested by Generalized Least Squares models fitted by REML, incorporating phylogenetic information with a Brownian motion
correlation structure, and method (smears vs. PCR) as a
variable. Model selection was based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). All analyses were repeated using
parasite prevalence as a categorical variable (presence/
absence) in phylogenetically informed Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models [80]. To estimate parameters of character evolution and the proportion of
variance in parasite prevalence explained by phylogenetic associations among species, we computed phylogenetic autorregressions and calculated Moran’s
autocorrelation Index [81]. We used R 2.11.1 (R Development Core Team 2010) and the package “ape” [82]
for the analyses.
