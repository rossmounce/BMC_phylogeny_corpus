Abstract
Background: The unique properties of wheat flour primarily depend on gluten, which is the most
important source of protein for human being. γ-Gliadins have been considered to be the most
ancient of the wheat gluten family. The complex family structure of γ-gliadins complicates the
determination of their function. Moreover, γ-gliadins contain several sets of celiac disease epitopes.
However, no systematic research has been conducted yet.
Results: A total of 170 γ-gliadin genes were isolated from common wheat and its closely related
species, among which 138 sequences are putatively functional. The ORF lengths of these sequences
range from 678 to 1089 bp, and the repetitive region is mainly responsible for the size
heterogeneity of γ-gliadins. The repeat motif P(Q/L/S/T/I/V/R/A)F(S/Y/V/Q/I/C/L)P(R/L/S/T/H/C/
Y)Q1–2(P(S/L/T/A/F/H)QQ)1–2is repeated from 7 to 22 times. Sequence polymorphism and linkage
disequilibrium analyses show that γ-gliadins are highly diverse. Phylogenic analyses indicate that
there is no obvious discrimination between Sitopsis and Ae. tauschii at the Gli-1 loci, compared with
diploid wheat. According to the number and placement of cysteine residues, we defined nine
cysteine patterns and 17 subgroups. Alternatively, we classified γ-gliadins into two types based on
the length of repetitive domain. Amino acid composition analyses indicate that there is a wide range
of essential amino acids in γ-gliadins, and those γ-gliadins from subgroup SG-10 and SG-12 and γgliadins with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional. A screening of toxic epitopes shows
that γ-gliadins with a pattern of C9 and γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain almost lack any
epitopes.
Conclusion: γ-Gliadin sequences in wheat and closely related Aegilops species are diverse. Each
group/subgroup contributes differently to nutritional quality and epitope content. It is suggested
that the genes with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional and valuable. Therefore, it is
possible to breed wheat varieties, the γ-gliadins of which are less, even non-toxic and more
nutritional.

Background
The unique properties of wheat flour primarily depend on
seed storage proteins, which mainly consist of gluten [1].
Gluten is glutamine and proline-rich proteins, having a
storage function of nitrogen and sulphur. Gluten is traditionally classified into low molecular weight (LMW) glutenins, high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins and the
large gliadin group [2]. Gliadins are mainly monomeric
proteins of 30–78 kD with poor solubility in dilute salt
solutions, and good solubility in 70% ethanol [3]. The
gliadins are composed of α-, γ- and ω-types [4]. HMW-glutenin genes locate at the long arms of group 1 chromosomes (Glu-1 loci) [5]. The α-gliadins are encoded by the
Gli-2 loci on the short arms of group 6 chromosomes. The
γ-gliadins and ω-gliadins are encoded by the Gli-1 loci on
the short arms of homeologous chromosome 1, and are
tightly linked to the Glu-3 loci coding for LMW-glutenins
[6-8].
Gluten is the most important source of protein for human
being, and a wide diversity of food has been developed to
take advantage of the properties (i.e. mixing characteristics, dough rheology and baking performance) of wheat
flour. It is reported that visco-elastic properties of wheat
are affected by the proportions of gluten polymers, and
that allelic variation in the composition of the HMW-glutenins is strongly correlated with differences in the breadmaking quality [2,9]. Although gliadins comprise of 40–
50% of total endosperm storage proteins in wheat, their
roles in determining the properties of wheat flour are not
well understood yet. The complex family structure of gliadins, compared to HMW-glutenin, complicates the determination of their function. The estimated copy number
for γ-gliadin genes is between 15 and 40 in Triticum aestivum cv 'Chinese Spring' [10]. Classification based on their
primary structure would facilitate further functional studies. γ-Gliadin genes have previously been divided into
three hybridization classes [11]. Pistón et al. [12] classified γ-gliadin genes into four groups based on the phylogenic analysis.
Celiac disease (CD), a widely prevalent autoimmune disease of the small intestine (above 1:200 in most population groups), is induced in susceptible individuals by
exposure to dietary gluten [13]. However, given the enormous biological diversity and unique chemistry of gluten,
and the absence of satisfactory assays for gluten toxicity,
the structural basis for gluten toxicity in CD remains
unclear [14]. It has been shown that some native gluten
sequences can bind to HLA-DQ2/8 and induce T cell
responses. In addition, modification of gluten peptides by
the enzyme transglutaminase results in high affinity HLADQ2/8 binding peptides that can induce T cell responses
[15,16]. The principal toxic components of wheat gluten

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/168

are gliadins. γ-Gliadins contain several sets of celiac disease epitopes [17].
The γ-gliadins have been considered to be the most
ancient members of the wheat gluten family [18].
Sequence information for γ-gliadin genes in GenBank
includes 34 complete/nearly complete open reading
frame (ORF) and 66 partial sequences. These sequences
come from various wheat and Aegilops species. However,
no systematic research has been conducted yet.
We have performed an extensive and comparative analysis
of γ-gliadin genes from common wheat and its closely
related species in order to classify the γ-gliadin genes, and
to investigate the diversity of the CD epitopes and nutritional quality of each γ-gliadin group. This study clarifies
our understanding of the evolution of the multigene family.

Results

A total of 170 γ-gliadin genes were isolated from common
wheat and its closely related species (Table 1). There is no
indication of introns interrupting the coding region (Figure 1). Thirty-two of these sequences are pseudogenes, all
of which contain one or more internal stop codons or
frameshift mutations caused by single nucleotide indels
(insertions/deletions). The remaining 138 sequences are
putatively functional, with no internal stop codons.
Sequence polymorphism
ORF lengths of these sequences range from 678 to 1089
bp. It is notable that FJ006717 amplified from Ae. sharonesis is the shortest γ-gliadin gene so far reported (678 bp),
whose repetitive region has 46 amino acid residues.
FJ006692 and FJ006695 isolated from Ae. speltoides are
the longest (1089 bp), containing 179 amino acid in their
repetitive regions.

ORF lengths of the sequences derived from Ae. sharonesis
are the most variable (678–1020 bp), while the sequences
from T. monococcum ssp.aegilopoides are the most conserved in length. Lengths of the repetitive region (domain
II) of these sequences vary greatly as well (138–537 bp)
(Table 2). The lengths of ORF and the repetitive region
were analyzed for difference on average. It is shown that
they have a similar changing trend. Considering the
sequence alignment result, it could be concluded that the
repetitive region is mainly responsible for the size heterogeneity of the γ-gliadins.
Table 3 shows the three estimates of genetic diversity.
Haplotype diversity is very high, with a range from 0.909
± 0.079 in Ae. longissima to 1.000 ± 0.030 in T. turgidum.
Estimates of π vary from 0.01522 ± 0.00981 in T. monococcum ssp. monococcum to 0.08129 ± 0.00484 in T. aestivum.

T. aestivum originated from the hybridization between T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii, followed by genome duplication. T. turgidum evolved from T.
dicoccoides that was formed in the intercrossing between T. urartu and Ae. speltoides (closely relates to the B genome). T. monococcum was one
representative of the A genome as well. The other four species of Sitopsis were used as relatives to Ae. speltoides; SHW = synthetic hexaploid wheat;
aegilopoides = T. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides; monococcum = T. monococcum ssp. monococcum.

Estimates of θw range from 0.02584 ± 0.00336 in T. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides to 0.08053 ± 0.00584 in T. dicoccoides. θw and π show different trends in the rank of their
values.
Table 3 also shows the result of neutrality test. Tajima's D
is negative in most species except for Ae. bicornis and Ae.
longissima. Three species/subspecies of diploid wheat
show a significant negative Tajima's D due to an excess of
variants, which indicates that they significantly departure
from an equilibrium neutral model. Fu and Li' D is negative among eight species. The same three species show a
significant excess of mutations.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and recombination
LD between γ-gliadin sequences in different genomes
could be estimated by ZnS, which has a range from 0
(equilibrium) to 1 (disequilibrium). The values of ZnS are

in a wide range (Table 3). The highest is 0.7418 in T.
monococcum ssp. aegilopoides, and the lowest is 0.1109 in T.
aestivum. However, there is a high level of LD in γ-gliadin
family. A measure of the minimum number of recombination events for these data yields a range of 0–19.
Repetitive region
The repetitive domain is long (encompassing about 45%
of total γ-gliadins) and consists of regular short repeats
(see Additional file 1). Multiple sequence alignment indicates that the two end of this domain are conserved, and
the changes mainly caused by SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism). The internal part is highly variable, mainly
resulting from repeat insertions/deletions. These repeat
domains have been evolving rapidly, and should not be
used as a basis for determining relatedness [19]. To investigate whether the repetitive regions are related to the
genomic origin of γ-gliadin genes, the nucleotide

Model structure of γ-gliadins
Model structure of γ-gliadins. The amino acid sequence starts with a 20-residue signal peptide, followed by a short N-terminal non-repetitive domain (I), a highly variable repetitive domain (II), a non-repetitive domain containing most of the cysteine
residues (III), a glutamine-rich region (IV), and the C-terminal non-repetitive domain containing the final two conserved
cysteine residues (V). All the eight conserved cysteine residues form intramolecular disulphide bonds.

sequences of this domain were used to carry out the phylogenic analysis. The great majority of the sequences from
diploid wheat and Aegilops species show a clustering
according to their genomic origins (data not shown).
Therefore, it would be much better if the repetitive
domains were used in the relatedness analysis.

The phylogenic analysis facilitates us to array peptide
repeat pattern in parallel. The reported typical unit of γgliadins is PFPQ1–2(PQQ)1–2 [19]. Our consensus repeat
motif is similar to it, and modified by the substitution of

initial and final repeat motifs do not fit the consensus
motif but are included since they appear to be related to
the consensus [19]. The unit is repeated from 7 to 22
times and interspersed by additional residue(s).
Relatedness of γ-gliadin genes
Firstly, the γ-gliadin genes cloned from T. urartu, Ae.
speltoides and Ae. tauschii were used to carry out the phylogenic analysis (see Additional File 2). It contains three
subtrees and shows a clear clustering of these γ-gliadin
genes according to their genomic origins. Exceptions are
some genes from Ae. speltoides and Ae. tauschii. Secondly,
to gain a further insight into the relationship between γgliadin genes from different genomes, we included the γgliadin sequences from the two subspecies of T. monococcum and other four Sitopsis species i.e. Ae. sharonesis, Ae.
bicornis, Ae. longissima and Ae. searsii (Table 1) into the
phylogenic analysis. They cover all the diploid species that
represent the ancestral genomes of T. aestivum. Inclusion
of these sequences does not alter the fundamental structure of the phylogenic tree, and continues to strongly support the division of the three subtrees. For a clear
arrangement, we have chosen all the γ-gliadin genes from
Ae. speltoides and Ae. tauschii, and randomly selected three
sequences from each of the other diploid species to create
a phylogenic tree (Figure 2). The presence of strongly supported mixed subtrees indicates that there is no obvious
discrimination between Gli-D1 and Gli-S1 loci, compared
with Gli-A1. Furthermore, the sequences from the five
Sitopsis species could not be clearly distinguished in the
two subtrees.

To assess the phylogenic relationship among the γ-gliadin
genes from tetraploid wheat, we aligned the sequences of
diploid and tetraploid species, and constructed dendrograms. The γ-gliadin sequences that clustered together
with the sequences from diploid wheat (96% bootstrap;
cluster I) should be closely related to the A genome (see
Additional File 3). The sequences that fall in cluster II are
supposed to locate at the Gli-B1 locus of tetraploid wheat.
It is interesting that the eleven γ-gliadin sequences of T.
dicoccoides exactly clustered together with those of Ae.
tauschii in a small cluster (98% bootstrap), which confirms the close relationship between the Gli-S1 (Gli-B1)
and Gli-D1 loci. Using the characteristics of clusters
described above, we could only identify the sequences
relating to the A genome (cluster I; see Additional File 4)
among those cloned from hexaploid wheat.
Cysteine and Classification
The deduced amino acid peptides of the 169 putatively
functional γ-gliadin genes (Table 1 and Table 4) were analyzed for differences in the number and placement of
cysteine residues [12,19-28]. Most of the peptides (116/
169) contain eight cysteine residues that form four

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/168

intramolecular disulphide bonds [29]. The eight cysteine
residues are located following a conserved pattern (Figure
1) [19], where the fourth and fifth cysteines are consecutive in the polypeptide chain. Fifty-three γ-gliadins show
modified patterns of cysteine distribution either by adding/deleting cysteine residues or changing their relative
locations (Table 5; Figure 3), among which 1, 45 and 7
peptides contain 10, 9 and 7 cysteine residues, respectively. Differences in the number of cysteine among γ-gliadins are likely to result from point mutations, which
involve CGC-TGC, TCC-TGC, TAC-TGC, TTC-TGC, GGTTGT and TCG-TGC. Besides the number of cysteine, the
main difference among the nine patterns resides in the
presence of the first cysteine residue either in the nonrepetitive region or nearer along in the repetitive domain.
It is notable that AJ937838 has an additional cysteine in
the glutamine-rich region.
Using the number of cysteine residues as a discrimination
factor, we classified the 169 putatively functional γ-gliadin
genes into four groups, i.e. C7, C8, C9 and C10 (Table 5).
Forty-five sequences of C9 share a high identity (88.93%).
A comparison of the relative position of cysteine residues
within each group allows to define respectively four, one,
three and one cysteine distribution patterns within C7,
C8, C9 and C10 (Figure 3). Those patterns with fewer than
five members are directly recognized as subgroups (Table
5). Phylogenic analyses of the deduced mature proteins of
the members of pattern C9-P4 and C8-P5 indicate that
C9-P4 and C8-P5 should be grouped into four and six
subgroups, respectively (see Additional Files 5 and 6).
Accordingly, we have totally defined 17 γ-gliadin subgroups. The frequencies of the 17 subgroups among the
wheat and Aegilops accessions (Table 1) are shown in
Additional file 7. The γ-gliadins of each accession prefer to
fall into one or two subgroups.
Amino acid composition
The proportion of each amino acid differs significantly in
γ-gliadins. γ-Gliadins are rich in Gln (33.40%) and Pro
(16.64%), followed by Leu (6.59%), and show a 20:10:3
ratio of Q:P:F for total amino acids. Essential amino acids
are indispensable for good health, but cannot be synthesized in the body and must be supplied in the diet. There
are eight (Trp, Lys, Met, Thr, Phe, Val, Ile and Leu) out of
the 20 naturally occurring amino acids considered essential for humans. One of the problems with wheat flour is
that they do not provide enough essential amino acids,
which is mainly caused by the lack of essential amino
acids in seed storage proteins. We analyzed the proportions of the eight essential amino acids in each of the
deduced mature γ-gliadin peptides. A wide range of the
proportion of each essential amino acid has been
observed. The limiting amino acid (the essential amino
acid found in the smallest quantity in the foodstuff) in

wheat is Lys. Its average proportion is 0.69%, with a range
of 0.29–1.90%. The values are a little higher than those of
Trp (average 0.65%; range 0.00–1.75%). The average proportions of Met, Thr, Phe, Val, Ile and Leu are 1.93%,
2.38%, 4.95%, 5.04%, 5.39% and 6.59%, respectively,
which range from 1.10–2.88%, 0.83–4.24%, 2.38–
6.01%, 3.89–7.37%, 3.51–7.56% and 5.30–9.13%,
respectively.
The repetitive domain is long and variable, consisting
mostly of Gln (48.10%), Pro (27.53%) and Phe (9.36%).
This domain has a different Q:P:F ratio (5:3:1). To provide
more information for wheat breeding, we analyzed the
essential amino acid proportions of mature γ-gliadin peptides while ignoring the repetitive domain (The nucleotide sequences left are about 530 bp). The average
proportions of six out of the eight essential amino acids
significantly increase up (see Additional file 8; t test, P <
0.05). Exceptions are Thr and Phe. Eighteen γ-gliadin
sequences (belonging to nine subgroups) whose repetitive domains contain fewer than 85 amino acid residues
(Table 6) were selected for additional comparison against
the whole group. Compared with the other two sets of values (see Additional file 8), theirs are intermediate.

Compared to the essential amino acid proportions of the
sequences with a long repetitive domain, the most γ-gliadins with fewer than 85 residues in the repetitive domain
contain a higher proportion of total essential amino acids
and Lys (see Additional file 9). However, it is noticeable
that the corresponding proportions of some γ-gliadins
with a long repetitive domain are high as well. We determined the corresponding subgroups of each γ-gliadin
(either total proportion of essential amino acid ≥ 29% or
the amount of Lys ≥ 1%). Analysis indicated that these γgliadins tend to be the members of certain groups, such as
SG-10 and SG-12 (Table 5).
Analysis of CD toxic epitopes in γ-gliadins
The perfect matches in the 169 putatively functional genes
to the three CD-toxic epitopes of γ-gliadins [17] are shown
in Table 7. Each epitope appears at most once in every
sequence, and all of them located at the repetitive
domain. The result indicates that those subgroups or species contribute differently to the epitope content. Firstly,
more γ-gliadins from T. aestivum, Ae. longissima and Ae.
bicornis contain CD toxic peptides. Secondly, 23
sequences altogether contain these epitopes. The epitopes
are present in seven subgroups (SG-7 (ratio = 2/6); SG-9

(4/4) SG-17 (1/1)). However, a majority of them (16/23)
are members of C8. Five out of seven members of C7 contain the toxic peptides. Only two out of the 45 sequences
of C9 contain the toxic epitopes. One (FJ006591) of the
18 γ-gliadins with fewer than 85 residues in the repetitive
domain contain a toxic epitope. Finally, occurrences of
the three epitopes are at the frequencies of 18/169, 19/
169 and 11/169, respectively.
A further look at the sequences reveals that amino acid
change(s) in particular epitopes caused by SNP disrupt the
continuous peptides. Forty-one analogues of epitopes are
shown in Additional file 10. Substitutions of amino acid
often concern glutamine and proline residue. Amino acid

insertions and deletions also occur frequently, which
destroy the epitopes (data not shown).

Discussion

Diversity of γ-gliadin sequences
Sequence diversity between the γ-gliadin genes is due to
SNPs and variations in the repetitive region, and the latter
is mainly responsible for the size heterogeneity of the γgliadins [11,19]. It is comparatively confirmed by our
result. Nucleotide diversity (θw and π) was estimated to
be lower in self-pollinated diploid wheat than open-pollinated Aegilops species (Table 3). Besides the large number
of segregating sites and mutations, haplotype diversity of
γ-gliadin genes is high in every species investigated, which
indicates a high nucleotide diversity of γ-gliadin family.

the patterns P1 to P9, respectively (Table 5).

Extensive linkage disequilibrium found with different
species indicates similar ancestries between freely recombining portions of Gli-1 loci. Negative values of the neutrality test statistics (Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D) in most
species suggest that they are mainly under negative selection. Overall, Gli-1 loci in different species are diverse,
although γ-gliadin is supposed to be the most ancient
family among prolamins [18].

Evolution of γ-gliadin multigene family
To avoid PCR bias, two forward and two reverse primers
are used to amplify the full ORF of γ-gliadin genes. As a
result, we isolated 29 unique γ-gliadin genes from T. aestivum cv 'Chinese Spring'. Meanwhile, nine to 14 unique
genes were cloned from the nine diploid wheat and
Aegilops species, respectively, with an average of 11 (Table
1). There are 15 to 40 copies of γ-gliadin genes in Chinese

Spring [10]. Considering the copy number, it can be concluded that the γ-gliadin sequences we cloned could represent the whole γ-gliadin family. Multiplication of γgliadin genes should have occurred in the diploid level,
since a large number of γ-gliadin genes have been isolated
from a few accessions, which is similar to the result on αgliadin genes [30].
The number of γ-gliadin sequences cloned from two accessions of T. dicoccoides and AS2255 of T. turgidum are 9, 7

and 13, respectively. It seems likely that tetraploid wheat
went through a bottleneck in Gli-1 loci, which is supported by the small copy numbers compared with those
of common wheat and diploid species. We could conclude that great changes happened to the Gli-1 regions in
the formation of tetraploid wheat. It is possible that some
γ-gliadin sequences disappeared from the genome. It is
interesting to note that similar event seems not occur during the formation of T. aestivum. Experimental data, based
on the simulation of the evolutionary step by synthetic

hexaploid wheat (SHW-L1) and its parental lines (T. turgidum accession AS2255 and Ae. tauschii accession AS60),
supports the assumption of γ-gliadin sequences disappearance. Therefore, duplication and subsequent divergence might be important as well at the polyploid level in
contrast to the diploid strains.
Pseudogenes are involved in phylogenic analysis, and
they fall into correct clusters, which indicate that the
occurrence of pseudogenes should have take place after
the divergence of diploid species.
Classification
It is the primary structure of peptides that finally determines very specific properties of the ending biomaterials
[31]. The structures are important to dough rheology and
other aspects of food technology [32]. According to the
characteristics of primary structure, i.e. number and placement of cysteine residues and the phylogenic result, we
divided γ-gliadins into 17 subgroups based on the mature
peptides (without signal peptide) (Table 5). The different
subfamilies are very distinct from each other. The classification of γ-gliadins has essential importance with regard
to dough quality, since cysteine residues play a critical role
in unique properties of wheat flour. Typical γ-gliadins
contain eight cysteine residues. We have also found γ-gliadins containing seven, nine and even ten cysteine residues. Furthermore, we identified nine cysteine
distribution patterns. Changes in position and number of
cysteine residues might affect the pattern of disulphide
bond formation, resulting in failure of forming some
intramolecular disulphide bond(s). These cysteine residues would then be available for intermolecular disulphide bond formation and polymer-building [33].
However, we have not known whether these gliadins are
chain terminator (only one cysteine residue available for
intermolecular disulphide) or chain extenders (subunits
with more than one cysteine residues that form intermolecular disulphide bonds), which would presumably
have a negative effect on flour quality or allow the formation of stronger dough, respectively [34,35].

Alternatively, we classified γ-gliadins into two types: i.e.
repetitive domain<85 amino acids and repetitive domain
≥ 85 amino acids, which are named as sequences with a
short repetitive domain (18 sequences) and sequences
with a long repetitive domain (151 sequences) respectively. The repetitive domain is rich in glutamine and proline, which is the major sequence variation that
discriminates the different γ-gliadins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/168

Therefore, a balance of essential amino acids is necessary
for a high degree of net protein utilization (the mass ratio
of amino acids converted to proteins: amino acids supplied). The net protein utilization is profoundly affected
by the limiting amino acid proportion (the essential
amino acid found in the smallest quantity in the foodstuff). The limiting amino acid of wheat is lysine, which
mainly caused by a low level of lysine in gliadin [36],
since gliadins account for about half of the total storage
proteins [3]. We systematically analyzed the proportions
of eight essential amino acids of γ-gliadins, which indicates that subgroup SG-10 and SG-12 and the γ-gliadins
with a short repetitive domain contain higher proportions
of lysine and total essential amino acids. A wide range of
the proportion of each essential amino acid could be seen,
which provides the possibility of breeding more nutritional wheat varieties.
Perspective for wheat breeding programs
The only efficient therapy for CD is a life-long gluten-free
diet. Conceivably, a diet based on gluten from a wheat
species that expresses no or few T-cell stimulatory gluten
peptides should be equally well tolerated by the celiac
patients and, importantly, also be beneficial for disease
prevention [37,38]. It is also indicated that the genetic differences in gliadins might allow designing strategies for
selection and breeding of less toxic wheat varieties
[[30,37] and [38]]. Our results indicate that 23 out of the
169 putatively functional sequences contain γ-gliadin
epitopes, and that γ-gliadins with a short repetitive
domain almost contain no toxic epitopes, with the exception of FJ006591. Meanwhile, 22 sequences out of those
with a long repetitive domain contain γ-gliadin epitopes.
Obviously, the classification depending on the length of
repetitive domain is reflected in the occurrence of toxic
epitopes. CD-toxic peptides of γ-gliadins are only found in
the repetitive domain, especially the internal part, which
is highly variable in length. Those γ-gliadins with a short
repetitive domain contain a brief internal part, which
means that they are not/nearly not toxic to the population
with celiac disease. The two subgroups SG-10 and SG-12,
which show a relatively good nutritional quality, present
four (4/12) and five (5/34) members containing epitopes.
Therefore, it is suggested that the genes with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional and valuable. It is
reported that stimulatory epitopes in α-gliadins from the
D genome is the highest, compared to those from the A
and B genome [30,38]. However, we have not found any
epitope in the γ-gliadins from Ae. tauschii (Table 7).

Conclusion

Nutritional quality
It is well known that nutritional quality of food that lack
essential amino acids is low, as the body tends to convert
the amino acids obtained into fats and carbohydrates.

We systematically characterized the γ-gliadin multigene
family in common wheat and its closely related tetraploid
and diploid species. It is shown that γ-gliadin family is
highly diverse. Phylogenic analyses indicate a more close

relationship between the Gli-1 loci of the B(S) and D
genomes. According to the differences in primary structure, we have classified γ-gliadins into 17 subgroups,
which might reflect their differences in the contributions
to the processing qualities of wheat flour. The γ-gliadins
with a short repetitive domain are relatively more nutritional, since they contain a higher proportion of essential
amino acids. Moreover, these short γ-gliadins almost contain no toxic epitopes. Therefore, it is possible to breed
wheat varieties, the γ-gliadins of which are less, even nontoxic and more nutritional.

Methods
Plant materials and DNA extraction
T. aestivum cv. 'Chinese Spring' (CS) and its closely related
wheat and Aegilops species (Table 1), one synthetic hexaploid wheat accession (SHW-L1; in the 3rd–4th generations) and its parental Ae. tauschii (AS60) and T. turgidum
ssp.turgidum (AS2255) lines were used.

Genomic DNA was extracted from leaves of single adult
plants with a CTAB (Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide)
protocol [39].
Primer design
The PCR primers to isolate γ-gliadin genes from genomic
DNA were designed on the conserved parts of the 5' and
3' flanking sequences of γ-gliadin genes retrieved from
Genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, which are listed
as follows:

Forward1: 5'-TATTAGTTAACGCAAATCCACC/TATG-3'
Forward2: 5'-CTTCACACAACTAGAGCACAAG-3'

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/168

tent E. coli (JM109) cells. Positive colonies were screened
out and sequenced by commercial company (Invitrogen).
DNA sequence analysis
Sequenced clones were confirmed by Blast analysis http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, and aligned using DNAman
(version5.2.2; Lynnon Biosoft), Clustal X (version 1.81)
[40] and MEGA (version 3.1) [41]. Further modifications
to the alignment were done manually. Bootstrap test of
phylogenies (1000 replicates; neighbor-joining method)
were carried out using MEGA for the nucleotide sequences
from initial codon (ATG) to mature stop codon (TGA), on
the basis of Kimura 2-parameter distances, complete deletion of gaps. Neighbor-joining trees (1000 replicates)
were also constructed for classification of mature proteins
on the basis of poisson correction, complete deletion of
gaps.

Nucleotide diversity was estimated with three approaches.
Indels were excluded from the estimates. The first method
used the number of haplotypes to estimate heterozygosity
[42]. The second approach used the average number of
nucleotide differences per site between two sequences (π)
[42]. The last method used the number of segregating sites
to estimate nucleotide diversity per site (θw) [42]. The
strength of linkage disequilibrium (LD) was estimated
using the ZnS statistic [43], which is the average of r2
(squared correlation coefficient) [44] over all pairwise
comparisons. Furthermore, Sequence data analysis (minimum number of recombination events (Rm) [45] and a
statistical test of neutrality (Tajima's D and Fu and Li's D)
[46,47]) were performed as well. Coalescent simulations
were used to test for significant differences [48,49]. DnaSP
version 4.50.3 [50] software package was used to complete these analyses.
