Abstract
Background: In yeast, birds and mammals, the SAPK-interacting protein 1 (Sin1) gene product has
been implicated as a component of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) signal transduction
pathway. Recently, Sin1 has also been shown to interact with the carboxyl terminal end of the
cytoplasmic domain of the ovine type I interferon receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2). However, the
function of Sin1 remains unknown. Since SAPK pathways are ancient and the IFN system is confined
to vertebrates, the organization of the Sin1 gene and the sequences of the Sin1 protein have been
compared across a wide taxonomic range of species.
Results: Sin1 is represented, apparently as a single gene, in all metazoan species and fungi but is
not detectable in protozoa, prokaryotes, or plants. Sin1 is highly conserved in vertebrates (79–99%
identity at amino acid level), which possess an interferon system, suggesting that it has been
subjected to powerful evolutionary constraint that has limited its diversification.
Sin1 possesses at least two unique sequences in its IFNAR2-interacting region that are not
represented in insects and other invertebrates. Sequence alignment between vertebrates and
insects revealed five Sin1 strongly conserved domains (SCDs I-V), but an analysis of any of these
domains failed to identify known functional protein motifs. SCD III, which is approximately 129
amino acids in length, is particularly highly conserved and is present in all the species examined,
suggesting a conserved function from fungi to mammals. The coding region of the vertebrate Sin1
gene encompasses 11 exon and 10 introns, while in C. elegans the gene consists of 10 exons and 9
introns organized distinctly from those of vertebrates. In yeast and insects, Sin1 is intronless.
Conclusions: The study reveals the phylogeny of a little studied gene which has recently been
implicated in two important signal transduction pathways, one ancient (stress response), one
relatively new (interferon signaling).

Background
Sin1 was originally described as a human protein that

modulated Ras function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1].
Strains of yeast that expressed the constitutively activated

RAS2Val 19 mutation had elevated levels of cyclic AMP,
impaired growth control and were acutely sensitive to
heat shock. This phenotype was reversed when the yeast
strain was transfected with a cDNA (clone JC310) that
encoded a then unknown protein. Although the authors
suggested that the inferred interaction between the JC310
product and RAS might be fortuitous, they favored the
possibility that that the unknown protein either was a true
inhibitor of RAS or that it was a RAS target protein, which
when over-expressed, had a protective action. A S. cerevisiae protein encoded by the AVO1 gene showed distant
similarity the human JC310 product [2,3].
Approximately eight years after the identification of JC310
it was again identified, on this occasion in a yeast twohybrid screen of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe cDNA library
as a 665 amino acid protein that bound via polypeptide
sequences in its C-terminal 244 amino acids to the Sty1/
Spc1, stress activated MAP kinase (SAPK) [2]. A fission
yeast strain lacking the Sin1 gene was sterile, sensitive to
multiple types of stress, including heat shock, and had
delayed cell cycles compared to a parental strain. Sin1
acted downstream of activated Sty1/Spc1 and appeared to
be necessary for normal function of the transcription factor Atf1, a homolog of human ATF2. Wilkinson et al. [2]
found that an apparent full length homolog of Sin1 from
chicken allowed the heat sensitive strain of S. pombe to
grow at 37°C, albeit very poorly. Moreover, fusion of the
first 486 amino acids of yeast Sin1 (which does not restore
growth) with the C-terminal 182 amino acids of the
chicken Sin1 sequence protected against heat shock.
Together, these data showed that Sin1 functions as a component of the stress-activated Sty1/Spc1 MAP kinase pathway in S. pombe and that a functional homolog of Sin1
exists in vertebrates.
No further information concerning Sin1 appeared since
the paper of Wilkinson et al. [2] until our discovery that
the ovine (ov) Sin1 associated via its C-terminus to the
cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2, a subunit of the type I
IFN receptor [4], and Schroder et al. [5] described transcripts for Sin1 in human tissue and provided an analysis
of the human gene. The latter study confirmed that Sin1
was relatively well conserved across Metazoa and fungi
(Ascomyctes and Basidiomycetes) and was also represented in amoebae, but not in other protozoan species.
Ovine Sin1, which is 88% identical in sequence to chicken
Sin1, can be co-immunoprecipated with the IFN receptor
subunit IFNAR2 and shows a similar subcellular distribution to the receptor protein when co-expressed in mammalian cells [4]. Although ovSin1 was identified from a
cDNA present in ovine endometrium and was initially
considered to have a role in reproduction associated with
the action of IFN-τ on the uterus during early pregnancy

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/13

in the sheep, it became clear that the Sin1 gene was
expressed in tissues other than endometrium and might
have a general role in the action of type 1 IFN. In particular, it seemed possible that Sin1 might link the action of
IFN to the stress activated SAPK signal transduction pathways. Such a linkage has been inferred from earlier studies
in which early activation of p38 MAPK had been noted
following exposure of a variety of cell lines to IFN-α, -β, or
-τ [6-12].
Although the SAPK pathway is itself ancient and is found
in all the species in which the Sin1 gene exists, the IFN system of receptors and ligands is restricted to vertebrates.
We reasoned, therefore, that an analysis of Sin1 gene
sequences might not only provide insight into the function of Sin1, but indicate how the protein evolved to interact with IFNAR2. The fact that the Sin1 gene appears to be
expressed ubiquitously, that it is highly conserved across
a wide range of taxa, and that it is a likely participant in
several important signaling pathways, makes it an intriguing candidate for a functional/evolutionary analysis.

Results
Conservation of the Sin1 gene from yeast to mammals
A combination of searching methods was employed to
locate Sin1 genes in available cDNA and genome data
bases (Table 1). Sin1 sequences were found in two yeast
species (Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the red bread mold (Neurospora crassa) and a
number of other fungal species (not shown here),
Caenorhabditis elegans, a mosquito species (Anopheles gambiae), fruit fly (D. melanogaster), frog (Xenopus laevis), two
fish species (Fugu rubripes and Danio rerio), chicken (Gallus
gallus), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus),
human (Homo sapiens), sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos taurus), and pig (Sus scrofa) (Table 1). No apparent ortholog
could be detected in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Nor
could sequences corresponding to Sin1 be found in protozoa other than amoebae and prokaryotic species.

The marked dissimilarity in inferred amino acid sequence
between Sin1 from vertebrates and C. elegans (25% identity, Table 2), between the two yeast species (29% identity,
Table 2; see Additional file: 1) and between S. pombe and
N. crassa (28% identity, Table 2, see Additional file: 2) in
the approximately 500 aa of overlap suggests that even if
homologs existed in plants and prokaryotes they would
likely be overlooked by the search methods employed.
Sin1 from the yeast species, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe
which consist of 1172 aa and 665 aa, respectively, and
also from the red bread mold, N. crassa (798 aa) are much
longer than Sin1 from vertebrate and insect species, which
are ~520 aa long. The regions of similarity among these
three fungal proteins are confined entirely to the carboxyl

termini of these molecules, although several gaps have to
be introduced to align them. No similarities are detectable
in the amino terminal extensions, which, in the case of S.
cerevisiae, is 370 aa long. It is the carboxyl regions of the
fungal proteins that can also be aligned with the Sin1
sequences from C. elegans, insects, and vertebrate species,
including Ovis aries, the sheep (Fig. 1).
A phylogenetic tree reconstructed from an alignment of
amino acid sequences of Sin1 is shown in Fig. 2. As anticipated, the sequences from the three fungi, C. elegans, the
two insect species, and vertebrate species fell into distinct
branches of the tree. The sequences for the mammalian
species were tightly clustered, with identities ranging from
99% (humans and cattle) to 91.3% (sheep and rat) (Table
2). All the vertebrate cDNA encoded polypeptides of 522
aa (Table 2).
There is considerable conservation of Sin1 from mammals
to birds (~90%), amphibians (~85%), and fish (~80%)
(Table 2). The insect sequences are rather longer than the
ones from vertebrates, and several gaps have to be introduced to provide alignments (Fig. 3, 4, 5). Nevertheless,
the insect amino acid sequences are approximately 33%
identical to those of the mammals (Table 2). Five blocks
of sequence (SCD I-V) are significantly more conserved
than others when two insects, a fish, an amphibian, a bird

and several mammals are compared (Figs. 3, 4, 5 &6).
Three of these regions are located towards the N-terminus
and two additional regions towards the C-terminus. The
most diverse region is located centrally.
The region of the greatest identity between these divergent
insect and vertebrate sequences is an acidic region placed
in conserved SCD III (Fig. 3, 4, 5). In mammals, this
region is completely conserved and corresponds to residues L232-K267 (LHIAEDDGEVDTDFPPLDSNEPIHKFGFSTLALVEK; Figs. 3, 4, 5; Fig. 7). However, an analysis of
this sequence reveals no known functional motifs and no
strong similarity to sequences represented in other known
proteins. Schroder et al. [5] have also noted this conserved
sequence in their analyses of Sin1 sequences and have
named it CRIM for conserved region in the middle.
Sin1 from C. elegans retains the highly conserved 36
amino acid SCD I and the 127 amino acid Domain III
(Fig. 6 &7). SCD III is also retained in the fission yeast and
the red bread mold.
Vertebrates possess several unique sequences not present
in insects and yeast, and, therefore, potentially implicated
in the IFN signal transduction pathway including a carboxyl terminal region (KLSRRTSFSFQKDKK) immediately following the end of SCD V.

Functional motifs in the Sin1 primary sequence
When the ovine Sin1 sequence is scanned for functional
motifs [13], the structure appears unusually barren. Two
weak bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) [14] can
be detected. One (residues 82–98, RRSNTAQRLERLRKERQ) is present in the SCDII domain, and the other (residues 503–519, RKLNRRTSFSFQKEKKS) is almost at the
C-terminus within conserved domain V (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, data from the subcellular localization experiment
showed that Sin1 is excluded from the nucleus when

transfected in COS1 or L929 cells [4], suggesting these
NLS are probably not functional.
There are numerous motifs that are recognized as potential but weak sites for phosphorylation by either casein
kinase II (CK2), protein kinase C, or protein kinase A
(data not shown). None of the 17 CK2 sites, the 12 protein kinase C, or the 5 protein kinase A sites present in the
ovine Sin1 primary sequence are conserved from mammals to fission yeast, although many are retained across

H. sapiens [15,16]. Sin1 exists as a single copy gene in all
these species. For example, the human Sin1 gene is
located on chromosome 9 (9q34.11-9q34.12) (data not
shown) with the transcribed region composed of 11 exons
and 10 introns and spanning a region of about 240 kb

(Fig. 8). Exon 7 is spliced out of the shorter form of Sin1
[4,5]. The lack of exon 7 does not cause a frame shift
because the intron phases of the two introns on both sides
of exon 7 are identical (data not shown). Schroder et al.
[5] have also demonstrated or predicted other minor
splice variants for Sin1 in the human. The 11 exons
account for only 0.9% of the gene sequence. It is, of
course, unclear how many additional exons and introns
are associated with the 5' UTR beyond the transcription
start site(s), whose location has not been determined.

Figure highly conserved domains of Sin1 proteins
The five6
The five highly conserved domains of Sin1 proteins. Sin1 primary sequences from various species were aligned by using
the ClustalW program, and the five most conserved domains identified from the alignment in Fig. 3 and the sequences listed in
Table 1. Conserved domains are shown as boxes with remaining regions as solid lines. SCD, Sin1 conserved domain. Numbers
beneath the species names are the lengths of the Sin1 proteins. Values in the boxes are the number of amino acid residues
within a conserved domain. Numbers on the lines reflect the lengths of that region.

Currently, the sheep and bovine genome sequences are
not available, but it is likely that the Sin1 gene organization will be similar to that in the human. The current comparative synteny maps between human, sheep and cattle
[17-19] predict that the Sin1 gene is located on sheep
chromosome 3 (3p1.7-3p2.6) and bovine chromosome
11 (11q2.3-11q2.8), respectively.
A comparative map for all the genes is shown in Fig. 8. In
fission yeast and insects, the Sin1 gene consists of a single
exon. In worm, fish, rat, mice, and human, Sin1 has multiple exons. The exon/intron pattern, consisting of 11
exons, is observed in all vertebrates, including the two fish
species (Fig. 8). It is noteworthy that although the
genomic sequences of sheep and cattle are not available,
the exon/intron pattern of their Sin1 genes is similar to
that of other vertebrates based on the comparison
between sheep or cattle Sin1 cDNA and human genomic

sequence of Sin1 (data not shown). The lengths of these
11 exons are also remarkably conserved and fall within
the normal range (50–200bp for most internal exons)
(International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium,
2001). As expected, the sizes of the introns differ across
species, and some are extremely long. Intron sizes generally decrease in the order human > mouse > rat > fish (Fig.
8). As expected, intron sizes were quite similar between
rodents and human.
The Sin1 gene from C. elegans is organized quite differently from that in mammals. It consists of 10 exons interrupted by nine relatively short introns. The region of the
C. elegans gene that contains regions of similarity with the
mammalian protein sequences consists of exon 1 (SCD I)
and exon 5 (SCD III). As noted above and in Figure 8, the
Sin1 gene from insects and S. pombe is comprised of only
a single exon.

Figure 8
A comparison of the Sin1 gene structure across species
A comparison of the Sin1 gene structure across species. The gene structure for all species was retrieved from the
genome database of the species by using the BLASTn program to analyze the open reading frame of each Sin1 cDNA sequence.
Only the regions of the gene containing the open reading frame are shown in the diagram. All sequences begin with start
codons and end with stop codons. The numbers under species names are the protein length.

Discussion
Sin1 is a little studied gene product of unclear function
found in species ranging from mammals to fungi.
Although the S. pombe gene product is longer than that of
mammals, with an extension at its N-terminus, human
Sin1 can rescue the stress sensitivity noted in the phenotype of a S. pombe strain that expressed a constitutively
active form of RAS, indicating that function, as well as
structure, has been conserved over hundreds of millions
of years.
Two facts should be considered when attempting to infer
a role for Sin1 in vertebrates. The first, as discussed in the
Background, is the known ability of type 1 IFN to activate
MAPK/SAPK in mammalian cells. The second is the
proven involvement of Sin1 in the yeast SAPK (Sty1/Spc1)

pathway and its involvement in controlling transcription
of stress-activated genes [2]. The present analysis was
conducted in an attempt to gain more detailed information about Sin1 function from a phylogenetic analysis and
comparison of Sin1 genes and gene products in different
taxonomic groups.
The Sin1 gene is remarkably divergent in both length and
sequence identity within the fungi S. pombe, S. cerevisiae,
and N. crassa, emphasizing the evolutionary distance
between these three species. The regions of similarity are
confined to the ~600 amino acid C-terminal regions of
the three sequences (data not shown), and it is this region
that is also conserved in insects and vertebrates (see Additional file: 1 &2). This diversity in structure within the
fungi is probably reflected in divergence of function.

AVO1, the apparent Sin1 ortholog of S. cerevisiae, forms a
membrane-associated complex with TOR2 and other protein components (AVO2, AVO3 and LST8), which control
cell growth in response to nutrients [3,32]. Cells with
deletion of AVO1 are unable to organize their actin
cytoskeleton [3]. In contrast, the Sin1 ortholog of S. pombe
is involved in a stress response signaling pathway by interacting with Sty1 [2]. A cross-species comparison of all the
Sin1 sequences available, indicates five regions of greatest
conservation, only one of which, a ~127 amino acid central region (SCD III), was easily defined in all taxa (Figs. 3,
4, 5 &6). Even this region is poorly conserved in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, although certain landmark amino
acids are retained (data not shown). Interestingly, Sin1
from insects and vertebrates, despite having only about
35% identity, are of similar length and possess the five
regions of high identity. Conceivably, the SCD III domain
is functionally essential in all the species, while SCDs I, II,
IV, and V have evolved conserved function within the
Metazoa. A not unreasonable assumption is that that Sin1
plays an evolutionarily conserved role in SAPK signaling
across a broad range of taxa, including all metazoan and
fungal species [5] but has assumed an additional function
in vertebrates in mediating crosstalk with the IFN-signal
transduction pathway.
In vertebrates Sin1 falls into a class of highly conserved
gene products. Its conservation is lower than that of two
structural proteins, histone H3 and β-actin, but is
comparable to that of CDK1 (Table 3). However, while
CDK1 in yeast and insects retains considerable sequence
identity with the vertebrate orthologs, much of the conservation of Sin1 is lost. It is tempting to speculate that Sin1
has been subjected to powerful evolutionary constraint
that has limited its amino acid sequence divergence
within vertebrates. It should be noted that our analyses
cannot exclude the possibility that conservation of Sin1
among vertebrates reflects recent divergence of the sam-

pled vertebrates relative to the other taxa examined. Once
data become available, it will be instructive to compare
Sin1 gene sequences from the invertebrate chordates
(Tunicata and Cephalochordata) with those of the other
metazoan taxa.
Sin1 was shown to be associated with the cytoplasmic
domain of IFNAR2, a subunit of the type I IFN receptor
[4]. Since insects appear to lack genes for type I IFN and
their receptors (R. M. Roberts, unpublished observations),
whereas vertebrates utilize this system primarily as an
anti-viral response [20-22], it should be theoretically possible to define a sequence in silico unique to vertebrates
but clearly absent in both D. melanogaster and A. gambiae
that might account for the association of Sin1 with
IFNAR2. Sin1 binds to the carboxyl end of the cytoplasmic
domain of IFNAR2 via its own carboxyl 114 amino acids
[4]. At least two candidate sequences exist in that part of
Sin1. One is the rather basic carboxyl terminus (aa 510–
522), another a HDYKHLYFESDA (aa 458–469)
sequence, both of which are absent in the insect proteins
(Figs. 3, 4, 5). Whether these sequences are participants in
the interaction of Sin1 with IFNAR2 in vertebrates has not
been examined experimentally. Of course, it is quite possible that insect Sin1 can bind vertebrate IFNAR2 or that
amino acid substitutions elsewhere in the carboxyl end of
the vertebrate sequence have evolved to promote the
interaction. These possibilities have also not been tested.
In this regard, IFNAR2, with which Sin1 interacts, has
evolved much more rapidly than Sin1 itself. The sequence
of human IFNAR2, for example, shows only about 58%
and 29% identity to those of ovine and chicken IFNAR2,
respectively [21,23], while orthologs have yet to be
defined for IFNAR2 in frogs and fish, even though these
animals are believed to have a functional IFN system,
which includes the production of Type I IFN and downstream components in response to double stranded RNA
[20,22]. Interestingly, the only highly conserved continu-

ous sequence of chick and mammalian IFNAR2 within the
Sin1 binding region is an acidic region (aa 493–515;
human IFNAR2 numbering) at the very carboxyl terminus
of the molecule ([23]; R.M. Roberts, unpublished
observations). It seems possible that this conserved
sequence provides the scaffold for Sin1 binding.
As also observed by Schroder et al. [5], Sin1 is represented
by a single gene in all species where it exists. In both
insects and the two yeast species, the gene is intronless,
while in C. elegans and in vertebrate species introns are
present (Fig. 8). In budding yeast, only a small number
(3.8%) of genes have introns [24], whereas in most other
eukaryotes, including Drosophila, intronic sequences are a
feature of the majority of genes and must be excised to
produce a functional mRNA [25]. For D. melanogaster, for
example, there is an average of 3 introns per gene [26].
These introns are short, averaging 240 bp in Drosophila
[27]. Why the Sin1 genes are intronless in these species is
unclear, but there is considerable evidence that retrotransposition occurs in yeast, Drosophila [28] and mammals
[29]. In this process, reverse transcription of mRNA from
a parental gene creates an intronless copy of the parental
gene at a new position in the genome. If this mechanism
created the Sin1 gene, a remnant or evolved version of the
parental gene might be anticipated to exist, particularly if
the transposition event occurred in recent evolutionary
time [28]. It is unclear whether the intronless Sin1 gene in
Drosophila resulted from such a retrotransposition event
since there is not a detectable intronic copy elsewhere in
the genome. The Sin1 gene from C. elegans has introns,
but is organized very differently from that of vertebrates,
where the intron/exon organization is highly conserved
(Fig. 8).
Unfortunately, the function of Sin1 is unknown. Its structural conservation from vertebrates to yeast [30] and its
expression in most, if not all tissues of mammals [4] suggest a central, if elusive, role in life processes.

Conclusions
SAPK-interacting protein 1 (Sin1), a little-studied but
widely expressed gene product, is encoded by a single
gene in fungi, nematodes, insects, and all vertebrates analyzed and shows modest conservation of amino acid
sequence that is consistent with some degree of conserved
function in stress-activated signal transduction pathways.
Sin1 is highly conserved in vertebrates where it has been
implicated in linking interferon responses to the SAPK
pathway.

retrieved from at NCBI Genome databases [18]. Sin1
cDNA sequences from human, mouse, rat, cattle and pig,
and other Sin1 ESTs were retrieved from GenBank EST
database after BLASTn analysis at NCBI [18]. For fish Sin1
genomic sequences, the incomplete puffer fish (Fugu
rubripes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome databases at
the Ensembl site [16] were used. The budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ORF (open reading frame) database
[33] was used to retrieve budding yeast Sin1.
Software programs used to analyze sequences
Pairwise global sequence alignment was performed by
using either the BESTFIT or the GAP program from GCG
(Madison, WI). Multiple global sequence alignment was
performed by using either the PILEUP program (GCG,
Madison, WI) and GeneDoc [34] or ClustalW program
[35]. The phylogenetic tree for Sin1 was generated by
using the ClustalW program and the MEGA program [36].
Motif search was performed by using the ScanProsite program [13].
Methods for obtaining Sin1 sequences from various species
Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and chicken
(Gallus gallus): The two Sin1 sequences were published by
Wilkinson et al. [2].

Budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae): The BLASTp program was used to search the budding yeast ORF database
for any protein sequence that had significant similarity to
the fission yeast Sin1 protein. The obtained budding yeast
Sin1 protein sequence had a GenBank link where its
cDNA was available. The cDNA sequence was used to analyze its genomic structure at the NCBI yeast genome site.
Red bread mold (Neurospora crassa): Sin1 protein was
retrieved from the Neurospora crossa protein data base by
searching (BLASTp) with the budding yeast Sin1 protein.
Worm (Caenorhabditis elegans): The Sin1 protein sequence
was obtained from the C. elegans protein database by
searching with ovine Sin1 protein. The cDNA sequence
was then obtained from the GenBank link and used to
determine the structure of the Sin1 gene.
Fly (Drosophila melanogaster): The fruit fly Sin1 protein
sequence was retrieved from the D. melanogaster protein
database as above. The cDNA sequence was obtained
from the GenBank link. Unexpectedly, querying the
Drosophila genomic sequence with the C. elegans Sin1
sequence and vice-versa failed to yield a match in either
case.

Methods
Databases
Sin1 genomic sequences from human, mouse, rat, fruit
fly, mosquito, C. elegans, S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae, were

Mosquito (Anopheles gambiae): The mosquito Sin1 protein
sequence was retrieved from the Anopheles gambiae str.

PEST protein database as above. The cDNA sequence was
then obtained from the GenBank link.
Puffer fish (Fugu rubripes) and Zebrafish (Danio rerio):
Both Fugu rubripes and Danio rerio genome databases,
which are accessible at two websites, NCBI and ENSEMBL,
were queried with Sin1 cDNA sequences from sheep,
chicken, and frog. For both species, only the Ensembl site
provided the complete genomic sequence. Although the
Fugu rubripes genome sequence is incomplete, the exons of
Sin1 cDNA can be retrieved and successfully assembled
into the full length structure by alignment with other Sin1
cDNA and gene sequences. No GenBank entry was available for the Fugu rubripes Sin1 gene. When a similar
method was used to retrieve the Zebrafish Sin1 cDNA
sequence, the full length sequence could not be obtained
because the region (~20 kb) covering one exon (exon 4)
was incomplete. Therefore, the fish Sin1 protein sequence
used here is from Fugu rubripes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/13

was not full-length, an additional human Sin1 EST
(GenBank Acc. No. BC002326) was used to assembly the
full length Sin1 cDNA sequence. The location of the gene
and its structure downstream of its transcription start site
were determined by searching the full human genome
database with the Sin1 open reading frame.
Sheep (Ovis aries): The sheep Sin1 cDNA sequence was
cloned from a sheep endometrial cDNA library in a yeast
two-hybrid screen [4]. GenBank accession numbers are
summarized in Table 1.

Authors' contributions
SW carried out the majority of the computational analyses
under the direction of RMR, and wrote the first draft of the
manuscript. RMR conceived of the study and participated
in its design and coordination. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.

Additional material
Frog (Xenopus lavis): The full-length cDNA sequence of
Sin1 reported here was from African clawed frog, and was
obtained by blasting the Xenopus EST database [37] with
the chicken Sin1 sequence. The protein sequence was
deduced from this cDNA sequence.

Mouse (Mus musculus): The mouse Sin1 cDNA sequence
was obtained by editing several ESTs, after performing a
BLASTn search of the Mus Musculus EST database with the
ovine Sin1 cDNA sequence. Searching the mouse genome
database with the mouse Sin1 cDNA coding region then
allowed the gene, down stream of its transcription start
site to be located and its structure to be inferred.

Rat (Rattus norvegicus): The rat Sin1 cDNA sequence was
retrieved from several overlapping ESTs, which were
obtained by searching the Rattus norvegicus EST database
with the ovine Sin1 cDNA sequence. The coding region of
the rat Sin1 cDNA was then used to search the rat genome
database at the NCBI website for the genomic structure of
the gene.
Cattle (Bos taurus): The full length bovine Sin1 cDNA
sequence was obtained from overlapping ESTs, which
were obtained by searching the NCBI EST database with
the ovine Sin1 cDNA sequence.
