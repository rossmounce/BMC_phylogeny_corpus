Abstract
Background: Mammalian ribosomes contain 79 different proteins encoded by widely scattered
single copy genes. Coordinate expression of these genes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional
levels is required to ensure a roughly equimolar accumulation of ribosomal proteins. To date,
detailed studies of only a very few ribosomal protein (rp) promoters have been made. To elucidate
the general features of rp promoter architecture, I made a detailed sequence comparison of the
promoter regions of the entire set of orthologous human and mouse rp genes.
Results: A striking evolutionarily conserved feature of most rp genes is the separation by an intron
of the sequences involved in transcriptional and translational regulation from the sequences with
protein encoding function. Another conserved feature is the polypyrimidine initiator, which
conforms to the consensus (Y)2C+1TY(T)2(Y)3. At least 60 % of the rp promoters contain a largely
conserved TATA box or A/T-rich motif, which should theoretically have TBP-binding capability. A
remarkably high proportion of the promoters contain conserved binding sites for transcription
factors that were previously implicated in rp gene expression, namely upstream GABP and Sp1 sites
and downstream YY1 sites. Over 80 % of human and mouse rp genes contain a transposable
element residue within 900 bp of 5' flanking sequence; very little sequence identity between human
and mouse orthologues was evident more than 200 bp upstream of the transcriptional start point.
Conclusions: This analysis has provided some valuable insights into the general architecture of
mammalian rp promoters and has identified parameters that might coordinately regulate the
transcriptional activity of certain subsets of rp genes.

Background
Ribosomes are vital organelles, which catalyze protein
synthesis in all living organisms. Eukaryotic ribosomes
consist of four RNA molecules (rRNAs) and 79 different
proteins. The mammalian genes encoding the rRNAs are
multicopy and clustered at a few loci, whereas those
encoding the ribosomal proteins (rp genes) are single
copy and scattered throughout the genome [1]. In addition to the functional rp genes, all of which contain
introns, mammalian genomes contain many nonfunc-

tional intronless rp pseudogenes [2]. The earliest determinations of mouse rp gene sequences and of transcriptional
start points (tsp's) revealed a salient feature of rp genes,
namely that transcription is initiated at a C residue within
a polypyrimidine tract [3-5]. A recent study by Kenmochi
and coworkers [6] has demonstrated that this is a general
property of virtually all human rp genes. Because of this
novel feature, the rp mRNAs contain a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine sequence (TOP), which is essential for their
translational control [7].

Coordinated expression of the rp genes at transcriptional
and post-transcriptional levels is required to ensure a
roughly equimolar accumulation of ribosomal proteins.
Transcriptional run-on measurements with nuclei of rapidly proliferating cells indicated equivalent loading of
RNA polymerases on three unlinked mouse rp genes [8],
consistent with the equal abundance of the corresponding
rp mRNAs [9]. Moreover, the promoters of these genes
were of comparable strength in driving the expression of a
common reporter gene [8]. These results suggested that
similar promoter strength and mRNA processing efficiency might provide a basis for the coordinated expression of rp genes. However, whether this concept applies to
all rp genes or to distinctive subsets of genes is presently
unclear.
Despite the obvious importance of rp gene expression for
cell viability, there have been very few experimental studies of rp promoter architecture and transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes. To date, efforts to identify
functionally relevant cis-acting regulatory elements and
transcription factor binding sites have been made for only
9 mammalian [8,10-23] and 2 amphibian [24,25] rp
genes, less than 15 % of the total rp gene complement.
These studies identified regulatory elements in the promoter-proximal regions, both upstream and downstream
of the tsp. Some of these elements contained binding sites
for known transcription factors, notably GABP, Sp1 and
YY1. When the binding of any individual factor was eliminated by a site-specific mutation, transcriptional activity
was reduced, but not abolished, indicating that the overall
transcription efficiency is determined by a combinatorial
effect of multiple factors. No regulatory element common
to all rp genes was found, although certain elements were
present in several of the genes that were studied. None of
these rp genes contained a canonical TATA box in the -25
to -30 region, although some had a "TATA-like" A/T-rich
sequence, which might bind the general transcription factor TBP under certain circumstances.
Because the previous experimental studies were limited to
a small subset of rp genes, it is important to know whether
the results of those studies can be used to predict special
features of promoter architecture that characterize the
entire set of rp genes or that could be used to sort the rp
genes into classes with similar features. This applies not
only to transcription factor-binding sites, but also to the
polypyrimidine tract that spans the tsp. As an initiator element, this tract is atypical because the tsp of initiators is
normally an adenine residue, flanked on both sides by
pyrimidines [26].
To address these issues, I have applied the principle of
"phylogenetic footprinting", which holds that important
regulatory sequences will have a tendency to be evolution-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/15

arily conserved and thus revealed by a sequence comparison of corresponding regions of orthologous genes [27].
Some regulatory promoter elements may escape detection
by this approach, but a substantial majority will probably
be recognized with confidence [28]. Although previously
done on a small scale for a few selected rp genes
[19,21,29-32], such an analysis has not heretofore been
made for the entire rp gene population. I have therefore
compared the promoter regions of all 79 orthologous
human and mouse rp genes and have extended the comparisons to include chicken, amphibian and fish counterparts when these sequences were available. I have
compared the sequence organization of the rp promoters
with that of the promoters of non-rp TOP genes and other
genes in the housekeeping category. This analysis has provided some useful insights into the general architecture of
mammalian rp promoters and has identified parameters
that might coordinately regulate the transcriptional activity of certain subsets of rp genes.

Results
Compilation of the promoter sequences of orthologous rp
genes
To make a study of the evolutionarily conserved features
of ribosomal protein gene promoters, I first had to assemble a set of orthologous human and mouse rp gene
sequences, in which the transcription start sites are reasonably well defined. For all of the human rp genes, annotated sequences are now available owing to the studies of
Kato, Kenmochi and coworkers [6,33], who systematically
determined the 5' termini of human rp mRNAs by the
oligo-capping method. While these studies indicated
some small variations in the exact 5' ends of individual rp
mRNAs, the tsp's could usually be specified to within a
few nucleotides. Independent determinations of the
human tsp's by the oligo-capping procedure are also available on the database of transcription start sites (DBTSS)
compiled by Sugano and colleagues [34]. The agreement
between the two sets of oligo-capping data and the results
of primer extension/nuclease protection (PE/S1) experiments is generally very good [see Additional file 1]. In all
cases, the human tsp's selected in the present study correspond either to the most abundant oligo-capped cDNA or
to an observed variant.

In contrast to the situation with the human rp genes, accurate determinations of the tsp's of mouse rp genes have
been made in only a few cases, and therefore the annotations of rp genes in the mouse genome databases are generally incomplete. To overcome this problem, I used the
mVISTA alignment program [35] to compare mouse
sequences extending several kb upstream of the coding
regions with the sequences of the corresponding human
orthologues. Fortunately, the strong conservation of
sequences in the proximal promoter regions and in the

first exons enabled me to identify the probable tsp's of
most mouse rp genes with confidence. For the most part,
the tsp's that were predicted by this strategy corresponded
exactly to those previously determined by primer extension and/or nuclease protection assays of murine rp genes
[see Additional file 1]. Some information on putative tsp's
of mouse rp genes is available on the DBTSS database.
However, the most prominent of these tsp's did not agree
with the PE/S1 data. Moreover, they were not coincident
with the aligned C tsp's of the human orthologues, but
were frequently at adjacent or nearby T residues. Conceivably, these discrepancies are caused by a technical bias, as
is sometimes encountered in the generation of genomewide full-length cDNA libraries [36]. Therefore, relying on
maximum sequence conservation and the best agreement
with previous experimental data, I compiled aligned
sequences of all 79 pairs of orthologous human and
mouse rp genes, and used these sequences for further
analysis of the promoter regions.

The location of insertion elements in the 5'-flanking regions
The location of insertion elements in the 5'-flanking
regions of rp genes. Insertion (ins) elements were identified by the RepeatMasker program in scans of up to one kilobase of sequence 5' of the tsp, and the location of the
element nearest to the tsp recorded for 79 human and
mouse rp genes [see Additional file 2]. The distance from the
tsp was divided into 200 bp intervals, the percentage of rp
genes with an element within each interval determined, and
the values plotted cumulatively against the distance from the
tsp.

In a preliminary analysis, I used the mVISTA sequence
alignment program to examine six to ten kb of 5' flanking
sequence of three pairs of orthologus rp genes (rpS16,
rpL30 and rpL32 ). These genes were selected because the
mouse orthologues have been previously studied extensively in my laboratory. Scans with a 50 bp window indicated that the conserved (> 75 % identity) flanking
sequences are largely confined to regions within a few
hundred base pairs of the tsp. There was very little alignment of the upstream region sequences and many gaps
caused by the presence of numerous insertion elements.
With this analysis, I detected only one short block of conserved sequence at -2 kb in rpL30 (77 % identity over 84
bp), one short block at -1.5 kb in rpL32 (82 % identity
over 60 bp), and none in rpS16 . Neither of the conserved
blocks contained any recognizable transcription factor
binding sites or other remarkable characteristics. The lack
of any credible long-range regulatory elements is consistent with earlier conclusions based on transient transfection experiments with these genes [8,17,37]. Given these
results, I restricted the analysis of the full set of rp genes to
the transcribed portions of the genes and about one kilobase of 5' flanking sequence [see Additional file 2].

cussed above, very little sequence conservation was evident more than 200 bp upstream of the tsp. Accordingly,
for the refined analysis of rp promoter architecture, I analyzed segments extending from 200 bp upstream to 100
bp downstream of the tsp. These segments were scrutinized for the quality of TATA box motifs in the -25 region,
for conserved sequences in the initiator region, for transcription factor binding sites, and for the location of the
AUG translation start codons.

An initial analysis of the large data set revealed the presence of repetitive sequence insertion elements (sines for
human and B1/B2 for mouse) in the 5' flanks of a very
high proportion of the rp genes [see Additional file 2].
Indeed, as seen in Figure 1, half of the rp genes contain
such an element within 500 bp of the tsp and over 80 %
contain elements within 900 bp. The distribution is very
similar in the human and mouse rp genes. Both ancestral
elements, which are moderately conserved between
mouse and human, and lineage-specific elements could
be identified. As in the case of the three examples dis-

Criteria for the annotation of rp promoter sequences
To evaluate the quality of TATA box motifs, I established
criteria based on rules derived from a crystallographic
analysis of TBP-DNA complexes [38]. With these rules one
can classify each nucleotide in the motif as being "preferred" or "acceptable" or "incompatible" with TBP binding (Figure 2a). I considered motifs with a string of 6 or
more compatible nucleotides, of which at least 5 are "preferred", as being capable of binding TBP with high affinity
(+ motifs). Those with a string of 6 compatible nucleotides, 3 or 4 of which are "preferred", were considered as

Annotated comparisons of human/mouse promoter
sequences
Illustrative examples of four annotated promoter
sequence comparisons are shown in Figure 3. All four of
these examples illustrate the strong sequence conservation
of the non coding portions of exon 1, which is a general
feature of the entire rp gene family [see Additional file 3].
The AUG translation initiation codon is located within
exon 1 of rpL13a (panel d) and within exon 2 of rpL30
(panel b), whereas in rpS18 (panel a) and rpS4 (panel c),
it is at the extreme 3' end of exon 1. Many rp genes have
this latter feature, which may be relevant to the evolution
of vertebrate rp promoters (see below).

possible low affinity sites (+/- motifs). Sequences that do
not satisfy these criteria were judged to be incapable of
unaided binding to DNA (- motifs).
Employing stringent criteria (Figure 2b), I used the rVISTA
program [39] to search systematically for conserved
(aligned) sites that would be predicted to bind the three
transcription factors (GABP, Sp1, and YY1) that were
identified in earlier experimental studies of rp promoters
and also for highly conserved sites that might bind other
ubiquitously expressed factors. In addition, I scanned
both the human and mouse rp promoter sequences for
unaligned optimal sites for the above-mentioned factors
and for a motif termed Box A, which was previously implicated in rp gene expression [19]. I used the results of these
analyses to complete the annotation of all 79 pairs of
aligned human and mouse rp promoter sequences, which
can be viewed individually on pages 1 through 80 of a
supplementary file [see Additional file 3].

The rpS18 promoter contains a conserved TATA (+) motif,
while the TATA motifs of rpS4 and rpL13a were scored as
(+/-) and that of rpL30 as (-). Well-conserved (aligned)
consensus binding sites for GABP and/or Sp1 are located
upstream of the tsp in all four examples; downstream YY1
sites are evident in rpL30 and rpL13a . The rpS18 and
rpL13a promoters also contain conserved consensus binding sites for the ubiquitous AP1/ATF factors. The promoter
elements that were found to have functional significance
in experimental studies of the mouse rpL30 gene [11] are
all conserved in the human orthologue (panel b). This
includes sites for RFX1 and the Gamma Factor as well as
the GABP and YY1 sites. In addition to the conserved sites,
a few non conserved (unaligned) GABP and Sp1 sites of
uncertain relevance are evident in rpL30 and rpL13a .
The results of this type of analysis for the full set of rp promoters are tabulated in Table 1. The identity between
human and mouse sequences in the 300 bp segment (200 to +100) that was analyzed ranged from 50 to 75 %
with an average of 61 %. The location of the translation
initiation codon was conserved in all except one rp gene
(rpL29 ). In 29 % of the rp genes the AUG codon is at the
extreme 3' end of exon 1 and in 47 % it is in exon 2. Thus,
in 3/4 of the rp genes, the genetic elements involved in
transcriptional/translational regulation are spatially separated from those with protein encoding function.
Contrary to previous impressions based on an incomplete
set of rp genes, the rp promoters cannot generally be
classified as "TATA-less". Thirty-five percent of the promoters contain, in the -25 region, a TATA box that should
theoretically bind TBP with high affinity. An additional 25
% have an A/T-rich tract in this region, which might bind
TBP with lower affinity, and the remainder would not be
predicted to bind TBP without help from other proteins.
For the most part, the TATA box quality is well conserved
between the two mammalian species: the assessed quality
of human and mouse TATA motifs was the same in 82 %
of the rp promoters.

The prevalence in rp promoters of evolutionarily conserved GABP, Sp1 and YY1 binding sites is readily apparent from these results. Conserved upstream GABP and Sp1
sites are present in 54 % and 48 % of the rp promoters,
respectively. Conserved downstream YY1 sites are present
in 52 % of the rp promoters. The ratio of aligned to unaligned sites in the human rp promoters is approximately
2:1 for GABP, 1:1 for Sp1 and 4:1 for YY1. The occurrence
of unaligned sites in the mouse rp promoters is similar to
that in the human rp promoters [see Additional file 3]. It
is noteworthy that 76 % of the rp promoters contain at
least one conserved upstream GABP and/or Sp1 site
within 200 bp of the tsp. If unaligned sites are included,
the proportion of human rp genes with an upstream
GABP and/or Sp1 site is 92 %. Conserved consensus
motifs for other ubiquitous transcription factors are
present in a much lower proportion of the rp promoters,
namely 12 % for the Box A-binding factor, 11 % for AP1,
10 % for ATF/CREB and 8 % for Nrf1.
The rp gene initiator
The existence of a novel polypyrimidine initiator
sequence in which the conventional A residue at the tsp is
replaced by a C residue is well known. Moreover, the roles

of this sequence in rp gene transcription and rp mRNA
translation have been previously demonstrated experimentally for a few rp genes [7,40-42]. What is not known
is whether there is a consensus initiator sequence that
characterizes the entire rp gene set. To address this issue, I
used the pairwise alignments of human and mouse orthologues to produce an occupancy matrix for positions -8 to
+10 of the initiator [see Additional file 4]. With this matrix
and the standard consensus rules, I determined that the rp
consensus initiator sequence is (Y)2C+1TY(T)2(Y)3. A striking result is that T's are strongly preferred over C's at positions +2, +4 and +5. This preference, which is graphically
illustrated in Figure 4, might be related to a transcriptional
function of the initiator or a translational function of the
TOP or to both functions.
The extent of conservation of rp promoter features in nonmammalian vertebrates
To determine the features of rp promoter architecture that
are conserved over large evolutionary periods, I compared
the promoter sequences of five chicken, six amphibian
and five fish rp genes to their mammalian orthologues
using the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment program. An example of such an alignment for rpS3 (Figure

initiator sequence, and a downstream YY1 site that spans
the translation initiation codon. In contrast, the overlapping GABP and Sp1 sites, which are aligned in the human
and mouse promoters, are not conserved in the
amphibian and fish promoters. However, each of these
promoters contains an unaligned consensus site for GABP
or Sp1. A summary of the multi-sequence analysis for 11
rp genes (Table 2) indicates that the extent of conservation
observed for rpS3 is fairly typical, although some small
variations are evident. The conformance to the consensus
initiator sequence is the same (90 %) for mammals and
lower vertebrates. Yet, the particular C residue within the
initiator that is used as the major tsp may differ slightly.
Also the adjudged quality of the TATA box for TBP binding is not always the same. Nevertheless, except for the
location of upstream transcription factor-binding sites,
the general features of rp promoter architecture are usually well conserved over large evolutionary distances.
Comparison of rp promoter features with those of non-rp
TOP genes and other housekeeping genes
It is of interest to know which features of rp promoter
architecture are specific and which might be common to
other ubiquitously expressed genes. To this end, I examined the promoters of two additional sets of genes. One
set consisted of non-rp genes that also produce transla-

tionally controlled mRNAs with 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (non-rp TOP genes). At the present, there are
nine known genes in this category for which the tsp of at
least one orthologue has been experimentally determined
[see Additional file 5]. The non-rp TOP set contains genes
encoding translation elongation factors (eEF1A1, eEF1B
and eEF2), RNA-binding proteins (PABPc1 and
hnRNPA1), a major nucleolar protein (nucleoplasmin/
B25), a protein with tubulin-binding properties (TCTP/
p23), and two genes that do not encode proteins, but
rather have small nucleolar RNA-encoding sequences
embedded within their introns (gas5 and U17HG ). Annotated aligned sequences of the nine human and mouse
non-rp TOP genes are presented on pages 1 through 9 of
a supplementary file [see Additional file 6] and the results
are summarized in Table 3.
There are some notable differences in the promoter architecture of rp genes and non-rp TOP genes. First, GABPand YY1-binding motifs, which are prevalent in the rp
promoters, are rarely found in the non-rp TOP promoters
(Table 4a). Second, eight of the nine non-rp TOP promoters have conserved TATA boxes that would be expected to
bind TBP with high affinity, whereas only a third of the rp
promoters have such TATA boxes (Table 4b). These differences were considered to be statistically significant when
analyzed by Fisher's exact test (Table 4). The initiator

For the rp genes, the TATA box quality was scored as:

+/– when both orthologues are +/– or when one is + and the other is –, and – when both orthologues are – or when one is - and the other is +/–.
For the non-rp TOP genes, both orthologues were either + or –.

sequences of the non-rp TOP genes resemble the rp consensus (89 % identical from -2 to +7) except for the
roughly equal occurrence of C's and T's at +2.
The second set of ubiquitously expressed genes consisted
of 20 housekeeping genes randomly selected from the
eukaryotic promoter database [see Additional file 7]. The
promoters of these genes also have an under-representation of YY1 sites compared to the rp promoters, and like
both the rp and non-rp TOP genes, contain abundant
motifs for Sp1 (Table 4a). The proportion of these genes
that have TATA boxes with TBP-binding capability is similar to that observed for the rp genes (Table 4b).

Discussion
The foregoing analysis of 79 mammalian ribosomal protein genes has revealed several features of rp promoter
architecture, some of which are largely conserved over
long periods of vertebrate evolution (about 450 million
years) and others that are strongly conserved only in
mammals. (about 90 million years). One highly conserved feature, present in over 3/4 of the rp genes, is the
separation by an intron of the sequences involved in transcriptional and/or translational regulation from the
sequences with protein-encoding function. In 47 % of the
rp genes, the AUG translation initiation codon is in exon

2, and in 29 % of the genes, it is at the extreme 3' end of
exon 1. It would seem that at an early stage of vertebrate
evolution, these regulatory sequences were appended as
discrete units to the loci containing the protein-encoding
sequences.
The polypyrimidine tract that spans the tsp is present in all
vertebrate rp genes. This tract can function as a transcriptional initiator [40,41] and also embraces the TOP
sequence, which is essential for the translational control
of rp mRNAs [7,42]. Based on the assignments of human
and mouse tsp's used in the present study, the average
lengths of the polypyrimidine tracts and TOP sequences
are 12.2 bp and 8.2 bp, respectively. A compilation of conserved sequences in the -8 to +10 regions of orthologous
human and mouse rp genes revealed the consensus
sequence (Y)2C+1TY(T)2(Y)3. Thus, in addition to the C at
the tsp, there is a clear preference for T over C at positions
+2, +4, and +5. This preference may reflect a structural
bias for transcription, e.g., ease of strand separation, or for
translation, e.g., affinity of rp mRNAs for a putative
repressor.
The presence of transposable element residues in the 5'
flanks of the rp genes is noteworthy. Half of the rp genes
contain an element (sines for humans, B1/B2 for mouse)

Page 11 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:15

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/15

within 500 bp of the tsp, and over 80 % of the genes
contain an element within 900 bp. Some elements are
moderately conserved between mouse and human, but
most appear to be lineage-specific. These elements are
unlikely to have any specific role in rp promoter function.
They may be passively tolerated because the vast majority
of conserved 5' sequence is confined to within 200 bp of
the tsp. Within a segment from -200 to +100, the sequence
identity between human and mouse rp orthologues
ranges from 50 to 75 % with an average of 61 %, whereas
the sequence match beyond -200 is of borderline
significance.

mouse rp promoters. Previous experimental studies have
implicated GABP as a positive transcriptional regulator of
the mouse rpL30 and rpL32 genes [10,14], the human
rpS14 and rpS6 genes [20,22], and the Xenopus rpL18 gene
[24]. The GABP sites that positively contribute to transcriptional activity are generally located upstream of the
tsp, although in some cases, sites overlapping the initiator
or downstream of the tsp may also be relevant. In the
mouse rpS16 gene, GABP binding at the initiator
decreases transcription activity both in vivo and in vitro
[12]. For simplicity, only upstream, presumably positively
acting, GABP sites were included in the tabulation.

The observation that 35 % of the rp promoters contain a
TATA box motif at -25, which would be predicted to bind
TBP with high affinity, and that an additional 25 %
possess A/T-rich motifs, which might bind TBP with lower
affinity, was unexpected. The assessed quality of these
motifs for TBP binding, made according to rules established by a detailed structural study of TBP-DNA
complexes [38], was largely conserved between human
and mouse rp orthologues. Some of the promoters classified as poor (-) binders, e.g., rpL32 , might bind TBP
weakly without help from an additional protein [43,44],
so that the true proportion of rp promoters with TBPbinding capability might actually be greater than 60 %.
Thus, contrary to earlier views based on an analysis of a
small subset of rp genes, many of the rp promoters should
not be classified in the "TATA-less" category.

YY1 is a zinc finger-containing protein with a variety of
gene-specific functions, including transcriptional activation and repression, positioning of RNA polymerase II,
and chromatin modification [47,48]. Fifty-nine percent of
the human rp genes contain at least one YY1 site downstream of the tsp, 88 % of which are conserved in the
mouse orthologues. Two functionally relevant binding
sites for YY1 (originally termed "delta") were detected
downstream of the tsp in mouse rpL32 [15]. In mouse
rpL30 , a downstream YY1 interaction also contributed
positively to transcriptional activity, but only when a
strong upstream interaction with GABP was eliminated
[11]. Interestingly, the vast majority of YY1 sites are
located downstream of the tsp, and therefore, for simplicity, only downstream YY1 sites were included in the tabulation. The alignment of mammalian YY1 sites is
frequently preserved in chickens, frogs and fish, in contrast to the GABP and Sp1 sites, which rarely have aligned
counterparts in those species (Table 2). The aligned downstream site in Xenopus rpL18 was shown to interact with
the frog homologue of YY1, but the functional significance of this interaction was not demonstrable with the
reporter constructs that were used in these experiments
[25]. The diverse activities of YY1 in different promoter
contexts and its propensity for interactions with a wide
variety of proteins [49], have led to the idea that it may
have multiple mechanistic roles in transcriptional regulation. Which of these roles apply to the rp promoters
remains to be established.

When human and mouse rp promoter regions from -200
to +100 were scanned for conserved (aligned) transcription factor-binding sites with the rVISTA program [39],
which is based on consensus sequences and matrix tables
in the TRANSFAC database, three ubiquitously expressed
factors that had previously been implicated in rp promoter activity predominated. Using high stringency criteria, I detected aligned GABP- and Sp1- binding sites
upstream of the tsp and aligned YY1-binding sites downstream of the tsp in approximately half of the rp promoters. The occurrence of aligned motifs for other
ubiquitously expressed factors is considerably less, i.e.,
only about 10 % for any single factor. Whereas Sp1 sites
are also commonly found in the promoters of many
housekeeping genes, including the non-rp TOP genes, the
prevalence of GABP and YY1 sites appears to be a more
prominent feature of the rp promoters.
GABP is a heteromeric protein consisting of an ETS family
member, which has DNA-binding capability, and an
ankyrin repeat-containing subunit, which greatly
improves the stability of GABP-DNA interactions [45,46].
Two-thirds of the human rp promoters contain one or
more potential GABP-binding sites upstream of the tsp,
79 % of which are perfectly aligned in the orthologous

Based on the results of the analysis of rp promoter
sequences, I have sorted the different rp promoters into
eight classes according to whether they possess conserved
binding sites for the three prevalent transcription factors,
GABP, Sp1 and YY1 (Figure 6). Only 10 of the rp promoters do not appear to contain conserved binding sites for
any of the three factors, and considering the high stringency used for the analysis, the true number may even be
lower. Moreover, 8 of these 10 promoters contain nonconserved GABP, Sp1 or YY1 sites and/or conserved sites
for other ubiquitously expressed factors. TATA boxes with
predicted affinity for TBP are distributed among the pro-

moters of all eight classes. This classification might prove
useful for interpreting the results of experiments in which
cell-specific or physiologically induced variations in the
expression of different subsets of rp genes are observed. In
addition, when more extensive data on the relative transcription rates of rp genes or the relative abundance of rp
mRNAs become available, this classification might help
account for any as yet undetected variability.
It is worth noting that some ribosomal proteins can also
have extraribosomal functions [50,51]. Among the mammalian proteins that have been demonstrated or presumed to have additional functions are rpS3, rpS4, rpL5,
rpL7, rpL10, rpL13a, rpLP0 and rpLP2. While, collectively,
the promoters of the genes encoding these proteins do not
fall into any particular class, most contain conserved
binding sites for one or more of the three prevalent transcription factors and have TATA boxes with TBP-binding
capability. Recently, the protein RACK1/Asc1p, which had
previously been implicated in various signal transduction
processes, was shown to have the properties of an authentic 40S ribosomal protein [52]. When I analyzed the promoter structures of the orthologous human
(NM_006098) and mouse (NM_088143) genes that
encode this protein, I observed several features in common with the rp promoters. The tsp of the mammalian
RACK1 gene is embedded in a polypyrimidine tract that
conforms perfectly to the rp initiator consensus sequence.
Moreover, the promoter contains a TATA box of +/- quality, an aligned upstream binding motif for Sp1 and an
aligned downstream motif for YY1, but no readily detectable motifs for other ubiquitous transcription factors.
Interestingly, the features of this promoter resemble those
of the rpL13a gene, which also encodes a protein with
apparent pleiotropic function.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/15

Conclusions
A sequence comparison of the promoter regions of all 79
orthologous human and mouse ribosomal protein genes
has revealed several evolutionarily conserved features that
are characteristic of a high proportion of the rp gene set.
One such feature, which is also evident in the rp genes of
lower vertebrates, is the separation by an intron of the
sequences involved in transcriptional and translational
regulation from the sequences with protein encoding
function. Another conserved feature is the polypyrimidine
initiator, which in mammals conforms to the consensus
(Y)2C+1TY(T)2(Y)3. Contrary to previous impressions
based on studies of a small subset of rp genes, the majority
of rp promoters contain a TATA box or an A/T-rich motif
at -25 that should theoretically have TBP-binding capability. Similarly, approximately half of the rp promoters contain conserved binding motifs for transcription factors
previously implicated in rp gene expression, namely
upstream GABP and Sp1 sites and downstream YY1 sites.
Conserved motifs for other ubiquitous factors occurred
much less frequently. Transposable element residues
within 900 bp of 5'-flanking sequence were present in
over 80 % of the rp genes; very little sequence conservation was evident more than 200 bp upstream of the tsp.
Some of these architectural features were seen to be specific for rp promoters. From the results of this analysis, it
was possible to sort the rp promoters into eight classes
according to their possession of putative binding sites for
GABP, Sp1 and YY1, and also to specify which promoters
should have intrinsic affinity for TBP. This classification
might prove useful for interpreting the results of experiments in which cell-specific or physiologically induced
variations in the expression of different subsets of rp genes
are observed.

Methods
This analysis has highlighted features of rp promoter
architecture that are shared by a high proportion of the rp
genes. The evolutionary conservation of these features
lends strong support to their functional relevance. Yet,
superimposed on this general design are variations that
confer certain idiosyncratic characteristics on each
promoter. There does not seem to be a single master
switch that co-regulates all rp genes at the transcriptional
level. Rather, the rp promoters are tuned to respond to a
combination of factors, including components of the general transcription machinery, a relatively small group of
sequence-specific transcription factors, and modifiers of
chromatin structure. The inherent functional redundancy
and lack of dependence on any single factor are useful
design features for genes that must be expressed in a broad
spectrum of cell types and environmental situations.

The rp gene sequences were extracted from three database
sources [see Additional file 2]. The vast majority of
sequences were obtained from the UCSC database [53],
which conveniently uses uppercase and lowercase letters
to distinguish exon and flanking/intron sequences,
respectively. The remaining sequences were obtained
from the ncbi [54], Celera [55] and the recently available
RPG [56] databases. For alignment of human and mouse
rp promoter sequences I used mVISTA [57], which is
based on the AVID global alignment program [58]. The
locations of repetitive insertion sequence elements were
determined by the RepeatMasker program supplied with
mVISTA and, in many cases, corroborated by ncbi
annotations. Transcription factor-binding sites were
detected with the rVISTA program and the FindPatterns
tool of the GCG program. The analysis of non-rp TOP
genes was made similarly to that of the rp genes. A graphic
representation of the rp initiator consensus sequence was
obtained with the Weblogo program [59]. For alignment
