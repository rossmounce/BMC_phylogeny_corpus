Next generation sequencing and analysis of a
conserved transcriptome of New Zealand’s kiwi

Abstract
Background: Kiwi is a highly distinctive, flightless and endangered ratite bird endemic to New Zealand. To
understand the patterns of molecular evolution of the nuclear protein-coding genes in brown kiwi (Apteryx australis
mantelli) and to determine the timescale of avian history we sequenced a transcriptome obtained from a kiwi
embryo using next generation sequencing methods. We then assembled the conserved protein-coding regions
using the chicken proteome as a scaffold.
Results: Using 1,543 conserved protein coding genes we estimated the neutral evolutionary divergence between
the kiwi and chicken to be ~45%, which is approximately equal to the divergence computed for the humanmouse pair using the same set of genes. A large fraction of genes was found to be under high selective constraint,
as most of the expressed genes appeared to be involved in developmental gene regulation. Our study suggests a
significant relationship between gene expression levels and protein evolution. Using sequences from over 700
nuclear genes we estimated the divergence between the two basal avian groups, Palaeognathae and Neognathae
to be 132 million years, which is consistent with previous studies using mitochondrial genes.
Conclusions: The results of this investigation revealed patterns of mutation and purifying selection in conserved
protein coding regions in birds. Furthermore this study suggests a relatively cost-effective way of obtaining a
glimpse into the fundamental molecular evolutionary attributes of a genome, particularly when no closely related
genomic sequence is available.

Background
DNA sequencing technologies have enabled us to decipher molecular sequences of individual organisms. Conventional DNA sequencing methods relying on
fluorescent dideoxy terminators and capillary separation
revolutionized sequencing and allowed the first constructions of complete genomes of a number of species
from simple prokaryotes to higher vertebrates [1,2].
However the costs involved in eukaryotic genomesequencing projects using these methods has been very
high and thus such projects generally require the collaboration of several well-funded institutes. Furthermore
the time required for sequencing and assembling such
genomes can span several years. The advent of Next
Generation DNA sequencing has reduced the time and
expense of complete genome sequencing by orders of

magnitude [3,4]. For example using next generation
sequencing methods the complete genome of a human
individual was completed in eight weeks by spending
only a fraction of cost incurred using conventional BAC
and shotgun-based cloning and sequencing methods [5].
The major limitation of a next generation sequencing
approach is that the length of the sequence reads produced was until recently only 25-200 bases, as opposed
to over a kilobase generated by conventional capillarybased sequencing methods. Although short sequence
reads do not limit the amount of sequence data collected, this can hamper the assembly of the short
sequence reads into large contigs. Therefore the availability of a genome of a closely related organism is generally required (to act as a scaffold) for the successful
assembly of a new genome using the next generation
sequencing method. For example, the assembly of the
genomes of Neanderthal and Woolly Mammoth was
possible only because of the availability, respectively, of
complete human and African elephant genomes [6,7].

Recently new algorithms have been developed to
assemble genomes de novo without using a closely
related scaffold genome [8]. However for precise genome assembly using this software, substantial sequence
coverage is required. For example, using next generation
sequencing and de novo assembly the complete genome
of a Chinese panda was obtained at 50× (times) coverage [9]. Although the sequence required (150 gigabases)
was generated in only one month, the cost amounted to
several million US dollars. Therefore without the availability of a closely related organism, assembling complete genomes de novo would still be financially
restrictive for most research laboratories. An alternative
would be to use low-coverage next generation sequencing to sequence and assemble only the transcribed
regions of a genome (transcriptome).
Large-scale comparative genomic studies of avian genomes started soon after the chicken genome became
available [10]. These studies revealed mutational rate
differences among chromosomes by comparative analyses of chicken and turkey genomes [11,12]. With the
availability of the complete genome of the zebra finch
[13] a number of studies have examined genome-wide
patterns of molecular evolution and gene expression in
avian genomes [14-17]. However all these studies were
performed using only the Neognathae birds.
In the current study we have sequenced and assembled
a number of conserved protein-coding regions of an early
stage transcriptome of a Paleognathae bird, the North
Island Brown kiwi (Apteryx australis mantelli). Kiwi are
flightless birds endemic to New Zealand, and are of high
conservation importance. The purpose of this study was
to isolate conserved transcribed sequences of kiwi in
order to understand firstly the patterns of mutation and
selection amongst protein coding sequences and secondly
to use these nuclear gene sequences to reanalyze the
divergence time between Paleo- and Neognathae birds.

were used as a query to search over 22,000 chicken proteins using BLASTX. Significant hits were garnered and
redundant kiwi reads were excluded. Garnered kiwi
sequences were assembled into large contiguous segments. We used Blast2seq to align chicken proteins with
translated assembled reads of kiwi. Finally we retained
only the regions of the assembled reads where at least
90% of the amino acids aligned with their respective
chicken orthologs. Although this resulted in a significant
reduction in the number of kiwi genes retained, such an
approach was required to minimize lineage specific
duplicates. Furthermore we are confident that this
approach will exclude most of the transcribed pseudogenes, which generally have a high rate of substitution.
This stringent approach identified 1,543 kiwi genes. The
locations of the chicken-orthologs of kiwi genes on the
chicken chromosomes are shown in Figure 1. The average length of coding regions was 168 bp (Figure 2). Our
approach to assemble the transcriptome is somewhat
similar to a previous method, SCARF [18]. However
SCARF is suitable only if the reference scaffold genome
is closely related to the target genome with a synonymous divergence of <0.1.
Embryonic expression levels of kiwi genes

genes reflect their expression levels. We found two
genes with very high (> 2000 copies) expression levels.
While we identified (through the functional annotation
of its chicken ortholog) the product of one of these
genes as a neuropeptide the function of the other could
not be determined. We grouped kiwi genes into three
categories based on their levels of expression. Roughly
14% of the genes were highly expressed (> 5 copies)
while 50% of the genes appeared to be present as single
copies in kiwi embryo (Figure 3A). Conversely the small
fraction of highly expressed genes constituted approximately 59% of the expressed mRNAs in the embryo,
whereas only 13% of the mRNAs were from genes with
low expression levels (Figure 3B). For this analysis we
did not include the two genes with very high expression
levels (mentioned above) to avoid bias due to these outliers. Gene annotations show that most of the highly
expressed genes were those involved in protein synthesis
such as ribosomal proteins, elongation factors, tRNA
synthetases, as well as structural proteins such as
collagen.
Evolutionary divergence at neutral and constrained sites

An important parameter used extensively in genome
analyses is the rate of molecular evolution. To examine
the rate of neutral evolution we compared the concatenated kiwi transcripts with those of chicken. A likelihood-based distance analysis showed that divergence at
neutral synonymous sites was 0.465 substitutions per
site. Conversely, divergence at nonsynonymous positions was only 0.071 substitutions per site; over an
order of magnitude less than that of neutral divergence
and suggests that high levels of purifying selection are

acting on amino acid replacement sites. This is perhaps not surprising as the genes analyzed in this study
are expressed early in embryonic development and
therefore most are expected to be highly conserved.
The average ratio of nonsynonymous- to synonymous
divergences (dN/dS) was 0.15 (± 0.002), which is comparable to that estimated using chicken-zebra finch
sequences for the genes expressed in zebra finch
embryo [16]. A previous study using zebra finch and
emu (another palaeognathae bird) estimated the divergences at synonymous and nonsynonymous positions
to be 0.47 and 0.04 respectively [19]. However we

found a much higher divergence between zebra finch
and kiwi at synonymous (0.53) and nonsynonymous
(0.07) positions, which suggests that the rate of evolution in kiwi might be faster than that of emu.
The distribution of the dN/dS ratio estimated for individual genes shows that over 60% of the genes were
highly constrained (dN/dS < 0.1) (Figure 4). On the other
hand only 5% of the genes had a high (> 0.5) dN/dS ratio.
Among these we found 25 genes that appear to be evolving under positive selection (dN/dS > 1.0). However the
difference between the dN and dS estimates was not statistically different (higher) for any gene. This is primarily
due to the high variance in the estimates, caused by the
short sequence length of the partial genes used in this
analysis and this adversely affects dS estimates over dN
estimates, as synonymous sites are fewer than replacement sites. A previous study observed a higher rate of
evolution in the zebra finch lineage compared to chicken
using anole lizard as an outgroup [17]. We examined this
using kiwi as an outgroup and found an approximately
50% higher rate of evolution in the zebra finch lineage
compared to chicken at synonymous (49%) as well as at
nonsynonymous (57%) positions.
To compare sequence divergence between the birds
and mammals we obtained the orthologous human and
mouse genes and used the alignment that contained
only the aligned regions from kiwi, chicken, human and
mouse. Therefore we could examine the rates and patterns of evolution in the same genes and regions from
mammals and birds. This analysis using 616 genes

Strength of selection (dN/dS)
Figure 4 Distribution of kiwi genes under varying levels of
selective constraint. The strength of selection was determined by
the ratio of divergence at nonsynoymous positions (dN) to the
divergence at synonymous sites (dS). The divergence (substitutions
per site) was estimated for 1,543 kiwi-chicken orthologus gene pairs
using PAML [31].

showed that the divergence at synonymous sites
between chicken and kiwi was almost identical to that
between human and mouse (0.453 Vs 0.465, P = 0.13).
Therefore the mutation rates of mammals and birds
could be similar if the divergence times between
human-mouse and chicken-kiwi splits are comparable.
Molecular data based studies estimates suggest a ~115
My split for primates-rodents divergence [20] and a
~130 My split for paleo-neognathae birds [21,22].
Furthermore fossil-based estimates also suggest a similar
divergence time for the primates-rodents split (62 My 100 My) and for palaeognathae-neognathae split [23].
However the nonsynonymous divergence for the
chicken-kiwi pair was significantly higher than that estimated for the human-mouse comparison (0.055 Vs
0.028, P < 0.0001). This suggests that despite the similarity in neutral substitution rates between mammals
and birds, the magnitude of purifying selection appears
to be much higher in the former than the latter.
Although the low coverage of our sequence data might
include some sequencing errors (< 0.005 per site) it will
not significantly affect our results as the comparative
analyses presented here involve only distantly related
species.
Previous studies showed a low nonsynonymous divergence in highly expressed genes, owing to a higher
selection constraint on these genes [24,25]. We examined this for the kiwi-chicken species pair and found
that this also holds true for these avian species. We
found that the highly expressed genes are generally
highly constrained and conversely the rate of evolution
at nonsynonymous sites of the genes with low expression levels showed a large variation [see also [25]].
Therefore a simple correlation analysis does not capture
the actual relationship between expression level and the
rate of nonsynonymous site evolution. Hence, we estimated the divergences at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites of genes with high, medium and low
expression levels by concatenating the genes in each
group. The nonsynonymous divergence of genes with
low expression levels was found to be 50% higher than
that of the genes with a high expression level (0.082 vs
0.054) and this difference was statistically significant
(P < 0.0001) using a Z-test (Figure 5A, red). However
the divergence at synonymous sites of lowly expressed
genes was not significantly different to that of the highly
expressed genes (0.464 vs 0.458 P = 0.58) (Figure 5B,
red).
The expression levels determined for kiwi genes might
be influenced by the level of coverage of individual
genes. Therefore we obtained the expression levels for
the orthologous chicken genes using an embryonic
chicken library (with 22000 ESTs) [26]. Only those
genes that had a high expression level (> 5 copies of

0.0001). The difference in the synonymous divergences
between the genes with low and high expression levels
was only 14% but was statistically significant (0.483 Vs
0.425, P = 0.002). This result suggests very weak selection in synonymous sites of conserved genes of birds.

designated as highly expressed genes. Similarly we determined the genes with medium and low expression
levels. Although this reduced the number of genes in
our analysis, this stringent approach also produced similar relationships between expression levels and the
divergences (Figure 5A and 5B, blue). This analysis
showed an almost two fold higher nonsynonymous
divergence for lowly expressed genes than that of the

To determine the functions associated with the kiwi
proteins we obtained the functional annotations of their
orthologous chicken counterparts from the Biomart
resource ENSEMBL http://www.ensembl.org. Our search
using the gene ontology classification of chicken genes
resulted in the identification of gene function for ~500
genes. We found that the majority of the kiwi genes
(41%) code for DNA/RNA- or protein-binding proteins
(Figure 6A). This is not surprising as these proteins are
largely involved in the control of transcription; an
important regulatory activity expected in developing
embryos. Furthermore proteins that regulate translation
were found to constitute roughly 8%. Other major fractions of proteins detected were those that perform
housekeeping functions such as catalysis (enzymes)
(22%) and transport (17%).
We also determined the types metabolic pathways
with which the kiwi genes are involved. This was done
using information from the KEGG pathway database
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html for the
chicken genes, which were then assigned to the corresponding orthologous kiwi genes. Figure 6B shows that
roughly a quarter of kiwi genes were involved in genetic
information processing pathways, which includes DNA
replication and transcription. Approximately 27% and
21% of the genes were found to be associated with cellular and metabolic processes respectively. The remaining
14% of genes were shown to be involved in immunity
and the endocrine system and 11% of the genes were
associated with environmental processing including
transport and signal transduction.
Divergence times between Paleo- and Neognathae

We attempted to determine the divergence time
between paleo- and neognathae birds as well as that
between Galloanseriformes and the remaining neognathae birds. For this purpose we compared the genomes of neognathae birds (chicken and zebra finch), a
reptile (anole lizard) and used a mammal (human) as an
outgroup. The orthologous sequences of these genomes
were obtained using reciprocal BLAST. This resulted in
an orthologous dataset of 702 genes and included only
those protein-coding sequences that align with the kiwi
transcripts. The nucleotide sequences of all genes were
concatenated and the branch lengths were estimated

using BASEML under a general time reversible model of
sequence evolution using the tree topology shown in
Figure 7. First we conducted a simple direct estimation
of the divergence times using pair-wise ML distances
and a calibration time of 255 My (million years)
between reptiles and birds. The latter was obtained from
fossil studies [27]. This yielded a time of 130 My for the
paleo- and neognathae split (using a kiwi and chicken/
zebra finch pair) and 110 My for Galloanseriformes and
other neognathae birds (chicken and zebra finch pair).
Similar divergence times were obtained using a fossil
calibration time of 310 My for the bird-mammal divergence [28]. We also performed a more rigorous Bayesian
approach using the program Mutidivetime [29]. The
divergence time estimates were 132 My (80 My - 170

My) for the paleo- and neognathae birds and 120 My
(70 My - 150 My) for chicken-zebra finch pair, which
are similar to those obtained using the direct method
(Figure 7). Furthermore, we estimated the divergence
times using BEAST without forcing any phylogenetic
relationship among the species. Using the three birds
and the anole lizard sequences we obtained the divergence times estimate by calibrating the molecular clock
using the avian-reptile fossil based divergence time of
255 My. This analysis produced an estimate of 157 My
(143 My -173 My), which is slightly higher than that
obtained using the previous method. However, the confidence or HPD (Highest Posterior Density) intervals
obtained from BEAST were within those obtained using
Multidivtime. The divergence time computed by BEAST
for the chicken-zebra finch split was 122 My (110 My134 My), which is similar to that obtained using Multidivtime. Furthermore, we estimated the divergence
times directly using the neutral synonymous evolutionary rates estimated by a previous study. A previous
study using over 8,000 protein coding genes from
chicken, zebra finch and anole lizard estimated the rate
of neutral synonymous site evolution to be 1.23 × 10-9
to 2.21 × 10-9 [17]. Using an average rate of 1.7 × 10-9

Subramanian et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:387

and a synonymous divergence of 0.452 we estimated the
divergence time between kiwi (Paleognathae) and
chicken (Neognathae) to be 133 My. Similarly using this
rate and the neutral distance of 0.417, the divergence
time for chicken-zebra finch pair was computed to be
123 My. Clearly the divergence times estimated in this
study using the three different methods are largely similar. Furthermore these time estimates are comparable to
those obtained using complete avian mitochondrial genomes [21,22].

Conclusions
Using next generation sequencing technology our study
provides some important insights into the conserved
kiwi transcriptome. The neutral divergence at conserved
protein coding genes of kiwi and chicken was found to
be comparable to the synonymous divergence between
human and mouse. However the divergence at amino
acid replacement positions of these birds is much higher
than the mammals suggesting a greater selective pressure in the latter. Similar to the observations from the
studies on mammals, a negative relationship between
gene expression levels and rate of protein evolution was
found in birds. This study provides divergence time estimates between paleognathae and neognathae birds
based on >700 nuclear genes.
The conserved kiwi transcriptome data reported here
are useful for further specific studies on kiwi genetics
and will assist future complete kiwi genome sequencing
efforts, specifically in aiding genome assembly and
determining gene structure. Importantly, our study provides a cost effective way to perform preliminary genome-based analyses and allows examination of some
fundamental developmental and evolutionary processes
of a species in the absence of a closely related genome.
Methods
Kiwi embryo

A young male kiwi embryo (sample k11-15) was kindly
provided by Suzanne Bassett from the University of
Otago, New Zealand. The embryo was void of any discernable structures and resembled an asymmetric gelatinous mass of approximately 15 mm in diameter. The
small size and lack of obvious features suggested the
embryo was at a very early stage of tissue building.
RNA extraction and preliminary transcriptome
characterization

Several 2 mm 2 slices were removed from equispaced
regions around the kiwi embryo, combined, and total
RNA was extracted using Trizol™, then precipitated with
ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of Milli-Q water. Five
microlitres of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 50
μl volume containing 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.8, 75 mM

KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM DTT, 100 ng oligodT 18
0.5 mM of each dNTP, and 200 U of Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase. The mix was incubated at 42°C for 1 hr and extracted with phenol:chloroform. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was
precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol,
washed with 80% ethanol, and the resulting pellet was
resuspended in 40 ul of H2O. Complementary DNA was
amplified in 10 μl reactions containing 50 mM Tris-Cl
pH 8.8, 20 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg/ml
BSA, 200 uM of each dNTP, 40 ng of each primer, and
~0.3 U of platinum Taq (Invitrogen). The reaction mix
was overlaid with mineral oil and subjected to amplification in a Hybaid OmniGene thermal cycler using the
following parameters: 94°C for 2 min (× 1), 94°C for
20 sec, 54°C for 20 sec, 72°C for 20 sec (× 15), and then
94°C for 20 sec, 50°C for 20 sec, and 72°C for 20 sec (×
30). Amplified DNAs were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE), stained
with 50 ng/ml ethidium bromide in TBE, and then
visualized over UV light. Positive amplifications were
purified by centrifugation through ~40 μl of dry Sephacryl™S300HR and then sequenced at the Allan Wilson

Transcriptome preparation and amplification for FLX
sequencing

Approximately 10 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligodT18 as outlined above, and second
strand cDNA was synthesized in the same tube by adding 40 μl of 5× second strand buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl
pH 7.0, 25 mM MgCl 2 , 450 mM KCl, 50 mM (NH 4 )
2SO4), 4 μl of a 10 mM solution of each dNTP, 7 ul of
100 mM DTT, 20 U of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and
water to 200 ul. The mix was incubated at room temp
for 2 hrs, before the addition of 5 U of T4 DNA polymerase I to blunt the dsDNA ends, and the dsDNA was
purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol
precipitation. The dsDNA pellet was resuspended in

Subramanian et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:387
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/387

10 ul of 1 × Promega ligase buffer and then ligated
together overnight at 4°C with 3 U of T4 DNA ligase. The
ligated DNAs were purified and precipitated as described
and resuspended in 10 μl of water. One microlitre of the
DNA was then amplified using Templify (Amersham) as
instructed by the manufacturer, and a sample of the
amplified DNA was checked by gel electrophoresis.
Approximately 2 μg of the amplified DNA was purified
and sent to the University of Otago High-ThroughputDNA Sequencing Unit for megasequencing by FLX.
The amplified DNA was fragmented by nebulization.
Sequencing adaptors were then ligated to the ends of
these fragments and fragments that contained both
adaptors were selected using biotin/streptavidin Library
Immobilization Beads (Roche). The kiwi transcriptome
library was not titrated. Instead an emPCR loading density of 1.5 copies per beads was chosen. Following this,
the kiwi transcriptome library was annealed to enough
DNA capture beads for 16 emulsions reactions of an
emPCR I shotgun sequencing kit (Roche).
Assembly of FLX sequence reads

The amplified kiwi cDNA library was prepared and
sequenced using 454 FLX sequencing chemistry, which
generated 75,632 sequence reads with an average length
of 171 bp. These reads were used as queries to search a
database of 22,000 chicken proteins downloaded from
GenBank. We used BLASTX to translate the coding
sequences into all six reading frames. Significant threshold levels were based on query protein length, as
described before [30]. Homopolymer tracts and adaptors
were removed using perl scripts as well as by manual
examination. The number of kiwi reads that had significant hits with the chicken proteome were found to be
23,417 (31%). If there were more than two overlapping
fragments the most frequent base was used to determine
the consensus. These sequences were assembled using
the criteria of a 20 bp identical overlap. Using blast2seq,
chicken proteins and the translated segments were
aligned and assembled. We used a stringent approach
and extracted only the regions of kiwi coding sequences
that had at least 90% identity to those of chicken. This
conservative approach resulted in identification of 1,543
kiwi protein-coding genes with an average aligned (with
chicken) length of 168 bp. This alignment did not show
any bias in the genic location of the kiwi reads, as
roughly 49% of the reads are from the 3’ terminus of
the genes and 51% are from the 5’ terminus. Redundant
(identical or subsets of) sequences were excluded from
further analysis.
Evolutionary rate estimation

The rate of evolution was estimated using conserved
kiwi-chicken sequences. Sequence alignments from all

Page 8 of 10

1,543 genes were concatenated and the divergences at
synonymous and nonsynonymous sites were estimated
using the pair-wise option of the CODEML program
[31]. This approach was also followed for groups of
genes such as highly expressed genes. Furthermore
pair-wise likelihood distances at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites were also estimated for individual
genes. Since the lengths of the sequences recovered
were short (~168 bp) the dS estimates for individual
genes are subjected to higher stochastic errors than
the dN estimates, which might result in overestimation
of the dN/dS ratios due to very small dS values.
However we found only 10 genes with a very low dS
(< 0.01) and therefore the genic dN/dS ratios obtained
for most of the genes were not affected by this
overestimation.
Estimation of divergence times

Using a reciprocal BLAST hit approach [32] orthologous
genes from three other vertebrates zebra finch, anole
lizard, and human were also obtained. Protein sequences
of five genomes (including chicken and kiwi) were
aligned using CLUSTALW [33] and only those regions
that aligned with the partial kiwi proteins were
extracted. cDNA sequences of all these genomes were
aligned using the protein alignments as a guide. The
resultant 702 genes from five genomes were concatenated. Since the phylogenetic relationship between these
five species is well known, the tree topology (as in Figure 7) was used to obtain the branch lengths using the
program BASEML from PAML [31]. For this analysis a
GTR+gamma (five categories) model was used.
To estimate divergence times we followed a Bayesian
based approach implemented in the software Multidivtime [29,34]. The molecular clock was calibrated using
the well documented fossil-based estimate of 255 My
(252 My - 257 My) for the reptile-avian split [27] and
the human sequence was used as an outgroup. The
lower and upper constraints used in the program were
230 My and 280 My. We used 255 My as the expected
time between the (ingroup) root to the tip (rttime). The
prior rate was calculated as the ratio of the median of
the branch lengths from root-to-tip and the time
elapsed as per the suggestion given in the documentation (Thorne and Kishino 2002). The prior standard
deviation was kept as 50 My. Other priors used were as
outlined in the Multidivtime documentation. Furthermore we used BEAST [35] to estimate the divergence
times without constraining any phylogenic relationship
among the species. For this purpose we used three birds
and the lizard protein coding sequences. We used the
Tamura Nei +Gamma model for sequence evolution
and the reptile-bird fossil based divergence time to calibrate the molecular clock.
