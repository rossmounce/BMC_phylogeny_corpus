Origin and global diversification patterns of
tropical rain forests: inferences from a complete
genus-level phylogeny of palms
Thomas LP Couvreur1,3*, Félix Forest2 and William J Baker2*

Abstract
Background: Understanding how biodiversity is shaped through time is a fundamental question in biology. Even
though tropical rain forests (TRF) represent the most diverse terrestrial biomes on the planet, the timing, location
and mechanisms of their diversification remain poorly understood. Molecular phylogenies are valuable tools for
exploring these issues, but to date most studies have focused only on recent time scales, which minimises their
explanatory potential. In order to provide a long-term view of TRF diversification, we constructed the first complete
genus-level dated phylogeny of a largely TRF-restricted plant family with a known history dating back to the
Cretaceous. Palms (Arecaceae/Palmae) are one of the most characteristic and ecologically important components
of TRF worldwide, and represent a model group for the investigation of TRF evolution.
Results: We provide evidence that diversification of extant lineages of palms started during the mid-Cretaceous
period about 100 million years ago. Ancestral biome and area reconstructions for the whole family strongly
support the hypothesis that palms diversified in a TRF-like environment at northern latitudes. Finally, our results
suggest that palms conform to a constant diversification model (the ‘museum’ model or Yule process), at least
until the Neogene, with no evidence for any change in diversification rates even through the Cretaceous/
Paleogene mass extinction event.
Conclusions: Because palms are restricted to TRF and assuming biome conservatism over time, our results suggest
the presence of a TRF-like biome in the mid-Cretaceous period of Laurasia, consistent with controversial fossil
evidence of the earliest TRF. Throughout its history, the TRF biome is thought to have been highly dynamic and to
have fluctuated greatly in extent, but it has persisted even during climatically unfavourable periods. This may have
allowed old lineages to survive and contribute to the steady accumulation of diversity over time. In contrast to
other plant studies, our results suggest that ancient and steady evolutionary processes dating back to the midCretaceous period can contribute, at least in part, to present day species richness in TRF.

Background
Tropical rain forests (TRF) are the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the planet [1]. They are characterised by a closed, multilayered canopy dominated by
flowering plants (angiosperms [1]) and occur only in
frost-free areas with high mean monthly temperatures
and precipitation, and low seasonality [2]. Today, TRF
covers just 7% of the Earth’s surface [3] in equatorial

zones of the Americas, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, and
is highly threatened by human activity [4]. The origin
and evolution of species-rich biomes raises fundamental
questions in evolutionary biology [5] and, as such, the
diversification of TRF has been much debated [3,6].
Even though it is generally agreed that TRF is a relatively
old biome, the location and timing of its origin remain
uncertain mainly because the fossil record for tropical
regions is highly incomplete, especially during the Cretaceous [7,8]. Some direct [9] and indirect [10] evidence suggests that TRF was present in the mid-Cretaceous period
(100 million years ago (Ma)) at middle paleolatitudes (for
example, Laurasia) while other studies indicate that the

first paleoflora attributable to modern day TRF are found
in the Early Paleocene of North America [11] and Late
Paleocene of South America [7,8,12] and Africa [13-15].
Whereas previous views suggested that the TRF biome
has been ecologically stable over long periods of time
[16], more recent data indicate that it is highly dynamic
[17] having fluctuated both in extent [14,18] and in the
diversity of plants that it sustains [7,8]. These views
have led to three general evolutionary hypotheses that
explain the high levels of present day species diversity
found within TRF: (i) early, rapid speciation in response
to favourable climatic conditions followed by a deceleration of diversification rates due to global cooling [19]
and contraction of TRF (referred to here as the ‘ancient
cradle model’, see [10,20,21]); (ii) constant diversification
rates coupled with low extinction rates leading to a gradual accumulation of lineages in response to a long-lasting and stable tropical ecosystem (the ‘museum model’,
see [16,22]); and (iii) an increase in diversification rates
towards the present in response to climatic, tectonic or
biotic changes (the ‘recent cradle model’, see [23-25]).
These hypothetical processes result in alternative lineage
accumulation through time and thus different patterns
of inferred branch length distributions (Figure 1). Several phylogenetic studies of TRF plant groups have provided evidence in support of the recent cradle model of
diversification [25-27]. However, these studies were
restricted to low taxonomic levels (species) and thus do
not enhance our understanding of how these hypotheses

might apply throughout the entire history of TRF, for
example, on the long-term diversification dynamics of
TRF. In contrast, studies of the early diversification of
TRF plant lineages that permit tests of the above
hypotheses are rare.
In the absence of a complete fossil record for tropical
rain forests, family-level diversification analyses of large
pantropical angiosperm groups that are ecologically characteristic of TRF can provide important insights into the
historical construction of the biome [5]. In this respect,
the pantropical palm family (Arecaceae/Palmae) presents
an ideal study group. First, palms are among the most
important and characteristic components of TRF ecosystems worldwide in terms of species diversity (approximately 2,400 species), abundance of individuals and
impact on the environment [28-30]. Based on the excellent taxonomic knowledge for this family [28], we calculated that over 90% of its species diversity is restricted to
TRF (Figure 2). Water and energy-related variables are

strong determinants of palm diversity [31,32] and fundamental anatomical constraints inhibit palms from colonising cold environments [33,34]. Second, the known
history of palms extends far back into the Cretaceous
although the details of the spatiotemporal origin of the
family remain controversial [28]. Direct evidence from
unambiguous fossils associated with palms suggest that
the family was already present during the Turonian (8993.5 Ma, [35-37]) while more doubtful fossils have been
recorded since the Aptian (112 Ma, [28]). More recently,
several molecular clock estimates based on angiosperm
wide phylogenies suggested a stem age for the family ranging from 91 to 120 Ma [38-41]. These studies were
based on a very limited sampling within the family and
thus do not provide reliable approximations for the
crown node age and early diversification history. To date,
most estimates of palm ages have focused on subfamily
[42,43] or tribal levels [44-46].
Here we investigate the origin and diversification of
palms in space and time using the first complete genericlevel sampling for any important TRF-restricted plant
family [47]. We estimated speciation events under a Bayesian framework using a relaxed molecular clock approach
(BEAST, [48]), while the spatial origin of the family was
inferred under a maximum likelihood method that implements the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model [49,50].
Finally, we use palms as a model to explore the evolution
of TRF biodiversity by testing which of the three TRF
diversification hypotheses outlined above corresponds to
the diversification history of the family.

Results and discussion

Ma, 95% highest posterior density (HPD) 108-92 Ma).
The Cretaceous represents an important period for
plant evolution as it witnessed the rise and diversification of flowering plants [51,52]. The fossil record indicates that from the Albian to the middle Cenomanian
angiosperms diversified extensively, becoming more
abundant relative to other plants and establishing themselves as a major part of paleofloras by the end of that
period [53]. Our maximum likelihood analysis of geographic range evolution indicates that the most likely
distribution of the most recent common ancestor of
palms was centred on present day Central/North America and Eurasia, which corresponds to the Laurasian
landmass at that time (Figure 3a). Notably, the oldest
reliable palm fossils (Turonian to Campanian) have all
been discovered in Europe and North America [28]. A
Laurasian origin for palms was previously suggested by
Uhl and Dransfield [54] based on the prevalence of
putatively primitive lineages in the northern hemisphere.
From this ancestral area several subsequent dispersal
events are inferred into the equatorial regions of South
America, Africa and South East Asia, the present day
distribution of palms. Finally, our ancestral biome analysis suggests that the earliest palm lineages were
restricted to TRF (P = 0.984; Figure 3b and Table 1), a
result that was further supported by a test of phylogenetic signal of the biome. In fact, adaptation to nonTRF biomes did not arise until the Paleocene within the
fan palm subfamily Coryphoideae. Thus, our results support the notion that palms originated in a TRF-like
biome and started to diversify during the mid-Cretaceous period in Laurasia.

Evolutionary origin of palms

The fossil-calibrated molecular dating of a complete
genus-level palm supertree [47] provides for the first
time minimum age estimations for all major groups of
the palm family (Table 1). The resulting chronogram
(Figure 3b) suggests that the diversification of extant
lineages of palms started in the mid-Cretaceous period
at the Albian-Cenomanian boundary (crown node: 100

Origin of tropical rain forests

The presence of TRF during the mid-Cretaceous period
is controversial because pre-Cenozoic fossils associated
with TRF are notoriously sparse [8,11,55,56] in contrast
to the relatively well documented fossil evidence of TRF
during the early Cenozoic from equatorial to relatively
high palaeolatitudes [11-14,20,57]. The earliest fossil

flora interpreted as characteristic of TRF was found in
the early Cenomanian from several formations in North
America, for example, the Dakota formation of Kansas
(99 Ma, [9,53,58]), which is consistent with our results.
However, these conclusions, which were based on the
physiognomy of leaf characters, such as shape and size,
that are generally associated with megathermal vegetation [20,53], have been questioned by some authors (see
personal communication from Johnson in Morley [20]).
Several studies have suggested that during the Cretaceous plant biodiversity was highest at mid paleolatitudes
where the climate was more favourable while equatorial
latitudes were exposed to a drier and hotter climate
unlikely to have supported TRFs [20,59]. In addition,
simulations of major vegetation distributions during the
mid-Cretaceous period (100 Ma) indicate that the presence of TRF in the Cenomanian of North America and
Eurasia as well as other parts of the world is plausible
[14,60]. Finally, indirect evidence is provided by a diversification study of Malpighiales, a large plant order
mainly restricted to TRFs. Using a molecular clock
approach, it was estimated that the origin of this order
dates to around 114 Ma with subsequent diversification
during the Cenomanian [10], implying the presence of
TRF at that time.
Even though molecular dating methods have been criticised in relation to interpretations of TRF origins [12]
and are not assumption free, such approaches have
played important roles in understanding the construction of other species rich biomes (for example, the Cape
flora [61,62]) and provide important insights when the
fossil record is sparse or incomplete. Molecular dating
of palms, one of the most characteristic TRF plant
families, provides additional evidence that modern TRF
might have already been in place 100 Ma, significantly
earlier than suggested by unequivocal fossil evidence
[13,57]. It is most likely that formation of the TRF
biome was a gradual process and thus the precise time
at which modern TRFs can be recognised may be
impossible to pinpoint. However, our results and other
evidence discussed above [9,10,53] imply that the assembly of the TRF biome had already started during the
mid-Cretaceous period and was not just a strictly Cenozoic process. It is puzzling that, to our knowledge, no
macrofossil of palms has been recovered in Cenomanian
deposits of North America [9]. However, our results
suggest that palms were just starting to diversify at this
time and may not have been widespread, thus reducing
the frequency of fossilization and probability of later discovery. Interestingly, studies of other species-rich TRF
plant families yield timings for the earliest extant lineage
diversification events (that is, crown node estimates)
that largely post-date palms, for example Leguminosae
(59 Ma, [63]), Annonaceae (89 Ma, [64]) and Rubiaceae

(86 Ma, [65]). This would imply that palms represent
one of the first extant plant families to have diversified
within TRF since its origin. Thus, palms not only play a
major role in present day TRF [28-30], but also appear
to have been a key component in the assembly and
diversity of this biome since the earliest stages of its
evolution.
Early diversification of tropical rain forests

To depict global diversification at the family level and
test the hypotheses of TRF diversification, we generated
a semilogarithmic lineage-through-time (LTT) plot as
well as 95% confidence intervals based on 1,000 randomly selected posterior trees from the BEAST output
(Figure 3c). LTT plots are widely used to characterise
the diversification of clades as a function of time
[66-68], but they are sensitive to incomplete taxon sampling [69,70], as is the case here (183 species sampled
out of circa 2,400, approximately 7.6%, see Additional
file 1). However, our sampling is phylogenetically representative and non-random as we included 100% of all
described palm genera. Such a sampling strategy has the
advantage of representing all the deeper nodes of the
phylogeny and can provide a good estimation of diversification history up to a point in time after which undersampling at shallower nodes biases the inference [71,72].
In order to restrict the interpretation of our LTT plot to
the more accurately estimated parts we used a novel
approach to identify a threshold after which the potential impact of incomplete taxon sampling becomes too
important to permit accurate analyses of diversification
rates (see Methods). Based on the chronogram, the percentage of total missing palm species increased sharply
from 12% to 28% after circa 24 Ma (Figure 3c). Interpretation of the LTT plot was thus restricted to the period
prior to that point in time (from 100 Ma to 24 Ma) and
all nodes occurring after the 24 Ma threshold were
excluded from subsequent analyses.
Between 100 Ma and 24 Ma, the LTT plot forms an
almost straight line, which suggests that the palm family
underwent a constant rate of diversification without any
major shifts or radiations [67,68]. This is also statistically supported by the better fit of the pure-birth model
of diversification (constant diversification rates with no
extinction) on the LTT plot than any other model tested
(ΔAICRC = -1.421 between the pure birth model and the
second best fitting model (the density-dependent or
‘DDX’ model); AIC = Akaike Information Criterion).
Moreover, the ΔAIC RC was not significantly different
under the null hypothesis of diversification rate consistency when calculated from 10,000 phylogenies simulated under the pure-birth process (P value = 0.739).
Finally, the g statistic [70] also supported a constant rate
hypothesis as it was not significantly different from zero

Couvreur et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/44

(g = -0.318, P value = 0.379). These results lend support
to the museum model (Figure 1) in which diversification
rates remain constant and extinction rates are low
[16,22]. This hypothesis was thought to be the consequence of the old and ecologically stable conditions of
TRF over millions of years. Even though such views
have now been replaced by the notion of greater dynamism in TRF evolution [14,17,73], the biome itself has
never completely disappeared [14,20] and has persisted
in refuges during unfavourable climatic times. The existence of such refuges may have allowed comparatively
old lineages to persist and contribute to present day
species diversity. For example, lineages of another
diverse TRF plant family, Annonaceae, were shown to
have persisted in possible TRF refuges of East and West
Africa for over 30 million years [74] even during climatically unfavourable times (for example, the global cooling of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary). We suggest
here that TRF refugia may have played a similar role
throughout the history of the palm family and, as a
result, global palm species diversity is at least partly the
result of a gradual accumulation of ancestral lineages
through time, and cannot be attributed to ancient or
recent speciation bursts alone.
At finer time scales, palm species diversity and diversification rates most likely fluctuated with extinction rates
possibly increasing and decreasing at specific time
frames in the past, perhaps in relation to climatic and
geological changes. For example, studies of the palynoflora through the Late Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum in Colombia indicate an increase in palm
morphospecies after this time (56.3 Ma, [8]). Thus, it is
probable that different clades within palms underwent
alternative diversification scenarios leading to a heterogeneous pattern of diversification among the lineages
within the family. However, our study implies that over
a larger time scale these changes did not influence the
overall global pattern of diversification in palms, at least
until 24 Ma. This is also apparent during the major
extinction episode at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary (K/Pg; [75]), which had no statistically significant
effect on diversification rates (Figure 3c).
To date, relatively few family-level studies have provided evidence for the museum model of tropical plant
diversification (Annonaceae [64], liverwort family Lejeunaceae [76]). This pattern contrasts with the study of
Malpighiales evolution, which indicated that all major
lineages originated within a short timeframe suggesting
an early rapid speciation of the order, although no
detailed diversification analysis was undertaken for this
group [10]. Interestingly, meta-analyses based on a large
number of species-level dated molecular phylogenies of
a range of plants and animals have also underlined the
importance of the constant rate diversification model

Page 6 of 12

[77,78]. Indeed a large number of phylogenies fitted the
simplest model of diversification. For example, Morlon
et al. [78], using a novel coalescent-based approach,
found that 87 out of 289 phylogenies studied (30%) better fitted the Yule process (time constant rates with no
extinction) than alternative models. Even though these
results were obtained from a wide range of organisms
occurring in different ecosystems, it nevertheless underlines the importance of such a simple process for
explaining present day diversity.
Given the threshold of 24 Ma imposed on our LTT
plot (Figure 3c), there is little indication about recent
(Neogene) diversification patterns. However, it is clear
that in order to attain present day species diversity
(Figure 3c), rates must have increased, which suggests a
shift in diversification that occurred after 24 Ma. This
could have been achieved either by accelerating diversification rates, consistent with the ‘recent cradle’ model,
or simply by higher overall constant rates. Recent high
speciation rates within other TRF plant genera have
been documented [13-15] and it seems likely that rapid
speciation occurred within some species-rich palm genera given the very young stem node age estimations we
inferred for them (for example, Pinanga, approximately
130 species, stem node approximately 12 Ma; Dypsis,
approximately 140 species, stem node approximately 13
Ma). In fact, the ‘museum’ and ‘recent cradle’ hypotheses are not mutually exclusive; both mechanisms could
be at work, possibly within different palm lineages and
different time frames. For example, both the ‘ancient’
and ‘recent’ cradle models of diversification have
been identified within the TRF-restricted leaf beetle
family [79].

Conclusions
Our results from one of the most important TRF plant
families suggests that present day TRF biodiversity can
at least in part be explained by a steady accumulation
of lineages dating back to the mid-Cretaceous period
and is not just the result of rapid radiations, either
recent [25] or ancient [10]. The analysis of additional
family-level diversification patterns of other TRF
restricted plant groups will undoubtedly shed more
light into the evolutionary forces that have led to the
immense diversity of species found within modern TRF
today.
Methods
Taxon sampling

This study builds upon the complete generic-level
supertree analyses of palms by Baker et al. [47], the
most extensive phylogenetic study of the family published to date. Here, the sampling is updated to be consistent with the latest family-wide monograph [28,80],

Couvreur et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/44

Page 7 of 12

in which 183 genera are accepted (see Additional file 1
for the list of genera used). This was performed by
repeating the supertree analyses of Baker et al. [47]
with the addition of published plastid DNA sequence
data for the recently described genus Tahina [81] (see
below). Three commelinid monocot outgroup taxa (Costus, Dasypogon, Zea) were selected from the sampling
of Baker et al. [47].
Fossil calibration

Palms have a rich fossil record dating from the Late
Cretaceous onwards. Although the record is unusually
rich among angiosperms, only a small fraction of palm
fossils can be identified to specific taxonomic groups
with confidence. Drawing on recent surveys of the palm
fossil record [28,82,83], we selected the most reliable
fossils (Table 2), judged on the basis of the credibility of
their purported taxonomic affinities and reported ages.
Nevertheless, none of these fossils is sufficiently informative to justify allocation to crown nodes [84]; they are
thus applied conservatively to stem nodes throughout.
Where authors provide a range of age estimates, we
have used the most recent date. Where a geological
time period alone is specified, we have used the date of
the upper end of that period [85].
The four selected fossils are widely distributed across
the family and are located in three out of the five subfamilies. The earliest fossils that can be assigned unequivocally to a taxonomic group within palms are Late
Cretaceous records of palmate leaves, the earliest of
which is Sabalites carolinensis from the late Coniacian
of South Carolina [86]. Although an affinity with Sabal
is implied by the genus name, the fossil could be linked
with many coryphoid groups and its age is therefore
used conservatively here as a calibration point for the
stem node of subfamily Coryphoideae as a whole with
an age of 85.8 Ma. Hyphaene kapelmanii, a fossil discovered at a late Oligocene site in Ethiopia [87], provides a
further calibration point within the Coryphoideae. This
fossil consists of a petiole fragment with a close resemblance to the modern genus Hyphaene due to the morphology of its wide, recurved marginal spines. We use

this fossil as a constraint for the stem node of subtribe
Hyphaeninae with an age of 27 Ma.
In subfamily Calamoideae, the unique structure of the
pollen of subtribe Mauritiinae corresponds closely to
fossil pollen in the genus Mauritiidites, specifically the
clavate monosulcate grains with each spine inset and a
swollen foot layer below. Mauritiidites has been
recorded as early as the Maastrichtian of Africa [88]
with numerous records soon after in the Palaeocene
onwards of South America [89]. We use it here as a
calibration for the stem node of the Mauritiinae with an
age of 65 Ma.
Fossil records of the coconut tribe Cocoseae, particularly
of fossilised endocarps, are numerous [28]. Until recently,
well documented records appeared from the Middle
Eocene onwards (for example, [90,91]), but new research
in the middle to late Palaeocene of Colombia has revealed
compression fossils of large fruits that closely resemble the
modern coconut, Cocos nucifera, both in size and surface
morphology [92]. In the absence of further substantiating
evidence, we allocate this fossil to the stem node of the
Attaleinae, the subtribe of tribe Cocoseae to which Cocos
belongs, with an age of 54.8 Ma.
Finally, a number of other reliable fossils could not be
used because they are made redundant by older fossils
assigned to more distal nodes. Nypa is most notable
here, given its outstanding macrofossil and microfossil
records dating back to the Maastrichtian [28,93]. Also
significant are the distinctive diaperturate fossil pollen
grains, usually referred to the form genus Dicolpopollis,
which can be assigned with confidence to tribe Calameae of the Calamoideae [82,83,94-96]. The earliest
records of this fossil palynomorph are from the Maastrichtian and its boundary with the early Palaeocene of
Somalia and Borneo [88,96].
For each fossil we applied an exponential prior, the
parameters of which are given in Table 2. Finally, the
stem node of palms was constrained by a uniform prior
ranging from 110 to 120 Ma. This corresponds to the
earliest monocot fossil [97]. By doing this we imply that
the stem of palms cannot be older than the oldest

Molecular dating was carried out using BEAST 1.5.3
[48,98]. For this analysis the ‘most congruent supertree’,
based on the method and data of Baker et al. [47], was
used as a topological constraint. This topology was
based on extensive data sampling, including DNA
sequence data, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and morphology, and represents the best
family-wide estimation of phylogenetic relationships
between palm genera to date. To update the taxonomic
sampling of the supertree, we repeated the supertree

analysis of Baker et al. [47]. This study used a matrix
representation with parsimony (MRP) analysis based on
input trees generated from individual partitions and
combinations of partitions with matrix elements
weighted in proportion to bootstrap values of corresponding input tree clades. The strict consensus tree of
this analysis was highly resolved with minor ambiguity
in tribe Trachycarpeae and parts of tribe Areceae only.
One most-parsimonious tree was selected at random
and used as a constraint. This tree was pruned to
include only the 183 genera accepted by Dransfield et
al. [28]. All DNA sequence datasets utilised by Baker et
al. [47] were included in our molecular dating analysis
(plastid DNA regions: atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL, rps16
intron, trnD-trnT, trnL-trnF, trnQ-rps16; nuclear DNA
regions: 18S, ITS, ms, prk, rpb2). The completeness of
taxonomic sampling for each of these regions varies
from 12% to 100%, with an average of 48%. Moreover,
sampling for the chloroplast markers was much more
complete than for the nuclear markers. Morphological
and RFLP datasets used by Baker et al. [47] were
excluded. The supertree topology was used as constraint
by deleting in the XLM BEAST input file the following
commands: subtreeSlide; narrowExchange; wideExchange; wilsonBalding. Each marker was individually
partitioned in BEAUTi 1.5.3 http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/
BEAUti and assigned the General Time Reversible
model (GTR) with gamma-distributed rate variation (G).
model of sequence evolution. Prior to our full analysis,
we investigated the effect of missing data on the estimation of ages. We undertook a preliminary analysis on 2
datasets: 1 with all the 13 markers (missing data present) and 1 where the 5 nuclear markers were removed
(missing data of 10%). A regression analysis between the
ages obtained for all nodes was highly significantly positive (R = 0.88; t test: P < 0.001) indicating that missing
data in our dataset are likely to have little influence on
age estimations in molecular dating. We then undertook
the full-scale analysis on the full 13-marker dataset.
In total, 8 individual analyses were carried out, 5 with
20 million generations and 2 with 30 million generations, resulting in a total of 160 million generations, and
sampling every 1,000th generation. Individual analyses
were performed in order to test for convergence of the
results. Tracer 1.4 [99] was used to check for convergence of the model likelihood and parameters between
each run. Results were considered reliable once the
effective sampling sizes (ESS) of all parameters exceeded
200. The resulting independent log and tree files were
then combined using LogCombiner discarding 10% of
generations as burn in per independent run.
Finally, deviation from a strict molecular clock was
tested by running the analysis a second time with the
strict clock enforced. We used the Bayes Factor as

implemented in Tracer 1.4 [99] to select the best-fitting
model under the smoothed marginal likelihood estimate
and with 100 bootstrap replicates [100]. This test
strongly supported the data as being non-clock like (ln
BF = 1,158.2 ± 3.2 in favour of relaxed clock hypothesis), and thus the results under the relaxed clock are
presented here.
Diversification analyses

To explore diversification rates in the family, we generated a semilogarithmic LTT plot. The mean LTT plot as
well as the 95% confidence intervals was generated from
a random selection of 1,000 posterior trees resulting
from the BEAST analysis. LTT plots are sensitive to
incomplete taxon sampling [70]. However, the full generic sampling of palm genera (100% of genera included)
means that sampling of extant lineages is complete in
the older parts of the phylogeny, becoming progressively
more incomplete towards the present [71,101]. In order
to avoid misinterpretation of the plot we restrict our
analyses to the accurately estimated part of the LTT,
which will be least influenced by the missing taxa. We
do this by finding the point at which incomplete taxon
sampling will likely begin to have a significant effect on
the LTT plot. Under the assumption that all genera are
monophyletic, speciation events within each genus will
always be found after the stem node of that genus.
Given the known age of each stem node for each genus,
we calculated a cumulative total for the number of missing species as a function of time. By doing this we generated a time-dependent curve representing the increase
of missing taxa from the origin of the family until the
present that quantified the amount of uncertainty each
part of the LTT plot contains (Figure 3c). In this study,
the proportion of missing taxa was less than 12% from
100 Ma to 24 Ma, at which time a dramatic increase
occurred with missing species rising to 24% and on to >
92% at the present time. This point represents the stem
age of the genus Calamus, the most species-rich genus
in palms [28]. All nodes occurring after this 24 Ma
threshold were deleted from subsequent diversification
analyses.
Two different approaches were used to test for significant changes in diversification rates. First, we used a
maximum likelihood method for fitting alternative diversification models to the LTT plot [102] using the R
package LASER 2.2 [103]. The test statistic for diversification rate constancy ΔAICRC is calculated as ΔAICRC =
AIC RC - AICRv, where AICRc is the AIC score for the
best fitting rate-constant diversification model, and
AICRv is the AIC for the best fitting variable-rate diversification model. A negative value for ΔAICRC indicates
that the data is best approximated by a rate-constancy
model. We fitted five different diversification models: (1)

Couvreur et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/44

the constant-rate birth model (the Yule process; [104])
with the speciation rate (l) being constant and the
extinction (μ) set to zero; (2) the constant-rate birthdeath model with two parameters, speciation (l) and
extinction (μ); (3) a pure birth rate-variable model
where the speciation rate l1 shifts to rate l2 at time ts,
with three parameters (l1, l2, ts); (4) an exponential
density-dependent speciation rate ‘DDX’ model; and (5)
a logistic density-dependent speciation rate ‘DDL’
model. The significance of the observed ΔAICRC was
evaluated by simulating 10,000 trees under a pure birth
constant diversification rate.
Second, we calculated the g statistic of Pybus and Harvey [70], which provides a summary of the distribution
of nodes in the phylogeny: if the internal nodes are closer to the root then g < 0; if they are closer to the tips
then g > 0; if the nodes are equally spread out then g =
0. The observed g statistic was compared with the distribution of the g statistic of 1,000 simulated phylogenies
under a pure-birth model using the LASER package 2.2.

climatic data, tectonic history and presence/absence of
postulated land bridges [14,19,20,106-108]. Five time
frames were delimited and dispersal probabilities were
assigned between all adjacent areas (see Additional file
1). Dispersal probabilities were set as following: low or
no dispersal = 0.01; low dispersal = 0.25; medium dispersal = 0.5; high dispersal = 0.75; areas adjacent or very
close = 1. Scripts in the programming language Python
http://www.python.org/ were generated using the online
helper http://www.reelab.net/lagrange. Because of the
large surface of each area (continent-level areas), the
maximum number of ancestral areas was limited to two.
The genus Cocos presented a special problem because
it is widely distributed across all areas. Such highly polymorphic states generally inject a high level of ambiguity
into the analyses, as was the case in preliminary analyses
here. Following the recommendations of Ronquist [109],
we allocated a putative ancestral area coding to Cocos
(area A) based on the findings of Meerow et al. [110].
Ancestral biome

Ancestral areas

A presence-absence matrix was built representing the
global distribution of palm genera (see Additional file 1
for the original data used to perform this analysis). We
defined seven, non-overlapping major palm areas that
reflect the distribution and endemism of genera as well
as broad scale geological units, as follows: (A) South
America, (B) North America (including Central American and the Caribbean), (C) Africa (including Arabia);
(D) Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mascarenes, Comoros
and Seychelles), (E) India (including Sri Lanka), (F) Eurasia (including west Malesia to the west of Wallace’s
Line) and (G) Pacific Ocean (including east Malesia to
the east of Wallace’s Line, Australia and the Pacific
Islands). Each genus was assigned to one or more of the
major palm areas based on its known current distribution [28,105].
Ancestral areas (AA) were reconstructed using a maximum likelihood method under the dispersal-extinctioncladogenesis model [49,50] as implemented in the software Lagrange build 20091004 [50]. We tested our
ancestral area reconstruction under two different biogeographic models (see Additional file 1 for the parameters used to perform these analyses). The first model
(M0) was unconstrained and we assigned an equal probability (P = 1.00) of dispersal between all areas during
the whole time period considered. This model assumes
that spatial relationships among areas have no effect on
biogeographical patterns. For the second model (M1 ),
we applied a more complex biogeographic scenario
incorporating prior information on range evolution as
well as dispersal probabilities between areas given discrete periods of time. This model was based on past

The probable ancestral biome at the crown node of
palms was reconstructed under a maximum likelihood
method using the Markov k-state 1 parameter model
(Mk 1 ) model of character evolution implemented in
Mesquite version 2.74 [10,111]. We assigned genera into
three different biome state categories following Olson
et al. [112]. State 0: predominantly ‘tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests’ biome (that is, TRF); state
1: ‘mangrove’; state 2: a general category that contains
genera not belonging to any of the two first categories
(that is, not TRF-restricted). State 2 is broad in its definition encompassing all other biomes for palms. When
a genus occurred in both TRF and non-TRF biomes it
was coded as ambiguous (see Additional file 1 for the
original data used to perform this analysis). The mangrove category was included to take into account the
ecology of Nypa. The phylogenetic signal of the biome
character was tested by randomising the tips of the phylogeny 1,000 times in Mesquite [111] in order to create
a null distribution of the number of steps under the
maximum parsimony criterion and the 99% confidence
intervals. This null distribution was compared to the
observed number of steps necessary to explain the
occurrence of each character on the phylogeny. In this
case, the observed value fell outside the 99% confidence
interval confirming that the biome category is phylogenetically conserved.
