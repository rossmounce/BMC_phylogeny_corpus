Abstract
Background: Sequence closure often represents the end-point of a genome project, without a
system in place for subsequent improvement and refinement. Building on the genome project of
Vibrio fischeri ES114, we used a comparative approach to identify and investigate genes that had a
high likelihood of sequence error.
Results: Comparison of the V. fischeri ES114 genome with that of conspecific strain MJ11 identified
82 target loci in ES114 as containing likely errors, and thus of high-priority for resequencing.
Analysis of the targets identified 75 loci in which an error had occurred, resulting in the correction
of 10,457 base pairs to generate the new ES114 genomic sequence. A majority of the inaccurate
loci involved frameshift errors, correction of which fused adjacent ORFs. Although insertions/
deletions are thought to be rare in microbial genome assemblies, fourteen of the loci contained
extraneous sequence of over 300 bp, likely due to imperfect contig ends that were misassembled
in tandem rather than as overlapping segments. Additionally we updated the entire genome
annotation with 113 new features including previously uncalled protein-coding genes, regulatory
RNA genes and operon leader peptides, and we analyzed the transcriptional apparatus encoded by
ES114.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that errors in microbial genome sequences, thought to largely be
confined to point mutations, may also consist of other prevalent large-scale rearrangements such
as insertions. Ongoing genome quality control and annotation programs are necessary to
accompany technological advancements in data generation. These updates further advance V.
fischeri as an important model for understanding intercellular communication and colonization of
animal tissue.

Background
In the thirteen years since the announcement of the first
complete organism genome [1], there has been a rapid
accumulation of sequence data from complete and draft
genomes. The number of complete or almost-complete

projects is in the range of 3,000 [2], but this number is a
"moving target," and improvements in sequencing technologies over the past decade ensure continued rapid
expansion in the number and diversity of organisms that
are analyzed by complete genome sequencing.

Despite these significant advances in data acquisition,
there have not been commensurate improvements in
data-quality assessment and refinement during this
period. Individual miscalled bases are assumed to be
present in practically all completed genome sequences,
and their frequency has been suggested to be between 1–
100 errors per 100 kb [3] and has been measured in some
instances to be at most 1 error per 88 kb [1,4]. Errors in
microbial genomes are believed to be generally restricted
to point miscalls, with large-scale rearrangements rarely
occurring [3]. To identify and correct errors, recent studies
have utilized microarray-based detection, in which errors
in a subject genome are identified by comparison to a reference genome which served as the basis for array construction. For example, this method has been employed
successfully in Escherichia coli [5] and Bacillus anthracis [6].
However, these analyses are unidirectional: "errors" are
defined as sequence distinct from that of the reference
genome, and therefore errors in the reference genome cannot be detected.
As small nucleotide changes in a genome model often
manifest as large protein errors – for instance, due to
introduction of frameshift and nonsense errors – multiple
approaches have capitalized on this protein signal to
detect DNA errors in complete genomes [7-10]. By comparing protein-coding sequences in a subject strain to
those in a closely-related strain or to closely-related proteins in molecular databases, one can identify those that
are potentially truncated inappropriately in the subject
strain and target those regions for resequencing. Targeted
resequencing has been applied successfully in B. subtilis
[10] and Mycobacterium smegmatis [11], and in both cases
the errors were restricted to changes in 1–2 nucleotides.
Importantly, Perrodou et al. [8] generalized this method
in silico to make it available to any subject organism of
interest. Targeted resequencing is efficient and available to
a wide range of investigators because: (i) the initial steps
are completed in silico prior to proceeding to the wet laboratory; and (ii) when a closely-related strain is available
targeted resequencing provides an efficient means to identify discrepancies that alter coding sequence predictions.
In this study, we focus on the genome of the luminous
Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio fischeri ES114. V. fischeri
forms symbiotic associations with squid and fish, and the
association between V. fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail
squid Euprymna scolopes represents one of the most powerful natural models for the study of mutualistic animalmicrobe relationships. Specific strains of symbiotic V.
fischeri colonize a dedicated "light organ" in the squid
host, multiply to high density, and exhibit luminescence
in a density-dependent manner [12,13]. The light produced by the bacteria is believed to aid the squid host by
providing protection from predators: the shadow revealed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/138

from the nocturnal-foraging squid in moonlight is camouflaged by the downward-welling light of the host-associated V. fischeri [14]. In return, the bacterium benefits
from a protected, nutrient-rich environment. This was the
first system in which it was shown that a specific symbiont
directs normal animal development [15], and now represents an emerging model for cross-kingdom genomicsbased studies.
The genomic potential for this system is based on a strong
history of molecular inquiry on both the symbiont and
host sides of the interaction. First, the complete genome
sequence of squid symbiont V. fischeri ES114 has been
published and studied, and the sequence revealed novel
insights into pilin gene diversity and the distribution of
toxin genes in beneficial bacteria [16]. Second, based on
the genome sequence a number of global studies have
been initiated; the first sets to be published yield novel
results about how chemical communication among V.
fischeri strains regulates bacterial behavior [17,18] and
how two-component signal transduction affects hostinteraction [19,20]. Third, an EST library of the squid host
[21] has provided novel insight into cephalopod genetic
capabilities and widely conserved signaling pathways
such as the NF-κB pathway [22]. Fourth, the phenomenon
we now call quorum sensing – autoinduced densitydependent cell-cell communication – was first described
in V. fischeri [23], and a number of evolutionary and modeling studies of this process have focused on the well-characterized systems in V. fischeri. Fifth, by having access to
the natural host – a rarity among systems in which highthroughput genetic and genomics approaches are applicable – we can exploit the high information content in the
coevolved squid-Vibrio relationship to learn how closelyrelated pathogenic marine microbes interact with natural
hosts that have yet to be identified. Sixth, the draft
genome of a second strain of V. fischeri, the fish symbiont
MJ11, is being completed and will provide a strong platform for applying comparative genomic approaches to the
study of host-specificity.
While undertaking such a comparative study among V.
fischeri strains, we detected a high incidence of suspected
genomic anomalies in the published sequence of V.
fischeri ES114. We resequenced these suspect regions and
identified 91% of these loci to be in error. Notably, in
fourteen of the cases we detected misincorporation of
extraneous sequence in the published assembly, leading
to the appearance of duplicated DNA where none existed.
In five other cases, the sequence in the suspect region was
correct in the published sequence and the resulting gene
product would be predicted to be nonfunctional; we
therefore designated these features as pseudogenes in
ES114. In addition to correcting these features, we completed a full genomic update of ES114 gene annotations,

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:138

and incorporated the addition of 113 genes that were previously unannotated into release 2.0 of the ES114 annotation. Together these updates advance V. fischeri as a
platform for functional and comparative genomic studies,
and demonstrate how a targeted set of approaches may
yield high impact on genomic quality improvement.

Results
Identification of suspect genomic regions
We obtained the draft genome sequence of V. fischeri
strain MJ11 and, as part of our initial analysis, we conducted a number of reciprocal BLAST analyses to compare
its predicted proteome with that of the completely
sequenced conspecific strain ES114 [16]. We used BLASTP
[24] to identify orthologs between the two strains, using a
modified reciprocal best-hit approach as outlined in the
Methods. A surprising outcome from this analysis was the
occurrence of over seventy protein-coding genes in MJ11
with reciprocal best-hits to two neighboring genes in
ES114. At the time that we were performing this analysis,
a handful of cases were being identified empirically in
which neighboring genes in ES114 were actually one
gene, and that the appearance of two genes resulted from
frameshift or nonsense errors in the original sequence
data. Examples that were identified independent of this
work include ptsI [25], fnr (J.L. Bose and E.V.S., unpublished data), and acs (S.V. Studer & E.G.R., unpublished
data).

Analysis of the suspect regions supported the hypothesis
that there were a large number of loci in ES114 in which
sequencing errors had led to the miscalling of one gene as
multiple ORFs. In support of this hypothesis, we identified a number of genes that are essential in Escherichia coli
and other bacteria, but that were split in version 1.0 of the
ES114 sequence. These included dnaG, ftsQ, mukB, nusG,
rplC, rplN, rplO, rpoB, rpoC, thrS, and tilS [26,27], and the
conditionally-essential rpoH [28]. Second, we identified
eleven ambiguous bases (i.e., "N" listed in the nucleotide
sequence) that had been called in the original sequence,
and the incidence of these bases correlated with the presence of suspect ORFs.
In addition to suspected frameshifts and substitutions, we
also identified fourteen regions in which it appeared that
extraneous sequence had been incorporated that was
highly similar to neighboring sequence, with the size of
the duplicated/extraneous region ranging from 318 bp to
1264 bp. In one case, pre-genomic sequencing of a suspect
region did not identify any repeated sequence [29]. Therefore, we hypothesized that these regions represented
assembly errors in which the same stretch of DNA was
mistakenly incorporated twice into the genome's
sequence. These regions typically contained a few unique
base pairs at either end – likely due to low-coverage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/138

sequencing – that led to the misincorporation, but were
otherwise essentially a direct repeat of DNA that had the
effect of introducing extra and/or truncated ORFs.
A list of the loci targeted for resequencing was assembled
and each was assigned a "target number"; that number is
used consistently in tables and figures so that the primer
sequences used to analyze the data may be correlated with
the resulting sequence and analysis.
In addition to the BLASTP-based identification of potential errors, we undertook a full-length visual comparison
of the chromosomes of V. fischeri ES114 and MJ11. Given
the prevalence of errors detected by identifying adjacent
ORFs that likely represented a single ORF, we hypothesized that there were probably other cases of errors that
would not have manifest themselves in this way. Examples of other suspected errors that warranted investigation
included situations in which one of the fragmented ORFs
was too small to be detected as an ortholog candidate by
the BLASTP filters, or in which the second fragment did
not lead to a predicted open reading frame. Using the program Mauve [30], we analyzed ORFs along the length of
the chromosomes, identifying candidates that had suspect
5' or 3' ends. In some cases, these appeared to result solely
from annotation differences, in which identical sequences
had predicted translational start sites (5' boundaries) that
were called at distinct points in the two annotations. In
other cases, sequence differences underlay the unique
ORF boundaries, and we targeted those for our analysis.
Furthermore, there were three cases in which putative
extraneous sequence was visually identified in intergenic
sequence, which could not have been detected by BLASTP
analysis in the absence of annotated ORFs (target nos.
130, 172, 178). These cases were added to the list of targeted loci. Finally, any remaining ambiguous bases in the
sequence were targeted for resequencing.
Sequence clarification
We examined a total of 82 targets for resequencing. Our
general approach involved amplifying across the target,
and then sequencing the amplified product with the PCR
primers. In cases where we were clarifying the sequence
following a large detected "deletion" (missing sequence
from what is predicted from the published sequence), we
amplified a larger product and sequenced from a set of
sequencing primers across both strands. For the oligonucleotide primers used for PCR and sequencing see Additional file 1. With one exception, all of the primer pairs
amplified products in which there was a clear, predominant band, and thus served as satisfactory templates for
sequencing. The primer pair that failed to amplify (target
no. 180) included a primer that was in a region that does
not exist in the true ES114 sequence, as clarified by our
analysis of target no. 182. Therefore the absence of a band

in this case supports the deletion that emerged from target
no. 182.

protein's C-terminus, and correction of the frameshift led
to inclusion of the entire domain.

Seventy-five of the 82 sets (91%) of resequencing targets
examined were found to be in error in the published
ES114 sequence. The errors, subsequent changes, new
locus tags, and new annotations, are listed in Table 1.
Conceptual diagrams of representative sequencing and
other annotation changes discussed during this report are
illustrated in Figure 1. Note that with this update, the
locus tag format has been modified to the new NCBI format for locus tags (underscore following the "VF" prefix,
which denotes V. fischeri ES114). As a convention, in cases
of gene fusion, the locus tag of the 5'-proximal (N-terminal-encoding) fragment retained its locus tag identifier,
while the identifier(s) for the remaining gene fragment(s)
were deaccessioned.

Pseudogenes and degeneration in umuC
In some of the cases we confirmed the published ES114
sequence to be correct, and that the ORF boundaries (5' or
3' end, or the presence of two genes instead of one) were
correct in ES114 version 1.0. Table 2 lists those five cases
that we can now more confidently assume to be pseudogenes in ES114 because they appear to be nonfunctional
given their predicted amino acid sequence. In each case,
the indicated defect is predicted to interrupt a significant
portion of the coding sequence required for function in
well-characterized homologs. The N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase VF_A0466 has two (apparently functional)
paralogs in the genome, and ES114 is capable of utilizing
N-acetylglucosamine as a sole N+C source (data not
shown): therefore, the appearance of a pseudogene at this
location does not have obvious functional consequences
for the cell.

It is thought that the creation of false large-scale genomic
rearrangements such as insertions rarely occurs in microbial genome projects [3,11]; however, we confirmed the
presence of all fourteen predicted insertions by amplifying
from the respective unique flanking regions, and demonstrating that the bands obtained are inconsistent with the
previous sequence model (Figure 2). In each case, the
bands observed were smaller than predicted, and the
sequence obtained led to the precise deletion of the extraneous repeated DNA in the new model.
Most of the resulting changes led to the fusion of two – or
in some cases three – neighboring ORFs, and/or the extension of ORFs at the 5' or 3' end (Figure 1A–C; Table 1). In
one case (target no. 178), the deletion affected only an
intergenic region that contains no annotated features. In
another case (target no. 172) the deletion identified by
visual analysis in Mauve affected what was believed to be
a 1498-bp intergenic region between rluE and VF_1777.
The corrected sequence revealed this region to be only 368
bp in length, but also that it contains a predicted lipoprotein conserved in V. fischeri MJ11. The new release reflects
the sequence deletion, as well as the added annotation for
this gene (VF_2633).
The resulting sequence corrections led us to propose a
number of protein annotations that were consistent with
our predictions. Based on the corrected sequence, many
conserved genes now more closely resemble their
orthologs in other species. In other cases, the domain
structure of even poorly characterized proteins supported
the accuracy of the corrections. For example, target no.
185 extended the 3' end of VF_1515 by correcting a
frameshift mutation. Analysis of protein domains by conserved domain search (CDD; [31]) identified an incomplete GGDEF (diguanylate cyclase) domain in the

There is little information about the remaining four pseudogenes, except for umuC. The transcriptional organization between the genes encoding the DNA polymerase V
subunits umuD and umuC is conserved between ES114
and MJ11 (Additional file 5). However, umuC has
uniquely degenerated in ES114, with both a nonsense
codon and a 5-bp repeat expansion following the nonsense codon. DNA polymerase V is responsible for errorprone translesion synthesis (e.g., following UV-irradiation), which allows DNA synthesis to proceed despite a
high rate of error incorporation [32], yet there are organisms, including V. cholerae El Tor, that apparently do not
encode these functions [33,34]. Whether the situation in
ES114 represents an evolutionary transition state, or
instead this arrangement (umuD+umuC-) has relevant
functional implications remains to be determined.
Annotation of previously uncalled protein-coding genes,
regulatory RNAs, and operon leader peptides
Because examination of the intergenic region corrected by
target no. 172 revealed a likely protein-coding gene, we
asked whether there were other genes present within the
ES114 sequence that were previously unannotated. Additionally, regulatory RNA genes had not been previously
annotated in the V. fischeri genome, yet they are known to
play important roles in V. fischeri and other diverse bacteria [35,36]. Therefore, we undertook an effort to systematically identify ORFs and regulatory RNA genes that had
not been called in the published version 1.0 sequence.

To accomplish this search we took advantage of the annotations present in the J. Craig Venter Institute's Comprehensive Microbial Resource (JCVI CMR), which include ab
initio gene-calls that can differ from those in the deposited

GenBank flatfiles [37]. We examined the list of approximately 150 novel genes identified in the CMR. We
excluded candidates that were unlikely to be biologically
significant – generally, short ORFs that were encoded on
the opposite strand against much larger ORFs – and were

left with 53 likely novel ORFs (Additional file 4, Basis
code "A"). We also took advantage of the presence of the
closely-related MJ11 strain as a source for novel gene
annotations. Of the MJ11 proteins that did not have an
ortholog in ES114, we examined those in which a

Evidence of expansions at multiple chromosomal sites
Evidence of expansions at multiple chromosomal sites. The fourteen resequencing targets examined had extraneous
sequence in the published version. In each case, correction of the error required large deletions (over 300 bp). For each of the
targets examined, the closed arrowhead indicates the band observed upon amplification with the PCR primers listed, whereas
the open arrowhead indicates the size of the product expected by the sequence in the published version 1.0. Marker sizes are
indicated in kb.
TBLASTN query of MJ11 proteins against the ES114
genome yielded a percent amino acid identity value of at
least 85%. We excluded candidates in which there was low
biological basis for the assignment (as described above),
or in which the open reading frame was not conserved in
ES114. There were 72 novel ES114 ORFs assigned by comparison with MJ11 (Additional file 4, Basis "B"). 30 ORFs
were called by both methods (CMR and MJ11 conservation), whereas 65 genes were called by only one method,
for a total of 95 uncalled chromosomal protein-coding

genes that we predict to be uncalled in ES114 (Table 3,
Additional file 4).
In all of these cases, no sequence was changed in the
genomic model, but annotations imposed on the
sequence were added. Included in the list of new genes
predicted from both approaches is biotin synthase (bioB).
Because ES114 grows on minimal medium lacking biotin
[38], BioB is likely expressed by the organism. Another
example of a gene predicted from both approaches is the

oxaloacetate decarboxylase gamma subunit (oadC), which
is predicted to be encoded in an operon with the alreadypredicted alpha and beta subunits (new operon prediction of oadCAB).
In addition to genes that were identified from both the
MJ11-comparative and JCVI CMR approaches, we believe
that genes identified by only one of the approaches are
still worthy of inclusion, subject to the filters imposed
above. Genes that were identified by comparison with
MJ11 have the support that the open reading frame is conserved in at least these two strains. A similar measure has
been used to call genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for
genome inclusion [39]. Genes that were identified solely
from the JCVI CMR annotation include a number of
regions that are unique to ES114, such as a prophage that
is present in ES114 and absent in MJ11 (Additional file 4,
new loci VF_2640 through VF_2649), and therefore
would not be expected to be called by comparison with
MJ11. The coding density of the prophage was markedly
increased due to the addition of the novel gene annotations, consistent with phage genome organization and
supporting the assignments predicted by the CMR. It is
clear that the consolidated results from both methods,
though partially overlapping, identify a significant
number of novel, bona fide gene annotations in ES114.
We added regulatory RNA genes to the annotation as
identified from multiple sources (Table 3, Additional file
4). Prediction of CsrB regulatory RNAs has been pioneered using V. fischeri [36], and additional regulatory
RNAs were added based on motifs found in the RFAM
database [40]. These methods identified a total of 10 regulatory RNAs and 1 operon leader peptide. Although
operon leader peptide predictions are not typically found
in databases, we speculated that additional such genes
were present in ES114 and, using the Ecocyc database [41]
as a guide, we manually searched for operon leader peptides in ES114 and identified five additional high-confidence members in the genome (Additional file 4, Basis
"E").

In total, we called 95 new protein-coding genes, 8 regulatory RNAs, and 6 operon leader peptides, and we incorporated 2 protein-coding genes and 2 regulatory RNAs that
were published previously, for a total of 113 new annotations incorporated into ES114 version 2.0 (Table 3, Additional file 4).
Comprehensive annotation update
In the process of correcting sequence errors and adding
missing annotations, we additionally took the opportunity to update the annotations of the genes in the ES114
genome and to establish a framework for future genomic
and genetic studies in V. fischeri. To update the product
annotations of V. fischeri, we assembled a database of V.
fischeri genetic and genomic analyses from the the
PubMed database [42]. Our initial curated V. fischeri list
included 545 unique gene-publication associations from
60 publications, encompassing 339 distinct genes represented in strain ES114. This list served as the core of the
reannotation effort, which further gave us the opportunity
to update a number of genes whose functions have been
discovered since the initial genome publication.

For all genes in ES114, we additionally compared protein
annotations from multiple sources: (1) Orthologous protein annotations in the recently reannotated Escherichia
coli K-12 MG1655 sequence, and updates made subsequent to sequence publication through the ASAP and Ecocyc databases [41,43]; (2) Orthologous protein
annotations in V. cholerae [34]; (3) the JCVI CMR [37];
and (4) UniprotKB [44]. These comparisons allowed us to
update the annotations and to make the annotations
more consistent with current practice and NCBI guidelines.
We found the annotations of E. coli – though most distant
phylogenetically – to be the most valuable empirically.
The timeliness of the update and the availability of
curated, referenced descriptions in the Ecocyc entries
allowed us to improve a number of entries that appeared
to lag behind the other data sources. As one example, we
point to the case of yihY (VF_0100, ortholog of E. coli
locus tag b3886). Previously annotated as encoding the

Page 9 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:138

ribonuclease BN [45], this annotation has been propagated through numerous sources, including most of the
Vibrionaceae genomes. A subsequent report identified the
E. coli rbn/elaC gene (locus tag b2268) as the gene that
encodes RNase BN, and the most recent genome annotation for b3886 has been updated as yihY, "predicted inner
membrane protein" [46]. We compared data from the
sources described above, as well as the literature
described, and captured this update by calling VF_0100 as
yihY with a product of "predicted inner membrane protein". In fact, V. fischeri, like most sequenced Vibrio spp.,
does not contain an rbn ortholog, and therefore having
any product labeled as "ribonuclease BN" would have
been misleading from the perspective of predicting
genome capabilities. We note that the old annotation persists in major databases [31,47-49] and in most of the
Vibrionaceae genomes available at the time of data submission. This example highlights the value and relevance of
the E. coli K-12 update to this and related annotation
projects, as well as our ability to capture the latest information about genes encoded in the ES114 genome.
Fine-scale annotation changes, such as those shown in
Figure 1F, are detailed both in that figure and in the Methods. We also wish to highlight the updated entry for prfB
(noted in Table 3), the peptide chain release factor RF-2.
The programmed frameshift in prfB is not called correctly
by machine-call algorithms, and this gene is improperly
entered in the GenBank flatfiles of all of the previously
submitted Vibrio spp. genomes.
With the blossoming number of sequencing projects, utilization of locus tags (e.g., VF_0001) as identifiers for
both genes and their products has become commonplace
as the increase in genomic characterization has outpaced
genetic and biochemical characterization of gene products. Nonetheless, biological analysis in a genomic context depends on understanding gene function, and proper
nomenclature has been adopted in a number of species to
facilitate meaningful communication about genes and
their products. In fact, we (and others) repeatedly refer to
genes by their identifiers and, without tracking in a database, this practice can lead to incorrect conclusions [50].
Therefore, whereas the previous ES114 version did not
contain 3–5 character "gene" identifiers, we added those
for approximately 1,995 genes in which the identity of the
gene could be identified or inferred from published work
in V. fischeri, or by orthologous genes in other organisms.
Due to the availability of well-curated database resources,
most of the names were derived from their orthologs in E.
coli MG1655 [41,43,51].
We demanded that unique gene identifiers be a minimum
of three lowercase letters (e.g., fnr), with an optional
uppercase letter (e.g., dnaA), and/or an optional numeral

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/138

(e.g., nagA2), for a maximum of five characters total. Such
numeric suffixes were assigned to distinguish among
members of paralogous families or genes of related function. For approximately half of the genes, no gene identifier could be assigned at this time.
V. fischeri transcription machinery
Because three RNA polymerase subunit genes were
affected by the resequencing (rpoB, rpoC, rpoH), we took a
genomic inventory of the corrected ES114 transcriptional
apparatus in a manner that was not possible prior to the
targeted resequencing. The subunits identified in the
genome are listed in Table 4 and include the core subunits
α, β, β', and ω. Classification of the eleven identified
sigma factors is described below and was performed by
the scheme outlined in Gruber & Gross [52].

Group 1 sigma factors include regions 1.1, 1.2, 2, 3, and
4. This category includes only σ70 in ES114. Group 2
sigma factors (regions 1.2, 2, 3, 4) include the closelyrelated σS subunits; as mentioned above, V. fischeri curiously contains two of these sigma subunits. In addition to
a clear ortholog of rpoS (VF_2067), the gene encoding the
stationary-phase sigma subunit (σS), ES114 also contains
a gene that is expected to encode a σS-like subunit
(VF_A1015). Transcript levels of this second σS-family
subunit increase upon C8-homoserine-lactone (AinSdependent) quorum-sensing [18], so we have called the
product σQ (encoded by rpoQ) to designate this as a quorum-responsive sigma factor and to distinguish it from the
σS paralog. Group 3 sigma factors (regions 2, 3, 4) include
the specialized sigma factors σH and σF. Group 4 sigma
factors (regions 2 and 4 only), also called ECF sigma factors because they perform an extra cytoplasmic function

in responding to envelope stresses, are the most divergent.
ES114 contains five of these subunits, with the corresponding genes named rpoE, rpoE2, rpoE3, rpoE4, and
rpoE5. Although these have not yet been studied in V.
fischeri, their genomic context suggest function in some
cases. Unlike the other Group 4 sigma factors, the product
of the gene called rpoE is a close homolog of E. coli σE
(79% identical, 91% similar) and is organized transcriptionally with regulatory genes homologous to its E. coli
counterparts (rseA, rseB, rseC). We assigned this subunit
σE, and this subunit may respond to outer membrane protein misfolding in a similar manner as in E. coli [53]. rpoE4
is predicted to be transcribed in an operon with chrR,
which likely encodes an anti-σE4 factor based on homology with the reactive oxygen-sensing σE/ChrR system of
Rhodobacter sphaeroides [54]. Additionally, the two genes
flanking rpoE5, though their functions are unknown,
share a similar phylogenetic distribution as rpoE5. Because
Group 4 sigma factors are typically cotranscribed with
cognate anti-sigma factors [52], evolutionary co-inheritance of this three-gene cassette supports a role for the surrounding genes in regulating the levels and activation of
σE5.

Discussion
We initiated this study to clarify the status of a number of
suspect ORFs in a completed genome sequence of an
organism that is of value for studies on bacterial communication and host interaction. Of the 4.3 Mbp of chromosomal DNA in the original, version 1.0 release, 0.2% of
the sequence was in error, mostly due to fourteen regions
(ranging from 318 bp to 1264 bp) in which unique DNA
was incorporated in tandem in the version 1.0 release. A
total of 174 individual sites were corrected – by insertion,
deletion (large or small), or substitution – leading to
changes in 137 protein-coding loci of the version 1.0
release (3.6% of total ORFs), and one newly-annotated
ORF. Salzberg and Yorke [55] describe "compressions"
that can occur in eukaryotic genome assemblies when
errors compress multiple, repeated sequences and exclude
intervening unique regions. The type of error that we have
detected is an "expansion" in that sequence is illegitimately repeated and the resulting region has been
expanded.
The initial shotgun sequencing and assembly for ES114
were conducted circa 2001. However, sequence quality
varies by project and center/investigator, and the problems encountered here are neither unique to (nor necessarily as prevalent among) older genomes. For example, as
we identified resequencing targets in ES114, we additionally targeted regions in the draft V. fischeri MJ11 sequence
as part of our ongoing effort to close an accurate MJ11
sequence. Of fifteen loci targeted for resequencing, nine
were found to contain point mutations that led to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/138

frameshifts (data not shown). These data will be incorporated into the complete MJ11 sequence. Additionally, a
systematic analysis to identify possible gene errors of the
type we describe here identified interrupted genes in other
complete genomes from Gram-negative γ-proteobacteria,
and in some of those cases the interrupted genes are
orthologs of essential genes in E. coli [8,26]. In cases
where essential genes may be predicted from related
organisms, we propose that measuring the proportion of
such genes that are interrupted could serve as a measure of
quality assessment for newly-assembled genomes. In the
case of V. fischeri ES114, identifying interrupted essential
genes was a significant clue that the sequence model
required refinement, and those genes represent 12 of the
74 (16%) loci corrected (Table 1). The comparative
approach that we describe was necessary to identify the
additional affected loci.
In addition to the E. coli and M. smegmatis resequencing/
reannotation projects discussed earlier, a comparativebased reannotation project has been reported in S. cerevisiae [39]. Our approaches and results are similar to the
yeast study in that both relied heavily on comparison with
a single additional genome as a basis for gene discovery
and clarification. In addition to a draft genomic sequence
of a closely-related sequence, we relied solely on publiclyavailable data to compile our annotations and complete
this update. Thus, the methods described here are generally applicable in any case in which there is updated GenBank data for closely-related organisms.
The timeliness of any genome update is necessarily transient, and therefore it is of community interest to optimize the data quality and usability of annotation systems.
To track future sequence and annotation changes in V.
fischeri, we have established a web site that will assist in
coordinating V. fischeri annotation resources and genome
projects into the future [56].
Because GenBank functions mainly as a deposition library
– and not as a dynamic annotation interface – development of such an interface would enhance the ability to
keep genome data current. If such a resource were to be
developed, annotations could be propagated in a manner
that can be intelligently curated by individual genome
owners, and could be managed through a user-friendly
interface. The development of Bioinformatics Resource
Centers (BRCs) (e.g., [57]) has advanced the annotation
pipelines for pathogenic microorganisms, but this system
is insulated from many of the investigators who work on
the vast majority of organisms represented in the database, and requires consistent deposition in GenBank for
there to be a "paper trail" that can be accessed by outside
investigators. Additionally, establishing a distinction
between human-pathogenic and human-non-pathogenic

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:138

organisms in genome annotation is artificial when the
organisms overlap phylogenetically and significant work
is underway to characterize similar (often the same) gene
products and pathways in related organisms. It would be
beneficial to the prokaryotic genome community to find
a way to integrate genomic data into a dynamic resource
without regard to the human-pathogenic phenotype of
the organism.

Conclusion
As DNA sequencing technology accelerates, it is critical to
ensure that high-fidelity sequence assemblies are
obtained, and that large-scale errors be readily detected.
By using publicly-available resources and the sequence
(even the draft genomic sequence) of a close relative,
errors that lead to miscalling of ORF boundaries in one
strain relative to that of another may be identified for
regions syntenous between the strains. Such analyses can
identify regions that were assembled incorrectly, or even
point mutations that were miscalled in one strain. This
analysis in V. fischeri ES114 identified over 10 kb of
sequence that required adjustment, including 14 regions
requiring deletion from the annotation, and overall errors
affecting 138 ORFs across 74 loci.
It is similarly important to maintain accurate and updated
annotations for genes in sequenced genomes. Although
some extensively-studied model organisms have systematic programs for their annotation, organisms with sparser
genomic resources – and often, fortunately for this purpose, fewer data generated from direct studies in that
organism – can benefit from a streamlined reannotation
pipeline using recently updated annotations from publicly-available databases. By applying such an approach,
we updated the complete annotation of V. fischeri ES114
and included regulatory RNAs and operon leader peptides, important regulatory features that are commonly
missed by automated gene calling. Although communitybased updates are desirable when they can be accomplished, our individual approach is generally applicable
across microbial genomics and demonstrates a straightforward way to achieve a high-yield update with resources
that are common in hundreds of laboratories.

Methods
Identification of suspect regions by reciprocal BLASTP
analysis
We compared the predicted proteomes from both ES114
chromosomes against the chromosomal contigs of MJ11.
Reciprocal exhaustive BLASTP [42] searches were performed with an expect cutoff of 10. Results were filtered to
demand that the query length and subject length each be
a minimum of 60% of their respective total lengths.
Among the remaining results for each query protein, besthits were scored by percent amino acid identity, and addi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/138

tional results were included for analysis if they scored at
least 70% of the maximum score for that query. ES114MJ11 protein pairs included on reciprocal lists were candidate orthologs, and for the <200 pairs in which there
was a duplicate of query or subject protein, manual
assignment of orthology was curated using the parameters
of percent amino acid identity, percent of each protein
aligned, and the local genomic context (synteny) of the
two proteins, which was possible to determine in most
cases even though MJ11 was in draft format. Curation of
this list resolved many of the duplicates satisfactorily; the
remaining duplicates are the subject of this study. We note
that the effect of this analysis is similar to that employed
by Perrodou et al. [8]. The plasmid proteins were dissimilar between the two genomes and in the absence of a
strong reference sequence were not analyzed extensively
for putative sequence errors.
Sequence clarification
V. fischeri strain ES114 (isolate MJM1100) was used for all
of the sequence analysis except as noted. This isolate is a
first-generation descendent of the ES114 which served as
the source of genomic DNA for the original ES114
sequencing project. We know of no phenotypic or molecular distinction between the two strains. Genomic DNA
was prepared using the MasterPure Complete DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI).

PCR amplification was conducted using Platinum Taq
DNA Polymerase High-Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Fifty-µl reactions contained: 250 ng ES114 genomic
DNA, 1× reaction buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2 mM
MgSO4, 0.25 µM of each primer, and 1 U DNA Polymerase. Thermal cycling was conducted in a PTC-200 thermal
cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA): 95°C for 2:00; then
30 cycles of 95°C for 0:30, 55°C for 0:30, 68°C for 0:30–
1:00 per kb amplified; then 68°C for 5:00. Most primer
pairs (full list in Additional file 1) amplified products in
the range of 500–1000 bp and, thus, we used an extension
time of approximately 0:30. Where the product was
greater than 1 kb, at least three independent PCR reactions
were combined for sequencing to minimize the effect of
PCR error.
Sequencing was performed at both the University of
Washington High-Throughput Genomics Unit (Seattle,
WA) and the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology
Center DNA Sequencing Facility (Madison, WI). Analysis
of the sequence of the regions surrounding each suspect
area revealed patterns of polymorphisms that were ES114specific – that is, outside of the region of suspected
sequencing error (which often locally resembled MJ11),
the remainder of the resequenced product was distinct
from MJ11, and identical to the published ES114
sequence. This observation supported the notion that

there were discrete errors in the previously-published
ES114 sequence, that we were able to isolate and correct
the problem sequence, and that the problems described
were isolated within clear margins of discrepancy. A
detailed inventory of the sequence changes to create
ES114 version 2.0 may be found in Additional file 2.
Addition, removal, and annotation of protein-coding genes
Principal sources of additional ES114 gene annotations
since the initial publication of the genome sequence
include description of the syp polysaccharide cluster [58],
the mif diguanylate cyclase genes [59], several two-component systems [19], and an inventory of predicted flagellar and chemotaxis genes [60]. In addition, Dunn et al.
[61] annotated two new genes on the ES114 plasmid
pES100 as VFB38.5 and VFB39.5; these locus tags were
adjusted for consistency with NCBI guidelines to
VF_B0056 and VF_B0057, respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/138

and alignments from multiple primary and secondary
sources. Because experimental validation of most prokaryotic noncoding RNAs has occurred in E. coli K-12, we
relied on that organism's sequences to predict regulatory
RNA gene boundaries in V. fischeri. For this update we did
not include riboswitches and other cis-regulatory elements, except those that are transcribed as separate genes
(see next section).
Annotation of operon leader peptides
The histidine leader-peptide gene hisL was predicted
based on the annotated feature in RFAM; others were
found by sequence gazing, guided by known operon
leader peptides in E. coli K-12, as annotated in the Ecocyc
database [41]. Peptides with appropriate amino acid density (or thymine density, in the case of pyrL) in regions
comparable to their homologs in E. coli, were annotated
as operon leader peptides.

In this study, novel genes were added from a subset of the
genes listed in the ES114-specific dataset at the JCVI CMR
[37] as described in the text. Genes in MJ11 that had
unannotated orthologs in ES114 were identified by selecting MJ11 genes that failed to identify an ortholog as
described above, and performing TBLASTN [24] queries
against the ES114 genome. High-scoring results (>85%
amino acid identity) in which the open reading frame was
conserved between the two strains were designated as
novel genes in ES114.

Sequence information and versioning
The updated NCBI Genomes database files for V. fischeri
ES114 are [GenBank:CP000020, GenBank:CP000021,
GenBank:CP000022]. The files were accepted by NCBI on
10/03/2007 (GenBank x.2 version of each), and references to data sources are accurate as of that date. We have
assigned those files as release version 2.0. The individual
resequenced fragments were deposited in the NCBI GSS
database, under the accession numbers listed in Additional file 3.

Annotation updates to chromosomal protein-coding
genes were curated from the JCVI CMR and from UniprotKB. We also considered gene and protein annotations
from orthologs in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 (GenBank
accession no. U00096.2) [51] – including updates made
subsequent to sequence publication through the ASAP
[43] and Ecocyc [41] databases – and orthologous protein
annotations in V. cholerae N16961 (GenBank accession
nos. AE003852.1, AE003853.1) [34].

The V. fischeri MJ11 draft genome package has been
deposited as [GenBank:NZ_ABIH00000000]. Updated
assembly and correction information is available at the V.
fischeri Genomics Site [56].

Fine-scale annotation changes included refinement of
gene boundaries in 16S rRNA genes as shown in Figure 1F.
Eleven small coding sequences (VF0334, VF0335,
VF0567, VF2127, VF2160, VF2429, VF2430, VF2431,
VF2530, VF2531, VF2532) that overlapped 23S rRNA
genes were deaccessioned because they were unlikely to
represent true ORFs. Other genes that were deaccessioned
are listed where appropriate in the corresponding tables.
Addition and annotation of genes encoding RNAs
The csrB1 and csrB2 RNA gene annotations were designated by Kulkarni et al. [36], and the qrr1 annotation was
identified by homology with the gene described in Lenz et
al. [62]. Additional regulatory RNA genes were identified
using the RFAM database, with subsequent information
