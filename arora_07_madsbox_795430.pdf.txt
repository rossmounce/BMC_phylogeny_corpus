Abstract
Background: MADS-box transcription factors, besides being involved in floral organ specification, have also been
implicated in several aspects of plant growth and development. In recent years, there have been reports on
genomic localization, protein motif structure, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and expression of the
entire MADS-box family in the model plant system, Arabidopsis. Though there have been some studies in rice as
well, an analysis of the complete MADS-box family along with a comprehensive expression profiling was still
awaited after the completion of rice genome sequencing. Furthermore, owing to the role of MADS-box family in
flower development, an analysis involving structure, expression and functional aspects of MADS-box genes in rice
and Arabidopsis was required to understand the role of this gene family in reproductive development.
Results: A genome-wide molecular characterization and microarray-based expression profiling of the genes
encoding MADS-box transcription factor family in rice is presented. Using a thorough annotation exercise, 75
MADS-box genes have been identified in rice and categorized into MIKCc, MIKC*, Mα, Mβ and Mγ groups based
on phylogeny. Chromosomal localization of these genes reveals that 16 MADS-box genes, mostly MIKCc-type,
are located within the duplicated segments of the rice genome, whereas most of the M-type genes, 20 in all, seem
to have resulted from tandem duplications. Nine members belonging to the Mβ group, which was considered
absent in monocots, have also been identified. The expression profiles of all the MADS-box genes have been
analyzed under 11 temporal stages of panicle and seed development, three abiotic stress conditions, along with
three stages of vegetative development. Transcripts for 31 genes accumulate preferentially in the reproductive
phase, of which, 12 genes are specifically expressed in seeds, and six genes show expression specific to panicle
development. Differential expression of seven genes under stress conditions is also evident. An attempt has been
made to gain insight into plausible functions of rice MADS-box genes by collating the expression data of
functionally validated genes in rice and Arabidopsis.
Conclusion: Only a limited number of MADS genes have been functionally validated in rice. A comprehensive
annotation and transcriptome profiling undertaken in this investigation adds to our understanding of the
involvement of MADS-box family genes during reproductive development and stress in rice and also provides the
basis for selection of candidate genes for functional validation studies.

Background
The MADS-box family members, identified initially as floral homeotic genes, are one of the most extensively studied transcription factor genes in plants [1-8]. The word
MADS finds its origin from the first letters of its founding
members, Mini Chromosome Maintenance 1 (MCM1) of
yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [9], Agamous (AG) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) [10], Deficiens (DEF) of
snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) [11] and Serum Response
Factor (SRF) of humans (Homo sapiens) [12]. MADS-box
transcription factors are characterized by the presence of
an approximately 60 amino acids DNA binding domain,
known as the MADS-box domain, located in the N-terminal region of the protein. The plant-specific MIKC-type
MADS-box proteins include three additional domains followed by the MADS domain, viz. a less-conserved Intervening region of ~30 amino acids, a moderately conserved
Keratin-like domain of ~70 amino acids mainly involved
in heterodimerization, and a highly variable C-terminal
region of variable length implicated in transcriptional
activation and higher-order complex formation [13-15].
The MADS-box family has been divided into two main
groups. The type I consists of ARG80/SRF-like genes of
animals and fungi, also designated as M-type genes in
plants, and type II contains MEF2-like genes of animals
and yeast as well as MIKC-type genes of plants. It is proposed that an ancestral duplication before the divergence
of plants and animals gave rise to these groups [16]. The
MIKC-type genes are also characterized by the presence of
K domain that could have evolved after the divergence of
these lineages. The type II genes have been categorized
into MIKCc- and MIKC*-type based on structural features
[17,18]. The MIKCc genes have been further classified into
14 clades based on phylogeny [19,20]. Type I genes have
also been categorized into M- and N-type based on the
protein motifs identified using the MEME search tool [21]
and also as Mα, Mβ, Mγ and Mδ, based on the phylogenetic relationships between MADS-box regions [6]. The
Mδ group, however, corresponds to the MIKC* class
described in this report and elsewhere [22].
The most striking feature of the MADS-box gene family is
the diverse functions taken up by its members in different
aspects of plant growth and development. These include
flowering time control, meristem identity, floral organ
identity, formation of dehiscence zone, fruit ripening,
embryo development as well as development of vegetative
organs such as root and leaf [23-27]. Genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of MADS-box genes
have revealed 107 and 71 (only 65 of these are listed in
The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Rice Pseudomolecule release 4 database) genes in Arabidopsis and rice,
respectively [6,28].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/242

Though a large amount of expression data based on SAGE,
microarrays and other high-throughput transcriptome
analysis techniques is available in public databases, the
studies involving expression of the entire MADS-box family have so far been restricted to northern blot analysis or
reverse transcriptase PCR at limited stages of development
[6]. Recently, the comparison of expression profiles resulting from a 22 k rice cDNA microarray-based transcriptome analysis of early panicle development in rice was
used to implicate three MADS-box genes, OsMADS1, 14
and 15, in panicle branching [29]. The use of highthroughput genome-wide transcriptome analysis provides
an insight into changes in the entire transcriptome across
a variety of biological conditions. In combination with
the whole genome sequence data and comparative expression analysis with genes of known functions, the transcriptomic data can become an initiation point for
systematic investigations into structure-function relationships.
With an overall objective to understand regulation of
reproductive organ development in indica rice, we have
initiated a program on microarray-based expression profiling of transcription factors and signal transduction
components. Here, we report a comprehensive account of
identification and phylogenetic analysis of 75 members of
MADS-box gene family in rice and their expression profiling during 11 stages of panicle and seed development
along with three abiotic stress conditions and 3 stages of
vegetative development. This analysis is based on TIGR
Rice Pseudomolecule release 4 and KOME (Knowledgebased Oryza Molecular biological Encyclopedia) rice fulllength cDNA database. We have identified 10 new members belonging to this gene family besides confirming 65
previously identified genes. Out of 71 previously identified genes by Nam and coworkers [28], six were not found
in version 4 of TIGR. Our analysis also suggests the existence of Mβ-type genes in rice, which was earlier thought
to be absent in monocots [6]. The results of expression
profiling have been discussed in light of phylogenetic
relatedness of the genes and their known functions in rice
as well as other systems.

Results
Identification, organization and structure of MADS-box
genes
HMM analysis and name search resulted in the identification of 75 MADS-box genes in rice genome. Since, gene
names from OsMADS1 to OsMADS58 representing 34
genes already existed in the literature (though not in continuation), newly identified genes were named from
OsMADS59 to OsMADS99 (see Table 1). The individual
genes were localized on chromosomes based on the 5' and
3' coordinates for respective gene models in TIGR database (Figure 1). The maximum number of genes (16;

21%) were found to be localized on chromosome 1,
whereas, chromosomes 10 and 11 had only one MADSbox gene each. Out of five types of MADS-box genes, the
Mγ genes were confined to chromosome 1, 3 and 4, while
Mβ genes were present only on chromosome 1. No chromosomal bias was observed in the distribution of MIKCc,
MIKC* and Mα genes (Figure 1). Analysis of the TIGR rice
segmental duplication database revealed 30 MADS-box
genes within the duplicated segments of rice chromosomes. Only 16 genes, however, were found to have their
counterparts on duplicated segments (Figure 1). Most of
the duplicated genes belonged to the MIKCc group. Several MADS-box genes, especially M-type, were also found
juxtaposed on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12. Twenty
such genes showed significant sequence identity.
Similar to that reported in Arabidopsis, distribution of
introns in rice MADS-box family genes was also found
bimodal with MIKCc and MIKC* genes containing multiple introns and the Mα, Mβ and Mγ genes usually having
no or occasionally up to 4 introns (see Table 1; [6]). The
length of MADS-box proteins varied from 150 to 300
amino acids, with few exceptionally longer or smaller proteins (Table 1). For details on other parameters of nucleic
acid and protein sequences, refer to Table 1.

To examine the evolutionary relationships of MADS-box
genes in rice (including the 10 new genes identified in this
study) and Arabidopsis, a tree was constructed using only
the conserved MADS-box domain. Five groups, as
described by Parenicova and coworkers [6] were identified
containing representative genes of both rice and Arabidop-

sis. All the Arabidopsis proteins were found to lie in groups
similar to those identified previously [6], except AGL47
and AGL82, which instead of forming a basal branch of
the Mβ, grouped with Mγ proteins in our analysis as
shown in supplementary figure S1 [see Additional file 1].
OsMADS64 grouped separately with AGL33 of Arabidopsis, which does not cluster with any of the MADS groups
described above [see Additional file 1].
A separate phylogenetic tree was also generated from complete protein sequences of all the MADS-box genes in rice
and Arabidopsis (Figure 2). Of the 75 rice MADS-box
genes, 38 grouped with MIKCc, six with MIKC*, nine with
Mβ, 13 with Mα and 10 grouped with Mγ-type Arabidopsis
genes. In case of M-type genes, barring OsMADS90, 91
and 96, all other genes exhibited similar groupings as in
the MADS-domain-specific phylogenetic analysis (Figure
2). MIKCc proteins were further divided into 14 clades.
Representatives of both rice and Arabidopsis could be identified in all the clades except OsMADS32 and the FLC
clade, which are exclusive to rice and Arabidopsis, respectively (Figure 2). Phylogenetic trees with bootstrap values,
for complete protein sequences as well as coding
sequences of rice and Arabidopsis MADS-box genes have
been shown as supplementary figures S2 and S3, respectively [see Additional files 2 and 3].
Distribution of conserved motifs
The MEME motif search tool was employed to identify the
conserved motifs present in MADS-box proteins (Figure
3). Motifs 1, 6 or 2 specifying the MADS domain were
found in all the members of the MADS-box family. All
proteins belonging to MIKCc and MIKC* groups had
motif 1-type MADS domain. Most Mα proteins also had

Chromosomal location of rice MADS-box genes
Chromosomal location of rice MADS-box genes. 75 MADS-box genes have been mapped on rice chromosomes according to 5' and 3' coordinates mentioned in TIGR. Respective chromosome numbers are written at the top. Genes belonging to
five groups have been marked by different colors (MIKCc, red; MIKC*, yellow; Mα, purple; Mβ, green and Mγ, blue). Genes
lying on duplicated segments of genome have been joined by dashed lines. Tandemly duplicated genes are joined with vertical
lines. (* The duplicated segment between chromosome 1 and 9 containing OsMADS65 and 8, respectively, could be detected
only in segmental duplication database with 500 kb and not with 100 kb distance allowed between collinear genes in TIGR, for
details see experimental procedures).

the motif 1-type MADS domain except OsMADS72 and
77 which contained motif 6. Motif 6 was found to be the
most common type of MADS domain in Mβ-type proteins. Distinctively, in case of Mγ proteins a larger MADS
domain of 83 amino acids was detected, followed by a
coiled coil region and a region of unknown complexity as
indicated by Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool
(SMART) version 3.4. Together these components formed

a larger conserved region of 200 amino acids denoted as
motif 2. The conserved motifs 4, 3 and 7, specifying K
domain, were found mainly in the MIKCc group members. Of the 38 MIKCc proteins, 31 had all three conserved
regions, whereas, motif 7 was absent in case of
OsMADS23 and 57; motif 4 in OsMADS22 and 55; and
the complete K domain was missing in OsMADS67, 59
and 66. The partial K domain was also detected in some

of the non-MIKCc proteins including OsMADS89 and 86
of Mγ, OsMADS68 and 62 of MIKC*, OsMADS63 and
OsMADS69 of Mα group.
Certain unknown motifs, numbered 5, 11, 15, 16, 17 and
20, besides the MADS (motif 1) and the K (motifs 3, 4,
and 7) domains in MIKCc proteins, were also revealed by
MEME motif search. Motif 5 corresponded to the intervening region between the MADS and the K domains,
whereas, the rest were found to be distributed in the C-terminal regions. The MADS domain in five M-type proteins,
OsMADS88, 99, 96, 93 and 72, was found to be preceded
by an N-terminal domain (motif 9). In Mβ proteins, the
MADS domain was represented by motif 6 except in
OsMADS98 and 92. In addition, other motifs, viz. 5, 8,
10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19 and 20 were also detected, of which
motifs 8, 10, 12, 14 and 19 were exclusive to the Mβ class
of proteins. The sequences and lengths of all the motifs
are given in supplementary table S1 [see Additional file 4].
Expression profiling of MADS-box genes during vegetative
and reproductive development and stress
For expression analysis, the rice panicle and seed development stages were divided into 6 and 5 broad categories,
respectively, based on landmark developmental events as
described by Itoh and coworkers [30]; information available at oryzabase [31] and our preliminary histochemical
analysis (data not shown; Table 2). Seedlings subjected to
three stress conditions, viz. desiccation, cold and salt
stress, were also included in this analysis. Transcriptome
profiling of these stages along with mature leaf, root and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/242

7-day-old seedlings was carried out by using GeneChip®
Rice Genome Arrays. The raw data from 51 chips representing three biological replicates each from 17 samples
was normalized by Gene Chip Robust Multiarray Analysis
(GCRMA) algorithm [32]. Since five tandemly duplicated
Mγ genes OsMADS81, 82, 83, 85 and 99 showed very high
sequence identity (94.6 to 98.6%), the unique probe sets
for these genes were not available on the GeneChip®.
Therefore, a cumulative expression profile for these genes
is presented (Figure 4). Expression profiles for OsMADS78
and 79, which were also not represented on the chip, were
studied using QPCR (quantitative real-time PCR, Figure
4). The primers used in this study are listed in supplementary table S2 [see Additional file 5]. The initial analysis
revealed all but one (OsMADS80) gene to be expressing in
at least one of the experimental stages analyzed (Figure 4).
Based on expression profiles during panicle, seed and vegetative development, MADS-box genes were classified
into eight groups. Figure 5 shows mean expression profiles for each of the groups. Group I consisted of 12 genes
(OsMADS2, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22, 30, 56, 60, 64, 65 and 77)
most of which showed high transcript accumulation in all
the stages analyzed. However, eight genes (OsMADS1, 4.
5, 6, 7, 8, 17 and 58) of group II showed high expression
preferentially in panicle and seed with more than 100 to
500 folds expression in majority of the reproductive tissues in comparison to mature leaf. OsMADS7 and 8 were
the most highly expressed genes in panicle and seed stages
with more than 1000-fold transcript accumulation in S1
stage of seed development. Group III comprised of the
genes OsMADS20, 32, 34 and 72, which showed high
expression during early stages of panicle development.
The expression declined gradually as the panicles
matured. In contrast, the expression of group IV genes
(OsMADS3 and 13) increased with the development of
the panicles and continued to increase during stages of
seed development; the highest expression being 10 and
100 folds for OsMADS3 and 13, respectively. Five genes,
OsMADS21, 29, 71, 78 and 79 (group V), expressed preferentially during seed development. The expression of
OsMADS21 and 29 was more than 100 folds in S1-S3
stages, whereas, the expression of OsMADS71 increased
up to 15 folds in S3 to S5 stages. OsMADS78 and 79 transcripts showed S3-S4 stage-specific accumulation (Figure
4). Group VI comprised of five genes, OsMADS26, 27, 47,
55 and 57 that expressed predominantly in vegetative tissues. The maximum expression of OsMADS57 was
observed in mature leaves, whereas, OsMADS27 showed
higher expression in roots as well. Three genes
(OsMADS31, 63 and 66) that constituted Group VII
showed low levels of expression in most stages of panicle
and seed development. The peak expression for these
genes was observed either in P6 (OsMADS63), S1/S2
(OsMADS31) or S3 (OsMADS66) stages. The remaining

genes (mainly M-type) showed very low levels of expression and were clustered together as group VIII (Figure 4).
For normalized expression values and calculated fold

Eight genes showing discrete expression patterns were
selected for validation by QPCR analysis. Figure 6 shows
a comparison of the QPCR and microarray analysis. The
expression patterns obtained for all eight genes using
QPCR were similar to that derived from the microarrays.
Moreover, most of the characterized genes showed similar
expression patterns to that already described in the literature, which strengthens the reliability of the data obtained
by using microarrays [33]Expression levels of four MADSbox genes (OsMADS18, 22, 26 and 27) were up regulated
by more than two folds in response to cold and dehydration stress treatments (Figure 7). Three genes (OsMADS2,
30 and 55) showed more than 2-fold down regulation in
response to dehydration and salt stress. The fold change
values with respect to seedlings are given in supplementary table S5 [see Additional file 8]

Expression profiles of putative orthologs of Arabidopsis
MIKCc-type genes in rice
Comparative expression profiles of phylogenetically
related MIKCc class genes in rice and Arabidopsis is shown
in figure 8. These genes have been considered orthologs in
Arabidopsis and rice [34-36]. In GLO-like clade, the expression of PI and OsMADS4 was found to be restricted to
reproductive tissues, whereas, OsMADS2 showed significant expression in seedlings as well. The expression of
another B-class gene, AP3, was also found to be specific to
reproductive tissues in Arabidopsis; however its rice
ortholog, OsMADS16, also expressed in vegetative tissues
besides showing peak expression in reproductive tissues.
The expression of AG was found to be restricted to the
stages of floral development and initial stages of seed
development in Arabidopsis. In rice, its putative orthologs
OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 were found to have comparable expression profiles to that of AG, with OsMADS3
showing relatively low level transcript accumulation. In
AG clade, the expression profiles of an Arabidopsis D-class
gene, AGL11 and its rice counterpart OsMADS13 showing
53% identity at amino acid level were also comparable.
SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) and its putative
ortholog OsMADS50 in ricewere found to exhibit low
level ubiquitous expression in the stages analyzed. The
members of AGL2-like clade, OsMADS7/45 and
OsMADS8/24 are duplicated genes with high level of
sequence homology to AGL2/SEP2 and AGL14/SEP1,
respectively. These genes, along with OsMADS1, 5 and 34
were found to exhibit similar expression patterns as those
of SEP genes. In SQUA-like clade, AP1 gene of Arabidopsis
and its putative rice orthologs OsMADS14 (RAP1B),

15(RAP1A) and OsMADS18 show high sequence similarity. In reproductive tissues, the expression profiles of

that of AP1, but unlike AP1, the rice genes also expressed
in mature leaves.

In AGL6-like clade, duplicated genes, OsMADS6 and
OsMADS17, exhibit similar expression patterns as that of
AGL6. Both the genes show more than 50% identity with
AGL6 at amino acid level suggesting that these could be
putative orthologs of AGL6 in rice.

Expression profiles of duplicated genes
Analysis of the TIGR rice segmental duplication database
revealed 19 MADS-box genes that were localized on the
duplicated segments of the rice genome. A comparison of
expression profiles of the duplicated gene pairs, as
obtained from microarray data, revealed that except for 3
gene pairs, viz. OsMADS7:8, OsMADS3:58 and
OsMADS2:4; expression patterns of other duplicated
genes had diverged significantly (Figure 9).

Chromosome 1 was found to have four tandemly duplicated genes within a 12 kb region. Two groups of tandemly duplicated genes with three genes each were
localized on chromosome 4. Incidentally, this region
overlapped with an intra-chromosomal duplicated segment suggesting that these six genes probably evolved
from a single ancestral gene by a combination of segmental and tandem duplication events. All four tandemly
duplicated MIKCc-type genes showed varied expression
patterns. OsMADS13 and 33 as well as OsMADS14 and 34,
although fulfilling our selection criteria, were not considered as being tandemly duplicated because of the high
level of sequence divergence, which was evident from
their placement in different clades of MIKCc-type genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/242

orthologs; D class gene, OsMADS13 is putative ortholog
of AGL11; OsMADS7 and 8 are orthologous to
SEPALLATA2 and 1, respectively [40-48]. Most of the
putative orthologous genes in rice and Arabidopsis exhibit
similar expression patterns (Figure 8). It was, however,
observed that the rice counterparts had a general tendency
to express in vegetative organs as well, whereas, the
expression of Arabidopsis genes was restricted to reproductive tissues. From the expression data and per cent identity, it seems that duplicated genes, OsMADS6 and
OsMADS17 (AGL6-like clade) are orthologous to AGL6.
Further experimentation would be required to verify if
these genes have similar functions as well.
In addition to some of the well characterized genes
described above, there are several others, e.g. OsMADS34,
32, 20, 72, 63, 98, 89, 92 and 86, that show specific upregulation in panicles but have not yet been functionally
validated in rice. This list also includes MIKC*- and Mtype genes along with MIKCc genes. Most of the functionally validated MADS-box family genes belong to the
MIKCc class, while functions of most of the M-type genes
are not yet known in any system. Therefore, this study provides a solid base to select genes for functional validation.

Involvement of MADS-box genes in panicle and seed
development in rice
For over a decade, investigations leading to the understanding of genetic and molecular basis of floral development in model eudicots, Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, have
revealed involvement of a number of MADS-box genes in
specifying floral organ identity [37,38]. Attempts have
been made to predict the function of MADS-box genes in
diverse species based on sequence similarities [24,39].
However, identification of additional paralogs with very
similar sequences and existence of duplicated genes with
different expression patterns made it difficult to predict
the function based on sequence data alone. Similarity in
temporal and spatial expression patterns in combination
with the sequence comparisons, however, was found to be
a better criterion for establishing orthologous relationships. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive
expression profiling for all the MADS-box genes in rice
along with an account of their phylogenetic relationships
with the Arabidopsis genes.

In 2003, Parenicova and coworkers showed that 64 of the
109 Arabidopsis MADS-box genes expressed in siliques [6].
Later, by using high-density transcription factor filter
arrays, almost all the MADS-box genes were found to
express during silique development [49]. These results
suggested that besides being involved in the development
of flowers, the MADS-box gene family could be involved
in the process of seed development as well. In rice, we
have also found (with the exception of OsMADS80)that
transcripts for almost all the MADS-box genes are
expressed in at least one of the seed development stages
analyzed. Interestingly, the highest expression values for
OsMADS13, 21, 23, 29, 71, 75, 78 and 79 were observed
for seed stages, suggesting that these genes could be
involved in development of seeds. Four of these genes
belong to type II (MIKCc group), whereas, the remainder
are type I (Mα-type). Since, two of the type I (Mγ) genes,
AGL80 and PHERES, have previously been implicated in
seed development, it might be interesting to investigate
the role of other type-I genes showing up-regulation during development of seeds [50,51].

Of the 75 genes analyzed in this study, more than 20 were
found to exhibit either specific or preferential transcript
accumulation during stages of panicle and seed development. Some of these genes have already been characterized as orthologs of Arabidopsis ABCDE class genes,
viz.OsMADS14 and 15 are APETALA1 orthologs;
OsMADS2 and 4 are PISTILLATA orthologs; OsMADS16 is
an APETALA3 ortholog; OsMADS3 and 58 are AGAMOUS

Rice MIKCc genes
The MIKCc genes have been sub-grouped into 13 clades in
Arabidopsis. Representatives of all but the FLC clade were
also found in rice. Six genes belonging to the FLC clade
have been implicated in control of flowering by vernalization and autonomous pathways in Arabidopsis. Since rice
does not require vernalization for flowering, this clade has
been suggested to be lost in rice [19]. Recently, Zhao and

coworkers (2006) have reported a new monocot-specific
clade, OsMADS32-like clade, consisting of OsMADS32 of
rice and TaAGL14 and 15 of wheat [20]. The expression of
TaAGL14 and 15 was detected in most vegetative stages
along with inflorescence and seeds. In contrast, the
OsMADS32 transcripts were found to be restricted to early
stages of panicle and late seed development, suggesting
that the OsMADS32-like clade might have evolved to cater
for diverse monocot-specific functions. A comparison of
phylogenetic relationships and expression profiles
between rice and Arabidopsis MADS-box genes suggests
that although most of the basic ABCDE functions have
been retained in rice, acquisition of new functions and
subfunctionalization of existing gene functions is also
apparent.
Mβ-like genes are represented in rice
In earlier studies, no gene of rice could be assigned to the
Mβ group of M-type MADS-box genes, hence it was suggested that probably Mβ genes have not been retained in
the rice genome [6,28]. In this study, we have identified
nine new genes that grouped with Arabidopsis Mβ type
genes. Although bootstrap values are low, separation of
this clade from the rest of M-type genes of rice and the
presence of conserved motifs in Arabidopsis Mβ protein
and the newly identified group is suggestive of the existence of Mβ group in rice as well.
Duplication seems to have played major role in
diversification of MADS-box family of genes
Arabidopsis has been reported to have 107 MADS-box
genes [6]. However, in rice that has a genome size almost
three times as that of Arabidopsis [52,53], the number of
MADS-box genes was found to be only 75. The reason for
this could be the variable status of whole genome duplications in Arabidopsis and rice [54,55]. Surprisingly, however, the number of MIKCc-type genes in both Arabidopsis
and rice was found to be similar at 39 and 38, respectively.
Therefore, the difference in the total number is mainly
due to the variation in the number of M-type genes, which
are 37 in rice and 68 in Arabidopsis. It seems that duplication events have contributed significantly towards evolution of M-type genes. Our analysis revealed 16 M-type
genes, which could have originated because of tandem
duplications (Figure 1). Phylogenetic analysis suggests
that rice and Arabidopsis Mγ genes probably had a common ancestor and the expansion occurred independently
after divergence of monocots and dicots.

MADS-box genes seem to have evolved mainly through
gene duplication events followed by neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization or in some cases pseudogenization of the duplicated gene [56]. However, redundancy
being one of the fates of duplication is also common in
MADS-box family. We found 30 MADS-box genes lying

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/242

on segmental duplicated regions of rice chromosomes
while only 16 were found to have been retained, suggesting that considerable changes may have taken place following segmental duplication leading to loss of some of
the genes. Except one, all paralogous gene pairs belong to
MIKCc-type of MADS-box family. Expression data show
that most of these duplicated genes have divergent expression patterns that may be because they have undergone
neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization, though
sufficient experimentation is required to prove this
hypothesis. Interestingly, three genes, viz. OsMADS6, 17
and 56, lying on duplicated segments of chromosomes 2,
4 and 10, respectively, show collinearity in gene order. On
the other hand, OsMADS50 lying on chromosome 3
shows synteny with only one of these genes, i.e.
OsMADS17. They may all have resulted due to duplication
of a segment on chromosome 4, but thereafter, evolution
of these genes may have been quite independent resulting
in loss of micro-collinearity between the duplicated
regions.
Stress responsive MADS-box genes in rice
MADS-box genes have been shown to be affected by low
temperature stress in tomato [57] and by application of
hormones like cytokinins, gibberellins [58], ethylene [59]
and auxins [60] in other plants. Seven MADS-box genes
exhibited differential expression in response to cold, salt
and/or desiccation stress in rice. So far, none of these
genes has been implicated in stress response. Amongst
stress-induced genes, OsMADS18 is a member of AP1/
SQUA group that has been shown to express widely during development with its transcripts accumulating at high
levels specifically in meristematic tissues [61]. It has been
shown to interact with OsMADS6, 8/24, 7/45, and 47
[45,61] and in our analysis its expression pattern was
found to overlap with those of OsMADS6, 8 and 7 in
reproductive tissues and with OsMADS47 during vegetative development, suggesting that it might be interacting
with different partners during reproductive development
and stress. Recently, Tardif and coworkers showed that a
large number of genes involved in flower development are
associated with abiotic stress responses in wheat [62]. Our
preliminary analysis involving transcript profiling during
reproductive development and abiotic stress conditions
has also revealed approximately 400 genes that are up regulated during panicle/seed development and three stress
conditions, viz. cold, salt, and dehydration (unpublished
data). It would be, therefore, interesting to undertake specific investigations, which could establish the interactions
of biochemical pathways that are activated during reproductive development and stress response.

Conclusion
Contribution of MADS-box gene family in flower organ
specification is well documented in eudicots; however,

functions of many gene members of this class have not
been elucidated in rice. A comparison of phylogenetic
relationships and expression profiles between rice and
Arabidopsis MADS-box genes suggests that although most
of the basic ABCDE functions have been retained in rice,
acquisition of new functions and subfunctionalization of
existing gene functions is also not uncommon. Furthermore, the role of MADS-box transcription factors in seed
development and during stress response also needs to be
explored. The new information generated is expected to
help in selection of appropriate candidate genes for further functional characterization.

parameters. Separate phylogenetic trees were constructed
using complete protein sequence and coding sequences of
rice and Arabidopsis MADS-box genes. Bootstrap analysis
was performed using 1000 replicates. The trees thus
obtained were viewed using TREEVIEW software [75].
Sequence and duplication analysis
To identify the conserved motifs, MEME version 2.2 [76]
was employed using following parameters; number of
repetitions – any, maximum number of motifs – 20, optimum motif width set to ≥ 6 and ≤ 200. The motifs
obtained were annotated using SMART and NCBI-CD
search program.

Methods
Identification of genes, nomenclature and mapping on
chromosomes
Name Search and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) were
employed to identify the MADS-box genes from rice
genome. MADS-box sequences available for all land
plants were downloaded from SWISSPROT and TrEMBL
[63] and their HMM profile was generated using HMMER
2.1.1 software package [64,65]. This profile was used to
search the complete proteome of rice available in TIGR
[66] and KOME [67,68] databases using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; [69]) with filter off. Name
search using MADS, SRF, AGAMOUS and AP1 as keywords in these databases helped in identification of more
genes, which could not be identified using HMM profile
due to the presence of incomplete MADS-box. Redundant
sequences were removed by aligning the protein
sequences using ClustalX 1.83 [70] and checking their
genomic locus in TIGR. Motif scan was performed using
SMART [71,72] or National Center for Biotechnology
Information Conserved Domain Database (NCBI-CD;
[73]) searches with filter off. According to already available nomenclature, 34 MADS-box genes have been named
from OsMADS1 to 58. Thus, the newly identified genes
were named from OsMADS59 to 99. MADS-box genes
were mapped on chromosomes by identifying their chromosomal position given in the TIGR rice database. Information regarding ORF length, amino acids number,
molecular weight and isoelectric point of protein was
downloaded from TIGR release 4. For OsMADS3 and 20,
Gene Runner program version 3.04 was employed to find
molecular weight and PI of protein, as it was not available
in TIGR.
Phylogenetic analysis
To identify the number of groups formed by rice MADSbox genes in comparison to Arabidopsis, MADS-box
domain comprising of 60 amino acids, identified by
SMART from all the MADS-box sequences of Arabidopsis
and rice were aligned using ClustalX (version 1.83) program. An un-rooted neighbor-joining (NJ; [74]) phylogenetic tree was constructed in ClustalX with default

Further, MADS-box gene duplications were mapped on
segmental duplications database of TIGR with 100 kb as
well as 500 kb distance allowed between collinear genes
[66]. For finding tandemly duplicated candidates, genes
with intergenic distance not more than 20 kb and having
fair degree of overall homology between them were
selected. Identity among duplicated genes was calculated
using DNASTAR MegAlign 4.03 package.
Collection of plant material
Oryza sativa indica var. IR64 tillers spanning all stages of
panicle and seed development were collected from field
grown rice. Mature leaves were also harvested from same
plants. For all the stages, three biological replicates were
harvested from independent populations of plants. After
harvesting, panicle and seed samples were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -70°C. For stress treatment, rice
seeds were surface-sterilized with 0.1% HgCl2 and soaked
in RO (reverse osmosis) water overnight in dark. Next day,
the seeds were spread on a meshed float and grown hydroponically at 28 ± 1°C in culture room conditions. After 7
days of growth, the seedlings were transferred to 100 ml
beaker for treatment. For salt stress, sodium chloride was
used at final concentration of 200 mM for 3 hours. For
cold stress, seedlings were kept at 4°C for 3 hours. Desiccation stress was simulated by drying the plants on tissue
paper and spreading them on Whatmann 3 mm sheet for
3 hours. The seedlings with their roots kept in water, for 3
hours duration, were used as control.
Microarray experiments
Affymetrix GeneChip® Rice Genome Arrays representing
49,824 transcripts (48,564 of japonica and 1,260 of indica)
have been employed to study the transcriptome profiles of
MADS-box genes during reproductive organ development
and stress response in rice. Total RNA was isolated from
all the tissues, except seeds, using TRIzol method (Invitrogen Inc., USA; [77]). Due to high carbohydrate content,
RNA from seed samples was isolated using the method
described earlier [78]. After checking the quality on agarose formaldehyde or TAE gels, the RNA samples were

Page 17 of 21

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:242

quantified using nanodrop (ND-1000 Spectrophotometer). Five micrograms of RNA with 260:280 ratios of 1.9–
2.0 and 260:230 ratios more than 2.0 was used for cDNA
synthesis. Labeling and hybridizations were carried out
according to Affymetrix manual for one-cycle target labeling (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization was performed in GeneChip® Hybridization Oven 640 for 16
hours at 45°C and 60 rpm. GeneChips were washed and
stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin using the fluidics
protocol EukGE_WS2V5_450 in Affymetrix fluidic station
model 450. Finally, chips were scanned using the GeneChip® Scanner 3000.
Digital expression analysis
The expression data for Arabidopsis, using Affymetrix
GeneChip® ATH1 Genome Array, from stages comparable
to those used for rice was obtained from Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database at the NCBI under the series
accession numbers GSE5620, GSE5621, GSE5623,
GSE5624, GSE5629, GSE5630, GSE5631, GSE5632 and
GSE5634. Total of 55 CEL files representing 21 stages of
development as well as stress treatments were downloaded from [79] and analyzed by using avadis™ microarray data analysis software version 4.2 [80]. The data was
normalized using GCRMA followed by log transformation and average calculation. Heat Map was generated for
selected genes.
Microarray data analysis
CEL files generated in GeneChip Operating Software
(GCOS) were further analyzed using avadis™. Data were
normalized using GCRMA algorithm and log transformed. To get the expression values, averages of three
biological replicates were used. The expression data for
MADS-box genes was extracted by using name search and
the gene IDs listed in table 1. Wherever more than one
probe set was available for one gene, the probe set
designed from 3' end was given preference. Cluster analysis on rows was performed using Euclidean distance metric, and Ward's Linkage rule of Hierarchical clustering.
Differential expression analysis was performed taking
mature leaf as reference to identify genes expressing more
than two folds in panicle and seed, with p values <0.005.
Similarly, for identifying stress-induced genes, differential
expression analysis was performed with no correction
applied and p values less than 0.05. Further K-means clustering was performed to identify the expression patterns
shown by genes expressing in panicle and seed. Since 73
genes (69 probe sets) are represented on chip, expression
profiles of OsMADS78 and 79 were studied using QPCR.
Raw microarray data have been deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus database at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information under the series accession
numbers GSE6893 and GSE6901.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/242

QPCR
Real time PCR reactions were carried out using the same
RNA samples, which were used for microarrays as
described earlier [81]. In brief, primers were designed for
all the genes preferentially from 3' end of the gene using
PRIMER EXPRESS version 2.0 (PE Applied Biosystems,
USA) with default parameters. Each primer was checked
using BLAST tool of NCBI database with filter off for its
specificity for respective gene, which was further confirmed by dissociation curve analysis obtained after the
PCR reaction. First strand cDNA was synthesized by
reverse transcription using 4 μg of total RNA in 100 μl of
reaction volume using high-capacity cDNA Archive kit
(Applied Biosystems, USA). Diluted cDNA samples were
used for Real time PCR analysis with 200 nM of each
primer mixed with SYBR Green PCR master as per manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was carried out in 96well optical reaction plates (Applied Biosystems, USA),
using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System and
software (PE Applied Biosystems, USA). To normalize the
variance among samples, Actin was used as endogenous
control. Relative expression values were calculated after
normalizing against the maximum expression value.
These data were further normalized to ease the profile
matching to that obtained from microarrays.
