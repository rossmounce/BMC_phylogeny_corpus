Abstract
Background: The origin of eukaryotic cells was one of the most dramatic evolutionary transitions in the history of life.
It is generally assumed that eukaryotes evolved later then prokaryotes by the transformation or fusion of prokaryotic
lineages. However, as yet there is no consensus regarding the nature of the prokaryotic group(s) ancestral to eukaryotes.
Regardless of this, a hardly debatable fundamental novel characteristic of the last eukaryotic common ancestor was the
ability to exploit prokaryotic biomass by the ingestion of entire cells, i.e. phagocytosis. The recent advances in our
understanding of the social life of prokaryotes may help to explain the origin of this form of total exploitation.
Presentation of the hypothesis: Here I propose that eukaryotic cells originated in a social environment, a
differentiated microbial mat or biofilm that was maintained by the cooperative action of its members. Cooperation was
costly (e.g. the production of developmental signals or an extracellular matrix) but yielded benefits that increased the
overall fitness of the social group. I propose that eukaryotes originated as selfish cheaters that enjoyed the benefits of
social aggregation but did not contribute to it themselves. The cheaters later evolved into predators that lysed other
cells and eventually became professional phagotrophs. During several cycles of social aggregation and dispersal the
number of cheaters was contained by a chicken game situation, i.e. reproductive success of cheaters was high when they
were in low abundance but was reduced when they were over-represented. Radical changes in cell structure, including
the loss of the rigid prokaryotic cell wall and the development of endomembranes, allowed the protoeukaryotes to avoid
cheater control and to exploit nutrients more efficiently. Cellular changes were buffered by both the social benefits and
the protective physico-chemical milieu of the interior of biofilms. Symbiosis with the mitochondial ancestor evolved after
phagotrophy as alphaproteobacterial prey developed post-ingestion defence mechanisms to circumvent digestion in the
food vacuole. Mitochondrial symbiosis triggered the origin of the nucleus. Cilia evolved last and allowed eukaryotes to
predate also on planktonic prey. I will discuss how this scenario may possibly fit into the contrasting phylogenetic
frameworks that have been proposed.
Testing the hypothesis: Some aspects of the hypothesis can be tested experimentally by studying the level of
exploitation cheaters can reach in social microbes. It would be interesting to test whether absorption of nutrients from
lysed fellow colony members can happen and if cheaters can evolve into predators that actively digest neighbouring cells.
Implications of the hypothesis: The hypothesis highlights the importance of social exploitation in cell evolution and
how a social environment can buffer drastic cellular transformations that would be lethal for planktonic forms.

Background
The origin of eukaryotes from prokaryotic ancestors
involved profound changes in cellular architecture [1].
The exact order and causation of these changes are still
intensely debated [2-6], but there is an emerging consensus regarding the key cellular features already present in
the last eukaryotic common ancestor. These include,
among others, the presence of mitochondria, a dynamic
endomembrane system comprising endosomes, lysosomes, phagosomes, autophagosomes, nuclear compartmentalisation, an endoplasmic reticulum, a Golgicomplex, actin-based lamellipodia, and a centriole-based
cilium [7-9].
Although several models have been proposed on the origin of eukaryotes, here I distinguish two major model
types that differ in one important aspect regarding the
timing of the acquisition of key eukaryotic features. In one
model type the primary event in eukaryogenesis is a symbiosis, a merger of two distinct prokaryotic lineages
[2,3,10-12]. This symbiotic event, sometimes imagined
starting off as a metabolic association [2,3,11], is then
thought to have triggered all subsequent cellular changes,
including the origin of endomembranes. In the alternative
model the development of an endomembrane system,
and most importantly of phagotrophy, precedes the symbiotic acquisition of a protomitochondrium [4,5,13].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

basal fungus Rozella allomycis can even phagocytose
organelles of its host [27]. Among Bikonts (Plantae, Alveolata, Rhizaria, Excavata, Chromista) [8,28-31], representing the other branch of the eukaryotic tree, phagocytosis
is also widespread [22]. With the exception of Plantae all
major Bikont groups contain phagotrophic taxa [4,30-33].
If the eukaryotic tree is rooted between Unikonts and
Bikonts [8,28], the eukaryotic cenancestor was clearly
phagotrophic. This remains true even if the tree is rooted
on Diplomonads (e.g. Enteromonas, Giardia) or Parabasalids (e.g. Trichomonas), formerly believed to be early
branching, because these taxa are also phagotrophic [3436]. Based on the presence of a T3/T7-like polymerase in
all mitochondrial genomes except Jakobids it has been
suggests that these protists may be early branching
[37,38]. Jakobids are also phagotrophs [39] so a rooting
between them and the rest of eukaryotes would still mean
that the cenancestor was phagotrophic.
The ancestral presence of phagotrophy in eukaryotes
means that all models of eukaryogenesis have to account
for its origins. To date none of the symbiotic scenarios is
sufficiently developed to explain why a prior endosymbiosis triggered the development of phagotrophy. If the
order of origins is reversed, the problem disappears:
phagotrophy can easily account for the acquisition of
symbionts (the phagotrophic origin of plastids is generally accepted). Phagotrophy-first models have therefore
primarily to account for the origin of an endomembrane
system and phagotrophy from a non-phagotrophic
prokaryotic ancestor.

The recognition that all extant amitochondriate protists
once harboured mitochondria [14-18] seemed to tip the
balance in favour of symbiosis-first models [2,19]. However, the presence of mitochondria in the last eukaryotic
common ancestor (cenancestor) does not necessarily
mean that mitochondria came before phagotrophy since
phagotrophy was also present in the cenancestor [8].
Phagotrophy-first models are therefore as valid as ever
[20,21].

Here I present a novel scenario on the origin of phagotrophy and other eukaryotic features that emphasizes the
social context of the prokaryote-eukaryote transition. I
propose that eukaryotes originated in a multicellular bacterial mat or biofilm through social conflict and a continuing evolutionary arms race. I will show that a social
scenario can help to explain both how phagotrophic
exploitation originated and how the drastic cellular transitions (e.g. the loss of a rigid cell wall) could have
occurred without a severe reduction in fitness of the transitional forms.

The ancestry of phagotrophy is evidenced by its broad
phyletic distribution among eukaryotes [22]. Among
Unikonts, representing one major branch of the eukaryotic tree [8], Metazoa, Amoebozoa [23], Choanoflagellates
[24], and several other protist groups are phagotrophic
[25]. Fungi lost the ability of phagocytosis early in their
evolution [26]. The closest known relative to fungi, the
amoeboid protist Nuclearia, is a phagotroph [25]. Basal
fungi can also have amoeboid phases such as the
zoospores of some Chytridiomycota [26]. The pathogenic

It has become increasingly recognised in recent years that
a wide variety of prokaryotes lives in biofilms, highly
structured multicellular, often multispecies communities.
[40-42]. Biofilms are composed of microcolonies encased
in an extracellular polymer matrix [43] that form on surfaces during a highly ordered developmental sequence
[40]. The formation of biofilms starts with the attachment
of cells to the surface and continues with the secretion of
an extracellular matrix. Biofilms eventually mature into a
stratified structure with marked differences in cellular

Biology Direct 2007, 2:3

morphologies and gene expression patterns between cells
in the outside and the inside [44,45]. During biofilm maturation the extracellular matrix forms a network of channels facilitating nutrient and water exchange in the
interior of the biofilm [40]. From mature biofilms individual cells, spores or cell clusters shed off and disperse to
re-initiate the developmental cycle at colonisable surfaces
[46-48].
The formation of biofilms is a social strategy that involves
a costly contribution from the cooperating individuals
and confers a fitness-benefit to the group [49] (but see
also [50]). The costs can include the production of a
developmental signal, an extracellular matrix, digestive
enzymes or altruistic self-sacrifice. The benefits include,
among others, a decreased risk of predation, an increased
resistance to antibiotics or toxic environmental conditions and more effective resource exploitation [51-54]. In
social microbes dispersal is restricted to a fraction of the
group and depends on the altruism of non-dispersing colony members. Altruistic members can for example form a
fruiting body stalk or supply nutrients to dispersing cells
by autolysis. Lysis can be induced either cell autonomously as part of biofilm maturation [47,55] or by the
dispersing cells that secrete a killer toxin [56].
As in all social systems the benefits of cooperation can be
undermined by selfish 'cheaters' that use, but do not contribute to a collectively produced fitness-enhancing
resource. As a result, cheaters can grow faster and can be
overrepresented during dispersal. The emergence of cheaters from within a cooperating social group has been
described in several cases, including prokaryotic and
eukaryotic microbes and viruses [49,57-60]. The analysis
of frequency-dependent cheater fitness by evolutionary
game theory predicts that some cheater genotypes should
persist over long evolutionary time [61]. There is also theoretical [62] and experimental [63] evidence that cheater
genotypes can coexist with their social kin over several
cycles of competition.
A game theoretical approach is very useful to analyse the
social interactions in microbes [61]. In game theory, interacting players with distinct strategies compete for a fitness
enhancing benefit [1,64]. The gain of each player depends
on the strategy of other players. In the case of social
microbes, instead of considering two players, one can
conceive a large group of cells within which subpopulations have distinct genotypes and social strategies [61]. In
a social microbial framework, cells can either cooperate
(form a fruiting body stalk etc.) or defect and become
potential cheaters. The benefit of cooperation vs. defection depends on the frequency of the players exhibiting
each strategy and on the extent of defection. This can
range from non-contribution to direct exploitation (e.g.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

predation). The benefit of each strategy can be represented
in a fitness matrix (Fig. 1). Mutual cooperators receive a
fitness benefit, R, the 'reward for cooperation'. A small
group of defectors within a large group of cooperators
receives T, the 'temptation to defect'. If defectors are at
high abundance, they receive P, the 'punishment for
mutual defection'. Exploited cooperators receive S, the
'suckers payoff'. If the fitness enhancing benefit depends
on the cooperative action of a social group, the matrix of
frequency dependent payoffs is best represented by the
'chicken game' [61]. In the chicken game the benefit of
defectors is higher then that of cooperators when they are
at low abundance but falls below cooperator benefit when
defectors reach a critical abundance (T>R>S>P) [61].
The 'prisoner's dilemma', another matrix of fitness relationships, seems to be less suited to describe the fitness
relationships for social microbes. In the prisoner's
dilemma, cheating always has a fitness advantage over
cooperation (T>R>P>S). This fitness matrix corresponds
to cases where an independent resource is being exploited,
such as a growth medium by bacteria [59] or a cell's cytoplasm by viruses [60].
The game theoretical framework describes the fitness gain
of each genotype during one repetition of the game. During several rounds of social aggregation and dispersal, the
game is always repeated and the long-term evolutionary
outcome will depend on the fitness matrix. The fitness
relationships in the chicken game can maintain genetic
polymorphism because both types have a selective advantage when rare [63]. Besides the fitness matrix, the longterm coexistence of defector and cooperator genotypes
also critically depends on the mode of dispersal and the
dynamics of formation of social aggregation. If dispersal
and colonisation happen by single cells, the survival of
defectors is not possible since they are not able to build
social groups alone. However, if dispersal happens
through clusters of cells (e.g. by clusters of spores or by the
detachment of larger fragments from the social group
[47]) defector genotypes can be maintained. Social aggregation following dispersal of single cells can also lead to
defector persistence [62].
Cheating and stronger forms of exploitation can undermine the stability of social groups and can even lead to the
extinction of a social colony [63]. The presence of cheaters, presenting a 'cheater load' to the social group, is
expected to lead to the evolution of strategies by which
social groups can restrain or exclude cheaters. There are
several theoretically possible mechanisms for cheater control, including intrinsic cheater inferiority or active policing strategies [65]. It is also possible that cheaters evolve
ways to avoid the policing strategies that can lead to an
evolutionary arms race between cheaters and cooperators.

Proposed fitness relationships during increasing social exploitation by protoeukaryotes. The fitness matrix of the
chicken game (above) shows the relative magnitude of the fitness gain for players with different strategies (defectors or cooperators) depending on the strategy of other players. In the case of social microbes, players can be conceived as subpopulations
within a group of cells displaying distinct genotypes and social strategies. The dependence of cheater fitness on cheater frequency (below), corresponding to the fitness matrix of the chicken game, illustrates the selective scenario for the evolution of
more potent cheaters.

Here I propose that the evolutionary transition from
social prokaryotes to eukaryotic phagotrophs may have
had transitory stages where protoeukaryotes played as
cheaters in the social game of microbial biofilms. Cheaters later evolved into professional predators because of an
ongoing evolutionary arms race between them and their
cooperating host. I present a selective scenario for the origin of phagotrophy and discuss it from a game theoretical
perspective. I also describe how this selective scenario can
explain major cellular transformations during eukaryogenesis.

Presentation of the hypothesis
A social selective framework for the origin of phagotrophic
exploitation
The ancestral feeding strategy of eukaryotes is based on
the phagotrophic ingestion of other cells and intracellular
digestion. I propose that such phagotrophic exploitation
originated as a social cheater strategy in the interior of a
social prokaryotic biofilm. Here I describe a selective scenario that can explain a gradual increase in the exploitation of a group of cell (the social host) by another one
(the protoeukaryotes).

In the selective framework I propose, the relationship
between cheater fitness and frequency is consistent with
the fitness matrix of the chicken game (Fig. 1). With the
increase of the magnitude of social exploitation during
the origin of phagotrophy the relative magnitude of the
fitness values remains unchanged (T>R>S>P) but the
absolute values change (T increases, S decreases). When
cheater abundance is low, cellular-level selection will
favour cheater genotypes conferring higher levels of
exploitation. Such 'local competition' is known to favour
the spread of cheaters [66,67]. When cheaters are abundant, the density of the population decreases [68]. After
reaching a critical cheater frequency, a colony will fail to
produce dispersing cells and will go extinct. Colony-level
selection or 'global competition' therefore restricts cheaters and promotes cooperation [67]. In this selective scenario, it is expected that cheater efficiency will
continuously increase while genetic polymorphism is
maintained. Parallel with increased exploitation the
number of cheaters a social colony can support decreases.
This way the overall cheater load of social groups remains
constant. Cellular-level selection can thus drive an
increase in exploitation while colony-level selection
allows the long-term persistence of cheaters during several
rounds of dispersal and social development.
I propose that in parallel with the evolution of cheating by
protoeukaryotes the social host evolved active policing
strategies [65]. By policing the host tried to discriminate,
exclude or kill cheaters. As policing strategies evolved only
those protoeukaryotes survived that were able to evolve

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

mechanisms of avoidance. This situation could have led
to an evolutionary arms race between the social host and
the cheaters, similar to antagonistic coevolution between
a host and its pathogens [69].
Below I describe how the two major selective factors,
namely for increased exploitation and for the avoidance
of policing strategies, could have driven cellular changes
during eukaryogenesis.
Cellular changes of eukaryogenesis driven by social conflict
Detailed, cell biologically sound evolutionary scenarios
for many of the cellular changes during eukaryogenesis
have been presented [4,5,13,21,70-72]. These scenarios
are cell biologically realistic and are backed by bioinformatic and structural analyses of cellular components. I
will here consider some critical major steps without much
cell biological detail and place these in the social cheater
scenario. It is therefore not the cell biological scenario that
is novel here, but the attempt to define the social, ecological causation of these changes in more detail.

A plausible sequence of changes I propose is the following: social cheating, predation by extracellular digestion
and diffuse nutrient uptake, cell wall loss, development of
secretory and endocytic membranes, development of
amoeboid motility allowing migration between colonies,
development of phagotrophy to maximize feeding efficiency, uptake and enslavement of an alphaproteobacterium, switch from fermentation to respiration, origin of
the nucleus triggered by mitochondrial symbiosis, development of cilia allowing planktonic predation, eukaryotic
radiation. Although this sequence may seem arbitrary, the
order of many of these steps is strongly constrained (e.g.
phagotrophy could not have evolved in a cell with a rigid
cell wall; cilia had to evolve after endomembranes etc., see
[4,5,13,21,70-72] for further cell biological details).
Protoeukaryotic cheaters could have originated by reducing their contribution to a cooperatively produced fitness
enhancing resource, e.g. by suppressing an altruistic autolysis program. Cheaters thus benefited from the altruism of
social colony members without contributing equally.
Later cheaters could have evolved mechanisms to actively
trigger the autolysis of some host cells to further benefit
from the excess nutrients released.
According to most models, the rigid prokaryotic cell wall
had to be lost early during eukaryogenesis and it could
have conferred resistance to antibiotics [20]. In the social
cheater model, it can be explained as an adaptation to
avoiding policing strategies targeting the cell wall. The
social host could have evolved novel cell wall synthesis
inhibitory antibiotics (and the necessary resistance traits)
to exclude cheaters. Cheaters that survived cell wall syn-

thesis inhibition (e.g. by internally rigidifying their plasmamembrane) avoided further cell wall policing. Cell
wall loss was possible because the interior of biofilms provided osmotic, chemical and mechanical protection
thereby buffering this radical cellular transformation.
Subsequently protoeukaryotes could lyse host cells by
secreting cell-wall digestive enzymes, without a risk of
self-digestion. Cheaters thus evolved into cell wall-less
predatory 'protoplasts' that externally digested other cells
of the colony and took up diffusing nutrients. Secretion
was not wasteful since biofilms limited diffusion and
digestive enzymes could reach high concentrations.
After cell wall loss the plasmamembrane could be tubulated, vesiculated or protruded by the developing
cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton, evolving from filament
systems present in prokaryotes [73-77], provided tensional integrity to the wall-less cells and a scaffold for vesicle trafficking. The first endomembranes were probably
secretory tubules continuous with the plasma membrane
that re-formed after each cell division [5]. The development of the first endomembranes allowed protoeukaryotes to secrete enzymes and to take up nutrients more
efficiently. Novel policing strategies could also have contributed to driving endomembrane development. The
host could have developed novel antibiotics to control
protoeukaryotes. The signal peptidase, the signal peptide
cleaving serine protease located on the extracellular side
of the plasmamembrane, could have represented an easy
antibiotic target (e.g. to arylomycins and beta-lactames
[78,79]). Its inhibition could have provided a means for
the host to interfere with protoeukaryote secretion. The
signal peptidase of protoeukaryotes was directly exposed
to the extracellular space and hiding it in intracellular
tubules could have reduced its accessibility.
Lamellipodial motility, relying on actin-dependent membrane protrusion, adhesion and contraction, evolved to
increase the efficiency of predation. For the first time in
the history of life a flexible membrane and an underlying
dynamic cytoskeleton could be used for protruding,
adhering, sensing and signalling, and allowed protoeukaryotes to disperse actively inside the colony and also to
invade other colonies by amoeboid motility on surfaces.
Protoeukaryotes became generalist predators. With the
evolution of active motility, protoeukaryotes relied less
and less on passive dispersal (e.g. inside clusters of spores)
and could actively forage their environment. As protoeukaryotes became independent from their social ancestor,
their susceptibility to policing strategies also decreased.
The selective forces became largely independent of the
social context and further evolution was driven by the efficiency of predation.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

Phagotrophy evolved as the most efficient system of predatory exploitation. It reduced the amount of digestive
enzymes to be secreted and allowed the complete uptake
of an engulfed cell's material [4]. I propose that besides
providing more efficient food uptake, phagotrophy also
had a decisive influence on protoeukaryote catabolism. In
heterotrophs, generally there is a trade-off between the
rate and the yield of ATP production (high rate but low
yield versus low rate but high yield). One mole of glucose
can for example be metabolised by respiration, yielding ~
32 moles of ATP, but at a low rate. Glycolysis and fermentation yield only 2 moles of ATP per mole glucose, but at
a higher rate [80]. If a cell uses a pathway with high yield
and low rate it can produces more ATP per mole glucose
and can consequently grow more from a given amount of
resource. However, if such a cell is in resource competition with other cells that produce ATP at a higher rate but
low overall yield, it will be in disadvantage [80]. The cells
using the higher rate pathway (such as fermentation) will
grow faster, even though they exploit the common
resource inefficiently [81]. Generally if single-celled heterotrophs exploit external resources in a non-cooperative
manner their growth-rate is maximal if they use reactions
with the highest rate of ATP production even if at lower
overall yield (e.g. fermentation of external sugars by Lactobacilli [80,82]). In contrast, if an internal resource is utilised (such as in animals or phagotrophs) using pathways
with maximal ATP yield, even if at a lower rate, is expected
to be favoured [80]. This could mean that with the evolution of internal resource use (phagotrophy) there was a
strong selective pressure for pathways with higher yield of
ATP production. Protoeukaryotic phagotrophs could have
attained this by enslaving a respiring alphaproteobacterial
prey. Phagotrophy and mitochondrial respiration were
therefore synergistic in the evolution of efficient energy
generation. Importantly, alphaproteobacterial symbiosis
into a non-phagotrophic, fermenting osmotroph would
not have had the same advantage than a phagotrophic fermenter could have had. This difference in the 'usefulness
of respiration' between osmotrophs and phagotrophs
gives therefore further theoretical support to phagotrophy-early scenarios.
Mitochondrial symbiosis could have initiated as an alphaproteobacterial phagotrophic prey circumvented digestion in the food vacuole. As predator pressure increased
with the evolution of phagotrophy bacterial prey started
to evolve pre- and post-ingestion defence mechanisms
(and continues to do so ever since [83,84]). Examples of
present proto/eukaryotic endosymbioses indicate that
engulfed bacterial prey can escape digestion and establish
a permanent presence in a phagotroph [85,86]. After the
escape from the neutralised food vacuole alphaproteobacteria were enslaved by the insertion of a host-encoded
ADP/ATP carrier. Using alphaproteobacterial respiration

Biology Direct 2007, 2:3

phagocytosed food could be converted into ATP with a
high yield. The symbiont gradually evolved into an
organelle via endosymbiotic gene transfer to the host
genome [87] and the evolution of mitochondrial targeting
mechanisms [88].
Mitochondrial symbiosis had a decisive impact on eukaryotic cell architecture. The distinct cytoplasmic, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial versions of Hsp70
chaperons of alphaproteobacterial origin indicate that the
final stages of ER evolution could have overlapped with
the establishment of mitochondria as an organelle [4,89].
The spread of group II self-splicing introns from protomitochondria may also have triggered the evolution of telomeres and linear chromosomes [90]. Mitochondrial
symbiosis probably also had a critical role in the evolution of nuclear compartmentalisation [72,91,92]. Nuclear
compartmentalisation evolved when a tubular-vesicular
membrane system surrounded chromatin and nuclear
pores started to function as selective molecular sieves. The
nuclear envelope evolved autogenously from pre-existing
secretory endomembranes, while nuclear pores evolved
by the modification of vesicle-curving complexes already
present on endomembranes and functioning in vesicle
budding [4,5,70].
Cilia evolved autogenously after the nucleus and mitochondria as sensory-motile organelles [71,93,94]. Ciliumbased motility allowed eukaryotes to conquer pelagic
habitats and to predate on planktonic prey. Long-term
pelagic foraging was facilitated by other important adaptations including the origin of self-digestion (autophagy)
that allowed survival under starvation conditions by
digesting parts of the cytoplasm [95]. These adaptations to
pelagic predation were probably the final major steps in
eukaryogenesis. Having developed highly efficient ingestion, energy conversion, motility, and sensory systems
eukaryotes rapidly diversified and quickly invaded most
habitats where prokaryotic prey was present. The ubiquity
of eukaryotic predation also prevented any further
attempts to phagotrophy.
The possible phylogenetic contexts of the emergence of
protoeukaryotic cheaters
Given the widespread occurrence of social aggregation in
prokaryotes [45,47,51,96-118] the hypothesis presented
here in principle could fit into different phylogenetic settings. The aim of this paper is not to argue for any one of
these in particular. Here I only briefly overview some of
the more important phylogenetic frameworks that have
been proposed and discuss how the cheater scenario
could fit into them.

The mosaic nature of eukaryotic genomes consisting of
genes of both eubacterial and archaebacterial affinity

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

points to a fusion or symbiosis between members of these
two groups [119-123]. Most parsimoniously, this can be
explained as a merger of an archaebacterium (either stem
or crown) and an alphaproteobacterium, the ancestor of
mitochondria. A gammaproteobacterial [124] or myxobacterial [3] contribution to eukaryotes has also been proposed.
In the framework of the first scenario, social cheaters
could have evolved from an archaebacterium in an
archaebacterial biofilm. These cheaters then developed
phagotrophy and internalised an alphaproteobacterium.
Alternatively, cheaters may have developed in the stem
lineage of the sister-groups archaebacteria and eukaryotes.
According to the standard view of the tree of life archaebacteria or the stem archaebacteria/eukaryotes diverged
from the last universal common ancestor independently
from eubacteria (i.e. the universal tree is rooted between
archaebacteria/eukaryotes and eubacteria).
In the 'neomuran' scenario [4,13] the stem lineage of
archaebacteria/eukaryotes derives from a Gram-positive
bacterium. This requires that the universal tree of life be
rooted within Gram-negative bacteria for which strong
arguments have recently been made [125]. In this scenario, wall-less cheaters were the ancestors of both archaebacteria (that re-evolved a rigid cell wall) and eukaryotes.
Accordingly, cheaters could have evolved from Gram-positive, endospore forming bacteria. Phagotrophy could
have evolved by the modification of the endospore formation pathway. There are striking similarities between the
two processes. Both include the total engulfment of
another cell by membrane invagination and fission. During both processes, the engulfing cell secretes hydrolytic
enzymes to digest the septal cell wall (endospore formation) or the whole engulfed cell (phagocytosis). Interestingly, endospore formation can also be completed in the
absence of the cell wall (i.e. by 'protoplasts') in Bacillus by
adhesion and a ratchet mechanism [126].
In the myxobacterial scenario cheaters could have evolved
from social myxobacteria [3,127]. As phagocytosis
evolved an archaebacterium was internalised that evolved
into the nucleus. An alphaproteobacterium was also
phagocytosed subsequently and developed into mitochondria. Although many cell biological arguments can
be made why an archaebacterium could not have evolved
into a nucleus [21], it could still have provided archaebacterial genes.

Testing the hypothesis
The selective scenario for increasing social exploitation, a
crucial aspect of the hypothesis, can be tested using experimental model systems of social microbes (e.g. Myxococcus, Bacillus). The social cheater model proposes that an

evolutionary arms race between protoeukaryotic cheaters
and their host led to changing strategies and changing
molecular mechanisms of cheating. It would be interesting to study experimentally how cheaters can be controlled by policing mechanisms and how new cheater
genotypes can evolve under policing pressure. This could
be done using serial competition experiments between
cheater and social genotypes during several generations.
In principle, there should be an escape from any policing
strategy.
Most research on the evolution of social strategies is carried out using soil-dwelling microbes such as Myxococcus
and Dictyostelium. It would be interesting to see whether
social conflict can also originate in marine microbial biofilms since these were the first social systems to have
evolved [128] and their study is probably also more relevant to the origin of eukaryotes. Such experiments could
be carried out using both eubacterial (e.g. Pseudomonas
tunicata) and archaebacterial marine biofilm forming species.
The social cheater model specifically proposes that cell
wall-less protoeukaryotes as protoplasts had better
chances of survival inside biofilms than they would have
had as planktonic forms. This could be tested experimentally for example the following way: one could generate a
temperature-sensitive mutant in a cell wall synthesis pathway gene that leads to cell wall loss at the restrictive temperature. This strain can be labelled with one resistance
and can be mixed with a differently marked parental
strain at the permissive temperature. The cells can then be
grown either as a biofilm or a suspension culture. Following a shift to the restrictive temperature and further
growth one could plate the cells and count the frequency
of both types.

Implications of the hypothesis
The importance of social conflict is widely appreciated in
evolutionary biology. The social cheater hypothesis highlights the importance of social conflict in one of life's
most dramatic evolutionary transitions, the origin of
eukaryotic cells. The hypothesis also emphasizes how a
social environment can buffer drastic cellular transformations that would be lethal for single-celled forms. The
social framework can also provide a gradual cell evolutionary transition scenario from cheating to amoeboid
and pelagic predation until the radiation of eukaryotes.

Reviewer's report 1
Eugene V Koonin National Center for Biotechnology
Information, National Library of Medicine, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20894, USA

The paper develops a scenario for the origin of eukaryotes
under which protoeukaryotes started off as cheaters in
prokaryotic biofilms, then shed the characteristic prokaryotic cell walls and so became phagocytes, then turned into
"professional predators", and then engulfed the alphaproteobacterial ancestor of the mitochondria; the mitochondrial endosymbiosis triggered the evolution of other
major eukaryotic innovations, such as the nucleus.
This is not at all an unreasonable scenario, and if the principal message is that eukaryotes evolved in tightly knit
microbial communities, such as biofilms, I tend to agree.
Also, I accept the fact that all currently known eukaryotes
have mitochondria or remnants thereof does not necessarily imply that the mitochondrial endosymbiosis was
the event that triggered the emergence of all major eukaryotic innovations. It is, indeed, in principle, conceivable
that phagocytosis antedated endosymbiosis. However, the
specific succession of stages from a prokaryotic cheater to
the protoeukaryote reads like a "just so story": everything
is plausible but there is no specific evidence in support of
any of the steps.
Author's response
I would say it is a constrained speculation rather then a
"just so story". Any random order of events would hardly
be as plausible evolutionarily as the one presented here.
For example, it would be hard to argue that a cell with a
rigid cell wall developed phagotrophy and endomembrane dynamics. The loss of the cell wall is a 'must' in any
scenario. The order of the other events discussed in the
transition scenario is substantiated by cell biology and
molecular, structural and phylogenetic analyses, and I
refer to the relevant literature, but don't repeat all these
arguments (e.g. about the early origin of secretory
endomembranes and the origin of the nuclear membrane
from them, or the origin of cilia from a Golgi-like transport system, i.e. most likely after endomembranes). So
many of the cell biological transitions are supported by
evidence, of course only as good as it can be when we try
to reconstruct past events from present patterns. I made
this clearer in the revised text. The novel thing in this
paper is not the cell biological scenario, but the attempt to
find the social, ecological context of these changes.

The author declares that he has no competing interests.
Furthermore, the elaborate succession of steps is, exactly,
what bothers me. If cheating is such an advantageous
strategy and phagocytosis is so good for social prokaryo-

tes, why are we not aware of any prokaryotes that have
been locked during their evolution in one of these stages?
Author's response
Cheaters are abundantly present in social systems and can
easily be generated in the laboratory. Phagotrophs, of
course, not. What we don't know, how far cheaters can go
in exploiting their host in nature. This could be partly
addressed by long-term competition experiments as I suggested.

Generally, we do not know of any prokaryotic phagocytes
which seems to be better compatible with the emergence
of phagocytosis not before but after the critical event that
was the start of eukaryogenesis...and acquisition of mitochondria looks like the best candidate for the role of such
an event. So we go full circle: the hypothesis presented
here is reasonable, even plausible, it is just that the evidence is not there. Or, is it the case that cheating prokaryotes capable of phagocytosis, actually, are there but are
relatively rare and hard to cultivate? Perhaps, they could
be discovered, e.g., in poorly studied archaeal biofilms?
That would completely change the status of the present
paper, and perhaps, even our understanding of the origin
of eukaryotes in general. In the section on "Testing the
hypothesis", it might be useful to be somewhat more
explicit about this crucial validation of the proposed scenario.
Author's response
We don't know of any phagotrophic prokaryotes in
nature, but we don't know of free-living mitochondriumbearing prokaryotes either (locked at an intermediary
stage). It means that exactly the same question about such
a 'critical validation' can be posed about any scenario.
However, this would be too cheap like this. I don't think
there will be any phagotrophic prokaryotes discovered.
Maybe the text gave the wrong impression that it was easy
or fast to evolve phagotrophy. It was definitely not, and
understanding it in detail may be one of the most difficult
problems in cell evolution. What I tried to emphasize is
that phagotrophy is the most crucial ecological novelty
about eukaryotes and it is still extremely important and
widespread today. Simply speaking, there was a huge
prokaryotic biomass to be harvested by predators, and few
would doubt that complete internalization is more efficient then external digestion and osmotrophy. There was
a completely vacant niche to be filled, and it has been
filled by the evolution of phagotrophic eukaryotes. Filled,
sensu strictu, because there is hardly any place where there
are prokaryotes, but no phagotrophic eukaryotes. So there
is an ecological ceiling, and no prokaryote will again be
able to break it to become phagotrophic. I also tried to
devise a scenario that describes a gradual transition to
phagotrophy through milder forms of exploitation.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

About mitochondria as the best candidates: is there any
evidence there that they came before endomembranes? I
am not aware of any. This discussion somewhat reminds
me of the 'contingency' versus 'convergence' debate of
Gould and Conway Morris. According to the contingency
scenario, the uptake of mitochondria was a unique and
low-probability event that then triggered eukaryogenesis.
In contrast, the convergence scenario would state that
predators always appear when there is food to be ingested,
i.e. eukaryogenesis was driven by well-known ecological
principles, and only limited by the lack of mutations or
external factors (e.g. high-enough oxygen concentration).
I find the second perspective in this particular case more
revealing.
Besides, mitochondria-early scenarios have very serious
problems that have not yet been solved. How did symbiosis happen into a cell with a rigid cell wall? How did the
origin of mitochondria trigger everything in eukaryogenesis? To date no realistic scenario exists that could explain
why and how mitochondrial symbiosis led to the evolution of a secretory and endocytic membrane system, let
alone phagotrophy. One would necessarily have to come
back to scenarios such as the one here to explain how
phagocytosis originated, because phagotrophy is what it
is, from any perspective: the eating of other cells. So the
selective pressure involved had to be the same: it was
advantageous to eat. But then again: why only a cell with
a mitochondrium could have evolved that capacity? I am
not at all convinced about the necessity to have mitochondria in order to start to evolve a eukaryote. This view of
looking at the problem is a reference to an extreme contingency: nothing could have happened until the uptake of
the mitochondrium that then solved (almost) everything.
The section on "phylogenetic contexts", while including a
disclaimer that this is not the central theme of the paper,
reads too rudimentary and too "objective". I find it very
strange that the scenario where the engulfing host is an
archaeon (or a representative of a stem archaeal-eukaryotic lineage) is presented on exactly the same footing with
two other scenarios that are, simply, unsupported. I am
not trying to push any kind of agenda, I just believe that
this is what the data point to.
Author's response
I am aware of the difficulties with this presentation. The
point was to emphasize that the cheater scenario could in
principle fit into any phylogenetic context. One can also
see it as a historic overview of some important theories
and phylogenetic propositions regarding eukaryote origins (I changed the text to make it clearer). However,
regarding for example the scenario of Cavalier-Smith, I am
not even convinced that it is 'simply unsupported'. To be
able to make such a claim with confidence one would

have to provide a detailed refutation of his polarizing
arguments (evidence from evolutionary transition analyses) that point to a Gram-negative rooting of the tree of
life [125]. Ignoring it or saying that it is not evidence is not
a very brave strategy. If the rooting of Cavalier-Smith is
correct, then Archaebacteria and Eukaryotes have to have
derived from some kind of Eubacterium, most probably a
Gram-positive lineage, and solid genomic evidence may
be lacking because of the extremely derived status of the
stem Archaebacterium/Eukaryote. The disclaimer therefore may also be interpreted in a way that I don't have a
strong preference, but try to keep an open mind.
Reviewer's report 2
Purificación López-García, Unité d'Ecologie, Systématique & Evolution, CNRS UMR 8079 Université Paris-Sud,
bât. 360, 91405 Orsay Cedex, France

In this paper, G. Jékely proposes a hypothesis to explain
the origin of phagotrophy, an essential property common
to extant eukaryotic lines, in protoeukaryotic ancestors.
The development of phagotrophy took place after the loss
of the protoeukaryotic cell wall and led to important
changes in cell architecture. The engulfment of one alphaproteobacterium that avoided digestion originated
mitochondria and triggered eukaryogenesis. Phagotrophy
originated in a social context, such as a microbial mat or
biofilm where protoeukaryotes would behave as cheaters
benefiting from the cooperative nature of the community
without contributing to it, and was the consequence of
two selective processes. The first involved the loss of the
cell wall to escape antibiotics or other anti-cheater mechanisms targeting it. Once the cell wall was lost, phagocytosis would have evolved to maximize energy yield by
incorporating preys and using them as an internal
resource.
The proposal presented here is interesting. In fact, the idea
that eukaryotes evolved in microbial mats, biofilms or
other types of sedimentary social communities is implicit
in some previous models (at least several symbiotic models).
Author's response
I cite the syntrophy-hypothesis and the hydrogen-hypothesis that indeed both imply some form of microbial community. One of the most important differences of the
social cheater hypothesis is that is does not start with a
mutually beneficial interaction and the gradual integration of two cells into one, but with exploitation of one cell
by another one.

However, despite its interest, Jékely's idea is very difficult
to test (see below) and does not provide information
allowing discrimination between existing models for the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

origin of eukaryotes or an explanation for the origin of the
eukaryotic nucleus, their key-defining character.
Author's response
The paper doesn't provide new information, but new
arguments in favour of phagotrophy-early models and a
new and detailed social-selective scenario for the origin of
phagotrophy. It also helps to distinguish between models
because it provides an ecologically sound, plausible historical narrative that tries to link ecological/selective causations with cell biological changes and, as a whole
theory, can compete with previous models in its explanatory power (see also the section on historical narratives in
my reply to Igor Zhulin). The autogenous origin of the
nucleus (from pre-existing secretory membranes) can also
be explained in this framework both cell biologically and
regarding the selection pressures involved. I briefly discuss
this and refer to some relevant literature, but a detailed
model for the origin of the nucleus is beyond the scope of
this paper.

A few specific comments follow.
1) I think there is a misuse of the term 'predation' as predation implies the ingestion (phagocytosis) of a prey. To
me, 'digestion of neighboring cells', 'extracellular digestion and diffuse nutrient uptake' (referred to as predation
in the manuscript) correspond to osmotrophy and, as
such, are common to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms. On the contrary, predation (implying phagotrophy) is a property exclusive of eukaryotes. The so-called
'predatory bacteria' such as Bdellovibrio spp. are not
strictly predatory, but osmotrophic. They digest externally
a larger prey into which they penetrate.
Author's response
It is a question about the definition of predation, and I
would rather use the term in a broader sense, referring to
the act of killing of other organisms (the prey) for food.
Whether you eat it in pieces or as a whole, or whether you
digest it externally or internally, are secondary in this
regard (but not when efficiency is concerned).

2) Social cheaters are proposed to lose their cell walls as a
way to escape to cheater-control strategies (e.g. antibiotics) developed by cooperative community members
(referred as the host by Jékely, although this term may be
also misleading). Wall-less cells would be buffered against
osmotic crisis by the protecting biofilm environment.
However, in nature many (if not most) microorganisms
live in biofilms, mats or similar where social conflict
occurs. If biofilms or mats host antibiotic producers that
make antibiotics to fight against competitors or cheaters,
antibiotics would have an increased concentration in the
biofilm due to limited diffusion and microorganisms

(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:3

should cope with that. According to Jékely, cell-wall loss
would be one advantageous adaptation. However, despite
the fact that most microorganisms do form biofilms in
nature, they do not lose their cell-walls. Why (frequent)
cell-wall loss is not observed in natural biofilms or mats?
Author's response
I don't think we know how often cell wall-less mutants
appear in biofilms and what is their short-term fate. What
is worth mentioning here is that cells in a biofilm can
undergo self-induced extensive genetic diversification by a
recA-dependent mechanism
(PNAS 2004 Nov
23;101(47):16630-5). This means that cell wall-less
mutants probably appear more frequently in biofilms
then in suspension. Whether this can happen to cheaters
and enhance their success is not known. See also my
response to Eugene Koonin about why cheaters will probably never again evolve into phagotrophs.

3) Jékely says that phagotrophy evolved as the most efficient system of predatory exploitation, and that this had
to do with the yield of ATP production, which would be
maximized if an internal resource were used. There would
be 'a difference in the usefulness of respiration between
osmotrophs and phagotrophs'. First, the latter is difficult
to understand looking to nature, as O2-respiring bacterial
osmotrophs are ecologically extremely successful. Second,
I found the whole paragraph somewhat unclear, not
knowing exactly if what was advantageous for the protoeukaryote was the phagocytosis of external food and its
digestion as internal resource, the specific phagocytosis of
mitochondrial ancestors and the acquisition of O2-respiration, or both. One possible reading is that Jékely suggests that this need to maximize ATP yield would have
promoted the phagocytosis of mitochondrial O2-respiring
ancestors within O2-respiring and/or fermentative protoeukaryotes (referred to as heterotrophs in the text). I can
understand the advantage of acquiring O2-respiring mitochondria by a fermentative host and any other type of
host using a less energy-yielding pathway (e.g. other types
of respiration, methanogenesis would be one if O2 was
not inhibitory for this pathway). However, I have more
difficulties to understand why an O2-respiring singlecelled organism (even if in community) needs to incorporate O2-respiring mitochondria. Organisms adapted to
O2-respiration would respire rather than ferment given an
appropriate O2 partial pressure exists. If O2 concentration
is limiting for an O2-respiring host cell, it would be also
limiting for an engulfed respiring alphaproteobacterium.
The most likely explanation would be that mitochondria
conferred O2-respiration to an organism that lacked it.
This part of the hypothesis needs some clarification; perhaps, it would be worthwhile trying to describe better the
nature of the protoeukaryotic ancestor, at least in metabolic terms.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

Author's response
I re-phrased this paragraph to make it clearer. There are a
few important things that I have to reiterate also here. It is
not always true that "Organisms adapted to O2-respiration would respire rather than ferment given an appropriate O2 partial pressure exists". If yeast cells grow in direct
competition on a fermentable resource (such as glucose)
under aerobic conditions, it is not the respiring cells, but
the fermenting ones that grow faster [81]. This is because
fermentation has a higher ATP-generation rate then respiration, even if the yield per 1 mol glucose is lower. In
other words fermentation is more efficient but also more
wasteful then respiration. This is a 'tragedy of the commons' situation (see also [80]). Respiration is the winning
strategy under other conditions, for example when nonfermentable carbon sources (e.g. lactate) are used, or
when it pays off not to be wasteful, even if it is slower (e.g.
utilizing resources in a spatially or temporally structured
environment [81] or internal resources such as in animals
and phagotrophs). Which pathway will provide a higher
growth rate will therefore depend on many parameters
and cells can also switch between the pathways, depending on the conditions. When osmotrophs became phagotrophs many of these parameters (e.g. the nature and
availability of the carbon source) did not change, what
changed is that the resource was used internally and not
externally. And this change should have increased the
selection for evolving or gaining respiration. That's what I
meant when I wrote that respiration is more useful for a
phagotroph then an osmotroph, all other parameters
being equal. So it is easier to explain the origin of mitochondria in a phagotrophic and potentially still fermenting cell both mechanistically and in terms of the selection
pressure driving symbiosis. Methanogenesis is also a possibility, but there is no evidence that it had anything to do
with the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. Whereas we
know that this ancestor had both aerobic mitochondrial
respiration and phagotrophy.

4) Jékely also suggests several ways of testing part of this
hypothesis. One consists to see whether an evolutionary
arms race between cheaters and cooperative community
members leads to changing strategies and molecular
mechanisms of cheating. Another proposes to see whether
cell wall-less mutants survive better in biofilms or in suspension. However, proving both (which, by the way,
would appear likely) does not prove Jékely's hypothesis or
even strongly favor it. It is difficult to test this model,
though this does not invalidate it.
Author's response
These experiments would not prove that eukaryotes
evolved the way I described, but they would greatly substantiate the selective scenario I proposed. Another very
important test of a historical narrative is whether we can

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:3

find a better, more plausible one, and more compatible
with data. The few facts this scenario builds on are the following: (1) phagotrophic exploitation of prokaryotic biomass was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor
and its origin must have played an important role in
eukaryogenesis. (2) Most prokaryotes live in social biofilms, and eukaryotes most likely evolved in a social setting. (3) Evolution is gradual, so phagotrophic
exploitation should have evolved gradually through
milder forms of exploitation. (4) A mild and widespread
form of social exploitation in microbial biofilms is cheating. Having these four facts one only have to put them in
order to have a meaningful historical narrative. That's
what I have done here.
A third point mentioned by Jékely is to study social conflict in marine microbial biofilms 'since nutrient-rich terrestrial soils are not likely to have existed at the origin of
eukaryotes'. I think this is rather gratuitous. We ignore
exactly the environmental conditions at the time eukaryotes originated, and even when they appeared. They might
or might not have evolved in marine environments. However, if we admit that eukaryotes appeared after prokaryotes, the latter had most likely colonized also continental
substrates by the time eukaryotes evolved. Nutrient-rich
environments for microorganisms have sense only at the
microscale. I can very easily imagine many continental
niches where biofilms and nutrient-rich substrates existed
(including freshwater systems also), at least as nutrientrich as the marine environment.
Author's response
You are right about this and I changed this sentence.
Reviewer's report 3
Igor B. Zhulin, Joint Institute for Computational Sciences,
The University of Tennessee – Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6173, USA
Preamble
I will start with the statement that I am certainly a wrong
reviewer for this article. This was my first impression and,
as we all know, it is always the right one. Still, I agreed to
write a review, largely out of curiosity, and also because
microbial biofilms are to a certain degree within my area
of expertise. The second personal statement is that reading
this essay made me understood why all decent universities
keep molecular biologists and ecologist/evolutionary
biologists in two separate departments: we speak different
tongues... The final point for the preamble – I truly think
that hypotheses should not be reviewed. They provide a
reviewer with a wonderful opportunity to add after each
"can", "may" and "if" sarcastic "... or cannot", "...or may
not" and "... what if not"... Hypothesis is usually based on
reasoning and serves a purpose of stimulating others in

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

the field to test it (to find direct evidence for or against it).
It is certainly not a reviewer's job to find "a dead body"
and "a smoking gun".
Author's response
I don't think the only purpose of an evolutionary hypothesis is to stimulate others finding direct evidence for or
against it. About many past events of evolution we will
never have direct evidence (experimental, fossil, molecular or other). Should we then stop thinking about such
events? Definitely not. As Ernst Mayr explains in his last
books, What Makes Biology Unique? (page 32): "With the
experiment unavailable for research in historical biology,
a remarkable new heuristic method has been introduced,
that of historical narratives. Just as in much of theory formation, the scientist starts with a conjecture and thoroughly tests it for its validity, so in evolutionary biology
the scientist constructs a historical narrative, which is then
tested for its explanatory value." In the end it is the explanatory value, the internal consistency, plausibility, and
compatibility with data that counts. So in principle a
reviewer can add after each "can", "may" and "if" sarcastic
"... or cannot", "...or may not" and "... what if not"... and
then see whether the resulting historical narrative has
higher explanatory value.
Essence
As stated above, I am unfamiliar with the language and
techniques of social ecology. To be completely honest, I
dislike applying terms "cheating", "altruism", "self-sacrifice", "exploitation", "cooperation" to non-humans, especially to prokaryotes, simply because all these words
require the presence of an intent. On the other hand, I am
fully aware of the fact that these are legitimate definitions
in ecology. Once again, I am against formal refereeing of
hypotheses; therefore I will only focus on a couple of
underlying postulates and propositions that are related to
my area of expertise.

Table 1 is not needed. It is generally accepted now that
almost all studied microbial species form biofilms. The
list of species in this Table can be significantly expanded
to include alpha-, beta-, and epsilon-proteobacteria and
other clades (E. coli, Salmonella, Burkholderia, Campylobacter, Listeria, Streptococcus, Nitrosomonas, Rhizobium,
Treponema, Porphyromonas and many-many others)
Author's response
I removed Table 1. The references to several examples of
biofilm forming species among both archaebacteria and
eubacteria are now in the main text.

The proposition that "the formation of biofilms is a social
strategy that involves a costly contribution from cooperating individuals..." (page 5, last paragraph) does not have

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:3

experimental support. Quite a few genes are both up- and
down-regulated in both planktonic cultures and biofilms:
their expression profiles are very different (for example,
see BMC Genomics 2006, 7: 162), but I have never seen
data suggesting that it is more costly for a cell to live in a
biofilm. Yes, cells in biofilms excrete more "stuff" into the
matrix, but, for instance, in contrast to cells in biofilms,
planktonic cells produce dozens of proteins in quite some
numbers to build their flagella and use a significant percentage of their total energy to power the flagellar motor.
Nobody ever tried to make any decent calculations (it will
be quite some work) to determine whether it costs more
to be free or to be stuck in the biofilm!

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/3

Author's response
This is good to hear. I don't think any (not totally unreasonable) historical narrative can ever be disproved in the
strict sense. The question is if one can suggest a better one.

Author's response
The point is not to compare the costs of forming biofilms
versus growing in suspension, but contributing to the formation and dispersal of biofilms versus not contributing
to it, yet living in it and enjoying its benefits. So it is less
costly to sit in a biofilm, without secreting the costly
matrix, then sitting in it and secreting the matrix. In this
sense the social strategy (to contribute) is costly. The sparing of this cost can lead to the spread of defectors and
cheaters because if they don't contribute to this 'public
good' they can grow faster. There is experimental demonstration of the invasion of a biofilm by cheaters that don't
contribute to an extracellular cellulosic polymer [49]. It is
also to be noted, though, that extracellular matrix production can also be interpreted as a competitive and not
cooperative strategy [50]. Even if it will turn out to be the
case in some biofilms, there are also other social aspects
of biofilm formation and dispersal, as I explained in the
text.

This hypothesis would be very difficult to test. Suggested
experiment (survival of protoplasts in the biofilm matrix)
will be quite difficult (if at all possible) to implement (as
a relatively recent experimental microbiologist I cannot
see how it can be done technically), and even it is successful, the experiment will fall short of being considered as
evidence.
Author's response
Unless one can re-evolve a eukaryote, none of the microbial experiments I proposed can be considered as decisive
evidence. They would only substantiate some of my
assumptions. Regarding some of the experimental tests, I
am more optimistic, though, and now included a more
detailed suggestion for the protoplast experiment.
