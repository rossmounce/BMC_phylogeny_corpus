Abstract
Background: The shell of the pearl-producing bivalve Pinctada margaritifera is composed of an organic cell-free
matrix that plays a key role in the dynamic process of biologically-controlled biomineralization. In order to increase
genomic resources and identify shell matrix proteins implicated in biomineralization in P. margaritifera, highthroughput Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) pyrosequencing was undertaken on the calcifying mantle, combined
with a proteomic analysis of the shell.
Results: We report the functional analysis of 276 738 sequences, leading to the constitution of an unprecedented
catalog of 82 P. margaritifera biomineralization-related mantle protein sequences. Components of the current
“chitin-silk fibroin gel-acidic macromolecule” model of biomineralization processes were found, in particular a
homolog of a biomineralization protein (Pif-177) recently discovered in P. fucata. Among these sequences, we
could show the localization of two other biomineralization protein transcripts, pmarg-aspein and pmarg-pearlin, in
two distinct areas of the outer mantle epithelium, suggesting their implication in calcite and aragonite formation.
Finally, by combining the EST approach with a proteomic mass spectrometry analysis of proteins isolated from the
P. margaritifera shell organic matrix, we demonstrated the presence of 30 sequences containing almost all of the
shell proteins that have been previously described from shell matrix protein analyses of the Pinctada genus. The
integration of these two methods allowed the global composition of biomineralizing tissue and calcified structures
to be examined in tandem for the first time.
Conclusions: This EST study made on the calcifying tissue of P. margaritifera is the first description of
pyrosequencing on a pearl-producing bivalve species. Our results provide direct evidence that our EST data set
covers most of the diversity of the matrix protein of P. margaritifera shell, but also that the mantle transcripts
encode proteins present in P. margaritifera shell, hence demonstrating their implication in shell formation.
Combining transcriptomic and proteomic approaches is therefore a powerful way to identify proteins involved in
biomineralization. Data generated in this study supply the most comprehensive list of biomineralization-related
sequences presently available among protostomian species, and represent a major breakthrough in the field of
molluskan biomineralization.

Background
Mollusk shell is a natural biomaterial made up of a
mineral phase - calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) - and an
organic cell-free matrix (proteins, glycoproteins, lipids
and polysaccharides) secreted by the external mantle

epithelium, the tissue layer underlying the shell.
Although this matrix represents less than 2% of the
total composition of the shell by dry weight [1], it interacts with the crystal surface to orientate its nucleation
and control crystal polymorphism, in the form of aragonite or calcite, in the different structural layers of the
shell [2]. The highly organized internal structure of
the shell has led to a very interdisciplinary approach to
the study of biomineralization. The secretion of shell by

mollusks is one of the best examples of a matrixmediated mineralization process achieved outside living
tissues [3,4]. Models of mollusk shell biomineralization
have therefore been proposed based on histochemical
studies and ultrastructural observations of the shell,
combined with biochemical analysis of the extracellular
organic matrix. The current “chitin-silk fibroin gel proteins-acidic macromolecules” model proposed by LeviKalisman et al. [5], updated by Addadi et al. [6] and
recently reviewed by Furuhashi et al. [7], was established
from mollusk nacre analysis and involves the major
matrix components of the shell. According to this
model, the major components of biomineralization are
relatively hydrophobic silk proteins and a complex
assemblage of hydrophilic proteins (many of which are
unusually rich in aspartic acid), highly structured in a
polysaccharide b-chitinous framework. These components of the organic matrix are thought to control various aspects of the biomineralization process: the
CaCO 3 crystal polymorphisms (calcite and aragonite)
and the microstructures of shell layers [8]. Since the
publication of the first complete amino-acid sequence of
a nacre-shell protein in 1996 [9], major advances in the
field of molecular biology have led to the identification
of an increasing number of shell matrix proteins [8].
However, the molecular aspects of shell building are still
far from being fully understood.
As marine bivalves are organisms of major economic
interest, attention has been turned to the study of their
genomics during the last decade [10]. In particular, various sequence-based strategies have been developed
for transcriptome studies. Among them, Expressed
Sequence Tag (EST) sequencing programs have proven
to be an effective method for gene discovery and have
been widely used for initiating genomic research in nonmodel organisms [11]. EST collections provide information on the part of the genome that is expressed, and
can be valuable in a number of ways, e.g. gene fishing,
genome annotation and analysis, discovery of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and expression studies such as microarrays. An EST approach to biomineralization offers the opportunity to rapidly identify
transcripts encoding secreted shell proteins, proteins
specific to the pallial space and proteins implicated in
calcium regulation in mantle cells, as well as transcription factors responsible for the regulation of the process.
EST programs have recently been developed for aquaculture bivalve species, in particular the Eastern oyster
(Crassostrea virginica) [12-15], the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) [14,16], and the common blue mussel
(Mytilus galloprovincialis) [17], but these have mainly
been aimed at investigating the mollusk immune
response in the context of environmental or genome
evolution studies. To date, only five studies report the

analysis of EST programs performed on calcifying tissues with the aim of providing more insight into the
biomineralization process. Suppression subtractive
hybridization (SSH) studies were performed on the
bivalve pearl oysters Pinctada fucata [18] and P. margaritifera [19]. Two other studies, involving the vetigastropod Haliotis asinina [20,21] and the bivalve pearl
oyster Pinctada maxima [21], revealed the high
complexity of the calcifying mantle transcriptome, suggesting extensive differences between Bivalvia and Gastropoda in the molecular composition of the organic
matrix guiding the deposit of calcium carbonate polymorphs within the shell. The most recent study [22]
described the transcriptome of the mantle tissue of
Laturnela elliptica, focusing on the datamining of genes
involved in calcium regulation and shell deposition.
Despite these genomic approaches, there is still a small
amount of genomic data available on bivalve species and
this limits our understanding of the dynamic process of
biomineralization.
With the aim of increasing the genomic resources for
the pearl-producing bivalve P. margaritifera, we conducted a pyrosequencing program to analyze the first
EST library produced from the calcifying mantle of this
bivalve. Here we report the functional analysis of 276
738 EST sequences, leading to the constitution of a
P. margaritifera mantle transcript catalog of 82
sequences potentially implicated in the biomineralization
process. Further structural characterization of a set of
proteins was undertaken in addition to transcript localization and proteomic mass spectrometry analysis of proteins isolated from the shell matrix. Our results show
that protein repertoire of the biomineralization process
is conserved within pearl oysters, but also provide direct
evidence that our EST data set covers most of the diversity of the shell matrix protein in P. margaritifera shell.

Methods
1. Mantle RNA Extraction and ESTs library construction

P. margaritifera pearl oysters raised in the Vairao lagoon
were brought to the Ifremer laboratory in Tahiti, French
Polynesia. Total cellular RNA was extracted from 12
mantle samples taken from separate P. margaritifera
individuals, using TRIZOL® Reagent (Life Technologies)
according to manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA
integrity and purity were assessed in a Bioanalyzer 2100
(Agilent - Bonsai Technologies) and using agarose gel
analysis. RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop® ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies Inc).
A pool of 24 μg total RNA (2 μg per sample) was used
to construct a cDNA library. Five μg of full-length double-stranded cDNA was processed by the standard Genome Sequencer library-preparation method using the GS
DNA Library Preparation Kit to generate single-stranded

Joubert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:613
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/613

DNA ready for emulsion PCR (emPCR™). The cDNA
library was pyrosequenced using GS FLX technology
(454/Roche, http://www.454.com/).
2. Contig assembly and functional annotation

EST sequence analysis and assembly were performed by
the Skuldtech Company http://www.skuldtech.com.
ESTs were assembled into clusters using TGICL (TIGR
Gene Indices Clustering tools), freely available on the
sourceforge website http://sourceforge.net/projects/tgicl/
[23]. Overlapping identity percentage and minimum
overlapping length parameters was set to 98% and 60
bp, respectively, in order to obtain highly reliable consensus sequences. Data were archived at NCBI Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) under accession SRP002635. ESTs
that did not form contigs (singletons) and contigs resulting from the assembly of multiple sequences are
referred to as unique sequences. These unique
sequences were translated into six reading frames and
used as a query to search the non-redundant protein
databases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the BlastX algorithm
with an E-value ≤10-3 (version # 2.2.15, GenBank release
number #166) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Sequences
with BlastX hits were manually assigned to the following
five sequence categories: known, uncharacterized, predicted, unknown or unnamed, and hypothetical proteins.
This classification was based on the information definition lines in each homologous sequence provided by
NCBI. All unique sequences with BlastX hits (E-value
≤10 -3 ) were functionally annotated using Blast2GO
http://www.blast2go.org/[24] by mapping against gene
ontology (GO) resources.
3. Identification of biomineralization-related proteins in P.
margaritifera mantle EST library

Candidate genes from the biomineralization process were
locally identified in the P. margaritifera mantle ESTs
library using BlastX, according to the following parameters: E-value ≤10 -3 , expect feature set to a default
value of 10, and low-complexity filter determined by the
SEG program [25]. For this purpose, we collected all
available sequences regarding biomineralization in mollusks (bivalvia and gastropoda) from the literature or
from public databases. The Pmarg-Pif nucleotide
sequence was obtained by assembling ESTs with an overlapping identity percentage and minimum overlapping
length parameters set to 100% and 60 bp, respectively.
Motifs and conserved domains of Pmarg-Pif protein
sequence were used as a query to search the non-redundant protein databases available at the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the BlastP
algorithm, according to the following parameters: expect
feature set to a default value of 10, and low-complexity

Page 3 of 13

filter determined by the SEG program [25]. Sequence
alignments were performed using the ClustalW program
setting parameters to default for the gap criterions (gap
open, no gap end, gap extension, gap distance, pairgap),
followed by manual correction with BioEdit software
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html[26].
The presence of signal peptides was inferred using the
SignalP 3.0 server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/[27]. Conserved domains were identified using Prosite http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/[28]. Percentage
identity and biochemical similarity between sequences
were calculated using ProtParam http://www.expasy.ch/
tools/protparam.html[29]. Repeat detection in protein
sequences was performed using RADAR http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/Tools/Radar/index.html[30].
4. In situ hybridization analyses
a) Tissue preparation

P. margaritifera mantle tissues were fixed for 24 h in
Davidson fixative (22% formalin, 33% ethyl alcohol,
11.5% glacial acetic, 33% sterile sea water), embedded
in paraffin wax, and serially sectioned at 7 μm. Sections were collected onto polylysine coated slides
(Silane-prep™, Sigma- Aldrich), dried overnight at 60°C
and treated with proteinase K (10 μg.mL-1) in TE buffer (Tris 50 mM, EDTA 10 mM) at 37°C for 25 min.
Slides were then dehydrated by immersion in an ethanol series and air dried. The sections were prehybridized for 1 h at 42°C with 500 μL hybridization buffer
(4 × SSC, 50% formamide, 1× Denhardt’s solution, 250
μg.mL-1 yeast tRNA, 10% dextran sulfate). The solution
was replaced with 120 μL of the same buffer, containing 6 μL of the digoxigenin-labeled sense or antisense
probes. The slides were incubated overnight at 42°C
for hybridization. The sections were washed twice for
5 min in 2× SSC at room temperature and once for 10
min in 0.4× SSC at 42°C. The detection steps were
performed according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Dig nucleic acid detection kit, Roche Molecular Biomedicals). Slides were finally counter-stained with a
solution of Bismark Brown Yellow and mounted in
Eukitt. The slides were examined using a DM4000B
Leica microscope.
b) Specific probe preparation

In order to synthesize probes for in situ hybridisation,
we used the PeS4 (GACATAGAGAGAGACAGATATGA)/PeAS4 (ATTCACCATTTCCGTTACCGT)
primer set, specific to the pmarg-pearlin ORF (265bp),
and AspF1 (CTCTTACACCAAAATGAAGGGG)/
AspR1 (TCCGTCATCATTATCTGC), specific to the
pmarg-aspein transcript (253 bp). These primers (4 μM
final volume) were used in PCR reactions with the iQ™
Supermix (BIO-RAD) and pmarg-pearlin full-length
cDNA as template. After DNA denaturation at 94°C for

Joubert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:613
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/613

5 min, 35 cycles were run with an MJ-Research thermocycler as follows: 94°C for 30 s; 55°C for 30 s; 72°C for
45 s ended by a final elongation step at 72°C for 10
min. Probes (sense or antisense) were synthesized by
asymmetric PCR (using the same amplification program)
in the presence of Dig-dUTP (0.7 mM), in a PCR reaction mixture containing a unique primer (sense or antisense, 2 μM final volume), 2 μL of the previously
purified PCR fragment (Mini Quick Spin Columns,
Roche Diagnostics), a mix of dGTPs-dCTPs-dATPs (200
μM each final), dTTPs (130 μM final), and Taq polymerase (Promega, 2.5 u). Labelling efficiency was
assayed using the DIG high prime DNA labelling kit
(Roche Diagnostics).
5. Purification and identification of proteins from P.
margaritifera shell

Organic matrix was extracted from fresh shells of
P. margaritifera specimens aged 3-5 years, after acid
acetic decalcification [31]. The acido-insoluble matrix
was digested with trypsin prior to reduction and
alkylation [32]. Samples were injected into a nano
LC-nanoESI-MS/MS system for analysis. Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed using a nanoESI-qQ-TOF,
and data acquired automatically using Analyst QS 1.1
software (Applied Biosystems). A 1 s TOF-MS survey
scan was acquired over 400-1600 amu, followed by
three 3 s product ion scans over a mass range of 652000 amu. The three most intense peptides, with a
charge state of two to four above a 30 count threshold,
were selected for fragmentation and dynamically
excluded for 60 s with ± 50 mmu mass tolerance. The
collision energy was set by the software according to
the charge and mass of the precursor ion. The MS and
MS/MS data were recalibrated using internal reference
ions from a trypsin autolysis peptide at m/z 842.51 [M
+ H]+ and m/z 421.76 [M + 2H]2+. Protein identification was done using the Mascot database-searching
software (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.2.04)
using our database of the pyrosequencing-based EST
mantle library from P. margaritifera. Carbamidomethylation and oxidation were set as fixed and variable
modifications, respectively. The mass tolerance was set
to 0.5 Da and the MS/MS tolerance to 0.2 Da.

Results and Discussion
During recent decades, high-throughput techniques have
been used to examine a broad range of physiological
processes and applications in diverse fields of biology
[33,34]. To examine the biomineralization process in
pearl oyster P. margaritifera, we performed transcriptome pyrosequencing of its calcifying tissue combined
with a proteome analysis of the shell.

1. Transcriptome analysis of P. margaritifera calcifying
mantle
a) Generation of ESTs and contig assembly

We constructed and pyrosequenced a P. margaritifera
mantle cDNA library, resulting in the production of 276
738 sequences of an average size of 234 bp (Table 1).
Sequences in the library ranged from 33 to 406 bp, with
the most abundant group of sequences (70%) in the 225290 bp range and only 3% of the sequences longer than
300 bp. The 276 738 ESTs were assembled into clusters
using TGICL, which gave 19 257 contigs and 57 533 singletons. Our P. margaritifera mantle EST collection thus
contains 76 790 unique sequences (Table 1). The number
of EST sequences generated here using pyrosequencing is
similar to numbers obtained in other transcriptome pyrosequencing based studies [35]. The May 2010 GenBank
release only contained 116 sequences from P. margaritifera including both the “nucleotide” and “EST” sections,
and a total of 15 742 sequences from the genus Pinctada
as a whole. Once released on public databases, the present
76 790 mantle unique sequences will account for 99.8% of
all sequences available for P. margaritifera and 83% of all
sequences available for the genus Pinctada. Pyrosequencing is, therefore, both a rapid and powerful way to dramatically increase transcriptomic resources for non-model
organisms lacking detailed genomic data.
Of the 19 257 contigs, 8717 (45.3%) contained 2 ESTs,
3419 (17.8%) contained 3 ESTs, 1779 (9.2%) contained 4

Joubert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:613
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/613

ESTs, 1119 (5.8%) contained 5 ESTs, and 4223 (21.9%)
contained more than 6 ESTs (Table 1). In our study,
79.2% of the 276 738 ESTs were successfully assembled
and remaining singletons only represented 20.8% of the
reads, and a large part (74.9%) of the 76 790 unique
sequences was singletons. In other recent 454 transcriptome studies, results showed that the remaining singletons represented 10 to 40% of the reads [36,37]. It has
already been observed that many ESTs resulting from
deep sequencing of transcriptomes with 454 sequencing
technology fail to assemble [38]. These unassembled singletons could result from sequencing errors, contaminants from other sources, or can even from technical
difficulties in assembling with overlaps that are too
short in length or which contain highly repeated
sequences. Interestingly, however, these singletons can
also represent rare transcripts of genes expressed at low
levels [39], and therefore constitute an interesting source
of genomic data.
b) Putative identities of ESTs

BlastX searches of the 76 790 unique sequences in the
non-redundant protein databases available at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
revealed 29 479 (38.4%) significant matches (E-value
≤10 -3 ). Among these 29 479 matches, 13 064 (44.3%)
are known proteins, but 6010 are uncharacterized
(20.4%), 4795 are predicted (16.3%), 2880 are either
unknown or unnamed (9.8%), and 2730 are hypothetical
proteins (9.3%) (Table 1). This apparently low rate of
identification is common among mollusk EST databases,
with which rates usually range from 15 to 40%
[15,17,22,40], although this is lower than for vertebrates
[41], or even EST collections from model plants [42].
Although the lack of annotation can result from the
difficulty of annotating some short length sequences, it
can largely be explained by the lack of sequences available for mollusk species, and by the fact that a vast
majority of genes on public databases come from taxa
(in particular vertebrates species) whose amino
acid sequences show great divergence with those of
protostomians.

each of these three ontologies, annotated sequences are
mainly distributed among two or three of the general
term categories. Within the 5976 unique sequences
involved in biological processes, 5006 (83.8%) and 4191
(70.1%) are dedicated to cellular processes and metabolic processes, respectively (Figure 1A). Similarly, in
the molecular functions sub-ontology, 5208 (76.0%) and
3704 (54.0%) of the 6855 unique sequences have binding
and catalytic activity, respectively (Figure 1B). Finally, of
the 5737 unique sequences predicted to be cellular components, 5656 (98.6%) and 3868 (67.4%) are related to
cell and organelle components, respectively (Figure 1C).
These results constitute common features among EST
databases available from marine organisms, and in particular mollusks [40,44].
The distribution of the sequences between specialized
terms in the binding section of the molecular function
category showed that the greatest numbers fell under
protein-binding (35%) and nucleotide-binding (19%).
Interestingly, the third greatest number of the binding
section fell into ion-binding (17%) (Figure 1D). Biomineral crystal matrix macromolecules play a key role in
biologically-controlled biomineralization processes.
In vitro crystallization experiments, microscopic and
analytical methods revealed stereochemical properties of
matrix proteins, which allow them to bind calcium ions
and calcium carbonate, and therefore perform framework building and crystal growth during the construction of the molluskan shell[45-48]. A significant
proportion of sequences in our mantle EST collection
are implicated in binding, and particularly in ion binding. This result is consistent with observations from a
previous study performed on the calcifying mantle of
the bivalve L. elliptica [22]. We therefore hypothesize
that this classification could be a pattern typical of tissues of a secretory nature implicated in biomineralization processes.

c) Functional Gene Ontology annotation

2. Identification of transcripts encoding proteins involved
in the biomineralization process of P. margaritifera
a) Identification of a catalogue of 82 proteins potentially
involved in the biomineralization process

Gene Ontology (GO) assignment was carried out on
unique sequences in order to categorize transcripts from
P. margaritifera mantle by putative function. The GO
project provides a structured and controlled vocabulary
of terms (ontologies) for describing gene product characteristics and gene product annotation data [43]. In our
study, 10 004 unique sequences (13.0%) were successfully assigned to one or more GO terms. Among these,
following the functional classification with the three
unrelated GO ontologies, 5976 (59.7%) are involved in
biological processes, 6855 (68.5%) have molecular functions and 5737 (57.3%) are cellular components. For

To obtain an integrated view of the transcriptional
events of the biomineralization process in P. margaritifera mantle, we made BlastX searches with our EST
mantle library focusing on proteins known to be
involved in these mechanisms. For this purpose, we first
collected all available sequences regarding biomineralization in calcifying invertebrates from the literature or
from public databases. In mollusks, we found 140
bivalve and 103 gastropod proteins potentially implicated in biomineralization processes. These 243 molluskan sequences were isolated from shell or mantle tissue
in previous studies, using either biochemical or

molecular biology approaches. BlastX searches of the
140 bivalves and 103 gastropods proteins in our EST
database revealed 121 and 56 significant matches (Evalue ≤10-3), respectively. Analyzing these 177 sequences
together with sequences from our EST library, we identified 82 P. margaritifera non-redundant unique
sequences potentially implicated in the biomineralization
process. Among these, 69 and 13 sequences could be
recovered by homology with sequences from bivalve and
gastropod, respectively.
Among the 69 unique P. margaritifera transcripts
that were recovered by homology with the bivalve
sequences, 55 sequences were obtained by homology
with sequences from the Pinctada genus (Additional file
1). The overall identity percentage between P. margaritifera protein sequences potentially implicated in the biomineralization process and protein sequences from the
Pinctada genus is ranging from 24% (C-type lectin 2
from P. fucata) to 95% (Ferritin-like protein from P.
fucata). This level of identity is similar to percentages
already observed for homolog proteins from the N66/
Nacrein and N14/N16 families [49-51]. The N66
sequence from P. maxima and Nacrein sequence from

P. fucata (P. maxima N44 homolog sequence) displayed
identity percentages of 82% and 69%, respectively, with
P. margaritifera homolog sequence. Similarly, the N14
sequence from P. maxima and N16 sequence from
P. fucata displayed an identity percentage of 93% and
71% respectively with P. margaritifera homolog
sequence, Perline matrix protein. Considering all
sequences from the Pinctada genus, the identity percentage seems to be higher between P. margaritifera and P.
maxima sequences than between P. margaritifera and P.
fucata sequences.
Extending our analysis to biomineralization proteins
from other bivalves led us to the identification of the 14
remaining sequences out of the 69 unique P. margaritifera transcripts that were recovered by homology with
the bivalve sequences (Additional file 1). The overall
identity percentage between P. margaritifera protein
sequences potentially implicated in the biomineralization
process and protein sequences from the other bivalves
ranges from 28% (EP protein precursor from Mytilus
edulis) to 58% (bone morphogenic protein type 2 receptor from Crassostrea gigas). This level of identity is
lower than that observed between proteins within the

Joubert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:613
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/613

Pinctada genus, except for proteins implicated in calcium regulation or signal transduction. For example,
Calmodulin sequences from Hyriopsis schlegelii (genbank accession number: ACI22622) displayed an identity
percentage of 99% with the P. margaritifera homolog
sequence.
Finally, we identified 13 P. margaritifera unique
sequences by homology with sequences of gastropod
(Additional file 1). The overall identity percentage
between P. margaritifera protein sequences potentially
implicated in the biomineralization process and protein
sequences from gastropods ranged from 27% (Veliger
mantle 1 from H. asinina) to 100% (Calmodulin from
Conus cuneolus). Interestingly, some sequences homologous to abalone (H. laevigata) proteins could be found
in our EST database, namely Perlucin [52,53], Perlustrin
[53,54] and Perlawpin [55] from Haliotis laevigata. Perlucin, Perlustrin and Perlwapin sequences were obtained
by direct protein sequencing of proteins purified from
the nacreous layer of abalone shell. All of the P. margaritifera homolog sequences for each of these 3 proteins
found in the P. margaritifera EST library display the
same motif and numerous conserved cystein positions
as in the sequences from H. laevigata. Perlucin is a 155amino acid protein which exhibits similarities with calcium dependent lectins (C-type). The P. margaritifera
homolog sequence for Perlucin (Pmarg-perlucin) is not
a complete sequence. However, of the 6 cysteins present
in the abalone sequence, 3 are conserved between
Pmarg-perlucin and Perlucin sequences. Moreover,
Pmarg-perlucin displays an E-value of 9.00E-9 and an
identity percentage of 38% (27/71 a.a.) with Perlucin
and also has a C-type lectin domain. Perlustrin is a
small protein (84 a.a.) with similarities to vertebrate
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGF-BP)
sequences. The P. margaritifera homolog sequence for
Perlustrin (Pmarg-perlustrin) is a complete 142-amino
acid sequence with an E-value of 7.00E-6, and 39% (25/
64 a.a.) identity with Perlustrin; it also exhibits a insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs). On the
12 cysteins scattered across the Perlustrin sequence, 11
(of the 14 cysteins of Pmarg-perlustrin) are conserved
between Pmarg-perlustrin and the Perlustrin sequences.
Finally, the Perlwapin protein consists of 134 amino
acids that contain 3 repeats of 40 amino acids very similar to the well-known whey acidic protein (WAP)
domains. The P. margaritifera homolog sequence for
Perlwapin (Pmarg-perlwapin) is a complete 139-amino
acid (a.a.) sequence with an E-value of 2.00E-11, 37%
identity (40/107 a.a.) with Perlwapin, and two WAP
domains. Out of the 25 cysteins spread along the Perlwapin sequence, all 14 cysteins of Pmarg-perlwapin are
conserved between the Pmarg-perlwapin and Perlwapin
sequences. These results would suggest that Perlucin,

Page 7 of 13

Perlustrin and Perlwapin are present in P. margaritifera.
Previous studies have shown that there are significant
differences in the molecular mechanisms in different
mineralizing species and, therefore, between the proteins
they use. Such differences may even exist among species
that are phylogenetically very close, like the Mollusca.
The cause of this “evolvability” remains a controversy,
and it is still uncertain whether the biomineralization
“molecular tool box” required for shell construction is
inherited from an ancestral function, or whether this
ability is the result of an adaptive convergence. Recent
studies have explicitly demonstrated that shell or skeletal proteins had evolved independently among metazoans [8,21,56]. However, the identification of homolog
proteins between bivalvia and gastropoda could support
the idea that at least some of the shell component could
have appeared early in the evolution of the molluscan
phylum.
Taken together, this candidate approach allowed us to
isolate 82 unique sequences potentially implicated in the
biomineralization process in P. margaritifera. This study
considerably increases the amount of transcriptomic
data available in this field, making P. margaritifera the
best documented marine protostomian with regard to
biomineralization.
b) Identification of proteins from the “chitin-silk fibroin gelacidic macromolecule” model

Mollusk shell construction is the result of biologicallycontrolled mineralization, a highly dynamic process
mediated by an extracellular organic matrix secreted by
the mantle epithelium [3]. Histochemical studies and
ultrastructural observations of the shell, together with
biochemical analysis of the extracellular organic matrix,
provided a better understanding of shell structure and
led to the identification of proteins composing it,
thereby allowing mollusk shell biomineralization models
to be developed. The currently accepted “chitin-silk
fibroin gel-acidic macromolecule” model involves the
major matrix components of the shell, i.e. relatively
hydrophobic silk proteins plus a complex assemblage of
hydrophilic proteins (many of which are unusually rich
in aspartic acid), highly structured in a polysaccharide
b-chitinous framework [6].
In our study, beyond the consideration of protein
homologies between species, it is interesting to note
that our P. margaritifera EST mantle library includes
sequences coding for proteinaceous components of the
matrix following this model. Firstly, a sequence showing
78% identity with MSI60 from the silk fibroin matrix
component could be retrieved. MSI60 is an insoluble
framework protein purified from the nacreous layer of
the shell [57] and expressed in the more dorsal region
of the mantle [58]. Poly-Ala and poly-Gly blocks conferring MSI60 homologies with spider silk fibroins are

Joubert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:613
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/613

present in the P. margaritifera homologous sequence.
MSI31 [57] and Shematrins [59], displaying silk/fibroinlike domains, could be also retrieved. Secondly, a
sequence showing 87% identity with the unusually acidic
protein Aspein from P. fucata could be recovered in the
EST database from P. margaritifera [60]. This sequence
homologous to Aspein is the first extremely acidic shell
protein identified in P. margaritifera. In P. fucata,
Aspein is specifically expressed in the mantle region,
which secretes the calcite prism matrix [58]. The main
body of this protein includes a high proportion of Asp
(60.4%) punctuated with Ser-Gly dipeptides, which are
conserved in the P. margaritifera homologous sequence.
Finally, recent electron microscopy studies on nacre
have detected the presence of chitin in the shell of
P. margaritifera [61], and chitin synthase gene has been
cloned from P. fucata [62], Atrina rigida and Mytilus
galloprovincialis [63]. A P. margaritifera homolog
sequence of chitin synthase from this species could be
retrieved, revealing that chitin synthase sequences are
well conserved among bivalves. More precisely, the
chitin synthase sequences from Atrina rigida and Mytillus galloprovincialis displayed identity percentages of
91% and 84%, respectively, with the homologous P. margaritifera sequence.
Taken together, searches realized on the EST mantle
library allowed us to identify proteinaceous components
of the calcifying matrix from P. margaritifera. These
results demonstrate how EST-based studies are a powerful way of dramatically increasing knowledge about proteins implicated in the biomineralization process, which
constitutes an important prerequisite for establishing
relevant biomineralization models.
c) Pmarg-Pif encodes an homolog of Pif-177 from P. fucata,
a protein involved in nacre formation

Pif-177 is an acidic matrix protein that was identified in
P. fucata nacre shell and is known to specifically bind to
aragonite crystals. Results from immunolocalization,
RNA interference and in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization strongly indicate that Pif-177 regulates nacre
formation; making Pif-177 the first mineralization protein in this species whose function was identified in vivo
[64]. A Pif-177 homolog, which we named Pmarg-Pif,
was identified in the P. margaritifera mantle EST library
using BlastX. A comparison between Pmarg-Pif and Pif177 protein structures is shown in figure 2A. A consensus furin cleavage site at position 555-558 (RIKR) was
identified in the Pmarg-Pif sequence. In P. fucata, a
similar furin-cleavage domain, observed between amino
acid positions 544-547 (RMKR) is required for Pif-177
cleavage into Pif-80 and Pif-97. This suggests that, as
with Pif-177, Pmarg-Pif cDNA is very likely to encode a
precursor protein that will be post-translationally
cleaved to produce Pif-97 and Pif-80 homologs (which

Page 8 of 13

we named Pmarg-Pif-97 and Pmarg-Pif-80, respectively).
Alignments of P. fucata and P. margaritifera Pif
sequences revealed 83.0% of identity between Pif-97 and
Pmarg-Pif-97 domains, and 60.0% identity between Pif80 and Pmarg-Pif-80. Like Pif-97 and Pif-80, Pmarg-Pif97 and Pmarg-Pif-80 are acidic proteins. Pmarg-Pif-97
consists of 536 amino acid residues, including a high
proportion of charged amino acid residues, Asp (15.3%),
Glu (7.1%), Lys (10.3%), and Arg (6.0%), with a calculated isoelectric point (pI) value of 4.7. This sequence
contains two conserved domains: a von Willebrand type
A (VWA) domain and a chitin-binding domain, similar
to those in Pif-97 (figure 2B). There are also 22 Cys
residues, of which 21 are conserved between the two
homologs. Pmarg-Pif-80 consists of 456 amino acid residues, and also contains a high proportion of charged
amino acid residues, Asp (26.1%), Glu (5.0%), Lys
(16.2%), and Arg (11.6%), with a calculated isoelectric
point (pI) value of 5.13. Pmarg-Pif-80, like Pif-80, displays a high Asp ratio and may, therefore, be involved
in aragonite-binding processes, since Pif-80 was shown
to bind aragonite crystals and Pif-177 to be implicated
in the regulation of nacre formation. A cluster of acidic
amino acid residues is also present near the center of
the molecule, but this shows a higher number of Asp
residues (14) in Pmarg-Pif-80 than in Pif-80 (10). Only 9
repeats of the four-amino-acid motif (DD-R/K-R/K)
could be found before the cluster of acidic amino acid
residues in Pmarg-Pif-80, whereas 17 are found scattered throughout Pif-80 sequence, and only three of
these are conserved in the same position between the
two sequences. Interestingly, an 18 amino acid residue
sequence (LVKEIERRKSDDK-K/I-S-F/L-DD) is repeated
three times (742-816) in the Pmarg-Pif-80 sequence.
This highly charged amino acid sequence could not be
retrieved in the Pif-80 sequence, and BlastP results
showed no homology with any other protein in the public database. Considering that this consensus sequence is
localized in a protein sequence suspected to play a role
in aragonite binding in P. fucata, it potentially constitutes an interesting new motif with regard to biomineralization processes.
Taken together, the numerous conserved sequence
motifs, conserved cystein residue positions, charged amino
acid residue composition and common isoelectric properties between Pmarg-Pif-97 and Pif-97 support the hypothesis that Pmarg-Pif might have a similar activity to Pif-177,
and regulate nacre formation in P. margaritifera. However,
the presence of the repeated 18 amino acid residues
sequence specific to Pmarg-Pif-80 and the distinct number
of repeats of the four-amino-acid motif (DD-R/K-R/K)
between Pmarg-Pif-80 and Pif-80 also suggest that PmargPif-80 might have a function specific to P. margaritifera.
Considering these features, further research needs to be

undertaken in order to investigate Pmarg-Pif function and
its role in the biomineralization process.
3. Expression pattern of biomineralization-related protein
transcripts

In order to focus on biomineralization processes, transcript localization was performed using isolated transcripts from the P. margaritifera EST library. We
selected two highly documented proteins implicated in
biomineralization in the Pinctada genus: the Aspein and
N14/N16/Pearlin families. In adult oysters, the tissue
responsible for shell mineralization is the mantle outer
epithelium. This mantle can be divided into several
regions from the more proximal (dorsal) zone to the
more distal (ventral to mantle edge) zone. Studies have
shown that this zonation can be associated with distinct
gene expression patterns, suggesting a functional partition following the dorso-ventral axis, which might be
involved in production of specific calcium carbonate
polymorphs [57,65]. Our in situ analysis revealed that
these transcripts were specifically localized in the outer
epithelium of the mantle known to be bearing mineralizing cells (figure 3). More interestingly, these transcripts
were localized in two distinct areas of the outer epithelium, the dorsal zone for pmarg-pearlin and the ventral

Page 10 of 13

zone for pmarg-aspein. Aspein and pearlin genes are
known to produce proteins specific to the nacre and prismatic layers of the shell, respectively [49,58,60,66]. Our
observations confirm the functional subdivision within
the pearl oyster mantle outer epithelium, pmarg-pearlin
transcripts being specific to aragonitic nacre-forming
cells and pmarg-aspein transcripts being specific to calcitic prism-forming cells.
4. Mantle transcripts encode proteins identified in P.
margaritifera shell

Using the P. margaritifera EST mantle library, identification of shell matrix proteins was attempted by a complementary proteomic approach. The shell matrix
proteins, extracted from decalcified shell powder, were
digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were
analysed by MS/MS mode mass spectrometry. The raw
MS/MS data were directly interrogated against the EST
data set using Mascot software. After careful observation
of the MS/MS data on the 50 first most intensive peptides, we estimated that almost all the main peptides
analysed led to contig identification. We only considered
matching proteins that presented at least 2 unambiguously identified peptides, i.e. those presenting individual
scores superior to the threshold (calculated value of 32).

Figure 3 Localization of pmarg-pearlin and pmarg-aspein gene transcripts in P. margaritifera mantle tissue by in situ hybridization.
Paraffin-embedded sections of oyster tissues were hybridized with antisense or sense single stranded cDNA probes labeled with digoxigenin
and revealed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies. Positive cells are stained in dark blue, sense probes showed no hybridization
(data not shown). Stained cells enlargements are shown in A and B insets where scale bars are indicated. The expression partition limit is
symbolized by a *. if: inner fold; mf: middle fold; of: outer fold; pg: periostracal groove; oe: outer epithelium; ie: inner epithelium; oec: outer

The trypsin-digest peptides were separated on nano-LC, prior to nanoESI-qQ-TOF analysis. The MS/MS spectra were used for searching against the
pyrosequencing based EST mantle library with Mascot software. We only considered proteins that presented at least 2 matching peptides. Mascot protein scores
are indicated together with the number of unique peptides that matched to the sequence. The homologies were determined by BlastP interrogations against
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database (January 2010) using the UniProt on-line tool http://www.uniprot.org, setting parameters to default. We only show here
the best matches for the contigs which protein sequences are the homologues of already known mollusk shell proteins. We notice that all matches are from
Pinctada genus origin.
* indicates proteins which the occurrence in shell matrix was previously demonstrated by direct biochemical characterization.

This shotgun proteomic approach allowed us to identify more than 30 contigs, but only 13 proteins presented homologies to previously characterized mollusk
shell proteins (Table 2). This list of proteins contains
almost all of the shell proteins previously described
before from shell matrix protein analysis of the Pinctada
genus. [8]. Among them, PFMG10, Linkine, MPN88 and
KRMPs were only characterized at the transcriptional
level until now, and direct evidence of their implication
in shell biomineralization process was lacking. Our data
shows that they are definitely part of the calcifying
matrix, which is embedded within the biomineral structures in the shell of P. margaritifera. We noticed that
the few missing matches from the list of the biomineralization-related protein of the Pinctada genus. [8] Aspein, MSI7 and Prisilkin-39 - exhibit sequences that
are remarkably deficient in trypsin cleavage sites, making them unsuitable for standard proteomic detection.
However, it is worth noting that homologs of the latter
proteins are observed in the EST mantle library (Additional file 1).
Our proteomic analysis enabled us to retrieve in silico
all the sequences from P. margaritifera involved in the
biomineralization process already published on databases in our peptide library, and we were also able to

find a match in our database for all proteins experimentally found from P. margaritifera shell in our EST
library. These results demonstrate that our EST data set
covers most of the diversity of the matrix protein of the
P. margaritifera shell.

Conclusion
This global approach combining transcriptome and
proteome analysis of P. margaritifera calcifying mantle
and shell is the first description of a pyrosequencing
program performed on a pearl-producing bivalve species. It led to the functional analysis of 276 738 EST
sequences, with the constitution of a P. margaritifera
mantle transcripts catalog of 82 sequences potentially
implicated in the biomineralization process. Our
results showed that the biomineralization protein
repertoire is conserved within pearl oysters, but also
provided direct evidence that our EST data set covered
most of the diversity of P. margaritifera shell matrix
protein. These observations clearly demonstrate the
high efficiency of this pyrosequencing-based EST
library in accurately identifying shell proteins, in combination with shotgun proteomic analysis and automated database searches. These data represent the
most comprehensive list of biomineralization-related

Joubert et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:613

sequences available among protostomian species, and
represent a major breakthrough in the field of molluskan biomineralization.
