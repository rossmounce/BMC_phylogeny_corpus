Abiotrophia defectiva knee prosthesis infection:
A case report
Nadim Cassir1, Jean-Charles Grillo2, Jean-Noël Argenson2, Michel Drancourt1* and Pierre-Yves Levy1

Abstract
Background: Abiotrophia species have rarely been implicated in osteoarticular infections. We report one case of an
A. defectiva knee prosthesis infection.
Case presentation: A 71-year-old man of Italian origin presented with pain and swelling of the knee four years
after the implantation of a total knee replacement prosthesis. While standard culturing of the synovial fluid resulted
in no isolation of microorganisms, the direct inoculation of the synovial fluid into a rich culture medium resulted in
the identification of A. defectiva by polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Repeated attempts of culturing
microorganisms from blood were negative, and echocardiograms and colonoscopies were unremarkable. Highdose amoxicillin for nine months and a two-stage replacement of the knee prosthesis led to full patient recovery
by the time of the 12-month follow-up examination.
Conclusions: Because Abiotrophia spp. are fastidious microorganisms, it is likely that cases of Abiotrophia
orthopedic infection are misdiagnosed as culture-negative infections. Direct inoculation of synovial fluids into rich
broth medium and further polymerase chain reaction-based detection of culture-negative synovial fluids are key
tests for accurate documentation and detection of these infections.

Background
Abiotrophia organisms are nutritionally variant streptococci that form part of the commensal flora of the oral
and intestinal mucosae [1]. The detection and identification of Abiotrophia organisms may be hampered by
their inability to grow in standard media and their
microscopic pleomorphism [1]. Abiotrophia organisms
have been grouped into a unique genus separated from
the Streptococcus genus based on genetic and phylogenetic analyses, which revealed a low relatedness to other
Streptococcus organisms [2,3]. Abiotrophia organisms
cause bacteremia and an estimated 4-6% of all cases of
streptococcal endocarditis [2,4]. However, these organisms have rarely been implicated as the causative agents
of osteoarticular infections. Indeed, only four cases of
orthopedic infections caused by A. defectiva have been
published. These cases include two instances of septic
arthritis, one case of discitis and sacroiliitis and one case

of total knee arthroplasty infection [5-8] (Table 1). Here,
we report on a fifth case of A. defectiva osteoarticular
infection through the isolation of the organism and the
direct detection of A. defectiva-specific DNA sequences
through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection in
the synovial fluid.

Case presentation
A 71-year-old man of Italian origin was admitted to
our infectious orthopedic department presenting with
chronic (two-year) left knee pain, swelling and decreasing ambulation. He had received a total knee prosthesis for left knee osteoarthritis four years prior. The
prosthesis had been replaced twice for radiologically
confirmed loosening, with the latest replacement being
two years prior to admittance. Cultures of synovial
fluid collected during both replacements remained
sterile after inoculation of standard solid media. Our
patient underwent a dental treatment without antibiotic prophylaxis three weeks before the consultation.
Upon physical examination, our patient was found to
be apyretic. His left knee was swollen and radiating
heat, and a moderately sized effusion was present. His

white blood cell count indicated 3.82 × 103 polymorphonuclear cells/mL, his C-reactive protein (CRP) level
was 32 mg/L and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) was 66 mm (first hour). Our patient was referred
to the orthopedic department for sample biopsy and
arthroscopic lavage. The synovial fluid was directly
inoculated into a set of Bactec Plus Aerobic/F and Bactec Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F bottles (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) and collected in parallel into
a sterile tube as part of an “arthritis kit”, as previously
described [9]. Microscopic examination of the synovial
fluid indicated 32 × 10 3 white blood cells/mL (98%
neutrophil polymorphonuclear cells and 2% monocytes) and 4.77 × 103 red blood cells/mL without crystals. No microorganisms were observed. Inoculation of
the synovial fluid onto 5% sheep-blood agar showed no
growth after a five-day incubation period at 37°C
under a 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) atmosphere. However, the aerobic broth bottle produced Gram-positive
cocci after a five-day incubation period at 37°C under
continuous automated monitoring for bacterial growth
in the medium. Subculturing these organisms on 5%
sheep-blood agar and chocolate agar (BioMérieux,
Marcy l’Etoile, France) at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere produced colonies. These colonies were identified as A. defectiva by 16S rDNA sequencing [10]
(99.9% sequence similarity with the GenBank accession
number AY879308); E test testing confirmed the isolate to be broadly susceptible with minimum inhibitory
concentration of 0.01 mg/L for penicillin G and rifampicin, 0.016 mg/L for amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and vancomycin, 0.02 mg/L for imipenem, 0.1 mg/L for
erythromycin and 0.2 mg/L for doxycycline [11]. PCR-

based detection of bacterial DNA using universal 16S
rDNA primers [10] detected A. defectiva DNA in the
synovial fluid on the basis of sequence identity to the
DNA recovered from the colonies. Three blood cultures incubated under an aerobic atmosphere and one
blood culture incubated under an anaerobic atmosphere showed no growth after a five-day incubation
period. A transthoracic echocardiography revealed no
signs of endocarditis and a colonoscopy was unremarkable. The knee prosthesis was removed, and a temporary cement spacer containing 2 g vancomycin and 40 g
cement was inserted [12]. Re-implantation of a total
knee was delayed because of an intercurrent venal
thrombosis without pulmonary embolism. Our patient
received 100 mg/kg/day oral amoxicillin for nine
months. The knee pain and swelling subsequently
resolved, and the ESR decreased to 22 mm. The oneyear follow-up examination indicated complete wound
healing, with no evidence of a recurrence of infection,
a white blood cell count within the normal range, a
CRP value of 7.1 mg/L and an ESR of 17 mm.

Discussion
In our patient, A. defectiva knee prosthesis infection was
documented by the isolation and culture of the organism from a synovial fluid recovered under sterile procedures and the parallel detection of A. defectiva DNA
from this specimen. Although only one joint fluid specimen was available for microbiological investigations, no
other detection of A. defectiva had been made in our
laboratory within the eight-week period preceding isolation of the A. defectiva strain here reported. Thus,
laboratory contamination is unlikely.

The reported A. defectiva isolate was recovered after
the direct inoculation of the synovial fluid into a culture
broth as part of our protocol for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection using an “arthritis kit” procedure.
The arthritis kit contains one Bactec Plus Aerobic/F and
one Bactec Plus Anaerobic/F for culturing bacteria, one
sterile tube for culturing mycoplasma, spirochetes and
16S rRNA-based PCR and one sterile tube for culturing
and PCR-based detection of virus, in addition to the
informed consent form and laboratory forms. The parallel inoculation of this same fluid specimen onto agar
media failed to culture the organism. This illustrates the
well-known fastidious nature of A. defectiva and indicates that the direct inoculation of the synovial fluid
into broth is mandatory for the culture-based diagnosis
of A. defectiva articular infections. The same holds true
for the culture-based diagnosis of arthritis caused by
Kingella kingae in children [13].
In this patient, the A. defectiva infection was documented shortly after a dental procedure without antibiotic prophylaxis. However, this dental procedure was
most likely not the portal of entry for A. defectiva, as
our patient had presented clinical signs of knee prosthesis infection long before the dental procedure. A prospective case-control study indicated that dental
procedures were not risk factors for orthopedic prosthetic infection [14]. Indeed, antibiotic prophylaxis before
dental interventions in patients with knee arthroplasty
lacks evidence-based recommendations [15].
Our patient had a history of repeated early prosthesis
loosening, a situation evocative of chronic infection of
the prosthesis [16,17]. Tentative documentations
remained negative, but these diagnoses lacked direct
inoculation of the synovial fluid into broth and molecular detection. Therefore, the loosening episodes of the
two prostheses may have been due to a chronic A. defectiva infection.
The fastidious nature of A. defectiva may explain the
rarity of A. defectiva orthopedic infections, and cases of
Abiotrophia infection may be misdiagnosed as culturenegative infections. Accordingly, the role of Abiotrophia
organisms in osteoarticular infections may be underestimated. A review of the literature indicates that only one
case of an orthopedic prosthesis Abiotrophia infection
has been published, and A. defectiva joint infection has
been reported in only four cases (Table 1).

Conclusion
In conclusion, this case illustrates the effectiveness of
the “arthritis kit” procedure. By incorporating a systematic direct inoculation of the synovial fluid into broth
along with a parallel PCR-based detection of fastidious
microorganisms, the diagnosis of orthopedic prosthesis

infections, such as those caused by Abiotrophia spp.,
can be optimized.
