A specialist-generalist classification of the arable
flora and its response to changes in agricultural
practices
Guillaume Fried1,2, Sandrine Petit1, Xavier Reboud1*

Abstract
Background: Theory in ecology points out the potential link between the degree of specialisation of organisms
and their responses to disturbances and suggests that this could be a key element for understanding the assembly
of communities. We evaluated this question for the arable weed flora as this group has scarcely been the focus of
ecological studies so far and because weeds are restricted to habitats characterised by very high degrees of
disturbance. As such, weeds offer a case study to ask how specialization relates to abundance and distribution of
species in relation to the varying disturbance regimes occurring in arable crops.
Results: We used data derived from an extensive national monitoring network of approximately 700 arable fields
scattered across France to quantify the degree of specialisation of 152 weed species using six different ecological
methods. We then explored the impact of the level of disturbance occurring in arable fields by comparing the
degree of specialisation of weed communities in contrasting field situations.
The classification of species as specialist or generalist was consistent between different ecological indices. When
applied on a large-scale data set across France, this classification highlighted that monoculture harbour significantly
more specialists than crop rotations, suggesting that crop rotation increases abundance of generalist species rather
than sets of species that are each specialised to the individual crop types grown in the rotation. Applied to a diachronic dataset, the classification also shows that the proportion of specialist weed species has significantly
decreased in cultivated fields over the last 30 years which suggests a biotic homogenization of agricultural
landscapes.
Conclusions: This study shows that the concept of generalist/specialist species is particularly relevant to
understand the effect of anthropogenic disturbances on the evolution of plant community composition and that
ecological theories developed in stable environments are valid in highly disturbed environments such as agroecosystems. The approach developed here to classify arable weeds according to the breadth of their ecological
niche is robust and applicable to a wide range of organisms. It is also sensitive to disturbance regime and we
show here that recent changes in agricultural practices, i.e. increased levels of disturbance have favoured the most
generalist species, hence leading to biotic homogenisation in arable landscapes.

Background
The concept of ecological niche as a hypothetical multidimensional space [1] has boosted the exploration of
niche properties [2-4] and has enabled generalist and
specialist species to be distinguished according to their
respective niche breadth. Theoretical studies have tried
to evaluate the origins and/or the consequences of niche* Correspondence: reboud@dijon.inra.fr

breadth differences among species. The “jack-of-alltrades is master of none” hypothesis states that the existence of generalist versus specialist species is the result of
an evolutionary trade-off between the ability of species to
use an extended range of resources and their capacity to
exploit each one with a level of performance above those
of competing species [5-8]. This trade-off has been associated with several life-history traits: generalist species
are supposed to maintain higher dispersal abilities [9,10]
and to cope more easily with environmental stochasticity

[11] while, conversely, specialists would be strongly
shaped by intra-specific competition [12]. The generalistspecialist concept could thus be appropriate to find community assembly rules [13], in particular in habitats
where communities are subjected to varying levels of
disturbance. The distinction between generalist and
specialist species can pinpoint general mechanisms of
species filtering, similarly to approaches using species
traits rather than the species themselves. Indeed, several
authors have recently focused on the processes leading to
the replacement of many specialist species by a few generalist species that take place in diverse phylogenetic
groups such as fish [14], bird [15] or plant assemblages
[16]. In parallel to species extinction, this so called ‘biotic
homogenization’ process would characterize the next biodiversity crisis [17].
The weed communities of arable land provide an
interesting model for exploring the generalist/specialist
concept because the arable field habitat is characterized
by an intense disturbance regime and by varying ecological conditions, both within a year (because of management practices) and across years (because of crop
rotation). Compared to other vascular plants occurring
in more stable habitats, one would expect arable weeds
to be generalist species. Indeed, it has been hypothesized
that “under a constant environment or slow environmental changes, inter-specific competition involves local
processes that favour specialist species at the expense of
generalist species, while under moderate to high rates of
environmental change, local population dynamics
increasingly favour high immigration rates of the generalist over the local competitive ability of the specialist”
[18]. However, arable fields can also be viewed as a particular habitat harbouring a set of specialized species
(i.e. arable weeds) adapted to frequent but also specific
disturbances. Within a year, agricultural practices can be
perceived as highly specialized with the single aim of
favouring a particular species, i.e. the crop, so that all
species in the seed bank sharing the same requirements
might well find regularly optimal conditions for completing their life cycle. Large differences between habitat
breadth of weed species are observed with some species
confined to arable fields in Western Europe (e.g., weeds
of winter cereal fields: Agrostemma githago, Bupleurum
rotundifolium, etc.) while others are able to grow both
in crops and in other less disturbed habitats (e.g.,
Galium aparine, Lapsana communis). Even within arable fields, differences can be observed in niche position
and breadth between weeds that are specialized to a particular crop type or to particular soil conditions, and
weeds that are present almost everywhere [19,20].
Finally, even if arable fields are characterized by stochastic conditions, a specialized species could persist temporally, for example, with dormant diaspores that would

Page 2 of 11

wait for optimal environmental conditions e.g., high
relative summer air humidity for arable bryophyte species [21] or each time a favourable crop occurs in the
rotation [22]. Therefore, even though most agroecosystems experience high levels of disturbance, it is not
clear whether the current arable weed flora is dominated
by specialist or by generalist species and what would be
the resulting variation in ecosystem function [23]. The
present paper addresses this question and classifies the
French arable weed flora along a specialist-generalist
gradient, using vegetation records from a national monitoring network for applying and comparing six different
specialisation indices available in the ecological literature. It should be noted here that what is meant by generalist species are species able to exploit many or all the
niches within the “arable field” habitat regardless of
their ability to occupy other habitats.
A second set of questions relates to possible relationships between the degree of specialisation of weed communities and disturbance regime that are related to the
choice of contrasted agricultural management options.
In this paper, we focus on two sets of situations that
result in different levels and regime of disturbance.
The first situation compares the weed flora in maize
cultivated as a monoculture and in a crop rotation.
Monoculture means here that the same crop species is
cultivated for several consecutive years. Crop rotation
means that each year a different crop species is cultivated. Crop rotation induces disturbances that vary with
the crop grown each year (planting or maturation dates,
growth habit, competitive ability, associated cultural
practices, fertiliser requirements and more or less specific herbicides) while the disturbance regime is constant
in monocultures. While many recent studies focused on
the impact of crop rotation on weed diversity [24-26],
the present study aimed to quantify the functional shift
in weed composition. There could be two alternative
responses of weed communities to crop rotation (i) crop
rotation could either favour generalist species and
monoculture specialist species, or, (ii) crop rotation
could favour specialist species of each crop (i.e., species
that are associated with conditions of a particular crop),
so that weed communities would mainly be composed
of specialist species alternating each year, persisting
within the seed bank during the unfavourable years.
The second situation analyses the shift in weed communities that has taken place in the same arable fields
between the 1970 s and the 2000 s. It is here assumed
that the level of disturbance has significantly increased
with agriculture intensification (i.e., increasing number
of herbicide treatments, increasing depth and frequency
of tillage, see [27]) between the two surveys. Increased
N-fertilization and systematic liming or drainage have
homogenized soil conditions across the sampled fields.

In addition, recurrent changes in cultivation techniques
since the 1970 s (tillage or no-tillage systems, new herbicides) are likely to have translated into continuous
environmental changes for the arable flora. These
changes may have hampered specialist species and/or
favoured generalist weed species.

Results
Classification of weed species along the gradient of
specialization

In total, 152 weed species were frequent enough to estimate their degree of specialisation (IS) with six different
indices (See additional file 1: Classification of arable
weed species according to their niche breadth). Each
pair of indices were significantly correlated (Table 1).
The I S values varied from 15 for Stellaria media, the
most generalist species, to 145 for Arenaria serpyllifolia,
the most specialist species (Fig. 1). The segregation of
the values of I S in three classes of equal size (n = 38
species) enabled us to distinguish the most generalist
species, from I S = 15 to I S = 53, intermediate species
from IS = 54 to IS = 92 and the most specialist species,
from IS = 93 to IS = 145. At the level of communities,
the ICS values (i.e., the mean IS of the species present in
the community) follow a normal distribution and varied
from 14.33 to 102.58 (Fig. 2).
IS was negatively correlated with the frequency of occurrence of the species (r= -0.547; P < 0.001) but not significantly with their abundance (r = -0.132; P = 0.110)
(Fig. 3). With the exception of Raphanus raphanistrum
at 25% of its actual frequency, all six indices classified
the species as generalists with very similar positions
regardless of their rarefied frequency (Fig. 1).
The most generalist species (e.g. Stellaria media, Senecio vulgaris, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Anagallis arvensis)
were found on a large range of soil types, climates, crop
types and cropping techniques. In fact these species are
found all over Western Europe [28], and even in other
temperate countries such as Canada. At the opposite

extreme, the most specialist species were weed species
that all seemed highly specialized on at least two important axes of their n-dimensional niche, e.g., Rumex acetosella was only found in winter crops exhibiting very
acidic and sandy soil conditions, while Phalaris paradoxa was only observed under rather oceanic climate,
heavy clay and wet soil conditions. At an intermediary
level, some species were specialized on one important
axis of their niche while being present on a broader
range of ecological conditions on other axes. For example, Papaver rhoeas or Veronica hederifolia were associated with a particular crop type (winter cereals) but
were present on a large range of soil and climatic conditions while Juncus bufonius was strictly limited to acid
and silty soils but was found in various crop types.
Effect of monoculture versus crop rotation

The comparison of maize weed communities in crop
rotation versus monoculture showed similar field species
richness or abundance (Table 2) while the average specialization index (ICS) indicated different species composition (Fig. 2). More generalist species were observed in
fields with maize-wheat rotations (I CS = 62 +/- 2),
whereas maize monocultures contained more specialist
species (ICS = 69 +/-1, Wilcoxon test, P < 0.01). This
was mainly due to the high proportion of generalist species when maize is grown in crop rotation (Table 2).
The generalist Chenopodium album was the dominant
species in both monoculture and crop rotation, followed
by the two specialist species Echinochloa crus-galli and
Amaranthus retroflexus in monocultures and the two
generalist species Polygonum aviculare and Fallopia convolvulus in rotations. The two cropping systems were
not evenly distributed between the different soil types,
with proportionately more fields with crop rotation on
clay soils and sandy clay soils, and more fields with
monocultures on sandy soils (Table 3). However, the
distribution of ICS values across soil types presented in
Fig. 4 shows no significant effect of soil type on ICS of
weed communities.
Evolution of the specialist-generalist ratio over the last 30
years

Between the 1970 s and the 2000 s, weed species richness significantly decreased from 16.56 to 9.34 species
per field and species density from 61.5 individuals per
m2 to 20.2 (Table 2). Among the 121 species recorded
in both surveys, 48 species significantly decreased in frequency and only 12 significantly increased.
The index of community specialization ICS significantly
decreased from ICS = 54.25 +/- 0.97 in the 1970 s to ICS =
49.02 +/- 1.04 in the 2000 s (Fig. 2, Wilcoxon-Test, P <
0.001). The frequency of generalist species was either
stable (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Lolium multiflorum, Poa

annua, Taraxacum officinale) or increased (Lactuca serriola, Senecio vulgaris), while the frequency of specialist
species fell (Arenaria serpyllifolia, Lithospermum arvense,
Legousia speculum-veneris, Stachys arvensis). There was a
higher proportion of specialist species in the 1970 s while
the weed communities of the 2000 s were characterized
by a higher proportion of intermediate and generalist
species, with 90% of the effect attributable to the loss of
specialist species over time (Table 2).

The significant correlations between the pairs of
indices seem to indicate that the choice of an index
based on species co-occurrence or on precise environmental data with different ordination or classification
methods does not alter the ranking for most of the species. It is worth noting that indices based solely on species co-occurrence such as I6 demonstrated that
increasingly available, large-survey datasets could yield
information on species niche-breadth without detailed
environmental or habitat measurements [29].

Discussion
Robustness of the specialization index

The use of several indices was not to assess the performance and relative value of the different methods but
rather to increase the robustness of the results. The six
indices representing different measures of species niche
breadth gave consistent and correlated classifications of
species, from the most specialized to the most ubiquitous. Not surprisingly, there were exceptions, notably
Plantago lanceolata, ranked according to I2 as the most
generalist species while the other five indices consistently classified this species as intermediate. Such differences presumably arose when species are regarded as
generalist or not according to which niche axes were
included in the analysis (e.g. soil, climate or crop type).

Frequency and abundance of species according to their
niche breadth

The species with the largest niche breadth were also the
most frequent but not necessarily the most abundant
(Fig. 3). The random rarefaction of five common species
in the dataset did not alter the classification of these
species as generalists which tends to indicate that IS is
not directly affected by the number of samples where
the species concerned occurs (Fig. 1). This result partially supports the ‘resource breadth hypothesis’ [30]
that states that ‘species with broad environmental tolerance and able to use a wide variety of resources (’generalist species’) would survive in more places and over
larger areas’. It is however not clear to what extent the

relationship could result from a sampling artefact, i.e.
when data has been collected along a large environmental gradient, very frequent species will also appear as
generalist species [31]. However, the reverse is not
necessarily true: a rare species could either be generalist
(if the rare sites where they occur are very different) or
specialist (if all the sites where they occur have close
ecological conditions and sufficient connectivity to be
occupied). The absence of any strong relationships
between niche breadth and species mean abundance
means however that, contrary to the ‘resource breadth
hypothesis’, not all generalist weed species would
achieve high local densities. Moreover, the reverse
seems often true in cultivated fields, since arable weeds
that appear as specialists of a crop (for example Digitaria sanguinalis or Setaria pumila due to herbicide
resistance in maize fields) can form very dense
populations.
The effect of disturbance dynamics on the assembly of
communities

We show here that a two-year cycle combining maize
and winter wheat enhances the representation of generalist species in the weed communities found in maize
(48% of species) compared to maize cultivated as monoculture (37%). Maize grown every two to three years
does not appear to be sufficient in terms of (geometric)

fitness advantage for specialist weed species to outperform the generalist species that are able to cope with
alternating crops. Our results also suggest that in maize
grown in a rotation, the annual change of crop sowing
dates and associated practices have caused a shift in the
weed flora in favour of ‘germination generalist’, i.e. species that can germinate all-year-round or at least in
both autumn and spring (Polygonum aviculare, Lolium
multiflorum, Alopecurus myosuroides, Anagallis arvensis,
Galium aparine, Fumaria officinalis, Cirsium arvense
and Viola arvensis) [32]. The annual changes in herbicide selectivity limit the selection of specialist species
associated to a particular crop [33]. In the monoculture

Fried et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/20

situation, although many generalist species were still
observed, the repetition of a similar selection pressure
each year appears to have favoured some of the efficient
and well adapted species such as the intermediary-specialized Calystegia sepium, Cynodon dactylon, Amaranthus retroflexus or the specialized Digitaria
sanguinalis, Datura stramonium or Setaria pumila species. It is worth noting that we found no significant differences in either weed diversity or weed density
between crop rotation and monoculture which although
counter-intuitive [24] is in line with several studies
showing that the effect varies according to the rotation
that is being considered [34,35]. As in the case of the
present study, it is possible that the ratio of specialistgeneralist species in weed communities proves to be a
more responsive indicator of the effect of monoculture
versus crop rotation. This remains to be explored in
further studies.
Longer-term agricultural changes and the increasing
proportion of generalist species

The decline of arable weeds during the last decades has
been reported in various European countries [36-38]. In
this paper, we show that in addition to the loss in the
number of species, the specialist-generalist ratio in weed
communities has significantly changed over the last decades. This trend is mostly the result of a more pronounced decrease in the occurrence of specialist species,
while during the same period intermediate and generalist species remained more often stable or even
increased. For example, Legousia speculum-veneris and
Lithospermum arvense are two specialist weeds of winter
cereals on calcareous soils that are in decline most
probably due to their sensitivity to the main herbicides
used in cereals. The decline of Gnaphalium uliginosum,
Misopates orontium and Stachys arvensis, specialist species of acidic and sandy soils, could be related to the
agricultural practice of liming. Species of highly drained
soils with poor competing capacity (like the specialist
weed Arenaria serpyllifolia) could have been eliminated
by an increased level of fertilization and the resulting
increased competition with other plants, mostly the
crop itself. On the other hand, the increase or the maintenance of species such as Senecio vulgaris, Matricaria
perforata, Cirsium arvense, Poa annua or Lolium spp.
can be explained in part by their generalist properties i.
e. i) the capacity to germinate all year round and thus
the possibility that some cohorts avoid herbicides pressures or periods of intense competition with the crop
species, ii) the lack of specialisation to individual crop
types and thus the lack of response to shifts in the acreage devoted to specific crops and iii) the tolerance to a
broad range of soil types and thus the lack of response
to changes in agricultural practices modifying ecological

conditions (fertilization, liming, drainage, irrigation).
Our results therefore indicate that not only did agroecosystems lose a significant number of weed species in
the recent decades, but those that remain also are the
most generalist, which could lead to a decreased differentiation of weed communities found in different crop
types in the longer term. This confirms that the biotic
homogenisation process reported in other plant groups
in rural landscapes [16] also affects weed communities
found in cultivated fields.
There may be an apparent contradiction in the results
between the selection of generalists over the last 30
years of agricultural intensification and the selection of
specialists by monocultures (which is also perceived as
part of the intensification process). However, this paradox disappears when analyzing the nature of the species
specialization in each situation. In the diachronic long
term study, the ratio of generalist/specialist increases

show that, despite the high level of disturbance that characterises agroecosystems, ecological theories developed
in more stable environments do apply and that either a
sequence of disturbances of different nature (crop rotation) and/or the intensification of disturbances have
favoured the most generalist species.

because a lot of specialist species of typical physical
environments have disappeared or decreased with the
concomitant decline or extinction of their preferred
niche within arable fields (i.e. species adapted to nutrient poor soils, either wet and sandy soil or calcareous
rocky and dry soils). The difference of ICS in weed communities found in crop rotation and in monoculture is
more related to the specialization of species to the crop
species, and more specifically to the crop germination
date. In our study, species that were specialist of specific
crops could generally grow on a wide range of soil and
climatic conditions, for example Amaranthus retroflexus
and Digitaria sanguinalis which grow in maize crops.

Conclusions
This study aimed to classify arable weeds along a generalist/specialist continuum and to assess if differences in
disturbance patterns could lead to differences in the
representation of generalist and specialist species in plant
communities. Our study extends ecological approaches
to an environment highly disturbed by human activities
where it is not often easy to get clear expectations
between contrasted and/or opposite forces that govern
the assembly of community. The distinction of species
into generalist or specialist species helps to highlight the
general rules in the assembly of weed species into communities [39]. In our case, the classification of 152 arable
weed species along a specialist/generalist gradient gives
insights to their contrasted responses to changes in agriculture. We show that the relative proportion of generalist and specialist species is not constant but varies in
relation to the frequency and intensity of disturbance
that result from agricultural practices. Our results also

We used plots data derived from Biovigilance Flore, a
national monitoring scheme designed to survey changes
in arable flora in relation to farming practices [40]. In
the centre of 724 cultivated fields selected to cover the
diversity of cultural techniques and environmental conditions occurring in annual crop fields throughout mainland France, comprehensive vegetation records were
carried out in two separate 2000 m 2 plots, i.e. one
sprayed with herbicides and a second located in an
unsprayed control area. The ‘herbicide’ and the ‘control’
plots were randomly placed within the field, at least 20
m from the edge. The control plot is subjected to all
cultivation practices but the herbicide treatments. Vegetation was recorded over the whole 2000 m 2 , twice a
year, the first survey about a month after crop sowing
and the second later on during crop development, i.e.
early April for winter-sown crops and early July for
spring and summer-sown crops. This sampling design
provided a total of 2896 plots between 2002 and 2004.
The abundance of each species was estimated using six
abundance classes: ‘+’ found once in the 2000 m2 area;
‘1’ less than 1 individual/m2; ‘2’ 1-2 individual/m2; ‘3’ 320 individuals/m 2 ; ‘4’ 21-50 individuals/m 2 ; ‘5’ more
than 50 individuals/m2 (for further sampling details, see
[20]). In parallel to vegetation sampling, the monitoring
scheme included the record of environmental variables
as well as a survey describing agricultural practices collected by an interview with the farmers (Table 4). These
were available for 694 out of the initial 724 fields. In
this study, we extracted variables that are known to
affect weed species distribution [19,20]. These included
environmental variables such as altitude, climatic conditions (maximal and minimal temperature, total rainfall
and evapotranspiration) derived from METEO-France
climatic data with the AURELHY method of interpolation [41], soil texture (7 classes) and soil pH. Relevant
agronomic variables were the crop rotation history, sowing date and tillage operations (type and number of
operations, maximum depth of tillage). Precise data
about herbicides, fertilizer levels and crop canopy were
not available for all fields so are not included.
Niche breadth indices

The degree of specialisation of individual species was computed using six different published methods, since none of

Fried et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:20
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/20

them has received unanimous preference (Table 4) [42]. I1
and I6 were calculated solely on vegetation data and were
estimated using the 2896 plot data. The other four indices
were derived from both the environmental and agronomical variables described above and vegetation data which
was pooled at the field level (n= 694). For indices I2 to I5,
we pooled the floristic data of the herbicides plots and the
unsprayed control plots as preliminary tests performed on
each dataset independently indicated no significant differences in species ranking.
Indices I 1 to I 4 use multivariate space to estimate
niche breadth and relative position. In these analyses,
a generalist species would cover a large volume of the
n-dimensional ordination space, while a specialist species would be confined in a restricted area of that same
ordination space (Fig. 5). Index I1 uses the method of
‘Reciprocal scaling’ which is based on the Correspondence Analysis of a species-sample matrix [43]. Indices
I2 and I3 use Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA)
as originally developed to discriminate species niches
along environmental gradients. To measure the dispersion of the samples occupied by a species, Index I2 uses
the standard deviation of species score in CCA [44]
while Index I3 is based on the metrics of Rao [45,46] as
proposed by Thioulouse et al. [47]. Indices I 1 to I 3
assume unimodal response curves of species to environmental gradients, while Index I 4 , the Outlying Mean
Index (OMI) analysis makes no assumption about the
shape of species response curves to the environment
and, unlike CCA used in indices I2 and I3, Index I4 gives
equal weight to species-rich and species-poor sites [48].
Index I 5 uses the IndVal procedure [49] primarily
designed to target indicator species according to ecological conditions using cluster analysis. It can also be
used to distinguish generalist from specialist species
[50], the most generalist species being associated with a
broad partition while the most specialist species are
associated with finer partitions i.e. clustered latter in the
ordination tree.

Index I6 was based solely on the information given by
species co-occurrence and assumed the principle that,
all else being equal, generalists co-occur with many species across their range, while specialists co-occur with
relatively few species [51]. Contrary to simple distance
measures based on compositional dissimilarity, the distance between samples computed with index I 6 is
weighted by the ecological distance between the species
with more weight given to species that are found under
different conditions and less weight to species that are
found under the same conditions, as detailed hereafter.
First, the frequency of co-occurrence (F) between each
pair of species was computed, where F(a/b) is the probability to find species a when species b is present (in
general, F(a, b) is different from F(b, a)). The same kind
of relationship can then be computed between a sample
(S) and a species (a), the sample being considered as the
mean of the species it contains:
F ( S, a ) = ⎡ F ( x1, a ) + F ( x2, a ) + … + F ( xi, a ) + … + F ( xn, a ) ⎤ / n
⎣
⎦

(1)

with x1 to xn, n species present in the sample S.
Hence, the distance between each pair of samples
depends not only on their respective composition but
also on a common global reference, i.e., the entire complement of species within the data set. Therefore even
samples with no common species can be compared (i.e.
their distance will not systematically equals 1) and the
measure is independent of species richness in the
samples.
Classification of the French arable flora along a specialistgeneralist gradient

For each index, we ranked all the species observed in at
least ten fields from the most generalist (rank 1) to the
most specialist species (rank n). Spearman’s rank correlation test was then used to compare the classifications
given by each index. For each species, we calculated the
mean rank and standard deviation over the six indices.

Figure 5 Reciprocal scaling of species and plot records. Each point represents a plot. Ellipses represent respective species habitat amplitudes
(niche breadth) and deviances (niche position) compared to a theoretical species having a uniform distribution derived on the sampling (central
ellipse). The centre of the ellipse is given by the mean of ordination scores, and axes of the ellipse are related to the variance of ordination
scores. The figure gives an example of four contrasted species, each of the 152 species were assessed in this way. Both rare (Frequency < 5%)
and common (Frequency > 5%) species can present a full range of responses from wide (generalist) to narrow (specialist) niche breadth.

The mean rank resulted in a global index of specialization (IS); low IS indicated generalist species whereas high
Is indicated specialist species. We cut the continuum of
IS into three classes of equal size to classify species as
either generalist, intermediate or specialist. The 25%
species having the highest IS standard deviation were
grouped into a fourth category called “varying category”.
Finally, we randomly rarefied 5 species (Lolium multiflorum, Raphanus raphanistrum, Senecio vulgaris, Stellaria media and Veronica persica) to 75%, 50% and 25%
of their real occurrences in order to check for a frequency-dependence bias in our classification.

Finally, we computed the frequency and abundance of
each species. The frequency is the number of occurrences where the species is present divided by the total
number of surveyed plots while the mean abundance is
given by the following formula:
Mean abundance = 11.5 * n3 + 35.5 * n4 + 75.5 * n5 + 1.5 ( N − n3 − n4 − n5 ) / N

with n3, n4, n5 the number of samples within the
coefficients classes 3, 4 and 5 respectively and N, the
total number of samples. 11.5, 35.5 and 75.5 correspond
to the mean plant * m-2 density of the abundance coefficient classes 3, 4 and 5, respectively [52].

Community response to disturbance regimes in
agricultural systems

The average degree of specialization of a given community ICS was calculated as the mean IS of the species present. Species belonging to the ‘varying category’ were
not used in the I CS calculations. As differences in ICS
between communities could either reflect (i) a difference
in the proportion of generalist species in the community, (ii) a difference in the proportion of specialists or
(iii) a combination of both, we used the proportion of
specialist, intermediate and generalist species in the
community as additional indicators.
The comparison of weed communities in monoculture
versus crop rotation was based on data from the Biovigilance Flore dataset. We used vegetation plots sampled in
maize cultivated in monoculture for at least the last four
years (n = 235 fields) and vegetation plots recorded in
maize fields cropped within a crop-rotation just after
winter wheat (n = 169 fields). We compared I CS in
monoculture and crop rotation using a Wilcoxon test
and the proportion of generalist, intermediate and specialist species using a c2-test. To ensure that the influence of soil type on the I CS index is not confounding
the analysis of the cropping systems, we have analysed
the distribution of cropping systems as well as the distribution of ICS values across soil types.
The comparison of weed communities occurring in
the 1970 s and in the 2000 s was carried out by using a
repeat survey (2005-2006) of 158 fields initially surveyed
between 1968 and 1976 (for further sampling details, see
[38]). ICS and the proportion of species belonging to the
three classes were compared as described above.
