Analysis of promoter activity of members of the
PECTATE LYASE-LIKE (PLL) gene family in cell
separation in Arabidopsis
Lingxia Sun, Steven van Nocker*

Abstract
Background: Pectate lyases depolymerize pectins by catalyzing the eliminative cleavage of a-1,4-linked
galacturonic acid. Pectate lyase-like (PLL) genes make up among the largest and most complex families in plants,
but their cellular and organismal roles have not been well characterized, and the activity of these genes has been
assessed only at the level of entire organs or plant parts, potentially obscuring important sub-organ or cell-typespecific activities. As a first step to understand the potential functional diversity of PLL genes in plants and
specificity of individual genes, we utilized a reporter gene approach to document the spatial and temporal
promoter activity for 23 of the 26 members of the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) PLL gene family throughout
development, focusing on processes involving cell separation.
Results: Numerous PLL promoters directed activity in localized domains programmed for cell separation, such as
the abscission zones of the sepal, petal, stamen, and seed, as well as the fruit dehiscence zone. Several drove
activity in cell types expected to facilitate separation, including the style and root endodermal and cortical layers
during lateral root emergence. However, PLL promoters were active in domains not obviously programmed for
separation, including the stipule, hydathode and root axis. Nearly all PLL promoters showed extensive overlap of
activity in most of the regions analyzed.
Conclusions: Our results document potential for involvement of PLL genes in numerous aspects of growth and
development both dependent and independent of cell separation. Although the complexity of the PLL gene family
allows for enormous potential for gene specialization through spatial or temporal regulation, the high degree of
overlap of activity among the PLL promoters suggests extensive redundancy. Alternatively, functional specialization
might be determined at the post-transcriptional or protein level.

Background
Pectins, a class of polysaccharide polymer typically characterized by a linear backbone of a-1,4-linked galacturonic acid (GalA) residues, are a major component of
primary plant cell walls, and within the wall form a
matrix in which a network of cellulose and hemicellulose is embedded [1-3]. Pectins contribute to the
mechanical strength and physical properties of primary
cell walls, but also function in intercellular adhesion
[4-6], and can act as signaling molecules in morphogenesis and pathogen defense [2].

Plant growth and development is accompanied by
dynamic remodeling of the cell wall, which in turn
requires modifications of the various cell wall components including pectin. In accordance with the often
complex structure of some pectins, an assortment of pectinase activities modify or degrade these polymers. Pectinesterases target methyl-esterified homogalacturonan,
yielding substrates for polygalacturonases and pectate
lyases, which cleave the GalA backbone [6]. Rhamnogalacturonases and rhamnogalacturonan lyases depolymerize branched regions of rhamnogalacturonan, whereas
b-galactosidases and a-arabinosidases can degrade the
galactan/arabinan/arabinogalactan side chains. Pectate
lyases (EC 4.2.2.2) have been most extensively studied in
Erwinia chrysanthemi, a major causal agent of soft-rot

diseases that affect a wide range of plant species [7-9].
Their action not only results in maceration of plant tissues but also can activate plant defense systems [10-12].
Plant PECTATE LYASE-LIKE (PLL) genes encode proteins with strong amino acid sequence homology with
the PelC isoform of bacterial pectate lyases [13,14] and
exist as large families in plants where studied [15]. The
abundance of PLL genes in plants, including 26 in Arabidopsis, 12 in rice, and 22 in poplar, has arisen from multiple gene duplication events [16,17], a process that may
enhance plasticity in adaptation to changing environments [18]. Models predict that gene redundancy is
evolutionarily stable only when duplicated genes differentiate in some aspect of their function, suggesting that
individual members of large families such as PLL may
have some unique function [18].
Various analyses of PLL genes from plants revealed
expression in a broad range of organs and plant parts
including root, leaf, flower, pollen, filament, style, pistil,
and ripening fruit [14,16,19-24]. PLL genes in several
studies also showed elevated expression in response to
auxin, wounding, and/or pathogen infection [16,25-28].
Transcriptional analysis in Arabidopsis revealed that a
small subset of PLL genes were up-regulated during stamen abscission or in cortical cell separation during the
emergence of the lateral root [16,29,30]. Reduced
expression of strawberry PL1 in transgenic strawberry
plants suggested a natural role in tissue softening during
fruit ripening [31]. All of these data implicate PLL genes
in various plant growth and development events. However, the activity of these genes has been characterized
only at the level of entire organs or plant parts, potentially obscuring important sub-organ or cell-type-specific
activities.
During plant growth and development, there are many
events in which adjacent cells separate in a coordinated
manner. Cell separation resulting in organ abscission, or
anther or fruit dehiscence, occurs in predetermined
positions, called abscission zones (AZs) or dehiscence
zones (DZs), respectively [32,33]. Intercellular space
formed in leaves and stems can result from restricted
separation of cells at the tricellular regions [34]. Fruit
ripening also involves limited cell separation, in which
only the middle lamella is degraded, with tricellular
junctions and plasmodesmata often remaining intact
[35,36]. Targeted cell separation is also involved in the
processes of seed germination, lateral root emergence,
pollen tube penetration through the transmitting tract,
and shedding of columella root cap cells [37,38]. In this
study, we examined spatial-temporal expression patterns
of promoters of PLL family members, focusing on the
various cell separation and wall loosening events that
occur during Arabidopsis growth and development.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis

Based on peptide sequence homology with the enzymatically characterized pectate lyase PL1 from banana and
annotated protein domains, the Arabidopsis genome
encodes for 26 pectate-lyase-like proteins. Neighborjoining analysis partitioned these protein sequences into
five subfamilies (Figure 1). This genomic content and
phylogenetic organization is similar to that previously
reported for PLLs from multiple plant species including
Arabidopsis [16,21]. All Arabidopsis PLLs exhibited a
region of sequence homology with pectate lyase C
(pelC) from Erwinia chrysanthemi, annotated as the
Pec_lyase_C (Pfam00544) domain (Figure 1) and 23 of
the proteins contain a probable amino-terminal signal
peptide. The four members included in Subfamily II
(PLL8-11) also exhibit a Pec_lyase_N (Pfam04431)
domain, a short region of high homology whose structure or function has not been described. The predicted
carboxyl-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)
anchor site previously identified in PMR6 (POWDERY
MILDEW RESISTANCE 6, also called PLL13) was not
obviously present in other PLLs, suggesting a specialized
function of PMR6 associated with powdery mildew susceptibility [28] (Figure 1).
Estimation of PLL gene expression through analysis of
public transcriptome data

As a first step to assess expression pattern of PLL genes
in Arabidopsis, we analyzed publicly available transcriptome data. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) found in
public databanks corresponding to individual PLL gene
family members were found to be sourced from various
tissues and stages across Arabidopsis growth and development, as well as various environmental conditions
(not shown). Representational frequency of ESTs for
individual PLL genes was highly variable both across the
gene family and within subfamilies (Figure 1). Analysis
of publicly available microarray data also suggested that
there was at least some unique developmental pattern of
expression for most PLL genes (see Additional file 1).
A striking exception are the four members of Subfamily
II (PLL8-PLL11), which showed a similar expression pattern localized predominately to pollen and stamens (see
Additional file 1). Several genes (PLL3, 4, 6, 7, 12, and
24) were transcriptionally silenced across most sampled
tissues, whereas PLL2 was apparently expressed ubiquitously, suggesting a very general function (see Additional file 1). These data are generally consistent with
the results of qualitative RT-PCR analysis of PLL genes
[16] and support a collectively ubiquitous function for
PLLs in growth and development and the potential for
functional specialization by many of these genes.

Analysis of PLL promoter activity

Direct approaches for analysis of gene expression such
as RNA-seq, microarray analysis and RT-PCR can be
problematic when applied to large gene families, due to
sequence homology among family members and/or
inability to resolve expression at the cellular level.
Accordingly, we utilized a histological reporter gene (bglucuronidase, GUS) to determine the expression regulatory potential of individual PLL gene promoters. We
engineered the GUS coding sequence adjacent to up to
~2 kb of 5’ UTR/promoter sequence, preserving the
authentic start codon of the PLL genes, and expressed
the PLL::GUS fusions in transgenic Arabidopsis (see
Additional file 2). For each PLL gene, we analyzed at
least four independent transgenic lines. GUS activity
patterns were generally consistent between independent
lines, with the exception of three (PLL6, PLL12, and
PLL14) that showed weak and variable activity and were

not analyzed further. No GUS activity was observed in
transgenic plants transformed with a promoterless GUS
construction, or in non-transgenic plants, in any plant
part or under any condition used for analysis. Based on
the known roles for pectins in cell adhesion and cell
wall architecture, we focused our analysis on developmental events closely associated with cell separation.
PLL::GUS expression associated with cell separation

Floral organ AZs. Cell separation in Arabidopsis has
been best characterized in the context of floral organ
abscission [32]. Arabidopsis exhibits abscission of sepals,
petals, and stamens following pollination. Abscission is
conditioned by cell separation within the AZ, a tightly
localized region at the base of the floral organs [39]. We
analyzed developing flowers at various stages until Stage
18, when siliques began to yellow [40]. (Figure 2 and
see below). GUS activity within the AZs was observed

for 18 PLL promoters (Figure 2 and see Additional file
3). For all of these, GUS activity was first detected in
the AZs of sepals, petals, and stamens at Stage 16,
which followed anthesis by about 2 days and was
marked by the withering of sepals and petals (Figure 2)
[40]. GUS activity had increased within the AZs of all
three organ types by Stage 17, when perianth organs
were abscising (Figure 2). For all PLL promoters, GUS
activity in the AZs was detectable but very weak at
Stage 18 (not shown). Activity for PLL26 in floral organ
AZs was apparent through Stage 19, marked by valve
separation (not shown). These results are consistent
with those of Cai and Lashbrook [29], who identified
PLL18 as substantially upregulated in the stamen AZ
through transcriptional profiling of laser-capture-microdissected tissues. This upregulation was apparent in the
latter part of Stage 15, following anthesis by approximately 36 h [29,40].

drove GUS activity within the apparent DZ of developing
siliques. This subset of PLLs nearly completely overlapped with the subset driving expression in floral organ
AZs (see Additional file 3). For all, GUS activity was evident at the onset of stage 18, which preceded separation
of the valves by approximately 24 h (not shown). GUS
activity was first seen at the basal and apical ends of siliques, where valve separation was initiated, and then
became established along the entire length of the fruit as
valve separation progressed (Figure 3A and not shown).
A mostly overlapping subset of 16 PLL promoters
drove GUS activity within the apparent seed AZ (Figure
3B and see Additional file 3). For all of these, GUS
activity was not observed at the beginning of stage 19,
but was obvious in seeds that were still attached to the
funiculus and septum before the beginning of Stage 20
(e.g., PLL19 in Figure 3B).
Radicle emergence during seed germination

Fruit DZ and seed AZ

The Arabidopsis fruit consists of two valves separated by
a replum. Mature fruits dehisce due to cell separation in
the so-called DZ, which is distributed along the valve
margins and includes a separation layer [41]. Mature
seeds are released from the funiculus, a stalk-like structure connecting seeds to the replum, at a site referred to
as the seed AZ. We analyzed GUS activity in these
regions during development of flowers and fruit from
Stage 16 through Stage 20, marked by seed abscission
[40] (Figure 3A). We found that 17 of the PLL promoters

During seed germination in Arabidopsis, the radicle
penetrates a single endosperm cell layer at the micropylar end of the seed [42]. To assess PLL promoter activity
in this region, we stained seeds for GUS activity 24 h
after imbibition, when approximately half of the seeds
showed rupture of the testa but before radicle emergence was seen (not shown). Two PLL promoters
(PLL16 and PLL22) directed GUS activity in germinating
seeds; in both cases GUS activity was observed in the
micropylar end before obvious emergence of the radicle
(Figure 4A and not shown).

Lateral root initiation

Arabidopsis lateral roots initiate from the pericycle cell
layer and must penetrate the overlaying endodermal,
cortical and epidermal layers during emergence [43].
Although several PLL promoters drove GUS activity at
relatively weak levels along the axis of primary roots
(see below), six (PLL16, 19, 21-23, 26) showed strong
activity in primary roots of 12-d-old plants that were

initiating lateral roots. This activity was confined to
the endodermal and cortical layers in the region of
initiation, but was not obviously restricted to cell
layers directly overlaying the new lateral root primordia (Figure 4B and not shown). We did not observe
strong GUS staining in the epidermis for any of the six
promoters (Figure 4B and not shown). These findings
are consistent with the increased transcriptional

cotyledons, hyocotyl, root/hypocotyl junction, root axes,
and/or root tips (Figure 5A and see Additional file 3). A
subset of 11 of these promoters also drove GUS activity
along the root axes in 5-d-old seedlings (Figure 5B and
see Additional file 3); this subset included the six that
were strongly active during lateral root initiation (above).
Four promoters, PLL13, PLL17, PLL22, and PLL25, were
active in the root tips. PLL25 was unique in that it drove
GUS activity specifically in the root tip. Both PLL22 and
PLL25 drove expression in a broad region that included
the columella root cap (Figure 5B).

We observed GUS activity in fully expanded cotyledons
and rosette leaves for seven PLL promoters (Figure 6A).
For all seven, activity was restricted to the tip of the
cotyledon/leaf. This corresponds to the position of the
hydathodes, specialized pore-like structures that release
water and solutes from the xylem [44].
GUS activity was apparent within the shoot apex of
plants in the vegetative phase for 19 PLL promoters.
Upon close examination, in all cases this activity
appeared in tightly localized foci bordering the base of
initiating leaves, including cauline leaves (Figure 6B and
not shown), at the position of the stipules. In Arabidopsis, stipules are apparent on the newly formed leaves but
become less obvious upon leaf expansion. For all PLLs,
GUS activity was strongest in those leaves that had
initiated and were undergoing expansion, and weakest
or not apparent in fully expanded leaves (Figure 6Cand
not shown). The function of stipules in Arabidopsis
development remains largely unknown. However, it has
been demonstrated that stipules are primary sites for
the accumulation of auxin associated with vascular differentiation and leaf morphogenesis [45,46]. No GUS
activity was observed for any PLL promoter in the apex
after the transition to flowering (not shown).

accumulation previously reported for PLL16 and PLL26
during lateral root emergence induced by auxin
[26,30].
PLL::GUS expression in other developmental contexts

To analyze PLL promoter activity in a broader developmental context, including processes potentially independent of cell separation, we undertook a comprehensive
analysis of the activity of all of the studied PLL promoters during growth and development of Arabidopsis.
Seedlings

GUS activity was detected in 1-d-old seedlings for 22 PLL
promoters. In seedlings, GUS staining was seen in the

Two PLL promoters (PLL15 and PLL24) drove GUS
activity within a restricted region on the adaxial side of
the base of pedicels (Figure 7A). For both, this was
apparent after Stage 12 of floral development, just before
anthesis, and through development of the green silique
(not shown). The PLL15 and PLL24 promoters, in addition to PLL1 and PLL22, also drove GUS activity at the
base of trichomes on the leaf epidermis (Figure 7B and
see Additional file 3). In all cases, GUS activity was limited to the stellate trichomes on the adaxial surface of
rosette leaves, in the region roughly corresponding to
basement cells, a group of specialized cells encircling the
trichome and potentially serving as structural and/or biochemical support for the trichome (Figure 7B).

Flowers

GUS activity was detected in developing flowers for all
23 of the PLL promoters (Figure 8 and see Additional
file 3). None of the promoters studied showed strong
activity before Stage 11, which is marked by appearance
of stigmatic papillae [40] (not shown). All except PLL10
drove GUS activity in varying domains within the style
and/or stigma (Figure 8Aand 8B and see Additional
file 3). Some of these showed localized expression in
the style (e.g., PLL1), whereas others showed expression
throughout the stigma (e.g., PLL2), or in the basal portion of the stigma extending into the style (e.g., PLL20).
A potential function for PLL genes expressed in the
stigma and style is to facilitate pollen tube growth, via
separation of transmitting tract cells and/or remodeling
of cell walls in this tissue. In the stamen, several promoters drove activity in the filament (e.g., PLL2), and/or
throughout the anther and predominantly localized to
pollen sacs and/or developing pollen (e.g., PLL10). The
subset of PLLs driving expression in pollen is largely
consistent with that determined based on transcriptome
analysis (see Additional file 1) or RT-PCR [16]. PLL3
and PLL25 were distinguished by driving GUS activity
in the stamen limited to the junction of the filament
and anther (Figure 8B and see Additional file 3).

PLL13 drove expression in the style in immature flowers
(Figure 8A), but by Stage 15 this activity was not apparent, and instead GUS staining was seen in developing
seeds (Figure 8B). Activity of PLL13 was not seen in
ovules at Stage 12 or earlier (Figure 8A), or in developing seeds at Stage 16 or later (Figure 2). We hypothesize that this seed-associated pattern is associated with
the cellularization of the endosperm [47].
Correlation or divergence of PLL promoter activity with
patterns of RNA accumulation

To evaluate the potential for regulation of PLL genes outside of the context of promoter activity, we analyzed our
findings in relation to previously reported transcriptional
patterns based on microarray analysis of Arabidopsis
organs or whole structures (see above and Additional
file 1[48].
Most notably, the strong promoter activity found in
anthers for the four members of Subfamily II (PLL8PLL11) (Figure 8) corresponded well with the stamenassociated pattern of mRNA localization (see Additional
file 1). However, PLL8, 9, and 11 also showed strong
promoter activity variously outside of flowers in the
hypocotyl (PLL11), root/hypocotyl junction (PLL8 and 9),
and stipules (PLL8 and 11), regions where transcriptional

profiling did not obviously predict promoter activity.
Genes expected to be transcriptionally quiescent based
on microarray analysis, such as PLL4 or PLL24, showed
promoter activity that was relatively strong, and that was
similar to genes that showed strong transcriptional signals
such as PLL8 or PLL15, respectively. PLL2, which might
be expected to be constitutively expressed as a ‘housekeeping’ gene based on microarray analysis, showed promoter activity in only a subset of the regions analyzed
(see Additional file 3). At least part of these apparent
inconsistencies between promoter activity analysis and
transcriptional profiling can be attributed to our qualitative representation of promoter activity, which is in reality a quantitative function. The lack of high values for
mRNA accumulation in structures (e.g., the silique) that
include tissues with strong promoter activity (e.g., the
DZ) could be simply explained by the fact that such

tissues make up only a small portion of the bulk of the
regions subject to analysis. Other cases where mRNA
levels are low in spite of strong regional promoter activity
might be attributed to rapid mRNA turnover. It is most
difficult to explain the accumulation of mRNAs in tissues
or structures that lack detectable promoter activity, for
example the strong and ubiquitous mRNA expression of
PLL2. In these cases regulatory elements required for
appropriate expression might lay outside of the ~2 kb 5’
region utilized to direct GUS expression.

Conclusions
In this study we determined the temporal and regional
promoter activity for members of the PLL gene family
during growth and development of Arabidopsis. Given
the ubiquitous role of pectins in intercellular adhesion
and cell wall architecture, and the various organismal

processes that require targeted cell separation or cell
wall remodeling, these genes are expected to be of fundamental importance.
We found that, as expected, promoter activity was
common in cell types programmed for abscission,
most obviously the perianth floral organ AZs, the DZ
of the fruit, and the seed AZ. Activity was also seen in
regions, such as cell layers in the region of initiating
lateral roots, where cell separation is expected but has
not been well characterized. Pectate lyase activity is
expected to act in concert with other cell wall remodeling activities both to condition cell separation and
to modify newly exposed cells for barrier functions.
Interestingly, we saw more limited PLL promoter activity at the base of pedicels of flowers and fruits. Cells in
these regions can be artificially programmed to
undergo separation in Arabidopsis, in response to
ectopic activity of the small abscission-associated peptide IDA [49], suggesting an abscission-related role. If
these PLL genes do have a cryptic function in flower/
fruit abscission, abscission may be normally limited by
the degree of pectate lyase activity or deficiency of
other, cooperative, cell wall-modifying activities. Interestingly, the two PLL promoters driving activity in this
region also were active in cells at the base of trichomes, suggesting their pedicel- and trichome-associated roles may be analogous. Both regions are
subject to mechanical stress imparted by movement of
the pedicels/trichomes and an alternative function for

these PLLs may be to participate in a pathway of cell
wall remodeling to accommodate such stress.
Other patterns of PLL activity were difficult to explain
given a function limited to cell separation, and might
instead be associated with general cell wall remodeling
accompanying growth and differentiation. The extensive
and various activities seen in the root is a good example
of this. We can not provide a simple explanation for the
strong and widespread promoter activity in stipules;
however, these structures are absorbed into the leaf periphery during leaf expansion and this process could be
accompanied by radical changes in cell wall morphology.
Interestingly, both stipules and hydathodes were previously characterized as sites of high free auxin concentration during early leaf development [45]. A subset of
PLL promoters in our study were found to be actively
associated with lateral root emergence, or in the region
of the root apical meristem, other sites associated with
local auxin concentration maxima [30,50]. These observations suggest a close functional relationship between
these PLLs and auxin.
We note that many promoter activities of the PLL
genes are superficially similar to those exhibited collectively by several presumed polygalacturonase genes [51].
These include cases intuitively related to cell separation
(perianth organ AZs, sites of lateral root emergence,
fruit DZ, seed AZ, germinating seed) and cases in which
activity may be limited to cell wall remodeling (developing pollen and seeds). This implies close functional association between PLLs and PGs, which is expected given
that both should target pectins.
An obvious use of data from high-throughput analyses
of promoter activity and/or transcriptional profiles is to
guide reversed-genetics analyses, especially where phenotypes are difficult to anticipate and/or where potential
redundancy of the targeted genes is a limitation. The
original intent of this project was to identify individual
or small subsets of PLL genes that might be targeted in
this manner. However, the surprisingly high degree of
overlap both in promoter activity and RNA accumulation observed among the PLL genes/promoters largely
precluded this objective. We note that neither our promoter activity analysis nor previous microarray data
would intuitively predict the documented non-redundant role for PLL13 (PMR6) in facilitating infection by
powdery mildew [28]. This role is accomplished where
infection occurs in leaf cells, where neither transcriptional profiling nor our promoter analysis suggested
strong or non-redundant expression.
Another obvious application of transcriptional data is
the computational identification of DNA regulatory elements linked to regionally or temporally specific expression patterns. Here, it is noteworthy that the correlation

between the transcriptional profiles previously established for these genes [16,48] and their promoter activity
(this study) was apparently very limited. This justifies
the additional time and expense necessary to accomplish
comprehensive promoter activity profiles, and/or celltype specific transcriptional profiling to define transcriptional regulatory elements.
The PLL gene family is one of the largest and most
complex in Arabidopsis, suggesting enormous potential
for gene specialization through spatial or temporal regulation. However, we found a remarkably high degree of

overlap of activity among the PLL promoters. The activity of 19 of the 23 tested PLLs in the stipules is an
excellent example of this, as is the activity of at least 18
in the apparent AZs of the sepals, petals and stamens at
similar stages of development. This observation is
surprising given that gene duplications should be evolutionarily stable only after having acquired a useful, nonredundant function. For PLLs, functional specificity may
be bestowed by post-transcriptional and downstream
mechanisms. Such specificity might include regulation
of RNA stability. Specificity might also be directed at

the protein level, through potential differences in localization or mobility within the apoplast. Alternatively,
given the expected dynamic pH environment of the apoplast, the proteins might function only within a narrow
pH window. Finally, various PLL proteins might show
preference for specific pectin substrates, an intriguing
possibility given the structural complexity of pectins.
Many of these possibilities could be addressed by the
purification (or recombinant synthesis) and enzymatic
characterization of individual PLLs.

of PCR-induced mutation, and cloned into the pCAMBIA1305 vector (Cambia, Black Mountain, Australia)
modified to contain an NcoI site at the start codon of
the GUS gene and multiple cloning sites replacing the
pCAMBIA Lac Z alpha and CaMV35S regions. This
resulted in PLL::GUS fusions that preserve the authentic 5’ UTR and start codon position. Plasmid DNAs
were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
GV3101 and transformed into wild-type plants using
the floral dipping method [61]. Transgenic plants were
subjected to selection with the herbicide glufosinate
(Basta; Beyer CropScience, Barmen, Germany).

Plant growth conditions

Wild type Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) was used
for all experiments. Standard growth conditions were 16h-cool white fluorescent light/8-h-dark photoperiods at
22°C. For growth in sterile culture, seeds were surfacesterilized and germinated on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with
10 mM MES [2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid]
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH adjusted to 5.7, and solidified
with 0.8% phytoagar (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Phylogenetic analysis and protein domain identification

The peptide sequence of an enzymatically confirmed
pectate lyase from banana, Musa acuminata PL1 (GenBank accession AF206319) [22], was utilized as a query
in BLASTP (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool Protein)
analysis of Arabidopsis translated open reading frames
[The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) Version
7] [52], and closely related proteins [Expect (E) value <
8E-36] were used for phylogenetic tree construction.
Predicted amino acid sequences were aligned using
ClustalW2 [53,54], and MEGA4 [55] was used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Annotated PLL protein
domains were identified in the Pfam database [56,57] as
follows: PF03211, Pectate_lyase; PF00544, Pec_lyase_C;
PF09492, Pec_lyase; PF04431, Pec_lyase_N. Aminoterminal signal peptides were defined by SignalP 3.0 [58]
using a maximum S-score larger than 0.95 and signal
peptide probability greater than 0.80 [59]. The number
of ESTs for each gene in the NCBI Unigene database
was found at NCBI [60].
Transgenic plant construction

To engineer GUS as a reporter for PLL promoter activity, up to approximately 2 kb of genomic DNA,
upstream from the start codon, was amplified by PCR
using gene-specific primers (see Additional file 4)
containing unique restriction sites. In general, where
the upstream intergenic region was less than 2 kb, all
of the region was included (see Additional file 2). All
amplification products were sequenced to confirm lack

Histochemical GUS assays

Populations derived from at least four independently
transformed transgenic lines were analyzed for each PLL::
GUS construction. For histochemical GUS assays, plants
or plant parts at various developmental stages were
immersed in GUS staining solution [0.5 mM X-gluc,
0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH adjusted to 7.2)] under vacuum infiltration for
5 min, and incubated at 37°C for various lengths of time.
After staining, tissues were incubated in 70% ethanol for
several hours to remove chlorophyll. Staining was visualized using a Nikon dissecting microscope equipped with
a digital camera. Flower developmental stages annotated
in this study were described by Smyth et al [40].
Analysis of AtGenExpress data

Microarray data were collected from the AtGenExpress
Development data set [48]. Only results from wild-type
plants were included in the analysis. The log 2 -transformed absolute signal values were used in hierarchical
clustering based on average linkage (Cluster version 3;
[62]), and results were visualized in TreeView [62].
