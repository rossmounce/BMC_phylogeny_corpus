Abstract
Background: Great excitement accompanied discoveries over the last decade in several Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria of the LuxS protein, which catalyzes production of the AI-2
autoinducer molecule for a second quorum sensing system (QS-2). Since the luxS gene was found
to be widespread among the most diverse bacterial taxa, it was hypothesized that AI-2 may
constitute the basis of a universal microbial language, a kind of bacterial Esperanto. Many of the
studies published in this field have drawn a direct correlation between the occurrence of the luxS
gene in a given organism and the presence and functionality of a QS-2 therein. However, rarely
hathe existence of potential AI-2 receptors been examined. This is important, since it is now well
recognized that LuxS also holds a central role as a metabolic enzyme in the activated methyl cycle
which is responsible for the generation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the major methyl donor in the
cell.
Results: In order to assess whether the role of LuxS in these bacteria is indeed related to AI-2
mediated quorum sensing we analyzed genomic databases searching for established AI-2 receptors
(i.e., LuxPQ-receptor of Vibrio harveyi and Lsr ABC-transporter of Salmonella typhimurium) and
other presumed QS-related proteins and compared the outcome with published results about the
role of QS-2 in these organisms. An unequivocal AI-2 related behavior was restricted primarily to
organisms bearing known AI-2 receptor genes, while phenotypes of luxS mutant bacteria lacking
these genes could often be explained simply by assuming deficiencies in sulfur metabolism.
Conclusion: Genomic analysis shows that while LuxPQ is restricted to Vibrionales, the Lsrreceptor complex is mainly present in pathogenic bacteria associated with endotherms. This
suggests that QS-2 may play an important role in interactions with animal hosts. In most other
species, however, the role of LuxS appears to be limited to metabolism, although in a few cases
the presence of yet unknown receptors or the adaptation of pre-existent effectors to QS-2 must
be postulated.

Background
Population density- and growth phase-dependent bacterial cell-to-cell communication involving the production
and detection of extracellular signaling molecules

(autoinducers) is referred to as quorum sensing (QS). The
detection of a stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression, enabling
bacteria to coordinate their behavior in response to enviPage 1 of 19

ronmental challenges. A large number of cellular functions are known to be regulated via the QS mechanism in
a variety of bacterial species such as biofilm formation,
swarming behavior or the production of antibiotics and
virulence factors [1]. N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)
are the most frequent signaling molecules found in Gramnegative bacteria. This first autoinduction system (QS-1)
was identified in the luminescent marine symbiont Vibrio
fischeri and is based on the pheromone N-3-oxohexanoylL-homoserine lactone [2,3]. Meanwhile several other type
I autoinducers (AI-1), whose molecules differ only in the
AHL-acyl side chain moiety, have been discovered in a
number of Gram-negative bacteria [1]. Since every species
employs specific receptors for its own AHL molecule, not
every bacterium can automatically cross-talk with all other
bacteria, so that every 'diAHLect' can essentially be understood only by those species sharing the same cognate
receptor. However, due to the fact that different bacteria
may simultaneously use several signal molecules and
receptors, and given the chemical similarity of the different AHL molecules, a limited interaction (e.g., attenuated
response or interference) is possible even for bacteria carrying non-cognate receptors. Thus, a limited (but not universal) communication between different bacterial species
is possible through QS-1 [4-6].
In this respect great interest accompanied the discovery,
first in Vibrio harveyi [7] then in a variety of other bacteria
[8], of the LuxS protein that catalyzes the production of
an autoinducer molecule (AI-2) for a second quorum
sensing system (QS-2) [9]. Since the luxS gene was subsequently found to be widespread among both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, it was tempting to
presume that QS-2 may constitute the basis of an universal language, a sort of bacterial Esperanto [10]. The presence of luxS has been reported in several subgroups of the
bacterial kingdom, being widely found in Bacteroidetes,
Actinobactetria, and β- plus γ-Proteobacteria, along with
all Bacilli, Deinococci and ε-Proteobacteria, but not in
Archaea or Eukarya [11]
In Vibrio species QS-2 is connected with QS-1 by partially
sharing the same transduction pathway leading through
the central signal relay protein LuxU to the terminal
response regulator LuxO [12,13], but displays a separate
receptor for AI-2, namely the two component sensor
kinase LuxPQ [14]. Although homologs to LuxPQ have
been found in other Vibrio species [15-18], other bacterial
species were reported to lack similar QS-2 related proteins
with the exception of LuxS, raising the prospect that this
kind of receptor and signal transduction pathway is limited to the Vibrionales [19]. In Salmonella typhimurium
other genes were shown to encode for a different complex
that serves as receptor for AI-2 [20]. An ABC-type transporter named Lsr (Lux S-regulated) is responsible for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/154

AI-2 uptake into the cell and was reported subsequently
also in Escherichia coli [21]. AI-2 is phosphorylated inside
the cell and is anticipated to interact with LsrR, a protein
that contributes to repress the lsr-operon and possibly acts
as regulator of gene expression [20,22]. This mechanism is
different from AI-2 detection in V. harveyi, where just the
signal but not the AI-2 molecule is transduced inside the
cell. Thus alternative explanations to QS have been proposed whereby AI-2 may be released as a waste product
and then reused subsequently as a metabolite [23,24] or,
as in the case of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, that
the molecule may be used as a borate scavenger by bacteria [25].
There are now several studies that describe the central role
of LuxS in E. coli as crucial for the transition to pathogenic
existence inside the host [26,27] by controlling virulence
determinants such as motility [28], biofilm formation
[29] or gene expression [30]. AI-2 dependent behavior
was consequently claimed also in other Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria (Tables 1, 2, 3 and additional
file 1Table 1s), but many reports are simply based on the
presence of the luxS gene, mutant analysis and/or additional phenotypic tests such as the use of AI-2 reporter
strain V. harveyi BB170 [27]. Rarely have investigations
examined the existence of potential AI-2 receptors or
assessed their functionality by proving AI-2 depletion of
the media by the wildtype or by performing a chemical
complementation of luxS mutants using pure AI-2 signal
or AI-2 conditioned supernatants [31,32]. This is essential
since it is now well recognized that LuxS displays also a
primary role as metabolic enzyme in the activated methyl
cycle (AMC) [11], which is responsible for the generation
of the cell major methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine
(SAM) and the recycling of methionine by detoxification
of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). LuxS takes part in
this cycle by salvaging the homocysteine moiety from the
cycle intermediate S-ribosyl-homocysteine (SRH). As a
by-product of this reaction, the direct AI-2 precursor (S)4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) is formed. In V.
harveyi DPD cyclizes and is spontaneously converted to
furanosyl borate diester by the addition of borate [33],
while S. typhimurium produces and recognizes a chemically distinct form of AI-2 [34] (Fig. 1). Given this dual
nature of LuxS the sole use of the commonly exploited
mutational approach is inappropriate, since a simple
genetic complementation using the intact gene on a plasmid will also repair the induced metabolic unbalance as
well and yield in any case a restored phenotype.
In order to assess whether the role of LuxS in welldescribed bacterial species is effectively related to AI-2
mediated autoinduction (or AI-2 uptake), we performed
a database analysis for established AI-2 receptors in fullysequenced genomes and sequence databases, and com-

pared the outcome with published results about QS-2 in
these bacteria. In this way we were able to corroborate
many reports where the role of LuxS in QS-2 was proven
experimentally (accordingly an AI-2 receptor was found
using our in silico screening) or to confirm results of other
works where no effect related to autoinduction could be
demonstrated (in this case no known receptor could be
discovered in the sequence). On the other hand, in those
cases when an AI-2 mediated mechanism was claimed,
but no known receptor was found in the corresponding
bacterial sequence, novel or alternative receptors must be
postulated or, without a successful chemical complemen-

tation of the luxS mutant, a sheer metabolic role must be
acknowledged.
With the aim of understanding the evolutionary relationships among LuxS, the presence of AI-2 receptors and the
functionality of the QS-2 system, a phylogenetic analysis
was performed to compare the evolution of the luxS gene
with the presence and evolution of the genes coding for
known AI-2 receptors, transporters and regulators. Since
known AI-2 receptors genes are (with very few exceptions)
restricted to luxS-positive bacteria and have only partially
coevolved with the AI-2 synthase, it can be hypothesized

that the QS-2 function was acquired and developed as a
new trait by some bacteria by building upon the preexistent metabolic function of LuxS.

Methods
Search for known AI-2 receptors in complete genomes
Complete genome sequences of bacteria known to have a
luxS gene were analyzed for the presence of AI-2 receptor
sequences using the blastx and the tblastx programs with
a cut-off E-value of 1E-80 by applying a reciprocal best hit
strategy, which allows to distinguish between orthologous and paralogous genes [35]. As starting queries the
luxP gene of V. harveyi strain BB7 (accession number
U07069) and the lsrB gene of E. coli strain K12 (accession
number NC_000913, locus tag b1516) were used. The
hits were manually checked to confirm that they had the

same functional annotation as the query and re-submitted
as novel queries until no new relevant positive match was
found. In this second phase also luxS-negative strains were
included in the analysis by performing a general blast
search across the entire NCBI database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. In bacteria found to carry a gene
coding for an AI-2 receptor the presence of a complete QS2 system was corroborated by verifying the existence of
other genes associated to the respective AI-2 transduction
pathway. Bacterial species were scored as positive for QS2 receptors only when in addition to luxP, homologs of
the luxQ (inner membrane sensor kinase), luxU (twocomponent phosphorelay protein) and luxO (response
regulator) genes which encode the full transduction pathway [12,13] were also found. Similarly, positive results
obtained with lsrB were confirmed by verifying the pres-

receptors, chemical complementation of the luxS mutant
or detection of AI-2 depletion in the culture medium [31].
In cases where these tests were omitted the possibility that
a metabolic dysfunction in the AMC may have been misinterpreted as disruption of type-2 quorum sensing was
proposed.

Our investigation was extended to incomplete sequenced
bacteria known to carry a luxS gene or for which a function
of QS-2 was documented in the literature through an
NCBI database search with relevant terms such as "luxS",
"lsrB", "luxP", "AI-2" or "quorum sensing". Discovered
pertinent sequences were used in the analysis.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed in order to understand how AI-2 receptors may have (co-)evolved in different bacteria with respect to the presence of luxS.
Phylogenetic trees were generated on the basis of complete luxS- and lrsB-sequences without choosing any outgroup. Housekeeping gene rpoB, encoding the RNA
polymerase β-subunit, was used as reference. Retrieved
DNA sequences were aligned with ClustalW [36]. Sites
presenting alignment gaps were excluded from analysis.

the generation of the major methyl donor in the cell, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and the recycling of methionine by

Results
Presence of luxP-type receptor genes
The luxP gene of V. harveyi strain BB7 was used as a starting query for a search of LuxPQ-type receptors in bacterial
genomes that was successful only for members of the
orders of the Vibrionales and, to a much lesser extent, of
the Oceanospirillales. This kind of receptor, along with
the effector kinase LuxQ, was already known in several
species of the genus Vibrio, i.e., V. anguillarum, V. cholerae,
V. fischeri, V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus (see Table 1
and citations therein). In Vibrio species for which a
response to AI-2 system is documented, but in which no
receptor was yet described, i.e., V. vulnificus [38] and V.
alginolyticus [39], we were able to retrieve the luxPQ genes
by searching the relevant gene sequences in the corresponding published genomes. Conversely, the LuxPQreceptor was absent from the genome of V. angustum,
which does not respond to the AI-2 signal [39], even
though the luxS gene coding for S-ribosylhomocysteinase
is present. Besides that, we managed to identify the
LuxPQ receptor complex also in other representatives of
the genus for which no study about QS-2 related phenotype has been performed to date, i.e., V. splendidus, Vibrio

sp. Ex25 and Vibrio sp. MED222, but not in closely related
Photobacterium profundum SS9 (Fig. 2 and Table 3).
A LuxP homolog was found also in the genomes of some
Oceanospirillales, albeit among the bacteria of this order
no luxS gene has been sequenced or found to date. The
similarity of these proteins to the LuxP-receptor present in
V. harveyi was only moderate: 41.2% identity and 71.7%
similarity for the Neptuniibacter caesariensis MED92 periplasmic protein (locus tag: MED92_04774) which carries
a region similar to the RbsB-like ABC-type sugar transport
system receptor locus and 24.5% identity and 61.8% similarity for the Marinomonas sp. MED121 LuxP protein precursor (locus tag: MED121_11334). However, both
results withstood the reciprocal best hit strategy test and
yielded a LuxP protein of Vibrio as best match in a blastx
search. Furthermore, in Neptuniibacter caesariensis MED92
and Marinomonas sp. MED121 the genes encoding these
putative LuxP homologs are arranged in an operon with
presumed transcriptional regulators that likewise contain
PAS domains (locus tags MED92_04779 and
MED121_11339 respectively), but share otherwise little
homology with each other. In Marinomonas sp. MED121,
the transcriptional regulator showed moderate homology
with LuxQ of V. cholerae and contains also AAA-type
ATPase and DNA-binding domains and is followed by the
pfs gene coding for a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (locus tag: MED121_11344). A similar protein
(locus tag Dace_1280) in Desulfuromonas acetoxidans (a δProteobacterium) showed an equivalent identity to LuxP
of V. harveyi (36.2%) and was analogously arranged in an
operon with a putative transcriptional regulator containing PAS domains (locus tag Dace_1279), while in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (also a δ-Proteobacterium) the
matching protein (locus tag Dde_3311, identity 41.0%)
also carries a putative receptor locus but the corresponding gene was not associated with either a luxQ homolog
(or a similar transcriptional regulator) or the other usual
genes of an ABC-transporter, indicating the probable
absence of a signal transduction pathway toward the inner
of the cell. However, also Dace_1280 and Dde_3311
pointed toward LuxP in the reciprocal best hit test. As for
Oceanospirillales, both D. acetoxidans and D. desulfuricans
(both δ-Proteobacteria) were found to lack the luxS gene.
All Vibrionales carrying the luxPQ genes also carried open
reading frames which encoded proteins homologous to
the two component, σ54-specific, transcriptional regulator
LuxUO found in V. harveyi (accession number L26221).
In Oceanospirillales a similar situation was discovered,
but both luxP and luxO were flanked by other transcriptional regulator genes which displayed a less important
resemblance with luxQ and luxU respectively. In all strains
investigated the LuxO protein displayed the characteristic
8-AA glycine-rich consensus (GESGTGKE) which is
needed for interaction with alternative σ54 (data not

shown) [40]. Interestingly, in none of the strains were the
genes encoding the single components of the QS-2 mechanism (luxS, luxPQ and luxUO) found in proximal positions on the genome (data not shown), thus they were
probably acquired and/or developed independently.
Notably the tblastx search using luxP gene of V. harveyi
strain BB7 resulted in local hits with the lsrB gene of
Enterobacteriales (E-values > 1E-10). Similarity is limited
to a small RbsB-like portion on the C-terminus of the
LuxP protein, but is most probably indicative of the substrate (AI-2) binding domain of both receptors. Generally,
the use of luxQ gene of V. harveyi strain BB7 as starting
query yielded multiple partial positive matches in almost
every strain tested, but these were limited to the cytoplasmic transduction domain of other sensor kinases and
were not directly related to any known quorum sensing
related gene (data not shown).
Presence of lsrB-type receptor genes
Our screening of completed genome projects for lsrB, the
gene belonging to the lsr-operon encoding the periplasmic AI-2 binding component of the ABC-type sugar transport apparatus, revealed that this type of receptor is
generally more widely spread than the LuxPQ-system. We
found that lsrB is present both in Gram-negative and in
Gram-positive bacteria, albeit its distribution was not
homogeneous in and among the bacterial orders considered (Fig. 2 and Tables 1, 2, 3). An open reading frame
coding for LsrB was found, for Gram-negative γ-Proteobacteria, essentially only in part of Enterobacteriales (i.e.,
in E. coli, Photorhabdus luminescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Yersinia spp., in Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella flexneri,
and Salmonella spp. with the exception of S. bongori, but
not in S. marcescens, S. glossinidius and in Erwinia spp.) and
of Pasteurellales (i.e., in Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella
multocida and Actinobacillus actimycetemcomitans, but not
in related species such as Haemophilus influenzae or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). No evidence for lsrB was
found in Vibrionales and in the luxS-negative families of
Pseudomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae. No lsrB
homolog was located either in the luxS-positive class of εProteobacteria (Helicobacter, Campylobacter) or in Spirochaetales, in which the presence of luxS was reported to
date only in Borrelia spp. [41].

For Gram-negative α-Proteobacteria, lsrB was found only
on the pSymB-plasmid of Sinorhizobium meliloti and in
three Rhodobacter species, i.e. R. capsulatus (contig hit,
position on the genome unspecified) and on the high variable chromosome-2 of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 and R. sphaeroides ATCC 17029, but was absent from R. sphaeroides
ATCC 17026. These finding are of special interest since αProteobacteria are lacking the luxS gene coding for the Sribosylhomocysteinase/AI-2 synthase.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/154

In Gram-positive bacteria, lsrB was located solely in bacteria belonging to the Bacillus cereus group. B. anthracis, B.
thuringensis, B. weihenstephanensis and B. cereus were found
to carry the lsr-operon (see additional file 2, Figure 1s).
However, in B. weihenstephanensis KBAB4 both lsrB and
lsrD show frameshifts and are listed as pseudogenes, in a
similar way to lsrB of B. thuringensis serovar konkukian 9727 and to the associated ATPase-gene lsrA of non-pathogenic B. cereus ATCC 14579, which is apparently truncated. In B. thuringensis serovar israeliensis ATCC 35646 a
pseudogene with very high homology to part of the lsrBreceptor gene is found well separated from the rest of the
operon (lsrDCARK) suggesting that in the latter strain the
ABC-transporter was inactivated by a rearrangement of the
genome. The lsrB gene could not be identified in closely
related Bacillus cereus ssp. cytotoxis NHV391-88 confirming
a significant degree of divergence from typical B. cereus
[42], which is corroborated also by our luxS-based phylogeny. More distant Bacillus species, including B. subtilis,
were all found to be lsrB-negative (see additional file 2,
Figure 1s) suggesting that in Gram-positive bacteria the
Lsr-transporter was acquired or developed by an ancestor
of the Bacillus cereus group. No lsrB homolog was found in
the Actinobacteria Bifidobacterium longum [11] and Bifidobacterium adolescentis which are so far the only bacteria
besides Escherichia blattae [43], to possess both known
SAH-detoxification pathways (SAH hydrolase and Pfs/
LuxS).
All strains which yielded a positive match for lsrB were further verified by demonstrating the presence of other genes
(lsrDCARKG) encoding the Lsr-complex. However, in
none of the positive matches the luxS gene and the lsr
operon were found to lie in proximal regions of the
genome, suggesting that (as for luxPQ and luxUO in Vibrionales) they were probably acquired and/or developed
independently. On the other hand, in Enterobacteriaceae
luxS is frequently found in association with another gene
involved in sulfur metabolism such as gshA, coding for the
γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (data not shown).
An ambiguous positive match to LsrB (67.1% similarity,
31.4% identity) was obtained for substrate binding protein Atu3487 (accession number NC_003305) on the linear chromosome of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.
However, both the sequence of the receptor and the
organization of the flanking genes in the operon displayed high similarity with the rhamnose catabolism gene
locus of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii plasmid
pRleW14-2c (accession number AF085687) showing that
these genes are probably not involved in quorum sensing.
Similarly, a positive match (23.8% similarity, 19.1% identity) in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae to an uncharacterized conserved protein (locus tag Aple02001327) was
discarded after additional analysis yielded that the

retrieved sequences showed more similarity to E. coli xylF
gene, coding for the membrane receptor protein of the
ABC-type xylose transport system.
Phylogenetic analysis
In order to understand how QS-2 developed in the different bacterial taxa during evolution, a phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing, for those species for
which a QS-2 has been previously described, the presence
of the established AI-2 receptor genes luxP and lsrB to the
tree based on the luxS-gene sequences (Fig. 2). Our results
confirmed the conclusions of a previous work [19] in
which a few species appeared be misplaced on the luxS
tree if compared to species phylogeny and thus to have
acquired the latter gene by an horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) event: these bacteria are β-proteobacterium Neisseria meningiditis, ε-proteobacterium Helicobacter pylori, the
spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and actinobacteria Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Interestingly, however, in none of these bacteria the gene
sequences encoding the LuxP- or LsrB-receptors have been
found, indicating that most probably only the metabolic
function of LuxS, and not a complete QS-2 system, was
transferred.

More generally, as detailed above, the occurrence of luxP
was restricted to Vibrionales, but the gene was not universally present in every species of this order, missing for
instance from Vibrio angustum or Photobacterium profundum. Similarly, the presence of the lsrB-gene was generally
limited to certain species belonging to the Gram-negative
bacterial orders of Enterobacteriales. Pasteurellales, and to
the Gram-negative positive classes of Bacilli and
Clostridia and was not a collective feature of all the members of each group. Most importantly, several species for
which an AI-2 dependent behavior was claimed (Table 3)
were found to be devoid of either receptor genes.
Analysis of lsrB tree (Fig 3) shows that this gene is well distinct from related ABC-receptor genes such as rbsB or xylF.
This result is supported by similar analyses performed on
the other genes coding for the ABC-receptor complexes
(data not shown) and indicates that the Lsr receptor is
ortholog to those ABC-transporters and did not arose by
gene duplication from related sugar transporters in each
single species or genus. The lsrB-phylogeny of luxS-negative species R. sphaeroides,R. capsulatus and S. meliloti
reveals that the Lsr-receptor complex of these α-proteobacteria was probably horizontally acquired from unrelated enterobacterial species. The HGT hypothesis is
further supported by the fact that in these species the
genes coding for the AI-2 receptor are not on the main
chromosome, but are found on dynamic genetic elements
such as a smaller chromosome as in the case of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 or on a plasmid as in S. meliloti 1021.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/154

Taking in consideration only lsrB-positive bacteria, we
finally compared the topology of the phylogenetic trees
based on luxS, lsrB and the housekeeping gene rpoB,
encoding a subunit of the RNA polymerase and which is
commonly used as a molecular marker for microbial evolution studies (Fig. 4). The luxS- and rpoB-trees displayed
a branching pattern which was more similar to each other
than to that of the lsrB-tree, however in the latter most of
the differences were found at local level within single
clades and (if present) they were not supported by high
bootstrap values even when using more rigorous building
methods such as minimum evolution or maximum parsimony (data not shown), indicating the lsrB may have
undergone an HGT only in a limited number of cases.
This result, together with the discrete distribution of lsrB
among luxS-positive bacteria suggests that for luxS- and
lsrB-positive bacteria the AI-2 receptor coevolved with the
SAH-lyase/AI-2 synthase, but that for luxS-negative strains
it was probably acquired by certain species (or their common ancestor) as adaptation to a specific niche.

Discussion
Distribution of LuxPQ sensor kinase
Our search across fully published genomes clearly shows
that the presence of this kind of AI-2 receptors is primarily
limited to a narrow group of bacteria. Corroborating the
results of Sun and coworkers [19] no complete QS-2
receptor complex based on the LuxPQ sensor kinase and
the related signal cascade was found in bacteria not
belonging to the order of Vibrionales. Within the latter
order the presence of luxPQ genes was not ubiquitous, but
was found to be largely in accordance with the responsiveness to AI-2 stimulation and the functionality of the QS-2
system that can be deduced from the literature already
published on this topic (Table 1). No alternative receptor
for AI-2 has been described so far in bacteria belonging to
the Vibrionales. Even if an experimental verification is still
pending, we predict therefore that other sequenced Vibrio
species (i.e., V. splendidus, Vibrio sp. Ex25 and Vibrio sp.
MED222) that carry both LuxS, LuxPQ and LuxUO will
most probably have a functional QS-2 system, while
Photobacterium profundum SS9 will not.

LuxP homologs were also found in luxS-negative Neptuniibacter caesariensis MED92, Marinomonas sp. MED121 and
D. acetoxidans DSM684. Since previous evidence suggests
that AI-2 may also be involved in interspecies gene regulation [44,45] and mixed-species biofilm formation [46], it
is therefore conceivable that some bacteria may be able to
recognize the AI-2 signal even though they are unable to
produce it. The evolutionary benefit would be the opportunity to sense the presence and abundance of AI-2 producers sharing the same niche. Both Neptuniibacter and
Marinomonas are marine bacteria that share the same environment [47] or are associated with the same host as AI-2

producer Vibrio strains [48]. However, given the less
important similarity to the receptor found in Vibrionales
and the different sensor kinase associated this hypothesis
has in any case to be proven experimentally. In the case of
D. desulfuricans, in which the luxP homolog is not physically associated to any gene indicating a signal transduction toward the inner of the cell, the prospect of an AI-2
related QS seems less realistic.

Distribution of Lsr-receptor complex
Although in recent years the activity of QS-2 was repeatedly hypothesized on the basis of the presence and functionality of the luxS gene in several bacterial species not
belonging to the order of Vibrionales, few efforts have
been made to verify the presence of a cognate AI-2 receptor, either experimentally by demonstrating successful
chemical complementation of luxS mutant (using AI-2
containing supernatants) or genetically by showing the
presence of the associated genes in the corresponding bacterial genomes. The only other clearly established AI-2

receptor, the Lsr ABC-transporter was identified so far
only in S. typhimurium [20] and E. coli [21]. For this reason
we examined the genomes of completely sequenced bacteria with a reported quorum sensing activity ascribed to
AI-2 and searched for the presence of DNA-sequences coding for receptor protein LsrB, the extracellular substratebinding component of the Lsr-complex.
The outcome of our investigation was at first glance surprising, since a positive match was found only in part of
Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales and Bacillales (Fig. 2).
However, a more detailed analysis of the results showed
that these were largely congruent with the ability to complement the luxS mutation by the means of chemically
pure AI-2 signal or AI-2 containing supernatants. The lsrB

gene was retrieved exclusively in the genome of bacteria
for which, provided that it was performed in the corresponding study, a chemical complementation yielded a
successful result (Table 1). Conversely, our search for lsrB
did not yield positive results in any of the species in which
exogenous AI-2 was unable to restore the original wildtype phenotype in luxS mutants (Table 2). These results
strongly corroborate the hypothesis that LsrB functions as
receptor for AI-2 and the fact that in many bacteria the
role of LuxS is restricted to the AMC.
In a few cases we were unable to identify either the Lsrreceptor complex or the LuxPQ sensor kinase in the
genome of the corresponding bacteria even if a successful
chemical complementation of the luxS mutant using AI-2

containing fluids was claimed in the literature (Tables 2
and 3), although it must be stressed that for some bacterial species at least one work came to contrasting conclusions and asserted a mere metabolic role for LuxS (Table
2). Strain-specific distribution or functionality of lsr-transporters are in principle possible explanations for this
result. Although the lsr-operon seems to be ubiquitous in
strains belonging to the Bacillus cereus group, in some
non-pathogenic strains (e.g, B. cereus ATCC 14579) or
insect-associated species like B. thuringiensis the sequences
of the lsr-genes revealed frameshifts or rearrangements
that will most likely lead to the production curtailed proteins and non-functional AI-2 receptors. Since in none of
these strains the lsr-operon was completely absent from
the genome, this may be the result of gene deterioration
as a consequence of reduced selective pressure in those
strains not tightly associated with warm-blooded animals.
Alternative receptors
Another option to explain successful chemical complementation of luxS-mutants in bacteria lacking both LuxPQ
or the Lsr-receptor complex is to postulate the presence of
alternative receptors for AI-2. Yoshida and coworkers [49]
were able to complement the defect in biofilm formation
of a Streptococcus mutans luxS mutant by culture media of
other Streptococci or other luxS-positive bacteria which
are normally associated with S. mutans in the human oral
cavity such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, while in a more recent study 59 genes
responsive to AI-2 were identified in the same strain by
global transcriptome analysis [50]. In the latter study, the
product of one of the strong AI-2 upregulated genes
(SMU.408) was hypothesized to act as an uptake mechanism for the autoinducer molecule. The corresponding
protein is a xanthine/uracil/vitamin C permease
(COG2252) and belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. Homologs to this putative
receptor are present in all Streptococcus species for which a
QS-2 related phenotype was described, but also in many
other species, including many for which a conventional
receptor for AI-2 is already known, such as V. vulnificus, B.
anthracis or P. multocida (complete data not shown).

A role as an alternative AI-2 receptor was also suggested
for the ribose ABC-transporter encoded by the rbs-operon.
Stevenson and coworkers speculated that RbsB may serve
as the AI-2 receptor in Borrelia burgdorferi [51], while in
Actinobacillus actionmycetemcomitans both the LsrB and
RbsB proteins were shown to interact with AI-2 molecule
[52]. The AI-2 signal showed differential affinity to two
receptors depending if found as THMF (like in S. typhimurium) or as borate diester (like in V. harveyi) (Fig. 1) leading to the hypothesis that the two receptors may be used
together by the bacteria to scavange borate from the environment [25]. The distribution of the ribose ABC-trans-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/154

porter is almost ubiquitous among most bacterial species
regardless if the luxS- and lsrB-genes are present (data not
shown), so that it is conceivable, although far to be
proved, that RbsB may account for the internalization of
AI-2 in a number of species lacking LsrB.
Host specificity of lsrB-positive bacteria
Interestingly, bacteria that possess a Lsr-receptor complex
are mostly associated with warm-blooded animals. In fact,
this ABC-transporter could not be located in the luxS-positive bacteria S. bongori, which unlike other Salmonella spp.
is usually associated with cold-blooded organisms [53], or
in B. subtilis, which is a soil organism not considered to be
an animal pathogen [54]. Exceptions are represented by
the human pathogens S. boydii and S. sonnei in which the
lsr-genes are absent [55] and insect pathogens B. thuringensis and P. luminescens which conversely feature the Lsrcomplex. The case of P. luminescens is of particular significance since in this bacterium the presence of the lsr-locus
seems restricted to those strains (i.e., TT01, Hb, and C1)
forming a mutualistic consortium with entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, but shows
ample gene deletions in strains associated with other
nematode hosts or in related Xenorhabdus species suggesting that the lsr locus is strongly involved in the bacterial
association with H. bacteriophora [56]. Altogether this data
strongly suggest that AI-2 may be a relevant signal for
many invasive bacteria and that the Lsr-receptor complex
may generally play an important role in host colonization.
Orphan receptors
An unexpected result of our study was the discovery of a
region with high homology to the lsr operon (lsrBDCARKG) (Fig. 5) on chromosome II of two of the three
sequenced strains of the free-living photosynthetic bacterium R. sphaeroides and on plasmid pSymB of nitrogen-fixing plant symbiont S. meliloti 1021. Both bacteria belong
to the α-subdivision of Proteobacteria that regenerates
homocysteine not by the means of the AMC, but directly
from SAH using a one-step reaction catalyzed by SAH
hydrolase. Since they are devoid of the LuxS enzyme they
can not produce the AI-2 signal by themselves and are
thus in principle dumb in the QS-2 language. In both bacteria the genes coding for the Lsr receptor complex are situated not on the main chromosome, but either on a
megaplasmid mainly devoted at the codification of solute
uptake systems in S. meliloti [57] or on a smaller chromosome with much lower information content density than
the main chromosome, which is thought to provide
highly adaptable organisms such as R. sphaeroides with
genetic "safe zones" that allow DNA to change without
affecting the organism itself [58]. The phylogeny of the
lsrB gene (Fig 3) suggest that the AI-2 receptor complex in
R. sphaeroides and S. meliloti was eventually acquired hori-

Comparison
Comparison of the operons coding for the Lsr-like receptors in the luxS-negative α-proteobacteria R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 and S. meliloti 1021 with the lsr cluster of AI-2 producers S. typhimurium and E. coli K12. The lsr-like
operons are located on the highly variable chromosome II of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 (accession number NC_007494) and on the
pSymB megaplasmid of S. meliloti 1021 (NC_003078) respectively. The transporter core is composed of a periplasmic AI-2
binding protein (LsrB), two hydrophobic proteins which for an homodimeric transmembrane channel (LsrC and LsrD) and a
hydrophilic ATP-binding protein (LsrA). The expression of the lsr operon is controlled by repressor protein LsrR and AI-2
kinase LsrK which is responsible for the production of phospho-AI-2, the lsr operon inducer. In S. typhimurium (NC_003197),
the LsrF and LsrG proteins are involved in modifying phospho-AI-2 [21]. For comparison ribose and xylose ABC transporters
of E. coli K12 (NC_000913) are shown below. Proteins with the same function are coded with the same color. As point of reference, locus tags for selected genes are marked inside the arrows.

zontally from unrelated enterobacterial species, such as
e.g. K. pneumoniae which occurs as free-living diazotrophs
in soil, plant endophytes, and as opportunistic human
pathogens [59,60]. It is conceivable that K. pneumoniae
acquired the Lsr receptor from other endotherm associated Enterobacteria and passed it to cohabitant nitrogen
fixing bacteria in soil. Whether the Lsr-complex in R.
sphaeroides and S. meliloti really enables them to react to
the AI-2 signal still has to be proven experimentally, but is
tempting to speculate that these α-Proteobacteria may use
this receptor to eavesdrop on QS-2 communication
employed by K. pneumoniae in soil.
Dual pathways
Contrasting with other Actinobacteria that bear only the
SAH hydrolase for the production of homocysteine using
SAH as substrate, both B. longum and B. adolescentis also
possess luxS in their genome. These species are key commensals of the human gastrointestinal tract and appear to
have acquired luxS by horizontal gene transfer in the gut
from other Gram-positive endotherm-associated bacteria
(Fig 2). The presence of the other genes coding for the
complete AMC and absence of lsrB from the genome of

Bifidobacterium suggest that the additional occurrence of
LuxS in these strains is not aimed to AI-2 production
(albeit an homolog of SMU.408 of S. mutans is present),
but represents only a redundant metabolic pathway for
the recycling of homocysteine as proposed previously
[61]. However, the possibility that an eventual AI-2 signal
may be used for one-way interspecies communication can
not be discounted.
Another non-pathogenic species, E. blattae, was also identified to have both pathways [19], but given its taxonomical classification among Enterobacteriaceae, here the
horizontal gene transfer most probably involved sahH
instead of luxS. As for Bifidobacterium, also in E. blattae the
physiological significance of the double SAH detoxification pathway still awaits clarification.
Phylogenetic analysis
Previous studies have assessed that at the level of bacterial
phyla the phylogenetic tree based on luxS largely corresponds to the one constructed using 16S ribosomal RNA,
demonstrating that the former gene is ancestral in groups
like Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. ε-proteobacterium H.

BMC Microbiology 2008, 8:154

pylori, spirochete B. burgdorferi and actinobacterium B.
longum, which clustered with Firmicutes in the luxS tree,
represented the exception to this criterion indicating that
horizontal gene transfer has occurred in these species [62].
Our result confirm these findings and suggest that also B.
adolescentis, or more probably a common Bifidobacterium
ancestor, may have undergone an HGT (Fig. 2). In order
to understand if and how the AI-2 receptors coevolved
with the AI-2 synthesis gene, we first analyzed the distribution of the recognized receptor genes on the entire luxS
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2), then compared the tree based
on the lsrB receptor with the luxS and rpoB trees of the
matching strains (Fig. 4). As previously reported the presence of the LuxP receptor is fundamentally limited to
Vibrionaceae [19] and its evolution corroborates the fact
that this kind of receptor has been constantly present during the evolution of this family of marine bacteria (Fig. 2).
On the other hand the Lsr complex is widespread (but not
ubiquitous) in Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, as well
as present in two species belonging to the family Pasteurellaceae (i.e., P. multocida and H. somnus). Despite the
fact that these bacterial groups are fairly separate on an
evolutionary level, the branching pattern of the lsrB tree is
mostly concordant with the corresponding tree based on
luxS and housekeeping gene rpoB (Fig. 4), implicating that
this kind of AI-2 receptor genes are probably orthologs
that have co-evolved with the AI-2 producer gene. An
alternative hypothesis postulating the Lsr receptor complex being a paralog of closely related ABC transporter,
such as ribose transporter Rbs, is not supported by the
available data which demonstrate that rbs genes of distant
related species are more similar to each other, than equivalent rbs and lsr genes in the same species (data not
shown). As expected from previous studies on ABC systems [63], also shuffling of genes between different transporters is not supported by phylogenetic analysis (data
not shown).
The fact that in no bacteria the components of the AI-2
receptor and signal transduction pathway are found clustered together with luxS in the genome further suggests
that the QS-2 system was built upon a pre-existent general
metabolic function by some bacteria only, which may
help to explain why it is not an universal feature of all species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/154

by the ability of the wildtype strain supernatants to stimulate luminescence in AI-2 reporter strain V. harveyi
BB170, by the competence of the species-specific luxS
gene to induce AI-2 production when introduced in a
luxS-negative strain such as E. coli DH5α or by in trans
complementation of luxS-mutants to restore the original
phenotype. It is critical to understand that these tests are
in any case insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a
QS-2 based communication. Even for bacteria which are
devoid of a functional QS-2, the V. harveyi reporter assay
will result in a simple test of the activity of the AMC, as AI2 is produced spontaneously from DPD [33,34], which is
a by-product as of this metabolic cycle (Fig. 1).
The complementation of AI-2 production in E. coli DH5α,
which has a defective luxS due to a frameshift-mutation
[64], using a foreign luxS-gene merely proves its functionality, but does not give any indication about the production and most importantly the detection of AI-2 in the
original organism. Finally, any defect induced by the luxS
mutation in the methionine recycling pathway (Fig. 1)
will be in most cases fully restored by the straightforward
genetic complementation [65].
It is thus imperative for QS-2 studies to provide evidence
for AI-2 receptor also include a chemical complementation of the luxS mutant [31], either by using AI-2 conditioned supernatants or by using the chemically defined
AI-2 molecule [32]. New criteria for establishing the functionality of QS-2 in a given species should include also
identification and mutational analysis of putative AI-2
receptors, RNA/protein expression patterns in presence/
absence of the AI-2 signal and, if the latter is transported
inside the cell as in the case of the Lsr receptor complex,
AI-2 consumption profiles. In bacteria lacking the Lsroperon this would enable assessment of the role as alternative AI-2 receptors for related ABC-transporters, e.g.,
ribose Rbs receptor complex [66] or xylose Xyl receptor
complex [67,68]. An alternative approach may consist in
the genetic complementation of the sole metabolic function of the defective luxS gene by replacing it with an exogenous sahH gene encoding the SAH hydrolase, which is
part of the other known S-adenosylhomocysteine detoxification pathway. In this way it is possible to repair the
function of the AMC in E. coli without restoring a potential AI-2 production [69].

Conclusion
Although in order to be able to detect the AI-2 signal and
to react in a QS-2 dependent manner bacteria must carry
an appropriate receptor for the autoinducer, in the light of
our analysis it is apparent that there is still a common misconception in the literature leading to the conclusion that
the mere presence of the luxS gene is a sufficient condition
to deduce the existence of type-2 quorum sensing. In these
works the functionality of LuxS is usually demonstrated

In any case the possibility that some bacteria lacking an
AI-2 receptor either produce AI-2 for interference with signaling of other bacteria or that inadvertently produced AI2 is detected by other bacteria can not be discarded and
may have important ecological implications. Yet, a disease control strategy aimed to interfere with intra- or interspecific QS-2 based crosstalk between bacteria (the socalled quorum quenching), or as a means to enhance QS-

2 in beneficial bacteria, would have hope of success only
for those species which carry a functional AI-2 receptor. As
suggested by Xavier and Bassler [8], this may be true for
many human pathogenic bacteria (e.g., E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp. and Bacillus cereus spp.) for which the presence of the Lsr-receptor
complex was confirmed herein. On the other hand, the
prospective of infection control using AI-2 based quorum
quenching is less concrete for plant diseases, since no AI2 receptor was unambiguously confirmed in specialized
plant pathogens, meaning that in these bacteria the role of
luxS is most probably limited to metabolism.
