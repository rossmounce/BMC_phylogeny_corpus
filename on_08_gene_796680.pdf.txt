Abstract
Background: The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is an important regulator of cytosolic Ca2+ levels.
Many of its structural features are highly conserved across a wide range of species. Invertebrates
have a single NCX gene, whereas vertebrate species have multiple NCX genes as a result of at least
two duplication events. To examine the molecular evolution of NCX genes and understand the role
of duplicated genes in the evolution of the vertebrate NCX gene family, we carried out phylogenetic
analyses of NCX genes and compared NCX gene structures from sequenced genomes and individual
clones.
Results: A single NCX in invertebrates and the protochordate Ciona, and the presence of at least
four NCX genes in the genomes of teleosts, an amphibian, and a reptile suggest that a four member
gene family arose in a basal vertebrate. Extensive examination of mammalian and avian genomes
and synteny analysis argue that NCX4 may be lost in these lineages. Duplicates for NCX1, NCX2,
and NCX4 were found in all sequenced teleost genomes. The presence of seven genes encoding
NCX homologs may provide teleosts with the functional specialization analogous to the alternate
splicing strategy seen with the three NCX mammalian homologs.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NCX4 is present in teleost, amphibian and reptilian
species but has been secondarily and independently lost in mammals and birds. Comparative studies
on conserved vertebrate homologs have provided a possible evolutionary route taken by gene
duplicates subfunctionalization by minimizing homolog number.

Background
The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is an integral membrane
protein belonging to the Ca2+/cation: antiporter (CaCA)
superfamily of protein transporters [1]. Catalyzing the
reversible counter-transport of three Na+ for one Ca2+,
NCX plays a major role in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis

in many tissue types [2] although its role is best understood in the heart [3]. In cardiomyocytes, the exchanger
extrudes Ca2+ from the cytosol thereby allowing relaxation
to occur but it may also function in Ca2+ influx mode
under certain physiological conditions, thereby contributing to cardiomyocyte contraction [4]. There is growing

body of evidence that the role of NCX in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling differs with developmental and
physiological states as well as between species. In the
adult mammalian heart, NCX expression levels increase
during heart failure and arrhythmias as an intrinsic mechanism of cardiac functional compensation, though with
potentially negative side-effects [5]. The expression of
NCX in cardiomyocytes is elevated in neonates, suggesting
a greater role for the exchanger in early developmental
stages [6]. NCX expression also differs among species. For
example, NCX expression in teleosts fish cardiomyocytes
appears higher than other vertebrates [7]. Interpretation
of expression dynamics in physiological, developmental
and evolutionary comparisons is complicated by the
diversity in NCX homologs arising from both splice variants and gene/genome duplications.
NCX is expressed in virtually all tissues across a phylogenetically diverse group of species. Invertebrates appear to
express a single NCX ortholog based upon analyses in
arthropods (fruitfly [8]) and molluscs (squid [9]). The
analysis of vertebrate NCX homologs has focused mainly
on mammals. To date, three NCX genes (NCX1, NCX2
and NCX3) have been cloned and functionally characterized from several mammals including mouse [10], rabbit
[11], guinea pig [12] and dog [13]. NCX1 is expressed
ubiquitously [14], whereas NCX2 [15] and NCX3 [16] are
found exclusively in the brain and skeletal muscle. Expression levels generally correlate with the perceived importance of transmembrane Ca2+ flux in a particular cell type
(i.e., high in cardiac, neuronal, and kidney tissue but relatively low in liver tissue). An NCX1 homolog has been
cloned and characterized in several teleosts including
trout [17], tilapia [18], and zebrafish [19]. We recently
discovered a NCX gene (NCX4) that has been found only
in fish species [20]. Although it has been shown to play a
critical role in zebrafish cardiovascular development [21],
its functionality and transport phenotype are not known.
The protein products of mammalian NCX paralogs range
in size from ~800 – 990 residues and show an overall
identity of ~66%. Identity is especially high in the N- and
C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domains, consisting of
5 and 4 transmembrane segments (TMS), respectively
[22,23]. Within each domain, the α-repeats have been
suggested to be involved in ion translocation. A large
(~550 residues) intracellular loop, which separates the TM
domains, contains components important for NCX regulation, such as exchange inactivation by the XIP site and
Ca2+ binding by the Ca2+ binding domains (CBDs). The Cterminal portion of the loop of NCX1 is subject to extensive alternative splicing in which differential combinations of six exons (A, B, C, D, E and F) produce five welldocumented and abundant splice variants expressed in a
tissue-specific fashion, although other variants may be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/127

expressed at low levels in certain tissues out of a total of
thirty-two possible splice variant exon combinations [24].
The physiological significance of NCX alternative splicing
remains controversial. Schulze et al. [25] observed distinct
voltage dependences between NCX1.1 versus NCX1.3 isoforms whereas Dyck et al. [26] and Hurtado et al. [27]
identified differences between isoforms in Na+-dependent
inactivation induced by an increase in intracellular Ca2+.
Therefore a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of NCX
alternative splicing is needed.
The origin of many vertebrate gene families can be attributed to whole genome duplications (WGD) early in vertebrate evolution [28]. Superimposed on these genomic
events are gene and segmental duplications. The relative
importance of these genomic and gene duplications in
diversity of NCX paralogs is not yet established. Reports of
three NCX paralogs in mammals are consistent with two
rounds of WGD, followed by loss of one paralog. NCX4
has been suggested to be a product of gene/genome duplication after teleost divergence from tetrapods [20]. However, the lack of sequence information from a breadth of
vertebrates has made it difficult to determine the origin of
the vertebrate paralogs. Of particular interest is the origin
of the NCX4 paralog, which to this point had not been
identified in species other than teleosts.
In the current study we build on previous work and
present a clearer picture of NCX molecular evolution. In
addition to protein sequence analysis, closer examination
of NCX gene structure provides insight into the evolutionary origins of the NCX gene family. Since the TMS and specific motifs within the regulatory loop are well conserved
among species, examination of the exon-intron boundaries, gene length, intron density, and alternative splice variation provide opportunities for distinctions between
possible evolutionary trajectories. Through a combination of existing [20] and newly found NCX genomic
sequences, a more complete phylogenetic tree can be
drawn leading to a new hypothesis of NCX gene evolution. These data are consistent with the 1R/2R/3R hypotheses for WGD, generating four NCX paralogs in basal
vertebrates, and additional paralogs in teleosts. One of
these genes, NCX4, is present in the genomes of teleost,
amphibian and reptilian organisms but has likely been
secondarily and independently lost in the mammalian
and avian lineages. In addition, certain features of the
NCX genes have been identified to differ among orthologs
and paralogs.

Results and Discussion
As for most genes, the vast amount of NCX genomic data
and the speed with which it is expanding far surpasses the
availability of cloned and phenotyped NCX cDNAs. In
this study, therefore, we exploit this by making use of bio-

informatics tools to search for NCX sequences in all of the
genomes currently available including those from the
Ensembl browser. Most sequences used in this article are
complete but sequences with > 10% of the amino acids
missing were not used for phylogenetic analyses. NCX
searches were performed in genomes from invertebrates
and vertebrates, augmented by individual clones from
select species (see Table 1).

Gene families in animals arise through gene duplications,
but amongst vertebrates the defining events are a series of
WGD. Within the chordate lineage, the first WGD (1R)
occurred early in vertebrate evolution, around the time of
the divergence of the lamprey and hagfish lineages,
though the exact timing is not yet clear. A second WGD
(2R) occurred prior to the divergence of chondrichthians
and osteichthians. Thus, many genes present as single
copies in protochordates occur as four copies in chon-

drichthians and osteichthians, including the sarcopterygian lineage that gave rise to tetrapods. Within the
osteichthian lineage, a third WGD (3R) occurred prior to
the emergence of teleosts. Thus, an actinopterygian ancestor basal to most teleost fish (including pufferfish,
zebrafish, sticklebacks, and medaka) likely possessed four
copies of each gene. Additional WGDs occurred more
recently in specific vertebrate lineages, such as salmonids
[28]. In many cases, gene family sizes in chordates deviate
from the predicted 1, 2, 4, or 8 members as a result of
duplication or loss of individual genes either before or
after WGDs. Based on our analyses, NCX gene radiation in
chordates is generally consistent with the 1R/2R/3R
hypotheses. However, these studies also call into question
the conclusions from previous work that hypothesized
about the evolutionary origins and phylogenetic distribution of NCX4 in fish and tetrapods.
Invertebrate NCX diversity
Most invertebrate species such as fruitfly, honeybee and
mosquito have only one NCX gene present in their
genomes. A few invertebrate genomes contain several
genes with some similarity to NCX family motifs, but only
one gene found in the genomic sequence appears ancestral to vertebrate NCX genes with at least 40% identity to
mammalian NCX protein sequences. Multiple NCX genes
found in invertebrate genomes are most similar to each
other with no obvious paralog distinction. C. elegans has
various putative NCX genes but two [GenBank:C10G8.5,
Y113G7A.4] have about 45% identity to vertebrate NCX.
Although in Table 1 we label these gene products as C.
elegans1 and C. elegans2 (according to NCBI annotation),
it should be noted that this system does not correspond to
our annotation for vertebrate NCX paralogs. Other putative NCX ESTs (not listed) demonstrated only 15 – 33%
protein identity to mammalian NCX sequences. Similarly,
in the sea urchin (Stongylocentrotus purpuratus), three putative NCX genomic sequences were found but only one
transcript [GenBank:XM_001184049] displays high identity (~55%) with the vertebrate NCX (others had < 35%
identity). Based on the presence/absence of critical motifs,
we predict that most of the putative NCX genes found in
various invertebrate species lack NCX functionality. We
conclude that these genes likely arose from lineage-specific duplications after their divergence from chordates
because they have: 1) low sequence identity to vertebrate
sequences, 2) a lack of conservation in specific amino
acids/motifs critical for Na+/Ca2+ exchange [3] and 3)
weak identity with vertebrate homologs.
Chordate NCX genes
To better determine the timing of NCX duplication events,
we searched the protochordate sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis) genome for the presence of NCX genes. The distinctive
evolutionary position of Ciona as an invertebrate chordate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/127

has been suggested to contain an approximation to the
ancestral match of non-duplicated chordate genes; hence
it may provide insights into vertebrate evolutionary origins [29]. The Ciona NCX genomic sequence is positioned
in all of our phylogenetic trees in a manner that provides
a clear separation of the invertebrate and vertebrate NCX
sequences (Figure 1 and see Additional Files 1 and 2). The
presence of a single copy of an NCX gene in Ciona with
high percent identity to the various NCX genes found in
vertebrates is consistent with previous findings that indicate that the Ciona genome contains every gene that corresponds to a paralogous family in vertebrates for many
signalling molecules, transcription factors and channels
[29,30]. The Ciona NCX genomic sequence displays ~56%
overall identity among vertebrate NCX homologs. Even
though other genes annotated as NCX were found in
Ciona genome, it is hypothesized that these genes evolved
after the divergence of Ciona from other vertebrates as evidenced by their lower sequence identity (~33%) to vertebrate NCX sequences.
Very little useful NCX sequence data are available in
cyclostomes (lamprey and hagfish) and chondrichthians.
In the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), three partial NCX
sequences exhibit a high protein sequence identity to NCX
paralogs with a wide range (51 – 82%) of identity. One
shares high sequence identity with NCX1, another with
NCX4 and the third with both NCX2 and NCX3. However, the limited data prevent definitive assignment as
specific NCX orthologs and thus the nature of the cyclostome NCX gene family remains unclear. The first extant
group to branch from the vertebrate lineage after the 2R
WGD is the chondrichthians. Unfortunately, sequence
available at this time from the elephant shark (Callorynchus milli) was not useful; we found only partial NCX
genomic sequences with large gaps [31]. However, there is
a spiny dogfish (S. acanthias) clone that corresponds to
NCX1 [GenBank:DQ068478].
Analysis of NCX gene family members in osteichthians
and tetrapods is, for the most part, consistent with the 1R/
2R/3R hypotheses. The NJ phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1s supports the notion that the duplication events giving rise to NCX paralogs in vertebrates occurred after the
divergence of the urochordates, which is estimated to be
520 mya [32]. Therefore, from the existence of one NCX
gene in invertebrates, duplication events brought about
four NCX paralogs in basal vertebrates. Hence, the finding
of one NCX gene in Ciona's genome and its positioning in
the phylogenetic tree dividing vertebrate from invertebrate branches correlates with previous evolutionary studies [20]. The structures of the Maximum Likelihood (ML)
(Figure 1) and Maximum Parsimony (MP) (see Additional File 1) phylogenetic trees indicate two parallel
duplications (Figure 2B), which matches the theory of

dual genome duplication (2R) which is postulated to have
occurred early in the vertebrate lineage [33]. These analyses are consistent with double genome duplication, as
observed in the ML/MP phylogenetic trees which show a
symmetric topology resulting in four orthologs. However,
the phylogenetic tree generated using the Neighbour Joining (NJ) algorithm (see Additional File 2) is consistent
with serial NCX duplication (Figure 2A). The serial duplication could also be the result of two genome duplications followed by independent gene duplication and loss
[34]. However, the bulk of the evidence supports the
hypothesis that four NCX genes would be expected due to
the 2R WGD. Thus, remaining questions concern (1) the
anomalous NCX4 pattern within tetrapods and (2) the
diversification of NCX genes in teleosts subsequent to the
3R WGD.

Evolutionary history of NCX4 genes
Previous studies found a fourth vertebrate NCX (NCX4) in
genomes of fugu, tetraodon and zebrafish [20]. In
zebrafish, the predicted sequence of NCX4 on chromosome 7 shows high level of nucleotide identity (> 98%)
with two ESTs [GenBank:BQ263135 and BI875890] and a
cDNA [GenBank:EF470289[21]]. Likewise, the predicted
NCX4 sequence in stickleback is identical to an EST
encoding the NCX4 start coding region up to the XIP site
[GenBank:DT993818] and an EST that contains 876
nucleotides from the alternative splice site to the partial
last exon [GenBank:DT978254]. There are also two partial
sequences from rainbow trout that are similar to fish
NCX4 orthologs (85–92% identity), including an N-terminal region and a C-terminal comprising 159 amino
acids (478 bp) [35]. In this study in which more teleost
genomes were available for examination, NCX4 orthologs
were found in green puffer fish, medaka, and stickleback.
Although the best evidence to date is that NCX4 occurs

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:127

widely within teleost fish, its function remains uncertain.
Knockdown studies with zebrafish NCX4 suggest it is
important during development, playing a role in left-right
patterning [21].
Previous studies suggested that NCX4 occurred in teleosts
but not tetrapods [20]. Thus, it appeared most likely that
teleost NCX4 was a product of either the 3R WGD, or a
duplication of NCX1 in a basal actinopterygian [20].
When the X. tropicalis genome was searched using the
Ensembl browser (v31), NCX tBLASTn searches identified
only three scaffolds with sequences with the highest identity to NCX. The NCX genomic sequences found in scaffolds 684, 572, and 218 were tentatively identified as
NCX1, 2 and 3, respectively. However, a second search in
a later Ensembl version (v32) revealed a fourth NCX
sequence in scaffold 41. We recognized that NCX1 is actually located in scaffold 41 while scaffold 684 contains
NCX4 based on protein sequence alignment (see Additional File 3). Furthermore, the genome of a lizard (Anolis
carolinensis) also possesses four complete NCX genomic
sequences, orthologous to the four sequences found in
amphibian and teleosts. The presence of NCX4 in these
tetrapod genomes argues that NCX4 arose during the 2R
WGD, rather than in a teleost-specific gene or genome
duplication (3R), as previously proposed [20]. With clear
evidence of NCX4 in basal vertebrates, the apparent
absence of the gene in birds and mammals demanded further investigation.
After extensive searches in all available mammalian
genomes for the NCX4 gene, it was concluded that this
gene is not present. For verification, the Evolutionary
Conserved Regions (ECR) Browser [36] was used to find
syntenic links among the teleost and amphibian NCX4
loci with mammalian counterparts. Syntenic alignments
were consistent among the teleost and amphibian NCX4
surrounding genes, but high syntenic alignment with the
mammalian genomic DNA confirmed that NCX4 was
completely eliminated in mammals (Figure 3). Mammals
arose from the synapsid reptiles very early in reptilian evolutionary history. Thus, the presence of NCX4 in a derived
reptile (anole) but not mammals suggests that the mammalian homolog was lost in the synapsid reptilian ancestors of mammals, in cynodonts, or in a basal mammal.
Note that no evidence of NCX4 is found in any mammals
studied, including monotremes.
We also failed to find evidence of NCX4 orthologs in
birds. In our search for NCX genes in the available chicken
genome (Ensembl v34), only NCX1 and NCX3 genomic
sequences were found in their entirety. Synteny analysis of
the complete chicken NCX and neighbouring genes confirmed their identity as NCX1 (on chromosome 3) and
NCX3 (on chromosome 5). Partial high identity NCX

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/127

exons were found in three separate unidentified chromosomes. Synteny analysis for the partial chicken NCX genes
located in an unknown chromosome resulted in alignment with segments corresponding to NCX2 genes in
other organisms. However, the other partial segments of
chicken NCX gene resulted in insignificant synteny alignments probably due to the extensive sequence gaps.
Therefore, the result is still inconclusive and refinement of
the chicken genome will be required to confirm the presence or absence of NCX4 in avian species. If NCX4 was
lost in birds (as in mammals), it must have occurred after
the split between lepidosauromorphs (lizards and snakes)
and archosauromorphs (crocodiles and bird ancestors).
Establishing the exact timing of the NCX4 loss would benefit from analysis of a crocodilian genome.
Gene and genome duplication has long been recognized
as an important factor in the evolution of the complexity
of organismal function and species diversity. The first two
vertebrate WGDs provided species with four sets of
homologous genes upon which evolutionary processes
could act. In many cases, one or more gene became redundant and was/were lost early in lineages, leading to gene
families of three or fewer members in tetrapods. The distribution of NCX4 in vertebrates is unusual in many
respects. First, all four family members were preserved
throughout much of vertebrate evolution. NCX is vital in
the excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes.
Physiologically, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers may differ in electrochemical sensitivity, tissue localization and physiological phenotype. Small differences among each NCX could
provide specific needs to different tissues to species that
are constantly exposed to fast changing and extreme environments. Thus the preservation of all four family members in most vertebrates would argue that selection acted
to preserve the distinct homologs. Thus, the loss of NCX4
in mammals, and possibly in birds, might suggest a loss of
potential for functional specialization. This is surprising
because birds and mammals share the traits of endothermy and high metabolic rate, traits where elevated rates
of ion transport occur, particularly in excitable tissues.
Further studies of NCX4 expression and tissue specificity
would aid in understanding the retention of this gene in
teleost, amphibian, and reptile genomes, as well as the
independent losses in birds and mammals.
3R Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) and teleost NCX
Superimposed on diversity in NCX genes as a result of the
2R WGD is the appearance of additional NCX genes in
fish, likely as a result of the 3R WGD in teleosts [37].
When we searched for other putative NCX paralogs in fish,
duplicates were found for all NCX genes except for NCX3,
bringing the number of potential NCX genes in teleost
species to seven overall (Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 5).
Each duplicate pair shows high conservation patterns in

repeats, XIP site, Ca2+ binding sites, and exon-intron
boundaries.
It is not yet known if the duplicated genes have diverged
sufficiently to acquire distinct functions. Langenbacher et
al. [19] found that the two NCX1 genes in the zebrafish
demonstrated distinct tissue specificities and effects. They
named the NCX1 gene duplicates based on their localization in the developing embryo. NCX1n was predominantly expressed in the brain and neural tube whereas
NCX1h was expressed in heart and played a role in its
rhythmic contraction. An NCX1h knockout causes cardiac

fibrillation. In this report, we redefined the distinction
between teleost NCX duplicate sequences in which "a" is
added to the sequences with the highest identity with
mammalian NCX homologs and "b" to the most distant.
Based upon sequence homologies, NCX1n corresponds to
NCX1a, whereas NCXh is NCX1b.
Our previous studies on the function of NCX homologs
focused on trout because of its importance as a model in
physiological studies. However, salmonids experienced a
lineage-specific WGD [28], and thus there is potential to
have duplicates of genes that were duplicated as a result of
the 3R WGD. We have cloned and characterized a rainbow

trout NCX1 that appears most similar to NCX1b of other
teleosts (see Figure 1). There are ESTs from the rainbow
trout in Genbank that are tentatively identified as NCX1
[GenBank: CX255655, CX255654], but the protein
sequence has too low identity (71%) to correspond to our
NCX1b. However, this EST still has the highest percentage
alignment with NCX1 genes in comparison to the other
three paralogs from other species. It remains to be established if this EST is NCX1a or a salmonid duplicated and
diverged NCX1b variant.
Organization of NCX genes: central variable segment
In addition to using sequence similarities, we examined
NCX gene structure (number of exons, intron density

range, gene length) to further define the evolution of the
NCX gene family. All vertebrate NCX genes possess similarities in exon structure in both N-terminal and C-terminal regions, and a central segment of the gene that varies
more widely among homologs.
In mammalian paralogs, the central variable segment
(involved in alternative splicing) of NCX genes consists of
as many as six exons; NCX1 possesses all six exons,
whereas NCX2 possesses two (BC), and NCX3 four
(ABCE). Superimposed on the variation in the genetic
organization is alternative utilization of the exons in the
formation of splice variants, which are thought to be
important in conferring tissue-specific functional differ-

ences in NCX. When comparing the variable central segment of vertebrate paralogs, all NCX genes possess at least
one exon that is homologous to either exon A or exon B.
Indeed, exons A and B have considerable sequence
homology (e.g. a central acidic region), suggesting that
they arose through a duplication event early in vertebrate
evolution. Based on the sequence similarity (i.e., the maximum likelihood tree), the first WGD event gave rise to
the common ancestor of NCX1 and NCX4 and the common ancestor of NCX2 and NCX3 (Figure 1). Since both
exons (A and B) occur in both mammalian NCX1 and
NCX3 (Table 2), it is likely that the regions were duplicated in a basal vertebrate prior to the 2R WGD. Furthermore, since both exon A and exon B are present in the
mammalian, amphibian, reptilian and teleost orthologs
of NCX1, it argues against a more limited duplication of
this segment in selected lineages. In mammals (where it is
best studied), splice variants of transcripts possess either
exon A or exon B, but not both. The significance of the
mutual exclusivity of exon A and B to construct NCX is not
known, although in general exon A appears in excitable
cells such as cardiomyocytes and exon B is expressed in
non-excitable cells such as kidney [25].
The phylogenetic distribution of the remaining exons (C,
D, E, and F) is much more variable, though there is a general conservation in the number of exons in the central
variable segment of NCX orthologs (Table 2). For example, NCX4 from teleosts, amphibians, and reptiles possess
only exon A; NCX2 from fish, amphibians, reptiles, and
mammals possess only exons B and C. The exon collection for NCX3 orthologs is more variable, with a single
exon (A) in teleosts and birds, and additional exons in
amphibians and reptiles (ABC) and mammals (ABCE).
Exons D and F are present only in NCX1 orthologs, but
they occur in all vertebrates, suggesting these exons arose
in the ancestral NCX1 gene shortly after the appearance of
the four member gene family.
In general, alternative splicing of exons is an important
mechanism to create variation from a single gene. Alternative splicing of exons in the central variable region of NCX
genes is employed to different extents among paralogs
and orthologs. No splice variants are possible for NCX4
where only a single alternative splicing exon occurs (Table
2). There are only two exons in this region of NCX2 (BC)
and no splice variants have been detected in mammals
[24]. In the case of NCX3, teleosts possess only a single
alternative splicing exon, but mammals possess 4 exons
(ABDE) and demonstrate multiple splice variants [24].
There is some evidence of alternative splicing for teleost
variants of NCX1. For example, a cloned rainbow trout
NCX1b cDNA identified as TR-NCX1.0 [17] possessed
sequence corresponding to exons ACDF, but a second
clone (TR-NCX1.1) also contained exon E (unpublished).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/127

While it remains possible that alternatively spliced variants of teleost NCX1 have simply escaped detection, it
appears that splice variants of NCX1 are uncommon in
fish. This is in contrast to the situation that appears to be
seen in mammals, in which splice variants of NCX1 are
common [24]. Thus, in the case of both NCX1 and NCX3,
splice variants are much more common in mammals than
in fish homologs. In the case of NCX1, this difference may
be related to the duplicate copies of NCX 1, however in
the case of NCX3, fish did not retain the duplicated NCX3
gene [38].
Organization of NCX genes: N-terminus
Outside of the central variable segment, vertebrate NCX
paralogs are more highly conserved. It has been reported
that exon boundaries of NCX1 and NCX3 are identical,
each with 5 exons (1 N-terminal, 4 C-terminal) [39].
When comparing across vertebrates, the organization of
the C-terminal exons is highly conserved, with 4 exons in
all NCX genes. In contrast, the N-terminus is more variable, and potentially useful for assessing the evolution of
the NCX family. Amongst the tetrapods, the predominate
pattern is a single N-terminal exon. This is seen in NCX1
and NCX3 of mammals (though NCX2 has 3 exons), and
all four NCX genes in amphibians (Figure 4). In contrast
to the conservation seen in tetrapods, the pattern seen in
teleosts in much more variable. Although the N terminus
of NCX1b and NCX3 possess a single exon, NCX1a and
NCX4a have 1–3 exons, NCX2a has 4 to 8 exons, and
NCX4b has 3 to 10 exons. Danio NCX homologs generally
have fewer exons in the N-terminus than do the other teleost NCX sequences (Figure 4 and Figure 5).

Based on these limited analyses, it is difficult to determine
the factors that drive the variation in N-terminal gene
structure in fish. The conservation seen in the gene organization of NCX3 is unusual, with a ubiquitous single Nterminal exon seen across fish, or for that matter, across
vertebrates. It is also the only member of the NCX gene
family that lacks a duplicate version in fish. In contrast,
the three members that were duplicated in fish each demonstrate variation among orthologs and duplicates. Thus,
it appears that the 3R duplication of ancestral genes (each
with single N-terminal exons) created a tolerance for
genetic rearrangements in this region of the NCX genes in
the resultant duplicates.
Organization of NCX genes: gene lengths and intron
density
Without accounting for the 5' and 3' untranslated regions
(which are mostly unknown), mammalian and reptilian
NCX1 and NCX3 genes average 290 and 135 kb in length
in their genomes, respectively, and represent the longest
NCX genes across species while mammalian NCX2 average 30 kb. However, the teleost, amphibian and reptilian

kb close to the NCX4a gene and NCX4b at 30 kb. However
the avian, amphibian and teleost NCX1 and NCX3 are
greatly reduced in length in comparison to mammalian
versions averaging 103 and 65 kb, respectively. Only
NCX1b demonstrates a shorter gene length pattern in
comparison to NCX1a across teleost species with an aver-

age of 10 kb. Invertebrate NCX gene lengths ranged from
7 to 90 kb.
To quantify the evolution of introns, the intron density
equation (number of introns per kb of coding sequence)
was used to measure the number of introns per NCX gene
[40]. As shown in Table 3, all teleost NCX2 exhibit 2 – 4
introns per kb and NCX4 has 2 – 5 introns per kb and all
species demonstrate a wide range in intron density. Meanwhile, intron density among all mammals, bird, amphibian, reptile and zebrafish NCX1a maintain a consistent
value of 1 intron per kb and the rest of the teleost NCX1a
intron density is consistent at 2 – 3 introns per kb. Also,
NCX3 gene intron density is preserved among all species
at 1 intron per kb. As for the frog, lizard and chicken, all
known NCX genes within these species contain an average
of 1 intron per kb.
The results from both NCX gene lengths and intron density demonstrate a correlation of similarities of NCX2 with
NCX4 that differentiate them from NCX1 and NCX3.
Exon-intron boundary and intron density high variations
could indicate that NCX2 and NCX4 are genes with a
higher rate of mutation in comparison to NCX1 and
NCX3, which are more conserved and consistent. Gene
length comparisons showed more compactness in NCX2
and NCX4, similar to sea squirt and most invertebrate
NCX genes. These differences noted in NCX gene structure
may shed light about their adaptation and evolutionary
patterns.

Conclusion
Rapid growth in the number of sequenced genomes has
made it possible to identify a large number of NCX genes
in many species. Although most NCX expression and
function has been characterized from mammalian organisms, NCX gene presence and conservation is seen among
a great variety of animal sequenced genomes. NCX pres-

ence in all species' sequenced genomes has allowed the
construction of a phylogenetic tree that correlated to animal evolution and revealed that the origin of NCX duplication was initiated at the emergence of vertebrate
organisms. From this duplication, at least four paralogs
are hypothesized to have resulted and these have been
found in teleost, amphibian and reptilian genomes, however we postulate that only three endured in mammalian
genomes. Also, duplicate forms of these NCX genes have
been found only in teleost genomes that correlate with the
isolated genome duplication in ray-finned fish [38].
The presence of the NCX4 gene, found only in teleost, reptile and amphibian genomes, indicates that NCX duplicated at least three times after the tunicates (i.e.: Ciona)
and before the emergence of teleosts. The maintenance of
NCX4 in teleosts may indicate specific demands significant for efficient and different Na+/Ca2+ exchange in
organisms with NCX4. It has been recently demonstrated
that NCX4 is expressed in the zebrafish [21] but characterization of its Na+/Ca2+ exchange and tissue localization
requires exploration. As for the duplicate NCX genes in
teleosts, only one NCX1a from the zebrafish [19] and
three NCX1b have been cloned and demonstrated to be
functional in cardiac tissue in zebrafish [19], trout [17]
and tilapia [18]. Zebrafish is the only teleost in which
both NCX1 have been cloned from cardiac (NCX1h/
NCX1b) [GenBank:AY934775] and neural tissues
(NCX1n/NCX1a) [GenBank:AY934776] [19]. The NCX
gene redundancies in teleosts may indicate subfunctionality and substitute usage of alternative splicing exons as
seen in mammalian organisms that have only three NCX
genes.
When NCX sequences are compared among all species,
the main areas of conservation (i.e.: TMS and regulatory
sites) can be observed. These phylogeny studies can provide an overall evolution of the NCX gene family. How-

ever, with further gene structure analysis, this report
pinpoints the N-terminus segment including the central
variable segment to be the main part of the protein to
adapt to the requirements of environmental changes as
organisms evolve. This is seen in our previous reports [41]
in which temperature dependence comparisons between
a mammalian and rainbow trout NCX1 differ due to
sequences differences in the NH2-terminal transmembrane segment.

Materials and Methods
Data Mining of NCX sequences
tBLASTn searches were performed using known NCX protein sequences in available genome sequences in
ENSEMBL database. Predicted and mRNA sequences of
interest have yielded over 100 candidate genes for NCXs
from GenBank, Ensembl, University of California, Santa
Cruz Genome browser, and Elephant Shark genome
project website [31]. Species names, gene names and location are listed in Table 1. The available genomic sequences
of invertebrate and vertebrate species were analyzed to
identify homologous NCX sequences. Due to some inaccuracies and missed annotations of NCX genes in
Ensembl, the tBLASTn search method was utilized to find/
correct predicted exons and complete segmented NCX
protein sequences with cloned mammalian NCX protein
sequences. Identification of candidate NCX sequences was
based on conservation within the 9 TMSs, α-repeats and
regulatory sites, originally established by known
sequences. Hence, we have been able to categorize and/or
complete over 35 NCX protein sequences in 10 different
species' genomes.

Targeted databases included: the non-redundant protein
and nucleotide databases at NCBI BLAST [42] and the
Ensembl Genome Browser v31–v34 and v39 [43] as seen
in Table 1. The NCX ESTs (expressed sequenced tags) and
clones were obtained from NCBI Nucleotide database
[44]. The lizard (Feb.2007) sequences were obtained from
the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome
Browser [45].
Phylogenetic analyses
To understand the origins of the eukaryotic NCX family,
we performed a phylogenetic study of all NCX sequences
from all species. Multiple sequence alignments and bootstrapped Neighbour-Joining rooted trees were prepared
using ClustalX (v. 1.83) [46]; alignments were manually
edited with Genedoc to remove the alternative spliced
exons and visualized with TreeView32. Bootstrapping was
performed (1000 replicates), and most nodes demonstrated high confidence values. PHYLIP-3.63 (.)[47] was
used to construct 1000 Maximum Parsimony trees and
PHYML online [48] was used to obtain 500 Maximum
Likelihood trees and a consensus tree for each algorithm

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/127

is shown with TreeView32. Protein sequence names were
assigned according to species scientific name and NCX
homolog number (i.e. = human NCX1 is labelled as H.
sapiens1). Incomplete NCX sequences missing over 10%
of the total amino acids were not included in the phylogenetic tree although some are listed in Table 1. A related
NCX from the bacterium pirellula (Rhodopirellula baltica)
was used as the outgroup to root the phylogenetic tree.
Synteny alignment
The Ensembl database and Evolutionarily Conserved
Regions (ECR) browser [49] were used to locate syntenic
regions among teleost, avian, and mammalian genomes.
In the ECR browser, a scaffold section known to contain
the NCX4 gene flanked by a minimum of 30,000 base
pairs was used to align with all other available genomes to
find synteny patterns. The Ensembl database was used to
find the predicted orthologs in the genomic regions found
in the ECR browser.
