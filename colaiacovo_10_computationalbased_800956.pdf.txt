A computational-based update on microRNAs
and their targets in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)

Abstract
Background: Many plant species have been investigated in the last years for the identification and characterization
of the corresponding miRNAs, nevertheless extensive studies are not yet available on barley (at the time of this
writing). To extend and to update information on miRNAs and their targets in barley and to identify candidate
polymorphisms at miRNA target sites, the features of previously known plant miRNAs have been used to
systematically search for barley miRNA homologues and targets in the publicly available ESTs database. Matching
sequences have then been related to Unigene clusters on which most of this study was based.
Results: One hundred-fifty-six microRNA mature sequences belonging to 50 miRNA families have been found to
significantly match at least one EST sequence in barley. As expected on the basis of phylogenetic relations, miRNAs
putatively orthologous to those of Triticum are significantly over-represented inside the set of identified barley
microRNA mature sequences. Many previously known and several putatively new miRNA/target pairs have been
identified. When the predicted microRNA targets were grouped into functional categories, biological processes
previously known to be regulated by miRNAs, such as development and response to biotic and abiotic stress, have
been highlighted and most of the target molecular functions were related to transcription regulation. Candidate
microRNA coding genes have been reported and genetic variation (SNPs/indels) both in functional regions of
putative miRNAs (mature sequence) and at miRNA target sites has been found.
Conclusions: This study has provided an update of the information on barley miRNAs and their targets
representing a foundation for future studies. Many of previously known plant microRNAs have homologues in
barley with expected important roles during development, nutrient deprivation, biotic and abiotic stress response
and other important physiological processes. Putative polymorphisms at miRNA target sites have been identified
and they can represent an interesting source for the identification of functional genetic variability.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small
RNAs with fundamental roles in key plant biological
processes such as development, signal transduction and
environmental stress response [1]. miRNAs act on gene
regulation at post-transcriptional level, a phenomenon
known in plants as PTGS (Post Transcriptional Gene
Silencing), through sequence-based interaction with target mRNAs.
Many plant species have been investigated during
recent years for miRNAs identification and characterization. The current information available on barley refers
to two papers [2,3]. In particular, the paper of Dryanova
* Correspondence: moreno.colaiacovo@entecra.it
CRA-Genomics Research Centre, via S.Protaso 302, I-29107 Fiorenzuola d’Arda
(Pc), Italy

et al. reports detailed information on both targets and
miRNA coding sequences from Hordeum vulgare and
for other members of Triticeae tribe, to which barley
belongs [2]. However, extensive studies describing the
organization of miRNA families, specifically in barley,
are not yet available (at the time of this writing) and no
miRNAs have been deposited in the publicly available
miRNA database (miRBase, http://www.mirbase.org),
this despite the economic importance of barley and its
role as model species for Triticeae [4].
The conservation of miRNA sequences across species
provides a powerful tool for the identification of novel
miRNA genes based on homology with miRNAs previously described in other species. Search based on evolutionary conservation has allowed the identification of
miRNA families in many plant species, including those

where the complete genome sequence is not available, as it
is currently the case of barley. Without genome sequence
information a powerful alternative data source comes
from ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags): currently 501,616
ESTs are available in barley http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
dbEST/dbEST_summary.html [5].
The identification of target genes is a fundamental
step for the determination of the biological function of
microRNAs, besides being an indirect evidence for their
existence. Evolutionary conserved targets have proven
very helpful to test the effectiveness of miRNA target
detection. The perfect or near perfect complementarity
between a miRNA and its target mRNA, that is a peculiar feature of plant miRNAs, gives a powerful tool for
the identification of target genes through BLAST analysis of miRNA mature sequences vs EST/genomic
sequences. A large part of the “in silico” predicted targets have then been confirmed as bona fide targets by
experimental approaches including Northern, 5’-RACE
and, more recently, degradome analysis via NGS (Next
Generation Sequencing) [6,7].
The correct binding of miRNA to its cognate mRNA
is critical for regulating the mRNA level and protein
expression. This binding can be affected by singlenucleotide polymorphisms or indels in the miRNA target site leading to the suppression of existing binding
sites or the generation of illegitimate ones. Therefore,
small polymorphisms in miRNA targets can have a relevant effect on gene and protein expression and represent a type of genetic variability that can influence
agronomical traits. As an example, overexpression of
miR156b and miR156h in rice results in severe dwarfism, strongly reduced panicle size and delayed heading
date [8].
To extend and to update information about miRNAs
and their targets in barley and to identify candidate
polymorphisms at microRNA target sites, barley EST
sequences have been screened and related to Unigene
clusters. UniGene is an experimental system for partitioning transcript sequences into a non-redundant set of
gene-oriented clusters. Thus each UniGene cluster contains sequences that appear to come from the same
transcription locus (gene or expressed pseudogene)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/index.html.
Mining SNPs from ESTs allows the exploitation of
genetic variability based on published sequences and the
analysis of Unigene clusters can be very helpful for this
purpose [9].

Results and Discussion
Barley miRNAs

Since only mature miRNA sequences rather than precursor sequences are conserved among plant species,
mature miRNA sequences have been used as queries for

Page 2 of 15

BLAST search against Hordeum vulgare ESTs [10]. One
hundred-fifty-six microRNA mature sequences belonging to 50 miRNA families have been found to significantly match at least one EST sequence in barley (the
total number of matching ESTs was 855 - as reported in
additional files 1 and 2) and could actually be related
both to target or miRNA sequences, even if the probability is lower for the latter. Indeed the estimated frequency of pri-miRNAs in T. aestivum EST collection is
as low as 0.003% [2].
The results illustrated above have been compared with
those reported by Dryanova et al. where miRNAs and
their targets have been searched in the Triticeae tribe
[2]. Among the 33 miRNA families identified by Dryanova et al. in at least one species of the Triticeae tribe,
22 families were found in barley and 17 of them overlap
with the present findings. Regarding barley, some
miRNA families were found in just one of the two
papers. Dryanova et al. found evidences for 5 additional
miRNA families while the present work has found evidences in barley for miR390 and miR396 previously
reported only in T. aestivum, and for additional 31
families not found by Dryanova et al. in anyone of the
investigated species (i.e. miR442, miR529). The reasons
for these discrepancies can be ascribed to the different
miRBase release used (miRBase Release 8.0 for Dryanova
et al., 2008 and miRBase Release 13.0 in the present
work) and partially to differences in the BLAST settings
adopted. Monocot-specific miRNAs (i.e. miR444) have
also been found in both works [11].
Statistical analysis was employed to identify over and
under-represented plant species from which the corresponding barley miRNA comes from. As reported in
table 1 and 2, barley miRNA sequences putative orthologous to those of Triticum are significantly overrepresented in our data also when very stringent pvalue, e.g. 0.001, was used. Hordeum and Triticum genera are both members of the Poaceae family, Pooideae
subfamily, Triticeae tribe. H. vulgare is often used as a
model species for Triticeae, thanks to its diploid genome
that could facilitate genome-wide searches of miRNAs.
Zea mays is also closely related to barley being part of
monocot group and Poaceae family. Oryza sativa
although is part of Poaceae family is under-represented,
when a low stringent p-value (0.05) was used.
Some ESTs have matched to more than one miRNAs
belonging either to the same family or to different
families (additional file 3). The first case can be due to
the high level of similarity among mature sequences
from different members of the same family, while ESTs
matching to different miRNA families could represent
examples of multi-microRNA based control.
Transcripts targeted by more than one miRNA have
also been found also in other plant species such as rice

[12]. These findings are common in animals where
many different miRNAs recognize the same target
mRNA, usually at the 3’UTR [13].
To identify and annotate potential microRNA-regulated genes in barley, the 855 matching ESTs were
related to Unigene clusters. Clusters annotated as protein-coding sequences were then selected for subsequent
analysis and listed in tables 3 and 4. A total of 121 different Unigene clusters putatively representing the targets for 37 miRNA families has been found. Similar
results (e.g. on average more than 1 putative target/
miRNA family) were reported by Zhang et al. in maize
(115 target for 26 miRNA families) [14]. Sometimes different targets for a specific miRNA are members of the
same gene family (e.g. miR156-SBP family), while in
other cases there is no evident relationship among the
putative targets of a given miRNA (e.g. miR1121). Previous studies report six targets or fewer for most Arabidopsis miRNAs, a number significantly lower than in

animals, for example, in Drosophila each miRNA has on
average over 50 predicted targets [13,15].
Although several of the candidate miRNA/target pairs
here identified have the same functional annotation
reported in previously studied species (table 3) and specifically in barley some putative novel microRNA/target
pairs have been discovered (table 4) [2]. Actually, some
of these novel targets were reported by literature as
regulated by a different microRNA. Most of the novel
miRNA/target pairs refer to miRNAs recently discovered
and thus probably less studied (i.e. miR1120, miR1122,
miR1134). The Argonaute-like protein found as a novel
target for miR408 in H.vulgare by Dryanova et al. has
been confirmed also in the present work.
Transcription factor families comprise most of the
highly conserved miRNA targets (see table 3) such as
SBP family for miRNA 156, AP2 family for miR172,
GRAS family for miR171, myb family for miR159, GRF
family for miR396 and ARF family for miR160. These

results confirmed what previously observed in Triticeae
and in other species [2]. In rice about 70% of conserved
miRNA targets are transcription factors, while in wheat
one-third of the predicted targets was found to encode
for transcription factors [11,12]. Conserved miRNAs
also target genes involved in their own biogenesis and
function: as an example miR168 targets AGO1 which is
part of the RISC complex responsible for the miRNAmediated mRNA cleavage [15]. miRNA regulate gene
expression also by targeting enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 and
TIR1/ubiquitin ligase): barley miR393, miR399,
miR1128, miR1133, miR1135 can be considered putative
regulators of gene expression at protein level.
The number of target genes identified as different
Unigene clusters (tables 3-4) is very different among the
miRNA families. In rice Zhou et al. have found a high
number of targets for miR156 and miR396 and a low
number for miR162, miR167, miR395, miR398 and
miR399 [12]. This finding could indicate that the former
miRNAs are nodes in gene regulation networks, while
the latter could act on specialized pathways.
The predicted targets have been grouped into functional categories and reported in figures 1 and 2 where
the target annotations based on GO terms are shown.
Biological processes known to be regulated by miRNAs,
such as development and response to biotic and abiotic
stress, have been highlighted both in known (figure 1a)
and in novel targets (figure 2a). Moreover, most of the
molecular functions are related to transcriptional regulation and DNA/nucleotide binding in both groups
(figures 1b-2b). These findings suggest that the

predicted target genes can be considered a reliable dataset to be used in subsequent analysis.
For some Unigene clusters the annotation was related
to transcribed genes rather than protein coding
sequences. These Unigenes could represent miRNAcoding genes as shown by other authors [16,17]. Table 5
reports the Unigene clusters candidate to encode
miRNA coding genes on the basis of the precursor
sequence secondary structure (MFEI >0.85, see Materials and Methods) and of the presence of the miRNA*
(miRNA passenger sequence). It cannot be excluded
that the clusters unable to fold with a miRNA-like
structure (e.g. Hv.8579, Hv.11623) are false negatives for
several reasons, such as truncated precursor sequences
in EST database. Putative microRNA sequences have
also been BLASTed against previously known precursors
available from mirBASE: the analysis found similarities
with 6 different miRNA families. The secondary structures of the putative microRNA precursors are reported
in the additional file 4. Linking together sequences containing miRNA precursors from Dryanova et al. and
from the present work, information on several microRNA putative secondary structures, belonging to 10
miRNA families are now available [2]. The mature miRNAs predicted from these data are 18 to 24 nt long,
with a higher frequency for 20 and 21 nt.
Genetic variation at miRNA target sites

A single nucleotide change in the sequence of a target
site can affect miRNA regulation: as a consequence
naturally occurring SNPs in target sites are candidates
for relevant functional variations. Nair et al. established

a perfect association between a SNP at the miR172 targeting site and cleistogamy in barley [18]. Overall few
papers have been published to date describing variations
among plant genotypes at miRNAs and their target
sites, while plenty of information is available for humans
[19-23]. Genome-wide studies in humans have shown
that the levels of polymorphism at miRNA and miRNA
target sites are lower than at coding or neutral regions,
however beneficial miRNA-target site polymorphisms
also exist [19].
In this study, publicly available SNP data have been
analyzed in context with miRNAs and their target sites.
EST-derived SNPs can provide a rich source of biologically useful genetic variation due to the redundancy of
gene sequence, the diversity of genotypes present in the
databases and the fact that each putative polymorphism
is associated with an expressed gene. Variations both in
functional regions of putative miRNAs (mature
sequence) and at miRNA target sites have been found.
Previous works in human have highlighted a relatively
low level of variation in functional microRNA regions
and an appreciable level of variation at target sites [21].
Hv.5064, the candidate for miR1137 coding sequence,
has been tested for modifications of pre-miRNA structure due to a base substitution in position 13 (C/G,
table 6, figure 3). To evaluate the possible impact of this
SNP on pre-miRNA secondary structure, Gibbs free
energy (ΔG) and MFEI from each version of premiRNA were calculated using mfold program. Data in
figure 3 show the structural variation obtained when
moving from “C variant” to “G variant” with a higher
MFEI for the second one and thus a greater stability of
the molecule (miRNA-miRNA* pairing enhanced in the
G variant). Difference in ΔG moving from C to G and
vice versa were calculated according to Ehrenreich and

Oryza sativa [48]

Purugganan [19]. ΔΔG was +1.3 for the former change
and -1.3 for the latter suggesting that some SNPs can
stabilize/destabilize pre-miRNA structure. No target
gene has been reported in literature for miR1137.
In plants most of the miRNA-based regulation relies
on the cleavage of target mRNAs that normally occurs
at the tenth nucleotide of the complementary region
and numerous studies on miRNA-target interaction
have highlighted the importance of positions 2 to 12,
more frequently 10 and 11 [24]. Although most of the
putative polymorphisms highlighted in this work are
outside those critical positions, several examples of
putative functionally relevant polymorphisms have been
detected. Table 6 reports the putative polymorphisms
detected after comparison among EST sequences inside
Unigene clusters, without any selection against false
positives. Some of these nucleotide variation could be
due to sequencing errors or related to very similar genes
belonging to a specific family, nevertheless when the
SNPs/indels rely on two or more copies of independent
sequences it can be considered a good candidate for a
true positive polymorphic target site [25]. For example,
a polymorphism in miRNA 408 target site detected by
AutoSNP in contig 2094 (coding for a plastocyanin) is
based on sequences from two different cultivars reporting the same allelic variant as part of a haplotype where
a SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) polymorphism is
located upstream the target sequence (figure 4). Some
polymorphisms also showed an evolutionary conserved
position, the nucleotide variation identified in Hv.2498
(targeted by miR393) has also been found in the orthologous gene of Arabidopsis in the same position by
Ehrenreich and Purugganan [19].

screening of barley databases has identified two SBP genes
targeted by miR156 for which two nucleotide variations
occur in critical positions (11-12). If these SNPs will be
experimentally confirmed, they could have the effect of
destabilizing the interaction between the miRNA and the
mRNA, which could consequently avoids cleavage and
lead to phenotypical variations in developmental features
or in the resistance to viral infection.
A SNP also occurs in a crucial point of the experimentally confirmed NAC1 target for miR164. NAC1 is a transcription factor involved in shoot apical meristem
formation and auxin-mediated lateral root formation.
Guo et al. showed that the overexpression of miR164
leads to reduced lateral rooting; conversely the disruption
of the regulation mediated by this miRNA increases the
number of lateral roots [28]. The authors have reported
that miR164 directs cleavage in vivo at a position

complementary to the 10th nucleotide from the 5’ end of
the mature sequence [28]. The SNP found in barley is in
the 11th position, therefore it is likely to prevent the cleavage and produce phenotypic effects on root
development.
SNPs have been identified also in other two conserved
miRNA targets, TIR1 and AGO4, targeted respectively
by miR393 and miR408. TIR1 is an auxin-receptor negatively regulated by miRNAs in response to bacterial flagellin, as a defence mechanism against Pseudomonas
syringae [29]. AGO4 is a protein involved in the siRNA
mediated gene silencing, and it is required for the resistance to the same pathogen [30]. Therefore, miR393 and
miR408 are likely to work in a coupled manner during
P. syringae infection. The two SNPs identified are in the
12 th position and could potentially alter the levels of
pathogens resistance.

For each cluster, the table shows details about the putative precursors: the free energy ΔG, the minimal folding free energy index (MFEI), the number of
mismatches in miRNA/miRNA* duplex (NM), the mature length (ML), the precursor length (PL) and the location of mature miRNA (3’ or 5’). Moreover, it is also
reported the more similar known precursor in miRBase, with the alignment score and p-value.

SNPs were also found in previously not reported
miRNA targets, such as the AWPM-19-like protein
matching to the miRNA 1134. AWPM-19 accumulates
in wheat plasma membrane during cold acclimation in
response to abscisic acid [31]. If this miRNA really controls the synthesis of this protein, a deleterious SNP in
the 11th position could then change resistance to cold
stress.

Conclusions
This study has thus provided an update of the information on barley miRNAs and their targets representing a
foundation for future studies.
Novel putative target genes have been identified and
most of them are involved in stress and hormone
response. Indeed, the role of plant miRNAs in abiotic
and biotic stress response as well as in auxin signalling is
well known [32,33]. In particular, protein kinases such as
protein kinase C and serine/threonine kinase, known to
be important regulator on abiotic stress resistance, are
largely present in novel microRNA/target pairs identified.
The results have also shown that microRNA target
sites can be an interesting source for the identification
of functional genetic variability, representing an interesting source of candidate molecular markers for application in barley breeding. Putative polymorphisms have
now to be verified by amplification and sequencing of
the target sequences on a larger set of genotypes.
Sequence analysis based on known miRNAs can obviously
give insights only on conserved mRNAs and related targets.
Future work will thus be based on the construction of a
degradome library for parallel analysis of RNA end (PARE),

a powerful approach for high-throughput identification/validation of conserved and non conserved targets.

Methods
miRNA reference dataset

The initial miRNA dataset has been obtained by extracting the mature sequences (1929 entries) of the Viridiplantae group from the miRBase release 13 http://
www.mirbase.org[34]. By removing identical mature
sequences, the size of this dataset has been subsequently
reduced to 1014 non-redundant sequences related to
468 miRNA families.
Searching for mature miRNAs matching sequences in
barley

The full collection of non-redundant mature miRNA
sequences was used in a BLASTn search against dbEST
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, accepting a number of
mismatch lower than 4.
The set of miRNA mature sequences (including the
identical sequences removed at the first step of the
work) with at least one matching EST have been classified on the basis of the species of origin. The binomial
distribution was used to assess the statistical significance for the represented plant species; this allowed
identifying those species chosen from the initial dataset
more or less frequently than random. Four different
thresholds for the p-values were applied (0.05, 0.01,
0.005, 0.001).
Matching ESTs have then been related to Unigene clusters and the corresponding annotations were recorded (if
available). The GO slimmer tool available on the Gene

Letters in bold refer to SNPs represented by at least two independent sequences, while the numbers in brackets refer to the position of the SNP in the
sequence. Plus means insertion, minus means deletion.

Figure 3 Predicted secondary structures of the two variants of the miR1137 precursor identified in the Unigene cluster Hv.5064. The
variants with a C and a G in the 13th position are respectively reported in the left and in the right side of the figure. The table shows for each
variant: the free energy ΔG, the length of the precursor, the GC content, the MFEI (Minimal Folding Energy Index), the number of mismatches
between the mature sequence and the paired miRNA* passenger and the arm of the hairpin where the mature sequence is located.

Figure 4 SNP identified in contig2094 within the target site for miRNA 408. In this multiple alignment performed with AutoSNP, two
cultivars (Optic and Morex) report the same allelic variant as part of a haplotype including a SSR polymorphism located upstream the target
sequence.

Ontology website http://www.geneontology.org has been
used to identify the GO slim terms more represented in
the set of potential targets on the basis of the Unigene
cluster annotations. For this analysis the Plant GO Slim
subset has been used.
Identification of putative miRNA precursors

True miRNA precursors should have both a mature
sequence on one arm of the hairpin and a paired passenger sequence (called miRNA*) on the opposite arm.
To assess these features the precursor sequences were
extracted from the consensus sequences, obtained by
the Sequencer Software (Gene Codes) on Unigene cluster assemblies, by cutting 13 nt before the 5’ hit and 13
nt after the 3’ hit, since this region (called the pri-extension region of the hairpin) was recently shown to have
this average length in plants [35]. In order to predict the
secondary structure of the precursors, the software
mfold 3.2, free available at http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/
cgi-bin/rna-form1.cgi, was used [36]. The minimal folding free energy index (MFEI) and the GC content were
calculated for each sequence.
All the sequences with a MFEI greater than 0.85 were
considered potential miRNA precursors [37]; besides,
only 4 mismatches were allowed between the mature
sequence and the passenger sequence, and only few and
small asymmetric bulges were accepted [38].
Identification of SNPs/indels at miRNA target sites

Polymorphisms in target genes have been searched
through a comparison of the ESTs belonging to the
same Unigene cluster. Each cluster has been assembled
by Sequencer Software (Gene Codes) and polymorphisms have been searched on miRNA complementary
sequence sites.
AutoSNP database http://autosnpdb.qfab.org.au was
also screened using target gene annotations as contigsearching keywords.

Additional material
Additional file 1: BLAST results. Alignments identified between plant
miRNAs and barley ESTs.
Additional file 2: Barley mature miRNA sequences. Aligned barley
mature miRNA sequences grouped on the basis of the miRNA family.
Families for which only one barley EST has been found to match are not
reported in this file.
Additional file 3: microRNA matching ESTs. List of ESTs matching the
mature miRNA sequences. ESTs that present more than 1 target site for
the same miRNA family or for different miRNA families have been
highlighted.
Additional file 4: Secondary structures of the putative miRNA
precursors. Predicted structures of the identified putative miRNA
precursors. The prediction was performed with mfold.
