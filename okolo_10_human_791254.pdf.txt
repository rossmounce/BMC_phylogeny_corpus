Abstract
Background: Concerns have been raised that the proportion of cervical cancer preventable by human
papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 vaccines might be lower in sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere.
Method: In order to study the relative carcinogenicity of HPV types in Nigeria, as well as to estimate the vaccinepreventable proportion of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in the country, we compared HPV type prevalence among
932 women from the general population of Ibadan, Nigeria, with that among a series of 75 ICC cases diagnosed in
the same city. For all samples, a GP5+/6+ PCR based assay was used for the detection of 44 genital HPV types.
Results: In the general population, 245 (26.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.5% - 29.2%) women were HPVpositive, among whom the prevalence of HPV35 and HPV16 were equally frequent (12.2%, 95% CI 8.4% - 17.0%). In
ICC, however, HPV16 predominated strongly (67.6% of 68 HPV-positive cases), with the next most common types
being 18 (10.3%, 95% CI 4.2% - 20.1%), 35, 45 and 56 (each 5.9%, 95% CI 1.6% - 14.4%). Comparing among HPVpositive women only, HPV16 and 18 were over-represented in ICC versus the general population (prevalence ratios
5.52, 95% CI 3.7 - 8.3 and 1.4, 95% CI 0.6 - 3.3, respectively). Other high-risk HPV types, as well as low-risk and
multiple HPV infections were less common in HPV-positive women with ICC than from the general population.
Conclusions: Our study confirms that in Nigeria, as elsewhere, women infected with HPV16 and 18 are at higher
risk of developing ICC than those infected with other high-risk types, and that current HPV16/18 vaccines have
enormous potential to reduce cervical cancer in the region.

Background
Cervical cancer incidence in sub-Saharan Africa is
among the highest in the world [1], as is the prevalence
of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [2]. In
a pooled analysis of the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) HPV Prevalence Surveys
including 13 populations worldwide, the highest HPV
prevalence was observed in Nigeria [2,3].
HPV16 prevalence was also the highest in Nigeria.
However, in relative terms, HPV-positive women in
Nigeria were less likely to be infected with HPV16 and
more likely to be infected with other high-risk HPV
types, in particular HPV35, but also HPV45, 52, 56 and
58 [2]. This, and similar findings from other subSaharan African populations [4], raised concerns that

the proportion of HPV disease preventable by HPV16/
18 vaccines might be lower in sub-Saharan Africa than
elsewhere. However, high-risk HPV types differ in their
risk for progression from infection to invasive cervical
cancer (ICC) [5,6]. Thus, HPV type distribution at the
population level is not representative of that in ICC, for
which no data from Nigeria exist to date.
In order to study the relative carcinogenicity of HPV
types in Nigeria, as well as to obtain a more robust measure of the vaccine-preventable proportion of ICC in the
country, we compared HPV type-specific prevalence in
the previously published IARC prevalence study with
that among a newly collected series of ICC cases diagnosed in the same city and tested for HPV using the
same protocol.

a representative sample of women living in Ibadan, the
third largest city in Nigeria, according to the standardized protocol of the IARC HPV Prevalence Surveys [3],
which was approved by both the IARC and local ethical
review committees. In summary, all women aged
15 years or older living in Idikan, a district of Ibadan,
were visited at their homes and invited to join the
study, with the aim to enroll approximately 100 women
in each 5-year age group. Of the invited women, 1,203
signed an informed consent form, underwent a pelvic
examination and cervical screening by two methods:
Papanicolau smear and visual inspection with acetic
acid. In addition, samples of cervical exfoliated cells in
phosphate buffer saline were collected for HPV testing.
Tumour biopsies, formalin fixed and embedded in
paraffin, were retrieved from the pathology archives for
all women diagnosed with histologically confirmed ICC
(n = 102) at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria, between 2004 and 2006.
HPV testing of cervical samples from both the general
population and ICC cases were performed at the VU
University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Tumour biopsies were sectioned using a ‘sandwich’ approach: inner
sections were destined for HPV testing and outer sections for histological confirmation. One or more five
μM sections representing approximately 1 cm2 of tissue
were predigested with Proteinase K after which DNA
was extracted using magnetic beads (Macherey-Nagel,
Germany). For all samples, a general primer GP5+/6
+-mediated PCR was used for the detection of 44 genital
HPV types, after screening for adequate DNA by PCR
with beta-globin gene-specific primers. Subsequent HPV
typing was performed by reverse-line blot hybridization
of PCR products.
Prevalence ratios and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were used to compare the relative frequency of HPV types in HPV-positive women with ICC
with that among HPV-positive women from the general
population.

Results
For the general population sample, type-specific HPV
prevalence was evaluated among 932 women with valid
HPV results, among whom 844 and 68 had normal and
abnormal (positive on PAP and/or VIA) cervical findings, respectively. Overall HPV prevalence was 26.3%
(95% CI 23.5 - 29.2) (n = 245). HPV16 and 35 were
equally common (n = 30), followed by HPV31 (n = 27),
56 (n = 22) and 58 (n = 21). Two women with abnormal
cervical findings were subsequently histologically confirmed with in situ (HPV18/42/52/81/83) or invasive
(HPV82) cervical carcinoma.
For ICC, after exclusion of biopsies without any histological evidence of tumour (n = 4) or inadequate DNA

for HPV testing (n = 23), type-specific HPV prevalence
was evaluated among 75 histologically confirmed ICC
cases. They included 62 squamous-cell, 11 adeno-, and
2 small cell carcinomas. The median age of women with
ICC was 55 years (range: 31-80 years). Overall HPV prevalence was 90.7% (95% CI 81.7 - 96.2). In seven ICC,
including 3 squamous-cell and four adenocarcinoma
(ADC), no HPV DNA could be detected. The five most
commonly detected types in ICC were HPV16 (n = 46),
18 (n = 7), 35, 45 and 56 (n = 4 each). The HPV types
among the 7 HPV-positive ADC were four HPV16 and
one each of HPV18, 35 and 56. One ICC was positive
for a low-risk type only (HPV30).
The comparison of type-specific HPV prevalence
among the 68 women with HPV-positive ICC and 245
HPV-positive women from the general population is
shown in Table 1. HPV16 was significantly over-represented in HPV-positive women with ICC (prevalence
ratio = 5.5, 95% CI 3.7 - 8.3). HPV18 was the only other
type to be over-represented in ICC, although not significantly so (1.4, 95% CI 0.6 - 3.3). Other individual highrisk HPV types were less common in HPV-positive
women with ICC than those from the general population. In particular, HPV31, 52 and 58 were common in
the general population, found in 11.0%, 5.3% and 8.6%
of HPV-positive women, respectively, but significantly
less prevalent in ICC. Low-risk and multiple HPV infections were also much less common in HPV-positive
women with ICC than those from the general population. HPV16 and/or 18 were detected in a total of 77.9%
of HPV-positive ICC, and HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33 and
45 in a total of 85.2% (Table 1).

Discussion
We previously reported that HPV-positive women from
the general population in Nigeria were less likely to be
infected with HPV16 and more likely to be infected
with other high-risk HPV types, in particular HPV35
[2]. Indeed, relatively high prevalence of HPV35 in comparison to HPV16 has also been observed from other
sub-Saharan African populations including Guinea [7],
Mozambique [4], Kenya [8] Gambia [9,10], and Zimbabwe [11], whereas HPV35 is four- to five-fold less
prevalent than HPV16 in population-based surveys from
Europe and the Americas [2,12,13]. These findings for
HPV35, but also other high-risk types, raised concerns
that the relevance of HPV16/18 vaccines to cervical cancer prevention might be lower in Nigeria or in subSaharan Africa in general.
Reassuringly, however, we confirmed that HPV16 and
18 are the two most frequently detected types among
ICC in Nigeria, and that they account for 78% of HPVpositive ICC, which is very similar to the proportion estimated in other world regions by recently published large

meta-analyses [14] and case series [15]. This finding adds
to the picture of a relatively homogeneous type-distribution in ICC around the world [14]. Our cross-sectional
findings of an enrichment of these two types in ICC are
also consistent with other cross-sectional data from SubSaharan Africa [7,16] as well as with evidence from prospective studies that show that women infected with
HPV16 and HPV18 are at significantly higher risk of
developing CIN3 and cancer in comparison to women
infected with other high-risk types [5,6,17].
Despite being as common as HPV16 in the general
population, HPV35 accounted for only 5.9% of ICC.
This figure is compatible with estimates of 5.0% (95%
CI: 3.3% - 7.1%) and 4.1% (95% CI: 2.3% - 7.4%) among
two recently published studies including 544 and 1,668
African ICC cases, respectively, assessed for this type
[14], but is higher than that in ICC from other world
regions (1% - 3%) [14,15]. Thus, although the relative
carcinogenicity of HPV35 is clearly less than HPV16, it
does still account for a substantial fraction of ICC in
sub-Saharan African populations and should be considered for new generation vaccines.

A relatively high importance of HPV45 (5.3%) and of
HPV51 (4.0%) in Nigerian ICC is also consistent with
that observed in other sub-Saharan Africa ICC in comparison to other world regions [14,15]. On the other
hand, HPV31 was considerably less common in ICC than
in the general population, as seen in previous studies
from Guinea [7] and Mozambique [16], suggesting that
in sub-Saharan African populations, it has only a relatively weak carcinogenic potential in comparison to other
types. Of note, one ICC case was positive for HPV30
only, and another for HPV82 only, both of which are
classified as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” by IARC
based upon their phylogenetic similarity to other highrisk types [18]. Interestingly, HPV30 was reported in only
one out of 2,851 worldwide ICC (0.04%) in a recent
meta-analysis [14], a HPV30 single infection from an ICC
case in Guinea, also in Western Africa [7].

Conclusions
In summary, our study confirms that current HPV vaccines have enormous potential to reduce cervical cancer
in Nigeria, where annual ICC incidence is estimated to

Okolo et al. Infectious Agents and Cancer 2010, 5:24

be 19.3 cases/100,000 women [1]. An efficacious vaccine
against HPV16/18 is likely to prevent more than 70% of
the 14,550 new ICC cases and 9,659 ICC deaths that are
estimated to occur in Nigeria every year [1]. If vaccines
also offer full cross-protection against HPV31, 33 and
45 [19,20], then the prevented proportion with existing
HPV16/18 vaccines could be as high as 85%.
