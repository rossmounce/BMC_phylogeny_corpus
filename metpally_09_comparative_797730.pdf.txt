Abstract
Background: Cold adapted or psychrophilic organisms grow at low temperatures, where most
of other organisms cannot grow. This adaptation requires a vast array of sequence, structural and
physiological adjustments. To understand the molecular basis of cold adaptation of proteins, we
analyzed proteomes of psychrophilic and mesophilic bacterial species and compared the differences
in amino acid composition and substitution patterns to investigate their likely association with
growth temperatures.
Results: In psychrophilic bacteria, serine, aspartic acid, threonine and alanine are overrepresented
in the coil regions of secondary structures, whilst glutamic acid and leucine are underrepresented
in the helical regions. Compared to mesophiles, psychrophiles comprise a significantly higher
proportion of amino acids that contribute to higher protein flexibility in the coil regions of proteins,
such as those with tiny/small or neutral side chains. Amino acids with aliphatic, basic, aromatic and
hydrophilic side chains are underrepresented in the helical regions of proteins of psychrophiles.
The patterns of amino acid substitutions between the orthologous proteins of psychrophiles versus
mesophiles are significantly different for several amino acids when compared to their substitutions
in orthologous proteins of within the mesophiles or psychrophiles.
Conclusion: Current results provide quantitative substitution preferences (or avoidance) of
amino acids that lead to the adaptation of proteins to cold temperatures. These finding would help
future efforts in selecting mutations for rational design of proteins with enhanced psychrophilic
properties.

Background
Microorganisms that live under forbidding conditions are
called extremophiles, whose discovery points out the
unique adaptability of primitive life-forms. These microorganisms are grouped according to their optimal growth
conditions in which they exist such as acidophiles (exhib-

iting optimum growth in acidic pH conditions), alkaliphiles (thriving in alkaline pH conditions), barophiles
(surviving under great pressures), endoliths (living in
deep inside rocks), halophiles (thriving in high salt concentrations), psychrophiles (optimal temperature below
20°C), and the thermophiles (optimal temperature

between 45–80°C), hyperthermophiles (optimal temperature above 80°C) [1]. The largest coverage of known
extremophile conditions of the earth's biosphere is below
10°C. For example, three fourths of earth is covered by
oceans, which maintain an average temperature of one to
three degrees centigrade. Furthermore, the vast land areas
of the Arctic and Antarctic are permanently frozen
throughout the year [1]. Other few examples of cryo habitats include cold deserts, high alpine soils, sea ice, cold
caves, marine sediments, permafrost soils, glacier, snow
etc.

Using homologous sequences, clustering along with various statistical methods; we conducted an extensive analysis of proteomes of psychrophilic, mesophilic,
thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms to
examine a possible correlation of amino acid substitution
patterns with adaptation to their respective optimal
growth conditions. In this manuscript we discuss the
results from comparative analysis of fully sequenced proteomes of six members from each of psychrophilic and
mesophilic organisms.

Results
The majority of known psychrophiles belong to varieties
of archaea and bacteria, and a few species of yeast, fungi
and algae [2]. The ability to thrive at life-endangering
effects of low temperatures, close to freezing point of
water, requires a vast array of adaptations from all their
cellular components, including their membranes, energygenerating systems, protein synthesis machinery, biodegradative enzymes and the components responsible for
nutrient uptake etc., to maintain metabolism, sustain
growth and reproduction compatible with life in these
low temperature conditions [3,4]. Having evolved with
special mechanisms, the psychrophiles successfully colonized these niches [2,5]. Psychrophilic proteins display
sequences and structures comparable with those of their
meso and (hyper) thermophilic homolog's, especially
enzymes with their ability to work efficiently as catalysts
at low temperatures [6]. The thermolability of these proteins at moderate temperatures warrant tremendous
industrial applications in biotechnology, bioremediation,
food, textiles, detergents bio-catalysis under low-water
conditions and detergents etc [5-9].
Due to above facts, historically starting from mid-1970's,
much attention was paid mainly to sequence and structural attributes contributing to adaptation of proteins
(mainly enzymes) to high temperature conditions. Many
investigators have compared sequence and structurebased parameters among thermophilic and mesophilic
proteins [10]. With the advent of pioneering efforts in late
1990's in solving three dimensional structures of cryophilic enzymes such as alpha-amylase [11]; alkaline protease [12]; triose phosphate isomerase [13]; malate
dehydrogenase [14] from Antarctic microorganisms, and
due to handful of available structures in the protein data
bank (PDB), groups have focused to address the structural
basis of proteins in cold adaptation [4,15-20].
The steady increase in sequencing of proteomes of extremophiles has opened many new avenues in understanding adaptations to extreme conditions [16,21-25]. A
comprehensive comparison of global amino acid preferences and substitution patterns as deduced from proteomes of different organisms is now possible [26-28].

On average we analyzed 2,816 proteins with 875,219
amino acids per proteome of mesophiles and 3665 proteins with 1,169,678 amino acids per proteome of psychrophiles. The amino acid (AA) frequencies given in
Table 1 show that some of the AA differed significantly in
psychrophile proteomes when compared to mesophile
proteomes. When compared to psychrophiles, the mesophile proteomes show larger standard deviation for residues indicating that the six proteomes of mesophiles we
used are considerably more divergent than the proteomes
of psychrophiles. The frequencies of individual amino
acids as well as property groups were further analyzed
with student t-test.
Amino acid composition preferences
The t-test results demonstrate significant preferences in
frequencies of amino acid occurrences and property
groups in psychrophilic proteomes as compared to mesophilic proteomes or vice versa (Table 1). The compositional trend of AA is somewhat similar in both types of
genomes. However, as indicated by t-values from Table 1,
there are a few AA residues such as A, D, S and T, significantly preferred in psychrophiles as compared to mesophiles. On the other hand, AA residues E and L are
significantly less favored in psychrophile proteomes.
When comparing frequencies of occurrences of property
groups of AAs, we observe that tiny/small and neutral
amino acid groups are significantly preferred in psychrophiles where as charged, basic, aromatic and
hydrophilic groups are significantly less favored as shown
by their corresponding t-values in Table 1. When we compared the AA compositions of the sequences in alignments of respective orthologous proteins alone (the data
not given), we observed similar trends.
Secondary Structural Elements
The composition of AA of psychrophilic and mesophilic
proteomes in three major secondary structural elements,
α-helices, β-sheets and coils, is given in Table 2. Collectively taken, the psychrophilic proteomes contain significantly less number of residues (~2%) in the α-helices and
significantly more number of residues (~2%) in the coil
regions. The majority of amino acids exhibit similar com-

positions in either of the two genome sequences. However, amino acids E, F L, N and Y show significantly low
frequencies in α-helices of psychrophilic proteomes and
amino acids A, D, G, S, T, and V are significantly high in
the coil region of psychrophilic proteomes. The amino
acid, E is significantly low in the coil region of psychrophilic proteomes. Except in an increase in Alanine
residues, β-sheets of psychrophile proteomes did not
show any significant changes as compared to mesophiles.
When evaluated for the frequencies of occurrence of property groups of amino acids, the majority of them show significantly low frequencies in helices of psychrophilic
proteomes. Except in tiny group of AAs, the β-sheet

regions of psychrophile proteomes did not show any significant changes (Table 2). The tiny, small, hydrophobic,
neutral, acidic, aliphatic, and non-polar amino acid
groups showed significantly high frequencies in the coil/
loop regions of psychrophilic proteomes.
Comparative Proteome Analysis
Towards identification of residue substitutions, likely to
have undergone in psychrophilic proteins as the species
adapted to cold temperatures, a comparative proteome
analysis was performed on the basis of amino acid substitutions occurred between the orthologous protein
sequences of psychrophile and mesophile proteomes. The
orthologous sequence pairs for a protein sequence with

Significant compositional differences as indicated by t-test parameter are shown in bold.

significant length coverage only were considered for the
analysis. Coverage of hits with respect to each proteome is
shown in Table 3. On average 16.3% psychrophile proteins have orthologous proteins in mesophiles we used.
This was cross-checked using mesophile proteomes as
query sequences and the psychrophile proteomes as subject sequences, where we found 13.9% orthologs (Table
3). We used sequence alignments of these sequence pairs
to compute substitutions of amino acids between mesophilic and psychrophilic proteomes and vice versa and
the obtained values were averaged. On average, ten to
twenty five percent of sequences from individual proteomes exhibited best hit homologues from members of
other thermal groups (Table 3). This percent depended on
the size of the proteome under consideration. The higher
the number of proteins in a query proteome the higher
percentage of hits from the subject proteomes searched.

This may be because some of the paralogous sequences
selecting the same protein as its ortholog (this redundancy was removed in our final data). We also considered
homologous proteins among the psychrophiles and mesophiles, and calculated the substitutions within them to
use as background substitution frequencies [see Eqn. (ii)
and (iii)]. We observed, on average 16.7% and 17.1%
orthologous proteins within the psychrophilic and mesophilic proteomes, respectively (Table 3).
Amino Acid Substitution Patterns
Log odd scores (LOS) of AA substitutions were calculated
using the frequency of occurrence of substitutions among
orthologous proteins of psychrophiles and mesophiles by
normalizing with frequency of occurrence of substitutions
within the proteomes of the same temperature sensitive
group. In LOS calculation the substitutions influenced by

factors other than temperature are nullified and values
represent true substitution due to cold adaptation of species. In Table 4 we show LOSMeso values computed using
equation (ii) as described in methods. These values clearly
show that psychrophilic proteins avoid containing the
amino acids E, F, K, N and Y. On the other hand they prefer containing the residues A, D, G, S, and T as compared
to mesophile proteins. The individual values in Table 4
show that to what extant certain substitutions are favored
or avoided depending on corresponding LOSMeso score
+ve or -ve, respectively. For example the W in mesophiles
mutating to S in the psychrophiles is highly favored with
LOS scores of 10.9. On the other hand G in mesophiles
mutating to K in psychrophiles is avoided with LOS score
of -12.4. The LOSPsychro [Eqn. (iii)] scores calculated using
substitution frequencies among psychrophiles as normalizing factor have shown similar results (data not shown).
Student t-test was further applied to evaluate level of significance of LOS substitution scores and these data were
shown in Additional files (Additional file 1 &2). Table
Additional file 1(a) shows t-values for the LOSMeso scores
and Additional file 1(b) shows t-values for the LOSPsychro
scores. The LOSMeso scores (Table 4) with their corresponding t-values (Additional file 1) greater than 1.37 or
less than -1.37 could be considered as significantly preferred or avoided, respectively, at 90% confidence level
(shaded in color, Table 4). It can be seen from the table
that there are about 45% substitutions that are shown to
be significant. Further, the LOSMeso for AA property group
substitutions are given in Table 5 and their corresponding
t-values are given in Additional file 2. It is clearly seen
from Table 5 that there is high preference for tiny, small
and neutral AAs whereas charged (including both basic
and acidic) aromatic and hydrophilic AAs are avoided significantly in the psychrophiles as compared to mesophiles.

Discussion
Our objective in this study was to analyze systematically
the compositional variation and substitution preferences
of amino acids in proteomes of psychrophiles compared
to the proteomes of mesophiles to investigate general proteome wide characteristics for cold adaptation. We considered total compositional differences in proteomes as well
as compositional differences in their orthologous proteins
alone. We performed analysis at different levels, through
simple amino acid compositions, student t-test and
finally by substitution patterns in their orthologous proteins. Some of the methods we used were previously
applied [26,29-31] but not to the complete proteome
analysis.
In psychrophiles individual residue compositions show
that there is a significant preference for A, D, S and T content and significant avoidance of E and L content and
moderate preference for G and avoidance for F and K content (Table 1). All these residue preferences and avoidance
directly show a strong correlation with respect to avoidance for helical content in psychrophiles, as S, D and G are
helix breakers [32] and T is a helix indifferent. Likewise,
the presence of E tends to favor formation of helical structures and L tends to stabilize helical structures [32] that
are highly avoided in psychrophiles. Amino acid D is
observed to be unstable at high temperatures and therefore its frequency observed to decrease as optimal growth
temperature of organisms increase [33]. Reverse trends are
observed for E to counter the trend in favor of making ion
pair interactions to form salt-bridges at higher temperatures [34,35]. Helix destabilizing beta-branched residues
(I, T and V) are preferred in beta sheets and loop regions
of psychrophilic proteins [36,37]. The substitution pattern in the orthologous proteins of two temperature
groups show several interesting features that are not readily seen in the simple AA compositions. On other hand,

they strongly support observed differences in compositions apart from giving additional insights, such as what
specific substitutions were more favored or avoided as
shown by LOS values.
Nonpolar Amino Acids
Our results in this study confirm that overall composition
of nonpolar AA group did not show much difference in
proteins belonging to psychrophiles and mesophiles, but
there is a decrease in nonpolar AA group frequency in helices and a significant increase in loop regions among proteins of psychrophiles. This is in accordance with earlier
findings that there are more nonpolar amino acids on the
exposed surface area of the majority of psychrophilic proteins [35,38] as more loops are observed on surface
regions. Among nonpolar residues, I, L and V belong to
aliphatic group of residues, which are significantly
reduced to favor protein flexibility. It has been widely
accepted that the aliphatic amino acids would contribute
to the hydrophobic interaction for maintaining conformational stability and rigidity in core region of the proteins [36,39,40]. Observed low average hydropathy and
low aliphatic residues in psychrophiles are mainly contributed by significantly low in L composition [35].
Tiny and Small Amino acids
Tiny and small amino acids are those with short side
chains and are unable to participate in long range interactions among secondary structural elements and are usually confined to form local interactions. Overall their

compositions are significantly increased in beta sheets
and loops of psychrophilic proteins over mesophilic
counter parts. This is also clear from substitutions
observed in orthologous proteins. The amino acid G is
devoid of side chain, is more flexible with greater rotational freedom, is capable of making cavities in the core
parts of the proteins structures [39] and was shown to be
in less frequency in thermophiles [41]. Whereas P with
pyrolidine ring structure has restricted conformations and
was shown to occur in higher frequency in thermophiles
[40]. Our LOS values confirm that the amino acid G is preferred and the P is avoided in psychrophiles as compared
to mesophiles.
Charged amino acids
Charged residues are polar and hydrophilic. They contribute to ion pair electrostatic interactions that are important
binding force for maintaining conformational stability in
surface of the proteins [37,39,42]. The more charged residues were found in thermophilic proteins than in mesophilic proteins [36,40]. The charged AA (especially basic
and hydrophilic) residues are significantly avoided in psychrophiles (Table 5). Present analysis also supports the
notion that these residues are significantly avoided in psychrophiles as observed from compositions as well as LOS
scores. The most striking feature of psychrophilic proteins
is an increase in amino acid D and decrease in amino acid
E over mesophiles. The charged residues in mesophiles are
mainly replaced with small and tiny residues in psychrophiles.

The +ve values indicates that the corresponding substitution of mesophilic amino acid property groups to the respective psychrophilic groups is
higher than such substitutions within the mesophilic homologous proteins. The values shown to be significant at 90% confidence level by student ttest are shown in bold.

Aromatic Amino acids
Psychrophilic proteins and their secondary structural elements show significant decrease in aromatic amino acids.
Especially F and Y that are capable of binding to cationic
amino acid side chains of K and R in forming cation-π
interactions and play important role in stabilizing three
dimensional structure of proteins [43-45]. Our studies
show that, a significant decrease in aromatic residues
occurs by substitution with tiny/small and neutral amino
acids in psychrophiles (Table 5). Finally, our LOS values,
combining with PAM or BLOSUM mutual substitution
scores, assist in selecting suitable mutations in designing
mesophilic proteins to optimally function in cold temperatures or vice versa. For example substitution of E in mesophilic proteins with D may not change chemical
characteristics significantly but may result in optimizing
protein function in cold temperatures. In similar lines we
observe that amino acid K is highly avoided and R is preferred in psychrophiles although both being basic amino
acids.

Conclusion
We analyzed compositions of individual amino acid residues, amino acid groups and their distribution pattern in
secondary structures and then computed and quantified
their substitution patterns and directional preferences
between mesophiles and psychrophiles. Significant differences in composition of amino acid residues were
observed between the mesophilic and psychrophilic proteins as summarized below: (i) we observed an increase in
frequency of individual amino acids like A, D, S and T that
avoid helices and a decrease in E and L amino acids; (ii)
There is an increase in small/tiny and neutral group residues which contribute to protein flexibility and a decrease
in charged amino acids, particularly basic as well as

hydrophilic residues that contribute to ionic interactions;
(iii) there is a decrease in aromatic amino acids residues
that contribute to the cation-π interactions; (iv) there is a
decrease in aliphatic residues which provide good covering and masking to produce hydrophobic pockets that are
involved in stabilizing protein structure; (v) there is a
reduction in amino acid preferences for helices and an
increase of coil forming residues; (vi) we also observed a
significant level of substitutions of aliphatic and charged
amino acids by tiny/small or neutral amino acids; (vii) the
results from this analysis, especially significant t-values of
LOS substitution pairs, can be used as a knowledge base
in rational design of mutations for engineering of mesophilic proteins to function optimally in cold temperatures or vice versa.

Methods
Proteome sequences from six members each of available
completely sequenced species of psychrophiles and mesophiles (listed in the foot note of Table 1) are collected.
They were selected randomly from independent genuses
of mesophiles and 6 of 9 available completely sequenced
genomes of psychrophiles to control plausible variations
from phylogenetic non-independence (PNI) as related
species may share the similar traits due to shared ancestry.
These proteome sequences were downloaded from the
NCBI proteome project server in the fasta format. The
growth temperatures of these species were obtained from
NCBI [46] and/or PGTdb (Prokaryotic Growth Temperature database) [47]. We computed the frequencies of
amino acid residues in the protein sequences of psychrophilic and mesophilic proteomes. We also grouped
the amino acids into 12 property groups [48] as follows:
Acidic amino acids group include D and E; aliphatic: I, L
and V; aromatic: H, F, W and Y; basic: R, H, and K;

charged: R, D, E, H and K; hydrophilic: D, E, K, N, Q and
R; hydrophobic: A, C, F, I, L, M, V, W and Y neutral: G, Q,
H, S and T; non-polar: A, C, G, I, L, M, F, P, V, W and Y;
polar: R, N, D, E, Q, H, K, S and T; small: A, C, D, G, N, P,
S, T, V and tiny: A, C, G, S and T. The sum of frequencies
of amino acids that fall in each property group are calculated for psychrophiles and mesophiles and are also compared (Table 1). Some of the amino acids are included in
more than one property group.
Student t-test
To compare the means of two groups of data, t-test is
essentially a good tool for the signal-to-noise metaphor
used in research analysis. IIn present analysis, we compared the mean frequencies of single amino acids, 12 different property groups of amino acids and three secondary
structural elements from all protein sequences of psychrophilic and mesophilic proteomes considered in this
analysis. The t-values are calculated as follows:

t=

FPsychro − FMeso
(VarPsychro n Psychro )+(Var Meso n Meso )

(i)
Where VarPsychro and VarMeso are the variance of residues or
property groups; (FPsychro) and (FMeso) are mean frequencies
of psychrophilic and mesophilic proteomes respectively.
The nPsychro and nMeso are the total number of psychrophilic
and mesophilic proteomes investigated in this study,
respectively. Based on student's t-distribution table of significance, critical values for such t-test at various probabilities are as follows (see Table 6):
If t-value is positive and greater than critical value at 10%
probability (1.372) then the mean frequency (FPsychro) of
psychrophilic proteomes is significantly greater than that
of the mesophilic proteomes (FMeso) at 90% or higher confidence level. If the frequency of residue or property group
t-value is negative and less than -1.372 then the mean frequency of psychrophilic proteomes (FPsychro) is significantly less than that of mesophilic proteomes (FMeso) at
90% or higher confidence level [18,40,49].
Secondary Structure Prediction
We predicted secondary structural elements in protein
sequences using GTOP [50] and/or PSIPRED [51]. We
used these predictions to compute frequencies of different
amino acids and property groups of residues in three

major secondary structural regions, helix (H), strand (E)
and coil (C). PSIPRED is a highly reliable secondary structure prediction method with ~83% reported prediction
accuracy. We have also tested its prediction accuracy on
some of the known psychrophilic and mesophilic proteins to see if there is any significant difference in its prediction for psychrophilic proteins. A total of about 25
proteins, approximately 5000 residues, from each we
observed that PSIPRED prediction accuracy was 78.42%
and 80.89% for psychrophilic and mesophilic proteins,
respectively.
Comparative Analysis of Amino Acid Substitutions
All protein sequences from each mesophilic species in
dataset were searched against each proteome of psychrophylic species and vice versa, using BLASTP [52] with 10-3
expectation value cutoff and considerable length coverage. We picked up pair-wise alignments obtained from
BLAST results of each protein sequence in a query proteome that showed best hit homolog (ortholog) in the
subject proteome. The pair-wise alignments (exclusion of
gapped regions) were parsed to calculate amino acid substitution counts between the two proteins from respective
proteomes. The substitution counts were normalized to
total amino acids present in their respective proteomes
pairs individually and finally to all the pairs. The resultant
frequency of substitutions was further used to calculate
two types of likelihood log odd scores (LOS):

LOS Meso = Log

LOS Psychro = Log

F( X Meso →Y Psychro )
F(Y Meso → X Meso )
F( X Psychro →Y Meso )
F( X Psychro →Y Psychro )

(ii)

(iii)

Where F(XMeso → YPsychro) represent normalized frequency
of amino acid X in mesophile substituted by an amino
acid Y in psychrophile. The LOS values are calculated by
using background substitution frequencies among the
mesophilic and/or psychrophilic proteomes in the
denominator. The LOS scores, therefore, indicated the
pattern of substitutions that are predominantly due to
their thermal adaptation and therefore minimize the
effect of substitutions due to any speciation events in the
evolution process.
