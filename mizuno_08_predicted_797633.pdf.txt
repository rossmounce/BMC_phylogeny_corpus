Abstract
Background: The import of most intraperoxisomal proteins is mediated by peroxisome targeting
signals at their C-termini (PTS1) or N-terminal regions (PTS2). Both signals have been integrated
in subcellular location prediction programs. However their present performance, particularly of
PTS2-targeting did not seem fitting for large-scale screening of sequences.
Results: We modified an earlier reported PTS1 screening method to identify PTS2-containing
mouse candidates using a combination of computational and manual annotation. For rapid
confirmation of five new PTS2- and two previously identified PTS1-containing candidates we
developed the new cell line CHO-perRed which stably expresses the peroxisomal marker dsRedPTS1. Using CHO-perRed we confirmed the peroxisomal localization of PTS1-targeted candidate
Zadh2. Preliminary characterization of Zadh2 expression suggested non-PPARα mediated
activation. Notably, none of the PTS2 candidates located to peroxisomes.
Conclusion: In a few cases the PTS may oscillate from "silent" to "functional" depending on its
surface accessibility indicating the potential for context-dependent conditional subcellular sorting.
Overall, PTS2-targeting predictions are unlikely to improve without generation and integration of
new experimental data from location proteomics, protein structures and quantitative Pex7 PTS2
peptide binding assays.

Background
Peroxisomes are ubiquitous intracellular organelles that
originate from the endoplasmatic reticulum [1]. Various
biosynthesis and metabolic pathways including β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, α-oxidation of
branched and straight chain fatty acids [2], plasmalogen
synthesis [3], and hydrogen peroxide detoxification [4]
are located in peroxisomes. Unlike mitochondria, peroxisomes lack the ability to synthesize DNA and proteins.
Therefore, all peroxisomal proteins must be imported.
More than 60 proteins, predominantly enzymes and peroxisomal membrane proteins are known to be sorted
from the cytoplasm or endoplasmatic reticulum to peroxisomes. Apart from a peroxisomal membrane protein specific targeting signal (mPTS) [5] two types of peroxisome
targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, mediate the peroxisomal import of proteins by peroxisome biogenesis factors
5 (Pex5) and 7 (Pex7) [6]. The majority of peroxisome-targeted proteins contain PTS1, a C-terminally located trimer
[SAGCN]-[RKH]-[LIVMAF] signal that has been refined
and extended to a dodecamer motif [7,8]. Less than ten
peroxisomal proteins are targeted via the N-terminally
located PTS2 signal [RK]-[LVQI]-X-X-[LVIHQ]-[LSGAK]X-[HQ]-[LAF] [9]. One of the PTS2-targeted proteins
phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is deficient in Refsum disease
and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1. These
and other inherited peroxisomal disorders caused by deficiencies in PEX proteins and ten other peroxisomal
enzymes [10] have significantly contributed to the understanding of metabolic pathways in peroxisomes. However, several regulatory mechanisms including intraperoxisomal processing of imported enzymes and their
degradation, glycophospholipid metabolism, or oxidative
stress defense in mammalian peroxisomes cannot be fully
explained with the known set of peroxisomal proteins. In
addition, the peroxisomal localization of PTS1-containing viral proteins [11] and piggy-back type targeting [12]
imply that cellular proteins with and without PTS and
hitherto unknown peroxisomal location maybe sorted to
peroxisomes under certain conditions [13].
Attempts to identify the peroxisomal proteome from subcellular fractions of rat livers using mass spectrometry [14]
led to the discovery of new peroxisomal proteins but also
missed a number of known peroxisomal proteins [15].
Alternatively, new peroxisome-targeted proteins can be
predicted computationally. For example PTS1Prowler is
predicting whether a protein with C-terminal PTS1
sequence is targeted to peroxisome [16]. Yet, the performance of subcellular location predictions, for example
PSORT II [17], pTARGET [18] or PTS1 predictor [19] is
limited by the small number of peroxisomal training data
compared to the data on nuclear, mitochondrial and cytoplasm-located proteins. Even the predictions for known

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S12/S16

peroxisomal proteins by different programs may not show
agreement in terms of subcellular location.
We therefore developed a computational PTS1 screening
method combined with manual annotation steps to identify new peroxisome candidates from protein coding
sequences of GenBank® [15]. The effort led to the identification of Tysnd1, a peroxisomal protease that processes
PTS1 and PTS2-targeted enzymes involved in β-oxidation
[20]. Encouraged by this finding we decided to apply a
similar approach for identifying new PTS2-targeted proteins, while improving the first-pass experimental confirmation of remaining PTS1 and new PTS2 candidates.
Unlike the PTS1 screening, regular expression and Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) profile searches were used to
extract PTS2-containing candidates from GenBank®. For
rapid confirmation of peroxisomal protein candidates by
confocal laser scanning microscopy we established the cell
line CHO-perRed that stably expresses a peroxisome-targeted red fluorescence reporter.
Preempting the results, none of the experimentally tested
PTS2 candidates localized to peroxisomes. Zinc binding
alcohol dehydrogenase Zadh2, one of two tested PTS1
candidates, was confirmed and preliminary characterized.
Yet, the non-peroxisomal location of PTS2 candidates
raised interesting questions about differential targeting
and the future of subcellular targeting predictions, including their validation.

Methods
Regular expression search
Putative translation of non-truncated coding sequences
(CDS) of more than 99 amino acids length were retrieved
from mRNA entries of GenBank® (Release 146.0) primate
(PRI), rodent (ROD) and high-throughput cDNA (HTC)
divisions. The extracted 117,354 CDS were screened with
the EMBOSS suite program [21] fuzzpro for the presence
of the modified PTS2 signal [RK]-[LVQI]-{P}-x-x[LVIHQ]-[LSGAK]-x-[HQ]-[LAF]. Proline was excluded at
position three of the original PTS2 regular expression [9]
because it can prevent targeting. Mismatches were not
allowed and the search space was limited to the first 100
amino acids.
HMM profile search
A HMM profile is a position-specific scoring model
derived from a multiple sequence alignment. The PTS2
HMM profile was created from known functional PTS2
signals of peroxisome-targeted proteins (Additional File
1) using HMMbuild [22]. The calibrated HMM profile was
used to search the CDS set sequences, containing the first
100 amino acids, with HMMER.

Filtering and annotation of candidates
Both regular expression and HMM profile searches will
yield sequences matches that are redundant, associated
with known PTS2-targeted proteins, or with candidates
that are unlikely to be localized to peroxisomes. To eliminate these sequences we applied a triage supported by
manual curation, similar to the filtering procedure
described by Kurochkin et al. [15]. Briefly, 36 known PTS2
containing sequences (Additional File 2) were eliminated
from both regular expression (447) and HMMER search
(151) results. Information on protein family classification
and functional domains of the protein candidates were
extracted from InterPro (release 9.0) by using InterProScan (version 8.0). BLASTP (E-value less than e-20)
searches against non-redundant GenBank® CDS translations were used to establish biological informative names
for sequences without descriptions. Sequences that contained only motifs incompatible with peroxisomal localization (e.g., RNA-helicase (IPR0006050)), or that were
supported by an unequivocal PSORT II [17] nuclear localization were eliminated. In addition, we predicted protein
solubility and the numbers of trans-membrane spanning
regions using the programs SOSUI [23] and TMAP [24].
Only sequences that resulted in "soluble" predictions and
no more than one trans-membrane spanning region were
considered.
Cell culture and transfection
CHO-K1 Chinese hamster ovary cells (Cell Bank, RIKEN
BioResource Center) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GIBCO) containing 0.1 mM nonessential amino acid (GIBCO) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum (Bio West) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2. One day before transfection, cells were seeded in
6-well plates and grown for one day in 2 ml medium without antibiotics. At 90–95% confluence the cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid
DNA was diluted in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium
(GIBCO). Four to six hours after transfection the medium
was replaced with fresh antibiotic-free growth medium.
Selection of stable cell line
CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pDsRed2-Peroxi (variant 2 of red fluorescent protein derived from Discosoma
sp.), encoding the peroxisome-targeted DsRed2 reporter
protein (BD Biosciences Clontech). Stably transfected
CHO-K1 cells were selected with G418-supplemented
medium (Nacalai Tesque) at a final concentration of 1
mg/ml. After two weeks of G418 selection, the cells were
seeded in 96-well plates and monitored by fluorescence
microscopy. Wells containing only red fluorescent cells
were chosen for subculturing (CHO-perRed). The stable
cell line CHO-perRed was maintained in the 1 mg/ml
G418-containing medium to avoid the loss of the trans-

fected DNA. After a maximum of five passages cells were
frozen.
Localization of novel peroxisomal candidates using
confocal microscopy
CHO-K1 or CHO-perRed cells were plated onto glass
cover slips. CHO-perRed cells were transfected with
expression vectors pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-Zadh2-TOPO,
pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-KBTBD10-TOPO,
pcDNA3.1/CTGalk2-GFP-TOPO,
pcDNA3.1/CT-Qpctl-GFP-TOPO,
pcDNA3.1/CT-Fut8-GFP-TOPO,
pcDNA3.1/CT-Sytl3GFP-TOPO,
pcDNA3.1/CT-Ppp3ca-GFP-TOPO
and
pcDNA3.1/CT-Acaa1-GFP-TOPO (for construct details see
Additional File 3). The PTS2 candidates (Galk2, Qpctl,
Sytl3, Fut8, and Ppp3ca) and known PTS2-located thiolase (Acaa1) were expressed as fusion proteins with GFP at
the C-terminus. The PTS1 candidates KBTBD10 and
Zadh2 was expressed as N-terminal GFP fusion proteins.
Live-cell microscopy using the 63× objective of the laser
scanning confocal microscope TCS SP2 (Leica) was performed 24 h after transfection of the GFP fusion protein
constructs. The laser spectra 488 nm and 543 nm were
used for observation of GFP and DsRed2, respectively.
Bezafibrate treatment, high fat diet and quantitative realtime PCR
These experiments were performed as previously
described by Kurochkin et al. [20]. Details are given in
Additional File 3.

Results and discussion
Peroxisomal protein candidates
The prediction of PTS2-targeted proteins from translated
CDS of GenBank® rodent and primate mRNA sequences
using regular expression yielded 447 matches whereas the
HMM profile search [21] produced 151 hits (E-value <
0.01). Of 519 total matches 79 (13.2%) were detected by
both methods. Seventy-two (13.9%) matches were
unique to HMMER and 368 (70.9%) matches to the regular expression searches. The results reflect the difference of
PROSITE-type matching of all possible PTS2 variants, and
PFAM-style position-specific scoring that corrects for unequal representation of PTS2 residues. Thirty-six sequences
that were identified by both methods corresponded to
known PTS2-targeted proteins encoded by six mouse
genes and their eleven orthologs in human, rat, and/or
guinea pig (Additional File 2).

After visual inspection of 462 new candidates, supported
by results of BLASTP and InterPro motif searches as well
as predictions of transmembrane-spanning regions and
PSORT II subcellular localization, we excluded 435
sequences that were either redundant or contained unambiguous features, deemed incompatible with peroxisomal
functions (e.g., transcription factor, histone, RNA-bind-

ing). Of the remaining 27 candidates, representing 14
mouse genes, eight human and five rat orthologs, twelve
sequences showed a conserved PTS2 signal in all three
species (Fut8, Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb, and 2410005O16Rik).
Eight candidates carried a conserved PTS2 signal in mouse
and human (Galk2, Qpctl, Sytl3, and Zmiz1). Two mouse
PTS2 candidates, E330021D16Rik and 6030452D12Rik,
lacked mammalian orthologs. Four candidates (Armc6,
Wdr6, Adhfe1, and Pgm2) had human orthologs, but

without PTS2. Details of the detection method, PTS2 signal and selection criteria for experimental testing of the 14
mouse candidates are shown in Table 1A and Additional
File 4. Five candidates (Galk2, Qpctl, Sytl3, Fut8, and
Ppp3ca) containing conserved PTS2 were chosen for colocalization studies. In addition, we included the PTS1
candidates (Table 1B) sarcosin (KBTBD10) and Zadh2 in
the experimental evaluation. Both candidates were pre-

Establishment of stably transfected cell line for
peroxisomal co-localization studies
A commonly used method to support computationally
predicted subcellular localizations is testing cells for colocalization of the transiently transfected GFP-tagged candidate and a fluorescent marker. Variation in the copy
number of integrated plasmids expressing the marker protein in transiently transfected cells, and time-consuming
optimization of the ratio between GFP-fused candidate
and the marker DNA for each experiment render this
method unsuitable for systematic testing of larger number
of candidates with minimum variation in experimental

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S12/S16

conditions. Since CHO-K1 cells are widely used in colocalization experiments of peroxisomal proteins, we stably transfected the peroxisomal marker dsRed2-PTS1 into
CHO-K1 cells to establish the cell line CHO-perRed (Figure 1).
The morphology of CHO-perRed cells was comparable
that of CHO-K1. DsRed2 was uniformly expressed in
almost all cells (Figure 1A). After five passages the expression of DsRed2 has not changed (Additional File 5). Colocalization of known peroxisomal proteins with DsRed2
was tested by transfecting CHO-perRed cells with GFPfused Acca1 (thiolase), which is targeted by PTS2. Confocal microscopy confirmed the overlapping punctuate dis-

tribution of Acaa1 and DsRed2 (Figure 1B, merged) that is
characteristic for peroxisomal localization.
Peroxisomal localization of PTS1-containing candidate
Zadh2 in CHO-perRed cells
Mouse Zadh2 co-localized with DsRed in CHO-perRed
cells (Figure 2 and Table 1). The peroxisomal localization
of Zadh2 was corroborated by the findings of Islinger et al.
[25]. The authors identified Zadh2 in liver peroxisome
subfractions of bezafibrate-treated rats using mass spectrometry. The peroxisomal localization of Zadh2 was
demonstrated in a stably GFP-PTS1 transfected CHO cell
clone. However, the function of this new peroxisomal
enzyme was not further characterized.

Since computational inferred evidence from sequence
analysis suggested alcoholdeydrogenase and antioxidant
functions, rather than direct involvement in β-oxidation
we tested whether Zadh2 is inducible by bezafibrate or
high fat diet. Bezafibrate is a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist that increases liver
β-oxidation of fatty acids. Zadh2 expression upon bezafibrate treatment was slightly reduced (0.74 ± 0.06, p =
0.04407) compared to normal-diet controls (Additional
File 6), indicating a non-PPARα related activation mechanism. In accordance with previously published data [20],
bezafibrate significantly induced thiolase expression
(6.28 ± 0.93, p = 0.00087) whereas Scp2 expression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S12/S16

remained unchanged. On the other hand, high fat diet
induced Zadh2 expression (1.84 ± 0.24, p = 0.00697)
while the expression β-oxidation enzyme thiolase
remained more or less at control levels. Considering that
the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase is not affected by
bezafibrate [26], Zadh2 may indeed assume protective
functions against peroxisomal peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Whether Zadh2 is a functional
homolog of the cytosolic NADP-dependent quinone oxidoreductase [15], which also belongs to the superfamily
of Zn-containing alcohol dehydrogenase remains to be
established in future studies.
Non-peroxisomal localization of PTS2- and PTS1containing candidates in CHO-perRed cells
The predicted subcellular locations of one PTS1 and five
PTS2 candidates did not conform to the observed localization in CHO-perRed cells (Table 1 and Additional File
7). KBTBD10, Galk2, Sytl3 and Qcptl were detected in the
cytoplasm. Fut8 localized to spotted structures in the cytoplasm within proximity of the nucleus. Considering that
Fut8 was initially isolated from Golgi-rich fractions of rat
liver [27] the observed localization is believed to be the
Golgi apparatus. PPP3ca was detected in aggregated structures in the cytoplasm with negligible punctuate localization to peroxisomes. The aggregates were reminiscent of
the calcineurin clusters in COS7 cells [28].

From a computational point of view the five PTS2 candidates were false positives. Typically, the result would be
indicative of poor accuracy of the initial PTS searches and/
or problems in the candidate selection strategy. The initial
PTS2 regular expression search used an improved motif
[RK]-[LVQI]-{P}-x-[LVIHQ]-[LSGAK]-x-[HQ]-[LAF] that
is much more restrictive than the original PTS2 motif
[RK]-[LVIQ]-x-x-x-x-x-[HQ]-[LAF] [29]. Similarly, when
building the HMM model we excluded A. thaliana
AT1G04710 (acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase), to obtain a
tighter model. Consequently, the number of hits for both
regular expression (447) and HMMER (151) without
redundancy reduction was relative low and included 36
known PTS2 sequences.
The selection strategy was based on the knowledge of peroxisome biology at the time the study was planned. Since
the intermingling of computational search with semimanual candidate filtering and manual prioritization (see
also Additional File 4) for experimental validation does
not allow standard performance comparisons with other
methods, we only used the sequences of the selected candidates, known PTS sequences and actual subcellular locations for comparisons. A complete assessment of the
selection strategy would require not only the replication
of all steps for the initial prediction results of other methods, but also the comparison of different semi-manual filtering steps, and the prioritization step by independent
biologists. Despite the partial nature of comparisons with
other methods, the emerging discrepancies and limitations of peroxisome targeting prediction approaches,
including ours, may be used to re-evaluate and improve
peroxisome targeting prediction strategies, particularly for
PTS2.
Comparison of subcellular locations with predictions by
PTS2 Predictor
PTS2 Target Signal Predictor of PeroxisomeDB [30], which
uses Blimps position-specific scoring matrix search [31],
detected putative PTS2 in all candidates at the same positions as HMMER, albeit different E-values (Additional File
4). The E-values (e1-04 to e1-05) of potential PTS2 in
Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb, Zmiz1, Armc6, and Wdr6 sequences
were one to two magnitudes lower than HMMER E-values
(~e1-03). Assessment of the predictions with published,
experimentally determined subcellular locations showed
that none of the proteins were reported to locate to peroxisomes (see last column of Additional Table 8A). On the
other hand, the PTS2 Target Signal Predictor E-values of
Galk (0.029) and Qpctl (0.013) and Fut8 (0.0055) were
above the cut-off threshold of 0.005. Although the comparison with PTS2 Targeting Predictor was restricted to
our candidate set, both prediction methods do not appear
to be very effective.

Comparison of PTS2 predictions with LOCATE subcellular
location summaries
Comparison of the predicted peroxisomal location with
available subcellular location summaries of LOCATE
database [32] showed no concordance (Additional File
8A). The LOCATE subcellular location summary is based
on evidence from primary literature, original experiments,
and annotations derived from various databases (e.g.,
UniProt, SwissProt, HPRD, etc.), if available. All known
PTS2-targeted mouse proteins, except Acaa1b, and four
out of ten PTS2 candidates had a LOCATE summary. The
summaries of Fut8, Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb and Zmiz1 displayed
non-peroxisomal locations, which are in line with our
experimental results (Fut8 and Ppp3ca) or literature evidence (Ppp3cb and Zmiz1).
Variation of predicted subcellular locations across
different prediction tools
LOCATE entries are also linked to integrated results of
computationally more sophisticated subcellular location
prediction methods CELLO, pTarget, Proteome Analyst,
WoLFPSORT, and MultiLoc. When comparing the predicted subcellular locations of entries corresponding to six
known PTS2 targeted proteins as well as our candidates,
we noticed little agreement in the output of each prediction method (Additional File 8A). In fairness to the five
methods, it should be noted that they were not specifically designed to predict peroxisomal locations. A performance comparison by Sprenger et al. [33]
demonstrated an overall good performance for frequently
represented locations e.g., nuclear, cytoplasmic, extracellular and mitochondrial. CELLO, MultiLoc and WoLF
PSORT showed reduced sensitivity for under-represented
locations, such as peroxisomes.

Interestingly, pTarget [18] and CELLO [34] predicted five
of six sequences of known mammalian PTS2 targeted proteins correctly. WoLFPSORT [35] predicted Pex11c, Phyh,
Acaa1 and Acaa1b as mitochondrial, Apgt as cytoplasmic
and Mvk as extracelluar. Proteome Analyst [36] reported
two peroxisomal (Phyh), one cytoplasmic (Mvk), two
mitochondrial (Acaa1, Acca1b) and one unassigned locations (Pex11c). MultiLoc [37] is not trained to recognize
PTS2. The predictions of the PTS2-containing but nonperoxisomal located proteins coincided with experimentally reported locations for Galk2, Wdr6, Ppp3ca and
Pgm2, but varied for the other tested sequences.
Similarly, the recently identified PTS1-targeted Tynsd1,
Zadh2 of this study and three candidates, KBTBD10, Gab2
and Scarb2, were predicted by all five programs to locate
to various non-peroxisomal locations. LOCATE subcellular location summaries were not available for these proteins.

When using the dedicated PTS1 prediction methods of
PTS1Prowler [16] and PTS1Predictor [19] the concurrence
of results with experimentally determined locations
improved, particularly for PTS1Prowler. Details are
shown in Additional File 8B. Tysnd1 and Zadh2 were correctly predicted as PTS1 targeted with scores of 0.98 and
0.99 respectively. Since PTS1prowler is an add-on to the
general subcellular location predictor PProwler [16], prediction results indicated also a possible mitochondrial
location for Tysnd1 (score = 0.76). Zadh2 was given a
score (0.96), almost equal to the peroxisomal location
score (0.99), for an unspecified other subcellular location.
These predictions contrast independent experimental
results.
PTS1Predictor predicted all five proteins as peroxisometargeted, but with varying scores and false positive probabilities (Additional File 8B). The peroxisome-targeted
Tysnd1 received the highest score (16.264) and lowest
false positive probability followed by Gab2 (8.628), Scrab
(3.626) and KBTBD1 (2.734) which are actually non-peroxisomal. The peroxisomal Zadh1 had the lowest score
(2.052).
Another three PTS1 prediction tools are PeroxiP [34] and
PeroxisomeDB PTS1 Target Signal Predictor [30]. PeroxiP
could not be evaluated due to web server problems at the
time of preparing the manuscript. The Target Signal Predictor for PTS1 is using a twelve amino acid PTS1 position-specific scoring matrix for the Blimps search [28].
Since the Blimps search output provides hits over the
entire sequence length rather than the C-terminus were
PTS1 resides, the results require manual inspection by the
user.
Concept of oscillating PTS
The unsatisfactory outcome of the predictions suggests
that sequence-based features and evolutionary conservation, even in combination with manual annotation and
human-inferred supporting associations (e.g., Galk2 and
Ppp3ca; Additional File 4) are insufficient for predicting
the correct subcellular location, particularly for PTS2-containing candidates. Similar observations were made by
Neuberger et al. [13] for 23 vertebrate lysozyme sequences
containing a computational bona fide PTS1 sequence that
causes PTS1Predictor [19] to classify them as peroxisometargeted candidates. In fact, lysozymes are secreted proteins. When the N-terminal signal peptide was replaced by
a GFP tag, lysozyme was targeted to peroxisomes. Since
PTS1 became functional upon replacement of the signal
for secretion it was dubbed a "silent PTS", rather than a
false positive [13]. We believe that the existing disagreement about the cytosolic and peroxisomal locations of the
GMPH kinase family members mevalonate kinase [39-41]
and phosphomevalonate kinase [42,43] might be rooted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S12/S16

in PTSs that oscillate from "silent" to "functional",
depending on their surface accessibility. The localization
of the third GMPH kinase family member Galk2 in this
study may underlie the same mechanism.
The recently characterized peroxisomal matrix protein,
human soluble epoxide hydrolase (EPHX2) lends support
to our hypothesis. EPHX2 contains a rare PTS1 signal
(SKM) and two PTS2 signals [44]. It locates to the cytoplasm or peroxisome depending on the surface accessibility of PTS1 and protein expression level. The two PTS2
signals are non-functional due to surface inaccessibility.
In vivo data showed that the PTS1 signal poorly mediated
peroxisomal targeting if the EPHX2 protein expression
level was low. According to the authors, 90% of EPHX2 of
was found in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, increase
of EPXH2 PTS1 surface accessibility led to peroxisomal
import that was independent of the protein expression
level.
The concept of oscillating PTS should not be misunderstood as excuse for the poor performance of PTS2 predictions. Instead, it highlights the need to build PTS1 and
PTS2 predictors that can simulate the selection criteria of
Pex5 and Pex7 receptors. The comparison of free energy
differences of PTS1 peptide Pex5 receptor binding showed
mediocre correlation (0.44) with the PTS1Predictor scoring results [45]. Improvements in predicting PTS2 targeting are expected to come from the integration of PTS2
accessibility information gleaned from three-dimensional
structures of PTS2-containing proteins and quantitative
measurements of PTS2 peptide affinities to Pex7.
Improved prediction indicators may not entirely solve the
problem of differential subcellular sorting and interactions with cytosolic proteins or even other organelles.
Differential subcellular sorting and context dependency
For two peroxisomal enzymes, mammalian alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) [46-48] and yeast catalase
A (CTA1) [49] differential targeting has been associated
with changes in dietary or nutrient conditions. AGT has a
N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) and a Cterminal PTS1. The dual-targeting capacity of AGT to
locate preferentially to the peroxisomes (herbivors) or
mitochondria (carnivors) is likely correlated with the
shifting diet in the evolution of carnivors [46,47]. In case
of human AGT PTS1 targeting is further complicated by
the dependency on an ancillary 22 amino acid peroxisomal signal [48]. Analyses of AGT substitution ratios in the
MTS of primates [50] and Carnivora [46] indicated that
positive selection pressure by an increase of herbivorous
diet component in primates affected the N-terminal MTS
and use of two neighbouring in-frame translation initiation sites. The outcome is seen in a decreased or abolished
mitochondrial targeting capacity.

Indeed, statistical analysis of across 77 mammalian species demonstrated that the localization significantly correlated with diet rather than phylogeny [47]. For example,
in human, rabbit, and guinea pig AGT localises to the peroxisomes, whereas in dog and cat, AGT is predominantly
mitochondrial. In rat, AGT localises to both, peroxisomes
and mitochondria. Subcellular localisation testing of peroxisom-targeted enzymes over a wider range of species
may reveal more cases of diet context-dependent differences in targeting.
Even more striking is the nutrient-dependent differential
targeting of CTA1 in yeast [49]. CTA1, which has both
PTS1 and PTS2 signals but no mitochondrial targeting signal, localizes almost exclusively to the mitochondria
when grown on raffinose under respiratory conditions. If
the yeast is grown on oleate or on glucose under fermentation conditions, CTA1 is targeted to both peroxisomes
and mitochondria. Details of the molecular mechanism
and regulatory network are not known.
At last, the discovery of mitochondria-derived vesicles
(MDVs) [51] added yet another twist to the prediction of
subcellular protein locations. MDVs were shown to transport various mitochondrial proteins to peroxisomes
where they fuse with a subset, estimated to make up
around 10% of the peroxisomes [51,52]. Thus, actual
mitochondria-targeted (or predicted) proteins may localize in part via MDVs to peroxisomes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S12/S16

from location proteomics, protein structure analysis, and
quantitative PTS2 peptide Pex7 binding assays are
required to lift the performance of predictions. In a few
cases, the presence of a silent PTS2 indicated the potential
for conditional subcellular sorting which might be worthwhile to follow up. The surface accessibility and expression context-dependent PTS1-targeting of EHXP2 [40] is
an encouraging example. As CHO cells are considered a
model for mammalian peroxisome research, the stable
cell line CHO-perRed is expected to become an effective
tool for peroxisomal location research. In view of the
growing importance of subcellular localization we suggest
to promote the development of other peroxisomal marker
cell lines that cover cells of different ontology in parallel
to community-agreed computational and experimental
standards for peroxisomal localization.

Authors' contributions
Since the aforementioned findings complicate the peroxisomal targeting prediction, more data on the structure of
PTS-containing proteins and dynamics of peroxisome targeting process are needed to derive better prediction models. Dynamic changes in protein location depending on
the cell conditions can be captured by location proteomics [53]. The genome-based central dogma (CD) tagging
approach [54] which does not affect endogenous regulatory sequences combined with high throughput microscopy movies successfully detected previously unknown
cell cycle-dependent localization changes of nuclear proteins. The submission and collation of peroxisomal data
into growing integrated protein and genetic interaction
resources such as BioGRID [55] may help in the evaluation of false positives/negatives and improve our understanding of protein sorting to peroxisomal and other
subcellular locations.

Conclusion
The non-peroxisomal localization of all tested PTS2-targeted candidates in CHO-perRed demonstrated the
underperformance of computer-aided predictions of
PTS2-containing sequences. At least PTS2 prediction
methods, including ours will not improve by simply
amending algorithms. New experimental data, derived

YM and IVK performed all experiments. MH, IVK and CS
predicted and annotated the PTS candidates. YM, CS and
YO designed the study. CS, YM and YO wrote the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final version of
