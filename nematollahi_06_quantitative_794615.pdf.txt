Abstract
Background: The multicellular alga Volvox carteri possesses only two cell types: mortal, motile
somatic cells and potentially immortal, immotile reproductive cells. It is therefore an attractive
model system for studying how cell-autonomous cytodifferentiation is programmed within a
genome. Moreover, there are ongoing genome projects both in Volvox carteri and in the closely
related unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, gene sequencing is only the beginning.
To identify cell-type specific expression and to determine relative expression rates, we evaluate the
potential of real-time RT-PCR for quantifying gene transcript levels.
Results: Here we analyze a diversified pool of 39 target genes by real-time RT-PCR for each cell
type. This gene pool contains previously known genes with unknown localization of cellular
expression, 28 novel genes which are described in this study for the first time, and a few known,
cell-type specific genes as a control. The respective gene products are, for instance, part of
photosynthesis, cellular regulation, stress response, or transport processes. We provide
expression data for all these genes.
Conclusion: The results show that quantitative real-time RT-PCR is a favorable approach to
analyze cell-type specific gene expression in Volvox, which can be extended to a much larger number
of genes or to developmental or metabolic mutants. Our expression data also provide a basis for
a detailed analysis of individual, previously unknown, cell-type specifically expressed genes.

Background
The green alga Volvox carteri has a level of complexity representing an ideal model system for studies of multicellularity and cellular differentiation [1,2]; each wild-type
Volvox spheroid contains only two cell types, somatic cells
and reproductive cells (gonidia) (Fig. 1A). Both cell types
arise through a sequence of rapid symmetric and asymmetric cleavage divisions of a single gonidium. The two
cell types are arranged in a simple, well-defined pattern
and are different from each other with respect to physiol-

ogy, developmental potential, morphology, and size [3].
Not only is the simplicity of Volvox auspicious for developmental biologists, but its phylogenetic relationships are
also promising: Volvox and its simpler, but closely related,
unicellular and colonial relatives, the volvocine algae
Chlamydomonas, Gonium, Pandorina, Eudorina and Pleodorina, provide a coherent family of organisms for studying
the molecular evolution of multicellularity and cellular
differentiation [4]. Another outstanding advantage of volvocine algae is that there are ongoing genome projects

both for the multicellular alga Volvox carteri and for the
unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: Shotgun
sequencing of both nuclear genomes was performed in
each case at approximate 8× coverage by the Joint
Genome Institute (JGI, Walnut Creek, CA). For
Chlamydomonas, extensive cDNA and genomic sequence
information has already become publicly available [5],
with approximately 90% of the ~120 Mb nuclear genome
sequenced; genomic data and data from ~300 k ESTs have
been assembled into over 12,000 'unique' cDNAs, and
annotation proceeds. Regarding the Volvox genome,
which is about the same size as the Chlamydomonas
genome, only shotgun sequences with 1× coverage are
publicly available at the moment on the JGI sites, but the
completed 8× coverage genomic data will be released
before long; also ~80 k ESTs have already been sequenced
at JGI and will be released shortly.
Although determination of the sequence of every gene in
Volvox or any other species allows a better understanding
of the organism's physiological potential, it is just the first
step of a complete description of how the organism
works. One of the next steps should be the determination
of mRNA expression levels. Because it is known from
many species that much of the transcriptome is compartmentalized and Volvox is particularly suitable for studies
of multicellularity and cellular differentiation, it is logical
to start with an analysis of cell-type specific gene expression, i.e. somatic cells versus gonidia, in order to provide
a basis for disclosing cell-specific functions.
In earlier studies, 19 gonidia-specific and 12 somatic-cellspecific cDNAs have already been identified in wild-type

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/321

Volvox by a differential screen of cDNA libraries, and
abundance of the transcripts has been analyzed in each of
the cell types by Northern blots using radiolabeled restriction-digested DNA as probes [6]; two of these cDNAs/
genes have been added to our study as a reference (gon30,
gon167). Furthermore, a couple of interesting developmentally-controlled or cell-type specific genes and their
gene products have been identified by generating and analyzing mutants or by Mendelian analysis, e.g. the lag gene
product (late gonidia), which acts in large pregonidial
cells to repress somatic development [4,7,8], and the regA
gene product (somatic regenerator), which acts on
somatic cells to suppress gonidial development [9]. The
latter gene was also used as a control gene in our study.
Previously, it has also been shown that somatic cells and
gonidia display substantially different patterns of both
newly synthesized and accumulated major polypeptides
[10], but at that time, it was not possible to obtain discrete
sequences of these polypeptides, so their identity
remained unknown.
A different approach, which is used in this study, is to
investigate the different developmental programs in the
two cell types by characterizing the abundance of novel or
previously known mRNAs separately for each cell-type by
real-time RT-PCR studies. This method should allow a
considerable expansion of the number of genes investigated, studies done under different physiological conditions, and repeated experiments using mutant strains.
Here we show a quantitative analysis of a diversified pool
of about forty target genes with regard to cell-type specific
gene expression and relative expression rate in wild-type

individuals of the green alga Volvox carteri. The investigated gene pool contains previously known genes with
unknown localization, novel Volvox genes, which are
described in this study for the first time, and a few previously characterized genes with known cell-type specific
localization as controls. The corresponding gene products
are, for instance, part of photosynthesis, cellular regulation, stress response, or transport processes.

Results
Target genes for differential analysis
Our goal was to investigate a diversified pool of target
genes for cell-type specific expression. This pool contained both previously known genes with known or
unknown localization and new genes (e.g. identified by
homologs) with known, presumed, or unknown localization. The genes within this pool should vary both with
respect to presumed function (if information about the
function was available), e.g. genes related to photosynthesis, cellular regulation, stress response, or transport processes and also with respect to cellular localization (if any
information about the localization was available). Specifically, a pool of 39 genes was built that contained the following 7 subsets of genes (Table 1):

- Subset A: Known Volvox genes with known status of celltype specific expression (5 genes: actA, ssgA, regA, gon30,
gon167).
- Subset B: Known Volvox genes that have previously been
identified via characterized homologs in Volvox and in
which a cell-type specific expression is predictable due to
the characteristics of the homologous gene (1 gene: rlsA).
- Subset C: Known Volvox genes with putative cell-type
specific expression based on preliminary experiments (4
genes: csrp1, ard1, mrp2, gspk47).
- Subset D: Well-known Volvox genes with unknown status
of cell-type specific expression (1 gene: nitA).
- Subset E: New Volvox genes that were identified in this
project via characterized homologs in other species and in
which a cell-type specific expression is predictable due to
the characteristics of the homologs (7 genes: dyhA, klpA,
fer1, nab1, rap41, fbp1, cp12).
- Subset F: New Volvox genes that were identified in this
project via characterized homologs in other species but in
which the status of cell-type specific expression is not predictable (15 genes: prfA, fsd1, rpl37, glu1, hsp70B, hsp40A,
ubcA, ponA, mat3, vpeA, sac1, rcd1, adcA, nipA, lciB).
- Subset G: New Volvox genes for which no characterized
homologs in any other organism have been identified and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/321

for which, consequently, the status of cell-type specific
expression is unknown (6 genes: upf1, upf2, upf3, upf4,
upf5, upf6).
Characteristics of genes within subset A
Subset A contains 5 Volvox genes (Table 1). Each gene has
been investigated previously for cell-type specific expression. The actin gene actA, expressed uniformly in somatic
cells and gonidia [11], was used as a reference transcript in
several previous studies [12-14] and is therefore used as
the reference gene in the real-time experiments described
below. The gene coding for the extracellular matrix glycoprotein SSG185, ssgA, is known to be expressed mainly by
somatic cells [15]. Similarly, the regA gene, a key gene controlling cell differentiation in Volvox carteri by suppressing
reproductive activities in somatic cells, is expressed only
in somatic cells [9]. In a previously described search for
cell-type specific genes of Volvox carteri [6], several
gonidia-specific genes have been identified. Two of these
genes, gon30 and gon167, are included in our study. The
gon167 mRNA has been shown to be present in variable
but moderate levels in gonidia, with highest expression
levels at the beginning of cleavage and during cleavage
divisions. In contrast, the gon30 mRNA was at its lowest
during cell cleavages and had maximal expression much
later. For both gon30 and gon167, the mRNA level in
somatic cells has been shown to be low at all stages.
Characteristics of genes within subset B
Subset B contains only one Volvox gene (Table 1), the rlsA
gene, which has previously been identified via the homologous Volvox gene regA [9,16]. Partial sequences of rlsA
and regA show extensive similarity, including fully conserved exon/intron boundaries. Since regA is expressed
only in somatic cells (see above), a cell-type specific
expression of rlsA in somatic cells seems to be probable,
but cell-type specific expression has not been investigated
so far.
Characteristics of genes within subset C
Subset C contains 4 Volvox genes (Table 1) that have been
identified by differential screenings of cDNA libraries of
gonidia versus somatic cells in the group of Dr. R. Schmitt
(University of Regensburg, Germany) [17,18] and which
have been deposited in GenBank, but experimental details
are not available. Two of these genes are described as specific for somatic cells: a gene coding for a putative chloroplast-specific ribosome-associated protein (csrp1,
"KSS_k11") and one that codes for a putative arseniteresistance protein (ard1, "KSS_k05"). Both remaining
genes are described as specific for gonidia: a gene coding
for a putative ATP-energized ABC transporter (mrp2,
"KA_k18/MH_k18") and one that codes for a putative
gonidia-specific protein (gspk47, "KA_k47").

Table 1: List of 39 Volvox genes and gene products, including subset classification, comparisons with homologs in other species, and significance of the sequence relationship to these
homologs. (Continued)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:321

Characteristics of genes within subset D
Only one gene is within subset D (Table 1). It is the gene
that codes for nitrate reductase, nitA [19], which has previously been characterized in much detail. This gene is
also the standard selectable marker in Volvox transformation experiments [20]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge,
this well-investigated gene has never been analyzed for
cell-type specific expression in Volvox.
Characteristics of genes within subset E (novel Volvox
genes)
The seven genes within subset E (Table 1) were obtained
by searching the Volvox whole-genome shotgun reads at
the Chlamydomonas web site of the Joint Genome Institute
with sequences of well-known genes from other species.
The significance of the sequence relationship is illustrated
by a 100 residue long part of the sequence alignment (Fig.
2) and indication of percent identity and similarity (Table
1). A cell-type specific expression of these novel Volvox
genes seems to suggest itself due to the characteristics of
the homologs. Two of these seven genes, dyhA and klpA,
were predicted to be expressed in somatic cells. dyhA, is a
homolog of oda11 [21,22], a C. reinhardtii gene coding for
the flagellar outer row dynein alpha heavy chain. klpA
codes for a kinesin-like protein that is involved in motility
associated with the flagellar membrane [23] and has been
shown to be localized to the region between the axonemal
outer doublet microtubules and the flagellar membrane
in the unicell C. reinhardtii [24]. Because only somatic V.
carteri cells have flagella, a cell-type specific expression of
dyhA and klpA in somatic cells can be expected.

The other five genes were predicted to be expressed only
in the gonidia. They are nuclear genes that encode for
chloroplast-targeted proteins. fer1 encodes a ferredoxin;
this protein family contains Fe-S clusters which plays a key
role in electron-transfer during photosynthesis. nab1
codes for an RNA binding protein involved in the lightregulated differential expression of the light-harvesting
antenna [25]. rap41 codes a ribosome-associated protein,
which has been identified only in the 70S ribosome of the
chloroplast [26]. fbp1 encodes a chloroplast-specific fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, a key enzyme of the Calvin cycle
for photosynthetic CO2 assimilation [27]. cp12 codes for
Calvin cycle protein CP12, a small chloroplast protein,
which is essential for the assembly of the phosphoribulokinase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) complex [28]. In V. carteri, major metabolic
activities of the chloroplast are encoded by nuclear genes
that are attenuated in mature somatic cells [29], which is
why the small chloroplasts of somatic cells don't grow in
size. Therefore, photosynthesis-related nuclear genes
within subset E are expected to be expressed mainly
within the gonidia.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/321

Characteristics of genes within subset F (novel Volvox
genes)
As in subset E, all fifteen genes within subset F (Table 1)
were obtained by searching the Volvox whole-genome
shotgun reads at the Chlamydomonas web site of the Joint
Genome Institute with sequences of well-known genes
from other species (Fig. 2). In contrast to subset E, there is
no concrete information or indication about cell-type specific expression for any of these genes. The novel Volvox
genes within subset F code for the following proteins
(gene names in parentheses): profilin (prfA), an actin
binding protein [30]; superoxide dismutase (fsd1), a key
enzyme in the antioxidant defense system [31]; ribosomal

Characteristics of genes within subset G (novel Volvox
genes)
Subset G contains 6 Volvox genes with unknown function
and unknown localization (Table 1). Though we found
homologs of these genes in other species, especially in C.
reinhardtii, none of the homologous genes or gene products has previously been characterized. We named these
genes upf1, upf2, upf3, upf4, upf5, and upf6.

Selection of primer combinations and testing by genomic
PCR and RT-PCR
Oligonucleotide primers have been designed for the
selected 39 Volvox genes for real-time RT-PCR experiments. cDNA amplicons were planned to be only 100–
160 bp in size, which is an optimal size for real-time RTPCRs. When possible, primers were designed in two successive exons in order to uncover a potential contamination with genomic DNA, since such a product would be
larger than expected due to the intron in between. Exonintron prediction of Volvox genes was done using
FGENESH software (Softberry, Mount Kisco, NY) and by
polypeptide sequence comparisons with homologs from
other organisms using PROSIS software (version 7.00;
Hitachi Software Engineering, South San Francisco, CA).
Before utilization in real-time RT-PCR experiments, all
primers were tested by genomic PCR for their specificity
and reproducibility using total genomic DNA as a template. Simultaneously, the amplification conditions were
optimized (data not shown). When necessary, unsuitable
primers, which produced either the wrong product, a
weak product, or more than one product, were replaced,
and the procedure was repeated. Similarly, the primers
were also tested by standard RT-PCR, using total RNA as
template, in order to prove the quality of the oligonucleotide primers (data not shown). Primers that met all
requirements, i.e. there is only a single distinct amplicon
of the predicted size, are given in Table 2, and the sizes of
cDNAs and genomic DNAs (gDNAs) are listed as well.
Analysis of cell-type specific gene expression by real-time
RT-PCR experiments
Volvox spheroids were broken in a Dounce homogenizer,
and cell-size based separation of cell types was achieved
by successive filtration on screens of different mesh sizes
and a centrifugation step (Fig. 1B, C); total RNA was isolated from the separated cell types using the phenol-based
TRI Reagent (see Methods).

Real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed using the
selected primers (Table 2) and a DNA Engine Opticon
Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (see Methods). All real-time RT-PCR experiments have been carried
out in triplicate together with RT minus and no template
controls. The set of 39 genes was investigated separately
both in somatic cells and gonidia by using identical
amounts of RNA. For the sake of accuracy and precision,
it is necessary to collect quantitative data at a point in
which every sample is in the exponential phase of amplification, since it is only in this phase that amplification is
extremely reproducible. By way of example, the amplification curves of 6 genes, actA, gon167, ssgA, rpl37, fer1 and
regA, are illustrated in Figure 3. To detect and exclude nonspecific amplicons, the melting curves of all PCR products
have been analyzed (data not shown); moreover, all final

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/321

products have been investigated for multiple bands on
agarose gels; as an example, the result for the above mentioned 6 genes is shown in Figure 4. All obtained fragment
sizes have been compared to the calculated fragment sizes
(Table 2). Needless to say that RT minus and no template
controls always had to be free of any DNA product in
order to exclude the possibility of the amplification of
genomic DNA. A second primer pair has been chosen for
any gene of interest that had one ambiguous criterion.
Real-time RT-PCR products with correct sizes have also
been verified by sequencing (Fig. 5). Results from realtime PCR experiments that finally met all these requirements are shown in Table 3. All real-time RT-PCR experiments have been carried out in triplicate together with RT
minus and no template controls (see Methods). The
results were represented as cycle threshold (Ct) values.
There is an inverse correlation between Ct values and the
amount of target mRNA: higher amounts of target mRNA
have lower Ct values, and lower amounts of target mRNA
correspond to a higher Ct value. ΔCt was determined as the
mean of the triplicate Ct values for the target genes minus
the mean of the triplicate Ct values for the actin gene. ΔΔCt
represented the difference between the two cell types for a
given target gene, more precisely ΔΔCt = ΔCt (gonidia) - ΔCt
(somaticcells). Standard deviations for all ΔCt and ΔΔCt values
(gonidia versus somatic cells) are given within Table 3. To
allow a better overview and to show the wide spectrum of
expression rates, all ΔCt and ΔΔCt values (without standard deviations) are illustrated within a single figure (Fig.
6). actA was used as a reference, therefore 38 (not 39)
genes are shown. The actual expression level of a given target gene in one cell type versus the other cell type was analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method (see Methods). The results,
including standard deviations, are listed in Table 3, and
the 2-ΔΔCt values are illustrated in Figure 7. The calculation
results in 15 genes that are higher expressed in gonidia
than in somatic cells and 23 genes that are higher
expressed in somatic cells than in gonidia. However, 10 of
these genes show less than a two-fold difference in the
expression rate, namely gspk47, nitA, fbp1, glu1, hsp70B,
ponA, vpeA, upf1, upf2, and upf3, so the difference between
the two cell types is only minor or even insignificant. With
two additional genes, csrp1 and ard1, the standard deviation is higher than the difference in expression rate, so the
classification of both genes is questionable. Consequently, 10 genes remain which show an explicitly higher
expression rate in gonidia than in somatic cells (gon167,
fer1, nab1, rap41, cp12, prfA, fsd1, rpl37, rcd1, and upf4),
and another 16 genes demonstrate a definitively higher
expression rate in somatic cells than in gonidia (ssgA, regA,
gon30, rlsA, mrp2, dyhA, klpA, hsp40A, ubcA, mat3, sac1,
adcA, nipA, lciB, upf5, and upf6).

The greatest difference in expression rate between both
cell types was seen in dyhA which reveals a ~160-fold
higher expression in somatic cells than in gonidia.

Discussion
A quantitative analysis of cell-type specific gene expression by real-time RT-PCR requires a quick, efficient, and
quantitative method for the physical removal of one cell
type from another. After mechanical disruption of a multicellular organism, existing separation methods in other
species take advantage of cell size, density, surface charge,
hydrophobic surface properties, and antigen status in
order to separate cell types. These methods are quite complicated in the majority of cases and include sedimentation, centrifugal elutriation, partitioning in aqueous two-

phase systems, flow cytometry, immuno methods
(including magnetic, column, and panning techniques),
and free flow electrophoresis [45]. In contrast, viable Volvox cells can be separated quite easily (see Methods) (Fig.
1B, C).
To identify divergent transcriptional activities in the two
morphologically and functionally distinct cell types of
Volvox carteri, we analyzed a pool of 39 genes; these genes
were grouped into 7 subsets.
Gene subsets A-C: comparison of the obtained real-time
RT-PCR results with the expectations
Four out of five mRNAs of subset A were localized just as
expected: actA was expressed uniformly in somatic cells

ning of cleavages. In the case of gon30, we obviously compared only the minimal mRNA level in gonidia with that
of somatic cells; at this point, expression of gon30 is
higher in somatic cells than in gonidia.
The mRNA of the sole member of subset B, rlsA, was localized as expected. Similar to the homologous gene regA,
the rlsA gene is strongly expressed in somatic cells; there
was a ~69-fold higher expression in somatic cells than in
gonidia.

and gonidia and was used as a reference [11]. ssgA and
regA were expressed mainly in somatic cells, as previously
described [9,15]; ssgA showed a ~46-fold higher expression in somatic cells than in gonidia and expression of
regA was ~150-fold higher in somatic cells. The gonidiaspecific gene gon167 [6] showed a ~6-fold higher expression in gonidia, just as expected. Only the gonidia-specific
gene gon30 [6] didn't meet the expectations at first sight,
since there was a higher expression in somatic cells as
compared to gonidia. However, gon30 is a very late
"gonidial" gene [6], which has its maximal expression
after cell cleavages, and the mRNAs for our experiments
were isolated at the very beginning of cell cleavages. In
contrast to gon30, expression of gon167 peaks at the begin-

Subset C contained 4 genes with putative cell-type specific
expression based on preliminary experiments [17,18]. As
expected, csrp1 was expressed mainly in somatic cells, but
our result with this particular gene was not so clear due to
high standard deviations for the ΔCt and ΔΔCt values (see
above). gspk47 was expressed mainly in gonidia, as
expected, although the ΔΔCt value was rather low. We
couldn't confirm the localization of ard1 and mrp2: in our
hands ard1 was expressed mainly in gonidia, and mrp2
was expressed mainly in somatic cells, with a ~16-fold
higher expression in somatic cells. These results contradict
previous preliminary results. The discrepancies between
earlier results and our results within subset C might follow
from differences in the experimental approach: we used a
wild-type Volvox carteri strain for preparation of both
gonidia as well as somatic cells. In the group of Dr. R.Schmitt [17,18] a wild-type strain was used only for preparation of somatic cells, whereas the gonidia were isolated
from a regA-mutant strain in which the somatic cells dedifferentiated to gonidia because in this way it is much
easier to isolate large amounts of RNA from this cell type.
In the light of our results, it seems questionable that these
secondary gonidia of regA-mutants show exactly the same
expression pattern as wild-type gonidia. Another problem
might be that it is not possible to synchronize regAmutants (in contrast to wild-type algae); therefore every
RNA preparation from regA-mutants is more or less heterogeneous with respect to the developmental stage and
might even contain RNA from somatic cells that have not
begun to de-differentiate.
Gene subsets D-G: validation of the obtained real-time RTPCR results
Subset D contained only a single, well-known Volvox gene
with a previously unknown status of cell-type specific
expression. Here we show that this gene, nitA, is expressed
more or less uniformly in somatic cells and gonidia (there
is only an insignificant, 1.36-fold higher expression in
somatic cells). The gene product of nitA, nitrate reductase,
plays a central role in nitrate acquisition because it is the
first enzyme in the pathway, and it is required for growth
when nitrate is the sole nitrogen source. Therefore, it
makes sense that both cell types express this gene similarly.

Subset E covered 7 novel Volvox genes, dyhA, klpA, fer1,
nab1, rap41, fbp1, and cp12, which were identified via their
characterized homologs from other species and in which,
therefore, a cell-type specific expression seemed to be predictable due to the characteristics of the homologs. The
motility-related genes dyhA and klpA showed, respectively,
a ~160-fold and ~21-fold higher expression in somatic
cells. This is a reasonable result because in V. carteri only
somatic cells have flagella. Likewise, all five putative chloroplast/photosynthesis-related Volvox genes, fer1, nab1,
rap41, fbp1, and cp12, were shown to be expressed predominantly in gonidia. Since chloroplast/photosynthesisrelated metabolic activities are known to be localized
mainly in the huge chloroplasts of gonidia and only to a

minor degree in the small chloroplasts of somatic cells,
the obtained expression rates are logical.
All 15 new Volvox genes within subset F have been identified via characterized homologs in other species, but, in
contrast to the genes within subset E, the status of cell-type
specific expression of these genes was not predictable.
Four genes, prfA, fsd1, rpl37, and rcd1, were shown to be
expressed predominantly in gonidia, and another seven
genes, hsp40A, ubcA, mat3, sac1, adcA, nipA, and lciB, were
mainly expressed in the somatic cells. The last four genes,
hsp70B, glu1, vpeA, and ponA, were more or less uniformly
expressed in somatic cells and gonidia; hsp70B showed a
slightly higher expression level in gonidia, whereas glu1,

somatic cells; red circles: values from gonidia. Each pair of ΔCt values for a single gene is connected by a vertical black bar; the
length of this bar corresponds to the ΔΔCt value. actA was used as a reference and thus defines the zero line.
vpeA, and ponA expression was somewhat higher in
somatic cells.
Within subset G, which contains 6 new Volvox genes for
which no characterized homologs in any other organism
have been identified and the status of cell-type specific
expression was unknown, one gene, upf4, was mainly
expressed in gonidia, and two others, upf5 and upf6, were
shown to be expressed predominantly in somatic cells.
upf2 showed only a somewhat higher expression in
gonidia, and expression of upf1 and upf3 was just slightly
higher in somatic cells; these three genes were more or less
uniformly expressed in the different cell types. Future
experiments will have to reveal the concrete functions of
the genes within subset G.
Taking into account all the gene subsets, it can be stated
that if a prediction for expression in a specific cell-type
was possible, this prediction came true, except for two
genes within subset C. However, the discrepancy within
subset C can possibly be explained by differences in the
experimental approach (see above). Our findings with

respect to the gon30 gene serve as a warning to any future
investigators who employ these methods that it will be
important to pay not only close attention to the spatial
aspects of differential gene expression but also to temporal aspects; in addition, environmental conditions (light,
temperature, culture medium etc.) should be kept in
mind.
As expected, gonidia and somatic cells clearly differ in the
composition of their mRNA pools, since it is this difference in cell-type specific gene expression which finally
accounts for the different phenotypes of the two cell types.
A cell-type specific gene expression does not necessarily
result from a cell-type specific activation of these genes
but can also come from a cell-type specific inhibition in
the other cell-type. For example, it is known that the regulatory protein RegA acts on somatic cells to suppress
gonidial development by inhibiting genes whose products are required for chloroplast biogenesis [9].

Conclusion
The results show that quantitative real-time RT-PCR is a
favorable approach to analyze cell-type specific gene
expression in Volvox carteri. Our approach not only provides a basis for a detailed analysis of individual, previously unknown Volvox genes of the investigated set of
genes but also allows for future analysis of the same set of

genes (by using the same primers and other RT-PCR conditions) with respect to inducibility by stress, wounding,
deficiency or abundance of nutritional compounds, or
response on the presence of the sex-inducer (the trigger of
sexual development in V. carteri). Furthermore, it allows a
characterization of the transcription of these genes in the
life cycle (probably without separating cell-types because

a separation of cell types from embryos or juveniles can
not be achieved earlier than 18–20 h after the onset of
embryogenesis, and embryonic and parent somatic cells
can't be separated from each other even later [6]. It is also
possible to repeat these experiments using developmental
or metabolic mutants instead. Finally, this approach can
also be extended to a much larger number of genes. We
hope that our analysis of cell-type specific expression of
almost 40 genes was able to stimulate discussion about
the application of a genome-wide expression analysis in
Volvox in order to reveal the complete germ-soma program of this fascinating green alga.

Methods
Culture conditions
The wild-type Volvox carteri f. nagariensis strain EVE
(female) was obtained from D.L. Kirk (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and was described previously [46].
Cultures were grown in Volvox medium [47] at 30°C in an
8 h dark/16 h light (10000 lux) cycle [48].
Sequence analysis and homology search
The sequences of cDNA and genomic DNA fragments
were compared with each other to exclude duplicates and
to identify overlapping sequences which belong to the
same gene by using DNASIS software (version 7.00;
Hitachi Software Engineering, South San Francisco, CA).
Homology searches with cDNA and genomic DNA fragments in different sequence databases were performed
using BLAST [49]. Initially, Volvox carteri f. nagariensis
whole-genome shotgun reads at the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii web site (version 3.0) of the Joint Genome Institute
(JGI) [5] were screened using BLASTn and blocks substitution matrix 62 (BLOSUM62) [50] for pairwise sequence
alignment with a cut-off expectation value (E-value) of 105 and a word size of 3 (filtering disabled). Subsequently,
the sequence databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [51] were searched for
homologous protein sequences using tBLASTx with an
expect threshold of 10, a word size of 3, gap costs of 11 for
opening a gap, and gap costs of 1 for extending a gap (filtering disabled). Finally, the Chlamydomonas EST database
at the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii web site (version 3.0) of
JGI [5] was screened using tBLASTx and the BLOSUM62
scoring matrix with a cut-off E-value of 10-5 and a word
size of 11 (filtering disabled).
Primer design
Oligonucleotide primers for all PCR, standard RT-PCR or
real-time RT-PCR were designed using the primer analysis
software Oligo 6 (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade,
CO), Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA), or DNASIS software (version 7.00; Hitachi Software
Engineering, South San Francisco, CA). The primers used
for real-time RT-PCR experiments are listed in Table 2.

Large-scale separation of cell types
Shortly before the onset of cell cleavage of reproductive
cells (gonidia), 10-liter cultures of synchronously grown
V. carteri spheroids were harvested by filtration on a 100μm mesh nylon screen, and the concentration of organisms was brought to ~1000 spheroids/ml with Volvox
medium. To obtain gonidia, the spheroids were broken
up in a 50 ml Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting
pestle (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) by moving the
pestle up and down twice. The cell suspension was filtered
through a 100 μm nylon screen, and the flow-through was
filtered through a 40 μm nylon screen. Only free gonidia,
single somatic cells, and small cell sheets containing several ECM-embedded somatic cells can pass the 40 μm
nylon screen, whereas larger cell sheets, hemispheres of
the spheroids, or spheroids which have only been slit
remain on the nylon screens. The gonidia were separated
from most residual somatic cells and ECM fragments by
centrifuging for 5 min at 350 g in 7% (v/v) Percoll (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO). Individual somatic cells that
remained after this procedure were removed from the
gonidia by filtering through a 10 μm nylon screen. Single
somatic cells pass this screen, in contrast to gonidia. The
gonidia were washed on the screen three times with 100
ml Volvox medium each and were used for the gonidial
RNA preparation.

To obtain somatic cells, spheroids were broken up in the
50 ml Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle as
described above, exept the pestle was moved up and down
seven times. The obtained cell suspension was diluted
with medium to the two-fold volume and kept at room
temperature for 20 min. Gonidia and larger fragments of
spheroids that contain gonidia settled during this time by
unit gravity. By contrast, somatic cell sheets without
gonidia floated to the surface, were drawn off, and were
used for the somatic RNA preparation.
Isolation of total RNA
Extraction of total RNA was done using 1 g frozen gonidia
or somatic cells, 10 ml of the phenol-based TRI Reagent
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 3 ml trichloromethane. RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase with
isopropanol. RNA pellets were washed twice with 75%
ethanol, air dried, and dissolved in RNase-free (DEPC
treated) distilled water. RNA quantitation and purity
check were done by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and by measuring absorption at 260 and 280 nm
with an Ultrospec 2100 pro UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).
Isolation of genomic DNA
Genomic DNA was isolated from Volvox algae using the
DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA
quantitation and purity check were done by agarose gel

electrophoresis and UV-photometry using an Ultrospec
2100 pro UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden).
Genomic PCR
Genomic PCR was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl
containing ~100 ng of genomic DNA, 1 μM of each
primer, 0.1 mM dNTP, and 2 units Taq DNA polymerase
in 1× PCR reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10
mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 % Triton X100, 1 mg/ml BSA). Forty cycles (95°C, 20 s; 55°C, 30 s;
72°C, 1 min) were performed with a T3 Thermocycler
PCR system (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The lengths
of PCR products were determined by comparison with
DNA size markers (100 bp DNA marker, Fermentas, St.
Leon-Rot, Germany and 1 kb DNA ladder, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Products of PCR amplification were cloned
into the pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)
and sequenced.
Standard RT-PCR
For standard RT-PCR, first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)
reverse transcriptase lacking ribonuclease H activity (H
minus) (Promega, Madison, WI). 1 μg total RNA was
incubated with 10 pmol of a specific reverse primer in a
total volume of 14 μl at 70°C for 5 min and cooled immediately on ice for 5 min. After addition of 5 μl MMLV RT
5× reaction buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3 at 25°C, 250
mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 50 mM DTT), 1.25 μl 10 mM
dNTPs, and 200 units MMLV RT (H minus), cDNA synthesis was performed at 50°C for 60 min in a total volume
of 25 μl. PCR was subsequently carried out using 10 μl of
the reverse transcription mixture, 1 μM of each primer, 0.2
mM dNTPs, and 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase in 1× PCR
reaction buffer in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR was performed on a T3 Thermocycler PCR system (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) using the following cycling conditions:
45 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 40
s. Products of RT-PCR amplification were cloned into
pSPT18/pSPT19 vectors (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) and
sequenced.
Real-time RT-PCR
1 μg total RNA was treated with 5 units DNaseI (Promega,
Madison, WI) in DNase-I buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.4, 2
mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl) in a total volume of 10 μl at
37°C for 10 min to remove contaminating DNA within
the RNA preparation. The reaction was stopped by the
addition of 1 μl 25 mM EDTA and incubation at 65°C for
10 min. Real-time quantification of RNA targets was done
using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Use of 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green RTPCR Master Mix together with the QuantiTect RT Mix
allows both reverse transcription and PCR to take place in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/321

a single tube. The components of 2× QuantiTect SYBR
Green RT-PCR Master Mix include HotStarTaq DNA
Polymerase, QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR buffer, the
fluorescent dye SYBR Green I, and the passive reference
dye ROX. The QuantiTect RT Mix contains Omniscript
and Sensiscript Reverse Transcriptases. Reactions contained 300 ng DNase-I-treated template RNA, 0.8 μM of
each primer, 12.5 μl 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR
Master Mix, and 0.25 μl QuantiTect RT Mix in a total volume of 25 μl. Reverse transcription occured at 50°C for 30
min. The subsequent incubation at 95°C for 15 min denatured the cDNA template, deactivated the reverse transcriptases, and activated the HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase.
After this, 40 cycles of PCR amplification (95°C, 20 sec;
55°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 40 sec) followed. All real-time RTPCR reactions were performed using a DNA Engine Opticon Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (MJ
research, Waltham, MA). This system excites fluorescent
dyes with absorption spectra in the 450 to 495 nm range,
like SYBR Green I, and sensitive optics detect fluorophores
with emission spectra in the 515–545 nm range (like
SYBR Green I). Results were analyzed using OpticonMonitor software (version 1.06, MJ research, Waltham, MA).
All real-time RT-PCR experiments were carried out in triplicate together with RT minus (RTM) and no template
controls (NTC). The final products of all real-time RT-PCR
reactions were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis to
assure amplification of a single product and to verify the
size of the cDNA products by comparison with a 100 bp
ladder (100 bp Marker, Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany).
Analysis of gene expression by using the 2-ΔΔCt method
The expression level of a given target gene in gonidia versus somatic cells was analyzed using real-time RT-PCR
and the 2-ΔΔCt method [52,53]. The Volvox actin gene,
which is known to be similarly expressed in both cell
types [11], was used as an internal control in all real-time
RT-PCR experiments. In order to apply the 2-ΔΔCt method
[52,53], the results of real-time RT-PCRs were represented
as cycle threshold (Ct) values. The Ct value was defined as
the cycle at which a sample crosses a threshold which is
significantly above the background fluorescence and
within the exponential phase of the amplification. The
average from three Ct measurements was calculated for
both the given target gene and the actin gene. ΔCt was
determined as the mean of the triplicate Ct values for the
target genes minus the mean of the triplicate Ct values for
the actin gene. For each target gene, ΔCt measurements
were performed separately for each cell type. The ΔΔCt
represented the difference between the two cell types for a
given target gene, more precisely ΔΔCt = ΔCt (gonidia) - ΔCt
(somatic cells). The ×-fold higher expression of a given target
gene in gonidia compared to somatic cells was calculated
as 2-ΔΔCt. If expression of a given target gene was lower in

gonidia as compared to somatic cells, the expression was
calculated by 1/2-ΔΔCt.
