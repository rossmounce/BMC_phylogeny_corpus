Evolutionary dynamics of a conserved sequence
motif in the ribosomal genes of the ciliate
Paramecium
Francesco Catania*, Michael Lynch

Abstract
Background: In protozoa, the identification of preserved motifs by comparative genomics is often impeded by
difficulties to generate reliable alignments for non-coding sequences. Moreover, the evolutionary dynamics of
regulatory elements in 3’ untranslated regions (both in protozoa and metazoa) remains a virtually unexplored issue.
Results: By screening Paramecium tetraurelia’s 3’ untranslated regions for 8-mers that were previously found to be
preserved in mammalian 3’ UTRs, we detect and characterize a motif that is distinctly conserved in the ribosomal
genes of this ciliate. The motif appears to be conserved across Paramecium aurelia species but is absent from the
ribosomal genes of four additional non-Paramecium species surveyed, including another ciliate, Tetrahymena
thermophila. Motif-free ribosomal genes retain fewer paralogs in the genome and appear to be lost more rapidly
relative to motif-containing genes. Features associated with the discovered preserved motif are consistent with this
8-mer playing a role in post-transcriptional regulation.
Conclusions: Our observations 1) shed light on the evolution of a putative regulatory motif across large
phylogenetic distances; 2) are expected to facilitate the understanding of the modulation of ribosomal genes
expression in Paramecium; and 3) reveal a largely unexplored–and presumably not restricted to Paramecium–
association between the presence/absence of a DNA motif and the evolutionary fate of its host genes.

Background
Conserved motifs in 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) have
been identified in several organisms, including vertebrates [1,2], Drosophila [3-6], nematodes [6,7], S. cerevisiae [8], plants [9] and protozoa [10,11]. The function of
these preserved sequences has often been revealed and
may vary, being for example associated with cytoplasmic
localization of the motif-containing mRNA and/or modulation of gene expression level. The regulatory aspect
of conserved 3’ UTR sequences has received large attention in recent years, and it has become apparent that 3’
UTRs motifs often play a major role in post-transcriptional regulation [12], via their binding with microRNAs
(miRNAs) [2,13]. Despite these crucial functions and
some significant efforts to catalogue 3’ UTR signals
[2,8], we still know relatively little of the evolutionary
dynamics of these cis-regulatory sequences.

In this article, we report the discovery of a conserved
motif in the 3’ UTRs of genes in the ciliate Paramecium
tetraurelia and describe a number of features associated
with this sequence (e.g., presence/absence across nonParamecium species, evolutionary fate of the genes that
carry the motif in their 3’ UTR, and putative association
with miRNAs). The detected motif–GUACAUUA–and a
number of its variants are also conserved in mammalian
3’ UTRs [2]. However, while no particular association
with any gene class is reported for mammals, in P. tetraurelia both GUACAUUA and several of its degenerate
variants are most frequently contained in the 3’ UTRs of
ribosomal protein genes.

Results
Previously described mammalian 3’ UTR motifs are found
in the 3’ UTRs of P. tetraurelia ribosomal protein genes

We surveyed P. tetraurelia 3’ UTRs for the presence of
conserved motifs. To this end, we did not take advantage of a motif-discovery computer program, instead we

Sequences that overlap the most abundant motif (GUACAUUA) are
underlined. The expected average number of hits (standard deviation is in
parentheses) is obtained by screening 25 sets of randomly generated DNA
sequences, whose length and nucleotide composition are identical to the 3’
UTRs sequences of the original dataset. * = estimate based on genes with
annotated function

initially screened the untranslated regions for a set of 8mers that have been found to be conserved in mammalian 3’ UTRs [2]. We found that 384 (71.1%) of these
motifs hit the set of the Paramecium 3’ UTR sequences,
with the vast majority of the 8-mers yielding only one or
a few hits (81% yielded ≤ 10 hits). Among the motifs
that most frequently hit the Paramecium 3’ UTRs
(Table 1), several share sequence similarity and partially
overlap with the motif GUACAUUA, which yielded the
highest number of hits, being detected in 127 3’ UTRs.
The analysis of the function of the genes containing the
most recurrent motifs revealed a pronounced association
with ribosomal genes (Table 1). 100 out of 113 genes
with annotated functions that contain the sequence
GUACAUUA code for ribosomal protein-coding genes

(the motif is additionally found in the 3’ UTRs of two
likely ribosomal genes that are annotated as part of putative chimeric transcription units in the P. tetraurelia genome, GSPATP00006003001 and GSPATP00004104001).
In these genes, the start of the GUACAUUA motif is
positioned at an average distance of 18.95 bp (SD = 5.12)
from the translation termination codon. The function of
the 11 remaining genes is provided in Table 2; most of
these genes code for proteins that are membrane-associated or involved in membrane biogenesis, and for factors that participate in transcription, RNA processing
and regulation, and translation.
We collected all genes that code for ribosome-associated proteins in P. tetraurelia (n = 472, on the basis of
BLAST best hits against the UNIPROT database), and
used the program MEME to screen their 3’ UTRs, to
verify both that the most likely width of the conserved
motif in the ciliate is eight bases as in mammals and
that these 3’ UTRs contain no common motifs other
than those we detected. The motif-discovering software
found a single, highly conserved (E-value = 3.3e-331)
motif of 15 nucleotides, which clearly contains a major
8-mer core, essentially reflecting the previously
described mammalian motif we found in the initial
screening (Figure 1).
We next investigated the number of ribosomal genes
containing single-nucleotide degenerate variants of the
motif GUACAUUA and found that 224 (out of 472) of
the 3’ UTRs show a single mismatch to the motif. The
average distance of the set of GUACAUUA singlenucleotide variants from the translation termination
codon, as calculated for 194 unique hits, is 17.49 bp (SD
= 13.57) but decreases to 16.32 bp (SD = 6.86) when
two outliers (105 bp and 154 bp distant from the termination codon) are not accounted for in the analysis.
We noticed that only fifteen of the twenty-four possible single-nucleotide degenerate GUACAUUA variants
were contained in the ribosomal 3’ UTRs. In particular,
we consistently detected 1) no motif variant with a base

other than adenine at the third and fifth position, 2) no
motif variant with either cytosine or guanine at the
sixth position, and 3) a low frequency of adenine and
cytosine as well as the absence of guanine at the seventh
motif position (Figure 1).
We used the observations above, i.e., which nucleotides are either fixed or show highest frequency at each
of the eight motif sites, to screen ribosomal 3’ UTRs
that contain neither GUACAUUA nor any of its singledegenerate variants, for a number of further degenerated, yet putatively functional, GUACAUUA variants.
Specifically, we used the following degenerate motif
(AGU)UA(CU)A(AU)U(AU), where the most degenerate
nucleotides are presented within brackets, while the
fixed nucleotides are in bold. Henceforth, we will refer
to this set of motif variants using the consensus
sequence DUAYAWUW, according to the appropriate
IUPAC annotation. The consensus motif is positioned at
a distance of 16.79 bp (SD = 11.37) from the translation
termination codon. Sixty-two ribosomal genes (out of
472) did not contain the DUAYAWUW motif in their 3’
UTR (Additional file 1).
GUACAUUA and its variants appear conserved in
Paramecium but not in other species

We examined the degree of conservation of the detected
ribosomal 3’ UTR motif for four genes across multiple
Paramecium species and verified that the ribosomal
motif is conserved at this level–the inter-specific degree
of sequence divergence was relatively low across the
whole 3’ UTRs however (data not shown). To further
characterize the motif conservation across Paramecium
species, we then BLASTed the motif-containing P. tetraurelia ribosomal 3’ UTRs against the unassembled contigs of the newly sequenced (yet unreleased)
Paramecium biaurelia macronuclear DNA. The net
average pairwise divergence at nuclear silent sites
between P. biaurelia and P. tetraurelia ranges between
0.30 and 0.45 (depending on the inclusion of outlier
strains [14]). The analysis of the putative orthologous 3’
UTRs in P. biaurelia suggests that the exact motif
GUACAUUA is also conserved in this species.

Specifically, when we BLAST the 100 GUACAUUAcontaining ribosomal 3’ UTRs against the P. biaurelia
macronuclear DNA, we retrieve hits for 88 of them and
in the 47 cases for which we could infer (putative)
orthology, the motif was virtually always completely
conserved (46 out of 47)(Additional file 1).
Finally, we screened the ribosomal 3’ UTRs of four
additional species, T. thermophila, H. sapiens, D. melanogaster and A. thaliana and found that none of these
species contains an excess of the ribosomal motif conserved in P. tetraurelia (Table 3). For each of these four
species, we further verified whether the motif GUACAUUA significantly hits 3’ UTR sequences of gene
classes that are not ribosomal. Gene Ontology annotation tools, g:Profiler [15] and GOEAST [16], and visual
inspection hint at a slight enrichment for this motif in
genes that code for proteins that are involved in: in H.
sapiens, regulation of macromolecule biosynthesis and
amino acid transport across the plasma membrane
(respectively 67 and 5 proteins out of a total of 273 proteins); in D. melanogaster, cell projection organization
(12 out of a total of 117 proteins); in A. thaliana, binding (32 out of a total of 92 proteins). No clear enrichment in a particular gene classis observed for
T. thermophila.

its single nucleotide degenerate variants is examined in

Ribosomal genes that lack the motif or retain only
uncommon 3’ UTR motif variants are lost more rapidly

The DUAYAWUW motif may serve a significant role
for the biological activity of ribosomal genes in P. tetraurelia. Thus, we hypothesized that the protein-coding
sequence of ribosomal genes that do not contain the 3’
UTR DUAYAWUW motif may tend to show lower
levels of evolutionary constraints compared to motifcontaining ribosomal genes.
We tested this hypothesis by taking advantage of the
most recent whole genome duplications detected in P.
tetraurelia. This duplication event is thought to have
occurred in P. aurelia before the emergence of the 15
species–one of which is P. tetraurelia–that today belong
to the P. aurelia complex [17,18]. We found that the
Ka/Ks ratio is comparable between motif-free and motifcontaining genes. However, synonymous sites, but not
non-synonymous sites, appear to evolve more rapidly
between paralogous genes where at least one of the two
genes lacks the 3’ UTR DUAYAWUW motif (t-test, P(1tail) = 0.0075) (Figure 2), and this faster sequence evolution extends to the 3’ UTR sequences (U-test, P(1-tail) =
0.0365). We also observed that in paralogous genes containing DUAYAWUW, the motif sequence is highly
conserved (i.e., the motif sequence is typically identical
between paralogs) and that no correlation exists
between motif diversity and Ks (data not shown). Also,
motif-containing ribosomal genes appear to retain a larger number of paralogs and to be more highly expressed
compared to genes that only contain the rarest motif
variants or no motif at all (5.08 vs 4.00, M-W test,
P(1-tail) = 0.0014; average ESTs number: 15.33 vs. 9.60,

at least one of the copies does not contain this motif.

M-W test, P(1-tail) < 0.001). Finally, the set of ribosomal
genes that do not have a paralog that derives from the
recent polyploidization event (n = 28) is enriched with
motif-free genes. Specifically, the latter set contains 11
(of 47) motif-free genes and only 17 (of 373) motif-containing genes (Fisher’s Exact Test, P(1-tail) = 2.5 × 10-4).
Can the detected conserved motif be a miRNA target?

The conserved mammalian 3’ UTRs motifs described by
Xie et al. [2] show a distinct bias in DNA strand location, being preferentially conserved in the coding strand.
This observation, jointly with both the 8-base motif
length and the high frequency of an adenine as the ending nucleotide, led these authors to hypothesize a regulation activity associated with miRNAs, a hypothesis
subsequently confirmed by experiments for a number of
these motifs.
When we studied the strand specificity of the ribosomal motif (and motif variants), we found a pronounced
abundance of the motif on the coding strand (it must be
noted that a putative equally functional complementary
motif is clearly just as abundant on the opposite strand).
Indeed, the frequencies we reported above only refer to
the presence of both GUACAUUA and its variants in
the forward strand. When we searched for this motif on
the complementary strand, we no longer observed an
overrepresentation, and in fact we found no hits for the
motif GUACAUUA on the complementary strand. The
strand specificity we observe suggests that this 3’ UTR
motif acts at the RNA rather than at the DNA level and
thus plays a role in post -transcriptional regulation.
How likely is it that the newly discovered motif is also
a miRNA target in Paramecium? We addressed this
question by taking advantage of some of the findings of
a recent large-scale study of miRNAs in metazoans [19]:
1) uracil (U) is the most frequent nucleotide in mature
miRNA sequences–being particularly enriched at the
first and the ninth nucleotide positions, i.e., sites that
immediately flank the miRNA “seed” region, which is
believed to have a critical role in binding the target
sequences; and 2) guanine(G) is significantly depleted at
position one.
Assuming that protozoans share the same or similar
features with miRNAs in metazoans, an initial inspection of the sequence that is reverse complementary to
the conserved ribosomal motif, i.e., UAAUGUAC (this
sequence represents a portion of the putative miRNA
sequence and includes, underlined, the seed region), is
broadly consistent with features that are reminiscent of
miRNA in metazoans (i.e., U is enriched at the first
position, where G is scarcely found). A closer analysis of
the motif profile points to a higher level of resemblance.
Specifically, the pictogram representation of the consensus motif presented in Figure 1 reveals the frequent

Catania and Lynch BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:129
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/129

occurrence of an A (or less frequently a C or a U, but
very rarely a G) upstream of the consensus ribosomal
motif, at position nine; such an enrichment in As is illustrated by the high frequency (76%) with which an A
immediately precedes the 100 GUACAUUA motifs that
we found in the ribosomal 3’ UTRs of P. tetraurelia (the
frequency of adenines in the examined set of 3’ UTRs is
44.1%). This suggests that the putative complementary
miRNA sequence is likely to contain a U not only at
position one but also at position nine, in agreement
with what has been described for miRNA in metazoans.
If the complementary UAAUGUAC sequence is part
of the miRNA sequence that targets the conserved ribosomal motif, then one could expect to find a region of
the macronuclear DNA of P. tetraurelia containing this
motif (along with its complementary version) and having
a stable secondary structure that is typical of miRNA
precursors. Alternatively the putative miRNA sequence
could be located in the micronuclear DNA–in Paramecium there are two nuclei, the macronucleus (the
somatic nucleus) and the micronucleus (the germline
nucleus). In an attempt to identify a putative premiRNA, we screened the available P. tetraurelia macronuclear genome [20] for stem-loop structures containing
the motif seed and its complementary version that are
separated by up to 200 base pairs and flanked upstream
and downstream by an arbitrary number of bases (10,
20 and 30 bps).
This screening yielded a total of 284 candidate premiRNAs. For each of these candidate elements we
assessed the stability of the secondary structure by measuring: 1) the minimum free energies (MFE), as predicted by the RNAfold program [21]; the parameter
AMFE ([MFE/length]*100)), which provides an estimate
of stability that is not influenced by differences in RNA
sequences length; and MFEI (AMFE/(G+C)%), an index
that appears to be valuable in distinguishing miRNAs
from other coding and non-coding RNAs [22], and
whose absolute values are consistently close or higher
than 0.85 when experimentally confirmed miRNAs in
metazoans are examined [19,22]. The study of these
parameters across the candidate pre-miRNAs led to the
identification of a putative pre-miRNA that, irrespective
of the arbitrary number of flanking bases, showed consistently both low AMFE values (-28.69 ± 7.25), which
are comparable to those detected for confirmed miRNAs
in metazoans [19], and absolute values of MFEI close to
or higher than 0.85 (0.98 ± 0.20). This candidate premiRNA, whose MFE structure is shown in Figure 3a,
matches none of the currently available P. tetraurelia
ESTs, has a single hit in the P. tetraurelia genome and
is located in a region that is devoid of genes.
It is worth noting that a screening of the P. tetraurelia
EST sequences led to the identification of an additional

Page 5 of 10

candidate pre-miRNA. This further putative pre-miRNA
is detected in an EST that only partly matches the 3’
end of a 60S ribosomal protein-coding gene. Specifically,
while the 5’ end sequence of this EST matches the ribosomal gene sequence as well as the homologous region
of other ESTs that have been mapped to this gene, its 3’
end sequence shows a unique profile that differs both
from the sequence of the genomic DNA and the
remaining ESTs that match this region. This EST’s
peculiar 3’ end sequence is capable to form an extremely
stable structure (AMFE average: -43.61 ± 9.26; MFEI
average: -2.47 ± 0.36) (Figure 3b).
Additional motifs in the 3’ UTRs of P. tetraurelia

We finally screened the P. tetraurelia 3’ UTRs for the
presence of the hexanucleotide typically associated with
polyadenylation in mammals (AAUAAA), and k-mer
motifs that were previously found to be highly conserved in worms (n = 442) and flies (n = 497) [6]. The
latter two sets of motifs include both verified and putative miRNA targets as well as GU and AU-rich elements
and PUF-binding sites. We found that the AAUAAA
motif hits the whole set of P. tetraurelia 3’ UTRs 1780
times (the number expected by chance–obtained by
screening 25 sets of randomly generated DNA
sequences, whose length and nucleotide composition are
identical to the 3’ UTR sequences of the original dataset–is 1599 (SD = 27.81)), and is located an average distance of 29.39 bp (SD = 30.92) from the translation
termination codon. We also found that several U-rich kmers that are conserved in worm and/or flies, appear to
be overrepresented in P. tetraurelia 3’ UTRs. Aside
from the GUACAAU and UGUACAUU motifs–which
resemble the GUACAUUA sequence we describe above,
and as such appear to be preferentially located in ribosomal 3’ UTRs (64.5% and 43.3% respectively)–these
overrepresented motifs are not clearly associated with a
specific class of proteins, occur at various frequencies,
and are located at different positions along the 3’ UTRs
(Table 4).

Discussion and Conclusions
A growing body of literature is providing critical information about innovative strategies for the identification
of conserved cis-regulatory motifs [23-25] and about the
regulatory interactions between conserved UTR
sequences and miRNAs [2,6,12,13,26-30]. However, the
evolutionary dynamics of conserved UTR motifs remain
virtually unexplored.
In this article, we have reported the discovery and the
characterization of a conserved 8-mer motif–GUACAUUA–as well as several of this motif’s degenerated
variants, in the 3’ UTRs of P. tetraurelia ribosomal-protein genes. By studying the distribution frequency of

GUACAUUA single-nucleotide degenerated variants, we
yielded the profile of the conserved consensus motif
(DUAYAWUW), where four nucleotides are perfectly
conserved and nucleotide frequencies at the remaining
four positions tend to be skewed toward a single nucleotide (Figure 1). The region occupied by the preserved
ribosomal sequence has overall a narrow size and the
motif is relatively close to the translation termination
codon (average distance of the start of the motif from
termination codon is 17.9 bp [SD = 7.30]). Both the
positional range and the relative distance from the termination codon are smaller when compared to the corresponding values estimated for additional motifs we
found to be overrepresented in P. tetraurelia3’ UTRs
(Table 4).
The study of the degree of conservation of the detected
motif across Paramecium and non-Paramecium species

shows that this motif is broadly conserved across multiple Paramecium species but is typically absent from the
ribosomal genes of three multicellular organisms and,
most notably, from another ciliate species (T. thermophila), which is distinct both morphologically and
molecularly [31], yet an Oligohymenophoran like Paramecium. Unfortunately, the absence of genome sequence
and EST information for species that are phylogenetically
closer to Paramecium currently complicates the attempt
to further trace back the evolutionary origin of the motif
(but see below).
The hypothesis that the mere presence/lack of the
motif can in some way influence (or be influenced by)
the rate of protein-coding sequence evolution is not supported by the similar levels of constraints at non-synonymous sites observed for motif-free and motif-containing
ribosomal genes (Figure 2). However, the study of Ks and

3’ UTR sequence variation between duplicated ribosomal
genes reveals higher rates of nucleotide substitutions at
silent and 3’ UTR sites in motif-free ribosomal genes
compared with motif-containing genes. An explanation
for the association between the lack of motif and the faster evolution at silent and 3’ UTR sites may be non-biological. Specifically, the motif-free ribosomal genes we used
to estimate nucleotide variation may not all be the most
recent paralogs, as initially assumed. A number of gene
duplicates in the set of motif-free genes could result from
independent (and temporally distant) events of WGD,
but be considered as most recent copies if their true closely related copies have gone lost. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we find that motif-free ribosomal genes retain
significantly fewer paralogs and are lost more often relative to motif-containing genes. Also, K s estimates
between motif-free gene copies tend to be high (>0.25)
when only two duplicates are detected in the genome, a
condition that may more easily lead to classify incorrectly
the gene copies as recent duplicates. Finally, as the identification of the WGD paralogs involved also the study of
the synteny between blocks of duplicated genes [20], by
visual inspection we find that similar features can be
shared between motif-free ribosomal duplicates and their
flanking genes, i.e., flanking genes retain also only one
paralog and/or show comparable high levels of divergence at silent sites (data not shown). The latter observation implies that the hypothetical incorrect assignment of
recent paralogy could not only involve the motif-free
ribosomal genes but extend also to their flanking genes.
Finally, the observation that the GUACAUUA
sequence is typically located on the forward DNA
strand is consistent with the idea that this motif is
involved in post-transcriptional regulation–although the
alternative explanation that the motif is a DNA binding

Page 7 of 10

protein motif cannot be ruled out for now. Three observations hint at the possibility that the newly described
motif plays a role in modulating expression of the host
gene. First, motif-containing and motif-free genes are
differentially expressed, with motif-containing genes
being more highly expressed compared to motif-free
genes, a finding that along with the higher levels of
retention described for motif-containing genes is reminiscent of the reported positive correlation between
gene retention and gene expression in Paramecium
[32]. Second, the GUACAUUA sequence is reminiscent
of the PUF-binding site (UGUAnAUA), and PUF proteins–a family of mRNA-binding proteins–are known to
repress gene expression, either by inhibiting the translation or by enhancing the decay of target mRNAs
[33,34]. Third, the GUACAUUA sequence closely
resembles a conserved 3’ UTR motif in yeast,
UGUAUAUUA, that mediates the destabilization of the
host mRNA [8]. Intriguingly, this yeast motif is also
enriched in ribosomal genes, and has a mammalian
counterpart that is the target of a miRNA, miR-381 [8].
The implications of the latter observations are twofold:
1) the GUACAUUA motif was probably not gained
independently in mammals and Paramecium but
emerged in the common ancestor of the surveyed species and underwent either secondary loss or switches in
expressed genes; the GUACAUUA motif may too be a
binding site for a miRNA, which would be expected to
have co-evolved with the core motif. While an experimental validation is clearly needed to provide any solid
support for the latter hypothesis, the possibility of a
connection between the motif and miRNAs is twofold
intriguing: 1) the putatively regulated genes (i.e., ribosomal protein-coding genes) would not be lowly or only
moderately expressed genes, as genes that are commonly thought to be typical targets of miRNAs, and 2)
aside from small RNAs that are involved in the definition of the new macronucleus [35], and a class of short
RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional genesilencing [36], miRNAs have never been described in
ciliates.

Methods
Motif characterization

We investigated the presence of conserved signal
sequences in the 3’ untranslated regions of Paramecium,
by extracting 7647 annotated 3’ UTR sequences from
the P. tetraurelia genome database [37], and screening
these sequences for motifs that have been already catalogued for other species (a flow chart is provided in
Additional file 2). In particular, we used 540 8-mers that
were previously identified in mammalian 3’ UTRs [2], as
well as 442 and 497 k-mers that are highly conserved in
worms and flies respectively [6]. The procedure of gene,

Catania and Lynch BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:129
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/129

and thus of UTR, annotation in P. tetraurelia is
described in Aury et al. [20] and takes advantage of
cDNA libraries that include gene transcripts detected at
six different physiological conditions/developmental
stages. The average length calculated for the studied 3’
UTRs is 52.1 bp (CV = 0.68).
As conserved signals may be more likely to be shared
among genes coding for proteins that have similar functions, we characterized the molecular role of P. tetraurelia genes having an annotated 3’ UTR, by BLASTing the
corresponding protein sequences against the UNIPROT
database [38]. We used an E-value cut-off of 10-7 and
gap opening and gap extension penalties equal to 10
and 1 respectively. We assigned a given molecular function to each of the examined P. tetraurelia proteins,
according to the information drawn from the BLAST
first best hit.
We used the motif discovery MEME software [39] to
verify the exclusive presence and the most likely width
of the conserved motif we discovered in genes coding
for ribosomal proteins (see below) and Weblogo [40] to
produce a graphical view of the degree of conservation
at every site.
Interspecific conservation of the motif

We performed PCR and DNA sequencing to assess the
level of conservation of the detected P. tetraurelia ribosomal motif across multiple species of the P. aurelia
complex and a species closely related to the P. aurelia
species complex, P. caudatum. We designed PCR primers using the coding regions of two adjacent genes
(the upstream of which being a ribosomal protein gene)
and obtained PCR products spanning the intervening
ribosomal 3’ UTR. Due to difficulties in DNA amplification across the whole set of (or most) species surveyed,
the analysis across these relatively diverged species [14]
produced successful results only for a limited number of
3’ UTRs (n = 4) (data not shown). We calculated the
level of sequence divergence (d) along the entire 3’ UTR
using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method
implemented in the software MEGA 4.0 [41].
To further verify the degree of evolutionary conservation of the motif detected in P. tetraurelia, we next
surveyed the 3’ UTRs annotated for ribosomal protein
genes of four non-Paramecium species (Tetrahymena
thermophila, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster
and Arabidopsis thaliana). It is worth stressing that
the 8-mer we discovered in the P. tetraurelia 3’ UTRs,
as well as the remainder of conserved mammalian
motifs we used for our initial screening, had not been
explicitly associated with specific gene functions in
mammals. Using the same procedure described above
to infer the molecular function of P. tetraurelia genes,
we collected the following number of unique ribosomal

Page 8 of 10

genes (i.e. isoforms are not counted) for each of the
additional species surveyed: 142 (T. thermophila), 282
(H. sapiens), 176 (D. melanogaster), 521 (A. thaliana).
For each of the latter three sets we directly extracted
the annotated 3’ UTRs. In T. thermophila, where 3’
UTRs are not annotated, putative 3’ UTR sequences
were retrieved by cropping 500 bp of genomic DNA,
downstream of each ribosomal gene, and blasting the
cropped region against the whole set of T. thermophila
ESTs. The EST hit that extends most downstream of
each of the translation termination codons was used as
3’ UTR for this study.
Levels of sequence divergence between recently
duplicated ribosomal genes

To verify whether a correlation exists between the evolution of the motif sequence and that of the coding
sequence of the gene that contains it, we estimated the
level of sequence divergence between recently duplicated
P. tetraurelia macronuclear ribosomal protein-coding
genes (as derived from the most recent event of whole
genome duplication (WGD) in P. tetraurelia). Specifically, we grouped separately pairs where both genes
contain the discovered conserved motif and pairs where
at least one of the two genes was motif-free. We verified
the absence of the conserved motif in all the motif-free
genes that only contained a short (i.e. presumably
incomplete) annotated 3’ UTR. In one case we found
that the 9 bp annotated 3’ UTR of the gene model
GSPATP00010990001 contained the motif within the
following 10 bp and we included this gene in the set of
motif-containing genes.
For each of the ribosomal genes in P. tetraurelia, we
retrieved the most recent paralog according to the
‘ALL-against-ALL’ Blast analysis and the analysis of the
synteny between blocks of duplicated genes performed
by Aury et al. [20]. We aligned the duplicate sequences
with ClustalW [42], verified the existence of indels, suspicious introns, correct UTRs and gene predictions (see
below), and performed manual editing if needed. We
used the Kumar method implemented in the program
MEGA 4.0 to estimate the average K a , K s and K a /K s .
We used both the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test
to assess the significance of the observed differences.
We performed the t-test after square root transforming
the raw data and testing both for normality (K-S test)
and for equality of variances (Levene’s test). After data
transformation, a normal distribution could be obtained
consistently only for the Ks estimates.
We also estimated nucleotide diversities (corrected for
multiple substitutions [43]) for all pairs of paralogous
ribosomal 3’ UTRs, after the removal of the 8-mer
motif. When 3’ UTRs contained more than one motif
copy, we randomly removed one of the copies.

Inspection of the ribosomal genes’ coding sequences

To calculate estimates of levels of sequence divergence
we used alignments of putatively functional genes, i.e.,
we discarded pseudogenes, a condition that is not
uncommon for genes that code for ribosomal proteins.
The vast majority of alignments produced by ClustalW
were highly reliable–no manual editing was needed, and
the sequences always had virtually identical length. In
nine cases (one in the motif-free set and eight in the
motif-containing set), the presence of indels not verified
by ESTs or a high variability, both in the very 5’ end of
the gene sequences, complicated the local alignment. In
these cases, we only aligned the corresponding
sequences starting from the first ESTs verified site when
ESTs were available, or from the site where the alignment started to be unambiguous, when ESTs were not
available. We include these gene pairs in our analysis
and verified that their removal did not affect our
conclusions.
Further, we detected a limited number of non-framepreserving indels. Such mutations typically lead to incorrect introns, UTR or gene predictions and might reflect
a pseudogenization event. We verified and rejected the
occurrence of every indel (presumably deriving by
sequencing errors), by examining the corresponding
ESTs and re-estimated diversity after reintroducing the
erroneously eliminated coding regions. When ESTs were
not available, we excluded the gene pairs containing the
non-frame-preserving indel(s) from the analysis, as these
genes may represent pseudogenes.
Finally, in an additional attempt to detect pseudogenes
in our study, we examined intronless genes. The reason
for the latter analysis is that pseudogenes could arise after
an event of reverse transcription followed by reinsertion
into the genomic DNA (processed pseudogenes). We
found only one gene with no introns. This gene, for which
no ESTs are available, is a motif-containing ribosomal
gene and shows a relatively high Ka value (Ka = 0.10) and
a predicted premature translation termination codon. We
removed the corresponding gene pair from our analysis.
