Antimicrobial peptide-like genes in Nasonia
vitripennis: a genomic perspective
Caihuan Tian1, Bin Gao1, Qi Fang2, Gongyin Ye2, Shunyi Zhu1*

Abstract
Background: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an essential component of innate immunity which can rapidly
respond to diverse microbial pathogens. Insects, as a rich source of AMPs, attract great attention of scientists in
both understanding of the basic biology of the immune system and searching molecular templates for antiinfective drug design. Despite a large number of AMPs have been identified from different insect species, little
information in terms of these peptides is available from parasitic insects.
Results: By using integrated computational approaches to systemically mining the Hymenopteran parasitic wasp
Nasonia vitripennis genome, we establish the first AMP repertoire whose members exhibit extensive sequence and
structural diversity and can be distinguished into multiple molecular types, including insect and fungal defensin-like
peptides (DLPs) with the cysteine-stabilized a-helical and b-sheet (CSab) fold; Pro- or Gly-rich abaecins and
hymenoptaecins; horseshoe crab tachystatin-type AMPs with the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold; and a linear
a-helical peptide. Inducible expression pattern of seven N. vitripennis AMP genes were verified, and two
representative peptides were synthesized and functionally identified to be antibacterial. In comparison with Apis
mellifera (Hymenoptera) and several non-Hymenopteran model insects, N. vitripennis has evolved a complex
antimicrobial immune system with more genes and larger protein precursors. Three classical strategies that are
likely responsible for the complexity increase have been recognized: 1) Gene duplication; 2) Exon duplication; and
3) Exon-shuffling.
Conclusion: The present study established the N. vitripennis peptidome associated with antimicrobial immunity by
using a combined computational and experimental strategy. As the first AMP repertoire of a parasitic wasp, our
results offer a basic platform for further studying the immunological and evolutionary significances of these newly
discovered AMP-like genes in this class of insects.

Background
AMPs constitute essential components of innate immunity to rapidly respond to diverse microbial pathogens
[1,2]. As key effectors, AMPs directly kill invaders by
acting either as pore-formers or metabolic inhibitors [3].
Most AMPs are cationic polypeptides, usually smaller
than 100 amino acids in length, with enormous
sequence diversity. Based on structural characteristics,
these molecules are roughly divided into three different
groups [4]: 1) Linear peptides free of cysteines, often
forming an a-helical conformation with amphiphilic
surface, such as insect cecropins and mellitins,

Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China

amphibian magainins and arachnidian meucins [5,6];
2) Cysteine-rich peptides. The most representative of this
group are insect-derived defensins, which belong to the
CSab polypeptide superfamily and are conserved across
the kingdoms of eukaryotes [7,8], even in bacteria [9,10];
3) Peptides with unusual bias in certain amino acids,
such as glycine-rich tenecin3 [11], proline-rich apidaecin
[12], histidine-rich histatin [13] and tryptophan-rich
indolicidin [14]. AMPs in this group are unstructured
and often enter into bacterial cells to inhibit different
metabolic targets [3,15].
Insects, as a rich source of AMPs, attract great attention of scientists in both understanding the basic biology
of immune system and searching molecular templates
for anti-infective drug design. So far, about 200 such
peptides have been identified from insects. In Drosophila

melanogaster, there are 20 AMPs characterized [16]. In
the past ten years, a number of genome sequencing projects have promoted application of computational
approaches for the discovery of components involved in
innate immunity of a given species. Some examples
include D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, A. mellifera, Tribolium castaneum and Bombyx mori [17-21].
This will undoubtedly extend our knowledge in basic
biology of insect innate immunity system. Furthermore,
these data also provide new clues for elucidation of
immunological adaptation of insects to environmental
changes. For example, analysis of the complete immune
system of A. gambiae results in the discovery of a
marked deficit of orthologues due to gene loss and
excessive expansion of some specific genes, which is significantly different from that of D. melanogaster. This
possibly reflects differential selective pressures from different pathogens between these two species. These
results also facilitate further in-depth analysis of the
mosquito immune system’s impact on the malaria parasite [17,22].
Parasitoids (Hymenoptera, Insecta) are a group of
parasitic insects. Some of them attach significant vectors
of human disease, such as house flies, roaches and ticks,
and some of them are extremely important regulators of
agricultural pests [23]. To study molecular mechanism
of the innate immunity of parasitic wasps, the basic biology of their AMPs is needed to be established. As
the first parasitic hymenopteran insect to have its genome sequenced [24], N. vitripennis provides a new
resource for the identification of AMP genes in this
class of insects in a genomic scale [25,26]. Here, we
report systemic characterization of the AMP repertoire
from the N. vitripennis genome, which provide a perspective for the understanding of a possible relationship
between immunity and parasitism. In comparison with
A. mellifera and several non-Hymenopteran insects, N.
vitripennis has developed a more complex antimicrobial
immune system through genetic duplication and exonshuffling.

Results
Computational identification of AMPs in the
N. Vitripennis genome

To identify N. vitripennis AMP repertoire, we employed
three complementary approaches to database search of
the N. vitripennis genome (see additional file 1). Firstly,
we chose A. mellifera AMPs (e.g. mellitin, apidaecin,
apisimin, abaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensins) as queries
to recognize their orthologues in N. vitripennis by
BLASTP and TBLASTN. Secondly, we performed pattern search by the Scanprosite program based on the
cysteine arrangement pattern of CSab-type defensins
[8]. This strategy allowed identifying a large family of

Page 2 of 19

DLPs with a typical CXXXC and CXC motif and an
amino-terminal signal peptide, which can be divided
into three distinct subfamilies, including the known
navidefensins [25] and two new subfamilies named
nasonins and navitricins, respectively. Thirdly, we
screened putative secreted peptides of < 150 amino
acids from the N. vitripennis proteome by recognizing
an amino-terminal signal sequence, from which AMPlike peptides rich in specific amino acids were identified.
All AMPs found by the above approaches were again
used as query to carry out BLASTP and TBLASTN
iteratively until no new hits appeared. As a result, we
identified a total of 44 AMPs in the genome of N. vitripennis, as shown in additional file 2, in which only
nahymenoptaecin-1 and five defensins are recently
reported [25,26].
All these newly discovered peptides display remarkable
AMP characteristics, as reflected by their small size and
net positive charges at pH 7.0. Most peptides described
here are smaller than 150 amino acids in length, except
for nahymenoptaecin-1, nahymenoptaecin-2, nasonin-2
and nasonin-6, which all have undergone internal duplication (see additional file 2). N. vitripennis AMPs exhibit
extensive sequence and structural diversity and can be
distinguished into multiple molecular types including
insect and fungal DLPs with the CSab fold; Pro- or Glyrich abaecins and hymenoptaecins; horseshoe crab
tachystatin-type AMPs with the ICK fold; and a linear
a-helical peptide.
To confirm the reliability of our computational prediction, we undertook the N. vitripennis EST database
search and found more than 60% peptides have corresponding transcripts, suggesting the genes encoding
these peptides are expressed at the transcriptional level.
For remaining 40% peptides whose cDNA sequences
were not found in the EST database, one possibility is
that their expression depends upon suitable microbial
challenges [27] or is associated with different developmental stages of N. vitripennis, as observed in the
D. melanogaster antifungal drosomycin [28], although
pseudogene or wrong prediction resulted from computational methods cannot be completely excluded.
Classification of N. Vitripennis AMPs
Defensin-like peptides

Classical insect-type defensins (CITDs) Defensins with
the CSab structure are crucial effectors of innate immunity [7] which have been found in many insect species,
the majority of them coming from different orders of
the subclass Neoptera (Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidopera,
Hemiptera and Hymenoptera). These AMPs are primarily active against Gram-positive bacteria likely by forming voltage-dependent channels in bacterial membrane
leading to a loss of cytoplasmic potassium [29,30]. Their

Tian et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:187

protective roles have been well documented by in vivo
targeted disruption of defensin gene which resulted in
the death of A. gambiae after Gram-positive bacterial
infection [31]. Insect defensins consist of 30-50 amino
acids linked by three or four disulfide bridges. They
share a common CSab structural motif with some functionally related scorpion neurotoxins targeting various
ion channels, protease inhibitors, and even a plant sweet
taste peptide [8,32].
In A. mellifera, there are only two defensins named
defensin1 and defensin2 [33]. Amdefensin2 is a CITD
with similar sequence, gene organization and molecular
size to those from other insects. However, amdefensin1,
also known as royalisin, has a lineage-specific carboxylterminal extension. Defensins with clear orthologous
relationship with these two defensins have been identified
in the N. vitripennis genome based on sequence similarity
and identical precursor organization (signal peptide, propeptide and mature peptide) by our group [25]. These two
defensins have undergone gene duplication to form a multigene family containing five members (navidefensin1-1,
1-2, 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3). A detailed analysis of their exonintron organization allowed identifying N. vitripennisspecific intron loss and gain (Figure 1). For example, navidefensin1-1 has a phase 2 intron at the residue lysine
following the CXC motif, which is conserved with amdefensin1, while navidefensin1-2 lacks this intron. 3’-intron
loss or gain has been frequently observed in a large number of genes by a possible reverse transcription-mediated
mechanism [34]. Whether dynamic evolution of introns is
associated with the carboxyl-terminal extension in defensin1 remains an open question [35].
Three-dimensional (3D) models of navidefensin1-1
and navidefensin2-1 were constructed by comparative
modeling with sapecin’s structure (PDB: 1L4V) [36] as a
template, which confirmed their typical CSab folding, as
identified by an a-helix and a two-stranded b-sheet.
Residues spanning S15-S23 in navidefensin1-1 and S18A26 in navidefensin2-1 form an a-helix with separate
hydrophobic (A 16 , A 17 and L 22 in navidefensin1-1 or
A 19 , A 21 , V 22 , L 25 , and A 26 in navidefensin2-1) and
hydrophilic (S15, N20, and S23 in navidefensin1-1 or S18
and R 23 in navidefensin2-1) surfaces. Two b-stands
(residues G28 to C31 and C36 to R39 in navidefensin1-1
or G31 to C34 and C39 to R42 in navidefensin2-1) constitute an antiparallel sheet with a g-core region which has
been considered as a functional determinant responsible
for antimicrobial activity of some defensins [37].
Because of no suitable templates to build a model of the
extended carboxyl-terminus of navidefensin1-1, alternatively an ab initio prediction method was employed. In
both methods, a conserved CSab core was successfully
predicted (Verify3D values > 0.2). For navidefensin1-1,
the ab initio method predicted an a-helix in its

Page 3 of 19

carboxyl-terminus (residues K44 to R50) (Figure 2B). The
existence of an extra glycine in the carboxyl-terminus of
navidefensin1-1 suggests that Phe51 is likely amidated to
provide a force for the helical stability, as predicted in
bee defensin1 [33,38].
(2) Nasonins In addition to the defensins mentioned
above, we identified a new DLP subfamily without a
propeptide, which contains fourteen members (named
nasonin-1 to -14) (Figure 1). Sequence analysis revealed
that nasonins are more closely related to two known
non-classical defensins than CITDs in precursor organization, n-loop size and sequence similarity, one being
antifungal termicin isolated from termites [39,40];
another being defensin1 from the Mexican scorpion
Centruroides limpidus limpidus [41]. Intriguingly, such
similarity was also observed between nasonins and a
scorpion K+ channel toxin cobatoxin [42,43] (Figure 1).
These observations suggest that nasonins could have
diverse functional features. For nasonin-2 and nasonin-6,
their defensin unit has undergone 4 to 5 internal repeats,
as described in fungal DLPs [32]. What’s the potential
function of such repeats and how these repeats occur will
be further discussed below.
We also predicted the structure of nasonin-1 by comparative modeling using scorpion neurotoxin cobatoxin
(PDB: 1PJV) [43] as a template. Although having a
shorter n-loop than CITDs, nasonins can also adopt a
typical CSab architecture (Figure 2B). The reliability of
this model was evaluated by Verify3D with a score of
0.248. Overall, nasonin-1 more resembles structurally
termicin (PDB: 1MM0) [44] and cobatoxin (Figure 2B),
but they differ in molecular surface charge distribution
(data not shown), which could explain functional diversity of these peptides, as observed between human betadefensin2 and the snake toxin crotamine [45].
Navidefensin3 is a unique non-classical defensin
because it has identical precursor organization and gene
structure to navidefensin1 and 2 but similar n-loop size
and amino acid sequence to nasonins. In fact, several
non-classical insect defensins with a short n-loop were
also found in Lepidoptera insects (e.g. gallerimycin, spodoptericin and the B. mori defensins) [46-48]. In the
tree presented in Figure 2A, navidefensin3 is clustered
together with nasonins rather than navidefensins, suggesting that this DLP is an evolutionary link between
these two multigene subfamilies of defensins. Its lack in
A. mellifera is consistent with the absence of the nasonin subfamily in this species.
(3) Navitricins We also found two unique DLPs (named
navitricin-1 and -2) in the N. vitripennis genome, which
possess 8 cysteines with an identical alignment pattern
to the family III members of fungal DLPs [32]. Analysis
of genomic sequences identified a phase 1 intron in the
mature peptide-coding region of navitricins (Figure 3A).

As mentioned previously, navitricins have two additional cysteines which could form a fourth disulfide
bridge. To confirm this, comparative modeling was again
used to build the structure of navitricin-1 by choosing
different templates, e.g. CITDs (sapecin and phormicin),
the scorpion toxin BmTX1, and the plant sweet taste
protein brazzein. In all these cases no acceptable models
were generated and we thus tried to use the I-TASSER
algorithm for structure simulation which produced a suitable model, as evaluated by Verify 3D (Figure 3B). Overall, this molecule is similar to the defensins described
above including three identical disulfide bridges. Importantly, this model correctly predicts the fourth disulfide
bridge linking the n- and c-loops together which makes
the whole structure more compact. In fact, computational prediction was also applied to reveal an additional
disulfide bridge in several insulin-like proteins [49].
(4) Biological activity Previous studies have highlighted
a crucial role of a-helical and g-core regions of insect

defensins in inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, whereas their n-loops could mediate antibacterial
specificity [37,50,51]. Interestingly, all nasonins identified
here have a shorter n-loop relative to CITDs. To confirm
whether these novel DLPs have different antibacterial
spectrum from CITDs, we chose nasonin-1 as a representative. Reduced nasonin-1 was chemically synthesized
and its in vitro refolded was performed by using reduced
and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) under an alkaline
condition (pH = 8.0). Refolded peptide was further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (Figure 4A). In comparison with the
reduced form, refolded nasonin-1 has a slightly earlier
retention time (18 min vs. 19 min). The molecular weight
(MW) of refolded nasonin-1 detected by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrum
(MALDI-TOF MS) is 3553.48 Da, about 7 Da smaller
than the reduced form (3560.8 Da), in favor of the formation of three disulfide bridges (Figure 4B).

Structural models of DLPs from N.vitripennis. Navidefensin1-1 and navidefensin2-1 modeled ab initio by I-TASSER are shown in ribbon displayed
by MolMol. Superimposition of these two structures shows an extra carboxyl-terminal domain in navidefensin1-1 structure. The model structure
of nasonin-1 is compared with those of sapecin, termicin and cobatoxin.

Subsequently, we evaluated antibacterial and antifungal activities of nasonin-1 using classical inhibition zone
assays [52] and found that nasonin-1 only displayed
activity against two Gram-negative bacteria at micromolar concentrations with a lethal concentrations (CL) of
1.52 μM for Stenotrophomonus sp. LZ-1 and of 15.4 μM
for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (Figure 4C). No effect
was observed on Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. This
is the first example describing a DLP mainly active on
Gram-negative bacteria. Recombinant navidefensin2-2
was recently reported to be active on Gram-positive
bacteria [25]. Whether such remarkable difference in
target selectivity is associated with the change of n-loop
length in these two Nasonia defensins needs further
investigation.
AMPs rich in specific amino acids

AMPs rich in specific amino acids (e.g. glycine, proline,
histidine, tryptophan or arginine) represent an additional
class of AMPs acting on diverse microorganisms (e.g.
bacteria, fungi, and virus) [53,54]. The majority of these
molecules are unstructured and they often inhibit
microbial growth by entering into cells and interacting
with proteins involved in key metabolic processes [15].

Eighteen such AMPs have been identified here, including two known AMP families (abaecin and hymenoptaecin) [55,56].
(1) Abaecin Abaecin is an inducible Pro-rich antibacterial peptide, firstly identified from the hemolymph of
A. mellifera after bacterial challenge, and known to be
regulated by the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway
[55,57]. They can act on both Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria with a moderate inhibitory concentration when compared to apidaecin which was also from
A. mellifera [55]. Subsequently, several abaecin-like
genes were identified from the bee A. cerana and Bombus ignites, and the wasp Pteromalus puparum [58,59].
Searching for the N. vitripennis genome identified three
genes encoding protein precursors with clear sequence
similarity to abaecins in their amino-terminal part of
mature peptides. We named these abaecin-like genes
nabaecin-1 to -3. Analysis of these precursor sequences
allowed recognizing a dibasic cleavage site (RR) for
putative post-translational processing by which an
amino-terminal part (called N-terminal abaecin unit,
NtAU) corresponding to the bee abaecin will be released
(Figure 5). The NtAU of nabaecin-3 shares the highest

sequence identity (50%) with A. mellifera abaecin. To
understand how nabaecins extended their carboxyl-termini, we further searched the N. vitripennis database
and found that a peptide (named navitripenicin) possesses highly identical amino acid sequence to the carboxyl-termini of nabaecins (herein named C-terminal
navitripenicin unit, CtNU), but the region corresponding
to abaecin is replaced by an acidic propeptide with a
dibasic cleavage site. High content of glycines together
with positively charged characteristics suggest that
CtNU and navitripenicin belong to putative AMPs.
A conserved phase 0 intron located at a nearly identical
position among all these peptides (Figure 5) supports
their evolutionary relatedness.
(2) Hymenoptaecin Hymenoptaecin is an antibacterial
peptide rich in glycine, which was identified only in
Hymenopteran insects [56,59,60]. The mature hymenoptaecin is released by cleaving off a signal peptide and an

acidic propeptide after bacterial infection. Expression of
the hymenoptaecin gene was also regulated by the IMD
pathway [57]. It inhibits the viability of Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria, including several human
pathogens [56]. Similarity search of the N. vitripennis
genome identified two hymenoptaecin-like peptides
(named nahymenoptaecin-1 and nahymenoptaecin-2)
with a unique amino-terminal AMP-like region corresponding to the propeptide of bee hymenoptaecins in
position (Figure 6A). Functional characterization and
evolutionary significance of nahymenoptaecin-1 has
been described recently [26].
Nahymenoptaecin-2 presents a more interesting structural feature in the mature peptide region, whose
amino- and carboxyl-termini are respectively a Pro-rich
peptide (named pronavicin) and a hymenoptaecin-like
peptide with four internal repeats. Overall, these repeats
can be well aligned with hymenoptaecin except a

deletion of 31 amino acids in each repeat. Similarly, a
conserved phase 0 intron is also present in the aminotermini of bee and parasitoid hymenoptaecins, suggesting that these peptides diverged from a common ancestor after speciation.
Although hymenoptaecins are believed to be only present in Hymenoptera, our study reveals that similar
peptides were also evolved by Dipteran Drosophila
(Figure 6A). These fly-derived peptides display a chimeric characteristic because they have an acidic propeptides, as bee hymenoptaecins, but their mature peptides
more resemble the repeat of nahymenoptaecin-2 in size.
Moreover, Drosophila hymenoptaecins have lost their
introns, consistent with the lineage-specific intron loss
in these species [61]. All Drosophila hymenoptaecins
clustering together in the tree (Figure 6B) indicates their
monophyletic origin after separation of Diptera from
Hymenoptera.
As a unique region of nahymenoptaecin-2, the aminoterminal pronavicin shares detectable sequence identity
(25-41.2%) to other known Pro-rich AMPs from insects
such as drosocin [62], apidaecin [12] and formaecin [63]
(Figure 6C). Thus we synthesized this peptide to verify
its antibacterial activity. Results showed that pronavicin
was able to inhibit the growth of all Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria used here with differential
potency. It displayed the strongest inhibitory effect on
the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium

(CL = 3.11 μM) (Table 1). At high micromolar concentrations this peptide did not affect fungi and yeasts.
Tachystatin-type AMPs

ICK fold is an evolutionarily conserved structural motif
shared by a large group of polypeptides with diverse
sequences and bioactivities. For example, venomous animals (e.g. spider and scorpion) usually employed this
fold to develop their neurotoxins affecting channels’
functions [64,65] while horseshoe crabs, insects and
some plants use ICK peptides as a part of their antibacterial defense system [66-69]. Peptides belonging to this
fold type exhibit antibacterial (plant ICK peptides), antifungal (tachystatin and Alo-3), and chitin-binding
(tachystatin-A) activities. Three peptides (named
naickin-1, -2 and -3) with the ICK structure were characterized for the first time from the N. vitripennis genome that all share sequence similarity to an ICK peptide
from A. mellifera (named amickin-1). All four peptides
have a typical ICK cysteine arrangement pattern with a
unique extended carboxyl-terminus rich in proline and
positively charged residues. A phase 0 intron preceding
the second cysteine is conserved between naickins and
amickin-1 (Figure 7A), suggesting their homologous

Linear a-helical peptides

Linear peptides with an a-helical conformation are a
large class of AMPs involved in immune response of
arthropods, amphibians and vertebrates. Since cecropin,
the first insect-derived linear AMP, was isolated from
Cecropia moth [71], the number of such peptides dramatically increases in recent decades [72,73]. Several linear a-helical AMPs have also been characterized in
social wasps [74-76]. From the N. vitripennis genome,
we identified one AMP-like peptide (called nahelixin)
belonging to this class (Figure 7C). The precursor of

nahelixin is 118 residues in length with an amino-terminal signal peptide and a putative carboxyl-terminal propeptide. The predicted mature peptide of 22 amino
acids shares about 40% sequence identity with four
known antibacterial peptides from frogs [77]. Secondary
structure prediction indicated it could adopt an a-helical structure (data not shown), which was further confirmed by ab initio structural prediction. An amphiphilic
surface, with hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues
separately arranged at two directions of the helical axis,
is present in the model, as seen at the helical wheel projection (Figure 7C). Such structural feature represents a
prerequisite for antibacterial activity of linear AMPs [6].

Inducible expression profiles of N. Vitripennis
AMP-like genes

The up-regulation of AMP expression after infection is a
common defense strategy by hosts to rapidly destroy
invaders [5]. To evaluate whether N. vitripennis AMPs
have such expression feature, we chose twelve genes
that belong to 4 different categories (i.e. nabaecins,
nahymenoptaecins, navidefensins, and nasonins) as
representatives. By using RT-PCR and DNA sequencing,
we found that six genes are constitutively expressed
because their cDNAs can be amplified from both
infected and non-infected N. vitripennis adults. These
genes are respectively nasonin-1, nasonin-3, nasonin-4,

nabaecin-2, together with navidefensin1-1 and 1-2, two
recently cloned genes from the non-infected N. vitripennis adults [25]. Subsequently, we studied the expression
profiles of all twelve genes after bacterial challenge by
semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that only
two genes (nasonin-3 and nasonin-4) whose expression
was not induced by the bacteria. Four genes (navidefensin1-1, 1-2, nasonin-1 and nabaecin-2) weakly expressed
in the non-infected wasp were significantly up-regulated
by bacterial challenge. Transcripts of nabaecin-1, nahymenoptaecin-1 and nahymenoptaecin-2 were only
detected in the infected wasp, indicating that their
expression is initiated by infection (Figure 8). Differential expression patterns among different AMPs may
represent a combinational strategy to form a defense
network against diverse microbial pathogens. Although
three navidefensin2 genes were not detected to be
expressed in the non-infected and infected adults, their
defense role in different developmental stages of Nasonia is possible [25].

genomics approaches is becoming quite valuable. Some
examples include hormones from nematode and mosquito, odorant binding-like proteins from honey bee,
opossum immune genome, and reptile venom genes
[78-82]. However, most strategies used are primarily
based on sequence similarity that is useful in finding
orthologues of known genes. An additional computational search strategy depends on the presence of conserved structural motifs within a peptide superfamily.
Such examples include the identification of fungal DLPs
and mammalian b-defensins [32,83]. Here, we identified
the N. vitripennis AMPs in a genomic scale by using an
integrated strategy which combines similarity search,
pattern recognition and AMP characteristics (see additional file 1).
Our previous and current studies indicate that at least
44 AMPs are present in N. vitripennis. In comparison
with A. mellifera AMPs [18,25,26], we found an obvious
complexity increase of immune peptides in the
parasitic wasp, both in number and protein precursor
size (Figure 9). For example, N. vitripennis has three

abaecins, six defensins and fourteen nasonins whereas
A. mellifera has only 1 abaecin, 2 defensins and lacks
nasonins. Besides changes in number, N. vitripennis also
undergoes wide sequence extension. For instance, members in the nabaecin family from N. vitripennis have an
extended carboxyl-terminus of about 65 residues relative
to A. mellifera while nahymenoptaecins underwent duplication in their amino- or carboxyl-terminus (Figures 5
and 6, also see [26]) which largely enlarges their molecular size. In addition, the same type AMPs (e.g. defensins)
also considerably change in several aspects: 1) The length
variation in the n-loop (i.e. nasonins); 2) The development of a wrapper disulfide bridge [84] (i.e. navitricins);
3) Carboxyl-terminal extension (i.e. navidefensin1s)
(Figure 10); and 4) For nasonin-2 and -6, the nasonin-like
domain (NLD) repeats 4-5 times and thus represents
another type of complexity increase (Figure 11).
In comparison with several non-Hymenopteran insects
whose genome sequences have been released (e.g.
D. melanogaster and A. gambiae from Diptera, B. mori
from Lepidoptera, and T. castaneum from Coleoptera)

infection. M: DNA marker. -: non-challenged; +: challenged.

[17-21], N. vitripennis still have evolved more AMP
genes both in kinds and numbers (Figure 9A). Based on
the phylogenetic relationship of holometabolous insects
[85], we elucidate several evolutionary events (e.g. gene
expansion, terminal extension and tandem repeat) which
might have occurred along the parasitoid branch
(Figure 9B) to result in the lineage-specific complexity
increase in N. vitripennis AMPs for synergetic defense
in parasitic condition [86].
Evolution of the N. Vitripennis AMPs

Three different strategies have been recognized to shape
the complex antimicrobial immune system in
N. vitripennis:
Gene duplication

Adjacent chromosome location together with gene
structure conservation strongly supports tandem gene
duplication occurring in at least three AMPs in the
N. vitripennis genome, including navidefensins, nabaecins and nasonins (Figure 10A). An emerging trend in
the study of AMPs is that their evolution is often driven
by Darwin positive selection following gene duplication

[87]. However, we only detected weak positive selection
signal in the amino-terminal abaecin unit (Table 2). No
such signal was found in the gene families of defensins
and nasonins, which is likely due to the sparse samplings of species used in this analysis because when
more defensin sequences are included, accelerated
amino acid substitutions were detected in the Nasonia
lineage [25]. An additional change after gene duplication
is structural diversification of N. vitripennis AMPs
(Figure 10B). These structural variations may result in
evolutionary novelty by changing structural basis related
to function. For example, n-loop has been proven to be
functionally important in mosquito defensin [50] and its
change in size will probably influence the activity and
antibacterial spectra of these defensins, as observed in
navidefensin2-2 [25] and nasonin-1. There is also
increasing awareness that alteration of the highly
exposed wrapper disulfide bridge linkage pattern can
lead to functional switch of scorpion sodium channel
toxins via adjusting the conformation of key residues
associated with toxin function [84]. In this regard, navitricins with such a disulfide bridge are examples for

further research. Finally, a typical amphipathic surface is
present in the carboxyl-terminal a-helical region of the
navidefensin1 subfamily members, suggesting a new
antimicrobial unit has evolved on the classical defensin
scaffold.
Exon duplication

In N. vitripennis, we identified two unusual defensin-like
genes (i.e. nasonin-2 and nasonin-6) that encode proteins
carrying 4-5 repeats of NLD without protease processing
signals (Figure 11). Although we do not know how these
genes originated, the gene structure of nasonin-6 gives
a glimpse into its history. As shown in Figure 11, each
NLD is encoded by a single exon, which is evidence
for exon duplication [88]. From an evolutionary perspective, exon duplication mediated internal repeats
could be viewed in the same light as gene duplication,
which is usually considered to be the principal path
for complexity increase of a protein. For example, the
leucin-rich repeats (LRRs) in ribonuclease inhibitor
(RI) are displayed in 1-30 tandem copies within a protein and such high LRR unit number could be critical
for the evolution of both broad specificity and high
affinity by RI [89]. The presence of multiple defensin
repeats in nasonin-2 and -6 could have some structural
significance if we consider the functional importance of

forming oligomerization for membrane permeabilization of b-defensins [90]. Alternatively, new functional
features were also evolved in some repeats, such as
protease inhibitory activity [91] which may be useful in
preventing from degradation of the whole molecule.
The last domain of nasonin-2 has high sequence identity (86%) and a conserved phase 1 intron after signal
peptide to nasonin-1, suggesting it originated from one
ancestral copy of nasonin-1 by exon duplication and
subsequent intron loss (Figure 1).
Exon-shuffling

Exon-shuffling represents a major mechanism by which
a limited set of modules can be shuffled by intronic
recombination. Such mechanism has significantly contributed to the emergence of novel complex multidomain proteins, novel functions and increased organismic
complexity. Gene structure conservation in multidomain
immune molecules suggests that exon shuffling may be
involved in the evolution of the immune system [92].
However, in most case tracing such event is rather difficult due to accelerated sequence changes. Nabaecins,
chimeric genes of abaecin and navitripenicin as mentioned previously (Figure 5), provides some clues to see
a history of immune-related genes, in which exon-shuffling is likely involved. At the sequence level, the NtAU

of nabaecin-3 is highly similar to A. mellifera abaecin
(41.2% (protein) or 45.1% (DNA)), while its CtNU shares
41.4% (protein) and 56.2% (DNA) identity to navitripenicin. And the sequence identity extends to their 3’ UTRs
(Figure 12A). At the genomic level, all these three genes
retain a conserved phase 0 intron at identical positions
(Figure 5), indicating that they are evolutionarily related.
In all these genes, CtNU and navitripenicin are encoded
by a single exon. Therefore, we assume that after the
wasp diverged from the bee lineage, an exon-shuffling,
mediated by the conserved phase 0 intron, occurred
between the ancestral ortholog of the A. mellifera abaecin and a duplicated navitripenicin gene, which resulted
in the emergence of the first nabaecin gene. In subsequent evolution, a multigene family of three members
formed by gene duplication (Figure 12B).

basic evolutionary scenarios are recognized in the generation of a complex antimicrobial system in N. vitripennis. Our work presented here will offer a basic platform
for further studying the immunological and evolutionary
significances of these newly discovered AMPs in parasitic insects. Whether these AMP-like genes with a complicate structure or much more copies are involved in
parasitism remains an open question which constitutes
our next research direction. In particular, our efficient
approaches for finding new AMPs in a genomic scale
can easily be applied to other model organisms including humans, which will accelerate our understandings
on AMP-mediated innate immunity at a defense network level. Further functional characterization of these
parasitic wasp-derived AMPs will also help explore newtype of drug leads for anti-infective therapy.

Conclusions
By using a combined computational and experimental
strategy, we established for the first time the N. vitripennis peptidome associated with innate immunity. Three

BLASTP and TBLASTN programs were used to characterize orthologues of known AMPs from A. mellifera

Maximum likelihood analysis

Codon-substitution models were selected to estimate the
nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio (ω = dN/dS)
using the CODEML program of the PAML software
package [113]. Four models recommended by Yang
make two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) by M1a/M2a and
M7/M8: M1a (nearly neutral model) constraints a proportion p 0 of conserved sites with 0 < ω < 1, while a
proportion p1 = 1-p0 of neutral sites with ω1 = 1; M2a
(positive selection model) adds an extra class of sites
with the proportion p2 = 1-p0 -p1 and with ω estimated
from the data. M7 (b distribution model) does not allow

for positively selected sites and M8(b and ω model)
adds an extra class of sites to M7, allowing for ω > 1,
which means the presence of positively selected sites. In
addition, Model 0 (M0) assuming one ω for all sites that
does not allow the existence of positive selection was
chosen for negative control [114,115]. Upon detection of
the positively selected signals, the calculation of posterior probabilities was completed using the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) method [115,116].
Chemical synthesis and oxidative refolding

Pronavicin and reduced nasonin-1 were chemically
synthesized by Xi’an Huachen Bio-Technology Co., Ltd.
(Xi’an, China). The cyclization reaction to form disulfide
bridges in the reduced nasonin-1 molecule was carried

out in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0) with 2 mM GSH and
0.2 mM GSSG. Refolded peptide was purified to be
homogeneity by C18-RP-HPLC. Its MW was determined
by MALDI-TOF MS on a Kratos PC Axima CFR plus
(Shimazu Co. LTD, Kyoto).
Antimicrobial assays

Inhibition zone assays were carried out to evaluate antimicrobial activities of peptides [28,52,117]. Briefly, 50 μl
bacteria or fungal spores with OD600 = 0.5 were inoculated to pre-heated 6 ml Luria-Bertaini’s medium (1%
bactotryptone, 0.5% bactoyeast extract and 0.5% NaCl)
for bacteria or MEA medium (1% Malt Extract, 0.1%
Peptone, 2% Glucose) for fungi containing 0.8% agar.
The mixture was then spread on a 9-cm Petri dish, giving a depth of 1 mm. After settling, 2-mm wells were
punched in the plate and then 2 μl of peptide under different concentrations was added to each well. Diameters
of the inhibition zones were measured 16 hours after
incubation at 30°C. CL was calculated by the Hultmark’s
method [52]. The microorganisms used in this assay
were listed in additional file 3.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR

For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, an AMP-like gene were
amplified from non-infected or infected cDNAs by using
a gene-specific primer and 3AP and PCR products
obtained from different cycles (i.e. 25, 30, 35, 40, 45)
were taken for comparison of the amounts of these products by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. N. vitripennis ribosome protein RP49 was chosen as an internal
control which was amplified by using primers NvRp49F2/3AP and the same cDNA templates.

Establishment of the infection model

N. vitripennis was maintained as a laboratory culture on
pupae of the housefly Musca domestica. They were reared
under a 14:10 light-dark cycle at 25°C in glass containers
fed on 20% (v/v) honey solution. A standard method was
applied to establish an infection model [118] of N. vitripennis. Briefly, a bacterial mixture of E. coli ATCC 25922
and M. luteus which had been separately incubated overnight was injected into abdomen of N. vitripennis adults
with a micro-injector. About 50 wasps were challenged in
total. Non-injected wasps were used as a control.
Preparation of total RNA

For isolating N. vitripennis total RNA, 50 wasps challenged for 16 hours by bacteria were grounded into fine
powder in liquid nitrogen. The Trizol reagent (SBS Genetech, Beijing) was used to prepare total RNA according
to the supplier’s instructions. This method was also
applied to prepare non-challenged total RNA [25].
cDNA Cloning

Reverse transcription of total RNAs prepared from noninfected or infected N. vitripennis was performed using
RT PreMix kit (TransGen, Beijing) and a universal oligo
(dT) - containing adaptor primer dT3AP. The firststrand cDNA amplification in both non-infected and
infected wasps was performed by using an AMP-like
gene-specific primer and the universal primer 3AP
according to the method described [119]. PCR product
was cloned into pGEM-T (TIANGEN, Beijing), and
transformed into E. coli DH5a competent cells
