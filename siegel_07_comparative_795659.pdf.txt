Abstract
Background: The evolutionary lineage leading to the teleost fish underwent a whole genome
duplication termed FSGD or 3R in addition to two prior genome duplications that took place
earlier during vertebrate evolution (termed 1R and 2R). Resulting from the FSGD, additional copies
of genes are present in fish, compared to tetrapods whose lineage did not experience the 3R
genome duplication. Interestingly, we find that ParaHox genes do not differ in number in extant
teleost fishes despite their additional genome duplication from the genomic situation in mammals,
but they are distributed over twice as many paralogous regions in fish genomes.
Results: We determined the DNA sequence of the entire ParaHox C1 paralogon in the East
African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, and compared it to orthologous regions in other vertebrate
genomes as well as to the paralogous vertebrate ParaHox D paralogons. Evolutionary relationships
among genes from these four chromosomal regions were studied with several phylogenetic
algorithms. We provide evidence that the genes of the ParaHox C paralogous cluster are
duplicated in teleosts, just as it had been shown previously for the D paralogon genes. Overall,
however, synteny and cluster integrity seems to be less conserved in ParaHox gene clusters than
in Hox gene clusters. Comparative analyses of non-coding sequences uncovered conserved,
possibly co-regulatory elements, which are likely to contain promoter motives of the genes
belonging to the ParaHox paralogons.
Conclusion: There seems to be strong stabilizing selection for gene order as well as gene
orientation in the ParaHox C paralogon, since with a few exceptions, only the lengths of the introns
and intergenic regions differ between the distantly related species examined. The high degree of
evolutionary conservation of this gene cluster's architecture in particular – but possibly clusters of
genes more generally – might be linked to the presence of promoter, enhancer or inhibitor motifs
that serve to regulate more than just one gene. Therefore, deletions, inversions or relocations of
individual genes could destroy the regulation of the clustered genes in this region. The existence

of such a regulation network might explain the evolutionary conservation of gene order and
orientation over the course of hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution. Another
possible explanation for the highly conserved gene order might be the existence of a regulator not
located immediately next to its corresponding gene but further away since a relocation or inversion
would possibly interrupt this interaction. Different ParaHox clusters were found to have
experienced differential gene loss in teleosts. Yet the complete set of these homeobox genes was
maintained, albeit distributed over almost twice the number of chromosomes. Selection due to
dosage effects and/or stoichiometric disturbance might act more strongly to maintain a modal
number of homeobox genes (and possibly transcription factors more generally) per genome, yet
permit the accumulation of other (non regulatory) genes associated with these homeobox gene
clusters.

Background
The cichlid fish
Cichlids belong to the most diverse and species-rich families of fishes. With an estimated number of more than
3,000 species they alone represent more than ten percent
of all fish species. The family Cichlidae belongs to the teleosts that, with more than 26,500 species, are the most
diverse lineage of all vertebrates [1]. Cichlids have a
Gondwanian distribution and are found in India, Madagascar, South and Central America and Africa and developed a stunning variety of coloration patterns, body
shapes, behaviors and trophic as well as ecological specializations within a few millions of years see [2-8]. Their
unparalleled diversity made the cichlid species flocks a
textbook example for parallel adaptive radiations and
explosive speciation [7].

The evolutionary success of the cichlids has been attributed to morphological and behavioral patterns, although
the relative importance of different mechanisms – as there
will be surely more than one – is still debated. One plausible factor that is at least partly responsible for the cichlids' unique diversity is the complexity of their breeding
system and social behavior. Cichlids evolved a variety of
brood care strategies and mating systems, and it is likely
that female choice with respect to male coloration played
an important role during cichlid evolution [2,5,9-11].
Another possible reason for their evolutionary success is
the particular architecture of the cichlids' jaw apparatus.
They possess two sets of jaws, one oral and one pharyngeal jaw derived from the fifth gill arch. These jaws
evolved independently from each other and allow for an
immense variety of possible feeding types leading to different diets. Therefore, many different niches could be colonized by cichlids [12]. There is a large amount of
behavioral and morphological divergence between different cichlid species in the East African lakes. Yet, rather surprising parallelisms have evolved in species flocks of the
different lakes [3,5,8] indicating that the genetic "predisposition" for the modification of these traits might have
been already present in the genome of the common ances-

tor of all the East African cichlid species. We assume that
a substantial part of the necessary modifications of the
cichlids' genome takes place in the regulatory elements of
only a few important genes. To test this hypothesis it
would be important to identify those genes of relevance in
speciation. As part of this overall research effort we focus
here on the ParaHox genes, a sister-cluster of the Hox
genes that are crucial in development [13,14]. Here, we
report on an investigation of the genomics of the ParaHox
C and D paralogons of the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni and
present the results of a comparison of some of its genomic
features with those of other vertebrate ParaHox clusters.
Genome duplication, Hox- and ParaHox clusters in
vertebrates
It has been suggested that gene- or genome duplications
might be important evolutionary mechanisms resulting in
new copies of genes, which are then free to accumulate
mutations and to evolve new or additional functions [15].
Changes in regulatory elements of duplicated gene copies
could, for example, cause neofunctionalization; the gain
of a new function, or a subfunctionalization; i.e., subdividing the original functions of the duplicated gene
between the daughter genes [16]. Genes under relaxed
selection can arise after the duplication of single genes,
large chromosomal fragments or even whole genomes
[[17] and references therein]. For each of these three possibilities, different effects are characteristic: the preservation or disruption of regulatory control, the genomic
context, the potential for dosage imbalance and, of
course, the size of the duplicated fragment [18].

Duplications of genes as a consequence of the activity of
transposable elements, unequal crossing-over and other
mechanisms occur frequently in the course of vertebrate
evolution [19]. The duplication of whole genomes, however is a rare event in animals, although there are quite a
few polyploid species in some taxonomic groups such as
frogs [20], salamanders [21] and several fish lineages such
as salmonids [22], cyprinids and catfish [23]). In plants
polyploidy is a rather common phenomenon [24-26].

Several studies have proposed the existence of two rounds
of whole genome duplications during vertebrate evolution (2R hypothesis) [[14,27] and references therein].
More recent analyses revealed that in the lineage leading
to the ray-finned fish, an additional genome duplication
event, the fish-specific genome duplication (3R or FSGD),
has occurred [28-33]. The 1R and 2R can be roughly dated
430 – 750 mya [27,34] in the lineage of the Gnathostomata. However, the phylogenetic relationships of the
agnathan lineages to one other and to the vertebrates as
well the timing of 1R and 2R is not fully resolved yet [35].
The FSGD [36,37] took place in the lineage of ray-finned
fish, after the separation of gars but before the origin of
the Osteoglossomorpha [30], around 320 mya [27,38].
Among the first to be discovered and still among the most
prominent examples for duplicated genes through whole
genome duplications are the Hox clusters [14]. The
number of Hox gene clusters and their genomic architecture in vertebrate genomes are an excellent illustration for
the vertebrate genomic history of two rounds of genome
duplications (1R, 2R), as well as an additional fish specific
genome duplication (3R/FSGD) [39]. One cluster is
found in the genome of the Cephalochordate Branchiostoma and one cluster is assumed to be the ancestral state
[40]. Two rounds of genome duplication led to four copies in sharks and tetrapods and another round of genome
duplication along with reciprocal losses of genes lead to a
total number seven Hox clusters in teleost fish [33,39].
Therefore it might be expected that the genes of the ParaHox clusters, just as those of the Hox clusters, should
reflect the history of the last two genome duplications in
fish as well [41].
The ParaHox complex in mammals consists, just as the
Hox complex, out of four clusters termed A to D. But only
the A cluster still carries all three genes of the predicted
ancestral ParaHox cluster. All other clusters contain only a
single ParaHox gene at most. The ParaHox complex is
even more fragmented in teleost fish, and Mulley et al.
[42] argued that there are no teleost ParaHox clusters at
all. However, if the adjoining genes of the ParaHox clusters are taken into account, the syntenic structure of the
genomic region/paralogon that contains the ParaHox
gene(s) becomes apparent [43-45] (see Figure 1) and the
evolutionary history of the clusters can be reconstructed.
The present study regards a ParaHox paralogon as the
ParaHox gene(s) from a cluster together with the respective 3' adjoining genes as a [46] (see Figure 1). Therefore,
genes located 5'of the whole paralogon are referred to as
5'of a gene X and genes more towards the 3'end of a paralogon are referred to as 3'of a particular gene X, irrespective of the orientation of gene X.

For this study we conducted an analysis of the genomic
evolution of vertebrate ParaHox paralogons. Specifically,
we were interested in the ParaHox clusters C and D and
the adjoining type III receptor tyrosine kinase genes (pdgfrα/kit and pdgfrβ/csf1r respectively) that were shown to be
involved in teleost coloration [46-49]. To this end, we
determined the DNA sequence of the entire ParaHox C1
paralogon in the East African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, and compared it to orthologous regions in other teleosts' genomes (Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Tetraodon
nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes, Gasterosteus aculeatus) and
mammals (Mus musculus, Homo sapiens) as well as to the
Astatotilapia burtoni ParaHox D paralogons [46]. This was
done in order to investigate the genomic consequences of
several rounds of genome duplication in the vertebrate
lineage (Figure 2).

Results and discussion
To investigate the evolution of the vertebrate ParaHox paralogons C and D we shotgun sequenced a BAC clone of a
BAC library of the East African cichlid fish Astatotilapia
burtoni [50] that contained the C1 ParaHox paralogon,
i.e., the ParaHox gene gsh2 and its 3'adjoining genes. The
obtained BAC contig (GenBank accession EF526075 GenBank accession number: sequence will be submitted upon
acceptance of the paper) was then further analyzed and
compared to the sequences of two other BAC clones of the
African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, 20D21 (DQ386647)
and 26M7 (DQ386648) containing the D1 and D2 paralogons [46].
Sequence assembly and analysis
This analysis showed that the C(1) ParaHox gene locus
and its 3' adjoining genes of Danio rerio is located on chromosome 20, of Takifugu rubripes on scaffold 13, of Tetraodon nigroviridis on 'chromosome1_random', of
Gasterosteus aculeatus on group VIII, of Homo sapiens on
chromosome 4, of Mus musculus of chromosome 5 and of
Oryzias latipes on the scaffolds 1,264 (gsh2, pdgfrα), 578
(kita, kdrb) and 2,436 (clock) (see Figure 3 and see Additional File 1 [Table S1] for details).

Sequences for the C2 and the D ParaHox gene loci and
their 3' adjoining genes were also retrieved from the aforementioned databases and aligned by hand. The locations
of the different genes in the respective genome assemblies
are summarized in Additional File 1.
Identification and characterization of Astatotilapia
burtoni ParaHox paralogon containing BAC clones
The BAC library was screened for the C1 ParaHox paralogon gene kita as described previously [50]. A PCR screen
for the presence of the ParaHox gene gsh2 was subsequently performed to identify BAC clones covering the
entire C1 ParaHox paralogon. The kita and gsh2 positive

clone 99M12, which was determined to have an insert
length of 154 kb, was chosen for further investigation. The
BAC clone was shotgun sequenced and BAC contigs were
assembled into a scaffold and a complete sequence as
described earlier [50].
BLAST searches [51] of the assembled contigs against
GENBANK [52] showed that five genes were at least partially present in the BAC clone 99M12 (Figures 1 and 4):
genomic screened homeo box 2 (gsh2), the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor α (pdgfrα), the a – copy of the v-kit
Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
(kita), the b – copy of the kinase insert domain receptor
(kdrb) and the circadian locomoter output cycles kaput (clock)
(Figures 1 and 4). The C1 ParaHox paralogon was found
to be the paralogon with the highest number of 3' adjoining genes in teleosts.
Using cDNAs, annotated and predicted genes of Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio available on NCBI
[52], we deduced the coding sequences of Takifugu
rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus
aculeatus and Astatotilapia burtoni. We were able to assemble the complete coding sequences of four of the five
genes located on the BAC clone 99M12 of A. burtoni. The

only incompletely assembled gene is kdrb where approximately 200 bp of the coding sequence are missing.
From the beginning of the gene gsh2 to the end of clock
this sequence of the clone 99M12 spans 133.56 kb. This
length was used for comparisons of the lengths of the C1
ParaHox paralogons of the different organisms used in
this study (Homo sapiens, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus
and Astatotilapia burtoni) because the real length of the
inserted gaps is unknown as of present.
Another BAC clone (26M7) of the Astatotilapia burtoni
BAC library contains the genes caudal type homeo box transcription factor 1 a (cdx1a), the platelet-derived growth factor
receptor β1 (pdgfrβ1) and the colony-stimulating factor 1
receptor a (csf1ra) [46]. These three genes plus the fmsrelated tyrosine kinase 4 (flt4) that is not present on the
clone belong to the D1 ParaHox paralogon, whereas the
clone 20D21 was found to contain the genes plateletderived growth factor receptor β2 (pdgfrβ2) and the colonystimulating factor 1 receptor b (csf1rb) [46]. These two genes
plus the caudal type homeobox transcription factor 1b (cdx1b)
(not contained on this BAC clone) form the D2 ParaHox
paralogon. The genes kitb and clock3, belong to the C2

Hox paralogons as defined above.
The ancestral ParaHox complex fish is fragmented in teleosts fish [42]. Therefore, we use the expression ParaHox
"paralogon" instead of "cluster" since, especially for the
case of the C2 ParaHox paralogon, not a single ParaHox
gene is still present and in the case of the D2 ParaHox paralogon, the data we investigated did not include the ParaHox cdx1b gene. Possibly the most interesting finding is
that the ParaHox complex of teleost fish, even after
another round of whole genome duplication (WGD), the
FSGD, and subsequent deletion of genes, contains exactly
the same number of genes and orthologous set of ParaHox genes as the mammalian four ParaHox clusters which
did not experience the FSGD. This is all the more surprising since in teleosts all six ParaHox genes are distributed
across seven instead of four paralogons, and there is not a
single complete ParaHox cluster left in the fish lineage
[42]. As outlined above, the ParaHox paralogous genomic
regions remain identifiable and we wish to emphasize
that the paralogous relationship of the RTKs and other
genes 3' of the remnants of those ParaHox clusters stay
intact. This is because the remaining genes of the ParaHox
clusters, and the 3' adjoining RTKs, as well as the genes
clock and clock3 that lie directly 3' of the RTKs on the C1
and C2 ParaHox clusters respectively, clearly form paralogous genomic regions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/312

The C1, C2, D1 and D2 ParaHox paralogons
Using sequence orthology to Astatotilapia burtoni we were
able to determine the C and D ParaHox paralogons of
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Oryzias latipes and Gasterosteus
aculeatus (Additional File 1).

We were unable to find the gene clock in the G. aculeatus
genome except for two very short blast hits. Since each of
the genes of the C1 ParaHox paralogon of this species lies
on different contigs within one scaffold, it seems likely
that this gene was not correctly assembled in the current
release of the stickleback genome. The entire D2 ParaHox
paralogon of D. rerio and a major portion of the expected
paralogon of G. aculeatus could not be located in the current releases of public genomic databases. The flt4 gene of
M. musculus was relocated to another chromosome and
the flt4 of H. sapiens was relocated to a location 30 Mb 5'
of cdx1. Therefore it was excluded from the following
analyses. The cdx1b of Tetraodon nigroviridis is relocated as
well and the cdx1b of Oryzias latipes is reversed. All other
examined organisms kept the orientations and positions
unaltered in reference to the more 5' genes, but the distance to those is always very large (Figure 5).
The orientation and the order of the genes of the C ParaHox paralogons are conserved in all vertebrates species
examined (Figures 3 and 4), implying that the orientation

and order of these genes have remained unchanged for
more than 450 my [53]. The genes gsh2, pdgfrα and kita
with its paralogous gene kitb all have a 5' – 3' orientation.
The genes kdrb and clock as well as its paralogous gene
clock3, show a 3' – 5' orientation (Figures 3 and 4,
[42,45]). The genomic architecture of the D1 and D2
ParaHox paralogons is less conserved. The orientation of
the genes has stayed the same in all but one species
included in this study. Yet, in four genomes the position
of a gene compared to pdgfrβa/b and csf1ra/b has changed
(Figure 5). Furthermore, the csf1rb gene seems to have
been lost in Danio rerio [46]. The gene content of all other
paralogons examined in this study was completely conserved.
The presumed ancestral condition of the C ParaHox paralogon that can still be found in mammalian genomes
[43,45], it is also conserved in all teleostean a-copies of
this ParaHox paralogon (Figures 1a and 3). In all organisms examined here, the b-copy of the C ParaHox complex
has lost genes, namely gsh2, pdgfrα and kdrb. The remaining genes of this paralogon nevertheless retained their orientation. A similar scenario can be seen in the D ParaHox
paralogon. Here only the b-copy of the gene flt4, a 2R-paralog of kdrb, was lost. We found no trace of clock-like genes
3' of the RTKs so we can not say whether both clock copies
were deleted or if the clock precursor was located in the C
ParaHox paralogon after the precursor of the C and the D
ParaHox paralogons was duplicated. This implies that
there never was a clock-like gene in the D1 and D2 ParaHox paralogons.
It seems quite remarkable, that this gene complex maintained both its gene order as well as gene orientation
(with the exception of two genes) over very significant
evolutionary time spans. Only the lengths of the introns
and intergenic regions differ between the species examined. Possible reasons for this conservation might be
related to the presence of promoter, enhancer or inhibitor
motifs in that complex that influence more than just one
gene, so that an inversion or a relocation of one gene
would possibly destroy the regulation of the proteins constructed from this and other genes nearby. If such a co-regulation exists, it might explain the maintenance of the
gene order and gene orientation over the course of vertebrate evolution. Chiou et al. [54] showed an example of
the important role of clustering in the regulation of the
expression of biosynthetic genes in A. parasiticus.
Another possibility might be that a regulator is not located
immediately next to its corresponding gene but at a distance, and that other genes exist between regulator and
corresponding gene. A relocation or inversion in such a
case is expected to lead to disruption of the interactions. It
has already been shown that regulatory genes or regions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/312

lying in a gene cluster are able to control the expression of
genes outside of this cluster [55]. Nevertheless, the selective pressures leading to the maintenance of gene clusters
are still poorly understood.
In both the C and the D paralogons, only the a-copy
retained the ParaHox gene. It was either lost (C2 copy) or
relocated (D2 copy, Figure 5). So the b-paralogon in both
cases lost more genes than the a-paralogon. Therefore,
when comparing the C and the D ParaHox paralogons it
is apparent that the a-copies of the ParaHox paralogons C
and D of the teleosts are more conserved and show a
higher degree of synteny with the mammalian ParaHox
paralogons than the b-copies. Interestingly, this finding is
similar to the pattern previously found in the Hox clusters
[56]. This finding implies that one copy of the paralogon
pair evolved faster than the other. That this is always usually the b-copy is explained most easily by the fact that the
more conserved (a) copy is much more likely to be discovered and named first.
To further investigate this issue, we performed relative rate
tests as described previously [46]. These analyses revealed
that the genes of the C paralogons always evolved slower
than that of the D paralogons, compared to the human
gene (data not shown). Also, we found that the a-paralogon genes always evolved more slowly that the b-copy,
except cdx1. cdx1a/b, that are a part of the D1/D2 paralogons respectively, the b-copy evolved more slowly than
the a-copy, for unknown reasons – even though the rest of
the paralogon follows the normal trend (see Table 1). In
this regard, the 3' end and the 5' end of the D1/D2 paralogons seem to experience different evolutionary forces.
To search for conserved regions that could possibly be
promoter regions, enhancers or inhibitors, we performed
a mVista plot analysis comparing the C1 ParaHox paralogon of Astatotilapia burtoni with those of Takifugu rubripes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. The genes
of these paralogons were, as already mentioned, gsh2, pdgfrα, kita, kdrb and clock (Figure 6). The results are similar
to our previous analyses of the D Parahox paralogons
[46]. Conserved intergenic regions immediately upstream
of the genes gsh2, pdgfrα and kita can clearly be detected.
Furthermore, there are conserved regions also following
the gene clock as well as between it and kdrb. Another conserved region is apparent immediately 3' of kita as well as
between the genes gsh2 and pdgfrα (Figure 6). The conserved elements upstream of the genes gsh2 and pdgfrα
and a region between kdrb and clock are, at least in part,
conserved in all vertebrates examined. Through blasting
of a subset of the A. burtoni sequence against the available
databases, we found that the conserved sequences
between the genes kdrb and clock, are similar to another

gene, a transmembrane protein called HTP-1. The other
conserved intergenic regions are only conserved in teleost
fish. examined and BLAST searches of those regions of the
BAC clone 99M12 revealed them to be SINE and LINE elements. As only the fugu specific mask was available, not
all elements could be masked efficiently. The only exception to that pattern is the region in Oryzias latipes in the

second part of the gene clock. Because of problems in the
genome assembly of this organism these data could not be
used in the mVista blot analysis and, therefore, medaka
had to be omitted from this analysis. As already mentioned, the gene clock of Gasterosteus aculeatus could not be
located in its genome assembly. Only two short BLAST
hits for clock were found with bl2seq (Figure 6).

Shuffle-LAGAN vista blot. Comparisons of the C1 and C2 ParaHox paralogons from A. burtoni (query sequence) with T.
rubripes, T. nigroviridis, D. rerio, O. latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Mus musculus and H. sapiens. The blue peaks are conserved areas
in exons of the genes and in pink conserved intergenic regions are indicated. The genes shown on the graph are from left to
right: gsh2, pdgfrα, kita, kdrb and clock.

A comparison of the C1 ParaHox paralogons of Homo
sapiens, Astatotilapia burtoni, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis and Gasterosteus aculeatus (Figures 3
and 4) showed that the cichlid sequence is of an intermediate length. It is considerably shorter that H. sapiens
(10%),D. rerio (39%) and O. latipes (34%) but longer
than T. nigroviridis (150%), T. rubripes (141%) and G.
aculeatus (135%) (see Additional file 2). In O. latipes only
fragments of clock, the last gene of the paralogon, could be
found. Because of seemingly incomplete assembly in this
genomic region 34% might not be the final result.
Our previous study [46] showed that the sequence of the
cichlid D1 ParaHox paralogon again is of an intermediate
length, being shorter than that of D. rerio (29%) but
longer that the other D1 paralogons of the other species
investigated (O. latipes 102%, T. nigroviridis 148%, T.
rubripes 140%, G. aculeatus 125%). In both cases the mammalian sequence is the longest and the sequences of the
pufferfishes the shortest (see Additional file 2). To test if
this is a paralogon-specific effect or an effect of the differ-

ent genome sizes of the various organisms, we plotted
genome size versus cluster size. Figure 7 shows the comparisons (regression analyses) between the genome sizes
of different organisms and the length of the C1, C2, D1
and D2 paralogons. The genome sizes of Homo sapiens,
Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon
nigroviridis, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Oryzias latipes were
taken from the animal genome size database [57]. The
genome size estimate of Astatotilapia burtoni was obtained
from reference [50].
While the C1 paralogons of teleosts show a similar
genome size to cluster size relationship as the mammalian
clusters, the C2 clusters are much more condensed but
also show the same trend, namely that the cluster size is
linked to overall genome size (Figure 7). The D1 paralogons are also much more condensed than the C1 paralogons, but they also display a linear relationship between
genome and cluster size, including also the mammalian
sequences. An obvious deviation from previously
described pattern can be seen in the D2 paralogons of the

ences therein]. For the Hox gene clusters of teleosts, it has
been observed before [[39] and references therein] that,
although all fish genomes studied so far vary in the gene
content and even number of Hox gene clusters, the total
number of Hox genes contained in their genomes is about
the same as in the genomes of tetrapods, which did not
experience this WGD. It has been suggested that particularly the Hox gene clusters are, typically, maintained more
or less intact, because they are likely to be strongly regulated by sequential activation and cluster completeness is
necessitated by corrected interdigitated gene control [58].

Comparison (regression analyses) of the genome size

pufferfishes. Relative to their very compact genome size,
the D2 paralogon is surprisingly large. A possible reason
for this could be that the maximal condensation of this
cluster has already been reached and a further condensation might be detrimental in terms of selection. We can
only speculate on this, but the minimum absolute size of
the ParaHox paralogons might be determined by the necessary spatial relationships of the individual transcriptional units within these gene complexes and regulatory
regions might need to be maintained at a minimal distance in the intergenic regions of adjacent genes in order
to maintain the proper function of these genes. The Astatotilapia burtoni D2 ParaHox paralogon could not be
included in this comparison because the gene cdx1b is not
on the investigated BAC clone.
Gene cluster breakup and gene retention after genome
duplications
The FSGD provides the opportunity to study genomes following a whole genome duplication event [[33] and refer-

What seems remarkable as well is that the evolutionary
forces keeping Hox gene number rather constant seem to
be stronger than those that maintain the cohesion and
physical linkage on chromosomes of individual clusters
following a WGD. Mulley et al. [42] noted that the ParaHox cluster stayed intact in ancestral fish lineages such as
Amia and Polypterus, yet noted the fragmentation of the
ParaHox clusters in teleosts, that happened due to gene
loss and not because of transpositions or inversions [42].
The FSGD duplicated all genomic regions including the
clustered sets of homeobox genes such as Hox, ParaHox
and NK. The selection pressures that maintained those
clusters intact in part of the metazoans, seem to be
relaxed, as for many of these gene clusters, several genes
seem to have been lost [59], despite the fact that these,
often apparently co-regulated arrays of genes, seem to
share enhancers and are regulated in an interdigitated
fashion (Figure 1). Mulley et al. [42] proposed that the
maintenance of a gene cluster is based on interdigitated
and/or shared enhancers. The FSGD duplicated not only
the genes but also the enhancers and therefore might have
released the need for a tight clustering. Our analysis of the
ParaHox clusters in teleosts supports this idea in so far as
the ParaHox clusters are broken up. Yet, the total number
of six ParaHox genes is maintained in post duplication teleost genomes. If the comparison is extended to a larger
paralogon than the set of ParaHox genes alone – as was
done in this study -it becomes clear that in larger genomic
regions there the constancy of gene numbers does not persist. Our analysis shows that some, although not all, additional duplicated genes flanking the ParaHox clusters
were retained following a WGD (Figure 1). This might
imply that different selective forces such as increased tolerance to more gene product, due to the doubled number
of genes, or functional changes (sub-, neofunctionalization) of those genes might be acting. This finding might
argue that although differential gene loss on different
chromosomal regions is permitted following a WGD
through genetic redundancy of cis-regulatory elements,
the overall constancy of gene number is strongly selected
for by balancing selection at least for transcription factors
such as ParaHox genes. Balancing selection might be acting on trans-regulatory mechanisms to countact possibly

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:312

negative effects of dosage differences. Moreover, possibly
weaker selective forces against duplicate genes might permit the retention of probably not co-regulated genes outside of gene clusters after a WGD on one hand. It seems
plausible that these different selective forces might also
have to do with not only their arrangements in clusters,
but also which kind of gene is duplicated (e.g., regulatory
genes vs. housekeeping genes). Again, selection might act
more strongly in bringing about the loss of interdigitated
genes within cluster following a WGD to maintain a
modal gene number per genome of these clustered homeobox genes in order to reduce potentially negative
changes in dosage following a WGD. The fact, that the
number of ParaHox genes before and after the FSGD
remained unchanged, indicates a possibly strong regulatory gene dose restriction that would select for the rapid
loss of "superfluous" genes. With the exception of the
gene cdx1 no gene of the ancestral ParaHox cluster was
retained in two copies. Possibly one of the two cdx1 genes
may be compensating for the loss of cdx2 gene, hence the
retention of two cdx1 genes (Figure 1b, [42]).
Recently Negre and Ruiz [60] have discovered a surprising
diversity of Hox gene cluster architectures in different species of Drosophila. Since breaks and inversions were found
not too infrequently, they argue that not the integrity and
organization of Hox clusters is the strongest target of selection. Rather they argue that functional constraints on individual Hox genes might be acting more forcefully on
genomes so that functional sets of homeobox genes are
maintained in the genome, which are not necessarily
physically linked with unbroken colinearity. Other studies showed that an intact cluster is only important for temporal and not for special colinearity. In Drosophila where
development is so rapid that almost all the Hox genes are
activated at the same time, the cluster is permitted to be
interrupted [[61] and references therein]. Similar reasoning might explain the sitution we describe for "dissolved"
ParaHox parologons. Their genomically fixed gene content and orientation in teleost genomes, but their dispersed distribution over seven instead of four
chromosomal regions would support the hypothesis that
overall gene content is more strongly selected for than the
integrity of gene clusters.

Conclusion
We demonstrated the orthologous relationship of the
genes of the C and D ParaHox paralogons (Figure 2). Relative rate tests revealed that with the exception of one gene
the a-copy always evolves more slowly than the b-copy,
the exception being the ParaHox gene cdx1, where the bcopy evolves significantly slower. The relative rate tests
also show that the C paralogons evolve more slowly than
the D paralogons.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/312

A mVista analysis of the D clusters was performed in an
earlier study [46]. We found a number of conserved
genomic regions in the C1 ParaHox paralogon that were
located in intergenic regions. One conserved sequence
block, located at the position 119–130 kb on the A. burtoni BAC clone 99M12, was confirmed to be another gene,
the transmembrane protein HPT-1, by BLAST search. We
also found evidence that the ParaHox paralogon of the
pufferfishes is apparently close to the maximal possible
reduction in size.
Despite having undergone an additional genome duplication the total number of ParaHox genes in the genome of
teleost fish is maintained at six genes that are distributed
over seven chromosomal regions instead of four as in the
genomes of tetrapods. Other genes that are physically
linked with the ParaHox genes in the same paralogon
were also reduced in number following the FSGD. However, while typically ten of these are found in tetrapods 14
are maintained in teleost fish genomes. We discuss possible selective reasons for keeping modal numbers of
homoebox genes constant throughout hundreds of millions of years of evolution while permitting to differentially loose ParaHox genes on some ParaHox paralogons.
Future research should include the description of possible
binding sites in the conserved elements and functional
studies of those putative regulatory elements found by in
silico analyses.

Methods
BAC Library screening & Shotgun Sequencing
We previously constructed a BAC library of the East African haplochromine cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni [50].
This library was screened for kita positive clones with the
kita specific primer set Burt-Kit-F-474/Burt-Kit_R-672
according to [46]. Using universal primers (gsh2_Ex1_For
(AGAYCCCAGRAGATACCACT)
and
gsh2_Ex2.3_R
(GTGCGCGCTCCTCTGGGTG)) designed on known teleost sequences, we confirmed the presence of the gsh2 gene
on the BAC clone. The BAC plasmids of the recovered
clones were extracted using the Large-Construct Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's manual and then
sheared by sonification. The fraction of 2–3 kb was recovered from an agarose gel and blunt-end-ligated into the
pUC18 vector of Roche and later electro-transformed into
"Electro Max DH10B T1 Phage Resistant Cells" (Invitrogen). The subclones were grown in standard LB-medium
(0.5 mg/ml ampicillin). The plasmid DNA was recovered
using standard methods. The clones were sequenced
directly using a standard M13F/M13R primer set on an
ABI3100 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Contig Assembly
The obtained sequences were quality trimmed by hand
and checked for vector sequences using Sequencher 4.2
(Gene Codes Corporation). The same software was used
for the contig assembly at the setting "dirty data", with a
sequence similarity of 85% and an overlap of 20 bp. The
full sequence of the genome of E. coli from the GENBANK
database [52] was added to the analyses, so that all E. coli
contaminated reads were filtered out of the assembly.
Gaps between contigs were closed with gap spanning
primers, designed with Primer3 [62]. For further analyses
the remaining gaps were closed by 33 N's each.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/312

rat/rodent specific RepeatMasker was used. For all other
sequences the fugu-specific RepeatMasker was used as a
stand in.

Authors' contributions
This study was conceived by SH, WS, IB and AM. Most of
the laboratory work was done by NS and IB. In silico analyses were conducted by NS with the help of SH, WS and
IB. The manuscript was drafted by NS and read and
revised by all authors.

Additional material

The contigs of the BAC clone 99M12 were checked for corresponding forward/reverse clones in other contigs and a
contig map was drawn. To check this map, the contigs
were assembled into one single sequence according to the
contig map. Using the tool bl2seq (align two sequences)
(GENBANK database) [52], the contigs were BLASTsearched against chromosome 11 of Tetraodon nigroviridis
containing its C1 ParaHox cluster. The contig map was
then corrected using the information from the bl2seq
analysis.
Sequence Annotation
The ontology of the genes sequenced were determined by
sequence comparisons with the available genomes of Takifugu rubripes [63], (version 4.0), Tetraodon nigroviridis
[64], (version 1–64), Oryzias latipes [65], (version
200506), Gasterosteus aculeatus [66], (version 41) and
already annotated genes from Danio rerio, Mus musculus
and Homo sapiens were taken from GENBANK [52]. The
provided annotations of the Homo sapiens, Mus musculus
and Danio rerio sequences from GENBANK database [52]
were used to help to identify the intron/exon structure of
the respective genes in Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Oryzias latipes. In some cases the Danio rerio
sequence could not be included into the analyses due to
apparent miss-assemblies.
Phylogenetic and Sequence Analyses
For phylogenetic analyses, Nexus files were processed via
PAUP* [67] to eliminate positions that could not be
aligned. The appropriate models of molecular evolution
were estimated using the program modelgenerator [68].
Maximum likelihood trees and bootstrapping (1000 replicates) were calculated in PHYML [69]. Bayesian Inference was performed in Mr. Bayes 3.1 [70,71] (1,000,000
generations/5000 burnin).

Vista Plots were obtained via the mVista option on the
Vista homepage [72]. The alignment program used was
LAGAN (Global multiple alignment of finished
sequences) [73]. For Homo sapiens the human/primatespecific RepeatMasker and for Mus musculus the mouse/
