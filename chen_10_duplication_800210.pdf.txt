Abstract
Background: Mosquito vitellogenin (Vtg) genes belong to a small multiple gene family that encodes the major yolk
protein precursors required for egg production. Multiple Vtg genes have been cloned and characterized from several
mosquito species, but their origin and molecular evolution are poorly understood.
Results: Here we used in silico and molecular cloning techniques to identify and characterize the evolution of the Vtg
gene family from the genera Culex, Aedes/Ochlerotatus, and Anopheles. We identified the probable ancestral Vtg gene
among different mosquito species by its conserved association with a novel gene approximately one kilobase
upstream of the start codon. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Vtg gene family arose by duplication events, but
that the pattern of duplication was different in each mosquito genera. Signatures of purifying selection were detected
in Culex, Aedes and Anopheles. Gene conversion is a major driver of concerted evolution in Culex, while unequal
crossover is likely the major driver of concerted evolution in Anopheles. In Aedes, smaller fragments have undergone
gene conversion events.
Conclusions: The study shows concerted evolution and purifying selection shaped the evolution of mosquito Vtg
genes following gene duplication. Additionally, similar evolutionary patterns were observed in the Vtg genes from
other invertebrate and vertebrate organisms, suggesting that duplication, concerted evolution and purifying selection
may be the major evolutionary forces driving Vtg gene evolution across highly divergent taxa.
Background
Vitellogenin (Vtg) genes encode the major yolk protein
precursors which are utilized in oviparous organisms to
provide nutrition for the developing embryo. In oviparous vertebrates, Vtgs are synthesized in the liver of the
mature female under the control of estrogen, secreted
into the bloodstream, transported to the ovary and selectively taken up by the oocytes [1,2]. In insects, Vtgs are
synthesized primarily in the fat body of female adults
under the regulation of juvenile hormone and/or 20hydroxyecdysone (20E), secreted into the hemolymph
and taken up by the developing oocytes via receptormediated endocytosis [3-8].

The female adults of many mosquito species require a
vertebrate blood meal to develop eggs, leading to the
transmission of a variety of pathogens in humans, wildlife
and domestic animals. Understanding the molecular
mechanism of blood meal or nutrition-induced synthesis
of Vtg proteins may lead to insights for novel mosquito
control strategies. Great gains have been made in understanding the mechanisms that regulate blood mealinduced vitellogenesis the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The
cDNA encoding the Ae. aegypti VgA1 gene has been characterized and its genomic sequence containing 2015 bp of
the 5' promoter region cloned [9,10]. Studies on transcriptional expression and regulation identified a combination of nutritional stimuli (free amino acids) and the
steroid hormone 20E as the key factors required for activation of vitellogenesis. The expression of Vtgs and other
yolk precursor protein (YPP) genes is inhibited by the
AaGATAr transcription factor during the previtellogenic
period. After digesting a blood meal, amino acids are

released from the midgut and activate the TOR signalling
pathway in the fat body, resulting in the subsequent derepression of YPP gene transcription by displacing
AaGATAr with another GATA factor [11-16]. Since mosquito Vtg synthesis is activated by a blood meal in a sex-,
tissue-, and stage-specific manner, its promoter region
has been used to control the precise temporal and spatial
expression of exogenous genes (such as anti-pathogen
effector molecules) in engineered mosquitoes [17-20].
Recently, several new Vtg gene sequences were isolated
from several mosquito species including Anopheles albimanus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. polynesiensis, Ae. albopictus,
Ochlerotatus atropalpus, Oc. triseriatus, Culex pipiens
and Toxorhynchites amboinensis [21]. Comparative
sequence analysis performed among three Vtg genes from
Ae. aegypti suggested that Vg-A1 and Vg-B were closely
related and possibly arose by a recent gene duplication
event, while Vg-C was distantly related to the Vg-A1 and
Vg-B lineage, and possibly arose by an earlier gene duplication event [21]. Nevertheless, the study of the evolution
of the Vtg gene family among mosquitoes in general is
still limited. In this paper, we used in silico and molecular
cloning techniques to identify and characterize the evolution of the Vtg gene family from the genera Culex, Aedes,
Ochlerotatus and Anopheles. We were also able to identify
the probable ancestral Vtg gene copy among mosquito
genera.

Results
Isolation of mosquito Vtg genes by in silico whole genome
analysis and molecular cloning

The release of the whole genome sequences of Cx. pipiens, Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae enabled us to analyze
the genomic organization of Vtg genes and examine their
evolutionary pattern across mosquito genera. By using a
Vtg gene from Ae. aegypti (GenBank accession L41842) as
query to BLAST search the Cx. pipiens whole genome
sequence, four intact Vtg genes were identified, designated
as
CpVg1a
(GenBank
accession
NZ_AAWU01017720), CpVg1b (GenBank accession
NZ_AAWU01017726), CpVg2a and CpVg2b (GenBank
accession AAWU01001936) ("Cp" refers to the first letters
of genus and species name; other mosquito Vtg genes in
the following text are designated in a similar fashion).
Each of these genes contained a different sequence in
their 5' promoter regions, indicating they were positioned
at different genomic loci. CpVg2a and CpVg2b were clustered together and organized in a "tail-to-tail" orientation
with an intergenic region of 5,113 bp. It was not clear
whether CpVg1a and CpVg1b were clustered due to limitations in the genome assembly. The two Vtg families
CpVg1 and CpVg2 shared 64.8%-65.7% nucleotide identity, while subfamily CpVg1a and CpVg1b shared

extremely high nucleotide identity (98.9%), as did CpVg2a
and CpVg2b (98.4%) (Table 1).
BLAST searches revealed three Vtg genes in the Ae.
aegypti
genome
sequence
(AeVgA,
accession
AAGE02018519; AeVgB, accession AAGE02009986 and
AeVgC, accession AAGE02009985), consistent with previous studies [9,10,21]. Based on the genome sequence
data, we determined the organization of these three
genes. AeVgB and AeVgC were located in the same super
contig (supercont1.191) with an intergenic region of
approximately 115 kb (super contig location; AeVgB:
160,790-167,359; AeVgC: 39,434-45,832), while AeVgA
was located in a different supercontig (supercont1.477)
(VectorBase). These three genes shared 61.4%-88.4%
nucleotide identity.
BLAST searches revealed three Vtg genes from whole
genome sequence of An. gambiae (ACCESSION
AAAB01008880) and non-redundant database in GenBank (ACCESSION AF281078). The former encoded
three Vtg genes (AgVg1, AgVg2 and AgVg3), but with partial coding sequence for AgVg1 and AgVg2; the later
encoded AgVg1 and AgVg2 with partial sequence for
AgVg2. The AgVg2 sequence was partial due to a genome
sequence gap, but by combining data from both datasets
we obtained intact sequences for AgVg1 and AgVg3 (Figure 1). All three Vtg genes showed extremely high nucleotide identity (98.1%-99.2%) and are encoded as a tandem
repeat in the An. gambiae genome (Figure 1).
When we attempted to isolate and clone the 5' promoter region of the Cx. tarsalis Vtg gene, the obtained
sequence data lead us to identify four different loci that
had high conservation in the coding sequence but unique
5'-promoter regions. On the basis of the Cx. pipiens Vtg
gene coding sequence, multiple sets of primers were
designed to isolate the intact Vtg genes from Cx. tarsalis.
We first cloned the partial coding sequences and then
obtained the 5' and 3' end fragments. Specific primers
located in the 5' promoter region and 3'coding or 3'UTR
regions were designed to amplify the full length genes.
Four full length Vtg genes from Cx. tarsalis were isolated,
designated as CtVg1a, CtVg1b, CtVg2a and CtVg2b.
Sequence analysis indicated that the two Vtg families
CpVg1 and CpVg2 shared 64.3%-65.5% nucleotide identity, while subfamily CtVg1a and CtVg1b shared
extremely high nucleotide identity (98.1%), as did CtVg2a
and CtVg2b (97.0%) (Table 1).
Identification of the ancestral Vtg gene copy in mosquitoes

While isolating the 5'-promoter region of the CtVg1b
gene, we identified a novel gene 805 bp upstream of the
CtVg1b start codon, in the opposite orientation. This
small gap between the start codons of the novel gene and
CtVg1b suggests that this region may act as a bidirectional promoter. The novel gene contained two putatively

functional protein-protein binding domains - a RINGfinger domain and MATH domain (Figure 2a) and has
homology to the human tripartite motif protein 37
(TRIM37) gene - we therefore refer to this gene as
TRIM37-like (T37L) protein. By examining Vtg gene
sequence data from other mosquitoes (Cx. pipiens, Ae.
aegypti, Ae. polynesiensis, An. gambiae and Oc. triseriatus) we identified T37L homologues upstream of one of
the Vtg copies in all species examined (Figure 2). Among
mosquitoes, the size of the intergenic region ranged from
769 bp to 1004 bp (Figure 2). The T37L amino acid
sequences were highly conserved among mosquito species (Figure 2). RT-PCR showed that in Cx. tarsalis
CtT37L was transcriptionally expressed in all developmental stages (Figure 2). Interestingly, the down-stream
associated Vtg gene (CtVg1b) is also expressed in all
developmental stages [22]. The discovery of conservation
of the T37L-Vtg structure in all examined mosquito
genomes indicated the Vtg gene in this special organization was likely the ancestral origin of mosquito Vtg genes
through gene duplication events.
Identification of orthologues and paralogues between
closely-related mosquito species

To determine the orthologous relationship of the Vtg
genes from Cx. pipiens and Cx. tarsalis, we used their 5'
promoter sequences to calculate identity by BLAST analysis (Table 1). The vertical and horizontal directions in
Figure 3 show orthologous and paralogous relationship,
respectively. The 5' promoter region of each orthologous
gene shared 70.6-85.3% nucleotide identity, while producing no significant match with any other Vtg gene (Figure 3). For example, CtVg1a shared 81.1% nucleotide
identity with CpVg1a in their 1.1 Kb 5' promoter region
directly upstream of the start codon, but no significant
match alignment with that region from the other Vtg
genes.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis using the full Vtg coding sequences
was used to examine the evolution of Vtg genes among

mosquitoes (Figure 4). All analyses gave identical tree
morphology. With the exception of the Culex Vg2 group
(which represents a duplication event unique to the genus
Culex), all other mosquito Vtg genes conformed to three
major clades: Aedes/Ochlerotatus, Culex and Anopheles.
The Aedes/Ochlerotatus clade is more closely related to
the Culex Vg1 clade than the Anopheles clade, which is in
agreement with the agreed relationships of these genera.
Paralogous copies cluster more closely than orthologues
within each clade. Three independent duplication patterns were observed among mosquito genera. In Culex, a
divergent duplication event produced the Vg1 and Vg2
genes, which each then underwent additional independent duplications generating four Vtg genes in total.
These duplication events occurred prior to the divergence of pipiens and tarsalis within the genus. The
absence of Vg2 homologues in non-Culex genera may
reflect a unique duplication event in Culex, or less likely,
independent gene loss events in Anopheles and Aedes/
Ochlerotatus. In Aedes, the early duplication from the
ancestral copy generated the VgA/B lineage, which underwent an additional duplication to generate 3 Vtg copies these duplication events occurred prior to the divergence
of the Aedes and Ochlerotatus genera. In Anopheles, Vtg
gene duplication events occurred rapidly during tandem
repeat generation (Figure 4). Unlike Culex and Aedes/
Ochlerotatus, none of the An. gambiae Vtg genes cluster
with other members of the genus, suggesting that the
rapid tandem repeat generation occurred after the split of
gambiae from the other members of the Anopheles genus.
Concerted evolution between mosquito Culex gene
paralogues Vg1a and Vg1b

Concerted evolution occurs in multigene families and is
expected to generate a higher sequence similarity
between paralogues than between orthologues. Statistically significant fragments were identified in paralogues
Vg1a and Vg1b in the genus Culex. The predicted conversion fragments include not only coding regions but also
non coding DNA such as 5' promoter regions and introns
(Table 2).

Though concerted evolution certainly plays an important role in maintaining the high level of mosquito Vtg
gene sequence conservation, an alternative explanation
for high sequence homogeneity is "birth and death" evolution under strong purifying selection [23-25]]. The two

models of evolution could be distinguished by comparing
the number of synonymous differences per site (Ps)
within and between species. In the presence of strong
purifying selection without concerted evolution, DNA
sequence differences will be observed primarily at the

Figure 3 Orthologous/paralogous relationship of Vtg genes in Cx. tarsalis and Cx pipiens. Orthologous and paralogous gene relationships
were determined by nucleotide identity of their 5'promoter regions. The thin solid lines represent 5'promoter and 3'end regions, open boxes represent coding sequences, and the filled box represents intron sequence. Sequence direction (5' and 3') and the number of nucleotides with high identity

synonymous sites. If a gene has undergone concerted
evolution, sequence differences will not be biased toward
synonymous sites. If strong purifying selection is responsible for the observed pattern, intraspecific and interspecific synonymous differences are expected to be similar. If
intraspecific synonymous differences are much lower
than interspecific difference, this would suggest that concerted evolution is the dominant force. In our dataset, Ps
values in some paralogous pairs are much lower than that
in orthologous pairs. For example, Ps values ranged from
0.0316 to 0.0525 in the paralogous pairs CtVg1a-CtVg1b
and CpVg1a-CpVg1b, but ranged from 0.1809 to 0.1851 in
the orthologous combinations (Table 3). The Ps value
range of 0.0316 to 0.0525 was far from saturation level
(0.4-0.7 in many species) [23]. Moreover, extremely high
sequence conservation was observed between paralogous
introns (88.5% to 100%), but was lower between orthologous introns (63.3% to 81.5%) in Culex (Table 1) which
may not be explained simply by purifying selection.
Taken together, the data demonstrated that strong purifying selection is likely not responsible for high sequence
identity between gene paralogues within the same family.
Purifying selection between families Vg1 and Vg2 in genus
Culex

To examine the selection pressure between the two paralogous families Vg1 and Vg2 in Culex species, dN/dS values were calculated between Vg1 and Vg2. All pairwise
comparisons were significantly less than 1 (p < 0.0001, Ztest), indicating that these Vtg sequences are under purifying selection (Table 4). No significant conversion tracts

were detected using GENECONV (data not shown). To
test if positive selection was acting on different regions of
mosquito Vtg genes, we used WSPMaker http://wspmaker.kobic.kr/, a web tool for scanning and calculating
selection pressures in sub-regions of two protein-coding
DNA sequences [26]. No dN/dS ratio was significantly
greater than 1 (data not shown).
Mosaic evolution between paralogues Vg2a and Vg2b in
Culex, and paralogues in An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti and Oc.
atropalpus

We observed that gene conversion events were variable in
the amount of gene sequence involved between mosquito
species. While in some species, almost the entire gene
sequences have undergone concerted evolution, others
had a mosaic pattern of conversion events, where some
segments of the genes are homogenized and evolved in
concert, while others diverged without gene conversion
[27]. We determined that sequence homogenization by
gene conversion occurred in the entire gene sequences of
Culex Vg1 paralogues, while homogenization occurred
only partially in Culex Vg2 paralogues, An. gambiae paralogues, Ae. aegypti paralogues and Oc. atropalpus paralogues (Table 2). The lower number of synonymous
differences per site (Ps) found in paralogues of CpVg2aCpVg2b, CtVg2a-CtVg2b and AgVg1-AgVg3 (ranging from
0.0226-0.0564), suggests that sequence homogenization
was not due to strong purifying selection (Table 3). We
analyzed dN/dS ratios between the unconverted coding
region of the paralogues Vg2a and Vg2b in Culex, and
paralogues in An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti and Oc. atropal-

(Table 5).

Discussion
T37L was accidentally identified during attempts to isolate the 5-prime regulatory region of the Cx. tarsalis Vg1b
gene. We found that T37L was constitutively expressed
throughout mosquito immature and adult development.
Interestingly, of the four Vtg genes in Cx. tarsalis, Vg1b is
also constitutively expressed throughout immature and
mature development, mirroring the expression of T37L
[22]. The fact that this gene arrangement (T37L-short
regulatory region-Vtg) is conserved among mosquitoes
suggests that their functions may be linked in some way.
Experiments are currently ongoing to investigate the
potential functional link between T37L and Vtg expression, possibly mediated by the shared putatively bi-directional promoter.
GENECONV is a computational program for statistically detecting high-scoring aligned pairs in a given align-

ment [28]. It potentially detects both gene conversion and
unequal recombination events (two mechanisms to generate concerted evolution) but can not distinguish
between the two phenomena. Gene conversion is an
event in DNA genetic recombination, where all or part of
one gene is converted to the sequence of a nearby homologous gene in a nonreciprocal transfer of genetic information [29]. Gene conversion is used to explain
concerted evolution between duplicated genes (two copies) without changing copy number [30,31]. Unequal
crossover is a recombination event between misaligned
non-allelic sequences on a pair of homologous chromosomes and usually causes copy-number fluctuation by
deletion or duplication of the gene region [29]. It is often
used to explain concerted evolution within tandemlyarrayed gene families (three or more copies) and always
generates duplicates in the same orientation ("head-totail"). There is no tandem repeat of Vtg genes found in the
genomes of genus Culex, Aedes or Ochlerotatus, suggesting that gene conversion rather than unequal crossover
generated the concerted evolution of Vtg genes in these

mosquito species. In contrast, in An. gambiae unequal
crossover may contribute the concerted evolution of Vtg
genes due to the tandem repeat organization ("head-totail") of the Vtg genes that share high sequence conservation. Different numbers of Vtg tandem copies have been
described between different mosquito strains (An. gambiae G3 strain: 3 copies vs. PEST strain: 7 copies [32],
suggesting unequal crossover may generate Vtg copy
number fluctuations in Anopheles.
In this study, we determined that after arising by duplication events, purifying selection and concerted evolution drive the evolution of mosquito Vtg genes. Similar
patterns have been observed in the Vtg genes of other
invertebrate and vertebrate organisms. Among the six Vtg
genes (Vit-1 to Vit-6) of the nematode Caenorhabditis

elegans, high sequence identity was observed between
Vit-1 and Vit-2 (95% nt identity) and among Vit-3, Vit-4
and Vit-5 (above 96%), while Vit-3 and Vit-4 are located
in tandem on the X chromosome and are nearly identical
to each other in the coding region [33]. Two Vtg genes
located at different loci were identified from the cockroach Leucophaea maderae which shared high similarity
(96% identity at the amino acids level) [34]. In vertebrates,
four Vtg genes have been identified from the frog Xenopus laevis which fall into two pairs that share approximately 95% sequence identity within pairs, while
approximately 65.5% identity between pairs [1]. A
genomic region harboring two Vtg genes that shared
almost 99% sequence identity and that were separated
from each other by a 4.5-kb intergenic region was isolated

from the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss [35]. O.
mykiss also contains a locus containing twenty complete
Vtg genes and ten pseudogenes per haploid genome that
show a high degree of similarity at the sequence level
(97.4%-100%), although these genes differ from each
other by retrotransposon-like sequence insertions, deletions and rearrangement events [36]. Other salmonid
fishes show a similar pattern [37]. Gene conversion has
been suggested as one of the forces driving evolution of
some fish Vtg genes [38], but has not been systematically
examined across diverse taxa. Re-analysis of sequence
data from vertebrates and invertebrates show that concerted evolution and/or purifying selection may be a general property of Vtg gene evolution across highly

divergent taxa [additional file 1, 2]. However, other evolutionary forces can also drive the evolution of Vtg genes.
For example, a tandemly-arrayed Vtg gene cluster (VGC)
has been selectively conserved in most oviparous vertebrate lineages [39,40].
Although both purifying selection and concerted evolution play important roles in maintaining high levels of
sequence conservation, they act by different methods. A
gene under purifying selection can maintain sequence
conservation in protein coding or regulatory regions due
to the functional constraint of selection pressure against
deleterious variants. Concerted evolution is a molecular
process that leads to homogenization of DNA sequences
of duplicated regions within a genome. In yeast, it has

been shown that the level of concerted evolution is positively correlated with gene expression levels, suggesting
that dosage-sensitive genes are likely to favor concerted
evolution [41]. Vtg is an essential component needed for
embryonic development. Increased quantities of egg yolk
may have dramatically beneficial effects on embryo survival. The high identity of Vtg genes maintained by concerted evolution may be beneficial for mosquito
reproduction due to increased expression of this vital
yolk protein.
After duplication, the duplicated gene copy can have
different fates, such as loss of function through pseudogene formation or diversification of gene function
through neofunctionalization [42,43]. It has been
reported that Vtg gene vit-1 in C. elegans and about ten
Vtg genes in rainbow trout were actually pseudogenes
[33,36]. In Cx. tarsalis, all of four Vtg genes are transcriptionally expressed and are not pseudogenes [22]. Vtg
genes may also gain novel functions through alteration of
their transcriptional expression pattern instead of
sequence divergence. In the honeybee, Vtg is expressed in
immature, worker and male castes and is associated with
a variety of social behaviours [44-46]. Vtg proteins also
have important antioxidant activities and prolong
lifespan in honey bee and C. elegans [47,48]. Vtg is also
involved in promoting macrophage phagocytosis in fish
[49]. In Cx. tarsalis, CtVg1b is expressed not only in the
adult female but is constitutively expressed during larval
and pupal developmental stages, while CtVg1a, CtVg2a
and CtVg2b are expressed exclusively in the adult
stage[22] - it remains to be seen if CtVg1b has any alternative function in Cx. tarsalis and whether constitutive
expression is related to the associated CtT37L gene.

Conclusions
After duplication, two major forces drive the evolution of
the vitellogenin (Vtg) gene family in mosquitoes. We
identified the putative ancestral Vtg gene among different
mosquito species by its conserved association with a
novel gene (T37L) approximately one kilobase upstream
of the start codon. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that
the Vtg gene family arose by unique duplication events in
each mosquito genera. Signatures of purifying selection
were detected in Culex, Aedes and Anopheles. Gene conversion is a major driver of concerted evolution in Culex,
while unequal crossover is likely the major driver of concerted evolution in Anopheles. In Aedes, smaller fragments have undergone gene conversion events. These
data, plus reanalysis of Vtg gene sequences from other
organisms suggest that duplication, concerted evolution
and purifying selection may be major evolutionary forces
driving Vtg gene evolution across highly divergent taxa.
Methods

Culex tarsalis were from the KNWR strain, which was
collected in the Kern National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR)
in Kern County, California. Larvae were reared at a standard density of 200 larvae/pan and fed a 1:2:2 blend of
fish food, rabbit pellets and bovine liver extract. Adults
were maintained on 10% sucrose. Mosquitoes were maintained by autogenous oviposition.
Genomic DNA extraction, total RNA extraction and first
strand cDNA synthesis

Genomic DNA was isolated from Cx. tarsalis adults
using the procedure described in Chen and Li [50]. Total

RNA was extracted from female adults using the SV Total
RNA Isolation System Kit (Promega) as described by the
manufacturer. Two micrograms of RNA was used as template for first strand cDNA synthesis to make 3'RACEready cDNA using The SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Clonetech).
Cloning full length vitellogenin genes from Culex tarsalis

To isolate the full Vtg coding sequences, we began by
cloning partial coding sequences. Based on the available
An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens vitellogenin
sequences, two primers (CpVgCoF1: 5'-CCA-AGA-CCATGA-CCG-CCC-TG-3' and CpVgCoR1: 5'-TTT-CCCATT-TGG-TTG-GTG-TTG-GG-3') were designed to
PCR-amplify the coding sequence near the 5' end. The
PCR protocol was 2 min at 94Â°C, followed by 35 cycles
consisting of 94Â°C for 30 s, 50Â°C for 30 s, and 72Â°C for 1
min, and a final 72Â°C extension for 10 min. PCR products

were separated on a 1% agarose gel in 1 Ã TAE buffer.
PCR fragments were cloned into the TOPO TA cloning
vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Two partial vitellogenin gene (Vg1 and Vg2) sequences were identified.
The 5'-flanking sequences were obtained using the
GenomeWalker Universal Kit (Clonetech) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, genomic DNA was
digested by eight blunt-end restriction enzymes (SnaBI,
MscI, SmaI, ScaI, EcorV, Dra, PvuII, Stu I), and then
adaptor-ligated on both ends. Use adaptor and gene-specific primers, we amplified the 5' flanking regions. Two
gene-specific primers were designed for each gene. Vg1:
Vg1GSP1
(5'-CTC-CCT-CCA-GAT-GTT-GGT-ACGGTA-TCC-3') and Vg1GSP2 (5'-TCG-TTG-AAG-TTGGCG-TAC-TCG-GCT-TGC-3'); Vg2: Vg2GSP1 (5'-AAGTCC-GTG-CGG-TGA-CCA-TCG-TCC-AGA-3');
Vg2GSP2 (5'-ATA-CTG-GTT-GAA-CTG-AGC-GTATTG-AGC-3'). The nested PCR protocol was 2 min at

Chen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:142

94Â°C, followed by 20 cycles consisting of 94Â°C for 30 s,
67Â°C for 4 min, and a final 72Â°C extension for 10 min; the
second PCR reaction was identical except that cycles
were increased to 30 and used 1 Î¼l 50Ã dilution of the
first PCR product as template. A 10:1 mix of Taq and pfu
DNA polymerase was used for all reactions. PCR fragments were TOPO cloned and sequenced as described
above.
3'Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE)
approach was used to isolate the 3' end of the Vtg genes.
Two forward gene-specific primers were designed for
each Vtg gene for nested 3'RACE PCR on the basis of 3'
coding sequence of the Cx. pipiens Vtg genes. Vg1:
CpVg13F1 (5'-ACT-TCC-AGA-ACG-CTG-ACA-CC-3')
and CpVg13F2 (5'-TCA-AGA-ACG-GAT-TCA-GCGAG-3'); Vg2: CpVg23F1 (5'-GAG-AAC-AAC-CAG-CAGCAC-CT-3') and CpVg23F2 (5'-ATT-GTG-CCG-AACGGT-GCT-CA-3'). The nested PCR protocol was 2 min
at 94Â°C, followed by 20 cycles consisting of 94Â°C for 30 s,
52Â°C for 30 s and 72Â°C for 90 s, and a final 72Â°C extension
for 10 min; the second PCR reaction was identical except
that cycles were increased to 30 and used 1 Î¼l 50Ã diluted
PCR product as template. PCR fragments were TOPO
cloned and sequenced as described above.
Finally, we designed four pairs of gene-specific primers
to amplify the four full length Vtg genes, in which forward primers and reverse primers were located in 5' promoter region and 3'UTR region, respectively. Vg1a:
Vg1aPF (5'-GAA-CCC-ACC-GAT-TGT-TTA-CG-3') and
Vg1aSPR (5'-ATG-CCT-TTG-TAA-ACA-GTT-CC-3');
Vg1b: Vg1bPF (5'-TGG-TGT-TGC-TCT-CAG-ACT-TG3') and Vg1bSPR (5'-CCA-AAT-TCA-TTG-CTT-TCCGA-3'); - Vg2a: Vg2aPF (5'-TCA-ACA-ACC-ATC-CCTTCA-CA-3') and Vg2aSPR (5'-TCC-GTT-ACA-ACCATC-TAG-AG-3'); Vg2b: Vg2bPF (5'-AAA-GCA-GCCTCA-AGC-AAT-CG-3') and Vg2bSPR (5'-GGC-AGTTGT-ATC-TTC-CAA-GG-3'). The PCR protocol was 2
min at 94Â°C, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94Â°C for
30 s, 50Â°C for 30 s, and 72Â°C for 4 min 30 sec, and a final
72Â°C extension for 10 min. PCR products were cloned
and sequenced as described above. The four new isolated
Vtg genes from Cx. tarsalis have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers GU017909-GU017912.
Temporal expression of the TRIM37-like protein (CtT37L)
gene in Cx. tarsalis

While isolating the 5'-promoter region of the CtVg1b
gene, we identified a novel gene (CtT37L - see results)
805 bp upstream of the CtVg1b start codon, in the opposite orientation. We determined the expression profile of
CtT37L in Cx. tarsalis by reverse transcriptase PCR.

vae, pupae (male and female), 24-hour old male adults,
and female adults 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-emergence. The experiment was replicated 3 times. RNA was
extracted from 5 pooled individuals except in the case of
first instar larvae where 10 individuals were pooled. Isolated RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion) to eliminate
residual DNA contamination. cDNA was generated using
1 Î¼g of DNase-treated RNA for reverse transcription
using the Superscript RT for PCR kit (Invitrogen) in 20 Î¼l
volumes with Oligo(dT)20 primers. No-RT controls were
run for each sample. For RT-PCR 2 Î¼l of cDNA was used
as a template for amplification with following primers (5'3'): CtTF109F: CTT-TTG-GTC-CAC-GAA-GTG-GT;
CtTF561R: GCT-TTG-AAG-GAC-AGC-GTT-TC. Control actin primers were: actin1F: ATG-TTT-GAG-ACCTTC-AAC-TCG-C, actin1R: TAA-CCT-TCR-TAG-ATTGGG-ACG. PCR conditions were 94Â°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of: 94Â°C for 30 sec, 50Â°C for 30 sec,
72Â°C for 30 sec, followed by a final extension of 72Â°C for
10 min. Amplicons were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Data mining, sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis

The complete Vtg genes were identified by from the available An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti and Cx. pipiens genome
sequences, and GENBANK sequence data from Ae. polynesiensis, An. stephensi, An. albimanus and Ochlerotatus
atropalpus. Sequence analysis was performed using Blast
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ against a non-redundant database. Initial alignments were performed on
amino acid sequences using Vector NTI advance 10
(Invitrogen) followed by inference of the nucleotide alignment. Phylogenetic analysis of mosquito Vtg genes was
conducted on the amino acid alignment using Maximum
Likelihood (ML), Bayesian (B) and neighbour-joining
(NJ) algorithms. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MrBayes v 3.1.2 [51]. The WAG model of
amino acid substitution was selected as the most appropriate using the MCMC sampler to test all fixed rate
matrices. The rate variation over sites followed a gamma
distribution with a proportion of invariant sites; these
parameters were estimated from the data by MrBayes.
Analyses were run for 500,000 generations, sampling
every 100 generations. The first 25% of generated trees
were considered the burnin and discarded. We constructed a 50% majority-rule consensus tree from the
remaining trees. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic
analysis was conducted using PHYML [52] with the same
parameters estimated for Bayesian analyses. Tree robustness was determined with 100 bootstrap replications.
Neighbor-joining analyses were conducted using MEGA
v.3.1 [53] with 1000 bootstrap replications.

Detection of gene conversion events

Vtg gene nucleotide alignments were generated as
described above. GENECONV was used to detect gene
conversion events. Global p-values were calculated based
on 1000 permutations of the original data using a
BLAST-like search algorithm [28].
Purifying selection tests and Ps,PN calculation

Analyses were conducted using MEGA v.3.1 [53]. Pairwise dN/dS ratios and significance values were calculated
using the Nei-Gojobori method with a Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple hits. Standard errors were calculated
by 1000 bootstrap replications.
