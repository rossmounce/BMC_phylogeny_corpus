Abstract
Background: The HIV pandemic disseminated globally from Central West Africa, beginning in the second half of the
twentieth century. To elucidate the virologic origins of the pandemic, a cross-sectional study was conducted of the
genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains in villagers in 14 remote locations in Cameroon and in hospitalized and STI patients.
DNA extracted from PBMC was PCR amplified from HIV(+) subjects. Partial pol amplicons (N = 164) and nearly full virus
genomes (N = 78) were sequenced. Among the 3956 rural villagers studied, the prevalence of HIV infection was 4.9%;
among the hospitalized and clinic patients, it was 8.6%.
Results: Virus genotypes fell into two distinctive groups. A majority of the genotyped strains (109/164) were the
circulating recombinant form (CRF) known to be endemic in West Africa and Central West Africa, CRF02_AG. The
second most common genetic form (9/164) was the recently described CRF22_01A1, and the rest were a collection of
4 different subtypes (A2, D, F2, G) and 6 different CRFs (-01, -11, -13, -18, -25, -37). Remarkably, 10.4% of HIV-1 genomes
detected (17/164) were heretofore undescribed unique recombinant forms (URF) present in only a single person.
Nearly full genome sequencing was completed for 78 of the viruses of interest. HIV genetic diversity was
commonplace in rural villages: 12 villages each had at least one newly detected URF, and 9 villages had two or more.
Conclusions: These results show that while CRF02_AG dominated the HIV strains in the rural villages, the remainder of
the viruses had tremendous genetic diversity. Between the trans-species transmission of SIVcpz and the dispersal of
pandemic HIV-1, there was a time when we hypothesize that nascent HIV-1 was spreading, but only to a limited extent,
recombining with other local HIV-1, creating a large variety of recombinants. When one of those recombinants began
to spread widely (i.e. became epidemic), it was recognized as a subtype. We hypothesize that the viruses in these
remote Cameroon villages may represent that pre-epidemic stage of viral evolution.
Background
The geographic location of the origin of the HIV-1 pandemic is Central West Africa, where cross-species transmission of SIVcpz occurred from chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes troglodytes) to human [1-3]. From that transmission event the virus adapted into group M HIV-1 and
gradually spread throughout the world. The genetic
forms of HIV-1 currently present in Central West Africa,

early events.
Characterization of HIV-1 genetic diversity in different
regions of the world is a challenging, on-going effort.
Phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences have revealed

repeatedly studied; there have been at least 8 scientific
reports of the genetic subtypes in Cameroon since 2005
[4-12]. The reason for this intense interest is that the HIV
epidemic in Cameroon presents a paradoxical picture: the
prevalence of infection is not high by African standards
(<10% in rural areas), yet the genetic diversity, including
multiple recombinants of complex structure, is extremely
high. While all of these studies have reported CRF02_AG
as the most prevalent single genetic form in circulation,
with estimates ranging from 45% to 61%, the remaining
strains have consisted of an array of other genetic forms,
both classifiable and not [4-13]. Because of this genetic
diversity, partial genome sequencing of relatively small
sample sets has hampered the description of the epidemic fully. This report presents the genetic subtypes of
more strains from rural Cameroon than have previously
been reported, using nearly full genome sequencing to
more completely describe the many unique recombinant
forms (URF).

Results
Partial Pol Analysis

There were 164 HIV-1 strains characterized by partial pol
sequencing out of a possible 178. Most of the strains {126
(76.8%)} were collected from 14 rural villages, where the
prevalence of infection ranged from 1.9% to 7.5%, though
there was one site with a prevalence of 16.3%. The geographic location of the study sites, identified by 2-letter
code, is shown in Figure 1. In addition to samples from
the rural villages, 26 strains from STI out-patients or general medicine in-patients were characterized, among
whom the prevalence of infection was 8.6%. Finally, 12
strains were examined from discarded blood units from
the blood bank in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon. No
non-group M strains were found.
Phylogenetic analysis of the partial pol sequences
showed that the majority (66.5%) clustered with
CRF02_AG (Figure 2, panels A/B). Bootstrap analysis of
the clusters was performed after the exclusion of URF,
and significant bootstrap support (>70%) was present for
the strains highlighted in the figure. The next most common genetic form, present in 5.5% of the strains, was
CRF22_01A1. This CRF is a recombinant between subsubtype A1 and CRF01_AE. Like CRF01_AE,
CRF22_A101 is sub-subtype A1 in the pol region of the
genome, but each of the CRFs (-01 and -22) form separate
clusters within sub-subtype A1 that are distinct from
each other, reflecting the different A1 strains that were
parental to the different CRFs (Figure 2A). In addition,
there were 10 more genetic forms identified: subtypes D
and G, sub-subtypes A2 and F2 plus CRFs -01, -11, -13, 18, -25 and -37. About ten percent of the strains, however, could only be described as a wide variety of unique
recombinant forms (URF). On the phylogenetic tree, they

Page 2 of 8

are scattered throughout the tree, reflecting their varied
structure (Figure 2A). In addition to the subtypes and
CRF listed already, these recombinants included those
having regions from subtypes C, H and CRF09_cpx as
well as regions that were unclassifiable.
The prevalence of the various genetic forms in the different rural sites is displayed in Figure 3, along with the
overall prevalence at the site. The prevalence in the rural
villages ranged from 2% to 16%, and the proportion of the
strains that were URF ranged from 0% to 44%. Two sites
(ND and BA) had no URFs, while others had 3 or more
different ones (NG, LE, NJ and KO). There was no correlation, positive or negative, between the prevalence of
infection and the proportion that were URF.
Nearly Full Genome Analysis

Full genome analysis of a subset of the CRF02_AG strains
and most of the non-CRF02_AG strains was performed.
There were 78 full genomes completed in all, and of these
23 were URF. The diversity of forms is tremendous, even
when the prevalence of infection is low (Figure 4). Diagrams of the subtype structure of the 23 URF that were
sequenced in full for this study show that more than 10
different subtypes or CRF are included in the strains, plus
regions that are impossible to classify (Figure 4). Presumably some of those regions are either new subtypes or
CRF that have not yet been identified. One of the most
striking of the sites is Lomie, where the prevalence is 4.6%
but there were 3 different unrelated URF containing 7 different parental strains between the 3 of them; even a
passing glance can detect the lack of relatedness between
the different URF from that site. At only one site (NG)
were there two complex URFs with the same structure,
suggesting transmission linkage. Demographic information suggested that they were married, over 50 years of
age, and self-described as monogamous.
Significant hypermutation was observed in 14.1% of the
full genomes, and another 16.7% were otherwise defective. Most of the hypermutated strains were classified
using Hypermut http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/[14], but a few
were only partially hypermutated and were discovered by
the characteristic G-to-A mutations. From the context of
the hypermutations, APOBEC3G is the likely enzyme
responsible. In one case, a hypermutated strain also had a
36 aa deletion in the vif gene, suggesting that, for that
individual, APOBEC3G was unimpeded by vif. A little
over half of the hypermutated strains were URF (6/11,
54.5%), while the rest were both CRF02_AG and the other
genetic forms; the URFs, therefore, had a higher rate of
hypermutation than the subtypes or CRFs. In addition to
11 hypermutated strains, there were 13 strains with major
defects likely to make them functionally dead. Most were
frame shift mutations leading to stop codons, but there
were 3 strains that had large insertions/duplications in

the nef gene. The sizes of the insertions or duplications
were 17 aa, 40 aa and 75 aa, respectively. Defective
genomes were not more prevalent in URFs than other
genetic forms.

Discussion
While genetic diversity in Cameroon has been described
frequently in the literature, this report documents the
high degree of genetic diversity using nearly full genome
sequencing of samples from very rural sites in Cameroon.
The prevalence of infection was relatively low by African
standards (4.9%), and CRF02_AG was the predominant
strain (66.5%), but about a third of the remaining HIV-1
genotypes detected (57/164) were confined to only one or
at most a few persons. As others have shown, Central
West Africa is the most likely geographical location for
the origin for the HIV-1 pandemic [1-3]. However, counter-intuitively, the prevalence of infection there is lower
than the newer epidemics to the east, west and south [15].

We hypothesize that the low prevalence is a reflection of
lower transmissibility of HIV in these populations. Even
in villages with a large number of unique recombinant
forms (URF) such as LE, recombinants not only varied in
structure but also in the parental strains involved. Only in
one village were there 2 URFs with identical structures,
probably sex linked; and the two major parental strains
for that recombinant (CRF09_cpx, subtype H) were not
even found in the population. Viral loads for these samples revealed no correlation between genetic form
(CRF02_AG vs URF, for example) and level of circulating
virus (data not shown), but there was a distinct lack of
genetically related transmission pairs among the URF
from the same village.
A low rate of transmissibility may explain the low prevalence, but it is very difficult to then account for the presence of recombinants with 4 or 5 different subtypes in
one strain. Inter-subtype recombinants are generally the
result of super-infection with different subtypes and are

most commonly seen in populations with heavy exposure
to multiple subtypes [16,17]. There are multiple subtypes
in this population, but at a fairly low level. The hospitalized patients and STD clinic attendees would be expected
to have the most risk, and the prevalence of infection
among them was significantly elevated compared to the
rural villages, but the rate of URFs among them was even
lower than in subjects from the rural sites. Recent
research among subjects in the capital, Yaounde, found
that 16% of the subjects were dually infected with either 2
different subtypes or different strains from one subtype
[9]. As with the subjects in this study, they were low risk.
Further study in these populations is needed in order to
discover what the mechanism behind this observation
might be.
A theoretical model to display one hypothesis is shown
in Figure 5, an adaptation from Kalish et al., 2004 [18].
What is known about the origins of HIV put the date of
transmission from chimpanzee to human between 18841924, the center of the figure [19]. We hypothesize that

the original transmission was probably suboptimal in
terms of replication in the human host and that the virus
recombined extensively in its 'search' for the right combination of genetic factors. In the figure, this period of time
is represented by multiple wavy lines. By 1960 in Kinshasa, there were two identifiable subtypes, or variants
capable of epidemic spread, subtype A and subtype B/D
[19,20]. They were designated as 'pure' subtypes because
they were epidemically successful, even though they
undoubtedly emerged from a long process of repeated
recombination. In most countries in the world, subtypes
have been introduced, and in some cases these have
recombined to make circulating recombinant forms that
are clearly descendants of those subtypes. The situation
in Central West Africa is dramatically different from that
picture, and we hypothesize that the reason for this is that
the viruses still in circulation in rural areas of Cameroon
resemble the pre-epidemic viruses, and that they are, in a
sense, evolutionary relics.

Conclusions
The genetic complexity of HIV strains from rural Cameroon defies both logic and experience. Multiply recombinant viruses are found in subjects who have a high risk of
superinfection with different strains of HIV, such as commercial sex workers or injecting drug users. The village
populations in this study, on the contrary, have a low risk
of infection as captured by the prevalence, but harbor
viruses having 3 or 4 different parental strains. Among
the 78 viruses sequenced in full, there were at least 13 different subtypes, sub-subtypes or CRF represented. It is
hypothesized that that this diversity may be due to remnants of the viruses predating the epidemic in 1960.
Methods
Subjects

Of the 17 village sites in Cameroon that were selected for
this study, 14 were used for the genetic analysis, shown in
Figure 1. In a study approved by the IRB of Johns Hopkins
University, participants were healthy adults who gave
consent to participate, most of them subsistence farmers
and hunters [21]. In addition, in-patients at two district
hospitals (Ndikinimeki, Lomie) and outpatients at STI

clinics in those same locations were enrolled in the study.
Finally, HIV-positive blood was collected from the central
blood bank in Yaounde, Cameroon, to monitor genotypes
among blood donors. Blood was drawn and plasma and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated using CPT blood collection tubes (BD, Inc, Franklin
City, NJ). The plasma was tested for HIV antibodies by
Ortho HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody capture ELISA (OrthoClinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY) and reactive samples
were confirmed by two Western Blots (HIV Blot 2.2,
Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore and Calypte, Cambridge
Biotech, Cambridge, MA). Those confirmed positive on
both were used for viral load determination and DNA
extraction. Viral load was measured using the Roche
Amplicor HIV-1 monitor test, v. 1.5 (Roche Molecular
Systems, Branchburg, NJ). High molecular weight DNA
was extracted from the PBMC using QIAmp DNA
extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
PCR Amplification

The DNA from PBMC was amplified by nested PCR in
the pol gene producing a 1.1 kb fragment spanning protease and part of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene [22].

Pro5F (5'-AGAAATTGCAGGGCCCCTAGGAA) and
RT3474R (5'-GAATCTCTCTGTTTTCTGCCAG). The
second round reaction was with Pro3F (5'-AGANCAGAGCCAACAGCCCCACCA and ProRT (5'-TTTCCCCACTAACTTCTGTATGTCATTGACA).
The
cycling conditions were the same except that the annealing temperature was 58Â°C and there were only 30 cycles.
Virtually full-length genomes of HIV-1 were amplified
from selected strains based on the results of partial pol
sequencing. Limiting template dilution into the first
round was performed to decrease the complexity of the
sample and allow for direct sequencing of the second
round PCR product. The virtually full-length genome
was amplified using MSF12b (5'-AAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAG) and OFMR1 (5'-TGAGGGATCTCTAGTTACCAGAGTC), followed by F2nst (5'GCGGAGGCTAGAAGGAGAGAGATGG) and ofm19
(5'-GCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTA).
PCR was performed as described [23,24], using the
Expand Long Template kit (Boehringer-Mannheim) and a
hot-start method with a melting wax barrier (Dynawax).
Cycling conditions were: 94Â° for 2 min, then 10 cycles of
94Â°C for 10 s, 60Â°C for 30 s and 68Â°C for 8 min. This was
followed by 20 cycles where the annealing temperature
was 55Â°C. The final extension step was 68Â°C for 10 min.

Multiple second round PCR amplifications were combined to provide sufficient template for sequencing.
DNA sequencing

Template DNA for automated sequencing was prepared
as described previously [23]. PCR amplification products
of the pol gene and the nearly full-length strains were
fully sequenced on both strands by using fluorescent dye
terminators and an Applied BioSystems (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) Model 3100 DNA sequencer.
DNA sequences were assembled using Sequencher software (Genecodes Inc., Ann Arbor MI) on Macintosh
computers. All sequences had at least 2 clear readings in
each direction for completion.
Analysis

A multiple alignment of the Cameroon sequences with
selected HIV-1 reference sequences was constructed
using MacGDE 1.9.5, software based on Genetic Data
Environment (GDE) adapted for Mac OS X [25,26]. Gaps
that were introduced to create the alignment were eliminated in the final analysis. Reference isolates from the different subtypes and circulating recombinant forms from
the pandemic, described in the National HIV Database at
Los Alamos, NM, were used to classify the Cameroon
sequences http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the neighbor-joining method and
the consistency of branching order was evaluated using
bootstrap analysis by MEGA3 software [27]. Genetic relationships can be obscured by the presence of recombinant or novel forms in the analysis of HIV-1 strains. To
address this, phylogenetic trees were constructed that
included only a few aberrant viral sequences at a time.
Hypermutated sequences were identified using Hypermut 2.0 software from the National HIV Database http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/ and were deleted from appropriate
analyses [14].
Recombinant analysis was done with bootscanning [28]
and distance scanning [23] using SimPlot software, version 3.5[29]. The nucleotide positions of recombinant
breakpoints were designated relative to HXB-2 (GenBank
Accession No: K03455). The significance of the breakpoint assignment was assessed by the bootstrap value of
the relevant node in the phylogenetic tree, which was
>70% for significance.

length genomic sequences are available under GenBank
