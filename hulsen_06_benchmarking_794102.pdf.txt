duplication event [1]. Orthologous genes are more likely to
have a functional similarity than paralogous genes, which
have often undergone changes in substrate or ligand specificity [2,3]. The high level of functional conservation between
orthologous proteins makes orthology highly relevant for
protein function prediction. It is also widely used in genome

Orthology is one of the central concepts of comparative
genome analysis, but is often misused as a description of
functionally equivalent genes in different species. By definition, the term describes the evolutionary relationship
between homologous genes whose independent evolution
reflects a speciation event, whereas paralogy refers to genes

Conclusion: By combining the sensitivity and the selectivity into an overall score, we show that
the InParanoid program is the best ortholog identification method in terms of identifying
functionally equivalent proteins.

refereed research

Results: To measure the similarity in function of proteins from different species we used functional
genomics data, such as expression data and protein interaction data. We tested several of the most
popular ortholog identification methods. In general, we observed a sensitivity/selectivity trade-off:
the functional similarity scores per orthologous pair of sequences become higher when the number
of proteins included in the ortholog groups decreases.

deposited research

Background: The transfer of functional annotations from model organism proteins to human
proteins is one of the main applications of comparative genomics. Various methods are used to
analyze cross-species orthologous relationships according to an operational definition of orthology.
Often the definition of orthology is incorrectly interpreted as a prediction of proteins that are
functionally equivalent across species, while in fact it only defines the existence of a common
ancestor for a gene in different species. However, it has been demonstrated that orthologs often
reveal significant functional similarity. Therefore, the quality of the orthology prediction is an
important factor in the transfer of functional annotations (and other related information). To
identify protein pairs with the highest possible functional similarity, it is important to qualify
ortholog identification methods.

analysis, where the information about a protein in one species
is used for the functional annotation of the orthologous protein in another species. At the level of protein-protein interactions, for example, it allows networks of orthologous
sequences to be investigated to detect conservation of processes and pathways.
So far, the genomes from more than 200 organisms have been
fully sequenced. Of particular interest for medical research
are the full genome sequences of human and model organisms, such as fruit fly, worm, mouse, rat, and chicken.
Genome sequencing projects on other model organisms, such
as the chimpanzee [4], are also close to completion. Identification of orthologous relationships between these model
organisms and human allows the functional annotation of a
model organism protein to be transferred to its human
ortholog.
Given the large amount of data, automated determination of
orthology relations is an absolute requirement for an optimal
knowledge transfer between the proteins and pathways from
different species. Several ortholog identification methods
have been described that use sequence comparisons, for
example, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) [5], InParanoid [6] and OrthoMCL [7]. One of the most striking differences between the various methods and databases is the level
of inclusiveness: the number of proteins from one species that
is considered to be part of the same orthologous group. For
the best bidirectional hit (BBH) method this number is one,
except for theoretical cases where two proteins from species
A have the same score to a protein from species B or when one
considers fusion or fission of genes [8]. In the euKaryotic
Orthologous Groups (KOG) database [9], this number can
easily become larger than 100 proteins, for example, for
trypsin (KOG3627) in Homo sapiens. The reasons for this difference in inclusiveness are twofold. Firstly, there are differences between the algorithms being employed, such as
bidirectional best hits, the triangular best-bidirectional hits
scheme of the COGs [5], the graph-clustering program
OrthoMCL [7], the sequence similarity based InParanoid [6],
or a phylogenetic tree algorithm [10]. Secondly, some databases include a wider phylogenetic array of species than others. To give one example, the KOG database [9] aims to
include all sequenced eukaryotes. In such a situation, genes
resulting from relatively recent gene duplications, like those
in the lineage leading to the mammals, will all be part of the
same orthologous group. In a database that includes only the
mammals, for example, a version of InParanoid that compares mouse and human, these genes will likely be split into
different orthologous groups. Comparing only recently
diverged species, therefore, allows one to obtain a higher level
of evolutionary, and possibly also functional, resolution.
The various published orthology identification methods have
led to the recognition that it would be useful to compare these
algorithms and use the consistency in the predicted ortholo-

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/4/R31

gous relations as a measure of reliability [11]. Additionally,
several procedures have been proposed to test the reliability
of orthology prediction from a single method [6,12]. It has
even been proposed that one could actually use functional
genomics data to assess the reliability of orthology prediction
algorithms to predict functional equivalent genes [13]. However, consistency in the prediction is no measure of statistical
or biological significance and the comparison of several
ortholog identification methods using functional genomics
data is, to the best of our knowledge, a complete new
approach to the problem. Here we define and follow a strategy
to test the quality of several currently used ortholog identification methods to identify functionally equivalent proteins.
Unfortunately, there is no 'gold standard' of protein function
that can be used to benchmark ortholog identification methods, as experimentally determined functions are only known
for a very small fraction of the proteins in the sequenced
genomes. Hence, assessing the quality of different methods
currently used is not a straightforward exercise. In our strategy, we use the assumption that functionally equivalent
orthologs should behave similarly in functional genomics
data [14]. This aspect of conservation of function can be
measured in several ways: by similar expression profiles (tissue distribution or regulation), conservation of co-expression, identical domain annotation, conservation of proteinprotein interaction or involvement in similar processes (pathways). All of these properties are used here to benchmark the
quality of several commonly used ortholog identification
methods. The outcome of this benchmark will be useful for
determining which ortholog identification method should be
used to identify orthologous relationships. Moreover, it gives
an idea of which methods are good at predicting different
kinds of functional conservation. Some methods appear to be
good at predicting conservation of co-expression, while others more accurately predict the conservation of the molecular
function. Which ortholog identification method one should
use depends on the kind of functional annotation that is to be
transferred from one protein to the other. Here we show some
examples of the differences between the various kinds of
functional conservation in relation to the type of ortholog
identification. As a start for building a 'gold standard' of protein function, we also included a comparison with a reference
set of 'true orthologs' consisting of five well-studied protein
families.

Results
Direct conservation of functional parameters
First, we measured the conservation of functional parameters
between orthologous proteins, examining direct correspondence between human and mouse/worm proteins (Figures 1
and 2). This conservation was measured by comparing the
expression profiles that provide information about the functional context of a protein (Figure 1) and the InterPro accession numbers, which provide information about the
molecular function of a protein (Figure 2). We determined the

2). The ortholog identification methods that create the most
orthologous relationships have a larger fraction of equal
InterPro accession numbers than the others. The many-tomany non-group methods PhyloGenetic Tree (PGT) and Z 1
Hundred (Z1H) show particularly good scores. Note that
these methods use a Smith-Waterman calculation in combination with a Z-value threshold (Monte-Carlo statistics) to
define the orthologous relationships (Z ≥ 20 with some additional steps for PGT, Z ≥ 100 for Z1H), whereas the methods
with the lower scores, INP, KOG and MCL, use BLAST in
combination with E-value statistics.

information

We examined three other methods for orthology prediction
benchmarking. In these benchmarks, rather than comparing
one-to-one functional correspondence between human and
mouse/worm proteins, we compared the correspondence of
the relationship between two proteins in human with the relationship between their two orthologs in mouse/worm. In this
article, we refer to these methods as 'pairwise conservation of
functional parameters' (Figures 3, 4 and 5). This functional
conservation between two human proteins and two mouse/
worm proteins is measured by comparing the co-expression
levels (Figure 3), the neighboring relationships (Figure 4) and
the protein-protein interactions (Figure 5) between these two

benchmarked methods (Figure 1). Note that only proteins for
which gene expression data exist are included in this analysis.
This is shown by the lower average proteome sizes in, especially, the human-worm analysis, for which it was difficult to
map the expression data to the Protein World data. For the
human-mouse analysis, this was less difficult. For the three
group orthology methods, InParanoid (INP), KOG and
OrthoMCL (MCL), a second calculation method was used,
which only takes into account the best scoring pair within a
group. An examination of only the average correlation shows
that the KOG best scoring pair (KOGB) human-mouse set,
containing the best scoring human-mouse pair of each KOG,
seems to have the highest conservation of function. However,
this set has the lowest average proteome size for humanmouse, thus combining a high selectivity with a low sensitivity. If orthology relationships between a larger number of proteins are required, the MCL and MCL best scoring pair
(MCLB) sets are good alternatives. Finally, the large standard
deviations are a reason to be careful with the interpretation of
these results. We do not have this statistical issue when exam-

species. As described in some recent papers [9,15], the evolutionary conservation of co-expression can be used for function prediction. Here it is used to test which of the ortholog
sets can be used to best improve the function prediction,
using the Gene Ontology (GO) database [16]. According to our
first pairwise benchmark (Figure 3), the PGT approach is the
best method in the human-mouse analysis, having the highest
fraction of equal 4th level GO biological process and the
third/fourth largest average proteome. Z1H is the second best
method when using conservation of co-expression as a benchmark, having both the second highest sensitivity and the second highest selectivity. The second benchmark, the
conservation of gene order, gives completely different results
(Figure 4): the BBH, INP and MCL methods have the best
scores. The three methods with a relatively large average proteome size (PGT, Z1H and KOG) have exceptionally low
scores here: all have a fraction of conserved gene order below
0.02. For the conservation of protein-protein interaction
(Figure 5), the smallest set of all, BBH, has the best score.
However, the INP and MCL sets have the best score when
both the fraction of conserved protein-protein interaction
and the average proteome size are taken into account.
Although not as dramatically low as the fractions of conserved

gene order, the fractions of conserved protein-protein interaction are still quite low for the three methods with the largest
average proteome size.

Overall results
From the independent results it is difficult to draw a conclusion on which method is best. We therefore determined an
overall benchmark of the ortholog identification methods,
which are calculated by multiplying the function similarity
scores by the average proteome size (Table 1). Subsequently,
the five resulting scores are combined into one overall score
by multiplying them. Each benchmark has its own ranking,
on a scale from 1 to 6, and an overall ranking according to the
overall score. The overall scores and the overall ranking show
that BBH and INP score best, closely followed by MCL. If we
combine the several benchmarks into an overall score in a different way, by normalizing all benchmarking scores first
(putting the lowest score at 0 and the highest score at 100)
and then adding them up, the results are approximately the
same (Figure 6a for human-mouse). Again, the BBH and INP
methods have the best score, followed by the PGT and MCL
methods. KOG has a very low overall score. PGT has both a
higher score and a larger average proteome size than MCL.
The human-worm analysis (Figure 6b) shows that the sensitivity/selectivity trade-off is less visible here. The INP

The human-mouse Hox cluster proteins are covered best by
the PGT method: 33 out of 41 orthologous pairs are detected.
The KOG method is the second best with 30 orthologous
pairs, and InParanoid is third best with 28 pairs. The other
three methods all find the same 26 pairs. However, the KOG
and PGT methods also have a high number of false positives.

We included in our study a 'true ortholog' reference set, consisting of five well-studied protein families: the Hox cluster
proteins and hemoglobins (human-mouse), the nuclear
receptors and toll-like receptors (human-worm), and the Sm
and Sm-like proteins (human-mouse plus human-worm).

has only the second highest score. These results might be
influenced, however, by the lower reliability of the humanworm expression data. When combining the results from Figure 6a and 6b, we can conclude that the InParanoid algorithm
is the best ortholog identification method.

We have tested the quality of a number of ortholog identification methods for protein function prediction by comparing
functional genomics data from each of the proteins in a pair
identified as orthologs. Orthologs should, in general, have a
higher level of function conservation than paralogs. The
results show that, in general, the less inclusive the method,
the better it performs in terms of function similarity; in other
words, there is a certain trade-off between sensitivity and
selectivity. We correct for this by taking the function similarity score and multiplying it by the geometric average of the
number of unique human proteins and the number of unique
mouse/worm proteins within the ortholog set that is being
studied (the 'average proteome size'). After multiplying these
scores to obtain an overall score (giving each benchmark the
same weight), we generate an overall ranking that gives equal
weight to both the five different benchmarks and the sensitivity and selectivity. From the results, we conclude that the
InParanoid method is the best ortholog identification
method. However, some caution should be taken with the
overall ranking system. First, the average proteome size now
has the same weight as the function similarity score, while
one of them might be considered more important than the
other. We examined the effect of different weights for these
two parameters (1:2 and 2:1 proportions) but did not find any
large differences in the results. Second, some benchmarks
may produce better results than others, which might be a reason to give different weights to the several benchmarks when
combining them into an overall score. For example, the
benchmark that uses GO annotations could be less reliable
because some of these annotations are actually based on
sequence similarity themselves. Third, recent research [17]
suggests that the expression levels of physically interacting
proteins coevolve. This indicates a strong connection between
the third and the fifth benchmark in this study, which could

As for the human-worm nuclear receptors, the KOG method
has the highest number of orthologous pairs. However, KOG
has an extremely high number of false positives. When the
numbers of orthologous pairs are divided by the average proteome size, the MCL method has the best performance. The
Toll-like receptor family, which has only one member in
Caenorhabditis elegans shows good results for KOG as well,
together with the PGT method. For the Sm and Sm-like protein family, the MCL and INP methods have the highest

orthologous pairs are almost all detected by the Z1H method.
The orthologous pairs/average proteome size ratios of the six
different methods do not differ much for this family, which
means that the number of detected pairs is proportional to
the inclusiveness of the ortholog identification method. PGT
and BBH have the best scores when looking at Sm and Smlike proteins.

be a reason to leave out one of them. However, coexpression
can be the result of processes other than physical interaction
only. The differences in the results we got from the two benchmarks also contributed to our decision not to exclude either
one of them. Finally, it should be noted that the data we used
in our human-mouse analysis was, in general, of higher quality than the data we used in our human-worm analysis. This
applies especially to the gene expression data: for the humanmouse set we could use the SNOMED tissue classification,
whereas for the human-worm set we found it quite hard to
map the tissue samples to each other. The small numbers that
were generated in the human-worm analysis also makes this
analysis statistically less reliable than the human-mouse
analysis.
The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that the
method that should be used to identify orthologs is in fact
dependent on the research question one wants to answer
using the orthologous relationships. For example, if the goal
is to have one or more orthologs for a large number of proteins, one of the methods that allow many-to-many relationships (like InParanoid) should be applied. If selectivity
(having as few as possible false positives) is more important
than sensitivity (having as many as possible true positives)
and having only one ortholog per protein is sufficient, the best
bidirectional hit approach should give the best results.
Although methods that include phylogenetic inferences to
determine phylogenies should, in principle, be the best at
establishing orthologous relationships, in practice they suffer

from a number of drawbacks that methods solely based on
pairwise identities do not have. It is commonplace, for example, to require positions in a sequence alignment to be present
in all or most of the sequences in order to use them for deriving a phylogeny with ClustalW. Such requirements drastically
reduce the amount of information that can be used to determine orthology relationships. In the absence of easily implementable solutions to this, computational shortcuts like
InParanoid give, in our analysis, better results.
Finally, results could differ when different statistical significance scores (unpublished data), scoring matrices, gap penalties, and so on are used for the various alignment algorithms.
We tried to minimize the effect of these parameters as much
as possible by using the defaults of the several programs, but
some programs might still be more suitable for identifying
close orthologous relationships than others, while these others might be more appropriate for the identification of distant
relationships. The differences observed between our humanmouse (closely related species) and human-worm (distantly
related species) analyses support this statement. As for the
human-worm analysis, the conservation of functional characteristics and gene order is significantly lower than in humanmouse. The latter is not surprising because millions of years
of chromosomal rearrangements during evolution have
changed the chromosomal organization significantly. As for
the functional aspects, we can conclude that they have been
poorly conserved whereas the protein domain organization
has been well conserved.

Ortholog identification method Hs-Ce
(average proteome size)

Best bidirectional hit
The 'best bidirectional hit' (BBH) method is the most frequently applied method to determine orthologous pairs. It
assumes that a cross-species protein pair in which each protein gives back the other protein as being the best hit in the
whole other proteome is an orthologous pair. In this research,
the best bidirectional hits were determined based on Z-values
of the Protein World human-mouse and human-worm set,
without a sequence similarity cutoff. In total, 12,817 humanmouse and 5,714 human-worm orthologous pairs were identified. Although the BBH method theoretically can give some
many-to-many orthologs, it practically gives only one-to-one
orthologous pairs.

interactions

InParanoid
In the INP method [6], all possible pairwise similarity scores
between datasets A-A, B-B, A-B and B-A that score higher
than a cutoff (bitscore ≥50, overlap ≥50%) are detected. Then
the best bidirectional hits are determined and marked as
potential orthologs. The in-species pairs that score higher
than these orthologous pairs are marked as additional

information

Because of the high degree of functional similarity between
orthologous proteins, the quality of orthology prediction is an
important factor in the transfer of functional annotation. To
measure the functional similarity of proteins from different
species we use functional genomics data, such as protein
interaction data and expression data. In general, we observe
a sensitivity/selectivity trade-off: the functional similarity
scores per orthologous pair become higher when the number
of proteins included in the ortholog groups decreases. This
trend is more visible in the human-mouse comparison than it
is in the human-worm comparison. Presumably, it gets less
visible when the phylogenetic distance gets larger. By combining the sensitivity and the selectivity into an overall score,
we show that the InParanoid program is the best ortholog
identification method in terms of identifying functionally
equivalent proteins. The method that should be used to
answer a specific research question is, however, also dependent on, for example, the evolutionary distance between the
studied species and the desirability of many-to-many orthologous relationships.

Conclusion

The six ortholog identification methods covered in this study
are listed below. Included are the best bidirectional hit
method and five many-to-many methods. The many-to-many
methods are divided into group orthology methods and nongroup orthology methods. The group orthology methods,
KOG [9], INP [6] and MCL [7], define several, distinct groups
of orthologous genes and proteins. The two many-to-many
non-group methods, PGT [10] and Z1H, do not define orthologous groups, but can still determine many-to-many orthologous relationships. Table 3 shows the numbers of orthologous
groups, unique proteins and protein pairs within the several
ortholog sets. The average proteome size is the geometric
average of the total number of unique human proteins and the
total number of unique mouse/worm proteins within the
determined orthologous relationships.

For an unbiased comparison of all of the covered methods,
the same data set was used at all times. This 'Protein World'
(unpublished data) data set [18] was created by comparing all
of the currently known and predicted proteins (SpTrEMBL
[19], RefSeq [20], Ensembl [21]) through the Smith-Waterman algorithm [22], using Z-values to obtain a database-size
independent estimate of significance [23]. The Smith-Waterman algorithm has been shown to be more sensitive [24] than
its faster (non-dynamic programming) approximations, the
BLAST [25] and FASTA [26] algorithms. The data set is freely
available through the Center for Molecular and Biomolecular
Informatics website [27]. As good expression data and other
functional data were available for human, mouse and worm,
we used the orthologous relationships between these three
species for our study.

information

The MCL algorithm [7] starts with an all-against-all BLASTP,
after which the reciprocal best similarity pairs between species are marked as putative orthologs and the reciprocal better similarity pairs as recent paralogs. A similarity matrix is
calculated, followed by a Markov clustering [29], which determines the orthologous groups. A list of all human and mouse
Ensembl protein identifiers linked to an OrthoMCL group ID
was obtained from the authors. These Ensembl protein IDs
were mapped to the SpTrEMBL proteome using EnsMart
[30] version 19.3 [31]. Orthologous relationships were determined between all human and mouse proteins within all
7,002 groups, which gives a total of 12,625 orthologous protein pairs. The loss of defined orthologs was corrected for by
calculating how many ensembl IDs mapped to an SpTrEMBL
ID (57.3397%). The average proteome size of 9,018 (for
human-mouse) was divided by 0.573397, giving a corrected
number of proteins of 15,727. The human-worm IDs were
obtained through the new OrthoMCL-DB [32]; 9,749 humanworm orthologous protein pairs were identified, comprising

The KOG database [9] is the eukaryote specific version of the
COG database [5]. The latter database is considered by many
to be the standard orthology database of this moment. Both
the COG and the KOG procedure start with an all-against-all
comparison using BLAST, followed by the detection of triangles of mutually consistent, genome-specific best hits (BeTs).
Subsequently triangles with a common side are merged to
form crude, preliminary KOGs, after which a case-by-case
analysis of each candidate KOG is carried out, among others
to split fused proteins. The difference between COG and KOG
lies within the last step, the manual curation. The KOG proce-

dure pays extra attention to multi-domain proteins, which are
quite common in eukaryotes. The KOG database currently
consists of seven eukaryotic proteomes. A BLAST all-againstall was used to determine the corresponding KOG for each
human, mouse and worm protein within the SpTrEMBL set.
Orthologous relationships were determined between all
human, mouse and worm proteins within a KOG. Because of
the large groups that can be formed by KOGs, no less than
810,697 human-mouse orthologous protein pairs were determined, divided over 7,874 orthologous groups; 155,387

orthologs. These 'in-paralogs' get confidence values that indicate how similar they are to the main ortholog: 100% is
assigned to the main ortholog and 0% is assigned to a
sequence with the minimum similarity score required to be
marked as in-paralog of a given group. Finally, overlapping
groups of orthologs are resolved and bootstrap-based confidence values are added for all groups of orthologs. Additionally, an outgroup proteome can be used to test the
significance of the in-paralog scores. InParanoid version 1.35
was downloaded [28] and the program was run using the
standard parameters, except for the use of the BLOSUM80
matrix instead of the standard BLOSUM62 matrix. The
BLOSUM80 matrix is more appropriate when studying protein pairs with relatively small evolutionary distances. The
optional third outgroup proteome was left out. We used Paracel BLAST 1.4.9. Through the INP algorithm, 19,482 orthologous pairs were identified between human and mouse,
comprising 12,610 orthologous groups; 17,011 orthologous
pairs were identified between human and worm, comprising
4,135 orthologous groups.

4,705 orthologous groups. Because of the different mapping
method, we did not need to correct the human-worm average
proteome size.

Z 1 Hundred
Within the Z1H method, all cross-species protein pairs that
have a Z-score of 100 or higher are considered to be orthologs.
The Z-value estimates the statistical significance of a SmithWaterman dynamic alignment score (SW-score) through the
use of a Monte-Carlo process [23]. In this approach, selected
pairs of sequences are shuffled randomly 200 times and realigned. The significance of the SW-score of a selected pair is
then determined by comparing the SW-score of the selected
pair with the scores for the shuffled pairs. By comparing the
score with that of the shuffled sequences the method implicitly takes into account effects of sequence composition and
sequence length. The Z1H set contains pairs of sequences
whose SW-score is a hundred standard deviations higher
than the average SW-score for the shuffled sequences. Using
the Z1H method, 290,176 human-mouse and 21,509 humanworm orthologous protein pairs were identified. The algorithm does not identify distinct groups of proteins, and is,
therefore, a non-group method.

PhyloGenetic Tree
The PGT method uses the output generated by multiple alignments and subsequent tree calculation [10] to define orthologous relationships. Although calculations like these are rather
time consuming, they should give a better insight into the
evolution of the studied proteins and in principle come closest to the original evolutionary definition of orthology.
Orthologies were determined by grouping all proteins over
the 9 eukaryotic species covered in Protein World that have a
Z-value above 20 compared to one of the human proteins, and
have a region of homology larger than 50% of the query
length. The resulting 23,829 groups were aligned using ClustalW version 1.82 [33], and phylogenies were created using
neighbor-joining [34]. For the calculation of the phylogenetic
trees we only used the positions that were present in all
aligned sequences, and levels of protein sequence identity
were translated to evolutionary distances using the Kimura
correction as implemented in ClustalW. The other parameters were set to default. After the calculations, an ortholog
identification algorithm selects partitions in the tree that only
include orthologs and in-paralogs to define the orthologous
relationships per species pair [10]. For human and mouse,
85,848 relationships were identified. For human and worm,
49,979 relationships were identified. Because a phylogenetic
tree is calculated for the homologs of every sequence, and the
trees are not merged, this method is like the Z1H method, not
a pure group method.

Benchmarks
Below are a description and the workflow of the used benchmarks. The first two benchmarks measure 'direct conservation of functional parameters', that is, they examine only one

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/4/R31

protein in human and one protein in mouse/worm. The last
three methods compare the relationship between two proteins in human with the relationship of their two orthologs in
mouse/worm ('pairwise conservation of functional parameters').
The results of the group orthology methods were analyzed in
two ways: we determined the average score for all pairwise
orthology relationships within an orthologous group; and we
only considered the best scoring pair within an orthologous
group. The latter option obviously leads to a much higher
score for the many-to-many orthology relationships. However, by including only one pair of orthologous sequences per
orthologous group, that high score is balanced by a reduction
in the total number of orthologous relationships (one per
orthologous group). Both the number of orthologous relationships and the quality of these relationships are taken into
account in the final assessment of the ortholog identification
algorithms.

Direct conservation of functional parameters
To test the conservation of function, the Pearson correlation
between the expression profiles of the proteins in an orthologous pair was calculated. The expression dataset used here
[35] was a subset of pathologically normal human and mouse
tissue samples from the Gene Logic BioExpress Database
product [36]. Because of the small overlap of tissue categories
(115 in human, 25 in mouse), the SNOMED [37] tissue categories were used to calculate the correlation coefficient (15 in
human, 12 in mouse, 12 overlapping categories). The human
dataset consists of 3,269 tissue samples and 44,792 cDNA
fragments, the mouse dataset of 859 tissue samples and
36,701 cDNA fragments. A perfect correlation has a score of 1,
a perfect anti-correlation has a score of -1. We used expression data from Stuart and colleagues [38] for the humanworm analysis, comparing tissues from both species that had
similar expression profiles. For computing time-saving reasons, we used a sample of the dataset to calculate which tissues were similar: the first 10 human tissues were compared
with all of the 978 worm tissues, using the first 10 metagenes
defined by Stuart et al. The 'best hit' of the worm tissue samples for each human tissue sample was seen as corresponding
tissue. These ten corresponding tissues were then used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between the
human and worm proteins, from which only the positive correlations were used. Proteome sizes were corrected for this by
multiplying them by two, before calculating the average proteome size. For visualization reasons we displayed error bars
of only one-eighth of the SD. Because of the differences
between the human-mouse and human-worm expression
data analyses, we emphasize that the two figures (Figures 1a
and 1b) should not be compared to each other. The figures
can, however, be used to compare the several ortholog identification methods within these species pairs.

A third measure of pairwise conservation is the conservation
of protein-protein interaction. The Database of Interacting
Proteins (DIP) database [40] was used to determine the protein-protein interactions in human and mouse/worm. A protein-protein interaction is considered conserved when two
interacting proteins in human have orthologs in mouse/
worm that are interacting too. Again, the fraction of interacting human proteins of which the orthologs in mouse/worm
are interacting too is considered to be a measure for the conservation of function.

For each of these parts of our reference set and for each of the
six ortholog identification methods, we determined how
many of these orthologous pairs were covered, together with
the number of false positives (pairs having only the human
protein or the mouse/worm protein from a reference pair).
Finally, to have a fair comparison between the several
ortholog identification methods, we calculated the number of
orthologous pairs divided by the average proteome size.

refereed research

We defined a list of 'true ortholog pairs', for both humanmouse and human-worm, as a reference set. We chose the
Hox cluster proteins and hemoglobins as a human-mouse reference set because of its well-studied evolution in vertebrates.
We determined the homeobox orthologs using Figure 1 from
[41]. This resulted in 41 orthologous protein pairs, consisting
of 31 human proteins and 35 mouse proteins. The hemoglobin orthologs were identified with the use of Lecomte et al.
[42], resulting in nine pairs of four human and nine mouse
proteins. For human-worm, we used the analysis on nuclear
receptors performed by Gissendanner et al. [43], resulting in
29 orthologous pairs of 22 human proteins and 18 worm proteins. A second human-worm orthology analysis was performed on the family of toll-like receptors [44], which has
only one member in worm but 10 members in human. The
fifth and final protein family, the Sm and Sm-like proteins
[45], was analyzed for both human-mouse and human-worm
orthologs. For this family we found 13 human proteins and 17
mouse proteins in 17 orthologous pairs, together with 6
human proteins and 6 worm proteins in 6 pairs.

To measure the conservation of co-expression, first the correlation between the expression profiles of each human-human
gene pair was calculated. The expression dataset used was a
subset of pathologically normal human and mouse tissue
samples from the Gene Logic BioExpress Database product,
as mentioned above. This time we used all of the 115 categories to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the
human-human pairs, and we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients for the mouse-mouse gene pairs using the 25
tissue categories in mouse. Co-expression is considered conserved when the studied human gene pair having a Pearson
correlation coefficient above a certain threshold has an
orthologous gene pair in mouse that has a Pearson correlation
coefficient above the same threshold. This threshold was varied between 0.0 and 1.0 with an interval of 0.1. Co-expression
can be used to predict protein function, specifically when it is
conserved in evolution [10,15]. To test which of the ortholog
sets can best be used to improve co-expression based function
prediction, we also determined which protein pairs were
active in the same process, using the GO database [16]. Two
proteins were said to be active in the same process if they
shared a 4th level element of the GO biological process tree,
in which the root is the 0th level element and every subsequent branch is one level higher. Finally, the fraction of the
total protein set sharing this 4th level element was calculated
for the several thresholds, as a measure for the sensitivity and
selectivity of the ortholog identification method for function
prediction by conservation of co-expression. In this analysis,
GO labels such as 'undefined' were discarded. The humanworm analysis was performed in a similar way, but with the
use of expression data from Stuart and colleagues [38]. For
calculating reliable correlation coefficients, we only used
genes here that had expression data for at least 900 out of the
1,202 human tissue samples. In worm, we used all genes having expression data for at least 500 out of the 979 tissue samples.

The conservation of gene order is the second measure of pairwise conservation. Here we examined if two genes were adjacent to each other on the genome using EnsMart [30] version
19.3 [31] for the human-mouse analysis and EnsMart version
34 for the human-worm analysis. For each of the pairs where
this was the case, we examined if the orthologs in mouse/
worm were also adjacent on the genome. If so, the gene order
was considered to be conserved for this gene pair. Because no
varying threshold is needed (two genes are adjacent or not),
this is more straight-forward than measuring the conservation of co-expression. The fraction of neighboring human
genes of which the orthologs in mouse/worm are also neighbors is used as a measure for the accuracy of orthology prediction.

Pairwise conservation of functional parameters

Hulsen et al. R31.11

comment

The conservation of molecular function can also be benchmarked by examining whether the orthologs are in the same
InterPro [39] family. Each InterPro accession number represents a protein family or domain, containing a cross-species
set of homologous proteins with its own functional annotation. Proteins within an InterPro protein family have similar
domain compositions. Again, the higher the percentage with
equal InterPro accession numbers, the better the conservation of function. As InterPro annotation is based on similarity
to predefined domains, it is not independent of sequence and
cannot be used as a completely independent benchmark. It
does, however, allow one to judge to what extent proteins that
are regarded as orthologous actually do have the same
domain composition. This is important because most automatic methods for orthology prediction, like OrthoMCL, do
not require proteins to be full length homologs.
