Abstract
Background: New chemotherapeutic agents against Schistosoma mansoni, an etiological agent of
human schistosomiasis, are a priority due to the emerging drug resistance and the inability of
current drug treatments to prevent reinfection. Proteases have been under scrutiny as targets of
immunological or chemotherapeutic anti-Schistosoma agents because of their vital role in many
stages of the parasitic life cycle. Function has been established for only a handful of identified S.
mansoni proteases, and the vast majority of these are the digestive proteases; very few of the
conserved classes of regulatory proteases have been identified from Schistosoma species, despite
their vital role in numerous cellular processes. To that end, we identified protease protein coding
genes from the S. mansoni genome project and EST library.
Results: We identified 255 protease sequences from five catalytic classes using predicted proteins
of the S. mansoni genome. The vast majority of these show significant similarity to proteins in KEGG
and the Conserved Domain Database. Proteases include calpains, caspases, cytosolic and
mitochondrial signal peptidases, proteases that interact with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules,
and proteases that perform regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Comparative analysis of classes
of important regulatory proteases find conserved active site domains, and where appropriate, signal
peptides and transmembrane helices. Phylogenetic analysis provides support for inferring functional
divergence among regulatory aspartic, cysteine, and serine proteases.
Conclusion: Numerous proteases are identified for the first time in S. mansoni. We characterized
important regulatory proteases and focus analysis on these proteases to complement the growing
knowledge base of digestive proteases. This work provides a foundation for expanding knowledge
of proteases in Schistosoma species and examining their diverse function and potential as targets for
new chemotherapies.

Background
Schistosomiasis is a common parasitic disease, affecting
millions of people, mostly in tropical, developing countries [1]. A causative agent of the disease is a trematode
worm, Schistosoma mansoni. Treatment of schistosomiasis

is commonly accomplished with praziquantel, for which
the mechanism of action is not precisely defined but is
thought to affect calcium ion channels [2] and/or purine
nucleotide uptake [3]. Despite the effectiveness of treatment, reinfection is common, and even more troubling,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/488

strains of S. mansoni resistant to praziquantel have been
found [4]. Thus, additional chemotherapeutic agents and
an effective vaccine against this parasite have long been
desired [5].
Ideally, vaccination of at-risk populations against the
debilitating effects of schistosomiasis is desired, but no
such treatment option is currently available. Surface
receptors and other proteins are currently being tested for
their potential to act as vaccines, but numerous challenges
in the search for an effective vaccine have yet to be overcome [6]. Some candidate vaccines are effective agents but
cannot be mass produced. Most other candidate proteins
have little potential as a vaccine, providing only 40-50%
protection [6]. While the search for an effective vaccine
continues, it is critical to continue to identify molecular
targets and their potential for chemotherapeutic disruption.
Proteases have been under scrutiny as targets of immunological or chemotherapeutic anti-Schistosoma agents
because of their vital role in many stages of the parasitic
life cycle [7,8]. In addition, proteases are known to act as
important regulatory elements in a variety of species
[9,10]. They also play a vital role as effectors of virulence
in pathogens in general, often serving to alter host signal
transduction and modify the immune response [11-14].
By targeting proteases specific to parasitic life style or
those with significant dissimilarity to homologous proteases in the host species, investigators hope to find antischistosomal chemotherapies with minimal side effects to
the host. However, few proteolytic enzymes have been
purified in Schistosoma, and even fewer have well characterized functions and interactions.
Proteases of all five catalytic classes have been identified
from Schistosoma species through proteomic or genetic
analysis. Function has been established for only a handful
of identified S. mansoni proteases, and the vast majority of
these are the digestive proteases involved in metabolic
food processing or host tissue penetration [15-18]. Additional proteases that are involved in reproduction, evasion of host immune system, and development have also

been characterized [7,19]. Very few proteases have been
evaluated for the potential to serve as chemotherapeutic
targets against schistosomiasis (e.g. [20]). Fortunately, it is
almost certain that additional proteases exist in the S.
mansoni genome, as the conserved classes of many regulatory proteases have not been identified from Schistosoma
species. Since current therapies for a wide variety of disorders and diseases target regulatory molecules, such proteases may serve as new and effective targets for antihelminthic treatments. The challenge of developing new
therapies involves several steps, the first of which is to
identify and characterize potential targets of drug or vaccine treatments. This is currently a task that is increasingly
accomplished and streamlined with genomic and bioinformatic tools [9,21].
The sequencing and annotation of the S. mansoni genome
[22], combined with large EST libraries, provide a wealth
of data from which to identify new vaccine or therapy targets [23-25]. These data, combined with bioinformatics
tools and specialized databases, can fast-track the identification of potential anti-trematode agents by complementing and supplementing traditional genetic and proteomic
identification techniques. Therefore, as an initial step in
characterizing some of these potential targets, we survey
the S. mansoni genome and EST library for protease genes.
In doing so, we identify for the first time, numerous
potentially important proteases in trematodes, many of
which will have essential functions and may serve as targets of effective chemotherapeutic or immunological
treatments.

Results and Discussion
After culling the data of redundant sequences, inactive
homologs and likely pseudogenes, we identified a total of
255 predicted proteases among 54 families (Table 1; see
Additional file 1). The 255 proteases identified here comprise 2.1% of the roughly 12,000 predicted genes in the S.
mansoni genome [22]. In the MEROPS database, there are
currently 22 known or putative proteases identified in S.
mansoni. Since over 90% of the genes presented here are
new, this bioinformatic data mining represents a substantial expansion of putative proteases from this species. As

expected, proteases of five catalytic classes were identified:
4% are aspartic, 26% are cysteine, 39% are metalloproteases, 24% are serine, and 6% are threonine proteases.
These proportions are largely in harmony with those from
other organisms [26,27].
The recently published genome sequence of S. mansoni
estimates the presence of 335 protease sequences in 60
families [22]. For the protease families represented in
both publications, estimated numbers are identical in 19
families, and 27 families are estimated by Berriman et al.
[22] to have more members. In cases where estimates differ, most are very similar, the exception being families
A01, C01, and S09, which we estimate to have a little
more than half the previously published numbers. Such
differences are easily attributed to differences in data mining methodologies. For instance, Berriman et al. used a
Markov method to identify divergent homologues and
culled sequences less than 80 residues or those that overlapped less than 50% of the most similar homologue. In
comparison, our methods utilized no specialized methods to identify divergent homologues and culled
sequences less than 100 residues or that overlapped less
than 80% of the most similar homologue.
Comparatively, Caenorhabditis elegans, a round worm with
a well characterized and annotated genome, has 341
known or putative proteases in the MEROPS database.
The proportions of classes of proteases are roughly equivalent, but we note a slight expansion in the relative proportion of serine proteases in C. elegans compared to S.
mansoni, and a comparative expansion of cysteine proteases in S. mansoni (Figure 1). Some differences will also
naturally arise because of differences in organism complexity and life style (C. elegans is a free living species,
whereas S. mansoni is parasitic). However, differences
between these two species may also partially be attributable to the coverage and sequence quality of the genomes,

each protease class in the species relative proportions of

and the fact that S. mansoni genome characterizations are
newer and still very much subject to verification and basic
delineation.
Most of the protein sequences that had high similarity to
MEROPS database sequences were verified as having a
conserved protease-specific domain (see Additional file
1). KAAS was able to assign orthology and KEGG functional pathways to 120 of the S. mansoni proteases (Figure
2; see Additional file 2 for full annotation of KEGG pathways). Forty-one proteases are assigned to be involved in
metabolic processes, while twenty-four are involved in
genetic information processing. Environmental information processes involve eleven proteases, while eleven additional proteases are engaged in cellular processes such as
communication and cell cycling. We note that despite the
removal of sequences that show similarity to inactive proteases in MEROPS, and assignment of sequences to functional pathways, none of the new proteases identified in
the present work have been experimentally shown to be
catalytically active.
Below, we review the findings and highlight several
important regulatory proteases which are identified for
the first time in this species. We focus on regulatory proteases because numerous digestive proteases are already
known and being studied in S. mansoni, but relatively little
is known about the regulatory proteases despite their
potential as targets for novel inhibitive chemotherapies.
Aspartic Proteases
Eleven loci encoding aspartic proteases from just three
families were identified. Four of the aspartic proteases, all
in the A1 family, were found to contain a signal peptide.
Transmembrane (TM) predictions differed between meth-

ods: TMHMM found three proteases with a TM domain,
all in family A22; TUPS detected a total of 5 TM domains
among the A1 and A22 families (Table 1; see Additional
file information 1). Two loci were significantly similar to
family A2 proteases, but were subsequently found to lack
similarity to any conserved domain, protease or not, in
the CD database. We found five loci encoding proteins
with high similarity to Pepsin/Cathepsin type aspartic
proteases, which are broadly distributed among taxa and
are most active at an acidic pH. Many of these sequences
have already been identified in S. mansoni, and are known
to be involved in digestion of host proteins [28]. Other
functions of this class of proteases are also known, and it
is possible that specific sub-functions may be portioned
among loci. However, only two of these loci show similarity to sequences in the S. mansoni EST library, so this possibility should be investigated further.
We also identify three A22 protease family members from
S. mansoni for the first time. This class of proteases serves
as important regulatory elements through their exceptional ability to lyse peptide bonds within a cell membrane [29]. The capacity to lyse peptide bonds that lie
embedded within a plasma membrane (also termed regulated intramembrane proteolysis, or RIP) is shared only
among A22, M50 and S54 family proteases [30]. These
proteases associate with latent, membrane bound cell signaling molecules; upon intramembrane proteolysis, bioactive domains of the signaling molecules are freed to
initiate a signaling cascade or act as an enzyme [31].
The S. mansoni A22 protease Smp_153960 contains both
active site motifs, and in a phylogeny (Figure 3) is closely
associated with presenilin-type proteases from C. elegans.
The conserved evolutionary function of presenilin proteases is the control of NOTCH proteins, which act as regulators of gene expression and are involved in diverse
cellular and tissue functions such as cell maturation, angiogenesis, and neuronal function and development [32].
Smp_154770 also contains both active site motifs, but
forms part of a clade comprised of signal peptide proteases. The signal peptide proteases (also known as impaslike proteases) are not associated with NOTCH signaling
in C. elegans, but are involved in embryonic development
and larval molting [33]. Impas protease knockout C. elegans have an embryonic lethal phenotype, possibly due to
the function of the protease in lipid homeostasis and the
production of cholesterol-derived hormones. Thus it is
significant that Smp_154770 clusters with other signal
peptide proteases, which are nonredundant and distinct
from presenilin protease activity. The remaining A22 protease from S. mansoni, Smp_155880, does not contain the
complete catalytic dyad (Additional file 2). Smp_155880
is not allied closely in the phylogenetic tree with either
presenilin or signal peptide proteases (Figure 3) but the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/488

genetic distance shows it shares higher sequence similarity
to Smp_153960 (genetic distance values: Smp_155880/
Smp_153960, 0.918; Smp155880/Smp_154770, 0.889;
Smp_154770/Smp_153960, 0.871). Interestingly, A22
family proteases cleave the signal peptides of MHC class I
molecules (HLA-A, -B, -C) in humans, which serve as a ligand for HLA-E molecules. This activity reports successful
MHC biosynthesis to the immune system and regulates
NK cell mediated attack [34].
Cysteine Proteases
We detected 68 loci with significant similarity to known
cysteine proteases; of these, 19% had an identifiable signal sequence and thus are likely to enter the secretory
pathway. There was a large discrepancy between the two
TM domain prediction algorithms: TMHMM found a TM
domain in just one cysteine protease, whereas TUPs
detected such a domain in 60% of the members of this
catalytic class (Table 1). We detected 15 members of the
C1 family of proteases, which contain the well-known
cysteine-type cathepsin activity involved in digestion of
host proteins [18]. Eight of these loci had a conserved
cathepsin B domain and other cathepsin family members
were detected as well. Cathepsin proteases have already
shown promise as targets of new anti-schistosomal therapies and further investigation is warranted [35]. In addition to the digestive enzymes characterized by the
cathepsins, we also detected numerous regulatory cysteine
proteases.

Regulatory cysteine proteases include the calciumdependent proteases typified by the calpain and caspase
proteases. Calpain proteases belong to the C2 family, of
which we found eight members encoded in the S. mansoni
genome. Calpains are regulatory proteases with a broad
array of functions and are involved in cell mobility, cell
cycle progression, and the regulation of clotting factors.
Calpains are one class of proteases already under investigation as vaccine candidates in S. japonicum, with results
indicating a reduction in worm burden and egg production in immunized mice [20].
Caspase proteases are also calcium-dependent, and are
most prominently known to control apoptosis in a wide
variety of animals, including other bilaterian worms [36].
However, the so called inflammatory caspases mediate
non-death functions such as inflammation, immunity,
and maturation of a variety of cell types [37]. Although
there is broad overlap, apoptosis caspases are often categorized as initiator (which are upstream in the signaling
cascade and activate other signaling proteins), and effector caspases (which directly lyse cellular proteins whose
damage leads to classical signs of apoptosis). The four S.
mansoni caspases identified here all have the conserved
catalytic motifs of His-Gly and Ala-Cys, and are preceded

by blocks of hydrophobic residues (Additional file 3). C.
elegans also has 4 caspase loci, but only three have a conserved catalytic motif. In a sequence identity matrix of S.
mansoni, C. elegans and human caspases, all of the S. mansoni caspases shared more similarity to caspases from
humans rather than to any other species, including other
S. mansoni caspases (Table 2). In three out of the four
cases, S. mansoni shared their highest similarity to human
caspases, whereas all human caspases except one were
most similar to another human caspase.
Caspases fall into three phylogenetic clades, which largely
correspond with tetrapeptide substrate specificity [38].
Caspases from a species typically fall into multiple clades,
with the known exception being C. elegans, whose caspases also form a species-specific clade in our phylogenetic analysis. S. mansoni caspases are dispersed among
the three clades (Figure 4), as seen in most species, but
unlike C. elegans. Two S. mansoni caspases (Smp_172010
and Smp_028500) are in a clade with effector caspases
from humans and mice, while Smp_141270 is associated
with classical initiators caspase 8 and caspase 10. The
fourth trematode caspase is in a monophyletic group with
the initiator caspase 9, and a larger clade of mostly inflammatory caspases, which have a regulatory role in the
immune system and are associated only with species having a complex hematopoesis involved in the immune
response. The placement of S. mansoni caspases in the
larger phylogeny raises interesting possibilities regarding
the specificity and function of these proteases which warrants further investigation. Although caspases are important regulatory proteins and are targets of
chemotherapeutic agents in several pathologies, including
cancer [39], no anti-schistosomal agents are currently
being investigated that target these proteases.
Another group of important regulatory elements include
the cysteine proteases that interact with ubiquitin, SUMO
and NEDD molecules (hereafter collectively referred to as
ub-like). Ub-like molecules are known to function in the
targeting of proteins for destruction by the 26S proteasome, but they also play a prominent regulatory role in the

cell through post-translational modification, and protein
turn-over and half life [40,41]. We have putatively identified more than 30 members from the C12, C19, and C48
proteases families, which interact with ub-like protein
molecules. These proteases are responsible for the activation (through cleavage of C-terminal di-glycine motifs)
and recycling (by removing ub-like molecules from targeted proteins) of ubiquitin and SUMO molecules, controlling the regulatory roles these molecules play [42]. For
instance, ubiquitin is known in part to regulate apoptosis
by antagonizing the reaction of caspases with the apoptosis complex; cleavage by ubiquitin proteases is central to
this process [43].
It is interesting to note that some of the molecules that
effect pathogenesis in bacteria use cysteine proteases that
operate on host ub-like molecules to interfere with the
regulation of proteins during infection [14]. In fact,
numerous effector proteins causing virulence in plant and
animal pathogens such as Yersia and Pseudomonas are
cysteine proteases, which target SUMO and other regulatory and signaling molecules such as NF-ÎºB [44].
Metalloproteases
Metalloproteases make up a large fraction of proteolytic
enzymes in the S. mansoni genome; one hundred loci were
detected, and 12% of these contained signal sequence.
Nineteen percent of metalloproteases have one or more
trans-membrane alpha helices, indicating that a substantial portion of these proteases may be membrane bound
(Table 1). The bioinformatic approach found a locus that
may correspond to the previously identified LAP protease
of family M17 [45]. Additionally, we found a putative
locus for a previously isolated protein thought to be the
SmDPPIII, in family M28 [46]. Many other metalloproteases, previously unidentified, were also detected.

There are hundreds of proteins that operate in the mitochondria, and the vast majority of them are encoded in
the nucleus. The mitochondrial processing protease
(MPP) and the mitochondrial intermediate protease
(MIP) often function in concert to cleave signal peptides

from immature mitochondrial proteins that are synthesized in the cytoplasm [47]. Failure to do so obstructs further protein sorting, assembly, and function. We detected
both the Î±- and Î²- (which should be catalytically active)
subunits of the S. mansoni MPP. The Î²-MPP of S. mansoni
has the conserved HxxEHx(76)E motif, indicating that it is
probably catalytically active (Additional file 3). The S.
mansoni Î±-MPP and the Î²-MPP share 20% identity, which
is within the normal range of this comparison for several
taxa. Interestingly, S. mansoni Î²-MPP shares 50% sequence
identity with its human homolog, which is a higher similarity than the S. mansoni - C. elegans Î²-MPP homologs
(40%).
A predicted protein for MIP was also detected, and contains a HExxH zinc binding domain, critical to catalysis.
The putative S. mansoni MIP sequence contains 18
cysteine residues, consistent with cysteine enrichment in
the MIP proteins of other species (human and rat MIPs
have 18 and 16 cysteine residues respectively) [47]. However, the C terminus of the protein truncates part of the
larger catalytic domain conserved in this family of proteases, indicating that this sequence may either be artificially abbreviated by the gene prediction algorithms, or
represent a pseudogene.
ATP-dependent mitochondrial proteases are also known,
but their function is less well defined. Generally however,
these play an essential role in quality control, turnover,
and assembly of the respiratory chain complex proteins
[48]. Nine ATP-dependent proteases of the M41 family are
detected in S. mansoni, and all contain an ATP binding
motif, but only one sequence (Smp_165550) contains the
active site HExxH motif. Treatment of S. mansoni with
metalloprotease inhibitors results in unexplained paralysis of adult worms [49]. This could be related to mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease inhibition, as defects
or loss of this protease results in spastic paraplegia in
humans and mice [50].
M50 family proteases are one of the three families of proteases that can perform RIP, and include mammalian S2P
proteases, and bacterial SpoIVFB. One protease of the
M50 family with an active site motif (HExxH) was
detected in our analysis (Smp_054310). This protease is
predicted to have multiple transmembrane helices, and
the putative active site is found within the third transmembrane helix (approximately residues 175-195; see
Additional file 3), consistent with predicted function [31].
As with other proteases that perform RIP, bioactivation of
the substrate is a multi-step process, involving multiple
proteases. In mammals, S2P cannot perform RIP unless
the substrate protein is first cleaved by S1P, a S08 family
protease. A homolog of mammalian S1P is also found in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/488

S. mansoni, providing evidence of an active and at least
partially conserved functional mechanism [51].
Serine Proteases
Sixty serine proteases were detected in our screening of the
S. mansoni predicted proteins, and these are divided
among 15 families. Sixteen loci were found to have a predicted signal sequence--many of these are in the S1 family,
which is consistent with the majority of known S1 family
proteases entering the secretory pathway and having a signal sequence. Twelve of the serine proteases have at least
one transmembrane alpha helix, as predicted by
TMHMM, whereas TUPs identified 35 proteases with a TM
alpha helix (Table 1). We identified a locus for the well
known cercarial elastase [52], and note that several loci
also identified as having the highest similarity to cercarial
elastase were detected, but were excluded from the analysis due to the likelihood of being pseudogenes. Numerous
regulatory serine proteases are identified for the first time
in S. mansoni with this report.

The S01 family is the largest group of proteases, with a
wide variety of functions. This functional divergence is frequently reflected in phylogenetic grouping and/or variation at 5-6 base-pair motifs surrounding functionally
important residues, such as active sites [53-55]. We identified eighteen S01 proteases in the S. mansoni genome,
however six of these did not have a significant similarity
to a conserved protease domain (Appendix 1). In addition, alignment of the sequences revealed that only seven
of these predicted proteins have the conserved catalytic
triad of His, Asp, and Ser (Additional file 3). A phylogeny
of S01 proteases from human, Drosophila, C. elegans, and
S. mansoni resulted in a general lack of resolution in the
deeper nodes, making it difficult to ascertain any level of
functional clustering (Figure 5). Despite this, a strongly
supported cluster of four S. mansoni proteases
(Smp_06510, _06520, _112090, and _119130) is formed
among sequences with 58-99% identity. Included in this
cluster are cercarial elastase and other proteases of similar
predicted length. Two of the remaining S. mansoni S01
proteases are in a large unresolved polytomy that includes
S01 proteases from all species included in the analysis.
The final S. mansoni S01 protease is in a clade of "effector"
proteases that function downstream in a signaling cascade
and operate on cellular substrates (such as elastase and
plasminogen). Although it is impossible to assign functions to S. mansoni S01 proteases through the above analysis, results indicate a possible functional divergence
among S. mansoni S01 proteases. Some of these sequences
may have a closely related (original) function that is not
shared with other organisms included in the analysis.
We also found members of the S08 family that have a catalytic mechanism that is distinct from the typical chymo-

trypsin activity of S01 family proteases. This family is
mostly comprised of endoproteases with broad function,
many of which enter the secretory pathway [56]. S. mansoni also has S26 family members, which contain proteases that are responsible for processing numerous
precursor proteins to active, mature forms [57]. This
occurs when signal peptides of newly synthesized proteins
are cleaved upon arrival at a functional site. This cleavage
event also acts as a post-translational regulatory event,
controlling the activation of these proteins until the signal
peptide is removed. Other AAA mitochondrial proteases
of the S16 family, which bind DNA and RNA and may
participate directly in the metabolism of mtDNA, are also
found. Downregulation of this protease causes a general
activation of caspases and leads to apoptosis [58].
We also found members of the S54 family of proteases in
the S. mansoni genome. This family of proteases functions
to perform RIP, resulting in the liberation of bioactive signaling peptides from anchoring TM domains [13,59].
Consistent with the expected function, these S54 proteases have several TM helices predicted by both TMHMM
and TUPs, indicating a likely conserved structure among
taxa (Appendix 1).
S54 family proteases are termed rhomboid proteases and
can be divided into several groups because of conserved
structure, substrate similarity, and cellular localization.
These differences are reflected in their phylogenetic clustering into PARL, secretase, and iRhom-type proteases
[60]. We included putative S. mansoni rhomboid proteases in phylogenetic analysis to categorize these into
subtypes and as an initial assessment of similarity and
possible function (Figure 6). The resulting phylogenetic
tree strongly supported groups corresponding to PARL,
secretase, and iRhom proteases, but the relationships
within and among the three groups were not always clear.
The three S. mansoni putative rhomboid family members
fell into three separate clades. Smp_032420 has the conserved histidine and GxSx motif in a hydrophobic region
predicted to be in a transmembrane helix (see Additional
file 3). This is characteristic of proteolytically active rhomboids and Smp_032420 was placed with the PARL-like
proteases, which localize to the mitochondria.
Smp_020090 clusters with the secretase-A rhomboids,
and consistent with this clustering is the conserved catalytic motif in a hydrophobic region. Smp_008620 is short
and likely represents an incomplete sequence, but portions of it do show significant similarity to iRhom-like
rhomboids, including a conserved proline in the degenerate catalytic motif. iRhoms lack a catalytic activity, but
their phylogenetic clustering suggests some conserved
functional relationship. These assessments of S. mansoni
rhomboids to functional classes are simply based on similarity and await experimental confirmation.

Threonine Proteases
Threonine proteases are most closely associated with the
elements of the 20S proteasome, and the majority of threonine proteases discovered in our analysis appear to be
subunits of that proteasome. At least 5 alpha subunits and
4 beta subunits of the proteasome were detected, all of
which show evidence of being expressed. S. mansoni proteasome elements have already been identified and characterized through proteomic analysis, which detected all
seven alpha and beta subunits and displayed morphological diversity due mainly to post-translational modifications [61]. Thus, the bioinformatic data mining done here
failed to identify all threonine protease genes present in
the genome, or the genome annotation and gene detection methods used have failed to detect some genes
known to be present. This difference highlights the need
for collaborative work and the complementary nature of
bioinformatic, and proteomic discovery of genetic elements.

In addition to the proteasome subunits, a taspase-like
protease was identified in the S. mansoni genome. This
protease cleaves the general transcription factor TFIIA, regulating transcription of numerous gene products.

Conclusion
We used in silico methods to explore the catalog of predicted proteins of S. mansoni for sequences homologous
to known proteases. The search resulted in the detection
of 255 putative proteases, over 90% of which are recognized for the first time in this species. Along with the proteases already described as having a function primarily in
digestion and host invasion, we identify numerous previously unidentified regulatory proteases involved in a variety of biological processes. We focused on regulatory
proteases because they generally serve essential functions
in the maintenance of homeostasis and the developmental progression of the life cycle of a species. The vital
nature of protease-mediated regulatory function underscores the potential of these proteases as targets of inhibitory chemotherapies and we hope that the identification
of proteases stimulates further research into this area, such
as expanding the application of gene silencing to identify
the function of various proteases in Schistosoma species
[62,63].

Methods
We used the complete set of protease core sequences from
the MEROPS (release 7.8) database [64] to identify putative homologues of known proteases in the S. mansoni
genome. Core protease sequences comprise a non-redundant library of the catalytic unit of a protease and exclude
all other functional units, such as ATP-binding, or calcium-binding domains. These sequences were used to
avoid false positive identification of proteins as proteases

due to high homology in non-catalytic parts of the
sequence. Core sequences were compared to predicted
proteins from the annotated S. mansoni genome. Release
4.0 of the S. mansoni genome includes a first-pass annotation and gene prediction, of which we downloaded the
complete database of predicted proteins. In addition, the
complete set of ESTs (release 6.0 of the S. mansoni gene
index) isolated from 6 life stages of S. mansoni was also
acquired.
Using the MEROPS proteases as the database, we used the
predicted proteins as the query sequences in a local
BLASTP [65] comparison. Default parameters were used
during the search, where all predicted proteins were queried against all members of the protease database. In the
comparison, only sequences with similarity scores <1e-04
were retained as S. mansoni protease homologs. From the
initial result, query sequences identified as similar to
homologous non-protease sequences (protease-like
sequences but with mutations in active sites) were culled
from the results, as were alternative splice forms of a gene.
Additionally, predicted proteins that were shorter than
100 residues or less than 80% of the protease core
sequence were not retained. Remaining sequences were
subject to full analysis.
Results from the BLASTP query were subject to a number
of analyses to characterize the sequences. We first independently sought the predicted function of S. mansoni
sequences by searching for conserved motif and domains
in the protein sequences. This was done using searches in
the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) v. 2.13 of NCBI
[66,67]. CDD searches employ a reverse position-specific
BLAST to align query sequence to protein domains from
SMART v. 5.0 [68], Pfam v. 22.0 [69], and COG [70]. The
KEGG automated annotation server (KAAS) was used to
assign pathway-based functional orthology to sequences
in our dataset [71]. We were also interested in identifying
alpha-helix domains that likely span a cellular membrane.
The prediction of these transmembrane helices is imprecise, so we report the results of two methods: TMHMM
[72] and TUP [73].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/488

was recorded for these proteins. We used the eukaryote
setting with each sequence truncated after 70 residues to
avoid false positive detection of signal sequence outside
of the N-terminus.
Functionally distinct proteases may show differential phylogenetic clustering. Therefore, we performed phylogenetic comparisons, including mainly species with
functionally defined proteases with S. mansoni sequences
(accession numbers of sequences used are given in the
Additional files). While phylogenetic analysis does detect
evidence of divergence, the functional implications of the
divergence must be tested experimentally, as such phylogenetic analyses represent an initial assessment of potential functional divergence among multiple S. mansoni
proteases within a family. For phylogenetic analysis,
homologous protein sequences from selected species were
obtained from NCBI GENBANK. Alignments were made
using MUSCLE default parameters [77]. Resulting alignments were subject to phylogenetic analysis using
MRBAYES [78]. Flexible priors were used by employing a
mixed model analysis. Mixed model analysis avoids reliance on a single model of amino acid substitutions (and
thus a single prior) by allowing the MCMC sampler to regularly propose and explore the fit of new models during
analysis (see MRBAYES documentation for model specifications). Each model contributes to the results in proportion to their posterior probability. We performed two
simultaneous but independent runs on each data set, with
each run consisting of three heated chains and one cold
chain. Runs were continued until the average standard
deviation of the split frequencies between the two runs
was less than 0.02, with a minimum of 100,000 MCMC
generations. Trees were sampled every 50th generation,
resulting in at least 2,000 saved trees. The first 25% of
trees were discarded as burn-in prior to summarizing sampled trees. Summarizing samples produced a consensus
tree with branch bifurcation support (clade credibility)
indicated. Clade credibility was calculated for each bifurcation as the proportion of sampled trees with that bifurcation.

Authors' contributions
The expected cellular location (e.g. cytoplasmic, membrane, or mitochondrial) and potential to enter the secretory pathway of a cell is also informative in classifying
newly identified proteins. Therefore, we identified signal
sequences in the proteins with signalP, using both the
neural network and HMM methods [74,75]. The D score
is the average of the maximal Y-score (the most likely location of the cleavage site of the signal sequence) and the
mean S-score, and is the best way to discriminate true signal sequences in proteins [76]. Proteins with a D score
greater than 55 and HMM greater than 90% were scored
as having an N-terminal signal sequence and the Y-score
