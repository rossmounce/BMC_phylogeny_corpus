Abstract
Introduction Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 was identified
in respiratory specimens from a cluster of eight patients on a
surgical intensive care unit within 8 weeks. Six of these patients
suffered from HSV-related tracheobronchitis and one from HSVrelated pneumonia only. Our outbreak investigation aimed to
determine the clinical relevance of and risk factors associated
with HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia in critically ill
patients, and to investigate whether the cluster was caused by
nosocomial transmission.

increased mortality (100% in patients with versus 17.8% in
patients without HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia; P
< 0.0001). The interaction of longer duration of ventilation and
tracheotomy
was
associated
with
HSV-related
tracheobronchitis or pneumonia in multivariable analysis.

Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed to identify
risk factors for the outcomes of HSV-related tracheobronchitis
or pneumonia and death using univariable analysis as well as
logistic regression analysis. Viruses were typed by molecular
analysis of a fragment of the HSV type 1 glycoprotein G.

Identical HSV type 1 glycoprotein G sequences were found in
three patients and in two patients. The group of three identical
viral sequences belonged to a widely circulating strain. The two
identical viral sequences were recovered from bronchoalveolar
lavages of one patient with HSV-related tracheobronchitis and
of one patient without clinical symptoms. These viral sequences
showed unique polymorphisms, indicating probable nosocomial
transmission.

Results The cohort of patients covering the outbreak period
comprised 53 patients, including six patients with HSV-related
tracheobronchitis and one patient with pneumonia only. HSVrelated tracheobronchitis or pneumonia was associated with

Conclusion HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia is
associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. Care
should be taken to avoid nosocomial transmission and early
diagnosis should be attempted.

Introduction

infection through persistence in neurons of the dorsal root
ganglia and the autonomic nervous system [2]. Reactivation
can be triggered by local stimuli (ultraviolet irradiation, tissue
damage) or by systemic stimuli (fever, menstruation, surgery,
physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance,

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a double-stranded DNA virus
occurring in two types, HSV-1 and HSV-2. Transmission usually occurs by contact with infected saliva or cutaneous lesions
[1]. After primary infection, HSV-1 establishes a life-long latent

immunosuppression) [3]. Clinical manifestations of HSV-1
infection include gingivostomatitis (primary infection), herpes
labialis, encephalitis, and keratoconjunctivitis; infections of the
respiratory or gastrointestinal tract have been described predominantly in immunosuppressed patients [2].
Asymptomatic shedding of HSV in healthy individuals has
been reported to occur in 2–10% of infected individuals [4,5].
HSV-1 can be detected in the upper respiratory tract and in
the lower respiratory tract of intensive care unit patients in 22–
23% and 16% of cases, respectively [5,6]. Whether these
proportions represent clinically relevant HSV infection or,
rather, are an indicator of severe disease favouring reactivation
without clinical significance is the subject of ongoing debate
[5,7-9]. Tracheobronchitis due to HSV has been described in
critically ill patients [10,11].
As more than 90% of adults have antibodies specific for HSV1 [11], infections in adulthood are usually assumed to be reactivation of endogenous virus, although reinfection with a different HSV-1 strain that is immunologically distinct is also
possible [12].
Eight patients in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) had
HSV-1 detected in their respiratory tract within 8 weeks. Tracheobronchitis was associated with HSV-1 detection in six
patients and with pneumonia in four patients. This cluster
prompted us to investigate the clinical impact of HSV-related
tracheobronchitis or pneumonia and to identify risk factors
predisposing to HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia
and fatal outcome. As the cluster suggested the possibility of
nosocomial transmission, molecular epidemiological studies
were performed to type all viruses recovered from the patients.

Materials and methods
Setting and patients
When a cluster of six patients with HSV-1-related tracheobronchitis occurred on a 15-bed cardiothoracic SICU (Figure

1), the present outbreak investigation was initiated. Medical
records of the SICU and the database of the Department of
Virology were reviewed to identify all patients who were hospitalized on this SICU during the time period when the cluster
occurred and who had HSV-1 detected (by antigen detection,
virus isolation or PCR) in respiratory fluids.
Demographic data as well as underlying diseases, clinical
course, any severe clinical presentations in addition to the
HSV-1-associated ones and outcome were recorded (Tables
1 and 2). All records of bronchoscopic and radiologic examinations were reassessed, focusing on endobronchial bleedings and lesions or infiltrates compatible with HSV infection.
Microbiological and mycological findings were reviewed to
determine whether concurrent infections with pathogens other
than HSV were present. To assess the clinical relevance of
HSV-1 detection in respiratory fluids, the clinical presentations
and outcomes of HSV-1-positive patients were analysed
(Tables 1 and 2).
Bronchoscopies were sampled after routine disinfection. DNA
was isolated and used as the input in the diagnostic HSV PCR
and in the typing PCR (see below).
The institutional review board approved the outbreak
investigation.
Cohort study
A retrospective cohort study was performed including the 8week period that entirely covered the cluster episode. During
this period all patients admitted to the SICU with a stay longer
than 72 hours were included (n = 53). The analysed outcomes
were death and HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia.
The latter was defined as HSV detection in the respiratory
tract concomitant with the presence of tracheobronchitis or
pneumonia and an absence of other respiratory pathogens
even though histopathology was not performed. Sampling for
HSV detection in respiratory fluids was performed if clinically

indicated (that is, in case of unexplained deterioration of respiratory function, tracheobronchial bleeding or suspicious
mucosal lesions on bronchoscopic examination).
Of the 53 patients, seven fulfilled the criteria for the outcome
HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia. One of the
patients with HSV detection in bronchoalveolar lavage was
excluded from the analysis of the cohort study (Patient C3)
because he did not show symptoms related to HSV (Tables 1
and 2). The HSV glycoprotein G sequence of this patient was
included in the molecular epidemiological analysis (see

below). None of the remaining 45 patients presented with
symptoms of tracheobronchitis. Eight of the 45 remaining
patients were confirmed negative for HSV in their lower respiratory tract secretions, whereas the other patients were not
tested because testing was only performed if clinical symptoms were evocative.
The variables analysed as risk factors for HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia and fatal outcome are presented in
Tables 3 and 4. The variables pneumonia and HSV-related tracheobronchitis or HSV-related pneumonia were included

additionally as risk factors for fatal outcome. As appropriate to
analyse the time period at risk for developing HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia, variables were only regarded as
positive if they occurred prior to HSV detection (for patients
with HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia) or prior to
SICU discharge (for patients without HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia).

Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
If direct sequencing was unsuccessful the samples were subjected to a nested PCR. The first round involved the amplification of a 600 bp fragment using the outer primers HSV-N1-For
(5'-GGGTTCCCACCAACGTCTCC) and HSV-N1-Rev (5'GGGTGTGTGCGTCGCCCGC). The resulting PCR product
was used as template in the PCR described above.

Statistical analysis
Univariable analysis and logistic regression with stepwise (forward and backward) variable selection were performed using
SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). P < 0.05
was regarded as significant for univariable analysis. A significance level of 0.1 was chosen for inclusion of variables into a
logistic regression model and for remaining included in the
model.

The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the NCBI
database GenBank (accession numbers EF376300–
EF376333).

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c
index) is used to evaluate the predictive power of the logistic
regression model. The c index represents the probability that
the regression model equation assigns randomly chosen
patients with HSV higher probabilities of acquiring HSV than
randomly chosen patients without HSV [13].

Phylogenetic analysis of the 309 bp sequence of the PCR
product was conducted with Phylip software (version 3.63)
and with the MEGA Software package (version 3.1) [15]. The
phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method (Kimura two-parameter matrix) with a transition/
transversion ratio of 2.0. Bootstrapping was performed with
1,000 replicates and values above 80% are indicated. The
tree is presented as an unrooted tree because the use of HSV2 as an outgroup was impossible due to highly divergent
sequences between HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the analysed region.

Results
Viral diagnostics and molecular typing
Respiratory specimens (bronchoalveolar lavage or tracheal
aspirates in most cases, nasopharyngeal swab in one patient)
were submitted to direct immunofluorescence staining with
antibodies specific for HSV. A sample (1–2 ml) of the specimen was added to cell cultures of Hep-2 and Vero cells, and
was monitored twice weekly for up to 3 weeks for emergence
of a cytopathic effect. DNA was isolated and a real-time PCR
was performed, detecting a 254 bp fragment of the HSV UL27
gene (Engelmann, I., Petzold, D.R., Kosinska A., Hepkema
B.G., Schulz, T. F. and Heim, A., accepted for publication in
Journal of Medical Virology; Title: Rapid quantitative PCR
assays for the simultaneous detection of herpes simplex virus,
varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and
human herpesvirus 6 DNA in blood and other clinical specimens). Melting curve analysis was used to differentiate HSV-1
and HSV-2.

All viruses recovered from patients on the SICU during the
time period of the cluster (designated C; Figure 1) – including
patients with HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia
and one patient with asymptomatic HSV detection – were
typed. Additionally, HSV isolates from patients of the same
SICU outside the cluster period (designated I) and HSV isolates from patients on other wards (designated M) were typed.
A hypervariable part of the HSV-1 glycoprotein G was amplified as described by Rekabdar and colleagues [14]. Direct
sequencing was performed using the PCR primers and the
dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer's instructions on the ABI PRISM 310

HSV-related tracheobronchitis was diagnosed in six patients
on a SICU within 8 weeks. Endobronchial bleeding was lifethreatening in three patients. HSV-1 was detectable in the respiratory specimens of all patients (Tables 1 and 2) whereas no
concurrent bacterial or fungal pathogens were isolated. Furthermore, HSV-1 was detected in bronchoalveolar lavages of
two additional patients who did not suffer from HSV-related
tracheobronchitis, one of whom had pneumonia (Figure 1).
The only surviving patient (C3) had neither clinical nor bronchoscopic signs of HSV-related tracheobronchitis but did
receive antiviral medication.
All patients were HSV IgG-positive at the time of HSV detection, suggesting that none of them suffered from primary
infection.
Cohort study
In order to confirm that HSV-related tracheobronchitis or
pneumonia was associated with a higher mortality, and to
identify risk factors for this entity, a cohort study including 52
patients (after exclusion of one patient with HSV detection in
bronchoalveolar lavage but without symptoms related to HSV)
was performed. Tables 3 and 4 present the results of univariable analysis for the outcomes HSV-related tracheobronchitis
or pneumonia and death. Multiple logistic regression analysis

of HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia with the transfusion of a higher number of erythrocyte concentrates (Table
5).
Fatal outcome was associated with longer duration of ventilation, with bronchoscopy and with higher number of thrombocyte concentrate transfusions in multiple logistic regression
analysis (Table 5). For mathematical reasons HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia could not be included as a risk
factor in the logistic regression model, although it was the
most significant risk factor in univariable analysis (Table 4).
No other examined variable showed a significant association
with fatal outcome or with HSV-related tracheobronchitis or
pneumonia in multiple logistic regression analysis.
Molecular epidemiology
To address the question of endogenous reactivation versus
nosocomial transmission, all cluster patients' viruses were
subjected to molecular typing. Sequencing of the hypervariable region of the viral glycoprotein G revealed that patients'
viruses fell into two groups, with viral sequences of patients
C2 and C3 grouping together and with viral sequences of
patients C1, C7 and C8 grouping together (Figures 2 and 3).
Three cluster patients' viral isolates showed HSV-1
sequences that were not detected in other cluster patients'
viral isolates (isolates C4, C5 and C6; Figure 2).

As some viral genotypes are known to predominate even in
epidemiologically unrelated samples [16], analysis was
extended to other HSV isolates obtained during approximately
the same time period in the same hospital. Epidemiologically
unrelated virus isolates (isolates I2, I6, I8, M4, M6, M7, M9,
M12 and M13) that showed sequences identical to those of

the cluster patients were found in the group represented by
viral sequences C1, C7 and C8 (Figures 2 and 3). Viral
sequences of patients C2 and C3, however, showed a unique
sequence that was not identified in any of the epidemiologically unrelated isolates and could not be found in the NCBI
database. The C2/C3 viral sequence was characterized by a
deletion of six base pairs in a repeat region and a point mutation at position 110 (of the alignment of partial glycoprotein G
sequences) (Figure 3). Isolate C2 was obtained from a patient
with HSV-related tracheobronchitis. In contrast to that, the
patient from whom the viral sequence C3 was recovered did
not show symptoms associated with HSV detection. Those
two patients had overlapping stays on the SICU, and HSV was
detected in their bronchoalveolar lavages on consecutive days
(Figure 1).
Two out of 11 bronchoscope samples tested positive in the
HSV real-time PCR and were also subjected to the HSV glycoprotein G PCR and the nested glycoprotein G PCR. A PCR
product and sequence was obtained in only one case (viral
sequence B1; Figures 2 and 3). The viral sequence B1 clustered with patient isolate C6 and a group of other isolates not
epidemiologically related.

Discussion
HSV-1 detection in respiratory fluids of critically ill patients is
frequently reported but its clinical relevance is often uncertain
[5,7-9]. In our report the clinical relevance of HSV-1 detection
in the respiratory tract is clearly shown by the fact that six out
of eight patients with HSV-1 detection in their respiratory tract
presented with haemorrhagic tracheobronchitis and four of
the eight patients showed radiologic evidence of pneumonia.
Only one out of eight patients had no symptoms or signs consistent with HSV-1 infection (patient C3); this patient received

Figure 2

In agreement with our results a recent study showed that lower
respiratory tract infection with HSV was associated with
poorer outcome (prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation
and intensive care unit stay as well as more episodes of bacterial ventilator-associated pneumonia), although it was not
associated with increased mortality in their patient cohort [17].
Interestingly, the clinical picture was different, as tracheobronchial bleeding was not described as one of the predominant
symptoms [17].
Antiviral therapy with acyclovir initiated after diagnosis of HSV1 had been established in five of eight patients on average 2.9
days before death (data not shown). The therapy initiation,
however, seems to have been too late to improve outcome. In
case of endobronchial bleedings or bronchoscopic signs of
haemorrhagic tracheobronchitis, therefore, acyclovir treatment
should be initiated directly after bronchoscopy and specimen
sampling (prior to diagnosis of HSV-1 infection), which would
have been on average 8.6 days prior to death in our collective
(data not shown).

ganciclovir prophylaxis as part of a postlung-transplant care
regimen, which might have prevented development of a
clinically relevant HSV-1 infection and might be the reason
why virus culture was negative. Furthermore, the clinical
relevance of HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia in
critically ill patients is shown by its association with significantly increased mortality compared with patients without
HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia (100% versus
17.8%, P < 0.0001; Table 4). We therefore conclude that
HSV-1 reactivation in the respiratory tract accompanied by tracheobronchitis or pneumonia is clinically relevant and is associated with high mortality. It is not possible, however, to prove
to which extent HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia
contributed to the fatal outcome in our patients because all
patients suffered from other severe medical conditions.

Surgical procedures and critical illness result in immune dysfunction [18,19], which can be regarded as a predisposing
factor for HSV reactivation in the patients described here. The
vagal ganglia are thought to be the source of lower respiratory
and oesophageal HSV reactivation [20]. Mucosal damage
caused by intubation and mechanical ventilation, thoracic surgery or aspiration has been hypothesized to favour HSV reactivation [5,11,17,21,22]. Our observation that the interaction
between longer duration of ventilation and tracheotomy (which
was performed under bronchoscopic assistance) was a risk
factor for HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia in
logistic regression analysis may be explained by inoculation of
HSV-1-positive fluids from the upper respiratory tract via bronchoscopically assisted tracheotomy or by mechanical airway
irritation as a possible stimulus of reactivation. Whether longer
duration of ventilation or tracheotomy alone represent significant risk factors for HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia remains unclear because they were not identified as
independent risk factors in logistic regression analysis, and we
cannot exclude that the interaction between longer duration of
ventilation and tracheotomy indicates the severity of disease.
The most significant risk factor for fatal outcome identified in
univariable analysis was HSV-related tracheobronchitis or
pneumonia (P < 0.0001, Table 4). Owing to the fact that all
patients with HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia
died, this factor could not be included in the logistic regression model for mathematical reasons. Longer duration of ventilation, bronchoscopy and higher number of thrombocyte
concentrate transfusions were associated with fatal outcome
in the logistic regression analysis. These variables might be
surrogate markers for more severe illness rather than risk
factors.

Our investigation has the following limitations. Owing to initiation of the analysis in a suspected outbreak situation, systematic testing of respiratory samples for HSV was not performed
for all patients. The outcome was therefore defined clinically
(that is, presence or absence of HSV-related

tracheobronchitis or pneumonia) and not virologically
(absence of HSV detection). HSV pneumonia or HSV-related
tracheobronchitis was not confirmed by histopathology
because, clinically, the presence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis concurrent with HSV detection in respiratory fluids

in the absence of other respiratory pathogens was regarded
as sufficient for diagnosis and initiation of antiviral treatment.
The size of the cohort is rather small, a limitation that is inherent to outbreak investigations.
Worthy of note is the fact that two bronchoscope samples had
HSV-1 DNA detected after routine disinfection procedures.
Typing was successful in only one case (viral sequence B1),
which had a sequence identical to patient isolate C6 and to a
number of epidemiologically unrelated virus isolates (Figures 2
and 3). The bronchoscope sample B1, however, was collected more than 2 months later than the positive specimen of
patient isolate C6. An epidemiological association is therefore
unlikely. Furthermore, as no viable virus was recovered in virus
culture, the significance of this finding concerning the possibility of transmission is uncertain. Testing of bronchoscope samples was initiated when the cluster was already recognized
and first preventive measures had already been implemented.
We therefore could not clarify whether bronchoscopes were
the source of the suspected nosocomial transmission. Bronchoscopes, however, have been identified as sources of nosocomial transmission of other pathogens [23-26].
Studies examining HSV-1 detection in the respiratory tract of
intensive care unit patients have assumed HSV-1 positivity to
be caused by endogenous reactivation, and have not considered transmission although viruses were not typed [5,7-9].
HSV infections caused by nosocomial transmission, however,
have been reported in different settings [27-35]. In those studies, viruses were typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and almost identical restriction patterns have been
interpreted as proof of transmission. That approach, however,
does not take into account that some viral genotypes predominate in epidemiologically unrelated virus isolates [16]. Taking
this fact into consideration we extended our sequence-based
typing to epidemiologically unrelated virus isolates from the
same hospital.
We found three cluster patients with HSV-1 sequences that
were not detected in other cluster patients' viral isolates (isolates C4, C5 and C6; Figure 2). This finding favours endogenous reactivation as an underlying mechanism.
The group of three cluster patients with identical viral
sequences also showed identical sequences to nine epidemiologically unrelated isolates and to the reference strain F (Figure 2). Furthermore, the epidemiological association between
these three patients is weak (patient C1 stayed on the SICU
at the beginning of the cluster, and patients C7 and C8 at the
end; Figure 1). These findings favour the hypothesis that their
viruses are part of the predominating genotypes. One patient
pair (patients C2 and C3) that had a strong epidemiological
association (overlapping stay in the SICU, HSV diagnosis on
consecutive days; Figure 1) showed unique polymorphisms in
the HSV glycoprotein G sequence that were not identified in

Page 10 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

any other sequenced isolates nor in the NCBI database. In this
case we assume transmission to be likely. As both patients
were IgG-positive prior to HSV detection this could represent
nosocomial reinfection with a different virus strain. Patient C3
did not present with HSV-related tracheobronchitis but rather
with asymptomatic HSV infection, possibly because the ganciclovir prophylaxis he received prevented development of a
clinically relevant HSV infection.
As HSV isolates are not routinely typed it is possible that nosocomial transmission is not a rare event but might often not be
recognized as such.

Conclusion
In the present article we have shown that HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia represents an important infectious
complication in critically ill patients. This differential diagnosis
has to be considered especially in the case of tracheobronchial haemorrhage or if the patient's condition does not
improve with antibacterial and antifungal therapy. Whether
acyclovir prophylaxis or early treatment in cases suspicious for
HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia in critically ill
patients has the potential of preventing fatal outcome should
be addressed in future prospective studies.
Key messages
•

HSV-related tracheobronchitis or pneumonia is associated with high mortality in critically ill patients.

•

Tracheobronchial haemorrhage should prompt diagnostics for HSV.

•

Molecular typing of virus isolates revealed one event of
probable nosocomial transmission.
