Taming of the shrewd: novel eukaryotic genes
from RNA viruses
Eugene V Koonin*

Abstract
Genomes of several yeast species contain integrated DNA copies of complete genomes or individual genes of
non-retroviral double-strand RNA viruses as reported in a recent BMC Biology article by Taylor and Bruenn. The integrated virus-specific sequences are at least partially expressed and seem to evolve under pressure of purifying
selection, indicating that these are functional genes. Together with similar reports on integrated copies of some
animal RNA viruses, these results suggest that integration of DNA copies of non-reverse-transcribing RNA viruses
might be much more common than previously thought. The integrated copies could contribute to acquired
immunity to the respective viruses.
Commentary
In a recent BMC Biology article Taylor and Bruenn [1]
for the first time report a detailed molecular and evolutionary study of non-retroviral RNA virus genes integrated into eukaryotic genomes (hereinafter NIRV, nonretroviral integrated Rna viruses). The conclusions are
no less than stunning: not only are NIRV widespread in
fungi but they have become bona fide, functional genes.
For retroid viruses, integration into the host genomic
DNA is a regular stage of the reproduction cycle and
sequences derived from retroelements comprise almost
half of mammalian genomic DNA [2] and, strikingly,
>75% of the genomic DNA in some plants such as
maize [3]; in the more compact fungal genomes, retroelement-derived sequences are less abundant but also
common [4].
So far, NIRV have been a completely different story:
reliable reports of integration of DNA copies of non-retroviral RNA virus genes into host genomes can be
counted on the fingers of one hand. The idea that
reverse transcriptase (RT) present in eukaryotic cells
could produce NIRV was first championed by Zhdanov
soon after RT was discovered [5], followed by reports
on integrated copies of several, diverse single-stranded
RNA viruses [6,7]. However, these reports were not
independently confirmed [8], with one notable exception
where integrated virus-specific sequences were

discovered in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), leading to the intriguing hypothesis that the integrated copies might contributed to the
lifelong immunity of the survivor animals [9]. More
recently, long integrated sequences, apparently derived
from a novel flavivirus, were detected in the genomes of
Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes [10,11].
The change of tide for NIRV seems to come from the
recent work of Frank and Wolfe who surveyed the available genomes of Hemiascomycete fungi (Saccharomycotina) for sequences homologous to those of viruses and
plasmids, and detected over 10 inserts derived from
double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, the dominant class of
fungal RNA viruses [12], in 5 fungal species [13].
The work of Taylor and Bruenn [1] extends the results
of Frank and Wolfe through a detailed characterization
of NIRV derived from a specific family of dsRNA viruses
(Totiviridae, typified by the L-A virus of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae) in 5 fungal genomes, some of which carry
complete copies of viral genomes whereas others possess
only individual viral genes (Table 1), and adds several
key findings that demonstrate the biological relevance of
NIRV. First, Taylor and Bruenn unequivocally proved
that there is integration of dsRNA viral genomes into
the fungal genomes by polymerase chain reaction analysis of the boundaries between the integrated virus genome copy and the host DNA; the identification of the
chimeric sequences leaves no doubt that the virus-specific sequences are, indeed, integral to the fungal genome.
Second, it is shown that the NIRVs are completely, or

Expressed

Ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase;

partially, transcribed into polyadenylated mRNAs but no
dsRNA or viral particles are formed. Third, phylogenetic
analysis shows that NIRV sequences from relatively distant fungi form distinct clades in the trees of the homologous proteins of exogenous totiviruses [the capsid
protein (CP) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp)] suggesting that NIRVs spread by horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) between fungi. Fourth, and perhaps
most strikingly, a comparison of the NIRV sequences
from different fungal species shows that their ratio of
non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (Kn/Ks) is significantly less than 1 which is evidence of evolution under the pressure of purifying
selection [14] (although, judging from the Ka/Ks values,
that pressure is rather weak). The work of Taylor and
Bruenn provides no direct clues to the mechanism of
NIRV integration but there is no doubt that reverse
transcription takes place, most likely, with the RT provided by Ty retroelements. Very recently, the role of
endogenous retrotransposons in the LCMV integration
in mice has been demonstrated directly [15].

Taken together, these results indicate that the NIRV
in fungal genomes encode functional proteins. So what
could that function(s) be? A rather obvious possibility is
protection against infection with exogenous viruses and
the results of Taylor and Bruenn provide some indirect
support for this hypothesis. In addition to its function
as the CP protein, the totivirus CP is also an enzyme
that inactivates host mRNAs by removing their 5’ cap
(decapping enzyme) [16]. Comparison of the NIRVs
with homologous sequences of exogenous totiviruses
shows that the amino acid residues required for the decapping activity are mostly replaced in the NIRVs, in
accordance with the possibility that the NIRV-encoded
CP is a dominant-negative inhibitor of virus encapsidation; such a function is also compatible with the duplication of the CP gene in some of the fungal genomes
(Table 1; [1]). By contrast, the NIRV RdRp, at least the
version from Debaryomyces hansenii that is available in
GenBank (XM_457518), retains the catalytic residues
(EVK, unpublished observations), suggesting that it
could be enzymatically active. An intriguing speculation

Koonin BMC Biology 2010, 8:2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/2

is that the NIRV RdRp could contribute to antiviral
immunity by amplifying virus-specific transcripts that
might protect the cell via a RNA interference mechanism. Of course, it is impossible to rule out that NIRVs
and their protein products possess other, ‘normal’ cellular functions in addition to or even instead of their
putative roles in antivirus immunity. However, the
sporadic distribution of NIRV in fungal genomes and,
even more importantly, their likely spread via HGT
appear to be better compatible with the immunity
hypothesis.
The possibility that fungal NIRVs provide resistance
against exogenous viruses puts them into the context of
the burgeoning research area of ‘integration-based
immunity’. A novel form of acquired, adaptive antiviral
immunity that has been recently discovered in bacteria
and archaea is mediated by the so-called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)
system. This system functions by integrating small segments of virus (bacteriophage) DNA into specific loci in
the host genome and utilizing them to abrogate the cognate virus replication, most probably via an RNA interference-like mechanism [17,18]. The CRISPR system
functioning involves intricate, specialized molecular
mechanisms mediated by the Cas (CRISPR-associated)
genes [19]. The NIRV-mediated immunity, if a real phenomenon, seems to rely on more generic mechanism of
regular gene expression. The principle of acquired
immunity, nevertheless, would remain the same: capture
of virus-specific sequences and their subsequent use
against the virus. Integration-based immunity might be
even more widespread: recent reports reveal multiple
inserts of pararetrovirus sequences in a genome of
grapevine, a plant that appears to be resistant to active
viruses of this group [20] and inserts of short fragments
of both RNA and DNA viral genomes in insects and
crustaceans [21]. A tempting general speculation is that
integration of virus-specific sequences into the host genome resulting in acquired immunity is a ubiquitous
route of virus-host interaction that is manifest through a
plethora of specific mechanisms.
The second important message of the NIRV story is
the apparent relatively recent HGT between fungi [1].
The prevalence and roles of HGT in eukaryotic evolution is a rather controversial matter, with relatively few
iron-clad cases [22]. However, the observations on
NIRVs, along with the recent demonstration of multiple
acquisitions of bacterial genes by fungi [23] shows that,
although HGT is probably much less pervasive in eukaryotes than it is in prokaryotes, sequencing of multiple,
diverse eukaryotic genomes reveals substantial lateral
gene traffic. With the advent of the new generation of

sequencing methods, genomics is rapidly expanding, and
there is no doubt that we will be in for many more
surprises.
