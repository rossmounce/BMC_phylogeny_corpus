Abstract
Background: For many years, scientists believed that point mutations in genes are the genetic
switches for somatic and inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria and cancer.
Some of these mutations likely alter a protein's function in a manner that is deleterious, and they
should occur in functionally important regions of the protein products of genes. Here we show that
disease-associated mutations occur in regions of genes that are conserved, and can identify likely
disease-causing mutations.
Results: To show this, we have determined conservation patterns for 6185 non-synonymous and
heritable disease-associated mutations in 231 genes. We define a parameter, the conservation
ratio, as the ratio of average negative entropy of analyzable positions with reported mutations to
that of every analyzable position in the gene sequence. We found that 84.0% of the 231 genes have
conservation ratios less than one. 139 genes had eleven or more analyzable mutations and 88.0%
of those had conservation ratios less than one.
Conclusions: These results indicate that phylogenetic information is a powerful tool for the study
of disease-associated mutations. Our alignments and analysis has been made available as part of the
database at [http://cancer.stanford.edu/mut-paper/]. Within this dataset, each position is annotated
with the analysis, so the most likely disease-causing mutations can be identified.

Introduction
For many years, scientists believed that point mutations in
genes are the genetic switches for somatic and inherited
diseases such as cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria and cancer. For this to be the case, disease-associated amino acid
substitutions should occur in functionally important regions of the protein products of genes. While it has been
shown in specific cases that disease-associated amino acid
substitutions affect protein function, until now few studies have examined this across many genes. Here we provide direct evidence that disease-associated point
mutations occur in functionally important regions of the
genome and are not distributed equally across the coding

regions of genes. This work supports recent efforts to collect disease associated mutational data in databases and
suggests that many of the mutations represented in those
databases are the likely underlying molecular cause of disease.
Recently there have been a number of commercial and
public projects aimed at collecting and understanding human genomic variation [1]. The goal of these projects is to
provide an understanding of how genotype is associated
with disease, how it affects our response to drugs and how
it affects the protein products of genes. Examples of these
projects include the SNP Consortium, the Human GePage 1 of 5

nome Mutation Database [2], many gene specific databases ([3,4], for example), and both public and private
genome sequencing efforts [5]. Much of the data that is
being collected are mutations annotated with their observed phenotype. Automated annotation methods based
on structural and evolutionary parameters can lead to insight into the molecular basis of disease.
With more than 4,000,000 identified variations and with
over 20,000 of them annotated with a phenotype, we are
facing the problem of having many uncharacterized mutations. Algorithms are needed for automatically annotating these gene variations to gain insight into how they
affect the gene's regulation and/or function of its protein
products. Using many collection technologies, uncharacterized SNP data is being placed in public databases such
as the Human Genome Mutation Database (over 20,000
entries) [2] and the National Cancer Institute's CGAP-GAI
(Cancer Genome Anatomy Project Genetic Annotation Initiative) [6]. The CGAP-GAI group has identified 10,243
SNPs by examining publicly available EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) chromatograms.
Software for analyzing unannotated SNPs in known disease associated genes will be especially useful when previously unobserved mutations are discovered. Every human
has genotypic differences from the standard genome approximately every thousand base pairs [7–9]. Given
knowledge of how a genotype differs from the standard, it
is important to be able to predict which of the variations
are likely to be the cause of disease or other phenotypic
differences. Evolutionary information about regulatory
and coding regions of genes can be used to highlight certain mutations or groups of mutations that are attributable to a phenotype [10–12].
Early tools using phylogenetic and structural information
have shown promise in predicting the functional consequences of a mutation [13]. These reports predict that anywhere between 20–36% of non-synonymous SNPs alter
the function of a gene's protein product. In the report by
Chasman and Adams, evolutionary information was predicted to be a useful component in determining whether
a mutation is deleterious [13,14]. Disease causing mutations are also likely structurally perturbing at the protein
level [15]. Ng and Henikoff have introduced SIFT, a method for predicting functional SNPs from a database of unannotated polymorphisms [16,17].
The relationship between disease-associated mutation positions and evolutionary conservation has been reported
in specific cases. An analysis of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, showed that disease-associated mutations tend to occur in highly conserved
regions [18]. An analysis of homologous sequences in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/24

androgen receptor has shown similar results [10]. Keratin
12, KRT12, is associated with Meesmann Corneal Epithelial Dystrophy (MCD). Reported mutations often occur in
the highly conserved alpha-helix-initiation motif of rod
domain 1A or in the alpha-helix-termination motif of rod
domain 2B [19]. Structure based analysis methods have
also been used to analyze Osteogenesis imperfecta associated COL1A1 mutations and disease-associated P53 mutations (Mooney and Klein, unpublished),[20]. Miller
and Kumar have reported that disease-associated mutations are conserved in seven model genes [21].
To determine the degree to which mutation positions differ evolutionarily from other positions, we have built
alignments of homologous genes for 231 disease-associated genes. These multiple alignments have then been used
to assess the difference in evolutionary conservation for
positions that are both disease-associated and not associated. The results show that, in general, positions with disease-associated mutations are conserved more than the
average position in the alignment. This suggests the most
conserved mutations are likely to be the causative agents
of disease, and our data set identifies these mutations.

Results and Discussion
Our method compares the negative entropy of disease-associated columns within an alignment to other columns
in that alignment. The goal of this work is to build these
alignments, map the mutations to them, and show that
disease-associated positions are, in general, conserved.
The analysis was performed on the built alignments and
the results are shown in Table 1.
To collect the mutation data, 231 genes were used for the
analysis. They were chosen because they had a reported
cDNA sequence, disease-associated mutations and homologs in SWISSPROT. These genes are listed in Table 1.
Each alignment consists of all the homologs in SWISSPROT as determined by a BLAST search with an e-value
threshold of 10e-15. For each alignment the negative entropy for each column was calculated.
The conservation ratio parameter is defined as the average
negative entropy of analyzable positions with reported
mutations divided by the average negative entropy of every analyzable position in the gene sequence. Analysis was
performed on 231 genes and 6185 mutations and of those
we found that 84.0% had conservation ratios less than
one. From those, 139 genes had more than ten analyzable
mutations and, of those, 88.0% had conservation ratios
less than one.
Use of evolutionary information is a promising approach
to automated characterization of mutations. These results
show that although conservation alone is not a perfect

The mutations in these genes are perfectly conserved by our method. See text for details.

predictive measure, there is useful information contained
in sequence alignments containing homologous genes.
Approaches using conservation in a multiple alignment
should work better when associated with other methods
such as structural analysis, population analysis and experimental data. Knowledge of how the sequence pool clusters into families may increase the sensitivity of the
method.
Our measured parameter, the conservation ratio, is a
quantity that measures the usefulness of a multiple alignment for characterizing mutations in a gene sequence.
Knowledge of more mutations in a gene does not necessarily lower the conservation ratio. We expect that knowledge of more mutations in a gene will increase the
statistical significance of the conservation ratio. This is the
likely underlying cause of the result showing that genes
with 10 or mutations increases are more likely to have a
conservation ratio less than one.
The alignments and BLAST searches are integrated on the
website, [http://cancer.stanford.edu/mut-paper/].

Conclusions
In conclusion, there are estimated to be 30,000 non-synonymous differences between an individual and the draft
genome [23,5,7–9]. Determination of which positions are
likely to be disease associated is a challenging and important problem. The finding that disease-associated mutations occur in positions of functional importance
supports recent efforts for the building of methods to predict which positions are likely to be disease associated
[14,13,16,17]. These methods are likely to incorporate
protein structure, the amino acid identity of the mutation
and phylogenetic information. In an interesting twist, this
observation also suggests that this data may be useable as
a functional genomics tool for understanding the function
of the protein products of genes on a molecular level.
Such a method would use the inherent functional information contained in a phenotypically annotated polymorphism to infer functional importance within a gene.

Methods
Non-synonymous mutations were acquired from the Human Genome Mutation Database
[http://archive.uwcm.ac.uk/uwcm/mg/hgmd0.html]. 231 genes
were chosen with known disease-association each having
SWISSPROT homologs, a cDNA sequence and mutations
in the coding region. For each of those genes, all known
non-synonymous mutations were then downloaded with
the cDNA sequence for that gene.
Each cDNA sequence was then translated and placed in a
FASTA formatted file. For each of the resultant files a
BLAST [24] search was performed against the SwissProt
database. All sequences from the returned hits were then
stored in FASTA format files. For each of the genes that returned BLAST results with e-value scores smaller than 1e15, ClustalW [25] was used to build a sequence alignment.
For each amino acid in the position of interest, the negative entropy was determined using the following formula
[26]:

NE = −∑ P log P
AA

Where the Pi are the probabilities of finding a particular
amino acid at that position. For this analysis, gapped positions, "-", were considered independent amino acids.
For each known mutation, the negative entropy of the column it occupies was tabulated. The average negative entropy for each mutation within a gene was compared to
the average entropy of all columns satisfying the criteria
for analysis. Mutations outside of the coding region or
mutations encoding termination codons were discarded.
The list of genes was then sorted by average negative entropy of the mutations. We then calculated the conservation entropy, CE, using:

CE = average NE of mutation positions/average NE of all
positions in the gene sequence
