Abstract
HIV-1 infects gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) very early after transmission by multiple
routes. The infected GALT consequently serves as the major reservoir for HIV-1 infection and
could constantly shed HIV-1 and CD4+ T cells into the intestinal lumen. To examine this hypothesis,
we monitored HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA in fecal samples of chronically infected subjects
with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared this to levels of HIV-1 RNA/DNA in
urine and blood from the same subjects. Our results show that HIV-1 DNA, RNA and CD4 mRNA
were detected in 8%, 19% and 31% respectively, of feces samples from infected subjects with
detectable plasma viral load, and were not detected in any of subjects on ART with undetectable
plasma viral load. In urine samples, HIV-1 DNA was detected in 24% of infected subjects with
detectable plasma viral load and 23% of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load.
Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope sequences of HIV-1 revealed distinct virus populations in
concurrently collected serum, feces and urine samples from one subject. In addition, our study
demonstrated for the first time the presence of CD4 mRNA in fecal specimens of HIV-1 infected
subjects, which could be used to assess GALT pathogenesis in HIV-1 infection.

Introduction
Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissues (GALT) are very important in HIV pathogenesis. GALT is the largest single immunologic organ in the body, containing a large amount of
lymphocytes. Contrast to the blood and other organized
lymphoid tissues, which contain abundance of naive resting T cells, a majority of the CD4+ T cells that reside in
GALT are CCR5 positive, activated memory CD4 T cells

which are the preferred target cells for HIV/SIV infection
[1-3]. HIV infects GALT at a very early stage of infection
regardless of the route of infection and active HIV/SIV replication in GALT is present throughout the entire course of
infection, which leads to GALT acting as a major viral reservoir and results in mucosal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation that contributes to generalized
systemic immune activation and disease progression[2-6].

CD4+ T cells in the gut are rapidly infected and depleted
soon after infection[3,7] and CD4+ T cell repopulation of
the gut is prevented throughout infection[4]. We hypothesize that during HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 free virus and
infected/uninfected CD4+ T cells constantly shed from
GALT into the intestinal lumen and are discharged with
feces. Therefore, the amount of HIV-1 and CD4+ T cells
contained in the feces could reveal the degree of pathogenesis in GALT. Detection of HIV-1 has been reported in
fecal specimens from drug naïve HIV-1 infected individuals in the acute phase of infection [8-10]. There is no information on HIV-1 detection in the feces of chronically
infected subjects, especially in subjects undergoing
antiretroviral drug therapy (ART). Monitoring the
dynamic change of CD4+ T cells in GALT of infected individuals is very important to evaluate disease progression.
However, due to the anatomic location of GALT, invasive
and expensive biopsy is the only current method to monitor CD4+ T cell loss in GALT. In contrast, feces could be
an easily accessible, non-invasive and inexpensive specimen to assess CD4+ T cell depletion of GALT, since CD4+
T cells could shed into the intestinal lumen and be discharged in feces.
HIV-1 from seropositive individuals has been detected
from various body fluids including blood, semen, tears,
saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, breast milk and cervical secretions[11]. A broad spectrum of renal diseases has been
reported in HIV-1 infected AIDS subjects [12-14], yet
there is little information on the presence of HIV-1 in
urine. The presence of anti-HIV-1 antibodies has been
reported in urine by ELISA and Western blot [15,16] and
HIV-1 DNA has been detected in urine pellets from HIV-1
infected individuals [17,18]. However, it is not clear
whether urine from chronically infected persons with/
without ART contains HIV-1 DNA/RNA, and how virus in
urine is related to the viral load in serum.

from the subjects in four different groups: Group A: HIV1 negative; Group B: HIV-1 positive but not on ART;
Group C: HIV-1 positive on ART with non-detectable viral
load in blood; Group D: HIV-1 positive on ART with
detectable viral load in blood (Table 1).
Collection and storage of biological specimens
Fecal samples were collected in special stool collection
tubes (Sarstedt) and were stored in RNAlater solution
(Ambion) or Cell-Lysis buffer in -80C freezer within 6
hours of collection. Urine samples were processed within
6 hours of collection. Blood samples were collected from
all study participants at the same time as feces and urine.
Plasma, serum and PBMC were isolated from these blood
samples and used for CD4+ T cell counts and viral load
measurement.
HIV-1 infected cell line and HIV-1 positive plasma
The 8E5 cell line used in this study is derived from HIV-1
infected CD4+ CEM cells, and carries a single, integrated
and RT-defective HIV-1 genome[19]. The HIV-1 positive
plasma with viral load of 170,000 copies/ml was obtained
from a HIV-1 (subtype B) infected Brazilian blood donor.
8E5 cell line and HIV-1 positive plasma were added to
feces from HIV-1 negative persons before nucleic acid isolation to test the detection limit of HIV-1 DNA/RNA by
PCR.

Materials and methods

Extraction of RNA/DNA from feces samples
Two hundred milligrams of feces with or without 8E5
cells was used to isolate RNA/DNA with a nucleic acid isolation kit from Biomerieux following the manufacturer's
instructions. Briefly, specimens stored in 2 ml Cell-Lysis
buffer were thawed and mixed completely by vortexing.
Fifty microliters of silica bead suspension was added to
the fecal sample and the sample mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 10 min. with periodic vortexing and
centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1500 g. The supernatant was
removed and the pellet was washed five times: 2 times
with wash buffer, 2 times with 70% grade ethanol and 1
time with analytical grade acetone. The silica-nucleic acid
complexes were dried on a heat block at 56°C for 10 minutes and nucleic acids were eluted using 100 ul of elution
buffer. Eluted nucleic acids were immediately stored at 70°C for further use.

Study Participants
The uninfected and HIV-1 infected subjects in this study
were enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
(MACS) at Pittsburgh, PA. The MACS is an ongoing prospective natural history study of HIV-1 infection in homosexual and bisexual men enrolled at Baltimore, Chicago,
Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. The study was approved by
the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board
(IRB). Fecal specimens that were used in this study were
collected in 2008. Thirty-nine samples were collected

Extraction of RNA/DNA from urine samples
26-83 ml of urine were collected from the study participants and processed within 6 hours. The urine samples
were centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The
urine pellets were saved in -80°C for DNA isolation. The
urine supernatant was concentrated by a Centricon plus70 filter with molecular weight cutoff 100 kDa (Millipore)
according to manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, urine
supernatant was centrifuged in a pre-wet Centricon at 500

In this study, we detected HIV-1 RNA/DNA in fecal and
urine specimens from chronically HIV-1 infected subjects
with or without ART. In addition, we examined the presence of human CD4 mRNA in fecal specimens to assess
CD4+ T cell loss in GALT.

DNA was precipitated from the supernatant by isopropanol, washed by 70% ethanol and air dried. The DNA was
re-hydrated in nuclease free water and stored at -20°C for
subsequent PCR work.
Nested PCR and RT-PCR
Nested PCR and RT-PCR were performed on isolated
RNA/DNA samples from feces and urine to detect HIV-1
RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA. Specific primers listed in
Table 2 were used for optimal detection of HIV-1 subtype
B env and gag regions, human beta-globin DNA, human
beta-actin mRNA and CD4 mRNA.

First a cDNA strand was generated using Superscript II RT
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A 10 ul reaction consisting of
10 ug of RNA, 2 uM of primer, 10 mM dNTP mix, and
H2O was incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes. Following
incubation, 5× RT buffer, 0.1 M DTT, RNA guard (RNase)
(40 U/ul), and Superscript II RT (200 U/ul) were added
respectively. The reaction was incubated in a H2O bath at
42°C for 50 minutes followed by a second incubation in
dry bath at 70°C for 10 minutes. Amplification of specific
target sequences in the cDNA was performed using 10 μl
cDNA, forward and reverse primer pairs, dNTPs, Taq
polymerase buffer and Taq-polymerase in thermocycler
(Applied Biosystems) with cycling conditions of 94°C, 10
min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C, 1 min, 55°C, 1 min,
72°C, 1 min. Presence of the amplicon was analyzed on a
1%-2.5% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer.

Detection of fecal occult blood from feces samples
The fecal samples were tested for presence of occult blood
by a Hemoccult II SENSA kit (Beckman-Coulter). Trace
amount of the fecal sample was smeared onto an absorbent paper that has been treated with a chemical guaiac.
Hydrogen peroxide was dropped onto the fecal smear. If
trace amounts of blood were present, a blue color developed. A total of 39 fecal specimens from the study participants (Table 1) were tested. In addition, a normal donor

fecal sample was included as a negative control and normal donor fecal sample mixed with blood as a positive
control.
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products
The PCR product was purified from an agarose gel and
ligated into TOPO vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to manufacturer's instruction. Cloned plasmid
DNA was purified from transformed E. Coli using Wizard®

Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI) and digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme to
confirm the insertion. The plasmid DNAs with the insertions were then sequenced using M13 forward or M13
reverse primers. Sequences were assembled and error
checked using the Vector NTI 9.0 software (Invitrogen)
and aligned with reference sequences from GenBank by
the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment programs
from Mega 4.0.

Results
Evaluation of the sensitivity of the PCR detection of HIV-1
DNA/RNA in human feces
To test the sensitivity of amplifying HIV-1 DNA, 200 mg
of normal donor fecal sample was mixed with different
concentrations of HIV-1 positive 8E5 cells. Nucleic acid
was isolated using NUCLISENS (BIOMERIEUX) nucleic
acid isolation kit. For every DNA sample, the human betaglobin gene was PCR amplified to ensure that the isolated
DNA was amplifiable and contained the comparable
amount of human DNA. Subsequently, a nested PCR reaction was performed to detect HIV-1 DNA from the isolated DNA using HIV-1 env specific primers. HIV-1 DNA
was detected from the DNA isolated from normal donor
feces mixed with 8E5 cells and the detection limit was as
low as 2.5 copies/reaction (data not shown).

To test the sensitivity of amplifying HIV-1 RNA, 200 mg of
normal donor feces were mixed with a series of different
concentrations of HIV-1 positive plasma (with known
HIV-1 RNA copies) and nucleic acid was isolated as before
followed by RT nested PCR with HIV-1 env specific RT and
PCR primers. As a human RNA input control in each sample, cDNA was synthesized by random hexamer followed
by nested PCR amplification using human beta-actin
mRNA specific primers. HIV-1 RNA was detected from
normal feces mixed with HIV-1 positive plasma and the
detection limit was as low as 40 copies/reaction (data not
shown).
Detection of HIV-1 DNA/RNA in feces
Four groups of study participants were recruited in 2008
(Table 1). Group A: 10 HIV-1 negative individuals; Group
B: 11 HIV-1 infected individuals, who are drug naïve with
detectable viral load in plasma ranging from 428 to
78,636 and CD4+ T cell count ranging from 149 to 923.
Group C: 13 HIV-1 infected individuals, who are on ART
with undetectable viral load in plasma and CD4+ T cell
count ranging from 385 to 922. Group D: 5 HIV-1
infected individuals, who are on ART with detectable viral
load in plasma ranging from 186 to 33,751 and CD4+ T
cell counts ranging from 152 to 540. Nucleic acids isolated from 200 mg feces were subjected to nested-PCR for
amplification of HIV-1 env C2-V5 region. For every DNA
sample, the human beta-globin gene was PCR amplified
to ensure the comparable amount of human DNA con-

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/6/1/20

tained in each PCR reaction. The beta-globin gene was
detected in 17 out of 39 fecal specimens. Among these 17
beta-globin positive samples, one was from Group A, 8
from Group B, 3 from Group C and 5 from Group D.
However, HIV-1 DNA was detected only in one fecal specimen from a patient (not on ART) with detectable viral
load (XX495, viral load 35,471, Group B) (data not
shown).
Nucleic acids isolated from 200 mg of fecal specimen were
subjected to RT nested-PCR. To serve as the human RNA
input control for each sample, human beta-actin mRNA
was amplified by RT nested PCR amplification. As shown
in Figure 1A, relatively equal amounts of beta-actin mRNA
were detected from all isolated fecal RNA, whereas HIV-1
RNA was detected in 3 out of 16 (19%) subjects with
detectable viral load in blood (Figure 1A &1B).
Confirmation of PCR specificity by using primers for
another region (gag) of HIV-1 genome and sequencing the
PCR products after cloning into a vector
To confirm the specificity of PCR amplification of env
region in feces samples, the HIV-1 gag region was also
amplified in these samples using gag specific primers. Two
out of three HIV-1 env targeted-PCR positive and two out
of two env negative fecal RNA samples maintained the
identical outcome using gag specific primers. Furthermore, cloning and sequencing of the PCR product using
env specific primers from the fecal samples demonstrated
that the PCR products were HIV-1 subtype B env
sequences (data not shown).
Detection of human CD4 mRNA from the fecal samples
To monitor CD4 mRNA contained in the fecal samples,
nucleic acids isolated from the fecal samples were subjected to RT nested PCR using CD4 mRNA specific primers. Human CD4 mRNA specific 110 bp PCR product was
detected in 5 out of 16 (32%) subjects with detectable
viral load in blood (Figure 2). Three of the detected 5 subjects were not on ART and 2 subjects were on ART. In contrast, no CD4 mRNA was detected in any HIV-1
uninfected donor's fecal specimens or infected donors
with undetectable viral loads.
Detection of fecal occult blood from the fecal samples
To detect the possible blood content in the fecal samples,
an occult blood test was performed in all fecal specimens
as described in Materials and Methods section. As shown
in Table 3, fecal blood was detected in 7 out of 39 fecal
specimens: 2 from Group A, 1 from Group B, 3 from
Group C and 1 from Group D. The fecal occult blood test
was negative for the fecal samples which were positive for
HIV-1 RNA or DNA. One of the five CD4 mRNA positive
fecal specimens was positive for occult blood and the
remaining samples were negative.

Detection of HIV-1 DNA/RNA from the urine samples
The HIV env region was amplified from the DNA purified
from the urine pellet in a nested-PCR reaction using the
env primers described previously. For each DNA sample,
human beta-globin gene was also PCR amplified to
ensure the comparable amount of human DNA contained
in each PCR reaction. All 34 urine pellet samples were
positive for beta-globin amplification. HIV-1 DNA was
detected in 7 urine pellet samples from HIV infected subjects, 4 from subjects with detectable viral load, and 3
from subjects with undetectable viral load (Table 3). Furthermore, RNA purified from the 34 urine supernatants
was tested by RT nested-PCR to detect HIV env region.
HIV-1 RNA was detected in one urine sample from a
patient with detectable viral load.

Sequence analysis of the HIV-1 envelope gene amplified
from serum, feces and urine samples from an HIV-1
infected subject
In one subject from Group B with viral load 18,231 copies/ml in blood, HIV-1 env was PCR detected in all three
samples collected concurrently: serum, urine and feces.
The PCR products corresponding to the C2-V5 region of
HIV-1 env gp120 from all three compartments were
cloned and sequenced to determine the viral diversity. A
phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining
method as implemented in Mega 4.0. The validity of the
branching orders was estimated with 1000 replicates. Reference strains were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV
database by using similar blast search. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the sequences belong to HIV-1 sub-

type B. Blood-, fecal- and urine- derived sequences formed
a tightly clustered group of sequences respectively. However, the sequence analysis also showed a distributed pattern of viral variants among blood, feces and urine,
indicating that distinct HIV-1 quasispecies existed in different part of tissues within the subject (Figure 3).

Discussion
Many viral pathogens have been detected in feces, such as
astrovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, calcivirus, adenovirus

and hepatitis C virus[20,21]. However, no comprehensive
studies have been performed so far on the fecal samples
from HIV-1 infected subjects. Furthermore, no studies
have evaluated HIV-1 and CD4 mRNA level in feces from
subjects at chronic stages of disease with or without ART.
GALT contains an abundant amount of CD4+ T cells to
maintain the mucosal immunity and is an important tissue for HIV replication in HIV infection. Ideally to monitor HIV-1 related GALT pathogenesis, a GI biopsy should

be performed regularly to evaluate the dynamic changes
of CD4+ T cells and viral load in GALT. However, such
studies are very difficult and expensive to implement. We
hypothesized that during the massive HIV-1 replication
and CD4+ T cell depletion in GALT, HIV-1 and CD4+ T
cells shed into the intestinal lumen and the amount of
HIV-1 and CD4+ T cells in the feces would associate with
the pathogenic changes in GALT.
Since the components of human feces are very complex
and so far no sensitive methods are available for detection
of viral and human RNA/DNA in human feces, we have
initially tested assay sensitivity for nucleic acid isolation
and detection of HIV-1 DNA/RNA in feces. Our results
showed that HIV-1 DNA was detected from normal donor
feces mixed with 8E5 cells with the detection limit of 2.5
copies of HIV-1 DNA/reaction. HIV-1 RNA was detected
from normal feces mixed with HIV-1 positive plasma with
detection limit of 40 copies of HIV-1 RNA/reaction. To
evaluate usage of fecal specimens to monitor HIV-1 associated GALT pathogenesis, we collected the feces samples
from HIV-1 uninfected and infected donors with or without ART.
In the 49 fecal samples collected in 2007 and 2008, HIV1 DNA was detected in 1 subject from Group B (HIV-1
infected but not on ART) with detectable viral load of
35,471 copies/ml in plasma. HIV-1 RNA was detected in
4 subjects from Group B with viral load ranging between
14,690 and 55,396 copies/ml in plasma and in one subject from Group D (HIV-1 infected on ART) with detectable viral load of 16,862 copies/ml in plasma. Specificity of
the HIV-1 detection was confirmed by amplifying HIV-1
gag region in these env positive samples. In the selected 5
feces samples, identical results were observed in 4 samples
with the gag primers. One HIV-1 env positive feces sample
was detected negative with gag primers. This might be due
to the extremely low copy number of HIV-1 genomes contained in the sample, which could lead to limited PCR
detection in the multiple PCR amplifications. Hoek at
al[8] reported that no HIV-1 proviral DNA was detected,
but HIV-1 RNA was detected in 67% of subjects' fecal samples by RT-nested PCR. Since the subjects involved in their
study were in early stages of HIV-1 infection, when the
rapid replication of HIV-1 and destruction of lymphoid
tissues occurred in GALT, levels of HIV-1 shedding from
GALT to intestinal lumen might be higher compared to
the later chronic phase of infection.
The gastrointestinal tract is the major reservoir of viral
infected cells and the site of rapid and profound loss of
CD4 T cells, which could be the result from HIV direct killing of CD4-expressing primarily infected cells, HIV indirect killing of bystander cells through HIV proteins and/or
by the proinflammatory state that is associated to ongoing

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/6/1/20

viral replication[22]. One subset of CD4+ T cells in GALT
is Th17 cells characterized by the production of IL-17,
which are involved in epithelial regeneration and membrane barrier function. HIV/SIV-mediated Th17 depletion
from GALT[23] impairs the gastrointestinal barrier and
leads to translocation of intestinal microbes or microbial
products, which then contribute to immune activation
and disease progression[24,25]. We hypothesize that during CD4 T cell depletion, the depleted cells could shed
into intestinal lumen through the impaired GI barrier and
be discharged in feces. Because of the persistent active
viral replication in GALT, CD4 positive cells are constantly
lost from the GI tract throughout infection. Since cells and
cellular proteins are degraded very quickly in the lumen of
gastrointestinal tract, CD4 mRNA in feces has been monitored instead as a surrogate marker to evaluate CD4 T
cells contained in the feces. However, it is possible that
some of the detected CD4 mRNA were from macrophages
and dendritic cells since these cells express CD4 as well.
All feces samples were screened for CD4 mRNA, a surrogate marker for CD4+ T cells. No CD4 mRNA was detected
in any feces samples from the HIV-1 negative donors or
HIV-1 infected with undetectable plasma viral load, but
CD4 mRNA was detected in 5 out of 16 fecal samples
from the subjects with detectable plasma viral load, 3
from group B (HIV-1 infected not on ART) and 2 from
group D (HIV-1 infected on ART with detectable plasma
viral load). These results suggest that CD4+ T cells were
shed from GALT to intestinal lumen in the infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load.
Detection of blood in feces has long been regarded as an
indicator of subject's state of health[26]. HIV-1 RNA/DNA
and CD4 mRNA detected in the fecal specimens of HIV-1
infected subjects could be the result either from internal
bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or from shedding of
HIV-1 infected cells and free virus from GALT. To dissect
these two possibilities, fecal occult blood test was performed in all samples. As listed in Table 3, a total of 7 fecal
samples were positive in the test: 2 from Group A, 1 from
Group B, 3 from Group C and 1 from Group D. All fecal
samples positive for HIV-1 RNA/DNA were negative in the
occult blood test. Thus, HIV-1 RNA/DNA detected in the
fecal samples could be the result of the shedding of HIV-1
infected cells and/or free virus from GALT into the intestinal lumen.
HIV-1 has been detected in a variety of body fluids and
secretions including blood, semen, vaginal fluids and
breast milk. Li et al. [17] in 1992 reported the presence of
HIV-1 DNA proviral sequences in fresh urine pellets from
HIV-1 seropositive individuals. However, the presence of
HIV-1 in urine from chronic infected subjects with or
without ART has not been addressed. Our data show that

compartments (blood, GI tract and urine system) was
evaluated. The sequencing analysis of HIV-1 env C2-V5
region from concurrently collected fecal, urine and blood
specimens revealed that HIV-1 compartmentalization was
present in the three compartments of this subject.
In summary, this cross-sectional study indicates that the
sensitive PCR based method is suitable for HIV-1 DNA/
RNA and CD4 mRNA detection in feces and urine samples
from HIV-1 infected individuals. In addition, HIV-1 compartmentalization was revealed in gut, renal system and
blood in one infected subject. The presence of HIV-1
RNA/DNA in fecal and urine samples from HIV-1 infected
subjects is lesser in the chronic stage of infection compared to the acute stage of infection. Our results suggest
that feces could be an informative specimen in clinic for
detecting HIV and CD4 mRNA. Since a small sample size
was used in the current study, future longitudinal studies
are needed to show whether there is a correlation of detection of HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA in feces with
disease progression.

HIV-1 DNA and RNA were detected in both the urine pellet and the supernatant from the HIV-1 infected subjects
(Table 3). HIV-1 DNA was detected in 7 urine pellet samples from the 29 HIV-1 infected subjects, 4 of the 7 samples from subjects (2 subjects were not on ART and 2
subjects on ART) with detectable plasma viral load, and 3
from subjects (who were on ART) and with undetectable
viral load. This result indicates that the detection of HIV1 in urine is not necessarily associated with plasma viral
load.
Due to the tissue-specific anatomical structures and local
immunological components, virus replication in different
tissues in infected individual could result in the diversity
of HIV populations. It has been reported that HIV compartmentalization was present between blood and feces/
gastrointestinal tissues[8-10,27], between blood and urogenital/genital tract [28-30], and SIV compartmentalization between blood and brain/cerebrospinal fluid[31,32].
