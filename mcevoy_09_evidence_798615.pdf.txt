Abstract
Background: PPE38 (Rv2352c) is a member of the large PPE gene family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related
mycobacteria. The function of PPE proteins is unknown but evidence suggests that many are cell-surface associated and
recognised by the host immune system. Previous studies targeting other PPE gene members suggest that some display
high levels of polymorphism and it is thought that this might represent a means of providing antigenic variation. We have
analysed the genetic variability of the PPE38 genomic region on a cohort of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates representing
all of the major phylogenetic lineages, along with the ancestral M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) member M. canettii, and
supplemented this with analysis of publicly available whole genome sequences representing additional M. tuberculosis
clinical isolates, other MTBC members and non tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Where possible we have extended
this analysis to include the adjacent plcABC and PPE39/40 genomic regions.
Results: We show that the ancestral MTBC PPE38 region comprises 2 homologous PPE genes (PPE38 and PPE71),
separated by 2 esat-6 (esx)-like genes and that this structure derives from an esx/esx/PPE duplication in the common
ancestor of M. tuberculosis and M. marinum. We also demonstrate that this region of the genome is hypervariable due to
frequent IS6110 integration, IS6110-associated recombination, and homologous recombination and gene conversion
events between PPE38 and PPE71. These mutations result in combinations of gene deletion, gene truncation and gene
disruption in the majority of clinical isolates. These mutations were generally found to be IS6110 strain lineage-specific,
although examples of additional within-lineage and even within-cluster mutations were observed. Furthermore, we
provide evidence that the published M. tuberculosis H37Rv whole genome sequence is inaccurate regarding this region.
Conclusion: Our results show that this antigen-encoding region of the M. tuberculosis genome is hypervariable. The
observation that numerous different mutations have become fixed within specific lineages demonstrates that this
genomic region is undergoing rapid molecular evolution and that further lineage-specific evolutionary expansion and
diversification has occurred subsequent to the lineage-defining mutational events. We predict that functional loss of these
genes could aid immune evasion. Finally, we also show that the PPE38 region of the published M. tuberculosis H37Rv whole
genome sequence is not representative of the ATCC H37Rv reference strain.

Background
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome contains two large
gene families that together comprise around 10% of its
protein coding capacity [1]. These families, termed PE and
PPE, appear to have originated in the fast growing mycobacterial species before undergoing extensive expansion
and diversification in certain slow growing species, particularly M. ulcerans, M. marinum and members of the M.
tuberculosis complex (MTBC) [2]. The large multi-protein
families encoded by these genes are of unknown function,
although reports suggest that at least some members are
cell surface associated [3-6] and can be antigenic [4,5,7-9],
a finding that has stimulated interest in their potential
role in vaccine production, e.g. [10,11]. PPE proteins contain a proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) amino acid
sequence at positions 7-9 in a highly conserved N-terminal domain of approximately 180 amino acids. The C-terminal domains of both PE and PPE protein families are
highly variable in both size and sequence and often contain repetitive DNA sequences that differ in copy number
between genes [1]. Several studies have shown that some
PE and PPE genes are polymorphic and this has been
interpreted as indicating strong selection pressure for antigenic variants that may aid in host immune evasion
[3,7,12-17].
A recent phylogenetic analysis of the 69 PPE genes present
in the M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv has uncovered their evolutionary relationships and reveals that they
can be divided into several subfamilies [2] (Figure 1).
PPE38 (Rv2352c) is shown to be a member of PPE sublineage IV (the SVP subfamily) and analysis of its protein
sequence confirms that it encodes the SVP subfamilydefining amino acid sequence (GxxSVPxxW) at positions
309 - 317. However, along with the closely related gene
PPE49 (Rv3125c), it shares a more recent common ancestor with PPE sublineage V members (the MPTR subfamily) than with any other member of the SVP
sublineage (Figure 1). Although no reports are available
regarding its antigenicity or other biochemical features,
because of its position on the "border" of sublineages IV
and V, PPE38 was included in a larger study aimed at
determining the genetic variation of PE and PPE genes
between various strains of M. tuberculosis (manuscript in
preparation). Here we present our analysis of this gene
and its surrounding region using a cohort of phylogenetically diverse and well-defined M. tuberculosis clinical isolates representing all of the major phylogenetic lineages,
along with the most ancestral MTBC divergent member,
M. canettii. This has been supplemented by in silico analysis of this genomic region in the whole genome sequences
of 15 publicly available M. tuberculosis strains, 8 other
MTBC members (M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, M. microti, 3 × M.
africanum, dassie bacillus and oryx bacillus), and 14 non
tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species (7 fast growing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/237

species and 7 slow growing species). We show that this
region is hypervariable in MTBC members and that this
has resulted in a rapid rate of genetic divergence occurring
between most M. tuberculosis strain lineages.

Results
Identification of the variable PPE38 region and the RvD7
deletion
The published M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome sequence [1]
predicts the amplification of a 1335 bp PCR product spanning the entire PPE38 gene when using the PPE38F/R
primer pair (Figure 2a, Table 1). However, our analysis of
3 M. canettii clinical isolates, the H37Rv and H37Ra American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference strains
(ATCC numbers 25618 and 25177 respectively), and 40
M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from different IS6110
RFLP-defined strain lineages covering all three principal
genetic groups (PGGs) [18], revealed that only 7 strains
produced this amplicon. Most samples (including the
H37Rv and H37Ra ATCC reference strains and the 3 M.
canettii's) produced a dominant amplicon of approximately 3.4 kb, while other samples produced amplicons
of alternate sizes varying from approximately 2.5 to 5 kb,
and 3 samples failed to amplify. Analysis of the H37Ra
whole genome sequence revealed that the 3.4 kb amplicon (actual predicted size = 3398 bp) results from the
presence of a second copy of PPE38 along with 2 esat-6
(esx)-like genes (annotated as MRA_2374 and MRA_2375
in H37Ra) in this region (Figure 2b) [19]. The second
copy of PPE38 has been previously identified and designated as PPE71 in the CDC1551 whole genome sequence
[20]. Its coding region is identical to PPE38 and both
genes also share the same 5'-untranslated region up to
position -35 bp. As previously suggested by Zheng and
colleagues [19], this genomic structure suggests that the
published H37Rv sequence represents the result of a
homologous recombination event between PPE38 and
PPE71 that has deleted one of these genes along with
MRA_2374 and MRA_2375. This deletion is annotated as
RvD6 in their analysis of the H37Ra whole genome
sequence [19]. However, the authors did not acknowledge
that the term RvD6 was appropriated in 2005 to define a
specific variation between the M. bovis and H37Rv
genomes [21]. For purposes of clarity and uniformity we
therefore propose that the this deletion rather be termed
RvD7.
Detailed analysis of the PPE38 region
In order to analyse the variation in this region more thoroughly, we designed additional primers (PPE38IntF/IntR,
Table 1, Figure 2b) to allow PCR analysis and sequencing
of the region between PPE38 and PPE71. Sequence analysis of the complete 3.4 kb product produced using the
PPE38F/R primers in the H37Rv ATCC reference strain,
one M. canettii and 4 of our clinical M. tuberculosis isolates

Schematic representations of the PPE38 gene region in the H37 reference strain published sequences. The
PPE38 region from the published H37Rv (2a) and H37Ra (2b) sequences are shown. Colour coding as follows: PPE38 pale blue,
PPE71 dark blue, MRA_2374 pale green, MRA_2375 dark green. Locations of the PPE38F/R and PPE38 IntF/R primers are
shown. 2a. H37Rv ATCC reference strain (published whole genome sequence) The published H37Rv sequence [1]
represents the RvD7 genotype. Recombination between PPE38 and PPE71 results in a single PPE38/71 gene (Rv2352c) and loss
of the 2 esx-like genes MRA_2374 and MRA_2375. The PPE38F/R primers (black arrows) are predicted to produce an amplicon of 1335 bp from the RvD7 genotype. It is impossible to determine which PPE38/71 gene has been deleted hence the mixture of colours used. The published H37Rv sequence is not representative of the H37Rv ATCC reference strain, most clinical
isolates, or the H37Ra whole genome sequence [19]. This genotype is also seen in strains SAWC 2240 (CAS, F20), SAWC
1748 (Pre-Haarlem, F24), SAWC 1595 (Quebec/S), SAWC 1841 (Haarlem, F4), CPHL_A (WA-1, M. africanum), T17 (PGG1,
EAI), EAS054 (PGG1, EAI), strain C (LCC, "3 bander") and Haarlem (PGG2, F4) [see additional file 1]. 2b. H37Rv ATCC reference strain (actual) and H37Ra (published whole genome sequence) This represents the ancestral MTBC genotype
that is also seen in M. canettii. It contains the 2 identical PPE38 (MRA_2373) and PPE71 (MRA_2376) genes separated by the 2
esx-like genes MRA_2374 and MRA_2375. Gene annotations are as reported for the H37Ra published sequence [19]. Locations of primers used for PCR and sequence analysis are indicated (black arrows). This is also the true genotype of the ATTC
reference strain H37Rv.

confirmed its complete homology to the published
sequence of H37Ra [19] apart from 3 SNPs observed in M.
canettii and one SNP in isolate SAWC 1870 that are
described below. The discrepancy between our H37Rv
ATCC reference isolate and the published H37Rv
sequence was further investigated by PCR analysis from
DNA derived from three additional independent cultures
of H37Rv from different sources, including one that had
been newly purchased from the ATCC. In each case the
H37Ra-like genotype (Figure 2b) was confirmed and not
the published H37Rv RvD7 genotype (Figure 2a, data not
shown). The two additional M. canettii isolates were also
analysed with these PCRs and the H37Ra-like genotype
was also confirmed (data not shown). A complete list of
PPE38 genotypes representing all analysed samples, comprising H37Rv, H37Ra, all 40 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from our cohort, 3 M. canettii clinical isolates plus 15
M. tuberculosis and 8 non-M. tuberculosis members of the
MTBC (analysed in silico from publicly available whole
genome sequences - see below), along with group, lineage
(F) and mutation details is listed in additional file 1.
Analysis of clinical isolates displaying alternate PPE38
region genetic structures and determination of lineage
specificity
The PPE38 region of clinical isolates that produced PCR
amplicons of sizes that did not correspond to the H37Ralike genotype were analysed in more detail by sequencing
PCR amplicons. In order to characterize IS6110-associated
mutations, the IS5' and Xho1 primers were used (Table 1).
Twelve isolates possessed IS6110-mediated mutations,
with two of these also displaying indels involving presumably recombination-mediated swapping of parts of the 5'
untranslated regions of PPE38 and PPE71. One isolate
revealed a 5'-untranslated region indel without an accompanying IS6110 mutation. Four isolates displayed the
RvD7 genotype as defined by the H37Rv whole genome
sequence (Figure 2a). The final isolate failed to produce
PCR product when using any of the PPE38-associated

primer pairs, although PCRs directed at other regions of
the genome were successful. We conclude that this isolate
possesses a large deletion in the PPE38 region. Details and
figures of the characterized mutations can be found in
additional files 1 and 2 (S1 - S18). Additional clinical isolates were investigated in many cases in order to determine whether specific characterized mutations were
IS6110 lineage-, cluster-, or isolate-specific. Results
showed that in most cases the mutation was specific to all
of the different clusters analysed from within the lineage,
although several instances of within-lineage and even
within-cluster variation was observed. Details of this analysis can be found in additional file 2 (S1 - S18).
In silico analysis of the PPE38 region in M. tuberculosis
and other MTBC member whole genome sequences
The results obtained from our clinical isolates encouraged
us to further investigate the genomic structure of this
region in isolates whose whole genome sequences are
publicly available. Along with the H37Rv and H37Ra
sequences previously described we also analysed the
region in 13 M. tuberculosis and 6 non-M. tuberculosis
MTBC members for which the whole genome sequences
are publicly available. For convenience, although the dassie and oryx bacillus genomes have not been completed,
we have included known information on their PPE38
regions [22,23] in this section, thus providing a total of 21
additional MTBC genomes for analysis. Surprisingly, only
4 of these genomes (H37Ra, CDC1551 and M. africanum
isolates GM041182 and K85) displayed the "normal"
(ancestral) H37Ra-like PPE38 genotype of 2 PPE genes
separated by 2 esx-like genes (Figure 2b). Six genomes
(including H37Rv) displayed the RvD7 genotype (Figure
2a). Six genomes displayed various IS6110-associated
mutations that, in some cases, were associated with additional indel mutations. The remaining 7 genomes, including all of the non-human animal-associated organisms,
displayed large RD5 and RD5-like [24,25] deletions that
spanned the entire PPE38 region including adjacent
genes. Details and figures of all the characterized muta-

tions can be found in the additional files 1 and 2 (S19 S32). A schematic representation of the 7 large RD5 and
RD5-like deletions can be seen in Figure 3.
Analysis of micro-mutations within the PPE38/71 gene
sequences
Along with the macro-mutational events described above,
the PPE38 region of 15 isolates from our cohort plus the
fully sequenced genomes were also examined for mutations at the micro-mutational level. Apart from the 21del
mutation which is described below, only 4 isolates (M.
canettii, SAWC 1870, KZN 4207 and K85) were confirmed
to possess micro-mutations. These are detailed in additional file 1. These results demonstrate that micromutations within the PPE38 region are rare.
Analysis of the 21del mutation
The 21del mutation consists of an in-frame 21 bp deletion

tially identified in PPE71 of the CDC1551 whole genome
sequence as well as in our clinical isolate SAWC 1645
(Haarlem, F10). The M. tuberculosis strain C, which possesses the RvD7 deletion, also shows this mutation, demonstrating that PPE38, rather than PPE71, has been
deleted in this case. Interestingly, while all are PGG2
members, SAWC 1645 belongs to F10 of the Haarlem lineage while CDC1551 and strain C belong to the LCC lineage ("4 banders" and "3 banders" respectively). In order
to further track the presence of the 21del mutation in our
clinical isolates, PCR primers were designed to distinguish
between the 21del (90 bp) and wild type (111 bp) genotypes (Table 1). This PCR was initially performed on all
PGG2 isolates from our cohort. Results revealed the presence of this mutation in all 4 members of the LCC ("2, 3,
4 and 5 banders") as well as in 5 of 8 lineages representing
the Haarlem, Pre-Haarlem and Haarlem-like clades (Figure 4). A simplified phylogenetic tree of PGG2 lineages in
relation to their 21del genotypes is shown in Figure 5. All

LCC members showed a "heterozygote-like" "2, WT/
21del" (2 genes, 1 wild type, 1 21del) genotype, suggesting the CDC1551-like structure, while results for the
Haarlem lineages were more variable with "homozygotelike" signals for both the wild type and 21del genotype
observed (Figures 4 and 5). In these cases PPE38F/R and
PPE38IntF/IntR PCRs were used to determine the number
of PPE38/71 genes present and thus distinguish between
recombination (1 gene) and gene conversion (2 genes)
events. Figure 5 shows that recombination and gene conversion events were observed within the F1, 2, 4, 10, 19
and 24 Haarlem lineages. Mutational analysis of the 2
Haarlem-like lineages (F6 and F7) suggests that the 3'
region of PPE38, including the region corresponding to
the 21del position in PPE71, has been removed by an
IS6110-associated mutation [see additional file 2, S11 and
S12]. The "1, 21del" genotype seen in both these lineages
is therefore not due to recombination with deletion of
PPE38.

(including the Haarlem F4, CDC1551 and strain C whole
genome sequences), representing 5 LCC and 8 Haarlem
lineages (including Haarlem, Pre-Haarlem and Haarlemlike lineages) were analysed. Of these, 5 isolates (5.6%)
displayed an altered genotype compared to the standard
genotype observed within their lineage. Where genotypic
changes were observed the PPE38F/R and PPE38IntF/IntR
PCRs were again used to differentiate between recombination and gene conversion events (Table 2) No cases of
within-cluster genotypic alterations were observed.

We next performed the 21del PCR on additional isolates

determine whether the observed genotypes were cluster or
lineage-specific and also to investigate any additional
instances of gene conversion or recombination. Four LCC

shown in Table 2 and show that 90 additional isolates

Analysis of the plcABC genes from publicly available
whole genome sequences
Previous reports have revealed that the genomic region
adjacent to PPE38 encompassing the three phospholipase
(plc) gene loci plcA, plcB and plcC is subjected to frequent
deletions and IS6110 insertions [26-30]. We therefore also
examined this region in the 15 publicly available M. tuberculosis whole genome sequences and 8 non-M. tuberculosis

were observed. These included SNPs, micromutations that
resulted in frameshifts and altered amino acid incorporation, IS6110 integration and a case of gene fusion between
plcA and plcB in isolate 02_1987. Some of the observed
SNPs were found to be lineage-specific. For example, a
sSNP (A → C) at position 435 of plcA distinguished all
"ancient" strains (TBD1+) from "modern" strains (TBD1) [31]. Large RD5 and RD5-like deletions have been previ-

In isolates that possess both a normal and a 21del gene copy an additional amplicon of approximately 100 bp is seen. This presumably represents a heteroduplex comprising both amplicons.

21del genotype results in relation to PGG2 phylogeny
21del genotype results in relation to PGG2 phylogeny. A simplified phylogenetic tree of PGG2 lineages shows that the
21del mutation is seen only within the Haarlem and LCC lineages indicating that they share a recent common ancestor. Results
also suggest frequent gene conversion and recombination events, particularly between the Haarlem groups. Each mutational
type is shown in colour and indicates the number of PPE38/71 genes present and the genotype (WT = wildtype, ie lacking the
21del mutation). Green (a): 21 bp deletion (21del) in PPE71, both genes retained; Blue (b): Recombination between PPE38/71
with PPE71 deletion; Yellow (c): Gene conversion leading to deletion of PPE71 and duplication of PPE38; Grey (d); Recombination between PPE38/71 with PPE38 deletion. The "Haarlem-like" lineages (F6 and F7) could not be included in the analysis
because the 3' end of PPE38, including the region homologous to PPE71 21del, has been deleted due to an IS6110-associated

status of the PPE39 and PPE40 genes in all available whole
genome sequences in order to determine the extent of the
hypervariable region that appears to be centered around
PPE38. Our analysis demonstrates that, apart from RD5like deletions, both genes are frequently subjected to additional mutational events at both the micro- and macromutational scale and that in many cases the resultant protein function is predicted to be abolished or altered (Table
4). Several mutations are of particular interest. Isolates
94_M4241A and M. bovis BCG both revealed the presence
of a single PPE39/40 fusion gene (Figure 3). Analysis of
the DNA sequences of PPE39 and PPE40 genes shows that
they are identical to position 538 (N-terminal conserved
region) after which they diverge. The PPE39/40 fusion
genes possesses PPE40 upstream sequence indicating that
this portion of the gene is indeed PPE40. However, the
sequences following position 538 are specific to PPE39
suggesting that the fusion has occurred at the point of
divergence. The resultant proteins are thus predicted to be
identical to PPE39 although the upstream regulatory
sequences correspond to PPE40. Also of note was the finding that, despite being unrelated, the PPE39 gene in isolates CDC1551 and EAS054 both share the same 3 bp inframe deletion of nucleotides. The deletion occurs at a trinucleotide repeat region (4 × GCG, positions 79 - 90) and
we predict that microsatellite instability has resulted in
independent deletion events to both these isolates.
Finally, we also found that the Haarlem and F11 isolates
share a direct IS6110 integration at position 47 of PPE39
with a resultant GGA duplication at the site of insertion.
Interestingly, isolate CPHL_A has an identical IS6110
insertion in PPE40 and isolate 02_1987 also reveals an
IS6110 integration at this point. A more detailed analysis
of this apparent sequence-specific hotspot for IS6110 integration has recently been accepted for publication.

Analysis of the PPE38 gene region in non-tuberculous
mycobacterial species
The extensive variability observed at the M. tuberculosis
PPE38 region led us to examine its structure in more distant evolutionary time in order to gain insights into its
evolutionary history. The whole genome sequences of 7
slow growing and 7 fast growing species of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (Figure 6), as well as several actinobacteria members outside the mycobacterium genus, were
analysed for protein sequences showing homology to
PPE38, MRA_2374, MRA_2375, plcABC and other genes
found in the M. tuberculosis PPE38 region. The genomic
region surrounding proteins of high homology was examined for similarities to the M. tuberculosis structure.

We first investigated the structure of this region in actinobacteria outside of the genus Mycobacterium (including
members of the genera Corynebacterium, Rhodococcus, and
Nocardia). In all cases glyS and an orthologue of Rv2345
(which are both located near PPE38 in M. tuberculosis, see
Figures 3 and 7) could be found situated in close proximity to each other and in all cases they were separated by
between 1 and 5 genes. These genes are unrelated to any
genes found in the PPE38 region in the mycobacteria.
The fast-growing mycobacteria - M. smegmatis, M. sp. JLS, M. sp.
MCS, M. sp. KMS, M. vanbaalenii, M. gilvum, and M. abscessus
The M. smegmatis genome contains a region homologous
to the M. tuberculosis esxA/esxB operon found in the RD1
region [33]. However, the single PE/PPE and esx gene pairs
located within this region are the only ones present in the
genome and it has previously been demonstrated that PE/
PPE expansion has only occurred in certain slow growing
mycobacteria and not in the fast-growers [2]. A number of
fast-growing mycobacterial genomes have been

Figure evolutionary scenario for the MTBC PPE38 gene region
Possible evolutionary scenario for the MTBC PPE38 gene region. Analysis of fast growing mycobacterial species and
the M. avium complex indicates that the homologues of Rv2345 and glyS have been in close proximity for a long evolutionary
period and that the insertion of homologues to PPE38 and Rv2348c between these genes was also a relatively early event (a, b).
The most recent common ancestor of the M. marinum/M. ulcerans and MTBC lineages is hypothesised to have comprised a single esx/esx/PPE38 gene cluster (black box) located between the plcABC (yellow) and PPE39/40 (grey) gene regions (c). Duplication of esx/esx/PPE38 resulted in a genotype that is retained by M. marinum (d). The genotype of the ancestral MTBC species (e)
shows an additional deletion of the esx/esx gene pair between plcA and PPE38 (red box).

From this result it seems that the ancestral region only
consisted of these four genes (Figure 7).
M. leprae
A substantially reduced PPE38 region was identified in the
genome of M. leprae, which contains only glyS, an IS6110

element (pseudogene - ML0827c), PPE38 (pseudogene,
named PPE7 in the M. leprae database), plcA (pseudogene)
and the orthologue of Rv2345 (pseudogene - ML0830c).
Due to the extreme reductive evolution of this organism's
genome [34], it is unclear what the original structure of
this region in M. leprae was before genome downsizing, so
Page 13 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:237

this organism was also not found to be useful for investigating the evolution of this region.
M. marinum
M. marinum and M. ulcerans share a recent common
ancestor and both are also closely related to the MTBC
(Figure 6). M. marinum has the most extensive PE/PPE
gene repertoire yet discovered and contains 105 PPE genes
[35]. BLAST analysis of M. marinum proteins with the
PPE38 amino acid sequence identified 2 genes
(MMAR_3661 and MMAR_3664) with highest homology.
Two esx-like genes are located downstream from each
PPE38/71 homologue suggesting that the M. tuberculosis
PPE38 region evolved initially by duplication of a esx/esx/
PPE sequence, to produce the structure seen in M. marinum, followed by deletion of the esx gene pair downstream of PPE38 homologue MMAR_3661 (Figure 7). The
homology of this region with the M. tuberculosis PPE38
region is further confirmed by surrounding genes including the upstream genes MMAR_3665 (highest homology
to PPE39), MMAR_3666 (PPE40) and MMAR_3667 (glyS).
As in M. tuberculosis, the plc region is located downstream
from MMAR_3661. Unlike M. tuberculosis the PPE38/71
homologues are not identical but show 95% homology at
the amino acid level. However, the esxN 4/esxN 5 (homologous to MRA_2374) and esxP 4/esxP 5 (homologous to
MRA_2375) gene pairs are identical both to each other
and to their M. tuberculosis counterparts. In the light of
these findings we were interested to know whether M. canettii (the most ancestral MTBC member) also retained the
esx gene pair located between plcA and PPE38. Using the
plcA5'/PPE38IntF primer pair (Table 1) we amplified the
region between plcA and PPE38 in our 3 M. canettii clinical
isolates. Amplicon size indicated the M. tuberculosis structure with loss of the 2 esx genes observed in M. marinum
and suggests that the ancestral MTBC organism had this
deletion (Figure 7). Sequence analysis of 1 amplicon confirmed that, apart from several intergenic SNPs, the structure was identical to that seen in H37Rv.
M ulcerans
The genome sequence of M. ulcerans shows that it has
recently evolved from a M. marinum-like ancestor that
acquired a virulence plasmid from another actinobacterium [36]. Since their divergence M. ulcerans has undergone extensive reductive evolution that has included
genome downsizing [37]. This has resulted in alterations
to the PPE38 region and no region of significant homology could be found. This organism was thus not found to
be useful for investigating the evolution of this region.

Discussion
Using PCR and sequencing-based analysis of clinical isolates in conjunction with data obtained from publicly
available whole genome sequences of M. tuberculosis, non-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/237

M. tuberculosis MTBC members and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria, we have investigated alterations of the
PPE38 gene region, along with its evolutionary history.
Analysis of the M. marinum whole genome sequence
shows that the MTBC PPE38 region probably arose from
the duplication of an esx/esx/PPE38 gene cluster followed
by the deletion of one esx/esx gene pair (Figure 7). The
more ancient evolution of the region is difficult to interpret from the available mycobacterium genome
sequences. Analysis of the M. avium complex suggests that
the insertion of PPE38 between Rv2345 and glyS was an
early event but the exact timing of the esx and plc gene
appearances remains unresolved. These questions will
only be answered by the sequencing of more Mycobacterial species evolutionary situated close to the M. tuberculosis and M. avium complexes (e.g. M. kansasii) as well as
additional species located on different phylogenetic
branches, such as M. gordonae/M. asiaticum and members
of the extended helix 18 group such as M. terrae (Figure 6).
Our results demonstrate that the M. tuberculosis PPE38
region is hypervariable, adding to mounting evidence
indicating that MTBC genomes are not as homogeneous
as previously thought [38], and that they have undergone,
and continue to undergo, considerable divergence from
their most recent common ancestor. From a total of 69
MTBC isolates analysed 36 (52%) were found to contain
major structural alterations. When smaller micromutations that are predicted to alter PPE38 or PPE71 protein
function are included in this tally only 22 isolates (32%)
remain that show the ancestral H37Ra-like structure (Figure 2b) containing the identical PPE38 and PPE71 genes.
It should be noted that several of the analysed isolates
were close relatives (e.g. SAWC 2576, KZN 4207, KZN
1435 and KZN 605 all belong to F15) and thus our mutation frequency may be a slight overestimate. However,
countering this is the fact that genotypic analysis for many
of our clinical isolates was based on PCR analysis rather
than sequencing and additional micro-mutations may
have gone undetected.
The hypervariability of the PPE38 region results from the
combination of a high frequency of IS6110 integration
events, IS6110-associated recombination/deletion events,
homologous recombination and gene conversion events.
The frequency and variety of IS6110-associated mutations
observed was striking. At least 20 of the 69 isolates (29%)
displayed IS6110-associated mutations and these ranged
from direct integrations, both into genes and intergenic
regions, to recombination events that resulted in partial or
full gene deletions. IS6110 integrations were also found to
be common in PPE39 and PPE40 (Table 4) and they are
also implicated in the large RD5-like deletions observed
in isolate 94_M4241A and members of the non-human
animal adapted MTBC members (Figure 3). The reason

for the high IS6110 activity within this, or any of the other
previously described M. tuberculosis IS6110 hotspot
regions [39-42], is unclear. The element does not display
any obvious insertion site sequence specificity, although
in our analysis of PPE38, PPE39 and PPE40 we documented multiple, independent, identical integration sites.
A more detailed analysis of this finding has recently been
accepted for publication. Also of note is the finding that
of all IS6110 integrations that were found to disrupt the 4
PPE genes analysed here, all occurred in their 5' (conserved N-terminal) regions. Apart from the obvious negative functional effects of gene deletion and disruption,
IS6110 can also function as a mobile promoter and upregulate genes located downstream of its integration site [4345]. Three of our clinical isolates revealed IS6110 integrations upstream of genes and an investigation into the transcriptional effects could be of interest. The dynamic
nature of the genome in this region in relation to IS6110associated integration and recombination is further evidence for the role of IS6110 in the generation of genome
plasticity in M. tuberculosis and its influence on the organism's evolution [46].
The finding that 10 of the 69 isolates harboured the RvD7
genotype demonstrates a high frequency of homologous
recombination between PPE38 and PPE71. Additional
analysis of homologous recombination and gene conversion between these genes was greatly aided by the identification of the 21del mutation. This in-frame deletion has
allowed us to distinguish between the 2 genes in the
PGG2 LCC and Haarlem groups. 21del analysis demonstrated a high frequency of both homologous recombination and gene conversion, particularly between the
various Haarlem groups, that result in various combinations of single/double/wildtype/mutant genotypes (Figures 4 and 5, Table 2). Springer and colleagues [47] have
reported that in M. smegmatis homologous recombination
can only originate in regions of high (> 99%) sequence
homology but, once initiated, can extend across heterologous regions with limited constraint. Termination of the
event was found to require another region of high
sequence similarity. This is consistent with the situation
seen between PPE38 and PPE71 either with or without the
21del mutation.
The case for a high frequency of gene conversion between
PPE38 and PPE71 is supported by comparisons of the M.
tuberculosis and M. marinum genomes. We found that
within each genome there is extreme homology between
the PPE38/71 and MMAR_3661/MMAR_3664 genes (over
95% in M. marinum and generally 100% in M. tuberculosis
at both the DNA and protein level), while between
genomes the homology between PPE38/71 and
MMAR_3661 and MMAR_3664 is only 86% at the DNA
level and 37% and 36% respectively at the protein level.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/237

This extreme intra-genomic but lower inter-genomic
homology strongly suggests that both pairs of genes have
diverged from a recent common ancestral sequence but
have been prevented from significant intra-genome divergence by regular gene conversion events. Additional evidence is provided by the sequence of these genes in M.
canettii. Here, each gene contains a non-synonymous SNP
(A → C) at nucleotide position 1054. This indicates that
mutation in one gene followed by gene conversion has
occurred in either the M. tuberculosis or M. canettii lineages
since they last shared a common ancestor. Gene conversion between PPE38 and PPE71 could thus explain the
apparent paradox between a high macro-mutational frequency, suggesting non-essentiality of the genes, and low
micro-mutational frequency, which would normally be
an indication of gene essentiality.
These results add to accumulating evidence supporting
frequent PE/PPE-associated homologous recombination
and gene conversion in M. tuberculosis. Using a microarray-based methodology Karboul and colleagues [48]
mapped numerous deletion mutations spanning adjacent
PE and PPE genes and found that they resulted in in-frame
fusion genes. Homologous recombination, using the
highly conserved N-terminal gene regions as substrates,
was strongly implicated in these events. Our own analysis
of the PPE39/40 fusion gene observed in the M. bovis BCG
and 94_M4241A whole genome sequences provides support for this finding. Two additional reports have provided evidence for between-strain recombination in close
proximity to PE and PPE genes and the authors have proposed the existence of recombination hot spots within or
close to these gene family members [49,50]. Regarding
gene conversion, the use of the 21del polymorphism to
detect this event in 2 highly homologous proximal genes
is similar to that recently reported for the PE_PGRS17 and
PE_PGRS18 gene pair [51]. This study reported the presence of a 12 bp insertion associated with a set of 40 SNPs
that is found in either PE_PGRS17 alone or in both genes.
Analysis of this polymorphism in isolates representing a
broad spectrum of M. tuberculosis lineages shows that
numerous gene conversion events have occurred between
these genes throughout the evolutionary history of the
PGG2 and PGG3 groups. Apart from its utility in detecting
PPE38/71 recombination and gene conversion events, the
21del mutation is of interest for additional reasons.
Firstly, it confirms a close evolutionary relationship
between the PGG2 groups, LCC and Haarlem, recently
identified by our group (N. C. Gey van Pittius, unpublished results). Secondly, the mutation has become fixed
in the majority of lineages and clusters from within these
groups, indicating that it might provide the organism with
a survival advantage that is able to override the homogenising effect of recombination/gene conversion events.

Indeed, this mutation may represent the initial stages of
evolutionary divergence between these 2 genes.
Homologous recombination/gene conversion events are
also presumably responsible for the indel mutations
involving the exchange of PPE38/71 upstream sequence
regions observed in several isolates. Typically, both genes
share the same upstream sequence to position - 35 before
diverging. The finding that isolate SAWC 3656 contains
an indel upstream of PPE38 that involves replacement of
the normal sequence from position -36 to -83 with PPE71
upstream sequence indicates a gene conversion event
where PPE71 has replaced PPE38 in an imperfect recombination that has included a portion of its 5'-untranslated
region. The other examples, and particularly 02_1987,
indicate that homologous recombination can also produce more complex results. Isolate 02_1987 is a particularly good example of the benefits of whole genome
sequence analysis with respect to the large-scale mutational events described in this study. Along with the plcA/
B and PPE39/40 mutations previously described (Tables 3
and 4), this genome was also found to possess numerous
additional gene truncations, inversions and IS6110 insertions involving both PPE38-associated genes and others
[see additional file 2, S23] and it provides an idea of the
amount of genomic plasticity that can be tolerated by a M.
tuberculosis isolate that has successfully infected a host and
caused disease.
Because our sample cohort is well-defined in terms of evolutionary relationships we were able, in many instances,
to determine mutation status at the lineage-, cluster- or
isolate-specific level. Although most mutations were
found to be lineage-specific, in 5 cases at least one isolate
that represented a different cluster from the same lineage
revealed an altered genotype. Thus, genotypic variability
was often observed within RFLP-defined lineages. Variability was generally not observed within clusters although
in most cases the numbers analysed were limited. However, our analysis demonstrated that within cluster alterations can occur with one lineage showing 4 distinct
mutations, including 3 within the same cluster [see additional file 2, S7]. These results emphasise the hypervariability of the PPE38 region and demonstrate its rapid
ongoing evolution at the within-lineage and even the
within-cluster level.
Our results show that the PPE38 region's hypervariability
extends to the adjacent plcABC and PPE39/40 regions. The
plcABC region has previously been reported as a preferential region for IS6110 integration [29] and our results thus
extend this region from plcC to PPE40. This results in a
"hot-spot region" of around 11.3 kb when using the
CDC1551 sequence as a reference. The importance of the
plcABC genes, along with plcD, which is located in another

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/237

genomic region, has been emphasised by knockout experiments showing that triple (plcABC) or quadruple knockouts are impaired during the late phase of infection in a
mouse model [52]. However, several examples of clinical
isolates that possess mutations in all 4 plc genes have been
reported [28,30], revealing that their functions are not
always essential for the bacteria's pathogenicity. The finding that the plcABC region is deleted in many non-M.
tuberculosis MTBC members [22-25,32], is further evidence for their limited phenotypic impact (at least in their
non-human hosts). Our analysis revealed large scale
mutations (deletions or IS6110 insertions) in 22 of a
potential 69 (23 × 3) plcABC genes analysed and indicated
that 5 isolates (M. bovis, M. bovis (BCG), M. microti, Dassie
bacillus and T92) had functional loss of all 3 plcABC genes
(Table 3). This mutation frequency is around double that
found in the extensive study of Kong and colleagues [30].
This difference might reflect the greater accuracy of whole
genome sequence analysis compared to a methodological
approach based on PCR and Southern analysis, along
with the fact that we included non-M. tuberculosis MTBC
members with known RD5 or RD5-like deletions in our
analysis. Several other micromutations (nsSNPs and
microinsertions) were also detected that are predicted to
abolish or alter protein function (Table 3). These results
confirm the frequent loss of function of these genes in
clinical isolates and suggest that previous studies may
have underestimated this frequency.
The susceptibility of this region to large deletions is
emphasised from analysis of other MTBC members where
similar, yet distinct, deletions, which may include adjacent plc and PPE39 and PPE40 genes (RD5 and RD5-like
deletions), have been reported in M. bovis, M. bovis (BCG),
M. caprae, M. microti, and the dassie and oryx bacilli [2225,32] (Figure 3). RD5-like deletions were found to be
less common in M. tuberculosis isolates and were observed
in just 1 of our clinical isolates and 2 of the M. tuberculosis
whole genome sequences (Figure 3). The relatively low
frequency of RD5-like deletions in M. tuberculosis is supported by the findings of Tsolaki and colleagues [53] who
identified only 1 such deletion in a total of 100 phylogenetically diverse strains. This low deletion frequency in M.
tuberculosis compared to non-M. tuberculosis MTBC members may signify that the absence of this region may provide the organism with a selective advantage in nonhuman hosts, a hypothesis that is strengthened by the
finding that the RD5mic deletion is found in vole, but not
human, M. microti isolates [32].
Surprisingly, our analysis of 3 independent H37Rv samples confirmed the typical H37Ra-like structure [19], thus
contradicting the published sequence [1] from which the
RvD7 genotype is defined. We suggest that the hypervariability of this region may have influenced the results of

Page 16 of 21

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:237

the published H37Rv whole genome sequence and conclude that the results for this genomic region are not representative of its true sequence. We propose that either a
culture-specific
PPE38/71
recombination/deletion
occurred to produce the non-representative RvD7 genotype or, alternatively, some subclones used for the H37Rv
sequencing project may have become mixed with those
from other isolates. The second possibility is supported by
analysis of the H37Ra sequence which, surprisingly, was
found to be far more similar to the CDC1551 sequence
than to H37Rv [19,20]. Whatever the explanation, we suggest that the sequence accuracy of this region for other
whole genome sequences that show the RvD7 genotype
be treated with caution.
The biological consequences of the described mutations
are unknown but our results suggest that functional loss
of PPE38/71, MRA_2374 and MRA_2375 (and possibly
also plcABC, PPE39, PPE40 or combinations of all of
these) do not result in a significant loss of bacterial virulence. We base this conclusion on the high frequency of
independent mutations found in this region and the fact
that the large number of mutations identified (at least in
relation to PPE38/71, MRA_2374 and MRA_2375) were
mostly lineage specific, indicating that the original
mutated organism had successfully caused disease, transmitted to new hosts and undergone further evolutionary
expansion and divergence. The best example of this is that
of the typical Beijing's (F29) where IS6110-associated
recombination/deletion events have resulted in the complete loss of functional PPE38, PPE71, MRA_2374 and
MRA_2375 [see additional file 2, S4]. Despite this, Beijing
F29 represents the dominant M. tuberculosis lineage
throughout much of Asia and its incidence continues to
rise rapidly in many countries and regions throughout the
world [54,55]. Beijing F29 is also known to have diverged
into many distinct sub-lineages [56,57]. The apparent
absence of a deleterious phenotypic effect from mutations
in the PPE38 region is supported by the transposon site
hybridisation studies of Sassetti and colleagues who
found that none of the genes analysed in our study were
essential for growth either in vitro [58] or in an in vivo
mouse model of infection [59]. In addition to these studies, which relate to M. tuberculosis in growth phase, these
genes also do not undergo significant differential regulation during dormancy phase [60,61]. The plc, PPE and esx
genes are all members of multi-gene families with numerous members within the M. tuberculosis genome and it is
possible that genetic redundancy is responsible for the
observations of Sassetti et al. Whether the loss of expression of these genes can, in some cases, be beneficial to the
organism remains unclear but many examples of potential "virulence suppressor" genes have been documented
[62]. PlcA, PPE and esx genes have all been shown to produce antigenic proteins [7-9,63-65] and it is conceivable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/237

that the loss of such potentially potent antigens could aid
in immune escape. A recent study [66] has characterised
the cellular immune response to 167 peptides representing 8 ORF's (Rv2346c - Rv2353c) within the RD5 region
(referred to in this study by the Behr et al [24] annotation,
RD7) that is absent in M. bovis, M. caprae and M. bovis BCG
compared to M. tuberculosis. A high secretion ratio of IFNγ to IL-10 was observed in response to this peptide pool
suggesting that expression of genes within RD5 might produce a protective effect. Loss of genes within this region
could therefore result in increased pathogenesis and disease virulence. Finally, our work provides a cautionary
note regarding vaccine development studies (which often
utilise PE and PPE proteins or peptides) by indicating that
at least some PPE gene family members are able to
undergo rapid evolutionary change.

Conclusion
This study presents a detailed analysis of mutations at the
PPE38 genomic region in a variety of M. tuberculosis isolates representing all major evolutionary lineages, along
with analysis of this region from other MTBC and nontubercule mycobacterial species, in order to ascertain its
evolutionary history. We conclude that this region is
hypervariable due to frequent IS6110 integrations,
IS6110-associated recombination/deletion events, and
gene conversion and recombination between PPE38 and
PPE71. Gene conversion was implicated in the low levels
of variation observed at the micro-mutational scale
between PPE38 and PPE71. Furthermore, mutational
analysis of numerous additional isolates at the lineage
and cluster levels has provided insights into the molecular
evolution of this region. We describe multiple instances of
fixation of PPE38-associated mutations at the lineage
level, along with examples of within-lineage and even
within-cluster variation, indicating rapid and extensive
evolution of the region. Because these mutations generally
result in the functional loss of genes we conclude that they
do not result in a significant loss of fitness and that, since
they have been shown to be highly antigenic, they may in
fact aid in the organism's survival.

Methods
DNA sample collection and determination of strain/
lineage/cluster
M. tuberculosis isolates from patients residing in an epidemiological field site near Cape Town, South Africa, were
genotyped according to the internationally standardized
IS6110 DNA fingerprinting method [67]. DNA fingerprints were analyzed with GelCompar software, using the
unweighted-pair group method using average linkages
and Dice coefficients [68]. Isolates with an IS6110 similarity index of ≥ 65% were grouped into strain lineages [69].
Spoligotyping was also done to further classify lineages
into clades [70].

All primer sequences are listed in Table 1. PCRs using the
PPE38F/R and PPE38IntF/IntR primer pairs were done in
a reaction mixture containing 0.1 μg template DNA, 3 μl
GC-rich solution, 1.5 μl 10× buffer containing MgCl2, 2.4
μl 10 mM dNTP's, 0.6 μl each primer (50 pmol/μl) and
0.12 μl FastStart Taq (Roche, Germany) made up to 15 μl
with H2O. Amplification comprised an initial 6 min template denaturation followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
57°C 30 s and 72°C 2 min. After the final cycle samples
were incubated at 72°C for 7 min. For the 21del analysis
samples were subjected to PCR amplification in a reaction
mixture containing 0.1 μg DNA template, 1.5 μl 10 ×
Buffer, 1.2 μl 25 mM MgCl2, 2.4 μl 10 mM dNTP's, 0.6 μl
of each primer (50 pmol/μl), 0.075 μl HotStarTaq DNA
polymerase (Qiagen, Germany) and made up to 15 μl
with H2O. Amplification was initiated by incubation at
95°C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
55°C 30 s and 72°C for 5 s. After the final cycle, the samples were incubated at 72°C for 7 min. For sequencing
analysis PCR product was electrophoresed through a 1.5%
low melting point agarose gel. The amplicon was then cut
from the gel and purified using a Promega Wizard SV Gel
and PCR Clean-up System (Madison, USA). Sequencing
was performed using an ABI 3100 automated DNA
sequencer.
