Abstract
Background: The nuclear receptors of the NR2E class play important roles in pattern formation and nervous system
development. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of DNA-binding domains, we define two conserved groups of orthologous
NR2E genes: the NR2E1 subclass, which includes C. elegans nhr-67, Drosophila tailless and dissatisfaction, and vertebrate
Tlx (NR2E2, NR2E4, NR2E1), and the NR2E3 subclass, which includes C. elegans fax-1 and vertebrate PNR (NR2E5,
NR2E3). PNR and Tll nuclear receptors have been shown to bind the hexamer half-site AAGTCA, instead of the hexamer
AGGTCA recognized by most other nuclear receptors, suggesting unique DNA-binding properties for NR2E class
members.
Results: We show that NR2E3 subclass member FAX-1, unlike NHR-67 and other NR2E1 subclass members, binds to
hexamer half-sites with relaxed specificity: it will bind hexamers with the sequence ANGTCA, although it prefers a purine
to a pyrimidine at the second position. We use site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that the difference between
FAX-1 and NHR-67 binding preference is partially mediated by a conserved subclass-specific asparagine or aspartate
residue at position 19 of the DNA-binding domain. This amino acid position is part of the "P box" that plays a critical
role in defining binding site specificity and has been shown to make hydrogen-bond contacts to the second position of
the hexamer in co-crystal structures for other nuclear receptors. The relaxed specificity allows FAX-1 to bind a much
larger repertoire of half-sites than NHR-67. While NR2E1 class proteins bind both monomeric and dimeric sites, the
NR2E3 class proteins bind only dimeric sites. The presence of a single strong site adjacent to a very weak site allows
dimeric FAX-1 binding, further increasing the number of dimeric binding sites to which FAX-1 may bind in vivo.
Conclusion: These findings identify subclass-specific DNA-binding specificities and dimerization properties for the
NR2E1 and NR2E3 subclasses. For the NR2E1 protein NHR-67, Asp-19 permits binding to AAGTCA half-sites, while
Asn-19 permits binding to AGGTCA half-sites. The apparent conservation of DNA-binding properties between
vertebrate and nematode NR2E receptors allows for the possibility of evolutionarily-conserved regulatory patterns.

Background
The nuclear receptors are a class of transcriptional regulatory proteins that function in physiology and development in animals [1-3]. They are conserved from sponges
to mammals [4,5], but this class of proteins has seen significant amplification in the number of genes and elaboration of the amino acid sequences in nematode species
[6-8]: while humans have 48 predicted nuclear receptor
genes and Drosophila melanogaster has 21, Caenorhabditis
elegans and C. briggsae each have over 250. Most nuclear
receptors have two major conserved functional domains:
the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding
domain (LBD). These two domains are normally found in
that order from N-terminus to C-terminus, although there

are unorthodox nuclear receptors that have no apparent
LBD, such as KNIRPS and ODR-7 [9,10], and some that
have no DBD, such as DAX1 and SHP [11,12].
The nuclear receptor DBD is responsible for binding to a
specific DNA response element (NRE) in the promoters of
target genes, relatively weak dimerization contacts, and
nuclear localization [3]. The DBD consists of two C-4 zinc
finger structures at its N-terminal portion and a C-terminal extension (CTE), which is sometimes grouped with
the "hinge region" between the DBD and LBD (Fig. 1).
Two key regions in the DBD have been shown to play
major roles in NRE binding specificity by making direct
and water-mediated hydrogen bond contacts with specific

DNA bases. The P box consists of six conserved amino
acids in an alpha-helical region that begins in the C-terminal portion of the first zinc finger [13-15]. The A box is a
poorly-conserved C-terminal portion of the CTE, and is
thought to play a role in modulating DNA specificity,
although this function is not as well understood [16]. A
few other conserved amino acids C-terminal to the P box
also contact DNA bases, and several other amino acids
spread throughout the DBD make contact with the DNA
phosphodiester backbone. Two other regions of the DBD
play key roles in dimerization, although some nuclear
receptors are unable to dimerize without the strong
dimerization function of the LBD. In the DBD, the D box,
located in the N-terminal portion of the second zinc finger, and the alpha-helical T box of the CTE have been
demonstrated to play direct roles in dimerization between
DBD partners [14,17]. In most cases, nuclear receptors
bind to cognate NRE's via the DBD, however there are
examples of nuclear receptors that can provide some regulatory function without binding to DNA through their
DBD [18].

possible early divergence between the two genes, with
subsequent loss of fax-1 from vertebrate lineages and loss
of PNR from nematode lineages [4].

The LBD was named based on its function in binding
lipophilic hormones in vertebrates and insects [1]. However, some nuclear receptors, such as Nurr1, are clearly ligand-independent [19] and many more are believed to be
(the so-called orphan receptors). The LBD functions in
binding coactivator and corepressor proteins, which in
turn interact with other transcription factors or modulate
chromatin structure in order to affect changes in transcriptional rates of target genes. The LBD also plays a major
role in dimerization and nuclear localization [3].

Examination of the P boxes of NR2E subclass members
suggested a possible amino acid that could mediate the
difference in specificity between this subclass and other
nuclear receptors. The nuclear receptors RXR, NGF1-B,
RAR, RevErb, EcR and USP all preferentially bind
AGGTCA half-sites and have P boxes with the amino acid
sequence CEGCKG [3]. In contrast, the NR2E class members all have the P box sequence C(D/N)GC(S/A)G. The
fifth amino acid in the P box, lysine-22 (numbering
scheme begins with 1 designated as the first cysteine in the
DBD), has been shown to make direct hydrogen bond
contacts to the base at the second position of the NRE in
co-crystal structures for nuclear receptors that bind the
AGGTCA half-site [3,35]. Therefore, it has been suggested
that lysine-22 may confer specificity for binding a guanine
residue at NRE position two. In contrast, a serine or
alanine at DBD position 22, as found in the NR2E nuclear
receptors, may confer specificity for binding an adenine
base at NRE position two [3].

The NR2E subclass of nuclear receptors is evolutionarily
conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The
founding member, tailless (Tll; NR2E2), was first identified by a genetic approach in Drosophila, where it functions in anterior-posterior pattern formation and central
nervous system development [20,21]. The vertebrate
ortholog, Tlx (NR2E1), functions in limbic system and
adult neural stem cell development [22,23]. The C. elegans
ortholog, nhr-67, appears to function in various aspects of
hypodermal and neural development and organogenesis
[8]. The Drosophila gene dissatisfaction (Dsf; NR2E4)
encodes a possible Tll paralog (or alternatively a distinct
ancestral NR2E member that was subsequently lost in
nematode and vertebrate lineages [4]) that functions in
the development of sex-specific neural and muscular features [24]. The final NR2E gene member is represented by
PNR (NR2E3) in vertebrates, and fax-1 (NR2E5) in C. elegans. In humans and mice, PNR functions in specifying
photoreceptor identity in the retina [25-28], while in C.
elegans, fax-1 functions in specification of interneuron
identity [29-31]. One phylogenetic analysis of PNR and
fax-1 family members from different species suggested a

The identification of DNA binding specificities for different nuclear receptors has been fruitful in predicting downstream target genes and in understanding the molecular
logic of how DBD amino acid sidechains interact with
NRE bases and the phosphodiester backbone. Studies on
Drosophila Tll and vertebrate Tlx binding specificities suggested that the NR2E receptors bind to half-sites with a
distinctive sequence, AAGTCA, instead of the more common NRE half-site AGGTCA [32,33]. Dsf also preferentially binds AAGTCA half-sites, and like Tll and Tlx can
bind either as a monomer or dimer [34]. Initial DNAbinding studies showed that PNR also bound to AAGTCA
half-sites, but only as a dimer bound to directly-repeated
half-sites separated by a single base-pair (DR1 sites) [25].
Thus an adenine residue at the second position of the NRE
half-site has been suggested to be a defining feature of
NR2E half-site specificity.

A structural study that examined RXR-RAR binding to
DR1 dimeric AGGTCA sites identified the amino acids
that make direct and water-mediated contacts to hexamer
bases [35]. Guanine-2 of the half-site was contacted by
Tyr-13, Glu-19, and Lys-22 of RXR and RAR. These amino
acids also made contact to other half-site bases, and other
amino acids in the DBD and CTE made direct and watermediated contacts to other half-sites bases and to the
phosphodiester backbone. Tyr-13 is common to all NR2E
DBD's (Fig. 1) and many other nuclear receptors that bind
AGGTCA half-sites, thus it is unlikely to mediate differences in NRE binding specificity. Given these data, the
amino acid present at DBD position 19, in addition to the

previously mentioned position 22, could mediate binding
specificities at position two of the NRE half-site.
An understanding of DNA binding specificity of the NR2E
class of nuclear receptors requires a comparison of the
DNA-binding properties of NR2E1 (Tll/Tlx/NHR-67) and
NR2E3 (PNR/FAX-1) subclass members. We have examined the DNA binding properties of the FAX-1 nuclear
receptor of C. elegans, a PNR ortholog, and compared
them to the NHR-67 nuclear receptor of C. elegans, a Tll
ortholog. We find that unlike NR2E1 subclass members,
FAX-1 will bind half-sites with the sequence ANGTCA and
does not bind to monomeric sites. We tested whether the
conserved Asn-19 in NR2E3 subclass members was a key
determiner of specificity for binding to NRE half-site position two. Changing Asp-19 of NHR-67 to Asn-19 was sufficient to change the binding preference of NHR-67 from
AAGTCA half-sites to AGGTCA half-sites. In contrast,
changing Asn-19 of FAX-1 to Asp-19 was not sufficient to
change the DNA-binding preference, suggesting that the
role of DBD position 19 in binding specificity is contextdependent.

Results
FAX-1 and orthologs have a distinct P box
As a first step toward identifying amino acids that might
confer subclass-specific DNA binding activities, we
aligned amino acid sequences of the DBD's, including the
CTE, of FAX-1 and orthologs from vertebrate and invertebrate species and compared them to equivalent sequences
from other NR2E class members (Fig. 1). This analysis
included five members of the NR2E3 subclass (FAX-1 and
orthologs) and six members of the NR2E1 subclass (Tll
and orthologs). Due to its similar DNA-binding activity,
Dsf (NR2E4) was grouped with the NR2E1 subclass for
this analysis. Subclasses and individual members within a
subclass differed in the length of the D box. While all
NR2E3 subclass members had a D box containing eight
amino acids, the NR2E1 subclass members had either
nine (vertebrate and Drosophila Tll), eleven (Dsf) or twelve
(C. elegans NHR-67). These differences might contribute
to the different dimerization properties of Tll as compared
to PNR. With FAX-1 as the reference sequence, all the
NR2E members evaluated were identical at 48 of 85
(56%) amino acid residues, as expected for the strong evolutionary conservation observed for nuclear receptor
DBD's. The NR2E DBD's had variability within a subclass
(for example, DBD position 2 can be Ala, Val, Arg, or Lys
without a consistent difference between the NR2E1 and
NR2E3 subclasses) at 28 of 85 (33%) residues. In some
cases, the variability was limited to amino acids with similar chemical properties. For example, position 16 can be
Leu, Tyr or Phe, all of which are hydrophobic residues.
The remaining nine amino acid residue positions of the
DBD's were identical within a subclass, but different

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/2

between subclasses. For example, position 29 is a Val in all
members of the NR2E3 subclass and Ile in all members of
the NR2E1 subclass. This last group identifies the amino
acids that might play roles in differing DNA-binding specificity of the NR2E3 subclass as compared to the NR2E1
subclass. Of particular note, position 19, which is a P box
residue predicted to contact the DNA, has an Asn in all
members of the NR2E3 subclass and an Asp in all members of the NR2E1 subclass.
FAX-1 binds DR1 sites with relaxed specificity
We used the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
to test binding of bacterially-expressed and purified FAX1 protein ([31]; Fig. 2). Binding of FAX-1 protein to NREcontaining DNA (Table 1) resulted in two discrete shifted
bands, which were inhibited and super-shifted by the
addition of anti-FAX-1 antiserum (Fig. 2A). The relative
intensities of these two bands varied somewhat from
experiment to experiment. The lower band was neither
preferentially reduced by competitor DNA containing a
monomeric binding site, nor was it preferentially
observed in experiments using a monomeric binding sites
(MON1 and MON2; Fig. 3), indicating that the two bands
probably represent two different topological states of protein-DNA complexes (or variable presence of a proteolytic
fragment) rather than monomeric and dimeric proteinDNA complexes. Because both bands showed similar
behavior in competition and supershift experiments, we
have summed both bands as being indicative of FAX-1DNA binding throughout this paper. FAX-1 protein produced no discernible shifted products at these locations
when allowed to bind negative control DNA carrying a
dimeric AATTCA sequence (DRNC; Fig. 2B).

Because the FAX-1 vertebrate ortholog, PNR, has been
shown to bind AAGTCA dimeric sites separated by one
base-pair (DR1 sites) [25], we first tested whether FAX-1
would display the same binding activity. FAX-1 protein
bound to DNA containing AAGTCA dimeric sequences
(DR1A; Fig. 2B; Table 1), and this binding could be competed with similar effectiveness by DNA containing
AAGTCA DR1A dimers or AGGTCA DR1G dimers, but not
negative control AATTCA dimers (DRNC; Fig. 2B). Thus
FAX-1 can bind AAGTCA dimers specifically, similar to
PNR and Tll.
We tested whether FAX-1 could discriminate among different nucleotides at the second position, as Tll does [3234]. Unlike Tll, FAX-1 bound to AGGTCA DR1G dimers
with avidity similar to that of AAGTCA DR1A dimers (Fig.
2A; Table 1). Furthermore, FAX-1 also bound dimers with
pyrimidines in the second position: specific binding,
although significantly weaker, was also observed with
ACGTCA and ATGTCA dimers (DR1C and DR1T; Fig. 2C–
D; Table 1). Unlabeled DR1A DNA competed more effec-

DNA (Fig. 2D). Therefore, in contrast to Tll and Tlx, FAX1 does not discriminate among different nucleotides at
the second hexamer position, although it binds purines
more strongly than pyrimidines.

sequences (AAGTCA strong binding site followed by AATTCA weak binding site). Binding could be competed with 10fold and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor
HRSW DNA, but not DRNC DNA (wedges). Although we
obtained strong shifted bands, the proportion of labeled
DNA shifted was considerably less than that observed with
DR1A sequences (Table 1). We obtained similar results (not
shown) with HRWS DNA (AATTCA weak site followed by
AAGTCA strong site).

FAX-1 does not bind monomeric hexamers but can bind a
weak site adjacent to a strong site
We tested next whether FAX-1 could bind both a single
copy of the hexamer and a dimeric copy of the hexamer,
like Tll, Tlx, and Dsf, or could bind only a dimeric copy of
the hexamer, like PNR. When challenged to bind DNA
containing only a monomeric copy of the AAGTCA hexamer (MON1 or MON2), FAX-1 showed negligible binding that was not significantly different from negative
controls (DRNC; Fig. 3A; Table 1). Consistent with this
result, unlabeled DNA containing monomeric AAGTCA
sequences competed very poorly for binding to labeled
AAGTCA DR1A or AGGTCA DR1G dimeric sequences
(data not shown).

The first column indicates the name used to refer to each sequence in
the text. The second column shows the actual sequence tested. The
third column indicates the percentage of the labeled DNA that was
shifted to high mobility in EMSA experiments using FAX-1 protein.
The fourth column indicates standard deviation for each set of EMSA
experiments summarized. We evaluated the significance of the data
using One-Way ANOVA and Fisher 95% Confidence Intervals for all
pairwise comparisons. DR1A and DR1G were not significantly
different from each other. DR1A was significantly different from all
other sequences tested (p < 0.05). The difference between DR1G
and DR1C or DR1T fell just outside the range of statistical
significance. Binding data for MON1, MON2, DR3A, and DRNC sites
were not significantly different from each. Pairwise differences
between HRWS or HRSW and MON1 or MON2 were significant (p
< 0.05).

In contrast to the results for monomeric sites, when we
placed a predicted weak binding site (AATTCA) in register
for DR1 binding with a strong site (AAGTCA), creating
heteromeric repeats in either of the two possible orders
(HRSW or HRWS), we found weak, but significant, binding by FAX-1 (Fig. 3B; Table 1). This binding was approximately 1/3 as strong as binding to ATGTCA dimers and 1/
5 as strong as binding to AAGTCA dimers (Table 1), and
significantly different from DRNC controls. These data are
consistent with a model where FAX-1 binds as an obligate
dimer, but binding to a strong site can facilitate binding to
an adjacent weaker site through cooperativity.
FAX-1 can bind DR2 sites but not DR3 sites
Nuclear receptor dimerization confers limitations on the
amount of separation between the two hexamer half-sites
that will be tolerated by a given protein [3]. Our data
show that FAX-1 can bind DR1 sites, which separate the
two hexamers with a single base-pair, similar to Tll and
PNR. We tested whether increasing the separation
between the two hexamers would influence the strength
of FAX-1 binding. When AAGTCA hexamers that are separated by two base-pairs (DR2 sites; DR2A) were tested,
FAX-1 could bind these sequences, albeit not as strongly
as DR1 sites (Fig. 4). The strength of binding, as measured
by EMSA, was similar to the strength of binding to
ACGTCA dimers and about half that observed with
AAGTCA dimers (Table 1). These data show that FAX-1
prefers DR1 sites, but can also bind DR2 sites.

experiments with DR2A, DR3A, and DR1A are shown at 10fold and 100-fold molar excess (wedges) or 10-fold molar
excess only (DR3A). We observed additional shifted species
in this experiment, however these bands could not be competed with equivalent unlabeled oligonucleotides.

When we further increased the separation of the two
AAGTCA hexamers to three base-pairs (DR3 sites; DR3A),
we were no longer able to detect binding by FAX-1 (Fig.
4). These data demonstrate that FAX-1 dimerization
requires relatively close proximity of the two hexamers,
and also serve to reinforce the conclusion that FAX-1 is

DBD amino acid 19 partially mediates DNA-binding
specificity in FAX-1 and NHR-67
In order to investigate differences between NR2E1 and
NR2E3 subclass DNA-binding properties and to allow for
mutagenesis of the subclass-specific DBD amino acid 19,
we constructed fax-1 DBD::GAL4 activation domain and
nhr-67 DBD::GAL4 activation domain fusion genes and
tested their ability to activate transcription from promoters that carry different potential binding sites using the

yeast one-hybrid system [16]. As expected from our EMSA
analysis, the FAX-1 DBD conferred significant β-galactosidase activity in one-hybrid studies with both AAGTCA
DR1A and AGGTCA DR1G dimers in this assay (Fig. 5),
but did not with an AAGTCA monomer (data not shown).
Also consistent with previous results for the NR2E1 subclass [32-35], the NHR-67 DBD conferred significant βgalactosidase activity with AAGTCA DR1A dimers (Fig.
5A), but not with AGGTCA DR1G dimers (Fig. 5B). These

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/2

data demonstrate that for FAX-1 and NHR-67, the DBD
alone is sufficient to confer at least some half-site recognition and dimerization properties, and that the modality of
binding inferred from our one-hybrid experiments yields
data that are consistent with our direct assessment of FAX1 binding activity by EMSA and the published direct
assessment of Tll and Tlx binding [32,33]. Therefore, testing DNA binding of mutated versions of FAX-1 and NHR67 by one-hybrid should yield data that are indicative of
altered binding preference in vitro.
Curiously, binding of FAX-1 to AGGTCA DR1G dimers
gave much stronger quantitative results than AAGTCA
DR1A dimers in this assay, in contrast to the expected
quantitative results from our EMSA studies, which
showed similar binding to both dimeric sites. This difference may be due to FAX-1 protein sequences that were not
present in the FAX-1 DBD construct or due to artifacts
related to DNA sequence context in the reporter constructs
or yeast cellular environment. Given this result, and
because of the indirect nature of the one-hybrid assay, we
have not drawn conclusions about relative binding
strength based on quantitative comparisons using this
assay.

binding activity. A. β-galactosidase activity in one-hybrid
experiments for yeast containing DR1A binding sites. All
strains contained a reporter plasmid derived from pLacZi
that contained a single DR1A binding site upstream of the
lacZ gene. Each strain included either no activator or a fusion
construct containing a nematode nuclear receptor DBD
fused to the yeast GAL4 activation domain. B. β-galactosidase
activity for yeast containing DR1G binding sites. Error bars
show standard deviations. Asterisks indicate results that are
significantly different than no activator control by student's ttest (p < 0.05). The difference between the FAX-1 and FAX1 N19D mutant activators on DR1A sites is also statistically
significant. We performed equivalent experiments using
strains containing negative control DRNC sites and activator
constructs. These strains did not show β-gal activity relative
to controls that had no activator (data not shown). We performed equivalent experiments using strains containing
MON1 sites and HRWS sites (both AAGTCA monomers)
and a FAX-1 DBD activator, which also did not show β-gal
activity relative to controls (data not shown).

Asn-19 of the FAX-1 DBD is the only amino acid in the P
box that is identical in all known NR2E3 subclass members and is different from the Asp-19 that is consistently
found in all known NR2E1 subclass members, including
NHR-67 (Fig. 1). Because NHR-67 and Tll discriminate
between NRE half-sites that differ at the second position
and FAX-1 does not, we hypothesized that the difference
between the different DNA-binding specificities might
depend on which amino acid is present at position 19.
This hypothesis is supported by structural data that show
water-mediated hydrogen-bond contacts between this
amino acid and the second position of the NRE for
nuclear receptors that bind DR1 dimers [35].
To test this hypothesis, we mutated the FAX-1 DBD in the
fax-1 DBD::GAL4 activation domain one-hybrid construct
from the wild-type codon for Asn to a codon for Asp.
Mutating the FAX-1 DBD from Asn-19 to Asp-19 significantly increased the β-galactosidase activity observed in
one-hybrid studies with AAGTCA DR1A sites approximately 3.7-fold (Fig. 5A). However, the mutation did not
significantly decrease or abolish the activity observed with
AGGTCA DR1G sites (Fig. 5B). Therefore, converting Asn19 to Asp-19 in the context of a FAX-1 DBD was not sufficient to change the inferred binding specificity to that of
NHR-67. Due to the caveats in interpreting quantitative
results from one-hybrid studies, it is unclear whether the
Asn to Asp change results in increased binding of FAX-1 to
AAGTCA DR1A sites, although our results are consistent
with that possibility.

More convincing results were obtained when we performed the reciprocal experiment in which the NHR-67
DBD was mutated from Asp-19 to Asn-19. This mutation
eliminated detectable β-galactosidase activity in onehybrid studies with AAGTCA DR1A sites (Fig. 5A), and
produced significant β-galactosidase activity in onehybrid studies with AGGTCA DR1G sites (Fig. 5B). From
these data, we infer that while wild-type NHR-67 with
Asp-19 can bind AAGTCA sites but not AGGTCA sites,
mutant NHR-67 with Asn-19 can bind AGGTCA sites but
not AAGTCA sites. Thus this single amino acid change had
the effect of completely reversing the modality of NHR-67
binding activity. In this context, an Asn-19 changed the
preference of binding at NRE position two from adenine
to guanine. These results indicate that the amino acid
present at position 19 in the DBD of NHR-67, in particular, and perhaps NR2E nuclear receptors in general, is a
mediator of DNA binding specificity.

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that FAX-1 binds ANGTCA
half-sites that are separated by one base-pair and can bind
AAGTCA half-sites that are separated by two base-pairs.
This contrasts it with Tll and NHR-67, which display a
strong preference for AAGTCA half-sites. FAX-1 binds
more strongly to sites that have a purine at the second
position on this strand, but does not distinguish between
AAGTCA and AGGTCA. Amino acid 22 of the DBD is
known to contact position 2 of the NRE, and it has been
proposed that having a Ser or Ala at this position rather
than a Lys may allow for recognition of AAGTCA instead
of AGGTCA half-sites [3]. All known NR2E class receptors,
including FAX-1 and NHR-67, have a Ser or Ala at position 22, suggesting that they may be able to bind the
AAGTCA sequence via this amino acid residue. However,
we have shown that a difference in DNA-binding specificity exists between members of the NR2E1 and NR2E3
subclasses. In the context of an NHR-67 DBD, the ability
to bind guanine at the second position of the NRE hexamer is conferred, in part, by the Asn-19 found in all
NR2E3 members, while the ability to bind adenine at the
second position of the NRE hexamer is conferred by the
Asp-19 found in NR2E1 members.
Despite the important role of DBD position 19, it is also
clear that the amino acid at this position is not sufficient
to confer a particular mode of binding specificity. Other
amino acids in the DBD, perhaps others that are consistently different between classes, must also contribute to
NRE binding specificity. An example of another amino
acid residue that could participate in subclass specificity is
position 58 of the DBD, which is consistently Gln in
NR2E3 and Arg in NR2E1 and is predicted to make phosphate backbone contacts with the DNA (Fig. 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/2

By analogy to co-crystal structures for RAR-RXR heterodimers bound to DR1 sites [35], Asn-19 would be predicted to make water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the
pyrimidine bases on the strand complementary to the
adenine or guanine at the second position of the NRE. The
implication of this comparison is that Asp binds most
favorably to thymine on the complementary strand, while
Asn binds favorably to cytosine and may be able to interact favorably with any of the four bases, depending on
context. Asn can make a greater variety of H-bond contacts
than Asp due to the presence of the amide donor and
acceptor in the R group of Asn in comparison to the acceptor-only carboxyl of Asp. This greater range of potential Hbonding may be a contributor to the relaxed specificity
observed for NR2E3 subclass DNA binding.
Inferences drawn from our data, the co-crystal structure of
nuclear receptors that bind DR1 sites, and general data on
nuclear receptor-NRE interactions allow us to develop a
model for the remainder of FAX-1-NRE interactions. In
co-crystal structures, the last four bases of the hexamer
NRE half site, GTCA, are contacted by hydrogen bonds
from DBD amino acid 26 and 27, usually LysArg or
ArgArg [3]. In all FAX-1 and Tll subclass members, these
positions are LysArg. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
suggest that the LysArg dipeptide sequence of FAX-1 contacts the last four base-pairs of the NRE. However, these
amino acids are apparently not sufficient to confer this
binding preference since the steroid receptors also have
the LysArg sequence, yet bind a very different half-site [3].
These and other observations raise the important caveat
that the geometry of nuclear receptor- DNA binding can
vary among classes [1,17,32,36]; therefore the implications of our study may be limited to the NR2E class.
We have not explored specificity at the first position of the
NRE half-site, which might also be somewhat degenerate.
Based on the inference drawn from the RAR-RXR co-crystal on DR1 sites, we would expect that the adenine at the
first position of the FAX-1 NRE is contacted by Ser-22 and
Arg-79 of the DBD. The former amino acid residue is generally a Ser among NR2E3 subclass members and can be
either a Ser or Ala among NR2E1 subclass members.
Amino acid position 79, found in the T box, is a conserved
arginine in all NR2E nuclear receptors. While the general
conservation of protein-DNA contacts among nuclear
receptors for which it has been directly tested is fairly
good, we cannot be certain that other amino acids don't
also participate directly in FAX-1-NRE binding. Furthermore, in all cases, other amino acids can contribute to
DNA-binding specificity through conformation-specific
contacts with the phosphodiester backbone [3,36].
The definition of potential DNA-binding sites allows us to
predict candidate in vivo targets in the genome of C. ele-

gans. There are 60 ARGTCA DR1 sites (assuming that the
separating base-pair can vary) in the C. elegans genome. If
we expand the list to include those sites that have a pyrimidine at the second position, ANGTCA DR1 sites, the
number grows to 109 potential binding sites. These sites
are not near any of the genes that are known to be dependent on fax-1 for their regulation (flp-1, ncs-1, nmr-1, nmr2, and opt-3 [31]). fax-1 may regulate these genes indirectly via another transcriptional regulator, by heterodimerization with another nuclear receptor that binds
a different half-site, or by binding to other transcription
factors at the promoter by a non-NRE-dependent mechanism. In addition, there are approximately 100 ARGTCA
DR2 sites in the C. elegans genome, to which FAX-1 dimers
may be able to bind in vivo.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/2

part, the constraint of an evolutionarily-conserved NRE
binding site.
Whether the DNA-binding activity that appears to be conserved between nematode and vertebrate members of the
NR2E3 subclass translates into conserved patterns of gene
regulation has yet to be investigated. PNR acts as a repressor of the transcription of cone-specific genes and may
activate the transcription of rod-specific genes during vertebrate photoreceptor development [28,37]. The vertebrate orthologs of some of the targets of fax-1 regulation
are also transcribed in vertebrate photoreceptor cells [31],
which allows for the possibility of conserved gene regulatory patterns.

Conclusion
Expanding the list to include those sites that allow FAX-1
dimeric binding via heteromeric sites that contain a weak
site and a strong site (ANGTCANANNTCA or ANNTCANANGTCA) increases the number of potential FAX-1
binding sites in the genome to over 1200. The sequences
upstream of ncs-1 and opt-3, both of which are regulated
by fax-1, contain sites that match this more degenerate
binding site (data not shown). With so many potential
binding sites in the genome, other factors such as cognate
coactivators or corepressors may help define the functional relevance of any particular candidate NRE. These
observations suggest that members of the NR2E3 subclass
are able to form dimers on a much wider variety of
dimeric NRE's (over 1200), as compared to the more
restrictive NR2E1 subclass (there are 36 AAGTCA DR1
sites). However, this does not mean that NR2E3 subclass
members bind more sites in vivo; NR2E1 subclass monomers may also bind monomeric AAGTCA sites, of which
there are over 20,000.
Studies on the human fax-1 ortholog, PNR, have demonstrated a similar DNA-binding activity [25,28]. PNR was
found to bind to DR1 AAGTCA NRE's, but not to monomeric AAGTCA sequences. An unbiased screen for
sequences that bind PNR revealed that, like FAX-1, it can
bind sequences that vary at positions two and three of the
half-site hexamer [28]. This study identified a preferred
PNR binding site with the sequence AGRTCAAARRTCA, a
sequence that is consistent with our analysis of FAX-1
DNA binding. While almost all binding sites revealed by
this strategy include the TCA sequence at the 3' end of the
half-sites, greater variability was observed for all three
bases at the 5'end of the half-sites, including NRE position
three in addition to NRE position two. Because Glu-19 of
RAR and RXR directly contact NRE half-site position three
in the RAR-RXR co-crystal, it may be that Asn-19 of FAX-1
and PNR also mediates the relaxed specificity at position
three of the NRE. Therefore, the strong evolutionary conservation of the NR2E3 subclass DBD reflects, at least in

Our results define subclass-specific DNA-binding specificities for the NR2E1 and NR2E3 subclasses, and suggest
that binding preferences for the second nucleotide position of the DNA half-site are partially mediated by amino
acid 19 of the NR2E DBD. The repertoire of potential
dimeric binding sites is much larger for members of the
NR2E3 subclass. FAX-1, like NR2E3 subclass member
PNR, binds NRE's as a homodimer with a strong preference for DR1 sites. Therefore, dimerization behavior may
be a second conserved difference between the NR2E1 subclass, members of which can bind as a monomer or
homodimer, and the obligate dimer NR2E3 subclass.

Methods
Protein and nucleotide sequence analyses
We compared the amino acid sequences of nuclear receptors using the BLASTP 2.2.12 and CLUSTAL V programs
[38,39]. The former was run with substitution matrix
BLOSUM 80. The latter was run using Lasergene Megalign
(DNAStar) with substitution matrix PAM 250. We performed alpha helix predictions for FAX-1 and NHR-67
using NNPREDICT [40] and PROF [41] and by comparing
the results from these analyses to the known helical structures for related nuclear receptors [3,35]. We identified
potential binding sites in genomic sequence using the
BLASTN utility [38].
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
We performed EMSA using a procedure based on those
described by Ausubel et al.[42] and Kobayashi et al.[25].
Oligonucleotides were synthesized and HPLC-purified by
Invitrogen Corporation. The sequences of each oligo were
complementary pairs (see Additional file 1). We expressed
MBP::FAX-1 protein in E. coli strain ER 2508 as described
previously [31] and purified MBP::FAX-1 protein via an
amylase affinity column. In each experiment, we pre-incubated 1.5 µg of recombinant FAX-1 fusion protein for 30
minutes on ice in binding buffer (see Additional file 2). In
competition experiments, we also added 4 ng, 40 ng, or

400 ng of cold competitor ds oligonucleotides. Following
pre-incubation, we added 4 ng of 32P-labeled ds oligonucleotides and incubated for 30 minutes on ice, before
loading onto a pre-run 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.
One-hybrid experiments
We used the Clontech one-hybrid Matchmaker system to
evaluate DNA-binding activity in yeast. The construction
of fax-1 DBD::GAL-4 AD, nhr-67 DBD::GAL4-AD, and
mutagenized derivate plasmids is described in Additional
file 2. The portion of the FAX-1 protein (AAD55066) that
was fused to the GAL4 activation domain is from Ala-95
to Asp-192. The NHR-67 construct fused residues Ile-15
through Gly-117 of the NHR-67 protein (NP 502094) to
the GAL4 activation domain. We transformed and integrated the pGAD424-derived activation plasmids and
pLacZi-derived reporter plasmids into yeast strain YM
4271 using the Li-acetate procedure described by the manufacturer. We assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a
quantitative ONPG spectrophotometric assay, and calculated β-Gal units using the method of Miller [43]: 1000 ×
OD420/time of incubation × concentration factor × OD600.
