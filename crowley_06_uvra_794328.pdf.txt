Abstract
Background: Sequenced archaeal genomes contain a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic DNA repair gene
homologs, but relatively little is known about how these microorganisms actually perform DNA repair. At
least some archaea, including the extreme halophile Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, are able to repair ultraviolet
light (UV) induced DNA damage in the absence of light-dependent photoreactivation but this 'dark' repair
capacity remains largely uncharacterized. Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 possesses homologs of the bacterial
uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC nucleotide excision repair genes as well as several eukaryotic repair genes and it has
been thought that multiple DNA repair pathways may account for the high UV resistance and dark repair
capacity of this model halophilic archaeon. We have carried out a functional analysis, measuring repair
capability in uvrA, uvrB and uvrC deletion mutants.
Results: Deletion mutants lacking functional uvrA, uvrB or uvrC genes, including a uvrA uvrC double mutant,
are hypersensitive to UV and are unable to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6–4 photoproducts
from their DNA after irradiation with 150 J/m2 of 254 nm UV-C. The UV sensitivity of the uvr mutants is
greatly attenuated following incubation under visible light, emphasizing that photoreactivation is highly
efficient in this organism. Phylogenetic analysis of the Halobacterium uvr genes indicates a complex ancestry.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that homologs of the bacterial nucleotide excision repair genes
uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC are required for the removal of UV damage in the absence of photoreactivating light
in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Deletion of these genes renders cells hypersensitive to UV and abolishes their
ability to remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6–4 photoproducts in the absence of
photoreactivating light. In spite of this inability to repair UV damaged DNA, uvrA, uvrB and uvrC deletion
mutants are substantially less UV sensitive than excision repair mutants of E. coli or yeast. This may be due
to efficient damage tolerance mechanisms such as recombinational lesion bypass, bypass DNA
polymerase(s) and the existence of multiple genomes in Halobacterium. Phylogenetic analysis provides no
clear evidence for lateral transfer of these genes from bacteria to archaea.

Background
Exposure to the ultraviolet component of sunlight causes
DNA damage in cells. After irradiation with 254 nm UVC, this damage is predominantly cyclobutane pyrimidine
dimers (CPDs) and 6–4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) [1,2]. If
allowed to persist in the genome, these alterations can
cause the blockage of DNA replication and transcription
and can lead to the production of point mutations and,
ultimately, cell death. Therefore, cells possess a variety of
mechanisms that promote survival after UV irradiation,
including UV-absorbing pigmentation to protect DNA
from damage, repair or removal of the UV photoproducts,
cell-cycle checkpoints to prevent premature division in
the presence of damage, and damage tolerance mechanisms that allow cells to replicate even when damage
remains unrepaired.
A critical repair mechanism for organisms such as plants
and aquatic microbes that experience high levels of UV in
their natural environment is photoreactivation. This process is dependent on photolyases that absorb and utilize
the energy of visible wavelengths of light to reverse the
covalent bonds formed between adjacent pyrimidines following UV exposure. Most known photolyases repair
CPDs but some repair 6-4PPs [3,4].
Not all organisms possess photolyases but almost all, with
the possible exception of some archaea [5,6], have excision repair mechanisms. In bacteria, nucleotide excision
repair (NER); i.e. "dark repair" (in contrast to lightdependent photoreactivation) requires the UvrA, UvrB,
and UvrC proteins to initiate repair of CPDs and 6-4PPs
as well as other bulky lesions; in eukaryotes the NER recognition and incision process involves many more proteins including homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
RAD1 (XPF in humans), RAD2 (XPG), RAD3 (XPD),
RAD4 (XPC), RAD10 (ERCC1), RAD14 (XPA), RAD23
(hhR23a and hhR23b) and RAD25 (XPB). The bacterial
and eukaryotic NER systems are operationally similar, but
the genes involved are not [7].
Some organisms have an additional alternative excision
repair system for UV damage, in which a UV endonuclease
(UvsE/Uvde/Uve1) incises immediately 5' to the photoproduct, forming a substrate for a FLAP endonuclease
(FEN1/S. cerevisiae RAD27) which removes the singlestrand DNA 'flap' containing the photoproduct. This latter
system is found in organisms as diverse as fission yeast,
Bacillus species, Deinococcus radiodurans and filamentous
fungi such as Neurospora [6].
Given the variety of repair mechanisms utilized by bacteria and eukaryotes, investigations of DNA repair in
archaea are important for understanding the diversity and
evolution of repair systems as well as the relationship

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/2/1/11

between these systems and cellular resistance to DNA
damage. Although many repair gene homologs – both
bacterial and eukaryotic – have been identified in the 27
completely sequenced archaeal genomes, little is known
about the functional mechanisms operating in these species [5]. Table 1 shows the NER and photolyase gene
homologs that have been identified in archaeal genomes.
It appears that there is no universal repair system common to all archaea. Some archaea, all of them euryarchaeota but none of them hyperthermophiles [8], have clear
homologs of bacterial NER genes. A few archaea, including Haloarcula marismortui, Haloquadratus walsbyi and
Methanoculleus marisnigri, possess genes with homology to
the uvsE/uvde UV-endonuclease genes [9]. Several eukaryotic homologs are also evident in many species. All
archaea have homologs of the S. cerevisiae RAD27 (human
FEN-1) called rad2. In addition, most have RAD3 and
RAD25 (human XPD and XPB) homologs as well as a
homolog of RAD1 (human XPF), called eif4a (Tables 1
&2).
It has been speculated [10] that archaea may employ a
simplified form of eukaryotic NER, in which Eif4a and
Rad2 make incisions on either side of the lesion before a
Rad3/Rad25 helicase removes the damaged region.
Although archaea lack the XPA and XPC homologs
involved in preincision steps of eukaryotic NER, it was
suggested that they may be dispensable in this putative,
stripped-down 'ancestral' form of NER. The observed UV
repair patch size of 10–11 bp in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum [11] and the presence of uvrA, uvrB and uvrC
genes in this organism, suggests a bacterial form of NER.
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 has been useful as a model system to examine the response of archaea to environmental
stressors like UV [12,13]. The organism is adapted to
extremely halophilic brine, such as in the Great Salt Lake
and marine salterns, which are used to mine salt from the
sea [14]. The organism is exposed to intense solar radiation in these environments and has a high tolerance to UV
irradiation [12,15,16] The sequenced genome of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 reveals both bacterial and eukaryotic
repair gene homologs and therefore it has been proposed
that this organism may employ multiple DNA repair
mechanisms to thrive in its natural habitat [17,18]. We
have initiated a functional analysis of putative UV repair
pathways by constructing deletion mutants lacking the
bacterial NER homologs uvrA, uvrB and/or uvrC. We have
measured their UV sensitivity and their ability to repair
UV damage to determine whether the Uvr proteins operate in a functional repair pathway and, if they do, whether
there is residual repair capacity in their absence, which
would indicate an additional repair pathway(s).

Notes
1 S. cerevisiae RAD2/human XPG belongs to the same multigene family as S. cerevisiae RAD27/FEN-1 but the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1homolog, rad2,
is more closely related to RAD27/FEN-1. There is no other homolog in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1.

Results
Construction of uvr mutants
Genetic knockouts of each Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 uvr
gene homolog were constructed to determine whether
these genes are functionally homologous to the bacterial
uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC genes that are required for NER in
Escherichia coli and other bacteria [19]. Knockouts of the
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1uvr genes were constructed using
an established ura3 counterselection strategy in which a
ura3+ non-replicating Halobacterium shuttle vector
(pMPK428) was engineered to carry a deletion construct
composed of two 400–500 bp fragments that flank the
region to be deleted [20,21]. These constructs were engineered for the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC sequence homologs
from Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and the resulting plasmids
were named pDCΔuvrA, pDCΔuvrB, and pDCΔuvrC. Each
plasmid was transformed into DJC501, a ura3- derivative
of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. ura3+ primary integrants were
selected by plating on a medium deficient in uracil and,
following PCR-based confirmation of plasmid integration, these primary integrants were cultured in a uracildeficient medium and subsequently plated on rich
medium containing 5-Fluoroorotic acid, which is toxic to
ura3 prototrophs. Only cells which lost the deletion plasmid through a second recombination event and restored
the ura3- genotype could form colonies on 5-FOA plates.
5-FOA-resistant colonies were cultured and screened by
PCR for the presence of deletion alleles.

Using the appropriate primer sets for PCR (Table 3),
results such as those presented in Figure 1 were obtained.
The control ura3- strain, DJC501, contained wild-type alleles of uvrA and uvrC (Figure 1A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast,
the strains DJC519 and DJC502 contained the deletion
alleles of uvrA and uvrC, respectively (Figure 1A, lanes 4
and 7). As expected, both strains possessed wild-type alleles of the non-targeted gene (Figure 1A, lanes 5 and 6). In
the double mutant DJC509, both uvrA and uvrC deletion
alleles were amplified (Figure 1A, lanes 8 and 9). Similar
results were obtained for strain DJC520 (uvrB, data not

shown). Because Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 is reputed to
carry up to 30 copies of the genome (J. Soppa, personal
communication), it was important to show not only the
presence of the deletion allele but also the absence of any
wild-type copies in the putative mutant strains. To do this,
we carried out Southern hybridizations for each uvr gene.
The Southerns confirmed that no uvr+ alleles were present

in any of the mutant strains (Figure 1B and data not
shown).
uvrA, uvrB, uvrC, and uvrAuvrC mutants are UV
sensitive in the dark
If the uvr genes are necessary for dark repair of UVinduced photoproducts in Halobacterium, we predicted
that our deletion strains would be hypersensitive to UV
when irradiated and incubated in non-photoreactivating
conditions. We performed quantitative survival assays on
DJC501 and the uvr deletion mutants we constructed and
found a high degree of UV sensitivity, in the dark, in
strains carrying mutant alleles of uvrA, uvrB or uvrC (Figure 2). In these mutant strains, approximately two logs of
cell killing were observed at a dose (48 J/m2) resulting in
well over 50% survival in the control DJC501 uvr+ strain.

Restoration of the ura3- genotype in the counterselection
knockout strategy allows for multiple deletions to be

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/2/1/11

made in a single strain. If the uvr genes are performing a
coordinated excision repair process similar to that of bacteria, then deletion of a second gene in this pathway
should not further sensitize the cells to UV. To test this,
DJC 502 (uvrC) was transformed with pDCΔuvrA to construct DJC 509 which carries deletions of both the uvrA
and the uvrC genes (Figure 1). As can be observed in Figure 2, this double mutant was no more sensitive to UV
than either the uvrA or uvrC single mutants, confirming
that these genes operate in the same pathway in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, presumably nucleotide excision repair.
Previous studies have shown that photoreactivation is
highly efficient in the halophilic archaea, including Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, which encodes the CPD photolyase
phr2 [16,22]. In some bacteria and eukaryotes, molecular
interactions between photoreactivation and excision
repair have been suggested [23]. To test the effect, if any,
of the uvr genes on photoreactivation, we performed
experiments in which identical plates inoculated with UVtreated uvr+ or uvr mutant cells were exposed to photoreactivating conditions (24 hours of fluorescent bulb irradiation) or kept wrapped in aluminum foil. For all strains,
minimal loss of viability was detected on the unwrapped
plates after 48 J/m2 UV, indicating efficient photoreactivation that was not dependent on uvr genes (Figure 3 and
data not shown).
Uvr mutants are completely deficient in dark repair
Given the sensitivity of the uvr mutants to UV and their
predicted function in excision repair of UV damage, we
measured the ability of the deletion mutants to remove
CPDs and 6-4PPs after a dose of 150 J/m2 UV-C. The data
show that the uvr+ cells repaired virtually all the 6-4PPs
and around 80% of CPDs within one hour, and almost all
damage in 3 hours, but that the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC single
mutants as well as the uvrA uvrC double mutant were unable to repair any CPDs or 6-4PPs during 3 hours post-irradiation incubation (Figure 4). This confirms that these
genes are absolutely required for repair of UV lesions in
the absence of photoreactivation, indicating that there is
no other 'dark' repair mechanism in Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1. This does not preclude the possibility that some of
the eukaryotic repair homologs such as rad3 or rad25 are
also involved, though NER proceeds without the need for
these proteins in bacteria.

proteins
The uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC genes are found in the halophilic
archaea and mesophilic methanogenic archaea but are
absent from the genome sequences of all other archaea
sequenced to date. Given this distribution, we examined
the phylogenetic relationships between the core archaealencoded proteins (for all archaea known to contain them)

and protein sequences found in a few diverse families of
bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of each of the Uvr
sequences gave star topologies at the root, indicating that
origins of the protein sequences cannot be uncovered.
Haloarchaeal UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC always formed a
monophyletic clade. Sequences from the mesophilic
methanogenic archaea, however, were paraphyletic, with
sequences from Methanosarcina acetivorans being quite different from the sequences encoded in the genomes of
Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus and Methanosphaera stadtmanae. For UvrA, the haloarchaea were found
to group with the UvrA sequence from the extremely radiation resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, while
M. thermoautotrophicum and M. stadtmanae formed their
own unique clade. M. acetivorans UvrA branched with the

enterobacteria Camphylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori
(Figure 5A). For UvrB, the haloarchaea, M. thermoautotrophicum, and M. stadtmanae formed a major monophyletic clade together, while UvrB from M. acetivorans
branched off on its own (Figure 5B). For UvrC, the haloarchaea formed a unique monophyletic clade, M. thermoautotrophicum and M. stadtmanae formed a clade with the
cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC, and M. acetivorans
claded with the spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi and
Treponema pallidum (Figure 5C).

Discussion
Our data clearly demonstrate the functional homology of
the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC genes to
the same genes found in bacteria. In the absence of any

one of these genes, cells are significantly more sensitive to
UV light (Figure 2) and removal of UV-induced photoproducts is effectively abolished in the absence of photoreactivating light (Figure 4). Moreover, cells deficient in
both uvrA and uvrC showed no enhanced sensitivity, indicating that these genes operate in the same pathway in
Halobacterium. We conclude the uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC
genes encode proteins that perform NER of UV photoproducts and that this pathway is required for the removal
of these lesions in Halobacterium in the absence of photoreactivation.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/2/1/11

also operate in a primary role following damage incision
by UvrABC proteins, or in a very efficient back-up role to
the predicted NER helicase, UvrD.

Many archaea do not possess homologs of the bacterialtype uvrABC genes, however, and it is likely that they
employ alternative excision repair mechanisms to remove
bulky lesions from DNA. 'Dark' repair of CPDs in Sulfolobus solfataricus (which does not have the bacterial-type uvr
genes, Table 1) after a dose of 200 J/m2 has been reported
[24]. It was suggested that this repair involves the eukaryal
NER genes, RAD1/XPF/ERCC4, RAD2/XPG and RAD25/
XPB (which were reported to be up-regulated by UV) and
RAD3/XPD [24].

In its natural sunlit habitat, Halobacterium performs efficient photoreactivation to repair UV-induced photoproducts [16,22,32]. In our uvr mutants, photoreactivation
remained highly effective, supporting complete survival
after 48 J/m2 UV when cells were exposed to fluorescent
light after UV (Figure 3). Given the remarkable efficiency
of photoreactivation, we must question the role that the
uvr-dependent repair system plays in this organism. In
most organisms, photoreactivation is directed towards
CPDs, the major UV-induced lesion, and NER is solely
responsible for repair of 6-4PPs. However, 6-4PPs also
appear to be a target of photoreactivation in Halobacterium
although the mechanism for this direct repair has not yet
been elucidated [16]. In the absence of a primary role in
repairing UV lesions, perhaps a major role of the uvrdependent repair system in Halobacterium is to monitor
the genome for a variety of other bulky DNA lesions. The
uvr genes may also be targeted to lesions in expressed
genes through transcription-coupled repair. In this way,
transcription-arresting lesions would be targeted for
removal by uvr-based NER, promoting gene expression
after DNA damage. The E. coli UvrABC proteins are absolutely required for TCR and are coupled to an arrested
RNA polymerase by the Mfd protein [33]. No Mfd
orthologs have been found in Halobacterium, which is not
surprising given that the archaeal RNA polymerase is
much more similar to the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II
complex than the bacterial transcription machinery. It will
be important to determine whether transcription-coupled
repair occurs in Halobacterium and if the uvr and rad genes
are involved in this process.

In contrast, our data suggest that the eukaryotic repair
homologs present in the Halobacterium genome are not
involved in NER. The eukaryotic RAD proteins have roles
in a variety of biochemical pathways besides repair,
including DNA replication (RAD2, [25]), recombinational repair (RAD1, [26,27]), and transcription (RAD2,
RAD3, RAD25, [28,29]). It may be that the archaeal
homologs of these genes are also involved in these or
other non-NER pathways in Halobacterium. However, it is
possible that the Halobacterium rad genes, and perhaps
others in the genome, are involved in promoting subpathways of NER, particularly transcription-coupled
repair (TCR), which requires the coupling of NER to an
RNA polymerase arrested at DNA lesions. This sub-pathway of repair has yet to be demonstrated in the archaea,
but has been observed in a wide range of bacteria and
eukaryotes [30]. Homologs of the rad3 and rad25 putative
DNA helicases are required for TCR in yeast [31] and may
operate in this capacity in Halobacterium. These genes may

Compared to similar NER knockouts in other organisms
[19,34]Halobacterium uvr mutants are relatively resistant
to UV (Figure 2). Given the lack of UV protective mechanisms afforded by membrane pigments ([15,35]
McCready & Crowley, unpublished observations) and the
absence of any detectable repair of UV lesions in these
mutants, it appears that these organisms possess proficient UV damage tolerance mechanisms. These mechanisms may include damage-inducible mechanisms
involving the protein RadA1. The radA1 gene is highly
induced (7-fold) after UV, suggesting that it plays a critical
role in tolerance of DNA damage [12] and it has been suggested that RadA1 may participate in rescuing stalled or
collapsed replication forks, allowing (error-free) lesion
bypass in the absence of repair [36,37]. In addition, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 encodes at least one lesion bypass
polymerase belonging to the DinB/UmuC/Rad30/Rev1
DNA polymerase superfamily [38], which facilitate bypass
of photoproducts and allow replication to continue on

The extremely halophilic archaea with published genome
sequences (Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, Haloarcula marismortui and Natronomonas pharaonis) all carry the bacterial-type
uvr genes so it seems likely that they all perform functional bacterial-type NER. Haloferax volcanii has been
shown to excise UV lesions [15], but its complete genome
sequence is not yet available. The bacterial uvr homologs
found in the genome of the mesophilic methanogen
Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum seem to be functional as well, since a repair patch size of 10–11 bases has
been measured, which is typical of the bacterial NER
patch size [11].

damaged templates. Another important factor is likely to
be the presence of multiple copies of the genome in Halobacterium cells. Up to 30 copies per cell have been
observed (Soppa, personal communication; [39]) which
could conceivably permit damaged cells to survive and
reproduce, through segregation of undamaged chromosomes, perhaps facilitated by RadA1-mediated recombinational mechanisms.
Our phylogenetic analysis shows a complex history for the
Uvr proteins in archaea. Although it is tempting to speculate that the genes encoding these proteins were laterally
transferred into the different archaea from bacteria, it is
also possible that the Uvr system was present in an ancestral archaeon and subsequently lost from most extant lineages identified thus far. If lateral transfer of these genes
did occur, the system was probably put together in a piecemeal fashion, with acquisition of individual genes in
archaea coming from diverse bacterial groups.

Conclusion
We conclude that the bacterial-type uvrA, uvrB and uvrC
genes are absolutely required for repair of UV photoproducts in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and that this pathway is
solely responsible for excision repair of UV lesions from
the genome of this archaeon.

20 g MgSO4·7H2O, 3 g Na citrate, 2 g KCl, 5 g Bacto-Tryptone, 3 g yeast extract, 1 g casamino acids pH 7.2, plus
trace metals) and transformed with pDCΔuvrA, pDCΔuvrB, and pDCΔuvrC in separate reactions following established techniques [14,40]. Primary integrants (via
homologous regions in deletion construct) were selected
by plating transformation mixtures on HURA plates (per
liter: 250 g NaCl, 20 g MgSO4·7H2O, 3 g Na citrate, 2 g
KCl, 10 g of nitrogen base (Sigma-Aldrich co. Y0626),
1.92 g synthetic uracil dropout formula (Sigma-Aldrich
co. Y1501), 20 g agar, pH 7.0 [21] on which only ura3+
cells can grow. Primary integrant colonies were picked,
grown to log phase in HURA broth, and DNA was prepared. PCR was performed using primers for the ura3 and
bla genes to confirm integration of deletion plasmids (see
Table 3). Log-phase cultures of ura+bla+ primary integrants
were plated on modified CM+ plates (as above with 20 g
agar/liter) + 0.25 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA;
Research Products International Corp., F10501) to select
for loss of plasmid (and its ura3+ allele) via a second
homologous recombination event. In approximately 50%
of 5-FOA resistant colonies, the plasmid was lost by a
recombination event that resulted in replacement of the
targeted wild-type allele with the engineered deletion construct. 5-FOA resistant colonies were screened by PCR and
genotypes confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization.

Methods
Construction of uvr deletion mutants
All mutants were constructed using published techniques
[20,21]. In brief, 400–500 base pair (bp) flanking regions
of each uvr gene were amplified by PCR and cloned into
pMPK428 (generous gift of M. Krebs and R. Peck), which
carries the wild-type allele of ura3 and the β-lactamase
(bla) gene for ampicillin selection in E. coli. PCR primers
targeted to the upstream flanking region of each gene were
engineered with KpnI and XbaI sites on the forward and
reverse primers, respectively (see Table 3). Primers targeted to the downstream region of each gene were similarly engineered with XbaI and HindIII sites. Following
amplification and purification, the PCR fragments were
digested with the appropriate enzymes and triple-ligated
with pMPK428 digested with KpnI and HindIII. The ligation mixtures were transformed into competent E. coli
(JM109) cells and transformants were selected by plating
on LB agar containing100 μg/ml ampicillin. Ampicillinresistant colonies were picked, cultured, and plasmids
were purified and digested with HindIII and KpnI to check
for appropriate inserts. Selected plasmids with predicted
restriction patterns were sequenced and named pDCΔuvrA, pDCΔuvrB, and pDCΔuvrC.

Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 ura3- cells (a generous gift of Dr.
M. P. Krebs, renamed DJC501) were grown to mid-log
phase in modified rich CM+ media (per liter: 250 g NaCl,

Screening of putative deletion mutants
5-FOA resistant colonies were cultured at 42°C in a C76
water bath shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison,
N.J.) at 200 rpm in modified rich CM+ liquid media and
genomic DNA was prepared as described [40]. PCR was
performed using primer sets shown in the bottom section
of Table 3. For uvrC amplifications, the uvrC1 forward and
uvrC2 reverse primers were used.

Genomic DNA was digested with PstI (uvrA and uvrB), or
KpnI and PvuII (uvrC) for determining genotype by Southern blot hybridization. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis overnight in alkaline gels containing 0.8%
agarose. DNA was transferred to Hybond N+ membranes
by Southern blotting and hybridized with AlkPhos-Direct
with ECF-labelled (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
RPN3692) PCR fragments from either the upstream or
downstream flanking region of each gene (Table 3).
Chemifluorescence signal was detected using a GE Healthcare Storm Imager.
Quantitative UV survival curves
Halobacterium cultures were grown to mid-log phase in
modified CM+ liquid media, centrifuged, and washed
twice with CM salts (per liter: 250 g NaCl, 20 g
MgSO4·7H2O, 3 g Na citrate, 2 g KCl, pH 7.2). Working
in subdued yellow light to prevent photoreactivation,

washed cells were irradiated with a 254 nm germicidal
lamp at a dose rate of 0.8 J/m2/sec with mild agitation.
Samples were diluted and 20 microliters of each dilution
were spotted on modified CM+ plates. Plates were
wrapped in foil and incubated 4–5 days at 42°C. To
observe the effects of photoreactivation on survival, two
identically spotted plates were exposed to Sylvania GroLux fluorescent light (Sylvania F40/GRO/AQ/RP) for 24
hours prior to incubation at 42°C. One plate was
wrapped in foil as a control.

and 0322, respectively. Sequences for Haloarcula marismortui, Natronomonas pharaonis, and Methanosphaera stadtmanae were downloaded from NCBI (see Additional file
1). Amino acid sequences were aligned using
CLUSTAL_X1.83 [42]. Alignments were manually
inspected and edited if necessary. TREEPUZZLE5.2 was
used for quartet puzzling consensus maximum likelihood
phylogenetic reconstruction using the JTT amino acid substitution matrix [43].

Repair experiments and Immunoassays for measurement
of photoproducts
The repair experiments and dot-blot immunoassays for
UV photoproducts were carried out as described previously [12,15,21,41]. Log-phase cells were harvested and
irradiated with 150 J/m2 UV-C at a dose rate of 1 J/m2/sec
and the irradiated cells were incubated aerobically at
37°C to allow repair to proceed. We have previously
shown that, after this dose of UV, there is no detectable
DNA replication during a 3-hour post-UV incubation
[15]. All irradiation and post-UV incubation was carried
out either under yellow light illumination or in the dark.
Fifty-ml samples were harvested at timed intervals and
genomic DNA extracted using Promega Wizard genomic
DNA kits. DNA samples from the various time points
were equalised by measuring fluorescence of ethidium
bromide-stained DNA in agarose gels, adjusting DNA
concentrations and repeating this analysis as many times
as necessary until all samples were of equal concentration.

Two identical dot blots were prepared on nitrocellulose
filters, each containing a set of dilutions of each DNA
sample in 1 M ammonium acetate. One blot was used to
measure total damage (CPDs and 6-4PPs); the other was
exposed to CPD photolyase and visible light to eliminate
CPDs and allow for detection of 6-4PPs alone. The blots
were then exposed to rabbit polyclonal antiserum containing antibodies to 6-4PPs and CPDs, then to biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody followed by alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated Extravidin (Sigma) and finally to
Nitro Blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate (BCIP) substrate. The intensity of blue
color was proportional to the amount of DNA damage in
the samples and was measured using a scanning densitometer (BioRad GS-670) and compared to a set of standards included on each blot.

archaeal genomes
Protein sequences for the core Uvr system components
(UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC) from representative bacteria,
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus, were downloaded from COGs 0178, 0556
