Abstract
Background: The origin of angiosperms has been under debate since the time of Darwin. While
there has been much speculation in past decades about pre-Cretaceous angiosperms, including
Archaefructus, these reports are controversial. The earliest reliable fossil record of angiosperms
remains restricted to the Cretaceous, even though recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest
an origin for angiosperms much earlier than the current fossil record.
Results: In this paper, after careful SEM and light microscopic work, we report fossils with
angiospermous traits of the Jurassic age. The fossils were collected from the Haifanggou Formation
(middle Jurassic) in western Liaoning, northeast China. They include two female structures and an
associated leaf on the same slab. One of the female structures is physically connected to the apex
of a short shoot. The female organs are borne in pairs on short peduncles that are arranged along
the axis of the female structure. Each of the female organs has a central unit that is surrounded by
an envelope with characteristic longitudinal ribs. Each central unit has two locules completely
separated by a vertical septum. The apex of the central unit is completely closed. The general
morphology places these fossils into the scope of Schmeissneria, an early Jurassic genus that was
previously attributed to Ginkgoales.
Conclusion: Because the closed carpel is a character only found in angiosperms, the closed apex
of the central unit suggests the presence of angiospermy in Schmeissneria. This angiospermous trait
implies either a Jurassic angiosperm or a new seed plant group parallel to angiosperms and other
known seed plants. As an angiosperm, the Liassic age (earliest Jurassic) of Schmeissneria microstachys
would suggest an origin of angiosperms during the Triassic. Although still uncertain, this could have
a great impact on our perspective of the history, diversity and systematics of seed plants and
angiosperms.

Background
Angiosperms are the dominating plant group in current
vegetation. They account for the majority of terrestrial primary production, demonstrate the highest diversity in the
plant kingdom, and dominate highly diversified habitats

[1-4]. The rapid radiation and diversification of
angiosperms during the Cretaceous led to major ecological changes on the earth, the latter were a prerequisite for
many critical evolutionary events [3] including the later
evolution of human beings. However, the origin of this

important plant group has remained obscure since the
time of Darwin [3,5-8]. Although palaeobotanists have
been searching for pre-Cretaceous angiosperms and some
speculate that the angiosperm line may extend back to the
Triassic [8,9], the earliest angiosperm fossil records are
still restricted to the Cretaceous hitherto [3-5,10-12].
Therefore, it is not surprising that whenever something
related to the origin of angiosperms is discovered, such as
Sanmiguelia [13] and Archaefructus [6,7,14], it not only
receives attention but also triggers controversy within and
beyond academic circles. Western Liaoning has been a
focus of palaeontological research because of its wealth of
fossil plants [7,15-20] and animals [21,22]. Pan's claims
of Jurassic angiosperms [15-17] once raised great interest
in fossil plants in this region, but they are currently not
generally accepted [18,23].

form, but its apex was unknown (Fig. 1a). The venation
was probably parallel (Fig. 1a). No cuticle could be
obtained.
Only the apex of a short shoot was organically connected
to a female structure (Figs. 1a,c). It was about 2.4 mm
long and 2.3 mm wide, with leaf cushions (Fig. 1c). The
leaf cushion was about 0.56 mm high and 1.8 mm wide
(Fig. 1c).
The female structures were spicate, up to 9.4 mm wide, at
least 6 cm (Fig. 1a) and 1.8 cm (Fig. 1b) long, respectively

Schmeissneria was first identified as a member of the
Ginkgoales [24], with a history dating back to 1838 [25].
Schmeissneria (Stachyopitys) was once thought to be related
to conifers [25,26]. Its ginkgoalean affinity was initially
proposed based on association: Schenk (1890) classified
it as a premature male flower of Baiera, therefore placing
Schmeissneria (Stachyopitys) in the Ginkgoales [27]. Based
on the data available now, Schenk's conclusion on Schmeissneria (Stachyopitys) has been proven erroneous. First,
the male nature of Schmeissneria (Stachyopitys) has been
disproved [28]. Second, the connection between Baiera
and Schmeissneria has been nullified [24,29]. Third, Schmeissneria has been proven connected with Glossophyllum?
sp. A [30], which is dissimilar to any known ginkgoalean
leaf [24]. All of this evidence refuted Schenk's initial proposal on the ginkgoalean affinity of Schmeissneria (Stachyopitys), and thus Schmeissneria lost its affinity. Apparently,
Kirchner and Van Konijnenburg-Van Cittert did not realize what they had accomplished and conveniently put
Schmeissneria in Ginkgoales [24]. In addition, there are a
few characters that make Schmeissneria even more mysterious: 1) the internal structure of the reproductive organ,
which is important for systematics, is hitherto unknown;
2) its connected vegetative parts do not provide enough
information to resolve its systematic position; and 3) its
winged seeds are never found in other Ginkgoales.
Here new specimens of Schmeissneria, S. sinensis Wang sp.
nov., are reported from the Haifanggou Formation (middle Jurassic) in western Liaoning, China. The new information from these materials allowed us to re-examine the
affinity of Schmeissneria.

and generally tapering apically (Figs. 1a–b, 4d). The axes
of the female structures were up to 1.3 mm across basally
and only 0.2 mm across apically (Figs. 1a–c, 2a–d). The
structures were either straight (Fig. 1a) or sinuous (Fig.
1b), longitudinally ribbed (Figs. 2a–c,f, 4d), but free of
female organ for about 1.8 cm at the base (Figs. 1a, 4d).
One of the female structures was organically connected to
the apex of a short shoot (Figs. 1a,c). A female structure
had more than 21 female organs attached (Fig. 1a). Generally, the female organs at the basal part were larger and
more mature than those at the distal (Figs. 1a–b), except
for an isolated female organ pair at the base (Figs. 1a, 2c,
4d). At least some female organs were connated basally
(Figs. 2b–e, 4a,d). The peduncle of the female organ pair,
rarely seen, was about 0.5 mm long (Fig. 2a).
The female organs were about 1.6–4.6 mm long, about
1.2–4 mm in diameter, widest at the base and constricted
at the apex (Figs. 2a–f, 3a, 4a,c). They had an onion-like
appearance, including a central unit and a sheathing envelope (Figs. 2b,e, 3a,d, 4c,d). The envelope was longitudinally ribbed internally and externally (Figs. 2a–b,f, 3a,j,
4a,c,d). The apices of the female organs pointed away
from the axis of the female structure (Figs. 2a–b, 4a,d).
The envelope apex of a large female organ (Figs. 2a–b, 2e–
f) was more extended than that of a smaller one (Figs. 2c–
d, 3d). The envelope, sheathing around the central unit,
was of multiple parts (Fig. 3c), and inflated (Figs. 2a–b,
3a). The surface of the envelope was smooth locally with
elongated epidermal cells (Fig. 3b). The cells within the
envelope were elongated: 18–33 µm long and 6–12 µm
wide (Fig. 3b). The rugulate pollen grains found on the
internal surface of the envelope apex were about 26 µm in
diameter (Figs. 3j–o). The central units were about 1.5 to
3.3 mm long and 1 to 3.2 mm in diameter, widest basally
and constricted apically (Figs. 2a–b,e, 3a,d, 4a,c). The central unit was attached to a receptacle by a wide base about
1.6 mm in diameter (Fig. 3a), with its apex approaching
that of the envelope (Figs. 3d–f, 4c). The distal part of the
central unit wall was longitudinally ribbed internally and
externally (Figs. 3a,e). No elaborated pollen reception site
was observed (Figs. 3d–f,i). The central unit was bilocular,
completely separated by a 9 to 19 µm thick vertical septum (Figs. 2f–h, 3d–i, 4b–c). The central unit internal
walls were smooth (Figs. 2g, 4b) and flat at the base and
rough in the upper part (Figs. 2g, 3e,f, 4b). The septum
was complete, extending from the base (Figs. 2g, 4b),
through the middle part (Figs. 3g–h) to the apex (Figs. 2h,
3e–f,i, 4c) of the central unit. The septum was papillate
(Fig. 2h and its inset).
Remarks: Although two rugulate pollen grains (Figs. 3j–
o) were found on the internal surface of the envelope
apex, their relationship to S. sinensis was tentative and
subject to further validation. Stachyopitys preslii (possible

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/14

male organ of Schmeissneria [24]) was only associated
with but never connected to Schmeissneria microstachys
[24], and may also be related to other Ginkgoalean plants
[24].

Discussion
The specimens studied here were generally identical to
Schmeissneria [24], especially the holotype of S. microstachys (pl. I, fig. 1) [24]. The latter closely resembled S.
sinensis in spicate structure, paired female organs, female
organ morphology, longitudinally ribbed axes of female
structures, and the insertion of a female structure on the
apex of a short shoot, even though the specimens
described here and S. microstachys were from different
continents and geological epochs, and S. sinensis had
more densely clustered female organs and much shorter
peduncles of female organ pairs (0.5 mm rather than 2
mm long). Fortunately, the internal structure was preserved in S. sinensis and thus shed new light on its affinity.
Structure and Interpretation
In all non-angiospermous seed plants, there is an opening
at the nucellar apices to allow the pollen grains to
approach the ovules [31,32]. The dimension of the opening has to be large enough to let pollen grains pass
through. Unlike seed ferns or other gymnosperms, no
opening was found at the apex of the central unit in S. sinensis (Figs. 3d–f). In the view from the interior of the central unit to its apex (Fig. 3f), any opening larger than 20
µm (the normal size of an average pollen grain) should be
visible if present on the central unit wall. Although the
preservation of the fossils reported here was not perfect,
the female organs had both the cellular details (Fig. 3b)
and a septum only about 10 µm thick (Fig. 3i) preserved.
The preservation of such fine details suggested that preservation fidelity was high enough for structures above the
cellular level. Therefore the central unit apex of S. sinensis
was physically closed, at least to pollen grains. This was
essentially different from the situation in Caytonia, in
which there are numerous ovules within a cupule that has
an opening for pollen grain entry before pollination
[33,34]. There were two alternative interpretations for the
absence of pollen entry in Schmeissneria: one was that the
pollen entry did not exist at all; the other was that the pollen entry had been obliterated. The latter situation has
been seen in Gnetum [32,35], Ephedra, Pinus, Cedrus,
Cephalotaxus [36], and possibly in Caytonia [33,34], in all
of which the pollen canals were plugged or obliterated by
tissue outgrowth or cell proliferation after pollination.
This tissue growth or cell proliferation is concomitant
with morphological changes [35,36]. However, in the case
of Schmeissneria this alternative appeared unlikely for the
following reasons: 1) the female organs in Figs. 3d–f were
in their early stages (pre-pollination), suggested by their
smaller sizes and morphology different from winged

seeds [24]; 2) there was neither any trace of abnormal tissue outgrowth nor sudden changes in the wall at the apex
of the central unit (Figs. 3d–f), unlike what is observed in
Gnetum [35], Cephalotaxus, and Ephedra [36]. Consequently, the other alternative was more reasonable and
acceptable. This was the major reason that the authors correlated the structures of Schmeissneria's central unit, envelope, female organ and female structure with an
angiosperm's gynoecium, perianth, flower and inflorescence.
A septum extended from the base (Figs. 2g, 4b), through
the middle (Figs. 3g–h), to the apex (Figs. 2h, 3e,f,i, 4c) of
the central unit. The septum separated the central unit
into two independent locules (Figs. 2f–h, 3h–i, 4b–c). The
latter were suggestive of two carpels in a central unit
(equivalent to gynoecium in angiosperm) [37]. The septum appeared as a ridge raised above the smooth wall of
the central unit in the longitudinal view (Fig. 2g). Its
smooth connections to the side walls (Figs. 3h–i) and
base (Fig. 2g) of the central units suggested that the septum represented an original structure rather than an artefact or alteration. The repeated presence of a septum of
various poses in four individual female organs (Figs. 2g–
h, 3d–i) also strongly suggested its truthful existence. Up
until now there has been no report of a complete septum
in a seed or ovule in any gymnosperm. Sometimes paired
ovules in Ginkgo may appear to have a membraneous division in between. However, their ovules have never been
completely enclosed before pollination, the tips of the
paired ovules point to different directions, and there is no
empty interior space within any ovule. Therefore the
paired ovules of Ginkgo were distinct from the central unit
of Schmeissneria.

Schmeissneria sinensis had female organs of various
ontogenetic stages, from small premature ones at the top
to large mature ones at the base of the female structures
(Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Considering the slight morphological difference between the topmost (most immature) and bottommost (most mature) female organs, it was reasonable
to assume that the female organs reported here, especially
the smaller ones, were not yet pollinated. The rough internal surface in the upper portion of the central unit (Fig. 2g
and Fig. 4b(g)) and the longitudinal ribs on it (Fig. 3e), in
contrast to the smooth surface in the lower portion of the
internal surface of the central unit (Fig. 2g and Fig.
4b(a,c)), suggested that the upper portion of the central
unit was empty, while the lower part was occupied by
another inherent substructure (probably an ovule). This
situation was unlikely in ovules or seeds, which rarely, if
ever, have an empty interior space. It was also unlikely to
be a result of differentiated preservation related to histological differences because the presence or absence of tissues is a morphological rather than histological character.

The winged seeds connected to vegetative parts reported
by Kirchner and Van Konijnenburg-Van Cittert (Fig. 1b,
[24]) were distinct from the female organs reported here,
implying the immaturity of S. sinensis. Considering the
aforementioned details, since Wcislo-Luraniec [28] and
Kirchner and Van Konijnenburg-Van Cittert [24] have
proven the female nature of Schmeissneria, the immature
central unit with two locules and a closed apex sheathed
by an envelope can be interpreted as a gynoecium of two
carpels surrounded by a perianth. This suggested that the
carpels (gynoecium) in Schmeissneria were closed before
pollination, a situation quite different from the
"angiospermy" after pollination in gymnosperms [38].
Affinity
In 1838, Presl (pl. 33, fig. 12 only) reported fructifications
from Keuper Sandstone (actually Liassic age [24]) of
Reundorf near Bamberg, Germany [25]. He considered
them male flowers of Pinites microstachys (Conifers).
Schenk (pl. XLIV, figs. 11, 12 only, 1867) investigated
similar fossils from Veitlahm near Kulmbach, describing
them as female flowers of Stachyopitys preslii, which was
associated with Schizolepis (a coniferous genus) [26]. Later
Schenk (fig. 180b only, 1890) assigned Stachyopitys preslii
as male fructifications of Baiera münsteriana (Ginkgoales),
and interpreted the formerly "female fructifications" as
male flowers in an early stage [27]. This association
between Baiera and Stachyopitys proposed by Schenk [27]
was later widely accepted (taf. 29, abb. 4 [39]; fig. 239c
[40]; fig. 375d [41]; abb. 303h [42]; fig. 198B [31]; taf. 1,
fig. lower left [43]; fig. 35d [32]). Actually, fossils of various affinities had been lumped into Stachyopitys preslii
[44]. Wcislo-Luraniec (pl. 1 and textfigs. 1, 2, 1992) cast
doubt on the male nature of Stachyopitys preslii because of
the discovery of "cupules," thereby proving the female
nature of the fossil [28]. At the same time, Stachyopitys
preslii was found connected with Weber's (p58, taf. 5, fig.
51 [30]) Glossophyllum? sp. A [29]. With more complete
fossil materials available, a new genus, Schmeissneria
(Ginkgoales), was established for the female Stachyopitys
and officially separated from the male Stachyopitys (Figure
1 and pls. I-III, pl. IV, fig. 1, [24]). It appeared that Kirchner and Van Konijnenburg-Van Cittert did not realize that
they had undermined the ground for the ginkgoalean
affinity of the fossil and uncritically accepted the previous
conclusion as true [24]. Furthermore, they did not give
any valid reason for why they put the genus in Ginkgoales
except for comparing the paired "ovules" of Schmeissneria
and the paired ovules of Ginkgo in two sentences (p.207)
[24]. Apparently, their comparison was not sufficient to
place the fossil in Ginkgoales with confidence because the
characteristic collar at the base of Ginkgo seed was absent
in all specimens of Schmeissneria and the winged seeds of
Schmeissneria were never seen in any Ginkgoales. However, re-examining the references indicated that 1) the dis-

(Schmeissneria) preslii and Weber's Glossophyllum? sp. A
disproved the relationship between Stachyopitys (Schmeissneria) preslii and Baiera münsteriana proposed by Schenk
[27]; and 2) Glossophyllum? sp. A did not belong to the
ginkgoalean Glossophyllum [24]. Therefore, Schmeissneria
was dangling phylogenetically. Since the connected vegetative organs could not resolve its affinity, the affinity of
Schmeissneria had to be resolved based on the internal
structure of its own female reproductive organs.
Seed plants include two major groups, gymnosperms and
angiosperms. Currently the known major Mesozoic and
extant gymnospermous groups include Ginkgoales,
Cycadales, Bennettitales, Coniferales, Glossopteridales,
Caytoniales, and Gnetales. Among them, Cycadales have
pinnate leaves and ovules/seeds attached to the margins
of megasporophylls [5,31,32]; Bennettitales have pinnate
leaves and conspicuous cone-like reproductive organs
with ovules/seeds arranged on a central receptacle
[5,31,32]; Coniferales have needle-like or various leaves
and more or less cone-like structures composed of bractscale complexes, except for all or some elements of Taxaceae and Podocarpaceae [5,31,32,45], the latter two are
distinctly different from Schmeissneria; Glossopteridales
have reticulate leaves and their megasporophylls adnated
to the adaxial of the foliage [5,31,32,46]; Caytoniales
have reticulate leaves and cupules with inverted openings
oppositely arranged along the laterals of the megasporophyll axis [5,32]; and Gnetales have a micropylar tube,
articulate shoot, opposite/whorled leaves, opposite/
whorled bracts in the reproductive cone, ovuliferous units
in the bract axil [31,32,47,48] (Table 1). These characteristics clearly distinguished these groups from Schmeissneria. Therefore these groups will not be considered further
in the following discussion on the affinity of Schmeissneria, and the only possibilities remaining are Ginkgoales,
Angiosperms, or a new group of seed plants.
Several characters are used to distinguish angiosperms
and gymnosperms, including enclosed ovules/seeds, double fertilization, vessel elements, reticulate venation, and
tectate-columellate pollen wall structure. However, it is
harder to draw a line between these two groups than it
might appear: neither of the above characters is a touchstone for angiosperms [1,3]. None of the above characters
is unique to angiosperms. All the ovules in gymnosperms
are exposed when pollination occurs, but at least some of
the ovules/seeds are enclosed after fertilization (Caytoniales [33]; Gnetales [35]; Coniferales and Gnetales [36];
Coniferales [38]). Angiosperms have completely closed
carpels. However, in some basal groups this closure is by
secretion, and not by postgenital fusion (e.g., Amborellaceae, Schisandraceae, Austrobaileyaceae, Trimeniaceae
[49]). Double fertilization has been reported in non-

angiosperms, as in Ephedra [31,50] and Abies [31]. Vessel
elements are also present in various non-angiosperms,
such as Selaginella, Equisetum, Pteridium [1], Gigantopteriales [51], and Gnetales [1,4,31,32]. Reticulate venation
has been reported in non-angiosperms, including Dipteridaceae [52-55], Gigantopteriales [56,57], Caytoniales
[33,58], Glossopteridales [5,40,46,58], Bennettitales [32],
and Gnetales [31,32]. Pollen grains with an angiospermlike wall structure have been reported in many pre-Cretaceous plants [59-61] that are regarded as nonangiosperms by others [62]. According to Tomlinson and
Takaso [38], the only consistent difference between
angiosperms and gymnosperms is that the ovules at pollination are exposed in gymnosperms, but enclosed in
angiosperms. Fortunately, the closed carpel at or before
pollination is a character that is sufficient to identify an
angiosperm alone. This was one of the characters used
here to resolve the affinity of Schmeissneria.
Two characters separated Schmeissneria from known gymnosperms: the vertical complete septum and the closed
apex of the central unit. Considering all available information and the definitions of plant groups, there were
two alternatives left to us: 1) accepting that Schmeissneria
as a new angiosperm in the Jurassic, or 2) proposing Schmeissneria as a new gymnosperm. Although the specialized features of the early Cretaceous angiosperm
Archaefructus [14] and other data [8,9] may imply the possible existence of angiosperms before the Cretaceous, Schmeissneria did not look like any known typical
angiosperm. However, this dissimilarity was conceivable
and understandable since 1) "angiophytes" had not

evolved any typical identifiable angiospermous character
[8], and 2) many angiospermous taxa were much more
diversified then and much of that diversification had since
become extinct [62]. Extreme caution should be exercised
when a Jurassic angiosperm, along with their relatives of
which we know very little, is compared with the extant
angiosperms.
If accepted as an angiosperm, because of its early Jurassic
age in Europe, Schmeissneria would push the origin of
angiospermy back to the Triassic. This would make the
claims of Triassic angiosperms [13,59-61], [63,64] less
surprising, and also help to bridge the gap between the
fossil record [3,5,10-12,65] and molecular data [66-72].
However, it should be kept in mind that Schmeissneria
might well represent early angiosperms still sporadic in
the vegetation dominated by gymnosperms, that it might
bear no direct relationship with any known angiosperm,
and that the presence of Schmeissneria in the flora was still
far different from the radiation and diversification of
angiosperms.

Conclusion
Schmeissneria is an interesting Jurassic plant that bears a
trait of angiosperms (two separated locules in a central
unit with a closed apex). This feature has a counterpart in
angiosperms (two carpels in the gynoecium). Based on
the current definition of angiosperms, Schmeissneria could
be classified as an angiosperm. Otherwise, a new group,
Schmeissneriales, would have to be established for Schmeissneria. The bottom line is that in whatever position
Schmeissneria is placed in the future, it increases the diver-

sity of seed plants and challenges people regarding the systematics of seed plants. Undoubtedly, Schmeissneria
requires further study.

gate fructification of irregularly disposed atropous,
pedunculate ovules/seeds with micropyle pointing to the
axis [24,77,78], a genus distinctly different from Schmeissneria [24]. These characters distinguish these genera from
Schmeissneria, which has paired female organs on a
peduncle that are arranged along the axis of the female
structure [24, also in this paper] (for details, see Table 2).
Schmeissneria sinensis Wang sp. nov.
Diagnosis: The same as that of the genus, except that
female organs are densely clustered along the axis of the
female structure and the peduncles of the female organ
pairs are short in this new species.
Description (see Results)
Holotype: 8604a.
Paratype: 8604b, 8604c.

Female structures spicate, with a slender axis. Axis of the
female structure longitudinally ribbed. Female organ pairs
connated basally, borne on a peduncle, arranged along
the axis of the female structure. Female organ with a central unit and a sheathing envelope. Envelope of undetermined number of parts, inflated, longitudinally ribbed
internally and externally. Central unit bilocular, astylous,
with a vertical septum, with longitudinal ribs distally both
internally and externally. Seed winged (?).
Type locality: Reundorf near Bamberg, Germany.
Further locality: Oberwaiz, Unternschreez (Lautner) and
Schnabelwaid (Creußen) near Bayreuth, Veitlahm, Pechgraben near Kulmbach, Großbellhofen, Rollhofen (Wolfshöhe) northeast of Nuremberg (all in Germany);
Odrowaz, Holy Cross Mounts, Poland; western Liaoning,
China.
Stratigraphic horizon: Liassic, lower Jurassic (Germany
and Poland); middle Jurassic (China).

Etymology: sinensis referring to China, for specimens
found in China.
Type locality: Sanjiaochengcun, Jinxi, western Liaoning,
China.
Stratigraphic horizon: the Haifanggou Formation, middle Jurassic; equivalent to Aalenian-Bajocian.
Depository: Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Beijing, China.
Remarks: The specimens described here and S. microstachys were from different continents and geological
epochs, and S. sinensis had more densely clustered female
organs and much shorter peduncles of female organ pairs
(0.5 mm rather than 2 mm long). Therefore, a new species, S. sinensis, was established for the specimens from
Liaoning, China.

Methods
Remarks: There are a few fossil taxa similar to Schmeissneria, including Ktalenia, Schizolepis, Drepanolepis, Caytonia,
Leptostrobus, and Karkenia. Among them, Schizolepis has
spirally arranged bilobate two-seed-bearing scales in bract
axils [73]; Drepanolepis has spirally arranged sickle-shaped
appendages bearing a single seed [74]; Ktalenia has oppositely arranged globose seed-bearing cupules with micropyle pointing downward [75]; Caytonia has oppositely
arranged globose multiple-seed-bearing cupules with
micropyles pointing to the axis [33,58]; Leptostrobus has
spirally arranged bivalvate multiple-seed-bearing cupules
in which the two valves share a common slit-like opening
pointing outward [76,44]; and Karkenia is an oval-elon-

The specimens were collected from Sanjiaochengcun
(120°21'E, 40°58'N), Jinxi, Liaoning, China (Fig. 5) in
1988. The bed yielding the present materials belongs to
the Haifanggou Formation [15-17,19]. Most people think
that the age of the Formation is middle Jurassic [1517,19,79-81]. The flora of the Haifanggou Formation
(including 122 species in 48 genera, dominated by a Coniopteris-Phoenicopsis assemblage) iscomparable to the Yorkshire flora (middle Jurassic) of England [79]. This
conclusion is supported by chronostratigraphy and other
fossils, including ostracodes, bivalves, insects, vertebrates,
and palynology [79]. Based on K-Ar, 40Ar-39Ar, Rb-Sr, UPb, and Sm-Nd datings, the volcanic rocks of the Lanqi

Formation (the formation just above the Haifanggou Formation) in Liaoning are 160 to 170 Ma old [79]. Thus,
under any circumstance, S. sinensis found in the Haifanggou Formation is older than the Lanqi Formation
[79] and at least 160 Ma old. The latest dating, based on
volcanic rock and biota, of the Daohugou Formation
(equivalent to the Haifanggou Formation) is Callovian to
Oxfordian (155 to 165 Ma) [82]. Furthermore, the European Schmeissneria are from the Triassic-Jurassic boundary
(Lias α [24]; lower Lias [28]). Considering all the evidence, the authors accept the age of S. sinensis as middle
Jurassic.
The studied specimens included two weakly coalified
compressions of female structures and one associated leaf.
Coaly membranes were found only on the surface of the
specimens (Fig. 3a), while most parts of the specimens
were replaced by unidentified minerals. The fossils were
exposed by trimming away the fine matrix. They were
observed under a Zeiss stereomicroscope, photographed
with a Nikon 4500 and a Nikon Stereomicroscope
SMZ1000 with digital camera DMX1200F. Some of the
specimens (Figs. 3b–f, 3j–o) were coated with gold and
observed under a Hitachi S800 SEM at Institute of Botany,
the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After SEM observations,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/14

a piece of specimen (Fig. 3d–f) was embedded in an Epon
812 resin, ground into a thin section, and observed with
the light microscope (Fig. 3i). One of the trimmed fragments was embedded in Epon 812 resin, ground, coated
with gold, and observed with the SEM again (Figs. 3g–h).
The SEM images were recorded on black-white negatives.
All photographs were later scanned, processed, and pieced
together for publication using Photoshop 7.0.
