new approaches to study the structure of the still poorly characterized repetitive DNA fraction, which accounts for 30-35%
of the urochordate genome [2]. Although rRNA and tRNA
families have been described, the different classes of transposable elements were not surveyed. Indeed, current information about ascidian transposable elements is limited to
only 1 Mb of genomic sequences [3]. These elements are,

information

The ascidian Ciona intestinalis has joined the select group of
fully sequenced genomes [1]. The draft sequence shows interesting features of an invertebrate chordate: a genome size of
153-159 megabases (Mb); base composition of 65% AT;
15,852 predicted transcripts; and a gene density of one per 7.5
kilobases (kb). Ciona genome organization lies between that
of protostomes (most animals other than echinoderms and

interactions

Conclusions: The genome of C. intestinalis harbors representatives of at least five clades of nonLTR retrotransposons. The copy number per haploid genome of each element is low, less than 100,
far below the values reported for vertebrate counterparts but within the range for protostomes.
Genomic and sequence analysis shows that the ascidian non-LTR elements are unmethylated and
flanked by genomic segments with a gene density lower than average for the genome. The analysis
provides valuable data for understanding the evolution of early chordate genomes and enlarges the
view on the distribution of the non-LTR retrotransposons in eukaryotes.

refereed research

Results: Consensus elements phylogenetically related to the I, LINE1, LINE2, LOA and R2
elements of the 14 eukaryotic non-LTR clades are described from C. intestinalis. The ascidian
elements showed conservation of both the reverse transcriptase coding sequence and the overall
structural organization seen in each clade. The apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease and nucleic-acidbinding domains encoded upstream of the reverse transcriptase, and the RNase H and the
restriction enzyme-like endonuclease motifs encoded downstream of the reverse transcriptase
were identified in the corresponding Ciona families.

Background: Non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons have contributed to shaping
the structure and function of genomes. In silico and experimental approaches have been used to
identify the non-LTR elements of the urochordate Ciona intestinalis. Knowledge of the types and
abundance of non-LTR elements in urochordates is a key step in understanding their contribution
to the structure and function of vertebrate genomes.

however, invariably found in eukaryotes and most probably
have contributed greatly to shaping the structure and function of vertebrate genomes [4].
Transposable elements are grouped into two major classes class I and class II - depending on the mechanism of transposition [5,6]. Class I elements can be further classified into
three categories: short interspersed nucleotide elements
(SINEs); long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons; and
non-LTR retrotransposons (also termed LINE-like elements
or retroposons). Although elements in the last category are
among the most abundant, frequency estimates vary greatly
depending on the species and the DNA segment considered,
as most copies are 5'-truncated. Full-length non-LTR elements contain either one or two open reading frames (ORFs),
all of them encode a reverse transcriptase, and some have
additional motifs [7-10]. On the basis of the reverse transcriptase, non-LTR retrotransposons have been clustered
into 14 different clades, the L1, L2, CR1, Rex1, RTE and R4
clades being the six major lineages present in vertebrates [1115]. In contrast to vertebrates, our knowledge of LINE-like
elements in other chordates is scanty: Cili-1 and Cili-2 [3] and
BfCR1 [16] are the only non-LTR elements reported in nonvertebrate chordates. If, however, non-LTR clades originated
before the divergence of the major animal phyla [11], urochordate and cephalochordate genomes should harbor representatives of these clades.
We have conducted an exhaustive search for non-LTR elements, initially on raw data and more recently on the draft
genome, of the urochordate C. intestinalis. Phylogenetic analysis based on the reverse transcriptase domain showed that
the ascidian elements grouped within five non-LTR clades.
The structural features of the non-LTR elements, copy
number, genome distribution and methylation status have
been analyzed and inferences on the evolution of chordate
genomes are presented.

Results
Non-LTR elements in the ascidian genome
Five consensus non-LTR retrotransposons, termed CiI, CiL1,
CiL2, CiLOA and CiR2, were derived from five, five, six, five
and five C. intestinalis scaffolds, respectively (Figures 1, 2 and
see Additional data file 1). TBLASTX comparisons showed
that the ascidian elements belonged to the I, LINE1, LINE2,
LOA and R2 clades (E-values: 4e-69 with Biomphalaria glabrata (snail) BGR, 2e-89 with Nycticebus coucang (slow loris)
L1, 2e-50 with Danio rerio CR1Dr2, e-146 with Aedes aegypti
Lian, and e-106 with Drosophila melanogaster R2, respectively). CiL1.2 (Figure 2b), derived from five scaffolds, was
another ascidian LINE1 element. It showed homology with
the Xenopus laevis Tx1 retroelement (E-value: 2e-40) but was
not further analyzed because it was significantly shorter than
CiL1 (CiL1.2 only encompassed the reverse transcriptase
region).

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/11/R73

All the Ciona elements encoded the conserved reverse transcriptase with the distinctive structural hallmarks defined as
block 0, 1, 2, 2a, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 [11] (Figure 2b). Although conservation of the thumb region (block 8 and 9) was weak, preservation of the ascidian sequences defining the CRE/R2/R4/
L1/RTE subgroup was still found. The apurinic/apyrimidic
endonuclease (APE) region was clearly identified in CiI, CiL1,
CiL2 and CiLOA (Figure 2a) on the basis of the reported
domains I to VII [17]. CiI and CiLOA also contained the
RNaseH (RNH) domain at the carboxylic end (Figures 1, 2d).
Concerning ORF1, partial sequences were assembled for CiI
and CiLOA, but a CCHC motif (single-letter amino-acid code)
in this region was only identified in the CiI element (Figure
2e). Finally, for CiR2, a restriction enzyme-like endonuclease
(REL-endo) containing the CCHC and KPDI motifs [18] was
found in the carboxy-terminal region, and a CCHH domain
and a putative c-Myb DNA-binding motif were identified at
the amino terminus (Figure 2c). Overall, the structure and
organization of the ascidian non-LTR retrotransposons is
consistent with those reported for each non-LTR clade.

Phylogenetic relationships of Ciona retrotransposons
The reverse transcriptase domain of non-LTR elements was
used to establish the phylogenetic relationships of the ascidian elements and the 14 reported non-LTR clades. In the
neighbor-joining tree (Figure 3), all clades were supported
with significant bootstrap values ($
70%), except clade I, with
the lowest bootstrap value (67%) in agreement with previous
analyses [11,12,14]. Therefore, ascidian sequences clustered
within five distinct clades: I, L1, L2, LOA and R2 (bootstraps:
67%, 70%, 97%, 100% and 100%, respectively), as a result of
which they were recorded as new members of such groups.

Copy number and genomic features
Fragments of about 300 nucleotides of the reverse transcriptase domain of each ascidian element were PCR amplified, cloned, sequenced and used for copy-number
estimations and methylation analyses. To quantify the copy
number for each element, two independent experimental
approaches - slot blot analysis and genomic library screenings
(Figure 4a,b) - were combined with in silico scores on the
number of Ciona scaffold-containing elements (Table 1).
When the reverse transcriptase was considered, the data from
the different approaches were consistent and mean values for
each element were in the range 3-7, far below the copy numbers of the vertebrate counterparts (Table 2). CiR2 slot-blot
analysis did not give a signal, in agreement with the low estimates obtained after in silico searches and library screenings.
Indeed, full-length copies could not be assembled for any of
the families after database searches. In silico estimates with
sequences that also encompassed the 5' and 3' sequences of
reverse transcriptase increased the numbers slightly: 9, 22,
24, 69 and 13 for CiI, CiL1, CiL2, CiLOA and CiR2, respectively (Table 1).

Discussion
Ciona non-LTR retrotransposons
The analysis of non-LTR elements in the urochordate Ciona
provides valuable data for understanding the evolution of
early chordate genomes and enlarges the view of the distribution of the non-LTR clades in eukaryotes. The Ciona genome
harbors: I, LOA and R2 elements, hitherto restricted to protostomes; L1 elements, formerly uncharacterized in invertebrates; and L2 elements, previously described in protostomes
and vertebrates.
Clade I was the least supported branch of our analysis (bootstrap value, 67%). However, ascription of CiI to this clade was
unambiguous as it shares with the other I elements the CCHC
motif and the APE, reverse transcriptase and RNH domains

information

Finally, the methylation status of the genomic regions containing the elements was investigated by comparing the
hybridization patterns of genomic DNA restricted with the
methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII, and the methylationinsensitive isoschizomer MspI. The identical HpaII and MspI
patterns obtained for all the elements (except for CiR2, which

gave no signal) supported the location of the ascidian elements in unmethylated genomic segments (Figure 4c).

interactions

Gene density and GC content in the surrounding retrotransposon sequences was estimated from 26 10-kb regions flanking CiI, CiL1, CiL2 and CiLOA elements of 17 scaffolds.
Overall, 16.5 genes were found in the 260 kb analyzed. Therefore, the average gene density (1 gene per 15.8 kb) was lower
than that of the whole genome (1 gene per 7.5 kb) [1]. However, no differences were observed when the GC content of
those segments (35.7%) was compared with the overall
genomic value (35%). Concerning CiR2, our data confirmed
the target specificity for rRNA genes associated with the RELendo domain: 9 out of 13 CiR2s were indeed linked to rRNA
sequences.

RNH. The phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase
domain together with the other structural hallmarks
improved the assignment of the Ciona sequence to the LOA
clade (bootstrap 100%). Finally, the phylogenetic analysis
and structural features clearly placed CiR2 within the R2
clade (Figures 1-3). As well as the reverse transcriptase, the
preservation in the deuterostome lineage of the distinctive R2
structural hallmarks, such as the REL-endo domain and the 5'
CCHH and c-Myb DNA-binding motifs, indicate the ancient
structural organization of this clade. Additionally, insertions
of the element near the Ciona rRNA genes suggest that target
specificity through the REL-endo mechanism has been preserved. Overall, not only does the analysis of CiI, CiLOA and
CiR2 agree with the origin of these retrotransposons in the
Precambrian era [11], but the fact that the urochordate elements resemble the protostome counterparts points to their
ancient structural organization.
We derived CiL1 and CiL1.2, whose structural organization
and phylogenetic relationship made them cluster within the
L1 clade (bootstrap 70%) and supported a previous BLAST

analysis of two short Ciona sequences [3]. Our data allowed
the first structural characterization of the L1 clade in invertebrates. CiL2 clustered within the L2 clade (bootstrap 97%), a
novel group of non-LTR retrotransposons closely related to
the CR1 and Rex1 clades [14], which includes members previously described in the protostome and deuterostome lineages
(Table 2). Interestingly, the CR1 and RTE clades, which are
also shared by protostomes and deuterostomes, have not
been identified in Ciona. Whether these clades were lost in
the whole urochordate subphylum needs further
investigation.

Retrotransposon frequency, genomic features and
genome evolution
Sequence analysis of the scaffolds harboring the non-LTR elements revealed that ascidian transposable elements are
flanked by regions of low gene density. However, no differences in GC content with respect to the average genome value
were found when comparing these genomic segments. Moreover, Southern analysis showed that ascidian non-LTR retrotransposons are unmethylated. Overall, these data suggest

In summary, ascidian and amphioxus genomes do not harbor
high copy numbers of retrotransposons. If this reflects the

The C. intestinalis non-LTRs were identified through a
TBLASTX [25] search on the Ciona genome draft deposited in
the JGI database [26]. The following non-LTR retrotransposons were used as queries: CRE1 from Crithidia fasciculata
(accession number M33009), CZAR from Trypanosoma
cruzi (M62862), Dong from Bombyx mori (L08889), L1 from
Rattus norvegicus (U83119), RTE1 from Caenorhabditis elegans (AF025462), Tad1 from Neurospora (L25662), R1 from
D. melanogaster (X51968), Jockey from D. melanogaster

NeSL-1 from C. elegans (Z82058), CR1 from Gallus gallus
(AAC60281) and Maui from Takifugu rubripes (AF086712).
The retrieved Ciona sequences were aligned by eye on the
basis of the DotPlot comparisons of the MegAlign program
from the DNASTAR package, and a consensus composite was
assembled. Sequence differences between scaffolds due to
nucleotide substitutions or indels were analyzed and the
sequence maximizing the similarity to reported elements was
selected. The non-LTR nature of each composite sequence
was further verified through a TBLASTX search against the
GenBank database. The consensus sequence was named after
the defined non-LTR clade to which it belonged. The CiI consensus sequence was derived from scaffolds 120, 148, 599,
1398 and 2116; CiL1 from 951, 1407, 1810, 3249 and 7743;

Conclusions

Non-LTR retrotransposons in the Ciona database

deposited research

The factors involved in retrotransposon control are still an
open question. The view that methylation evolved to suppress
the activity of transposable elements in vertebrates [20]
pointed to DNA methylation as a good candidate for transposition control in lower chordates. However, ascidian transposable elements are clearly unmethylated ([21] and this
study) and, hence, the genome-defense model cannot be
extended to urochordates, and perhaps not to cephalochordates, as the amphioxus BfCR1 element also belongs to the
unmethylated genomic fraction (Figure 4c). Among other
mechanisms, if required at all for retrotransposon control in
lower chordates, co-suppression, which operates on I elements in Drosophila [22,23] and in transposable element
silencing in plant genomes [24], is a possibility.

Materials and methods

reports

Copy-number estimates of the non-LTR elements in the
Ciona genome suffer from slight inaccuracies due to the
hybridization reaction, which disregards highly divergent elements, and to the fact that computational estimates only refer
to the available 90% of the genome. However, the agreement
between the in silico and experimental estimations indicates
that, in this case, the biases have been minimized. The data
show a low copy number per haploid genome of the different
ascidian elements: from 9 to 69 copies, which decreased to
three to seven copies when estimates were based on the
reverse transcriptase domain only. These values are far below
the vertebrate counterparts, but similar to numbers reported
for protostome genomes. This also seems to apply to another
lower chordate genome. In amphioxus (subphylum Cephalochordata) a low copy number has been reported for a nonLTR retrotransposon, BfCR1, [16] and for ATE1, a class II
transposable element [19].

condition of the pre-duplicative genome of the ancestor of the
vertebrates, substantial increases in the number of transposons in vertebrates could only have been attained after the
large-scale duplications that provided the raw material to
buffer the transposable element-induced genome rearrangements, and after the recruitment of methylation to control
transposable element mobility. Therefore, beyond the extensive duplications occurring at the origin of the vertebrates,
expansion of mobile elements linked to new roles for DNA
methylation would have to be considered as significant factors in the modeling of the highly complex genomes.

The in silico copy number of each repetitive DNA element was
estimated from the Ciona database. Two types of search were
performed. First, all the derived sequences were used to
retrieve scaffold-containing elements that matched with a
BLAST expect value of <10-3 [15]. To discard wrongly
assigned elements, a threshold was defined at the score value
of the first match of an element that belonged to another
clade. Second, for the sake of comparison with experimental
data, only the consensus reverse transcriptase region was
used for the search and the scaffolds showing a minimum
match of 300 nucleotides with the same BLAST expect value
were considered.

PCR amplification, cloning and sequence of non-LTR
elements
PCR amplifications with primers designed from the consensus reverse transcriptase sequence of each identified ascidian
non-LTR elements were performed with 250 pg of genomic
DNA and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (BioTherm) in 25 µl of
reaction volume containing 0.2 µM for each primer, 32 µM
each dNTP and 2 mM MgCl2. The sequences of the primers
were: CiL1-F (forward): 5'-AACTAGTGATACCGCGCC-3',
CiL1-R (reverse): 5'-ACACCTCGTTTGATCGG-3', CiL2-F: 5'-

GTTGAGGTAAATGGCGC-3', CiL2-R: 5'-CGTTCGTCATTATCTGGG-3', CiR2-F: 5'-TTCCGCAAGGTCGATG-3', CiR2R: 5'-CAGATAGGGCCCAATCC-3', CiI-F: 5'-CGATCTACCACCGACCAC-3',
CiI-R:
5'-GCTTGTCACAGGCAGTTG-3',
CiLOA-F: 5'-AACTGCGGAGATCCATGG-3' and CiLOA-R: 5'GTCGCAGTCTTGATGCGG-3'. PCR conditions were as follows: the initial denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min was
followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 45 sec, 53°C for 30 sec and
72°C for 30 sec and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. In
each PCR assay, a fragment of approximately 300 bp was
amplified and then cloned in a pUC18 plasmid and sequenced
using the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Genomic library screenings, slot and Southern blot
analyses
A C. intestinalis λZapII genomic library (kindly provided by
M. Levine) was screened with each of the fragments of the
identified Ciona non-LTR elements. The probes were labeled
with [α-32P]dCTP by random-hexamer priming and hybridized to phage DNA transferred on Hybond-N nylon filters
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in duplicate. Approximately 70,000 phages were screened. Hybridizations were performed in phosphate-SDS solution [27] at
65°C overnight. Two 15-min washes were performed at 65°C
in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 2 × 15 min at 65°C in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS

For phylogenetic analysis the C. intestinalis sequences were
added to a previous alignment by Malik [11], updated by adding the NeSL-1 (C. elegans, Z82058), LINE2 (Patella,
X77618; Danio rerio, AL591210; Oryzias, AB054295; Fugu,
AF086712) and Rex1 (Xiphophorus, AF155728; Batrachocottus, AAA83744) clades. The new alignment was generated
using Clustal X [28], maintaining the same pairwise gap penalties and multiple alignment parameters, and adjusted by
eye (see Additional data files 2 and 3). Phylogenetic analyses
were performed using the neighbor-joining method, rooted
with the reverse transcriptase sequence of Neurospora
organellar group II intron (accession number S07649) and
drawn with the TreeViewPPC program [29]. Confidence in
each node was assessed by 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

Gene density and GC content of the retrotransposon insertion
sites was assessed. Only the scaffolds that expanded at least
10 kb upstream or downstream from an element were considered. Gene density in the 10-kb flanking regions was calculated by scoring the predicted genes according the Ciona gene
model v1.0. When the gene sequence was only partially contained in the region analyzed, it was scored as 0.5.
