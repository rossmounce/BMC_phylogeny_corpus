Abstract
Background: The serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily constitutes a class of functionally
highly diverse proteins usually encompassing several dozens of paralogs in mammals. Though
phylogenetic classification of vertebrate serpins into six groups based on gene organisation is well
established, the evolutionary roots beyond the fish/tetrapod split are unresolved. The aim of this
study was to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of serpins involved in surveying the secretory
pathway routes against uncontrolled proteolytic activity.
Results: Here, rare genomic characters are used to show that orthologs of neuroserpin, a
prominent representative of vertebrate group 3 serpin genes, exist in early diverging
deuterostomes and probably also in cnidarians, indicating that the origin of a mammalian serpin can
be traced back far in the history of eumetazoans. A C-terminal address code assigning association
with secretory pathway organelles is present in all neuroserpin orthologs, suggesting that
supervision of cellular export/import routes by antiproteolytic serpins is an ancient trait, though
subtle functional and compartmental specialisations have developed during their evolution. The
results also suggest that massive changes in the exon-intron organisation of serpin genes have
occurred along the lineage leading to vertebrate neuroserpin, in contrast with the immediately
adjacent PDCD10 gene that is linked to its neighbour at least since divergence of echinoderms. The
intron distribution pattern of closely adjacent and co-regulated genes thus may experience quite
different fates during evolution of metazoans.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the analysis of microsynteny and other rare characters
can provide insight into the intricate family history of metazoan serpins. Serpins with the capacity
to defend the main cellular export/import routes against uncontrolled endogenous and/or foreign
proteolytic activity represent an ancient trait in eukaryotes that has been maintained continuously
in metazoans though subtle changes affecting function and subcellular location have evolved. It is
shown that the intron distribution pattern of neuroserpin gene orthologs has undergone substantial
rearrangements during metazoan evolution.

Background
The serpins represent a superfamily of proteins with a
common fold that cover an extraordinary broad spectrum
of different biological functions. Most serpins inhibit pro-

teases from one or several different clans of peptidases;
some superfamily members, however, exert disparate
roles, such as assisting in protein folding or transportation
of hormones [1]. This functional diversity is enabled, at

least in part, by the unusual structural plasticity of the serpin molecule that, in the native form, often takes a metastable structure. Serpins can perform their activity in the
extracellular space or in various subcellular compartments, including the secretory pathway routes [2,3], and
they are found in all high-order branches of the tree of life
[4]. Deficiency of some serpins, such as antithrombin or
neuroserpin, is lethal or may be associated with serious
pathology [5,6]. Mutations of the neuroserpin gene for
instance may result in formation of intracellular aggregates in the brain causing dementia [6], while wild type
neuroserpin provides protection of neuronal cells in cerebral ischemia and other pathologies [7]. Neuroserpin
inhibits tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinasetype plasminogen activator, nerve growth factor-γ, and
plasmin. These enzymes are also believed to represent
physiological targets of the inhibitor [8,9]. Native neuroserpin is found in the medium of some cell lines [9] but
also in dense core secretory vesicles of neuronal cells
[10,11], suggesting that it could exert a function within
the regulated secretory pathway, though there is no experimental evidence for this. Association of neuroserpin with
secretory pathway organelles is mediated via a 13 amino
acid C-terminal sorting sequence [11]. Recently, serpins
equipped with a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
retention/retrieval signal that efficiently inhibit furin and/
or other members of the proprotein convertase (PC) family have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster [12-15],
demonstrating for the first time that serpins with antiproteolytic activity may reside in early secretory pathway
organelles.
The elucidation of phylogenetic relationships among animal serpins poses a notorious problem [16]. Serpin genes
represent a substantial fraction of metazoan genomes,
often amounting to several dozens of members in mammals. In various vertebrate lineages multiple expansions
of serpin genes have occurred [17,18] resulting in numerous paralogs. In other lineages, such as fungi, serpins seem
to be rare. In some species phylogenetic relationships of
serpin genes may be obscured further by a propensity for
reciprocal or non-reciprocal exchange of cassette exons
coding for the hypervariable reactive site loop region
(RSL) [19]. The sequence of this region plays a primary
role in determining the specificity of serpin/target enzyme
interaction. Inhibition of target proteases involves cleavage of a scissile bond located between positions P1 and
P1' of the inhibitor's RSL [1]. Serpins also occur with a
patchy distribution in prokaryotes, but the time point of
their first emergence is not known [4].
In metazoans, serpin genes display highly variant exonintron patterns that, however, may be strongly conserved
within some taxons. Gene architecture and other rare
genetic characters constitute a robust basis to group verte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/250

brate serpins [20-22]. Grounded on number, positions,
and phases of introns, serpins have been classified into six
groups maintained at least since the fish/tetrapod split
(Figure 1). Vertebrate serpin genes with equivalent gene
structures often tend to be organised in clusters [22-24];
however, close physical linkage is not always found. Interestingly, none of altogether 24 intron positions mapping
to the core domain of vertebrate serpins is shared by all of
these six gene groups; however, characteristic amino acid
indels provide some further cues for unraveling phylogenetic relationships [20]. None of the group-specific vertebrate gene architectures is found in earlier diverging
animal taxons, though a few vertebrate-specific intron
positions are present in a scattered fashion in some basal
metazoans. Another classification system groups vertebrate serpins into nine clades [1]. However, a deeper rooting, resilient phylogenetic classification of metazoan
serpins is not available and their evolutionary roots are
unresolved. In addition, there is no data indicating when
and how the highly conserved exon-intron patterns of the
paralogous vertebrate serpin gene groups arose. Here, data
are presented that reveal a deeply rooting, continuous lineage of secretory pathway-associated serpins in metazoans
that provide a surveillance and controlling function
against proteolytic activity within the major cellular
export/import routes.

Results
Chromosomal arrangement of genes coding for
neuroserpin homologs along the lineages leading to
vertebrates
Group 3 of mammalian serpin genes contains five members (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/SERPINE1, nexin-1/
SERPINE2, SERPINE3, neuroserpin/SERPINI1, pancpin/
MEPI/SERPINI2) that share a highly conserved group-specific exon-intron pattern characterised by the presence of
six introns at equivalent positions. Another probably
homologous intron mapping to the N-terminal region
cannot be positioned unambiguously due to alignment
problems [20]. In the human genome, the genes coding
for neuroserpin and pancpin are co-localized in opposite
directions
on
chromosome

map_search.cgi?taxid=9606. Between these two serpin
genes and immediately adjacent to the neuroserpin gene,
but in inverse orientation, the PDCD10 (programmed cell
death 10) gene is found (Figure 2). PDCD10 is a strongly
conserved gene with orthologs in both vertebrates and
invertebrates. In humans, the gene product has been
shown to be part of a signaling complex involved in vascular development [25]; however, the exact function is
unclear and paralogs are not known [26]. Mutations in
the PDCD10 gene cause cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), a syndrome associated with seizures and
neurological deficits due to focal haemorrhages [26].

Figure 1
Gene structure-based phylogenetic classification of vertebrate serpins
Gene structure-based phylogenetic classification of vertebrate serpins. Positions of introns refer to the human α1antitrypsin sequence. A two amino acid indel present between positions 173 and 174 (α1-antitrypsin numbering) suggests that
groups 1, 3, and 5 are more closely related to each other than to the other groups. Gene groups 2, 4, and 6 lack the 173/174
indel and depict an intron at position 192a, implying shared ancestry. Some group 1 members contain an additional intron at
position 85c (not shown). For further details see references 20 and 21.
Downstream from the neuroserpin gene and in inverse orientation, the GOLPH4 marker is found that codes for a
transmembrane protein (GPP130) involved in endosome-to-Golgi traffic of proteins [27-29].
Studying the serpin complement of various metazoans we
noted that linkage of the PDCD10-neuroserpin-GOLPH4
triad is maintained in the genomes of chicken, the clawed
frog (Xenopus tropicalis), and the zebrafish (Danio rerio).
Current genome sequence releases also revealed synteny
of the pancpin gene with these three genes in the genome
of the clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), and conservation of
the close head-to-head association of the neuroserpin/
GOLPH4 gene pair in the Japanese pufferfish (Fugu
rubripes) (Figure 2) and in Tetraodon nigroviridis. Orthology of neuroserpin genes in these species is corroborated by
the highly conserved group 3 specific exon-intron gene
architecture (Figure 3), and a C-terminal extension (Figure
4) that targets neuroserpin to large dense core vesicles in
mammals [11].
Extension of microsynteny analysis to lancelets (Branchiostoma floridae) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) showed that a serpin gene is present in either of these
species in close vicinity to the PDCD10 gene (Figure 2). As

in vertebrates, these genes are arranged in a head-to-head
orientation. Sequence comparisons corroborated that the
Branchiostoma floridae serpin adjacent to PDCD10, denominated Bfl-Spn-1, is the ortholog of the previously characterised serpin gene Spn-1 from the closely related
Branchiostoma lanceolatum (92.2% sequence identity for
the C-terminal 385 amino acids) that was recently shown
to inhibit proprotein convertases [30]. Each of these serpins contains a highly conserved RSL region (positions P5
– P1': NMMKR ↓ S), and a C-terminal ER retention/
retrieval signal (KDEL) (Figure 4). The presence of an Nterminal signal peptide in lancelet Spn-1 mediating access
to the secretory pathway is supported by cDNA sequence
analysis and expression studies [30]. The gene cluster harbouring the PDCD10/Spn-1 gene pair includes a closely
related paralog (Bfl-Spn-2) of B. floridae Spn-1 (Figure 2)
that also has a counterpart in B. lanceolatum (not shown).
Similar to lancelets, the genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus revealed linkage of the PDCD10
gene to an inversely oriented serpin gene, named Spu-Spn1 (accession number: XP_001186705) within a 20 kb
DNA segment. Apart from synteny of its gene with
PDCD10, Spu-Spn-1 shares a signal peptide, a conserved
RSL region including the dibasic KR motif preceding the

evolutionary continuity extending from mammalian neuroserpin via Branchiostoma Spn-1 to Spu-Spn-1 from the
sea urchin. Groups 1, 3 and 5 of vertebrate serpins are discernible from groups 2, 4, and 6 by a two amino acid indel
following residue 173 (α1-antitrypsin numbering, ref.
[20]). The discriminating dipeptide sequence (previously
assigned adjacent to position 171, due to use of a different
set of aligned serpin sequences) is also found in Branchiostoma Spn-1, and in Spu-Spn-1 from Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus (Figure 5). Collectively, these data suggest that
a secretory pathway-associated serpin that already existed
at least since the emergence of deuterostomes gave rise to
mammalian neuroserpin.

and a variant (HEEL) of the canonical KDEL signal with
the corresponding lancelet serpin (Figure 4). The HEEL
motif was recently shown to mediate ER retention in
transfected HeLa cells [31]. Another feature corroborates

Inspection of genomes from deeper rooting metazoans
revealed PDCD10 orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster
and in C. elegans (Figure 6), depicting 49% and 39%
sequence identity at the protein level with their human
counterpart [26], but close linkage of this marker to a serpin gene is neither evident in the fruit fly nor in the worm.
In Drosophila melanogaster, genes of unknown functions
flank PDCD10, and in the nematode genome, the
PDCD10 microenvironment differs from that of both Drosophila and that of vertebrates (see Additional file 1), making identification of neuroserpin orthologs in these
species more difficult. Some data, however, suggest the
existence of a neuroserpin ortholog at least since the divergence of sponges and eumetazoans, believed to have
occurred at least 650 to 700 million years ago [32-34]. To
date, three serpin genes have been identified in the
genome of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis [34],

Figurepositions of PDCD10 genes in metazoans
Intron 6
Intron positions of PDCD10 genes in metazoans. Intron positions (white-on-black printing, phasing not indicated) were
identified with GENEWISE and mapped onto the protein sequences. Intron positions conserved in at least two species are
marked with an arrow head. Accession numbers for PDCD10 sequences: AAH16353 (human); XP_001186662 (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus); EDO34838 (Nematostella vectensis); AAF55190 (Drosophila melanogaster); CAA90115 (C. elegans).
coding for the signal peptide (accession number:
NW_001288761). The Spn-1 gene from lancelets harbours introns at positions 75c and 174a (α1-antitrypsin
numbering). This intron-poor gene architecture contrasts
with the mammalian neuroserpin gene that depicts the
characteristic group 3 exon-intron structure with introns
at positions 167a, 230a, 290b, 323a, 352a, and 380a (the
first intron of the neuroserpin gene mapping to the serpin
core domain, tentatively assigned to position ~90a, cannot be assigned reliably, due to alignment ambiguities).
Strikingly, none of these intron positions is conserved
among neuroserpin orthologs from lancelets, sea urchins
or vertebrates. There is also no congruence of the introns
at positions 75c and 174a in the lancelet Spn-1 gene with
any of the other vertebrate serpin genes (Figure 1). Obviously, massive changes have occurred along the neuroserpin gene lineage concerning exon-intron organisation

since divergence of echinoderms, cephalochordates and
vertebrates. The Spn-1 gene from Nematostella vectensis
also does not contain an intron mapping to the serpin
body (Figure 3).
Contrasting with the neuroserpin gene lineage, comparably
few changes are evident in the architecture of the immediately adjacent PDCD10 gene since the split of sea urchins
and mammals (Figure 6). The PDCD10 genes from
humans and Strongylocentrotus have four out of six intron
positions in common. Two introns (positions 50c and
186b, numbering based on the human sequence) seem to
have been lost in the sea urchin, since they are present in
the earlier diverging cnidarian, Nematostella vectensis. The
sea anemone PDCD10 gene contains eight introns, six of
which are found at equivalent positions in the human
homolog. Nematostella vectensis genes were recently dem-

onstrated to share the majority of intron positions with
their mammalian counterparts [34]. None of the PDCD10
introns of C. elegans superimposes on an intron found in
the orthologs from humans, the sea urchin, or the sea
anemone.

Discussion
The findings here reveal a clear history of neuroserpin, a
prominent group 3 vertebrate serpin. Features derived
from the genomic, gene and protein level provide ample
discriminatory data to enable drawing of a reliable kinship history of its previously unknown origin. Microsynteny analysis proved to be especially illuminating,
demonstrating that rare genomic characters can provide
very useful information for decoding of bonds in protein
families with intricate evolutionary history. Recent investigations provide a plausible explanation for the strongly
conserved syntenic association of PDCD10 and neuroserpin orthologs during diversification of deuterostomes.
Apparently, expression of the head-to-head arranged
genes is controlled by a bi-directional, asymmetrically acting promoter region inserted within the ~0.9 kb intergenic
region separating the transcription units coding for
PDCD10 and neuroserpin [35]. Dependence on the common regulatory region thus may have forced the maintenance of linkage of these genes. The rapidly increasing
flood of data from genome sequencing projects will certainly continue to provide further discriminatory information from multiple, independent levels of biological
organisation, such as codon usage dichotomy [36], to
enable robust classification of other metazoan serpins.
Neuroserpin orthologs from early diverging deuterostomes, like Strongylocentrotus or Branchiostoma, contain
classical ER retention signals (KDEL or HEEL) at their Cterminal ends, and the Nematostella Spn-1 sequence terminates with SDEL, which functions as an autonomous ER
retention/retrieval signal in HeLa cells, when hooked to a
reporter protein [31]. The C-terminal end of neuroserpin
from mammals, chicken, and Xenopus is HDFEEL (Figure
4). In HeLa cells, which express three different KDEL
receptors with overlapping, but not identical passenger
specificities, the FEEL sequence targets attached passenger
proteins primarily to the Golgi, though some 25% of cells
depict ER localisation [31]. In transfected COS cells, intracellular neuroserpin localises to either the ER or Golgi
[11]; in cells with a regulated secretory pathway, however,
neuroserpin resides in large dense core vesicles, mediated
by a C-terminal extension encompassing the last 13
amino acids, including the FEEL sequence [11]. Collectively, these data are compatible with the view that, in an
ancient ortholog of neuroserpin, a two amino acid insertion (FE) gave rise (in combination with additional residues?) to a modified sorting signal enabling a more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/250

specialised subcellular localisation. Irrespective of the still
fragmentary data concerning the phylogenetic classification of Spn-1 from the sea anemone, it is clear that surveillance of the secretory pathway routes by serpins is an
ancient and conserved trait in eukaryotes. Whether the Cterminal extensions of neuroserpin orthologs from fishes
(Figure 4) are functional secretory pathway address signals remains to be determined.
The regional changes of placement within the secretory
route may have come along with diversifications associated with the inhibitors' functions due to changes within
the RSL region. Neuroserpin from vertebrates is believed
to interact with its preferred target enzyme, tPA, via the
single Arg residue (P1 position) in the RSL region [9]. In
lancelets, the scissile bond is preceded by the dipeptide
motif Lys-Arg (KR), which is characteristic for substrates
and inhibitors of proprotein convertases, which indeed,
have been identified as target enzymes of lancelet Spn-1
[30]. Similar biochemical properties are expected for Spn1 from the sea urchin, and Spn-1 from the sea anemone
(Figure 4). The physiological interaction partners of these
inhibitors have not yet been identified.
Though the data clearly indicate that the roots of mammalian neuroserpin may be traced back far in the history of
animals, unequivocal support for a neuroserpin ortholog
in arthropods is still lacking. Several labs have provided
evidence for a serpin (Spn4) with furin inhibiting activity
and containing a canonical ER targeting signal in Drosophila [13-15], and a similar protein has been detected in
Anopheles [37]. However, caution should be advised,
because homoplasy due to convergent evolution currently
cannot be excluded. The Spn4 gene is prone to recombination events, especially in the regions coding for the RSL
region [19]. Unraveling the relationships of the Spn4 gene
from fruit flies and neuroserpin orthologs from deuterostomes requires further investigation.
The history of the neuroserpin/PDCD10 gene pair reveals
some remarkable insights into the evolution of the exonintron structure of metazoan genes. Even closely adjacent
genes that are physically linked at least since divergence of
echinoderms and chordates may be subject to quite different trends affecting the intron distribution patterns. Comparably few changes in the exon-intron architecture have
happened in PDCD10 orthologs since divergence of lineages leading to sea anemones and vertebrates (Figure 6).
In PDCD10 genes, six out of eight intron positions occurring in humans or in the cnidarian are conserved. This is
in accordance with findings demonstrating that the
majority of genes from early diverging present-day
eumetazoans are intron-rich with most introns apparently
maintained since ancient times [34,38]; for serpin genes,

however, the situation appears to be different. Regardless
of the still rudimentary evidence for the putative sea
anemone neuroserpin ortholog, the available data show
that serpin genes in Nematostella vectensis are intron-poor.
The sea anemone Spn-1 gene does not contain any introns
mapping to the serpin body, and the single serpin core
intron identified in one (accession number:
XP_001627750) of the currently known three Nematostella vectensis serpin genes maps to residue 42c (α1-antitrypsin numbering; not shown). Looking up at
deuterostomes, the sea urchin neuroserpin ortholog SpuSpn-1 is also devoid of introns within the region coding
for the serpin core. In contrast, the Spn-1 genes from Branchiostoma floridae (Figure 3) and its close relative, Branchiostoma lanceolatum [30] each depict two introns mapping
to identical sites within the serpin body. Their positions,
however, are not congruent with any of the introns of
mammalian neuroserpin, the prototype group 3 vertebrate
serpin gene or with any other intron location known from
vertebrate serpin genes [20]. Therefore it must be considered that, in the serpin lineage leading to mammalian neuroserpin, an appreciable fraction of introns is not ancient,
but may have been acquired during metazoan evolution;
however, it cannot be excluded that intron paucity in
present-day serpin genes of cnidarians (and in neuroserpin
orthologs from sea urchins and lancelets) is due to massive intron loss, in contrast to most other introns that have
survived hundreds of millions of years in these creatures.
Intron gain is possibly not as rare as sometimes believed
[39], however, it could be confined to certain gene families and/or to discrete evolutionary phases [40], for as yet
unexplored reasons. Several types of processes have been
proposed that may explain how introns may be acquired,
but definite answers are still awaited.

Methods
Identification of serpin DNA and protein sequences and
microsynteny analysis
Serpin protein and DNA sequences of various genomes
were extracted from publicly accessible databases (see
Additional file 2) via the BLAST software package (including PSI-BLAST) using key words or the human α1-antitrypsin
sequence
for
searching.
Chromosomal
microsynteny analysis was performed using the NCBI
Map Viewer [41], the ENSEMBL genome browser [42], the
JGI genome browser [43], the Tetraodon genome browser
[44], the UCSC genome browser [45], and inspecting the
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome database [46].
Sequence alignments, gene structure analyses and
mapping of intron positions
Alignments of protein sequences were performed with
CLUSTAL X [47] and refined manually in GeneDoc [48].
Intron positions were identified and assigned with GENEWISE [49]. Mature human α1-antitrypsin was used as reference for mapping of positions and phasing of introns in
serpin genes [20].

Conclusion
In this study, we analysed and resolved the evolutionary
roots of neuroserpin, a secretory-pathway associated
mammalian serpin. Insight into the intricate history of the
multi-membered serpin superfamily beyond the fish/
tetrapod split was obtained by showing that orthologs of
neuroserpin exist at least since the emergence of deuterostomes and probably already since divergence of eumetazoans and Bilateria. The continuous presence of
neuroserpin orthologs equipped with C-terminal signal
sequences assigning residence within the secretory pathway documents that serpins functioning as guards of the
cellular export/import routes represent an ancient trait.
This surveillance role has been subject to subtle functional
and local variances during evolution as evidenced by
changes within the RSL and the subcellular address signal.
In contrast to many other, even closely linked genes, in
which the majority of intron positions has been conserved
for hundreds of millions of years, the intron distribution
pattern of neuroserpin gene orthologs has experienced
massive changes, perhaps dominated by intron gain.
