Abstract
Background: Character mapping on phylogenies has played an important, if not critical role, in
our understanding of molecular, morphological, and behavioral evolution. Until very recently we
have relied on parsimony to infer character changes. Parsimony has a number of serious limitations
that are drawbacks to our understanding. Recent statistical methods have been developed that free
us from these limitations enabling us to overcome the problems of parsimony by accommodating
uncertainty in evolutionary time, ancestral states, and the phylogeny.
Results: SIMMAP has been developed to implement stochastic character mapping that is useful to
both molecular evolutionists, systematists, and bioinformaticians. Researchers can address
questions about positive selection, patterns of amino acid substitution, character association, and
patterns of morphological evolution.
Conclusion: Stochastic character mapping, as implemented in the SIMMAP software, enables
users to address questions that require mapping characters onto phylogenies using a probabilistic
approach that does not rely on parsimony. Analyses can be performed using a fully Bayesian
approach that is not reliant on considering a single topology, set of substitution model parameters,
or reconstruction of ancestral states. Uncertainty in these quantities is accommodated by using
MCMC samples from their respective posterior distributions.

Background
Mapping characters on phylogenies provides a historical
framework essential to our understanding of the evolution of behavioral, morphological, ecological, and molecular traits [1-3]. In addition, knowledge of the patterns of
character change along a phylogeny has proven valuable
to our understanding of the process of selection [4,5] and
neutral evolution [6-8].
The parsimony method is almost universally used to map
characters. Indeed, user friendly programs that implement
the parsimony method are available (e.g., MacClade, [9]

and Mesquite, [10]). Parsimony attempts to minimize the
number of changes along a phylogeny in a manner that is
consistent with the character states observed at the tips.
This is accomplished by identifying character states at the
internal nodes of the tree that produce the minimum
number of changes. Unfortunately, parsimony has a
number of significant limitations. First, and most importantly, it assumes that along any branch that only a single
change has occurred, regardless of the evolutionary time
spanned. Second, parsimony can severely underestimate
the variance in ancestral state assignments by considering
only those ancestral reconstructions that minimize the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/88

number of changes on the phylogeny. Finally, parsimony
does not provide a framework for accommodating uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction.

Given a topology, branch lengths, and substitution model
parameters a character history can be sampled using the
following three-step algorithm. Briefly,

Two alternative approaches have attempted to address
some of the drawbacks inherent to parsimony: maximum
likelihood [2] and Bayesian inference [11]. Both use stochastic models of character state change and thus can
explicitly accommodate uncertainty in ancestral states.
The Bayesian approach accommodates phylogenetic
uncertainty by evaluating character maps on trees sampled from the posterior distribution [11,12]. However,
these methods still rely on parsimony to determine the
identity of the character state changes and thus suffer from
the restriction of placing, at most, a single state change
along a branch. One way of avoiding these problems is to
estimate the rates of character change using maximum
likelihood rather than explicitly mapping changes to the
tree [13]. While, for many questions, this approach will be
appropriate, it unfortunately lacks information about the
location and identity of specific character state changes on
the phylogeny.

1. Calculate conditional likelihood for each character state
at each node of the tree, including the root,

Bayesian mutational mapping
The mutational mapping approach [14-16], recently
introduced, does not suffer from the problems of parsimony or the limitations of hybrid methods. In addition,
this approach estimates the timing (placement) of
changes along branches, providing a novel level of inference previously unavailable. While this Bayesian
approach offers a better framework for addressing questions about character evolution we should recognize that
as with all methods factors such as the use of an incorrect
substitution model (or the model's assumptions) [17] or
improper priors could lead to incorrect inferences [18].

A character, or mutational, map represents the character's
history across the phylogeny. What we would like to
accomplish is to sample character histories in proportion
to their posterior probabilities. Formally, we would like to
evaluate the following distribution,
Pr (M | D) =

∑ ∫vk ∫θ Pr(M | D,θ ,τ ,)p(τ k , vk ,θ | D)dvk dθ ,

k∈ψ

(1)

where M are character histories, D is the data, θ is a vector
containing parameters of the substitution model, τ is the
topology, v is the vector of branch lengths associated with
τ, and ψ is the set of possible topologies. The dimensionality of the problem, for all but the simplest topologies,
prohibits a direct analytical evaluation. Fortunately,
methods such as MCMC can be used to sample topologies, branch lengths, model parameters, and character histories [15]. The following describes the algorithm
implemented in SIMMAP.

2. Simulate ancestral states at each internal node by sampling from the posterior distribution of states, and
3. Simulate a substitution (mutational) history, by sampling from the posterior distribution conditioned on the
reconstructions in step 2 and observed states at the tips of
the topology. The waiting times between substitutions are
drawn from an exponential distribution with the rate
being the diagonal elements of the model's instantaneous
rate matrix (Q), conditioned on the current state (see
below).
Often the states at the tips of the tree are unknown or
uncertain (e.g., ?, N, R, etc). This type of uncertainty can
easily be accommodated by revisiting these nodes after
simulating ancestral states for the internal nodes and
repeating Step 2 for the tips. By following this algorithm
we have obtained a single sample (or realization) of a
character history.
Let us look more closely at each of these steps. The first
step in the algorithm requires the calculation of conditional likelihoods, l, of each state at each internal node of
the tree. Given instantaneous rates of substitution given
by the model's Q matrix and the length of the branch (v)
associated with the node we can easily calculate substitution probabilities as P = pij(v) = eQv. In a number of cases,
such as the JC69 model [19], analytical solutions have
been described. In cases in which analytical solutions are
unavailable standard linear algebra approaches for exponentiating matrices can be used (e.g., LAPACK [20]). With
these probabilities we can efficiently calculate the conditional likelihoods using the post-order traversal pruning
algorithm of Felsenstein [21].
Next, we want to sample ancestral states at the internal
nodes of the tree using the conditional likelihoods calculated in step 1. Starting at the root of the tree, denoted as
σ, we stochastically simulate a state d using the following,

Pr(dσ = i | D,τ ,θ ) =

lσ ,iπ i

∑ j∈ Ω lσ , jπ j

,

(2)

where, for example, Ω = {A, C, G, T} for DNA.
Once we have sampled a state at the root, dσ we simulate
ancestral states at each internal node using a pre-order
traversal tree by sampling from the following,

Page 2 of 7

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:88

Pr(dσ − 1 = j | dσ = i, D,τ ,θ ) =

lσ −1,i Pij (tσ −1 )

∑ k∈ Ω lσ −1,k Pik (tσ −1)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/88

.

( 3)

Now, we have assigned ancestral states at the internal
nodes. The final step of the algorithm we will simulate a
realization of character history along each branch (using a
pre-order traversal) conditional on the ancestral reconstructions and observations at the tips of the topology.
Each realization is simulated using a continuous-time
Markov chain in which substitutions are modeled as a
Poisson process. The waiting times until a character
change along a branch for the Poisson is

λ eλv

(4)

with the rate λ = -qii. This rate is derived from the diagonal
elements of the model's Q matrix. These elements can be
interpreted as the overall rate of changing from state i.
Waiting times are simulated using the inverse transformation method. If the waiting time is longer than the branch
length, v, and the states at each end of the branch are the
same, then the realization is complete; no changes have
occurred along this branch. However, if the waiting time
is smaller than the branch length, v, then a substitution is
qij
drawn from, pij =
, and a new waiting time is simu−qii
lated using the new length, v - v1. If this next waiting time
exceeds the remaining length of the branch, and the states
are the same, the realization is complete. On the other
hand, if the states are different, the process is repeated
from the ancestral node, because the realization is not
consistent with the state at the descendant node. If we
were to proceed from the previous transformation on the
branch the waiting times would no longer be exponentially distributed.
While we could sample a character history without first
sampling ancestral states (Step 2 above) this would substantially increase the computational time required. The
reason for this is that most of the histories would be
rejected because they are not consistent with the observed
data. This would require a new history for the whole tree
to be re-sampled rather than simply rejecting the history
along a single branch as in the algorithm above. It should
be remembered that we want to sample histories conditional on the observations at the tips of the tree – Pr(History|Data). By sampling ancestral states from their
posterior distribution first we are reducing the number of
histories that are rejected and increasing the acceptance of
samples from the desired probability distribution.

Often, we are primarily interested in inferring some aspect
of a character's evolution and not the particulars of the
phylogeny or other parameters. We would like to avoid
making inferences based on a single topology because it is
rarely known with certainty. Rather we would like to integrate over this uncertainty. Therefore, to accommodate
uncertainty in both model parameters and the phylogeny
SIMMAP samples character histories for each parameter
sample from the posterior distribution; topologies and
parameter values are thus sampled in proportion to their
posterior probabilities. Samples from these distributions
can be obtained by MCMC using software such as
MrBayes [22]. A sample of character histories obtained in
this way can then be summarized to test a variety of
hypotheses, such as, the number of gains and losses of a
trait, correlated character evolution, number of synonymous and non-synonymous changes, patterns of amino
acid evolution (e.g., rates of conservative versus radical
substitution), and the placement and order of changes on
the phylogeny. In this latter type of analysis we are interested in only those histories that are consistent with presence of a particular group. The absence of a group in a
particular topology sampled from the posterior poses no
problem as the hypothesis is now conditional on its presence; topologies not consistent with the presence of a
group can be ignored and the resulting sampled histories
are from the conditional distribution.
In addition to implementing the above approach of stochastic posterior character mapping, SIMMAP also allows
sampling from posterior predictive densities to evaluate
the significance of hypotheses [16,23]. Briefly, this
method generates a distribution of character histories
under a null hypothesis which are summarized by a test
statistic and then compared to the observed test statistic.
For example, it is straightforward to test for nonrandom
associations between characters (see below). The predictive probability of the observed test statistic can be calculated using the tail areas of the statistic under the null
model. (For a more detailed description of predictive distributions, see [24].)

Implementation
Brief overview
SIMMAP is Graphical User Interface (GUI) program written to run on the Apple's OS X operating system. SIMMAP
reads in 1) a NEXUS data file containing a matrix of DNA,
RNA, or morphological (standard) characters, 2) a file
containing trees in the Newick format, and 3) a text file
containing DNA substitution model parameter values.
Data, trees, and parameters are displayed graphically and
can be manipulated by the user. For example, characters
and taxa can be included, excluded, and trees can be
rooted and a variety of, a priori, branch lengths can be
applied. Trees and character maps are drawn with user

SIMMAP can be used to sample character histories on
phylogenies to address questions about evolutionary patterns of change, positive selection at focal sites or across a
gene region, and correlation among characters. In addition, SIMMAP can be used to calculate the posterior distribution of ancestral states. SIMMAP is a software
implementation of the approach described by Nielsen
[23] and Huelsenbeck et al. [16] with a couple of minor
extensions. First, SIMMAP effectively deals with uncertain
or unknown character states at the tips of the tree (see
above). Second, new test statistics for measuring covariation between characters are implemented as described
below.
Substitution models
SIMMAP implements stochastic substitution models for
both molecular and standard characters. When analyzing
nucleotide data the user can implement the most general
4 × 4 model of DNA sequence evolution [25], and all submodels. Among site rate variation can be accommodated
using a discrete gamma [26], invariable sites, or site-specific models [27]. Parameters for the models can be set
manually by the user, read in from the contents of a file,
or a mixture of the two.

Morphological character evolution is implemented using
the Mk class of models [28], with up to 7 states. Two priors

are placed on morphological models: a discrete gamma
prior on the overall rate of morphological character evolution, and a discrete symmetrical beta prior on the bias
parameter of the M2model [16,29]. The user can customize these priors by selecting the parameters of the prior
distributions and the number of categories used to make
the distribution discrete. The number of samples drawn
from the priors can be adjusted to allow a sufficient sampling approximation of the posterior distribution on bias
and rates. For binary characters, the posterior distribution
of the bias parameter can be used to make inferences
about the pattern of evolution while accommodating
uncertainty in the underlying phylogeny and branch
lengths.
There is no clear rule of thumb as to the values of the
parameters for the prior distributions or how many samples should be drawn to provide a sufficient approximation. Users should try a variety of parameter values and
sample sizes to ensure that their inferences are not changing dramatically.
Character histories
SIMMAP allows the user to explore single character histories visually one at time, or perform multiple realizations
of sampling from the posterior of character histories. The
analyses can be tailored to evaluate a single character
(nucleotide, codon, or standard character) or multiple
characters, on a single tree or a set of trees, over a set of
model parameters or priors, and with a user defined
number of samples.

SIMMAP summarizes character histories across the phylogeny using the posterior expectation of different statistics
(Table 1). Briefly, SIMMAP reports the expected number
of changes (e.g., Ile ? Leu), the direction of changes if the
tree is rooted (e.g., Ile ? Leu), the types and expected
number of changes on each branch (e.g., number of nonsynonymous/synonymous changes), and the correlation
between characters. In addition to these summary statistics the details of each individual history can be written to
a file as a tab delimited file for analysis by an external program. SIMMAP also offers the option of saving the raw
character history data in a modified Newick tree format.
For example, a character history for a three taxon tree is
represented in the following way:
((Taxon1:{A,0.1;C,0.1},
Taxon3:{C,0.4})

Taxon2:{T,0.1;C,0.1}):{C,0.1},

where a branch is divided into intervals representing the
character's history along the branch. The history is
described in the curly brackets following a tip or internal
node of the tree in a tip to root encoding. For example,
from the tip node, Taxon2, backward in time to its ances-

tor the mutational history along this branch is described
as {T,0.1;C,0.1}; from the tip to the ancestor a T is
observed for a length of 0.1 followed by a C with a length
of 0.1 terminating in this state.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/88

When analyzing nucleotide data the following statistics
have been implemented for the overall correlation (7)
and state-by-state correlations (8):
(o)

Significance is assigned using predictive p-values which
can be selected to test hypotheses about the number of
synonymous/non-synonymous changes, nucleotide character association (correlation), and morphological character association. The user can customize the design of the
predictive test by controlling the number of replicates,
which trees, model parameters, and prior values are used.
SIMMAP provides the user the ability to place constraints
on a number of aspects of the analysis; the user can 1) fix
ancestral states at individual nodes of a tree to a particular
state or set of states, 2) constrain the analysis to particular
trees by defining clade constraints, and 3) root trees using
one or more outgroup species. In addition, SIMMAP will
calculate the posterior probability of ancestral states using
an empirical or hierarchical Bayesian approach.
Character correlation statistics
Often we would like to know whether two characters, or
particular character states, covary on the phylogeny. For
example, morphological studies addressing hypotheses
regarding correlated evolution or ecological studies testing for associations between a character and a particular
environment. Character histories can be used to address
these questions using SIMMAP. A number of measures of
correlation are implemented for nucleotide and morphological characters and their states.

state j on the phylogeny.

where, C, is a positive constant representing Yate's correction term for continuity (C = 0.5).
In addition, SIMMAP implements a statistic similar in
form to the mutual information content statistic (MIC)
for both nucleotide and morphological data types. As
implemented in SIMMAP, this statistic evaluates the correlation between character histories along the phylogeny
for two characters. This statistic takes the following form
for state-by-state correlations,

mij = fij log 2

fij
fi f j

( 9)

,

where fij is the fraction of time state i is associated with j in
a character history, and fi (fj) is the fraction time in a particular state independent of associations. By averaging
over all state associations we get the following statistic for
the overall character correlation:
x

Statistics for measuring morphological character and state
associations, first described by Huelsenbeck et al. [16],
have been implemented in SIMMAP to test for state-bystate associations (eqn. 5) and overall character correlation (eqn. 6):

M = ∑ ∑ mij .
i =1 j =1

( 10 )

Regardless of the statistic used significance is determined
by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution of
the statistic to form a null distribution of no character (or
state) association. For example, predictive p-values for the
M statistic would be calculated in the following way,

p=

1 N
∑ I(T(Mobs ) ≥ T(Mi )),
N i =1

( 11 )

where N is the number of realizations. In practice, the
expectations of the statistics are used to summarize histories over trees, model parameters, and, if applicable, priors.
