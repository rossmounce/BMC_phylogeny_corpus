Abstract
Background: The Strait of Gibraltar separating the Iberian Peninsula from North Africa is thought
to be a stronger barrier to gene flow for male than for female lineages. However, the recent
subdivision of the haplogroup H at mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) level has revealed greater genetic
differentiation among geographic regions than previously detected. The dissection of the mtDNA
haplogroup H in North Africa, and its comparison with the Iberian Peninsula and Near-East profiles
would help clarify the relative affinities among these regions.
Results: Like the Iberian Peninsula, the dominant mtDNA haplogroup H subgroups in North Africa
are H1 (42%) and H3 (13%). The similarity between these regions is stronger in the North-West
edge affecting mainly Moroccan Arabs, West Saharans and Mauritanians, and decreases eastwards
probably due to gene flow from Near East as attested for the higher frequencies of H4, H5, H7,
H8 and H11 subgroups. Moroccan Berbers show stronger affinities with Tunisian and Tunisian
Berbers than with Moroccan Arabs. Coalescence ages for H1 (11 ± 2 ky) and H3 (11 ± 4 ky) in
North Africa point to the possibility of a late Palaeolithic settlement for these lineages similar to
those found for other mtDNA haplogroups. Total and partial mtDNA genomic sequencing unveiled
stronger mtDNA differentiation among regions than previously found using HVSI mtDNA based
analysis.
Conclusion: The subdivision of the mtDNA haplogroup H in North Africa has confirmed that the
genetic differentiation found among Western and Eastern populations is mainly due to geographical
rather than cultural barriers. It also shows that the historical Arabian role on the region had more
a cultural than a demic effect. Whole mtDNA sequencing of identical H haplotypes based on HVSI
and RFLP information has unveiled additional mtDNA differences between North African and
Iberian Peninsula lineages, pointing to an older mtDNA genetic flow between regions than
previously thought. Based on this new information, it seems that the Strait of Gibraltar barrier
affected both male and female gene flow in a similar fashion.

Background
Bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the North and the
Sahara desert in the South, North Africa behaved as an
anthropological island in the African Continent. Previously, only the Strait of Gibraltar in the West and the Suez
Isthmus in the East connected this region to Europe and
the Near East respectively. These two passageways were
the most probable migratory routes followed by human
intercontinental dispersals since prehistoric times. In
addition, periodic wetter climatic conditions allowed contacts with sub-Saharan African peoples across the Sahara
desert and seafaring achievement brought numerous
Mediterranean and Atlantic cultures to the North African
shores [1]. Archaeological information points to a modern human occupation of this area since 45,000 years ago
(ya), as attested by the Aterian industry [2]. However,
there is no unanimous assent about the degree of human
continuity since that time, as some of the posterior Palaeolithic industries (Iberomarusian, Dabban) exhibit no
clear cultural connections with the earlier Aterian form.
Furthermore, there is also controversy about the demic
impact of the Near East Neolithic on the Northwest African autochthonous Capsian Neolithic [1]. Even more tenuous are the putative connections of the Aterian with the
Solutrean of Iberia, or those of the Capsian with the Mediterranean Neolithic [3]. Nonetheless, it is agreed that the
historic penetration in the area of the Pharaonic and classical Mediterranean cultures, ending with the Islamic
domination, imposed strong cultural influences with only
a minor demic impact [4,5]. Population genetic studies
using classical markers pointed to a sizeable Upper Paleolithic component in Northwest African populations [6],
whereas the Neolithic diffusion in that region was more a
cultural than a demic process [7]. More recently, the haploid characteristics of the uniparental genetic markers
allowed the successful application of phylogenetic and
phylogeographic approaches to population genetics.
Thus, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeographic
analyses have enhanced the power of this maternal nonrecombining marker to detect human migrations on continental [8-10] and regional [11-14] scales. Focusing on
North Africa, several mtDNA studies have shown that, in
spite of an important Sub-Saharan African contribution,
the majority of the lineages detected in this region belong
to, or have common roots with, Eurasian haplogroups
[15-23]. Some of these haplogroups, including the X1
[12], U6 [11,13] and M1 [13,14], although of West Asian
origin, have Paleolithic coalescence ages in North Africa.
Others seem to be of more recent acquisition as a result of
European (U5, V [24-26]) or Middle Eastern influences
(R0a, J1b, U3 [17,27-29]). In agreement with classical
markers and mtDNA, in an early analysis of Northwest
African populations using paternal Y-chromosome variation, it was proposed that the main haplogroups defined
by the M78 and M81 binary markers could be the paternal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/8

counterparts of the classical and maternal Paleolithic
components [30]. However, more recent studies in which
those and other markers were further subdivided suggested a predominantly Neolithic origin for the Y-chromosomal DNA variation in North Africa [20,22-34].
The discrepancies in the uniparental marker results could
be due to real differences in male and female demographic histories [35]. However, a lack of mtDNA haplogroup resolution could also be responsible. Recently, the
accurate dissection of the most frequent Western Eurasian
haplogroup H into several monophyletic subhaplogroups
[36,10][37-40] changed a rather uniform genetic landscape into one with several regional peaks and clinal variations. Thus, the frequencies of H1 and H3
subhaplogroups are highest in Western Europe, decreasing gradually to the East. In contrast, H2 occurs more frequently in Eastern than in Western Europe. Besides, there
are subhaplogroups that characterize other regions, such
as H6 and H8 in Central Asia, H13 in the Near East, H20
and H21 in the Caucasus, and H18 in the Arabian Peninsula. Haplogroup H is also the most frequent clade in
North Africa. Global frequencies are highest in the Northwest, representing 37% and 34% of their mtDNA lineages
in Berber and Arab speaking Moroccans [15], 24% [41]
and 32% [19] in Berber Algerian samples and 26% in
Tunisian Berbers [20]. The frequencies drop slightly
southwards, showing 24% in Saharans [15] and 23% in
Mauritanians [42], as well as eastwards displaying 21%
[16] and 14% [21] in Egyptian samples. The aims of this
paper are: 1) to subdivide the North African haplogroup
H lineages into its known subhaplogroups, 2) to establish
the phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns of these
subhaplogroups in the region, and 3) to compare them
with those present in Europe and the Near East, in order
to establish the strength of the human migrations from
both continents into North Africa in spatial and temporal
dimensions.

Results
As described previously, total frequencies for the haplogroup H decline toward both the East and the South
(Table 1). The haplogroup H represents 44% of the
mtDNA variation in the Iberian Peninsula, but only 22%
in the Near East. Likewise, this distribution still reaches
25% in North Africa, but drops to only 9% in the Arabian
Peninsula. Haplogroup H subclade distribution is also
very different in the various regions. Subhaplogroups H1
and H3 are the dominant subgroups in the Iberian Peninsula (45% and 16%, respectively) and North Africa (42%
and 13%, respectively) whereas unclassified H haplotypes
(H*) account for 40–50% of the H diversity in the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East. Furthermore, while H1
(12%) is still the most frequent subgroup, followed by the
H5 (8%) in the Near East, the modal subclades in the Ara-

bian Peninsula are H2a1a (18%) and H6b (14%). Pairwise FST distances based on sub-haplogroup frequencies
display a high heterogeneity among the main regions
(Table 2). However, the level of statistical significance
between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa (p < 0.05)
is lower than that for any other pairwise comparison (p <
0.001). In addition, within North African populations,
the Tunisians, Tunisian Berbers and Moroccan Berbers are
different from the Saharan and Moroccan Arabs, while the
last two are comparatively less different from the Iberian
Peninsula. The relative proximity of the Iberian Peninsula
to the westernmost North African populations is graphically reflected in Figure 1a. It is evident that Tunisians and
Berbers are closest to the Near East and the Arabian Peninsula. A principal component analysis (PCA) points to subhaplogroups H1 and H3 as being primarily responsible
for the Iberian-Moroccan-Saharan connection, whereas
H4, H5, H7, H8 and H11 testify the Near East influence
(data not shown). Similarly, haplotypic based FST distances show a strong influence of the Iberian Peninsula on
the Western Moroccan and Saharan North African populations, and indicate that Tunisians are comparatively the
most remarkably influenced by the Near East (Table 2 and
Figure 1b). Globally, North Africa shares a similar number
of haplotypes with the Iberian Peninsula compared with
the Near East (Table 3). However, a detailed analysis of
the ratios between haplotypic identities relating each
North African population with the Iberian Peninsula or
the Near East confirms that the Western populations,
comprising Moroccan Arabs, Saharans and Mauritanians,
are the most notably influenced by the Iberian Peninsula,
whereas the Tunisian Berbers, Tunisians, and the Moroccan Berbers have received relatively more gene flow from
the Near East (Table 3). At this point, it is noteworthy that
all the Arabian Peninsula haplotypes shared with North
Africa are a subset of those shared by the latter with the
Near East, pointing to a minor direct input of the Arabian

Peninsula on the North African populations. Haplogroup
(Table 1) and haplotype (Table 3) genetic diversities demonstrate that the Northwestern African populations
(Moroccan Arabs and Saharans) are genetically less
diverse than the more central Tunisian and Berbers, a fact
that could be explained by a stronger Near East influence
on the later populations. Although global haplogroup
and haplotypic diversities are not statistically different
among regions (Table 1 and 3), the European subgroup
H1 appears to be significantly more diverse in the Near
East (87 ± 5) than in the Iberian Peninsula (75 ± 3) or
North Africa (67 ± 6). Moreover, the genetic diversity for
the Western European subgroup H3, which is absent in
the Near East, is also higher in North Africa (74 ± 9) than
in the Iberian Peninsula (65 ± 6). Transformation of
molecular genetic diversities in coalescence ages gives
18,345 ± 4,051, 14,201 ± 2,984, and 11,366 ± 2,354 years
for H1 in the Near East, Iberian Peninsula and North
Africa, respectively. On the other hand, the coalescence
ages for H3 in the Iberian Peninsula (10,342 ± 2,634) and
North Africa (10,866 ± 4,107) are similar. However, only
H1 ages in Near East and North Africa are statistically different from each other.
The relative affinities among regions are based on subhaplogroup frequencies, which do not take into account differences between haplotypes assorted in the same
subgroup, or in haplotypic matches, whose identity is
based only on partial HVSI sequences. In addition, it has
to be taken into account that half of the H lineages
detected in North Africa are not shared with other regions
and that this percentage is even greater in the putative
source regions of the Near East (70%) and the Iberian
Peninsula (76%). These facts point to a higher differentiation among regions and between populations than those
observed previously. Indeed, complete or nearly complete
sequencing of some apparently identical samples indi-

cates that the real genetic heterogeneity among regions is
greater than those estimated above (Figure 2). To begin
with, the HVSI motif 16093 -16189 that characterizes subgroup H1f was found in an individual (Mor 2047) from
Morocco (Figure 2) also in an H1 background. This subgroup is particularly abundant and mainly restricted to
Finland and the surrounding populations [36]. At first
sight, this coincidence would seem to point to a new link
between North European with North African populations
like that found previously for U5b1b [26]. However, in
this case, further analysis of the coding region in the
North African sample revealed a lack of the three coding
region mutations that additionally characterize the Finish
H1f subgroup [38] (Figure 2). This lack of identity
between haplotypes assorted in the same subgroup and
sharing the same or similar HVSI motif can be extended to
other cases. For instance, there is a group of H sequences
that shares the 16145 – 16222 HVSI motif consistently
found in Northwestern Africa, the Sahara and several

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/8

Western Sahelian populations [15]. The complete
sequencing of a Mauritanian sample (Mau 2027) allowed
the assignation of this type to the subhaplogroup H1 (Figure 2). The direct connection of this motif with a German
sequence was previously suggested [15]. However, the
additional presence of transitions 16304 and 456 in the
HVSI and HVSII regions respectively in that German haplotype [43] indicated that it should be classified as belonging to the H5 instead of the H1 subgroup, which does not
support a direct link between these regions. In contrast,
the two 16145 – 16222 haplotypes sporadically detected
in the Iberian Peninsula [[44] and unpublished results]
belonged to the North African subgroup as they shared
the coding 10257 mutation, in addition to the H1 diagnostic transition 3010, with the totally sequenced Mauritanian sample (Figure 2). It seems that the 10257
transition defines a new subgroup within H1. This fact
points to a possible, although not recent, North African
demic influence on the Iberian genetic pool. Another
interesting group of sequences belonging to the H1 subgroup in North Africa is that characterized by the 16172 –
16311 motif, which we [15] and others [19] have found
mainly in Saharan samples. Haplotypes with, or including, this HVSI motif have also been detected in European
[45,43,8][46-49] and in Asian [50-54] samples, but not in
the Iberian Peninsula yet (see Additional file 1). However,
the possibility of direct phylogenetic links among such
distant regions is very weak, because all of those individuals further classified in both regions belong to the H5 subgroup or the HV haplogroup [48,49] in Europe, or to the
HV or the R2 haplogroups [53,54] in the Middle East,
which strongly points to yet another case of HVSI convergence in distinct backgrounds of coding regions. In addition to the CRS, the 16189 and the 16311 HVSI motifs are
quite abundant in North Africa (see Additional file 1).
However, when these samples were screened for the coding region positions observed in completely sequenced
European or Middle East individuals that held the same
HVSI motifs (Figure 2), none of these positions appeared
in the North African samples. This lack of homogeneity
again strongly points to their different monophyletic coding backgrounds, in spite of their HVSI matches, a fact
repeatedly found in other studies [38]. Indeed, in this
study, there are also instances of molecular convergence
in the coding region. Sequences How 73H and Jor 843
share the 12236 transition, although they respectively
belong to the H* and H5 subgropups (Figure 2). The
12358 transition also presents one such case that is shared
by four sequences (Her 127, Ach 28, MM H2, and Mau
2027) belonging to different H subgroups (Figure 2).

Discussion
The dissection of mtDNA haplogroup H in North Africa
has confirmed several genetic features of its populations.
First, there is a significant genetic differentiation between

Northwestern, Central and Eastern populations already
detected since the first genetic studies carried out in North
Africa using classical genetic polymorphisms [6]. This differentiation has also been found by posterior molecular
analyses using Y-chromosome markers [31-34] or X-chromosome SNPs [55]. Second, as Arab and Berber communities are present in both areas, geographic isolation,
more than cultural barriers, seems to be the main cause of
this genetic differentiation. This has been consistently
reported in all previous studies using autosomal short tandem repeats [4], autosomal Alu insertion polymorphisms
[56,57], high-resolution Y-chromosome analyses
[30,58,59], and mtDNA polymorphisms [19,20,22,23].
As a consequence, it has been proposed that the North
African gene pool has had Palaeolithic and Neolithic
influences from the East, but that the impact of the historical invasions, such as the Arabic role, had more a cultural
than a demic effect. The lack of exclusive haplotypic
matches between North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula
found here is in accordance with that hypothesis. Third,
the southward clinal diminution of haplogroup H frequencies found at mitochondrial level is well explained as
a counteracting effect of the northward clinal diminution

of the Sub-Saharan maternal gene flow [15,5,19]. Fourth,
the genetic heterogeneity detected between the North African and the Iberian Peninsula populations has been
attributed to both the effect of the physical barrier
imposed by the Strait of Gibraltar and strong cultural differences. However, some gene flow has been detected
between areas and its strength depends mainly on the type
of marker used. The strongest barrier effect has been
detected in analyses based on Y-chromosome polymorphisms [30]. The levels of gene flow detected in autosomal studies have been of more diverse range [4,56] and,
in some cases, seem to depend on the population samples
used as is the case with, for instance, the CD4/Alu microsatellite haplotypes [60,61]. In contrast, a high female permeability has been deduced from several mitochondrial
studies that pointed to the existence of an important
maternal Iberian input on North Africa [15,19]. Although
there is no archaeological evidence to justify such a demic
flow from Iberia to North Africa, based on the phylogeographic range, comparative gene diversity and ages of several mitochondrial haplogroups such as V, H1, H3, and
U5b1b [25,37,26], the presence of these haplogroups in
North Africa is thought to be the result of a southward

expansion of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers from the
Franco-Cantabrian refuge after the Last Glacial Maximum.
In fact, coalescence ages for H1 and H3 subclades estimated in this study are in good agreement with those previously published and are congruent with these
expansions. Thus, our HVSI based coalescence ages for H1
(14.2 ± 3.0 ky) and H3 (10.3 ± 2.6 ky), in the Iberian
Peninsula, are very close to those published by Pereira et
al. [40] in the same area for H1 (14.0 ± 3.0 ky) and for all
of Europe for H3 (11.0 ± 3.0 ky). Furthermore, striking
similarities are observed when these ages are compared to
those obtained from the coding region in similar geographic ranges, using the Mishmar et al. calibration [62].
Thus, H1 coalescence ages for Iberia (13.0 ± 6.0 ky; [40])
and Southwest Europe (12.8 ± 2.4 ky; [37]) are very similar between themselves, and not significantly different
from those based on the HVSI. Likewise, H3 coding region
based coalescence ages for whole Europe (9.0 ± 3.0 ky;
[40]) and Southwest Europe (10.3 ± 2.4 ky; [37]) are also
very similar to those based only on the HVSI. That Palaeolithic expansion would explain the notorious presence of
H1 and H3 detected mainly in the most North-western
populations of North Africa and the decrease in their frequency eastwards. However, if this hypothesis held, the
comparatively high diversity of H1 and H3 in North Africa
would point to an important Palaeolithic gene flow from
the Iberian Peninsula to North Africa across the Strait of
Gibraltar. On the contrary, a consensus exists regarding
the Near East origin of the bulk of the Y-chromosome and
mtDNA North African lineages. However, discrepancies
still exists with respect to the time in which these settlements most probably occurred. In the first Y-chromosome
pioneering studies of the region, a Palaeolithic settlement
for the autochthonous E-M81 clade was hypothesized in
accordance with the age proposed based on classical
markers [30]. However, later studies have assigned this,
and other subclades derived from E-M78, that are particularly abundant in North Africa, a Neolithic or even historic settlement age and a Near East or Northeast African
source [63,31-34]. On the other hand, for those mtDNA
haplogroups pre-eminent in North Africa, that have been
analyzed at deep genomic and phylogeographic levels,
such as U6 and M1, a Palaeolithic settlement and Middle
East roots have been proposed [11,13,14]. From our data,
it can be also deduced that the presence of the H1 and H3
subgroups in North Africa could have similar expansion
times as in Europe and, therefore, a late Palaeolithic settlement in the region. Finally, it should be noted that the different levels of gene flow detected throughout the Strait of
Gibraltar, with respect to Y-chromosome and mtDNA polymorphisms have been attributed to sexual migratory differences, with females showing more permeability than
males due to patrilocality and polygyny [5,60,19], and to
genetic drift differently affecting both sexes [22,59]. However, the first explanation is not in accordance with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/8

demographic flows known to have occurred between
Morocco and Iberia across the Strait of Gibraltar. Historically, the main human movement from Northwest Africa
to the Iberian Peninsula was the Islamic Invasion. As a
military enterprise, it is believed that this North African
gene flow into Iberia was mainly a male contribution. If
genetically important, it would homogenize the male lineages between Iberia and North Africa to a greater extent
than the female lineages, in contradiction to the experimental results. Little is known about prehistoric contacts
between these two areas, but human movements repeatedly crossing the Gibraltar Strait to establish patrilocality
seems improbable. The lack of deep sequence identity for
several mtDNA haplotypes assorted in the same H subgroup and considered haplotypic matches between North
Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, clearly points to the
existence of a higher mtDNA heterogeneity between these
two regions than suggested in previous studies. If the
greater level of differentiation established for H in the
present study were extendable to other mitochondrial
haplogroups, the female levels of gene flow between both
areas would match approximately those of males. Further
mtDNA studies at genomic level are necessary to test this
hypothesis.

Conclusion
The subdivision of mtDNA haplogroup H in North Africa
has confirmed that the genetic differentiation found
among Western and Eastern populations is mainly due to
geographical rather than cultural barriers. It also appears
that the historical Arabian role on the region had more a
cultural than a demic effect. Whole mtDNA sequencing of
apparently identical H haplotypes, based on HVSI and
RFLP information, has unveiled additional mtDNA differences between North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula,
pointing to the Strait of Gibraltar barrier as affecting male
and female gene flow in a similar fashion.

Methods
A total of 5,115 mtDNA sequences were analyzed. Of
these, 1,231 belonged to the haplogroup H, defined as 7025 AluI by RFLP screening. Four main geographic areas
were covered by this study: the Iberian Peninsula (593 H
individuals from a total of 1,349), North Africa (224 H
individuals from a total of 880), the Near East (265 H
individuals from a total of 1,201) and the Arabian Peninsula (149 H individuals from a total of 1,685). Detailed
origin and geographic localization for all the samples are
specified in Additional file 2. From the 1,231 individuals
classified as H, 1,114 could be assorted into one of 19 different H subgroups by further screening for characteristic
HVSI and/or HVSII sequence motifs, or diagnostic RFLPs
(see Additional file 3). Analyzed individuals that could
not been assorted into any of the known groups were considered as H* types. In addition, complete or nearly com-

plete mtDNA sequencing was carried out on 6 individuals
with haplotypes found only in well-defined geographic
areas or with HVSI haplotypic matches between very distant regions with the aim of accessing whether these
matches also held for their coding regions (Figure 2,
[64,65,36,9,10,66,62,37,67,49]). Furthermore, in order
to find out additional subdivisions, those individuals presenting HVSI matches with already published complete
haplogroup H sequences were screened for all coding
region positions they hold (Figure 2). DNA extraction,
primers, conditions used for PCR amplifications and total
or partial sequencing have been published previously
[9,29]. RFLP analyses and subhaplogroup H nomenclature (see Additional file 3) were as in Loogväli et al. [38]
and Roostalu et al. [68]. Haplogroup and haplotype diversities (h) as well as molecular genetic diversities (π) were
calculated according to Nei et al. [69]. Only HVSI positions from 16,024 to 16,365 were used for genetic comparisons of partial sequences with other published data.
Phylogenetic relationships among HVSI and genomic
mtDNA sequences were established using the reduced
median network algorithm [70]. Ages of clades were estimated using the rho statistic [71], and a calibration of 1
transition within np 16090–16365 corresponds to 20,180
years [72] for HVSI sequences.
For population comparisons, FST distances were calculated
based on haplogroup and haplotype frequencies using
Arlequin 2.0 [73]. In order to diminish the strong influence of the common haplotypes in FST distances, an additional measure of haplotypic identity [IHT = (HTXY/
(HTX·HTY)] was used, where HTXY is the number of
shared haplotypes between populations X and Y, and HTX
and HTY are the numbers of different haplotypes in the
populations X and Y, respectively. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots were obtained from FST distances and
principal component analysis (PCA) from haplogroup
frequencies using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Illinois).
