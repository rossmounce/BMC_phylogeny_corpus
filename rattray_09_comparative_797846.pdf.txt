Abstract
Background: The fatty acids of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria contain
linearly concatenated cyclobutane moieties, so far unique to biology. These moieties are under high
ring strain and are synthesised by a presently unknown biosynthetic pathway.
Results: Gene clusters encoding enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis in the anammox bacterium
Kuenenia stuttgartiensis and 137 other organisms were analysed and compared in silico to gain further
insight into the pathway of (ladderane) fatty acid biosynthesis. In K. stuttgartiensis four large gene
clusters encode fatty acid biosynthesis. Next to the regular enzyme complex needed for fatty acid
biosynthesis (FASII), the presence of four putative S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) radical enzymes,
two enzymes similar to phytoene desaturases and many divergent paralogues of β-ketoacyl-ACP
synthase (fabF) were unusual. Surprisingly, extensive synteny was observed with FASII gene clusters
in the deltaproteobacterium Desulfotalea psychrophila. No ladderane lipids were detected in lipid
extracts of this organism but we did find unusual polyunsaturated hydrocarbons (PUHC), not
detected in K. stuttgartiensis.
Conclusion: We suggest that the unusual gene clusters of K. stuttgartiensis and D. psychrophila
encode a novel pathway for anaerobic PUFA biosynthesis and that K. stuttgartiensis further
processes PUFA into ladderane lipids, in similar fashion to the previously proposed route of
ladderane lipid biosynthesis. However, the presence of divergent paralogues of fabF with radically
different active site topologies may suggest an alternative pathway where ladderane moieties are
synthesised externally and are recruited into the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis.

Background
Anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidizing) bacteria are
unusual specimens of the phylum Planctomycetales [1].
They play an important role in the oceanic nitrogen cycle
[2-5] and are applied at industrial scale to remove ammonium from wastewater [6,7]. Anammox catabolism uses 1
mole of ammonia and 1.32 moles of nitrite to produce
dinitrogen gas in the absence of oxygen [8]. Exploitation
of this energy source under anaerobic conditions is
thought to have resulted in the evolution of unique cellular architecture [9,10]. For example, the cell membranes
of anammox bacteria are comprised of linearly concatenated cyclobutane moieties, aptly named 'ladderane' lipids [11]. Ladderane lipids consist of units containing
either 3 or 5 linearly fused cyclobutane moieties that can
be synthesised into a variety of lipid structures; fatty acids
(Figure 1), alcohols, mono-ethers, di-ethers and mixed
ether-ester phospholipids [12,13].
The first hypothesis for the mechanism of ladderane lipid
biosynthesis was proposed by Sinninghe Damsté et al.
and involved ring closure of a C20 polyunsaturated fatty
acid at C9 and C20 (C12 macrocycle formation) with subsequent carbon-carbon bonding, to create the linearly fused
cyclobutane moiety [13]. Due to the structural similarity
of the ladderane lipid moieties, the number of cyclization
steps could then be increased or reduced to synthesise the
3 or 5 cyclobutane containing moieties. Mascitti and
Corey [14] suggested that ladderane biosynthesis could
occur via a cascade type polycyclization, using a substrate
like the allenic C20 fatty acid 9,10,12,16,18,19-docosahexaenoic acid. Despite the fact that allenic fatty acids are rare
in the natural environment and to the best of our knowledge have only been reported to occur higher plants [1517], anaerobic bacteria including other Planctomycetes

have been reported with the ability of synthesising lipids
containing multiple double bonds [18-20].
Fatty acid synthesis in bacteria and plants usually occurs
via type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII), as recently reviewed
by White et al. [21]. In Escherichia coli, FASII is made up of
seven separate soluble proteins, each encoded by a discrete gene. Figure 2 displays the sequence of events during
FASII biosynthesis, with additional information given in
Table 1. A crucial component in this pathway is the acyl
carrier protein (ACP) that transports lipid intermediates
(as ACP thioesters) between different enzymes in the
FASII pathway. In the initiation module, ACP is activated,
condensed with malonyl CoA (using Malonyl-CoA:ACP
transacylase, FabD) and undergoes the first condensation
reaction via β-Ketoacyl-ACP Synthase III (FabH). After
leaving the initiation cycle the acetoacetyl-ACP intermediate enters the elongation cycle (via FabB or FabF) where
four enzymatic reactions catalyse the growth of the lipid
chain by two carbons per pathway cycle. The gene products of the paralogues fabB and fabF, are similar in both
protein crystal structure and catalytic function. These two
isozymes condense the growing acyl-ACP with malonylACP to extend the chain by two carbon atoms, and can
differentiate between the entrance of a growing lipid
chain or a new lipid chain. However, it has been demonstrated that mutants of E. coli lacking in FabB are incapable of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis [22] and mutants
lacking in FabF were unable to control fatty acid synthesis
in response to temperature [23].
After FabB and FabF, the lipid intermediate undergoes
reduction of the carbonyl group by the NADPH dependant β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG), producing the intermediate β-ketoacyl-ACP. The isozymes FabA and FabZ (βhydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases) perform the third step in
the elongation cycle, the initiation of unsaturated fatty
acid biosynthesis in the growing lipid chain. β-hydroxyacyl-ACP is initially dehydrated to yield a double bond in
the C2–C3 region, creating trans-2-butenoyl-ACP. This
product can then proceed in the cycle to have the double
bond reduced by FabI (enoyl-ACP reductase), or alternatively, FabA can isomerise e.g. trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to cis3-decenoyl-ACP that bypasses FabI and is used by FabB to
initiate the first cycle of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis [24]. At the last step of the cycle, FabI reduces the double bond (C2–C3) in trans-2-decenoyl-ACP, using NADPH
as the electron donor. The fatty acid then resides in the
elongation cycle until the required acyl chain length is
achieved, at which point the fatty acid is released from the
cycle to undergo further processing into intact membrane
lipids. FASII is also a versatile pathway; it can be used for
synthesising various lengths of normal straight chain fatty
acids, hydroxy, iso and ante-iso branched fatty acids and

non-lipid cellular metabolites including molecules for
quorum sensing and lipoic acid [21].
Initial analysis of the K. stuttgartiensis genome has provided several clues to the potential pathway of ladderane
lipid biosynthesis [25]. In K. stuttgartiensis, four gene clusters putatively encode fatty acid biosynthesis. Apart from
encoding typical FASII enzymes, three clusters additionally contain genes encoding unusual S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) radical enzymes. The ability of these enzymes
to catalyse diverse and unusual reactions [26-28] was the
basis of the proposal that SAM radical enzymes perform a
key role in the biosynthesis of ladderane lipids [25]. In
addition to SAM radical enzymes, other genes not normally associated with fatty acid biosynthesis were also
detected. In this study we aimed to provide further insight
into ladderane biosynthesis in anammox bacteria, by
applying detailed analysis and functional prediction of K.
stuttgartiensis gene products and comparing these with
fatty acid gene clusters from a diverse range of bacterial
and archaeal genomes.

Methods
Database retrieval and data assessment
Genomic information from the K. stuttgartiensis genome
was extracted from the Protein Extraction, Description
and Analysis Tool PEDANT [29] and National Centre for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases [30].
Amino acid sequences encoding lipid biosynthesis in
other organisms were retrieved from a selection of online
databases; The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) [31], The Institute for Genomic
Research (TIGR) [32] and NCBI [30]. Basic logical align-

ment search tool (BLAST) searches were performed using
KEGG blast [31] and NCBI blast [33]. Amino acid
sequences were analysed using MEGA 3.1 [34] and
aligned using Clustal W [35] with a Gonnet protein
weight matrix. Protein active sites were identified by comparison to predetermined protein crystal structures available on the Research Collaboratory for Structural
Bioinformatics (RCSB) protein data bank (PDB) [36]. For
phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequences were aligned
using Clustal W and manually refined. Minimum evolution phylogeny with bootstrapping (500 re-samplings)
was performed using MEGA 3.1 [34]. Protein active sites
were determined using (Conserved Domain Architecture
Retrieval Tool (CDART) [37] and the conserved domain
database (CDD) [38]. Alignment of sequences using this
database, are related to the percentage similarity of residue conservation patterns from other members of that
particular protein family. Protein sequences were also
blasted using Conserved Domain Search (CD-Search)
where the proteins are compared using similarities in
architecture rather than sequence alignment [39].
Comparative genomics
Lipid gene clusters from the genomes of a representative
selection of 137 different organisms publicly available in
the databases in June 2006 were compared with the four
gene clusters of K. stuttgartiensis. The genomes were
screened for gene clusters that contained at least two
canonical fatty acid biosynthesis genes and two of the
accessory genes present in the gene clusters of K. stuttgartiensis. Genes were considered homologous when they
shared at least 20% amino acid identity over at least 70%
of the length [25]. The screening was performed with a

Biomass culturing and extraction and analysis of lipids
Biomass of the anaerobic psychrophilic sulphate-reducing
bacteria bacteria Desulfotalea psychrophila was cultured at
DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen GmbH), and grown according to DSMZ protocols [40]. Biomass was frozen, freeze-dried, ultrasonically extracted, saponified and analysed for lipids as
described previously [13]. The total lipid extract was analysed using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described
previously [41]. For identification of molecular ions of
selected compounds the lipid extract was analysed by GC/
Chemical Ionization (CI)/MS. These were performed
using a HP 6890 Series GC System (Hewlett Packard)
equipped with a 25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.12 μm CPSil 5CB
(Chrompack) silica column coupled to an HP 5973 Mass
Selective Detector. Helium was used as a carrier gas and
CH4 as the reaction gas.

Ladderane lipid analysis was performed using the high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-MS/MS procedure of Hopmans et al. [42]. Stable carbon isotope analysis of individual lipids was performed as described in
detail elsewhere [43]. The isotopic composition of the
extra carbon added during sample derivatization was
determined using derivatizing agents with known isotopic
compositions and subsequently adjusting the isotopic
compositions of the fatty acids and alcohols. δ13C values
of the sodium lactate crystals used as the carbon source for
D. psychrophila were determined using elemental analysis
isotope ratio monitoring (EA-IRM)/MS as described previously [41].

Results
Comparative genomics analysis
K. stuttgartiensis contained equivalents of most genes that
encode FASII biosynthesis in E. coli (Table 1; Figure 2).
However, genes encoding FabA were not located, suggesting that K. stuttgartiensis is incapable of producing unsaturated fatty acids via the conventional FASII pathway. Most
of the genes that were present existed as a single copy, but
multiple paralogues of acyl carrier protein (acp, 3 copies)
and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (fabB and fabF, 7 copies)
were identified in the lipid gene clusters. Multiple copies
of acp were also present in Mycobacteria and in organisms
employing polyketide biosynthesis (e.g. Shewanella sp.). A
distant relative to K. stuttgartiensis, the planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica and the unrelated sulphate-reducing deltaproteobacterium
Desulfotalea
psychrophila
both
contained 5 fabB/F paralogues.

We studied in detail the active site residues essential for
the functioning of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases, since deviation in active site residues could point to the use of alternative substrates by different paralogues. The K.
stuttgartiensis paralogues Kuste3606, Kuste2805 and
Kuste3348 display significant differences in the 'active
site' residues (Table 2), whereas the primary structures of
the active site of the other five fabF sequences were highly
conserved. As seen in Table 2, the R. baltica fabF paralogues RB 3714 (NP_865682) and RB 4527 (NP_866153)
also miss the active site cysteine (Cys163) that is substituted for a negative hydrophilic amino acid, Asp and Glu
in the respective samples. Deviations in the sequences of
these two paralogues of R. baltica are very similar to those
observed in K. stuttgartiensis and is consistent with the
grouping of these paralogues together in the phylogenetic
tree in Figure 3. The upper section of the minimum evolution phylogenetic tree shows the 'standard' fabF gene
sequences from a selection of bacteria (Kustd1386 in K.
stuttgartiensis), and the middle section shows the grouping
of unusual fabF paralogues that have conserved active
sites. The lower section of the tree displays the putative
fabB (Kuste2805) and fabF paralogues (Kuste3348,
Kuste3606) all of which are classified by NCBI CDD [38]
as having similarities to beta-ketoacyl protein synthase,
but do not have the same essential active sites found in the
E. coli fabB/F crystal structure. Therefore, information in
Table 2 and Figure 3 indicates that Kuste3348, Kuste3606
and Kuste2805 are unlike the other fabB or fabF paralogues in K. stuttgartiensis or other organisms analysed,
thus suggesting a different enzyme substrate and function.
The remaining part of the recognised FASII gene products
were found to be usual with respect to amino acid
sequence, including conserved residues and the number
of paralogues.
K. stuttgartiensis contained FASII gene clusters with six
genes encoding putative SAM radical or methylase
enzymes and two genes with some homology to phytoene
dehydrogenases. To determine just how unusual this combination is, we searched databases for the occurrence of
similar gene clusters in other organisms and found that
such clusters were rare but not unique. Some deltaproteobacteria (D. psychrophila, members of the genus Geobacter
and Pelobacter carbinolicus) contained similar gene clusters
(Figure 4a). The synteny with D. psychrophila was striking,
apart from the presence of similar SAM and 'phytoene
dehydrogenase' genes, a gene encoding a new membrane
protein with unknown function and a 'phenylacetyl-CoA
ligase' were also in synteny, the pairwise identity of these
'unusual' enzymes is shown in Figure 4(b).
A small number of open reading frames in the K. stuttgartiensis gene clusters were not in synteny with gene clusters in D. psychrophila and had little sequence similarity

with open reading frames in other organisms. Proteins
with no formally assigned function were Kuste3352 (an
unknown protein containing a domain classified under
the VacJ (lipoprotein like) superfamily), Kuste3351 (a
conserved hypothetical protein with domains similar to a
polysaccharide deacetylase), Kuste3347 (a hypothetical
protein with conserved domains indicative of a SAM
methyl transferase), Kuste2803 (a hypothetical protein
with conserved domains indicative of a SAM radical
enzyme with an additional B12 binding domain) (Figure
4a). In particular, Kuste3347 was unlike other currently
defined methyl transferases. To further investigate, this we
constructed a minimum evolution phylogenetic tree of
closest relatives of Kuste3347 (Figure 5). Homology was
previously established by using sequences with a statistically significant similarity and a consistent pattern of
shared residues when multiply aligned. For comparative
purposes the closest BLAST hits, including the experimentally characterised SAM methyl transferase MenG (UBIE
MICLU) were used [44]. In Figure 5 the gene sequence of
Kuste3347 appears to have evolved separately in comparison to the other methyl transferases involved in ubiquinone synthesis. The early divergence of Kuste3347 and
large difference in sequence similarity suggests that this
protein may have evolved a separate function, making it a
candidate for the production of unusual lipids.

Apart from the FASII gene clusters, we also investigated if
there were clusters encoding lipid synthesis via the
polyketide or isoprenoid pathways. No gene products
were located in the K. stuttgartiensis (or the D. psychrophila)
genome that resembled polyketide synthases known to
synthesise PUFA in marine organisms [45] or any other
type of polyketide synthase-like enzymes. In K. stuttgartiensis, gene sequences encoding enzymes for isoprenoid synthesis were found for the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
4-phosphate (MEP or non-mevalonate) pathway and for
the production of terpenoid lipids.
Lipid analysis
The striking synteny of gene products encoding fatty acid
biosynthesis in K. stuttgartiensis and D. psychrophila
prompted us to investigate the lipid composition of D.
psychrophila. Core lipid fractions of D. psychrophila were
analysed for ladderane lipids using GC/MS and HPLCMS/MS. Ladderane lipids were not identified in the D. psychrophila biomass. However, unusual polyunsaturated
hydrocarbons (PUHC) C31:8 and C31:9, with molecular
masses of 418 and 420 respectively, were identified using
GC/MS with electron impact and chemical ionization.
The PUHCs formed 5% of the total lipid fraction (Table
3). The naturally occurring 13C/12C isotope ratios of individual lipids have previously been used to discriminate

via the same pathway, perhaps an altered version of the
FASII synthesis. The wide range of depletions of saturated
and unsaturated fatty acids (up to 20.5‰) indicates that

they are synthesised from different precursors (i.e. different sources of acetyl CoA or a different monomer altogether), as no mechanism exists for the isotopic
fractionation of double bonded carbons [47]. This experimental evidence indicates that monounsaturated fatty
acids could be the precursors of the PUHCs in this organism, thereby supporting the conclusion from the in silico
analysis that PUHCs could be synthesised in a novel
anaerobic desaturase modification of the FASII pathway.

Discussion
Ladderane lipids are a curiosity of biological chemistry. As
far as we know they are biosynthesised only by anaerobic
ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria and their biosynthesis proceeds via an unknown biochemical pathway.
Anammox bacteria are not available in pure culture and
no genetic system is conceivable in the near future. Furthermore, the bacteria grow very slowly and experimental
approaches are limited by a low supply of anammox cells.
In the present study, ladderane biosynthesis was
addressed via comparative analysis of metagenomic data
of the anammox bacterium K. stuttgartiensis and stable isotope analysis.
Pathways for ladderane biosynthesis were previously proposed on theoretical grounds, involving ring closure of a
C20 polyunsaturated fatty acid at C9 and C20 (C12 macrocycle formation) and subsequent carbon-carbon bonding
[13] that could proceed via cascade type polycyclization,
with a substrate like the allenic C20 fatty acid
9,10,12,16,18,19-docosahexaenoic acid [14]. Nouri and
Tantillo have suggested a six-step polycyclization mechanism that could lead to ladderane formation [48].
From a genomic perspective, it was noted previously that
the operons for fatty acid biosynthesis in the anammox
bacterium K. stuttgartiensis were larger than found in other
bacteria and encoded a number of SAM radical enzymes.
These SAM radical enzymes might provide extra functionality to the bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and
enable the biosynthesis of ladderane lipids. This possibility was explored in more detail in the present study, and
its feasibility was compared to the alternative option, that
the ladderane moieties of the lipids are derived from other
biological intermediates by enzymes encoded in a separate, so far undiscovered gene cluster(s).
Comparative genomic analysis of the synteny of the K.
stuttgartiensis FASII gene clusters led to the detection of
very similar gene clusters in the unrelated, obligately
anaerobic, cold adapted deltaproteobacterium D. psychrophila. This discovery was unexpected; if ladderane lipids were unique to anammox bacteria, we would not
expect gene clusters for the biosynthesis of ladderane lipids in other bacteria. No ladderanes were detected experi-

mentally in lipid extracts from cells of D. psychrophila,
indicating that at least under the cultivation conditions
applied, D. psychrophila did not produce ladderane lipids.
However, D. psychrophila did produce unusual C31:8 and
C31:9 hydrocarbons that have been previously identified in
other psychrophillic bacteria and members of the Planctomycetes [19,20,49]. Non-isoprenoidal hydrocarbons are
thought to be produced via decarboxylation of (e.g. C32)
fatty acids [50]. The genome of D. psychrophila (and K.
stuttgartiensis) did not encode other known pathways for
PUFA biosynthesis, e.g. via polyketide synthesis.
The production of PUHC by D. psychrophila, the absence
of known pathways of PUHC/PUFA biosynthesis in the D.
psychrophila genome, the proposed role of PUHC as a precursor for ladderane biosynthesis in K. stuttgartiensis and
the synteny between the FASII gene clusters, prompted us
to re-analyse the extended gene clusters shared by these
organisms. We found that it is possible that these clusters
encoded a novel extension of FASII for the production of
PUFAs.
To produce PUFAs from saturated fatty acids, double
bonds have to be inserted by oxidative enzymes. There are
oxidative enzymes encoded in the FASII gene clusters of K.
stuttgartiensis and D. psychrophila that might perform the
insertion of double bonds into a (growing) lipid chain. In
K. stuttgartiensis there are two (Kuste3336, Kuste3607)
and in D. psychrophila there are three (DP1860, DP2405,
DP2406) open reading frames that encode for flavin containing amine-oxidoreductases (pfam01593, NCBI), similar in architecture to phytoene dehydrogenases. Phytoene
dehydrogenases introduce double bonds into isoprenoid
chains. However, it should be noted that isoprenoids are
constructed from IPP units, already containing double
bonds and that it is a more difficult task to introduce the
first double bond into a saturated lipid. Therefore, it is
probable that the phytoene dehydrogenase-like enzymes,
encoded by K. stuttgartiensis and D. psychrophila, introduce
subsequent double bonds into already unsaturated fatty
acids. Another class of oxidative enzymes, the SAM radical
enzymes are however more powerful, at the expense of
adenosyl methionine they can perform a wide variety of
reactions [26]. These enzymes could be involved in polyunsaturated lipid pre-or post-processing.
Pairwise comparison between the unusual gene products
in K. stuttgartiensis and D. psychrophila (Figure 4b) indicates that many of the unusual D. psychrophila open reading frames are homologous to those in K. stuttgartiensis
and therefore could drive a similar pathway. Remaining
synteny between the K. stuttgartiensis and D. psychrophila
FASII gene clusters could be related to the post-processing
of the FASII products. The acyl-CoA ligase-like gene
sequences encoded in both organisms (annotated as phe-

(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:8

nylacetyl-CoA ligase in K. stuttgartiensis and F390 synthetase in D. psychrophila) could perform the reaction for
the first step of glycerol attachment and the unknown
membrane protein (containing a putative lipid transport
domain) may be involved in the transport and insertion
of lipids into membranes, as hypothesised with similar
Mmp gene sequences found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
[51].
The similar isotopic signatures of D. psychrophila PUHC
and monounsaturated fatty acids were consistent with the
former being derived from the latter, with help of the gene
products of the shared FASII gene clusters analysed above.
However, no PUHC/PUFA could be detected in lipid
extracts of K. stuttgartiensis. This experimental observation
brings us to the essential, still remaining question: are
PUHC/PUFA an intermediate of ladderane biosynthesis
as previously proposed, or is PUHC/PUFA an independent product of the extended FASII pathway in K. stuttgartiensis? The failure to detect PUHC/PUFA is compatible
with both scenarios. In the former scenario, PUHC/PUFA
are intermediates (not end-products) of metabolism and
could remain undetected. In the latter scenario, the cells
may not have expressed PUHC/PUFA biosynthesis,
because they were grown at 30°C and PUFA are typically
produced in response to membrane adaptation to colder
temperatures. The issue was further explored by detailed
analysis of the encoded FASII gene products. If the first
scenario would be true, the analysed gene clusters would
encode the complete biosynthetic pathway for ladderanes. After all, the final cyclisation or cascade reaction necessary to produce ladderanes from PUFA could be
performed by a single enzyme (Figure 6, pathway a). In
the second scenario, we have to conclude that most of the
biosynthetic potential of the gene clusters is dedicated to
PUFA/PUHC biosynthesis and that ladderane biosynthesis in fact resides elsewhere on the genome. In this case,
complete or partially completed ladderane moieties
would have to be recruited into FASII (Figure 6, pathway
b). In support of the cyclisation or radical cascading of
PUFA into ladderanes scenario, our analyses showed that
apart from the extensive synteny with some Deltaproteobacteria, the K. stuttgartiensis gene clusters also contained
two genes with very limited sequence identity to genes
found in other organisms. The following genes have the
theoretical potential to be involved in cyclisations or oxidative cascades: Kuste2803 (a SAM radical enzyme with
an additional B12 binding domain) and perhaps
Kuste3347 (a SAM methyl transferase).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/8

in two divergent fabF paralogues of K. stuttgartiensis are
quite rare (Table 2). In the reaction cycle of FabF, Cys163
first accepts the growing lipid chain from acp. Next, a second acp presents a malonyl group to the active site.
His298 and His333 facilitate the decarboxylation of this
malonyl group and so produce the acyl-carbanion necessary for the final step, the elongation of the growing chain
with the acyl group. Mutagenesis studies have shown that
the substitution of Cys163 to Ser163 (as in Kuste3348, the
most divergent paralogue of FabF) still produces a functional phenotype but that the cystine at this position is
important for the specificity of FabF for an acp-bound
lipid chain [52]. His298 and His333 were both found to
be indispensible for the decarboxylation of the malonylCoA. Interestingly, these two residues were completely
substituted in all two previously mentioned paralogues of
FabF. Therefore in conclusion, the active sites of these two
enzymes are not compatible with the normal FabF chain
elongation function. If they are functional and if their
presence in the FASII gene clusters is not coincidental,
these enzymes may recruit non-FASII products (for example, a ladderane moiety) into the FASII pathway. The analysis of alternative pathways for ladderane moieties
(polyketide and isoprenoid biosynthesis) provided no
additional clues on how these moieties may be synthesised.

Conclusion
The present study has explored two propositions about
biological ladderane biosynthesis: (1) Ladderane lipids
are produced using polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as
precursors; (2) The extended lipid biosynthesis gene clusters detected in the anammox bacterium K. stuttgartiensis
encode a pathway for ladderane biosynthesis. Comparative genomics combined with experimental evidence has
shown that the gene clusters of K. stuttgartiensis may
encode a novel anaerobic pathway for PUFA biosynthesis
that is also present in the unrelated organism D. psychrophila. The presence of an unusual SAM radical/B12
enzyme and SAM methyl transferase in K. stuttgartiensis is
consistent with the idea that the oxidative cyclisation or
radical cascading of PUHC or PUFA could produce ladderane lipids. However, the presence of multiple paralogues
with radically different active site topology make it possible that ladderane moieties are synthesised via a presently
unknown pathway and are recruited into fatty acid biosynthesis. Our study provides testable hypotheses for
future experimental investigation.

Two hypothetical biosynthetic pathways for the formation of a C20 [5]-ladderane fatty acid. Locus in K. stuttgartiensis (and D. psychrophila) identified as potentially responsible for catalysing steps in the pathway have been indicated. (a) the precursor PUFA molecule is synthesised from a C20:0 fatty acid using a desaturase to insert double bonds. The PUFA is then folded
into a ladderane using a radical cascade mechanism, analogous to a previously proposed polycyclisation mechanism [48]. (b)
Alternatively, the ladderane moiety could be synthesised via an as yet unknown pathway and brought into FASII via an unusual
paralogue of FabF, attached to an acyl chain and released from FASII. The post-processing step is thought to be the same, irrespective of the pathway the ladderanes are synthesised. The last step shows the ester linkage of the ladderane fatty acyl group
to L-glycrol 3-phosphate, during the synthesis of ladderane glycerophospholipids.

Reviewers' comments
Dr M. Galperin
Review of the manuscript by Rattray et al. "A comparative
genomics study of genetic products potentially encoding
ladderane lipid biosynthesis" submitted for publication
in Biology Direct.

The paper by Rattray et al. addresses a very interesting
aspect of lipid metabolism in the anammox bacterium
Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, namely, the mechanism of formation of cyclobutane rings at the ends of the fatty acid residues of its phospholipids. Lipids with several linearly
fused cyclobutane moieties have been shown to constitute
a significant fraction of membrane phospholipids in K.
stuttgartiensis, indicating the presence of a dedicated biosynthetic pathway catalyzing the formation of these unusual structures. This pathway can be expected to involve
some novel biochemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes
that remain to be characterized. In their earlier paper (ref.
25), the authors identified four operons encoding fatty
acid biosynthesis in K. stuttgartiensis and analyzed the
likely functions of the encoded proteins. They noted that
the Kuste3352-Kuste3335 operon encodes two predicted
S-adenosylmethionine radical enzymes and two SAMdependent methyltransferases and suggested involvement
of these enzymes in the ladderane lipid biosynthetic pathway.
In the current contribution, the authors have undertaken
the first steps to verify this proposal. Using genome comparisons, they found a somewhat similar gene cluster in
the genome of cultivable deltaproteobacterium Desulfotalea psychrophila and analyzed the lipid content of its
membrane. They detected the presence in D. psychrophila
of unusual polyunsaturated hydrocarbons, but not ladderanes. This observation suggested that gene products that
are common for both organisms (including predicted radical SAM enzymes Kuste3343/DP1855 and Kuste3342/
DP1853) are involved in synthesis of these polyunsaturated hydrocarbons, which could serve as precursors for
ladderane formation.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/8

I have mixed feelings about this manuscript. My major
concern is that, while mechanisms of ladderane biosynthesis are indeed extremely intriguing, this manuscript
provides only a minor contribution to the understanding
of these mechanisms. Several specific comments are as
follows.
1. The idea that SAM-related enzymes Kuste3347,
Kuste3343, Kuste3342, and Kuste3338 are involved in
ladderane biosynthesis has been published more than
two years ago. The current paper would have looked far
more convincing if there was an effort to characterize
these enzymes experimentally by over expressing them in
a suitable host and analyzing their properties in vitro. At
the very least, this could have been done with their
homologs from D. psychrophila.
Authors' response
We completely agree and would very much like to perform these types of experiments. However, the previous
hypothesis "that they are involved in ladderane biosynthesis" provides little direction for future experiments.
The present manuscript provides the clear hypotheses and
directions needed for experimental testing. We believe
that hypothesis generation is a significant aspect of biological research in the post-genomic era.

2. This paper reports the discovery in D. psychrophila of
polyunsaturated hydrocarbons, but not ladderanes, but
does not specify whether these polyunsaturated hydrocarbons contain macrocycles. If these polyunsaturated
hydrocarbons are not cyclic, the presence in D. psychrophila of close homologs of Kuste3343 and Kuste3342
(DP1855 and DP1853, respectively) would strongly suggest that these enzymes are not involved in ring closure,
and would therefore undermine the authors' key idea on
the mechanism of ladderane formation. If these polyunsaturated hydrocarbons are indeed cyclic, there still
remains the problem of finding suitable candidates to catalyze the carbon-carbon bonding that creates the cyclobutane rings.
Authors' response
The retention time and mass spectra clearly showed that
the compounds in D. psychrophila were acyclic fatty acids
with multiple double bonds. Fatty acids with large ring
structures would have quite different mass spectra (e.g.
contain an M-29) and retention time. We have amended
the suggestion for the function of the similar radical
enzymes in both organisms to playing a role in the pre- or
post-synthesis of the polyunsaturated molecule. Possible
candidates to catalyse cyclisations or oxidative cascades
are Kuste2803 (a SAM radical enzyme with an additional
B12 binding domain) and perhaps Kuste3347 (a SAMmethyl transferase).

3. A significant part of the manuscript is devoted to the
phylogenetic analysis of the 7 paralogous members of the
FabB/FabF family. The purpose of this analysis was not
clear to me. How were the results expected to contribute
to the ultimate goal of this work? There seems to be little
doubt that all members of the FabB/FabF family are betaketoacyl synthases that participate in chain elongation.
Further, what was the expected result from the analysis of
the FabB/FabF active site residues? How does the finding
that that "Kuste3348 is unique to K. stuttgartiensis" (apparently the main result of this analysis) help in understanding the mechanisms of ladderane formation?
Authors' response
In the new version of the manuscript this is illustrated in
Figure 6. Our manuscript addresses two hypothetical
pathways for ladderane biosynthesis. One of these
depends on desaturation and ring closure, the other on
the recruitment of a complete ladderane building block
into FASII. The analysis of the FabBF paralogues addresses
the latter possibility.
Dr A. Osterman
In the study of Rattray et al., a comparative genomic
approach was used to address an exciting (and still
unsolved) mystery of ladderane biosynthesis in Kuenenia
stuttgartiensis, a bacterium with environmentally and
industrially important capability to anaerobically oxidize
ammonia. By applying comparative genomic techniques,
metabolic reconstruction, analysis of conserved chromosomal clusters, phylogenetic profiles and amino acid substitutions in paralogous enzymes, the authors identified
candidate genes that may be responsible for the yet
unknown biochemical transformations generating these
fascinating polycyclical compounds. A compelling, albeit
indirect, evidence is presented that ladderane formation
may proceed via polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intermediates that undergo cascade cyclization by a SAM radical mechanism. This hypothesis, if proven correct, would
indicate the existence of a novel variant of PUFA biosynthesis pathway, distinct from those previously described
(eg in Shewanella spp). A conservation in the organization
of extensive chromosomal clusters containing homologs
of FAS-related genes between K. stuttgartiensis and a phylogenetically distant Desulfotalea psychrophila allowed the
authors to hypothesize their involvement in related biosynthetic processes. Interestingly, the experimental analysis revealed the presence of PUFA but not ladderanes in
the lipid composition of Desulfotalea psychrophila. A possible (although not the only one) interpretation of this
finding is that both species share a PUFA synthesis pathway, whereas K. stuttgartiensis may have additional
enzyme(s) converting PUFA intermediates to ladderanes.
Candidate genes for such enzyme(s) were identified
within the same chromosomal cluster. Although this

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/8

study, taken alone, does not allow us to unambiguously
discriminate between the two previously proposed models of ladderane biosynthesis, it sets the stage for the further direct assessment of its tentatively identified
components.
Dr J. Selengut
Prior to this work it had been established that 1) certain
anammox bacteria biosynthesize ladderane lipids, 2) the
genome of K. stuttgartensis contains larger fatty acid biosynthesis operons than is typical and 3) that these large
operons contain SAM radical enyzmes. These observations are consistent with existing theories of ladderane
genesis calling for the intermediacy of polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFA).

The current work adds the following observations:
1) That K. stuttgartiensis contains the full complement of
fatty acid biosynthesis genes, but additionally contains a
number of homologs of the canonical FabB/F gene.
2) That these 'extra' homologs form a loose group of atypical FabB/F's with other sequences from R. baltica, a nonanammox planctomycete, and a number of deltaproteobacteria.
3) That some of these homologs from the two planctomycetes (and one of the deltas) do not contain many of
the canonical conserved active site residues, strongly
implicating a distinct function.
4) That two of the operons of K. stuttgartiensis containing
these distinctive FabB/F homologs contains genes which
are syntenic with similar operons in the deltaproteobacterium Desulfotalea psychrophila. The genes which are similar include the SAM radical enzymes and members of the
amine oxidase family related to phytoene desaturases,
both of which are reasonable to consider as possible
actors in a fatty acid desaturation pathway.
5) That an alternative (known) pathways for PUFA biosynthesis via polyketides was absent from both K. stuttgartiensis and D. psychrophila.
6) That, although ladderane production could not be
established in D. psychrophila, polyunsaturated hydrocarbons (PUHC) could be observed prominantly in that
organism, and that natural isotope patterns of these
PUHC's are consistent with their derivation from FA's.
The authors do not make any substantial conclusions
based on these observations, and indeed, I concur that
none are warranted. The connection between these operons in K. stuttgartiensis and the production of ladderane

Page 14 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

lipids is based on reasonable hypotheses, the absence of
obviously better candidates and circumstantial evidence.
Until such time as one can isolate and manipulate a ladderane-producing bacterium or produce and study the
gene products thereof, this must be the case.
The possibility exists and must be respected that the
observed operons have a purpose other than the production of ladderanes or their precursors. The chain of inference that goes from ladderane production in K.
stuttgartiensis to non-standard fatty acid biosynthesis operons in K. stuttgartiensis to syntenic operons in D. psychrophila. to PUHC production in D. psychrophila is
sufficiently weak at each step that little confidence is
gained that the proposed mechanism of ladderane biosynthesis is correct. This uncertainty is properly noted by
the tone of the final paragraphs of this manuscript.
Nevertheless, considering the difficulties involved in
obtaining anammox bacteria in a form conducive to laboratory studies, the current work points to a number of
interesting candidate proteins for study by expression and
isolation from heterologous hosts.
