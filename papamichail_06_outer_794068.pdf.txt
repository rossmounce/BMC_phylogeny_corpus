Abstract
Introduction: Three major outer membrane protein genes of Escherichia coli, ompF, ompC, and
ompA respond to stress factors. Transcripts from these genes are regulated by the small non-coding
RNAs micF, micC, and micA, respectively. Here we examine Photorhabdus luminescens, an organism
that has a different habitat from E. coli for outer membrane protein genes and their regulatory RNA
genes.
Results: By bioinformatics analysis of conserved genetic loci, mRNA 5'UTR sequences, RNA
secondary structure motifs, upstream promoter regions and protein sequence homologies, an
ompF -like porin gene in P. luminescens as well as a duplication of this gene have been predicted.
Gene loci for micF RNA, as well as OmpC protein and its associated regulatory micC RNA, were
not found. Significantly, a sequence bearing the appropriate signatures of the E. coli micA RNA was
located. The ompA homolog was previously annotated in P. luminescens.
Conclusion: Presence of an ompF-like porin in P. luminescens is in keeping with the necessity to
allow for passage of small molecules into the cell. The apparent lack of ompC, micC and micF suggests
that these genes are not essential to P. luminescens and ompC and micF in particular may have been
lost when the organism entered its defined life cycle and partially protected habitat. Control of
porin gene expression by RNA may be more prevalent in free- living cells where survival is
dependent on the ability to make rapid adjustments in response to environmental stress. Regulation
of ompA by micA may have been retained due to a necessity for ompA control during one or both
stages of the P. luminescens life cycle.

process are crucial to cell survival when nutrients are
scarce or when the cell is exposure to toxins or other
adverse conditions. In E. coli and related gamma-proteobacteria, the major outer membrane porin proteins are
OmpF and OmpC [1]. ompF and ompC genes are regulated
transcriptionally by transcription factor OmpR in
response to osmolarity change in the environment [2].
ompF is also regulated post-transcriptionally at the level of
messenger RNA stability by the trans-encoded antisense
RNA micF in response to various environmental factors
such as temperature increase, oxidative stress and exposure to toxic compounds [3]. Regulatory non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs) in prokaryotes are also referred to as
trans-encoded antisense RNAs. ompC in E. coli is regulated
post-transcriptionally by the regulatory ncRNA micC [4].
OmpA, another major outer membrane protein, has multiple and more complex functions [5] For example, OmpA
adds to the stability of the cell envelope by linking the
outer membrane to the peptidoglycan. It is involved in
bacterial conjugation [6] and functions as a porin protein
as well [7]. The stability of ompA mRNA varies with bacterial growth rate [8] and ompA mRNA is degraded at a fast
rate when cells enter stationary phase [9]. Udekwu et al
[10] recently showed that the regulatory micA RNA posttranscriptionally regulates ompA mRNA. In addition, micA
is induced at stationary phase, a stress condition [10].
Thus in E. coli, three major outer membrane proteins,
OmpF, OmpC, and OmpA are all regulated by specific
small RNAs in response to stress factors.
Photorhabdus luminescens is phylogenetically a member of
the gamma- proteobacteria based on analyses of 50
gamma proteobacterial 16S rRNA genes [11]. In a phylogenetic tree based on the sctV gene (which encodes a
highly conserved inner membrane protein), P. luminescens
falls into the Yersinia family [12].
P. luminescens has a complex life cycle and proliferates in
two distinctly different environments [13,14]. P. luminescens lives symbiotically in the nematode gut, but also has
a pathogenic phase when the worm, which normally
resides in the soil, infects an insect. In this stage, P. luminescens cells are released into the circulatory system
(hemocoel) of the insect by the nematode. Here the bacteria grow and commence with the rapid killing of the
insect and both the nematode and the bacteria feed from
the dead insect [13,14]. After nutrients derived from the
insect carcass are depleted, the bacteria re-associate with
the nematode and the symbiotic relationship is re-established. P. luminescens has not been found as a free living
organism and thus differs significantly from E. coli and
most other closely related gamma-proteobacteria.

expanded such that it has one of the largest chromosomes
of the gamma-proteobacteria (~5.7 Mb) [15]. This expansion is related to its pathogenic phase [13-15]. However
certain genetic elements that contribute towards survival
in a harsh environment but are no longer needed may
have been lost from the genome during evolution of the
organism.
Using a bioinformatics approach, the P. luminescens
genome was analyzed for outer membrane porin protein
and associated regulatory RNA genes. We find a limited
presence of the porin genes and their RNA regulators.

Results
Analyses of Photorhabdus omp-like genes
Gene arrangements: ompF locus
Analysis of nearest neighbor genes in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria reveals a conserved gene arrangement surrounding the porin protein gene ompF in species
closely related to E. coli (Figure 1). OmpF is flanked on one
side by aspC, the aspartate aminotransferase gene and by
asnS, the asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase gene on the other
side. In addition, pncB (nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase) and pepN (aminopeptidase N) are situated to the
right of the ompF gene locus in the schematic shown. Similar gene arrangements for the ompF locus are also in more
distantly related organisms, e.g., Buchnera aphidicola str.
Sg. The loci in Yersinia species (not shown) have the same
gene arrangements, but ompF is referred to as a general
porin gene, e.g., see yptb1435, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP
32953, complete genome annotation, [17]. However an
ompF ortholog has been located in this locus in Yersinia
species [18]. Xenorhabdus nematophilia, which has an ompF
-like porin gene (opmP), displays the similar nearest
neighbor gene arrangement as that in E. coli [19]. X.
nematophilia has a similar life cycle as that of P. luminescens.

In P. luminescens, an identical nearest neighbor arrangement is present around the gene annotated as ompN (Figure 1). ompN is flanked by aspC and asnS with pncB and
pepN situated adjacent to asnS as is found in E. coli and the
other species shown. However, Photorhabdus also has a
hypothetical protein gene (plu1752) situated between
ompN and asnS (Figure 1). Thus the gene annotated as
ompN in P. luminescens has the enterobacterial ompF chromosomal locus signature with the exception of an inserted
protein gene. Analysis of nearest neighbor genes and their
conservation in related enterobacterial species has been
reported before, e.g., for non- coding RNA genes [20]. In
addition Notebaart et al [21] have presented a detail analysis of nearest neighbor genes, protein amino acid
sequence and gene function predictions.

During the evolutionary period when P. luminescens
evolved into a symbiont and a pathogen, its genome

* Sequence identities of P. luminescens OmpN with other Omps from
the NCBI Protein-protein BLAST (blastp) program

Characteristics of P. luminescens ompN
a. Amino acid sequence identities
A comparison of amino acid sequence identities of the P.
luminescens OmpN with representative gamma-proteobacteria outer membrane proteins is shown in Table 1.
The highest identity is with OpmP, the OmpF-like porin
in X. nematophilia. However identities with other porin
proteins in other bacteria are also high and a clear segregation of OmpF protein sequences is not apparent (Table
1). Due to evolutionary relatedness between many outer
membrane proteins, there is high sequence identity
between these proteins, but they are not necessarily
orthologs of each other and identities between porin protein amino acid sequences is of limited use in gene annotation [18].

ompN is not uniformly found in the gamma-proteobacteria. For example, there is no annotation for the ompN gene

in Yersinia pestis and a protein blast search using the E. coli
OmpN protein sequence does not yield an orthologous
protein in the Y. pestis genomic sequence. Additional characteristics of ompN in other species are discussed below.
b. mRNA 5' UTR sequences and secondary structures
mRNA 5' UTR sequences can be important markers in
identifying protein coding genes [18]. In the study here, a
comparative sequence analysis of 5' UTRs and a comparison of mRNA 5' UTR secondary structures were performed. All parameters investigated suggest that ompN is
the P. luminescens homolog of ompF.

The P. luminescens ompN mRNA 5' UTR was deduced from
alignment of sequences upstream of the ATG coding start
site with 5'UTR sequences of Yersinia species (Figure 2). A
comparison with Yersinia sequences is pertinent since
Yersinia and Photorhabdus species are closely related evolutionarily [11,12]. The P. luminescens ompN mRNA 5' UTR
has a very high nucleotide sequence identity to the ompF
mRNA 5'UTR of Yersinia pestis (89.5%). Interestingly,
there is 100% sequence conservation at the 3' half of the
5'UTR from positions 61 â 111 (Figure 2). The Photorhabdus ompN 5' UTR also displays a high sequence identity
with other gamma-proteobacteria ompF 5' UTRs (data not
shown).
The putative P. luminescens ompN mRNA 5'UTR also
shares signatures of the generalized ompF 5' UTR secondary structure. These signatures are highly specific to ompF
mRNAs and consist of a long stem loop which starts at
~5â10 nt from the 5' end of the 5' UTR [23-25] (Figure 3).
The stem contains several bulged and looped out posi-

Y. enterocolitica sequence can be accessed in the Y. enterocolitica Blast Server [22]. Sequences were aligned with the DNASTAR,
Inc program using ClustalW alignment.

crucial positions suggests that the P. luminescens sites function in OmpR binding. A GNNNC motif found in OmpR
binding elements [32] is present in the P. luminescens
sequence, G11AAAC15, albeit there is only one copy which
is in the F1 site (Figure 4b).

tions. In addition, there is also a small stem loop close to
the 3' end that encompasses the Shine- Dalgarno (S-D)
ribosome binding site (e.g., GAGG in E. coli and Y . pestis).
The Photorhabdus ompN mRNA 5' UTR closely conforms to
the gamma-proteobacteria ompF mRNA 5' UTR secondary
structure motif. Figure 3 shows a comparison with the Y.
pestis ompF mRNA 5' UTR secondary structure. There are
minor differences in the upper portion of the large stem
loop, however base pairing differences are characteristic of
ompF mRNA 5' UTR structures [24]. Secondary structures
of E. coli ompC, ompN and other outer membrane protein
mRNA 5' UTRs do not display the ompF 5' UTR signatures.
c. Upstream regulatory sequences
Another important signature of ompF is the conservation
and specificity of its upstream regulatory sequences.
OmpR, a transcription factor found in E. coli and related
organisms, is part of the two-component signal transduction regulatory locus ompB [27,2,28]. OmpR transcriptionally regulates expression of ompF and ompC genes in
response to osmolarity change in E. coli and related species. Four OmpR binding sites F1â4 are located upstream
of ompF in E. coli [29,30] (Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows an
alignment of OmpR binding sites F1, F2, and F3 upstream
of ompF from several species, including the proposed site
upstream of P. luminescens ompN. F 1â3 sites in P. luminescens were deduced by the alignment of sequences
upstream of the ATG translational start site of ompN and
of ompF from the four enteric bacteria shown. The E. coli
sites as described by Bergstrom et al [29] were used as a
base line. These sites are involved in transcriptional activation in E. coli. There is a comparable sequence identity
between Photorhabdus and the three enterobacteria ompF
upstream sites F1â3 (Table 2). In addition, most nucleotide positions crucial for OmpR binding in E. coli [31,32]
are conserved in P. luminescens sites, e.g., A4 C5 and A14C15
in F1, A34, C35 in F2, and C53 in F3. Conservation of these

The F4 site differs from F1â3 in that it is involved in
repression and not activation of ompF expression [29]. An
hypothetical F4 site was also located upstream of ompN in
Photorhabdus based on alignment of sequences with the nt
positions and sequence described for the E. coli F4 [29]
(Figure 5). However, F4 sequences have diverged and are
more complex than sites F1â3, e.g., Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica species reveal low identity with the other gammaproteobacteria (e.g., 28.6% and 33.3% identity respectively, compared with the E. coli F4 site) (Table 3).
Although this is close to random identity, the Yersinia species have a GNNNC motif. The identity between Photorhabdus and the E. coli F4 sites is much higher, 52.4%,
however the putative P. luminescens F4 lacks the GNNNC
motif (Figure 5). Thus, it is unlikely that this sequence
functions as a repressor of the proposed P. luminescens
ompF.
d. OmpF loop 3
Structurally, OmpF consists of trans-membrane beta
strands and eight loops. Loop 3 (L-3) of OmpF is critical
in formation of the channel pore and conductance and
thus is a major functional determinant of the porin protein [33,34]. The amino acid sequence of L-3 of the proposed P. luminescens OmpF-like porin was aligned with L3 sequences from related bacteria (Figure S1, ,Supplement, Additional file 1). The Photorhabdus sequence displays a high identity to the L-3 loop sequences of X.
nematophilia OpmP (88% identity) and the Yersinia OmpF
L-3 (82%) (Table S1, Supplement, Additional file 1). The
sequence identity to the E. coli OmpN L-3 is 68%. Interestingly, there are substantial differences between the other
gamma- proteobacterial OmpF L-3, especially between E.
coli and Salmonella (49% Identity) (Table S1, Supplement,
Additional file 1). This suggests a complex selection pressure in amino acid sequence in related gamma enterobacteria and possible structure-function differences of this
critical loop. An L-3 phylogenetic tree is in Figure S2, Supplement, Additional file 1).

In summary, a) high identity with ompF mRNA 5' UTR
sequences, b) shared mRNA 5' UTR secondary structure
motifs, c) similarities between neighbor genes in the P.
luminescens ompN locus and genes of the gamma-proteobacteria ompF locus, d) high sequence identities in
upstream transcriptional regulatory sites F1â3, and e)
identity of OmpF loop L-3 amino acid sequences all suggest that the annotated ompN gene is an ompF-ortholog in
P. luminescens.

luminescens were deduced by the alignment of sequences upstream of the ATG translational start site of ompN and of ompF
from the four enteric bacteria shown. Binding sites are as follows: F1, positions 1â20; F2, positions 21â40; F3, positions 41â60.
Note: two nt positions between F2 and F3, which are not part of F1â3 binding sites (29) are not included in the figure.

plu1752
plu1752 is situated between ompN and asnS in the annotated P. luminescens genome (Figure 1). The coding nucleotide sequence of plu1752 shows no frameshift
mutations, no insertions, and one triplet deletion when
sequences are compared with the proposed P. luminescens
ompF (data not shown). Thus plu1752 encodes a nearly
full length protein compared with OmpF. plu1752 has a
59% amino acid sequence identity to the P. luminescens
OmpF-like porin and 59% identity to the X. nematophilia
OpmP. Its identity with E. coli and Yersinia pestis OmpC
proteins is 55% and 51% respectively, and 51% to
OmpS1, a porin protein gene (distinct from ompF and
ompC) in Salmonella typhi str. CT18. The amino acid
sequence identity of plu1752 is closest to OmpF-related
proteins but only slightly higher than to OmpC proteins.
On the other hand, the plu1752 deduced mRNA 5'UTR
sequence displays a high identity with that of the proposed ompF 5' UTR ompF 5' UTR (76.4%). Interestingly,
the plu1752 5'UTR sequence also has a 28 bp insertion in

the 3' region. However, the proposed plu1752 mRNA
5'UTR secondary structure closely resembles that of the P.
luminescens ompF 5' UTR (Figure 6) and the 28 base insertion between positions 92â93 of the ompF 5' UTR does
not appear to perturb the large stem loop, the primary
ompF 5' UTR structural motif. The plu1752 5'UTR maintains the four looped out/bulged positions present in
ompF 5' UTR major stem loop, albeit there are nucleotide
sequence changes in these regions. Importantly, there are
several base pair compensatory changes in stem
sequences, e.g., in the stem closest to the top loop there is
a change of the pairing U38-A47 (ompF, Figure 6b) to G40U48 (plu1752, Figure 6a). This is strong evidence for evolutionary relatedness. The plu1752 mRNA 5'UTR displays
poor sequence identity to the enteric ompC mRNA 5' UTRs
(e.g., 47% and 36% to Y. pestis and E. coli, respectively)
thus making it unlikely that it is an otholog of ompC.
However, there is an apparent absence of an ompC gene in
P. luminescens (see below).

Nucleotide sequence upstream of ompN in P. luminescens

sequences as described in Figure 4 caption.

Comparison of the plu1752 upstream region with regions
upstream of enterobacterial ompF genes reveals a close
similarity with OmpR binding sites F1â3 (Figure 7a).
Deduced F1â3 sequences of plu1752 show 70% identity
with F1â3 sites of the proposed P. luminescens ompF. In
addition, several base positions highly critical for OmpR
binding (as described for Figure 4b) are also conserved in
the plu1752 sites (Figure 7a) but also noted is the presence
of only one GNNNC motif (G50TATC55, in F3). The
upstream regulatory region of plu1752 is, however truncated, i.e., there are only 142 bp between plu1752 and its
upstream gene, asnS gene. Thus, plu1752 appears to have
no potential for an F4 binding site. The plu1752 -10 and 35 promoter sequences are nearly identical to those of
proposed P. luminescens ompF (Figure 7b).
Loop 3 of Plu1752 protein has a high amino sequence
identity with the proposed P. luminescens OmpF-like
porin (77%) (Table S1, Supplement, Additional file 1).
The identity with representative gamma proteobacterial
OmpF L-3 sequences is much less and ranges from 44%59%, with the exception of sequences of Xenorhabdus
(68%) and Yersinia (71%) (Table S1, Supplement, Additional file 1).
Judging by the strong similarities in signatures between
plu1752 and the proposed P. luminescens ompF, plu1752
may have arisen by a duplication of the ompF-like porin.
A phylogenetic tree of the P. luminescens proposed ompF
and ompF duplication 5' UTR sequences with representative omp 5' UTRs of other bacteria is shown in Figure 8.

A comparison of plu1752 characteristics with ompF is in
Table 4. In view of the large number of non- synonymous
mutations (changes in amino acids), i.e., 59% identity in
amino acid composition between P. luminescens ompF and
plu1752, the proposed duplication may have been an
ancient one. S. typhimurium and E. coli separated about
140 million years ago and the percent amino acid changes
between the plu1752 protein and the proposed P. luminescens OmpF are about the same as those between S. typhimurium and E. coli OmpF proteins (Table 4). However,
further phylogenetic analyses are needed to better understand the proposed duplication event.
Porin protein gene ompC and regulatory RNA genes
micF, micC and micA
a. ompC and micF
ompC, which codes for the smaller porin protein was not
detected in P. luminescens. For example, ompC nearest
neighbor genes such as ubiG, gyrA, rcsC, and rcsB are
grouped together in E. coli and Yersinia pestis and are also
conserved as a group in P. luminescens, but the Photorhabdus locus does not show an annotated ompC [15]. Blast
searches of the P. luminescens genome using the ompC coding sequence, the ompC mRNA 5' UTR sequence, and the
ompC amino acid sequence from E. coli and Y. pestis did
not yield sequences orthologous to ompC (data not
shown). In addition, various other E. coli porin protein
sequences were employed to search the P. luminescens
genome using the NCBI protein tblastn program, however
no other porin protein sequences were detected with the
exception of the proposed ompF and ompF duplication
plu1752.

In E. coli and related species, the micF gene is an independent transcriptional unit with its own promoter and it does
not overlap other genes [35]. However, micF and ompC are
in the same chromosomal locus and are linked by a regulatory region (253 bp in E. coli) that includes binding sites
for the transcription factor OmpR [2]. These serve as sites
for both micF and ompC transcriptional activation by
OmpR [36]. This linkage region is conserved in all enterobacteria known to contain a micF gene [18]. The region is
complex and has binding sites for eight transcription regulators of E. coli micF [3,18,37]; also, see [38,39]. In P.
luminescens, both the micF and ompC genes are missing

from the chromosomal locus where they normally are
found. micF may have been transposed to another region
of the chromosome, however blast searches with micF
gene sequences from E. coli and Yersinia species, as well as
with the conserved 253 nt regulatory region did not reveal
homologous sequences in the P. luminescens genome.
Strategies employed to further search the P. luminescens
genome for micF were based on conserved portions of the
micF sequence and phylogenetically conserved micF RNA/
ompF mRNA 5'UTR duplex structural motifs. In all organisms where micF RNA is found (more than 6 species),
there is a total conservation of the13 nt sequence at the 5'
end [18]. This sequence is 5'GCUAUCAUCAUUA3' and it

forms a major part of the base pairing between micF RNA
and ompF mRNA 5' UTR. A hypothetical P. luminescens
micF RNA would consist of the same sequence based on
the highly conserved portion of ompF mRNA 5'UTR (see
Figure 2), with the exception of C2 to U2 change (Figure 9).
Intergenic regions (i.e., non protein coding regions) of the
P. luminescens genome were scanned for sequences that
provides a structure similar to the RNA/RNA duplex structure found in enterobacterial species. Permutations in the
hypothetical P. luminescens 5' end micF sequence shown in
Figure 9 involved the use of four random substitutions in
this sequence (in addition to the two C to U variables
shown in Figure 9 left). Also, added structural constraints

for the total hypothetical micF RNA structure used consisted of a rho-independent termination motif at 35â85 nt
downstream from the 3' end of the 13 nt sequence. The P.
luminescens genome was scanned and sequences analyzed.
A match with forty- three positives was found for a putative micF RNA with the above mentioned constraints.
These positives were further analyzed for ability to form
an RNA/RNA duplex structure that is consistent with the
conserved generalized micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR
duplex structures of various enterobacterial sequences
[18]. Five positives were found, however four of these
have sequences in the 3' region of the hypothetical RNA
chain that partly overlap protein coding genes and thus
were discounted. The fifth sequence did not overlap a coding region and provided a similar interaction displayed by
the Yersinia RNA/RNA duplex (Figure S3a, S3b, Supplement, Additional file 1). However a) this structure did not
display the ompF 3' end/micF 5' end RNA/RNA duplex
motif consisting of "blunt ends" (Figure 9, right) [18], and
b) the percent identity of this fifth sequence with the Y.
pestis micF sequence is low, 35.2%. Therefore this "fifth
positive sequence" was also discounted as a micF candidate, albeit we cannot exclude that this may constitute an
RNA transcript from promoter search analyses (Supplement, Additional file 1). No other intergenic sequences
provided all the prerequisite RNA/RNA duplex signatures.
A third type of search was performed with a hypothetical
P. luminescens micF sequence that would form a perfect 14
bp complement to the ompF 5'UTR 3' region (see Methods
and Materials) and no positives were found in a search of
the P. luminescens genome.
Thus, a) no micF-conserved 5' end 13 nt sequence (nt
sequence in Figure 9, right), which has a rho -independent
termination motif at less than 85 nt downstream of the 13
nt sequence, matched in the intergenic regions of P. luminescens, b) no P. luminescens intergenic sequences provide
all the prerequisite signatures of the micF RNA/ompF

mRNA 5' UTR duplex. In addition, the P. luminescens chromosomal locus where one would expect to find micF is
partly rearranged and does not contain micF (or ompC).
If a putative P. luminescens micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR
duplex structure diverged significantly from the phylogenetically conserved structures used for comparison, a Photorhabdus micF sequence would have been missed. Since
the P. luminescens ompF mRNA 5'UTR has a secondary
structure that closely conforms to the generalized 5' UTR
structure and the 3' end of this UTR sequence that would
interact with a hypothetical micF RNA is, with the exception of one nt change, completely conserved, it is less
likely that a Photorhabdus RNA/RNA duplex structure
would exist that diverges significantly from the consensus.
The E. coli and Y. pestis intergenic regions of the chromosome were also scanned using the above parameters and
the respective micF sequences were detected in these controls.
micC
The regulatory micC RNA was isolated and characterized
in E. coli and homologous micC sequences were detected
in close relatives such as Klebsiella pneumonie, but not in
Yersinia species [4]. This RNA is 109 nt in chain length and
regulates ompC expression post-transcriptionally in
response to stress conditions [4]. Since the target ompC
gene does not appear to be present in P. luminescens, it
appears unlikely fhat P. luminescens would have micC.
However we considered the question of whether "fossil"
micC sequences may still be present. The P. luminescens
genome, including the genomes of Y. pestis and Y. psedutuberculosis (which were not previously shown to have
micC), were scanned for sequences that match E. coli micC.
Blast searches with the NCBI Discontinuous Blast Program and utilizing the E. coli micC sequence as the query
did not yield a match.

micC nearest neighbor genes were analyzed as well. In E.
coli K12, ydpK (pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase gene)
is situated 30 bp downstream from micC and ompN is 227
bp upstream of micC [4]. ydpK has not been annotated in
P. luminescens and a blast search of the P. luminescens
genome using the Y.pestis pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase amino acid sequence yielded only minor similarities to unrelated proteins. Thus we could not locate a
locus encompassing the micC nearest neighbor genes in
the P. luminescens genome.
Since Yersinia species have an ompC, theirgenomes were
further searched for a micC homolog by analyzing
sequences in a putative micC locus. ydpK is present in Y.

2662970-2663245) downstream of the end of 3' end of
nifJ and upstream of the start of YPT 2254 (hypothetical
protein) contains a probable rho- independent termination motif, however it did not yield significant sequence
identity when aligned with the E. coli micC sequence
(unpublished).
micA
Udekwu et [10] characterized a small regulatory RNA
termed micA that post- transcriptionally controls E. coli
OmpA synthesis. The micA sequence was also identified in
other enterobacteria, including Yesinia pestis [10] but not
in more distantly related organisms.

OmpA, the target of micA, has been annotated in the P.
luminescens genome at positions 2117794-2118900 [40].
The putative P. luminescens ompA mRNA 5' UTR sequence
was deduced from an alignment of sequences upstream of
the P. luminescens ompA ATG start with E.coli and Y. pestis
ompA mRNA 5' UTR sequences (Figure S4, Supplement,
Additional file 1). The 5' UTRs of the 3 species show a
divergence in sequence, particularly that of P. luminescens,
but the region encompassing ~30 nt at the 3' end of the
mRNA 5' UTR, the site that interacts with micA RNA in E.
coli [10], is highly conserved and shows an identity of
~80% between P. luminescens and E.coli and Y. pestis ompA
mRNA 5' UTR sequences.
The P. luminescens genome was searched for sequences
similar to micA. A blast search using the E. coli and Y. pestis
micA nucleotide sequences did not yield a match. In E. coli
and Y. pestis genomes, micA is found between luxS and
gshA [10]. To further search for the RNA gene, the nucleotide sequence between luxS and gshA in P. luminescens
was scanned for homology to micA sequences. This region
in P. luminescens was aligned with E. coli and Y. pestis micA
sequences and a putative micA homologous sequence was
identified (Figure 10). Position 52 shown in Figure 10 is
the 5' start of the micA gene and positions 1â51 encompass the upstream promoter region. micA sequence identities between the four organisms shown are in the range
of 58.8 â 61.8%. The 23 bp segment at the 5' end region
of the putative P. luminescens micA, that includes
sequences that would interact with the P. luminescens
ompA 5' UTR, shows a slightly higher identity of 65.2%
compared with both E. coli and Y. pestis micA 5' end
regions. In addition, the upstream -10 and -35 promoter
sequences are nearly identical between P. luminescens and
Y. pestis (Figure 10).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/12

The P. luminescens sequence displays the major signatures
of micA RNA, i.e., a rho-independent termination motif at
the 3' end and the potential of 5' end sequences to base
pair with region of the mRNA 5'UTR that covers the S-D
sequence. Secondary structure models of the putative P.
luminescens micA RNA together with E. coli and Y. pestis
micA RNA structural models are in Figure S5, Supplement,
Additional file 1. Figure 11 shows proposed micA RNA/
ompA mRNA 5' UTR duplex interaction for P. luminescens,
together with duplexes from related enterobacteria. All
duplex models were obtained by the mfold program [26].
Although there are variations in duplex structures, the P.
luminescens duplex shows close similarities to the other
structures, e.g., shielding of the mRNA S-D ribosome
binding site by the 5' end region of micA RNA, similarity
in the length of the RNA/RNA duplex interaction and a
similarity in 5' nucleotide position of micA RNA that participates in base pairing. Thus we propose that the
sequence at positions 1451569 â 1451500 of the P. luminescens genome represents the micA gene homolog in P.
luminescens.
By bioinformatics methods, Griffiths-Jones et al [42] and
Hershberg et al [20] predicted and cataloged the small
non-coding RNAs/RNA genes present in E. coli and related
organisms. Seventeen are regulatory RNAs in E. coli (Table
S2, Supplement, Additional file 1). Of the total small
RNAs reported for P. luminescens on the Rfam website [43]
(also D. Schones, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and N.
Delihas, unpublished data), five genes encode regulatory
RNAs (Tables S2 and S3, Supplement, Additional file 1).
The work reported here adds micA to this list. Twenty-five
E. coli ncRNAs are of undetermined function (Table S4,
Supplement, Additional file 1) and P. luminescens shares
four of these ncRNA genes.

Discussion
P. luminescens evolved to proliferate in specialized environments and this poses interesting questions in terms of
its gene composition. For free living bacteria, cell surface
components and associated regulatory mechanisms are
crucial to survival. The work here focuses on outer membrane porin protein genes and their regulatory RNA genes.
An ompF-type gene has been identified in P. luminescens as
well as a putative ompF duplication (ompF paralog). The
proposal for an ompF paralog is strongly supported by the
mRNA 5' UTR compensatory base-pair changes, which
maintain secondary structure signatures (Figure 6). The
ompF-like gene was originally annotated as ompN in the P.
luminescens genome, but there is no evidence for an ompN
in Photorhabdus, either in chromosomal location or in the
putative mRNA 5' UTR sequence. The homolog to ompC,
which encodes the smaller porin has not been detected.
No other porin protein genes, such as phoE [44] were

upstream sequence shown encompasses positions 1â51. In P. luminescens, the putative -10 promoter site is at positions 40â45
(GTCATA sequence) and the -35 is at 16â21 (ATGAAA sequence). The P. luminescens micA and upstream region sequences
shown in the figure are located at genomic positions 1451620-1451502.
found, but the specialized porin gene lamB, which
encodes the protein involved in transport of maltose and
maltodextrins across the cell envelope [45] has been
annotated in P. luminescens [15]. In addition, ompA, which
encodes a cell envelope protein that has multiple functions, was also previously annotated in P. luminescens.
OmpF is a generalized porin. It functions to allow for the
intake of small nutrients into the cell and therefore serves
an indispensable function. Therefore one would expect to
find an ompF-type gene in P. luminescens. ompF is found in
gamma subdivision enterobacteria whose genomes have
been sequenced, including the obligate symbionts such as
Buchnera and Wiggleswothia [46,47]. In E. coli, OmpF is
one of the most abundant proteins in the cell. But perhaps
each organism evolved its own porin properties such as
conductance and pore size based on needs to thrive in
specialized habitats and there may be nuances between E.
coli and related bacterial OmpF functions.
OmpC is also a generalized porin, but may function primarily under conditions of high osmolarity [2]. OmpC
may not be essential during either the symbiotic or pathogenic phases of P. luminescens. OmpA is a surface protein
essential for the structural integrity of the cell envelope
and as expected, is widely found in Gram-negative bacteria. The function of OmpN in E.coli is not known and it is
uncertain whether ompN is an essential gene in other species. OmpN is expressed at very low levels in E. coli strain
BL21 when grown in rich media [48], however levels in
cells grown in minimal media were not determined. Interestingly, strain E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 appears to have a

truncated ompN gene that codes for only123 amino acids
out of the 377 amino acid sequence found in E. coli K12.
Salmonella enterica (subsp. enterica serovar Typhi str. CT18)
lacks an ompN gene at the E. coli ompN chromosomal site
but has instead a transposase insertion sequence (unpublished). It appears that ompN is a pseudogene in E. coli
O157:H7 EDL933 and it may not be uniformly present in
species closely related to E. coli.
The proposed ompF duplication in P. luminescens
(plu1752) does not appear to be a pseudogene. It codes for
a nearly full length OmpF-type polypeptide, maintains a
porin structural motif [49] and has upstream nucleotide
sequences similar to three of the four OmpR binding sites
and sequences almost identical to the -10 and -35 promoter region of P. luminescens ompF. Assuming plu1752
arose from ompF, it appears that the coding sequence has
diverged from ompF, i.e., there is 59% amino acid
sequence identity between ompF duplication and ompF
coding regions.
Why is there a duplication of the ompF-type porin gene in
P. luminescens? This may be related to requirements for
small solute assimilation and a paralog of this porin may
offer an advantage for survival of this organism in its specialized ecological niches. There are some differences
between the P. luminescens putative ompF and plu1752
Loop 3 amino acid sequences but no apparent changes in
net charge. Amino acid sequence differences in L-3 can
affect pore properties [33,34]. The plu1752 putative
mRNA 5' UTR and upstream OmpR binding region also
have some changes. Therefore, it is possible plu1752 is reg-

more specialized function.

has been reported for the obligate symbiont Buchnera,
which grows only in the aphid host [53].

There is an apparent absence of a micF RNA gene homolog
in P. luminescens. This suggests that post-transcriptional
regulation of ompF expression is not essential for survival
of this organism. In E. coli, micF expression is increased
when the cell is under environmental stress conditions,
e.g., exposure to toxic compounds, high temperature, cationic peptide antibiotics, or oxidative stress [3]. The confined life cycle of P. luminescens, involving only
endosymbiotic and pathogenic phases, perhaps precludes
exposure to these stress conditions. Thus Photorhabdus
may have lost the micF gene when it evolved into an endosymbiont.

Conclusions and perspectives

OmpA mRNA is degraded faster when E. coli cells enter stationary phase compared with log phase [9] and micA RNA
appears to down-regulate ompA expression when cells
enter stationary phase [10]. P. luminescens appears to have
retained the micA gene. During the pathogenic phase, P.
luminescens will go into stationary phase when insect
nutrients are depleted [13]. Thus the proposed micA RNA
may serve a similar function in P. luminescens as it does in
E. coli. However, regulatory RNAs may not serve identical
functional roles in organisms with different habitats. For
example, Serratia marcescens micF responds to most but
not all environmental factors that affect micF in E. coli
[50].
Photorhabdus appears to have fewer E. coli regulatory
ncRNA genes than its close relatives (Table S2, Supplement, Additional file 1). Important is the absence of rygA
and rygB, two ncRNA genes that are proposed to regulate
multiple outer membrane proteins in response to environmental conditions [51]. However, further searches are
needed to definitively show absence of these genes in P.
luminescens. On the other hand, P. luminescens, because of
its complex life cycle, may have its own group of regulatory ncRNAs. For example, a small RNA has been hypothesized to regulate pathways leading to either symbiosis or
pathogenicity [52]. In the extreme case of the obligate
endosymbionts such as Buchnera and Wiggleswothia, only
the E. coli housekeeping RNA genes are reported and there
were no regulatory RNA genes found [42] (and D.
Schones and N. Delihas, unpublished). Control of gene
expression by RNA may be more prevalent in cells where
survival is dependent on the ability to make rapid adjustments in response to environmental stress. Bacterial regulatory ncRNA genes probably evolved to help the
organism survive under different environmental conditions and stress-related factors and these genes may not be
present in organisms that live in more protected environments. Parallel to this, loss of transcriptional regulators

Analysis of the P. luminescens genome described here and
by others shows essential outer membrane protein genes
ompF, ompA and a proposed duplication of ompF. The
post-transcriptional regulatory RNA gene micA appears to
also be present, but the ompF regulatory counterpart micF
is not evident. The presence or absence of certain ncRNA
genes in Photorhabdus appears consistent with the rationale for a need or lack of need. On the other hand, new
RNA genes may have evolved to help the organism thrive
in its environment. Further analyses of the P. luminescens
genome by bioinformatics and/or microarray analyses
may reveal regulatory ncRNA genes or gene transcripts
that may be unique to Photorhabdus and closely related
species that function in the pathogenic phase. Along with
the marked increase in virulence genes [13-15], genes that
encode both regulatory proteins and regulatory RNAs may
also have evolved and/or were acquired to increase the
pathogenicity of the organism.
Two pertinent projects are underway. The genomes of the
related symbiont and/or insect pathogens, Xenorhabdus
nematophilia [54] and Photorhabdus asymbiotica [55] are
currently being sequenced. When completed, these
sequences may add to and/or complement the assessment
of outer membrane porin genes and RNA regulatory genes
presented here. P. asymbiotica is of particular interest since
in some instances it is found to cause human opportunistic infections. This organism offers exciting opportunities
to further assess virulence factors and their regulation.

Methods and materials
To search for outer membrane protein and regulatory
RNA genes, the BLAST GenBank site of the National
Center for Biotechnology Information [56] was used.
Genome searches were with the BLAST with microbial
genomes page [57]), with the exception of the Yersinia
enterocolitica genome where the Welcome Trust Sanger
institute site [58] was employed. The Entrez cross-database search page [16] was used to find nearest neighbor
genes.
RNA secondary structure modeling was performed with
the Zuker and Turner Mfold, version 3.2 [59,26]. Standard
constraint parameters were used with the following: maximum interior/bulge loop size was 30, maximum asymmetry of an interior/bulge loop was 30 and there was no
limit on maximum distance between paired bases.
mRNA/ncRNA duplex structures were obtained by positioning the two individual RNAs 5' to 3' one after the
other starting with the mRNA first and adding ten Ns
between the two polynucletides. RNA secondary struc-

Options and figures in this paper were modified from

Nucleotide sequences were aligned with the DNASTAR
MegAlign alignment program [60]. Parameters used were
that of J. Hein with gap penalty 11, gap length, 3; ClustalV, with gap penalty 10, gap length 10 or ClustalW with
gap penalty 15, gap length, 6.66. Percent identities and
consensus sequences were based on DNASTAR program.
Proposed 5' start of RNAs was based on alignment with
known 5' start sites of homologous RNAs.
Search for micF RNA primary and secondary structure
motifs in P. luminescens
The strategy used to search for a putative micF RNA in P.
luminescens was to scan the genome using the conserved
13 nt 5' end micF sequence, i.e., 5'G1CTATCATCATTA133'
as well as variations of this sequence. Variations included
T at position 2, T at positions 6 and 9, and in addition, a
total of 4 random substitutions. A different first pattern
that provides perfect complementarily to the ompF mRNA
5' UTR was also employed: 5'G1TTTCATCATTATT143'.
Variations included a total of four random substitutions
and also allowing for the insertion of an A residue randomly between the 3rd and 10th base of the pattern.
Additional constraints consisted of a rho- independent
termination pattern situated 35â85 bp downstream the
two basic 5' end patterns shown above. The parameters
used for the terminal rho- independent structure were a
stem-loop followed by at least four T residues. The stem
was 4â15 bp with a minimum of three G-C pairs, the loop
3â8 bases, and the maximum folding energy of loop was
-9 Kcal/mol. Scans for the termination motif were performed after the initial identification of the two patterns
shown above.

For scanning the P. luminescens genome, the perl programing language was used. Additional scans were performed
for -10 and -35 promoter sequences as described in Supplement, Additional file 1. To avoid 0 values, discounting
for the probabilities in the consensus sequences were
applied. Jeffrey Perk's law was used [61]:
Jeffey Perk's law: P(w) = (C(w)+1/2)/(N+B/2),
where P is the assigned probability, w is a DNA character
assignment, C(w) is the frequency of the character in the
consensus table for the specific position, N is the number
of training sequences used for the creation of the consensus table and B is the number of possible values for our
character i.e., 4.

Second review following revisions: The manuscript by
Papamichail & Delihas deals with the prediction of outer
membrane proteins (OMP) and their regulators in the
genome of Photorhabdus luminescens. The genome of
Escherichia coli, a close relative of P. luminescens, contains
three major outer membrane proteins that are regulated
by trans-coded antisense RNAs. Using bioinformatics
tools, Papamichail & Delihas search for the existence of
similar genes in the genome of P. luminescens.
Following the first review iteration, bioinformatics analyses have been added to improve the manuscript. In its current state, the study presents a convincing evidence for the
existence/loss of OMP in P. luminescens.
Remarks:
- In figure 1, there are two unmarked objects: a blue one
in E. coli, and pink one in S. typhimurium. Following the

reply to the first review I now know which are they, but I
think it is important to repot the information also to the
reader (i.e., in the figure's legend).

- The presented alignments would be clearer in PrettyAlign format, or any other tool/format that presents an
alignment with color-coded animo-acids. Such format
enables the reader an immediate overall perception of the
sequences' conservation degree.

- Citing links that oblige the user to enter some detail
(such as CDD and other NCBI links) may be problematic,
mainly because the cited databases may be updated after
the publication of the manuscript. I would recommend
saving the query result and adding it as supplementary
material.

Author's response
Drs. Gelfand's and Gerasimova's initial comments were
that the manuscript was interesting but limited in that a
global assessment of ncRNAs as well as phylogenetic relations of ompFs were needed. These have been included in
the Supplement.

Second review following revisions: The authors describe a
search of the Photorhabdus luminescens genome for outer
membrane proteins and for their trans encoded small
RNA regulators. In addition to the previously recognized
ompA homolog, the authors identify two ompF homologs
in the P. luminescens genome that evolved from a gene
duplication. A search for small regulatory RNAs only identifies a micA homolog. The authors discuss their findings
in light of the P. luminescens lifecycle.
Minor criticisms and suggestions were made [in the first
review] and the have authors satisfactorily addressed
these.
