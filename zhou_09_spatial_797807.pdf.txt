Abstract
The 1st International Symposium on Geospatial Health was convened in Lijiang, Yunnan province,
People's Republic of China from 8 to 9 September, 2007. The objective was to review progress
made with the application of spatial techniques on zoonotic parasitic diseases, particularly in
Southeast Asia. The symposium featured 71 presentations covering soil-transmitted and waterborne helminth infections, as well as arthropod-borne diseases such as leishmaniasis, malaria and
lymphatic filariasis. The work made public at this occasion is briefly summarized here to highlight
the advances made and to put forth research priorities in this area. Approaches such as
geographical information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS) and remote sensing (RS),
including spatial statistics, web-based GIS and map visualization of field investigations, figured
prominently in the presentation.

Background
The goal of the '1st International Symposium on Geospatial Health', convened in Lijiang, Yunnan province, People's Republic of China from 8 to 9 September, 2007, was
to review advances made in the control of zoonotic parasitic diseases through the use of geospatial tools. The symposium, organized by the Global Network for Geospatial
Health http://www.gnosisGIS.org and supported by the
Ministry of Health (MoH) of China, the World Health
Organization (WHO), and the UNICEF/UNDP/World
Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training

in Tropical Diseases (TDR) [1], was held in conjunction
with the '7th Annual Meeting of the Regional Network for
Asian Schistosomiasis and Other Zoonotic Helminthiases' (RNAS+; http://www.rnas.org.cn) [2]. It attracted
more than 150 participants from 19 countries/regions
and international organizations and the 71 presentations,
including 10 plenary sessions, dealt with intervention
strategies, risk profiling, spatio-temporal modeling of parasitic disease transmission, biological investigations to
further our understanding of the interaction between vectors and/or intermediate hosts with the definitive human

host, as well as database management and sharing of data.
Geostatistical approaches and time series analyses have
been employed in schistosomiasis control in China,
including random-effect modeling, transmission dynamics and Bayesian geostatistics.

other snail-borne diseases of medical and veterinary
importance, and resulted in the establishment of the 'Global Network for Geospatial Health' whose scope has since
expanded to include also other widespread infectious diseases [1]. The current objectives of the network are to:

The symposium was essentially an initiative intended to
encourage local and international scientists to share data
and geospatial health applications in compatible format
with special emphasis on the region represented by the
site of the annual RNAS+ meeting. It had the form of an
open forum where the information from different regions
and diseases was freely exchanged. Results from simple
cross-sectional surveys as well as advanced modeling,
such as that based on random-effects, spatio-temporal
studies or transmission dynamics, were presented along
with Bayesian statistics and multidisciplinary theory. The
overarching theme was 'Towards a Regional Information
System for Control of Parasitic Diseases in the Greater
Mekong Sub-Region'.

• facilitate the development of GIS-based early warning
systems concerning infectious diseases;

In the remote past, doctors could only observe the
progress of, say the Black Death, but were powerless to
interfere due to inadequate understanding of the cause,
while we now have an essentially full understanding of
infectious agents and their interrelation with humans,
vectors and intermediate hosts [3,4]. Moreover, technical
progress in recent decades has provided the necessary
instruments to study these interrelationships in great
detail using geographical information systems (GIS) and
satellite-based remote sensing (RS). This new approach to
the epidemiology has come into its own during the last
few years as it has become increasingly clear that, from the
geological point of view, we live in a period of rapid environmental transformation [5-7]. Already, areas have been
identified where new incursions of diseases can be
expected, e.g., schistosomiasis in northern China [8],
malaria at higher altitudes in Africa [9], and zoonotic diseases in southern Europe [10]. GIS and RS provide the
early-warning tools needed to permit preemptive planning to limit risk and impact. Remotely-sensed data on
terrestrial characteristics and variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, along with other environmental
factors, govern the distribution of infectious agents as well
as the intermediate hosts and vectors they might utilize.
Therefore, the application of this new technology has
been growing rapidly and nowhere is this more evident
than with regard to parasitic diseases [11].
The application of geospatial activities summarized here
emanates originally from a team residency in April 2000
at the Bellagio Study and Conference Center in Italy,
sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was dedicated to the development of computer-based models for
improving control programmes for schistosomiasis and

• collect data, produce risk maps, develop ecological
niche models, and distribute GIS health applications of
general interest via its website;
• offer training courses on health applications of geospatial tools through an 'International School of Geospatial
Health'; and
• publish Geospatial Health, an open-access, peer-reviewed
journal that focusses on health applications in the geospatial sciences, which accepts articles on all aspects of the
application of GIS, RS and other spatial analytical tools in
veterinary and public health.
Zoonotic diseases, in particular parasitic diseases with
their dependence on intermediate hosts and/or vectors,
are closely linked to environment, ecology and climate
[12,13]. Therefore, the spatial distribution of these diseases can reveal important information of their transmission. The symposium emphasized spatial techniques and
spatial analytic methods. GIS, global positioning systems
(GPS) and RS belong to the general toolbox of any studies
in this field, while spatial statistics (spatial point pattern
analysis and clustering analysis) lends itself particularly
well to the study of schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis as
shown below.

General approach
In the developing world, parasitic infections by multiple
species are the norm rather than the exception [14]. In
view of the growing political and financial commitment
to control these parasitic diseases, there is a need to
develop spatially-explicit databases so that control efforts
can be targeted in an efficient and cost-effective manner
[15,16]. Therefore, the symposium had, as the main focus,
the establishment of spatial databases for risk profiling of
multiple species parasitic diseases. The introductory discussion illustrates how demographic, environmental and
socio-economic data can be readily obtained from existing village registries, simple cross-sectional questionnaire
surveys and remotely-sensed environmental data
obtained from satellite sensors [17]. The information
sought is very often available in the form of ground maps,
aerial photos, satellite images, whereas geographical coordinates are readily obtained by a GPS tool. When official
censuses cannot be obtained, the population data, includ-

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:10

ing demography and socio-economy, in the confined area
can be supported by questionnaires. Infection and/or disease, including clinical, parasitological, serological and
morbidity data, can then be presented in an overlaying
raster, incorporated into a GIS platform and linked to
socio-economic and/or environmental data derived from
cross-sectional surveys and remote sensing data. Accurate
information on multiple species parasitic infections
requires adequate sampling and the use of a combination
of different diagnostic methods. With such spatiallyexplicit databases at hand, researchers can perform risk
factor analyses and produce risk maps of both single and
multiple diseases [17-19].

Technological aspects and methodology
Geo-referencing and visualization
GIS has become a universally applied platform for visualization and analysis of spatial data, while GPS and RS
have become important tools to obtain geographic information in epidemiology [16,20,21]. Accuracy of positioning is an important GPS characteristic and was indeed
widely used in the papers presented at the symposium,
particularly in small-scale field work where particularly
accurate positioning is needed. Qing Yu introduced the
symposium participants to a wireless GPS capable of communicating positions in real-time, rapidly recording information and maintaining a close contact with the
monitoring center [22].

RS is an important data resource for presentation of vegetation, land cover and land use. Typically, mosquito and
snail habitats are closely related to these factors which
therefore make necessary ingredients in studies exploring
the density of vectors and intermediate hosts of parasites
[23,24]. Xinjian Xu and colleagues discussed the use of RS
image manipulation to study the potential expansion of
the snail-infested areas with the 1998 unusual flooding of
the Yangtze River [25]. They found areas suitable for habitation by Oncomelania hupensis, which occupied 23.3%,
40.1%, 43.1% and 5.7% in total of the flooded areas in
Jiang Han Plain, Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake and the
lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Anhui province,
respectively. This type of area could rapidly translate into
high-risk areas for schistosomiasis.
Lingling Ma retrieved eco-environmental factors concerning Oncomelania snail distribution from QuickBird satellite images of Pengxinzhou, Dangtu county, Anhui
province. She constructed a spatial GIS database of snail
distribution based on an ArcGIS platform from 153
ground observations, which includes snail density, the
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), the leaf area
index retrieved by NDVI (LAINDVI), the leaf area index
retrieved by MSAVI (LAIMSAVI), the vegetation cover ratio

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/10

retrieved by NDVI (FNDVI) and the vegetation cover ratio
retrieved by MSAVI (FMSAVI). Based on these measurements, a regression formula could be articulated modeling the distribution of O. hupensis based on the collected
data as follows:
Y = -3.92 + 1.22 × LAIMSAVI + 16.08 × FMSAVI
where Y is the snail density, LAIMSAVI the leaf area index
and FMSAVI the vegetation cover ratio retrieved by MSAVI
[26]. Analysis of remotely-sensed images can also help to
classify the habitat type. For example, Zhaojun Li and colleagues found five different types of environment in the
high-risk marshlands around the Poyang Lake, namely (i)
water, (ii) sand, (iii) swamp, (iv) flat beach, and (v) steep
beach [27]. The latter three types can be remotely-sensed
and identified by the TM satellite and can thus be utilized
to get an idea of the vegetation of the marshlands. RS analysis can, in principle, spatially confirm the distribution
pattern of Oncomelania snails, i.e., their habitats are
mainly distributed in the vegetation areas of lower lakebeach locations. In this way, high-risk endemic areas can
be clearly, precisely, and quickly located by superimposing vegetation data onto a general map of an area.
In China, geospatial techniques have been applied to
research on schistosomiasis in the plain and lake regions
of China, but few of this has been previously attempted in
the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces [28]. It was therefore of great interest to note the
work by Yi Dong and his group in Dali, Yunnan province.
They showed, for the first time, that the altitude is an
important factor affecting the snail density in this type of
endemic area, using the following formula:
Y = log-1 (1.12 + 2.14 × X - 0.001 × X1)
where Y is the snail density, X the NDVI and X1 the altitude above sea level in meters [28].
Spatio-temporal clustering analysis is usually used to
explore the epidemic tendency of infectious diseases [29].
Zhijie Zhang and Qing Fu provided examples of this in
their studies on schistosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. In the schistosomiasis study, two clusters
with statistical significance in the Guichi district, Anhui
province were found [30]. The leishmaniasis study area
was located in the oasis area in Kashgar (or Kashi) region
in China, which is a focus for control, prevention and surveillance of visceral leishmaniasis. In this study, Qing Fu
and colleagues identified three spatial cluster zones [31].
Interpolation, kriging especially, is useful for the production of the predicted value at unknown locations based on
the known values of surrounding points. In epidemiolog-

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:10

ical surveys, it is helpful to grasp the overall situation by
acquiring information about non-sampled locations.
Shan Lv applied this approach to study the prevalence of
Angiostrongylus cantonensis in China [32]. This parasite,
causing meningoencephalitis, was identified in the intermediate host snails collected from the fields and it was
shown that two invasive snail species (i.e., Pomacea canaliculata and Achatina fulica) had become important vectors/hosts.
Although, GIS is useful for the analysis of spatial patterns
and spatial associations, as well as a repository for storage,
management and visualization of spatially-explicit data,
most software packages lack the simulative and predictive
capabilities necessary for complex dynamic processes
such as infectious disease transmission. Haitang Hu and
colleagues discussed this aspect introducing a process-oriented spatio-temporal model for schistosomiasis transmission simulation [33]. To represent not only objects
and events, but also processes and their relationship, they
proposed integration of four base classes besides the
object classes in traditional GIS, namely (i) a parameter
class, (ii) a model class, (iii) a process class, and (iv) a
process-set class. To effectively represent the output of
spatio-temporal analysis and process simulation, they
developed a series of visualization methods including
maps, graphs, tables, animations (map or graph-based) as
well as internal links and interactions. The model supports visualization of the spatio-temporal information for
one or more geographically dynamic processes which can
be simulated through animation. Users can browse any
status instantaneously by setting the time and they can
also explore continuous change of any of the process of
interest in the form of animation.
Data management and web-based databases
The integration and accessibility of data are common
problems for all aspects of modern research, especially for
a deeper understanding of parasitic and pathogenic diseases, where a variety of details for patients, hosts, parasites, vectors/intermediate hosts and environmental
conditions are required for epidemiological studies.

The web-based public health and disease control GIS system in the Mekong region is a good example to exhibit
how to gather, collate, visualize and analyze data. Zhang
discussed the design and implementation of the 'Mekong
Disease Control Web GIS', based on the 'China Next Generation Internet' (CNGI) [34]. In order to test web application in this new CNGI environment, GIS for public
health and disease control has been built into the project
which includes six countries related to the Mekong River.
The system is used for the sharing of public health and disease control information in this region and consists of
CNGI hardware containing Internet protocol version 6

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/10

(IPV6) gateways and switches and a WebGIS software,
which provides service and client support [35]. In this system, the database includes five parts, namely (i) basic geographic data, (ii) sanitation data, (iii) statistics, (iv)
epidemic disease source data, and (v) outbreak epidemic
data. The three main functions include public health and
disease information, epidemic reporting and an emergency command structure. The outbreak epidemic disease
data can be entered into the web system and deliver disease information in real time.
Another web-based system presented during the symposium is the Fireflower http://www.fireflower.ca, which is
equipped with multi-disciplinary electronic data collection and management service (including a language translation module) for use anywhere in the world at any time.
Although Fireflower can be used by individuals, it is particularly useful for interdisciplinary research teams, where
members may work from a wide variety of different locations. Data can be collected at any time from laboratories,
clinics, hospitals or the field, and immediately made
available to other members of the team, wherever they
are. Fireflower is currently being used by the EU-funded
CONTRAST programme, a multidisciplinary alliance to
optimize schistosomiasis control and transmission surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa http://www.eu-con
trast.eu/. Within this programme, detailed schistosomiasis data are collected from different countries across subSaharan Africa in a collaborative venture and historical
data are retrieved from systematically reviewing the extent
literature [36]. The system enables data from many different aspects to be integrated, correlated and analyzed, and
provides simple mechanisms for searching, sharing and
dissemination of information to authenticated clients.
The system works in conjunction with GIS systems and a
particular useful aspect is that users can toggle between
different languages and fully understand each other without personal multi-language knowledge.
Modelling and Bayesian geostatistics
The way Bayesian statistics facilitates geospatial and epidemiological analysis has made it increasingly popular
[17,37-40]. In order to understand the spatio-temporal
heterogeneity of schistosomiasis, Xiao-Nong Zhou and
Kun Yang applied this type of statistics to schistosomiasis
transmission dynamics to identify effective intervention
strategies in different settings [41]. They investigated the
epidemiology at various spatial scales by developing spatio-temporal models to analyze county-level data from
serological surveys carried out in China from 2002–2005
by taking into account NDVI and land surface temperature (LST) data from the MODIS satellite. They also used
an index indicating the prevailing economic development
for the area studied. This work showed that the impact of
environmental factors on seroprevalence of Schistosoma

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:10

japonicum infection varied in accordance with the environment and economic status of study villages. In the lake
regions, there was a strong spatial correlation with temporal variability of seroprevalence and the spatial correlation
coefficients ranged from 0.87 to 0.95 [42]. Places with relatively high prevalence rates were concentrated near the
Poyang and Dongting lakes, while, in the mountainous
endemic regions, the spatial correlation was weak. Furthermore, in a study in Dangtu county, it was found that
a second-order ordinary kriging approach of spatial analysis facilitated the prediction of human prevalence of S.
japonicum infection at the unit of the village. Four different
strata, based on human prevalence rates and type of transmission, were established. Subsequently, different strategies to control schistosomiasis transmission, based on
environmental idiosyncrasies, were put forward [43]. The
use of landscape pattern analysis, coupled with Bayesian
spatial modeling, was successfully applied to predict the
distribution of O. hupensis at the local scale [41].
A study, offering insight into a potential impact of climate
change on mosquito abundance due to higher tide frequencies and intensities with the expected rise of the sea
level, showed by Guo-Jing Yang and colleagues that efficient and effective mosquito control requires a better
understanding of vector population dynamics and how
these are modified by endogenous and exogenous factors.
A dataset describing the relative abundance of Aedes vigilax
in the greater Darwin region, northern Australia, over an
11-year period was examined in a suite of Gompertzlogistic (GL) models [44] with, and without, hypothesized environmental correlates (e.g., high-tide frequency,
rainfall and relatively humidity). It was also examined
whether environmental correlates could explain the variance in seasonal carrying capacity (K). Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) [45],
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [46], and the socalled jack-knifed cross-validation (C-V) [47]. The GL
model with a 2-month lag without environmental effects
explained 31% of the variation in population growth rate
[44]. This increased to >70% under various model combinations of high-tide frequency, rainfall and relative
humidity. Temporal variation in K was explained by hightide frequency and reduced Ae. vigilax carrying capacity
over the study period. This investigation underscored the
imperative of considering simultaneously both types of
drivers (endogenous and exogenous) when predicting
mosquito abundance and population growth patterns.
Diagnostic techniques
Peter Steinmann and colleagues assessed different techniques for diagnosis of intestinal parasites in human faeces [48]. Up to three stool specimens from a random
population sample in the Nongyang village in the south
of Yunnan province were collected and subjected to four
diagnostic techniques: the Kato-Katz method, an ether-

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/10

concentration technique (only 1 sample/person), the
Koga agar plate method and the Baermann technique. It
was found that screening three rather than a single stool
sample and employing different techniques increased the
diagnostic sensitivity, most notably for hookworm and
Strongyloides stercoralis. Furthermore, it was reported that
S. stercoralis is endemic in the southern part of Yunnan
province [48]. The authors concluded that the use of different diagnostic assays and the collection of multiple
stool samples are necessary to estimate the 'true' extent of
intestinal parasites and to investigate the often neglected
issue of multiparasitism [48,49]. Researchers should
therefore be encouraged to use a suite of diagnostic
approaches to gain a more valid picture of local parasite
fauna, which in turn can guide subsequent integrated control interventions.
Molecular and genetic techniques
It would seem that the combination of genetic variation
and geographic distribution should reveal biodiversity. To
that end, Thanh Hoa Le mapped the spatial distribution
of different food-borne and water-borne zoonotic parasites (i.e., Fasciola spp.,Fasciolopsis buski, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis, Paragonimus heterotremus and
Haplorchis spp.) in Vietnam, based on sequences of mitochondrial DNA (cox1; nad1), nuclear internal transcribed
spacer 2 (ITS-2) and alternatively, ribosomal 18S rDNA
[50]. The molecular analysis revealed that the Vietnamese
Fasciola population belonged to two genotypes: a pure F.
gigantica and a hybrid/introgressed form of F. gigantica
and F. hepatica, both distributed throughout Vietnam and
found in all hosts [50]. Molecular analysis confirmed that
opisthorchiasis in Vietnam comprises of O. viverrini (in
the southern provinces) and C. sinensis (in the northern
provinces). While C. sinensis showed little variation, O.
viverrini indicated a broad divergence based on comparative analysis of isolates from Vietnam, Laos and Thailand.
Faciolopsis spp. were molecularly identified as F. buski and,
unlike Fasciola spp., genetically unique in isolates of
human and pig origin in Vietnam but varied slightly in
comparison to Indian samples. The Taenia population
comprises T. saginata in cattle, T. solium in pigs and
humans, and T. asiatica in human. In Vietnam, T. solium
belongs to the Asian subgroup. P. heterotremus, collected
from different life-stages and hosts in Vietnam, was found
to be molecularly unique and seen only in hosts from the
mountainous provinces of North Vietnam. The small
intestinal flukes were identified as a mixed population of
H. pumulio and H. taichui, with a possible intermediate
genotype based on the variability of mini-satellites in the
ITS-2 marker. The Haplorchis complex is distributed in the
15 provinces so far investigated in Vietnam. In addition,
Thanh Hoa Le and colleagues have now completed the
mtDNA sequencing for C. sinensis, O. viverrini, F. gigantica,
F. buski, which will undoubtedly facilitate the molecular
investigation of these food-borne trematodes [51].

Smarn Tesana analyzed the genetic variation of Bithynia
siamensis goniomphalos, the first intermediate host of O.
viverrini, from 19 provinces in northeast Thailand using
RAPD-PCR [52]. Three localities in each province and 10
snail samples from each locality were collected for the
study, 570 samples in total. The intra-population variability was studied in 10 ecological sites (10 snail samples
from each site), looking for genetic homogeneity. The
results were analyzed by using phylogeny inference package (PHYLIP) and a phylogenetic tree constructed with
the snails in the same family of Bithyniidae (B. siamensis
siamensis, B. funiculata and Wattebledia crosseana) as outgroups. The genetic variation of inter-population could be
divided into four groups belonging to the basin of the
four main rivers of the northeast, namely (i) the Mun
River, (ii) the Chi River, (iii) the Songkhram River, and
(iv) the Leoi River, while the genetics seemed to be relatively conserved in species from each of the separate water
systems [52].

Applications
Food-borne diseases
Food-borne trematodiases, caused by C. sinensis, O. viverrini, and other liver, lung and intestinal flukes are truly
neglected tropical diseases. They constitute a public health
problem of enormous proportions: an estimated 750 million people are at risk for these infections with more than
40 million individuals currently infected [53,54]. Many
factors conspire to explain their high prevalence, but lack
of insight and poor recognition of these trematode infections, in the face of lacking political will and financial
means to control them, may explain their neglected status
[55]. In addition, the generally poor sanitation, poverty,
malnutrition, exponential growth of inland fish production (aquaculture) and lack of food inspections in the
endemic areas no doubt contribute substantially to the situation which, in fact, could be controlled with the tools
available today.

At the symposium, survey data covering the period 1990–
2006 were reported to have found 14% of examined people to be infected with C. sinensis in Guangdong province,
China [56]. The distribution of these cases had a strong
link to the water network of the Pearl River, which leads
to an estimate of 5 million people possibly being infected
in the province as a whole. Interestingly, although Anhui
province in central China, which is also characterized by a
prominent water network, had an infection rate below 1%
(based on the 2002–2003 survey [57]). It is conceivable
that the higher socio-economic development in Anhui
province is an underlying factor explaining the lower C.
sinensis infection prevalence compared to Guangdong
province, a fact supported by the finding that the highest
infection rates were found in remote rural areas such as,
for example, the northern plain region along the Huaihe
River.

B. siamensis goniomphalos is the first intermediate host
snail of O. viverrini in Northeast Thailand. The snail's
genetic variation has been analyzed and shown to be
divided into four groups belonging to the basin of the
four main rivers of this part of the country [52]. A reported
high prevalence of 'Opisthorchis-like' eggs in human faecal
samples was reported from a study area in Laos [58]. In a
survey covering two villages and some hospitals, 86% of
general villagers and 90% of hospitalized patients, respectively, were found to be infected with O. viverrini. The distribution of the disease and the parasite in Southeast Asia
clearly indicates that both are endemic throughout the
region but there is a strikingly high prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in northeast Thailand and Laos where this
liver fluke infection is particularly common [59]. Indeed,
there is no stronger link between a human malignancy
and a parasitic infection than the link between cholangiocarcinoma and O. viverrini infection [60].
Cysticercosis, caused by T. solium, and cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis) are often neglected in China in spite of
their effect on public health and agriculture [61]. Echinococcosis is mainly endemic in pasture areas in the western
part of the country and a recent survey showed that the
prevalence of the disease is, on average, 1%, while serological antibody screening indicates that 12% have had
contact with the parasite in the relatively recent past [62].
Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang and
Inner Mongolia are all highly endemic areas, while provinces such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Hebei and Henan have much less infection and most
other areas have none at all. In recent years, the disease
has spread to previously non-endemic areas and the
number of imported cases has increased. In Nepal, the disease is prevalent in Banepa, Panauti and Dhulikhel [63].
Although the number of humans in the areas investigated
is low, there are indications that 9% of the population is
infected [64]. Several factors facilitate transmission such
as uncontrolled slaughtering under unhygienic conditions, lack of meat inspection programmes, and unawareness of how the disease is transmitted.
Taenia infections are related to certain ethnic groups and
their pork consumption habits, literacy rate, hygiene
behaviour and lack of adequate sanitation. Pork consumption is rapidly increasing in Nepal and this influences the incidence of this infection. Among studied
ethnic groups, Magars, Sarkies, Darai and Bote, the prevalence was found to be 50%, 28%, 10% and 30%, respectively [64]. A recent report claims that 10.5% of 200
slaughtered pigs were positive by lingual examination,
while post-mortem examination, presumably more accurate, gave a positive rate of 20.5% [64].
Taeniasis and cysticercosis are highly prevalent in China's
poor regions, e.g., the infection rate of T. solium has been

found to be as high as 67% in Lanping county, Yunnan
province [65]. A survey conducted in the Yi minority
township in Sichuan province in 2006 found 9% of the
population reporting epilepsy or occasional seizures,
while subcutaneous nodules were observed in 1.5% of all
people examined [66]. Although less than 1.5% actually
excrete parasite eggs according to stool examinations, a
PCR test performed on 151 of the 191 faecal samples
tested, found traces of T. solium asiatica in 62 individuals
(41%) and in one person (0.7%) traces of T. solium asiatica
[66]. Several risk factors appeared to be important in this
community, including common consumption of raw or
undercooked pork and absence of pig fencing. Additionally, latrine-facilities commonly serve many families.
Thus, poor hygiene conditions, low socio-economic status
and little knowledge about this disease facilitate the transmission.
Angiostrongyliasis is an emerging parasitic disease in
China and public awareness increased when a large outbreak occurred in Beijing in 2006 with 160 individuals
involved [67]. The first national survey covering the
endemic areas was conducted in 2006 and revealed that
natural transmission of angiostrongyliasis are particularly
common in the Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang,
Hainan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces. Importantly, A.
cantonensis was identified in two invasive snails species
(i.e., P. canaliculata and A. fulica) [32,67]. It has been proposed, based on infection rates of P. canalicualta, that the
endemic areas should be classified according to the degree
of endemicity and preventive measures implemented
according to the need (Table 1).
Aquaculture
The increasing prominence of aquaculture in Southeast
Asia, with several-fold increases in freshwater fish production in the last few decades [54], have emphasized the role
of aquaculture in the transmission of fish-borne zoonoses. In Vietnam, a large project, the "Fish-Borne Zoonotic
Parasites in Vietnam Project (FIBOZOPA)" http://fiboz
opa.ria1.org/uni/home involves Vietnamese and Danish
institutions and has been launched to foster research and
build capacity to assess the status and risks for fish-borne
zoonoses in Vietnamese aquaculture [68]. The project

started in 2003 and has documented widespread presence
of fish-borne zoonoses in aquaculture, including seven
new fish-borne parasites in Vietnam [68]. New evidence
has been generated for the important role of domestic animal reservoirs in sustaining fish-borne zoonoses in the
absence of human infection. Work is in progress on identifying snail intermediate hosts and assessing the ecological factors regulating their populations as well as the
development of molecular-based detection tools. Future
research needs to establish sustainable fish-borne zoonoses control measures in Vietnam and nearby countries
such as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. These would
include mapping out the national and regional distributions of fish-borne zoonoses determining underlying risk
factors for transmission (Figures 1 and 2).
Soil-transmitted helminthiases
Hookworm infection
Hookworm infection is a major cause of anaemia and
malnutrition of humans living in the developing world,
especially in the tropical regions [69,70]. The prevalence
varies with the geographical location as well as with the
prevailing economic and social conditions. Recent studies
in Yunnan province, China [48,71] showed a prevalence
as low as 0.3% in Dali, while the level was 89% in Xishuangbanna, a community which is not far away from
there. In one survey in Hainan island, the southernmost
Chinese province, the overall infection rate of hookworm
was found to be 33% [72]. A trend of increasing incidence
with age was seen and the infection rate in farmers was
higher than that of other occupations. In addition, the
highest rate was found in the mountainous area on the
island. Species identification showed that 94% of the
infected persons harboured Necator americanus with less
than 1% infected with Ancylostoma duodenale only, while
mixed infections accounted for 5% of all cases. In 2003,
the overall prevalence in Yunnan province was shown to
have decreased from 22% in the early 1960s to less than
6% and it is expected to be even lower today [73].
Ascariasis
Ascariasis, caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, is the most common helminthic disease globally, with an estimated
worldwide prevalence of 25% (0.8–1.4 billion people

the prevalence was found to be 11.7% [48]. Enterobius vermicularis was found in 7.4% of the participants in the
same community-based survey [48].

infected) [74,75]. Usually asymptomatic infections are
most prevalent in children in the tropical and developing
countries, where they are perpetuated by direct contamination of the soil by human faeces or the use of untreated
faeces as fertilizer ('night soil'). Symptomatic disease may
be manifested by growth retardation, pneumonitis, intestinal obstruction, or hepatobiliary and pancreatic injury.
In developing countries, ascariasis may exist as a zoonotic
infection associated with exposure to pigs or pig manure.
In China, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides infections have
come down from 65.6% in the early 1960s to 16.9% in
2003 in Yunnan province [73], but it is still very high in
some regions and remains therefore an important public
health problem. A recent survey, conducted in the village
of Nongyang in the southern part of Yunnan province,
found an A. lumbricoides prevalence of 92.6% [48].
Trichuriasis
Trichuriasis, caused by Trichuris trichiura, is the third most
common roundworm infection of humans [76]. Like
ascariasis, the disease occurs globally, with infections
more frequent in areas with tropical weather and poor
sanitation practices, and often among children [74,75]. It
is estimated that 800 million individuals are infected
worldwide [74,75]. However, in Yunnan province, the
average prevalence of T. trichiura was reduced from 12.9%
in the early 1960s to 2.2% in 2003 [73]. Steinmann and
colleagues recently reported the prevalence of T. trichiura
to be 1.7% in Dali and 88.8% in Xishuangbanna prefecture in Yunnan province [48,71].
Other soil-transmitted diseases
In the above-mentioned survey conducted in the village of
Nongyang in Xishuangbanna prefecture, sufficient
amounts of stool were obtained from 180 participants for

Water-borne parasitic diseases
Schistosomiasis
Although many water-borne, intestinal protozoa capable
of causing important infections exist in Southeast Asia (as
well as in most parts of the tropical world), e.g., Blastocystis
hominis, Endolimax nana, Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba
coli, E. hartmanni, E. histolytica/E. dispar and Iodamoeba bütschlii, their role is greatly overshadowed by schistososomiasis, which is caused by S. japonicum or S. mekongi in
this part of the world [77]. In Southeast Asia, schistosomiasis is a main threat to health in China and the Philippines and exists focally also in Indonesia, Cambodia
and Laos.

Few countries have achieved as great a success in schistosomiasis control as has China [78]. The control programme has been sustained for over 50 years and the
human prevalence rate of S. japonicum has gradually been
lowered year by year resulting in a more than 90%
decrease over this period of time [79]. However, even if
the prevalence has been greatly reduced in most of the
country, interruption of transmission remains a formidable challenge [80,81]. In order to provide information on
the significance of bovines in the transmission of human
schistosomiasis, the spatial and temporal contamination
of the environment by bovine faeces has been studied
[82]. Xiao-Hua Wu and collaborators performed correlation and regression analyses using data from three
national sampling surveys on schistosomiasis, carried out
in 1989, 1995 and 2004, respectively, established a GIS
and performed spatial analyses to identify the high-risk
areas of the disease [83]. They found that while the
human prevalence and force of transmission in highly
endemic areas (e.g., in marshlands along the Yangtze
River and in the southwestern mountainous region [84])
has been reduced since 1989, the relative importance of
bovine schistosomiasis has increased. This is reflected by
a declining Spearman correlation coefficient between the
infection prevalence in humans and in bovines over time
(0.81 in 1989, 0.75 in 1995 and 0.38 in 2004). In parallel,
the slope of the linear regression decreased from 0.39 in
1989 to 0.21 in 2004 [83]. The data clearly suggest that
future schistosomiasis control efforts in China should
more vigorously address the important role of bovines in
the transmission of human schistosomiasis [85], and
focus on the reduction of the environmental contamination of S. japonicum eggs by bovines [86].
Less well-known, but still the largest water deviation in
the world, is the 'South-to-North Water Transfer Project'
(SNWTP), aimed at improving the current water shortage

endemic areas, were 2.1% and 1.0%, respectively. An estimated 3.3% of these people came from endemic areas,
and 1.3% of the individuals returning from them had a
history of schistosomiasis. Additionally, more than
120,000 livestock were imported from endemic areas.
Since there is currently no schistosomiasis transmission in
the Three Gorges region, disease-specific health education
is not regularly provided and less than 5% of the local residents know anything about schistosomiasis and its control [94]. All these factors conspire to increase the risk of
introduction of schistosomiasis here and hence there is a
pressing need for monitoring and surveillance.

in the northern part of China [87,88]. It adds to the risk
posed by bovine schistosomiasis by opening the gates for
the dispersal of infected O.hupensis snails along the diversion routes (especially the eastern routes) to northern
China. Yixin Huang and colleagues evaluated the possibility of the endemic areas extending from the southern to
the northern parts of China following the implementation of the SNWTP [89]. The researchers concluded that
the water flow and constructions are secure vis-à-vis the
spread of Oncomelania snails from the south to north in
the water diversion of the eastern route project. However,
the potential for transmission of Oncomelania snails may
exist south of latitude 33°15 N in Jiangsu province, such
as in the Lixia River basin, in the Jinbao River and in the
Hongze Lake [88] (Figure 3).
Major ecological transformations occurred after the Three
Gorges Dam construction across the Yangtze River [9092]. Due to the high water velocity in the river before the
construction, there was no natural Oncomelania habitat
and, historically, there has never been any schistosomiasis
transmission in this area. This situation has now changed
and it was reported at the symposium that Tricula sinica, a
snail which shares the ecological habitats with O. hupensis,
has been discovered in the area [93]. The increase of fishing, brought about by the development of the economy in
the Three Gorges Reservoir areas, has attracted mobile
people who live in their boats on the reservoir. The investigation by Cheng-Guo Wu and colleagues [94] show that
66.8% of mobile population came from endemic areas
and 52% of local residents returned from such areas had
a history of contact with snail-infested-water. The seropositive rates of the people, who came or returned from

The risk for transmission of schistosomiasis is determined
not only by individual behaviour and water contact patterns, but also by village-level factors [95,96]. In the
autumn of 2000, surveys were carried out in 20 villages in
the Anning River valley in south-western Sichuan, an area
with historically high rates of S. japonicum infection. It was
found that 29% of more than 3,000 residents tested positive for schistosomiasis. A random-effects model allowing
intercept of each village was used to estimate the effect of
water contact on infection based on 1,011 people with
infection and water-contact data. Each 100 min/m2
increase in water contact turned out to increase the odds
for infection by 1.1 (95% confidence interal: 1.0–1.2). A
similar random-effects model was also used to examine
how occupation, gender and age predicted an infection.
Farming was found to be the strongest predictor with
female farmers being at the greatest risk. In both analyses,
the random-effects models produced a significantly better
fit of the data than models lacking the random-slope factor, underscoring the importance of accounting for the
variance in infection risks between villages when assessing
individual-level predictors for infection [95,96].
The ubiquity of acute cases is important for judging
whether a region has reached the criteria of schistosomiasis control, and is one of the sensitive indices to evaluate
the epidemic situation [84]. The number of acute cases
has become very small translating into reduced importance in the overall control efforts. However, the spatial
statistics applied in recent years has made it possible to
study the epidemic characteristics of these cases, which
may provide a better support for the decision-making at
the government level [97]. Zhijie Zhang et al. [30] analyzed the surveillance data of acute schistosomiasis using
a spatial point pattern approach in the Guichi district,
Anhui province and found that the geographic center of
the distribution of acute cases shows a tendency to move
southward. In this study, two clusters with statistical significance were identified. The most likely cluster was
located in the intersection of the Yangtze and Qiupu rivers
at latitude 30.65 N and longitude 117.44 E with a radius
of 2.69 km. The relative risk was 12.78 (log-likelihood
ratio = 32.80, P < 0.001). The coordinates of the second
Page 9 of 16

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:10

cluster, situated in the southeast of Guichi district, was latitude 30.34 N and longitude 117.61 E with a radius of
4.57 km and a relative risk of 8.76 (log-likelihood ratio =
11.15, P = 0.002). Identification of such clusters is important to prioritize public health planning and resource allocation for schistosomiasis prevention and control.
Despite the availability of effective drug treatment, schistosomiasis remains prevalent in the Philippines and reinfection is still a major issue [98]. Luz Acosta and her
group assessed the impact of spatial clustering at the
household level in predicting intensity of re-infection
with S. japonicum [99]. They assigned clusters using the
equal population area (EPA) method and compared their
intensities of re-infection while adjusting for age, gender,
baseline infection intensity, observed water contact, and
socioeconomic status. The results show (i) that proximity
to irrigation canals and man-made reservoirs predicts reinfection intensity, and (ii) that spatial clustering at the
household level predicts intensity of re-infection after
adjusting for age, gender, baseline infection intensity, and
observed water contact. Spatial clustering of households is
an indicator of exposure to sources of infection.
The intermediate host snail
O. hupensis is the sole intermediate host of S. japonicum in
China. The availability of suitable habitats determines its
distribution [8]. Propagation and multiplication of the
snail are closely correlated to environmental factors such
as temperature, humidity, vegetation and soil which make
GIS and RS well suited to determine the location of potential snail habitats [97,100,101]. Snail control was once
considered as one of the most important measure in schistosomiasis control in China [41,102], while chemotherapy has now become more prominent. The distribution of
the snail intermediate host is far more extensive than that
of the disease-endemic areas, supporting the need for
snail control as an important part of the work for elimination of schistosomiasis in China. In fact, 14.6% (735)
townships in China are non-endemic with regard to schistosomiasis but this status has the potential of rapid
change as they still harbour the snails [82].

An experiment investigating the susceptibility of Oncomelania snails from a non-endemic area in Ningguo city,
Anhui province to S. japonicum miracidia was reported.
Surprisingly, it was found that these miracidia failed to
infect the snails from the non-endemic area, while the
snails from endemic areas could be infected [82]. This is
an interesting result and, since no large study on the susceptibility of Oncomelania snails has been conducted so
far, more experiments are urgently needed. If S. japonicum
miracidia will be found to be non-infective to certain
snails, or if the resulting infection rate is very low, the
schistosomiasis control strategies will have to be modified.

Shanghai used to be an endemic area (before 1985) but is
now free from schistosomiasis transmission. The result of
21 years of surveillance (1986–2006) showed that this
status can be maintained in spite of immigrating infected
individuals, who can be found all over the city in conjunction with O. hupensis snails. Three types of snail geo-distribution have been described in nine districts (Table 2).
Thirty-six snail-infested localities were found in three districts since 2006, 58.3% of which were smaller than 100
m2, 33.3% had a size between 100 m2 and 500 m2, and
8.3% were larger than 500 m2. Preventive measures such
as sanitary disposal of human excreta, treatment of
infected persons, treatment or elimination of reservoir
hosts, thus remain important. In Shanghai, the snail population is kept low by niclosamide treatment [103].
Arthropod-borne infections
Leishmaniasis
The first confirmed case of visceral leishmaniasis in China
was reported in 1907 [104]. Since then extensive areas
north of the Yangtze River (including 16 provinces) have
been recognized as endemic for visceral leishmaniasis
[105]. The disease was especially rampant in the east,
including the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui,
Henan and Hebei. In the northwest, the disease was
mainly prevalent in Shaanxi, Gansu and Xinjiang. Sporadic cases occurred in Beijing, Liaoning, Hubei, Shanxi,
Sichuan, Ningxia, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia. About
530,000 cases were reported in 1951 [106]. According to
surveys made in 1951, the average incidence in different
provinces was 10–50 per 10,000 people. Since the launch
of the nationwide control campaign against kala-azar in
1950–1958 [107], the disease was under control in most
of the endemic areas. However, transmission was not
interrupted in the mountainous and desert region where
sporadic cases continue to be reported. Currently, visceral
leishmaniasis is still prevalent or sporadically distributed
in six western provinces/autonomous regions, including
Xinjiang, Gansu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Inner
Mongolia [108].

Kashgar in Xinjiang autonomous region is the most prominent endemic region with respect to visceral leishmaniasis and the study by time-space clustering of the epidemic
situation of the diseases there has already been mentioned
before. With respect to visceral leishmaniasis and the
three spatio-temporal clusters (A, B and C) identified by
Qing Fu are of great interest. Zone A included Boshikelam,
the Haohan township of Kashi city and Awati town in
Shufu county. Its centre was at latitude 39.52 N and longitude 76.08 E with a radius of 6.58 km. The high-risk
time frame, calculated by kriging based on the ArcGIS
software, was from 1 January, 1999 to 31 December,
2003. The relative risk of visceral leishmaniasis incidence
was 46 times than that of outside of the scope (P < 0.001).
Zone B involved reclaimed farmland of Bachu county

ern desert area is only found in Karamay, Xinjiang autonomous region. It is caused by L. infantum, transmitted by
wild species Ph. wui. A 3-year survey from 1992–1994
indicated that the annual morbidity of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Karamay was 1.6% (36/2260), 1.0% (14/
1416) and 1.6% (24/1510), respectively [109].
Additionally, two species of Leishmania, nonpathogenic to
humans but which can infect the great gerbil, Rhombomys
opimus, have been found in China: L. gerbilli and L.
turanica [110]. The former is found in Xinjiang, Gansu
and Inner Mongolia and the vectors are Ph. mongolensis
and Ph. alexandri, while the latter is in Karamay of Xinjiang where the infection is transmitted by Ph. mongolensis
and Ph. andrejevi. Inoculation of the parasite in humans
induces a self-healing ulcer.

with its centre was at latitude 39.91 N and longitude
79.20 E with a radius of 4.93 km. The high-risk time frame
was from 1 January, 2002 to 31 December, 2006 with a
relative risk of visceral leishmaniasis incidence 9.6 times
higher than outside the scope (P < 0.001). Zone C
included Yinwusitang town in Shufu county and Yangdaman town in Shule county. Its centre was at latitude 39.40
N and longitude 76.23 E with a radius of 7.63 km. The
high-risk time frame was from 1 January, 2000 to 31
December, 2004, and the relative risk of visceral leishmaniasis incidence was 5.2 times higher than outside the
scope (P < 0.001).
Four epidemiologic and clinical types of leishmaniasis
have been recognized in China [109]. First, the Indian
type of classic kala-azar is anthroponotic (human to
human), caused by Leishmania donovani and most of the
patients are adults. This type is mainly distributed in the
plains of eastern China where the vector is the domestic
Phlebotomus chinensis, and in old oases in Kashi, Xinjiang,
where the disease is transmitted by peridomestic Ph. longiductus [106]. Second, the Mediterranean type of infantile
visceral leishmaniasis in the northern, central and western
hilly regions, caused by L. infantum and transmitted by
wild or semi-wild species Ph. chinensis. Dogs constitute the
most common reservoir and infants and children under
10 years of age are predominately the patients. Third, the
desert type of visceral leishmaniasis in the northwest
region is mainly distributed in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia
and Gansu provinces/autonomous regions. This disease is
caused by L. infantum and some unknown species of wild
animals and transmitted by wild species Ph. wui and Ph.
alexandri. Infants and children under three are commonly
the victims. Fourth, cutaneous leishmaniasis in the west-

Visceral leishmaniasis is still endemic in some mountainous areas in Sichuan province. Infected dogs and patients
with L. donovani are major infection sources. Ph. chinensis
as known sole vector is a wild type inhabiting the mountains. Although the disease has been under control since
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
leishmaniasis has gradually reemerged since 1972. The
current endemic area covers six counties in northwestern
Sichuan, including Jiuzhaigou, Heishui, Maoxian, Wenchuan and Lixian county of Aba Tibetan/Qiang Nationality Autonomous prefecture, and Beichuan county of
Mianyang municipality. During 2003–2006, a total of
124 cases were reported in the endemic areas, mainly
detected in the Jiuzhaigou and Heishui counties accounting for 86.4% of the total [111]. Pre-school and schoolaged children are generally the victims. Currently, the following strategies are carried out: treatment of patients,
health education, dog registration and management, and
sandfly control in combination with sanitary movements
of cities or towns. It is also crucial to pay attention to
immigration from non-leishmaniasis-endemic regions.
Two presentations of the Leishmania problem in Europe
discussed the spatial distribution of leishmaniasis in Italy.
The classical visceral leishmaniasis endemic zones are the
Tyrrhenian littoral, the southern peninsular regions and
the islands, where P. perniciosus is the main vector. Human
visceral leishmaniasis occurred sporadically with fewer
than 40 cases per year through the 1980s, but since the
early 1990s, the incidence has steadily increased with
cases reported from throughout the country and reaching
over 200 cases per year in the new millennium [112].
Beside the risk of visceral leishmaniasis spreading among
HIV-positive individuals, circumstantial evidence suggests
that the disease is actually spreading into previous nonendemic territories [113]. Studies covering the last five
years indicate that the infection in dogs has increased
from 21% to 32% from 2002 to 2005 and recent research

Page 11 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

Parasites & Vectors 2009, 2:10

shows that the prevalence exceeds 40% around the Vesuvius mountain [112,114].
In order to review and monitor this evolving scenario, surveillance activities have been implemented in north Italy,
by including (i) an analysis of all human visceral leishmaniasis cases recorded in the 1990–2005 period; (ii) a retrospective literature analysis of all canine leishmaniasis
cases and sandflies records through 2002; (iii) prospective
serological investigations in dogs from areas where autochthonous canine leishmaniasis cases were confirmed
(2003–2005); and (iv) surveys of the phlebotomine vector performed during the 2003–2004 warm seasons in the
above areas. The results retrospectively identified seven
foci of canine leishmaniasis since 1990, whereas the prospective investigation disclosed 47 autochthonous cases
and 106 autochthonous seropositives among 5,442 dogs
(2.1%) from 16 foci of six regions [114]. Four vector species were identified among 1,696 Phlebotomus (Larroussius) specimens collected which indicates that P.
perniciosus and P. neglectus have increased in density and
expanded their geographic range in the study area [112].
These findings demonstrate that northern continental
Italy is now focally endemic for visceral leishmaniasis and
that a moderate risk for human disease does exist there.
However, the intensity of transmission seems to be lower
than in traditional settings of Mediterranean visceral
leishmaniasis.
Malaria
Malaria is common in Southeast Asia and the problem is
particularly pronounced in the border regions between
countries with limited health resource, where poor sanitary conditions prevail and multi-drug resistant parasites
are found [115-117]. The Yunnan province, located adjacent to Vietnam, Laos and the Mandalay area, has the
highest number of malaria cases in China and is ranked
second with regard to incidence of the disease. A spatiotemporal analysis of the epidemic situation from 1999–
2005 in Yunnan found significant clustering. The
researchers found that the lowest incidence rate of malaria
due to Plasmodium falciparum occurred in 2000 and that of
P. vivax malaria in 2001. The highest incidence rate of
malaria in general occurred in 2003 when it increased
considerably, particularly malaria due to P. falciparum

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/10

which has increased by more than 100%. The incidence
has fluctuated during the past seven years but the proportions of P. vivax malaria and P. falciparum malaria held
steady at 73% and 22%, respectively. The malaria season
mainly occurs from May to August and from October to
November. The fastigium is in July and November and the
low point in September and February. The first fastigium
for P. falciparum malaria is in June, which is one month
earlier than for P. vivax malaria.
In China, the Huaihe River valley is an endemic area with
substantial increase in recent years. The source of the
infection and the vector are particularly difficult to control
due to various reasons and social factors related to the epidemic [118]. Zhigui Xia found that the ratio of using
door-window screen, bednet and repellent sprays (β = 2.13, -1.15, -1.03, respectively, P < 0.05) had a negative
correlation to the natural logarithm rate (LnY), while the
rate of sleeping or chatting outdoors (β = 0.89, P < 0.01)
had positive LnY correlation.
Lymphatic filariasis
Lymphatic filariasis remains an important parasitic disease in some countries in Southeast Asia [119] even if it
has recently been deemed eliminated in China [120].
Although most of Cambodia is free from the disease, Lek
Dysoley reported that filariasis is still prevalent in four
northern provinces (Rattana Kiri, Stung Trenga, Preah
Vihear, Siem Reap) [121].

In Indonesia, on the other hand, a survey conducted in
2005 showed the disease is widespread and epidemic. A
study of 1,250 individuals from seven villages of Banggai
district and 437 individuals from two villages of ParigiMoutong district examined using finger prick night blood
survey, showed filariasis to be endemic in three villages.
Two carriers of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaria were
detected in two of them (Dongin and Bone Bae) on the
coastal area of the Banggai district. Microfilaria of Brugia
malayi was found in 28 individuals in one village (Pangku-Tolole) of the Parigi-Moutong district and the geometric mean of microfilarial density was 6.97 mf/mm3
and 23.71 mf/20 mm3 in male and female, respectively.
The highest densities of microfilaria were observed in the
10–39 year olds. This notwithstanding, the highest mf

density (181 mf/20 mm3) was found in a 50-year-old
woman. B. malayi in the Parigi-Moutong district was
found to be nocturnally periodic in principle, but a small
number of mf were also detected in the day blood of two
of five mf carriers who were examined for periodicity
[122,123].
An investigation on vector distribution and biology, conducted in Pangku-Tolole village, Parigi-Moutong districts,
province of central Sulawesi, Indonesia, collected An. barbirostris, An. flavirostris, An. vagus, Ae. vexans, Culex vishnui,
Cx. gelidus, Cx. bitaeniorhynchus and Mansonia uniformis,
but only An. barbirostris was found to be infected with an
infection rate of approximately 10% [124]. Although the
microfilaria prevalence was 13.5% in this village with 207
residents, 37.5% reported a history of acute filarial attacks
and two individuals presented with severe elephantiasis.
More than 10% of the 123 households in Pangku-Tolole
were included in a risk factors survey. The result showed
that poor knowledge and outdoor activity at night were
associated with filarial infection. Additionally, the environmental condition and poor sanitary facilities in this
area facilitates vectors to breed [125].

Conclusion
The 1st International Symposium on Geospatial Health
presents new evidence that spatially-explicit analyses and
other geospatial approaches with an emphasis on human
health are already widely applied across Southeast Asia.
Indeed, in some cases, tools and methodologies have
been further developed and refined on site for specific
purposes. The key findings have been summarized here
not only to emphasize advances made but also to identify
current research priorities. Applications presented and
discussed at this symposium range from soil-transmitted
to food-borne and water-borne helminthic infections in
addition to lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis and
malaria. As a matter of course, the seriousness of these
infections varies from country to country but, taken
together, their impact in Southeast Asia is substantial, yet
seriously underestimated and often neglected.
Technical progress in the field of GIS and RS techniques,
including geospatial statistics, has provided a new epidemiological approach which is particularly well suited to
the study of climate change and ecological transformations. For example, time series analyses, advanced modeling and Bayesian geostatistics are widely employed to
deepen our understanding of the epidemiology and control of schistosomiasis, including the use of random-effect
models and transmission dynamics. Convincing data
were presented showing that schistosomiasis may
progress further north in a warmer future China. For these
kinds of investigations, in particular, the geospatial tools
can provide early-warning techniques for preemptive

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/2/1/10

planning in order to mitigate future risk and impact. We
now have an essentially full understanding of infectious
agents and their life cycles. Ambient temperatures strongly
influence the distribution of the parasitic, infectious
agents, the intermediate hosts and vectors involved, and
their interaction. However, as underlined by many communications given during the symposium, there are also
many other important, remotely-sensed variables that are
highly useful to follow in order to produce fully animated
illustrations how these infections wax and wane.
It is of particular interest that there is now a strong focus
on monitoring the effects due to large-scale ecological and
demographic transformations in connection with the
Three Gorges Dam completed in 2009, and the South-toNorth Water Transfer Project under construction currently. China clearly needs the provision of electricity and
water, but it must also deal with the potentially far-reaching consequences, e.g. epidemic spread of certain diseases,
which may well accompany these large-scale water
resources development and management projects. Work
presented at the symposium supports the notion that the
progress of remotely-sensed environmental data and
advanced mathematical modeling in a spatially-explicit
framework is making it possible to keep abreast of the
demographic, eco-epidemiological and socio-economic
changes that may arise and also highlights the need to
develop early-warning systems without delay.
Many investigations in the areas of geostatistics, visualization and modelling of disease transmission were presented in the form of mathematical models based on
multi-disciplinary principles. In order to efficiently
improve the accuracy of prediction and simulation under
a host of different scenarios, assessment of prediction and
models should be explored further to enhance our understanding of control strategies and rigorous monitoring of
interventions. It is recommended that research priorities
within the field of geospatial health focus on the development of advanced spatial analytical tools to promote their
application in human public health and veterinary medicine.
