Abstract
Background: Extensive DNA rearrangement of genic colinearity, as revealed by comparison of orthologous
genomic regions, has been shown to be a general concept describing evolutionary dynamics of plant genomes.
However, the nature, timing, lineages and adaptation of local genomic rearrangement in closely related species (e.
g., within a genus) and haplotype variation of genomic rearrangement within populations have not been well
documented.
Results: We previously identified a hotspot for genic rearrangement and transposon accumulation in the Orp
region of Asian rice (Oryza sativa, AA) by comparison with its orthologous region in sorghum. Here, we report the
comparative analysis of this region with its orthologous regions in the wild progenitor species (O. nivara, AA) of
Asian rice and African rice (O. glaberrima) using the BB genome Oryza species (O. punctata) as an outgroup, and
investigation of transposon insertion sites and a segmental inversion event in the AA genomes at the population
level. We found that Orp region was primarily and recently expanded in the Asian rice species O. sativa and O.
nivara. LTR-retrotransposons shared by the three AA-genomic regions have been fixed in all the 94 varieties that
represent different populations of the AA-genome species/subspecies, indicating their adaptive role in genome
differentiation. However, LTR-retrotransposons unique to either O. nivara or O. sativa regions exhibited dramatic
haplotype variation regarding their presence or absence between or within populations/subpopulations.
Conclusions: The LTR-retrotransposon insertion hotspot in the Orp region was formed recently, independently and
concurrently in different AA-genome species, and that the genic rearrangements detected in different species
appear to be differentially triggered by transposable elements. This region is located near the end of the short arm
of chromosome 8 and contains a high proportion of LTR-retrotransposons similar to observed in the centromeric
region of this same chromosome, and thus may represent a genomic region that has recently switched from
euchromatic to heterochromatic states. The haplotype variation of LTR-retrotransposon insertions within this region
reveals substantial admixture among various subpopulations as established by molecular markers at the whole
genome level, and can be used to develop retrotransposon junction markers for simple and rapid classification of
O. sativa germplasm.

Background
Comparative genetic mapping and comparison of orthologous genomic sequences of grasses, such as rice, maize,
sorghum, barley, wheat, and millet have demonstrated
extensive genomic colinearity among species that radiated
from common ancestors ~10-60 million years ago [1,2].
Although numerous and different levels of genomic rearrangements, including gene movement, and loss or creation of new genes were uncovered in some grass lineages
[3-5], gene content has been shown to be highly conserved
between species. For instance, all genes, including singlecopy ones, absent in the genomic region surrounding the
orange pericarp (Orp) gene of rice, in contrast to its orthologous regions of sorghum and maize, were found elsewhere in the rice genome and even in Arabidopsis [3,6].
Comparison of homoeologous segments of maize revealed
exceptionally high-level of loss of one of the homoeologous gene pairs [3,5-7], which appears to be a general phenomenon in the evolution of any polyploid organism
toward a diploid genomic state. These dynamic processes
of gene duplication and deletion may explain why rice and
Arabidopsis share a similar set of genes, although their
genomes have undergone separate paleopolyploidy and/or
segmental duplication events during their ~120 million
year independent evolution [8].
In contrast to genes, intergenic spaces were found to be
less or not conserved between grasses, such as maize and
sorghum. Intergenic sequences are generally composed
of transposable elements or transposable element fragments, primarily long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, and other unknown DNA components. Given
that most structurally detectable LTR-retrotransposons
were amplified within last a few million years [9,10], it is
not surprising that substantial differences in intergenic
regions have been found between subspecies of rice [11],
or even between inbreds of maize [12,13]. On the other
hand, LTR-retrotransposons can be partially or completely deleted from the host genomes within very short
evolutionary timeframes. For example, it was estimated
that ~200 Mb of LTR-retrotransposon DNA was
removed from the rice genome by unequal homologous
recombination and illegitimate recombination within the
past 5 million years [9,10], although neither amplification
nor removal of LTR-retrotransposons seems to be absolutely gradual processes [14]. In addition to the gain and
loss of transposable elements, intergenic sequences generally diverge more rapidly than genic sequences by
nucleotide substitution [10,15]. These dynamic processes
have led to the scarcity of conserved intergenic
sequences, even between moderately diverged grass
lineages such as maize and sorghum [6,16].
Comparison of closely related species, subspecies, and/
or different haplotypes or ecotypes is a promising
approach to investigate more recent evolutionary events.

A comparative sequence analysis of ~1.1 Mb orthologous regions of two subspecies of rice, indica and japonica, revealed more than 2% and 6% growth of two
respective genomes over the past half million years, primarily by amplification of LTR-retrotransposons [10].
Wang and Dooner presented a comprehensive comparison of seven inbred lines of maize, demonstrating the
remarkable haplotype variation of the bz genomic
regions caused predominantly by insertion of LTR-retrotransposons, helitrons, DNA transposons and other new
repetitive components [17]. However, the dynamic variation of transposable elements, their potential interplay
with genic rearrangement, and their roles for genomic
selection and diversity remain to be investigated, particularly, at the population level.
The high-quality genomic sequence of rice [18] and
genomic resources (e.g., BAC libraries, BAC end
sequences, BAC-based physical maps) generated by the
ongoing Oryza map alignment project (OMAP) [19] provide an unprecedented opportunity for research community to study the evolution of plant genomes within a
genus. To date, three genomic (Adh1, MOC1, and Hd1)
regions of multiple Oryza species have been investigated
[20-22]. Because the Oryza species included in OMAP
span evolutionary scales from < 1 million years to ~15
million years, as indicated by their phylogeny [23], comparisons of multiple Oryza species in these regions have
uncovered some specific evolutionary events in specific
lineages during the radiation of the Oryza species. However, all three regions are gene-rich and repeat-poor,
therefore little is known about how transposable elements have affected the instability of the Oryza genomes
during their speciation and diversification.
A hotspot of transposable element accumulation that
harbors a few truncated and duplicated gene fragments
was previously described between two gene clusters of
the Orp region of rice (O. sativa ssp. japonica). This
hotspot is located near the end of the short arm of
chromosome 8 (from 1757 to 1997 kb, rice Pseudomolecule 4.0), and contains a high proportion of LTR-retrotransposons, similar to that observed in the centromeric
region (Cen8) of this same chromosome [6,24], but it is
absent in the corresponding regions of sorghum and
maize [6]. To track the evolutionary history of the formation of this hotspot and the spectrum of genic rearrangements involved, we identified its orthologous
regions from AA-, BB-, EE-, and FF-genome Oryza species by searching the O. sativa Orp region against BAC
end sequences (BESs) generated by OMAP. In particular, we sequenced two overlapping BAC clones from O.
nivara (AA), one of the proposed wild progenitors of
Asian rice (O. sativa), one BAC clone from O. glaberrima (AA), the cultivated rice species domesticated in
African, and one BAC clone from O. punctata (BB). In

addition, we investigated the haplotype variation of
LTR-retrotransposon insertions and an inversion of a
genomic segment within the hotspot. We present here
the comparative genomic analysis of these orthologous
regions and haplotype variation mediated by LTR-retrotransposons, thereby depicting the nature, timing, rate
and specificity of DNA changes observed in these
regions during the speciation and diversification of these
closely related Oryza species.

To select the genomic segments that are orthologous to
the O. sativa Orp regions in other Oryza species, we
searched a set of BAC end sequences (BESs) derived
from the O. nivara, O. glaberrima, O. punctata, O. australiensis, and O. brachyantha genomes (OMAP, http://
www.omap.org, Figure 1A). Individual BAC clones with
two BESs anchored to the unique sequences of the O.
sativa Orp region and/or its flanking regions in opposite
orientations were considered to be orthologous segments. One or two overlapping BAC clones from each
species that maximally cover the hotspot of insertions of
transposable elements in the Oryza Orp region [6] were
chosen for sequencing and/or further analysis. BAC
clones OR_BBa0014L06 from O. nivara, two overlapping
clones OG_BBa0075G14 and OGBBa0001L21 from O.
glaberrima, and clone OP__Ba0008J05 from O. punctata
were completely sequenced. These sequenced genomic
segments are 214 kb, 190 kb, and 192 kb in O. nivara,
O. glaberrima, and O. punctata, respectively, corresponding to 202 kb, 309 kb, and 339 kb of the orthologous regions in O. sativa (Table 1). Thus, a 12-kb
expansion of the O. nivara region and 119-kb and 147kb contractions of the O. glaberrima and O. punctata
regions relative to the corresponding orthologous
regions in O. sativa were revealed. In addition, 212-kb
and 192-kb contractions of the O. australiensis and O.
brachyantha regions relative to the corresponding O.
sativa orthologous regions (Table 1) were suggested by
fingerprinting of BAC clones OA_ABa0108F22 and
OB__Ba0050L03 (OMAP, http://www.omap.org) that
define the orthologous Orp regions in O. australiensis
and O. brachyantha, respectively (Figure 1B). The relative contraction of the Orp region in sorghum in contrast to the Orp region in O. sativa is 175 kb (Table 1),
and no transposable elements were identified in the sorghum region [6]. These observations, together with the
evolutionary relationship of these species as illustrated
in Figure 1A, suggest that the Orp region was primarily
and recently expanded in the Asian rice species O.
sativa and O. nivara [i.e., after the divergence of Asian
and African rice approximately 1.2 million years ago

O. australiensis and O. brachyantha were not further
investigated.

file 1, Table S1.
The 214-kb O. nivara region is comprised of 21 LTRretrotransposons, 3 DNA transposons, 3 Helitrons, and
6 genes/pseudogenes. LTR-retrotransposons alone make
up 121 kb of DNA sequence, accounting for 56.6% of
the region. Although the O. nivara region is only 12 kb
larger than its corresponding orthologous region in

O. sativa, it was found that 12 LTR-retrotransposons
(74 kb of DNA) in the former and 9 LTR-retrotransposons (55 kb of DNA) in the latter, were not shared in
the two regions. Each of these unshared elements is
flanked by 5-bp target site duplication in its host region
with a single copy of the 5-bp “target site” in the other
orthologous region, suggesting that these elements
inserted into the current positions after the divergence

of the two regions from their ancestral form. By contrast, all of the 3 DNA transposons and 3 Helitrons are
shared in the two regions, suggesting that they were
integrated before the divergence of the two regions.
Overall, these two regions exhibit perfect colinearity in
gene order and orientation, although gene 11.2 in O.
nivara and gene 12.2 in O. sativa each had a LTR-retrotransposon insertion (Figure 2).
The 190-kb O. glaberrima region is comprised of 7
LTR-retrotransposons, 1 DNA transposon and 2 Helitrons. Nine out of these 10 transposable elements are
shared by O. glaberrima and O. sativa, indicating that
the O. glaberrima region did not expand substantially by
the amplification of LTR-retrotransposons after its
divergence from the O. sativa lineage. In addition to
indels (insertions/deletions) generated by insertions of 2
DNA transposons (T1 and T2) and 8 LTR-retrotransposons (R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R17, and R18), and
by the formation of a solo LTR (R2) through unequal
recombination [26] in O. glaberrima, 5 relatively large
indels (> 3 kb), ID-1, ID-2, ID-3, ID-4 and ID-5 (Figure
2) were observed between the two regions. Among these
5 indels, ID-2 is the largest (37 kb) and harbors 3 DNA
transposons, 1 Helitron, and 3 LTR-retrotransposons
present in O. sativa. Genes 12.3 and b.2 involved in ID4 were present in O. sativa but absent in O. glaberrima.
ID-5 appears to be a (4.3 kb) deletion that led to partial
truncation of gene a1 and removal of a DNA transposon
(4.3 kb) fragment in O. glaberrima. This deletion flanks
the inverted segment in the O. glaberrima region that
harbors genes 11.2, b1 and 12.2. The other breakpoint
for this inversion is located within LTR-retrotransposon
R16 (belonging to family Osr14 [27,28]) and as a result
R16 was separated into two fragments (R16.1 and
R16.2). Interestingly, a deletion of ~4.3 kb internal
sequence of R16 at this breakpoint was deduced by
comparing R16.1 and R16.2 with typical intact elements
of the Osr14 family [27,28]. It is unclear whether the
inversion led to the two flanking deletions or the latter
caused the former. The O. glaberrima and O. sativa
regions show overall colinearity except for the genic
rearrangements described above.
The 148-kb O. punctata region has a single LTR-retrotransposon (R33), which is not shared by the three Agenome species. Based on the divergence of two LTRs
of R33, it was estimated that this element was integrated
into the region ~0.038 mya. This region shares perfect
colinearity at the two gene clusters (i.e., genes 5, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, and genes 14, 20, 19, 18, 17, 21) with the Agenome species, with the exception of a recent quaduplication of a segment containing two gene fragments
(genes 11.2 and 12.2), which resulted in a substantial
size increase of the interval between the two gene clusters in O. punctata.

The nature and history of genic rearrangements

Most duplicated genes interspersed in the intervals of
the two highly conserved gene clusters are pseudogenes
or gene fragments, in which the protein-coding
sequences cannot be accurately predicted. Thus, the
gene duplication events observed in this study could not
be dated based on protein-coding sequences. To illuminate the history of the duplication events, we performed
phylogenetic analysis of the duplicated genes within and
across species using their genomic sequences (Figure 3).
As shown in Figure 3A, gene 11.1 and gene 11.2 from
the three species, O. sativa, O. glaberrima, and O. punctata, were grouped into two distinct branches (i.e., gene
11.1 branch and gene 11.2 branch), and the phylogeny
reflected by either branch is consistent with the evolutionary relationship among the three species [23]. These
data suggest that gene 11.1 and gene 11.2 were duplicated before the divergence of AA and BB genome species from a common ancestor. Gene 12.2 (12.2.1, 12.2.2,
12.2.3 and 12.2.4) in O. punctata was largely truncated,
and thus excluded in the phylogenetic analysis. Gene
12.1 in the three species shows a similar phylogenetic
pattern (Figure 3B) as revealed by gene 11.1 and 11.2,

suggesting that the duplication of gene 12.1 and 12.2
also occurred before the divergence of the AA and BB
genomes. The genetic distances between genes 11.1 and
11.2 and between genes 12.1 and 12.2 differ (Figure 3A
and 3B), but the genes 11.1 and 12.1 and genes 11.2 and
12.2 were found to be arranged in the same order and
orientation in the duplicated fragments. Thus, it is most
likely that the duplication of both genes was caused by a
single event.
Genes 12.2 and 12.3 in O. sativa grouped in the same
branch, distinct to the branch of gene 12.1, suggesting
that the duplication of 12.2 and 12.3 occurred after the
first duplication event that predates the divergence of
the AA and BB genomes. Gene b.1 is present in the AA
genome species, but absent in the BB genome and sorghum. If the conserved segments containing genes 11.1
and 12.1 are ancestral copies of genes 11 and 12, the
insertion of gene b (b.1 or b.2) must have occurred after
the first duplication event. Because the three genes in
each of the two gene clusters (a.2, 12.3 and b.2 cluster,
and a.1, 12.2, and b.1 cluster) are arranged in the same
order and orientation, it is likely that these three genes
were duplicated by a single event before the divergence
of the Asian and African AA genomes. The levels of
sequence divergences between genes 12.2 and 12.3 and
between genes a.1 and a.2 in O. sativa are similar
(Figure 3B and 3C), reinforcing this conclusion. Assuming this deduction is correct, the absence of genes 12.3
and b.2 in O. glaberrima must be the outcome of deletion(s) at ID-4 site (Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that gene a (a.1 or a.2)
in O. punctata is nearly equally distinct to genes a.1 and
a.2 in either AA genome species (Figure 3C), suggesting
that the duplication of the gene a (i.e., a.1 and a.2)
occurred near the split of the AA and BB genome species. Thus, the orthologous copy/copies of genes a
between the AA and BB genomes cannot be deduced
based on their sequence similarities. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the four recently amplified copies of
gene 11.2 in O. punctata are orthologous to gene 11.2
in O. sativa and O. nivara (Figure 3A). In comparison
with the proposed two orthologous regions in the AA
genomes, genes 12.3, b.2, b.1 and a.1 were absent in the
BB genome (Figure 2).
According to the analyses above, we propose two evolutionary scenarios regarding genic arrangements and
rearrangements in the Oryza Orp regions. The first scenario, as illustrated in Figure 4A, proposes that the
initial copy of gene a (i.e., a.1) inserted before the divergence of the AA and BB genome, and the initial copy of
gene b (i.e., b.1) inserted only in the AA species after
the AA and BB species divergence. The duplication
event was followed by the duplication of the gene cluster (a.1, 12.2 and b.1) that generated genes a.2, 12.3, and

Page 6 of 12

b.2 in the AA species. Based on this hypothesis, the
absence of genes 12.3, b.2, b.1 and a.1 in the BB genome
can be explained solely by “gain” of these genes in the
Orp regions of the AA species. Of course, it is also possible that the insertions of initial copies of genes a and b
and the subsequent duplication of the gene cluster (a.1,
12.2 and b.1) occurred before the divergence of the AA
and BB species (Figure 4B). In this scenario case, the
absence of genes seen in the BB genome could be
explained by multiple gene deletion events, which is less
parsimonious than the first scenario.
Regardless, our data revealed unusual structural
instability in the Oryza Orp regions, including recent
and rapid accumulation of LTR-retrotransposons and
recent genic rearrangements. These genomic changes
took place within an originally gene-rich euchromatic
chromosome arm, reflecting a general plasticity of the
Oryza genomes under the umbrella of local genic colinearity. Given that the structural variation of genomic
regions can substantially affect chromatin states [29],
frequencies of local recombination [13], and the expression/functionality of genes within or flanking the regions
[30], the genomic plasticity revealed in this region, and
probably many other genomic regions, as a general pattern, may have played a significant role, as proposed by
Ginzburg et al. [31], in the processes of Oryza genome
speciation.
Population analysis of haplotype variation of LTRretrotransposon insertions and segmental inversion in the
AA species

Previous investigation of the bz genomic region in seven
different maize inbred lines revealed remarkable variation in the maize genome, structure mediated by transposable elements [17,32]. Similar to the bz region, the
Orp regions of the three Oryza AA genomes show a
high level of polymorphisms of LTR-retrotransposon
insertions (Figure 2). To further track whether a particular LTR-retrotransposon is present at high frequencies
or fixed within a species/subspecies at population levels,
we investigated the presence or absence of a set of LTRretrotransposons identified in the Orp regions by PCR
amplification of transposon insertion junctions in 95 AA
genome varieties, following a protocol previously
described by Devos et al. [1] (see details in Materials
and Methods). These 95 varieties, including 46 O.
sativa, 20 O. nivara, 24 O. rufipogon and 4 O. glaberrima and 1 O. barthii accessions (Additional file 2,
Table S2) were chosen based on their geographic distribution and genetic diversity estimated by SSR and SNP
markers [33-35]. The results of PCR analysis are illustrated in Figure 5 and Additional file 3, Figure S1. The
primers designed for PCR analysis are listed in Additional file 4, Table S3.

Figure 4 Nature and evolutionary history of genic rearrangements in the Orp regions of Oryza species.

R7 and R15, two representative LTR-retrotransposons
shared by the three AA genomic regions, were detected
in all the 94 AA genome varieties (Figure 5). In other
words, these two insertions were fixed during the evolution and divergence of the AA genome species. It was
estimated that these two elements were inserted
approximately 2.1 and 1.2 million years ago. In general,
LTR-retrotransposons tend to accumulate in low

recombination heterochromatic regions where selection
is expected to be less efficient in removing them [36].
Thus, the fixation of the insertion of these two elements
inserted before the divergence of African and Asian rice
lineages in the “originally” gene-rich Orp region with
high rate of recombination [28] would suggest that
these elements may have played or be playing an adaptive role.

Figure 5 Presence and absence of LTR-retrotransposons in the AA-genome variety populations. (A) Elements investigated by PCR and
their distribution in the three sequenced Orp regions. (B) The presence (red or green) or absence (grey) of individual LTR-retrotransposons
detected by amplification of retrotransposon junctions. Varieties from top to bottom are listed in the same orders as shown in Additional file 2,
Table S2.

We also investigated 11 LTR-retrotransposons that are
not shared among the three sequenced Orp regions,
including 6 (R6, R9, R11, R12, R14, and R19) unique to the
O. sativa region, 4 (R21, R24, R30, and R31) unique to the
O. nivara region, and 1 (R32) unique to the O. glaberrima

region. These elements were relatively young (Additional
file 1, Table S1) with an average age of 0.15 million years.
R32 was found in the four O. glaberrima varieties, but
absent in all Asian AA varieties, suggesting that this
element was inserted into the African AA lineage after

Tian et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/142

its divergence from the Asian AA lineage. R19 was found
in 47 out of the 48 O. sativa varieties, being absent from a
single aromatic/GroupV accession, and it was detected in
16 out of the 20 O. nivara varieties and 20 out of 24 O.
rufipogon varieties. Interestingly, R6, R9, R11, R12 and R14,
which distinguished Nipponbare from O. nivara, were
fixed in the 10 temperate japonica varieties, while R21, R30
and R31, which were present in the sequenced O. nivara
BAC, were completely absent from the temperate japonica
subpopulation (Figure 5). A similar pattern was seen for
R21, R30 and R31 (all absent), and for R6, R9 and R11 (all
present) in the aromatic/GroupV accessions, which are
known to be closely related to temperate japonica at the
genetic level [37]. On the other hand, the tropical japonica
varieties, as a group, were more similar to the indica and
aus varieties across this region, with varying frequencies of
LTRs matching those found in Nipponbare and/or O.
nivara. Interestingly, the indica variety, 9311, which is
known to have japonica parentage, shares a regional haplotye with temperate japonica, as do the two Indonesian tropical japonica varieties, Gotak Gatik and Trembese, while
most of the others in this group carry the O. nivara alleles
at R9, R112, R12 and R14. The indica subpopulation is
almost fixed for the O. nivara allele at R21, and is highly
variable across all other markers. The aus subpopulation is
distinguished from the other O. sativa groups by a higher
frequency of accessions carrying R30 and R31 and the
complete absence of accessions carrying both R12 and R14.
In these ways, aus more closely resembles O. nivara than
other O. sativa varieties across this region. These observations are consistent with previous studies showing an
intense genetic bottleneck in temperate japonica but
greater variation in the indica and aus subgroups [33,38]
and substantial admixture among the various subpopulations, most notably in tropical japonica [35].
Based on the presence/absence of all these LTR-retrotransposons, “phylogenetic relationships” of these varieties were analyzed. As shown in Additional file 5,
Figure S2, the analysis clearly separated the African species, O. glaberrima and O. barthii (the proposed wild
progenitor of O. glaberrima) from the Asian species,
and the indica and aus subpopulations clustered at one
end of the graph along with most of the O. nivara and
some of the O. rufipopgon accessions, well separated
from the majority of aromatic/Group V, temperate and
tropical japonica varieties that clustered with a different
set of O. rufipogon accessions. This analysis further
identifies admixed tropical japonica, indica and aus
varieties that cluster with several O. nivara and O. rufipogon accessions in the middle of the graph. Several
indica varieties are seen clustering with the japonica
group, reflecting the greater genetic variation and mixed
parentage of many indica varieties, as previously noted
for c.v. 9311. Thus, this graphical display reflects the

Page 9 of 12

taxonomy of these species and subspecies as established
by SNP and/or SSR analyses, providing an interesting
window on a highly variable region of the rice genome
[33-35].
Several hypotheses can explain the observed lability of
LTR-retrotransposons. 1) Since the regions are highly
instable and plastic, there may be a high level of lineage
sorting going on in present-day populations derived
from a very diverse set of ancestral haplotypes. Each
descendant population may inherit a large subset of the
ancestral haplotypes, which continue to segregate in the
descendants. In theory, over evolutionary time they
should sort out such that each group has its own distinct haplotype/haplotypes that are more closely related
to each other than to haplotypes from other species.
However, because of the relatively short time that has
elapsed for the speciation of the Asian AA genomes, the
haplotypes of LTR-retrotransposons remain largely
unsorted. 2) The lability can be explained by intra-specific and inter-specific introgression, which may have
occurred during speciation of these genomes [35,39,40].
3) Balancing selection for recent LTR-retrotransposon
insertions may contribute to the high level of insertion
polymorphisms, although adaptive selection and/or
genetic bottlenecks affecting the two relatively old elements, R7 and R15, was suggested. Further investigation
of a larger collection of wild and cultivated germplasm
and more LTR-retrotransposon insertions at a larger
genomic scale would help to reveal the dynamics of
retention and/or removal of LTR-retrotransposons and
their contributions to genomic diversity and speciation.
The inverted segment harboring genes 11.2, b1 and
12.2 in the sequenced O. glaberrima region (Figure 2)
was detected in all other O. glaberrima accessions analyzed by PCR approach, but absent in the O. barthii
accession and all Asian AA-genome Oryza species/subspecies (Figure 5 and Additional file 3, Figure S1). This
suggests that the inversion occurred in African rice after
its divergence from Asian rice. Because only a single O.
barthii accession was included in this analysis, it remains
unclear whether the inversion took place before or after
the domestication of O.glaberrima from O. barthii.
The Orp region is located near the end of the short
arm of rice chromosome 8, but harbors a high proportion of LTR-retrotransposons similar to that observed in
the centromeric region of this same chromosome. Thus,
it is likely that the region has recently switched from
euchromatic to heterochromatic states.

Conclusions
Our data indicate that the Orp genomic complex in rice
cultivars and their wild progenitors have been recently,
independently and concurrently formed from a gene-rich
region by differential insertion of LTR-retrotransposons

Tian et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/142

and genic rearrangement, and that the overall haplotype
variation of LTR-retrotransposon insertions in this region
echoes to the admixture pattern of genomic diversity and
introgression of AA-genome populations/subpopulations
revealed by genome-wide SSR and SNP genotyping, thus
highlighting the evolutionary roles of LTR-retrotransposons in plant speciation and diversification. Genomewide profiling of LTR-retrotransposon insertions among
the AA-genome cultivars at larger population levels
would enhance our understanding of the evolutionary
processes and dynamics of the rice genomes.

Methods
Identification of BAC clones

The entire Orp region of O. sativa and it flanking 150kb sequences from both ends of the region were
searched against the BESs of other Oryza species generated by OMAP [19]. Single BAC clones meeting the following criteria: 1) at least one unique end; 2) both ends
aligned to the extended Orp region of O. sativa in forward/reverse pairs; and 3) both ends spanning 100 to
500 kb of O. sativa sequences, were considered to be
the orthologous segments from the respective Oryza
species. As the major objective of this study was to target the genomic space corresponding to the hotspot of
the transposable element accumulation and genic rearrangement in O. sativa, we only selected and analyzed a
minimum number of clones from Oryza species that
maximally cover the target region, as shown in Figure 1.

searches against the TIGR plant repeat database [44],
GenBank non-redundant protein database, and pack_MULE database [45]. Helitrons were identified using a
perl script described previously [46].
Dating of segmental duplication and retrotransposon
insertions

The alignments of homologous nucleotide sequences
were generated by using ClustalX [47]. The dates of segmental duplication and amplification of LTR-retrotransposons were estimated as described previously [10].
The phylogenetic trees of duplicated genes were constructed based on pair-wise comparison of nucleotide
sequences using the Kimura two-parameter method provided by MEGA4 program [48]. The Neighbor-Joining
tree based on the presence/absence of LTR-retrotransposon insertions were obtained using MEGA4.
The genomic sequences generated in this study has
been deposited in GeneBank (Nos. HM999006HM999008).

geographic distribution and genetic diversity.

BAC Sequencing

Shotgun libraries for selected BAC clones were constructed as described previously [41]. Subclones were
sequenced from both directions using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Chemistry (Applied BioSystems, Foster,
CA) and run on an ABI3730 capillary sequencer. BAC
clones were sequenced at approximately 8-10-fold
redundancies, and then were assembled and finished to
standard high quality sequences (PHASE III) by primer
walking [6]. The assemblies of sequenced BAC clones
were confirmed by restriction map analysis similar to
the method described by Dubcovsky et al. [41].

Sequence annotation

Putative gene models were predicted using the FGENESH program with the monocot training set (http://
www.softberry.com), and were further investigated to
determine whether they are actually genes following
described previously criteria [6]. Truncated gene fragments were identified by sequence homology comparison
using BLAST2 [42], DOTTER [43] and CROSS_MATCH
(http://www.phrap.org). LTR-retrotransposons were
identified and classified as described previously [9]. DNA
transposon fragments were identified by homology
