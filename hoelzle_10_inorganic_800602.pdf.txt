Abstract
Background: Mycoplasma suis belongs to a group of highly specialized hemotrophic bacteria that attach to the
surface of host erythrocytes. Hemotrophic mycoplasmas are uncultivable and the genomes are not sequenced so
far. Therefore, there is a need for the clarification of essential metabolic pathways which could be crucial barriers
for the establishment of an in vitro cultivation system for these veterinary significant bacteria.
Inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPase) are important enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate
PPi to inorganic phosphate Pi. PPases are essential and ubiquitous metal-dependent enzymes providing a thermodynamic pull for many biosynthetic reactions. Here, we describe the identification, recombinant production and
characterization of the soluble (s)PPase of Mycoplasma suis.
Results: Screening of genomic M. suis libraries was used to identify a gene encoding the M. suis inorganic
pyrophosphatase (sPPase). The M. suis sPPase consists of 164 amino acids with a molecular mass of 20 kDa. The
highest identity of 63.7% was found to the M. penetrans sPPase. The typical 13 active site residues as well as the
cation binding signature could be also identified in the M. suis sPPase. The activity of the M. suis enzyme was
strongly dependent on Mg2+ and significantly lower in the presence of Mn2+ and Zn2+. Addition of Ca2+ and EDTA
inhibited the M. suis sPPase activity. These characteristics confirmed the affiliation of the M. suis PPase to family I
soluble PPases. The highest activity was determined at pH 9.0. In M. suis the sPPase builds tetramers of 80 kDa
which were detected by convalescent sera from experimentally M. suis infected pigs.
Conclusion: The identification and characterization of the sPPase of M. suis is an additional step towards the
clarification of the metabolism of hemotrophic mycoplasmas and, thus, important for the establishment of an
in vitro cultivation system. As an antigenic and conserved protein the M. suis sPPase could in future be further
analyzed as a diagnostic antigen.

Background
Mycoplasma suis belongs to a group of highly specialized uncultivable hemotrophic bacteria within the
family Mycoplasmataceae that attach to the surface of
host erythrocytes [1,2]. In the last few years reports on
hemotrophic mycoplasmas in various animal species [1]
as well as in humans [3,4] continuously increased.
Obviously, hemotrophic mycoplasmas are emerging
agents with a zoonotic potential. M. suis causes

infectious anemia in pigs leading to serious economic
loss in the pig industry due to acute anemia as well as
chronic persistent infections with increased susceptibility
to respiratory and enteric diseases [1,5].
Instead of a clear and long-dated clinical significance
of hemotrophic mycoplasmas [6] our knowledge on the
physiology and metabolism of hemotrophic mycoplasmas is rather limited. This can primarily led back to
their unculturability and the lack of sequence data [6].
Probably, M. suis can use glucose as a source of carbon
and energy [7,8]. However, detailed energy requirements
of M. suis are largely unknown and its key enzymes
have not been described so far. In previous studies we

successfully screened genome libraries to identify
M. suis proteins which are involved in pathogenetic processes of M. suis infections (e.g. adhesion) and the
energy metabolism of these rather unexplored pathogens
[9,10]. In this paper we identified the soluble inorganic
pyrophoshatase (sPPase) of M. suis by applying said
strategy. Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is an important
by-product of many biosynthetic processes, and sPPases
which hydrolyze PP i to inorganic phosphate (P i ), are
essential and ubiquitous metal-dependent enzymes providing a thermodynamic pull for many biosynthetic
reactions [11-13]. Soluble PPases belong to two nonhomologous families: family I, widespread in all types of
organisms [14], and family II, so far confined to a limited number of bacteria and archaea [15,16]. The
families differ in many functional properties; for example, Mg2+ is the preferred cofactor for family I sPPases
studied, whereas Mn 2+ confers maximal activity to
family II sPPases [17,18]. Detailed aims of this study
were the recombinant production and characterization
of the M. suis sPPase and the comparison of its properties to those of other bacteria. Characterization of essential enzymes in the metabolism of hemotrophic
mycoplasmas are important steps towards the establishment of an in vitro cultivation system for this group of
hitherto uncultivable hemotrophic bacteria.

Results
Identification of the M. suis inorganic pyrophosphatase
(PPase)

The sPPase of M. suis was identified by screening of
genomic libraries of M. suis using shot gun sequencing.
By means of sequence analysis and database alignments
of 300 randomly selected library clones we identified
library clone ms262 containing an M. suis insert with
highest identity to the gene encoding the M. penetrans
sPPase. Since prokaryotic sPPases are known to be
essential in energy metabolism [11,12] we selected the
ms262 clone for further studies. To confirm the M. suis
authenticity of ms262 Southern blot analyses of M. suis
genomic DNA were performed using two EcoRI ms262
library fragments as probes. The ms262 EcoRI fragments
hybridized with two genomic M. suis fragments of 1.2
and 2.7 kb, respectively (Figure 1A). Detailed sequence
analysis revealed that the clone ms262 contains a 2059bp insert with an average G+C content of 30.11%. Clone
ms262 includes two ORFs (Figure 1B): ORF1 showed
the highest identity with U. parvum thioredoxin trx (significant BLAST score of 1.3 × 10 -7 , overall sequence
identity 44.5%). ORF2 with a length of 495 bp encodes a
164-aa protein with a calculated molecular mass of 18.6
kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.72. The ORF2 matched
best with M. penetrans ppa (63.7% identity). The overall
degrees of identity to the ppa of U. urealyticum,

M. mycoides ssp mycoides, and M. capricolum ssp capricolum were calculated to be 59.7%, 58.7%, and 58.3%,
respectively. Figure 2 shows an alignment of sPPases of
selected Mycoplasma species. The characteristic signature of sPPase which is essential for the binding of
cations was identified at amino acid positions 54 to 60
(Figure 2) using the program PREDICT PROTEIN
http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/. Possible
signatures for sPPases are D[SGDN]D[PE][LIVMF]D
[LIVMGAG]. The signature of the M. suis sPPase was
determined as DGDPLDV (amino acids are underlined
in the universal signature; Figure 2). The 13 conserved
residues which build the active site of sPPases could be
identified in the M. suis sPPase, too (Figure 2).

The entire ORF of the M. suis ppa was assembled as a
synthetic gene and one UGATrp codon at position 274276 was replaced by UGG. Other changes in the synthetic ppa were done to optimize the sequence for the

heterologous E. coli expression. Induction of E. coli
transformants containing the ppa gene resulted in the
high-level expression of a 20 kDa-protein as shown in
Figure 3A. Recombinant PPase was used to raise a
PPase-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum. The specificity of the rabbit serum was demonstrated by probing
an immunoblot containing purified rPPase and a M. suis
preparation. The anti-PPase serum reacted clearly with a
single band of 20 kDa corresponding to the purified
rPPase. In the M. suis preparations a weak band of
20 kDa and a clear band of 80 kDa potentially corresponding to a tetrameric form of the M. suis PPase were
detected (Figure 3B). No reaction could be observed
neither with the blood control preparation of M. suis
negative pigs nor the non-induced E. coli control.

Characterization of PPase in M. suis

In order to prove the conserved existence of the PPase
gene in M. suis, 25 M. suis isolates (20 isolates from
domestic pigs and five isolates from wild boars) were
screened by PCR. All isolates revealed a PCR amplification product of the expected size of approximately 500 bp.
Sequence analysis of ten ppa PCR products revealed 100%
sequence identity with the determined M. suis ppa
sequence (Accession number FN394679).
To determine the antigenicity of the PPase of M. suis
we analyzed convalescent serum pools from experimentally infected pigs by immunoblotting. All convalescent
serum pools reacted clearly with rPPase. No reaction
could be observed with sera taken from M. suis negative
pigs. A representative immunoblot is shown in Figure 3C.

Functional characterization of recombinant M. suis PPase

The dependency of the M. suis PPase activity on the pH
value was determined between pH 5 and 10.5. As shown
in Figure 4D the optimum pH for the M. suis
PPase activity was observed at pH 9.0. At conditions
below pH 7.5 and above pH 10.0 its activity decreased
considerably.
The effect of different Mg 2+ concentrations on the
M. suis PPase activity is shown in Figure 4A. High
enzyme activity was found between 1 and 100 mM Mg2+
with a maximum activity at a concentration of 10 mM
Mg2+. Performing the reaction at a pH of 7.5 the maximum PPase activity was found at a concentration of
50 mM. Using an Mg2+ depleted reaction buffer the M.
suis PPase-mediated PPi hydrolysis was nearly abolished.
Substitution of Mg 2+ cations with Mn 2+ and Zn 2+
resulted in significantly lower activities of 25.34% ±
12.1%, and 14.3% ± 9.5% respectively of the Mg 2+
induced activity (Figure 4B).
To further characterize the M. suis PPase the effect of
inhibitors on the activity was evaluated. Enzymatic activity was inhibited more than 95%, and 70% in the presence of 5 mM Ca 2+ and 5 mM EDTA, respectively
(Figure 4C).

Discussion
In this study, we identified, for the first time, a gene
encoding the sPPase of one representative of the uncultivable hemotrophic mycoplasma group, i.e. M. suis.
PPase plays an important role in the bacterial energy

metabolism [11,12] and is the enzyme responsible for
the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate which is formed principally as the product of many biosynthetic reactions that
utilize ATP. Since our knowledge on the metabolism of
M. suis and other hemotrophic mycoplasmas is rather
limited enzymes associated with their metabolism are of
our special interest.
The M. suis ORF encoding the sPPase showed a typically low G+C content of 30.11% which lies within the
normal range of other mycoplasmas [19,20]. The identified M. suis sPPase signature sequence which is responsible for the cation binding was identical to those of
M. mycoides ssp mycoides and M. capricolum ssp capricolum. Furthermore, all functionally important active
site residues could be identified in the M. suis sPPase.
Interestingly, the M. suis sPPase is considerably shorter
than other mycoplasma sPPases (164 vs. 180-185 amino
acid residues) due to differences in the C-terminal
region. State-of-the-art knowledge on the uncultivable
hemotrophic mycoplasmas does not allow for a statement as to which function the absence of amino acid
residues on the C-terminus might incur. There could be
a possible relevance for its subcellular localization. Additionally, the ms262 clone harbors a second ORF encoding a putative M. suis thioredoxin. The thioredoxin
system operates via redox-active disulphides and provides electrons for a wide range of metabolic processes
in prokaryotic cells. Especially within the genus Mycoplasma the thioredoxin complex apparently belongs to
the metabolic core reactions [21,22]. Comparison of the

genome structures flanking the ppa ORF with the
sequenced Mycoplasma species revealed no homologies
(data not shown).
After heterologous expression of the sPPase in E. coli
the protein was found in the cytoplasm with a molecular
weight of 20 kDa. In M. suis whole cell preparations the
sPPase was detected as a 20 kDa band to a minor
degree. Predominantly the enzyme was found to have a
molecular weight of approx. 80 kDa indicating that the
M. suis sPPase obviously consists of four subunits. Since
the inference that the M. suis sPPase is tetrameric is
solely based on the results of an immunoblot using antirPPase antibodies (Fig 3B) the final proof of the tetrameric form has to be provided as soon as an in vitro
cultivation of M. suis is possible. For other Mycoplasmas
nothing is known about the protein properties of sPPase
since they have only been identified via their DNA
sequences. However, other studies report that most
eubacterial PPases are homohexamers [23,24], and, as is
unusual, sometimes homotetramers e.g. Aquifex aeolicus
[25,26] or Rhodospirillum rubrum [27]. Where molecular phylogeny is concerned the Mycoplasma sPPases are
clustered with the cyanobacteria within the prokaryotic
Family I PPase lineage [27]. The M. suis sPPase showed
characteristic properties in terms of cation requirement:
Mg 2+ confers the highest efficiency in activating the
M. suis sPPase in a concentration-dependent manner.
Other cations (Zn2+ and Mn2+) could replace Mg2+, but
the effectiveness of the latter cations was significantly
lower. Furthermore, Ca 2+ and EDTA inhibited the
enzyme for catalysis. These results support the conclusion that the M.suis sPPase belongs to the Family I
PPases. Family I PPase has shown strong metal cationdependency, with Mg2+ conferring the highest efficiency
[14] and sensitivity to inhibition by Ca 2+ [28]. In contrast, Family II PPase prefers Mn2+ over Mg2+ [17]. The
most notable characteristic of the M. suis recombinant
sPPase was its pH activity profile with an optimum at
pH 9.0 since (i) optimal pH of most bacterial sPPases
ranged from pH 5.0 to 8.0 [25], and (ii) the physiological
blood pH value of pigs is 7.4 ± 0.4. Therefore, it is
ambiguous which role the unusual pH optimum could
play with regard to the pathogenesis of M. suis induced
diseases. Moreover, no statement is possible about optimal pH ranges for other mycoplasmal sPPases since this
study is the first functional characterization of a sPPase
of a Mycoplasma species. For M. suis it is known that
experimental induced acute diseases lead to severe
hypoglycemia and blood acidosis with a mean pH value
of 7.13 [29]. All these changes were considered to result
from the high glucose consumption of M. suis during
maximum bacteremia [1]. However, nothing is known
about the changes in blood parameters during natural
M. suis infections and especially during the chronic

Hoelzle et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:194
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/194

course of persistent infections with nearly physiological
glucose metabolism. It has been reported from other
infections, e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae-infections in
rats that infections could lead to significantly increased
blood pH values [30].
Notably, infected pigs showed antibodies against
recombinant sPPase. This may result from the sPPase
being an ectoenzyme which might be located on the
external surface. Alternatively, anti-Ms PPAse antibodies
could be an outcome of bacterial lysis in the animal host.
The first possibility is rather unlikely since no signal peptide was found in any Mycoplasma PPase and all other
Familiy I PPases are clearly soluble and not secreted [27].
Probably sPPase could be one of the eight M. suis specific
antigens which we have described recently [9].

Conclusion
By using a screening of genomic libraries of uncultivable
bacteria M. suis we were able to identify so far unknown
components of the energy metabolism. We identified and
characterized the inorganic pyrophosphatase of M. suis.
Knowing the functional characteristics of such an essential enzyme may help to establish an in vitro cultivation
system for hemotrophic mycoplasmas. Furthermore, as
an antigenic and conserved protein M. suis sPPase could
in future be further analyzed as a diagnostic antigen.
Methods
Bacterial strains and isolates, plasmids, and experimental
porcine sera

M. suis cells were obtained from experimentally infected
pigs as previously described [31,32]. E. coli K12 strains
were Top10 and LMG194 (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). For DNA manipulation and protein expression
the plasmids pUC19 (Roche-Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and pBadMycHis (C-terminal His- and Myc-tag,
Invitrogen) were used. Experimental sera and M. suis
isolates were available from previous studies [33,34].
DNA extraction, library construction and sequence
analysis

DNA extraction of M. suis was performed as previously
described [31]. Customized DNA library construction
was performed by Medigenomix (Martinsried, Germany). M. suis DNA fragments averaging from 1.5 kb to
3.0 kb were ligated into the pUC19 vector. In order to
detect M. suis sequences 300 clones were randomly
selected for DNA-sequencing. Customized sequencing
was performed by Medigenomix. Nucleotide sequences
were analyzed by using the FASTA aligorithm (Biocomputing service, University Zurich, http://www.bio.unizh.
ch. For determination of putative open reading frames
we used an ORF finder program http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/projects/gorf/. Translation of ORFs to amino

acid sequences was performed by taking into account
the alternative genetic codon usage of mollicutes (UGA
encodes tryptophan instead of stop).
Hybridization analysis

Hybridization was performed as previously described
[31]. Briefly, M. suis genomic DNA was digested with
EcoRI, analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to
Hybond-N nylon membranes by capillary transfer using
1.5 M NaCl, 0.25 M NaOH as transfer buffer. The ppacontaining library clone ms262 was digested with the
restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI. Due to an internal EcoRI digestion site the insert was divided into two
fragments of approx. 1200 bp and 800 bp. Both fragments were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP (RocheDiagnostics) and used as probes.
Cloning, expression of M. suis ppa and purification
of the recombinant enzyme

To account for the Mycoplasma specific use of the UGA
codon as tryptophan the ppa sequence was adapted to
the codon usage of E. coli and de novo synthesized
(Medigenomix). The de novo ppa was ligated into the
pBadMycHis vector (pBad-ppa) and transformed into
E. coli LMG194.
Recombinant pBad-ppa E. coli clones were grown to
an OD 600 nm of 0.6 at 37°C. Protein expression was
induced by the addition of 0.02% arabinose. E. coli cultures were further incubated for 2 h at 37°C. His-tagged
proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography
(Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) as previously
described [9,10]. The purification of 2 liter culture
yielded a total of 1 mg recombinant protein. Purity of
protein was estimated as 90%. Non-induced cultures
were prepared accordingly as controls for immunoblots
and enzyme activity assays.
Enzyme activity assay

Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (BioRad, Reinach, Switzerland) using bovine serum
albumin as a standard. The recombinant M. suis sPPase
activity was assayed as described by Saheki and coworkers [35] using a reaction mixture containing 5 mM
Mg2+, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and 1 mM PPi (Na4P2O7)
at 55°C in a final volume of 200 μl. Reactions were
started by adding 10 μL diluted M. suis rPPase (100 ng)
and stopped by adding 1 ml 200 mM Glycin/HCl, pH 3.0.
Then, 125 μl of 1% ammonium molybdate (in 25 mM
H2SO4) and 125 μl of 1% ascorbic acid (in 0.05% KHSO4)
were added to the mixtures and incubated for 30 min at
37°C. Yeast sPPase (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) was used
as positive control. Preparations derived from non-induced
pBad-ppa (purified accordingly to recombinant PPase)
were used as negative controls. To determine the Mg2+

and pH dependency individual assay components were varied. Activity was also measured using 5 mM Mn2+, Zn2+
instead of Mg2+ cations. For inhibition assays 5 mM Ca2+
and EDTA, respectively, were added to the reaction mixture. The amount of Pi liberated from the hydrolysis of PPi
was measured using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 160UV-A) and a standard Pi curve. The PPase activity was
defined as μmol Pi min-1 mg-1 protein.
Preparation of an anti-PPase rabbit immune serum

A rabbit immune serum was prepared as previously
described [10] using 0.4 mg recombinant PPase for each
immunization. Immunizations were conducted under the
registration number 156/2002 with the legal prescriptions.

SDS PAGE and immunoblots

SDS PAGE and immunoblots were performed according to standard protocols. The M. suis cells were prepared from the blood of experimentally infected pigs
as previously described [32]. Negative controls were
accordingly prepared from the blood of M. suisnegative pigs.

PCR and sequencing

13.

PCR amplification of the ppa gene was performed using the
primers: ppa_for: ATGTCAAAAAATAATATAGTGGA;
ppa_rev TTAATAATTTGATTGTTATTCTCC, and the
HotStarTaq Polymerase Master Mix (Qiagen). PCR conditions were: 15 min at 95°C for activation of Taq polymerase,
30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C
for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min. Amplified fragments were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced (Medigenomix).
The ppa sequence was deposited in the EMBL
Nucleotide Sequence Database under accession number
FN394679.
