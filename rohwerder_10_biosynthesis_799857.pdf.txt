Biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA)
from renewable carbon
Thore Rohwerder*, Roland H Müller

Abstract
Nowadays a growing demand for green chemicals and cleantech solutions is motivating the industry to strive for biobased building blocks. We have identified the tertiary carbon atom-containing 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA) as an
interesting building block for polymer synthesis. Starting from this carboxylic acid, practically all compounds possessing the isobutane structure are accessible by simple chemical conversions, e. g. the commodity methacrylic acid as
well as isobutylene glycol and oxide. During recent years, biotechnological routes to 2-HIBA acid have been proposed
and significant progress in elucidating the underlying biochemistry has been made. Besides biohydrolysis and biooxidation, now a bioisomerization reaction can be employed, converting the common metabolite 3-hydroxybutyric acid
to 2-HIBA by a novel cobalamin-dependent CoA-carbonyl mutase. The latter reaction has recently been discovered in
the course of elucidating the degradation pathway of the groundwater pollutant methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in
the new bacterial species Aquincola tertiaricarbonis. This discovery opens the ground for developing a completely biotechnological process for producing 2-HIBA. The mutase enzyme has to be active in a suitable biological system producing 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, which is the precursor of the well-known bacterial bioplastic polyhydroxybutyrate
(PHB). This connection to the PHB metabolism is a great advantage as its underlying biochemistry and physiology is
well understood and can easily be adopted towards producing 2-HIBA. This review highlights the potential of these
discoveries for a large-scale 2-HIBA biosynthesis from renewable carbon, replacing conventional chemistry as synthesis route and petrochemicals as carbon source.
Background
Building-block chemical 2-HIBA

In the future, the feedstock for the chemical industry will
not any longer be delivered from petroleum but will
depend on renewable biomass. This does not mean that
materials currently produced by the industry will be
replaced by totally new ones. However, synthesis routes of
the chemical industry often differ from the pathways that
are found in biology. While chemistry produces polymers
and other materials origin mainly from petroleum-based
hydrocarbons, biological systems normally feed on carbohydrates, alcohols or other renewable carbon which are
already at a highly oxidized state. Accordingly, the central
intermediates from which all other compounds are synthesized, the building-block chemicals, are not the same in
chemical and biological systems. However, this situation
will change when the resource base for chemical production is shifted from fossil feedstock to renewable carbon

[1,2]. A good example is 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid
(2-HIBA) whose chemistry and biochemistry also differ
significantly. This tertiary carbon atom-containing C4 carboxylic acid is currently not a high-volume product of the
chemical industry but only a specialty chemical. It is used
to some extend as a pharmaceutical intermediate and also
as a complex-forming agent for lanthanide and actinide
heavy metals [3]. In the future, however, it could be used
as a building-block chemical for many polymer precursors
bearing the isobutane carbon skeleton (Figure 1). All
these chemicals are mainly used for polymer production.
Above all, the methyl ester of methacrylic acid, which can
be synthesized by dehydration of 2-HIBA or via the corresponding amide, is polymerized to polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA) for the production of acrylic glass, durable coatings and inks [4,5]. For this compound alone, the market
exceeds 3 million tons. Other branched C4 carboxylic
acids, e. g. chloro and amino derivatives of 2-HIBA [6-9],
as well as isobutylene glycol and its oxide are also used
in polymers and for many other applications [10-13]. In
addition, by analogy with lactide from lactic acid, the

easily be formed for further polymerization [14,15].
Lack of a suitable metabolism

Currently, polymer precursors having the isobutane
structure are synthesized from petroleum-derived C2 to
C4 hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, acetone, isobutane
and isobutylene, but not from renewable biomass. Biology, on the other hand, prefers to synthesize carboxylic
acid from biobased carbon rather than to reduce it to
hydrocarbons. In line with this, it has been predicted that
several organic acids, such as 3-hydroxypropionic and
succinic acid, will be important building-block chemicals
when industrial production will shift from petroleumbased chemistry to biotechnology from renewable carbon
[1,16]. Although large-scale production of the organic
acid building-blocks has not yet been established, their
high market potential has fueled significant efforts to do
so. In most cases, the underlying biochemistry is well

understood and has been known for decades. In contrast,
research on the conversion or synthesis of 2-HIBA by
microorganisms or other biological systems has not
attracted much attention as it is rarely found in nature
and is not part of the main metabolic pathways.
Obviously due to the lack of a suitable metabolism, a biobased 2-HIBA has not been predicted to be an important
building-block organic acid [1], although it is known that
many high-volume polymer chemicals can easily be
synthesized from it (Figure 1). Until recently, only the
biohydrolysis of acetone cyanohydrin as a partially biotechnological route to 2-HIBA has been proposed [17],
but convincing approaches depending on renewable carbon were not available.
MTBE: driver for the evolution of novel enzymes?

In the last years, significant progress on elucidating
2-HIBA metabolism has been made when research
focused on the environmental fate of the fuel oxygenate

methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) since 2-HIBA has been
identified as an intermediate in its biodegradation pathway [18]. MTBE is an ether compound formally derived
from the alcohols methanol and tert-butanol. In practice, it is produced by reacting methanol with isobutylene. Hence, the ether bears a tert-butyl residue that
belongs to the group of chemicals with an isobutanelike structure (Figure 1). MTBE is used to some extent
as a cheap organic solvent. However, its rise to a mass
product of the chemical industry started in the late
1970s as a gasoline additive [19]. At the beginning, only
small amounts, comprising less than 1% of the gasoline,
were added for raising the octane number. Then, its use
steadily increased to about 5 to 15% as a so-called fuel
oxygenate for optimizing combustion. Today, the market
for MTBE and related fuel oxygenates exceeds 20 million tons. While these compounds help to reduce CO
emission, they also tend to easily pollute groundwater
when gasoline is spilled or leaked at gas stations. MTBE
turned out to be quite recalcitrant against biodegradation, likely due to the xenobiotic character of the tertbutyl residue [20].
Now, after more then a decade of intensive research, a
few bacterial strains are known capable of growing on
MTBE as sole source of carbon and energy [20,21].
Probably, the massive use and the resulting widespread
groundwater pollution has been the driver for the evolution of bacterial strains possessing a suite of special
enzymes which enable MTBE mineralization (Figure 2).
After several oxidation steps, 2-HIBA as the last MTBE
intermediate carrying the isobutane skeleton is infiltrated into the common metabolism by a mutase catalyzing the conversion to the unbranched 3hydroxybutyric acid. As the involved enzymes seem to
be adapted to the tert-butyl residue, they may be of biotechnological use for the interconversion of chemicals
having the isobutane structure or a similar one (Figure
1). The mutase stands out against all other MTBErelated enzymes as it connects the “common” world of
biobased compounds with the special structures derived
from 2-HIBA.
In the course of these research activities, significant
progress on the biochemistry of 2-HIBA has been
achieved. Besides biohydrolysis, now other pathways
such as biooxidation processes and, above all, a novel
bioisomerisation reaction can be employed for producing 2-HIBA. These findings prepare for the first time
the ground for biotechnological routes producing 2HIBA from renewable organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, alcohols or fatty acids. Here, we describe
and discuss the old and new biotechnological pathways
to 2-HIBA in detail. Furthermore, the potential of these
synthesis routes for a large-scale biosynthesis of 2-HIBA
from renewable carbon is outlined.

MTBE and also other ethers used as fuel oxygenates are initially
attacked by various monooxygenases [20]. The resulting tert-butoxy
methanol may spontaneously dismutate to tert-butanol and
formaldehyde or is further oxidized to tert-butyl formate. The latter
ester can be hydrolyzed to tert-butanol and formic acid. A second
monooxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation of tert-butanol to 2methyl-1,2-propanediol which is oxidized via the corresponding
aldehyde to 2-HIBA. The latter is then isomerized to the common
metabolite 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA [39]. For further details see also
Figure 3b and c.

Possible biotechnological routes
Biohydrolysis of acetone cyanohydrin

Since the late 1980s, processes for the biohydrolysis
of aliphatic 2-hydroxynitriles to 2-HIBA and other
2-hydroxy carboxylic acids have been developed
[17,22,23]. Nitrile-hydrolyzing enzymes are widespread
in nature and are employed by bacteria and fungi for
degradation of biogenic nitriles, which are mainly of
plant origin [24]. In principle, two different pathways
are available (Figure 3a). On the one hand, the nitrile
can be directly hydrolyzed by a nitrilase to the carboxylic acid. On the other hand, the same result can be
obtained by combining activities of suitable nitrile

hydratases and amidases. In this two-step reaction
sequence, the corresponding amide is formed as an
intermediate and then hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.
Whereas nitrile hydratases for aliphatic nitriles have
been known for many years, nitrilases for the same substrates were not available until the 1990s [25,26].
For producing 2-HIBA, nitrile-hydrolyzing activities
from strains of various genera, such as Acidovorax,
Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Penicillium, have been

tested [17,22,23]. In principle, whole cells or enzyme
preparations have to be incubated with acetone cyanohydrin in aqueous solution where 2-HIBA is formed.
A severe disadvantage of the process is the instability of
acetone cyanohydrin at the near-neutral pH value
required for an efficient nitrile-hydrolyzing enzyme
activity. The decomposition of acetone cyanohydrin in
the reaction mixture results in the accumulation of acetone and cyanide which inhibit the enzyme activity.

Rohwerder and Müller Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:13
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/13

Consistently, some effort has been made for screening
for cyanide-resistant nitrile-hydrolyzing enzymes [27].
As many relevant enzymes are well characterized, optimization may also be accomplished by in vitro mutagenesis approaches. Recently, for example, protein
engineering was used for increasing specific activity of a
nitrilase from Acidovorax facilis 72W for the synthesis
of 3-hydroxy carboxylic acids [28].
Although an efficient acetone cyanohydrin-hydrolyzing
enzymatic system could be developed in the future, it
has to be stressed that this route is only partially based
on biotechnology as the nitrile will obviously be synthesized by petrochemical processes. Theoretically, a biosynthesis route to acetone cyanohydrin might be derived
from the pathway of linamarin production found in
plants [29,30]. The latter compound belongs to the
group of cyanogenic glucosides which are a kind of chemical defense response. In linamarin, the hydroxyl
group of acetone cyanohydrin forms a beta-glucosidic
bond with glucose. When plant tissue is disrupted by
chewing insects, beta-glucosidases and alpha-hydroxynitrilases get access to the glucoside and toxic hydrogen
cyanide and acetone are released. Before glucosidation
to form linamarin, acetone cyanohydrin is synthesized in
a multi-step process from the amino acid valine via the
corresponding oxime (Figure 3a). In the last years, there
has been significant progress in elucidating this pathway
and most of the involved enzymes are identified [29]. In
this connection, also the in vitro reversibility of the
hydroxynitrile lyase reaction has to be mentioned [31].
Thus, acetone cyanohydrin could also be enzymatically
produced from acetone and hydrocyanic acid. However,
a large-scale biotechnological route to acetone cyanohydrin is not realistic due to the instability and toxicity of
this compound.
Biooxidation of tert-butanol

A biooxidation route to 2-HIBA (Figure 3b) has recently
been derived from the bacterial degradation pathway of
MTBE via tert-butanol (Figure 2). The responsible
enzymes and encoding genes from the MTBE-degrading
bacterium Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2012
have been characterized [20]. In this strain, a none-heme
alkane monooxygenase is hydroxylating tert-butanol. The
resulting diol is further oxidized by two novel dehydrogenases, designated as MpdB and MpdC [20], to the carboxylic acid. The production of 2-HIBA employing the
mycobacterial enzymes has been patented [32]. More
recently, the enzyme system for the oxidation of tertbutanol has also been described for the MTBE-degrading
bacterial strains Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1 [33]
and Aquincola tertiaricarbonis L108 [34]. In both strains,
not an alkane monooxygenase but a phthalate dioxygenase-like enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of tert-

Page 5 of 10

butanol. This enzyme belongs to the family of mononuclear iron Rieske oxygenases [35]. So far, A. tertiaricarbonis L108 is the most efficient MTBE-degrader among the
known bacterial strains showing autarkic growth on this
fuel oxygenate [21]. Highly likely, this outstanding degradation potential is rooted in a set of specialized enzymes
well adapted for degrading MTBE and its metabolites.
Hence, employing the relevant enzymes found in strain
L108 may be the most promising approach for producing
2-HIBA from tert-butanol [36].
Biooxidation of tert-butanol may be an interesting
route for producing 2-HIBA. Similar to the approaches
employing nitrile-hydrolizing enzymes and starting at
acetone cyanohydrin, the substrate of the biological
steps has to be synthesized by petrochemical routes.
tert-Butanol is a bulk chemical and widely used as solvent and intermediate in chemical syntheses [37]. It is
also subjected to chemical oxidation for producing
methacrylic acid [4]. The now available enzymatic route
would be highly selective and less by-products would be
formed compared to the chemical oxidation process.
Most attractive for producing 2-HIBA, however, would
be a biotechnological process which is able to use substrates from renewable resources.
Bioisomerization of 3-hydroxybutyric acid

A biobased route to 2-HIBA is indeed possible, namely
by employing the second relevant metabolic sequence
derived from the degradation pathway of MTBE, the isomerisation of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (Figure 3c). Contrary to the biohydrolysis and biooxidation processes for
establishing a biotechnological pathway to 2-HIBA, the
bioisomerisation approach does not use a substrate
unknown to many biological systems but a common
metabolite. 3-Hydroxybutyric acid can easily be synthesized from renewable carbon by numerous microorganisms. Thus, the bioisomerisation proposal is the only
process currently available for a completely biotechnological production of 2-HIBA [38].
Search for the enzymatic step connecting the MTBE
intermediate 2-HIBA to the general assimilating and dissimilating carbon metabolism led to the discovery of a
novel mutase in the bacterial strain A. tertiaricarbonis
L108 [39]. In the bacterial MTBE degradation pathway,
this enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of the
branched 2-HIBA into the linear 3-hydroxybutyric acid,
more precisely, the Coenzyme A (CoA)-activated thioesters are the substrates of the mutase. In doing this, the
MTBE-specific pathway with quite unusual molecules
characterized by the tert-butyl moiety is connected with
the common metabolism, as 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA can
easily be assimilated or oxidized to carbon dioxide. The
so-called 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase is a new
representative of the CoA-carbonyl mutase family.

Rohwerder and Müller Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:13
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/13

These enzymes catalyze the 1,2-rearrangement of the
CoA-activated carboxyl group in the carbon skeleton of
their substrates [40,41] (Figure 4). In this quite complicated reaction, the cofactor adenosylcobalamin is used
to create radical intermediates. Among these enzymes is
the widespread methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (EC
5.4.99.2) catalyzing the interconversion of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, which plays a role in the
conversion of branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain
fatty acids and cholesterol. Another mutase, the isobutyryl-CoA mutase (EC 5.4.99.13), is only known from
bacteria and is responsible for the interconversion of
isobutyryl-CoA and butyryl-CoA. This enzyme has been
attributed to play a role in providing building blocks for
synthesis of polyketide antibiotics in Streptomyces spp.
[42,43]. More recently, a mutase has been characterized
catalyzing the interconversion of ethylmalonyl-CoA and
methylsuccinyl-CoA [44]. Besides these mutases, analogous rearrangements have been proposed in several bacterial pathways for the anaerobic degradation of
hydrocarbons and pivalic acid [40].
As the stereospecifc 1,2-rearrangement of carboxylic
acids can hardly be managed by chemical synthesis,
enzymes possessing this capability have a great biotechnological potential. Not only potential commodities
such as 2-HIBA (Figure 3c) but also specialty chemicals,
e. g. chiral precursors for drug synthesis, may be produced with the help of the mutases in the future. A prerequisite would be a better understanding of the
substrate specificity. Sequence comparison of the substrate-binding site, however, reveals high similarity
among the known enzymes. This is due to the fact that
only the conversion of CoA-activated substrates is catalyzed. Consequently, most of the binding site interacts
with the quite large coenzyme (MW = 768) and not
with the specific carboxylic acid (e. g. MW = 118 in the
case of methylmalonic acid). Indeed, only a few amino
acid residues have been identified to specifically interact
with the carboxylic acid substrate [40,45]. On the other

Page 6 of 10

hand, simple replacements of these residues have not
yet generated active enzymes [46].
Having a central position in the MTBE degradation
pathway makes the new 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA
mutase an important tool in developing for the first
time a completely biotechnological process for producing 2-HIBA. That is, in case of running a suitable biological system not along the MTBE degradation path,
but in the opposite direction and feeding simple substrates which are metabolized via acetyl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA can easily be produced by well-known
enzymatic reaction sequences (Figure 3c). Now, due to
the reversibility of the isomerization reaction, the
mutase will take the 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and convert
it into 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. It has to be highlighted
that the enzyme accomplishes this important job very
elegantly in only one step. Whole cells of the wildtype
strain of A. tertiaricarbonis already excrete 2-HIBA into
the medium when feed with 3-hydroxybutyrate in the
absence of oxygen [38]. Under these conditions, the substrate cannot be dissimilated by the cells but is CoAactivated and converted into 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA.
The reversibility of the mutase reaction has also been
proved using cell-free enzyme preparations of A. tertiaricarbonis [38].
Biological systems for producing 3-hydroxybutyrylCoA and the free acid 3-hydroxybutyrate are well
known. An endless number of bacteria synthesizes the
intracellular reserve material poly-3-hydroxybutyrate
(PHB) which is formed from enzymatic polymerization
of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA [47]. In the case of 2-HIBA
synthesis, similar systems can be used, e. g., by simply
replacing the PHB synthase with the 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase. In few words, the new route employing the 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase could be
described as a simple modification of the PHB and
3-hydroxybutyric acid biosynthesis process (Figure 5).
Considering the advanced stage of development of the
latter biotechnology [48,49], the new route to 2-HIBA is

very promising as most of the know-how can be
adopted.

Potential for large-scale production
Required host physiology

As already indicated above, the bioisomerization process
(Figure 3c) is currently the only proposal for a biotechnological production of 2-HIBA from renewable carbon
resources. Moreover, its connection to the PHB metabolism is a great advantage towards developing a large-scale
biotechnological production of 2-HIBA. For many decades, the PHB pathway has been investigated for producing biodegradable plastics and much effort has been
spent on studying the enzymatic steps and their regulation
[47,50]. Consequently, the metabolism resulting in
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and PHB is well understood and
the corresponding biotechnological process well established. However, as the synthesis of 2-HIBA and PHB only
share part of the enzymatic steps but finally deviate when
the product is formed (Figure 5), distinctive physiological
features might be required from a suitable host system.
Besides expressing a functional 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA

mutase, a high-rate production of its substrate, the
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, has to be achieved.
So far, the 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase has only
been detected in bacteria [39,40]. Among them are the
MTBE-degrading strains of the beta-proteobacterial genera Methylibium and Aquincola. Consequently, the genes
encoding for the two mutase subunits have been designated mdpO and mdpR (mdp for MTBE degradation
pathway) [33]. In addition, the mutase occurs in a few
other bacterial strains not associated with fuel oxygenate
mineralization [51]. Most of these strains also belong to
the beta-proteobacteria, indicating a possible disposition
of this phylogenetic group for 2-HIBA metabolism. On
the other hand, the genome of the Gram-positive strain
Nocardioides JS614 is encoding for the 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase and the strain is able to grow on
2-HIBA [51]. Obviously, a phylogenetic barrier for transfer and expression of the mutase genes does not exist. In
line with this, expression of another CoA-carbonyl
mutase, the closely related isobutyryl-CoA mutase, from
the Gram-positive Streptomyces cinnamonensis by the
gamma-proteobacterium E. coli has been achieved [45].

Rohwerder and Müller Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:13
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/13

Moreover, the heterologous expression of bacterial reaction sequences involving the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
has already been established in yeast for complex polyketide biosynthesis [52].
For the bioisomerization to 2-HIBA, any biological system would be suitable as a catalyst that can channel the
carbon flux to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. An essential trait
would be the ability for overflow metabolism. This holds
equally true for the accumulation of PHB. Disrupting the
latter process for connecting the carbon flow to 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase will finally lead to the accumulation of the building-block chemical 2-HIBA (Figure 5).
Natural PHB synthesis is only found in bacteria and has
mainly been studied in Gram-negative strains [47]. However, also Gram-positive strains have the potential for
PHB production [53]. In addition, the PHB synthesis
genes (phbABC) have already been introduced into yeast
and other organisms [47,48]. In a 2-HIBA producing system, of course, activity of the PHB synthase (PhbC) has
to be eliminated. As a countermove, the mutase genes
mdpOR [33,39] have to be expressed. Recently, modifications for producing not the polymer PHB but the enantiopure monomers (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid [54,55] or
(S)-3-hydroxybutyric acid [56] have been developed.
Thus, the combined expression of the relevant PHB
synthesis and mutase genes should lead to 2-HIBA production in a large variety of hosts.
Possible feedstocks

However, a 2-HIBA biotechnology faces the same economic problems as any other bioprocess aiming to produce a commodity chemical. Although it is likely that a
robust and high yield fermentation could be established,
high costs for substrates and downstream processing
would be major drawbacks. Nevertheless, considering
the particular features of the bioisomerization pathway
makes it a very realistic scenario that a large-scale production of biobased 2-HIBA could be established in the
near future. This will be outlined in the following.
Due to the fact that PHB synthesis and the bioisomerization process to 2-HIBA follow the same pathway
from acetyl-CoA via acetoacetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (Figure 3c), practically all substrates and
organisms which have already been tested for producing
the polymer are suitable systems. As carbon substrates,
any carbohydrates, alcohols, organic (fatty) acids, polyols
etc. can be used. However, current biotechnological processes for producing fuels and chemicals are faced with
rising prices as they mainly depend on simple sugars or
alcohols as carbon source. Consequently, process development should focus on second generation substrates.
In line with this, one of the present focuses on PHB
and, more general, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production has been on lowering the production costs. In this

Page 8 of 10

connection, recently low-cost substrates, such as wood
biomass [57], starch [58] as well as cane molasses and
other agricultural feedstocks [59], have been successfully
used for PHA production. With respect to the carbon
conversion efficiency and productivity, the same high
values for 2-HIBA can be expected as already achieved
for PHA [47-49].
Harvesting technologies

In comparison with PHA which forms intracellular
granules, harvesting and processing of the target product
would be easier in the case of 2-HIBA. The latter is a
water-soluble monomer that is excreted into the growth
medium [38]. Consequently, the producing cells need
not to be disrupted prior to product separation. In the
case of PHB, the released granules are typically separated by centrifugation which significantly contributes to
the processing costs [47]. On the contrary, separation
technologies already employed for biotechnologically
produced acetic, lactic and succinic acid can be adopted
as in all these cases structurally related low-weight carboxylic acids will be processed. In this connection,
separation processes such as the traditional crystallization as well as solvent extraction and ion-exchange
separation have been established [1,16].

Conclusions
Although a variety of industrial relevant precursors for
polymers bearing the isobutane carbon skeleton are
easily accessible from the C4 compound 2-HIBA, it is
not included in recent reports on potential biobased
building-block chemicals. This ignorance can be
explained by the lack of a feasible biotechnological route
to 2-HIBA. For decades, only the inefficient biohydrolysis of acetone cyanohydrin as a partially biotechnological
process has been known. More recently, biooxidation of
tert-butanol to 2-HIBA has been described. However,
more attractive for the production of 2-HIBA at industrial scale would be a pathways starting from renewable
resources. Due to the discovery of a novel CoA-carbonyl
mutase in MTBE-degrading bacteria, now a promising
approach employing enzymes of PHB synthesis and the
2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA mutase can be proposed.
Here, well established biotechnology is slightly modified
by adding only one enzymatic step catalyzing very elegantly the 1,2-rearrangement of the common metabolite
3-hydroxybutyric acid to 2-HIBA.
