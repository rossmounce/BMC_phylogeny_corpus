An association study on contrasting cystic fibrosis
endophenotypes recognizes KRT8 but not KRT18
as a modifier of cystic fibrosis disease severity
and CFTR mediated residual chloride secretion
Frauke Stanke1*, Silke Hedtfeld1, Tim Becker2 and Burkhard Tümmler1

Abstract
Background: F508del-CFTR, the most frequent disease-causing mutation among Caucasian cystic fibrosis (CF)
patients, has been characterised as a mutant defective in protein folding, processing and trafficking. We have
investigated the two neighbouring cytokeratin genes KRT8 and KRT18 in a candidate gene approach to ask
whether variants in KRT8 and/or KRT18 modify the impaired ion conductance known as the CF basic defect, and
whether they are associated with correct trafficking of mutant CFTR and disease severity of CF.
Methods: We have selected contrasting F508del-CFTR homozygous patient subpopulations stratified for disease
severity, comparing 13 concordant mildly affected sib pairs vs. 12 concordant severely affected sib pairs, or
manifestation of the CF basic defect in intestinal epithelium, comparing 22 individuals who exhibit CFTR-mediated
residual chloride secretion vs. 14 individuals who do not express any chloride secretion, for an association. The
KRT8/KRT18 locus was initially interrogated with one informative microsatellite marker. Subsequently, a low density
SNP map with four SNPs in KRT8 and two SNPs in KRT18, each selected for high polymorphism content, was used
to localize the association signal.
Results: KRT8, but not KRT18, showed an association with CF disease severity (Pbest = 0.00131; Pcorr = 0.0185) and
CFTR mediated residual chloride secretion (Pbest = 0.0004; Pcorr = 0.0069). Two major four-marker-haplotypes
spanning 13 kb including the entire KRT8 gene accounted for 90% of chromosomes, demonstrating strong linkage
disequilibrium at that locus. Absence of chloride secretion was associated with the recessive haplotype 1122 at
rs1907671, rs4300473, rs2035878 and rs2035875. The contrasting haplotype 2211 was dominant for the presence of
CFTR mediated residual chloride secretion. In consistency, the KRT8 haplotype 2211 was associated with mild CF
disease while 1122 was observed as risk haplotype. Analysis of microsatellite allele distributions on the SNP
background suggests that the mild KRT8 haplotype 2211 is phylogenetically older than its severe counterpart.
Conclusions: The two opposing KRT8 alleles which have been identified as a benign and as a risk allele in this
work are likely effective in the context of epithelial cell differentiation. As the mild KRT8 allele is associated with
CFTR mediated residual chloride secretion among F508del-CFTR homozygotes, the KRT8/KRT18 heterodimeric
intermediary filaments of the cytoskeleton apparently are an essential component for the proper targeting of CFTR
to the apical membrane in epithelial cells.

Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF, OMIM#219700) is an autosomal
recessive monogenic disease, caused by two defective
copies of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) gene [1]. CFTR, encoding a chlorideand bicarbonate transporter, is expressed in epithelial
cells [1]. The impaired ion conductance of CFTR expressing epithelia, known as the CF basic defect, can be
addressed for analytical and diagnostic purposes in the
sweat gland [1], intestinal [2] and respiratory [3] tissue
using in-vivo and ex-vivo methods. CFTR dysfunction
leads to a generalized exocrinopathy whereby symptoms
of the gastrointestinal and the respiratory tracts dominate
the clinical manifestation in CF [1].
CF is characterized by allelic heterogeneity, but among
patients of Caucasian descent, 70-80% of disease-causing
alleles are F508del-CFTR. Hence, about half of the
patient population is F508del-CFTR homozygous [1]. In
spite of the homogeneity of these patients with respect to
the major disease-causing gene, the course of disease varies considerably due to environmental factors and genes
other than CFTR [4,5]. These so-called modifying genes
are studied by several researchers [6] using candidategene based [5,7] and genome-wide approaches [8,9].
F508del-CFTR is known as a mutant defective in protein
folding, processing and trafficking [10]. While the CF basic
defect in the sweat gland shows consistently pathologically
elevated sweat chloride concentrations for all CF patients
homozygous for F508del-CFTR [1], the manifestation of
the basic defect in the respiratory and gastrointestinal
tract is variable in these patients, reflecting the diverse
clinical course [11,12]. In excised rectal suction biopsies
analysed by intestinal current measurement [2], the CFTR
mediated chloride current ranges from not detectable to
subnormal residual chloride secretion [11,12].
As CFTR is expressed epithelial cells of many tissues
throughout the body, CF is a complex multi-organ disease
[1] whereby the severity of some pathological manifestations are correlated. Patients who are pancreatic sufficient
are less susceptible to chronic colonization of the airways
by opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa than pancreatic insufficient patients [13,14]. F508delCFTR homozygotes who display CFTR mediated residual
chloride secretion in the airways or the intestine have a
milder clinical phenotype in comparison to F508del-CFTR
homozygotes who do not express any chloride secretion in
their tissues [12]. These two examples and other similar
observations suggest that the variability of the individual
disease manifestations are based on overlapping or shared
causes. The corresponding concept from the field of epidemiology describes such manifestations as endophenotypes.
The term endophenotypes was coined by the entomologists John and Lewis who derived the concept in the 1960s

Page 2 of 10

studying the geographical distributions of grasshopper
populations [15]. At the present time, endophenotypes are
taken into account by genetic epidemiologists who analyze
inherited factors that determine psychiatric diseases such
as schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder [16].
Using endophenotypes is considered advantageous to the
identification of causative genes because these are likely to
be determined be fewer genes and less likely prone to
environmental perturbations than the global disease manifestation [16]. Hence, as the CF basic defect is a manifestation of CFTR dysfunction at the cellular level and likely to
be less complex than a global disease phenotype such as
lung function, we hypothesize that measures of impaired
CFTR function can be used to get insight into CF modifying genes.
We hypothesized that the cellular protein network that
governs CFTR trafficking and processing [17,18], including the cytokeratin I/cytokeratin II pair KRT18/KRT8
which heteropolymerize to form intermediate-sized filaments in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells [19], might
determine the diversity in basic defect manifestations
among F508del-CFTR homozygous individuals. We have
recently described our candidate gene based analysis for
52 target genes on 16 different chromosomes using a
total of 182 genetic markers [5]. Here, we report on
unpublished findings on the cytokeratin gene cluster on
12q13 among European CF twins and siblings with contrasting clinical and basic defect endophenotypes genotyped at one informative intergenic microsatellite marker
and six single nucleotide polymorphisms intragenic to
the two neighbouring genes KRT8 and KRT18.

Methods
Study population

We have carried out an association study comparing
F508del-CFTR homozygous cystic fibrosis patient subsets
selected for an extreme clinical phenotype and/or their
manifestation of impaired ion conductance. The study
population and the selection criteria for cases and references of the association study has been described in
detail elsewhere [5]. Briefly, genotyping data from 101 CF
families, 85 of which are a subgroup of the twin and sibling study panel of 466 twin and sibling pairs, was used
for the association study [5]. 16 F508del-CFTR homozygous singletons with known basic defect and their parents were included into the analysis of the manifestation
of the CF basic defect. These 16 patients were recruited
from the local CF clinic at Hannover Medical School for
a study on the manifestation of the basic defect in excised
intestinal biopsies and subsequent CFTR protein analysis
and chip-based transcriptome analysis [5,20].
All patients have been enrolled into the association
study based on their extreme clinical and/or their basic

Stanke et al. BMC Medical Genetics 2011, 12:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/12/62

defect phenotype as characterized by intestinal current
measurement or nasal potential difference measurement
of the impaired ion conductance in CF of the intestinal
and respiratory epithelium, respectively [5]. While the
entire data set of two indels, 101 SNPs and 79 microsatellites, which include the KRT8/KT18 locus as a candidate gene, has recently been published [5], this work
gives details on KRT8 and KRT18 that have not been
reported elsewhere. In particular, we now report on the
results of our fine-mapping approach using a low density SNP map, assess the mode of inheritance and name
the risk and the benign allele at the KRT8/KRT18 locus.
These results have not been detailed in our previous
work.
Ethics approval

This study consists of the three subprojects no. 2771,
3739 and 4656 each of which was approved by the
ethics committee of the Medizinische Hochschule
Hannover prior to the start of the respective subproject.
Continuation of the study for the time period from July
1, 2009 until June 30, 2013 was granted by the ethics
committee by March 03, 2009. Patients who have been
enrolled into the association study have all given
informed consent that their DNA is analyzed for genetic
modifiers of CF disease in their DNA.
Case-reference populations to investigate association to
CF disease severity

Twin and sibling pairs with cystic fibrosis were recruited
from 158 CF clinics in 14 European countries [5]. Basic
clinical data such as actual weight, height and forced
expiratory volume in one second was inquired from the
treating physician using a one-page questionnaire [5]. To
describe the severity of the disease with one parameter
only which accounts for the severity of CF disease in the
two major afflicted organ systems, i.e. the gastrointestinal
and pulmonary tract, these basic clinical parameters were
combined in a composite parameter using a ranking algorithm [21]. For this purpose, weight and height were converted to weight as % of predicted weight for height (wfh
%) and FEV1 values were converted to CF population
centiles for FEV1 as % of predicted value (FEVPerc) [21].
Centiles of wfh% and FEVPerc were age independent in
the analyzed CF patient population [21]. Next, wfh% and
all FEVPerc values for the entire study population were
converted to rank numbers [21]. We have chosen this
approach in order to describe overall CF disease severity
assuming an equal weight of the anthropometric and the
pulmonary component.
In order to validate that the composite parameter is
suitable to detect the influence of inherited factors on
CF disease, dizygous and monozygous twin pairs were
compared in their intrapair differences in FEVPerc, wfh

Page 3 of 10

% and the composite parameter derived thereof. Intrapair discordance was significantly lower in monozygous
twin pairs as long as the composite parameter was considered, while no association of intrapair concordance
and twin zygosity was seen when only wfh% or only
FEVPerc were examined [21]. Interpreting the higher
concordance of monozygous twin pairs as an indication
of inherited factors that determine the phenotype, we
concluded from this finding that the composite parameter was more sensitive to detect inherited factors
than either of the individual clinical parameters wfh%
and FEVPerc. Consequently, we relied on the composite
parameter to select patient pairs with extreme clinical
phenotypes for the association study.
Based on the clinical disease severity of the individual
siblings and the intrapair discordance, concordant mildly
affected pairs (CON+; two sibs with similar and mild phenotype) and concordant severely affected pairs (CON-;
two sibs with similar and severe phenotype) were defined
[21]. As described previously [22], severely affected sibs
and mildly affected sibs differ significantly in both clinical
parameters utilized by the ranking algorithm. Respectively,
mean [inner quartiles; range] were as follows: for the intrapair sum of wfh% – 177[170-187;142-191] for concordant
severely affected sib pairs and 212[206-217;202-229] for
concordant mildly affected patient pairs; p < 0.001 (comparison carried out by Mann-Whitney rank test); for the
intrapair sum of FEVPerc – 43[18-66;9-97] for concordant
severely affected sib pairs and 116[85-143;60-190] for concordant mildly affected patient pairs; p < 0.001 (comparison carried out by Mann-Whitney rank test) [22]. KRT8
and KRT18 markers were interrogated for their association
with disease severity using the phenotypic contrast
between concordant/mildly (CON+) affected patient pairs
(26 patients, 13 affected patient pairs) and concordant/
severely (CON-) affected patient pairs (23 patients,
12 affected patient pairs, one thereof represented by one
sibling only) [5].
Case-reference populations to investigate association to
the manifestation of the CF basic defect

We have used intestinal current measurements (ICM) to
characterize the patients’ CF basic defect, defined as
impaired or absent CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in
CFTR-expressing tissues [1], in excised rectal suction
biopsies [2]. ICM measurements on twins and sibs have
been undertaken between 1997 and 1999 at selected CF
core centers in Hannover, Innsbruck, London, Rotterdam,
and Verona [11,12]. In addition, 16 F508del-CFTR homozygous singletons with known basic defect were recruited
from the local CF center at the Hannover Medical School
and included in the study [5]. Secretagogues such as carbachol, 8-bromo-adenosine-3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate
(cAMP) and histamine that activate or block ion channels,

Stanke et al. BMC Medical Genetics 2011, 12:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/12/62

ion exchangers or components of the cellular signal transduction pathways were applied to excised rectal suction
biopsies mounted in a micro-Ussing chamber to discriminate between patients with and without residual chloride
secretion [2]. As ICM is an ex-vivo method applied to
patient’s biopsies, the toxic compound DIDS (4,48-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,28-disulfonic acid) which has been
reported to block chloride channels other than CFTR,
could be used to differentiate between CFTR-mediated
residual chloride secretion and chloride secretion through
alternative channels [2,5].
When analysed by ICM, non-CF controls display upon
stimulation by carbachol or histamine short circuit currents (Isc) that exclusively monitor the Cl - secretory
response mediated by CFTR, because the obligatory K+
efflux response response is not visible in the presence of
fully functional CFTR [2]. For the diagnosis of CF, both
the direction and the magnitude of Isc is used. Typically,
CF patients display a biphasic response to carbachol and
histamine as the fast K+ current and the slower Cl- current, both visible in classical CF cases, show opposite
directions [2]. Responses range from 0% Cl - response
(equivalent to 100% K + signal) to 100% Cl - response
(equivalent to 0% K+ signal) among F508del-CFTR homozygotes [11]. In the absence of a K+ signal, a Cl- secretory
response below 10 μA/cm 2 is taken as an indicator of
CFTR dysfunction and is consistent with CF [2]. The judgment of whether or not a recording shows evidence of
residual CFTR activity is based on the relative proportions
of the K+ and the Cl- signals in the biphasic response to
carbachol and to histamine after the application of DIDS
[11]. No evidence of a chloride secretory current values in
both cases is interpreted as absence of CFTR function.
Residual Cl - secretion that is mediated by CFTR is
assumed if both, carbachol and histamine response after
the incubation with DIDS show a proportion of at least
40% of Cl- secretory response (equivalent to 60% or less of
K+ response) in the presence of a cAMP-mediated Cl secretory response [11].
The cystic fibrosis basic defect assessed by intestinal
current measurement was evaluated by comparing a set
of 14 patients devoid of residual chloride secretion as
controls to 22 patients who exhibit CFTR-mediated residual chloride secretion. These patients were either unrelated F508del-CFTR homozygotes or enrolled from a sib
pair by an index-case strategy so that cases and controls
for this comparison are unrelated [5].
Data evaluation

Genetic data for the association study was evaluated
using the FAMHAP software package [23] which allows
family-based analysis [24,25] and accepts data evaluation
in association studies on unrelated individuals as well as
on affected sib pairs [23]. Case and reference population,

Page 4 of 10

as specified above, were analysed for an association of
KRT8/KRT18 markers with the manifestation of CF disease severity and the manifestation of impaired ion conductance. Genotyping data was evaluated by comparing
cases and references with respect to allele and haplotype
as well as genotype and diplotype distributions.
All case-reference comparisons were carried out using
10,000 Monte-Carlo simulated data sets [23-25]. The analysis of more than one marker per locus is corrected for
multiple testing by haplotype permutation [25]. For this
purpose, the entire data set of cases and references is used
to estimate haplotype frequencies [23]. Haplotype, or, in
cases of non-informative phase or haplotype uncertainty,
weighted haplotype explanation lists are assigned to each
individual whereby the haplotype frequencies of the entire
data set are taken into account to compute the conditional
likelihood weights [23]. Permutation is done by randomly
assigning the affection status to the individuals in each
replication whereby the ratio of cases and controls is kept
constant [23]. For the comparison of case sib pairs to
reference sib pairs, the affection status is permuted or not
with equal chance for both siblings simultaneously [23-25].
P-values for comparison of n-marker-haplotype and all
marker subsets derived thereof are computed as s/n,
where n is the number of permutation replicates, and
where s is the number of permutation replicates leading to
a test statistic higher than or equal to that of the real data
[23]. Similarly, diplotype distributions between cases and
controls are compared whereby a diplotype is a haplotype
pair of the individual [23-25]. Reported P values are: Praw,
referring to a computed P value of a single marker or a
marker subset, Pbest, referring to the best observed Praw
value, and Pcorr, referring to the P value of the entire marker set that is corrected for multiple testing. The adjustment for multiple testing properly accounts for LD within
the Monte-Carlo simulation framework that evaluates the
corrected signficance minP, the smallest observed raw
P-value [24]. The computational details of the minP principle have been described elsewhere [24].
To allow a comparable assignment of weighted haplotype explanations in all subpopulations, the entire genotyping data of 101 CF families were provided as training
set to FAMHAP for all case-reference comparisons [5].
Genotyping

KRT8 and KRT18 markers have been genotyped as
described before [5]. For microsatellite marker development, the genomic sequence was retrieved from the
NCBI database selecting 200.000 bp upstream and downstream of KRT8. The primary sequence was analyzed
with the program TandemRepeatFinder to reveal repetitive sequences. After in-silico analysis, priority was given
to a sequence with high numbers of motif copies in the
reference sequence because this marker is more likely to

Stanke et al. BMC Medical Genetics 2011, 12:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/12/62

be polymorphic than short repeats, and to a sequence
which is located between KRT8 and KRT18. The selected
dinucleotide repeat KRT8Sat with the reference sequence
(CA) 12 (TA)(CA) 2 (TA)(CA) 4 starting at position
15442813 on contig NT_029419 was typed by polymerase-chain reaction amplification using unlabeled primer
5’-AAATGAGTGAATAAACATCACACG and biotinlabelled primer 5’-CCTTCAGATGTAGAGGGACGA
[5]. PCR products were visualized by direct blotting electrophoresis on a high-resolution polyacrylamide gel and
chemoluminescence detection of biotinylated PCR products as described elsewhere [5]. Application of the PCR
amplicon for routine genotyping purposes was judged
based on unrelated control samples. Alleles were scored
by size in arbitrary repeat units whereby an invariant set
of controls was used for calibration on all gels.
SNPs typed by PCR-RFLP were selected from internet
resources whereby priority was given to markers based on
their position on the physical map, aiming for intermarker
intervals at KRT8 and KRT18 of more than 2000 bp and
less than 10.000 bp, and the allele frequencies published
for the European-Caucasian population, aiming for maximal polymorphism information content through selecting
markers with equal frequencies of both alleles. SNPs were
typed by polymerase-chain reaction with subsequent
restriction digest (PCR-RFLP) using an enzyme that discriminates between the two alleles because the SNP alters
the enzyme’s recognition site. Application of the PCRRFLP primer and enzyme combination for routine genotyping and informativity of the SNP was verified by genotyping unrelated control samples. Primers and restriction
enzymes were as follows: rs1907671: 5’-GTTCTGCTC
ACCCCTTCCTC and 5’-AACTCTTTCCTTTTGGGGAGA with HaeIII; rs4300473: 5’-TGATCTGGGCTAAGGTGGTC and 5’-GGTGCTTCCTCTTCCTTTCC
with AvaII; rs2035878: 5’-GAGATCAACTTCCTCCAGCAG and 5’-GCCTCTGGTTGAGTCTCAGG with
AlwNI; rs2035875: 5’-TGAATTAAGAGAAAAGACGAATTGC and 5’-TCCAGCATCTTGTTCTGCTG with
XmnI; rs2638526: 5’-TCACCTAATGGTGGGGAGAG
and 5’-CTCACATTCACTGCCACCTG with HpyCH4IV;
rs2070876: 5’-AGAACCACGAAGAGGCAAGC and 5’AGAATGCTCTTCATCAGAGC with AciI [5].

F508del-CFTR homozygotes who exhibit CFTR-mediated
residual chloride secretion (ICM-CFTR Res.) determined
by intestinal current measurement (Praw = 0.0177).
To determine whether the association signal observed
at KRT8Sat is due to variations in KRT8 and/or KRT18,
we have next selected informative single nucleotide
polymorphisms in these equally plausible candidate
genes [19].
Intragenic SNPs in KRT8 allocate the association signal to
CF basic defect and disease severity

Four SNPs in and near KRT8 and two SNPs in and near
KRT18 have been evaluated for association with haplotype
(phenotypic contrast CON-/CON+) and diplotype (phenotypic contrast ICM-no Res./ICM-CFTR Res.) distributions
(Figure 1B,C). In both analyses, KRT8 markers provide
smaller P values than KRT18 markers. Single marker analyses of rs2638526 and rs2070876 as well as the resulting
two-marker combination for these variants within and
near KRT18 did not reach significance. Those haplotype
or diplotype distributions including one or both of these
KRT18 markers which exceed the threshold of a 5% error
probability are higher-order marker combinations that
include at least KRT8Sat and/or one of the SNPs intragenic to KRT8, spanning the entire intragenic region and
are inconclusive for mapping purposes (Figure 1B,C). In
contrast, many single marker analyses and marker combinations restricted to the four SNPs rs1907671, rs4300473,
rs2035878 and rs2035875 which are localized within or
near KRT8 reach significance (Figure 1B,C). Within KRT8,
linkage disequilibrium is strong with D’ between any two
of the four SNPs ranging from 0.901 to 1.000 (mean
0.962). SNP pairs composed of any of the four KRT8
SBNPs and any of the two KRT18 SNPs show D’ values
from 0.370 to 0.487 (mean 0.435). Thus, the two KRT
genes reside on different haplotype blocks of the genome.
We conclude that the causative variant responsible for the
allelic association with CF disease severity and the CF
basic defect which we observed at KRT8Sat is likely to be
found in KRT8 and not in KRT18. Both association signals
remain significant after correction for multiple testing
with 7 markers (Pcorr = 0.0185 for contrast CON-/CON+
and Pcorr = 0.0069 for contrast ICM-no Res./ICM-CFTR
Res.).

Results
A microsatellite between KRT8 and KRT18 shows
association with CF disease manifestation

We have genotyped KRT8Sat, a dinucleotide repeat
located between KRT8 and KRT18 (Figure 1A). Allele
distributions were significantly different comparing
mildly (CON+) and severely (CON-) affected patient
pairs (Praw = 0.0409) and genotype distributions were significantly different comparing patients without chloride
secretion (ICM-no Res) in excised intestinal biopsies to

The major contrasting KRT8 haplotypes constitute a
dominant and a recessive allele which determine the
manifestation of the CF basic defect

We have calculated haplotype frequencies in the entire
patient population of 171 F508del-CFTR homozygotes
from 101 families (Table 1). 90% of KRT8 chromosomes
are accounted for by the two rs1907671-rs4300473rs2035878-rs2035875 haplotypes 1122 and 2211 which
occur on 43% and 48% of transmitted chromosomes

Alleles at all PCR-RFLP typed SNPs are named for absence (allele 1) or presence (allele 2) of diagnostic restriction site [5]; T: transmitted chromosomes of the
entire patient population of 101 CF families (171 F508del-CFTR homozygotes) [5]; CON+: concordant mildly affected patient pair (13 families) [5]; CON-:
concordant severely affected patient pair (12 families) [5]; ICM Res.: patients who exhibit CFTR-mediated residual chloride secretion in ICM (intestinal current
measurement; 22 families) [5]; ICM no Res.: patients who do not exhibit residual chloride secretion in ICM (intestinal current measurement; 14 families) [5]; Praw:
observed uncorrected P-value; Pcorr: corrected for multiple testing of 4 SNPs [25]

(Table 1). Next, we have reviewed the haplotype and
diplotype distributions among or patient subsamples to
assign the risk and the benign allele (contrast CON-/CON
+) and to deduce the mode of inheritance for the manifestation of CFTR mediated residual chloride secretion (contrast ICM-no Res./ICM-CFTR Res.). As the frequency of
allele 2211 is elevated among the mildly affected patient
pairs CON+ in comparison to the CON- sample, we conclude that 2211 is the benign and 1122 the severe allele at
KRT8 (Table 1). The presumed mild allele 2211 is also
observed more frequently among patients with CFTR
mediated residual current while the frequency of the putative risk allele 1122 is elevated among patients who do not
exhibit any chloride secretion (Table 1). In support of
these conclusions, a deviation from the expectancy frequencies derived under the condition of the Hardy Weinberg-Law are observed among mildly affected patient pairs
who are more frequently homozygous for the haplotype
2211 and among patients who do not exhibit any chloride
secretion who are more frequently homozygous for the
allele 1122 (Table 2). Moreover, 57% of patients who do
not display residual secretion are homozygotes for the
KRT8 haplotype 1122 while 77% are heterozygous or
homozygous carriers for the putative mild KRT8 haplotype
2211 (Table 2). We deduce from this observation that out
of the two frequent contrasting KRT8 haplotypes, 1122 is
a recessive allele and 2211 is a dominant allele. In other
words, carriership of one benign KRT8 haplotype 2211
allele is sufficient for the modification of the CF basic
defect in F508del-CFTR homozygotes.

The mild KRT8 haplotype is phylogenetically old

We wanted to know which of the two frequent KRT8
haplotypes is older and have analyzed the four two-marker-haplotypes each composed of one out of the four
KRT8 SNPs rs1907671, rs4300473, rs2035878 and
rs2035875 in combination with the microsatellite
KRT8Sat (Figure 2). Four major alleles, each present on
more than 10% of chromosomes and all of them
accounting for 98% of chromosomes are observed at the
(CA)n-repeat KRT8Sat in the entire patient sample (Figure 2). SNP alleles 2 at rs1907671, 2 at rs4300473, 1 at
rs2035878 and 1 at rs2035875 were observed to occur
with three major microsatellite alleles that differ by
more than one repeat motif in size, showing a broad
distribution that has likely been generated by more than
one recombination event (Figure 2). In contrast, the
opposite SNP alleles 1 at rs1907671, 1 at rs4300473, 2
at rs2035878 and 2 at rs2035875 are observed together
with two microsatellite alleles that differ by one repeat
motif in size, one presumably having emerged from the
other by an indel event in the microsatellite’s primary
sequence (Figure 2). Under the assumption that the
KRT8Sat alleles themselves are functionally equivalent
and neutral towards the studied phenotypes, we conclude that the benign KRT8 haplotype 2211 is older
than the severe 1122 allele as one slippage event,
explaining the KRT8Sat allele distribution on the 1122
background, requires fewer generations than the multiple recombination events that have generated the microsatellite’s sequence pattern on 2211 alleles.

Discussion
By genotyping F508del-CFTR homozygous sibpairs and
unrelated index cases selected for their extreme clinical or
electrophysiological phenotype, we have mapped a modifier for disease severity and CFTR mediated residual chloride secretion to KRT8 based on an initial interrogation
with one informative microsatellite and a low-density-scan
with six SNPs located within or near the two neighbouring
and equally plausible candidate genes KRT8 and KRT18
(Figure 1, Tables 1, 2). As strong LD was observed
at KRT8, we could assign the risk and the benign
allele at this locus to the two similarly frequent major
four-marker-haplotypes that account for about 90% of
alleles in our patient population (Table 1). We have
observed that the CF basic defect is determined via KRT8
whereby the phylogenetically older KRT8 haplotype 2211
is dominant for the manifestation of CFTR mediated residual chloride secretion and also recognized consistently as
the benign modifier allele that is associated with a milder
clinical phenotype among concordant CF sibpairs (Table
2, Figure 2). Accordingly, the phylogenetically younger
contrasting haplotype 1122 constitutes the recessive risk
allele (Table 2, Figure 2). As the phylogenetically older and
dominant allele conveys CFTR mediated chloride secretion, indicative of proper targeting of CFTR to the epithelial apical membrane, we conclude that this condition has
provided a selective advantage to human beings. Consistently, the younger recessive risk allele manifests only in
the homozygous state.
The strategy employed here, i.e. the initial interrogation of a candidate gene and the subsequent fine-mapping using informative SNPs has been successfully
applied before to identify CF modifying genes on 12p13
[26] and 19q13 [27]. In these two cases, haplotypeguided hierarchical fine-mapping [27] has allowed the
identification of all possible causative variants on small
genomic fragments of 2 kb, 3 kb and 7.5 kb [26,27]. For
KRT8, we did not pursue our approach beyond the present stage to describe the difference between the two
contrasting haplotypes comprehensively as the fragment
between rs1907671 and rs2035875 already covers 13 kb
due to the high LD observed and is likely to extend
further at both sides, involving several kb of intergenic
sequence with unknown function which will be difficult
to annotate without further information on the molecular mechanism that determines its role as a CF modifier.
The type I cytokeratin KRT18 and the type II cytokeratin KRT8 are coexpressed and copolymerize to form
intermediate filaments in single-layered epithelial cells.
Both, KRT8 and KRT18 have been implicated before as
candidate genes that modify the phenotype of the
mutant F508del-CFTR, known to be defective in protein
folding, processing and trafficking [10] by functional

Page 9 of 10

data: Davezac et al [19] have analyzed cell lines transfected with wt-CFTR and F508del-CFTR by differential
two-dimensional electrophoresis and identified KRT8
and KRT18 to be differentially expressed.
It is conceivable that the role of the two opposing
KRT8 alleles which have been identified as a benign and
as a risk allele in this work are effective in the context of
epithelial cell differentiation. Based on a mouse model
that expresses human KRT8 on top of its murine homologue and curiously shares several pathologic characteristics with a transgenic mouse that expresses a dominantnegative mutant TGF-beta type II receptor, it has been
suggested that the regulation of keratin expression could
be related to neoplastic and/or inflammatory disorders
[28]. As the mild KRT8 allele is associated with CFTR
mediated residual chloride secretion among F508delCFTR homozygotes, the KRT8/KRT18 heterodimeric
intermediary filaments of the cytoskeleton may be an
essential component for the proper targeting of CFTR to
the apical membrane in epithelial cells.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have identified two frequent contrasting KRT8 haplotypes whereby these influence the manifestation of the CF basic defect as a dominant and as a
recessive allele. The importance of these two KRT8 variants is substantiated by their association with CF disease severity. Our results on KRT8 exemplify that
modifiers of CF disease severity can be recognized
through their association with the CFTR-mediated basic
defect, which is less likely to be prone to perturbations
by environmental factors in comparison to lung function
measurements which are frequently relied on as the sole
outcome parameter in CF modifier analysis.
