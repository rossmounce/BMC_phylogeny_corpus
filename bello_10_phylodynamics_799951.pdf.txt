Abstract
Background: Although HIV-1 CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF are two epidemiologically important recombinant lineages
circulating in Argentina and Uruguay, little is known about their population dynamics.
Methods: A total of 120 “CRF12_BF-like” and 20 “CRF38_BF-like” pol recombinant sequences collected in Argentina
and Uruguay from 1997 to 2009 were subjected to phylogenetic and Bayesian coalescent-based analyses to
estimate evolutionary and demographic parameters.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses revealed that CRF12_BF viruses from Argentina and Uruguay constitute a single
epidemic with multiple genetic exchanges among countries; whereas circulation of the CRF38_BF seems to be
confined to Uruguay. The mean estimated substitution rate of CRF12_BF at pol gene (2.5 × 10-3 substitutions/site/
year) was similar to that previously described for subtype B. According to our estimates, CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF
originated at 1983 (1978-1988) and 1986 (1981-1990), respectively. After their emergence, the CRF12_BF and
CRF38_BF epidemics seem to have experienced a period of rapid expansion with initial growth rates of around
1.2 year-1 and 0.9 year-1, respectively. Later, the rate of spread of these CRFs_BF seems to have slowed down
since the mid-1990s.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF viruses were generated during the 1980s, shortly
after the estimated introduction of subtype F1 in South America (~1975-1980). After an initial phase of fast
exponential expansion, the rate of spread of both CRFs_BF epidemics seems to have slowed down, thereby
following a demographic pattern that resembles those previously reported for the HIV-1 epidemics in Brazil, USA,
and Western Europe.

Background
The AIDS epidemic in South America is caused by multiple HIV-1 group M subtypes including subtypes B, F1,
and C, in addition to BF1 and BC recombinant forms.
The BF1 recombinants represent the most widespread
genetic form after subtype B and reach a high prevalence (10%-50%) in countries from the Southern Cone
(Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) [1-14].
Genetic characterization of BF1 recombinants in
South America revealed some important differences
across countries. Although four distinct BF1 circulating

recombinant forms (CRFs) have been described in Brazil
to date (CRF28_BF, CRF29_BF, CRF39_BF, and
CRF40_BF) [15,16], the Brazilian BF1 epidemic is largely
dominated by a variety of unique recombinants forms
(URFs) that do not share a common recombinant ancestor [7,10,17-19]. In contrast, the Argentine BF1 epidemic comprises the widespread CRF12_BF and several
URFs with a CRF12-related structure [6,8,20,21]. The
molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Uruguay is not so
well characterized, but two previous studies suggested
that BF1 recombinants circulating in this country are
similar to those described in Argentina [3,20]. Very
recently, a novel CRF38_BF1 was described among Uruguayan HIV-1 isolates, indicating that other BF1

recombinants besides CRF12_BF have gained epidemic
importance in this country [14].
Previous studies performed by our group suggest that
the HIV-1 subtype F1 and BF1 epidemics in South
America were initiated after the introduction of a single
F1 strain into Brazil between the middle and late 1970s
[22-24]. After its introduction, this founder subtype F1
strain probably recombined with the local subtype B
virus generating the large diversity of CRFs_BF1 and
URFs_BF1 currently observed in the continent [24].
Based on monophyletic clustering and coincident
recombination breakpoints, it was suggested that most
BF1 recombinants circulating in Argentina and Uruguay
derived from a common recombinant ancestor
[21,24,25].
To date, however, very little is known about the evolutionary history and epidemic potential of the diverse
BF1 recombinants that have expanded in the South
American population. Only one previous study was conducted on a small number (n = 40) of CRF12_BF-like
vpu sequences from a vertically infected population in
Argentina [26]. This study estimated the age of the
most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of those
CRF12_BF-like viruses between 1981 and 1996, and
further suggests an extremely rapid spread of the
CRF12_BF-like recombinant viruses, compatible with
the demographic pattern of explosive population growth
observed in this pediatric population at the start of the
epidemic.
The objective of the present study was to reconstruct
the evolutionary and demographic history of the
CRF12_BF circulating in Argentina and Uruguay
through the analysis of a large data set (n = 120) of
CRF12_BF-like pol sequences recovered from adults and
children living in both countries. In addition, we also
analyzed a small data set (n = 20) of CRF38_BF-like pol
sequences to estimate the age and demographic history
of the CRF38_BF epidemic spreading in Uruguay. This
data represent an excellent opportunity to explore
potential CRF-specific and regional-specific differences
in the patterns of HIV-1 epidemic growth in South
America.

Argentina, identifying 43 samples with a CRF12_BFlike mosaic pattern (Aulicino et al, publication in progress). The second study assessed the genetic diversity
in a group of BF1 pol recombinant samples collected
between 1997 and 2009 from HIV-1 infected adults
and children residing in Uruguay, identifying 23 samples with a CRF12_BF-like mosaic structure and 17
samples with a CRF38_BF-like mosaic pattern
(Ruchansky et al, publication in progress). These
unpublished sequences were combined with CRF12_BF
(Argentina n = 3; Uruguay n = 2) and CRF38_BF (Uruguay n = 3) reference sequences, and CRF12_BF-like
pol sequences (Argentina n = 48; Uruguay n = 1) from
adults patients with known sampling dates retrieved
from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index, as described in
Table 1. Sequences were excluded if they originated
from the same patient or from individuals known to be
related by direct transmission. The sequences were
~1440 bp long and covered the protease (PR) and part
of the reverse transcriptase (RT) genes (nucleotides
2266-3705 relative to the HXB2 clone), encompassing
the recombinant fragments of the CRF12_BF and
CRF38_BF at pol gene (Fig. 1a). Nucleotide sequences
were aligned using CLUSTAL X program [27]. All
positions with alignment gaps were excluded from
analyses.

Methods
Study population

A total of 66 and 17 samples with a CRF12_BF-like
and CRF38_BF-like mosaic pattern at the pol gene,
respectively, were selected from HIV-1-infected
patients residing in Argentina and Uruguay who had
previously been analyzed in two independent studies.
The first study analyzed the genetic structure of BF1
pol recombinant sequences collected between 1997 and
2008 from HIV-1 infected children followed up at the
“Hospital de Pediatria Garrahan” in Buenos Aires,

Characterization of “CRF-like” recombinant profiles

Two strategies were used to characterize the HIV-1 pol
sequences used in the present study as CRF12_BF-like
or CRF38_BF-like recombinants:
1) First, the recombination breakpoints of each
sequence were identified by Bootscanning using Simplot
version 3.5.1 [28]. Bootstrap values supporting branching with reference sequences were determined in Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees constructed using the K2-P [29]
nucleotide substitution model, based on 100 re-samplings, with a 200 bp sliding window moving in steps of
20 bases. Individual query sequences were compared to
representative reference sequences of HIV-1 subtypes
A1, B, C, and F1. Sequences were considered to have a
“CRF-like” profile if recombination sites exactly match
those identified in CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF reference
sequences.
2) Second, Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML)
phylogenetic trees for the final pol alignment including
all CRF-like sequences were built to confirm the overall
topology and strong support of each CRF clade. Phylogenetic trees were constructed under the GTR [30]
nucleotide substitution model, with a gamma-distribution model of among site rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+I+Γ) selected using the
Modeltest program [31]. A Bayesian phylogeny was estimated using MrBayes [32]. Two runs of four chains
each were run for 50 × 106 generations, with a burn-in
of 5 × 106 generations. Convergence of parameters was
assessed by calculating the Effective Sample Size (ESS)
using TRACER v1.4 [33], after excluding an initial 10%
for each run. All parameter estimates for each run
showed ESS values >100. ML trees were reconstructed
with PhyML [34] using an online web server [35]. Heuristic tree searches were performed using the SPR
branch-swapping algorithm, and the approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) based on a Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure was used as a statistical test to
calculate branch support. Trees were visualized with the
FigTree v1.1.2 program (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.
uk/software/figtree/).
Estimation of evolutionary rates, dates, and demographic
history

The evolutionary rate (μ, units are nucleotide substitutions per site per year), the age of the most recent common ancestor (Tmrca, years), and the mode and rate (r,
years -1 ) of population growth for the CRF12_BF and
CRF38_BF strains were estimated using BEAST v1.4.7
[36,37]. Evolutionary and demographic parameters of
CRF12_BF were estimated under a chronological timescale employing the dates of sample collection. The low
number of CRF38_BF sequences analyzed (i.e., 20
sequences), however, was not sufficient to obtain an

Page 4 of 9

accurate estimate of the evolutionary rate of this lineage.
Therefore, the rates of evolution at pol (PR/RT) gene
previously estimated for other HIV-1 group M subtypes
(1.5 × 10-3 - 2.5 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year) [38-41]
were incorporated as a prior probability distribution in
the analysis of this CRF. Estimations of evolutionary and
demographic parameters involved two steps. First, the
Bayesian skyline plot method [42] was used to estimate
μ, the Tmrca, and the change in effective population size
through time. Second, two different demographic models for each data set were compared: exponential and
logistic growth; and estimates of the population growth
rate were then obtained under the model that provided
the best fit to the demographic signal in each data set.
Model comparisons in a Bayesian framework were performed by calculating the Bayes Factor (BF) [43] with
TRACER v1.4. Analyses were performed using the
GTR+I+Γ nucleotide substitution model under either
strict or uncorrelated Lognormal relaxed [44] molecular
clock models. Two separate MCMC chains were run for
10-50 × 106 generations, with a burn-in of 1-5 × 10 6.
BEAST output was analysed using TRACER v1.4, with
uncertainty in parameter estimates reflected in the 95%
Highest Probability Density (HPD) intervals. Convergence of parameters was assessed through the ESS, with
all parameter estimates for each run showing ESS values
>100. A graphical representation of the effective number
of infections through time was generated by using programs TRACER v1.4 and Prism 4 (GraphPad Software).
Posterior trees samples from BEAST runs were summarized using TreeAnnotator v1.4.7 (available from
http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) to generate time-scaled maximum clade credibility trees.

Results
A total of 115 pol sequences (Argentina = 91, Uruguay
= 24) with a “CRF12_BF-like” recombination profile,
and 17 pol sequences (Uruguay) with a “CRF38_BF-like”
recombinant pattern were identified by Bootscanning
analyses. These sequences were aligned with reference
sequences of CRF12_BF, CRF38_BF and Brazilian
CRFs_BF1, and analyzed using Bayesian and ML
approaches. Both phylogenetic approaches showed that
the CRF12_BF-like and CRF38_BF-like pol sequences
segregated with their respective CRF reference
sequences in two well supported monophyletic groups
characterized by unique recombination profiles, confirming the common ancestry of each CRF (Fig. 1). Of
note, Simplot analysis suggests that the CRF38_BF presents a more complex BF1 mosaic pattern at the PR/RT
genomic region than that previously described [14],
characterized by the presence of small subtype F1 fragments between positions 2640 and 3020 relative to
HXB2 (Fig. 1). More detailed analysis of the pol genomic

region should be performed in order to determine the
precise mosaic structure of the CRF38_BF at that region.
Within the CRF12_BF clade, two strongly supported
Uruguayan subclusters comprising four (cluster UY-1)
and six (cluster UY-2) viruses were identified in both
Bayesian (posterior probability [PP] > 0.80) (Fig. 1) and
ML (aLTR > 0.70) phylogenetic trees (data not shown).
Most (61%) CRF12_BF Uruguayan sequences, however,
were randomly interspersed among Argentine
sequences, which provides evidence against the existence
of a specific Argentine or Uruguayan CRF12_BF lineage.
This contrasts with the circulation of CRF38_BF which
seems to be restricted to Uruguay, as no strains with a
CRF38_BF-like structure were identified after analysis of
more than 300 BF1 recombinant pol sequences from
Argentina (74 unpublished sequences and 249 sequences
retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database).
Bayesian MCMC analyses under a skyline tree prior
were used to estimate the time-scale of the CRF12_BF
and CRF38-BF epidemics. The mean estimated evolutionary rate for the CRF12_BF pol gene was 2.4 × 10-3
subst./site/year, under both strict and relaxed molecular
clock models (Table 2). The median rate of evolution
for the CRF38_BF pol gene was 1.8 × 10-3 subst./site/
year (strict clock) and 1.9 × 10 -3 (relaxed clock),
although the 95% HPD intervals of those estimates
almost coincide with the informative prior interval
(Table 2), indicating that not much information was
added by the data. Considering these substitution rates,
the median T mrca of the CRFs was estimated at 1982
(strict clock) and 1983 (relaxed clock) for the
CRF12_BF, and 1985 (strict clock) and 1986 (relaxed
clock) for the CRF38_BF (Table 2).

Bayesian skyline plot analyses were also used to infer
the demographic history of South American CRF_BF
epidemics. According to this analysis the CRF12_BF epidemic experienced a fast exponential growth during the
first 10-15 years followed by a more recent decline in
growth rate since the mid-1990s (Fig. 2a). A very similar
demographic pattern was observed for the CRF38_BF,
showing that after an initial period of exponential
growth of ~10 years the growth rate of this CRF epidemic also slowed around the mid-1990s (Fig. 2b).
These results suggest that a model of logistic population
growth fits the demographic information contained in
the CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF data sets better than the
exponential growth model.
To test this hypothesis, approximate marginal log likelihoods for the logistic and exponential growth models
were calculated. The analysis of BF clearly showed that,
for both CRFs, the model of logistic population growth
was strongly supported over the exponential growth
model, under either a strict or a relaxed molecular clock
(Table 3). On the other hand, models assuming a
relaxed molecular clock fit the CRF12_BF and
CRF38_BF data sets better than models enforcing a
strict molecular clock (Table 3) indicating that substitution rate varies among branches consistent with other
HIV-1 studies [39,45-47]. Indeed, the coefficients of
variation under the relaxed clock model were higher
than zero for both CRF12_BF (mean = 0.21, 95% HPD:
0.16-0.26) and CRF38_BF (mean = 0.28, 95% HPD:
0.10-0.46).
A coalescent model of logistic growth was then used
to estimate the initial growth rate of South American
CRF_BF epidemics. Evolutionary parameters estimated

under the logistic growth tree prior were almost identical to those estimated with Bayesian skyline (Table 2).
The mean estimated growth rate of CRF12_BF epidemic
was 1.08 year-1 (strict clock), and 1.22 year-1 (relaxed
clock). This rate corresponds to a mean epidemic doubling time of around six months (Table 4). The mean
growth rate of the CRF38_BF epidemic was estimated at
0.83 year-1 (strict clock) and 0.92 year-1 (relaxed clock),
which corresponds to a mean epidemic doubling time of
<1 year (Table 4).

Discussion
We have performed an extensive study of the evolutionary history and population dynamics of the two most prevalent HIV-1 BF1 recombinant strains (CRF12_BF and
CRF38_BF) spreading in South America. The CRF12_BF
was the first CRF to be described in South America
among samples isolated from Argentina and Uruguay
[20], and is responsible for a significant part of the
HIV-epidemics in those countries. Our phylogenetic analyses of recombinant pol sequences with a CRF12-like

Estimates of the median growth rate (r, yr-1) and epidemic doubling time (l, yr) for the HIV-1 CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF epidemics (95% HPD in parentheses).
Growth rate estimates were used to calculate the time taken for the epidemic to double in size (l) using the relation l = ln(2)/r. a Data from Aulicino et al. [26].

structure showed for the first time that CRF12_BF
viruses spreading in Argentina and Uruguay constitute a
single epidemic with evidences of multiple genetic
exchanges among countries. In contrast, circulation of
the recently described CRF38_BF [14] seems to be
restricted to Uruguay as no strains with a CRF38_BF-like
pol mosaic pattern were observed after screening of a
large number (n > 300) of BF1 recombinant sequences
from Argentina.
According to our estimates, the mean T mrca of
CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF was 1982-1983 and 19851986, respectively; only a few years later than the mean
estimated onset date of subtype F1 spread in Brazil
(1976-1978) [23,24]. These mean estimates are fully consistent with epidemiological data that revealed that BF1
recombinants related to the CRF12_BF have been in circulation in Argentine children since the mid 1980s [48].
In agreement with this study, we identified five Argentine children born between 1987 and 1989 infected by
CRF12-like BF viruses, and one Uruguayan child born in
1987 infected by a CRF38-like BF strain.
Our study showed that the substitution rate of
CRF12_BF viruses at pol gene (2.5 × 10 -3 subst./site/
year) is similar to rates previously described for HIV-1
subtypes B, C, and CRF31_BC [38,40,41], pointing to no
major differences in evolution rate among HIV-1 strains
circulating in South America. By contrast, some differences in epidemic growth rate may have existed across
distinct HIV-1 variants circulating in South America.
The estimated initial growth rate of the CRF12_BF epidemic in Argentina and Uruguay was higher than that
described for Brazilian subtype B, C, and F1 epidemics
[23,47], and similar to that recently described for the
CRF31_BC viruses circulating in southern Brazil [47]

(Table 4); supporting the notion of a fast initial spread
of CRF12_BF-like viruses [26]. The initial expansion rate
of CRF38_BF also seems to be higher than those
described for subtypes B and F1, although the 95% HPD
interval of such an estimate was quite large (Table 4).
The rapid initial growth rate of CRF12_BF,
CRF31_BC, and CRF38_BF epidemics in South America
may indicate that these CRFs displayed a higher fitness
and/or transmissibility than parental HIV-1 subtypes.
Alternatively, variations in the initial growth rate of
HIV-1 variants may reflect differences in the susceptible
populations that characterized the initial spread of each
strain. Of note, the BF recombinants have been associated with injection drug use populations in Argentina
and Uruguay [3,5], and introduction of a BF1 recombinant virus in such highly connected networks may
explain the emergence and rapid initial dissemination of
the CRF_BF1 viruses.
After the initial period of fast exponential growth, the
expansion rate of the CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF epidemics slowed down since the mid 1990s. The same
demographic pattern was described for HIV-1 epidemics
in Brazil, USA, and some European countries
[23,38,47,49-51]. Such a recent decline in the growth
rate of these HIV-1 epidemics may be the consequence
of adequate prevention campaigns implemented after
the official report of the first AIDS cases in the early
1980s, and/or the result of a saturation of high-risk
transmission networks that are loosely connected with
low-risk subgroups that exhibit modest levels of HIV-1
infection [52].
The overall demographic pattern of the CRF12_BF
epidemic in Argentina and Uruguay observed in this
study is similar with that previously described for the

Bello et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:22
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/22

CRF12_BF epidemic in Argentine children [26]; and our
mean estimates of Tmrca and population growth rate fell
within the 95% HPD interval of the previous estimates
(Table 4). The confidence intervals of these new estimates, however, were much narrower than those previously obtained (Table 4), indicating that the use of a
larger data set have substantially improved the accuracy
of parameter estimation. In agreement with this idea,
the small CRF38 data set was associated with much larger confidence intervals of demographic parameter estimates than those obtained for the larger CRF12_BF data
set. Thus, more precise estimations of demographic
parameters of CRF38_BF will require the analysis of a
larger number of sequences.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF
viruses were rapidly generated after the introduction of
subtype F1 into South America and have been circulating in the continent over the last 25 years. Both CRFs
seem to have spread exponentially at a fast rate during
the 1980s and the early 1990s; but the rate of spread of
the CRF12_BF and CRF38_BF viruses slowed down
since the mid 1990s. Despite similar emergence dates
and demographic histories, CRF12_BF have been widely
disseminated in Argentina and Uruguay, whereas the
CRF38_BF circulation was found limited to Uruguay.
Determination of the factors that have shaped the pattern and rate of spread of distinct HIV-1 variants in
South America is of paramount importance to understand the epidemic potential of these variants.
