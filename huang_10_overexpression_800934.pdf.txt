Overexpression of PtrABF gene, a bZIP
transcription factor isolated from Poncirus
trifoliata, enhances dehydration and drought
tolerance in tobacco via scavenging ROS and
modulating expression of stress-responsive genes
Xiao-San Huang1, Ji-Hong Liu1*, Xue-Jun Chen2

Abstract
Background: Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting plant growth, development and crop
productivity. ABA responsive element binding factor (ABF) plays an important role in stress responses via regulating
the expression of stress-responsive genes.
Results: In this study, a gene coding for ABF (PtrABF) was isolated from Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. PtrABF had a
complete open reading frame of 1347 bp, encoding a 448 amino acid peptide, and shared high sequence
identities with ABFs from other plants. PtrABF was subcellularly targeted to the nucleus, exhibited transactivation
activity in yeast cell and could bind to ABRE, supporting its role as a transcription factor. Expression levels of PtrABF
were induced by treatments with dehydration, low temperature and ABA. Ectopic expression of PtrABF under the
control of a CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic tobacco plants enhanced tolerance to both dehydration and
drought. Under dehydration and drought conditions, the transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of reactive
oxygen species compared with wild type, accompanied by higher activities and expression levels of three
antioxidant enzymes. In addition, steady-state mRNA levels of nine stress-responsive genes coding for either
functional or regulatory proteins were induced to higher levels in the transgenic lines with or without drought
stress.
Conclusions: PtrABF is a bZIP transcription factor and functions in positive modulation of drought stress tolerance.
It may be an important candidate gene for molecular breeding of drought- tolerant plants.

Background
Plants are frequently threatened by drought that affects
growth and development, productivity and quality [1].
Therefore, improvement of drought tolerance has been
the subject of intense studies via either traditional
breeding or biotechnology-mediated approach. As a first
step towards improvement of drought tolerance via
genetic engineering in plant, genes with functions in
drought tolerance should be cloned and characterized. It

has been established that plants respond and adapt to
drought stress through modifying transcriptional levels
of a large number of genes [2,3]. These genes can be
generally classified into two main groups based on their
products, effector molecules or regulator molecules,
which are also correspondingly designated as delayedresponse genes or early-response genes based on their
response timing [4-6]. Products of the former group
function directly in protecting cells against damage
derived from stresses and sustaining cell viability, and
the latter is composed of regulatory proteins, such as
transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases and protein
phosphatases, that are responsible for transducing stress

signaling and regulating expression of stress-responsive
genes [5].
TF constitutes the key regulon that plays crucial roles
in various biological processes, including stress response,
through binding to the cis-acting element in the promoters of target genes [7]. ABA-responsive element (ABRE,
PyACGTGGC), an important cis-element, is implicated
in the transcriptional regulation of ABA- and/or stressresponsive genes [8]. In plants, ABRE binding factors
(ABFs)/ABRE binding proteins (AREBs) are basic
region/leucine zipper (bZIP) class TFs [9,10] that interact with ABRE. ABF/AREB family TFs have been cloned
and characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana and other
plants [11-15]. In the Arabidopsis genome, nine ABF/
AREB homologues have been identified so far [16,17].
Up-regulation of ABF/AREB family members by various
abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, cold,
anoxia, and by ABA in different plants suggests that
they are involved in ABA and/or stress signaling
[11,12,14,16,17].
TFs are known as master switch in plant stress
response, and genetic transformation of the genes
encoding TFs has been suggested as a possible approach
for engineering stress tolerance as manipulation of a single TF can alter expression of a wide array of target
genes [7]. Genetic transformation of ABF/AREB has
been shown to render stress tolerance. For example,
constitutive overexpression of AREB1/ABF2, ABF3 or
ABF4 in Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced drought tolerance [14,18]. In another work, interestingly, overexpression of ABF2 in Arabidopsis was found to promote
tolerance to drought, high salt, heat and oxidative stresses [19]. Later, ABF/AREB family members have been
transformed into lettuce and Agrostis mongolica, and the
transgenic plants were more tolerant to drought and
cold/heat stresses than wild type [20,21]. All of these
successful examples indicate that genetic manipulation
of ABF/AREB family members can be of significance for
modifying plant stress response [22].
Although ABF/AREB members have been comprehensively studied in the model plants, information concerning their counterparts in woody plants is relatively
lacking. Trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf),
an important rootstock for citrus, is drought intolerant,
which has restricted its use in regions with water deficit.
A raised question is whether or not the ABF homologue
in trifoliate orange can function in stress tolerance. On
the other hand, it was noticed that limited information
is available concerning physiological and/or molecular
basis on enhanced stress tolerance in the transgenic
plants overexpressing an ABF gene in previous reports.
Therefore, we tired to clone an ABF gene from trifoliate
orange, and functionally characterize its role in dehydration/drought tolerance. In addition, accumulation of

reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of stressresponsive genes in the transgenic plants were
illustrated.

Results
Cloning and bioinformatics analysis of PtrABF

Eighteen sequences were found in the search of the
citrus EST database, which were successfully combined
into a contig. RT-PCR using the gene specific primers
(GSP1) designed based on the contig gave rise to a single band. Sequencing and bioinformatics analysis
showed that the cDNA, 1511 bp in length, contained a
1347-bp open reading frame (ORF), along with a 35-bp
5’ untranslated region (UTR) and a 129-bp 3’ UTR. The
cDNA, designated as PtrABF (Poncirus trifoliata ABF),
encodes a predicted polypeptide of 448 amino acids
with a calculated molecular weight of 48 kDa and a pI
of 9.66. This gene has been deposited in NCBI under
the accession number of HM171703. Multiple alignments between PtrABF and eight other ABF proteins
revealed high sequence identity among each other (Figure 1). At the C-terminus of PtrABF there was a bZIP
signature (from position 366 to 424, E-value 3.98e-09)
composed of a 25-amino acid basic region and a leucine
zipper containing three leucine repeats (at positions 396,
403 and 410) that were spaced from each other by
seven amino acids. The proteins had four highly conserved regions, three at the N-terminus (designated as
C1, C2 and C3) and one at the end of C-terminus (C4).
The phylogenetic tree constructed based on amino acid
sequences of PtrABF and ABFs from other 13 representative plants showed that PtrABF was most closely
related to its counterpart of grape, while it is most distant to rice (Figure 2).
Expression pattern of PtrABF under various treatments

In plants, an important feature of ABFs is the induction
of expression by various abiotic stresses. In order to
know if PtrABF acts in the similar way, expression profiles of PtrABF under different treatment (stresses or
ABA) were assessed via QRT-PCR. The transcript level
of PtrABF began to accumulate 1 h after dehydration,
and increased progressively until the end of treatment,
which was more than 13 folds of the initial level (Figure
3A). Steady-state mRNA of PtrABF began to accumulate
5 h after low temperature treatment, and continued to
increase until it reached the highest level at 3 d (Figure
3B). When subjected to salt treatment, the transcript of
PtrABF did not change notably except a slight decrease
at 5 h and 1 d (Figure 3C), indicating that PtrABF was
not salt-inducible. In the case of ABA treatment, mRNA
abundance was first reduced at 1 d, resumed to the
basal level during the next two days, and increased at 4
d and maintained thereafter (Figure 3D).

(NP_849777), AtABF4 (NP_566629). The numbers beside the branches represent bootstrap values based on 1000 replications, and the relative
amount of change along branches is indicated by the scale bar.

PtrABF was localized in the nucleus

Sequence analysis showed that there was a nuclear localization signal (from position 359 to 376) in the basic
region of the bZIP DNA binding domain, implying that
PtrABF may be localized in the nucleus. In order to verify this, subcellular localization of PtrABF was examined
by monitoring the GFP fluorescence in the onion epidermis cells transformed with either the fusion construct (PtrABF-GFP) or the control (GFP). When onion
cells were transformed with GFP plasmid, green fluorescence signals were observed in the entire cell region
(Figure 4A-C). In contrast, fluorescence was exclusively
detected in the nucleus of cells transformed with the
fusion plasmid (Figure 4D-F), implying that PtrABF is a
nuclear protein.
PtrABF had transactivation activity and could bind to
ABRE

Transactivation activity is another defining feature for a
transcription factor in addition to nuclear localization.
To identify if PtrABF functions as a transcriptional

activator the yeast two-hybrid analysis was used. For
this purpose, the full-length PtrABF coding region was
fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 to generate
a fusion plasmid, which was transformed into yeast and
growth of the cells was compared with those transformed with the control plasmid (pGBKT7) on the same
medium. Yeast cells carrying either the control plasmid
or the fusion plasmid grew well on SD/-Leu/-Trp medium, indicating that the analysis system was reliable. On
the SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp medium, the cells transformed with the control plasmid could not grow,
whereas those transformed with the fusion plasmid grew
normally. The yeast cells transformed with the fusion
plasmid could also live on the medium added with 3AT, but the growth was repressed in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 5A). In addition, when the
yeast cells were cultured on the SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/Trp medium added with both 15 mM 3-AT and 20 mM
X-a-Gal, only those transformed with the fusion plasmid turned blue (Figure 5B). All of these results indicated that PtrABF had transactivation activity in yeast.

Previous work showed that ABF can bind to the ciselement ABRE [8]. In order to investigate whether
PtrABF has the same DNA-binding activity, the full
length ORF of PtrABF was fused to the GAL4 activation
domain of vector pGADT7 and the fused construct
(pGADT7-PtrABF) was co-transformed with pHISABRE construct containing triple tandem repeats of
ABRE into yeast strain Y187 (Figure 5C). Although all
of the yeast cells with different constructs could grow
on SD/Leu-/Trp-/His medium without 3-AT, only the
cells co-transformed with pGADT7-PtrABF and pHISABRE grew normally in the presence of 3-AT, while the
growth of transformants containing constructs lacking
either PtrABF or ABRE was completely inhibited (Figure
5D), suggesting that PtrABF could bind to the ABRE
and activate the reporter gene in yeast.

Overexpression of PtrABF enhances tolerance to
dehydration and drought

To investigate the function of PtrABF, Agrobacteriummediated transformation of tobacco leaf discs was carried out using a binary vector containing PtrABF under
the control of 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus
(CaMV 35S). Totally, 9 T0 lines were characterized by
PCR with primers specific to CaMV 35S and PtrABF
and NPTII, and 7 out of them were confirmed as putative transgenic lines, and overexpression of PtrABF in
two lines (#4 and #19) was verified by semi-quantitative
RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). These two lines and
wild type (WT) were subjected to dehydration and
drought treatment to investigate the role of PtrABF in
water stress response. No morphological difference was
noted between the transgenic lines and WT (data not

shown). When the aerial parts of 5-week-old in vitro
seedlings were dehydrated, fresh water loss was
increased in the two transgenic lines and WT with the
progressing of dehydration. However, significantly
higher water loss was observed in WT than the two
transgenic lines from 10 min onwards (Figure 6A).
Although #19 lost less water than #4, the difference was
not statistically significant except at 60 and 90 min after
dehydration. Electrolyte leakage of #4 was equal to that
of #19, both of which were significantly smaller than
WT (Figure 6B). When dehydration was completed,
leaves of WT exhibited more serious wilting relative to
the transgenic lines (Figure 6C).
Apart from dehydration, long-term water stress
(drought) tolerance of the potted plants was also examined by water withholding. Morphological difference
became apparent after watering was stopped for 7 d,
when WT lost its turgor while #4 and #19 grew better
(Figure 7A). When the drought was extended to as long
as 3 weeks, phonotypical difference was more dramatic
between WT and the transgenic plants, as manifested by
presence of more dead leaves in the former (Figure 7B).
Electrolyte leakage of #4 (16.7%) and #19 (22.3%) was
significantly lower in comparison with 42.3% of wile

type (Figure 7C), whereas total chlorophyll of the transgenic lines (3.65 μg g-1 FW for #4 and 4.13 μg g-1 FW
for #19) was significantly higher than WT (2.42 μg g-1
FW, Figure 7D). The above results showed that the two
transgenic lines were more tolerant to short-term dehydration shock or long-term water stress (drought).
Accumulation of O2- and H2O2 in the transgenic lines and
WT under drought

As the transgenic lines were more tolerant to dehydration and drought than wild type, attempts were made to
compare accumulation of H2O2 and O2-, two main reactive oxygen species (ROS), in their leaves sampled at the
end of water stress. For this purpose, leaves of the transgenic lines and wild type that have been either dehydrated for 90 min or exposed to drought for 21 d were
stained with DAB or NBT to reveal in situ accumulation
of H2O2 and O2-, respectively. Histochemically staining
showed that before dehydration, H2 O2 and O2 - could
also be stained, and the transgenic lines had slightly
lower ROS levels relative to WT. Dehydration resulted
in notable increased of ROS levels in both wild type and
the two transgenic lines, whereas WT accumulated
remarkably more O2- and H2O2 than both #4 and #19,

as less blue (Figure 8A) or brown (Figure 8B) products
were observed in the latter two. Similarly, under drought
the two transgenic lines accumulated dramatically less
O2- and H2O2 than WT (Figure 8C), implying that less
ROS was produced in the transgenic lines under the
stressful conditions.
Analysis of activity of antioxidant enzymes and
expression levels of the encoding genes in transgenic
lines and WT before and after drought

The above-mentioned results demonstrated that the two
transgenic lines produced less ROS compared with WT
when they were simultaneously stressed. As ROSscavenging enzymes play critical role in detoxifying ROS
activities of three key enzymes, superoxide (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), were measured in the
two transgenic lines and WT before and 7 d after
drought. Before water stress, activities of the three
enzymes were higher than those of the control, but the
difference was not prominent. Water stress caused
decrease of SOD activity, which was significantly lower
in WT than in #4 and #19 (Figure 9A). Exposure to
drought resulted in slight rise of POD activity in WT,

which was notably enhanced in the two transgenic lines.
As a result, POD activity of #4 and #19 was 1.5 and 3
folds of that in WT, respectively (Figure 9B). Activity of
CAT was augmented in all of the tested samples, while
the transgenic lines had significantly higher activities
than WT (Figure 9C). All of these showed that activities
of the three detoxifying enzyme were higher in the
transgenic lines than WT, in reverse proportion to the
ROS accumulation of these lines. Examination of the
genes encoding SOD, CAT and APX showed that before
water stress the expression levels of the three genes
were higher in the transgenic lines than in WT. Exposure to drought led to induction of these genes in both
WT and the transgenic plants, whereas the transcript
levels were still higher in the latter except NtAPX
in #19.
Expression analysis of stress-responsive genes before and
after drought

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to assess expression
levels of nine stress-responsive genes in both WT and
the transgenic lines under normal conditions and after
7-d water stress (Figure 10). In the absence of water

plants. However, it is noticeable that steady state mRNA
levels of the genes in the two transgenic lines were still
higher than WT, particularly NtADC2, NtLEA5,
NtERD10C and NtDREB. These data indicated that
overexpression of PtrABF in tobacco led to change in
the transcript levels of endogenous stress-related genes.

Discussion
It has been well documented that upon exposure to
abiotic stresses transcript levels of a multitude of genes

are altered. Numerous studies have shown that ABFs/
AREBs play significant roles in regulating these stressrelated genes via interaction with ABRE cis-element in
their promoters, suggesting that ABFs/AREBs are tightly
involved in plant response to various adverse environment conditions. In this work, a gene encoding ABF

Page 10 of 18

from P. trifoliata was isolated by RT-PCR in combination with bioinformatics approach based on ESTs deposited in the public database. Sequence multiple alignment
demonstrated that PtrABF showed high degree of
sequence identity with ABFs of other plants retrieved
from the database at amino acid level. A highly conserved bZIP domain consisting of a basic region responsible for DNA binding and three heptad leucine repeats
related to TF dimerization [23] was observed near the
C-terminus of PtrABF, indicating that PtrABF encoded a
bZIP family protein. Apart from the bZIP domain, it
also contained four highly conserved regions at the N or
C-terminus (C1, C2, C3 and C4). Within these regions,
several serine (S) and threonine (T) residues or consensus sequences are present, consistent with the structure
of ABFs from other plants [11,12]. These conserved residues have been suggested as phosphorylation sites of
different kinases, such as calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (R/KXXS/T, position 28-31) and casein kinase
II (S/TXXD/E, position 36-39), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (K/RXXXS/T, position 49-53), implying that
activation of PtrABF might be regulated by protein
phosphorylation, as has been reported in other AREBs/
ABFs [12,15,24,25]. Presence of these common characteristics demonstrated that PtrABF cloned in our study
shared striking sequence similarity with other ABFs and
may have a biological function same as or similar to
them in abiotic stress response. The phylogenetic tree
revealed relationship between PtrABF and ABFs from
other plants, in which PtrABF was closely related to
ABFs from dicots, including the ABFs of Arabidopsis
thaliana. Although most ABFs in the tree remain to be
characterized, in planta functions of ABFs of Arabidopsis have been determined, in which ABF3 and ABF4 act
as activators of ABA/stress response. In addition, overexpression of ABF2, ABF3 has been shown to affect
multiple stress tolerance, implying that PtrABF might
function in the same way as ABFs of Arabidopsis.
An important feature of plant ABFs is the induction of
their transcript levels by abiotic stresses [8,11,12,16].
QRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that steady state
mRNA levels of PtrABF were induced by ABA, dehydration and low temperature. Expression patterns of
PtrABF were largely similar to ABF4/AREB2 that has
been shown to be induced by ABA, salt, cold and
drought [11]. However, it has to be mentioned that
PtrABF was not induced by salt, different from ABF4. In
Arabiopsis it has been shown that although ABFs were
all induced by ABA, they are differentially regulated by
various stresses and have been suggested to play various
roles in stress response [11]. ABF family members might
have specificity in their role under different stresses
apart from existence of function redundancy, in which
ABF3 and ABF4 played essential roles in germination

Huang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:230

control and ABA/stress response, whereas ABF2 was
more closely implicated in seedling growth regulation
and glucose response [8,13]. Induction of PtrABF by
both dehydration and low temperature seems to indicate
that this gene may participate in response to these cues.
Compared with low temperature, dehydration caused
more profound induction of PtrABF mRNA abundance,
which compelled us to do in-depth work on elucidation
of the potential role of this gene for enhancing dehydration and drought tolerance. To this end, transgenic
tobacco plants were produced via Agrobacteriummediated transformation of PtrABF under the control of
CaMV 35S promoter. The two selected transgenic lines
exhibited better phenotypic morphology, concomitant
with less water loss, lower electrolyte leakage and higher
chlorophyll content than wild type under either dehydration or long-term water stress, suggesting that overexpression of PtrABF conspicuously conferred tolerance
to these adverse conditions. Apart from the water stress
used herein, the transgenic plants also exhibited
enhanced tolerance to low temperature treatment in
comparison with WT (data not shown). Our work
agreed with earlier reports, in which overexpression of
ABF family members has been shown to render tolerance to multiple stresses in the same transgenic line
[13,19-21,26], implying that ABFs class transcription factors hold great potential for genetically manipulating
stress tolerance.
Despite the fact transformation of ABF genes led to
improvement of abiotic stress tolerance, the physiological mechanism underling the tolerance remained largely
unknown. This stimulated us to carry out more work to
find out physiological difference between the transgenic
plants and WT under stress. We put special emphasis
on comparing their ROS levels because it has been well
accepted that in biological systems ROS accumulation is
related to physiological perturbation and ROS levels can
reflect the degree of damage to cellular components
[27]. Histochemical staining by DAB and NBT clearly
demonstrated that under dehydration and drought conditions the two transgenic lines accumulated remarkably
less O2- and H2O2 than WT. As ROS level during stresses greatly relies on the homeostasis between generation
and removal [27], accumulation of less ROS in the
transgenic lines seems to indicate that scavenging systems in these plants might work more effectively compared with WT. In order to detoxify stress-induced
ROS, plants evolve a complex antioxidant system, in
which several enzymes play essential roles, leading to
scavenging ROS and protecting the cells against oxidative stress [27,28]. Of the enzymes, SOD provides the
first line of defense against ROS by catalyzing the dismutation of O2- to oxygen and H2O2, which was then
scavenged by coordinated action of CAT and POD [29].

Page 11 of 18

In our study, activities of SOD, POD and CAT in the
two transgenic lines were not profoundly different from
those of wild type under well-watering conditions
although they were slightly higher in the transgenic
lines, which sounds reasonable because under normal
conditions ROS production remained at low levels and
oxidative stress was not serious [27]. However, under
water stress, activities of the three enzymes were significantly higher in the transgenic plants than WT, implying that the transgenic plants had more robust
detoxifying system to eliminate ROS produced during
stress, which is consistent with the dramatic reduction
of ROS level and ROS-associated membrane damage
(lower electrolyte leakage). It is noticed that activation
of antioxidant enzymes was consistent with the upregulation of the three genes, suggesting that these enzymes
may be regulated at transcriptional levels. Induction of
genes involved in ROS scavenging has been previously
reported when TF was ectopically expressed [30], suggesting that the TF might transcriptionally regulate the
expression of genes related to oxidative reactions. Our
work suggested that deployment of a better ROSscavenging system might be an integral part of defense
against drought in the transgenic plants expressing
PtrABF.
To cope with unfavorable environmental constraints
plants modulate the expression of a large spectrum of
stress-responsive genes, constituting an important molecular basis for the response and adaptation of plants to
stresses [22,31,32]. In order to understand regulatory
function of PtrABF and to explain the enhanced drought
tolerance at molecular levels, transcript levels of nine
stress-responsive genes were monitored before and after
drought treatment, including five genes encoding functional proteins (NtADC1, NtADC2, NtSAMDC,
NtERD10C and NtLEA5) and four encoding regulatory
proteins (NtAREB, NtCDPK2, NtDREB and NtERF),
which or whose homologues in other plants have been
shown to be involved in abiotic stress response. RT-PCR
analysis showed that steady-state mRNA levels of these
genes were higher in the transgenic plants compared
with those of WT in the absence of water stress, in line
with earlier reports in which overexpression of a TF
resulted in extensive alteration of transcript levels of an
arsenal of related genes [33,34]. Although expression
levels of all of the tested genes were upregulated by
drought, they were still higher in the transgenic plants
than in WT, indicating that these genes were more
intensely induced in the transgenic lines. NtADC1,
NtADC2 and NtSAMDC are genes involved in biosynthesis of polyamines, which are low-molecular-weight
polycations and have been shown to be important stress
molecules [35,36]. Polyamines function in stress adaptation by acting as osmoticum regulator or membrane

Huang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:230
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/230

stabilizer through binding to macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids and phospholipids of plasma membrane [37,38]. More drastic induction of these genes
implied that the transgenic plants might synthesize
higher levels of polyamines to prevent them from lethal
injury and maintain better growth under water stress
[39]. On the other hand, polyamines have been also proposed to act as free radical scavengers [40], and the larger induction of the polyamine biosynthetic genes
agreed with lower ROS accumulation in the transgenic
plants after drought stress. NtLEA5 and NtERD10C
encode hydrophilic late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)
proteins that are assumed to play critical roles in combating cellular dehydration [41]. Higher expression levels
of these genes suggested that the transgenic plants
might provide more chaperones for various substrates
and maintain membrane integrity or efficiently bind
water, which are important strategies for plants to sustain growth during drought [41,42]. Induction of these
functional genes to higher levels suggested that the
transgenic plants might synthesize more protective compounds (polyamines) or proteins (LEA), which, along
with others that were not identified herein, provided
better adaptive or defensive niches against water stress,
leading to alleviation of cellular damage when they were
subjected to drought. Upregulation of the above genes
suggests that they might be transcriptionally regulated
by PtrABF through binding of the cis-element ABRE in
their promoter. Although we could not provide evidence
for this speculation, ABRE has been discovered in the
promoter of most genes encoding LEA proteins [41]
and in AtADC2 and AtSAMDC2 of Arabidopsis [43]. In
addition to the functional genes, it is noted that the
NtCDPK2 and NtDREB were also induced to higher
levels in the transgenic lines with or without drought
stress, while NtERF and NtAREB were only slightly
induced upon water stress. Induction of their mRNA to
higher levels raised the possibility of interaction between
them and PtrABF in order to orchestrate well-defined
stress tolerance machinery that functions in protection
of the plants against adverse environment. Interestingly,
the expression patterns of NtCDPK2 and NtDREB were
largely consistent with those of the functional genes
before and after water stress. NtCDPK2 and NtDREB
are important regulatory molecules involved in signal
transduction or transcriptional regulation during stress
conditions [4,5,44,45]. These genes may act as the intermediates between PtrABF and the aforementioned functional genes. In this case, PtrABF might function to
facilitate transcriptional upregulation of these endogenous regulatory genes, which in turn activated their
downstream target genes, including those mentioned
above. In the future, extra work is needed to decipher
the connection between these genes so as to gain more

insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying
PtrABF function in water stress tolerance.

Conclusions
A class-A bZIP transcription factor encoding PtrABF
has been successfully isolated from P. trifoliata, which
was induced by dehydration, low temperature and ABA.
PtrABF was confirmed as a transcription factor due to
subcellular localization in the nucleus, presence of transactivation activity and binding with ABRE.
Overexpression of PtrABF in tobacco enhanced tolerance to dehydration shock and long term water stress
(drought). The tolerance may be ascribed to more robust
activation of ROS scavenging system and coordinated
and timely activation of an array of stress-responsive
genes at molecular level, leading to synthesis of a wide
range of protective compounds and proteins. These strategies may act in cooperation to render a more protective
line of defence against the water stress.
The results presented here demonstrate that overexpression of PtrABF significantly modified drought tolerance in the transgenic plants, indicating that PtrABF
might be a candidate gene with potential application to
enhance abiotic stress tolerance.
Methods
Plant materials and stress treatments

Eight-month-old plants grown in the seedling beds at
National Center of Citrus Breeding, Huazhong Agricultural
University, were used to isolate the gene and to examine
the gene expression patterns under different treatment.
Uniform and healthy shoots were excised from the plants
and inserted in a flask containing distilled water, which
were kept for 1 d in a growth chamber at 25°C with 16-h
light/8-h dark photoperiod (45 μmol m-2 s-1) before exposure to the following treatment. For dehydration treatment,
the shoots were placed on filter papers (90 × 90 mm) and
allowed to dry for 0, 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 h. Low-temperature
stress was imposed by transferring the shoots to 4°C for 0,
5, 24, 48 and 72 h. For salt or ABA treatment, the shoots
were transferred to beakers containing fresh distilled water
added with either 200 mM NaCl or 100 μM ABA, kept in
the same growth chamber for designated time (0, 5, 24, 48
and 72 h for salt, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 d for ABA). For each
treatment, a minimum of 30 shoots were used, and leaves
were sampled from three randomly selected shoots at each
time point and mixed as a material pool. The leaves from
all of the treatments were frozen immediately in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use for RNA extraction.
Cloning and bioinformatics analysis of PtrABF

In silico search against HarvEST http://harvest.ucr.edu,
used as a primary sequence data set, was performed to
get sequences that can be merged into one contig. In

Huang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:230
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/230

order to amplify a full-length cDNA encoding ABF, total
RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent from leaves
sampled from the shoots dehydrated for 6 h. After treatment with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) to remove genomic DNA contamination, 1 μg of
total RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA with
First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan)
following the manufacturer’s instructions, which was
then used for RT-PCR to amplify the gene. Unless otherwise stated, PCR reaction in this research consisted of
100 ng cDNA, 1 × reaction buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25
mM dNTP, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas)
and 0.5 μM of each primer designed based on the
assembled contig (GSP1, Table 1) in a total volume of
25 μl. The PCR programme consisted of a 5-min incubation at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at
60°C, and 90 s at 72°C, followed by a 15-min extension at
72°C. The PCR product was sub-cloned into the pMD18T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) to get pMD18-TPtrABF and sequenced (UnitedGene, Shanghai, China).
cDNA and protein sequences were analyzed using the
BLAST algorithm, and multiple alignments of the
deduced amino acid sequence were performed using the
ClustalW program. A phylogenetic relationship tree was
constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using
MEGA (version 4.0). Theoretical isoelectric point (pI)
and molecular weight were also identified by tools in an
internet server, ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System,
http://www.expasy.org/tools). Prediction of the bZIP
domain was performed on SMART (Simple Modular
Architecture Research Tool, http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), a web-based protein database.
Analysis of the gene expression by quantitative real-time
PCR (QRT-PCR)

QRT-PCR was performed according to [46] in order to
evaluate expression levels of PtrABF under different
treatment. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis of the
collected samples were performed as mentioned above.
Each 10 μl of PCR reaction contained 5 μl 2×SYBR
Green RealMasterMix (Applied Biosystems), 50 ng
cDNA, and 0.4 μM of each primer specific for PtrABF
(GSP2, Table 1), while Actin gene (Table 1) was used as
internal control for expression normalization. QRT-PCR
was performed in an ABI 7500 Real Time System (PE
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with following PCR program, 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 57 (GSP2)/58
(Actin)°C for 1 min. Each sample was amplified in four
independent replicates.
Subcellular localization of PtrABF

The full-length ORF of PtrABF was amplified by PCR
from pMD18-T-PtrABF with primers containing either

Page 13 of 18

BamHI or XhoI restriction site (GSP3, Table 1), and the
amplicon was ligated into pMD18-T to get pMD18-TB/
X-PtrABF. The GFP (AAB47998) coding region was PCR
amplified from the pMD18-T vector with BamHI-KpnI
linker primers (GFP-GSP1, Table 1), and cloned into
the BamHI and KpnI sites of pMD18-TB/X-PtrABF, generating a recombinant construct of PtrABF-GFP, which
was then inserted into the XhoI and KpnI cloning sites
of a pBI121 vector (a kind gift of Dr. Junhong Zhang) to
produce a fusion construct (pBI121-PtrABF-GFP) under
the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. After verification by sequencing, the fusion construct and control
vector (pBI121-GFP, provided by Dr. Junhong Zhang)
were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
EHA105 by heat shock. Transformation of onion epidermal cells was done based on a previous method [47] and
the onion cells were cultured on MS medium [48] for 2
d, followed by observation of transient expression of
GFP with a universal fluorescence microscope (Olympus
BX61).
Transcriptional activation and ABRE binding assay of
PtrABF in yeast

The transactivation experiment was carried out according to the manual of Matchmaker™ Two-Hybrid System
3 (Clotech, USA). PCR amplification of pMD18-TPtrABF was carried out with a pair of specific primers
(GSP4, in which BamHI and NcoI restriction sites were
introduced), and the PCR product was double digested
by NcoI and BamHI. The resultant fragment containing
PtrABF (PtrABF N/B ) was purified and subcloned into
downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of vector pGBKT7 linearized with NcoI and BamHI to get a
fusion construct (pGBKT7-PtrABF). This construct and
pGBKT7, used as a negative control, were separately
transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech).
The transformants were streaked on the SD/-Trp or
SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp medium supplemented with
different concentration of 3-AT (0, 5 and 15 mM) and
incubated at 30°C for 4 d, followed by evaluation of
growth status of the transformants. In addition, the cells
were also cultured on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu medium
added with both 15 mM 3-AT and 20 mM X-a-Gal for
examination of b-galactosidase activity (Clontech).
A yeast one-hybrid assay (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was
used to investigate if PtrABF bound to ABRE. For this
purpose, PtrABFN/B mentioned above was fused to the
GAL4 activation domain in the vector pGADT7 digested
with BamHI and NcoI to get pGAD-PtrABF. A 42-bp oligonucleotide sequence containing three tandem repeat
copies of 5’-GGACACGTGGCG-3’ (ABRE is underlined)
and restriction sites of EcoRI and SacI was synthesized
and cloned into multiple cloning sites upstream from the

HIS3 minimal promoter in the pHIS2 expression vector
that had been digested with EcoRI and SacI to get the
reporter vector pHIS2-ABRE. Both pGADT7-PtrABF and
pHIS2-ABRE were co-transformed into yeast strain Y187,
while pGADT7/pHIS2-ABRE and pGADT7-PtrABF/
pHIS2 were also co-transformed as negative controls.
The cells were cultured on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp plates
with or without 3-AT to identify the DNA-protein
interaction.
Transformation of tobacco and regeneration of transgenic
plants

pMD18-T-PtrABF was restricted with SalI and KpnI,
and the resulting product was inserted into XhoI-KpnI
sites of the binary vector pBI121 to generate pBI121PtrABF, which was introduced into A. tumefaciens strain
EHA105 by heat shock after fidelity verification by
sequencing. Seeds of Nicotiana nudicaulis were sterilized for 20 s in 70% (v/v) ethanol and incubated in
2.5% (v/v) H2O2 for 7 min, followed by rinse with sterile
distilled water for four times before they were sown on
germination medium (GM) containing MS salts, 30 g l-1
sucrose and 0.75% agar (pH 5.7). Seventy-day-old seedlings were used for transformation based on a leaf disc
transformation method [49]. The infected explants were
co-cultivated on GM added with 2.0 mg l-1 6-BA and
0.3 mg l -1 NAA for 3 d at 25°C in the dark, and then
transferred on selection medium (GM, 2.0 mg l-1 6-BA,
0.3 mg l -1 NAA, 50 mg l -1 kanamycin and 400 mg l -1
cefotaxime). After selection for 30 d, the kanamycinresistant shoots were shifted to fresh selection medium
for further screening, and the resistant shoots were
transferred to rooting medium (GM, 0.3 mg l -1 NAA,
50 mg l-1 kanamycin, 400 mg l-1 cefotaxime) to induce
roots. Presence of the transgene in the kanamycinresistant seedlings was confirmed by PCR as described
below. Putative transgenic T0 plants were maintained in
a growth chamber with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod at 25°C until they flowered and set seeds to select
homozygous lines [50].
Confirmation of the transgenic plants by PCR

Genomic DNA was extracted from T0 in vitro seedlings
and wild type using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-based method. PCR reaction solution was
the same as that of RT-PCR except the use of DNA
template and primers specific to both NPTII gene and
CaMV35S and PtrABF (Table 1). Amplifications were
performed at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of
94°C for 45 s, 60 (35S-PtrABF)/56 (NPTII)°C for 45 s,
72°C for 1-2 min, and a final 15-min extension at 72°C.
PCR products were electrophoresesed on 1.0% (w/v)
agarose gel containing 0.5 μg l-1 ethidium bromide and
visualized under UV transillumination.

Dehydration shock and drought tolerance of the
transgenic plants

Seeds of the transgenic lines and wild type were sterilized and sown on germination medium as mentioned
above. Some of the in vitro seedlings were subjected to
dehydration and the others were transplanted to soil
pots in a growth chamber for drought treatment. For
dehydration analysis, the aerial parts of 35-d-old in vitro
seedlings of each line were put on clean filter papers
and allowed to dry for up to 90 min. Fresh weight of
the samples was measured every 10 min to determine
the rate of water loss relative to the initial value. Electrolyte leakage and accumulation of O2- and H 2O 2 in
the leaves at the last time point were examined as
described below.
The seedlings used for drought treatment were kept
on flat-bottom trays to grow for 4 months with regular
irrigation prior to withholding water for 21 d. Electrolyte leakage and total chlorophyll content of the plants
exposed to drought for 7 d were measured, while leaves
sampled at the onset of and 7 d after drought were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C
until use for analysis of enzyme activity and gene
expression. Accumulation of O2- and H2O2 in the plants
subjected to 21-d water stress was examined.
Measurement of electrolyte leakage (EL) and total
chlorophyll content

EL was measured according to [51] with slight modification. The collected leaves were stripped and placed in
25 ml distilled water, shaken on a gyratory shaker (200
rpm) at room temperature for 2 h, and the initial conductivity (C1) was measured with a conductivity meter
(DSS-307, Shanghai, China). The samples were then
boiled for 10 min to induce maximum leakage. After
cooling down at room temperature electrolyte conductivity (C2) was measured, and the relative electrolyte
leakage (C%) was calculated based on 100 × C1/C2.
Total chlorophyll was extracted and assayed as
described previously [52]. About 0.1 g fine powder of
leaf tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of 80% acetone and
kept for 15 min at room temperature in dark. The
crude extraction was centrifuged for 20 min at 10000 i
(room temperature), and the resultant supernatant was
used for assessing absorbance at 663, 645 and 480 nm
with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1600, Japan),
and total chlorophyll content was computed in terms of
fresh weight (FW).
In situ histochemical localization of O2- and H2O2

In situ accumulation of O 2 - and H 2 O 2 was examined
based on histochemical staining by nitroblue tetrazolium
(NBT) and 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB), respectively
[39]. For O2- detection, the leaves from both wild type

Huang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:230
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/230

and the transgenic plants were immersed in 1 mg ml-1
fresh NBT solution (prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.8) at ambient temperature until appearance of
dark spots. For detection of H 2 O 2 , the leaves were
inserted into 1 mg ml -1 fresh DAB solution (pH 3.8)
prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) and incubated in light until brown spots were observed. The
stained leaves were then bleached in concentrated ethanol, and kept in 70% ethanol.
Measurement of activity of antioxidant enzymes

For extraction of peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7), catalase
(CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC
1.15.1.1), about 0.5 g of leaf sample was ground in liquid
nitrogen with pre-cooled pestle and mortar, and homogenized in 5 ml of extraction buffer containing 50 mM
phosphate buffer (pH7.8) and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone.
The homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min
at 4°C and the resulting supernatant was collected for
enzyme activity analysis. Activities of SOD, expressed as
unit (U) ml-1 , were spectrophotometrically measured
using SOD Detection Kit (A001, Jiancheng, Nanjing,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
POD activity, expressed as U mg -1 FW, was assayed
according to [39] with slight modification. The assay
mixture in a final volume of 3.0 ml, which contained 1
ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 ml of 0.3%
H 2 O 2 , 0.95 ml of 0.2% guaiacol and 50 μl of enzyme
extract, was incubated for 3 min at 34°C. Activity of
POD was determined based on the increase in absorbance read at 470 nm, and one unit of POD activity was
defined as the increase of absorbance by 0.01 per min.
CAT activity was measured by the depletion of H2O2 at
240 nm [53]. The sample solution was composed of
0.1% H2O2, 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 100
μl enzyme extract in a total volume of 3 ml. The CAT
activity, expressed as U g-1 FW, was assessed by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm as a consequence of H 2 O 2 consumption, and one unit of CAT
activity was defined as reduction of the absorbance by
0.01 per min.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for analysis of gene expression

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to examine overexpression of the transgene (PtrABF) in the transgenic lines,
and to monitor transcriptional levels of nine stress-responsive genes, including NtADC1 (AF127239.1), NtADC2
(7230374), NtSAMDC (AB304782.1), NtLEA5 (AF053076),
NtERD10C (AB049337.1), NtERF (AY655738.1), NtCDPK2
(AJ344156.1), NtDREB(EU727157.1), NtAREB (BAB61098),
and three genes encoding the antioxidant enzymes, NtCAT
(U93244.1), NTAPX (U15933.1, as gene coding for POD
was not retrieved, it was used as a substitute) and NtSOD

(AB093097). Extraction of total RNA and cDNA synthesis
of the samples collected before and after drought treatment were done as described for cloning of PtrABF. Genespecific primers for PtrABF (GSP5, Table 1) and the stressrelated genes were designed by Primer 5.0 based on the
public sequences (Table 1). RT-PCR amplification of each
gene was performed using 100 ng of cDNA as a template
and two corresponding specific primers with the following
program, an initial 5 min denaturing at 94°C, 31 cycles of
30 s at 94°C, 40 s at 58°C, 40 s at 72°C, and a 10-min
extension at 72°C. As an internal control to show that
equal amounts of total RNA has been loaded, the cDNAs
were also amplified with a pair of tobacco Tubulin gene
primers (Table 1) with the same procedure. Detection of
amplification products followed the procedure for PCR of
genomic DNA. RT-PCR was repeated three times to
ensure reliability of the data. In order to compare the
expression difference quantitatively, expression level of the
nine stress-responsive gene was normalized to the Tubulin
gene by densitometric quantitative analysis using a software (Quantity One 4.6.2). Expression level of WT at the
onset of water stress was set to 1, and those of the other
samples were quantified accordingly.
Statistical analysis

Dehydration and drought treatment of the transgenic
lines and WT were repeated at least twice with three
replicates for each line with consistent results, and the
results of a representative experiment were presented,
shown as mean ± SE. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) by SAS software (version 8.0,
SAS Institute, NC, USA), and statistical difference was
compared based on Fisher’s LSD test.
