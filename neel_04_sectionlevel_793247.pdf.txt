Abstract
Background: The North American Agalinis are representatives of a taxonomically difficult group
that has been subject to extensive taxonomic revision from species level through higher subgeneric designations (e.g., subsections and sections). Previous presentations of relationships have
been ambiguous and have not conformed to modern phylogenetic standards (e.g., were not
presented as phylogenetic trees). Agalinis contains a large number of putatively rare taxa that have
some degree of taxonomic uncertainty. We used DNA sequence data from three chloroplast genes
to examine phylogenetic relationships among sections within the genus Agalinis Raf. (=Gerardia), and
between Agalinis and closely related genera within Orobanchaceae.
Results: Maximum likelihood analysis of sequences data from rbcL, ndhF, and matK gene regions
(total aligned length 7323 bp) yielded a phylogenetic tree with high bootstrap values for most
branches. Likelihood ratio tests showed that all but a few branch lengths were significantly greater
than zero, and an additional likelihood ratio test rejected the molecular clock hypothesis.
Comparisons of substitution rates between gene regions based on linear models of pairwise
distance estimates between taxa show both ndhF and matK evolve more rapidly than rbcL, although
the there is substantial rate heterogeneity within gene regions due in part to rate differences among
codon positions.
Conclusions: Phylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of Agalinis, including species formerly
in Tomanthera, and this group is sister to a group formed by the genera Aureolaria, Brachystigma,
Dasistoma, and Seymeria. Many of the previously described sections within Agalinis are polyphyletic,
although many of the subsections appear to form natural groups. The analysis reveals a single
evolutionary event leading to a reduction in chromosome number from n = 14 to n = 13 based on
the sister group relationship of section Erectae and section Purpureae subsection Pedunculares.
Our results establish the evolutionary distinctiveness of A. tenella from the more widespread and
common A. obtusifolia. However, further data are required to clearly resolve the relationship
between A. acuta and A. tenella.

Background
Agalinis (including Tomanthera Raf.) is a genus of from 40
to 70 species (depending on the taxonomy used) distributed in the eastern part of the United States, Mexico, Central America and South America. The name Agalinis is
preferred to the older name Gerardia because the latter
name was first applied to another taxon (now known as
Stenandrium rupestre [Swartz] Nees) that is now a member
of the family Acanthaceae [1,2]. Members of the genus
Agalinis have zygomorphic, membranaceous, ephemeral
corollas and wingless seeds with variously reticulate seed
coats [3-6]. Beyond the above characteristics, life form,
morphology, anatomy and floral form and color are variable in the genus, particularly in South America [6-9].
Unfortunately, South American taxa are relatively poorly
known, are not included in any published classification
schemes for the genus, and are not included in this study.
The North American Agalinis species are less variable and
all have pink-purple, membranaceous, ephemeral corollas, typically with red spots on the anterior lobes. Most
species also have two yellow guide lines on the anterior
lobes. Except for one perennial species (A. linifolia), North
American Agalinis are all annual herbs and all except three
species (A. auriculata, A. densiflora, and A. heterophylla)
have linear to filiform or scale-like leaves. Many species
are hemiparasitic; in fact, Agalinis represents the largest
genus of hemiparasitic plants in the eastern United States.
Mating systems within the genus range from self incompatible in A. strictifolia [10], to mixed mating in A. acuta
[11] and A. skinneriana [12], to highly selfing in A. neoscotica [13]. Most North American species are restricted to the
coastal plain of the southern and eastern United States
where they occupy a range of habitats including dry,
sandy pine barrens, grasslands, and edges of wetlands
including bogs, ponds, and salt marshes [3,4,14]. Off the
coastal plain Agalinis species are also found in prairie habitats, other grasslands, and open habitats within shrublands or woodlands.
The North American Agalinis are representatives of a taxonomically difficult group that has been subject to extensive taxonomic revision from species level through higher
sub-generic (e.g., subsections and sections) and generic
designations. Two species currently in Agalinis (A. auriculata, and A. densiflora) have been considered to be in the
genus Tomanthera [3,4]. Early species circumscriptions of,
and relationships among, North American Agalinis taxa
were originally postulated based on morphological and
anatomical characteristics (Table 1) [2-4,14,15]; however,
presentations of relationships were ambiguous and did
not conform to modern phylogenetic standards. More
recently, extensive studies of seed morphology [5], seedling morphology [16], floral development [17-20], chromosome cytology [21,22], as well as stem and leaf

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/15

anatomy [23] have been used to clarify taxonomy (Table
1). While this body of work has served to revise classifications, explicit phylogenetic presentations are still lacking
and only general notions of relationships (primarily section and subsection membership) within the genus have
been postulated. Our research provides the first examination of DNA sequence characters within this genus and
provides the first explicit hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships. We used DNA sequence data from
three chloroplast genes to examine phylogenetic relationships among species within the genus Agalinis Raf. (=Gerardia Benth.), and between Agalinis and closely related
genera within Orobanchaceae.
We also examined relationships of Agalinis to other genera. Agalinis has long been considered to be closely related
to five other North American genera (Aureolaria, Brachystigma, Dasistoma, Macranthera and Seymeria). Close relationships among these taxa are reflected in the fact that
they were at one time included in the genus Gerardia [1,2]
and have been referred to as the "gerardioid genera". Relationships among the North American gerardioid genera
were proposed based on morphological features [14];
again, presentations of these relationships were vague and
do not conform to modern phylogenetic standards (e.g.,
were not presented as a phylogenetic tree). The gerardioid
genera were traditionally included as subtribe Agalininae
in tribe Buchnereae [1,3]. Recent molecular studies that
have included Seymeria or Agalinis indicated these taxa are
part of a monophyletic clade representing the tribe
Rhinantheae [24-27]. These studies also provided evidence that has resulted in moving Agalinis and other gerardioid genera from the family Scrophulariaceae to the
family Orobanchaceae. While it has yielded important
insights that have influenced taxonomy, this previous
molecular work has focused on broadly sampling across
Scrophulariaceae sensu lato [27,28] or sampling intensively within putatively non-photosynthetic parasitic lineages [24-26,29]. Taxon coverage within the hemi-parasitic
lineages has been relatively sparse and evolutionary relationships have not been thoroughly examined. Moreover,
relationships among the gerardioid genera and between
these genera and other Rhinantheae remain unclear. We
used GenBank [30] sequences of Castilleja linariifolia and
Pedicularis foliosa to examine placement of the gerardioid
genera in Rhinantheae and Lindenbergia philippensis as an
outgroup within Orobanchaceae [25,26,29].
Much of our motivation for studying Agalinis is the large
number of putatively rare taxa in the genus that have some
degree of taxonomic uncertainty. The genus includes six
globally vulnerable (G3), imperiled (G2) or critically
imperiled (G1) taxa, and several additional taxa are of
uncertain global conservation status (Table 2) [31]. Further, 26 of the approximately 40 North American species

imperiled (S1) in at least one state (USA) in which they
occur [31]. A number of these state-rare taxa are considered possibly synonymous with more widely ranging taxa
(e.g., A. paupercula with A. purpurea, A. tenella with A.
obtusifolia, A. decemloba with A. obtusifolia, and A. keyensis
with A. oligophylla) [32]. Additionally, a number of recog-

nized taxa are taxonomically challenging to delineate in
the field, making it unclear which populations warrant
conservation attention and protection (e.g., A. skinneriana
and A. fasciculata). Confirming or clarifying the evolutionary distinctiveness of putatively rare taxa provides information that can inform conservation actions including
determining legal status and setting priorities.

We have included 12 taxa of conservation concern in this
study (Table 2). We are particularly interested in clarifying
the distinctiveness of A. tenella from A. obtusifolia, and A.
acuta from A. tenella. Agalinis tenella occurs on the coastal
plain from North Carolina to Florida and Alabama
[3,4,33]. It is considered to be "significantly rare" in North
Carolina [33] and a species of concern in South Carolina
[34]. While this species continues to be recognized by
some authors [33], it is considered by others to be synonymous with the widespread, common A. obtusifolia [35].
Agalinis acuta is a federally-listed endangered species that
occurs in sandplain grasslands on the coastal plain in
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York
(Long Island) and at one location on the piedmont in
Maryland [31,36]. Agalinis acuta and A. tenella have been
distinguished morphologically by shorter corollas,
smaller seeds and shorter pedicels in A. acuta but their
evolutionary distinctiveness from one another has
recently been called into question. Clarifying whether
these taxa are distinct is essential to understanding their
rarity status. It is especially important in the case of A.
acuta because the assumption of evolutionary (i.e., taxonomic, phylogenetic, or genetic) distinctiveness is a fundamental requirement for listing as an endangered species
[37].
The specific objectives of this research were to test phylogenetic hypotheses concerning relationships within North
American Agalinis including following.
1. Monophyly of Agalinis as currently defined including
two species previously included in the separate genus
Tomanthera.
2. Congruence between the molecular-based phylogeny

Results and Discussion
Basic data description
We determined 18 partial rbcL sequences and these were

929–1322 bp ( x = 1293 bp) in length. Four additional
gerardioid, Rhinantheae, and outgroup rbcL sequences
were obtained from GenBank [30] (Table 3) yielding a 22
taxon data set with an aligned length of 1322 bp. We
determined 9 partial ndhF sequences and these were
2096–2122 bp ( x = 2115 bp) in length. We were unable
to amplify ndhF from nine Agalinis species (A. auriculata,
A. divaricata, A. fasciculata, A. filicaulis, A. plukenetii, A.
pulchella, A. setacea, A. strictifolia, and A. tenella). We were
unable to amplify any part of ndhF using numerous internal and external primer combinations under a variety of
PCR conditions, indicating that the lack of amplification
was not due simply to modification of one priming site.
Difficulty in amplifying ndhF sequences in some Scrophulariaceae genera has been attributed to absence or divergence [27]. This phenomenon has not been previously
reported among species within a single genus. Three additional sequences for ndhF were obtained from GenBank
(Table 3) resulting in sequences for 12 taxa with an
aligned length of 2132 bp. We determined 18 matK
sequences and these were 2715–3740 bp ( x = 2953 bp)

Further analysis suggests that there is rate heterogeneity
across lineages among the taxa we examined when Lindenbergia is used as the outgroup for rooting. A test of the
molecular clock hypothesis based on the likelihood ratio
of the topology with the highest log likelihood (Figure 2)
with (-18764.414) and without (-18429.128) assuming a
molecular clock significantly rejected the molecular clock
hypothesis (P < 0.001).

Although the greatest rate difference is among the three
codon positions within each gene region, the pairwise distances among taxa based on the three gene regions differed (Figure 1), as might be expected. Using the slope of
the relationships of the pairwise distances between each
pair of taxa as estimated for each pair of gene regions
based on linear models we have estimated that the matK
gene region evolves 1.615 × faster than rbcL, and ndhF
evolves 2.184 × faster than rbcL in these taxa. A simple
generalization was not possible for comparing matK and
ndhF because the estimated linear model fit to the pairwise distance values for these two gene regions crossed
null model expectation of rate equality (Figure 1).

Sampling from multiple regions of a genome and sampling moderately long total sequence length (approximately 5000 bp or more) have both been shown to
significantly improve resolution and support phylogenetic analyses [38-42]. The sequence length used in this
study is substantially greater than that included in most
single studies in molecular systematics. This amount of
sequence data was necessary to meet our challenging
objectives of elucidating relationships at multiple levels
including potentially relatively recently diverged taxa. In
general, longer sequences are more likely to provide more
robust estimation of phylogenetic relationships
[38,39,41], and improve computational efficiency by
increasing differentiation among alternative topologies
[41,42]. Because differences in rate variation among different regions [43,44], and differences in rate variation
among different codon positions within genes is higher
than overall rate variation among genes, all regions
sequenced provided some phylogenetic information
across all levels of investigation.

in length. Four additional sequences were obtained from
GenBank (Table 3), yielding 22 taxa with an aligned
length of 3869 bp. The combined data set included 4042–
7155 bp ( x = 5186 bp) of newly determined sequences
for each of 18 taxa. Together with sequences of Seymeria
macrophylla and three additional taxa, the combined data
set of 22 taxa had an aligned length of 7323 bp.

nucleotide substitution rate parameters, gamma distributed substitution rates and some invariant sites (i.e., GTR
+ G + I model). Successive heuristic searching and parameter value estimation yielded a tree of highest log likelihood of -18429.128. The principal implications of this
tree are discussed below.

Agalinis, as represented by the North American taxa we
sampled and including Tomanthera, is monophyletic with
a bootstrap value of 0.96 (Figure 2). We also show that
Agalinis is sister to a group composed of the gerardioid
genera with yellow or red corollas: Aureolaria, Brachystigma, Dasistoma, and Seymeria with a bootstrap value of
0.99 (Figure 2). These taxa as a whole form a monophyletic group within Rhinantheae as previously suggested based on sequences from Agalinis and Seymeria
[24].
Our results suggest that the current section-level classification within the genus needs revision. While a number of
sectional and subsectional classifications appear to be natural (i.e., taxa within some sections and subsections form
monophyletic groups), there are numerous cases of
polyphyly. Sections Erectae and Tenuifoliae as defined by
Canne-Hilliker (Table 1) appear to be the only proposed
sections comprising more than one taxon that are monophyletic (Figure 2). In contrast, sections Purpureae and
Heterophyllae are clearly polyphyletic. Section Chytra
proposed by Pennell [4] roughly in place of section Purpureae also is not monophyletic. Section Purpureae is the
largest proposed section in Agalinis and is usually treated
as being composed of multiple subsections (Table 1).
While the section is not monophyletic, each of the
subsections as they are represented in our sample except
subsection Purpureae appears to be monophyletic (Figure
2). One member of subsection Purpureae, A. fasciculata,
appears to be most closely related to A. linifolia although
the bootstrap support is low. Agalinis linifolia has always
been considered sufficiently distinct from the rest of the
members of the genus due to its perennial life history as
well as anatomical characters of the stems, roots, and
leaves, to be placed in its own section (Table 1 and citations therein). While nodes in the vicinity of A. linifolia do
not have high bootstrap values, it does not appear that
this species is basal or that it forms a single-species sister
group to all other species in the genus (Figure 2). The
placement of the other member of subsection Purpureae,
A. tenuifolia, is also not well supported as indicated by low
bootstrap values in our analysis. However, our data do
support removing A. tenuifolia from section Tenuifoliae,
as has been suggested based on stem anatomy [23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/15

Relationships of the other subsections within Purpureae
are also weakly supported. The maximum likelihood tree
indicates that Subsection Pedunculares is a sister group to
section Erectae and together they appear to form a monophyletic clade, although the bootstrap value was low
(0.60). This clade unites the two groups within the genus
that have a chromosome number of n = 13. This result is
surprising because subsection Pedunculares and section
Erectae have been considered only distantly related due to
differences in floral and vegetative characters [5,21,22].
This finding indicates that Pennell's submersion of subsection Pedunculares into subsection Setaceae (Table 1)
[4] was in error. While the results support the resurrection
of subsection Pedunculares proposed by Canne-Hilliker
(Table 1), they do not support inclusion of subsection
Pedunculares in section Purpureae. It appears that the
inferred ancestral chromosome number for Agalinis is n =
14, and that there was a single chromosome number
reduction within the genus.
The two species in section Tenuifoliae in our sample form
a strongly supported monophyletic group (bootstrap
value = 0.99); a result supporting the naturalness of this
section. Section Tenuifoliae appears as a sister group to
the n = 13 taxa (section Erectae and subsection
Pedunculares of section Purpureae); however, this relationship has low bootstrap support (< 0.50). Section Tenuifoliae was originally considered to be more closely
related to section Purpureae [3,4]. Section Erectae was
originally considered only distantly related to other sections based on its lighter, yellow-green foliage, lack of tannins and numerous inflorescence and floral characteristics
[4]. More recently detailed analysis has found many similarities between Tenuifoliae and Erectae [22] that are corroborated by our data.
Although the three groups Tenuifoliae, Pedunculares, and
Erectae form a clade; the bootstrap values uniting these
groups and uniting the Pedunculares and Erectae to the
exclusion of the Tenuifolieae are low to moderate. This
clade is interesting because as discussed above it unites
two groups that have been considered closely related
based on a number of morphological characters (Erectae
and Tenuifoliae) and two groups that are morphologically
distinct but that share chromosome number (Erectae and
Pedunculares). While bootstrap support uniting Erectae
and Pedunculares as sister groups is only 0.60, the alternative grouping of Erectae and Tenuifoliae as sister groups
never appeared in any of the 2000 bootstrap replicates.
Additional molecular data are necessary to provide
statistically significant support for relationships among
these taxa.
Our results also clarify placement of certain taxa whose
relationships have been debated such as placement of A.

aphylla in section Erectae [22]. Pennell originally considered this taxon to be in its own subsection (Aphyllae)
within section Purpureae based on its minute, scale-like,
appressed leaves [3]. Later he placed A. aphylla in subsection Setaceae of section Chytra [4]. Canne-Hilliker moved
A. aphylla to section Erectae based on chromosome
number (n = 13) [22], seed characteristics [5], and stem
anatomy [23]. That move is strongly supported by our
data.
In another case, A. auriculata, which was placed in the
genus Tomanthera [3,4], clearly falls within the genus Agalinis as has been proposed [23]. The genus Tomanthera was
distinguished from Agalinis by lack of the yellow guide
lines on the lower corolla lip and by having large, lobed
leaves; foliaceous calyx lobes; retrorsely hispid stems;
raised seed reticulations; and reduced anther cells on the
posterior stamens [3]. Whereas we demonstrate that A.
auriculata is part of Agalinis it is not sister taxon to the
other species in section Heterophyllae we sampled (A. heterophylla; Figure 2), making the section Heterophyllae
polyphyletic. Although A. auriculata falls well within Agalinis (i.e., it shares a number of inferred common ancestors with other Agalinis species), A. heterophylla, another
species placed within section Heterophyllae, is basal to
the rest of the species in the genus.
One of our objectives was to evaluate the evolutionary distinctiveness of A. tenella from A. obtusifolia, and A. acuta
from A. tenella. We were able to determine that A. tenella
and A. obtusifolia are not synonymous as has been suggested [35], and thus submerging A. tenella is not warranted. These taxa are closely related, but are
evolutionarily distinct (Figure 2). The branch length from
the inferred most recent common ancestor to A. obtusifolia
is significant (0.00738, S.E. = 0.00112, P < 0.001), as is
the branch length to A. tenella (0.00026, S.E. = 0.00026, P
= 0.003). The number of pairwise differences between A.
obtusifolia and A. tenella over 3657 aligned nucleotides
positions includes 66 substitutions (0.018) and 5 indels
involving 7 positions. The differentiation of these taxa is
important because A. tenella has been considered to be
imperiled in at least two states but merging these taxa
would eliminate A. tenella for consideration for
protection.
In contrast, we found very little divergence between A.
acuta and A. tenella, indeed the smallest amount of divergence among any of the taxa we examined (Figure 2); one
substitution over 4048 aligned nucleotide positions
(0.0002). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain ndhF
sequence from A. tenella, thus limiting our ability to detect
divergence. It is critical to more thoroughly examine this
issue using molecular markers that will provide sufficient
resolution to determine if these two taxa are really on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/15

independent evolutionary trajectories. Given the apparent
lack of differentiation in chloroplast genes, yet recognized
morphological differentiation, it appears be that nuclear
genome markers (e.g., expressed sequence tags [ESTs]
and/or microsatellites) sampled from multiple
populations combined with coalescent-based analysis
and detailed morphological measurement would be useful for studying the relationships of these taxa.
Beyond the genus Agalinis we were able to provide some
insights into relationships among the gerardioid genera.
Previous thoughts regarding evolution of the these genera
that Aureolaria is the most primitive genus and closely
resembles the common ancestor of the group [14] are
clearly incorrect. Aureolaria is among the most derived
genera in our sample (Figure 2). Further, there is a close
relationship between Aureolaria and Dasistoma. Divergence between D. macrophylla and A. pedicularia is less
than divergence between all pairs of Agalinis species
except A. acuta and A. tenella. Similarities in vegetative
parts in Aureolaria and Dasistoma have been noted, but the
two genera have been considered distinct based on floral
morphology [14]. On the whole the differentiation
among the gerardioid genera (as indicated by relatively
short branch lengths) is modest compared to that among
species of Agalinis and among other Rhinantheae genera
(Figure 2).

Conclusions
As the first molecular systematic study and phylogenetic
analysis of Agalinis, this research contributes toward
understanding of relationships among taxa in the genus.
It provides support for some, and refutes other, previous
suggestions regarding classification of a number of species, subsections and sections. Furthermore this work contributes to understanding relationships among members
of the Orobanchaceae in general.
Phylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of Agalinis,
including species formerly in Tomanthera, and this group
as sister to the gerardioid genera Aureolaria, Brachystigma,
Dasistoma, and Seymeria. Many of the previously described
sections within Agalinis are polyphyletic, although many
of the subsections appear to form natural groups. The
analysis reveals a single evolutionary event leading to a
reduction in chromosome number from n = 14 to n = 13
based on the sister group relationship of section Erectae
and section Purpureae subsection Pedunculares. Our
results establish the evolutionary distinctiveness of A. tenella, as species of conservation concern, from the more
widespread and common A. obtusifolia. However, further
data are required to clearly resolve the relationship of A.
acuta and A. tenella.

Methods
Taxa sampled
A total of 22 taxa were included in our study (Tables 2 and
3). We sampled 15 taxa representing all North American
sections of the genus Agalinis as well as Aureolaria pedicularia (L) Raf., Brachystigma wrightii (A. Gray) Pennell, and
Dasistoma macrophylla (Nutt.) Raf. (Tables 2 and 3).
Sequences from four additional taxa (Seymeria pectinata
Pursh, Castilleja linariifolia Benth., Pedicularis foliosa L, and
Lindenbergia philippensis (Cham.) Benth.) were obtained
from GenBank [30] (Table 3) to help elucidate phylogenetic relationships among Agalinis and the other gerardioid genera.
DNA preparation
DNA was isolated from fresh or frozen leaves and flower
buds by grinding 50–75 mg of tissue to powder in liquid
nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, and then using GenElute Plant Genomic DNA Kits (Sigma Chemical
Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.
Sequence regions and PCR amplification
We sampled sequences of the following chloroplast gene
regions: rbcL, which encodes the large subunit of ribulose1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; matK, which
includes partial sequence of the gene for ribosomal protein S16 (rps16), an intergenic spacer, the 5' exon of lysine
tRNA (trnK), the gene for maturase K (matK), an intron
sequence and the 3' exon of lysine tRNA (trnK), and a partial gene for photosystem II D1 protein (psbA); and ndhF
which encodes NADH dehydrogenase subunit F.

We selected these gene regions for sequencing because
previous studies indicated that ndhF and matK are among
the most rapidly evolving protein coding genes in the
chloroplast genome [44,45], and thus have been firmly
established as useful regions at the levels of divergence
that are the primary focus of this research. rbcL evolves
more slowly, and collectively the three regions provide
information across the range of divergence levels we
examined (from among species within Agalinis to among
genera within Orobanchaceae). Further, the majority of
these regions are protein coding thus minimizing insertions and deletions and allowing unambiguous alignments. Finally, the large amount of comparative data from
other studies of these gene regions in angiosperms [45,46]
and particularly in the Scrophulariaceae sensu lato [25-28]
allowed us to incorporate existing data for other taxa, provided a strong comparative framework for our results, and
allowed us to take advantage of primer sequences
designed and tested by others.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/15

PCR amplification
Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were based on Eppendorf MasterTaq PCR kits (Brinkman, Westbury, New York,
USA) run on an MJ Research PTC-200 Thermal Cycler. For
rbcL we used primer sequences Z-1 and Z-1375 from
Zurawski et al. [47] to amplify the whole target region. We
also used their internal primer Z-1204R and five internal
primers of our own design for sequencing. For the matK
region we used primers rps16-4547F and psbA-R from
Johnson and Soltis [45] to amplify the whole region. We
used seven of their internal sequencing primers and six
primers of our own design. For ndhF we used primers 1
and 2110R from Olmstead and Sweere [41] to amplify the
entire ndhF region, six of their internal sequencing primers, and two primers of our own design (Additional file 1).
Specific amplification conditions for each primer combination in each of gene region varied (1). In general, the
PCR temperature profile was 30 cycles of 94°C for 60 s,
annealing temperature set approximately 5°C below the
lower of the two primer melting temperatures for 90 s,
72°C for 150 s, and a final 15 min elongation period at
72°C. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA from fragments of the expected size
was extracted and purified using the QIAQuick DNA
cleanup system according to manufacturer's instructions
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California, USA).
DNA sequencing
Direct sequencing of PCR-generated templates was done
using reactions based on the chemistry of BigDye Terminator v3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kits (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) with reactions
set up in 96-well microtiter plates using a robotic workstation. Cycle sequencing was performed on MJ Research
PTC-200 Thermal Cyclers. Sequencing reactions were
cleaned by isopropanol precipitation to remove unincorporated labeled terminators prior to running the samples
on an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA Analyzer. We conducted bi-directional sequencing with ≥ fourfold coverage
to ensure high accuracy of the sequence data.
Data analysis
Sequence trace curves were collected on the computer
controlling the sequencer. After completion of each set of
sequencing runs the trace curves were transferred as SCFformatted files to a Linux workstation for all subsequent
processing and analysis. Base calling and quality assignments were made using the program phred [48,49]. Data
from individual sequencing runs were assembled into
final complete sequence using the program phrap [50].
Contigs were evaluated with the help of the program
consed [51].

Multiple alignments for each gene region were performed
using ClustalW [52] and edited if deemed appropriate.

These multiple alignments were simple and results were
unambiguous because the majority of the sequences
coded for proteins and showed relatively few insertion or
deletion events. Multiple alignments for each gene region
were concatenated to form a single combined data set.
Phylogenetic relationships were determined by maximum
likelihood analysis [53] of the aligned nucleotide
sequences. Data exploration was done to determine the
most appropriate model using preliminary phylogenetic
trees and the programs Modeltest [54] and PAUP* [55].
Successive heuristic searching (with multiple random
taxon addition and tree bisection-reconnection branch
swapping) and model parameter value estimation was
done to find the highest likelihood tree using PAUP*.
Support for specific relationships was assessed with the
bootstrap [56] using PAUP*. For the bootstrap analysis,
the parameters of the likelihood model were set to those
of the highest likelihood tree based on the original data.
For each of 2000 replicates a single simple addition heuristic search was conducted with tree bisection-reconnection branch swapping. Estimating likelihood parameter
values and applying them to bootstrap replicates is more
efficient then re-estimating the values for each bootstrap
replicate [57]. As a supplementary evaluation, we estimated branch lengths with standard errors, and tested
their significance with likelihood ratio tests using PAUP*.
To compare the rates of evolution of the three gene
regions, we estimated pairwise distances among all pairs
of taxa using the same likelihood model described above
using PAUP* [55]. We used linear models as implemented by the R system for statistical computing [58] to
describe the relationships of distances among these taxon
pairs as estimated by each of the three gene regions. We
also tested the molecular clock hypothesis (i.e., that all
lineages evolved at the same rate) based on the likelihood
ratio of the topology with the highest log likelihood with
and without assuming a molecular clock.
